brandnew,3e2fsk,ibridgham,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:20 2015 UTC,"This is really great, thanks for sharing! I think I probably like the album version better just because the screaming/solo really captures that aspect of the emotions basically unmatchably. But this shows of the despair of it all maybe better than the album version."
brandnew,3e55pm,DOMAN127,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:09:40 2015 UTC,How do you know this is a new pressing and not just the old black pressing from a year or two ago? Genuinely curious; I already have that pressing and I don't want two of the same pressings.
brandnew,3e55pm,danielreddits,2,Wed Jul 22 01:19:45 2015 UTC,"I don't. In fact, it's likely the same one. I couldn't find an eloquent way to say ""they're releasing more copies of the most recent pressing"" in the title.    It may not be the same, though, since I got the link from Vinyl Collective, where someone said it was a new pressing."
brandnew,3e55pm,danielreddits,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:35:36 2015 UTC,Alrighty thanks. I don't think I'll take the risk until someone can confirm it's a different pressing though.

brandnew,3e3adn,eatroffles,4,Tue Jul 21 17:05:39 2015 UTC,I'd have to say the TDAG because it's just great. Also the artist who took the photo is brilliant.
brandnew,3e3adn,Clockworkoverclocked,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:04 2015 UTC,I really really really like the original vinyl and Japanese release Your Favorite Weapon design.
brandnew,3e3adn,rbur70x7,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:22 2015 UTC,"I think Deja is the most widely recognizable cover, but i think TDAG has the best artwork.  well, if previous releases tell us anything, its that there is absolutley no clue what brand new will decide to put on the cover.   although, the at the bottom single was a bird and then the cover of daisy there was a fox. the jesus single had jellyfish.  the mene single has a snake.  maybe brand new is going down the astrological symbol route or something. whatever that astrology ring of symbols is around the daisy cd and vinyl. displaying different animals?  they've said they're trying to backtrack to find a sound they could've gone with inbetween deja and TDAG, so run with that how you will..."
brandnew,3e3adn,fght_off_yr_dmns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"Hard to pick a favorite, but I would say TDAG just because I like the feeling it gives me. In a way its calming, I like the colors a lot and it looks cold where they are.  Daisy on the hand makes me feel dirty, uneasy, and hot lol.   As for the next album.... I have no idea what to expect.  I really like Mene's cover a lot.  I like the flowers for the Sealed to Me lyric sheet..."

It seems the artist didn't really listen to Deja and BN just wanted some good artwork. I really dislike it when a band chooses to have cool artwork over something with a connection to the music.
brandnew,3e3adn,sizeablescars,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:14:00 2015 UTC,Well there's a reason everyone gets the Deja cover as a tattoo  I hope to see a laser gun on the cover. Because I like laser guns

brandnew,3e2ban,jeswork,4,Tue Jul 21 12:22:18 2015 UTC,I was at the June Manchester gig and am going to the September London one so I would be a bit disappointed if it was the same or very similar set. But it's BN so I would get over it!
brandnew,3e2ban,twotonwhale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:10 2015 UTC,"Same situation (same shows), I really don't mind if it's the same set-that was an insane set. I doubt the intimate shows will be topped but also I don't feel like it'll be  a pointless tour. It may even be Daisy heavy or something like that to put it to rest before they start promoting the new album. That being said I think one or two new songs will be on the setlist, just because of how the timelines for TDAG and Daisy worked out with premiering songs live, by September they should be playing 3/4 each show."
brandnew,3e2ban,highkingnm,4,Tue Jul 21 19:19:43 2015 UTC,"I'd get over it if they didn't play anything new, as long as they played some songs they don't always play. Something like Noro, In a Jar, Not the Sun, Handcuffs, Maradona, Untitled 5. Just something to make it a bit different!"
brandnew,3e2ban,r_ocketskates,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:16 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, the trio In A Jar, Daisy, Noro would be awesome but unlikely, Maradona would cause me to freak out, but my absolute dream (aside from new material) would be Fork and Knife and/or Out Of Range. Either would make me the happiest person ever."

brandnew,3e2ban,twotonwhale,2,Tue Jul 21 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"This is how I've felt since the 2014 tour so I'm glad I'm not alone here. That was essentailly a repeat of the 2012 tour before it and the 2015 shows, while better, still weren't much different.    With Mene and Sealed to Me being played live, I thought the new album might've been quite close (i.e. released before this September tour) but after Jesse's Spanish interview, it feels even further away and I'm convinced we're going to get the same old sets we always have."
brandnew,3e2ban,fghtffyrrss,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"I really don't get down with the whole ""Brand New doesn't owe you anything blah blah blah"" but seriously? If they don't play something new it will be a ""bit of a pointless tour""? I'd say the chances of it happening are really slim and that if you don't want to hear the usual songs you probably shouldn't bother going."
brandnew,3e2ban,streetxmanifesto,2,Tue Jul 21 21:39:16 2015 UTC,I've been seeing them for three years and it's been six years since they released Daisy. The setlist has been almost the same every time. I'm not complaining but it's true that to just tour the UK and then come back two months later to play the same set they've been playing for a while would be a shame.  How is that hard to understand?

I wound up punching my friend in the face in the pit and put his tooth through his lip.  That didnt stop him.  It was an insane show.  BN and TBS played cut without the e, seventy times 7, and great romances of the 20th century together.  It was Rufios first show in the east coast.  I will never forget that show.  Birch hill was a shithole for a venue but had such a great energy and was my favorite places to see shows.  Its been gone a long time now.  My friends used to play their with their band and i used to just go without knowing who was playing.  I first heard a static lullabye, the starting line, and a bunch of other bands.    Edit:  I also saw Yellowcaed there when they first started out coming up north.  This girl got made at me in the pit and she started throwing roundhouse kicks at my face.  After she kicked me a couple times I pushed her on the ground when she tried to kick me again and she cried.  It was pretty funny.  I have no idea why she was mad at me."

In 2014, Glasgow held the Commonwealth Games and as part of the regeneration of the City, a park was created near the famous Barrowlands Ballroom venue. The path in the park wasn't a normal path but instead designed to look like a shelf filled with records. The spine of the sleeves has the name and date of every act to headline the venue from 1983 to 2013. Brand New played the venue in 2009 (and 2014 so narrowly missed appearing twice). The pathway is pretty cool and it's cool that in a park in my hometown their name appears.    Here's what the pathway looks like for anyone interested    Seeing as BN graffiti seems to have taken off, I thought it would be an interesting post to see them immortalised officially (and outside of LI/NY/US as well)/"

Specifically when they closed with You Won't Know. When the song is supposed to kinda quiet down and end softly, Jesse says ""fuck that"" and just completely blows my mind.   ""AND I DONT HAVE A TELEPHONE!  TO TELL YOU THAT IM DEAD AND GONE SO YOU WONT KNOOOOW!""  And then he fucking knocks the the mic stand and goes ape shit on stage, throwing his other mic stand as well. Leading to him ripping the plastic off his pedalboard with his headstock (it was raining) and making the pedals just echo with feedback. Probably my favorite single song ever."

First minute was calm in the crowd as the first four songs had been. Then He just yelled ""Pray, pray,pray,pray,pray,pray,no more, pray"" and all hell broke loose. Jesse sttarted flying around the stage, almost whacked me in the head with his guitar, was just screaming and was so into it. It was like a switch flicked from emotive to just raw and crazy in a matter of seconds and the corwd went hectic for the rest of the show. Best live song I've ever heard, except maybe Jesus from the same show. Seriously worth a listen at least. Mindblowingly good."

Not lame at all to fall in love with something beautiful that adds deeper meaning to and appreciation for life, ever.  Second, be careful with downloads for Fight Off Your Demons: the best actual rip you'll find is 192 kbps if I recall properly, of a mediocre audio source.  Anything claiming to be higher than that is just a transcode (louder version of the exact same sound quality, potentially adding some artifacts if I recall properly).  DEFINITELY hop on those as well.  It's not even proper to call it what led up to TDAG because it honestly sounds like its own album as well, and you'll be blown away by the alternate (original) version of Archers at the end.  Or I hope so, anyway, haha.  (Archers off TDAG is my favorite song by them, but the FOYD demo version is amazing in its own way.)"

I must admit I stubbled upon them through their second full length album and fell in love automatically. So now I'm running back through their previous works.   A little background: I find myself unable to find any bands (in my opinion) that are close to Brand New lyrically and then I give ""Home, Like Noplace Is There"" a spin and this is some of the best writing I've heard ever.   I dug a little deeper and found a song titled ""Southern Discomfort"" and when the :40 second mark hit my jaw dropped. There's a re-tooling of Soco Amaretto Lime. Enjoy."

I'd definitely check out their ep and their album Varuna and if you like that check out tigers on trains which is a side project. Honestly all the guys in that band seem to have side projects and I love them all they're underrated group of musicians.   I wouldn't say they're entirely too similar lyrically but at times they give me a sense of nostalgia that I usually find in Jesse's lyrics specifically in a song like Pitch and Resin which is maybe my favorite song of theirs.

brandnew,3dkmbc,craigmassie,2,Fri Jul 17 07:42:42 2015 UTC,"I've heard that the LP60, while not as bad as crosley, isn't much better? And that with a bit more savings the LP120 would be a better investment? I'm new to vinyl though so I can't explain why this is lol but I have read this on a few websites because I too am looking for a player myself. But I'd love to hear other's thoughts on it though before I count it out!"
brandnew,3dkmbc,babydontreply,4,Fri Jul 17 07:57:22 2015 UTC,"This is correct. The lp60 is only marginally better than a Crosley, really still not meeting any bare minimum of passable quality though, and most racks like a real sum' bitch due to the poor geometry inherent to the design. It literally struggles to actually play through a record, and more often than not, it can't. That says it all right there. The 120 is a very significant step up and definitely acceptable for a beginner's new turntable, and is still good enough that most people would be happy with it without wanting to upgrade. There really aren't many suitable options available for less money without going for used/vintage gear. The u-turn orbit comes to mind, that's really it though."
brandnew,3dkmbc,MrRom92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"""Literally struggles to actually play through a record"" is definitely not true, the lp60 is definitely better than it's made out to be. Was my first turntable, and it sounded great for the price. Hook it up to a decent amp and speakers, and it's not even in comparison with a crosley.   Yes the orbit is a better buy, but then again, it's only available in North America."
brandnew,3dkmbc,craigmassie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"Not even counting the issues with speed stability or the low torque of the motor which gets sluggish under the weight of a record (the one thing it's meant to spin) the tonearm itself is intrinsically of a poor quality, and mistracks wherever given the opportunity. To the point where it will actually skip on many records, which is an absurd level of tolerance for mistracking. You generally want to minimize it, that thing out of the box tracks so poorly that it sometimes just can't track at all.   See: /r/vinyl and the abundance of threads like ""help!

I always thought of it as showing that the 2 scary men are supposed to look very scary on first glance but the slippers are showing a connection to the young girl that they still have some childhood innocence.

That was one of the few song titles that were actually confirmed and we kinda just assigned it to one of the ""untitleds"" where we thought it fit   Personally I'm inclined to think it was an early version of Degausser, the title indicates the songs would have been similar thematically"
brandnew,3dekpk,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"Ya I read basically the same thing, that BN had started referring to a song as cleanser and BN fans guessed that they were reffering to untitled 5 but they weerere wrong"
brandnew,3dekpk,sizeablescars,4,Thu Jul 16 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"Untitled 5 is called Cleanser. ""Nobody Moves"" was written down on their setlists when they first played it but Degausser was also called ""The Storm is Coming"" on the same early sets. Even this year, Mene was down as ""Don't Feel Anything"".   I think some the naming confusion comes from the interview with Alex Dunne (at least I think it was him) who had heard TDAG before its release and said something like ""there's a 7 minute song that'll blow your mind"". I can't remember how it came about, whether he said it in the interview or from the band via another source, but it was said that that 7 minute song he was referring to wasn't called Cleanser. We knew BN had a 7 minute long song from the TDAG Untitled Demos leak (which we found out was called Cleanser) and we knew there was a 7 minute song on TDAG that would blow our minds (which would describe Cleanser) so it was assumed he was talking about Untitled 05 and that the name had changed.

brandnew,3dekpk,wicryeker,12,Thu Jul 16 15:09:48 2015 UTC,"(all the following is from some forum Source)  As someone mentioned above, I see this album as a whole as a story surrounding the infamous Limousine song. I'll break it down the best I can. And realize this is just one interpretation, this whole story could be false and just the product of someone who has too much time on their hands.  The story, I believe, starts with Welcome to Bangkok, finishes the album, and circles back to the beginning, and finishing with You Won't Know.  Welcome to Bangkok ""Space Cadet Pull Out"" is a reference to Deja Entendu and the astronaut on the cover. They're basically letting you know that this is where Deja ends and this story begins.  Not the Sun This is where the story of the drunk driver in Limousine begins. He is in a relationship with a woman and he's asked her to marry him (""Be my babe"", also ""say you're my friend, why won't you be my family?""). The entire song he's asking her not to reject him (""don't be that note I can't hold,"" etc.)  Luca He's still wondering why she won't accept (""So touch me or don't, just let me know""), while dwelling on his loneliness (""I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake""). A lot of this song is confusing to me, for instance, Jesse talking about drowning someone in the lake (which I assumed was a metaphor referring to the ""plenty of fish in the sea"" saying).  Untitled ""I could never miss you""... or whatever it actually is. Who knows. Maybe the character is just kind of letting go.  Archer's Bows Have Broken He's now questioning what he's done with his life up to this point. He's invested so much into something that didn't work out, whats left of him? (""Who do you carry the torch for, my young man? Do you believe in anything?) He might be questioning God... why would God do this to him? (""sweep me under the rug, beating with the book everyone the book told you to love"" and ""burning out sins til there's nothing but dust."") He's obviously lost now and realizing that he's never had purpose or religion.  Handcuffs He's pretty much depressed and saying he'd do anything for her. (""I'd drive my car off of a bridge, if I knew that you weren't inside."") He also mentions again his lack of religion/morals with ""it's hard to be a better man, when you forget you're trying.""  Sowing Season He's been drinking away his pain (""he's losing [his friends] to drinking and to driving.""). He's trying to find direction (""Is it in you now?""). While questioning himself, he references his putting so much in to a failing relationship (""is it in you now, to watch the things you gave your life to, broken."" and ""Somebody threw that brick, shattered all your plans.""). He's realizing that things may be coming to an end (""before you put my body in the cold ground..."") and has one more cry for the one who left him (""I'm just a man who knows how to feel, i'm not your friend, i'm not your lover, i'm not your family."")  Millstone He's reflecting on how he had his whole life on track. He was doing everything right, and now that this relationship failed, he's turned himself into a worthless mess (""I used to be such a burning example, I used to be original"" and ""I used to make my parents proud."") More references to his current lack of religion (""I used to pray like God was listening."") A reference to the bible with Millstones (""With my own stone around me neck...""), a millstone was tied around a criminals neck so that they would sink to the bottom of a lake. He may be crying out to God when he says ""Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give.""  Jesus Christ He's realized that he needs to make a change. He needs questions answered about what his life has added up to and what it means for him when he dies. This whole song is quite self explanatory. He's scared of what is to become of him, so it is basically a conversation with God or Jesus. This song has some of the best lyrics of any song I've ever heard.  Degausser He's upset. He's saying goodbye to this crappy life that has become his. ""Goodbye to love"" is him getting over his heartbreak. ""It's a ride that will push you up, right against the wall."" He's saying that he loved her, and in in the end it messed him up. One big tell that connects this song to the theory is the line ""I really do wish that you'd wear my ring."" He still wants her (""take me take me back to your bed, I love you so much that it hurts my head."") but he screwed up (""I'll never say anything right."") Things are coming to a head and he's let the pain change him. ""The storm is coming, the storm is coming..."" is a warning of what happens in Limousine.  Limousine Most everyone knows its a song about Katie Flynn (often mentioned as Kay), the seven year old flower girl that died in a limousine after her mothers wedding by a drunk driver. Whats important to the story is that the second verse is from the view of the drunk driver. ""How can I get myself out from underneath this guilt that will crush me."" He realizes that this struggle with himself and with God has really come head on with his fuck up. ""In the choir, I saw our sad Messiah, He was bored and tired of my laments. He said 'I died for you one time, but never again.'"" Truly moving words.  You Won't Know He's messed up big time and now he's dealing with it. This song is saying that he's done something so bad that if he was perfect for the rest of his life, little Kay would never know it. ""Your daughters weren't careful, I fear that I am a slippery slope."" When he says ""you can't blame your mother, shes trying not to see you as her worst mistake."" he's saying that he feels bad for her mom, who somehow thinks it is partly her fault for not being in the car with her when the accident occurred. He's even contemplating suicide (""I am fine to put your gun to my life, and know i'm scared that it won't fire right."") And lastly, he circles back to his fear of life after death (""On the day that I go up they'll be completely out of their forgiveness supply."")  There is so many more connections, lyrically. It would be impossible for me to go through and pick out how each line might relate. So take this for what you will. Right or wrong, it makes this album even more interesting, and in my opinion, amazingly brilliant.  (capypasta)  I agree with the whole ""album starts with Bangkok"" theory. I hadn't thought about it before I read it here, but after listening to it in that order several times, it seems almost undeniable to me. The big question isn't whether or not the album starts with ""Bankok"", it's why does the album not start with track 1?  I think it has to do with the fact that Welcome to Bangkok is 7 (God) and ends on 6 (the Devil). It also leads to a cyclical album. If the album begins and ends in the middle of the cd, it never really ends. Sort of like the battle between God and the Devil. The fact that the album (and the struggle) never end is actually suggested in ""Untitled"" (""This never ends"")."

brandnew,3dekpk,fghtffyrrss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:49:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the 7 ""I love you so much""s are meant to represent the 7 years that Katie had lived before the accident."
brandnew,3dekpk,JessePapa,2,Thu Jul 16 09:03:07 2015 UTC,"I don't buy into it. As an album clearly so personal to Jesse I cannot see it being about events surrounding people he's never met. Plus, a lot of the time, it's strenuous to make links. I think Limo is where it ends. I cannot see Jesse clearly being so invested in the album if it's about other people."
brandnew,3dekpk,highkingnm,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, this has been discussed before on here. If you start with Welcome to Bangkok and play it through to have You Won't Know as the finale, the sound of the album goes from a mostly happy tone to one where the character has lost everything, culminating in Limousine and YWK as the aftermath.  I agree with the theory, if you listen to Welcome to Bangkok the lyrics seem to be 'Space Cadet, pull out' or something similar. This is likely a reference to the Deja cover, suggesting the song comes first after Deja."
brandnew,3dekpk,twotonwhale,3,Wed Jul 15 18:27:43 2015 UTC,I think one of the strongest themes for me on this album seems to be about Sheri leaving Jesse/him wanting to marry her. I think you've read way too much into this.
brandnew,3dekpk,r_ocketskates,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"Even the first line of the album relates to it. Now reading the lyrics of Sowing Season again with your idea in mind it could definitely fit the mind of the driver after the crash.  He's losing his friends to drinking and driving because the accident may have very well made him lose a lot of friends. No doubt a lot of people would hate you for something like what he did, accident or not.   The verses after the first chorus (""Is it in you now..."") could definitely be about how he is forced to come to terms with the incident (referencing Rudyard Kipling's powem If) and how the mother, father, and family of the girl have to come to terms with what happened as well (""To watch the things you gave your life to broken...""). It seems like they use the couple lines from If that focus more on what it takes to be a strong human being rather than just a strong man.  After the next chorus the next verse is even more easy to read with the Limousine incident in mind. Obviously the driver is the one who threw the brick and shattered all the plans including going home for the first time as a happy family.  So overall the song could definitely be about how the people involved in the limousine incident have to figure out how to move on from something so horrible even though it might be hard to live with, for both the parents and the driver."

brandnew,3ddh1c,swrebelette,2,Thu Jul 16 13:40:40 2015 UTC,Yes :)
brandnew,3ddh1c,DOMAN127,4,Thu Jul 16 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"The thing is that album's actual master is highly compressed and just not very well mixed in the first place, at least on the really loud songs. Take Sic Transit Gloria for instance, when the chorus hits the drums completely collapse into this little box of washiness, just sounds like it was wayyy over driven into some outboard compressor during mastering. I think it's sorta become part of the appeal of the album in a way though"
brandnew,3ddh1c,wildcard6270,3,Wed Jul 15 16:05:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Mine sounds good. I think. And no. No Crosley or frame. Maybe you got a shitty copy? Did you clean it? I'll pay closer attention the next time I listen, but I didn't think it sounded bad at all. It's not the BEST sounding record I own, but it's far from the worst. #anythingfromVictoryRecords"
brandnew,3ddh1c,benjamincarter2113,3,Wed Jul 15 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"From what Ive noticed is that it seems a bit less dynamic than my FLAC version. But by no means does it sound bad, just not exceptional. If i were rating it Id probably give it about a 6 or 7/10. Of course it may as well just be the cheap cartridge I have n my U-Turn Orbit.   For me, the only Brand New thing that actually sounds exceptional (IMO) on my table is (Surprisingly) My green pressing of Daisy."

brandnew,3ddh1c,MrRom92,2,Wed Jul 15 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you I went in to that purchase with the lowest expectations of basically what you described, but I was pleasantly surprised. While the pressing quality itself was not all that great, the mastering definitely seemed to be significantly better than whatever we had for the past 10+ years on cd, both tonally and in regards to dynamic range. Not to mention significantly better than the old 1st/2nd press vinyl also. Of course the recording/master itself sucks quite a bit and there's not much that can be done about that, but I did feel that there was significant improvement over what was previously available.   What's your setup like? I can only assume by your post that it is reasonably better than a Crosley. My only guess is that the finer grooves of the DMM cut may be more difficult to track without a very finely profiled stylus."
brandnew,3ddh1c,MrRom92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"It's arguably modest, but I've got:   Audio Technica AT PL-120 (Technics SL-1200 inspired model, Before they added USB) Shure M97xe Cartridge Cambridge Audio 640p Pre Amp Kenwood Model Eleven or Yamaha RX673 receiver (I switch it up, generally the Kenwood for Vinyl) Cerwin Vega AT-12 (Recently re-built)"
brandnew,3ddh1c,MrRom92,2,Fri Jul 17 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"Maaaaan those vintage vegas are sweet. I too am running an m97xe, although I have mine with the aftermarket SAS stylus manufactured by JICO of Japan - which features a very severely profiled diamond, mounted on a boron cantilever. It's much higher compliance than the stock stylus as well. There is a huge difference in the sound between the two so that could account for the tonal differences we are hearing, I am surprised that the dynamic range is seemingly worse for you than on the digital release though. Maybe you happen to have a better flac source than I do? (Alternate cd mastering?)"
brandnew,3ddh1c,DOMAN127,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:45 2015 UTC,"I'll have to look into a better stylus.  Do you have a link for that JICO?  Also, any good recommendations on a better table.    I've always hated that mine doesn't have an external ground wire."
brandnew,3dep9f,Captain_Lightfoot,5,Wed Jul 15 18:10:23 2015 UTC,"Your submission title is very confusing, as not only does this not sound like stuff Brand New has done, but the Colour Revolt is an entirely separate band and your title makes it sound as though you think it's an album that Brand New did, rather than a band that happened to tour with them a little bit a long time back.  That's my best guess at the reason for the downvotes."
brandnew,3dep9f,japr,-1,Thu Jul 16 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"Meh, don't really care about the down votes.   You're right at the confusion, sloppy title. What I wa trying to say was that it reminded me of a specific live sound that Brand New had back in the day, during their tours with Anathallo and Colour Revolt. It was their first real foray into a very antagonistic sound. A song like ""Mattresses Underwater"" highlightsthe influences that brought out their new emphasis on dissonance in TDAG.   But, hey, homies can hate. It was just intended as a stream-of-consciousness post. Emotions and sounds linking in my head. My bad. :/"

brandnew,3db6u3,BreezyBlink,10,Tue Jul 14 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"Although not my favorite song, I always show people Degausser, I think it shows the entire Brand New spectrum."
brandnew,3db6u3,twentythreesigns,3,Tue Jul 14 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time showing people the band, because if they're not quite into pop-punk, they won't ""get it"". Degausser so far has done justice."
brandnew,3db6u3,Skatinbrad,-2,Wed Jul 15 01:32:59 2015 UTC,Brand New is pop-punk?
brandnew,3db6u3,ValencourtMusic,4,Wed Jul 15 01:37:44 2015 UTC,Definitely not. I know genres don't matter or whatever but I'd say alt rock / indie / emo / post-hardcore. A mixture of all of those.
brandnew,3db6u3,ghostbythewalls,4,Wed Jul 15 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"I mean YFW is their most accessible record, and if people don't like pop punk, they likely won't enjoy YFW and parts of Deja"
brandnew,3db6u3,Skatinbrad,5,Wed Jul 15 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"Terribly hate to disagree, but I do. I think Deja for production alone is way more accessible, but the songwriting fills a lot of niches wishing the mature BN and poppier side of things, too."
brandnew,3db6u3,iamtraviscd,4,Wed Jul 15 03:48:03 2015 UTC,"Deja is definitely the most accessible Brand New has to offer. YFW frankly is full of the kind of lyrics a lot of people would laugh at, and it's a much more ""busy"" sounding album. Deja is more mature and focused but not without just the right amount of neurosis, and just about every song sounds like it could've been a radio staple if they were marketed aggressively."
brandnew,3db6u3,eifersucht12a,3,Wed Jul 15 06:45:31 2015 UTC,"Yea but they put out one pop-punkish record. That's what they were in 2001. That's not what they are now, and I would not expect them to ever fall back into that style. The other records are nowhere near that.  I just would never show anyone YFW to get them into Brand New, because that's the only record that sounds like that.  Also, i don't think that's their most accessible album. Maybe at the time it was out, but times and tastes have changed if anything IMO was going to showcase Brand New best, I'd think it was Deja, or even TDAG would likely have a good projection."
brandnew,3db6u3,ValencourtMusic,20,Wed Jul 15 02:24:56 2015 UTC,Fork and Knife just to fuck with them
brandnew,3db6u3,drywallq,7,Tue Jul 14 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"Probably Sowing Season. I think that song is sort of THE Brand New song to me. The lyrics, the feel, the instrumentation; it just showcases what they're all about."
brandnew,3db6u3,wabisabi218,2,Wed Jul 15 08:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if not what I said, then this one. Sowing Season is what it's all about man..."
brandnew,3db6u3,ibridgham,13,Wed Jul 15 17:39:46 2015 UTC,Probably something off one of the first two albums. Jude Law or Sic Transit. If I wanted to go with a song that shows what Brand New is about to me here and now it'd be either Degausser or You Won't Know. But I'd be more interested to show them what Brand New was and then what they became. One of the most appealing aspects of Brand New to me has been their logical progression across albums. I think they're one of the best evolved bands I've ever heard. They're the Walter White of musicians.

I've sold different people on them with Sink once, Jaws Theme once but just because I knew the person would like it.  But usually I will use Degausser. Because it's got the perfect mix of very nice sounding slow parts with great lyrics, epic breakdowns with a fantastically screamed chorus, great guitar riffs, and just enough Brand New weirdness that people usually are like ""This part is... strange"" just to get them used to the idea that Brand New will do weird things sometimes."

brandnew,3d8hn8,wayne_fox,5,Tue Jul 14 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"It's actually about ten seconds from the last hit of the drums and vocals (I count the fade out as part of the 'death' with the silence). Maybe measures is the wrong term, I'm not a musician. But it is definitely three repeats of the main riff/theme. I sing it in my head every time. I count the drums go 1,2,3,4 3 times. Maybe that's not a measure, but that's definitely the length."
brandnew,3d8hn8,Coos-Coos,2,Tue Jul 14 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"Seems like from the live versions that it's exactly 3 beats from when they completely stop playing, not seconds or measures, which would make sense because there's a pickup note in the riff. You can count it from their head bobs. http://youtu.be/SZ6aePXR_GM"
brandnew,3d8hn8,wayne_fox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:49 2015 UTC,"Well that explains how we were so far apart - while there's still music going I was viewing the song as still alive. From silence to back in there's about 3 seconds.  What you're describing is a measure (or a bar), but it still can't understand how you're getting three of them from the moment the drums stop. The guitar fades out (and slightly slows down) over two bars, and that silence is way longer than just a other bar, even if you take the tempo the guitar slowed down to..."
brandnew,3d8hn8,Blarbloo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Maybe I'm mentally slowing it down, but I thought it worked.

brandnew,3d8vnj,wicryeker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"I have the Your Favorite Weapon vinyl from the New Year's (into 2012) show. Honestly I've never spun it, it sits as a memory for me of an awesome show.  Do what you want. As for value, most editions do hike up to ~100 a vinyl, but nothing out right now. The reason you see those vinyls for such a price is they have varying colors and editions that were only pressed so many times."
brandnew,3d8vnj,Skatinbrad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"I've seen first press Deja Entendu vinyls in unopened condition go for up to $500 on ebay. Second pressing reaches $200 pretty regularly. The Record Store Day (RSD) pressing is fairly expensive too. Earlier this year my girlfriend and I went to a festival that BN was playing. She was helped backstage after the show by a security guard and got her first press autographed by the band. We got TDAGARIM autographed at another show as well.  Edit: Pics for fun: https://i.imgur.com/kDlmRK7.jpg https://i.imgur.com/NF0Gmik.jpg  As far as the Urban Outfitters copy, it isn't a limited copy and should be more widely available as time goes on. You will be able to get it for cheaper once the supply catches up with the demand a bit more."
brandnew,3d8vnj,fatherofcajun,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:14 2015 UTC,That's awrsome.
brandnew,3d8vnj,benjamincarter2113,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing with the most recent press of Deja. It's retail value is like $28. Because this unlimited pressing is slowly coming out in waves, it seems more limited and UO and other major retailers (and eBayers) are selling it for substantially more. It's disgusting. Just hang on and you'll be able to get one for less than $30. Once everyone who never had the opportunity to buy a 1st or 2nd press gets one, they'll just sit on record store shelves for years. On the other hand, it's a little tougher to track down a copy of YFW or TDAG with cheap ease, but I'm sure they'll be reissued again soonish. Daisy is readily available pretty much everywhere, which is a win, because that album kicks ass."

brandnew,3d8vnj,benjamincarter2113,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"I literally bought a copy at UO two days ago for $28 and some change. Legitimate retailers aren't hiking up the price. It's the assholes on eBay who find five or six copies at UO (there were at least that many at 5th Avenue in Manhattan), and try to sell them for $60+."

brandnew,3d8vnj,MileHighDabbers420,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:47:24 2015 UTC,"Here's a little guide you can use:  YFW:  First edition with white cover + chess pieces generally goes for $300+. It's incredibly rare. Probably more so than the first edition Deja presses.  The current reissue is a bit difficult to find from a legitimate retailer, but it pops up every now and then. It has the cover of a guy passed out on a overpass (ha) and some early demos and bonus tracks, I believe (I don't own this one). It goes for $50+ on eBay, but don't pay that. It will be pressed again and probably rather soon. Brand New don't seem to be letting their stuff become too inaccessible to fans these days, which is good for our wallets.   Deja:  First edition goes for exorbitant amounts and copies were going for $500+ before the reissues were released this year.   The Record Store Day release was an extremely limited pressing with some cool extras. Initially it went for $300+, but I'm seeing some for around $200 now. Don't pay that, though. The extras aren't worth it.   The second pressing is the current copy you'll find at stores such as UO. It is a bit hard to find now because keeping up with the demand is difficult. But it is not a limited pressing and copies should be available widely in the coming months. I found five or six copies at an UO in New York last week. Just look around in brick and mortars and you'll probably find it without too much effort.   TDAG:  This one wasn't pressed at release because of distributing rights over the album art. Things were cleared up around 2011 and the first pressing was released rather limitedly. There are countless variations and colors of this one and some are worth more than others. Black vinyl and white vinyl are the easiest to obtain and go anywhere from $40-100 depending on the day. I also believe there was a very limited gold pressing that was only available at shows in 2011 or so. That would definitely be worth a ridiculous amount.   TDAG goes in and out of print in a similar way to the current reissue of YFW. If you wait and pay attention, you won't break the bank buying it. Currently it's $38.60 on Amazon, but I've seen it in the $25 range and that's about what I paid for it.   Daisy:  Easily obtainable and available pretty much everywhere. It's $23.37 on Amazon right now.   Hope this helped. Getting all of the Brand New albums on vinyl is one of the most frustrating things I've done in my entire life. I've still yet to get YFW, but the other three are among the most prized possessions in my record collection."

brandnew,3d8vnj,iamtraviscd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Your Favorite Weapon gets a repress every year now it seems. Since the 10th anniversary pressing, they've been rolling out new copies annually. Wait until it goes on sale on the TCR website.   Deja is an unlimited press that just came around recently. It's coming out in waves. You'll see it in stock and out of stock a lot. Personally, I got mine for $27, but nobody should pay more than $35 for it.   D/G is the same as YFW, except they often do presses with different colors. What you should know about this is that there are two versions, really: First, the MOV (Music On Vinyl) version, which is $41 and supposedly sounds better, but has a pressing error in which almost everyone's copy skips once on ""Luca"". The other is the TCR (Triple Crown Records) version. It's $25-$30 and supposedly sounds a bit worse by comparison (but I own it and it sounds great to me) and DOES NOT have a skip on ""Luca"". Like I said, it's like YFW, so you can expect it to be in stock later this year.   Daisy is unlimited and always available. No rush."
brandnew,3d8vnj,DOMAN127,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"D/G on MOV came in variants if I'm correct. I received the clear 2xLP version. Sounds fantastic and DOESNT (!!!!) skip at Luca.   Actually, the biggest complaint I've seen about the MOV version (besides it initially retailing at $40USD) was that they placed the goddamn sticker on the cover itself as opposed to its plastic sleeve."
brandnew,3d8vnj,iamtraviscd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"So yours didn't have the Luca spot? I heard lots of complaining about it. You may have been lucky!    Side note: Aside from pricing, I specifically sought out the TCR press so I could avoid the sticker."
brandnew,3d8vnj,DOMAN127,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:31:10 2015 UTC,Smart move with the TCR copy - I didn't even really consider checking them out until after I had bought the MOV version through SRC.   Happy with the quality either way. It was a white whale for so long!

A few months ago I was in a really bad depression (work issues, recent death of a good friend, both related). I was so overwhelmed by thoughts of death and suicide. I ended up playing TDAG (at like 3am, alarm set for 6am for work). I realized if I were to just end it, I would never be able to hear this album. I know that sounds silly but I listening to that album really helped me. And still does."

brandnew,3d227w,mobinsalahari,6,Mon Jul 13 07:15:05 2015 UTC,All except devil and God. I think that album cover perfectly ties with the album.
brandnew,3d227w,ProjectXero,17,Mon Jul 13 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"exactly, however, i think they all perfectly describe thier respective albums.  YFW: chess pieces symbolizing pawns and being ""cheated on"". the whole overdramatics of high school and making choices & decisions that will shape your life to come. love is a ""game"" when your young and everyone is still just trying to figure out how to play.  Deja: astronaut symbolizing exploration of a new world/new sound. maturing and growing up and taking on new challanges and new responsibilities. leaving behind childish things and becoming the man/woman you should be. the first ones to explore new worlds are called pioneers, and deja is arguably one of the best records that defined the indie rock genre of the 2000's  TDAG: TDAG is tied for my favorite album cover of all time right alongisde In The Aeroplane Over the Sea. They both set the mood perfectly for the incredible music that's inside it. TDAG is so eerie and contradicting. You have the demons full of sadness and death and you have the little girl thats full of innocence and beauty. as you grow up you realize that the world is full of tragedy and evil that you cannot avoid. You'll lose people close you. You'll have good days and bad days, and its a part of life. this is the point in your life where you'll find out what you're made of and whether you have the strength to carry on and rise above what has crippled you.  Daisy: the fox alone in the forest at night. such a perfect example of the point in your life when you've experienced so much and been filled with so much love, and loss, and regret. the choices you've made in your life to get you to where you are are weighing upon your soul and the sheer depth and weight of that is closing in around you. you're determined to not let the forest close in around you and you will fight your way back to the light."

brandnew,3d227w,benjamincarter2113,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"I agree on some of your interpretations. I do think TDAG is a) less vague than you make it out to be. It seems pretty specific (at times) and b) has some of the most appropriate cover art ever. They are all kind of on the money. One ""caveat"" is the name deja entendu vs. the idea of being ""pioneers."" It's not that they aren't/ weren't (well really they weren't pioneers, but they were definitely expanding the genre), but it's just funny that your interpretation is that pioneers on an album that means ""already heard before.""  Overall good stuff."
brandnew,3d227w,thequietthingsthat,2,Mon Jul 13 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"I think album covers are definitely important, and Brand New is one of the best bands around when it comes to making great covers. Each one epitomizes the album's themes, sound, and mood perfectly IMO. The covers for Deja and TDAG have become iconic."
brandnew,3d227w,buriedcompass,2,Wed Jul 15 04:47:54 2015 UTC,There's something heartbreaking when you notice the houses beyond the trees on the Daisy cover.
brandnew,3d227w,hotmonsteraction,3,Wed Jul 15 06:34:00 2015 UTC,"To me, the Astronaut always invoked the feeling of distance. A person adrift in a strange, volatile and unfamiliar place. A person not suitable for their current surroundings.   The image of the Astronaut on the inside cover, has always been more impact-full to me, him walking in a green field. A person very much isolated in familiar environments."

brandnew,3d0jxt,TheDangerDaysGirl,6,Mon Jul 13 08:26:57 2015 UTC,"I also started singing Soco with my friends before we were 18.  The entire year of 18 was hectic with moving out of our parents houses and figuring out our own respective paths through our careers or college schedules so we never really had one playthrough of the song to appreciate we were 18 until....    It was about 2 hours before my favorite person to sing Brand New with was going to turn 19.  I realized that we were about to miss out on the opportunity to sing soco and drink soco on an overpass while we were both 18.  I drove to the party he was at and kidnapped him without telling him where we were going.  We went to a walking bridge over the interstate and I busted out the bottle of Southern Comfort.  We belted out the song acapella, because smart phones didn't play music yet.    I don't think anyone who is exposed to Brand New in their upper twenties will ever be able to love it as much as we did back then.  This happened over ten years ago and the only thing that could have made it better was knowing someone named Pete."
brandnew,3d0jxt,santaisemo,3,Sun Jul 12 23:56:24 2015 UTC,This is so amazing. I've always wondered if they passed the bottle back to Pete or if they passed it back to pee lol. I also played Soco over and over again on the eve of my 19th birthday. It's just crazy how much those lyrics take me back.

I remember singing Soco at midnight on my 18th birthday, and in a way, even though I'm neariny my 24th, I still feel like I'm the girl I was when I was 18. 18 was one of the most formative years of my life."

brandnew,3cwcpn,buriedcompass,3,Sat Jul 11 17:12:30 2015 UTC,You did a great job. I really wanted it to be true with the cassettes and all but you were pretty convincingly cryptic. I love it.  You talk about all these coincidences like the high school showing the Wardenclyffe documentary. Do you think you would have been able to pull it off as well without things lining up the way they did?
brandnew,3cwcpn,buriedcompass,-2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"The coincidences certainly helped further speculation,  but I don't think a lack of them would have hindered much. Part of me even thought something could actually happen at some point because of it. I'm sure BN doesn't know about this really, but it would have been insane if they actually felt compelled to play along and plant stuff. I guess part of me wanted to see if I could get some gears moving and keep conversation going, and maybe put some pressure to release anything, anyhow."

brandnew,3cvbcn,max_d_tho,2,Sat Jul 11 08:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yes! When I hear it, the guitar sound is so like... sinister and bayou. And the beat sounds like chains. Weirdly enough makes me think of slave times"
brandnew,3cvbcn,Skatinbrad,8,Sat Jul 11 10:22:52 2015 UTC,"I understand the reasoning for the not liking the song.  But give a quick look at the lyrics. I'll post them here for reference:    It's getting hard to stay up  I think I can hear God calling my name  He'll try to make my heart break  But I was told you'd call me tonight    They're calling my name  They won't slow the car down  I'm scared that I will keep it for my own  The one that is calling my name is telling come down    They're calling my name  They're calling my name  They're calling my name, calling my name    To me, though the vocal distortion throws off the ""flow/mood/feel"" of the song, after understanding the lyrics it becomes much more powerful. I think I especially respected the song for this almost-Eastern influenced guitar riff. It's very unique, the song itself is way distant from much of the album.  Personally, I appreciate deviation and creativity in the band more often than reverting back to similar music they did before. I wasn't super stoked when I heard this track in particular, but I loved this album, and after understanding its meaning I think it holds higher value than it did initially.   I guess to a degree, it ""digs"" into you. I grew to like that. The sensation of what the lyrics present are almost highlighted by how abrasive the track sounds with the vocal effect. The album is a grower (not a shower), and this track really emphasizes that fact. I guess that's just me trying whole-heartedly to defend the track."
brandnew,3cvbcn,chuckpheltnic,2,Sat Jul 11 03:40:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that the melody of the song, the guitar sound, the music in general is quite brilliant.  I do enjoy that.  The lyrics I agree are pretty powerful, but most of what Brand New puts out that is true of.  Maybe it will dig into me eventually, like I said before I generally skip it."
brandnew,3cvbcn,fezzesarecool69,3,Sat Jul 11 04:42:25 2015 UTC,easy fix to your problem...  get the album on vinyl.  no one skips tracks on vinyl. then once you're forced not to skip it a few times it'll really start to grow on you.

People were trying to talk to me and I just shunned them.  I even tried showing people and they were like, ""ok dude calm down"" and I was just fidgeting with excitement."

It was like the band did 17 songs of rage and chaos and then just had two fun upbeat cheesy songs where the crowd and Jesse were just bouncing off each other, chatting away, and having a laugh. It's a modd lifter even if not a great BN song."
brandnew,3ct2gy,shoshjort,2,Fri Jul 10 21:25:54 2015 UTC,"Plus listen to the Tigers Jaw version and you can see it's actually a well written song, just not great when BN recorded it."

brandnew,3ct2gy,MrRom92,3,Sat Jul 11 08:27:37 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. To me it just sounds like it was a record that was written by a band that was still trying to find its sound. The Devil and God and Daisy sound much more mature and well thought out. While Deja isn't my favorite I can sometimes enjoy it and it was a necessary step on to their better material. I know that's not a popular opinion but it's mine. But then again, I am an asshole and nobody likes me so what do I know."

brandnew,3cslm9,fght_off_yr_dmns,5,Fri Jul 10 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"here's the thing about the interview: it was done when the band played in Madrid, which was at the end of May. the band posted a photo of Jesse in the studio on May 20, recording Sealed to Me.    It's been over a month since both of those things, and there was a little downtime between when they came back from Europe and they started a little mini leg of touring, and now they're on another break until the end of this month.  it's possible that when the interview happened, they had finished recording some songs (maybe an EP's length), sent them off to be mixed (although I would assume they'd probably do a lot of that in house), then came back and finalized a few things on those songs.    just some thoughts on that."

I love that song (actually the first brand new song I heard back in the kazaa days...thought I was getting a dashboard confessional song).  Another song that happens to me on is Luca.

brandnew,3cp94p,TangledUpInAzul,3,Fri Jul 10 01:25:14 2015 UTC,"If you don't already, listen to Regina Spektor. Good songs to get started that are more specifically like (Fork and Knife): The Flowers, Chemo Limo, Après Mois, and Poor Little Rich Boy. Regina Spektor sings shockingly simlarly to Jesse, albeit with an undeniably more impressive range. She has some much poppier stuff (listen to Fidelity) but most of her best stuff is tragically romantic and deeply insightful. I'd recommend just starting with her album Soviet Kitsch and seeing how you feel from there. The song Us is one of my favorites."

Lyrically/thematically they have always reminded me of Brand New for some reason. The entire album- Woman- is a masterpiece. Try the song ""3 days"". Very laid back piano with lyrics akin to something Brand New- ""Oh, I'm famished. So I'll eat your minerals Like a rabid beast at a foolish feast I'll steal your breath, Like a twisted thief with a mangled glove, It's just my nature, I ruin love It's just my nature, I ruin love  Stealing kisses in those misses within beats Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets, I'm killing you..."""

brandnew,3clg5s,dmcnelly,10,Thu Jul 9 00:09:55 2015 UTC,"See, I think it's the complete opposite. I adore that album because it is completely NOT a standard emo record. The song structures and time signatures are varied, the lyrics are incredibly good, the vocals are delivered in a very honest way, and the concept of the album (the whole thing is about the suicide of a close friend) cuts very deep for many people. In the end it is just an emo record, I get that, but the songs are well written and it's the most painfully heartfelt record I've ever heard. It's overflowing with so many emotions that calling it emo really sells it short."

brandnew,3clg5s,sizeablescars,28,Thu Jul 9 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you feel about Daisy, but the way your comment sounded makes it seem like you aren't too keen on it. But I'm going to give you a very unbiased opinion on that record.  I started listening to BN after Daisy was released, so I had 4 albums to listen to. And I listened to all of them together and not one at a time. For those folks who have been with BN from the beginning, I can see how they do not like Daisy because of what that band was.  I, however, think that the sheer ideas and songwriting put that in the top 10 for me. This band has accomplished what very few bands do, and that's be diverse throughout their career. Daisy sounds nothing like anything they have ever done, which would upset some fans. But look at the album for what it is...it's a goldmine of lyrics followed by crazy, intricate ideas that actually works.  Not many bands can achieve success after their ""peak"" record. Its impossible to top TDAG for me, but Daisy has some of the best riffs, lyrics, and clever movements of any record I've ever listened to.  So yes, for me that album deserves it."
brandnew,3clg5s,G_Daddy2014,4,Thu Jul 9 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, well said. I love Daisy."
brandnew,3clg5s,braxndnew,8,Thu Jul 9 09:00:13 2015 UTC,"I know that TDAG is basically Brand New's magnum opus. Jesse even said himself that it saved the band. However, Daisy is my favourite. It's the most powerful and beautiful record I think I've ever heard. But deep down, I know TDAG is their finest work. On a wider scale Daisy will never properly be appreciated, and will probably never end up on a list like this. Hell, even a lot of BN fans 'didn't get it' and found it 'too abrasive'. Maybe those people should just stick to pop punk..."
brandnew,3clg5s,jeswork,3,Thu Jul 9 09:33:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Daisy is a very dense album, but a very great album. It's complicated, mature and interesting. It should have been on this list."

MBDTF and TDAGARIM can be both be considered the respective magnum opus and culmination of Kanye's and Brand New's previous general sonic styles. The evolution from Your Favorite Weapon to Deja Entendu to The Devil and God can be seen from elements present in each. Same for Ye's first 3 albums (808s was like an emotional exercise-cum-side project) and MBDTF.   I think it's interesting that both acts chose to follow up their respective albums by blowing everything up and creating something with a previously unseen dark dissonance with similar elements of sonic scape. Neither really produced any radio friendly singles and both projects alienated many of their respective fanbases.

But that's my opinion.  I will say Ye is way more influential as an artist, as he changed virtually an entire genre of music's direction in the mid 2000's. They both have their own accomplishments, so it's really hard to compare."
brandnew,3clg5s,wicryeker,-3,Thu Jul 9 21:48:06 2015 UTC,Kanyes lyrics are not insightful at all really but the music is incredibly emotional and insightful all on its own

brandnew,3clg5s,shmerk-a-berl,0,Thu Jul 9 01:38:04 2015 UTC,People often state that like it's fact but I don't see anything more in his music than mildly progressive generic rap. Maybe it's good for generic radio rap but I don't like that in the first place. He isn't some sort of rap genius just the best of the most popular.
brandnew,3clg5s,Infamaniac23,6,Wed Jul 8 23:22:59 2015 UTC,Because MBDTF and Yeezus are super generic.
brandnew,3clg5s,shmerk-a-berl,-2,Thu Jul 9 00:57:48 2015 UTC,I would say they are slightly more interesting than your run of the mill generic rap album. That doesn't make him a musical genius.
brandnew,3clg5s,Infamaniac23,2,Thu Jul 9 01:08:14 2015 UTC,Have you listened to them?
brandnew,3clg5s,shmerk-a-berl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:30:00 2015 UTC,Yes actually. Cool production quality but in my opinion they're not as revolutionary as people make them out to be. Especially Yeezus.
brandnew,3clg5s,wicryeker,2,Thu Jul 9 11:21:00 2015 UTC,"Hm. I kinda think yeezus and daisy are very similar. Both really dark and trippy and coming right after their ""huge"" albums. I dunno,  i get a lot out of it"
brandnew,3clg5s,Infamaniac23,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:30:16 2015 UTC,I never actually thought of Yeezus that way. I'm not the biggest fan of Yeezus but I guess I'll give it another shot tonight.

brandnew,3clg5s,Infamaniac23,2,Thu Jul 9 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"It's ok not to like them but it's far from a generic rap album. Like for example it sounds nothing like Big Sean or Kid Ink or Wiz Khalifa. The choice of samples alone separate Kanye from the rest of the mainstream crowd. I mean King Crimson, Aphex Twin. I really don't see how you can say it's run of the mil generic mainstream rap especially on Yeezus. Yeezus basically sounds like a less noisy and more accessible Death Grips."
brandnew,3clg5s,Chrisgomez182,2,Thu Jul 9 11:55:47 2015 UTC,"how is it generic and progressive? The dude produces his albums fully. Not to mention that he ghost wrote for Jay Z for a while. The reason why people think brand new is so great is how relatable they are, and how some people's live were ""saved."" It's all personal bias, of course some people with more emotional attachment to an album is going to think it's better than an album from a genre they don't really care about."
brandnew,3clg5s,shmerk-a-berl,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:39:23 2015 UTC,I'm saying he is slowly progressing the modern rap style which has already been progressed 100 times over by more talented and experimental artists. Kanye is just the most well known but that doesn't make him a musical genius.  Also not sure you can tell me the reason everyone (and certainly not me) thinks Brand New is great when it's completely subjective.
brandnew,3clg5s,Chrisgomez182,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:57:34 2015 UTC,Who are the artists that more talented than Kanye in rap?  The general consensus of this sub has emotional attachment to one of brand new's albums. You can see it in almost every thread.

brandnew,3clg5s,Skatinbrad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:10:52 2015 UTC,"To lay it out, the guy popped up and changed the direction of the genre. I'm not being overly dramatic, I'm trying to explain why the connection to Kanye is so strong. Objectively, he influenced not only hip-hop (soul samples and clean production when everything was G-G-G-G-G-G-UNIT! and club/dirty grind that booty music).   Not to mention, he made polo t's (and a backpack) as well as those ""shader"" (name?) sunglasses trendy. He changed music and influenced clothing trends. He made it ""cool"" to dress well and to make clean samples.  If you look at his rep, he produced for Jay-Z well before he came out as a rapper. He's intensely critical of himself for the sake of production, and it shows, because almost all of his catalog is decent at the very worst, for the sake of production.  Then you have albums, such as Dark Twisted Fantasy, which highlights maximalism and gripping an ""epic"" and huge sound in a rap album. Shit tons of instruments, a really big sound. Yeezus was dark, almost jungle/tribal like and really stands as an ""experimental rap"" album to a certain degree.  Like him or hate him, the guy has done more to hip-hop than most rappers have the past 15 years."

If it dies tonight Save it all for us Remember that our eyes contain the secret But your body won't feel a thing  And if it goes We can let it go   Leave me alone with my thoughts I hear them better at night Your feelings turn in to rust While my silence speaks all my lies  And if it does tonight We'll claim this all for us This silence has broken a year of waiting But your touch is hard to bare  And if it goes We can let it go   Leave me alone with my thoughts I hear them better at night This house seems dead Falling out Your feelings turn in to rust  While my silence speaks all my lies  This house seems dead Falling out Leave me alone with my thoughts I hear them better at night Your eyes turn red It's colder now Your feelings turn in to rust My silence speaks all my lies

brandnew,3c99cz,RickFast,7,Mon Jul 6 17:15:41 2015 UTC,"I just wanna say something,  I get that OPs title might just be a joke but some people may see this as a serious deal breaker. In fact the top comment as of now is someone saying they never want to date or marry someone that doesn't like Brand New because of one bad experience. You don't have to share every small detail with your spouse. In fact it's best if you don't. I wouldn't want to marry someone exactly like me, I'm lame. Plus when you see that you don't have that common ground, you get the exciting adventure of introducing that person to that thing. I've done this with my current girlfriend. She didn't like Brand New or basketball before I met her, two things in an obsessive geek and knower of all things. She can talk my head off on make up but I can do the same with brand new or basketball. It's fun to bring something your passionate about to someone you're passionate about"
brandnew,3c99cz,Smellmyhand,10,Mon Jul 6 17:59:06 2015 UTC,Yes. My title was very much a joke.
brandnew,3c99cz,japr,2,Mon Jul 6 18:12:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, you're basically just saying ""no two people will ever 100% share all the same likes and that's a good thing,"" which is just common sense because no two people are the same. However, sometimes people consider certain pieces of art so important to them that they want their partner to be able to share that interest to at least some degree.  My favorite band of all time is a Japanese group called the pillows.  I would not have met my wife were it not for the fact that she likes them as well (although not as much as I do, hehe), among many other shared favorites.  She got me into Brand New several years back while we were still dating, and now they're a band on the same tier of importance to me as the pillows are, and it's a thing we share together now.  Having something be so important to you that you want that shared love to be there from the start is not at all the same thing as an insane and unrealistic desire to share 100% of the same interests.  It's just different strokes for different folks."

""Jesus Christ, I'm alone again, So, what did you do those three days you were dead? Cause this problems gonna last  More than the weekend.""

brandnew,3c99cz,joyousbrokenthing,14,Wed Jul 8 06:58:29 2015 UTC,I was going through a really rough depression 5 years ago and would listen to At The Bottom on repeat. My boyfriend at the time who I thought I would marry hated Brand New and blamed them for enabling my depressive state. He threw my copy Daisy out the window on a drive. Needless to say we're no longer. And shallow as it sounds I don't think I could ever date someone who doesn't love Brand New. Sometimes I still wonder how right he was though when I'm having a rough day and still letting Jesse Lacey make me cry.

brandnew,3c99cz,QuiGonJovi,19,Mon Jul 6 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Fuck that. Music helps depression, it doesn't enable it.

Even if it's by a guy who I'll never meet singing about things that are completely unconnected to me.   Fuck I love this band."

brandnew,3c99cz,wicryeker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:49:52 2015 UTC,"im going to chime in here.  First, in regards to the original post of this submission, just because someone doesn't get a lyrical reference to a somewhat obscure band doesn't make them any less compatible for you lol.  Secondly, I agree, MUSIC is incredibly broad and tastes vary greatly.  Whats important, in a relationship aspect in my opinion, is to at LEAST have an open mind about different styles and types of music.  My wife listens to my music all the time, like when I find a new band (that in all honesty isn't the best), she has to suffer through that phase of my life until it gets out of my system.  But we also discover and share new music together all the time, it's one of our many similar/dissimilar interests.  DONT CALL PEOPLE JACKASSBURGERS ITS NOT NICE YOU PIECE OF ROTTING CUNT FLESH.  :)  that is all."
brandnew,3c99cz,japr,0,Mon Jul 6 15:13:52 2015 UTC,"See, YOU'RE not getting the point I was making here, either.  To some people, sharing a certain amount of musical taste, rather than just being able to tolerate each other's musical taste, is of top importance.  Not everyone has to form their relationships in the same way that you do, nor do they have to prioritize various things in the same way.  That is all.  Edit: lol downvotes.

YFW: ""But I got a plan"" and the chorus in Jude Law  Deja: Guitar solo and just instrumentation in general in Good to Know if I Ever Need Attention (sounds similar to Hotel California's solo to me)  TDAG: Either the guitar and drums kicking into ""the signal interrupted.."" on Limousine, or basically all of Welcome to Bangkok   Daisy: Revving guitars on You Stole (I'm actually currently working on a video edit to this song. I could share it once it's done if anyone's interested)"

brandnew,3c40if,cocacolatriplesix,2,Mon Jul 6 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"Vin said at one point that he was listening to The Eagles and had pretty much ""accidentally"" copied it. I don't really like the rest of the song, either, but that part specifically is sort of a low for the band"
brandnew,3c40if,SolidJake110,2,Mon Jul 6 03:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, & that's totally fine.  The chorus is damn good, so I don't hate the song or anything.  It's just a moment that pulls me out of Deja."
brandnew,3c40if,cocacolatriplesix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:44:13 2015 UTC,"Aw really? I think that's one of their best instrumental breakdowns. It doesn't sound like a total ripoff to me, I just notice the similarity. I love the rhythm guitar and drums that back the solo. It makes the track hit so much harder, and the drums leading back into the chorus is perfect to me. Really underrated track in my opinion."
brandnew,3c40if,CakeLyrics,3,Mon Jul 6 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"You're totally right!  The rhythm guitar & drums are awesome there.  Hell, at around the 6 minute mark it kind of sounds like something out of a song by Thursday.  See, it all starts out great, & then Vin slips into the arpeggiated chords, which is the unintentional callback to Hotel Cali, & that's where it loses me.  The bent note at 04:07 = excellent.  Vin's lead during the chorus = excellent.  It's a fine song, for sure, but it feels a little inauthentic when taken in context with the rest of the record.  It's got too much scope & not enough focus, I think.  I remember reading a lot about the band around when Deja was coming out & there was some article written by a reviewer who mentioned seeing BN live.  Between songs, Vin was sitting off the edge of the stage, playing bits of Modest Mouse songs.  The interviewer pointed to that as a symbol of BN outgrowing their pop punk beginnings.  I agree that this was a big moment for the band, where they were playing with the kind of expansive songwriting they would eventually master on ""Limousine.""  Unfortunately, I don't think they quite had it figured out yet.  This one's a swing & a miss, for me."
brandnew,3c40if,cocacolatriplesix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:53:53 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. I guess I'm usually just a fan of appropriation in music/art in general. Maybe it's my love for hip-hop, or my appreciation for collage/mixed media artwork. I dunno, I just usually seem to appreciate an artist for paying homage and building on top of a previous piece of work. Sometimes it even makes it better for me (shit Taking Back Sunday's Slow Dance on the Inside is probably one of my favorite songs of theirs).  I always find it entertaining when something like a line, phrase, or even a cover of a song gives new perspective on another artist's work. I really like when these guys let their influences bleed through (Like the Smith's, Archer's of Loaf, in this case The Eagles, and even the gospel samples used throughout Daisy). In fact, the samples used in Daisy really helps make it my favorite record of theirs. I hope they continue doing it in future projects."

brandnew,3byij3,AutoAlligator,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:53:57 2015 UTC,They don't have guitars specifically for the drop tunings. They just drop whichever guitar from either standard or half-step down.

brandnew,3byij3,staythepath,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Dude, read my comment and watch the video. You will clearly see that they do not have guitars specifically for drop D and drop C#. If they need to play a song in drop D either they or their guitar tech will tune the E standard guitar down. If they need to play in drop C# they'll drop tune the E flat guitar.  ""Drop tuning"" refers to dropping the low string a whole step. Maybe that's your source of confusion."

Don't get me wrong, I love both songs but Soco is obviously a more  singalong tune and I believe that maybe Jesse likes to have all the audience screaming their hearts out singing the song along with him... I get goosebumps just by watching the videos of this song and hearing all those souls singing the chorus...  Just a thought I wanted to share."

brandnew,3bu0ys,casinothunderball,5,Thu Jul 2 03:40:04 2015 UTC,Fantastic time at Summerfest tonight. My fiance and I were to the right of the stage so we spent a lot of time watching the Jumbotron. Was I crazy or was there a cryptic backwards message that flashed on the screen behind the band that said Album 5 Coming Soon? It was a song or 2 before Mixtape in the middle of the set.
brandnew,3bu0ys,smnSteve,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:16:11 2015 UTC,I didn't happen to see anything. They switched between camera angles and styles so fast.
brandnew,3bu0ys,thehookwink,4,Thu Jul 2 06:16:38 2015 UTC,Always fun to see Brand New..but wow Jesse sounded hoarse tonight. Maybe he needs a night off....
brandnew,3bu0ys,CityScapeSkin,2,Thu Jul 2 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"I thought they really mailed it in last year, but this year was much better. The setlist was better, and they seemed more engaged.  It's still Summerfest so you still have to put up with the horrible sight lines, only decent sound, and obnoxious people at the Miller Lite Oasis."
brandnew,3bu0ys,icanarejesus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"Summerfest was a fucking disappointment. Why the fuck did they have bleachers there? It was impossible to get even a glimpse of the stage, and since everyone was standing on the bleachers, all sounds other than bass tones were completely absorbed by the crowd. I've seen Brand New 3 times now and I honestly wish I could get my money back for Summerfest."
brandnew,3bu0ys,CityScapeSkin,2,Thu Jul 2 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's Summerfest. Think how nuts the crowd would be if they didn't have the bleachers. They'd have to spend a fortune on staffing to control the crowd. That's why they do it. It really sucks, but that's the way it is."
brandnew,3bu0ys,devil_girl_from_mars,2,Thu Jul 2 19:51:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've seen them a ton of times and this was the worst. It wasn't the band, it was the entire atmosphere. The bleachers sucked (apparently some kid fell backwards and hit his head?) and I've never been to one of their performances where so many people were honestly really shitty. Usually every show I've been to, everyone has high spirits and they're excited and they're happily sharing their love for the band with one another. Not here. In the area I was at, there were a lot of people fighting with each other and just being douchebags in general. We moved around to get away from that but everywhere we went, it seemed like 90% of the people were one wrong move away from killing each other, which is a fucking drag. The sound was terrible (vocals weren't nearly as loud throughout a lot of their songs) and the motorcycles/surrounding stages ruined whatever you could hear. Maybe I'm just getting older, but it was seriously terrible. Obviously this wouldn't stop me from seeing them in the future because I know they're incredible live and this was definitely not their fault but you couldn't pay me to go to summerfest again. Total disappointment."
brandnew,3bu0ys,John_Lives,2,Thu Jul 2 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"I won't say I had a great experience, but I definitely didn't have any issue with the crowd. Must have been in a nice bubble I guess"

brandnew,3bu0ys,icanarejesus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad I'm not the only person that hated it! On top of all that, a good chunk of the people in the crowd literally had no idea who Brand New was, they just wanted to be in the crowd so they could smoke weed and do other drugs without people seeing. I know this because I talked to some of them and I'd say 5/7 people I talked to were like, ""Yeah, I don't even know who this band is,"" while smoking.  Nothing wrong with getting high or whatever, but don't take up space that an actual fan could be in."
brandnew,3bu0ys,devil_girl_from_mars,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I agree! If you're just there to listen to good music and get high, at least move to the back or the sides of the crowd? That might be a good explanation for why there were soo many people talking during their set. Seriously, towards the end we were searching for a spot where it looked like there were a lot of people singing along just so we could hopefully hear a decent sounding song without it being drowned out by everyone elses conversations. We came out from Chicago and I brought one of my closest friends so she could see them for the first time and I was seriously bummed. Had to buy myself a beer and i HATE beer.

An air of entitlement (which anyone would have if they made that much money by 21), but, other wise, seemingly good kids. It's blatantly apparent they were only put together to succeed/make money; no chance their music is a reflection of them.  Fun fact: Ed Sheeran wrote most of their first two albums before he blew up.   I had a good chuckle when they played a cover of ""Teenage Dirtbag"" by Wheatus at their MSG show. The song was older than 3/4 of the audience, and nobody knew what was happening."

This is speculation from a group of us on AP previously unmentioned. So I'm bringing it up in case people are interested or already going. Likelihood is nothing happens. But Jesse confirmed in the interview the cassettes are a thing. It seems like something may be happening, something may also not be. It's worth a check out and being involved in. The sub has trailed off. I got so involved with this sub a few months back but now it seems like any new speculation or discussion is met with downvotes and hate. The obvious trolls (pogolithlocate-looking at you) deserve it but a lot of people like me are genuinely discussing things that might be relevant.

If anything, reading this interview I feel more optimistic for a future for the band than say around when Daisy came out and all they were saying was ""this is the last BN record ever.""   They made it clear that they love making music and playing shows but they are also very involved in their own lives. While for some reason it always seems like BN is a reclusive and inactive band, putting things in perspective 15 years is a long time for a band to stay together, tour relentlessly, have very few (one?) lineup changes, put out four amazing albums, and have another one in the works. I'm as big a BN fan as anyone else here but I could never wish the band detracts from their own lives for fans. I think we'll be seeing for a long time into the future, but they aren't going to have any problem taking their time to come out of the woodwork."

I'm proud to    be a husband, a dad/parent and other things of that nature. People     think that I'm a musician, but I'm not, even though I dedicate a lot     of time to it. If I thought about myself the way that the fans     thought about me, it would be a disaster. I always want to think of    myself as the person who I am at home with my wife or with my     son/child and be that person.  At a recent show in Manchester he told the crowd (this is sourced  from a Gig Review on http://www.mancunianmatters.co.uk by Zoe  Johnson):    ""Ever-humble despite his status as nothing short of divine, Lacey     quipped that it was 'nerve-racking' playing a room so small, before    paying a touching homage to his wife and stepson and showing his     appreciation to all of the band’s devoted fans.  I see people on here and elsewhere explain that him referring to  himself as a Dad/Father is a reference to his dogs.  A ""dog-father"", if  you will.  This is an idea that has been created by fans I'm sure by  looking at his wife's instagram (she often posts pictures of their dogs). Speaking of which, it clearly says Mama on her instagram and  Father on his personal (private) instagram.  I'm not sure how they can  be anymore clear, there is obviously a child involved who they have  decided to keep out of the public eye.  As a huge fan of the band, of course I would like to know more about Jesse.  And even his family. It's a curiosity that comes with being a fan of someone.  But also as a fan I want to respect him and his privacy.  What he chooses to share with us, is what we get.    But this whole, Father of Dogs thing, should just stop."
brandnew,3bm5dn,sizeablescars,2,Tue Jun 30 19:21:49 2015 UTC,I can't link to her instagram cuz the mods would decapitate me but Jesse's wife has stated the dad/mom thing is referring to their dogs. Unless she's lying to keep their child a secret it's about their dogs. I would hazard a guess that the stepson thing is a godson or one of the bandmates sons or one of the crew's sons.
brandnew,3bm5dn,_jesslacey,2,Tue Jun 30 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why you would say that she has stated the dad/mom thing is referring to their dogs?    When she reposted the BN photo when Ireland legalized gay marriage, she said, ""I could not have a better husband/father/partner and I look forward to the day where everyone can love the one they love.""  Someone commented saying, ""father?"" and then a 2nd person commented saying she was referring to her dogs (that comment has since been deleted, I assume because his wife pointed out that she was wrong).  But his wife responded with, ""guys I love my dogs but they're dogs, not kids""  Was there somewhere else that she said otherwise?  Also, it's very odd Jesse would use the word, son & stepson if he was referring to his dogs...  Of course this is all speculation unless until someone asks them directly.  Although, I think the RockZone interview is a pretty solid answer to the question."
brandnew,3bm5dn,sizeablescars,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:58:12 2015 UTC,I've only seen that pic you mentioned. My guess is that stepson was misquoted. The lacey couple spend a lot of time on the road together though and I figure someone would notice a child walking around. Also her insta has no mention or glimpse of a child.
brandnew,3bm5dn,_jesslacey,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"I could POSSIBLY understand the magazine translation being incorrect but I don't think HE would have misspoke.  You can read in several places online (google: manchester gorilla gig reviews) about the show in Manchester, where he payed homage to his wife and stepson, even here on reddit someone wrote:    ""Then the craziness just ensued for another hour, after which Jesse     spoke about what it was like being famous, what it was like to do an     intimate tour and how he felt so much better for having his wife     and stepson now. He explained why Soco was back on the setlist     (his anthem to the naivety of youth (asking the crowd how to say     naivety I hasten to add)."" -posted by highkingnm last month I'm not surprised at all that she keeps her child off of instagram, with the way that Brand New super fans (myself included) pick apart everything that gets put on there.  And as far as no one noticing a child with them, I imagine the people close to them are conscientious of their privacy.    There's really no way for confirmation on this unless one of them says something, which I think we both know is highly unlikely.  I was just surprised when you had said, she stated the dad/mom thing is referring to their dogs."

brandnew,3boi22,Tbern05,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:03:30 2015 UTC,Some people will still re-sell them. It's inevitable. There is such a rabid fan base for this band that anything they release is worth money. There will be fans out there that sell theirs and other fans that buy them just so they have 2 copies. I like your idea (mostly cause I'm guaranteed to get one if they do that) but I don't think it will prevent people from re-selling.
brandnew,3boi22,ohheyashleyyy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:27:27 2015 UTC,"I know it won't prevent people from reselling 100% but I feel like that way would make more sense. I would want to make sure that random scalpers can't get them just to resell like we saw with RSD Deja and whenever tickets go on sale pretty much. But yes, I'd get one if they did it this way too, as would a bunch of others in /r/brandnew I'd imagine :)"
brandnew,3boi22,Tbern05,2,Wed Jul 1 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this ever since they released Mene, and I don't expect them to just send them out like the lyric books, but all they'd really have to do is send us an email and tell us to give them money for it, or even have us enter into a lottery (if they are gonna be limited) As long as I have a chance to get one, I'd be happy.

Also, the reggae version that Vin started was kind of cool."
brandnew,3blm1v,MisterMescudi,26,Tue Jun 30 05:49:03 2015 UTC,I'm trying to hear how clapping along to the beat of You Stole would make sense in any context and I can't figure it out.

brandnew,3blm1v,FriendlyBeard,-4,Wed Jul 1 19:27:16 2015 UTC,Can we get them to stop people singing along too?  Trying to hear them perform the songs over hundreds of tone-deaf fans singing out of time is infuriating.  Happened at all of the 5 shows I've seen them at.

brandnew,3blm1v,sizeablescars,5,Tue Jun 30 22:03:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe the quiet of the quiet songs. But even BN slow songs have moments like ""We've all got wood and nails"" or ""You're just jealous cause we're young and in love"" that I have loved hearing carried by a huge, unified crowd."

Meh. If you wanna hear them over the crowd, get up front or get near a speaker."
brandnew,3blm1v,wallawalla_wallaby,2,Tue Jun 30 15:59:50 2015 UTC,It's not really louder up front. A band like Brand New is playing at venues with good enough acoustics and can hire a solid sound guy.

brandnew,3blm1v,NationalPhenomenon,7,Tue Jun 30 11:30:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was just where I was in the arena, but I thought the crowd was terrible. I moved around several times to try to avoid people just continually talking though the songs, or messing with their phones. I've seen Brand New live 7 times now, and I thought overall this crowd just didn't seem very into it, which was a bummer. Anyone else get this vibe?"
brandnew,3blm1v,lowercaselaurel,3,Tue Jun 30 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"It was very mellow up front, even with the barrage of surfers. Definitely one of the tamest experiences I've had. It's not surprising to hear that lots of people were on their phones. That seems to be the rule rather than the exception anymore at every concert I see.  I only felt embarrassed that the arena looked as empty as it was since they just had two sold out shows in KC and Des Moines.  Granted, those two shows may have impacted ticket sales. However, I would think anyone within 3 hours of Omaha would've jumped at the opportunity to see them again if they went to one of those. I remember there being a number of people complaining that they couldn't get tickets to the KC show, too. Furthermore, this marked the band's first show in Nebraska, and the closest they've been to Omaha since 2006.  I don't think it helped that it was poorly promoted and on a Monday, either. It seemed like the arena and promoters assumed that because most of Brand New's other shows sell out with little to no promotion that the same would happen here. Not the case at all. They're never played on our sole ""alternative"" radio station, they've never played here (as previously noted), and unless you follow the band, there was little chance you even knew they had a show here up until the last week when the promoters FINALLY began promoting the show via traditional means. This should've easily sold out.  I respect the hell out of 1% Productions, but they dropped the ball here. I'm glad that they were finally able to book the band. But sadly, I feel like this will be the last time they play here."
brandnew,3blm1v,VaughnJess,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:57:53 2015 UTC,"Okay a lot of this makes sense. I don't live in the area (I live in Kansas) and drove up for the show, so I didn't know what the vibe had been like there leading up to it. I think all those factors you listed make a lot of sense based on the experience.  After being at the sold out KC show and seeing the atmosphere there, and then comparing it to last night, it does feel like a bit of a let down. You can tell when the crowd is more into it that the band feeds off that energy and vice versa. If someone saw Brand New last night for the first time, you would think they were good live, but really wouldn't have experienced what they're fully capable of. But.. that's part of going to shows and seeing bands live. You never know.  I really do hope they come back to the midwest, but you're right, with as empty as it was, it doesn't look good for Omaha."
brandnew,3blm1v,stealballz,5,Tue Jun 30 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"This happened when I saw them a few years ago. Vin was playing the intro to Untitled solo (I think) and he had to stop because the clapping put him off. Proud non-clapper here, too, so I was pretty happy when he told everyone off."

brandnew,3blm1v,supercommander,2,Tue Jun 30 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"They seemed to be in a particular good mood. The sound was GREAT up front. I could hear everything very clearly from where I was between Vin and Jesse. Might've been the clearest sound I've heard at any of the 20 shows I've seen.  There was a scary moment during YWK where Jesse tried jumping up on a monitor, then ended up slipping and falling. This wound up knocking the monitor off the stage and down the back of a security guard. It was like watching a car crash in slow motion. Fortunately, it only grazed him and he was pretty cool about it.  I thought for sure that would sour the mood from that point forward. Luckily, the band remained in good spirits and continued going off for the entirety of the show. Albeit, no more jumping on monitors.  The impromptu ""reggae"" version of You Stole had me rolling, especially with Jesse scatting. A priceless memory for those that were in attendance."

In fact, these songs are older than those we have written now. Probably we started working on them during the time of The Devil and God, and recently we agreed and we started to sound again. Now we liked to ten years does not. I think they have more melody that the last thing we did. When you listen to believe you can sing it and follow it quickly. That's what I could say about the new music we have. For example, in Daisy you may notice that the melodies are more complicated. I do not want to make music I get tired of hearing, and I think that's what we tried for this new job. We do not want to bore people, so to speak, we tried to go back to that moment of our music where it was easier for us to understand, but treating it with maturity after so long.

The thing is that it is not ready, so to speak. Hopefully it out this year, at least that is our aim. We do not know whether it will be an EP of seven songs or so, or the traditional LP of 14 songs. We have many songs that we've been working, but hey, I guess sometimes you have to face what you have steeping a little, as I said before. Is something that we have to adapt, one day seems that we will get and the next we were a little farther out.  finally, 2018 is a year to put an end to intuit Brand New and left this post? who knows? ...

brandnew,3bhrn7,cracked6,14,Mon Jun 29 09:28:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's what i can translate using my best english haha  First page:   Today is an special day, your first concert in Spain. How you feel about what you've seen until now? Had you ever come before? Yes, exactly. I've never come before. Just came here with my wife two day ago so we could visit the city, even take some beers while we look the ambient. We've enjoyed a lot these days. We come from a small place in Long Island wich we haven't left until the Europe Tour started, and this city in concret, i find it so vibrant, vivid and diferent. Like many others we've been, but with the difference that here the people looks happier. You look more quiet and relaxed, or at least that's what i've seen these days. (Don't know how to translate that last question, sorry)  Well, i guess like in every big city (laughs) It's just, what i've seen these days, the people here seems to be happy and cheerful in every moment. I even felt happier. In New York for example, people lives stressed. Everything goes really fast; they live anxious to get what they want as fast as they can. But it's also a big city thanks to their hard work and dedication.  I understand what you're trying to say, i'm from a small town too. Kevin Devine also said that he loved this city, i guess that he told you good thinks Yeah, he did, and he was right. The parks are beautiful, the weather is great... Dude, i'm serious, i want to move here! (laughs)  You will be really welcome Thanks (laughs) The truth is, with all the people that i've seen here that likes our band, maybe i can make my live here (laughs)  That's what i was gonna as you about, did you saw the line outside?People seems to have respond really well to your visit Yeah. I have to say that we haven't come a lot to Europe, and when we play in different places like United States or UK, we feel every place in a different way. For example, today, wich is the first concert we play here, like any other city we haven't gone, we try to face it in a different way, because it's like it were a new show every day. Think that we have 15 years now as a band, and for example, in LA we've played like 50 or 60 times, so a lot of people have already seen us at least one time, and of course, come here and know that no one or almost no one has seen us and they can do it now, makes it special."

In your last interview for this magazine six years ago, we said you would like to pick those songs in the future. Yes, well, that has come as a matter of having spent so long. How do I explain ... Those songs were like an abandoned child, but when we saw that people listened helped to rescue them after having taken more affection over time. I have to tell you that for me some of those songs are among the best I've ever written, and although previously thought that had to do with the identity of our band now I think so they have it, so we wanted to give them the importance they deserved . So even if we take them in that format.  (Edit, next question is a follow up)  can you tell us something about how will those issues where you have worked? well, actually it's hard to talk about it right now, because even in songs that are far from over we have to see if everyone likes, and when I say everyone, I mean those who are involved in the creative process."

brandnew,3bhrn7,kawhisenberg,6,Mon Jun 29 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"EDIT: the first half of the interview can be found in this comment.   Pg 54-end here and in reply  Pg. 54 Quote on picture: ""Being a musician is my dream life, but we also want to preserve  our humanity in all of this- highlighting what it is to be humble and modest because there's been other moments in my life when I haven't done that.""- Jesse Lacey  In addition, it seems that everything is going good.  Yes it is, that's what we intend to do. We always try to give our all in everything that we do. When I have a concert and feel that my voice sounded good, or when something surprises me or I've had a good session in the studio, I go home feeling satisfied just like any other person who works and puts all of their effort into whatever they do. It's like I've won/earned everything that I have. If I ever feel that I haven't put 100% into what I've done, I won't be able to feel as though I'm a part of it. I can speak for the rest of my band mates and they all want the same thing, they want to earn it.   How do the rest of the guys feel right now in regards to the band? Do they want to keep playing and ____ like before? We've always had that question floating around us: how long will we continue playing? We wake up every morning and we ask ourselves, ""what's up? How are you feeling today? Do you feel inspired?"" We talk amongst ourselves about an array of things and we're always concerned about how all of us are doing.  Do you feel inspired? From what we've seen so far, you have some new themes...  Yes, I feel inspired but that doesn't mean that I can inspire the rest of the group. For example, I can have one or twenty songs or ideas that I can show to the rest of the guys but they might not like any of them. And I can understand that, sometimes it's been my fault that some songs haven't come to fruition. Other times, we agree on seven, four, or one of the ideas and we immediately begin working on them. Like I told you before, we put our family and friends first and the band comes second, What we don't have is the need to create music together in order to create good relationships amongst ourselves- making music is a job to which we've dedicated time. Sometimes it's hard, we'll get together but we won't feel inspired to create new music, or work on a song, or show/teach the others an idea we have. But those times serve as a reminder that we have work to do and it's our responsibility to do it. It can be that sometimes we don't have to feel inspired and take time to reflect on things in order to get back to finding inspiration. Lots of bands who have been in the situation as us can tell you similar things.   I suppose that not having much pressure has benefited you while working on new music. Pressure comes from us. We especially feel it in the people who have followed us throughout our career, we've had the necessary freedom to do something that we feel satisfied with and those who accept the way that we are is something else that we have to be grateful for. We are the way that we are and the people respect that; even with all the time that has passed they keep coming to every concert...it's really incredible.   That's what I was trying to say about the support of your fans. I've always thought that ignorance about your band and not knowing what's going to happen at any moment creates more expectations.  The reality is that we don't even know what's going to happen next.   Pg. 55   Have you seen the series LOST?  I have, I hope our band doesn't end like that. laughs  Every ending is a bad thing, but I don't know, it seems that sometimes the less information you give, the more you hook the audience. As you know, they would play with the audience a little bit more and more and only released the information that they wanted to. It was impossible to know what was going to happen next.  Exactly, you never knew what was going to happen next. I get what you're trying to say. I was very invested in that series and the stories of each character- I liked it a lot and it was an incredible adventure. I don't know if I've already told you this, but the mystery that surrounds our band and the respect that the fans have for us, sometimes that includes us. Sometimes we ask ourselves about new things that haven't happened yet and sometimes we include our listeners in that. Sometimes we say, ""look at this foolish/dumb thing that has happened to me"" and that can turn into something else or it's just simply something we want to share with our listeners. I think it's something that shows that we're real people.   A while back you talked about new forms of communication with the public. In fact, you've announced that you're going to release music on cassettes and the infamous leaked demos from 10 years ago through limited supply. While it may sound a bit hipster, it's something different.  laughs Yes, for sure. I grew up listening to cassette tapes and I saw the change from tapes over to CDs, the idea behind it is more than being trendy, is to have a physical connection to our music. Things like this, our CDs, the release of vinyl or our library of music- we've come to find that we shouldn't just dedicate/concentrate on the digital format that has taken over the world of listening to music today. Personally, I feel more attached to something physical more than something that I see on a screen or hear but can't touch. I remember the feeling of sharing a CD, being able to open the lyric booklet and explore the design with my hands, following along and flipping the pages. I can also say that we haven't discovered everything there is about the digital world, maybe we haven't used it efficiently, and that's fascinating. I think that the tapes are going to be released soon and I think something released in such a (limited) format is something that's attractive to the public. It's not going to be possible to copy the cassettes an infinite amount of times the way you'd be able to copy other forms of release, since the quality would deteriorate with every copy.   Speaking of digital formats, I have to ask if you're aware of an Instagram account that has been spreading rumors about a new album throughout the past few months.  Pg.56  Yes, I do, I have no problem with talking to you about this. You're the first person that I've had an interview with in quite some time. We have a new album to release; that's not a secret. The thing is that it isn't finished yet, we hope to release it this year, at least that's our goal. We don't know if it'll be an EP with 7 songs or a traditional LP with 14 songs. We have quite a few songs that we're working on at the moment but sometimes I think that you have to look at what you have and let it sit a while. It's something that we have to adapt to, one day we feel ready to release it and the next day we feel like we need more time before its release.   You've been playing some of those demos that we were talking about earlier. In your last interview with us, 6 years ago, you said that you'd like to re-record those songs in the future.  Yes, that has come as a natural reaction since so much time has passed. How do I explain it...those songs were like an abandoned child, but when we saw that the people listened to them it helped us to rescue them and approach them with more happiness as time went on. I have to say that, to me, some of those songs are the best that I've ever written and I used to think that they had nothing to do with our identity as a band but they do. Because of that we want to give them the respect they deserve, because of that we want to release them even if it's iin that form (cassette tape).   Can you tell us a little bit about the themes that you've worked on/written about?  The truth is that they're hard to speak about at the moment because there's some songs that are far from being complete. We have to see if we like all of them, and when I say that I mean any song that we're involved in the creative process with right now.   At the very least, can you say anything about Mene, which is the only song other than Sealed to Me that you have released at the moment and have been playing at shows.  I can say that those songs aren't reflective of the new songs, those are a little older than most and we wrote them around the time of The Devil and God, we just recently remembered they existed and started playing them live. We didn't like them 10 years ago, but we like them now. I think they're a little more melodious than what we last worked on. I think you can listen to them and catch on/ be able to sing along to them rather quickly- that's what I can say about the new music we're working on. If you look at Daisy, you'll see that the melodies were a little more complicated- I don't want to write or listen to music that tires me out after hearing it and I think that's our goal with the new music. We don't want to bore anyone but we want to be back at the point where it's easy for people to understand us but with added maturity, of course. More than anything, I feel that the songs are catchy.   The road manager tells us that we've run over the time for our interview but Jesse pleads for five more minutes.  Speaking of things that are catchy, I have to ask you about your work as producer of Bubblegum by KD + TGDB. I love the rawness of the sound on it- a style that you're quite accustomed to.  ----interview continues in a reply to this comment-----"
brandnew,3bhrn7,Energetictrain4,8,Mon Jun 29 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you, it's something that I'd been wanting to do since the only experience I had was with my own band. It's a process that we've gone through together with Mike Sapone, the producer on all of our records, in that we all get together and discuss how we are going to do things. I'd been wanting to try it and the easiest way to get that done was on a friend's album; someone who we were sure could be real and tell us if they liked something or not and then be able to change it- whether it be on my part, Kevin's part or anyone else in his band.  Kevin and I can be pretty critical with one another and we can tell one another what we are thinking about their work without really feeling the need to discuss it. Now that some time has passed, I see some things that I didn't think about in that moment and other things that satisfy me because we were right about them. Even though I don't have time for it right now, production is something that I'd like to add to my musical career. I've been ___ about other groups that I can share with and it's good to see that there's people who respect my opinions, and as for those who don't- something that I've had to learn is that not everyone is going to think that I have good ideas. laughs  Pg. 57  Quote on picture: We have a new album to release; that's no secret. It just isn't ready to be released yet.- Jesse Lacey   Now that we've talked quite a lot about you, I'd like to hear a little bit about your opinion on Kevin Devine.  He's my best friend, I have a very special connection with him both as a musician and as a person. He has such a unique personality, not many people can be like him. Since the first time that I met him, I felt an immediate adoration and after that I fell in love with his music, from the way he sings to the lyrics that he writes. He is the best guitarist I know, he does things with the guitar that other people can't do. He has an incredible talent that can't be appreciated if you've only seen him with a full band. He has this certain ambience about him when he plays solo because he knows a million chords. There's many things that I'm not able to do that leave me fascinated when he plays, I have tons of appreciation for him both as a musician and as a friend. When we were recording it was incredible to watch him and Mike Strandberg, a member of TGDB, who's another genius on guitar like Kevin. It was great having both of them in the studio. It felt like a competition of who could come up with the best riff that I have ever heard in my life. In a lot of the takes it was difficult to figure out which was better than the last (laughs). Along with all of members of Kevin's band, I have to remember other groups that we can really identify with and have formed somewhat of a little family, like Manchester Orchestra, Thrice, mewithoutYou, O'brother or even Dinosaur Pile-Up and now The Xcerts. We share a lot amongst ourselves, not only staff and gear but they're people with whom we feel total peace and harmony when we're around them. I have no doubt that the mutual support in creativity and what it means to be human that we've shared with these people has got us to the point that we're at now. For example, the formation of Bad Books, I believe that without them we wouldn't have strengthened the values that we have today; mixing work with personal relationships has solidified the ties between all of us.   Lastly, is 2018 the year that Brand New ends, as that postcard hinted?  Who knows? Maybe... I'll let you know sometime his year. Sound good? laughs  ---end of interview----  I hope this clarified quite a few things for y'all- it's not perfect but I did what I could from 12 am - 4 am without the help of Google, haha. Now I shall get some sleep. Goodnight fellow Brand New fans. 😴😴😴"

brandnew,3bhrn7,cracked6,6,Tue Jun 30 06:05:47 2015 UTC,"The Sound of Silence   Being a Brand New fan isn't easy. The band that has been called the emo Radiohead is known for its large periods of inactivity and its distant relationship with the press and the circus that surrounds musicians. But after many years with no interviews, on May 27 we were able to speak with Jesse Lacey in Madrid, the charismatic leader of the most mysterious, unpredictable and fascinating rock bands.   (Skipping to the first question)  Today is a special day, your first concert in Spain. What do you think of it so far? Have you been here before? Exactly. I haven't been here before. I got here with my wife two days early and we were able to explore the city, we even had the chance to have a beer and take in the vibe. We're from a small place in Long Island and weren't able to travel until we started touring Europe and this city seems vibrant and alive like other cities we've been in but people are friendlier here. They seem calm and relaxed- do people honk their car horns a lot?   Haha, I guess so like in any other big city  These past few days I've seen people look joyful and peaceful, I've even felt happier myself. In NY, people are stressed out and everything moves fast- they live an anxiousl life to get the next big thing as fast as they can. But it's also a great city indebted to the great strength and dedication of the people there.   I know what you mean, I'm also from a small city. Kevin Devine also told me that he likes the city, I'm guessing he told you good things about it.  Yes, he did, and with good reason. The parks are nice, the climate is great...seriously, I want to move here! laughs  *You'd be very welcomed here...  Thanks. laughs The truth is that with all the people I've seen here that like the band, I'd be able to make a living. laughs  That's something I wanted to talk about, have you seen the line outside? The people seem to have responded pretty good to your visit.  Yes. We haven't been to Europe many times and when we play in places other than the U.S. And UK, we can feel the difference. For example, this our first time playing in this city we are approaching it differently than somewhere we've played before. There's a distinct feeling because it feels like a new show every single day. We've been a band for about 15 years and we've played LA maybe 50 or 60 times and lots of those people have seen us before and to come here most of these people have never seen us or have never had the opportunity to see us. To feel the emotion radiating from the crowd makes us feel more content in the new environment.   Pg. 52  Personally, I've always admired the way mystery and uncertainty has always followed the band. Do you think the fanaticism following the band is something you all were able to create yourselves?  Are you asking if we did it on purpose?   No, I'm referring to how you all seem more like a group of friends who get together to play music than a huge commercialization of a band  Right, that was an option. There was a time in America where we could follow one path or another in a moment of indecision. The way in which we ""got big"" could have cost us a part of ourselves or our identity. We had to abandon a few things that were intrinsic, know what I mean? Not just as a band but as individual people, because as we had to make that decision as a band we also had to make it as people. We had to ask ourselves questions like: Are we famous people? or Are we musicians with a family and kids? I don't think you can have both things and if you do, it's very hard. When we got to this point we had to take a step back and think, ""Maybe we're not good enough to reach that level or be in that situation. Then we'd think, ""If we appreciate all of what we have, and maintain it, maybe we can see if we have what it takes. Because we know how valuable it was, we had to take the chance. We're very grateful to our supporters and the people that come to see us, but sometimes I felt like it wasn't what we wanted and sometimes the support of the people was more than we could handle. It was something that scared me but now that we're older and we continue growing, a little slower than before, I feel more comfortable and ready to take the next step; that probably would've destroyed me before.   I was going to comment on that, it seems that your activity is a little more steady with lots of concerts and festival appearances in the USA and Europe  pg. 53  Yeah, we've done other big festivals in the UK throughout the last 5 or 6 years...lots of people go to those festivals and in that moment sometimes it's hard to comprehend the number of people that come to see us. We always want to have perspective on who we are and to be thankful for what we have. I feel bad for saying that it's difficult because it's such a marvelous life to live. You have the opportunity to travel to all kinds of places...  Is being a musician the life you dreamed about?  Yes, it's my dream life. But we also want to preserve our humanity in all of this- highlighting what it is to be humble and modest because there's been other moments in my life when I haven't done that. We have to remind ourselves daily that there's nothing special about us.   Well...*  No, really. We're lucky. What's special is the opportunity that the people have given us and that's why we always want to feel grateful for what we have. To tell you the truth, I can talk about this all day, it's quite strange...laughs You wake up in a new city each day, including those you've never been to, like today, where people are waiting to see you and the first thought that pops into your head is, ""Who am I?"" ""Who am I that these people want to see me?"" I always have to remind myself that people don't come to see me but to see what I've created. I feel fortunate to be with these people and to have reached the goal of my group.   But I'm sure that you're proud of your work  Yes, I feel proud but I want to feel more grateful than proud because there's other things that  I have more pride in. I'm proud to be a husband, a dad/parent and other things of that nature. People think that I'm a musician, but I'm not, even though I dedicate a lot of time to it. If I thought about myself the way that the fans thought about me, it would be a disaster. I always want to think of myself as the person who I am at home with my wife or with my son/child and be that person.   So you're saying that's one Jesse and the one we see on stage is another Jesse?  The other isn't real, he doesn't even exist. It's simply a job that I feel fortunate to be able to do/have and it's really fun.   ----Pg. 54 onward is in a different comment and reply hope y'all can understand a little more clearly now!-----"
brandnew,3bhrn7,wicryeker,7,Tue Jun 30 07:23:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you all for the translations    Up until this interview I thought we'd have an album this year but now I'm not so sure. They said right after TDAG, they wouldn't have a gap that long again. The gap between TDAG and Daisy was longer and we're about twice as long a gap now. This doesn't fill me with hope :("

brandnew,3bhrn7,Tyler2Tall,4,Mon Jun 29 21:55:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like they have about 7 songs they feel really good about right now.  They are likely trying to decide what to do with those...  Do they just release what they feel great about, or do they hold out, see if they can write a few more really good ones, and release a full LP.   Sealed to Me seems like it was not one of the 7. It was a late addition and they have added it to the mix. Maybe they can rework some of the demos and throw them on there, but I'd rather see the demos reworked and released later on at some point. (Maybe after the band calls it quits one day)...."
brandnew,3bhrn7,fght_off_yr_dmns,3,Mon Jun 29 21:57:42 2015 UTC,"they've already re-worked missing you, brothers, and good man and have been playing them live.  and if you believe the flyer that went out with the lyric books, the demos will be released sometime ""soon"""

brandnew,3bhrn7,kawhisenberg,3,Tue Jun 30 00:17:30 2015 UTC,"Here's a rough draft. I'll edit it as I see corrections to be made.  [I primarily speak English and I'm working on a translation. If there are any other Spanish speakers, feel free to correct me. My Spanish is much more influenced by Mexican, Peruvian, and Dominican dialects than Castillian Spanish.]  *Being a Brand New fan is not easy. The band recently called “The Radiohead of Emo” is known for long periods of inactivity and a relationship totally different from the press and the whole circus that musicians experience. But after many years without an interview or any communication with the rest of the world, on the 27th of May in Madrid, we had the opportunity to have an exclusive interview with Jesse Lacey, the charismatic frontman of one of the most mysterious, unpredictable, and fascinating bands in rock.  [I skipped the next part of the introduction because anyone who wants to read this probably knows what Brand New is, right?]*  RockZone: Today’s a special day. It’s our first [Brand New] concert in Spain. What do you make of what you’ve seen so far? Have you been here before?   Lacey: Yes, exactly. I’ve never been here before. I came here with my wife a few days before and we had a chance to see the whole city, and have a beer watching the ambiance. We’ve really enjoyed our time here these last few days. Keep in mind that we’re from a small area in Long Island from where we hadn’t really left until we started to tour in Europe, and in this particular city, it makes me feel so vibrant, alive, and different, just like the many other places we have been, but with the difference that here, people seem happier, more at peace and relaxed, or at least based on what I’ve seen the last few days. Do people here honk their horns a lot here?   RockZone: Well, I suppose, in such a large city… (laughs)   Lacey: It’s just that from what I have seen these past few days, the people seem very happy at and cheery at all times. Even I’ve felt happier. In New York, for example, the people live in stress. Everything moves quickly; they live anxiously trying to get what they want as fast as possible. However, it’s also a great city because of the great dedication and hard work of its residents.   RockZone: I understand what you mean, I'm also from a small city. Kevin Devine also told me that he loved [Madrid], I suppose that he spoke well of it.   Lacey: Yeah, he told me about it, and he was right. The parks are gorgeous, the climate is awesome… Man, I’m telling you, seriously, I want to move here! (laughs)   RockZone: You’d be very welcome…   Lacey: Thank you (laughs). The truth is, with all the people I’ve met who like [Brand New] here, I’m sure I could make a living (laughs).   RockZone: I was just about to say, have you see the line outside? It looks like the people really responded well to your visit.   Lacey: Yes. I have to say, we haven’t toured much in Europe, and when we play in places other than the US or UK, we so differently in each place. For example, today is the first time we’ve played here, and just like any other city that we have never been to before, we try to face it a different way, because it’s as if it were a different show each day. Think that we’ve already been a band for 15 years, and to give another example, we’ve played in Los Angeles about 50-60 times, where a lot of people have seen us at least once, and obviously, to come here and know that nobody or almost nobody has probably never been able to see the show, and they go to make this special moment, and the way we see it... To feel that emotion people give us makes us even happier than they are in that scenario.   RockZone: Personally, I’ve always admired the way you carry the group in such a way that you have that mystery and uncertainty around you. Do you think that the fanaticism behind the band is something [your band] had been able to create?   Lacey: Do you mean to say that we’ve done it on purpose?   RockZone: No, I’m referring to the fact that you haven’t commercialized yourselves and acting more like a band of friends who just get together to play.   Lacey: Well, that was an option. There was a time in America in which we had the option to choose one path or the other, like limbo, so to speak. Choosing the more grandiose option would have made us lose the part of ourselves- a bit of identity. We would’ve had to abandon certain things that, to us, were intrinsic, you know? Not just as the band, but as individuals. Because at the time we had to make that decision as a band, we had to make another decision for our personal lives. It led us to ask questions like, “Are we famous? Or are we musicians with families and kids?” I don’t think you can have both things, or at least, it’s very difficult to have both. There probably are people who have both, but we thought that we couldn’t. So, we decided to take a step back and think, “Maybe we’re not good enough to reach that level, or at least not in this situation.” But, then, we thought, “Maybe if we appreciate all that we have, we can maintain it and try to see what we can create in our own environment.” Because that was valuable, it was an opportunity that we couldn’t just leave behind. We are very thankful for the people who follow us and who come to see us, but at times, I used to think that this isn’t what we wanted, sometimes it was the attention of the people that we wanted. Sometimes, I’d feel overwhelmed to have such supportive people, even now, it’s something that has terrified me. Well, now that we are older and continuing to grow, even in a path much slower and gentler, I feel more comfortable and prepared to take that second step. This would have destroyed me before.   RockZone: I was going to comment on that. [Brand New] is a lot more active now, with more shows announced, and appearances at festivals in the US and un Europe such as Coachella, Primavera Sound, and Lollapalooza.   Lacey: Yes, as you know, we’ve played other big festivals in the UK about 5 or 6 years ago, like Reading and Leeds Festival and Glastonbury. So many people go to those festivals, and when you’re in situations like that, it’s difficult for me to understand the fact that so many people come out to see us. But well, we try to maintain a perspective about who we are and what we do, and we always remember to be grateful for what we have. Overall, we try to keep a positive attitude because it is difficult. I feel bad saying that it’s difficult because it’s a great life. You have the opportunity to travel to all these wonderful places…   RockZone: All of this- was this your dream life, being a musician?    Lacey: Yeah, it’s my dream life. But at the same time, we want to conserve our humanity in all of it, emphasizing to stay humble and modest, because there have moments where I haven’t done so. So, it’s important to remind ourselves every day that there is nothing special about us.   RockZone: Well…   Lacey: No, really. There isn’t. We’re lucky. What is special is the opportunity that the fans have given us and that is why we always want to remind ourselves that we should be thankful for what we have. To tell you the truth, I could talk all day about this, it’s all so strange… (laughs). You wake up every day in a different city, even where you’ve never been, like today, where people are waiting to see you, and the first thing that comes to mind is, “Who am I? Who am I that these people come to see me?” I always have to remind myself that even though they don’t know it, those people don’t come out to see me, but they came for what I have created. I feel fortunate for being with these people and to have achieved it with my band.   RockZone: But I suppose you’d be proud of what you have made?   Lacey: Yes, I feel proud, but I try to be more thankful than proud because there are other things that make more proud. I am proud to be a husband, a father, and those kinds of things. At least that’s what comes to mind, it’s who I am. The people who come to see me think I am a musician, but I am not, even if I do dedicate a lot of my time to it. If I thought the same way the fans do about myself, I’d be a disaster. I always try to see myself as the person I am when I am with my wife or son at home, and be that person.   RockZone: So to speak, that’s one Jesse, and the one who gets on and off stage is the other?    Lacey: The other one doesn’t even exist, he isn’t real. This is just a job I feel very fortunate to be able to have, and it’s fun.   RockZone: So to speak, that’s one Jesse, and the one who gets on and off stage is the other?    Lacey: The other one doesn’t even exist, he isn’t real. This is just a job I feel very fortunate to be able to have, and it’s fun."
brandnew,3bhrn7,christianmendiola,2,Mon Jun 29 12:26:10 2015 UTC,"RockZone: Additionally, it seems like everything else is going pretty well.   Lacey: Yes, well, it’s what we intended. We always try to give our all in everything that we do. When I play a good show and feel that I’ve sung well, or even when I compose something that surprises me or I've had a good session in the studio, I go home feeling satisfied having done a good job, just like anyone who works and puts effort into what he/she does. It's like I've earned what I have. If I feel that I haven’t given my all into what I do, I won't be able to feel like a part of it. I can speak for the rest of my bandmates and they all want the same thing, they want to achieve it.   RockZone: How do the others feel about the band right now? Do they want to keep playing and writing as before?    Lacey: We've always had that question floating around- “How much longer are we going to keep playing? We wake up every morning and we ask ourselves, ""What's going on? How are you feeling today? Do you feel inspired?"" We talk a lot amongst ourselves all of these kinds of things, and we're always concerned about how each of us are doing.   RockZone: Do you feel inspired? From what we've seen so far, you have some new themes...   Lacey: Yes, I feel inspired, but that doesn't mean that I could inspire the rest of the band. For example, I could have one or twenty songs or ideas to show the rest of my band mates, and maybe they won’t like any. And that’s fine, I understand, at least on my part, I’ve made something even if wasn’t finished. Other times, we agree on seven, four, or one of the ideas and we immediately start to work on those. Like I told you before, we put family and friends first and the band second and it’s cause we don’t need to create music together for us to have good relationships with one another- we’ve dedicated making music to a job. Sometimes it's difficult, we meet but don't feel inspired to make new music, or work on a song, or rehearse. But that works to give us a reminder that we have a job to do and that it’s our responsibility to do it. It might be that although we don’t feel inspired, we need to take that moment, as complicated as it seems, to arrive at a point where you do feel inspired. Lots of bands who have been in a similar situation to ours can tell you something similar.   RockZone: I suppose that not having pressure has benefited in working on new music.    Lacey: Well, that pressure comes from other things. We feel that about the people who follow us, because we've had the freedom needed to be able to do something with which we feel truly satisfied, and that they accept that how we are is something else for which we have to be grateful. Because we are that way people seem to respect us as we are, even after all this time and they still attend each show…it's something incredible.   RockZone: That's what I was trying to say about the support of your fans. I've always thought that lack of knowledge about your band and not knowing what's going to happen at any moment creates more expectations.   Lacey: The thing is, even we don't even know what's going to happen.   RockZone: Have you seen the show Lost?   Lacey: Yes, of course. We hope our band doesn’t end like the finale of Lost.   RockZone: Well, all endings are sad, but I don't know, there are times that the less you give, the more you have people hooked. As you know, they would play a bit with people and more released only the information they wanted. It was impossible to know what was going to happen.   Lacey: Exactly, you’d never know what was going to happen next. I understand what you're trying to say. I was very invested in that show and the stories of each character- I guess I liked what was an incredible adventure. I don't know I've said this before, but the mystery that surrounds our band and the respect that the fans have for us, sometimes is a mystery to even us. Sometimes even we ask ourselves about new things that happen to us, and we include you, or a person who doesn’t listen to us, in a way that even we don’t know we have. Sometimes we say, ""Look at this dumb thing that has happened to me"" and that can become something or not, but we like to be able to include our followers in our process. I believe it’s something that connects with who we really are.   RockZone: Some time ago, you were talking about new ways to be able to communicate with your audience. In fact, you had announced that you're going to release music on cassettes, and in limited quantities, the famous demos that leaked ten years ago. Even though that sounds a bit “hipster,” it’s something different.    Lacey: (laughs) Yeah, totally. But, well, I really grew up listening to cassette tapes and I lived through the change from tapes to CDs. The idea we had with this, other than being “trendy,” so to speak, is to have a physical connection to our music. Things like this, our CDs, the release of vinyl or our library of music that we’ve started to release, are things that have made us think to dedicate ourselves to not only digital media under the assumption that it is the first to have listented to this music. Personally, I feel more attached to something physical more than something that I see on a screen or hear but can't touch. I remember the feeling of sharing a CD, being able to open the lyric booklet and explore the design with my hands, following along and flipping the pages. I can also say that we haven't discovered everything there is about the digital world, maybe we haven't used it efficiently, and that's fascinating. I think that the tapes are going to be released soon and I think something released in such a (limited) format is something that's attractive to the public. It's not going to be possible to copy the cassettes an infinite amount of times the way you'd be able to copy other forms of release, since the quality would deteriorate with every copy."
brandnew,3bhrn7,kawhisenberg,2,Tue Jun 30 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"RockZone: Speaking of digital media, I have to ask you if you know aware of an Instagram account that has been spreading rumors about a new album throughout the past few months.   Lacey: Yeah, I have no problem talking about this with you. You're the first person with whom I’ve had an interview in a long time. We have a new CD to release. There’s no secret. The thing is that it isn't ready yet, per se. We hope to release it this year, that’s our goal, at least. We don't know yet if it will be an EP of 7 songs or something, a traditional LP of 14 tracks. We have many songs we’ve worked on, but well, I guess sometimes you have to face what you have and let it rest a bit, like I said before. It's something that we have to modify, one day it seems like we’re going to release it to release it and the next day we feel a bit farther from releasing it.   RockZone: I could see that you’re playing some of those demos that we were discussing. In your most recent interview with this magazine six years ago, you said that you'd like to re-record those songs in the future.   Lacey: Yes, well, this has become a natural thing that so much time has passed. How do I explain it to you...Those songs were like an abandoned child, but when we saw that the people listened to them, it helped us to rescue them after they garnered more affection as time passed. I have to tell you that, to me, some of those songs are the best that I've written , even though I used to think that they had nothing to do with our identity as a band, now I think that yes, they do. Because of that we want to give them the respect they deserved. It’s because of that we want to release them, even if it was in that format.   RockZone: Can you tell us a little about the songs you have been working on?   Lacey: Well, the truth is, it’s difficult to talk about them right now because even song songs we are very far from completing. We have to see if everyone likes them, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone included in the creative process.   RockZone: Could you at least tell me something about “Mene,” which is the only song you’ve released at the moment, other than “Sealed to Me” which ou have been playing at some shows.   Lacey: Well, I don’t know how those songs represent the others… In fact, those are older than the ones we’ve written now. We robably started to work on those around the time of The Devil and God […], we just recently remembered them and we started playing them again. We like them now, but not ten years ago. I think they have more melody than we last worked on them. When you listen to them, I think you can sing and follow along quickly. That's what I can say about the new music we have. For example, in Daisy, you can note that that the melodies were more complicated. I don't want to make music that exhausts me to hear, and I think that’s what we had intended for the new music. We don't want to bore people, so to speak, we want to return to the point where it's easier for people to understand us but with added more maturity after so much time. More than anything, I feel that the songs are catchy.   The tour manager tells us that we've run out of time for our interview but Jesse asks for five more minutes.  RockZone: Speaking of catchy things, I have to ask you about your work as producer for Bubblegum by Kevin Devine and The Goddamn Band. I loved the rawness of the sound you captured, much of the style you hear include.   Lacey: Thanks so much. The truth is that it was something I wanted to have the opportunity to do with another band, because I’ve only done mine. It’s a process that we had done together with Mike Sapone, our producer in all of our albums, and we decided to do everything with him. I wanted to try this role with other bands and the easiest way it occurred to me to do this was with my friend, with someone whom was my friend, with him I have the trust to be able to say that if we don’t like something and to be able to change it, on my behalf and for Kevin and the rest of his band. Kevin and I can be very criticial between the two of us and we can say what we think about our work without arguing. I loved the experience. Now that some time has passed, I realize things that were not clear to me in the moment, and they give me the satisfaction to be able to see that we correctly chosen with what we had proposed. With that said, it’s something I would like to continue doing in the future, though I can’t dedicate my time to it now, I’d like to be able to part of my work in music. I’ve been trying to get other groups to which I could contribute something and it’s good to see that there are people who want my opinion, similarly that if there’s something they don’t like, that it’s something else I have to learn: not everyone will like my ideas (laughs).   RockZone: Now that he has talked spoken well about you, I’d like for you to give us a bit of your opinion of Kevin Devine.  Lacey: Well, starting with that he’s my best friend, I have special connection with him with what he represents about music and as a person. His personality is unique, not many people can be like him. From the moment I met him, I felt adoration instantly. But above all else, after that, I love his music, everything about the way he sings, and the lyrics he writes. Not to mention, really, he’s the best guitarist I know. He does things that nobody else can do with a guitar. He has an incredible talent that people may not be able to appreciate if they’ve only seen him with his band. He can fill the ambience with a guitar when he’s solo, because he knows a million chords. There are a lot of things I could never do and he always leaves me amazed when I watch him play. I appreciate him a lot, as a person as much as musician. When we were recording, it was incredible to watch him play with Mike Strandberg, a member of The Goddamn Band, who is another genius with a guitar like Kevin. It was amazing to have those two at the same time in the studio. It was like a competition to see who would play the best riff that I’ve seen in my life in a lot of the recordings in which I participated in this album, it was difficult to say which was better than the last (laughs). Like the other members of Kevin’s band, I have to accustom myself to other bandss with whom we don’t identify, and we created practically a family such Manchester Orchestra, Thrice, mewithoutYou, O’Brother, or even, Dinosaur Pile-Up now, or The Xcerts, for another example. We share a lot between us, we’re not just part of the staff or technical team, but rather people with whom we can tour in total harmony. To have the mutual support in creativity and in people with everyone has brought us where are right now, I have no doubt. This is how, for example, Bad Books formed. I know that without them, we wouldn’t have become stronger in these values that we have today, especially to mix work with personal relationship, in solidarity with one another.  RockZone: To end, is 2018 the year to put an end to Brand New as was guessed by this post?   Lacey: Who knows? Maybe… this year I’ll tell you, deal? (laughs)"

I'll likely have the last half done by tomorrow.  Being a Brand New fan is not easy. The band recently called “The Radiohead of Emo” is known for long periods of inactivity and a relationship totally different from the press and the whole circus that musicians experience. But after many years without an interview or any communication with the rest of the world, on the 27th of May in Madrid, we had the opportunity to have an exclusive interview with Jesse Lacey, the charismatic frontman of one of the most mysterious, unpredictable, and fascinating bands in rock.  [This is an introduction, and I imagine nobody is interested in it so I skipped it]  RockZone: Today is a special day. It’s our first [Brand New] concert in Spain. What do you make of what you’ve seen so far? Have you been here before?   Lacey: Yes, exactly. I’ve never been here before. I came here with my wife a few days before and we had a chance to see the whole city, and have a beer watching the ambiance. We’ve really enjoyed our time here these last few days. Keep in mind that we’re from a small area in Long Island from where we hadn’t really left until we started to tour in Europe, and in this particular city, it makes me feel so vibrant, alive, and different, just like the many other places we have been, but with the difference that here, people seem happier, more at peace and relaxed, or at least based on what I’ve seen the last few days. Do people here honk their horns a lot here?   RockZone: Well, I suppose, in such a large city… (laughs)   Lacey: It’s just that from what I have seen these past few days, the people seem very happy at and cheery at all times. Even I’ve felt happier. In New York, for example, the people live in stress. Everything moves quickly; they live anxiously trying to get what they want as fast as possible. However, it’s also a great city because of the great dedication and hard work of its residents.   RockZone: I understand what you mean, I'm also from a small city. Kevin Devine also told me that he loved [Madrid], I suppose that he spoke well of it.   Lacey: Yeah, he told me about it, and he was right. The parks are gorgeous, the climate is awesome… Man, I’m telling you, seriously, I want to move here! (laughs)   RockZone: You’d be very welcome…   Lacey: Thank you (laughs). The truth is, with all the people I’ve met who like [Brand New] here, I’m sure I could make a living (laughs).   RockZone: I was just about to say, have you see the line outside? It looks like the people really responded well to your visit.   Lacey: Yes. I have to say, we haven’t toured much in Europe, and when we play in places other than the US or UK, we so differently in each place. For example, today is the first time we’ve played here, and just like any other city that we have never been to before, we try to face it a different way, because it’s as if it were a different show each day. Think that we’ve already been a band for 15 years, and to give another example, we’ve played in Los Angeles about 50-60 times, where a lot of people have seen us at least once, and obviously, to come here and know that nobody or almost nobody has probably never been able to see the show, and they go to make this special moment, and the way we see it... To feel that emotion people give us makes us even happier than they are in that scenario.   RockZone: Personally, I’ve always admired the way you carry the group in such a way that you have that mystery and uncertainty around you. Do you think that the fanaticism behind the band is something [your band] had been able to create?   Lacey: Do you mean to say that we’ve done it on purpose?   RockZone: No, I’m referring to the fact that you haven’t commercialized yourselves and acting more like a band of friends who just get together to play.   Lacey: Well, that was an option.

brandnew,3bi8ss,tallman2,2,Mon Jun 29 17:34:13 2015 UTC,"Deja was the nickname for one of the kids I played soccer with back in highschool  Always thought it would have been kind of cool to have an animal named that, and when they misbehave you can yell at them with their full name, Deja Vu, or Deja Entendu. And just like that, your animal has a firsty/lasty."

Around 1:56 I hear ""would you want me"" and at 2:00 ""ccause everytime..."" but that's really all I can make out.  If I get some time I might put the track in Pro Tools and isolate the left and right channels and play around with some EQ and see if I can make out anything else."

The only songs in their catalog session tracks (albeit heavily processed) are ""available"" for are Sowing Season, and sic transit Gloria. They're a revelation to listen to though, really get to hear in depth into the tracks. And to get to load them into protoools/your DAW of choice :) I'm not sure if they've ever been shared here before? I may be able to upload them if not."

brandnew,3b8phr,fght_off_yr_dmns,5,Fri Jun 26 21:52:50 2015 UTC,They also went like 2-3 years without posting or doing much. With Brand New it's a waiting game. They're truly the most unpredictable band that I've been a fan of.

brandnew,3b8phr,sputnikvalentine,2,Sat Jun 27 14:13:40 2015 UTC,I noticed the timing with this post and Brand New's post was around 12 hours apart. Almost makes me wonder if someone from the band or their marketing team goes through this subreddit.
brandnew,3b8phr,Cruzader09,2,Sun Jun 28 01:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think 'Mene' was probably the first song fully recorded and mastered for a new album. They posted 'Sealed To Me' recording session photo recently, so I'll guess that this is the second new song to be done. They probably have more songs but I'll assume they are locked up in the demo vault. I suppose the work is just taking a lot of time and it's difficult for them to manage their own lives and the band at the same time. I don't know, just my own opinion."

They were allotted a one hour and 15 minute set, and opened with their newest single [Mene], and then went into playing a couple songs from Daisy [IIRC - Gasoline, At The Bottom, Sink, You Stole], then went into a couple songs from Devil [Millstone, Degausser, You Won't Know, Jesus], then went into Deja [Tommy Gun, Sic Transit, Quite Things].   Basically the played from all their albums equally, and played the songs in ""album"" blocks - for the most part all the songs from Daisy were played at the beginning at the set, etc.   I'm sure things are bound to change between then and Cooperstown, but it was a great show.  Hope you have a great time! :)"

Even at shows it the same way. People might be moshing and pushing around and stuff, but everyone that I saw was super cool about it and made sure that if you were elbowed in the face, that you were okay.   One great example is at Shaky Knees festival this May this girl right next to us lost one of her earrings in the middle of You Won't Know if Degausser...can't remember...anyways, a couple guys completely stopped what they were doing and created a circle enough for her to find her earring.  That shit would NOT happen at a System of a Down show. Their fans done seem like family."

Well we ended up being the first ones in line and they flew in all the way from Alaska so I was happy we got to help them out.   so we hung out all day then got front and center right against the rail.

I have met, irl, one person from this sub and I really want to meet a lot more! BN fans really are like a family, especially when you're a long-time listener and have gone through their phases along with your own. It's okay to not like an album or a few songs... just like not everyone has read every Harry Potter book.   Plus... talking about all their cryptic bullshit can become pretty entertaining 8)"

brandnew,3axlh1,FlyRobot,6,Thu Jun 25 03:13:41 2015 UTC,"Downvote me all you want on this, but it needs to be said.   I've been a BN fan for a long time. As long as anyone could have been. And just recently K realized how personable the band is. How they are just regular dudes who have cool odeas and make music. I loved this sub when Mene was going on. But then I realized people just started digging too much. Creating this fantasy of mystery about the band when they really just want to be left alone and be private. People don't realize that they are no more ordinary than your neighbor. Just dudes who's job is to make cool music. That's it. Some people on here obsess over this band like Bieber fans. I know I wouldn't want that if I was in a band that people enjoyed. Especially when little things happen and people post about it. Like, ""just saw Vinnie buying some dank ass buds in Colorado!"" Cool. Who cares? What really went downhill is people trolling. Making up rumors of album names and fake Instagram accounts. That's some serial killer shit.   Yes, their music is great. And yes, it brings people together. I have met some amazing fans that I consider friends. But everybody needs to realize that they are just everyday normal people. You should talk about their music rather than their personal business.   OP, I'm happy for ya, man. I feel the same way when I see somebody rocking a BN t-shirt almost as much as I see somebody rocking my favorite team's shirts out of state. Usually the fans are pretty cool. But one time my wife got thrown out of the way for a guitar pick, and some dude completely ripped a setlist away from me. For what? A pick that some sweaty dude used, and a piece of paper that was printed out. And that's when people drawn the line of being fans and obsessive.   Sorry for the rant. Down vote me. Whatever. I'm not your friend. Or your lover.   Or your family..."
brandnew,3axlh1,retrocam,3,Wed Jun 24 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"Nah man I upvoted for you. Mostly to spite you, but yeah. Some fans suck, the fake insta guy and the fake maps really bothered me, and both of those people really sound like dicks. Honestly I've never even gotten to see Brand New live, which I'd love to do, but the bits of the community who are willing to pay WAY too much on resale for tickets/Deja RSD bug me as well because it means those of us that can't afford it can't get it, but I digress.  Jesse said in some interview I can't find that people come on their bus and expect to find guys sitting around cutting and crying or something like that but they're usually just sitting around drinking a beer and they almost seem disappointing. That a lot of what their songs are about are just stories. For me, I think that's awesome, that someone's able to craft those stories not necessarily from their own life, but others can't see past that, you know?  In a roundabout way, what I mean to say is parts of the community suck. But the people that frequent this sub and all the ones I've run into IRL have been pretty cool."
brandnew,3axlh1,lynch03,4,Thu Jun 25 03:10:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you've said here.  I too got into this sub when Mene was going on and that whole huge conspiracy thing, that album was comin out any second.  Then it didn't and I realized how crazy some folks can be.   One other thing that bugs me about this sub are the people who just can't accept that Brand New are completely capable of making songs that not everyone will enjoy.  I have been a fan since 2001 and honestly, I think Deja is my least favorite.  But I dare not say that lol.  It doesn't not make me a fan...

The larger the group, the more you end up noticing those handfuls of assholes.  I would definitely agree that Brand New fans, by and large, have a better sense of community respect from the show I went to and the way that most fans I've met outside of that have been as people.  Also, yeah the asshole will steal things from someone else, but you clearly also were happy at having gotten the pick/setlist...I think that it's possible to have fervor for meaningful art and not devolve into idolatry over an imagined version of the artist, clearly lol."

I was more about YFW and Deja at the time ""late teen anxty period"". Got heavily into rap and then once Daisy came out i couldn't stop listening. Over the last few years I have really connected with TDAG and Daisy and listen to YFW and Deja less, but i still love them and my top BN songs are on them. The best part about brand new is they have something for every part of your life. I feel like these lyrics and songs have helped me grow up, by being there for whatever times, good, happy, bad, sad, breakups, just whatever. If I'm feeling emotionally heavy in anyway i usally pop on some brand new."

ACL will be releasing the day schedule later this summer that will tell you which band is playing which day and @ what time.   the single day tickets will go on sale at the same time."

It's a general pressing so there are tons of them- they may seem scarce now- keeping up with demand, but it will settle and they will still be pressing more. I'm not sure it will lower in price- but you may have some luck when Amazon, best buy, or target has a vinyl sale in the future. It most likely will not become more expensive so if money is a factor no need to rush out and buy it now."
brandnew,3aryz9,Maxxtheband,2,Tue Jun 23 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"i think it'd be borderline hilarious if TDAG became the new white whale of brand new vinyl and deja was in stock at every record store lol  but yes, i agree with maxx, its just a bit hard to find right now b/c every brand new fan has been waiting 10 years to get this record so its in short supply right now. but i dont see them stopping production as long as every retailer is selling out thier supply within a week of it hitting the shelves."
brandnew,3aryz9,fght_off_yr_dmns,2,Tue Jun 23 12:31:36 2015 UTC,It would be funnier if Daisy became the white whale because most Brand New fans I know sadly don't own it anymore/never bought it (I don't get it) despite it actually being a rather brilliant record. I say this of course because you can go find Daisy anywhere basically.

She hit a female reporter, Julie Kaufman. The official statement said it was because she had been harrassing Björk (more specifically: when she couldn't get Björk's attention the reporter turned to her son. According to Björk this was when her mother instinct just kicked in).  ""We had decided to do all interviews the day after our arrival at the hotel. But when I and my son landed all of a sudden all these reporters are there and starts asking questions. ""Tomorrow"", I answer politely. But then they start to interview my nine year old son, asking him how it's like to have a ""strange mother"". And then...I don't know. I saw in front of me how the showed this on TV, and something broke inside me.... I only saw red. I should finish her.

brandnew,3ajuso,airbearr,5,Sun Jun 21 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"DEFEATER! All of their albums are the same story told from different perspectives. Here is a chunk of what Wikipedia says about it, because it explains it far better than I ever could:  ""Lyrically, Defeater is a concept band. All of their music serves as narration over one overarching story, telling of the struggles of a working class New Jersey family in the Post-World War II Era. Vocalist Derek Archambault stated in a 2009 interview that all of Defeater's work would take place within this story.  Their debut album, Travels, established the story and characters. It tells of a younger brother, born to an abusive, alcoholic father who is a veteran of the war. An older brother who looks down on him and admires his father despite his many faults and an addict mother who gave up trying to find something better when they were children. He grows up in a household that doesn't want him and eventually runs away from home after killing his father while protecting his mother. He attempts to survive as a drifter before settling in New York City. There he meets another homeless man singing, which inspires him to return and fix the wrongs he left behind. However in the years that passed, his mother died and the only thing waiting for him is his brother and no chance for redemption.  The Lost Ground (EP) tells the story of the begger from ""Prophet in Plain Clothes"" in Travels. A homeless street performer whose song inspires the younger brother to stop running from his past and problems. Lost Ground reveals the Prophet's past, an African American World War II veteran that returns home only to find his service and sacrifice means nothing and is shunned for the color of his skin. Hopeless, he becomes an alcoholic train hopper and street performer, singing of his struggles in order to survive hoping that maybe he can change someone's life for the better.  Empty Days & Sleepless Nights returns to the New Jersey family, this time centered around the older brother of the protagonist of Travels and covers the time span directly from the moment in ""Forgiver Forgetter"" when the father is murdered by the younger brother, up to the younger brother's return in ""Debts"", abet from the elder's perspective. The older brother, still struggling to cope with the breakup of his family, begins working to support his heroin addicted mother, all the while under the pressure to live up to the father he idolised and the burning hatred of his brother wishing vengeance on him the moment he returns. However, eventually he decides to settle down and gets married, but his marriage quickly begins to suffer as his drinking takes its toll on him and an old bookie demands payment for his father's debts. After pushing the bookie too far, he knocks the elder brother unconscious in a bar fight. The elder brother returns home later that night to find his wife raped and murdered. With nothing left to live for, he works and waits for his brother to return home.  Letters Home features the life of the father of the family, structured in reverse chronological order, each song is a letter that the father wrote while serving in WW2. The album covers the father's life prior to ""Blessed Burden"" in Travels, showing his shattered state of mind as he struggles to cope with his failed marriage and trauma experienced in war. All the way to his learning of his own brother's death in the Pacific which is the catalyzing event that triggers his downward spiral into alcoholism and domestic abuse.  It is to be assumed that the next album will be from the perspective of the mother, finally showing her point of view during the events of the previous albums."""
brandnew,3ajuso,bloodlusting,3,Sun Jun 21 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"My picks of Hospice and Carrie and Lowell were already posted. Amazing albums.   Aside from those I would suggest Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer? by Of Montreal, The Lonesome Crowded West by Modest Mouse and Giles Corey's self-titled.  I wouldn't say they're quite the same as the others, as the stories aren't as much narratives and more glimpses into a particular environment or the mind of the artist but they're still amazing nonetheless. Hissing Fauna is Kevin Barnes struggling with depression and the loss of his wife, and his adoption of an alter ego as part of the struggle. The Lonesome Crowded West is a trip through today's fading west of public transportation, trailer parks and empty bars through the lens of a drunken trailer rat. Giles Corey is Dan Barrett's brutal struggle with depression and near-suicide, which the album not only covers but explains in harrowing detail with an accompanying book.  I highly suggest all three, they're some of my favorites. Hissing Fauna is poppy and fun but at the same time pissed off and lonely and features The Past Is A Grotesque Animal, a 12-minute cathartic release. Lonesome Crowded West grapples with religion and loneliness and alternates between angry desperate screaming overtop snarling guitars and lonely ballads. Giles Corey is chilling and haunting but also gut-wrenching and incredibly well-done. Not to mention Jesse frequently cites Modest Mouse as an influence and once covered a song from LCW (Trailer Trash), and TDAG contains many similar vibes to Giles Corey (though not to nearly the same intensity).  Rambled a bit there, sorry. But yeah, three of my favorite albums that anyone looking for a great story in an album should listen to (LCW and Giles Corey on this sub especially). And compared to Brand New they all tell stories as much as TDAG does even if they're not straight narratives like Hospice."

It's signed by Jesse on the left side of the front.  The only thing is the adult shirts were sold out so its a kids large, but a girl could fit into it. Somehow it got washed and the auto has faded but it's still pretty visible."

brandnew,3abr4e,noeyescansee,7,Thu Jun 18 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"Confirmed: ""Harvaness"" is the new album's title."
brandnew,3abr4e,buriedcompass,3,Thu Jun 18 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"I dreamt I was walking to a Brand New concert once, which makes no logical sense because I live in northern MD, about an hour from any venue in Baltimore, DC, or Philly. But in my dream my grandfather that passed away a few years ago was walking with me and was going to the show because he knew how much I loved them and wanted to see for himself."

brandnew,3abr4e,Tbern05,3,Sat Jun 20 01:08:12 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago I dreamt I met Jesse in the waiting room for visits at a prison. I asked him if I could ask a question and he said ""maybe"" in a way that suggested he didn't really want to talk to me. I asked why he changed the lyrics in You Won't Know during the breakdown from what they are in the Pogolith booklet and he laughed and said something about how he knows people are curious about that but he can't really answer because mysteries are good sometimes. We'd just have to guess and try and figure it out. I remember it was cold and gray outside and as I was walking away I felt really stupid for asking.  Also, not Brand New but sort of related, I had a dream not long after that one that I went to a Citizen show and they played their new song Cement and Mat Kerekes was like out in the crowd while singing and I got to hug him."
brandnew,3abr4e,wabisabi218,2,Sat Jun 20 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"I went through a pretty serious anxiety/depression episode right around Christmas, and I could barely get out of bed. In the middle of one of my new-medication/fever dreams, I dreamed that Brand New had announced their new album on Instagram. The album cover was a dark purple flower. Was very disappointed when I realized I made that up.  I also had a series of dreams (think two in one night, even) immediately before I saw them in concert for the first time that I had either lost my ticket or left it on a train, or somehow otherwise couldn't get in to the show. ...Yeah, I was quite relieved when my ticket beeped and let me in to the actual show the next day!!"

brandnew,3abr4e,Tbern05,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:11:11 2015 UTC,Just had a dream last night I was seeing Brand New with a good buddy of mine. Jesse came out into the crowd and hung out with my friend and I. No one else in the crowd seem to notice him. It was pretty awesome.
brandnew,3abr4e,Nebula15,0,Tue Jun 23 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"I realize this is some weird fan girl dream but still. I was in a room with my english class to hear a presentation about a book we actually read in german class - the room was the same room I used to dance ballet in when I was like 6 or 7. There was a small band in the background playing background music during the presentation and for some reason it seemed completely normal to me until I realized it was Brand New. I had a hard time staying calm during the presentation and afterwards, we all left the room, but I went back - idk why. when I opened the door there was Jesse alone in the room jamming something on his guitar so I went to him and told him how much they mean to me and eventually bursted out in tears. I remember that Jesse seemed very surprised and I don't know exactly what he said but it was really nice and I was extremly disappointed when I woke up."

I used to basically hate almost every song on it, but over the past two weeks it's the only thing I've been listening to. I think seeing them play songs live changes them completely for me. For example, I used to hate ""You Won't Know"" (crazy, I know) and then I saw them play it live and it automatically became my favorite song. I don't know how to explain it, but I guess (after seeing them live) every time I hear the songs I think of the crowd and the energy that the song brought.   Sorry if that doesn't make sense :/"

brandnew,39wao2,Scholesey99,19,Mon Jun 15 09:12:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any interviews where he has been asked that question directly. However he has given responses to questions that would imply that he is religious, and some of the things he has mentioned sound a lot like Christian values.  Here is an interview where he talks about Christianity as it pertains to rock music. The way he answers the question at the end leads me to believe that he does believe in some form of Christianity. His answer goes on to a second video which should be accessible from the sidebar if you view it in youtube.  Aside from that, I get a pretty strong feeling that he is a Christian based on some circumstantial evidence. Granted, none of this on its own is evidence, but when considered all together it's pretty convincing.   He went to a Christian high school The first ""Thank You"" in his section of the Deja Entendu CD jacket is God There are numerous Bible references throughout each album, and (to my knowledge) none to other religious texts, so he has knowledge of the Bible, which leads me to believe that if he does subscribe to a religion it is Christianity. There are several very personal lyrics that have Christian themes in songs like Jesus, Limousine, Degausser, You Won't Know, Sealed To Me, and I'm sure a few others that I can't think of right now.   Sorry for the long winded response. As a Christian this stuff just sticks out to me."
brandnew,39wao2,Welcome_To_Bangkok,17,Mon Jun 15 09:57:41 2015 UTC,"I think you made some good observations. I've made the same ones over the years.   As a Christian, I'm pretty conservative, and of what I've observed of Jesse's lyricism over the years is that it is pervaded with doubt. Now, this is a very normal aspect of faith, and with Daisy I get the sense that faith has been lost. It could merely be a theme to the album, or it could reflect actual beliefs for Jesse (and Vin).   I'd say it's really ambiguous. Though it's the Christian references that drew me to the band in the first place, I'd venture to say that there're certainly indications of ""possible"" faith in Christ."

It's what he knows. It doesn't necessarily mean he's Christian. I've always seen many of those tracks as a perspective of someone else.

brandnew,39wao2,Welcome_To_Bangkok,2,Tue Jun 16 05:25:03 2015 UTC,"""Those gates WON'T be sealed to ME""  It's word play, in my opinion. He talks about his wife BEING sealed to him(which is a positive) in the song but says the gates of heaven won't be sealed to him(which is a negative).  Now, you could also take it literally and in that case he's saying the gates of heaven will be open to him.  If the term 'sealed to me' is indeed a mormon reference because of his wife, I think this is a song that further backs my opinion that Jesse no longer believes.  ""YOUR KINGDOM NEVER COMES, I AIN'T NO CHOSEN ONE""  ""Cast me out into outer darkness 'cause I couldn't cover rent to stay at God's apartment"""
brandnew,39wao2,buriedcompass,3,Tue Jun 16 11:55:34 2015 UTC,"If that is how you've chosen to interpret the lyrics I guess I can't change your mind. It's clear you've got your mind made up about this which is fine. I think you have to stretch further to reach the conclusion that he is not a believer than to reach the conclusion that he believes.  Just my 2 cents (it's pointless to get into a discussion over the ""right"" interpretation of a song): heart stops beating (he dies), float through the ceiling (his soul ascends to Heaven), those gates won't be sealed to me (the gates of heaven will not be closed to me, I.e., I will be allowed into Heaven).  I think this is the most straightforward interpretation of the final verse. I guess you can choose to believe he's using some kind of word play which I still don't really understand, but I see no reason to. Oh, and ""I couldn't cover rent to stay in God's apartment"" is him saying that he cannot cover the cost to be in God's presence or receive God's mercy which is a fundamental belief of every Christian. We aren't worthy and can't attain his grace on our own (which is why Jesus died, he paid the price for us. ""Covered the rent"" for us.).  Either way I respect your interpretation, and though I disagree with it, I recognize that you may interpret his lyrics many different ways."
brandnew,39wao2,Welcome_To_Bangkok,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"You make good points. My theory is from a Mormon member of the sub that said being sealed to someone is the way Mormons marry and the lyric saying the gates WON'T be sealed to him is a negative. I'm not Mormon but that clicked for me. It's just my opinion and I am in no way claiming to know Jesse's true meaning.  I'm curious how you reconcile the line, ""Your kingdom never comes, I ain't no chosen one"" with your interpretation of the song?"
brandnew,39wao2,buriedcompass,3,Wed Jun 17 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"Ex-mormon here.  You can only be sealed to a person, not a place/gates/heaven/etc.  So the ""whats it mean to be sealed to me"" is about his wife, but the ""those gates won't be sealed to me"" is clearly just a play on the phrase ""sealed"" but is not meant in the same sense as in the chorus.  If the gates were sealed, he would not be able to make it in.  He clearly believes that if there is heaven he would make the cut."
brandnew,39wao2,youngestalma,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"Couldn't gates(of Heaven) be another way of saying God, which he could be sealed to?  For the record, I'm a Christian, and would prefer for Jesse to believe in God. I just get the impression that he has lost his faith."
brandnew,39wao2,buriedcompass,2,Wed Jun 17 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"Nobody gets sealed to God in Mormonism, so while it is possible, the terminology used that way wouldn't fit if it was meant to have Mormon overtones.   I get the sense that he was raised Christian but has eschewed organized religion in a lot of ways. There are plenty of lyrics one could use to say he is a Christian, but probably one who ""hopes"" more than ""believes"" in God to somehow provide eternal justice for the flaws of humanity."
brandnew,39wao2,youngestalma,3,Wed Jun 17 04:58:24 2015 UTC,"Again I think you're overthinking the sealed to me line. Sometimes it really is just as simple as the words sound. I'm not sure it even makes sense in your context.  The kingdom never comes line. Whether you interpret it my way or your way that line is sort of random. It doesn't really reflect any of the other points made throughout the song.   Both lines are basically two ways of saying the same thing. ""Your kingdom never comes"" is sort of a metaphor for ""I ain't no chosen one"". Kind of like ""I want to burn down everything we've begun, I want to kill and eat my young"" just to give another example.   Many Christians, including myself, struggle with not feeling God's ""blessing"", or whatever you want to call it, on their life. Like not feeling good enough or like you're unimportant. Maybe that's what he's talking about. It doesn't mean you don't believe in God anymore (fundamental to Christianity is that you don't believe in it because of what it does for you, you believe because it's the truth. How you feel about it or how it makes you feel at any particular time are technically irrelevant).  So if I were to interpret that line honestly that would be how. Every single Christian that has ever lived has gone through struggles with their faith. And it's happening constantly. It can be really frustrating at times. Its part of the reason I love the band As Cities Burn. Christian dudes that don't sing ""Christian"" songs, but they sing about their lives as Christians and that frequently involves internal struggles with certain elements of their faith."
brandnew,39wao2,Welcome_To_Bangkok,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:38:03 2015 UTC,"You make some fair points, though I think you're trying to gloss over the 'your kingdom never comes' line.

brandnew,39wao2,buriedcompass,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:46:38 2015 UTC,"Mene is let about faith at all. It's about the band coming to an end.

brandnew,39wao2,Coos-Coos,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"Like I said in another post in the thread, I think Jesse used to believe but no longer does. That song was written over 10 years ago.  Also, remember this is just my opinion."
brandnew,39wao2,buriedcompass,3,Tue Jun 16 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"Feel free to make of these what you will, but, the lyrics Jesse writes speak of doubt, of a lack of faith, and of trouble believing. Whether or not that means he's an apostate I can't say, but the music catalog is beautifully doubtful:  From Jesus Christ:  I know you’ll come like a thief in the night But I’ve had some time, O' Lord, to hone my lying technique I know you think that I’m someone you can trust But I’m scared I’ll get scared, and I swear I’ll try to nail you back up      So do you think that we could work out a sign? So I’ll know it’s you and that it’s over, so I won’t even try I know you’re comin’ for the people like me But we all got wood and nails, we turn, turn out hate in factories      From You Won't Know:  So they say, they say in Heaven there's no husbands and wives On the day that I show up they'll be completely out of their forgiveness supplies And I can't use the telephone to tell you that I'm dead and gone So you won't know      From Bought A Bride  If everyone's a structure where their own savior sits Then I'm a little red house, but no one's living in it      Sleepin' on a stairway, dreamt I had a boat Sailed it out the harbor, shot it full of holes Folded up my prayer book, couldn't see no lines Drownin' in a kelp bed, and bought a bride      Every lyric from the song Daisy...  From the song In A Jar:  You're hoping for a savior on your cross outside      There's too many saviors on my cross again I know I'm never gonna be a perfect man"
brandnew,39wao2,Nocodeyv,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:08:08 2015 UTC,Even Christians doubt from time to time. Trying times especially can push you further away from belief or bring you closer.
brandnew,39wao2,SomewhereDownInTexas,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"Mmhmm. As I said, I can't say if these lines make Jesse an apostate, only that a common theme of the lyrics so far has been doubt. Doubt, of course, doesn't necessarily imply disbelief, only that you don't have faith in the power of that religion upon yourself."
brandnew,39wao2,Nocodeyv,0,Fri Jun 19 01:08:02 2015 UTC,"Good work. The ""...little red house"" line is very telling, in my opinion."
brandnew,39wao2,buriedcompass,3,Wed Jun 17 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that two people can hear the same song and draw two completely different conclusions. In my opinion that's what makes Brand New so great lyrically (along with all the other great lyricists). Being specific enough that it's not generic, but vague enough that everyone can see it through their own lens is a gift."
brandnew,39wao2,PLF210,2,Tue Jun 16 02:45:57 2015 UTC,"So this is old sorta, but I wanted to add to this. I have recently started reading the Gospel of Matthew and Mark, and have already found 3 slight references in the no seatbelt song, Millstone, and Jude law and a semester abroad, besides the 40 days and 40 nights reference already in there. I don't want to speak for Jesse but there is a chance that he does believe in God, or  has thoroughly read the bible and has tried to understand Gods word to the best of his ability. While i understand that in TDAGARIM, he might have lost or doubted his faith, I think its safe to say that he believes in God. Yeah ok, I get that he went to Christian school, but no 30 year old man clearly remembers what he did or learned on college, let alone in High School/Junior High and can make clear references to use them in songs, so yes, He is probably Christian."

You can isolate one of them cleanly with some phase trickery though.   To play it, just take the CD, and rewind ""behind"" the first song. You know how on some CD players there's a desperate rewind/fast forward button, and on others it's the same button but if you hold it down it will start shuttling faster? Just try it. And not every CD player will do it, but just try it in different devices. Cars, DVD player, video games, boomboxes, etc. Something is bound to work.   Or you could just cheap out and listen to it on YouTube, but that's cheating."

brandnew,39ra50,nodice182,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a nylon-string acoustic in the lead? I liked your acoustic arrangement, it has a cool, paranoid feel.  Degausser is an incredibly difficult song to sing, even Jessie transposes it down a half-step live. I liked that you didn't sing the chorus octave-up like Jessie does, it helped to make it your own rather than an imitation. Vocals were a little pitchy in the chorus when they should've been maybe a little stronger; I didn't mind so much in the verses though since they're so lyrically intimate and vulnerable, but I'm not sure whether than was intentionally but just a technique thing.  Regardless, you did a pretty good job man, keep at it : )"
brandnew,39ra50,buriedcompass,0,Sun Jun 14 11:48:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, both parts were done with the same guitar. It's an old Hofner electric of  my dad's. I'm not sure of the model.  As far as the chorus goes, I'm not a very technically (or otherwise Lol) talented singer, so I just can't get those rough vocals without my voice breaking, and therefore decided to wing it. On top of that, I was doing the main guitar and vocals at the same time and this was at least the fiftieth take in a span of a couple of hours so I was worn out.   I appreciate the feedback and positivity. :)"
brandnew,39ra50,buriedcompass,-7,Sun Jun 14 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"Musically, very cool. Vocally, very hit or miss. At times you're off key and your voice is straining and sometimes you sound pretty decent.  Lyrically,  I question what kind of a fan you are. I'm pretty sure you said 'bread' in the first verse. A lot of incorrect lyrics. There's really no excuse for that as a fan and when a quick google search would have shown you the correct lyrics.   Overall, some potential, but frankly a lot of laziness, man."

I did in fact say ""bred"", though you have spelled it incorrectly.  I feel like you HAVE to be trolling. In your post you ""question what kind of fan"" I am while at the same time telling  me that a Google search would give me the ""correct"" lyrics to a song whose lyrics are questioned in this subreddit every other day. In fact, I believe it's  well known that the singer himself doesn't have set lyrics for the song, or the chorus at least.  That being said, I initially appreciated the first paragraph of your comment, before you decided to invalidate said comment with the second paragraph.  Take care."

But knowing the story of how these got out, going way back down the line to the files taken off from the iPod, and then the disc they were burned to, and then ripped and encoded again, etc... You can see how going way back down the line, before anything we even have access to, it's already been transcoded between lossy formats numerous times. And then of course as more people shared it and uploaded it, further processing and transcoding surely has taken place with whatever files were commonly available to us, now 10 years later.   If these do indeed sound better than what we've already had, it's possible that these could have come from an earlier source - earlier in relation to anything that's out there now. Maybe mp3s made by a friend of someone who got one of the burned CDs, or an untouched 2006 era download, etc.   Again, the best we could hope for would still be an MP3 of an MP3 to the nth degree, but a lower generation transcode would still be a notable improvement."

brandnew,39q7ry,hsdhjfdjfdjjsfnjfnjd,2,Sat Jun 13 18:11:39 2015 UTC,I got a tour shirt(same brand) in a XXL and I'd say they run a little bigger in size.
brandnew,39q7ry,buriedcompass,2,Sat Jun 13 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I bought a tee at a show last summer and it ran WAY small. Like, not a little small, unwearable small. I know band tees can be slim fit sometimes and we have a similar build, so I went for 2x. in reality it was more along the lines of a medium."

The fox is screaming at Jesse 'BEST FRIEND THINKS I PULLED THE TRIGGAAARRRR' and jesse brushes him off with a 'have another drink and drive yourself home.'

brandnew,39kewr,trkmstrwggy,21,Fri Jun 12 10:05:48 2015 UTC,"You're in for a real treat. Great band studio wise and live.  You want to take them as albums so it really depends on what would hook you first.  If you're more into straightforward loud, punkier stuff, start with Cope; their latest album and Hope the acoustic version. It gives you a great introduction. Notable songs are 'Top Notch' and 'Cope' for me  Mean Everything To Nothing for some great rock. Few ballads, few balls out rock. Notable songs are 'shake it out', 'Mean Everything to nothing' and 'I can feel a hot one'.  Simple Math for very well done produced grandiose music. 'Simple Math', 'Pale Black Eye' and 'April Fool' are great.  Like Virgin Losing Her Child is their first album with some incredible songs for a bands debut that's a bit more underproduced. I'd say 'Wolves at night' and 'sleeper 1975' are great and if 'colly strings' doesn't get you, you're dead inside.  They aren't necessarily the best songs on the albums but they're great go to's. I'm at work on my phone so I've not gone into detail on the tracks but I hope this helps and most importantly, enjoy!"
brandnew,39kewr,tobaccoandpeppermint,15,Fri Jun 12 10:25:03 2015 UTC,"If Colly Strings doesn't get you, you're dead inside.   Couldn't have said it any better myself"
brandnew,39kewr,Singsongjohnson,9,Fri Jun 12 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't start with Cope honestly. As much as I love Manchester, I don't think Cope is anywhere near their best work.  Mean Anything To Nothing is probably the album that is easiest to get into, then I'd move to the others. All their albums are great though. Personal favorite songs for me are April Fool, Pride, Pale Black Eye, The River, Colly Strings, I've Got Friends, Deer, Simple Math, The Only One, Pensacola, and Girl Harbor."
brandnew,39kewr,comatosebutaudible,2,Fri Jun 12 15:09:28 2015 UTC,Yea and for me if you're going to do cope/hope it has to be Girl Harbour. The hope version in particular is just incredible.
brandnew,39kewr,henryforprez,2,Fri Jun 12 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree about Cope/Hope.  It's not their best, but IMO it's close if I look at both versions.  The lyrics are a little more blunt than previous albums, but the music feels a more raw overall and the sincerity is still deeply there.  I do agree though that all of their albums are great.  My favorites are Where Have You Been?, Tony the Tiger, The River, April Fool, Pale Black Eye, Pensacola, Leave It Alone, All That I Really Wanted(Hope), The Mansion(Either), Every Stone(Either).  Edit: I also want to add that I think that because the lyrics are a little more blunt, it makes Cope/Hope a little easier to listen to.  When I first discovered MO, to me, it was the most appealing album because it was easier to listen to.  Despite that, the album has been since overtaken by Simple Math in my eyes."

brandnew,39kewr,sizeablescars,3,Fri Jun 12 10:21:32 2015 UTC,"Listen to their first two albums. Far and away better than the most recent two, which are somewhere between alright and good."
brandnew,39kewr,chrissmithstoke,2,Fri Jun 12 12:29:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I prefer their album, ""Simple Math,"" but it might be because I got into them later in the game. A lot of people like ""Everything to Nothing,"" which is really good too. I've had a hard time getting into Cope/Virgin, but I've only started listening to them in the last month so I'm taking my time. It might depend on your own musical preference. ""Simple Math"" definitely has a bigger feel to it (they have strings and horns on just about every song which gives it the orchestral feel) ""Everything to Nothing"" is more of an alternative (kinda punky) record. I would just give everything a listen and see what floats your boat. I'm a long time Brand New fan so I've known about Manchester Orchestra for a while, I just couldn't get into them until recently for some reason. I randomly listened to the right song one day and now I love them."

Perfect execution of all the songs, killed it during You Won't Know.  Crowd was alright but I didn't feel like there were a lot of passionate fans. I feel like BN played ""crowd pleasing"" songs and I would've loved to have heard Play Crack The Sky or Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis, also love me some Welcome To Bangkok. They didn't play Soco, which I believe was supposed to be the encore. I was really bummed, but like I said, the crowd just wasn't hyped up enough. Maybe 30 people stayed and shouted for an encore. As far as first Brand New concert, it wasn't a 10/10, but I'm sure in the future I'll attend much better ones. :)"

The first time I saw them (last year in Seattle) I went into it feeling like I would hate the crowd sing-along, but in most cases it actually enhanced the experience. Sic Transit was especially cool, and although, it's normally not my favorite song, Soco is pretty awesome with Jesse doing his solo thing and the crowd singing backup. There were definitely times where I wanted to yell at them to shut up, but for the most part, I was cool with it."

I went from being head over heels to absolutely devastated.     I will lie awake, lie for fun and fake the way I hold you, let you fall for every empty word I say.

I think the assumption is that it's Vin singing lead. I've always wondered if maybe it was another band entirely with Jesse singing backup. I'd like to know if anybody has heard the band mention that song. It's also assumed that it is a B-side from Daisy. It was leaked around that period...... As far as Gerald Way singing backup on Limousine, I've never heard about that. I'm not saying that its not possible, but I don't think it's probable. I'm pretty sure that all the vocals are Jesse's."

Every so often I bring it up to my friend to find out if he can get any new information about this, to find out if there will be prints made of it, or how I can get my hands on a poster of this. But never get any new info.  It kind of has been a pipe dream that it would be artwork for something Brand New related, with how cryptic they were when they posted it saying ""if the project ever sees the light of day"" and ""for an insanely talented friend of theirs"". Obviously they have talented friends other than Brand New and I highly doubt it's Brand New related, but it would be cool.

brandnew,39anc9,buriedcompass,7,Wed Jun 10 13:31:50 2015 UTC,"brand new has changed my view on just about everything.  its made me more accepting of things, situations, and people around me. its helped me realize that the human condition is temporary, and that we all go through darkness in our lives, but eventually we will find the light. its brought me reassurance that the music industry hasnt turned to complete shit and that music that stirs feelings in your soul is indeed alive and well. i believe in god and go to church regularly and i feel that brand new has stirred feelings in me and made me think about god and heaven and sin in ways that traditional church never has.   simply put, i discovered brand new around 8th grade, entering arguably the most influential time in a persons life, and they've influenced me in ways that i dont even know how to describe"
brandnew,39anc9,fght_off_yr_dmns,3,Wed Jun 10 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"I was raised Catholic and before I got into Brand New in grade 7/8ish Alkaline Trio had been my favorite band. I had realized there was Christianity and Satanism, but the idea of anything in between didn't really exist to me yet a part from other religions. (Atheism, agnosticism) When I started listening to Brand new I recognized all of the biblical references, but they seemed to take on a very different context than what I heard before.  I felt I could hear a struggle between reverence and detest, and I think that planted some strong seeds for me.  Then when TDAG came out and I heard Jesus for the first time, it was as if I was finally being told that it was okay to openly question my faith, and myself.  I refer to myself now as a ""recovering catholic"" as I like to put it."

I was always some form of agnostic/atheist (though raised Jew-ish) and now mostly existentialist. Growing up, Deja was my favorite album and when TDAG came out I just didn't like it. Flash forward through a failed marriage, two kids, and lots of life... And I gave TDAG another chance. It's now my favorite album and resonates hard with me. It's like I discovered it on my own time, when I needed to hear it the message was there. Brand New was there for me. Now the same thing is happening to me with Daisy, I've tried and it's just not hitting much for me yet. But TDAG gets me through my days, lately.

Now things have been taken down quite a few notches and the newer Triple Crown pressings can be had for around the same price as the MoV, with some luck. IMO, it's better to spend the money on the better product."
brandnew,397gko,buriedcompass,2,Wed Jun 10 00:10:18 2015 UTC,I have a Triple Crown pressing in white. I love it.
brandnew,397gko,Jackbluesoup,2,Thu Jun 11 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this! I've heard that the MoV pressing is less superior to the 3Crown ones. Also, the MoV is not a gatefold and has the sticker right on the cover too :/   Get it if you must, or just seek out a black 3Crown pressing!"
brandnew,397gko,DiminutiaeAmuses,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:47:34 2015 UTC,Where could I get the Triple Crown pressing? I own the MoV pressing which sucks a bit since it skips on Luca.

brandnew,396cwi,MrRom92,9,Tue Jun 9 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you. for any normal band, in a typical album release cycle this would be sound logic. however, there are a few things to consider.  the band has their own studio to work at whatever pace they want. they first alluded to this about a year ago when they posted a photo from it. Sealed To Me could have been recorded and mixed in house, and mastered with a very quick turnaround, and added to the pile of songs they probably already have in the bag.  secondly, they've demonstrated that they've already had stuff mixed, mastered, and ready to go for months now- ""Mene""  the point I feel most interesting to consider is that live video back in 2009 when Jesse expressed to the crowd that Daisy may very well be the bands last physical CD release. It's entirely possible that they will release the album digitally with physical vinyl copies to follow thereafter, seeing as they will be releasing the album through Procrastinate!  they will probably opt to sell physical copies at the shows this summer/fall along with a corresponding Pogolith issue (100% speculation)  just some things to consider. the fact that everything for the band is handled in-house now kind of defies the typical order of operations that bands usually have to navigate through with labels, studios, and all of the logistics behind planning an album release. they can march to the beat of their own drum, and I have a suspicion that's exactly what they are doing this time around."

brandnew,390toj,ohheyashleyyy,2,Mon Jun 8 16:06:16 2015 UTC,Yes. I honestly enjoy Jesse's cover a lot more than the original. It has way much more emotion put into it. It hits me hard every time.
brandnew,390toj,thequietthingsthat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:11:17 2015 UTC,I feel that way about Northstar's cover of Chesterfield King by Jawbreaker too. They make it so pretty and the original just isn't.
brandnew,390toj,ohheyashleyyy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Its the perfect cover choice: a song that may be a little out of left field in terms of it not being super well known/relevant as well as being a markedly different version. It highlights and puts emphasis on things in the original you may not have heard before. If you were unaware of the song it makes you want to seek it out. It challenges and strengthens Jawbreaker's original.   Plus its not been played a bunch by Jesse, only once as far as I am aware. It seems of the moment, off-the-cuff and has a crackling energy. Its a really beautiful performance."
brandnew,390toj,Haunts13,5,Tue Jun 9 07:43:18 2015 UTC,When Jesse played Yellow by Coldplay in front of The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot and joked that no one in the band told him that they had the same chords.
brandnew,390toj,G1az3d,5,Mon Jun 8 20:20:56 2015 UTC,All I know is that there's a video of Jesse covering Sk8ter Girl floating around there somewhere and I'd kill for it.

brandnew,390toj,fghtffyrrss,3,Tue Jun 9 08:46:21 2015 UTC,"My favorite is either Web in Front by Archers of Loaf or Chelsea Hotel No. 2 by Leonard Cohen. The way Jesse plays it is a bit more depressing than the original, but great nonetheless"

brandnew,392kg3,buriedcompass,6,Tue Jun 9 04:12:32 2015 UTC,"But if you play it backward he says, ""I am all three members of ppl mvr."""
brandnew,392kg3,GloverAB,7,Tue Jun 9 05:35:18 2015 UTC,I've seen a few people believe it was something brand new related. Most likely because BN's website linked to one of their YouTube videos a while back with no explanation.
brandnew,392kg3,Secretflies,6,Mon Jun 8 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Conspiracy theorists believe that because Brand New promoted Ppl Mvr on their website, that means that Ppl Mvr must be Brand New. There were other artists that promoted Ppl Mvr too though. Nick Jonas promoted them, so maybe they are actually the Jonas Brothers in disguise.... The world may never know..."
brandnew,392kg3,Tbern05,4,Mon Jun 8 21:02:19 2015 UTC,Oh my god maybe Jesse is Nick Jonas.
brandnew,392kg3,ValencourtMusic,2,Tue Jun 9 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"So, stick with me here, Brand New disguised as the Jonas Brothers disguised as Ppl Mvr. It's bandception (a band within a band within another band). We might be onto something."

brandnew,392kg3,lixelpixel,2,Mon Jun 8 23:07:30 2015 UTC,Clearly the same band.

brandnew,38yfmu,anderson7,2,Sun Jun 7 23:24:18 2015 UTC,"I hadn't seen this before. It's probably my favorite Liz Phair song and I thought Jesse did fantastic with it, even if it was a bit funny that he didn't change ""boyfriend"" or anything. An odd song for him to do, but he nailed it. Thanks for the post, OP!"
brandnew,38yfmu,noeyescansee,2,Mon Jun 8 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"I think it was kinda cool, I guess it was to keep the song close to the original"

brandnew,38xe5k,cocakula,9,Sun Jun 7 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"Tbh I'd attribute their popularity not just to the quality of their music, but to the variety of genres they span; Brand New appeals to a wide audience."
brandnew,38xe5k,no_post_on_snuday,8,Sun Jun 7 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"You're right with that. There was a fantastic post here a couple of days ago which took this concept a notch further, basically saying how the bands sound has matured along with a very large section of their fan base, in real time.  Me for instance, I was a blink 182 fanboy when I first heard YFW in 2002, so it wasn't too far a jump to get on board with this more mature, but still pop punk sound. But that was an important time in my life where I did a lot of growing up in the space of a couple of years. Many heartbreaks and friend problems. And then BAM! Deja comes out and speaks to all the issues I was dealing with heading into my 18th year. Finishing school, friends disappearing to uni/college, shit was getting real, and so we're Brand New.  All that maturing happens again before DAG, and what d'ya know, Brand New are there again - they understand what the last three years have been like for you. Your ear has matured too, and oh God so has their sound.  Repeat for Daisy, and you can bet anything it's gonna be the same story with this new record. I just can't wait!"
brandnew,38xe5k,Mikeyjay85,3,Sun Jun 7 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"This, so much.  Brand New is one of a few bands that continuously redefines their ""sound,"" because they seem to be more focused on just writing great music that feels right to them than worrying about establishing ""a sound"" in the way that more trope-y bands tend to."
brandnew,38xe5k,japr,4,Sun Jun 7 21:19:01 2015 UTC,Because theyre brand new

But that album was so good that I had to check out the rest of their catalogue. Their lyrics are also super universal and helped me through a lot of hard times."
brandnew,38xe5k,QuiGonJovi,2,Sun Jun 7 21:27:08 2015 UTC,Jesse's raw emotion.
brandnew,38xe5k,Blarbloo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"BN does everything right imo. I love great lyrics (check), but to me the overall sound of a song is more important. BN blends all aspects of the music together seamlessly all the while creating something completely unique. They also mix aggressive singing/shouting with quiet lyrics the best I've ever seen. Not to mention their amazing vocal and instrumental melodies. Add that in with the relateability they have and you just have a perfect band."
brandnew,38usx1,gammarayman,3,Sun Jun 7 00:33:25 2015 UTC,I enjoyed that. What chords did you use?

brandnew,38ljd2,jsullivan1331,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"How is All Get Out's new live set? I saw them a couple years back and was blown away. I was also pleasantly surprised with their new EP, the drumming has gotten so much more interesting."
brandnew,38ljd2,jsullivan1331,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:11:23 2015 UTC,"I find their live set to be absolutely amazing. Nathan (vocals) voice is so good live, I have seen them probably 5-6 times in the past 3ish years. Every time it has been incredible, Let Me Go live is so good. In regards to their drumming They replaced their drummer and backup vocals / guitarist about a year or two ago, so their sound is slightly different now. When I saw them a couple weeks ago, I believe they played the new EP in its entirety with some of The Season sprinkled in. LP2 of theirs is one of my most anticipated of 2015 (other than Brand New of course), word has it that it is coming in the fall"

brandnew,38l9zz,buriedcompass,6,Fri Jun 5 03:53:01 2015 UTC,No love for Daisy? I would love to hear Jesse do Daisy as a show opener.
brandnew,38l9zz,girlharbour,3,Fri Jun 5 06:51:31 2015 UTC,I feel like Daisy the song as well as the album is highly underappreciated. Daisy is probably actually my most played song off Daisy.
brandnew,38l9zz,ohheyashleyyy,2,Fri Jun 5 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"That 3 song run of Daisy, In a Jar and Noro would be spectacular"

brandnew,38l9zz,girlharbour,6,Fri Jun 5 10:58:25 2015 UTC,"Well, since jesse said that for every brand new song we've heard, there are 5-6 we havent...  I would just ask for a show comprised of nothing but songs that have been buried in the brand new vault over the past 10 years!"
brandnew,38l9zz,fght_off_yr_dmns,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"Seriously! New stuff all the way. I'd say just play stuff we've never heard or play stuff comprising the new theoretical album.  Strangely I've still never heard Luca live, so I would like that also."
brandnew,38l9zz,ibridgham,2,Fri Jun 5 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"iv only heard it live once, and it was great!  it sounded different live though because jesse played it on a jazzmaster instead of an acoustic like the album.    that luca bomb at the end though! man, the entire place went completely bonkers!"
brandnew,38l9zz,fght_off_yr_dmns,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"I should imagine, I would definitely lose it. Luca is one my top songs of all time, I'm really hoping they play it at the festival this weekend, but I'm not holding my breath."
brandnew,38l9zz,ibridgham,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:50:47 2015 UTC,It's on the current setlist if you are seeing them soon. The Luca bomb is twice as amazing live.
brandnew,38l9zz,highkingnm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:32:19 2015 UTC,"I only had The festival in Ohio this past weekend, and they didn't play it, but I might also catch the one in Chicago, so we'll see."

brandnew,38l9zz,buriedcompass,2,Fri Jun 5 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"Dunno. I saw them Monday and, while Limousine is my favourite BN song, the set was still remarkable and it took me a while to miss its presence. Like I woke up the next morning look at the setlist on the table in the hotel room and was like ""Oh, Limo would have been nice""."
