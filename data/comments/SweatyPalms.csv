I'm not sure if they actually had some kind of leak but it was around the time of the Three Mile Island meltdown I think. Also he is from Jersey.

SweatyPalms,3dqs75,Ur_bio_dad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:25:57 2015 UTC,"Edit: https://www.facebook.com/DylanBakerParkour/posts/971055406246024?hc_location=ufi Dylan himself talking about the incident.  conditioning, technique, experience & probably a bit of luck. He is very strong and if you look at his other video does quite some huge drops (on purpose). He has a lot of experience and knows how to handle himself in the air and how to land from big heights. Maybe in this case since it is a quite deep drop there is also an element of luck involved, not sure how often this can happen to him before he suffers from an accute injury. But You shouldn't underestimate how big of an role his training has in this. most other people would have a much higher chance of hurting themselves in the same situation because of a lack of conditioning, technique & experience.  finaly we don't know wether it inflicted subacute damage (for example joint cartilage) from this fall that will manifest in the future."
SweatyPalms,3dqs75,ProgressionApparel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:05:51 2015 UTC,Very true I know nothing about parkour but the technique looks amazing. Is there any kind of tutorial on how to fall from height like this?
SweatyPalms,3dqs75,Zygomycosis,2,Sun Jul 19 11:14:37 2015 UTC,"there is very little good information on landing technique. For some reason it is as far as i can tell something that is negelected in most sports with a lot of jumping or falling (basketball, handball, volleyball, bouldering, broadjumping) and you don't find a lot of textbook information or research on the subject. At least i haven't seen much and i train parkour for about 10 years have a bachlor in physiotherapy and follow the science discurs within the community (which is still pretty small in the community).  Most of the information is passed on between practioniers and is based on experience.  I am sure you will find tutorials online. but usually they are rather shallow and simple and you probably won't find anything that is sourced.  And conditioning is a huge factor as well. just practicing the right technique will not do the trick. Dylan is strong. Since he is training with apex i am confident that he does or did train with weights at somepoint (squats, deadlifts etc.), thought i don't know for sure. And you can tell from his videos that he has been practicing droping from height increasingly for years."

One year my hiking partner went for it so I rested at the top of the trail and I saw some skinny guy running up the trail and then on to Angels Landing. About 10 minutes later he came running back down. I asked my buddy if he saw the guy and he said while he was holding on to the chains for dear life the guy was running alongside him. I'll never forget that moment.   On a similar note, I've seen many people at Yosemite try to speed walk up Half-Dome.

SweatyPalms,3b6tcd,You_Fool_Doctor,24,Fri Jun 26 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"From the article:  ""For BASE jumping it is closer to a roughly estimated 1 death per 500-1000 jumps""  Multiply that by the 25 deaths per year that OP used as the title and you will get roughly 12,500-25,000 base jumps per year which makes absolutely zero sense.   From some quick research there are some popular base jumping locations with around 50,000 base jumps per year.  The problem is OP didn't even read the article. The 25 deaths per year (which I assume he is pulling from the article) is for an estimated 35,000 skydivers, not base jumpers. From the article, ""each year in the US around 3,500,000 skydives are completed, of which 500,000 are tandem skydives. There are around 35,000 active participants annually (not including tandem students) of whom, on average, nearly 25 per year are fatally injured"".

Or the type of organization that denies the effectiveness of condoms in treating AIDS and rewards poor people with food and water if they don't use condoms?  In all seriousness I love Pope Francis, and I think he is doing a lot to fix the catholic church, but if people applied the same standards to catholicism as they do to scientology... I mean could you imagine if scientologists got caught covering up child sex abuse? Abosolute shitstorm. People would literally revolt and burn them in the streets. Some of my neighbors are scientologists, they are nice people. I compare them to Mormons. Totally ridiculous batshit crazy religion, but they are so kind and friendly, it's hard to hate them. Imagine if Tom Cruise was your neighbor. Would you really walk over to him and say he is evil? Or would you say ""wow he's a nice guy. A little crazy, but a super nice guy"""

Whether true or not has to be proven in time and that's beyond pretty much anyone to know because of the sheer amount of belief, information and disinformation and history that's out there.   My thought is: I will die. You will die. WE all will die. When? When we are not ready and don't want to. A religion or a drug or a pill is not going to make the process of not existing any easier for me. So I will choose to live my life how I choose to. And I choose to live it in a way where I can expand my horizons as much as possible. Religions and belief are just what you make of them, you know? It's hard to knock someone else's beliefs without having first walked in their shoes."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,TheRoadTravelled,0,Thu Jun 25 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"And, there already is an absolute shitstorm dealing with Catholicism and with Christianity as a whole. It just so happens that Christianity has a full 1,000,000,000 adherents to that particular faith structure/system/cult/whatever. So it's a little harder to imagine it will just vanish over night. Scientology was only founded some 40-ish odd years ago and was a rejected sci-fi book idea gone wrong. Christianity has grown with the written word and with the printing press. Its tentacles are much, much deeper."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,TheRoadTravelled,-1,Thu Jun 25 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"If you compare what scientology has done to all the atrocities committed by christianity, I don't think you'd say there is a shitstorm going on for christianity. Scientology has had some frivolous lawsuits? Their leader intimidated some people and maybe punched a couple people? They have made some people clean floors with a toothbrush while being semi-maybe held against their will? Yet when the police interviewed these people they said they were good and didn't want to leave. At most the worst thing that scientology has done is convinced people not to get psychiatric help, and in the worst scenarios a couple people have died. But there is no way to prove they wouldn't have died in the hands of psychiatry anyway. It's a laughable comparison to all the shit christianity has done. I'm not going to even begin to list christianity's atrocities going back hundreds of years. But you don't exactly have to go back longer than a couple decades to see lots of horrific shit done in the name of christianity, and lots systematic horrible shit done by the leaders of the religion. Christianity is Adolf Hitler, and scientology is merely Yasiel Puig."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,THCarlisle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"I think people make sacred cows out of things and the amount of money scientology rakes is alarming to many.   I don't see scientologists, thankfully, being garroted, set on fire while alive, and bombed around the world. Maybe that's not scandal - but it's the cost of having a faith others don't like - like really don't like. Scientology has bad press and people talk shit on reddit, I don't see scientology members being assassinated for what they believe in (yet)."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,TheRoadTravelled,-2,Thu Jun 25 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"Christians have bombed and burned way more people than muslims have if that's who you are trying to say is evil and murdering christians for their beliefs, which I whole-heartedly disagree with by the way, as far as extreme over-simplification of radical islam. Islamists are mad about economic, cultural, social issues relating to capitalism, relating to endless wars, a whole host of shit. And a lot of them are just fucking wackos that don't think logically about anything. Likely the least of their motivations are a genuine hatred for christianity. That's just a silly comparison to the issue and total red herring argument. Honestly it sounds more like a fox news talking point than a genuine belief."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,THCarlisle,-1,Thu Jun 25 00:41:06 2015 UTC,"I was just giving an example man, chill. Muslims and christians haven't gotten along for a long time. Now, muslims have killed more muslims, easily than christians have killed christians throughout the pages of history. It doesn't really matter though - does it? Death is still death. I know some great people who identify as muslim and some great people who identify as christian, I know some really shitty people who identify as one or other as well. Again, doesn't really matter.

SweatyPalms,3ay261,Poes-Lawyer,0,Thu Jun 25 00:50:21 2015 UTC,"why do people on reddit always have to tack ""it's almost as if"" onto replies to people they disagree with? if you would just leave that out you would have had to type less, and wouldn't look like a sarcastic asshole."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,tupendous,5,Thu Jun 25 00:56:28 2015 UTC,"In my mind Scientology has the same amount of crap like any of the other religions.  I wouldn't hate someone more because of their belief   in Scientology.  Let poor Tommy believe whatever he wants. as long as it doesn't go around preaching - which, come to think of it,  I believe he was doing some time back.  Well, OK, I changed my mind, you can go ahead and hate."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,bingiton,5,Wed Jun 24 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"as long as it doesn't go around preaching - which, come to think of it, I believe he was doing some time back   I might be mistaken but I don't think he has ever publicly tried to convert people to scientology. And people ask him about it in interviews all the time. The only thing I ever saw was his video that he made for an internal scientology event, that got leaked, and scientology lawyers sued and fought hard to try to get the video from being aired. So I'm pretty sure he is not preaching. If you watch the HBO doc ""Going Clear"" Cruise wasn't even on good standing with the church for decades, he suddenly showed up and started doing shit again after the divorce from Nicole Kidman. But he has not been very public about his religion."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,THCarlisle,3,Mon Jun 29 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"No but he did go around spouting his views on autism, depression, drug addiction etc, views that I believe came or were directly inspired by scientology.  Some of these illnesses are serious and need to be treated, and his kind of thinking can seriously harm somebody."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,bingiton,2,Wed Jun 24 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"So talking about psychiatry and drugs? A little different than trying to spread scientology and captain xenu. Scientology takes the psychiatry issue too far for sure, there are certain cases where these drugs save lives. But the sad the truth is that some of what he said is true. We do live in an overprescribed culture. Giving children psychoactive drugs because they are too hyper to sit in a desk for 8 hours straight is barbaric. Also if you look at the effectiveness of anti-depressants, there are so many cases where doctors are now saying they caused the suicidal tendencies. It's a serious subject that does need to be talked about. I think 50 years from now people will look back on that and think we were idiots for prescribing these drugs we don't really understand. Cruise might win that argument, partially anyway."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,THCarlisle,2,Wed Jun 24 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure most if not all religions preach hate and intolerance of others somehow. It's just in our tribal makeup/DNA as people living in diverse enough societies to distrust one another.   I've seen a video though where a bus carrying Scientologists reversed over one of their own members and then, instead of calling an ambulance, waiting for PROFESSIONALS to arrive and help the poor guy, they threw him into the back of their bus and just sped off to god knows where. Mind you, he could have serious spinal injuries - you should NEVER do this having been in a serious car accident myself.   This happened in Tampa, Florida. The papers later reported that they did it because they didn't want to attract any negative press so close to the birthplace of their religion. Fucking insane if you ask me."
SweatyPalms,3ay261,TheRoadTravelled,2,Wed Jun 24 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you can find millions of instances where christian groups have done just as shitty things. Just look at the catholic church molesting children and then blaming the victims and moving the priests to other cities so they can molest more unsuspecting children. Or the crazy shit that fundamentalists do to their kids who are gay. If I told you somebody ran over someone and then ran off, and oh yeah they happen to be an episcopalian you'd say ""why does that matter?"" But when I say it was a scientologist you say, ""ban the entire religion!"" it's a crazy double standard."

His big stunt for Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was climbing the side of the Burj Khalifa. He almost definitely is harnessed in this picture, but the harness is probably hidden from view under his clothes and behind him or is photoshopped out. His big stunt for the upcoming movie Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation involves hanging from the side of a plane as it takes off and there's real pictures of him doing it during production too.

SweatyPalms,3auixp,videodork,12,Tue Jun 23 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"what a fuck head   taken from youtube comment section :The guy filming this obviously does not have any climbing experience whatsoever. He has two points of protection with two leashes and two carabiners. When he comes to a stopping point in the safety line, he removes BOTH of his carabiners from the line and puts them on the next one. THIS IS A TERRIBLE BEYOND TERRIBLE IDEA. You move your protection one at a time not just blatantly giving your soul up to the mountain by moving them two at a time. I'm not going to finish watching this because the amount of ignorance that's being applied to what is supposed to be informative travel video is sickening. What an idiot."
SweatyPalms,3auixp,zholmes430,8,Wed Jun 24 08:31:44 2015 UTC,"THATS the part of the video that gave me sweaty palms!! Otherwise, it seems like a really cool and relatively safe experience. Why the fuck is this guy unhooking both of his carabiners with one hand?! Is he trying to look like a badass? Or is he just that fucking stupid? I mean, the girl ahead of him is doing it correctly, so surely they got some kind of instructions when they rented the harnesses. I won't say he ""deserves"" to fall, but if he did, the fucker had it coming."
SweatyPalms,3auixp,grok_star2343,5,Wed Jun 24 08:59:59 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on this...they're not locking caribeaners so they should be horizontally opposed so that the gate of one lines up with the spine of the other, especially given how much they rub along the rock. It's not nearly as egregious a mistake as unclipping the way he does, but it's still needlessly dangerous."
SweatyPalms,3auixp,GirraficPark,4,Wed Jun 24 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"What's worse is when he did it on the stairs with all the people below him. If he fell, he would hit all those people.  This guy is such a fucking idiot. I'm enraged watching this. I feel angry that I gave his stupid video an extra view that he's probably going to make money off of. I wish I can take my view back. What an asshole."

SweatyPalms,3albjx,RockinOneThreeTwo,14,Sun Jun 21 10:29:19 2015 UTC,"Oh holy fuck did he hurt himself. I jumped off of a 7 foot tower into a lake, and I landed flat on the back of my thighs. When I got out of the water, I could barely walk and my legs felt like someone had ripped all of my muscle and flesh apart. Just from jumping from 7 feet up."
SweatyPalms,3albjx,the_butthole_theif,31,Sun Jun 21 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"It's hard to see how he lands, but I'd be more concerned with hitting the bottom than the actual impact with the water. It's entirely possible to jump from much higher than 7 feet without getting hurt, if you land vertically. The problem you run into is that a safe landing will take you deeper underwater than any normal pool without a high dive well. The highest platform in competitive diving is 10m (32 ft), but the pool will be very deep below it.  For example, here's a popular spot where every day in the summertime non-professional divers are jumping anywhere from 10-40 feet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sVISjVDVe8. People get hurt there sometimes, but it's relatively rare given its popularity."

SweatyPalms,3a4hh0,DnDiene,8,Wed Jul 1 22:55:31 2015 UTC,The one at Wet n Wild Sydney makes you wear these things you strap to your back so that doesn't happen (and so you are more slippery and make it up the loop).
SweatyPalms,3a4hh0,coke21,2,Wed Jun 24 12:22:38 2015 UTC,The one I went on in Vermont didn't make you wear anything and sometimes you didn't make it around the loop. They had a special door at the bottom of the loop so if you didn't make it around the top you'd slide back to the bottom and could exit that way. Half the fun of the water park was listening to the starting scream and then waiting to see if they'd make the loop de loop.
SweatyPalms,3a4hh0,angeliqu,2,Tue Jun 30 03:07:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, I didn't make it one time. Another time I was just about to slide back down the other way, ended up crawling up it a bit to get up the loop and continued sliding.  Reason I didn't make it is the lady said I put my hands up when the floor dropped. Your suppose to cross them and keep them crossed."
SweatyPalms,3a4hh0,coke21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they gave us the same speech. Keep your feet together and your arms crossed on your chest. If you spread out you lose momentum and don't make the loop."

You hop in the tube, voice goes 3, 2, 1 and the floor just drops and feels like you're free falling.  The worse bit is getting into it and standing on the platform. It's not as if you're leaning back, but standing. So it's really awkward trying to get your back on the back.  Last time I went on it, my fear came true. I didn't make it round the ""360"" bit (it's more like a side 360). I nearly made it up and then slid back down.  They have a hole in the slide you have to crawl to and jump out."

SweatyPalms,39q946,WWHSTD,24,Wed Jul 1 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"How does someone get into something like this? It seems like there would have to be a pretty steep learning curve, with pretty serious consequences if it goes wrong!"
SweatyPalms,39q946,IncarceratedMascot,18,Sat Jun 13 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"tl;dr many people in BASE and skydiving also wingsuit, bringing in other interested jumpers and showing them the ropes.  No personal experience so others who chime in may be much more qualified to answer the question but many wingsuiters (the vast majority? idk) are already involved with sports such as BASE or skydiving and therefore the extreme sports communities involved in such sports. And by now, with wingsuits having exploded in popularity, many people in these communities are already involved in wingsuit jumping and will take the suits with them on jumps where they jump together with people without the suits.  For those who are interested in joining in, it's little more than a matter of getting a hold of a suit and some friends with some experience, going out to a place they deem to be a safe learning spot or hiring a plane, and jumping with them until they get better at it.  One example of this exact thing in action is a documentary (the beginning and end of which are about a wingsuit crash in the cliffs of Crimea) called ""Bridge to Nowhere"" that essentially revolves around the consequences you mentioned of screwing up in these sports. At one point, it talks about how the wingsuiter who died was being taught by* one of his friends. (the one who suddenly quit extreme sports after getting and then beating cancer) I enjoyed the doc so I'll post it for whomever wants to watch but with an NSFL warning: (also turn on subs if you don't understand Russian) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxhlhmlwSB4  If you watch it, please bear in mind that, at some points, you'll see crashes and at one, there will be images of a mangled crash victim flashing on the screen."
SweatyPalms,39q946,Daniel_Yusim,3,Sat Jun 13 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"Damn, my grammar goes down the toilet when I speed-edit and need sleep. And gets an accent. Not gonna bother with an edit because it's not horrible but dang. Also forgot to mention, if you watch the documentary, re-watch the first crash scene right after the last crash scene and then it's a seamless splice showing the actual crash itself.  Also, I just realized it was instead the wingsuiter who died (red wingsuit) being taught by his friend (white and red wingsuit) and not vice-versa."
SweatyPalms,39q946,Daniel_Yusim,3,Sat Jun 13 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"For some reason I watched the whole thing even though I am not interested in base jump or whatever at all, just liked the sound of russian."
SweatyPalms,39q946,kesuaus,9,Tue Jun 23 14:01:14 2015 UTC,"This is a combination of base jumping and wingsuit flying. Before anything you first get your skydiving certificate, and then get some experience under your belt. Now that you are an experienced skydiver you have to get two more certificates and some experience of both. You have to get your wingsuit certificate and a BASE jump certificate. You can take those two in whatever order you want - the important thing is to have both certificates and lots of experience in both. Once you have done that you then pick one faithful day and combine both and hope that all your previous experience helps you not die.  One thing I want to elaborate on, when you go for your wingsuit certification, and all of your consequent wingsuit jumps - they are all done by jumping out of a plane. This is as safe as skydiving, because essentially that is all you are doing. You are just prolonging the free fall phase of the skydive by using a wingsuit to slow down your rate of descent. There are no trees, mountains, or houses in your way, so the safety margin is HUGE. This is where you gain your wingsuit flying and control skills.  The other skill to work on is BASE jumping, this is where you jump from a fixed structure or cliff and operate in close proximity to solid objects that will kill you if you make contact with them. The safety margins here are slim to none. This is where you gain your proximity experience."
SweatyPalms,39q946,The_Turbinator,2,Sat Jun 13 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"Well Dean Potter and his friend recently died doing this off Taft Point in Yosemite. And they were extremely experienced BASE jumpers. So yeah, pretty steep."
SweatyPalms,39q946,Magikarpeles,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:14:19 2015 UTC,Because they chose a jump location that was extremely dangerous. Wingsuit flying is only as dangerous as you decide to make it.
SweatyPalms,39q946,Bigfrostynugs,2,Tue Jun 23 00:26:33 2015 UTC,I decide to... not jump at all! haHA
SweatyPalms,39q946,Magikarpeles,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:28:35 2015 UTC,Well I mean that's fine. The point is that Dean Potter died because he chose to jump off a location he knew was extremely unsafe. It had little to do with his experience.
SweatyPalms,39q946,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:50:24 2015 UTC,Googled it - What's so comparatively unsafe?
SweatyPalms,39q946,EmSixTeen,2,Tue Jun 23 15:43:20 2015 UTC,"Usually in BASE you just jump off of something and pull your parachute after a few seconds, or fly out over a wide open valley. It's still very dangerous, but these guys took it to a new level.   Dean and Graham were going for a new route off El Cap which involved flying through a small crack in the rock wall during wingsuit flight at more than 100 miles per hour.   Basically, they were trying to thread the needle, and neither of them made it. They both hit the sides and never got through the crack. Neither of them ever deployed parachutes. In other words, there wasn't a gear malfunction or anything, they just decided to fly through a very small hole and neither one of them could that day."

SweatyPalms,39axrs,irate-wildlife,6,Thu Jun 11 03:16:31 2015 UTC,"Moulin (geomorphology):       A moulin or glacier mill is a roughly circular, vertical to nearly vertical well-like shaft within a glacier through which water enters from the surface. The term is derived from the French word for mill.   They can be up to 10 metres wide and are typically found at a flat area of a glacier in a region of transverse crevasses.  Moulins can reach the bottom of the glacier, hundreds of metres deep, or may only reach the depth of common crevasse formation (about 10–40 m) where the stream flows englacially.  They are the most typical cause for the formation of a glacier cave.  Moulins are a part of a glacier's internal ""plumbing"" system, that carry meltwater from the surface down to wherever it may go.  Water from a moulin often exits the glacier at base level, sometimes into the sea, and occasionally the lower end of a moulin may be exposed in the face of a glacier or at the edge of a stagnant block of ice.

SweatyPalms,398wev,Kingdonk0,40,Wed Jun 10 12:15:54 2015 UTC,"He didn't survive a near-fatal fall, he was saved from a near-fatal fall. The party that was coming down (with the video camera) set him up on a top-rope belay, because they saw him leading up a patch of very unstable ice, probably on a long runout since his last piece of protection, or on fairly suspect protection, given the quality of the ice.  A few seconds after he clipped into the top belay, the sheet of ice he's on slides off. Had he still been only on his lead line, he probably would have taken a very nasty fall.  EDIT: Looks like he had a stubby ice screw in there, but given that it's on the same kind of ice that slid off, it probably wouldn't have survived a fall. I'd say ""suspect protection"" is more the case here.  EDIT2: Okay guys, downvote me for trying to provide some friggin' context."
SweatyPalms,398wev,Elfer,9,Sun Jun 14 22:50:10 2015 UTC,"""Fun police"" time.  Its not ""near fatal"" you can actually see that he has a line running back from his harness if you look carefully  He might have had sketchy protection, or be run out a long way from that protection and drop a long distance, but we cannot tell that from the video."
SweatyPalms,398wev,special-measures,-5,Wed Jun 10 10:44:08 2015 UTC,They are talking about giving him the line and they secure it a second before the ice sheet drops.

SweatyPalms,398wev,special-measures,-2,Tue Jun 23 10:29:40 2015 UTC,If they would have secured the line 2 seconds later the drop would probably be fatal. And it looks like a long way down.
SweatyPalms,398wev,commandakeen,11,Tue Jun 23 10:32:53 2015 UTC,Why? He is clearly tied in BEFORE people throw him a line down as you can see from this picture:  http://i.imgur.com/6KqrgHn.png  He would have fallen but not completely off the mountain.
SweatyPalms,398wev,special-measures,4,Tue Jun 23 10:37:56 2015 UTC,"This is not near fatal, or anywhere near fatal. Falling on ice is very sketchy and you can get injured (impale yourself with an axe) but the guy ended up on dodgy ice and got some help getting up, that's about it."

SweatyPalms,37l7fj,grottohopper,1 point,Thu May 28 14:54:07 2015 UTC,Pools like this have a second level extending out to catch the water that flows off the edge. You can actually see it where the edge curves out.

SweatyPalms,37l7fj,Decne1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"Infinity edge pool:       An infinity edge pool (also named negative edge, zero edge, infinity pool, disappearing edge, or vanishing edge pool) is a swimming or reflecting pool that produces a visual effect of water extending to the horizon, vanishing, or extending to ""infinity"". The term is also used to describe perimeter overflow pools (pools that may be on level parcels, wherein the water flows over one or more edges, usually flush with the decking elevation). One type of location in which the effect is particularly impressive is where the infinity edge appears to merge with a larger body of water such as the ocean, or with the sky (if the pool is located on the side of a hill or field of green). They are often seen at exotic resorts and exclusive estates, in advertisements, and in other luxurious places.

SweatyPalms,37l7fj,WiretapStudios,5,Thu May 28 16:37:57 2015 UTC,Ahh the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore.  Looks much nicer than it really is. It was always busy and the water wasn't too clean... so many bandages. So.. pretty much your average hotel pool.  Good views but when you get to the edge you see that it infact is not a striaght edge and is sloped with railings to prevent people from falling. Nice views though.

Downvote all you want, it won't make my post less true. Yet another reminder to myself that one should never fret downvotes in the short-term. Below is an example of what I allude to in the comment above.   Hey #haters and #lovers... Whisper has been following me on my adventures since she was 9 weeks old. She's never been injured or harmed in any way. I protect her like my child. We live an alternative lifestyle and don't follow society's conventional rules or follow into line with the rest of the #herd... All Whisper-Dog cares about is keeping her pack together and never being left behind. For sure she experiences things other dogs will never do, but just as I am highly trained in the #OutdoorArts, so is Miss Whisper. I never leave her behind and she is always cruising around with one of her main people. So I ask you #haters, what is better? Trapping your #BestFriend in the house or car for more than half of its life while you work the 9 to 5 or bringing the #LuckyPuppy along on the journey and letting it feel the adrenaline of being wild and breathing fresh air?? If you don't like our Instagram then stop following us and take you pent up anger and dissatisfaction elsewhere! #NeverLeaveTheDogBehind. #ByeByeHaters #Freedom #FlyFree"

SweatyPalms,35zkmi,dumbcheese,8,Fri May 15 12:33:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that, but at least with water you have a chance of coming out relatively unharmed, if you enter the water at the perfect angle and you're lucky."

SweatyPalms,35zkmi,BitchinTechnology,-2,Wed Jul 1 22:36:54 2015 UTC,...I can't tell if you're joking or just completely missing the point.
SweatyPalms,35zkmi,ellomatey195,-4,Fri May 15 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"Impact from water from really high up still has about the same effect as landing on the ground would. If you've ever seen a video of a high dive, you'll notice they shoot out water from hose thingies, which breaks up the tension of the water and somewhat counters this effect."
SweatyPalms,35zkmi,Sulungskwa,10,Fri May 15 02:06:13 2015 UTC,"That's not what the sprayers are for, it's so the diver can see the surface of the water to spot the entry. Water is non compressible, therefore when you enter it at speed it must move out of the way to allow the body to enter.  This causes rapid deceleration which causes the internal injuries."
SweatyPalms,35zkmi,c-fox,6,Fri May 15 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"No, that's so you can see the surface of the water."
SweatyPalms,35zkmi,Sabortooth907,8,Fri May 15 09:43:44 2015 UTC,"Of course I know about surface tension, but in most instances it's still better than concrete. I've personally jumped into water from 50 feet and seen many cliff divers do it from 75-100. If you're an adrenaline junkie, there's a good chance you've tried cliff diving."

SweatyPalms,35zkmi,exitpursuedbybear,13,Fri May 15 01:20:00 2015 UTC,That has to be set up specifically for the stunt right? Regular people can't go down that just assuming they can hang on with all the adrenaline pumping...
SweatyPalms,35zkmi,WiretapStudios,10,Fri May 15 06:15:50 2015 UTC,"I think it was a set up for the Red Bull stunt.  It's hard to imagine, that the hotel offers this as a regular ""attraction"" for average tourists."
SweatyPalms,35zkmi,WiretapStudios,11,Fri May 15 12:40:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking. Usually zip lines are with a harness, or if you are holding on, over water the whole time.

IIRC, 1 month if they can find a cause, 6 months (or more) if they can't and therefore can't be sure it won't happen again.  Tough love, but it would be for his benefit, as well as those about him. He could very easily have killed someone there...next time, he might find that he's burnt up all of his luck credits already :-/  Anyone know what the situation would be in the USofA?"

SweatyPalms,334yf3,skweeky,5,Sun Apr 19 21:00:13 2015 UTC,Yeah but on the crane you can be reasonably in control. Or even on a 1900ft radio tower. This guy really had no way of insuring his safety as everything he touched could crumble away from up to 1000ft in the air. Crazy!

SweatyPalms,31nluv,Sa3ther,-1,Tue Apr 7 16:26:28 2015 UTC,That's a repost from a month ago.
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,Idontactuallyknow,76,Mon Apr 6 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"Soooooo, did they break his legs?  Edit: Fuck me he died and they sealed him in it"

SweatyPalms,31mr1v,MURICA_BITCH,8,Mon Apr 6 15:16:38 2015 UTC,From what I understand she was with him
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,Mywifefoundmymain,9,Mon Apr 6 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"According to the article I read, she wasn't with the initial group. She came to the scene later and was able to speak with him over radio, before he became stuck again."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,very_mechanical,7,Mon Apr 6 23:25:27 2015 UTC,Yikes. I can't imagine what that must have been like
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,MURICA_BITCH,7,Mon Apr 6 17:13:57 2015 UTC,Not inside the cave. She came to the scene after he was trapped but she was never inside the cave.
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,ebneter,2,Tue Apr 7 07:17:37 2015 UTC,The article I read didn't make it seem that way but you are correct

SweatyPalms,31mr1v,MURICA_BITCH,15,Tue Apr 7 18:53:13 2015 UTC,They had him free for a moment but an anchor failed and he dropped back into the gap. Jesus.  http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705347362/Man-trapped-in-Utah-Countys-Nutty-Putty-cave-dies.html?pg=all
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,very_mechanical,18,Mon Apr 6 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"For a few hours there were sighs of tentative relief. They finally cracked open the boxes of pizza and cases of water, and broke out in smiles suggesting the worst was over.  That only lasted for a few hours.  Once Jones was free of the 18-by-10-inch crevice, rescuers said an ""equipment failure"" caused the rope system that was hoisting the man out of the cave to drop him back into the same, narrow gap.  Thursday morning, rescuers were able to determine that the equipment failure occurred because one of the anchors that had been drilled into the rock had come undone.  ""It must have been the integrity of the rock because the anchors are usually quite reliable,"" Cannon said. ""It wasn't how they put things together.""   Damn..."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,Patrik333,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"died and they sealed him in it   My first thought after clearing the crevice would be to get something in there to block it, just in case."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,BetaState,23,Wed Jul 8 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"I remember when this happened and it was on the local news here. I've been down in that cave before, and even the entrance is super tight to get through. I was the same age as this guy at the time also, with a child about the same age as his, so it really hit home for me. I felt bad for the guy and his family, but now that he is entombed there, and it's sealed with concrete...I'm pretty bummed I'll never get to take my son there, it was a pretty dope cave system."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,lookxdontxtouch,6,Mon Apr 6 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source I could read? I'd like to read the whole story, as this is only during the attempts...not claiming you're fibbing. Didn't know he ended up dying there :("
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,jimevansart,3,Mon Apr 6 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"Not at the moment, I just remember the newscasts about it. I'm sure a Google search of ""nutty putty cave"" will find something for you."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,lookxdontxtouch,2,Mon Apr 6 14:56:48 2015 UTC,Ok. Thanks!
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,jimevansart,2,Mon Apr 6 16:12:19 2015 UTC,In case you haven't found it yet. Here is a news article about the incident. And this is a follow up on the same site a year later.
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,Taubin,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:43:20 2015 UTC,Thanks! Wow...the idea of getting stuck like that is something I just can't imagine. Truly a thing of nightmares.
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,jimevansart,5,Mon Apr 6 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"Same here, I'm near in age and circumstances. If I remember correctly it was over the Thanksgiving holiday too. This messed me up in a way news normally doesn't. One of my good friends was part of the rescue effort (part of a local FD, and was on their heavy rescue team or something like that). He freely talks (not disrespectfully) about the things he's seen on the job. However, this one he doesn't talk about easily. He's visibly uncomfortable, which is rare for him, relating any minor details. I've known him for three decades and didn't know he was on this rescue until like three years after it happened. Awful, awful story."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,DrChocolate510,2,Mon Apr 6 21:47:01 2015 UTC,So they sealed the entire cave or just the channel that led to his crevice? As terrible as it is that he died stuck there seems like an over reaction to seal the entire cave
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,Datmexicanguy,3,Tue Apr 7 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"They sealed the entire cave system. There had been a number of rescues there due to the tight confines going through certain areas  (I remember the birth canal mostly due do having to remove all my gear just to get through...and mind you, I was all of about 13 years old and in boy scouts at the time), and the people in charge decided enough was enough."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,lookxdontxtouch,31,Tue Apr 7 07:12:18 2015 UTC,"What a stupid, stupid way to die."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,Milkshakes00,21,Mon Apr 6 16:35:49 2015 UTC,"As harsh as that statement is, I kind of have to agree. Obviously I don't know what was going through his mind, but I've never caved and I think I could figure out not to go headfirst into the tiny passageway going straight down. I mean he had a wife and kids and was in medical school for god's sake."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,_how_now_brown_cow_,4,Mon Apr 6 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Indeed, any smart caver would know that if you don't know where you're going and the squeeze is getting hard, don't fucking do it! But alas, people still do it, and they'll still keep dying because of that."
SweatyPalms,31mr1v,revofire,8,Tue Apr 7 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"I was on a back packing trip and at the end they lowered us into a old lava tube and then pulled up the rope and we had to find our way out. There were 3 exits out of the main chamber. 2 ended about 50 feet in. One went a little further, then ended. We looked closer, there was a small cave at the bottom of the wall. We had to crawl for at least 50 feet on our bellies to get out. So narrow we couldn't turn our heads from one side to the other because we were wearing helmets. It is making my heart race just thinking about it."

Twenty years later I cant even think about it. This will give me nightmares. Sweet Jeebus, poor guy... there are no worse ways to die."

SweatyPalms,31mr1v,WiffleSniffler,-1,Mon Apr 6 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, without people exploring caves, we wouldn't have a lot of shit in this world.

BUT in history, without people exploring caves, we wouldnt be able to find pretty much every single metal lol. Cave exploration led to mining in certain locations where minerals were found. Without all these things such as coal and Iron, we wouldnt have advanced technologically over the last few hundred years."

SweatyPalms,31mr1v,HOU-1836,1 point,Tue May 19 18:13:10 2015 UTC,I understand that. Its a hobby that they enjoy. Some people arent responsible while doing it and suffer the consequences. Im just saying you cant generalize all cavers as idiots. Its like if someone dies not wearing a helmet on a motorcycle. He didnt do it responsibly and suffered the consequences. That doesnt make all people who ride motorcycles retarded. Orrrrr a racist white cop shoots a black guy for no reason. That doesnt make all cops racist. There is always a select few people who do things carelessly.

SweatyPalms,300n3e,Dixbfloppin93,3,Mon Mar 23 16:07:16 2015 UTC,Feet first? I suppose that's normal for a jump that high up?
SweatyPalms,300n3e,thedeaux,7,Mon Mar 23 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure it is relatively safe to go hands first either way.  In order to avoid injury, the trick is to break the surface tension at a small point, so like with your feet or your hands.  Then the rest of your body smoothly enters the water and you slow down gently as you displace water.    The opposite of this would be a something like a belly flop, where the force of the fall is evenly distributed across a large area.  In that scenario, your whole body would feel the sudden shock of hitting the water at the same time, and it would be like landing on solid ground for an instant."
SweatyPalms,300n3e,ewic,8,Mon Mar 23 20:29:13 2015 UTC,You will also note a stream of water being sprayed on the landing zone to break the surface tension.

SweatyPalms,300n3e,thedeaux,5,Mon Mar 23 20:55:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he used his feet on the pool floor to absorb the impact. It's much safer than risking hitting your head.
SweatyPalms,300n3e,bockyPT,3,Mon Mar 23 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"I want to do this.  Not the flipping part, but I would absolutely love to jump from that thing."

Now that knowledge, while foreign to you, is not baseless superstition or random jury rigging as you would do, but actually is known to work, and they trust their lives to it.  It is very very rare that you can look at someone who's job it is to do something, and with your lack of knowledge say that they are doing it wrong.

SweatyPalms,2x3kdw,Julianus,37,Wed Feb 25 13:06:32 2015 UTC,"There usually isn't much standing water, because you don't want the flow of the water to be obstructed in any way from the other side.

SweatyPalms,2v7fpe,AGreenspun,33,Mon Feb 9 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Assuming the length of the rods holding the swing set up is 15 feet and the fact that there are two rods holding the swing, allowing the swing to have a velocity of zero at the top. He is moving at about 30 mph when he is at the lowest point of the swing. That's roughly 48 kmh. Just if anyone was curious"
SweatyPalms,2v7fpe,Blargnah,9,Mon Mar 2 20:24:53 2015 UTC,How did you figure this out? I'm curious! :D
SweatyPalms,2v7fpe,Plasmodicum,21,Mon Mar 2 20:27:45 2015 UTC,"You can use conservation of energy to find your velocity after falling 30 feet.  Let g = acceleration due to Earth's gravity(32 ft/s2), h = height (30 ft), and v = velocity. Potential = Kinetic. mgh = mv2 / 2. v = sqrt(2gh) That is your speed in ft/s or m/s. mph = v * 3600 s / 5280 ft"
SweatyPalms,2v7fpe,Blargnah,5,Mon Mar 2 21:46:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what Plasmodicum said. If you draw the free body diagram and work-energy diagram you can get to that equation.

SweatyPalms,2uu511,Th3MadCreator,9,Tue Mar 3 00:20:12 2015 UTC,I wonder if one of the wings was just slightly lower if they could have climbed up that and waited out the fire...  Edit: Blades I'm stupid
SweatyPalms,2uu511,gimli2,-3,Thu Feb 5 11:38:03 2015 UTC,What wings?
SweatyPalms,2uu511,therealdannyking,8,Thu Feb 5 14:38:03 2015 UTC,I think he/she meant the blades.
SweatyPalms,2uu511,therealdannyking,5,Thu Feb 5 15:38:35 2015 UTC,Oh right. That would be something. I don't know if I'd have the balls to try and slide down one of those blades
SweatyPalms,2uu511,bobhadababy_itsaboy,3,Thu Feb 5 18:54:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have the balls to be up there in the first place!  I wonder if it's high enough for emergency parachutes?
SweatyPalms,2uu511,bobhadababy_itsaboy,4,Thu Feb 5 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  I don't really know about parachutes and skydiving but I've stopped on the side of the road by wind farms a couple of times and have been able to get up pretty closely to them.  They're definitely very tall but I don't really think a parachute would be able to do much stopping for you at that height.  Also, I feel as though the blades would be a problem.  If your chute expanded and got caught in them, you wouldn't be in a good spot.  And if you released your chute where the blades weren't a problem, you'd be even closer to the ground, giving your parachute even less time to decelerate you.    I could be completely wrong however."
SweatyPalms,2uu511,gimli2,7,Fri Feb 6 01:22:49 2015 UTC,They vary in height. The biggest towers dwarf the smaller ones.
SweatyPalms,2uu511,CapnJaques,1 point,Fri Feb 6 01:43:22 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm going to guess these were smaller ones, like I said they were tall but it was a farm of them, there's space restrictions when, especially when you have so many. Also the scale of the people in the picture makes it seem like I've probably only seen small turbines. Perhaps parachutes would be entirely possible.  Edit: I meant that I'm guessing the wind mills I've seen in person were probably small ones, not the one in the picture."
SweatyPalms,2uu511,Jmrwacko,1 point,Fri Feb 6 08:38:33 2015 UTC,"I just did some very brief investigation. It looks like the taller turbines around 135 m, so 440ish feet. No idea if that's enough height for an emergency chute."

SweatyPalms,2uu511,DanAtkinson,2,Thu Feb 12 23:08:45 2015 UTC,They were only 80m up. This ain't Battlefield.
SweatyPalms,2uu511,DanAtkinson,2,Mon Mar 2 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"This was my thought...there has to be some emergency escape plan...I'm sure some sort of parachute rig has to work at that height...I mean, I've seen videos of people base jumping from a structure in a couple of theme parks..surely the wind turbines are way higher than any of them. Even if it's a risky jump, it has to be better to try than the alternative of falling without one or burning alive right?"

As far as I can tell an especially strong gust knocked him and his chute pretty hard.  The chute rips and the cords snap at pretty much the exact same moment.  I imagine it has more to do with the integrity of the chute than the strong gust though.  The initial opening probably puts far more stress on it than anything afterward.   *(All uninformed speculation btw)"

SweatyPalms,2sgb7y,Milkshakes00,-8,Thu Jan 15 11:04:34 2015 UTC,So it's safe...it's like being in a plane and looking out the window.  Does that make your palms sweat?
SweatyPalms,2sgb7y,c-fox,8,Thu Jan 15 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, Mr. Badass. This is exactly like looking out the window of a plane."
SweatyPalms,2sgb7y,MadDetective,10,Sat Jan 31 02:05:56 2015 UTC,"You fall with a safety harness you're still in serious danger.  If you fall unconscious or are otherwise incapable of climbing back up the harness itself can kill you because it'll prevent blood from flowing back up into your body, which will cause you to die, this takes about 15 minutes.  The safety harness's lanyard is about 6 feet, and he's tied off near his feet so I'd say he'd fall about maybe 10 feet, and hitting that that hard steel all the way down could cause a concussion or if a body part gets caught in the steel it can snap it, if it's your head then that's going to leave you crippled or dead.  Yeah you won't hit the ground (assuming the harness doesn't fail) but it's by no means safe.  I work in safety harness's everyday, I've been well trained on fall safety. Harnesses are a last resort. Falling in a harness is like getting in a real bad wreck with a seat belt on. Yeah, the seat belt might save you, but you're not likely walking away unscathed."
SweatyPalms,2sgb7y,Moikle,3,Sat Jan 31 02:15:12 2015 UTC,why not use a cord with some stretch then? people falling on lead climbs don't suffer like that.
SweatyPalms,2sgb7y,MadDetective,3,Sun Feb 8 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"The differences in climbing a manmade structure that was designed to be strong and light than climbing a rock wall that gives you a lot of leeway on where you actually tie off and how far you fall as well as the equipment available to you (since you're not climbing to work, you're climbing for the sake of climbing) is massive."

It zoomed it to watch the guy fall to his eventual death (you couldn't really tell because he fell out of view, but you could just tell that the parachute didn't deploy)"
SweatyPalms,2pkuw8,UndBeebs,2,Mon Jan 19 17:50:42 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why they had to cut it?
SweatyPalms,2pkuw8,Oseirus,-2,Sat Jan 31 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really remember all that well, but I think it's because they wouldn't have been able to land with him dangling, and there was no way of pulling him back in (for some reason), so it was a 'work or die' type situation."
SweatyPalms,2pkuw8,TwerpOco,3,Sat Jan 31 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"I think you're remembering wrong. Unless that country's military REALLY doesn't care about their personnel, they wouldn't just let a man die. Never mind having to explain that to the guy's family.  In a helicopter they would have attempted a landing with him hanging before even considering cutting the cord. If nothing else they would drift low, hover with him a few harmless feet above the ground/water, then cut the cord. Even then, he could probably still correct himself and land standing up. He would have to be unconscious, SEVERELY injured, or tangled to the point of immobility before they just dropped him.   If they were in an airplane, the static line attaches well inside of the aircraft. A couple burly dudes could pull him back in. If the line releases while they're pulling him, then it would deploy his chute. If the chute's screwed, he has a backup. Again, the only way he would be in trouble is if he was unconscious, badly tangled, or severely injured.  The short of it all is that an event like this, while uncommon, isn't unheard of. There are regulations and procedures that specifically address pretty much every conceivable problem that can arise from parachuting. This guy probably woke up the next morning in his own bed, just sore as hell and bruised like he'd been mugged."
SweatyPalms,2pkuw8,UndBeebs,0,Sun Feb 1 15:21:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. Though I'm almost positive the guy died. His parachute never deployed in the video, and I can't see him surviving a fall from that height. I could be wrong, but I doubt he survived. If you can find a source for this or clarify my mistakes, please do. I don't want to be misinforming people. :)"

Street racing can either be spontaneous or well-planned and coordinated.

Say the ground is made of concrete, a material that does fine under lots of compression. no one cares what happens to the concrete.   You're made of mushy meat and fragile bones. The ground's force upon you (over a very short period of time, high impact) is the one we care about."
