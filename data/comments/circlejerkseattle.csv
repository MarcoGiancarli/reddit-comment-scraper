Pretty much anytime I see the name Careless now, I feel irritated.

This guy is an idiot.    careless: Warning: Your submission was removed from /r/Seattle for breaking the rules. Rule #3: Don't spam: SEO and spam posts will be removed. Rule #6: We're a community, not a bulletin board or marketplace. You may not use us to increase the popularity, profit, or market presence of a personal project. Advertising info for /r/Seattle. Please make a note of it and do not break the rules of /r/Seattle in the future. Thank you.  Me: Wtf. In no way am I affiliated with this guy. I'm not doing SEO or any of the shit you just claimed. Still remove posts for no reason whstsoever. Cool man. Soooo cool. I broke no rules. You're a dick.  careless It doesn't matter if you're affiliated with Billy or not - and we have zero way of verifying whether you've never met him or you're his best buddy. This video was posted four times in one day and we've removed all of them; this isn't a sub about Seattle rappers or musicians. It's about ""News and Current Events"" If you can find a news article or blog post on a reputable site about this guy's video, you can post a link to that. Think about it this way: if we let this video on /r/Seattle, why shouldn't we let every band with a video post it on here? Do you know how many bands there are in Seattle looking to get some free publicity? Lots and lots. The sub would be nothing but these posts in short order if we permitted them.  Me Your argument is extremely weak. Austin has a bigger music scene than Seattle, is their sub riddled with bands? No. Sorry for posting something Seattle related in the Seattle subreddit. It's supposed to be about everything Seattle, not just what you say.  careless: is their sub riddled with bands? No. Agreed! I just reviewed the top 100 posts on /r/Austin and didn't see a single music video. I sent a message to their mod team asking explicitly if music videos are permitted to be posted there, and I will let you know what I hear when I receive a response. So.... if /r/austin doesn't permit music videos... what then? Does my argument hold more water at that point?  Me: Your argument holds the least amount of water possible. I'll be willing to bet you stepping down as /r/Seattle mod that they do allow postings. Austin is just one example. You need to seriously consider how you are running this subreddit. Mods aren't necessarily loved all the time, but dude you are hated because of the way you arbitrarily delete posts based on little to no evidence. You need to just chill and let ALL Seattle related material to be posted.  careless:  Well, it doesn't sound like you're willing to have a rational discussion about this, and that's too bad. How about this point? Billy is selling stuff. Therefore this video is an advertisement. Don't believe me? He's got the following linked on this youtube page: His website His twitter His iTunes page His producer's website One more website for someone else You, Billy and everyone else are welcome to buy an advertisement on /r/Seattle, but we're not giving anyone free advertising.  Me: What rational discussion is there to be had? You are clinging to this weak ass argument about promotion. If he posted the video, I can understand your reasoning, but he didnt. Posting news articles promotes those news sites. They make money by the number of site visits. We clearly drive traffic to them, so are they going to be banned as well? Not to mention the things to do this week thread. Promotion of those businesses and events for free without buying ad space. Hypocritical much? I'll pick apart your flawed logic all day long man. You just can't admit that you're wrong.  careless: If he posted the video, I can understand your reasoning, but he didnt. And how the hell do you suggest that we check that?  Me: Using your brain. He has a reddit account, /u/billythefridge . So, going by your argument, if he truly is trying to promote himself on the site, why would he use any other name except for billythefridge? That is the user name everyone knows him by. Celebrities post things all the time... using their own account. Not ghost accounts. Do I need to list any examples? Furthermore, if you go through my post history, you would clearly be able to fathom that I have no affiliation with this guy whatsoever. Both of these things I listed take mere seconds to think about and understand clearly. Any more brain busters? I love that you refuse to admit that you're wrong. Fucking ridiculous."

He is basically saying music videos are not allowed because of how many bands that would want to promote on /r/seattle. Let's take a look at /r/austin, another big music city, is their sub nothing but bands' music videos? Nope.   Edit 5:00pm - Is it unsporting behavior to post the messages back and forth between careless and I? I'm eating his argument to the bone and he's adamant in standing behind his terribly flawed logic."

You sound like another uneducated, failed product of an underfunded education system.  transit system funded by income taxes   This is how every developed nation in the world funds transit. You're belligerently uneducated and ignorant on taxes and public goods/services/transit programs and development.  Pro tip: don't talk about things you have no understanding of.  You're too uneducated to understand the taxes are what pay for civilized society. Public schools, roads, advanced transit, are public goods and services, paid for by public funds. It's sad that you need this explained to you. I suppose you like trailing the rest of the developed world with crumbling infrastructure, bloated household debt, and failing public education and healthcare?  You're too incompetent to grasp the basics of public goods and political economy, so you respond with ""derp derp socialism"" like some half-literate joke.  You don't know what democracy in action means - it happens locally. Congress has been voting down infrastructure investments for thirty years and continue to do so. Because according to you, paying for transit is SOCIALISM - a word you don't even understand. Stop backpedaling and deflecting - you don't understand how and why our infrastructure is the worst on the developed world. You make excuses and blindly claim ""it's not that bad!"" because you have nothing intelligent to contribute and no research on the topic.  According to you, taxes = socialism. You have no argument. You're done here.  All you've stated is that ""infrastructure, healthcare and education"" are being dealt with. You don't deal in facts, you deal on illiterate, uniformed posturing without any logic or evidence.  Wake up. Do your home work.

It's hilarious.  R/Seattle - again, is furthering it's typical anti-labor, anti-progressive, anti-understanding-basic-history circle jerk. I've been downvoted for stating basic facts about the history of the labor movement - something r/Seattle doesn't seem to have any education on.  Seattle has no ghetto - plain and simple. It has placed that aren't upper-middle class - which is what native Seattleites fear and think are ""ghetto.""  This isn't any evidence, or reasoning, for your emotional opposition. If anything, city council members are networking with corporate cronies and not speaking to or with constituents enough - unlike Sawant.You have no evidence of her being a Leninist - citation, please.

Possibly a sunset, can't tell from the 1904 IG filter Environmentalist click bait Sunset photo Hiking photo Click bait news about your neighborhood Earthquake question (useless, but it hasn't been asked in a few months) Insect video Springtime photo Angry natives news article Dumb traffic question (ok, a second dumb question) Low effort driving school question Environmentalist click bait Click bait news about bros in your neighborhood   Photos clearly outnumber dumb questions 3 to 1, so I don't understand the problem. Should we add more photos and click bait news?"
circlejerkseattle,34tszy,ChosenRyan36,5,Mon May 4 14:50:24 2015 UTC,"Photos clearly outnumber dumb questions 3 to 1   I'm really worried that with this little amount of sunset photos, an event post might somehow find its way into the front page. Can we please instate a daily minimum of at least 50 sunset photos? Maybe more more clickbait news to spice things up as well. I think this would help make /r/Seattle the vision that all subscribers want it to be."

I bet this would've been one of the most popular posts of the day if careless didn't delete it.  So, yes this is a small business promoting themselves. But isn't this ""news and current events?"" Where do we draw the line? Technically the NFL is a business and we let them dominate the front page at a certain time of year. Microsoft and Amazon are businesses too. So is whatever restaurants and bars we prefer and submit to this subreddit. Bottom line is, just about everything can be seen as an advertisement or promotion depending on your point of view, and the mods use this rule to cherry-pick what stays and what goes.  Here is a super complicated solution to this problem that probably won't make sense to most people: LET OUR UPVOTES AND DOWNVOTES DECIDE! If we don't like the news or spam or question or sunset pic, a couple downvotes will bury it. If we like it, regardless of the personal opinions of certain mods, it'll be seen as ""news and current events"" worth spreading.  I hope this brand new idea about letting upvotes and downvotes decide makes sense to you guys. I realize it is a complicated concept to grasp."

It is too bad Seattle has had a ""remote, small city"" attitude for most of its existence. NIMBYs here refused to accept that Seattle wasn't a ""secret"" or their own little hometown anymore. The tax system is regressive and outdated and can't support a functioning, modern, forward-thinking 21st major city. Even in /r/Seattle there are feuds between local xenophobes that hate all other major cities and refuse to accept what needs to happen for Seattle to work as a modern major city."

But you're obviously ignorant on the topic. Most of western and Northern Europe is seeing a surge in white-nationalist political and social movements, with tinged of xenophobic, neo-Nazi-esque elements.  So you've only ever lived in Greater Seattle and Portland? It's a pretty big PNW metro bubble. When people live in other cities with different benefits and cultural aspects, it's easy for them to not enjoy the differences encountered in Seattle.  Your point is uninformed and you're ignorant."

circlejerkseattle,32a3v8,JohnnyPositiveKarma,2,Sun Apr 12 04:46:50 2015 UTC,I find it hilarious that a guy who's a mod in a circlejerk community that frequently references someone as Hitler didn't understand the concept of a combo breaker circlejerk post. Lest we pretend that it could ever have been taken seriously by anyone and not as meta parody.  I see why grodin left for a while.
circlejerkseattle,32a3v8,fissurebung,0,Sun Apr 12 05:39:28 2015 UTC,"Listen, if it upsets you so much I will restore the posting. I don't want to be a condescending mod and emulate careless.  For the record, I've been against Hitler references from the start. If for no other reason than it portrays this sub negatively. I already cleaned up the sidebar after consulting with the other mods (perhaps a note there is a good idea,) and some mods have begun removing them as well. Honestly, you don't really find genocidal thugs carting humans like cattle to their deaths to be funny in any way, do you?   There's fun and parody (even poorly done attempts, like mine) and then there's stooping to levels where we don't want this sub to go. I'm not saying that was your intent at all, just let's all keep it within the bounds of good taste, OK?  Nevertheless, I'm not the only mod here, and I certainly don't want to be in the business of removing posts and ignoring users or calling people jerks and trolls like careless does. If you still feel it was unfair to have it removed, let me know and I'll restore it.  Now, go and find something creative and hilarious to post :)  P.S. I have no idea why grodin left for a while, I generally like him, so I can't comment."
circlejerkseattle,32a3v8,dontneedsplainin,3,Sun Apr 12 06:18:50 2015 UTC,"The joke was in bad taste maybe, but there was zero public discussion before this post was removed.  A little ironic, considering that's exactly the kind of shit we have a problem with on /r/Seattle.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
circlejerkseattle,32a3v8,fissurebung,2,Sun Apr 12 06:41:54 2015 UTC,"What are you saying, there needs to be a public discussion every time someone posts something ? What if it was a doxx or child porn? Not all users are online all the time to discuss, by the time you give a day or two for a public discussion the point is moot and removal is too late and there's no point.  I think the mods here handle it pretty well. The proper thing to do is remove potentially offending or illegal content as it is noticed then discuss and be open to listening to the user. In this case, the user was informed, there was an (amicable) discussion, and the mod listened, didn't call names, and  even restored the post, though I personally find it kind of borderline.  Had this been /r/seattle with /u/careless, all interaction with the user would have been completely ignored, /u/zomboi would have sent an arrogant reply after the 10th message to mods asking why, any concerns would been ridiculed and dismissed, and the user given zero warning and shadow banned."
circlejerkseattle,32a3v8,dontneedsplainin,2,Sun Apr 12 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"Riiiiight, cause we are talking about child porn here. ◔_◔   The proper thing to do is remove potentially offending or illegal content   Illegal content, yes. But a fucking historical picture of holocaust train used in a joke on a circlejerk sub offends you? Did you know what sub you are on? Don't let the door hit you on your way out to /r/aww.   Had this been /r/Seattle ...   Yes, this post was restored and that's more than I expect from /r/Seattle mods. But unilaterally removing a post just because they were ""offended"" is exactly the kind of thing I expect from /r/Seattle mods."
circlejerkseattle,32a3v8,fissurebung,2,Sun Apr 12 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, you want to have a 3 day ""public discussion"" every time someone decides to post something the mods find objectionable, what's the point of removing afterwards then?  ""historical"" LOL, cut the crap okay, I didn't say it ""offends"" me personally, no one said it personally ""offended"" them, not even the mod. I said ""borderline"" and I can see how bringing a picture of people being led to slaughter to that sequence of posts can be considered low-effort and in bad taste. I think the mod acted very reasonably by discussing it with the OP, which is more than I can say had it been the other sub you'd have already been shadowbanned. In case you haven't noticed it's circlejerkSEATTLE, a seattle parody sub, not anything goes no matter how sick or irrelevant. Read the sidebar for what this sub is about, there are specific guidelines for keeping even criticism of careless on point.  And, don't be a dick. You've made your point, I suggest you don't go on to tell people what to do or where to be. r/aww, right... If you don't like it, don't let the door hit you on your way out to 4chan. I'm sure you'll be a lot happier there."
circlejerkseattle,32a3v8,JohnnyPositiveKarma,2,Sun Apr 12 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"3 day ""public discussion""   Yes, because that's exactly what I said. Come on.   Read the sidebar for what this sub is about, there are specific guidelines for keeping even criticism of careless on point.   Somebody removed something because in their opinion ""a line was crossed."" What line? There's no defined rule about nazi comparisons. If there was, removal would be appropriate. And if you think that rule needs to be put in place, go ahead and suggest that. But that rule does not exist now and for one person to remove this because they decided that it ""offends"" them, I think that's shitty.  It doesn't look like there was anyone publicly calling for the thread to be taken down. Was there mod mail discussing it? That might make things a little different if there was. But it looks like the decision of one person to me.  Starting to remove stuff for ""poor taste"" is a terrible precedent. So what if OP wants to Godwin the thread?  Achtung! bearbeiten: Uh oh.

(eg shocking and/or surrealist humor) It's amusing to me that you removed the post because it was in poor taste when that was almost the entire point. Explaining a bad joke makes it worse, but: everyone makes fun of the original coal train post by posting fairly innocuous plays on the phrase, to the point of overdoing it, so I Norm MacDonald it by throwing in the nonjoke. Coal train = train full of combustible material = train full of people burned alive by the nazis. It's in no way funny, but in its discomfort it makes obvious how stupid the entire concept is. Like any airplane joke, the only way to win is to reference 9/11 or (insert recent aircrash here). Too bad everyone's ""edgy"" now so making an actual shocking joke just comes across as tryharding :(  You probably knew all this, but I don't want you to think I'm pissed at you or whatever.
