Do you HAVE to use those words to make the joke funny? No. It's purely for shock value. They don't add to the joke but they do force a reaction whether they like the joke or not. That's why lots of comics do it, they'd rather you hate the joke than not care for it.   IMO this could be an ok joke if you found a funnier thing to call the kids. ""Retarded"" and ""faggot"" aren't just offensive they're lazy and unimaginative. A middle schooler could have wrote that. Instead think of something ONLY YOU would think of to call a kid.   ""you call one kid a 'brat faced shit digging pullout fail' and they send in the swat team"" I mean that's still not good, but at least it's not something you'd see on %30 of all middle school facebook pages  Edit: and if the joke is that people OVER-react shouldn't the insult be super NONE-offensive? Shouldn't they send the swat team after you called him ""decent at math"". JUST DECENT?!?! YOU NEED TO TELL HIM HE'S AMAZING OR HE'LL GET DEPRESSED AND NEVER TRY IN LIFE! or something idk"

standupshots,3dqpza,busterfixxitt,55,Sat Jul 18 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"I really like the joke; one of the best I've seen on here.  I would try to make the punchline less wordy.    ""Nobody was going to date the kid with a fucking bell around his neck.  ..thanks mom and dad""  But it's your joke, say it however the fuck you want."
standupshots,3dqpza,EverybodysPoop,15,Sat Jul 18 23:02:17 2015 UTC,one of the best I've seen on here.   Really? How long have you been on here? This is a pretty basic joke.
standupshots,3dqpza,Vozamarak,13,Sat Jul 18 15:51:32 2015 UTC,You gotta start out with a compliment before you give criticism.  /u/EverybodysPoop was probably trying to be nice
standupshots,3dqpza,FunkCitrus,5,Sat Jul 18 19:23:30 2015 UTC,Basic but good.  IMO a lot of jokes on here are pretty lackluster...
standupshots,3dqpza,Hesher1,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"By dropping the fact that he had a bell on his neck, there's no point in adding ""thanks mom and dad"" as an afterthought. You've already gotten to the punchline."

standupshots,3dqpza,TDenverFan,5,Sun Jul 19 07:06:18 2015 UTC,Bells never stopped my cats from killing things.

standupshots,3dqpza,scrammbling,3,Sat Jul 18 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"So in other words you put the bell on it and its response was, ""Challenge accepted."""
standupshots,3dqpza,Angam23,2,Sun Jul 19 01:27:40 2015 UTC,It makes them better hunters supposedly. They get even stealthier to counteract the noise.
standupshots,3dqpza,Leeham721,9,Sun Jul 19 08:07:43 2015 UTC,"I thought it was going to be something like being fat was warning bell, this was unexpected and funny."
standupshots,3dqpza,bidnasman,2,Sun Jul 19 03:11:47 2015 UTC,"This is why feral cows can only eat grass, they can't sneak up on their natural prey, the wild goose.  Luckily people have been harvesting them for their musical capabilities, reducing overpopulation of geese while at the same time letting the cows enjoy their instinctual hunt, all the while providing the world with musical masterpieces."
standupshots,3dqpza,notgayinathreeway,5,Sat Jul 18 16:04:21 2015 UTC,You are solidly and reliably funny.

standupshots,3dqpza,dukck,2,Sat Jul 18 21:13:39 2015 UTC,TIL why cat collars have bells
standupshots,3dqpza,YcleptJohn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"i put a collar with a small bell (think tinkle, tinkle) on the neck of my youngest. He had decided to stalk and hunt my 2 older kitties. The tinkling of his little bell ruined his surprise attacks for the most part. Now, a year or so later i took his collar off. He calmed down and realized the other 2 cats always knew he was coming and always knew he was there. His kitten attacks dwindled and have now stopped. He is a large cat, long tall and lean. The others are smaller than him but take zero shit where at first he had them shaken pretty bad. The bell has enabled us to have a happy cat famiry."
standupshots,3dyhjy,laughsofficial,4,Mon Jul 20 15:52:06 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm dumb but this doesn't seem to make sense out of context
standupshots,3dyhjy,StupidSexyConnor,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:11 2015 UTC,Yeah it's part of a longer joke where that line is used in a movie. It definitely doesn't make sense out of context.
standupshots,3dyhjy,ZombieHeyHeyHeyHeyOh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"Which sucks, 'cause it sees like it would've been funny. I might've watched this bit once actually. Damn you, lacking context!"
standupshots,3dq15m,charliespeez,9,Sat Jul 18 09:28:49 2015 UTC,Feels unfinished
standupshots,3dq15m,RajaKS,14,Sat Jul 18 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"My onstage follow up is ""and then, when they bagged the body, they asked his family 'paper or plastic.'""   But that feels too fucked up when I write it out."

standupshots,3dsoii,patrickstomlinson,-2,Sun Jul 19 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"You can lose the whole line after ""Really"" and so straight into the ""what if...""   However the independence day joke is pretty weak.  First when you say independence day, people will immediately think you're referring to the revolutionary war. It will take a second for people to piece together youre talking about the movie. You confuse things even more with the ""E.T."" protest sign because you're now mentioning two different movies in the same punchline.  And finally your last line doesn't add anything to the joke, it's just reiterating the point.   I will say the setup has potential. There's something there with that bumper sticker.  This just isn't it."
standupshots,3dsoii,BLUMPKIN_RECIPIENT,4,Sun Jul 19 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think repetition helps the setup. I immediately thought of the movie. Nobody really says ""Independence Day"" when they're talking about the revolutionary war.   And ET is a standard name for an alien. People won't get lost in his multiple references. Some people will actually dig it more because of that."
standupshots,3dsoii,BLUMPKIN_RECIPIENT,-3,Sun Jul 19 20:57:48 2015 UTC,sorry you have such a tone deaf ear for what makes good comedy
