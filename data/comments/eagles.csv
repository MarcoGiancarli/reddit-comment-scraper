eagles,3e17s1,TheMeta88,29,Tue Jul 21 04:18:12 2015 UTC,Calling it now: Hiicks will have a better career than Smith III.
eagles,3e17s1,Robert_Goulet,9,Tue Jul 21 04:31:06 2015 UTC,I doubt that. For one Smith has a much better chance of starting than Hicks has.  And while Smith may not have the raw athleticism Hicks has he definitely has plenty to win in his own way. And he is still a great athlete in his own right. He's apparently very smooth in coverage which is needed at OLB.  And we have the perfect scheme for him to thrive in.  I think if he is just able to hold his own against the rigors of going against NFL caliber strength then he will be just fine.  He has the intangibles and the measurables to do it. He just had to add some much needed strength and reports indicate he has done that this off-season.
eagles,3e17s1,Robert_Goulet,3,Tue Jul 21 04:50:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not so much putting down Smith in any way, I actually think he will contribute for sure. For some reason I feel like a somewhat forgotten 3rd round LB pick turns into a stud for some teams. It just feels like we've been very high on LB draft picks over the years that never really panned out, but no one seems as excited for Hicks, hence he will develop nicely. Dunno, just my hunch."
eagles,3e17s1,FuckingHippies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:00:51 2015 UTC,Outperforming your draft slot doesn't mean better career.
eagles,3e17s1,Halfonion,2,Tue Jul 21 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"Hicks will have a chance to earn a starting spot next season based off his play this year. We all know chip would love to have him replace Kendricks rather than sign him to a big deal. Smith has Barwin and Graham in front of him. One has to go down in order to get time to prove himself. Also remember smith inst a chip Kelly guy, that was all Roseman."
eagles,3e17s1,msaltveit,4,Tue Jul 21 05:12:15 2015 UTC,"Also remember smith inst a chip Kelly guy, that was all Roseman.   That's horseshit. The only problem Chip had with the pick in my opinion is that he felt it was a reach. They really hammered home the point this off-season that they will always take the best player available for them.  Howie feared a rush on pass rushers and took him earlier than Chip wanted.  But it's not like Chip was disgusted that the guy was on the draft board.  He was a guy they all wanted. It was a question of when.   We all know chip would love to have him replace Kendricks rather than sign him to a big deal.   This is more or less debunked in the OP but if that's what you believe then fine."
eagles,3e17s1,msaltveit,3,Tue Jul 21 05:16:29 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why you're so sure that Chip loved Marcus Smith II.  The scuttlebutt I hear is that he isn't showing football intelligence, which is something that Chip values and should have been flushed out in pre-draft research.  Certainly his huge mistake in the 49ers game (leaving Gore open for an easy game-winning touchdown) is evidence of that."
eagles,3e17s1,Halfonion,2,Tue Jul 21 07:09:19 2015 UTC,"Chip was high on him when they drafted him.   We obviously selected Marcus Smith with the 26th pick.  Think he's an outstanding athlete.  He actually got recruited to Louisville as a quarterback.  [Louisville head coach Charlie] Strong had seen him in a football camp, and he went to Louisville. I talked to Charlie the other week about him and he just gave us rave reviews.  He's a big kid.  He transitioned to the outside linebacker position. I think he has a huge upside.  He's a very, very good athlete.  He's over 6'3"", in the 250, 255 pound range, ran 4.68, He's got speed coming off the edge.  We thought adding a pass rusher was a big thing for us.  I think a young kid to bring in behind Trent [Cole] and Connor [Barwin] and those guys can teach him the ropes and bring him along and show him what we can do.  But I think his ceiling is very, very high.  We're excited.  He's a tough, hardâ€‘nosed football player.  A little bit new to the position.  Maybe a similar situation to Lane [Johnson] in terms of you're getting a guy that is a huge upside because he hasn't played the position that long. They played multiple defenses there.  He's played with his hand on the ground, he's played standing up.  He can drop into coverage, he can rush the quarterback.  We're excited about adding him.  The fact that we could move back a little bit and pick up another pick because we were short in what we think is a good draft, we felt is a great situation for us.      Q. Was he the best available guy? Was there a tier and you looked at that spot and thought let's get an outside linebacker?  CHIP KELLY:  He was the next guy for us and what we felt was we could move back and pick up a pick, but we didn't want to move back too far because we didn't know if he was going to be gone.  So you kind of hold your breath when you go from 22 to 26 as the next pick went.  Then we were really nervous with someone actually trying to get in front of us when Dee Ford went right after us, because he's another pass rusher.  Then obviously it's very, very difficult to find pass rushers.  We were afraid there was going to be a run on them.  So that's why we set our feet at 26 and didn't think we could move back any farther because we weren't sure we were going to get him.   I suppose there is a chance that that was just PR I just don't buy into the narrative that Chip was vehemently against this pick or wanted nothing to do with it. Too much time goes into scouting for someone to be on the board without the others consent. Or shit who knows, maybe that is exactly why the change happened but I still don't think that is the case with Marcus.  He's a great scheme fit with upside.   The scuttlebutt I hear is that he isn't showing football intelligence,   I'm not exactly sure what that means. Does football intelligence relate to actual football IQ or is it more instincts? Regardless, he was apparently a football idiot to the tune of 14.5 sacks in his final year in college.  And I just don't think he is dumb. As Chip mentions he played in multiple defenses in college and multiple roles and survived. Takes brains to do that.   Certainly his huge mistake in the 49ers game (leaving Gore open for an easy game-winning touchdown) is evidence of that.   And Josh Huff dropped some passes and fumbled some balls.  HANG THAT MAN!  No they're all rookies who make mistakes. Too Josh Huff's credit he did show more potential on the field than Marcus Smith did last year and that has been the cause for excitement but I still think Smith can be good with another year of the system under his belt and added bulk.  Tommy Lawlor also has good things to say about him.  http://igglesblitz.com/2014/04/case-marcus-smith/  And this speaks to his intelligence and maturity and how he has handled this off-season.  http://igglesblitz.com/2015/02/marcus-sounds-smart/"
eagles,3e17s1,Mattsasse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks.  Huff is an interesting comparison.  I looked it up because Chip has a history of not punishing rookies for one mistake (eg DAT's 2 fumbles vs. LSU in 2011). He played both Huff and Marcus for a couple of games after their big mistakes. Huff was on and off and played (or practiced) his way back into the rotation.  Chip said directly that Marcus didn't show consistency in practice which is why he didn't get back on the field except after a big rash of injuries."
eagles,3e17s1,dudewheresmykarma8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:48 2015 UTC,Which has largely chalked up to his lack of strength.  Now he's added 15 pounds and should be able to hold his own against NFL tackles...hopefully.  I don't think his problems were mental. I think he just needed to bulk up to get ready to face off against NFL tackles and be able to set the edge etc.  They've said he's flashed this year and last year. He has the ability. He just needed the strength to be consistent.  Now he reportedly has it.
eagles,3e17s1,brunoquadrado,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:30 2015 UTC,"Normally a first round pick gets many chances to suceseed and that's why I got to believe chip is less than thrilled with smith. Hicks will undoubtedly get more playing time than smith did as a rookie and I have no doubt that if he performs well enough he will let kendicks walk (unless kendricks takes big steps towards stardom in the last year of his deal, That includes staying healthy)."
eagles,3e17s1,Haasmaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:47:59 2015 UTC,Smith has a better chance starting this year due to numbers ahead of them but long term it seems like Hicks has the better Chance.  Barwin and Graham are locked up a lot longer than the ILB core.

eagles,3e17s1,PhillyEagle,8,Tue Jul 21 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"Very good post.  I think Hicks doesn't get much conversation just because people expect a quality backup.  He'll make the team, and has a chance to start in a year or two, but the top 3 are so good, he's just an extra guy for now.    The draft ire was more on position than player.  It was just that they just traded for Kiko to shore up the position.  Meanwhile, you cut your starting RG, S, and both corners.  Imagine if the Eagles had taken T.J. Yeldon in the 2nd, or even Melvin Gordon in the first.  Nobody would argue they weren't worth the pick, but after addressing the position, there's other holes to fill.  Add in that they traded the 4th for a 3rd next year (to assuage the loss from trading for Bradford), and the next pick you get is in the 6th (not historically the best round for talent), and Hicks is a victim of ""but we could have had a lineman/safety/QB/etc."""
eagles,3e17s1,RewindByChance,3,Tue Jul 21 05:33:17 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I still think the Hicks pick is great though, and JaCorey Shepard has a chance to be special. His tape from Kansas is impressive and he has elite instincts at his position. This draft was just a good one for the Eagles. The Eagles quietly have stocked up at corner too this offseason. I can see them having 4 potential starting caliber players at the position."
eagles,3e17s1,msaltveit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:37:32 2015 UTC,I agree with you on JaCorey Shepherd.  I think he's going to be the big steal from this draft when you look at it in 3-4 years.  I think he's going to be a close to top tier CB.
eagles,3e17s1,thedude009,0,Tue Jul 21 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"I like what I've seen from Shepherd.  I'm not knocking the player when I say the 6th is not historically good for talent, just that plenty of 6th round picks get cut by the end of the summer."

eagles,3e17s1,msaltveit,3,Tue Jul 21 04:47:14 2015 UTC,"Good analysis.  I'm not sure how many beats are confounded, though. It's pretty clear that he's penciled in as a Demeco replacement, once Demeco has had a chance to tutor him for a year or two.  The general assumption is that this year Ryans will play on running downs -- assuming he's fully healed in time for game 1 -- and that Kendricks will come in on 3rd, or when matchups require.  Good point on special teams -- one of the reasons Chip prefers the 3-4 is to have more linebackers, who are naturally better ST players."
eagles,3e17s1,msaltveit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:14:56 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure if Kendricks would be better on 3rd down than Kiko.  Or are saying we will stay in base on 3rd downs?
eagles,3e17s1,msaltveit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:47 2015 UTC,"I think he meant Kendricks would come in for Meco, not Kiko.  Edit: so, yes, base. Chip seemed to favor base more year 2 than year 1 (if I'm not mistaken)"
eagles,3e17s1,msaltveit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:19 2015 UTC,Yeah def.  I think that's why he values versatility so much.  You can stay in one defense or personnel setting on offense and still be able to handle or do a lot of different things.
eagles,3e17s1,Colossus__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:03 2015 UTC,I think it would be Kiko and Kendricks on 3rd.
eagles,3e17s1,Buschman98,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how many beats are confounded, though.   Mostly I see people still balking at the price with holes at other areas. I just wanted to explain why the Eagles were willing to invest so heavily in the position.   The general assumption is that this year Ryans will play on running downs -- assuming he's fully healed in time for game 1 -- and that Kendricks will come in on 3rd, or when matchups require.   So in your scenario the Eagles will keep one of the most athletic players on the team on the bench? I doubt that. I believe Kendricks will remain in his role and Kiko will become the Mike. Chip Kelly and Minter have praised his football IQ and instincts. He will be able to call plays and audibles."
eagles,3e17s1,HipGuide,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have a strong opinion myself but I think the knocks on Kendricks would be 1) Chip is clearly pissed he didn't come back from injury sooner last year 2) slightly undersized 3) not much of a playmaker  At Oregon Chip liked to rotate defenders in to keep them fresh, sometimes alternating possessions, which helps offset the wear and tear of tempo on a defense.  I could see Demeco sitting more and more once they find other ILBSs who can wear the headset and make calls, whether it's Kiko or Hicks.  But for whatever reason, the Eagles clearly do not see Kendricks as that guy."
eagles,3e17s1,buzzy27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"3) not much of a playmaker   In two years under Chip DeMeco Ryans has played in 24 games, racked up 172 tackles, four sacks, two interceptions, and one fumble recovery. He was a seven year veteran by the time Chip took over.  The one year he played, Kiko Alonso played in 16 games, racked up 159 tackles, two sacks, four interceptions, and one forced fumble.  In two years under Chip Mychal Kendricks has played in 27 games, racked up 189 tackles, four sacks, three interceptions, and forced five fumbles.  Kendricks IS a playmaker. And if you need more check this out.  http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/article-1/Eagle-Eye-Cox-Kendricks-Dominate/d26cd505-9f19-4ce0-9123-e069bd119136   1) Chip is clearly pissed he didn't come back from injury sooner last year   This one is definitely tricky. We don't have all the information so we don't really know 100% what Chip could be basing this off of but I also wonder if part of the reason is because they really really miss him when he can't play. Not as big of an issue this time around. But just that they really really REALLY feel his loss when he is out and that is what makes it all the more painful.   2) slightly undersized   This one perplexes me a bit. During the pre-draft process Kendricks was listed at 5'11"" 240 and Hicks was 6'1"" 236.  But on Philadelphiaeagles.com Kendricks is listed at 6'0"" 240 and Hicks is 6'1"" 236.  In either case, the difference is one to two inches and Chip is on record saying he tends to factor in weight more than height.  It's not really like cornerback where Boykin, 5'10"" 185, stayed inside while Fletcher, 6'0"" 200, stayed on the outside. On top of that, Fletcher possessed the length the Eagles crave on the outside while Hicks and Kendricks don't seem very far apart in that regard.  But Mychal isn't worried about his size.   I am the new prototype.   .   the Eagles clearly do not see Kendricks as that guy.   The one weakness in his game is him as a play-caller and calling audibles. It's not his strength. He may not be bad at it but guys like Ryans, Alonso, and Hicks are all better. They just do not think his best role is at Mike. They want him to just go out there and play. But he does call it in dime and nickel packages when Ryans came off the field. Hm. There we go talking about needing players to come off the field again.  Kendricks is a three down linebacker. Alonso is a three down linebacker. Hicks is a three down linebacker. I think if they can they will want to keep all three."
eagles,3e17s1,Zacharoni9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:57 2015 UTC,"Good points and stats.  I think it's clear Demeco's on a phase out glidepath, to mentor as well as play.  He's clearly better on running downs, but in other situations Chip seems to like leaving a player in for a series at a time.  And if the other team doesn't sub you may not have  a choice.  If it's by series, does Kiko alternate with DeMeco, or does Kendricks?"

I feel like we're trying to build a strong LB core with many movable pieces. For example, Brandon Graham is a great rusher. On an obvious passing down, we send him rushing instead of covering a TE - that's where Hicks steps in, seeing as how Mufasa isn't athletic enough to cover a TE and Kendricks (as Chip believes) isn't tall enough. Hicks is a great pick who has the body and athleticism to learn multiple skills from talented veterans."
eagles,3e17s1,User_Simulator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:27:49 2015 UTC,"It was a good pick. For one, everyone preaches BPA. You have to live it. Secondly, LB is where you truly want to invest in a 3-4. Building a deep, talented unit is what we have seen teams like the 49ers, Steelers, Ravens, etc do and have a lot of success. Thirdly, he is a fantastic athlete (87th percentile of all off LOS LBs). If injury is his only problem he can redshirt this year and be a starter down the road."

eagles,3e3qbt,Shieldz123,4,Tue Jul 21 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"Had to rush this because work.  Here it is.  Forgive Bradford's lack of hands, Romo's lack of arms, and RG3's lack of hands.  I call it: The reason running backs will run the NFCE."
eagles,3e3qbt,Caoa14396,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:01 2015 UTC,Somebody get Jimmy Kempski in here.
eagles,3e3m45,modrewgnu,5,Tue Jul 21 18:21:40 2015 UTC,I think Charles should be the highest rated RB in madden. His YPC every year is just ridiculous behind a bad line.
eagles,3e3m45,Trainwrek,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:50 2015 UTC,I agree imo it should be Kept the same except Charles being first
eagles,3e3m45,IAmtheeOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:43 2015 UTC,"But he doesn't have any power. In the right system he'll put up the bet numbers, but put him in a downhill power run game and he'll struggle. My guess is that as long as you play Charles the way he should be played that he is the best RB in Madden."
eagles,3e3m45,AngrySandyVag,5,Tue Jul 21 18:47:09 2015 UTC,he does have power though
eagles,3e3m45,Samu-ELBradford,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"Not when compared to Peterson or Marshawn. But I feel like Marshawn should also take a hit for his lack of pass catching, so I agree he should be at least as high as Marshawn. Peterson is tough to peg since he is clearly the greatest talent we've had at running back since LT, but the whole not playing thing makes it tough to rank him that way."
eagles,3e3m45,AngrySandyVag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"I understand that he's got the highest speed rating among RB's, but the fact that it's only a 92 is mind-boggling."
eagles,3e3m45,moneymoneymoneymonay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is a lot of what makes him great are his intangible skills like vision and patience, which don't contribute that much to Madden ratings. Obviously he's got other tangible skills too but the best way to put Jamaal Charles in madden is just to take a pretty good running back and just have him be played by the best Madden player ever"
eagles,3e3m45,JACJet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:39 2015 UTC,I guess they re-vamped the whole speed system. Demarco was a 94 spd and Peterson and Charles were 97
eagles,3e3m45,jordex8,3,Tue Jul 21 19:05:30 2015 UTC,I read that Murray has a faster speed rating than LeSean?    That doesn't seem right
eagles,3e3m45,ImTheOnlyChipHere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"I think that's right, both from watching them and their combine 40 times  (DeMarco ran a 4.4 and LeSean ran a 4.5)"
eagles,3e3m45,2fly5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:35:24 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem right but apparently it is.  Just goes to show how deceptive what you see can be...or what you think you see anyway.
eagles,3e3m45,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:00 2015 UTC,Lesean McCoy's acceleration is best in the league but his deep speed doesn't get him any separation. Demarco Murray has more methodical separation but his top end speed is much higher.
eagles,3e4etm,TheSubversive,3,Tue Jul 21 21:40:19 2015 UTC,"I strongly believe that going forward the teams that can effectively run the ball are the ones that are going to have success in the postseason.  The league has been a ""passing league"" too long, so long that it's now a ""pass defending league"" and teams aren't built to stop the run.  In an NFL where secondary's rule, run it for success."

eagles,3e2j14,Logan1565,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:06 2015 UTC,"I have no expectations for this team, but I think they should get into the playoffs."
eagles,3e2j14,pumadude321,4,Tue Jul 21 14:49:41 2015 UTC,My personal expectations remain the same this year. Anything short of a playoff victory is failure in my view.
eagles,3e2j14,Aqua-Tech,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:26 2015 UTC,"Winning the NFC east would still be veiwed as an accomplishment even if we go down like we did in 2013, in a tightly contested WC game. There are plenty of questions marks that surround this team for the expectation to be a playoff victory or bust. Would i be shocked if we make it to the conference campionship game? No, but i think expectations need to be tempered a bit after the major overhaul we had this offseason."
eagles,3e2j14,Halfonion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"Well like I said, those are my personal expectations. Personally, I would not be satisfied simply winning the division this year. It's been 3 years and I expect to see some progress.   The major overhaul is one reason why my expectations are actually higher than in a normal year coming off missing the playoffs the year before. When you cut pro bowlers for ""culture"" reasons I expect the ""culture"" to produce progress."
eagles,3e2j14,Aqua-Tech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah i totally understand, its not that i would'nt be upset if we failed again to win a playoff game. I think im just a little nervous that the unprecssidented overhaul the team had this offseason could lead to this thing blowing up in our faces and being back to square one with no QB and an aging Oline. All it would take is for Murray to go down and Bradford to not play well and this offense, talent wise, would be well below average."
eagles,3e2j14,Halfonion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:27 2015 UTC,We've been a failure since 2008 then.
eagles,3e2j14,neeghairs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"My expectations in 2013 were just to have a good season. Making the playoffs was a bonus. Last year my expectations were to win one playoff game. They failed to even make the playoffs. So my expectations this year are roughly the same as last year,  given the ridiculous unprecidented turnover rate and the whole cutting pro bowlers thing."
eagles,3e2j14,Aqua-Tech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:30 2015 UTC,That's fair and those are my expectations as well. I just wasn't sure if it was your realistic expectation or if it's what he needs to do to justify the moves to you.
eagles,3e2j14,neeghairs,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:05:55 2015 UTC,Expectations change from year to year hope this helps
eagles,3e2j14,bigmeech,3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"No shit, I was trying to pick his brain because he routinely talks about how Chip threw pro bowlers out the window so I was curious if his expectations of the team sans pro bowlers = expectations with them."
eagles,3e2j14,neeghairs,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:35:31 2015 UTC,But chip's first year was not a failure hence my post hope this helps

eagles,3e2j14,MrMoustachio,4,Tue Jul 21 16:07:52 2015 UTC,I'm a cautiously optimistic fan.  I expect us to go at least 8-8 each season.
eagles,3e2j14,Ghstfce,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"I believe we can win the NFC East, I just hope we can stay healthy obviously. The defense definitely seemed to be addressed well too."
eagles,3e0ev0,msaltveit,28,Tue Jul 21 00:13:42 2015 UTC,"This is what kills me. People are crying until the cows come home that we lost a ton of talent but we have drastically improved our defense and really made a lateral move on offense.  We upgraded the defense and retooled on offense.  But we're less talented because the flashy pro-bowlers are gone? PUH-LEASE!  Our defensive backs are better coached and way more athletic now. Our inside linebacking group is much much better now as well. Although funnily enough that weakness has kind of shifted to the outside group. Now at OLB we have 2 very good starters and questions behind them.  But the defensive line is just as strong maybe even stronger. We have more depth in the secondary as well. The only position that was a liability last year that we weren't able to address was safety. But it seems like it has been Walter Thurmond's job to lose so far.  I'm sorry but people want me to be ""realistic"" in their words but the simple truth is ""on paper"" this is a much better team on defense. We stayed the same where we were strongest, D-line. We have a gluttony of options at an area that was once a drought of talent, inside linebacker. We got younger at outside linebacker and saved some money in the process. We overhauled the cornerbacks for the better including adding depth. Again safety is the only concern but Thurmond looks to be shaping up to be a great pick up.  And on offense we are still very strong."
eagles,3e0ev0,TheMeta88,3,Tue Jul 21 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"You know what I'm tired of hearing, how injury prone Murray is. He's SOOOOO injury prone that he's played nearly 90% of the games in his career. (87.5 % to be exact) No it's not as good as McCoy who only missed a few games, but it's not exactly what I would describe as injury prone. He missed 6 games in 2012 but beside that he's only missed a few."
eagles,3e0ev0,mywifeisaninja,6,Tue Jul 21 14:32:23 2015 UTC,"Murray's only injury prone because he doesn't get enough protein. If he maybe ate some more of his meat, he wouldn't miss any games."
eagles,3e0ev0,AnalogDogg,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"On top of that, the people who think McCoy is better for this offense because they think Kelly is running the icecapades out there..  I don't care if McCoy puts up 2000 yards in Buffalo this year.  I care that Murray will pick up the 3rd and 2s that McCoy couldn't.  I care that having Murray very well could have won us the SF and Arizona games last year.  That's what I care about.  Let Shady have his exciting shifty runs.  Give me the back who will pick up the tough yards.  Let him ""leave meat on the bone.""  Get the yards that count.  The ones Shady couldn't."

I remember when the Eagles ""got better"" when they picked up Nnamdi. I remember when the Eagles ""got better"" when they picked up Cary Williams. I'm tired of every year being ""got better"" because they picked up players that haven't played a down for the Eagles. I don't care about losing players, but hyping ones that haven't done anything is annoying."

eagles,3e3jft,ACPhila,2,Tue Jul 21 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"Everyone is so concerned about Bradford's injury history they just completely neglect Foles' injuries...   In 2012 he stepped in for a concussed Vick, broke his hand 6 games later, and Vick played finale. 2013 was his best year, only missing a game and a half due to a concussion, but we still lost the 2 games he was out.. and we all know the story in 2014 when he missed half the season with a broken clavicle.   Not saying Bradford's injury history isn't a concern, but it's not like Foles has made it through a full season yet."
eagles,3e3jft,hellmelee,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:30 2015 UTC,Oh I agree with you. The Eagles traded an injury prone average QB for an injury prone top 10 QB.

Hate to break it to you but most trades that include draft picks dont have the traded players on 4 year contracts. Crazy, i know. A draft pick in a trade is simply added value to a lesser valued player.

eagles,3e07zl,forwardtinker,23,Tue Jul 21 16:45:36 2015 UTC,He has no logical reason to sign a contract now.  Every qb has put up career numbers in Kelly's offense and Sam holds no leverage right now whatsoever.
eagles,3e07zl,Nut_Cancer,8,Mon Jul 20 23:46:08 2015 UTC,It's the Eagles side it doesn't make sense for. A 16m contract would probably be fine but what's the big deal for the eagles waiting a year and making it 18.   Eagles have no reason to sign him right now unless he were to take a big discount contract.
eagles,3e07zl,adv0589,5,Mon Jul 20 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"What's more is if we resign him now and he has a career year, injury issues aside he might feel like he's not getting paid enough if he has a career year, which I'm sure he'll have."

I don't see why it would come to that though, the team will be willing to find a mutually workable deal for him if this works out and in that case why gamble with leaving a team that has resurrected your career?  I'm more worried about a scenario where he looks great but gets injured again at some point.  Then what do we do?"

I'll be totally honest, I think a big reason they retained him is because Trent Cole left and they didn't have much behind him or BG.  Brandon Graham has done a good job but he is not a scheme fit. He is still a liability in coverage and isn't the prototypical 3-4 OLB.  With all that said, the man knows how to pass rush. He has a knack for it. I love seeing him bull rush and toss people. And when he hits someone they feel it. I hope he is very productive but honestly I think the team is really really hoping Marcus Smith shows somethings.  Brandon Graham is not their ideal OLB. But I wish him the best nonetheless!"

He has done everything that has been asked of him every year he's been in the league, and hasn't gotten a lot of playing time because of Trent Cole being in front of him on the depth chart. Watching games on streams isn't the greatest, but from what I've seen of him I think he will be an effective starter for the defense. Sure, he isn't an exact scheme fit, but he does get to the quarterback fairly naturally no matter what scheme he's in and that's exactly what the Eagles need from him. So with him getting more snaps I believe that he is going to have a good year."

But I can gua-an-tee you that we would have about a million people for that parade day, it would dwarf the Phillies championship attendance. I don't buy into the 2 million number, but I would hazard that 300,000 would be a closer number.

eagles,3dyjmo,TheSubversive,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:43 2015 UTC,"I remember the thread that discussed that on r/NFL pointed out that since he stayed healthy he had played a lot more snaps than some of the other guys on the list so it's kind of deceptive to put him as #2 among that group.  Still, he is obviously a very good player with a lot left in the tank."
eagles,3dyjmo,furiousxgeorge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:43:19 2015 UTC,"That stat is total disruptions over 3 years.  The only thing that really matters for the discussion is what the distribution was.  If he had 8 disruptions, 8 disruptions, and 25 last year, it would suggest that last year was an exceptional year for him, and maybe we should temper our expectations.  If he had 13 disruptions a year, that would suggest he is consistently getting work done.  That statistic unfortunately doesn't mean anything without context, other than that Barwin has been very productive over a 3 year span."

For current Eagles, I'd say Barwin as others have or possibly Sproles on offense. I still really like Sproles as a S/T threat of course, and I don't expect a precipitous decline in playing ability, I just figured he might get less touches this season and see a decline in production as a result."
eagles,3dyjmo,DisplayofCharacter,7,Mon Jul 20 17:11:16 2015 UTC,"Sproles only had 57 carries last season. How many few can you really expect him to have? I actually expect him to have more catches. He only had 40 last year and the previous three years, he averaged 77."
eagles,3dyjmo,root88,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:06 2015 UTC,Maclin will do just fine. He excels at intermediate routes. Keep it in the 15-20 range and Alex Smith will drop it on a dime.  If it bounces off the checkdown players helmet and travels an additional 17 yards in the air.

eagles,3dyjmo,undeadfred95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, he was a rookie. We might kick it more or he might increase to a 90-92% kicker. He might also go down to a 84%ish kicker."
eagles,3dyjmo,BornRreddy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"He could. Remember that Henery was good as a rookie too, though..."
eagles,3dyjmo,Clue_Balls,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:54 2015 UTC,"Vinny Curry is an odd addition to the list to me.  He is a very gifted pass rusher and the Eagles have carved out a great role for him. He produced his pressure and production on his own unlike Barwin who got most of them when a quarterback was sent his way by someone else's pressure.  If the Eagles are able to score more points, which most of us assume we will, then he can have even more pass rush opportunities."
eagles,3dyjmo,TheMeta88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"Even if he is talented, 9 sacks is a lot for a situational pass rusher. We will see though, I think he will eclipse that number."

eagles,3dyjmo,thecaptainofcrunch,3,Mon Jul 20 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's the perfect counterbalance to all the offseason 'so and so looks amazing in OTAs!' hype. Players have one good season and people take it as a given they're going to be a beast from then on out, but there's always a Riley Cooper to some degree, best to temper your expectations some."
eagles,3dyjmo,dssssd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:49 2015 UTC,"Not just Riley Cooper, how about Michael Vick for the Eagles and the countless others in the league."
eagles,3dygax,p341250n,11,Mon Jul 20 15:43:12 2015 UTC,Cheapest option - /r/nflstreams   Cheap option - NFL2Go.com
eagles,3dygax,ScottoGato,3,Mon Jul 20 15:55:46 2015 UTC,for NFL2Go the first game you watch on an account is free. Last season I ended up making a making account almost every week. Free HD football is good.
eagles,3dygax,undeadfred95,6,Mon Jul 20 19:56:33 2015 UTC,im sure they have Buffalo wild wings.  they show all the games if you don't mind the crowd.  could even find a few eagles stragglers there.
eagles,3dygax,phileagles,3,Mon Jul 20 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"This really is the way to go. You can nurse a few beers at a bar each game for the same price as NFL Sunday Ticket from most cable companies.   However, if you get DirecTv, NFL Sunday Ticket is free!"
eagles,3dygax,root88,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"NFL Sunday Ticket is free!   For one year with a 2-year DirecTV contract. DirecTV has tried to F me more times than when I used to have Comcast, and that's saying something."
eagles,3dygax,iama_F_B_I_AGENT,4,Mon Jul 20 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"Columbus resident here, no dedicated Philly bars that I know of. Just about any sports bar is going to have Sunday ticket. Check out Rooster's, don't waste your money at BW3. Just make sure to get there a bit before game time to get a seat and a TV with the Birds on it."
eagles,3dygax,ToastedPanda,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:24 2015 UTC,Roosters is really good. I second this.
eagles,3dygax,derekism,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:36 2015 UTC,"I went to Ohio state. Despite less than 3 hours from 5 different NFL teams (Browns, Bengals, Steelers, Lions, Colts), the Eagles have a decent following, probably the next highest, maybe the Bears. It's a pretty cool melting pot of NFL teams on Sundays."
eagles,3dygax,FL14,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"Yo, use a VPN (I use ZenMate) and get the european GamePass. It's about $200, but it's HD and has every NFL game (not just the Iggles), including playoffs, etc. If you find a cool place in Cbus, let me know!"

eagles,3dytln,Folesteam_ahead,5,Mon Jul 20 17:18:02 2015 UTC,Youll definitely hear some things.  For example when we played carolina last year i was asking fans in beer lines how many years they were gonna trot out that awful duo of jonathon stewart and deangelo williams. Youll hear it when kiko lays shady out.
eagles,3dytln,PeteJones6969,7,Mon Jul 20 17:32:07 2015 UTC,i honestly hope that happens.  still love kiko
eagles,3dytln,PeteJones6969,9,Mon Jul 20 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing physical will happen. You will get heckled though. That's your decision to wear your teams colors in our stadium. Don't want to be heckled? Two options, watch it at home, or don't wear bills apparel."
eagles,3dytln,millenialfalcon,6,Mon Jul 20 17:42:23 2015 UTC,yeah heckling i can handle.  what's it like when you have dallas in town?
eagles,3dytln,SweeterThanYoohoo,9,Mon Jul 20 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"Rough. Dallas fans get it bad. That's how it is, no brotherly love for outlanders"
eagles,3dytln,apollonese,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"The issue I have is that most Dallas fans are locals, and I'm embarrassed for them. Fuck Dallas."
eagles,3dytln,Mmaayyoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"Best peice of advice I can give you is don't react to it. Some people can get really drunk and obnoxious. I went to the season opener last year against the Jags and there was a guy in a Scobee jersey who got heckled for a LOOONG time that game, but he was a really good sport about it and actually they put him on the jumbro screen, sitting there getting yelled at in his Scobee jersey."
eagles,3dytln,kingzer,4,Tue Jul 21 20:36:42 2015 UTC,"if you put a sticker on your jersey that said fuck dallas, you'd be fine. Philli got no beef with Bills."
eagles,3dytln,Mmaayyoo,9,Mon Jul 20 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"haha exactly.  since you guys are the only NFC East team that didn't beat us in the SB, we also have no beef with Philly"
eagles,3dytln,Dragon420Wizard,-11,Mon Jul 20 19:26:55 2015 UTC,are you coming down to kiss eagle's fans asses or do you want to root for the bills
eagles,3dytln,Mattsasse,7,Mon Jul 20 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"See, you'll run into jerkoff's like this guy...probably with some better heckling...but not much more than that."
eagles,3dytln,HipGuide,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:31 2015 UTC,True
eagles,3dytln,Mattsasse,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm excited to see how the Bills do this year. I would love to see Sexy Rexy and the Bills win that division this year. I have no Ill will against the Bills and it has arguably been tougher for you guys in the Super Bowl era than for us. I mean 3 straight SB losses is tough and I think you guys deserved at least one of those for ol' Jim Kelly."
eagles,3dytln,undeadfred95,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:29 2015 UTC,I don't think any AFC team would really bother eagles fans except Pit and maybe NE and even those two wouldn't be too bad.
eagles,3dytln,daaays,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:00 2015 UTC,MAYBE the jets if theyre good
eagles,3dytln,vinnyorcharles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:27 2015 UTC,Until the jets beat us at least once I can't have any animosity towards them.
eagles,3dytln,SweeterThanYoohoo,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:01 2015 UTC,What are your feelings about who 'won' the trade between our two teams?
eagles,3dytln,HipGuide,3,Mon Jul 20 23:03:25 2015 UTC,Really too early to tell. Can Kiko stay healthy and can McCoy still produce... After this year we'll know who got the better deal

eagles,3dytln,Hagadin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"I would say zero issues unless you run into a super drunk asshole, but that kind of guy would probably also fight another Birds fan.  You might hear some chirping about Shady, but I'd be surprised if anyone did more than cheer loudly around you when we score and maybe give you a couple boos if the Bills do well. Overall, we are neutral toward the Bills team."
eagles,3dytln,Hagadin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"At the least someone will say something on the border of rude and funny to you. All fans will bond over hating the rest of the NFC East, I'd even buy you a beer."

eagles,3dvoq7,lookoutbeloww,6,Sun Jul 19 22:47:28 2015 UTC,I'll ask her!
eagles,3dvoq7,vinnyorcharles,2,Mon Jul 20 15:31:43 2015 UTC,OP pls
eagles,3dvoq7,CC2560,26,Mon Jul 20 15:02:10 2015 UTC,Does she do these commercially at all? I'd consider buying something like this. It looks awesome.
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,32,Sun Jul 19 23:04:57 2015 UTC,Said girlfriend here: I'll let you guys know if and when I start selling them :) I'll probably make an etsy page. Thanks for the support!
eagles,3dvoq7,lookoutbeloww,19,Mon Jul 20 02:25:56 2015 UTC,You should maybe post this to /r/nfl. They would probably love it and you might get some requests to make other teams logos. Just don't be making any Dallas string art!
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,31,Mon Jul 20 03:18:25 2015 UTC,I've already had a request for Dallas!! xD my boyfriend and I laughed at the guy.
eagles,3dvoq7,krusty_nipples,5,Mon Jul 20 03:19:53 2015 UTC,You. You're a keeper.
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,3,Mon Jul 20 15:49:45 2015 UTC,Haha thank you.
eagles,3dvoq7,CC2560,3,Mon Jul 20 18:12:59 2015 UTC,Nice username! Look forward to hearing more about these. They are awesome.
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,3,Mon Jul 20 02:30:26 2015 UTC,Thank you so much!
eagles,3dvoq7,pubeINyourSOUP,3,Mon Jul 20 02:34:45 2015 UTC,Let me know if you make one. I'll be your first buyer!
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,2,Mon Jul 20 03:38:17 2015 UTC,Thank you for the support! Everyone here asking about buying them will be the first to know if/when I start selling them with a PM! :)
eagles,3dvoq7,all_purple_errthang,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:44 2015 UTC,"Send me one of those PMs too, please!"
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,3,Mon Jul 20 13:47:15 2015 UTC,Will definitely do!
eagles,3dvoq7,grizz281,3,Mon Jul 20 13:52:44 2015 UTC,Interested!
eagles,3dvoq7,dwaters11,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:45 2015 UTC,"She's considering it.  Someone offered her $40 for this one, but she's not sure.  She has no idea what a majority of people would be willing to pay for something like this."
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,4,Sun Jul 19 23:19:55 2015 UTC,"would she sell it with or without the frame? with the frame, i'd definitely pay more than $40. depends on shipping though."
eagles,3dvoq7,dwaters11,2,Mon Jul 20 01:19:25 2015 UTC,The girlfriend here. It would probably be sold with the frame if I start selling them
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"cool, let us know. depending on what it costs you to make (time + materials) i'm thinking around $60 without shipping but not dead set at that."
eagles,3dvoq7,dwaters11,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:19 2015 UTC,I'll definitely let you guys know. I'm thinking $50ish for each. I'll start looking into frames and creating an etsy page.
eagles,3dvoq7,PlayerPiano1,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:37 2015 UTC,sounds good!
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:42 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I'd pay 50 in a heartbeat for one of these."
eagles,3dvoq7,princessprity,2,Mon Jul 20 04:02:28 2015 UTC,Thank you :) I'm really considering starting this as a hobby to make a little extra money on the side and you guys have been so encouraging.
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,2,Mon Jul 20 04:07:35 2015 UTC,How long did it take you to make it?
eagles,3dvoq7,double0nothing,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly I worked on it for an hour or two here and there so it was done in 2 weeks. If I sat down and focused on it, the string part could take a whole day while the nails are so frustrating that it'd take about 3 or 4 days.  I used about 3 packs of nails."
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,10,Mon Jul 20 04:05:13 2015 UTC,"That seems pretty labor intensive. Don't undersell yourself, because your product looks high quality and worth about $100-150"
eagles,3dvoq7,princessprity,2,Mon Jul 20 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure about prices and I'm a broke college student so I understand people wanting to decorate without paying a bunch. Maybe as I get more requests/orders I'll up the price. The only major part is the framing. Other than that it's just nails and string so I definitely don't wanna rack the price up too high, ya know? I still want people interested and not deterred when they see a big price tag."
eagles,3dvoq7,krusty_nipples,5,Mon Jul 20 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"Still, 50 bucks is really small for what sounds like 15+ hours of work...  Honestly, I think you'd still get takers for for 2-3 times as much."
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,3,Mon Jul 20 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"This right here. It's business, you can always lower your price but its hard to raise it...you want to sink 15+ hours of your time into just building it, then on top of that have to actively spend time and energy selling it for only $50? Strictly from an hourly income perspective working at Taco Hell is the better deal. You could definitely sell these for retail $200 (but sell me one for $50 pls)"
eagles,3dvoq7,princessprity,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"It'll all depend on the framing I can find/make. I don't mind making them cheap if it's just my time because I know people will really enjoy them and decorate their ""man caves"" or whatever. Haha. I'll definitely be looking for some type of profit but nothing huge."
eagles,3dvoq7,joeykittens,4,Mon Jul 20 04:40:10 2015 UTC,"If it takes that long you should charge way more than 50 bucks. Don't waste your time, this isn't minimum wage bs."
eagles,3dvoq7,CrapFrancis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:58 2015 UTC,$40-$60 seems like legit price
eagles,3dvoq7,guy_via,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:48 2015 UTC,50ish seems right to me. I'd probably buy one at that price.
eagles,3dvoq7,nosgnerd,3,Sun Jul 19 23:20:44 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size and how well the fit and finish off it is, or could be way more than that."
eagles,3dvoq7,andorrak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"That's dope! What did she use, pins and colored string? Where'd she get that idea, Pinterest?! I'd make that!"
eagles,3dvoq7,SweeterThanYoohoo,2,Sun Jul 19 23:31:45 2015 UTC,Would buy for 50$ PM me or make a post if Your girlfriend is selling.
eagles,3dvoq7,scipio314,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:12 2015 UTC,She saw a picture of some string art online and figured she could make the eagles logo.  She used nails and colored string.
eagles,3dvoq7,ConcedeDota,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:40 2015 UTC,I'd pay....25 bucks sound fair?  edit: holy crap I scrolled down and it worth WAY more then 25. 75 is more appropriate with the dope framing.
eagles,3dvoq7,PeteJones6969,5,Sun Jul 19 23:18:20 2015 UTC,dude. thats awesome. you found a keeper

eagles,3dvoq7,SweeterThanYoohoo,4,Mon Jul 20 02:37:56 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the support! I'm the girlfriend. Haha. If/when I start selling them I'll definitely let you guys know. I'll be looking into frames and creating an etsy page. Prices will depend on the frame used but it would be around $50ish. :)
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,3,Mon Jul 20 02:56:31 2015 UTC,Ditto
eagles,3dvoq7,SweeterThanYoohoo,2,Mon Jul 20 10:26:04 2015 UTC,"I made another post but unsure if you'll see it.  Is your gf interested monetizing this? Depending on how much the framing cost, I'd be willing to pay pretty good money for something that looks so cool  btw she must be cool AF"
eagles,3dvoq7,JebusOfEagles,2,Sun Jul 19 23:20:33 2015 UTC,She's definitely interested.  She's just not sure how much most people would be willing to pay for it.
eagles,3dvoq7,DeadPrez1,4,Sun Jul 19 23:34:09 2015 UTC,How much would it cost? I dig unique eagles shit.
eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,3,Sun Jul 19 23:50:24 2015 UTC,The price would probably depend on the type of frame used for each one if I do start selling them. Around $50ish is what I'm looking at so far thanks to the comments here. I just wasn't sure if people would be willing to pay a high enough price so these were worth making because it takes a while. Especially all the nails. I'll be looking into frames and creating an etsy page when I figure it out :) thanks for the support
eagles,3dvoq7,bogey2230,2,Mon Jul 20 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"No doubt, the example given looks great, and I know how expensive framing can be. I'll be a customer the moment I have some disposable income!   Post an update here or something, once you've got it all figured out"

eagles,3dvoq7,Eaglesstringart,3,Mon Jul 20 00:31:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's fucking awesome. I want to buy one. How much? :)"
eagles,3dvoq7,hectarpit,3,Mon Jul 20 06:14:52 2015 UTC,I'll let you guys know if/when I start selling them! The price will depend on the framing used :) refer to some of my comments above for a little bit more details.

Guys like Fletcher Cox, Vinny Curry, Bennie Logan and Mychal Kendricks all elevated their game to a new level in their second year in Bill Davis's scheme. Coupled with the additions of Barwin and Alonso among others, this unit has the chance to be one of the absolute best in the league this year, and Davis doesn't get nearly enough credit for this."

eagles,3dy6l7,Ertz_Donut,12,Mon Jul 20 14:29:50 2015 UTC,"Foles was the starter. Foles was traded for Bradford. Bradford should be good enough to start as evidenced by the decision to go get him and use last year's starter as bait.  IF something happens where Sanchez needs to play, I am very comfortable with him. I maintain he is the best backup in the league. Another year under Kelly can only help him grow from last season. I'm of the mindset that the collapse was more on secondary personnel and defensive coaching above all else, while acknowledging that a couple poor decisions from Sanchez didn't help the cause."
eagles,3dy6l7,CravingToast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think it's the end of the world if Bradford doesn't pan out. If Foles was still here, there is no doubt in my mind that I'd rather have Sanchez start."
eagles,3dy6l7,pitcher_10,5,Mon Jul 20 16:53:49 2015 UTC,I'd rather Foles over Sanchez but I'm comfortable with tenders being the #2 guy.
eagles,3dy6l7,CravingToast,4,Mon Jul 20 18:45:18 2015 UTC,Yeah Foles even with his int issues on the back foot was better last year lol.. Sanchez had a top 3 offensive line one of the best run games in the NFL and Cooper and Matthews improved massivly as the season went on
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,5,Mon Jul 20 20:59:27 2015 UTC,"If Sanchez starts, nobody is trading for Bradford. He's gonna be a free agent after this year, a team could just wait to get him then.  That aside, I don't think this team would accomplish much if Sanchez was the starter. He's still turnover prone and really outside of a game or two he looked just okay last year or bad.   With Bradford he's simply more physically talented. There's a higher ceiling for him and that potential is something to get excited about."
eagles,3dy6l7,2fly5,4,Mon Jul 20 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"I like Sanchez, but his games against GB, Seattle, and Dallas were not good."

eagles,3dy6l7,2fly5,0,Mon Jul 20 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"His game against GB was in Lambeau.  The Packers won every game at home.  Lets not forget that one...  The Seattle game?  You expect a quarterback to play well against the LoB when there's absolutely no run game?  We had 57 rushing yards in that game, 7 of which were actually from Sanchez.  The Cowboys game in Philly was really the only game where I put the blame on Sanchez."
eagles,3dy6l7,pumadude321,4,Mon Jul 20 16:29:56 2015 UTC,Oh quit making excuses they stacked up to stop McCoy and Sanchez had 60 yards outside of one broken coverage on Ertz where he picked up 35.   They knew he couldn't throw deep for shit and just sat on the routes while covering the run and there was nothing we could do.
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"They stacked up to stop the run?  Their linebackers pressed because their secondary is WAY better than our receiving corps.    Lets break down his interception, though.  To start things off, the pass was to our favorite receiver, Riley Cooper.  As you can see here, he wasn't even looking for the ball.  He finally turned his head 30 yards down the field, which equates to about 5 seconds off the game clock where he wasn't looking.  In a fast paced offense, there is no reason you don't look back for the ball within 5 seconds of the play starting.  There is no way in hell they play that was called demanded 4 seconds for Sanchez in the pocket.  That was a major fuckup by Cooper, not Sanchez, who was on the run out of the collapsing pocket, clearly expecting Cooper to be doing his job.  By the way, you told me to stop making excuses for Sanchez, and then you made an excuse for McCoy.  Is this formation the Seahawks stacking up against the run?  A basic 4-3 formation?  McCoy had 17 runs, averaging 2.9 yards each, with a long of 10 yards.  That's fucking pathetic.  Edit: Forgot to mention McCoy didn't gain anything on the play against the basic 4-3, and he ended up fumbling on that play.  If you're gonna tell me I'm wrong, prove it.  I hate seeing people on this site just call people out for things and not back anything they say up.  Go rewatch the damn game."
eagles,3dy6l7,pumadude321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to say with that cooper play lol, look at the still you had. Even if cooper is expecting this horrible underthrow and turns around there are 2 players right there. Even if copper makes that catch you look at Sanchez and go wtf did you just throw that there for, are we really going to pretend that Sanchez threw a good pass when the defender is camped out where it is supposed to go before the ball hardly even starts it's decent?  You can't just have it any way you want lmao, you act like he was playing great ball and comapre him to the top QBs in the league statistically then just brush off his losses because ""how can we possibly expect sanchez to beat seattle"". He is either a QB capable of carrying a team or he isn't, it can't be ""he was one of the best QB around last year look at stat x y and z"" and then ""well what do you expect it's the seahawks"".  On a final side note  that is nickel defense not even 4-3, and we are in 11 personel if you thinkk 7 in the box vs 3 wide and a TE off the LOS with 2 CBs playing that tight doesn't scream pass on me what on earth does?"
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"look at the still you had   Cooper's head wasn't turned around.  That was my whole point.  His head wasn't turned around yet, when it should have been.   are we really going to pretend that Sanchez threw a good pass when the defender is camped out where it is supposed to go before the ball hardly even starts it's decent?   The defender came off of the outside coverage.  Tharold Simon came off of the coverage against Matthews when that ball was thrown because his head was looking when Sanchez ran out of the collapsed pocket.  Was it a bad throw?  Yeah.  It wasn't an uncatchable ball, though.  All it required was Cooper paying attention.   He is either a QB capable of carrying a team or he isn't, it can't be ""he was one of the best QB around last year look at stat x y and z"" and then ""well what do you expect it's the seahawks"".   Seahawks beat the Packers twice.  Is Rodgers not capable of carrying the Packers?  They beat the Giants, too.  Is Eli Manning not capable of carrying a team?  That point is bullshit.   On a final side note that is nickel defense not even 4-3   A nickel defense is 5 DBs.  The formations that come with a nickel defense are either a 4-2-5 or a 3-3-5.  Just because there is a nickel back playing does not mean they are lined up in a nickel formation.  Their formation, with Tharold Simon on one side, Sherman on the other, Maxwell in the slot, and Thomas playing up top is a formation with 4 DBs.  It's a 4-3 formation, with a cornerback covering the slot.   and we are in 11 personnel if you think 7 in the box vs 3 wide and a TE off the LOS with 2 CBs playing that tight doesn't scream pass on me what on earth does?   Look at the matchups, though.  Sherman is covering Maclin on the outside.  Sherman wins that matchup 99 times out of 100.  On the other side, Riley Cooper is being covered by Tharold Simon.  It's a battle between inconsistent and inexperience.  In the slot you have Maxwell covering Matthews.  Just in case either Maxwell or Simon get beat, Thomas covers them.  Our receivers would not be able to win those matchups, with the exception maybe a corner route from Matthews if Maclin could get Sherman far enough down field to create the gap."
eagles,3dy6l7,pumadude321,2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he was the sole reason for those losses. I pointed out those games because they were against the top playoff seeds in the NFC. Sure, the Packers are untouchable at home, and Seattle's D is ridiculous, and I think pointing out that he was unable to overcome those obstacles is valid criticism."

eagles,3dy6l7,pumadude321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:36 2015 UTC,Does his playoff tenure with the Jets make you anymore confident in his abilities as a leader/QB?
eagles,3dy6l7,2fly5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"Not really. The defense and run game were really the strength of those Jets teams, though he did have some strong performances. I just think his problem with turnovers is too big of a deterrent for him to lead this team on a deep playoff run. His postseason experience is definitely valuable in the locker room though."

eagles,3dy6l7,pumadude321,3,Mon Jul 20 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"It's one of the things that a lot of sports ""journalists"" pushing the Mariota trade rumors were just completely missing. It was, from the beginning, Chip saying he'd stand by Bradford and yet people are saying he tried everything he could to dump him and it's kind of silly how little some people can accept the moves Chip makes.   But I'm still waiting for the other shoe, just in case."
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,10,Mon Jul 20 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"I really like Sanchez.  Last year in 9 games, he threw for 2,418 yards on a 64.1% completion percentage.  To put that into perspective, if he started all year at that pace, he would have had 4,300 passing yards.  That would have put him between Rivers and Rodgers for yardage.  His 64.1% completion percentage?  That's tied with Brady.  What he needs to improve on is his field vision.  Looking at his past stats, though, he already has a lot, showing he's willing to put in the work.  With the Jets, he had 68 TDs and 69 INTs.  He came off a season where he had 13 TDs and 18 INTs.  This year he had 14 TDs and 11 INTs off the bench.  He can improve a lot, but I really like him.  He went 5-4 with our squad last year, losing to the Seahawks, Packers in Lambeau and going 2-2 against our division.  I think it's truly a shame people bag on him."
eagles,3dy6l7,PeteJones6969,5,Mon Jul 20 14:57:27 2015 UTC,"Love the argument, thank you for providing stats to make it better!"
eagles,3dy6l7,hellmelee,10,Mon Jul 20 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"You could not have gone out of your way to spin it in a more positive light.   He also would have had 25 turnovers which is about tied with Jay Cutler for worst in the league.   He didn't ""lose because it was seattle"" he didn't even get 100 yards and IIRC a huge section of his 90 something yards were on one broken coverage on Ertz.   Yes Washington was far from his fault but come on now he threw a crippling interception at the end of the game.  I don't get where you are going with this, he was great for a backup and may be the best backup in the league. But there is literally no way this team makes a playoff run with Sanchez at the helm, we will be ok and probably a 500+ level team with him at the helm but Bradford being healthy is extremely key to our season."
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,4,Mon Jul 20 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"Entirely this. I love having Sanchez as our backup, but if its his show I just don't see him chucking us to the bowl."
eagles,3dy6l7,delbv9,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'm really not worried about Sanchez starting if he has to.. the guy played alright last year and it was his first in a new, ""revolutionary"" system. I think between finally being healthy and having that extra year under his belt, he could be drastically improved on last year. He had some good and bad moments last season, but the guy has played in some big games in the past.   That being said.. I will be supremely disappointed if Bradford doesn't start. Not a knock on Sanchez, but more because we'd just shipped off Foles and a 2nd round pick for a $13M backup."
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,3,Mon Jul 20 16:20:29 2015 UTC,Come on man Sanchez is only starting if Bradford gets hurt or is just flat out awful coming back.
eagles,3dy6l7,ODBrunizz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is our running game. Last year, our running game was really struggling therefore we were force to throw the ball.          Sanchez is not good when you put too much pressure on him with no help. But if he's comfortable and there's some help from running game and our defense, I'm sure he can carry this team to the 9-10 wins season.    But I'm really curious with Bradford. With his arm strength, his athleticism and Kelly's system his ceiling is so high. So I'm really expecting from great things from him."
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,3,Mon Jul 20 16:24:44 2015 UTC,We had the second most effective running game almost tied with Dallas during the time Sanchez was QB as McCoy had broken out of his slump and we got the rest of the OL back.
eagles,3dy6l7,Mediumrare91,2,Mon Jul 20 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"we get a 3rd rd pick from STL if he doesn't play a snap   I read somewhere that there is a caveat that he can't be traded for this 3rd rounder to take effect.  It was during the ""you know who"" fest and that we actually wouldn't get that third pick."
eagles,3dy6l7,kevbot1111,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:52 2015 UTC,Shows you how the media only reports what they want to report. Felt like I looked everywhere and couldn't find this piece of information
eagles,3dy6l7,PhillyEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"That was pretty widely reported after the Bradford trade, the full details of the trade weren't official for a bit. Can't really bitch about the media not freaking out about the conditionals of a 3rd/4th round pick 2 weeks after a trade"

eagles,3dy6l7,ThisHatRightHere,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"These are great arguments guys! Honestly I don't think it matters either way, I believe we go as far as the defense takes us (mainly whoever is playing that right safety spot)"
eagles,3dy6l7,adv0589,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"The real problem I have with Sanchez, is if things start out good for Sanchez he does great. The minute things start getting shakey, dude starts making mistakes. He needs to be more confident, which I'm sure has to do with his time with the jets, before I'm convinced he can be a starter"
eagles,3dy6l7,Lunchtime85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:41 2015 UTC,I'm calling my own recollection of events into question with all these people implying that Sanchez is a viable first string QB. Watching him last season it seemed like the deep ball was a complete non threat because he couldn't get it down the field. Am I misremembering?

eagles,3dyuya,ScottoGato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"I think the WRs will all contribute and do very well, but they'll all vulture points from each other.  The QB (Bradford or Sanchez) will be the best bet to get the points from them.  Maclin did awesome last year, but I don't expect any of the WRs this year to get those targets.  It'll just be spread out."
eagles,3dyuya,dillpiccolol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"Ya, that's a big problem with the Eagles offense, they do really spread it around and with no clear WR1 and even the RB group looks murky.  (Sproles / Polk stole a ton of points from McCoy last year)  Thankfully I'm not doing FF this year, but I think besides being fun to root for, their production will be low.  Bradford is a high upside late pick in my opinion, but there are plenty of better options around the league."
eagles,3dyuya,Ertz_Donut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"I'm for sure picking up whoever is starting Qb (and probably Sanchez if that happens to be Bradford), ertz, d/st, and parkey. MAYBE murray if available after round 2."
eagles,3dyuya,DontTrolllOnMe,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"Demarco Murray is going to be terrible, this year will be about the passing."
eagles,3dyuya,CravingToast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:57 2015 UTC,I don't know if terrible is the right word but his carries will decrease so there won't be as many chances for him to put up ridiculous totals again. The counterpoint is fresher legs may produce bigger results so he could still be a good start in a multiple rb league. Won't really know until we see how the carries will be distributed with this new backfield.
