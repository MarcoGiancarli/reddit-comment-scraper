blues,3e1g5h,justmahbutts2,45,Tue Jul 21 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"He is not one of the best guitarists of all-time, but he was certainly above average.  His reputation and influence really had to do with other things besides his guitar playing.  Remember, he was essentially a failure as a musician in his lifetime (like most Delta blues men) and was basically forgotten until the blues revival of the 1960s.  What makes his playing difficult to emulate for modern players I think are two things: 1.) the piano-derived style of independent rhythm / melody + grace notes with the thumb and fingers.  RJ was an innovator of this style, where he essentially copied the two-part piano style of Leroy Carr and others and transplanted it to guitar.  2.) the shear variety of styles that RJ could play well is difficult to equal: slide and fingerpicking and rhythmic strumming, 7 different open tunings (one completely new), weird capo positions, and only ONE guitar solo.  It's a wide range of stuff captured in just 29 known songs recorded (and a bunch are essentially the same).  Scrapper Blackwell, Lonnie Johnson, and Skip James were all better guitar players, and more innovative, but perhaps more one-dimensional than RJ.  But RJ was a far better player than Charley Patton or Son House though.  What made RJ a great musician was ""the whole package"": the singing voice, the arranging, the variety of ""influences"" (i.e. others he stole from), the timely recording gigs, and the better-than-average guitar playing.  Combine that with the crossroads+devil legend and the tragic death in his prime (rather than slowly fading into obscurity like his contemporaries) and you've got a musical legend."
blues,3e1g5h,conchoso,5,Tue Jul 21 08:51:41 2015 UTC,This is surely the best and most accurate answer.
blues,3e1g5h,Wirenutt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:09:49 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree. I wholeheartedly believe that he is one of the greatest, and largely for the reasons that you say he isn't, but everyone's criteria for ""best"" differs. He's definitely not clean and technical in the way that Skip James is (just clean and emotive playing, lots of open tunings and relatively fast fingerpicking for the genre), but his music was incredibly complex for the time and there's a lot of nuance to it.   I think it's easy to listen to Robert Johnson and not be blown away because he had way more restraint than pretty much anyone else who was as good as him. He was writing incredible guitar parts in many different styles that were leagues ahead of most of his musical contemporaries, but it's almost like he was consciously trying to downplay his ability.   Going back to Skip James, something like Johnson's Stop Breaking Down Blues doesn't sound like it would be any more difficult to master than Jesus Is A Mighty Good Leader or Hard Time Killing Floor Blues or Cypress Grove Blues, but when you sit down with it, there's so much more going on with the Robert Johnson stuff. Most all of his songs had the simultaneous rhythm and lead parts you mentioned, but neither was half-assed like you would see from most players who try to replicate the piano style of playing on a guitar.  I definitely value composition and innovation over showmanship when thinking of the all-time greats, so I think that the complexity in the context of the time he was making music is enough to put him near the top of any list. I would much rather listen to Skip James or Lonnie Johnson, but I would never try to claim that they were anywhere near RJ's level.   I do agree 100% that, not to detract from his merits I've mentioned, he gets slightly too much credit due to the mystique that surrounds him as a person (crossroads, premature death). People--especially journalists, who write pop/folk music history, for better or worse--love to overrate musicians who have an interesting story or a tragic early ending to a great career. I personally think that the crossroads story is fun but ridiculous, and the fact that he died is irrelevant because he put more to tape than most pre-WWII blues artists."
blues,3e1g5h,carrothouse,8,Wed Jul 22 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting thing, I would personally suggest there's something in small nuances, as well as his voice. In his time, he was known as a travelling musician and did alright, but his records never sold well in his time. Terraplane Blues was a minor regional hit, selling roughly 3600 copies, but even at this time, popular records were selling much more. The remainder of his records sold in the hundreds (~300-700) Consistent bestsellers were selling tens of thousands of records (such as Charlie Patton, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Memphis Minnie), mega hits were selling hundreds of thousands (Bessie Smith, Blind Boy Fuller, Buddy Moss) and super amazing mega hits were selling in the millions (Leroy Carr, Blind Lemon Jefferson, even a couple of Blind Willie Johnson's Gospel records which supposedly outsold Bessie Smith!).   As for his reputation as a performer, Patton was better known by far, however died in 1934. Son House and the House/Willie Brown duo were very well known across the whole region, despite their records never selling all that well. In fact, Wille Brown's records sold so poorly that three copies are known to exist of one of his records, and none of his two others. What happened with Robert Johnson was that at his home, he had been known for years to be making 'noise' with music, often scolded by House (who as I said was a much better known performer, I could write you an essay twice as long as this with proof of that despite very poor record sales), then returned a more proficient player than house and Brown. Johnson was known to have a versatile repertoire outside the studio and the only one of his compositions he was known to play outside the studio was Terraplane Blues when it was popular. So he wasn't exceptionally well known or commercially successful, aside from when performing Son House/Charlie Patton songs or songs in their style like Preaching Blues or Walking Blues, he had a very quiet voice making it difficult for him to be well heard in unamplified settings such as most juke joints.  For example, if one (at a time years ago when there would be more than a few scattered centenarians) had canvassed the older African American musical community about Robert Johnson, aside from his hometown and areas he spent time with family, few would be able to mention knowing of him. Now, if one had done the same with Son House, Tommy Johnson, Son Sims (again, never popular on his own, virtually unheard of as a matter of fact) or Charlie Patton, an answer would have been near guaranteed (assuming they knew the music scene).  Now what did happen is that Johnson captivated a very important and powerful man by the name of John Hammond. John Hammond was high up in Columbia for a long time, high up enough to take risks like releasing Bessie Smith to the mainstream instead of 'Race Records' market of the time. Hammond was absolutely captivated by Johnson, and when he never made it to seeing him in person, his captivation arguably became a borderline obsession. He searched for traces of Johnson where he could, and made the best effort at a comprehensive release of his records. This is why Johnson was thrust into the eye of musicians. A well marketed and packaged release of his recordings. I sound negative about Hammond, I assure you, I am not, I have the utmost respect for the man, he gave music many wonderful things and I can't profess to be any less obsessed than him.   Don't get me wrong about Johnson, he was a spectacular player, but was he the best? I don't think so, I mean, with work, his songs are coverable. His voice lent a lot to them however, and I think that combination is unique. Rory Block and Eric Clapton can physically play Johnson's songs the same as he did, but are they the same as Robert Johnson? No, because there's still something different. I guess that's the element you're looking for, definitely look into it, every recordings have been dissected and essays written about him and his music, it's just a matter of finding them. Best of luck!"
blues,3e1g5h,StoogeKebab,7,Tue Jul 21 09:50:33 2015 UTC,"I've got a website dedicated to learning finger picked acoustic guitar (shameless plug: http://www.52weeksofblues.com/). I do a song a week and the vast majority are pre-Second World War, so while not an expert I know a bit about the topic.  There's a lot of reasons why Johnson is seriously at the top of blues guitar. He's just the complete package. He was very, very good at everything you need to be good at. Here's a few points:  The first is the diversity of blues he played. He was equally adept with or without a slide, the 29 songs he recorded are in 4 different tunings and even more keys. A lot of guys from back then were masters of one tuning (Skip James' best work uses a D minor tuning) or one key (Tommy Johnson in G); but Johnson was equally as good over all of them. And not just good - he was a master slide player; he was a master finger picker. He knew what he was doing in any tuning or any key.  The next thing - as this is by a long, long way the biggest thing - is just how freaking clean he was. He recorded 42 versions of the 29 songs live, one or two takes, and there is barely a badly fingered note in there; there's virtually no scrapped string sounds which is a miracle for slide playing. His technique was the best - he hit the note he wanted to at the tempo and strength he needed and he did it every single time. Oh all the guys I've studied there are very, very few who don't have small mistakes in their playing. Blind Blake and Gary Davis are up there, but Johnson's technique is the most mistake free and clean technique of the early guys. He could just do the technical playing stuff better than anyone who came before him.  Because of this, he could get great separation between the sounds made with his thumb and his fingers of his right hand. I think he used a thumb pick and 3 non-picked fingers to play, where as most other guys used picks on the thumb and on the one or maybe two fingers they used to get their sound. This separation is what you want when playing finger style - the melodies sound like a second guitar. There's a few guys who can do this, Mississippi John Hurt for example, but Johnson is next to him in the very best category.  He played Delta blues which (in comparison the other most well documented style from the 20s and 30s - Piedmont) uses simple single string bass lines and more expressive riffs.  Piedmont have the melody/rhythm idea but they are more combined into one instrument; with Delta you treat them as two different things. So he'd set up the rhythm using the thumb, and the fingers would do melodies or chords to fill out the high register.  But Johnson was ridiculously subtle with the higher notes. Along with the great technique, he also was blessed with touch. He'd play notes that augmented the rhythm, as opposed to standing out on top of it which is by far the most common melody/rhythm combination in music. The subtly of being able to do this at will is ridiculously difficult - you have to have mastery of everything you are doing. Clapton is an undisputed guitar master, known for a less is more approach, and even he can't quite get the subtle touch that Johnson got in every single recording.   Delta blues before Johnson was generally rough and rugged, raw, emotional, controversial, sexual and primitive sounding. Johnson made it fluid. He played it with grace.  Listen to Sweet Home Chicago. In the verse, behind the singing, his thumb is hitting two strings doing the rhythm while at the 'four - and' beat his fingers will hit just two or three notes going into the next bar. It's so subtle it sounds like a harmonic chime. The bass is always louder, which is unlike a lot of the other guys where the melody or lead lines is intentionally played to be louder than the bass - it's a lot more a 'look at me' style of playing. Johnson approached it from the opposite direction. He was understated with his melody lines and chords - he had that touch where he would hit the right note at the right tempo at exactly the right volume. Graceful.  Finally, and I could literally talk about this for a week, his note choice was  very, very lyrical and somewhat unusual for his influences. The most obvious example of this is the use of the diminished I chord in a few songs, Kind Hearterd Woman Blues for example. In the first four bars he plays an A7 chord, then drops the whole shape down a fret to make it an Adim7. He does this while his thumb is thumping away on the muted A sting.  Blues plays around with the ambiguity created with interplay between major and minor. So this A7 to A dim takes that concept to the extreme. The A7 has inherent ambiguity because it has the flat 7 - one of the so called 'blue notes' - with a major 3rd and the fifth. Then when he drops it he's playing the flat 5th and flat 3rd - the other two blue notes - and the major 6th. The flat third makes the chord a minor, but the maj 6th reinforces it as a major. The flat 5th is just weird. As a result he gets this non major non minor weirdness that then resolves back to the A7, which has major/minor ambiguity anyway.   So TL/DR: diverse styles, technique, touch, grace, note choice. Everything you need to do it well, he had in spades."

blues,3e1g5h,newaccount,3,Tue Jul 21 13:47:49 2015 UTC,"Scrapper is a bit different to mos other guys. He was from a big city - Indianapolis - and not the farming communities of the other early guys. He played mainly with Leroy Carr on piano, so didn't have to worry about playing rhythm as much as concentrating on the melody.  His first single was a massive seller (How Long Blues released under Carr's name); he got the equivalent of $50K and monthly royalty checks. He and Carr were stars for the next 7 years and released hit after hit until Carr died from alcohol abuse in 1935. Scapper recorded a remembrance tune then quit the business until the 60s.  His style was playing guitar leads over the piano, and he is the biggest influence over electric guitar despite predating it by a good 20 years. All the Chicago blues guitarists came from Scrapper - rhythm section including the piano, lead guitar over the top. He and Carr played a more sophisticated, jazz influence, urban blues. In the day it was all the bawdy, hokum style, sexual innuendo songs like Bo Carter that were the popular blues that you'd hear at country dances. Scrapper and Carr made the blues cool for inner city kids, they were really game changers.  He recorded some solo stuff early - he wrote Kokomo Blues which was 'borrowed' by Johnson for Sweet Home Chicago (the verse is Mmmm, baby don’t you want to go (repeated); Pack up your little suitcase, Papa’s going to Kokomo) and recorded some more in the 60's.   I've done one of his songs ""Goin' Where the Monon Crosses the Yellow Dog"" and it's got the hardest 2 bars of finger picked blues I've ever seen in the solo. Its a real Delta country song, really slow and dirty, and he as a 60 year old killed it.  Blind Blake's right hand is the absolute best. Piedmont blues is essentially playing the piano on the guitar, and Blake is head and shoulders above anyone. No one comes close. The timing and syncopation he gets with his thumb is just insane. Almost too hard to be believable. Robert Johnson was a master of the thumb, Blind Blake was a god.   Blind Willie McTell is a guy I listen to a lot, Mississippi John Hurt's style is the one I most want to emulate because it's so lyrical, but it's pure Piedmont so it's very complex - thumb alternates strings on every beat, quick chord changes with one or two short melody lines in each bar.  There's a later guy called Taj Mahal who plays both acoustic and electric (his version of Statesboro Blues and Leaving Trunk redefined the blues sound in the 60's - the opening harmonic of Leaving Trunk is the best opening to any song I've ever heard, just balls to the wall rocking), but it was his acoustic stuff that made me stop wanting to be Hendrix.  But I'm really attracted to guys who didn't get recorded much - Ishmon Bracey, Kid Bailey, Guitar Gabriel, Rabbit Brown, Geeshie Wiley - all these mysteries of the blues that have left these incredible sounds behind. I do a bio on each artist (started at about 200 words, now its averaging around 1500) on each artist and I think I love the stories behind who these guys were more than I like the music."
blues,3e1g5h,conchoso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"The other guy who was great with the thumb rhythm/finger melody separation, who I haven't seen mentioned here yet, is William Brown, who apparently isn't the same ""Willie Brown"" of Son House fame.  William had a chapter in Lomax's The Land Where Blues Began.  He's only got 3 or 4 recordings but they are pretty awesome.  I've been waiting for him to make an appearance on your page, but I couldn't wait so I had to go and work out Mississippi Blues and Ragged and Dirty.  One of those should be on your list!"

That was a while ago, so maybe I've improved enough to have another look!  But if you've worked out the tabs, post them to /r/bluesguitarist - they'll be quite a few people interested in them.

I probably drove my family nuts with how much I practiced that one song trying to get it right.  Of course when I got that one I had to take the next step and try Ragged and Dirty.  It was tough to find any reasonably correct tab for that one, try this one:  http://www.guitaretab.com/w/willie-brown/178836.html  (capo 7, doesn't say that).  The links to the two YouTube videos were actually more helpful than that tab.  It was interesting to find out it's actually a Sleepy John Estes tune, but originally done with an ensemble.  Yes, I've heard the (only?) two Kid Bailey songs Mississippi Bottom Blues and Rowdy Blues and he's pretty awesome.  Are you sure that's two guitars?  Sounds like just one to me.  Of course I've never seen a tab so you should totally do one of his."

The only problem with the song is when the voice drops out you just strum through the verse again. No solo - no nothing. Maybe try a little somethin something. Break it down. Hum. anything. Because when you know exactly what's coming it get a little dull. Listen to some solo John Lee Hooker. He was always breaking line and serving it up with english so you could not guess which way the ball was going to bounce. But all in all - that was some real nice singing.

He is a quick and easy intro point into the early blues. He is the subject of the legend where a blues artist goes to the crossroads to make a deal with the devil and becomes the best guitarist ever. He died at the age of 27, likely poisoned by a jealous bar owner. The rock music of the 1960s owes much to this man - The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and many more reference him or cover his work. Charlie Patton - Father of the Delta blues. He inspired and influenced many of the famous blues artists of the 1930a and 1940s including Robert Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Son House, Willie Brown, Bukka White, Tommy Johnson, and more. The comic artist Robert Crumb wrote and illustrated an amazing story about the life of Charlie Patton. Leadbelly - Texas bluesman who spent half his life in prison and on chain gangs. While there, he learned a huge amount of songs from all over the south. He is hailed as the master of the 12-string guitar. Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, and The White Stripes cover his songs. Curt Cobain and Mark Lanegan formed a Leadbelly cover band before they formed Nirvana and Screaming Trees respectively. Blind Willie Johnson - Blinded at 9 years old when his step mother threw lye in his face, he became a preacher and blues singer. The pain of his life is palpable in his heart wrenching songs. His quintessential and haunting track ""Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground"" was put on the Voyager spacecraft's gold record which now is in interstellar space. Blind Gary Johnson - Really, you can't go wrong with any blind preacher blues singers. Skip James - Not blind, but was also a preacher. Blind Lemon Jefferson - Not a preacher, but was almost completely blind. Bukka White - Steel Guitar master. Had popularity in the 1930s, but disappeared after a short time. He reappeared in the 1960's blues revival movement when an ardent fan wrote a letter addressed to general delivery in a town where they guessed Bukka White possibly lived - the guess was based on the lyrics of Bukka's songs. Bukka had been working as a city bus driver for 30 years and was excited that people still cared about his music. He retuned and had moderate success until his death in 1977. He was also B.B. King's 2nd cousin. He was covered by Bob Dylan and had one of his trademark lines referenced in a Led Zeppelin song.   Please see the Spotify playlist I made for tracks by the above artists and many many more. I hope this helps you on your journey through the early blues."

The list is as follows: Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup, Barbecue Bob, Bessie Smith, Big Bill Bronzy, Big Joe Williams, Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie McTell, Blind Willie Johnson, Brownie McGhee, Buddy Moss, Bukka White, Bumble Bee Slim (Also went by Amos Easton), Casey Bill Weldon, Charlie Patton, David 'Honeyboy' Edwards, Doctor Isiah Ross, Frank Stokes, Freddie Spruell, Gus Cannon, Henry Townsend, Henry Spaulding, Ida Cox, Ishman Bracey, Champion Jack Dupree, Jelly Roll Morton (for his Library of Congress sessions providing very interesting background information on the blues and spectacular unexpurgated versions of 'Pallet on The Floor' and the 'Dirty Dozens'), Jimmie Rodgers (more country but meh, some great covers), Josh White, Kansas Joe McCoy, Lead Belly, Leroy Carr, Lonnie Johnson, Ma Rainey, Mamie Smith, Memphis Minnie, The Mississippi Sheiks, Mississippi John Hurt, Papa Charlie Jackson, Peetie Wheatstraw, Pink Anderson, Rev Gary Davis, Robert Petway, Robert Johnson, Roosevelt Sykes, Sam Chatmon, Scrapper Blackwell, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Skip James, 'Sleepy' John Estes, Son House, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Sonny Terry, Speckled Red, Sylvester Weaver, Tampa Red, (Georgia Tom) Thomas A Dorsey, Tommy Johnson, Tommy McClennan, Victoria Spivey, Walter ""Furry"" Lewis, Washboard Sam, Willie Brown* and Yank Rachell.

blues,3dcn8b,geocynic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, yes, I'm saying that T-Bone Walker could do no wrong. Second and more importantly, here's the problem: I've got a big ol' hodgepodge collection of T-Bone songs and almost none from albums. Why? Because in the time where he was really active, it was more common to release singles than albums. Long-form just hadn't become a thing yet. Stormy Monday, for example, was a B Side not part of an album. As was many of his hits. So it's very hard to actually answer this question, since most of what you'll find is reissue collections.    youseewhatyouget's suggestion of ""T-Bone Blues on Atlantic"" is referring to Atlantic Records' album ""T-Bone Blues"" but again, that was basically an album that was a hodgepodge of singles over something like a decade.   So really, the nature of the question may not get you the answers you're looking for. People who love T-Bone maybe have to put in a little effort to curate a collection as a result."

blues,3cg3sx,crypticthree,2,Tue Jul 7 17:21:13 2015 UTC,or maybe the folk revivalist (see Dylan et al) that introduced said Brits to roots blues?
blues,3cg3sx,crypticthree,0,Wed Jul 8 14:01:14 2015 UTC,"No - Clapton and Page studied the records of Albert King, Muddy Waters ( that were not easy to get in London in the late 1950's. Dylan learned from the blues masters as well. Elmore James, Blind Willie Johnson. In fact didn't Dylan cover that BWJ song?"
blues,3cg3sx,newaccount,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"The folk revival in New York coupled with the ascendance of R&B and Rock and Roll is why you could get Albert King and Buddy Waters albums in London, difficult as though it was. Dylan famously broke into a record collectors house in order to listen to roots blues in Duluth Minnesota which was not a hot bed of African American Music.  That Blind Willie Johnson song is called ""Jesus make up my Dying Bed,"" Dylan recorded it under the name ""In My Time of Dying."" It's actually a very old gospel song, and it was covered my other blues greats such as Bessie Smith and Charlie Patton. Dylan covered a lot of traditional blues tunes on his first record, including ""House of the Rising Sun,"" and Bukka White's ""Fixin to Die"" blues."
blues,3cg3sx,newaccount,0,Wed Jul 8 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"Dylan's sensibilities for blues were great. He was American so blues was nothing new to him. It was the middle class white American baby-boomers that did not idolize the blues until the British Invasion of the Stones, Beatles, Kinks, Clapton and gang. This is what American kids embraced. They were given an education in the Blues as the Brits even formally introduced Howlin Wolf and similar to an audience that was listening to Doris Day and Pat Boone. They knew nothing of the Blues born in their back yard - because the music was considered ""black""."
blues,3cg3sx,newaccount,2,Wed Jul 8 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"except all the beats hanging out in Greenwich Village in the fifties.  >During the 1950s, the growing folk-music crowd that had developed in the United States began to buy records by older, traditional musicians from the Southeastern hill country and from urban inner-cities. New LP compilations of commercial 78-rpm race and hillbilly studio recordings stretching back to the 1920s and 1930s were published by major record labels. The expanding market in LP records increased the availability of folk-music field recordings originally made by John and Alan Lomax and other collectors during the New Deal era of the 1930s and 40s. Small record labels, such as Yazoo Records, grew up to distribute reissued older recordings and to make new recordings of the survivors among these artists. This was how many urban white American audiences of the 1950s and 60s first heard country blues and especially Delta blues that had been recorded by Mississippi folk artists 30 or 40 years before.  Sure the weren't the mainstream, but innovators are rarely mainstream."

blues,3cg3sx,newaccount,0,Wed Jul 8 00:42:33 2015 UTC,Elvis? He introduced made race records for a white audience. But he was rock and roll - not blues. There is a distinction that 99% of musicologists will acknowledge.
blues,3cg3sx,Dannyt07,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:01:20 2015 UTC,And the British Invasion wasn't rock and roll?
blues,3cg3sx,BobLoBlahLaw,-1,Wed Jul 8 07:15:24 2015 UTC,"Yes it was - but it was not the rock and roll of Chubby Checkers and Little Richards and Elvis. It was more progressive. The blues was expanded in manners that became staples. Listen to ""I Can't Quit You Babe"" on Zeppelin I. They were raised on Elvis - but not playing that style of music - that way. It is better to call it ""rock"" than ""Rock and Roll"""
blues,3cg3sx,Dannyt07,3,Wed Jul 8 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"Twist and Shout by the Beatles isn't the same rock and roll as Chubby Checker?  Led Zeppelin came after the British Invasion, BTW. The invasion is general seen as 1963 - 65, or there abouts, and had quite a different sound to the later Muddy Waters inspired British blues acts like the Yardbirds and John Mayall that lead to CReam, Zeppelin etc. Zeppelin's first album was '69.  2 years before ""I Can't Quit you Baby"" was recorded, a guy called Jimi Hendrix had a number 5 album on the mainstream charts, with a song called ""Red House"" on it. If you haven't heard it, it's a straight 12 bar.  But 13 years earlier, Elvis was releasing stuff like this cover of a Robert Johnson/Sleepy John Estes song as the A side of a single."
blues,3cg3sx,Knailsic,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:32:54 2015 UTC,The point is not who did what when. The point is when did the music become embraced - that was really embraced by the baby boomers as blues. The Stones formally presented Howlin Wolf and similar. This is the phenomena that cause the BB King to have a charting record on the pop charts.   The kids were not musiccologists. They had to be told the stuff they were screaming to was a British interpretation of Black Music of all sorts with a heavy blues foundation.
blues,3cg3sx,bluesnoodler_,3,Wed Jul 8 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"The point is not who did what when.    Yes, it is exactly your point:   the British Invasion bands that basically introduced white America to the Blues!   Elvis, if any one artsist,  introduced white America to the blues, a decade and a half before the Brits. He was the biggest artist in the world, he played to a white audience, and blues were a big part of his repertoire.  Before the British Invasion was the ""Blues Revival"" of the late 50s and 60s which is when white audiences really got into blues. Guys like Mississippi John hurt playing in front of tens of thousand white people.   But I reckon John and Alan Lomax deserve most of the credit. Their field recordings turned the 50s crowds onto traditional tunes, guys like Elvis and Dylan took it further. By the time Zep arrived, white audiences were pretty familiar with the blues."
blues,3cg3sx,bluesnoodler_,-2,Wed Jul 8 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"introduced white America to the blues   That was a form of blues - rock and roll.   We can talk about it all day. Why not listen to what Muddy Waters has to say?  He explains the whole thing.   Before the British Invasion was the ""Blues Revival"" of the late 50s and 60s which is when white audiences really got into blues.    You obviously know nothing about Jim Crow."
blues,3cg3sx,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed Jul 8 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"?????  The Lomax's recorded guys like Muddy Waters before anyone else. That's what kick started the blues revival, alongside guys like Elvis getting chart success playing blues. 15 years before the British Invasion.  Led Zeppelin was my favourite band for a good 10 years, but it's really just plain wrong to think guys like that introduced white America to the blues. Dylan was a superstar by that time, and half his early records are blues covers.   Talk all you want, but history isn't going to change because you are ignorant of it."

blues,3bu1x0,Zygnah,3,Thu Jul 2 03:49:17 2015 UTC,Albert King truly is the king of the blues. His playing is concise and original and full of feeling. And he was a great singer. BB got all the praise but Albert had him beat in every category -(aside from face-contorting while he played;BB was tops in that).
blues,3bu1x0,Moveover33,2,Thu Jul 2 13:56:36 2015 UTC,I agree that Albert was truly the king. His tone and attack are legendary. He has a way of gliding through a song with these precise lines that are both soaring and screaming. His control of dynamics is another dimension of his playing that requires attending. I've also often thought Stevie Ray Vaughan derived a solid 80% of his sound from King. Thanks for the post.
blues,3bu1x0,krazilec,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"I meant to respond way back (OP here).  I don't really agree with that statement.  It turned into songs with very similar patterns.  His own style wasn't super varied.  What set him apart from B.B. was the ability to improvise.  Not that B.B. couldn't, but he just didn't do live/studio sets like King.  B.B. King clearly had far more a varied styles and inventive songs, not playing, but the notes themselves.  I don't think it's fair to compare anyway.  B.B. deserves all the praise he's been given.  In fact, I used to hear far more negatives than positives.  People hear the past 25 years of slow, cheesy Blues and think that's how it's always been.  I think there was a reason Albert King was noticed far later in his life than B.B. King.  B.B. King's early stuff is fucking killer.  edit:  Also I didn't notice this was a cut version.  It doesn't include one of my favorites parts."

blues,3bg76r,hugsandhomies,2,Mon Jun 29 03:05:05 2015 UTC,"Since you're trying to help transition people from rock n roll to the blues, I would suggest ""The London Sessions"" by Howlin' Wolf. It's Blues Legend Howlin' Wolf singing all his classic songs, but his backing band should interest any rock enthusiast: Eric Clapton on lead guitar, Steve Winwood on piano, and the Rolling Stones' Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts on bass and drums (Ringo also sits in on the drums for one song). And to help maintain Howlin' Wolf's authentic blues sound, Wolf's own guitarist Hubert Sumlin plays alongside Clapton. Hopefully your friends will be interested enough in the lineup and then stick around for the infectious grooves.   Another good choice would be ""Born Under a Bad Sign"" by Albert King. If your friends like Eric Clapton's lead guitar style during his time with Cream, then they're bound to like Albert King, since Clapton's Cream-era sound is largely an imitation of Albert King. If you listen closely, you'll even notice that Clapton has used bits and pieces of King's solos in his Cream-era work. I'm not trying to put down or devalue Clapton's work at all, just pointing out the extent of King's influence on Clapton's early style.  I can give you other suggestions if you're interested. I also got into the blues through rock n roll, so I can at least point out some artists and albums that contribute to my own appreciation of the blues. Good luck.   Edit: I'll also add that Albert King's backing band on ""Born Under a Bad Sign"" is the legendary instrumental group Booker T. and the M.G.'s. There worth exploring in their own right if you haven't gotten into them already."
blues,3bg76r,flabcannon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:19:37 2015 UTC,Eric Clapton was my intro to blues - heard Layla 15 years ago and slowly expanded into his other albums/covers/collaborations.

blues,3b57av,808strafe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"It is simple music theory. Most songs from blues - to jazz - to punk - to classical can be explained in simple music theory. But the part that makes the music an emotionally dramatic and soul stirring art is more elusive. I can explain to a person what falling in love feels like . Or lets say I can explain to a teenage boy how to get a girl - but love, and getting a girl have very deep effects on a human life depending on so many factors. Same with music.   The interesting thing about blues is emotion. It generates emotion in the listener. Two musicians can play ""Red Houser"" and one may play like a load of shit while the other is pure genius. They can follow the same chords - same lyrics - but how different are they! In fact it may make the genius that much more pronounced if you are working within limited parameters.   Dylan could take two chords and do more with them than Arcade fire can do with 10 LPs."
blues,3b57av,MinorSeventh94,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:39:40 2015 UTC,"The form is clear cut and repetitive.  The form is what let's you know that you are listening to a blues song.

The idea was that really poor musicians without any formal training could learn a basic structure and then use that to get anything they wanted out of it. In my opinion, at least, as long as it has the appropriate mood anything is a blues song, but using this pattern does mean you can very easily make one."

Kokomo Arnold's ""Sagefield Woman Blues"" and ""Sissy Man Blues"", which are also considered ancestral to ""Dust My Broom"", are definitely played with a slide, but I don't really hear that lick.  So maybe it really is an Elmore James original, or from another Robert Johnson or Son House song, but I can't seem to find it."

Terminator 2 came out in the Winter of 1990-1 the July 4th weekend of 1991, if I remember correctly, and the CGI in that was revolutionary. Michael Jackson later used the same technique at the very end of his ""Black or White"" video, which came out a few months later, I believe. Toy Story didn't come out until 1995.  It's likely that Crossroads used a body double for the shot.

First off, good job with the production values and humor. The episode flowed pretty seamlessly. However, you need to work on your looks. Meaning, you. If you want people to watch your videos, you have to look more confident and comfortable. Your posture looks awful, and its distracting. This new guy you have blows you out of the water, which is the opposite problem you had with the old guy, who seemed to be holding you back. But now your flaws are more noticeable. Am I the only one who is thinking this?"
blues,3a3wpa,icculustheprophet,9,Wed Jun 17 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"For the record, I recognize all of their insane talent. I couldn't put a candle to even one of their 'easiest' licks. You can see once they start shredding away the tune gets better. But the first couple rounds of solos are just a great testament to the soul argument blues musicians tout frequently."
blues,3a3wpa,buddythebear,11,Wed Jun 17 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"To be fair it kind of sounds not great because there are four different guitarists doing their own thing and it's not super cohesive. If any of them was asked to play the song by themselves, they'd be better able to put their own spin on it and make it their own. I'm sure there would be just as much of soul from any of them in that case."
blues,3a3wpa,wow_looksgreat,7,Wed Jun 17 01:37:30 2015 UTC,idk about that. Its music. Just because there are four guitar player doesn't mean they can't do something musically cohesive. They just need to think a bit.
blues,3a3wpa,haberdasher42,5,Wed Jun 17 02:17:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes jamming sounds rough, sometimes you make magic.  There's usually a bit of roughness before you find that groove, it's part of making music.  Though, it would be kinda weird for those guys to drop their signature style at one of their shows.  They play with soul, but it's not Blues soul.  It's a whole other kettle of fish, and it can be great.   That said, I need my guitar tricks in small doses, it's technically proficient, but sometimes it feels like listening to someone masturbate."
blues,3a3wpa,bluesnoodler_,6,Wed Jun 17 03:28:56 2015 UTC,"So your assertion is that there is no ""technical prowess"" involved in playing blues.  I would contend that it takes just as much time in the woodshed to learn to play slide as it does to sweep arpeggios. It takes more time in the woodshed to learn how to map out a bass line, harmony and melody simultaneously like Willie Brown than any shred technique and imo shows more ""technical prowess"". Developing a great vibrato on top of a bend takes years. ""Shred"" guitar requires no more ""technical prowess"" than any other genre. It's a complete misconception. I would add that blues leads are generally improvised on the spot, not worked out to metronome in one's bedroom for 6 months. Then there is learning the idiomatic vernacular. The language. I respect shred players and do enjoy listening to shred guitar, but the idea that it is somehow more ""technical"" than any other genre is a misconception.  Edit: I guess it would be better to say that shred technique doesn't help much when playing blues, which requires a whole other set of techniques. One shredder who can play blues is Paul Gilbert."
blues,3a3wpa,carmour,2,Wed Jun 17 12:19:27 2015 UTC,"The comment ""blues as a style has little to do with technical prowess"" does not necessarily mean that ""there is no technical prowess involved in playing blues"".  Surely it just means that technique alone will not get you there. You need more than that.   You have points though. Shred is a more flashy and in your face form of technique. The stuff you learn in blues is way more subtle, but more musical imo."
blues,3a3wpa,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:05:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I guess it just chapped my butt a bit to visit a blues sub and see the words ""Proof that blues as a style has little to do with technical prowess"". It tacitly implies that there is somehow no technique involved in playing the various styles of blues, when there is a tonne of technique involved. It's just a different set of techniques. But yeah, I get that the sentiment was more meant to say that technique alone isn't enough. Satch played a few decent licks in there at the start, so it wasn't all bad."

These guys are playing blues THEIR way like all blues artist. Mike Keneally is playing both guitar, keyboards and singing like a boss! Tosin is going complete jazz/blues on it. I mean that dude is a Prog metal 8 string machine doing a very good job! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzwBEO9QBj4 here is Mike and Brendon (Also they're half Dethklok) playing a very fusion Jeff Beck song. Starts at 2:50.   These guys know the blues and do it very well and for you to say they're stumbling over this is ridiculous. Stuck up blues fans/artists are the worst. When I was down in Memphis I saw so many older guys at this jam not wanting to give anyone a chance to show their way of playing the blues.

Like John Mayer, if he never wrote ""your body's a wonderland"" he never would've been able to make a trio album with Pino and Steve Jordan.   Trust me dude. The music industry is ruthless. You gotta find a way to make noise. Ridiculous videos are how I do it. And at the end of the day, they're super fun to make and bring happiness to the vast majority of viewers. I don't see the negativity."

Do you not think you are capable of making a living doing the music you actually want to do? Or do you genuinely want to make a living from music by making gimmicky youtube videos?  I totally still dig Cream era Clapton, and he was one of my favourites when I was first getting into blues, I just can't listen to him anymore. I don't want to hear him do Further On Up The Road, I wanna hear Bobby Bland do it. When you compare him to the originators of the genre, he just falls short everytime. He would be the first to admit this.  It's totally your prerogative to do what you're doing, but you gotta know that making manufactured, gimicky 'viral' you tube videos where you appropriate a music born of poverty and slavery, mix it with hip late 80s pop culture to sell suits is the fucking height of capitalist, wannabe, fame-shagging douchebaggery.   That's my 2c for free anyway."

A while ago I found a very young girl singing it, and she said ""you see a girl get mean"" and usually people flex their muscles at this part and it was so damn cute.  Check out his unplugged too.

blues,38de1h,strickenchickencluck,11,Wed Jun 3 14:17:07 2015 UTC,"Completely earnest question, and no offense intended to OP - do people on /r/blues enjoy Joe Bonamassa? He seems like a prime example of all chops, no soul to me. When I listen to him, I just hear a Berkelee School of Music style blues factory player, but I'd love to have some demonstration to convince me otherwise."
blues,38de1h,fakejoebiden,5,Wed Jun 3 14:39:57 2015 UTC,"For me: Joe Bonamassa is the most technically gifted blues guitar player, whose music I can't stand listening to. Ordinarily this would elicit a ""who cares"", ""his fans like like him, whatever"", ""Famous for being a guitar player since he was twelve"" type reaction from me, but his shameless PR and egotistical self-promotion (right around that #1 selling blues musician ad push and the crying about not being written about in Rolling Stone) really turn me off to him. Now it just annoys me when I saw full billboards for ""the guitar event of the year"" over a rich kid who plays Eric Johnson licks over ZZ Top covers."
blues,38de1h,GuitarCD,4,Wed Jun 3 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"I treat Bonamassa the same way I treat Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, etc.; it's ""fun"" to listen to such technically skilled guitarists, but the unrelenting ""look at me!"" style wears on me after a couple of songs. Bonamassa seems to fit squarely into the category of solo metal guitar shredders, except that he happened to choose blues-rock as his genre."
blues,38de1h,cahruhr,3,Wed Jun 3 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"He's obviously talented but I agree with you and the other folks posting here, his playing has no soul.  I honestly enjoy looking at his guitar collection more than hearing his music haha."
blues,38de1h,TheSouthernThing,2,Wed Jun 3 19:47:25 2015 UTC,"After watching this for a bit I had to watch ZZ Top do it (Just Got Paid) on Youtube. Even though they aren't blues ""purists"" either, their version, at least in my opinion, has more soul. And I think Billy Gibbons is just a great underappreciated guitar player."
blues,38de1h,neurad1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of opinions that echo mine. Very talented but every time I hear him I want to listen to someone else afterwards.   Someone mentioned satch and maybe Johnson below and they are sort of the same for me but, they do have at least one song each that I enjoy.   I play guitar (and suck compared to any of them) and WANT to like them but I feel musically cold afterwards and bonnamossa leads the pack for me in that regards."
blues,38de1h,tanukis_parachute,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:42:15 2015 UTC,The fact that this video is 12 minutes long lets me know it's 10 minutes of Joe doing a metal solo over a blues track

blues,38aq2q,EtherCJ,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:08:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Here's an excerpt from the Calt/Wardlow book on Patton:  ""...Patton's remarkably animated recording of Spoonful, a 'rag' ditty celebrating cocaine addiction that may have dated to the turn of the century, when the Memphis Commercial Appeal reckoned that 80% of the city's blacks used the drug (available for a nickel or dime at pharmacies).""    Wolf's 'Spoonful' was 'written' by Willie Dixon, who although awfully good at suing people who ripped him off, was quite happy to pass off others' work as his own.  (Granted, there is plenty of original material in 'Spoonful', but 'trad/Dixon' would have been a more honest attribution)."

blues,38aq2q,doorpimp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:58:37 2015 UTC,I think you're mixing up Lovin' Spoonful with the band 10cc. Supposedly 10cc was the average amount of ejaculate and they named themselves after that. I had no idea the Lovin' Spoonful also were named for Man Milk.
blues,38aq2q,RichHixson,2,Wed Jun 3 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"Lol, of these jizz related band names. Pearl Jam too...  I saw a wiki entry about the Lovin' Spoonfuls name as StoogeKabab mentioned.   As for the song OP was talking about, I think it's probably cocaine but EtherCJ raises an interesting idea..."
blues,38aq2q,doorpimp,0,Wed Jun 3 21:08:30 2015 UTC,Indeed Lovin' Spoonful was named for the Mississippi John Hurt song about exactly that. Confirmed by member John Sebastian in a DVD lesson teaching Mississippi John Hurt's songs.  edit: updated information.

blues,385215,Ihatebird,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:24:40 2015 UTC,"I read in one of Eric Clapton's biographies that he started using more key changes in his songs after watching Bob Dylan perform live. Seems in order to keep his backing band from mentally drifting, and on their toes, Bob would throw in random key changes while on stage. Clapton said that Dylan was keenly aware of every note being played on stage even though his back was to the band. In Clapton's words, Dylan was ""backless."" Hence the title of one of Clapton's albums.  To answer your specific question, I can't think of any other musician who puts four key changes in one song."

He is accompanied by US session musicians and various British R&B musicians, including Alexis Korner and Rick Wright, as well as members of Spooky Tooth and Humble Pie.  The album was released in the United Kingdom on November 19, 1971 in order to coincide with the first date of King's tour of the country.   Wright and his female companion Fritz started a short-lived blues-based band Sunrise which came to an end after Wright's death in a car accident. John Lennon had announced that he would perform on some of the tracks, but ended up having no involvement with the album.     Image i     Interesting: Live in Cook County Jail | L.A.

I will always remember how he talked and played seamlessly transitioning from one to the other, telling stories that became songs, singing songs that lead into stories. I've never heard anything like it since and doubt that I ever will. It felt like a conversation between B.B. and the audience. B.B. was the last true Chicago Bluesmen, and he played the Chicago style better than anyone else. The style that started with Robert Nighthawk, was made famous Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, reach its peak with B.B.. When the Rolling Stones, Beatles, and Eric Clapton came to America to find the Blues they listened to on scratchy records back in England, they found B.B. King in Chicago, and he was more then they could have wished for. And B.B. heard them, too. The best Bluesmen never seem satisfied with the Blues, and they always start stealing from other styles, Robert Johnson from Ragtime, Jimi Hendrix from Jazz, Jack White from Punk. B.B. took from Rock and Roll. Cream, the Stones, even Zeppelin thought they were playing Blues Rock, but B.B. showed them how it was really done.  The Blues just left Chicago."

They put trance music all night and spreaded ham and cheese on the tables and cooked and ate it and there were bread crambs everywhere and ham juices and glasses and smoke and ash and they were loud and drunk.  Turns out one of these douches stole a large amount of money...and actually turns out the douche that stole that pack of cash was actually my sister's bff.  So you can imagine the disrespect these assholes showed to me, my house and my sister.  In the early morning hours I showered well, and locked myself in my room. But some B.B. King and slept like a baby.  You will never be able to understand what B.B. King sounds like after a long dirty night of loud trance music.  This is the end of an era. Literally.  I dont know when the world will be lucky enough to have someone as awesome as B.B. King.  It was in the back of everyones' head. One day, the world will be left without B.B. King. And that day has come."

BB King has always held a place in my heart, and he's been my favorite artist since I was 15 and first listened to ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"". His music has helped me through some really hard times in my life, and I hate that I'll never get to see him or meet in him person, but I'm happy that he lived a long and successful life. He's been playing the guitar since 1937, he had to put it down someday."
