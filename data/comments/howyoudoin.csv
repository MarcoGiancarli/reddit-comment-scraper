TV sets like that have lots of huge lights to get a good shot, which raises the temperature considerably. So to balance that the AC is cranked all the way up.

howyoudoin,3dykyl,DaneelR,11,Mon Jul 20 20:01:29 2015 UTC,"The style of the show is definitely different the first two seasons so I can definitely see where you're coming from. I still like them mostly because on my last rewatch I enjoyed comparing small little details (in between scene music for example). Also the characters really didn't start developing distinct personality traits until later on towards the 3 season.  The first time I noticed Monica cleaning was in the first season so that she wouldn't be criticized by her mom when she visited, which later on becomes redundant because Monica cleans because that's just who she is."
howyoudoin,3dykyl,CLPolly,12,Mon Jul 20 16:29:39 2015 UTC,"Monica being clean and obsessive was definitely a character trait early on, just not as prominent.

For example, when Rachel and Monica are looking after Ben and they bang his head. To me it always sounded like Ben was saying 'Monica Bing' not 'Monica Bang'. I know this isn't true but that's all I can hear when I watch it.  Another example could simply be back in season 3 at the beach, where Chandler constantly pestered Monica about why she wouldn't date him, even if he was the last guy on earth, when they were married with children by the end of the series.  TL;DR - Banging Bens head bestowed him with the power to see into the future, Mondler irony."

I always thought that was really sweet because in a way, she always did love Ross, and Emma was definitely a keeper."

I see it as she was really caught off guard by things like that being said by someone she thought loved her, and not just said, but written down and compared to another woman. It was most likely a moment of emotional shock. However, thinking of and somewhat comparing the qualities of women is something men do;  to Ross, and most guys(I'm a guy) it's the logical thing to do. Although it's probably not the best idea to write it down, and I understand her reaction."
howyoudoin,3dwrvo,dominicbears,5,Mon Jul 20 10:52:10 2015 UTC,"Well, for one thing he mainly listed negative qualities about Rachel.  Secondly, the main problem is that it makes it look like his dilemma is a logical one (""which relationship would I benefit the most from"") rather than an emotional one (""which person do I want to be with"")."
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,GellerWillickBunch,70,Sun Jul 19 05:45:59 2015 UTC,"I genuinely liked Richard and Monica together. Don't get me wrong, Chandler and Monica are perfect for each other, but there was nothing inherently wrong with Richard. He wasn't annoying like Janice. He wasn't controlling like Emily. He was good for her, and she was good for him.  Their breakup was for a real reason. I also love the line, ""I guess we just keep dancing."" Because, really, the world doesn't come screeching to a halt for a personal tragedy, and all you can do is just keep dancing."
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,DasScarecrow,28,Sun Jul 19 08:53:10 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. I gained a whole new perspective on Monica's character and how strong she is for making a decision like that.
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,CloudyWithRain,21,Sun Jul 19 11:21:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of these comments. I felt like Richard truly brought out the best in Monica. She respected him as an equal whereas with Chandler, she seems to patronize him.   The only thing that bothers me is they broke up because he said ""if I have to"" so many times, yet when he comes back when Chandler won't propose fast enough, she asks where all this was years ago. Richard was always willing to do it to be with her. It didn't just come up out of nowhere years later after missing her."
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,twalker294,29,Sun Jul 19 14:08:54 2015 UTC,This is a very well acted scene by both of them. You can see how torn Monica is when she realizes that Richard would only be having kids for her and that's a recipe for disaster. Too bad more people I real life aren't as mature as she is in making that kind of tough decision.
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,butterfeddumptruck,24,Sun Jul 19 08:22:18 2015 UTC,She's putting what's best for children who don't even exist yet before her own desires.  That's exactly what Chandler meant in the last season when he tells their children's birth mother that Monica is a mother without a child.  I wish more women I knew who actually already are mothers could achieve this level of maturity instead of behaving in a way that satisfies their own ego before doing what's truly best for their child.
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,Ball-Fondler,13,Sun Jul 19 12:24:06 2015 UTC,"I never thought about it that Monica said that for her future kids' sake. I always thought she did it for Richard, she didn't want to force him into doing something he said he didn't want 17 times."

It was his second marriage and he had kids in the first one that were close to grown.   When she was 18, her dad was in his mid-70s. There were definitely some father issues back then. And now she's almost 30 and he's suffering from dementia or something comparable. Her relationship with him is much healthier now, since she's now acting as partial caretaker with her mother, but it's rough on her."

howyoudoin,3dt7w2,twinsocks,3,Mon Jul 20 00:49:25 2015 UTC,"God me too. Their entire relationship is such a sore point for me. Downvote me all you want fans, Monica and Richard were the best couple in the entire series. Monica is the least meanest main character by a long shot (tied with Joey, but he fucks up a LOT out of ignorance), and Richard was the coolest and kindest guy she ever dated."
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,strifeblood,17,Sun Jul 19 13:07:40 2015 UTC,"The least meanest was Monica?! I'm sorry, but I disagree. I loved Monica the first five seasons of Friends. She felt like a real person with some quirks. After she started dating Chandler, she became this flanderized version of herself and she becomes my least favorite character in the show. I'm guessing she worked better when everybody would make fun of her, but when she started dating Chandler the dynamic went from all the friends laughing at her quirks to Monica jokingly insult Chandler. Phoebe was by far the meanest by the end, but at least she was interesting and occasionally funny. Monica was both mean and not funny/uninteresting. She becomes this bossy, whiny, hypocritical, obsessive, selfish and jealous person. I also find it mildly irritating how the show makes all these jokes (I know, different times and all but it's still a bit annoying) about how Chandler is so lucky to have her, when in reality she was lucky anybody stayed with somebody as crazy as her.  I could literally go through each episode's summary post-London and remember like a dozen mean things she does each season for like the last five seasons."
howyoudoin,3dt7w2,audhepcat,9,Sun Jul 19 13:55:08 2015 UTC,I love this analysis of Monica and how her relationships with Richard and Chandler shaped her personality.

howyoudoin,3dt7w2,k_lynn23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"That was a good read, though I think the Joey analysis was my favorite. Now I'm curious who he's going to pick for Chandler's soulmate."
howyoudoin,3dua0y,adip611,6,Sun Jul 19 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"I remember noticing that they spent a lot of time just chatting in Central Perk, more than in other episodes, and the things they chatted about weren't much to do with the plot."
howyoudoin,3dua0y,caret-top,6,Sun Jul 19 19:51:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, season 1 had tons of ""filler"" dialogues, just the guys hanging out. In a sense it's a cheap way to insert jokes without thinking of the plot, but I kinda liked it."
howyoudoin,3dua0y,SagaCult,2,Mon Jul 20 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it was kind of influenced by Seinfeld in some way, which heavily used this trope."
howyoudoin,3dua0y,Schnutzel,4,Mon Jul 20 07:25:10 2015 UTC,"If you haven't I suggest watching the episodes from DVD with commentary.  You will see that mostly the reason why there were chatting in central perk so much is cost.  ""TOW No One's Ready"" (one of my top 5) has commentary and they explain why that episode was perfect and it has to do with that it was one set which is way cheaper. Also a lot of times the plot of a story when it is being shot as a pilot is vague at best and develops over time.  So you had characters that were not developed that they had to do (remember there were 6 of them), then you had to set some of the stage for the show.  You have to have a lot of character building dialog that may not be anything about the show's direction etc."
howyoudoin,3dua0y,thegreatcerebral,2,Mon Jul 20 00:55:09 2015 UTC,I've watched all the commentary and behind the scenes in the DVD versions. They explained how keeping one set was to save money and also happened to be one of most fun episodes to shoot. Like the one where they all are trying to get ready for Ross's thing and the glass of fat. Having two sets was to save money yet a brilliant episode
howyoudoin,3dua0y,robbyross,3,Mon Jul 20 16:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'm currently researching the series and I'm catching on little hints and laughing just as much as before! I kind of forgotten a few things because it's been almost 7 months since I watched the series, yet it is still hilarious!"

howyoudoin,3dqyxf,chuckyhacks,91,Sat Jul 18 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"Hadn't they not spoken or seen each other in years? Plus Rachel would not have been interested in being friends with Monica after high school, her standard of living was higher."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,thesockbunny,42,Sat Jul 18 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"But with all their past flashbacks and such, they were best friends all the way into college. I mean they were pretty obviously really close. The last time we see them together was their first or second year of college, so they were around 20. One of the thanksgivings was their first year of college. When the show starts they are like 24/25? To me it doesn't seem that long of a time to not invite your best friend."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,feralcatromance,49,Sat Jul 18 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"Monica says she's 26 in season 1, although their ages weren't super consistent."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,hi_angie,10,Sat Jul 18 17:21:09 2015 UTC,Oh OK. I remember Joey being 25 so I said that.
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,feralcatromance,34,Sat Jul 18 17:30:12 2015 UTC,That's true but I feel like Rachel was very spoiled and obsessed with her image so she wouldn't want to stay friends with anyone who was making their own way. For the first few episodes she is shocked how the other Friends live and work.

howyoudoin,3dqyxf,mem1003,10,Sun Jul 19 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, it could be a retcon thing, I remember her acting like they hadn't seen each other in a long time when Rachel shows up. I don't know everything, or anything really, but I seem to remember the pilot making a big deal over them having grown quite apart"
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,ntrotter11,6,Sat Jul 18 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"It's easy to be best friends when you live in the same town, it's also easy to lose touch (especially before facebook) with people once you live in different places, have different jobs, hang out with different people, it's amazing and sad how quickly we can lose touch with people"
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,tc1991,7,Sun Jul 19 08:24:13 2015 UTC,"Aren't there some references to big feuds they had over some boy or other? I can't remember any specific names (better rewatch all the seasons again!) but I feel like it was probably a massive argument along those lines that made them fall out, rather than gradually losing touch."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,insinceregiraffe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:15:47 2015 UTC,I swear the row was over the guy Rachel was marrying but I could be wrong.
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,redfroggy,8,Sun Jul 19 02:06:05 2015 UTC,Barry? No way.
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,jaydee_says,30,Sun Jul 19 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"I had a really good friend in high school who I hung out with in a group of 3.  We saw it each other some on the holidays during the first year of college, but I never saw her after freshman year.  Flash forward 4 years later, and I didn't invite her.  We were trying to keep the guest list to family (50 people) and close friends (30 people) so we didn't invite people we hadn't seen in 4 years.  Call it what it is, but Emily could have been my Rachel.   We didn't have a fight- just grew apart just as many HS friends do.  (I still talk to the 3rd person in that group almost daily though and she was my Maid of Honor)"
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,pinecone44,16,Sat Jul 18 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"When they ran into each other about a year before the wedding (right around the time Joey met Chandler), Rachel ran into Monica and filled her in about the wedding. It seems by age ~25 they had become strangers, and in the pilot Rachel mentioned that she hoped the fact Monica had not been invited wouldn't be a problem when she came to her for help. I think the last flashback we seem them as close friends, they're still in high school attending a party at Ross & Chandler's college, but we never see them as friends during or after college."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,corilee93,9,Sat Jul 18 22:32:06 2015 UTC,They're definitely still friends in college. In a thanksgiving flashback episode Rachel tells Judy she changed her major because there was never any parking near the psychology building.
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,NotElizaHenry,8,Sat Jul 18 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Thanksgiving of freshman year is only 2-3 months into college."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,Fridaypenis,3,Sun Jul 19 06:17:28 2015 UTC,"Monica even says something to the effect of ""I hope I never have to see her again"" or something like that."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,NinjaUnicorn_17,4,Sat Jul 18 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"That episode where Monica says that is The One That Could Have Been. Nothing in the episode actually happened.   It always bothered me when Ross was talking to a girl (Mona or Charlie?) and she mentions an ex being gay or something and he mentions the attempted threesome that happened in that episode, because it did not really happen."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,IAmDrogonAMA,13,Sat Jul 18 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're conflating ""The One that Could Have Been"" and ""The One with the Flashback""."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,nicostinykitchen,18,Sun Jul 19 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"Because, prior to the first episode, Rachel had become very much like her sisters. Very spoiled and uptight I'd say that after her nose job she just decided that Monica wasn't cool enough to hang around. I could see her running in a different, more elite, social circle. Then when she becomes sick of all of it and decides to run away from that life she goes back to her only real friend."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,Thakgor,8,Sat Jul 18 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"They were best friends as kids, drifted apart, ran into each other right before the wedding (The One With the Flashbacks - Monica says to Chandler ""Five bucks says I never see her again"")... then the pilot."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,rnjbond,13,Sun Jul 19 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"I think they had just drifted apart. Different schools, new friends, etc. Plus.. If it were anything like in REAL life... I'm sure Rachel would have been a little jealous of Monica's weight loss and subsequently no longer being the ""pretty one"" and center of attention. Girls like Rachel need their ""DUFF"" to feel better about themselves lol"
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,jukedwayup,3,Sat Jul 18 17:38:25 2015 UTC,Monica and Chandler also have a backstory that has a lot of holes; their history is similar to Monica and Rachel's past.  I spent too much time thinking about it in a different thread.
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,jaydee_says,2,Sun Jul 19 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"This is what annoys me about this subbreddit, a really good post only has 4 comments on it."
howyoudoin,3dqyxf,Lanlodger,2,Sun Jul 19 10:58:32 2015 UTC,"I graduated high school at 18, went to college out of state, and when I married at 22, none of my high school friends, even my very best friends, were invited. We had just drifted apart from each other. Still don't have any real contact with them, except superficial stuff on Facebook.   I think it's important to remember this was before the time of cell phones and social media. If you didn't see your friends in person every day, it was really hard to make the effort to stay in touch, especially when you were in an environment like college, with social opportunities galore."

howyoudoin,3di9si,Monkeymack,6,Thu Jul 16 16:46:57 2015 UTC,I skip the ones where Joey starts to like Rachel and vice versa.
howyoudoin,3di9si,pinkspencer,4,Thu Jul 16 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"I usually skip when Ross starts to obsess with jealousy and the breakup itself.

If I'd of caught the pilot as the first episode I saw, I'd of never bothered watching it again. I think the humour is better in the later seasons. Maybe because I'm British."

My friend loved it from the start and I just didn't get it at all. A lot of the early jokes for me just fall flat. I HATE Susan and Carol. The acting is pretty poor and the characters characteristics are really pushed too much. I much prefer later on. Horses for courses, I suppose!"

Chandler: (laughs) Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah, that's true.    ...    Chandler: I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. (everyone lights) So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.  Ken: That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...  Chandler: (loud) Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.  Ken: I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?  Chandler: I always liked you, Ken.

howyoudoin,3ddvtv,parabola01,10,Wed Jul 15 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"Matthew Perry's timing has always been impeccable which is why I find his acting a little weird on Odd Couple. I think it's because he's trying to portray a cranky person, but his comedic timing has been a little off in this show."
howyoudoin,3ddvtv,hanselpremium,3,Wed Jul 15 23:24:04 2015 UTC,Hopefully it's one of those things they change between the first and second season.
howyoudoin,3ddvtv,AuburnHeatPanthers,3,Thu Jul 16 02:48:38 2015 UTC,Hopefully. I still like regularly seeing the actors even outside of Friends.

He ran on top of cabs,  got garbage thrown on him,  etc.   I feel like the show got more self contained in terms of production later on."

howyoudoin,3ddvtv,steelbubble,10,Wed Jul 15 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like maybe as the actors got paid more, they couldn't spend as much on the show itself so there will smaller sets, let outside shots, etc."

howyoudoin,3ddvtv,cheeseless_gaps,4,Wed Jul 15 21:46:04 2015 UTC,This is one of my favourite scenes of the whole series
howyoudoin,3ddvtv,Laurenzieox,47,Wed Jul 15 22:20:56 2015 UTC,I think one of the funniest scenes in the show is when Ross and Joey are saying how it's going to be awkward both wanting to get the commercial and the third guy tries to join their conversation.
howyoudoin,3ddvtv,the_dayman,19,Wed Jul 15 16:16:36 2015 UTC,Oh I thought we were just...talking.

howyoudoin,3deg0e,thegoodspiderman,3,Wed Jul 15 17:06:02 2015 UTC,In no particular order:     TOW The Embryos   TOW The Cop (PIVOT!)   TOW Ross Gets High (I don't care for the episode name though)   TOW Unagi   TOW Monica's and Chandler's Wedding   TOW Everybody Finds Out   TOW The Flashback   TOW Fake Monica (My first Friends episode)   TOW All the Resolutions TOW The Rumor
howyoudoin,3deg0e,mem1003,3,Wed Jul 15 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"TOW All the Rugby - A classic Ross, but an even more classic Chandler ""When we get to Yemen, can I live with you?"" TOW Rachel's Phone Number - I love Mike so so much, and this is the best Mike episode. ""We drank beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social behavior."" TOWout the Ski Trip - Ross vs. Rachel for the love of the Friends ""I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?"" TOW No One's Ready - Holy shit, one episode, just the apartment. Still great. ""Maybe they can change his number."" ""Yeah, I think after this, he'll do that himself."" TOW the Wedding Dress - solely for the Joshua's reaction to Rachel opening the door to find Rachel in a wedding dress. TOW Five Steaks and an Eggplant - conflict between all the Friends! You see some unlikely rivalries (Joey v. Chandler) and some unlikely alliances (Monica and Ross) TOW They're Going To Party - I just kinda like this one ""Dude we're old, we're not women."" TOW the Candy Hearts - I like the bonfire, but I love Chandler's story ""Oh man in my next life I'm coming back as a toilet brush"" TOW Monica's Thunder - I like pitting the girls against each other, makes the show feel less Battle of the Sexes ""Rachel, I don't think you and I getting together is a good idea. I'm calling it off."" TOW Eddie Moves In - One of the first lines in the spin off Joey is Joey saying ""For the last time, Chandler and I were not a gay couple!"" and this episode proves that that was a lie."

howyoudoin,3de5ak,Lanlodger,2,Wed Jul 15 23:19:39 2015 UTC,Matt LeBlanc said that he made over $30 million just from the show Joey. Although $60m is hardly poverty it seems a little low.

howyoudoin,3de5ak,Lanlodger,2,Wed Jul 15 17:19:56 2015 UTC,Jennifer Aniston is definitely still rich. And I would guess that the others are still pretty wealthy too. They've been pretty active with other acting/directing projects although nothing as huge or insanely popular as Friends. The only one I can't really say anything about at all is Matthew Perry. I know Matt LeBlanc is still acting on TV shows and Courtney Cox was in quite a few movies and TV shows even after Friends. I'm guessing they're all pretty financially safe.
howyoudoin,3de5ak,Raider6601,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:49:50 2015 UTC,According to Google Mathew Perrys net worth is $70 million.. Yeah I think he can afford that car he was saving up for..
howyoudoin,3dh7hw,whoami4546,13,Thu Jul 16 06:29:32 2015 UTC,"So basically, you want, with your first 4 points, to ruin so many of the good things about the show? IMO your first 4 changes take away a lot from the greatness of the show.   I would have liked Ross and Rachel to get back together a season or two before the end.   I think it was great, the way they handled the whole thing with Emma. We'd already seen them in a relationship earlier, we'd seen them as having crushes on each other, we'd seen them disliking each other, there was the secret marriage... Having a child out of wedlock, and dealing with that scenario was scenario which was new, and added to their characters, rather than re-visiting a simple romantic relationship.   I definitely do not want to see Joey and Rachel date.   Agreed, but I would keep it simply for TOW Ross is fine.   I would like to see more racial and gender diversity.   How do you want more gender diversity? A 50-50 split isn't good enough? As for race, I don't see how that adds to (or subtracts from) how good the show was or the stories they told."
howyoudoin,3dh7hw,mathdhruv,2,Thu Jul 16 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"I would like to see more racial and gender diversity.   I think what OP is trying to convey is the fact that there were very few appearances of people of different races. Especially given how popular that show was among young adults. I'm sure it would have made some difference, in some rural community where diversity is very minimal. Especially knowing how influential the media can be."
howyoudoin,3dh7hw,Happy-Tears,13,Thu Jul 16 21:46:03 2015 UTC,So your idea of a friends 2.0 is to pretty much make it a complete bore fest?
howyoudoin,3dh7hw,Lanlodger,3,Thu Jul 16 09:01:28 2015 UTC,"1) Her back story is outlandish, but I can make sense of it?? And her annoyances are on par with Ross'.   2) Joey got wayyyy stupid towards the end, yes. It's a common trope. I thought, towards the end, his feelings for Rachel did show a new maturity and depth to him. (Though I don't like that pairing, either.)  3) I suppose, but it isn't a deal breaker. He did get cheated on in one of his most serious and deep relationships, so I'm not surprised that he didn't get too serious until Monica, and even that took forever. I think it is believable.  4) Why? Many people are infertile, we've already had 2 pregnancy scenarios, and Chandler stopping Erica in the hall (after she storms out on them for lying) is a wonderful scene.  5) Ehh.. Ross/Rachel are end game, and I always knew that, but seeing them go through life without being together AND seeing them raise Emma with their dynamic was great to watch. Also, Rachel not getting on the plane was perfect for the finale.  6) Yes"

Right with the pilot of Happy Endings I felt like I'd known these characters and relationships for ages. The characters are all well developed, interesting and quirky and the relationships/stories shows us the depth and length of their friendships."
howyoudoin,3cyb5k,GiantKJB,6,Sun Jul 12 01:54:37 2015 UTC,"Ugh Happy Endings was SO GOOD. It reminded me of the goofy characters and witty writing in Community without the over the top meta-ness, or maybe Better Off Ted set outside of a corporate environment. It was like Friends on mushrooms with the retarded jokes from Archer. Happy Endings was incredible. What's an ira glass?"
howyoudoin,3cyb5k,sheredditedit,3,Sun Jul 12 09:05:40 2015 UTC,"Happy Endings (TV series):       Happy Endings is an American sitcom television series that ran on ABC from April 13, 2011 to May 3, 2013. The single-camera ensemble comedy originally aired as a mid-season replacement with a one-hour premiere of two back-to-back episodes starting at 9:30 pm ET/PT.  In the weeks that followed, the show continued to air back-to-back episodes that began airing at 10:00 pm ET/PT.   The show was created by David Caspe, who along with Jonathan Groff (previously a showrunner on Scrubs) served as the show's executive producers and showrunners.  On May 10, 2013, Happy Endings was canceled by ABC after three seasons. ABC's erratic scheduling of the third season, resulting in the season's lower ratings and subsequent cancellation afterwards, has been called one of the ""worst TV decisions"" of the 2012–13 television season by Vulture.

The chemistry between the 4 main characters is undeniable and it is freaking hilarious. Not to mention there are a ton of late 90s/early 2000s celebrity cameos.  Besides W&G, Cheers is fantastic and Golden Girls is my favourite sitcom of all time so I have to throw that suggestion out."
howyoudoin,3cyb5k,alanlight,8,Sun Jul 12 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"Well, it's right in the title. Friends. So pretty much any tv show set around that basis. I'd go with Parks & Rec, Community, It's Always Sunny, or even Golden Girls. Sure, the formulas aren't the same, but they're similar in ways."

Not in a bad way, I'm sure it felt refreshing being able to work with different actors after those 10 years in such close proximity.

howyoudoin,3ch35y,SoMuchMoreEagle,13,Tue Jul 7 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"Emily got so jealous and paranoid after that that I wonder if that side of her would have come out anyway in other situations. Would she have got jealous of Rachel even if Ross hadn't said her name, once she found out about their history and saw how much they hung out together?  Also they lived on different continents so unless Ross really could persuade Carol to move to London with Ben, it wouldn't have been easy."
howyoudoin,3ch35y,caret-top,5,Tue Jul 7 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"I think Emily had planned on moving to New York, based on their conversation when they got engaged.  She only changed her mind after the wedding.    Also, she was going to forgive him, but then saw him about to get on a plane to their honeymoon with Rachel."
howyoudoin,3ch35y,caret-top,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:29:35 2015 UTC,"You're right, it was later on that Ross was talking about getting his ex-wife to move to another country so he could patch things up with his new wife."
howyoudoin,3ch35y,ass_mode_activated,9,Tue Jul 7 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure I buy Emily as a jealous and paranoid person.  I think most of Emily's anger came from the timing of the whole thing.  The fact that it happened at her wedding in front of her whole family is traumatic enough that she couldn't keep it together afterwards.  Something like that could instantly and drastically change the way you see a person.  Also, if Ross hadn't said ""Rachel"", Emily would not have seen them get on the plane together for her honeymoon which was another major contributor to her jealousy.  I don't recall seeing any evidence of those qualities before the wedding."
howyoudoin,3ch35y,erkala21,10,Wed Jul 8 00:13:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm always on the Emily defence bandwagon. She never had a problem with Rachel until the wedding. I'm sorry, I'm not a particularly jealous person, but if I'm at my wedding and my husband to be says his ex gf's name, then I catch him going on our honeymoon trip with her, then he refuses to not see her, I would not stay in that marriage. I know as viewers we root for Ross and Rachel and know that nothing was going on, but I felt bad for Emily.  And chances are if Ross had gone on the honeymoon with Rachel, something would have happened."
howyoudoin,3ch35y,ass_mode_activated,4,Wed Jul 8 00:26:44 2015 UTC,"And chances are if Ross had gone on the honeymoon with Rachel, something would have happened.    I haven't considered that before.  After thinking about it you're probably right.  Rachel was head-over-heels in love with Ross at the time and Ross was emotional and vulnerable.  Even though Ross wouldn't want to as it would surely destroy his marriage, he wouldn't be able to control himself around Rachel in the state he was in."

howyoudoin,3ce3rg,dasheea,7,Tue Jul 7 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"2: “The One Where No One’s Ready” takes place entirely in Monica’s apartment because the show didn’t have a large enough budget for guest stars or additional sets.   I'm skeptical of this one.  I've always felt like there was a certain pride in doing a successful bottle episode after Seinfeld's pioneering one, although that one was a bottle episode on a devoted set, as opposed to one of the regular sets they had.  I thought this was the reason for doing TOW No One's Ready, to ""achieve"" a good bottle episode on Friends.    Also, does no one ever mention that the last, last scene of TOW NO One's Ready is on another set (albeit one that is very small)?  It's when they're at the dinner table, someone approaches Ross to talk about his speech, and Chandler comes and tells him to get out of his seat.  I feel like technically and artistically, that should invalidate it as a bottle episode, even if financially, it might be almost the same, since from that last scene you could tell it was a tiny extra set."
howyoudoin,3ce3rg,thegreatRMH,2,Tue Jul 7 11:51:08 2015 UTC,Then it seems like your second point kind of proves your first one wrong.  It wasn't supposed to be a bottle episode due to the scene at the end- they were just broke.
howyoudoin,3ce3rg,dasheea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"Could be.  In fact, I think I read somewhere (Wikipedia?) that one of the directors in the DVD mentions that that was the reason, so I guess it's true.  It's just kind of hard to believe that with 24 episodes to make in a year and Friends being that popular already in season 3 that 1 bottle episode would save them that much money.  The ability of the episode to let the characters constantly play off each other (since they're almost constantly in the same physical space) seemed to be the main point of the episode IMO."
howyoudoin,3ce3rg,hoodie92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:31:12 2015 UTC,Seinfeld didn't invent bottle episodes. Star Trek invented bottle episodes.

I used to cover my tv with a shirt too until I figured out that I can customize the TV settings for when I'm watching Netflix on the tv in my bedroom so it's dim as shit. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night so I watch it TIL I fall back asleep.

He was probably invited to Rachel and Barry's, and Ross and Carol's weddings too."

Rachel's dirty book could have been a Kindle, which I guess really wouldn't change much, except she wouldn't have been able to say that she wore out her first copy when she was with Ross. Orrrrr maybe she could say that, and then that's why she switched to a digital version."
howyoudoin,3c5e77,cheeseless_gaps,2,Sat Jul 18 03:14:48 2015 UTC,Okay one more- Phoebe could have kept in touch with David via Skype when he was in Minsk and she probably wouldn't have met/married Mike.

About what you are saying this is a clasic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK6bZj47LWs  Also for the girls: the time they were all ''brides'' in the apartment.  For the guys: the time ross moved in with Chauncey and Joseph Stalin.  That are the best i can think off.

Paul Rudd does a great job with the character and ends up being a pretty prevalent (but still minor) character by the end of the series.  Another great answer is Janice. Talk about genius writing.

Once you've done things like lived with someone, cleaned up their vomit, helped them go to the bathroom, taken them to the ER, and basically mutually supported each other through all of the ugly bits of life that no one talks about then sitting close to each other or hugging doesn't feel uncomfortable anymore.  I'm a guy and it's a way of acknowledging vulnerability which can enhance the bond between us. Again, once you're comfortable enough and have been through enough then you're fine with being close physically.  But as far as the vast majorities of friends or acquaintances?

The only other thing I can think of is when Phoebe confronts Ursula , looking for her birth certificate in Season 7, Ep 14 (TOW They All Turn Thirty), Ursula is disappointed and says, ""Oh, It's you.""  Neither one really quotes the song directly.  And like you, I googled all kinds of terms.  I mean ""Friends Pretty Huge"" turns up the first episode I described (The guy says he has a PHD, which stands for Pretty Huge... and he's cut off), so if ""Friends Lovely Lady"" doesn't give a hit in the top 20 or so, it may be a wild goose chase."

howyoudoin,3bv1ee,billionyearoldcarbon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:43:04 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   The song has been featured in several films, such as Dirty Work, Mars Attacks!, The Sweetest Thing, Grown Ups, Shrek, Guardians of the Galaxy and Wanted, American Dad as well as a cover performed in the soundtrack for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by Jack Johnson. In HBO TV show True Blood it is sung by main character Sookie, when she is drunk (Season 5, Episode 4 'We'll meet again').[4] It's also presumably playing in the elevator from Tartarus in Rick Riordan's young adult novel The House of Hades, described as ""that song about liking piña coladas and getting caught in the rain"".[5] The chorus of the song is also the cellphone ringtone of Dr. Chris Taub from the TV show House. It is also played in the CW hit show Veronica Mars, in the prison experiment S03E02, as the 'guards' uses music to intimidate the 'prisoners'."
howyoudoin,3bv1ee,billionyearoldcarbon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:49:44 2015 UTC,I don't think this is from Friends. This link lists other shows where it was played or referenced. Maybe it was Will & Grace where the scene occurred? I'm not familiar enough with the show or the others mentioned to say for sure.
howyoudoin,3byhmw,longooglite,19,Fri Jul 3 04:59:47 2015 UTC,"I've never got how people say that Friends has homophobia in it... FFS, they had an episode with a lesbian wedding, and Chandler's father was MtF, and handled pretty normally. Carol and Susan were normal women, not pandering to any gay stereotypes.  I just don't see it."
howyoudoin,3byhmw,mathdhruv,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:01:04 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, the episode where Phoebe's gay husband returns and they have the ""I'm straight"" conversation, which mirrors the ""I'm gay"" conversation a lot of gay people go (went?) through with their significant others. It was fantastic."
howyoudoin,3byhmw,Alinka_01,6,Mon Jul 13 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"Most of these are not homophobia; The show was meant to be a sitcom. It takes situations to unrealistic heights (i.e. hyperbole), to elicit laughs. That's what sitcoms do.    ""She is the MAN in the black dress""   I see nothing wrong with this one. Perhaps this is why we disagree on the homophobia bits.  The only homophobic ones I'd agree with are:-   When Chandler was showing Joey how to smoke for an acting job and his hand was ""too limp"" Ross being highly upset that Ben played with a Barbie and not a GI Joe, and then forcing one on him and taking away the toy that his son chose The fact that Joey and Ross can't just nap together without questioning their sexuality, and then being shamed by all of their friends when they found out Joey telling his student actor who was trying out for the same part to play the part as a gay man so that he wouldn't get it and Joey could get the part instead. ""They liked the stupid gay thing and cast him!""   The rest are humor. You aren't supposed to take them seriously, you're actually supposed to laugh at them being ridiculous. It is the pushing of a stereotype over the top, so that it's impossible to take seriously. For example:   Ross' huge problem with the male nanny because he was sensitive and made Ross uncomfortable- only to be okay with hiring a lesbian   or   The fact that Joey and Ross can't just nap together without questioning their sexuality, and then being shamed by all of their friends when they found out   The humor isn't that they're gay, it's that they're so uncomfortable about something that shouldn't be awkward. Also, when exactly were they shamed?  As for this:   Chandler listening to the hypnosis tape to quit smoking and he suddenly takes on these feminine qualities and it being a joke   This is a real thing. Check out /r/sissyhypno   Finally, how is this one:   -Rachel being labeled as ""the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island""   homophobic? If she really did have a 'teeny weenie' as rumored, would she not be a hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island? And the reason it was a big deal was not because of 'homophobia' , it's because hermaphroditism is an exceedingly rare condition. Anything which is uncommon is bound to attract attention. It doesn't mean the attention is necessarily negative.  TL;DR - I feel you're taking things which were meant to be jokes, noticing the things that were supposed to be funny, and assuming that those things were meant as serious points where they were actually meant to extract humor."
howyoudoin,3byhmw,mathdhruv,3,Fri Jul 3 09:59:43 2015 UTC,"Isn't she said to have undergone gender reassignment?   I'm not sure. (S)He was said to be a drag queen with a gay burlesque bar in Vegas, which would imply there hadn't been a reassignment. In such a scenario I think it's fair to call him 'the man in the black dress'   Rachel didn't actually have a teenie-weenie, I don't think   I didn't say she did. I said that if she'd had one, as the rumor said, it wouldn't be wrong to refer to her as that if you didn't know her. Since ""the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island"" was how Chandler(who went to a different high school) knew her, I'd say it would be like someone referring to ""the one-legged cheerleader from Long Island"" , if the person in question had had a wooden leg, instead of extra genitals. That doesn't make Chandler anti-one legged people, just misinformed.   there's really no need to start unneccesary rumors about their sexuality.   Can't disagree there, although I wouldn't class it as homophobia. More like sexual bullying (if that is a thing), but aimed at a person, rather than against a community.  I too love the show, as well as the sub. I see opportunities in everyday life to drop Friends references, and most people don't pick up on them, so this sub really makes me feel a lot better. Thanks for providing such a lot of examples, I must admit I would classify a few of them as borderline too."

howyoudoin,3byhmw,mathdhruv,3,Fri Jul 3 11:42:35 2015 UTC,"Well, that was a product of the society they lived in. In the 90s, people were not as open-minded as today.

howyoudoin,3bql27,caret-top,5,Wed Jul 1 10:57:41 2015 UTC,That's right. He accidentally dropped a condom in her guitar case.  I'm not sure if it was the same character but just that they used the same actor (he did well in that small part so they got him back to play Frank) but it could have been him because they hadn't officially met so they wouldn't know each other and it was such a short interaction that they wouldn't necessarily recognise each other when they met at his house.
howyoudoin,3bql27,Schnutzel,2,Wed Jul 1 12:32:07 2015 UTC,"When Phoebe and Frank spend a day together, Frank mentions that he's never been to the city before (I'm guessing he means Manhattan), so this negates the possibility that they are the same character.

Ross is wrong as, even though they weren't 'in a relationship', if he truly loved Rachel and believed that they would come back together, he shouldn't have gone past the line.  Rachel is wrong as she requested the break, and should accept and implications that come with it."
howyoudoin,3bswhi,DefinitelyNotBarney,2,Wed Jul 1 22:49:51 2015 UTC,Actually I was evaluating the concept because I put it in there without really thinking about it but I was getting to the same conclusions!
howyoudoin,3bswhi,spectralconfetti,2,Wed Jul 1 23:01:47 2015 UTC,"I never see anyone else raise the point that he shouldn't have done what he did if he actually loved her and cared about maintaining a relationship. But they weren't even on a break because Rachel only said ""maybe we should"" and never said that she wanted to or that they were. Ross simply left without a word as soon as she said that and it wasn't discussed at all. So there was no break, Ross just assumed they were on one when he found out Mark was at the apartment with her. The thing is, taking a break shouldn't mean sleeping around. It just means not trying to maintain the relationship for a period of time so that they can focus on other aspects of their lives. So I don't think that would inherently be an implication for Rachel to accept. Especially since Ross' actions were based off of a misunderstanding."

Before the show, but probably in the same period that Joey moved in, he had a 3 year relationship with Angela Delvechio. Also Phoebe and Ross were married at that time.  After that they were involved in other relationships. Rachel was of the table as Ross was in love and later dated her, Monica was in love for some extend period of time with Richard which realistically leaves Joey/Chandler with Phoebe for a potential relation."

Also, like I think is the case with Chandler and Rachel or Ross and Phoebe, sometimes you just truly have a strong connection with someone but it's not rooted in sexual attraction. Yes, they find the other attractive (as indicative in 'The One that Could Have Been' episode) but not enough to ever be a 'maybe' factor. Platonic relationships do exist."

howyoudoin,3b21we,Kipepeogirl,3,Fri Jul 3 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"I think it refers to Ross finding out Carol is pregnant in The One with the Sonogram at the End. This is the second ever episode of Friends so must have taken place not long after the Pilot. The Pilot was Rachel's wedding day, which takes place exactly a year after the events in The One with the Flashback. In TOW the Flashback Ross finds out Carol is gay, so they must have split up exactly a year before the Pilot. As pregnancy takes nine months, they must have slept together at least once after they split up - that time being the 'once afterwards' Ross mentions - when they conceived Ben.  I hope that makes sense."

I always thought they were laughing because he was so awkward and didn't know what else to say about her? Obviously I knew she was a lesbian, so I also kind of thought that it was something to do with golf isn't really a sport girls play?? or something?? Haha it wasn't until I watched it later that I kind of realized what the joke was, but then wouldn't that mean she was bisexual if she ""plays for both teams""? I think they always said she was a lesbian. Although she did marry Ross, but is that because she wasn't ready to come out yet? Or because she actually is bisexual? now I'm just rambling, hah sorry.

howyoudoin,3atu73,peanutismint,2,Tue Jun 23 13:37:21 2015 UTC,I don't think he's tall enough to be a Mark. Was there by any chance a Barney or a Gene?
howyoudoin,3auak2,streetmeattv,2,Tue Jun 23 15:50:08 2015 UTC,I say this all of the time.
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Feramah,29,Mon Jun 22 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"To me, the worst thing in the show is how they mistreated Joey's character and turned him into an idiot, where in the first season he was a reasonably smart guy, even if he wasn't too knowledgeable."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,DaneelR,23,Mon Jun 22 20:09:29 2015 UTC,Flanderization.
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,SoMuchMoreEagle,9,Mon Jun 22 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"Joey: Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments done on me all the time! Chandler: Ah finally an explanation"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,nachobluth,3,Mon Jun 22 22:57:36 2015 UTC,Joey is basically an annoying cartoon character by the end. I also disliked Monica after about halfway through the series.
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,mandie72,40,Tue Jun 23 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that I ""hate"" them being together, but I can totally understand your view. I just don't think they're organic together, they don't work as a couple for me, it was a nice break from the R&R drama and it was nice to see Joey growing up and having actual feelings for someone, but idk."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,PAPER_SNOW_A_GHOST_,24,Mon Jun 22 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"I always found it strange how Joey was maturing towards the end of the series, but that seemed to also vastly lower his intelligence. Like when he was ""learning"" French."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,iamanomoly,25,Mon Jun 22 21:49:21 2015 UTC,"How they dumbed down Joey and made Monica even MORE high maintenance really angered me! I lovedddd the early seasons Monica! She was perfect! Already high maintenance enough, but not annoyingly and it was more believable! Same with Joey, him being dumb in the early seasons was the perfect amount! Not annoying, believable, and cute!"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,lilweber,23,Mon Jun 22 22:52:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he also had a degree of intelligence, like he could have an actual conversation with the other Friends and contribute in a normal way. By the later seasons it was a wonder he hadn't drowned in the bath."

howyoudoin,3aq7qu,feralcatromance,2,Tue Jun 23 03:33:34 2015 UTC,She was so shrill and annoying by the end. The level of control freakishness was not believable at all.
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,mandie72,11,Tue Jun 23 14:30:46 2015 UTC,"His newfound maturity doesn't go anywhere, though.  He doesn't date anyone seriously after Rachel on the show.  Maybe he does on ""Joey,""  but I don't know because I only saw one episode."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,SoMuchMoreEagle,6,Mon Jun 22 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"I could never get into 'Joey', but I did catch the occasional episode every now and then. I think I remember seeing him end up with his next door neighbour."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,AndysDoughnuts,2,Mon Jun 22 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, Alex Garrett. He has a lot of maturity on that show-- if fact he was the most emotionally stable one. He seems even smarter than his rocket scientist nephew at times.  Sadly I watched that show too many times because of comfort."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,greatWallofUSA,4,Tue Jun 23 12:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yup. No chemistry, which, I guess is why they broke up. Problem is he didn't actually grow up after that. He went back into his ""Joey dating"" record. Just like he did after he slept with the girl who spoke a bunch of languages and drank his beers that Rachel and Phoebe loved. He said he wanted a serious relationship (maybe just implied) but then didn't. And I say this even though Joey is my favorite character."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,DJ-Anakin,7,Tue Jun 23 00:40:52 2015 UTC,Same thing on HIMYM with Barney. It was really great to see him more mature when it came to Nora and we were really excited about it but when it came to Robin it felt very weird. They just couldn't make the chemistry work. If they had been together since the beginning it would make a lot of sense and would work but later it was just a mess.
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,rarely-sarcastic,14,Tue Jun 23 00:53:27 2015 UTC,"YES! It seems forced and clumsy, and the storyline doesn't work for me at all. I don't think they captured the genuine pain this would cause Ross - every time two Friends have gotten together it has led to a deep emotional connection (he still has feelings for her throughout the series between their ""break"" up and the finale, obviously), so realistically he'd be looking at the likelihood of Rachel and Joey being together for a long time. It would tear him up, even more so than the devouring of his moist-maker.   This was a mis-step by the writers, IMO. I tend to skip these episodes when they come on in syndication too."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Strabbo,10,Mon Jun 22 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, especially since she and Ross have a baby together.  Would he want Joey being Emma's step dad?"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,SoMuchMoreEagle,12,Mon Jun 22 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"No he wouldn't and that's why he loses his mind when he finds out and holds a fajita night. He tries to play it cool, because Joey is his Friend and he doesn't want to ruin that, but it's clear he hates it.  He then realises he hasn't been together with Rachel for 6 years and that he doesn't own her, so he has to swallow his feelings and let his friends live their lives.  Obviously, Joey and Rachel can't get passed it and they break up.   Really what pissed me off most about the Ross and Joey stuff is the way Ross treats the whole situation, when he hooked up with Charlie minutes after she broke up with Joey. (Yes they hadn't been together as long, or had the same depth to their relationship as Ross and Rachel, but still Ross and Rachel hadn't been together for 6 years.)"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,AndysDoughnuts,5,Mon Jun 22 23:21:54 2015 UTC,I thought Rachel and Joey broke up because she kept slapping him when he made a move.
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Mon Jun 22 23:34:38 2015 UTC,"Right, but there are different ways you can interpret her 'subconscious' reasoning for doing that. I see it that she wasn't comfortable being intimate with Joey after seeing what the thought of it did to Ross. (The real reason is just that the writers didn't want them to sleep together because they always wanted R&R to happen.)"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,AndysDoughnuts,14,Mon Jun 22 23:42:22 2015 UTC,The only thing I like about them together is it gave us TOW Ross is Fine.  My Fajitas!
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,RVelts,3,Tue Jun 23 01:55:59 2015 UTC,yes! One of my fave Ross moments!
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,ginger21m,3,Tue Jun 23 02:40:56 2015 UTC,Good point! Hands down my favorite episode (as evidenced by my username)
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,FlanForThree,2,Tue Jun 23 10:46:07 2015 UTC,E!
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,omphalososos,11,Tue Jun 23 19:47:17 2015 UTC,It's definitely my least favorite portion of the series
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,puffmstuffsb,10,Mon Jun 22 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, this is exactly what the writers were trying to achieve actually. Sometimes friends fall in love and it just doesn't work."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,dev0xtr,22,Mon Jun 22 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"I was actually totally rooting for Rachel and Joey to be together. To me, they feel much more natural together than Rachel with Ross. I think Ross and Rachel together is a recipe for constant drama. Rachel is high maintenance, Ross is too needy, and they've been through so much crap that they don't trust each other. When Rachel and Joey were roommates, it was clear to me that they were good influences on each other. He got her to loosen up a bit and have more fun, and she helped him mature a bit. Joey is way more likely to call Rachel on her bullshit than Ross is, and I can't see the two of them getting into escalated wars of passive-aggression like Ross and Rachel constantly do. Maybe they wouldn't last, but I wanted to see them have a fighting chance. Instead it all ended because they felt a little awkward with the physical stuff? Like there's no way they could have just recognized the awkwardness and taken things in stages as they became more comfortable with each other?  Then again, I'm single, so what do I know about successful relationships. ;)"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,salradicchio,7,Mon Jun 22 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"It's really relieving to read this comment. On this sub, it feels like I'm the only one that likes Joey and Rachel together at times. I don't get the fascination with Ross and Rachel really. They don't seem to get on well. It seems to me they're ""in love"" just because. (aka the show says so) and there's so much dumb bullshit between the two of them.   On the other hand, Joey and Rachel seem to actually get along. I think if they could have gotten past their difficulties of being intimate together, they would have worked out great. But of course, everyone wants Ross and Rachel together because... I don't know. I guess because of all their 'history"", which was basically a relatively toxic relationship with each other.   That's just my opinion on the matter, so eh."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,OhSix,6,Tue Jun 23 07:53:42 2015 UTC,You really fell more comfortable with Joey and Rachel than with Ross and Rachel? Wow that sounds very rare to me haha
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,nachobluth,5,Mon Jun 22 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"Let me ask: in what way does Ross and Rachel work?  Other than Ross totally fawning over her for most of his life, they really don't have anything going for them. They have nothing in common, and both think the other's interests are completely boring. What does Ross see in Rachel besides thinking she's pretty? What does Rachel see in Ross at all?"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Zephs,3,Tue Jun 23 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"They're ""in love"". I know it sounds corny but just because you're different than someone doesn't mean you can't be in love. When you have a connection with someone it doesn't matter how different you are. I get what you're saying though."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,pugdogs10,8,Tue Jun 23 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"When you have a connection with someone it doesn't matter how different you are.   Yeah, that's not how relationships work. That spark doesn't last forever. The show made it pretty abundantly clear that once the initial spark died, there was nothing left to go on, because the entire relationship was built on Ross's obsession with her. You need actual things you like about the person."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Zephs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:02:49 2015 UTC,I don't see how you can judge how long a spark between two people can last but whatever man. They made it abundantly clear throughout the entire show that Ross and Rachel had a connection and neither was ever really over the other.
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,pugdogs10,8,Tue Jun 23 04:59:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know what weird fantasy world you live in, but a relationship is more than ""seeing her/him gives me funny feelings"". If that's literally the only thing keeping you together, it's doomed to fail. Rachel and Ross disagree about nearly everything in their lives.   The whole Ross/Rachel thing feels forced precisely because they have nothing in common. The writers say they like each other, but nothing in the show really explains why they would. I don't buy that Ross would be happy in a relationship with someone that's so anti-learning like Rachel, and I don't buy that Rachel would be happy in a relationship with someone as frugal as Ross. They would fight constantly, but that part wouldn't make for good TV."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Zephs,0,Tue Jun 23 05:51:19 2015 UTC,"They don’t need to be the same to like each other, that would imply everyone seeks the same qualities. I mean Chandler and Monica are as different as they can, does that mean they are also doomed to fail? Because the show disagrees."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Honza8D,5,Wed Jun 24 13:01:54 2015 UTC,"As Chandler says to Monica ""Yeah, you're high maintenance, but I like maintaining you"", or something along those lines. They're shown to share some likes, have some issues with each other, but are able to work through those issues.  All Ross and Rachel do is complain about the other's taste in things. There would be nothing to their relationship except sex. The Rachel and Ross that are shown in the show do not make a very compatible couple. The only thing people keep repeating is ""they like each other"". Congrats. This is still the real world, and it takes more than that for a long-term relationship to work out, and considering they lack anything beyond the most shallow connection, it breaks my suspension of disbelief. They don't need to be the same, but they need to have at least some common ground. The issue I have is I can't picture Ross and Rachel in a ""normal"" setting. On TV they always get up to wacky weekly antics, but I can't picture a Ross and Rachel that are just home alone one day, because neither character would enjoy the other's company."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Zephs,0,Wed Jun 24 13:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, thats why they are friends, because they don’t enjoy each others company. They seemed to enjoy each others company when doing laundry. They seem to enjoy each others company when rachel lives with ross (when pregnant).   But if you want to apply real life to this show, answer me this: Why would Rachel even be friends with Joey, his intelligence is bordering mental retardation. Do you really believe such womanizer like joey would suddnely change his entire personality for some girl? Thats not how real life works. Why did Rachel even live with Joey? She had decent job and child. Joey was really iresponsible and childish. Do you really thing it was the best place for raising child?"
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Honza8D,2,Wed Jun 24 14:16:37 2015 UTC,"Rachel was almost as irresponsible as Joey. I thought they fit together really well. Rachel wasn't exactly smart, either. She's shown to be very stupid at some points in the series, too. Both of them actively reject learning anything when Ross tries to tell them something new. Heck, there was a whole story line about Rachel getting to live with Monica again, but decides she actually prefers living with Joey, and it shows why.   When Ross and Rachel were doing laundry, he was being a total Nice GuyTM. It's pretty cringey to watch. Like I said, their relationship is built on Ross putting Rachel on a pedestal based solely on thinking she's good-looking.   There's a saying in these things, ""show, don't tell"". F.R.I.E.N.D.S. did a very poor job of showing why Ross and Rachel would be good together, and instead just had the actors tell us they would be. All evidence in the show says it won't work out. That's not to say they won't keep being on-again-off-again because they like each other, but that it will be unhealthy with a lot of breakups and fights because they're just not compatible long-term."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Zephs,0,Wed Jun 24 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"Rachel was almost as irresponsible as Joey. I thought they fit together really well. Rachel wasn't exactly smart, either. She's shown to be very stupid at some points in the series, too. Both of them actively reject learning anything when Ross tries to tell them something new.    Whoa, Rachel was way smarter than Joey. This is best illustrated in episode where joey buys encyclopedia. We see that all his firedns (including Rachel) often talk about staff he simply doesn’t understand so he just pretends and nods. That relationship would soon be boring if Rachel was talkign and Joey would jast nod and laught.   Heck, there was a whole story line about Rachel getting to live with Monica again, but decides she actually prefers living with Joey, and it shows why.    yea, because he lets her throw food on the floor.   When Ross and Rachel were doing laundry, he was being a total Nice GuyTM. It's pretty cringey to watch. Like I said, their relationship is built on Ross putting Rachel on a pedestal based solely on thinking she's good-looking.    Wait so bein nice to people is bad now?

But by that logic Chandler and monica are doomed to break up too. And most importantly so are Rachel and Joey. They are just so different. Sorry but just because they are both irresponsible doesn’t mean they are good fit. It is a recipe for disaster, especially since small baby would live with them. Other then that they don’t really have much in common. Joey is very stupid, which a already wrote about in this post. Rachel is rather drama queen, while Joey doesn’t really care much. Joey is also very immature. I think Joey is very much like Tag, and we all know how that ended up."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,Honza8D,0,Thu Jun 25 05:54:58 2015 UTC,"When I first saw the arc of Joey and Rachel, I didnt hate it. I was intrigued. I was like really? Them? But then last year I finally got to watch all the episodes within a couple of weeks for the first time (in order) and I found myself rooting for them too!!!! Idk what it was. I really liked watching Joey mature. And its also probably cuz I dislike Ross so much. He's so sexist and such a jerk and even tho Rachel can be selfish, I take selfish over sexist lol Joey seemed to be more in love than Ross ever showed and it looked so genuine too. It was so cute. I was pretty upset how abrupt their arc ended and it was cheap. It could have been great, but oh well."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,damonsloverr,2,Tue Jun 23 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. As bizarre as it might sound, Joey respects women more than Ross does. Joey would be perfectly happy for Rachel to keep her work life separate from her personal life, unlike Ross who feels the need to be involved in everything Rachel does."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,AndysDoughnuts,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't like it originally but as I've rewatched the show and gotten older, I find the two of them far more compatible than Ross and Rachel. Ross and his jealousy of Mark really bugs me, plus the bullshit of lying to Rachel about the annulment makes me really dislike their relationship. Meanwhile Rachel and Joey genuinely cared and supported each other. It is a pity the writers had them break them up so soon after they finally got together and in a really stupid way."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,LoveBy137,4,Tue Jun 23 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"You know,  I'm watching the episode where they get together right now,  second time through. First time I watched it I was like,  no but Ross and Rachel. But this time,  it really makes sense. They actually are pretty compatible characters. Kinda shallow,  really pretty,  easy going."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,shaynami,5,Tue Jun 23 05:20:27 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. In interviews, the writers/producers were stating how that whole Joey and Rachel situation allowed the show to move through uncharted territory, which created some discomfort for the actors and the audience, and was ultimately good for the show and its direction. But I can really only chalk it up to the fact that they were running out of ideas for the show and needed some new material, then the writers/producers tried to play it off like it was the desired direction all along."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,RUoffended,4,Mon Jun 22 23:01:32 2015 UTC,"This romance was necessary to resolve Joey as a character. You'll recall that he's the most visibly upset of the friends at the prospect of the group disbanding at the series' conclusion. Rachel was the first time in Joey's life that he had to try and attract a woman WITHOUT relying purely on his sexuality. We get to see him be loving and sweet, and a strong father figure toward Emma. This gives the audience hope that in the end ""Joey is going to be okay"" and find love of his own, rather than just sleeping his way through lower Manhattan out of desperation for companionship."
howyoudoin,3aq7qu,WintersbaneGDX,2,Tue Jun 23 11:43:30 2015 UTC,It was interesting to see Rachel pursue a different friend in the group but it added nothing to the overall story
howyoudoin,3aoyso,grahamblack,29,Mon Jun 22 09:07:00 2015 UTC,"I think the better question is wouldn't Ross OBVIOUSLY be at the head table with the rest of the wedding party? Also once he switched with that kid that means there's some random child sitting at the head table, which I think is hilarious."
howyoudoin,3aoyso,SDstrawburry,2,Mon Jun 22 19:37:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I just watched this yesterday and was having the same thoughts! He could have easily switched back, but also, why wouldn't he want to sit with Ben? He loves his son. And who was watching Ben, like who did he come with, they never showed Carol or Susan."

howyoudoin,3aoyso,SpookyLlama,18,Fri Jun 26 12:52:17 2015 UTC,"He doesn't realise till he sits down. If he was in charge of looking after Been that day (rather than Carol being there), I guess he just wasn't paying attention.  Not all weddings have a table just for kids, sometimes they sit with their parents so maybe he didn't know there was going to be a kids' table."
howyoudoin,3aoyso,caret-top,16,Mon Jun 22 11:32:25 2015 UTC,"We all know Ross isn't the most attentive dad but I'm pretty sure at some point during the planning of his sister and best friends wedding he would have heard there was a kids table, and if Ben wasn't placed with Ross then he's obviously at a kids table."

howyoudoin,3anzvh,quakesurvivor,3,Mon Jun 22 11:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty sure there have been multiple occasions where they kiss each other goodbye."
howyoudoin,3akixp,SoMuchMoreEagle,30,Sun Jun 21 02:31:21 2015 UTC,They did an entire episode on Joey and Phoebe (and Rachael at the time) not being able to afford the same stuff the other three can.
howyoudoin,3akixp,Buttstache,3,Sun Jun 21 19:40:13 2015 UTC,that was a good one! and it involved the blowfish
howyoudoin,3akixp,03290329,21,Mon Jun 22 14:56:20 2015 UTC,Number 2 is a big one for me. Who are all those weirdos extras at the partys? There was even that one episode where Joey could not go to Pheobes party but the girls were able to get Pheobes other friend to attend and they even tried to make her a big deal.
howyoudoin,3akixp,hipery2,31,Sun Jun 21 11:49:52 2015 UTC,I always just imagined them as coworkers...like maybe they just sent out an email to the whole office saying they were having a party.
howyoudoin,3akixp,lilmoozle,16,Sun Jun 21 12:44:24 2015 UTC,I can live with that. There was also that one episode with Ross's bachelor party where he invites all his paleontology buddys.

Ross gets super annoying and at the same time I understand why he is stressed out because it looks like no one cares to get ready on time. On top of all the pressure he was under because of his speech I'm sure he didn't need this from the others.   But still my biggest issue was that he was so annoying. And then Chandler with his stupid ""my place"" thing and Monica freaking out about Richard just added to my annoyance. The others were pretty much themselves and Joey was the funniest which sort of saved the episode."
howyoudoin,39ympe,kozmikushos,3,Tue Jun 16 12:18:42 2015 UTC,I was fully on Ross's side the entire episode. Everyone was really irresponsible and immature and they weren't being considerate of the pressure he was under. Plus they made it seem like Rachel was the victim even though she was wasting a bunch of time for no reason.  I don't mind the episode but it definitely isn't one of my favorites.
howyoudoin,39ympe,kdoodlethug,2,Tue Jun 16 19:54:26 2015 UTC,"While I generally have a different view of the episode than your's since I enjoy it, what I do feel is that there are some character traits and stories in this episode that are hammed up, kind of trying to be in your face with their humor - and those traits and stories match up with the parts you point out.  Chandler was uncharacteristically petty about the chair thing (he's usually a chill guy about that kind of stuff), Monica was way-too crazy on such short notice about Richard (she would be the type to understand that getting ready on time is important, and given that she's on such an emotional rollercoaster, it seems really risky to call back an ex whom she isn't sure actually called her or not), and while I generally liked Ross in the episode, he suddenly blows up right when Rachel was just about done getting dressed.  Yes, it was supposed to be the straw on the camel's back, but still, I don't know, something about it felt hammy.  Ross and Rachel were still good though, since they start out sweet and loving, then have a fight, then make up, which is a lot to stuff into one episode like that with all this other stuff going on at the same time."

But of all of them, Phoebe is by far the nastiest.  The first time I watched the show what resonated with me was that she showed the same passive aggressive spiteful streak that I had noted in a number of  'super positive' 'new-age' people I knew back at that time.    This time I am more struck by her as being almost Aspergers in her responses to others, with a complete inability to self-censor what she says.  I recently re-watched the episode in season 9 where she meets her boyfriend Mike's wealthy parents.  It was one of those rare times I actually felt sympathy for the character; her life background had left her with no idea of how to act in a situation like this."

howyoudoin,39s0ao,idwthis,8,Sun Jun 14 12:28:26 2015 UTC,I was watching the True Hollywood Story (I think) about Friends awhile ago and they said that the writers were really concerned that everyone would really hate Rachel.  That never even crossed my mind but she should be a pretty unlikable character.  A lot of the characters aren't really likable on their own.  If one of them was on another show they would be the annoying character but they all work together.
howyoudoin,39s0ao,ninjette847,23,Sun Jun 14 13:23:44 2015 UTC,"I think people rarely consider her upbringing and the effects it could have on her personality.  She's actually a well-developed character if you ask me.  And if you hate her, that just speaks1.  to the quality of writing.  Her mother killed herself and she grew up on the street as a teen.  That kind of situation typically doesn't breed kindness and empathy.  She's a bitch because its much more realistic than having her play a happy-go-lucky blonde.  If you really think about it, they all have serious personal issues that are heavily downplayed by humor and lightheartedness."
howyoudoin,39s0ao,rastapasta808,4,Sun Jun 14 12:18:04 2015 UTC,"I agree; Phoebe's nastiness seems jarring because it comes alongside a spoonful of sugar.  But if you look at it that the sugar is there sometimes but the hardened person is the true personality, formed by her hard life, and it snaps through occasionally, you kind of can sympathise with her more. I honestly feel Phoebe often feels she has to have the smiley persona to cover her genuine ditziness sometimes and to avoid getting really mad at her friends who, to be honest, are pretty bad about flaunting their wealthy, well-adjusted backgrounds to their friend who literally came from nothing and still works a much lower-paying job than they do.  There's an early episode where Phoebe, Joey and Rachel complain about the others flaunting their wealth - but the solution to that is suggested to be reached when Joey and Rachel become higher-paid; not that Monica, Ross and Chandler become more aware of their friends' relative poverty."

howyoudoin,39s0ao,NorwegianWood28,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"Well, she essentially sabotaged virtually every one of Ross' serious relationship. Had it not been for Rachel Green, or had she entered their lives an year or two later, Ross Geller would have enjoyed so much more comfortable, established, and mentally stable ten years following.  She treats her (perhaps only) close friend Monica poorly, and doesn't even invite the supposed best friend to her wedding! Only to rely on the same friend when she got out of wedding.(That she had no other close person to confide in is quite telling about the company she had kept meanwhile).  She generally demands and expects that things be done in her way, and gets away with it until the very end. Add 'manipulative' to the list, too. Personally I don't think she deserves Ross Geller. It was sweet that Ross finally got his childhood- and lifetime- crush, and ended marrying her, but I feel sorry for all the hard time he had to endure.   It also sounded like she was a horrible person in high school and college."
howyoudoin,39s0ao,niuzeta,2,Wed Jun 17 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"She treats her (perhaps only) close friend Monica poorly, and doesn't even invite the supposed best friend to her wedding!

howyoudoin,39s0ao,twinsocks,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:13:47 2015 UTC,"They were friends since childhood until the end of high school(I don't know if they went to the same college) and in my book that's close enough relationship to warrant an invite. The one where Rachel turns thirty was season 7, so at the pilot she was 23, so roughly after college graduation.  Also wasn't there an episode when Central Perk used to be a bar? The two showed a rather distant regard to each other, if I remember correctly. So... why did Rachel decide to rely on a friend she pretty much abandoned, and even have a temerity to decide to stay in her place?"
howyoudoin,39s0ao,IncensedDolphin,20,Thu Jun 18 01:51:34 2015 UTC,"It's not just Chandler, she's that nasty to all of them. I can count about 5 nice things she's said over the course of the entire show.   But also, this is the nineties, a lot of sitcoms relied on ""Oh he's just a stupid man"" [CUE LAUGHTRACK] because that was genuinely a comedic subversion of gender roles that had only just become encouraged on tv."

howyoudoin,39s0ao,WW4O,7,Sun Jun 14 09:44:58 2015 UTC,"why do people like Phoebe?   I just binge watched the whole series for the first time and like her characters. Even if she as flaws, like all the others, she also as redeeming qualities and is loyal to the group.  One of those qualities is that she doesn't let protocols and psychological societal constructs get in the way of what she want's to do. In that aspect, Ross is the complete opposite, he usually creates his own psychological barriers and end up being miserable. This image from the finale perfectly illustrates the difference between the two characters and how they approach life. Both are going to the same place while Ross respect the rules and waste time going all around the empty queue even if there is no one waiting, while Phoebe cuts trough all the bullshit and goes directly where she needs to go.  http://i.imgur.com/LS6yHRn.gif  In the end she saves the day by using her strong will to push Ross towards Rachel, out of his usual inertia. She convince him to stop being the usual indecisive Ross and to go talk to Rachel when he his upset about not receiving a proper goodbye. She is the one who argue for him to not let her go, she literally drive him to the airport like a mad women in her taxi, she doesn't let him give up when they are at the wrong airport, she calls Rachel to tell about the ""left phalange"" problem and stop the plane, and finally she is the one that screams like an insane lady in the middle of the airport to call back Rachel to the gate.  Thanks to her non conventional behavior and her total disregard for the rules she is able to help her Friend Ross, who really needed that final push toward the finish line."

howyoudoin,39s0ao,shreesh13,2,Sun Jun 14 14:54:46 2015 UTC,I feel like she likes to pick on them because of the dicodomy of their world views. None of the others have had any real adversary in their lives. So when they are whining she doesn't have much sympathy.
howyoudoin,39s0ao,ed_stone,4,Sun Jun 14 13:25:28 2015 UTC,"Phoebe is sort of a wild card and can react unpredictably. Having said that; the reason I think why she doesn't like Chandler is that, she can't understand what Monica sees in him. He is not best looking guy in the group and sure, he is successful at what he does, but he doesn't seem to be doing anything interesting with his life like Joey or Monica."
howyoudoin,39s0ao,faithhoven,-8,Sun Jun 14 14:28:20 2015 UTC,Phoebe is a cunt.  Ignore her.
howyoudoin,39s0ao,kozmikushos,19,Sun Jun 14 06:26:07 2015 UTC,"Even though you're getting downvoted - I totally agree with you. Phoebe IS a grinch. She's constantly offensive, manipulative and just rags on everyone when she can. She pays out Chandler constantly (which, in my opinion, is the only truly likeable character by the end of the show), she makes fun of Ross and divides the group between her and Joey against everyone else now and then. It's as if she understands friendship as a given, rather than something that you have to earn and maintain. fuck she sends me up the wall"
howyoudoin,39s0ao,faithhoven,29,Sun Jun 14 08:13:06 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking the other day that Chandler is my true favourite. I think he is the most likable person because even with his constant joking and everything, he is the most in sync with himself. And he can make a joke out of his flaws too which makes him super cool."
howyoudoin,39s0ao,ethicalpickle,16,Sun Jun 14 10:49:37 2015 UTC,"For sure - he's the most emotionally secure and together person in the whole group. Even though he screws up, he genuinely cares about his friends and their well-being. He's the most realistic character too (If you'd told me that at S1 I'd have never believed it) - all of the other friends got flanderized to the point where only their distinctive characteristics remain, but Chandler's flaws perfectly correlate with his strengths.  Although I do think Ross is cool when he starts joking about his divorces - that was one of the most natural moments of the later seasons I thought."
howyoudoin,39s0ao,dooatito,9,Sun Jun 14 11:01:03 2015 UTC,"I find her sense of entitlement especially odd given she's sort of the outsider of the group. If I remember right, her lack of shared history with the others has been a plot point, and she doesn't have the extremely strong bond  ofChandler with Ross and Joey, or Monica with Rachel. Her contempt for Chandler and Ross in the last few seasons really is off putting. It's also jarring on the occasions when she participates in important events for them, like helping Chandler buy a ring for Monica or helping Ross chase down Rachel in the finale, since she's so awful to them most of the time."
howyoudoin,39s0ao,faithhoven,4,Sun Jun 14 13:39:43 2015 UTC,"You have to remember she's had an extremely tough childhood, during which she had to build a sort of defense mechanism. I don't think she's trying to be mean, it's just that she doesn't realize that her words hurt other people."
howyoudoin,39s0ao,caret-top,12,Sun Jun 14 10:49:03 2015 UTC,"But she isn't like this in the first couple seasons - so what I'm suggesting is that she's developed a sense of place within the group that she believes permits her to say whatever she wants to whoever she wants without consequence. She's really lovely - kind, but wacky - in the first seasons, but as the seasons progresses she just becomes rude and oblivious."

That is all on the actor/actress.

This is not for every episode, but there are some subtle differences in some episodes and some run extra long (more than 22 minutes. )  The versions on Netflix are HD versions of what was the original broadcast. They are broadcast length, but also 16x9 aspect ratio and high resolution, so it's a trade off for me. Personally,  I'm not missing the extra footage that much."
howyoudoin,39hgt3,soomprimal,5,Fri Jun 12 05:09:28 2015 UTC,"Netflix never gets the DVD extras though. so we're getting what aired on broadcast television like all of the other shows. Except for the ""collections"". I can't stand those."

That being said I think sometimes people who have too much in common are not always the best match. I think everyone on the show had a tendency to be pretty selfish at times - I have been re watching too so there is a lot I never really noticed before."
howyoudoin,39imje,mandie72,2,Fri Jun 12 12:59:07 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this too, or maybe it's 'cause I'm older now, but Ross, Rachel and Monica seem unbearably selfish at times."
howyoudoin,39imje,mandie72,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:39:29 2015 UTC,Yeah they were the big three for me as well. To be fair I hate how Monica's character was written after the first few seasons and Rachel just generally gets on my nerves so I may be harder on those two.
howyoudoin,39imje,ZabuzaBZ,9,Fri Jun 12 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"I watch this show nightly.... my fiance is in love with this show, and before I met her, i have never seen it. over the past 8 years I have been with her, I think I watched this show about 20~22 times.... It's our bedtime TV show.  I have always wanted for Joey and Rachel to end up together!! I hate Ross and I think he doesn't deserve Rachel, and I completely agree on your arguments! I also think I just have a hate for Ross and I don't want him to be happy, but that's another thread. :D"
howyoudoin,39imje,Monkeymack,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:51:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was pretty indifferent toward Ross, but with this last re watch he's becoming a mildly annoying character. Kudos on the gf for getting you into the show!"
howyoudoin,39imje,Honza8D,4,Fri Jun 12 02:27:21 2015 UTC,"I totally disagree but I see where you're coming from. For one, the writers have made it apparent that they aren't fit for each other numerous times.   For example when asked who he'd rather sleep with, Joey chose Monica over Rachel  And secondly, when Rachel got Joey as a backup, she switched with Pheobe to get Ross, because she can sooner see herself with Ross than Joey in the future. I'm definitely Team Ross and Rachel"
howyoudoin,39imje,kozmikushos,3,Sat Jun 13 07:09:39 2015 UTC,"I’ll have to disagree, Joey should have ended with Phoebe, they had chemistry. Joey/Rachel thing felt too forced honestly."
howyoudoin,39imje,Swtcherrypie,2,Sat Jun 13 08:58:13 2015 UTC,"I think they would have ended up drifting apart because while Joey was still very immature when the show ended, Rachel already had a baby and a serious job and whatnot. They were great flat mates for sure but I think there was no moving forward for them.  Ross was more reliable and they had much more opportunities to grow together. As in, intellectually they were on a similar level even though Rachel was sometimes depicted as shallow. And their background was similar, too. So in the long run, I think, Ross is definitely the winner. (Of course they would have to work on their relationship a lot, e.g. due to the insecurities of Ross but that might come with age.)"

howyoudoin,39huvb,hanselpremium,2,Thu Jun 11 23:09:40 2015 UTC,I feel like most shows do that.  They take the audience's favorite character traits and just exaggerate them like crazy.
howyoudoin,39huvb,Kikool42,2,Fri Jun 12 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"On Friends, Joey was a womanizer, but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard.   Kevin S.

It's my favorite ever role of Matthew Perry, and he's a lot like Chandler. Well Chandler if Monica had died.

There were a few times where the two had cute moments, but if I hadn't known they'd end out together in advance, I probably wouldn't have noticed anything."
howyoudoin,392nqk,dupreem,2,Tue Jun 9 17:46:06 2015 UTC,"When I first watched the show, I already knew they were gonna end up together.   Did anyone who watched the show while it was airing new episodes expect them to end up together?"

howyoudoin,38wu4a,indigodelirium,5,Sun Jun 7 20:49:55 2015 UTC,"I was watching an episode with the directors commentary on, and they actually talked about that. Apparently they rationalized it that this building was actually across the street from Monicas apartment, and this was just the view from their side of the street. So, technically, you could say it's ross' building"

So I thought I'd watch the Oprah interview she did with the cast that aired the day after the series finale. I thought it would give me more insight to the actors and characters and perhaps give me more closure. It was on YouTube and I am pretty sure I watched it when it originally aired when I was in high school. Anyways, it made me even more sad. I don't recommend watching it."

howyoudoin,38qsf3,sandakli,20,Sat Jun 6 03:49:48 2015 UTC,It was a piece of fantastic acting from David and it had funny parts but the actual story was unbearable. The whole Joey and Rachel thing was terrible as most of us agree I think. But having Ross freak out about in that way after so many years and tank his relationship with Charlie was just painful to watch.
howyoudoin,38qsf3,ASREV,8,Sat Jun 6 13:10:15 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but I don't think Joey and Rachel were a bad combination at all.  The stuff where Joey has all the feelings and is conflicted and upset was some of his best character moments.  The problem with the relationship (outside of the audience getting all hot and bothered about it) was how Rachel handled the situation.  ""I'm lonely and Joey's hot...  I want a fling!""  Completely irresponsible of her because of how Joey had felt about her before.  Then she starts slapping him when they're making out and... she was just terrible."
howyoudoin,38qsf3,billmcneal,2,Sat Jun 6 22:24:16 2015 UTC,I agree the Joey character bits were fantastic but everything else was about that whole story line was terrible. You are right though a lot of it comes down to Rachel.

howyoudoin,38q0ze,foreverk,7,Sat Jun 6 00:49:56 2015 UTC,"For a long time I had no idea lasagna was supposed to have meat. Jews aren't allowed to mix meat and dairy, so in Israel it is fairly common to make a lasagna kosher by removing the meat (or sometimes the cheese)."
howyoudoin,38q0ze,Schnutzel,2,Fri Jun 5 23:02:10 2015 UTC,So you can't eat a steak and drink milk at the same time?
howyoudoin,38q0ze,DJ-Anakin,3,Sat Jun 6 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"According to Jewish dietary law (which I personally don't follow), yes. The original Torah passage says ""thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother's milk"", which overtime evolved into forbidding mixing of any kind of meat (but surprisingly not fish) with milk. The most strictly religious even forbid eating dairy for six hours after eating meat (and sometimes vice versa, but that's more flexible), some forbid using the same dishes and utensils for meat and dairy (even if it was cleaned in between), and the strictest would even say you should have two separate sinks in the kitchen for meat and dairy."

Phoebe and Monica are dawdling and Phoebe is eating the lasagna, which was specifically mentioned to not be vegetarian. I was a vegetarian for 10 years and there are a lot of things you can pick meat out of of you so choose, but lasagna is certainly not one of them.   I know it was just a glitch in writing/filming; someone wasn't paying attention. But I caught it and was like WAAAAAATTT."
howyoudoin,38q0ze,Rekavik,14,Fri Jun 5 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"It's moments like this where I always wonder why the actors aren't paying attention. There are a lot of character contradictions throughout the series and I feel like it's one of the actors job to keep track of their character histories and continuities. then again, this was season 1. so maybe they didn't care enough as they had poor ratings at the time and thought they might get cancelled."
howyoudoin,38q0ze,Rayneworks,3,Fri Jun 5 22:13:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the writer's sat down and said ""ratings are down? You know what would be terrific this episode? If Phoebe passively eats a lasagna that ISN'T vegetarian.""  Then again I realize you mean the writer's/actors were sloppy and tense or didn't care because of ratings and probably just didn't catch it with all the stress.   That makes more sense."
howyoudoin,38q0ze,theangrypenguin101,0,Sat Jun 6 16:13:07 2015 UTC,Pheobe has always been somewhat loose with her vegetarianism. She eats meat when she really wants to.

""The baby is totally craving meat!"" That sure is a nice cop out you have there Pheebs.  The same can be applied to the fur coat and shopping at Pottery Barn. It's apparent that she wants to do all of these things. I don't know, her character has always seemed fake to me."
howyoudoin,38q0ze,waiting_is,20,Fri Jun 5 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"In fairness, you can love meat and yet not eat it due to ethical objections to the way it is produced (I myself make the very occasional exception for e.g. Christmas roast, and I LOVE meat, but I really don't want to go beyond that).

howyoudoin,38n00o,feralcatromance,3,Fri Jun 5 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"No bro, the last episode on netflix is 47 minutes long and it's titled ""The Last One: Part 1 and 2"". Definitely merged into one episode."
howyoudoin,38n00o,passworduno,6,Mon Jun 8 13:36:15 2015 UTC,That happened to me with Parks and Rec :( my SO downloaded the episode for me and I knew there were two parts and I kept waiting for the second part and then it was over :(
howyoudoin,38n00o,trenchcoatangel,3,Fri Jun 5 17:53:56 2015 UTC,This happened to me when I was watching them on the DVDs for the first time!  There's 4 discs per season so I popped the 3rd disc of season 10 in totally unsuspecting. When the finale came along I was bawling and the 4th disc is actually all just extras. I feel ya.

howyoudoin,38pde0,kozmikushos,7,Fri Jun 5 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"I think they jumped the shark in season 7, and as you said got progressively worse in 8 and 9. I think the jokes are naturally worse which is ok. I don't get as caught up with the air quote continuity issues because it's a sitcom, who cares.  My least favorite was how the whole Joey and Rachel thing ended early in season 10. I mean I hated their story in the first place, but for it to end with a crappy ""resolution,"" that they are ""closer friends than Monica and Chandler"" is sloppy and bad writing. It's almost as if the writers realize they have nowhere to go with it, so let's not drag it out and give Rachel some time to be single before inevitably reuniting with Ross.  I think addition of Mike is probably the best plot of the last 3 seasons, along with M+C getting a baby. Everything else is cringy."
howyoudoin,38pde0,greatWallofUSA,5,Fri Jun 5 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"The Joey-Rachel thing is not consistent with the characters and that's why it was so annoying for me. They changed his personality way too much and too fast over a short period of time. I love Joey but it was so far from reality that he would hook up with Rachel or that she would ever consider it... Not to mention the complete lack of chemistry between them.  Mike was indeed a great addition though, Paul Rudd is awesome. He just started a few episodes ago with that hilarious scene with the air piano."
howyoudoin,38pde0,Schnutzel,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there. Season 7 was when I stopped watching the series regularly, and by season 9 there were more episodes that I haven't seen than ones that I have."

howyoudoin,38iafm,FCalleja,13,Thu Jun 4 17:33:15 2015 UTC,If I was them I would predrill the hole and then cover the hole that the camera would see with some plaster. Have the person on the other end put the drill bit in the hole and spin it up enough to drill in breaking the plaster make it look like the first time it was drilled but you obviously have the advantage of knowing exactly where the actor would be safe.

howyoudoin,38m1cc,Nyanloli,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:27:42 2015 UTC,This seems like the most likely explanation considering Paul and Rachel didn't know they were at the house. Presumably they would've seen   Elizabeth's car before coming inside.
howyoudoin,38m1cc,Dr_Girlfriend_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:05:47 2015 UTC,Wasn't there some mention of someone seeing tire tracks leading up to the garage?
howyoudoin,38m1cc,rushingkar,3,Fri Jun 5 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"IIRC that was Rachel talking about how Elizabeth knowing Paul and Rachel were there. Elizabeth came home exuberantly, which Paul questions and Rachel explained it away saying she must've seen the tire tracks leading to the closed garage."
howyoudoin,38m1cc,Dr_Girlfriend_,2,Fri Jun 5 16:36:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they still went there by car. I'm betting Elizabeth told Ross to ride a bike because it's either the store is too near to take the car and waste gas, or because the path leading to the store is a narrow one so the car won't fit."
howyoudoin,38m1cc,Nyanloli,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:04:22 2015 UTC,Or maybe elizabeths car is stick and she knows ross can't drive it?  Just a thought.

He did the deed, turned the volume down but could still hear it, and then he remembered the night before he went to his backyard with a glass of wine to listen to some music, which made him realised for the last 30 minutes he was blasting a porno on his outdoors speakers... classic Chandler if you ask me."

There is usually one to two batteries that are required to keep it up when the power goes out.  One at the ONT (if you have fiber like Verizon FiOS) AND one at the router (no matter which one you have).  If you have a cordless... same as you stated still applies."

The Friends making fun of him for being into science/learning really bums me out. I also like Monica and Richard's relationship more than I used to, and I feel for her during their breakup. I understand now doing what's important for your future and sometimes that means making sacrifices that are really difficult. I didn't really understand that when I'd watch this show during middle-high school. but I really like Monica/Richard more now that I'm in my 20s and in a relationship where we're starting to think more about our own futures."

howyoudoin,37u0wx,kmywn,6,Sat May 30 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe this isn't the best idea, but i used to think that they could make a movie from their kids perspective. Since all of their kids would be about the same age by now and in their teens. A few of them would be wacky and strange, one smart, some funny, and another depressing. I don't know though. It could add depth. Maybe not. Two of the original friends may hate each other so their kids do too and everyone else tries to help out. It could take place during Ross and Rachel's wedding that they had to prolong. Maybe Chandler and Monica are starting to drift apart and they're trying to light a new spark. Emily comes to the wedding and tries to get Ross back. Phoebe is a starving artist and Mike is supporting her and hanging out with the kids in super funny dad mode. Joey is back in town and acting weird about why what happened after he left.  The priest that was supposed to do the wedding has to leave and tells them he has a replacement. The replacement is Tad. Tad acts weird and speaks to Rachel about his feelings while completely ignoring Ross. Tad quits after Ross stands up for Rachel. They ask Joey to perform the ceremony last minute. And that's all i have for now."

howyoudoin,37qkeg,Lanlodger,17,Fri May 29 16:35:55 2015 UTC,I would recommend waiting until the end of the series to pass judgement on any of the characters. You're not even halfway done.  They do a good job of balancing the characters throughout the series.  Pairing Chandler and Monica was a carefully orchestrated event.  This article does a great job explaining how the writers decided to pair them off. Major spoilers obviously.  http://www.vulture.com/2013/11/friends-monica-chandler-how-writers-paired-them-off.html

Anyone else feel that the actress portraying Monica did her best acting in the first few season? I find her acting/character much more believable in season 1 compared to the later seasons.
howyoudoin,37qkeg,ChaosPony,1 point,Sun May 31 20:17:09 2015 UTC,Dude season 1 Monica is so hot. And the other acting stuff too
howyoudoin,37qkeg,lolthrowthis,1 point,Sun May 31 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"At that point in the series Monica is lost like so many young people especially in a big city. She's unsure of herself and often insecure being formerly fat. She faces rejection and uncertainty but she always has her friends. She provides them all with comfort, advice, food and hospitality which is what she does best. She is the mother of the group but often needs someone to fill that role for her. Especially since her relationship with her own mother Judy is not very good. Ross often fills that roll as her big brother - reassuring her, loaning her money etc. In the next seasons Monica becomes more certain and confident. Although her neuroses always remain, she gets her self and her life together.   It's all part of her character arc."

howyoudoin,37hbdm,AndysDoughnuts,-3,Thu May 28 02:41:05 2015 UTC,"He did cheat. Just because they were on a break, doesn't mean they were broken up. The rules of being on a break (like whether you can sleep with other people or not) are usually something that gets discussed, but Ross slept with someone before that could happen and Rachel wanted to end the break before that would happen too.  I've known people who've been on 'breaks' before and it just meant they didn't go on dates/hang out as much, giving each other space to think about what they wanted. But they were still committed to making the relationship work and would talk about the relationship every now and then. After a while, things went back to normal.  Essentially they are both in the wrong: They were on a break and Ross shouldn't have slept with another woman. It's just kind of dumb that the argument between the two of them came down to whether they were on a break or not."
howyoudoin,37hbdm,mathdhruv,3,Thu May 28 13:55:53 2015 UTC,"Except, the next morning, Rachel tells Monica that instead of having the big anniversary dinner, ""we broke up instead"". So, in her mind, they were broken up, although she regretted it."
howyoudoin,37hbdm,AndysDoughnuts,1 point,Thu May 28 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot about that. They both acknowledge at some stage that they 'broke up' rather than being on a break.   Just looked it up on Netflix: When Chandler asks Ross what happened to his anniversary plans, Ross says ""Yeah, a little change of plans, we're gonna break up instead"" and then in the morning when Monica asks Rachel pretty much the same thing Rachel says ""We kind of broke up instead"".  So, yeah, it's totally fucked. Both parties thought the relationship was over, one wanted to get back together (Rachel) and the other wanted to get over it (Ross, once he was of the belief that Rachel was sleeping with Mark)."
howyoudoin,37hbdm,Starburstnova,-1,Thu May 28 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"NORMALLY I'd agree 100%, but if I recall correctly, they did actually break up. It was only called a ""break"" in retrospect because they got back together the next day. (I could be wrong, I haven't seen the episode in a while.)  Regardless, even if it was a break UP, Ross was still an asshole for sleeping with someone so soon. And Rachel was arguing that he cheated because they were still together. They were definitely on a break or broken up. If it was a break instead of a break up, it was unclear and they hadn't discussed what that meant...which again, makes Ross an asshole for assuming it was a break up.  I dunno why people are downvoting you...normally that's exactly what a break is and it would be considered cheating if those were the terms they agreed upon. I didn't get the sense that they'd really communicated those terms, though, hence Ross's confusion and why I personally don't think he cheated. But I definitely still think he was a complete jerk/idiot."

You are 'In escrow' when you transfer money to a third party, such as a real estate agent, to then be transferred to the grantee or seller of the property. Once the terms are met the agent will transfer over the funds and the deal is done.   Joey of course thought that it meant that is where the house was located as they said the house is in escrow."

As of July 2, 2014, The Resort will be operated by Marriott International's Autograph Collection Hotels and owned by Brookfield Asset Management, according to the Miami Herald . Paradise Island first opened its Coral and Beach Towers as the Trump Plaza, then changed its name to Atlantis when the Royal Towers were built. The Coral and Beach Towers were later refurbished to match the theme of the Royal Towers. On 28 March 2007 a 600-suite luxury hotel named The Cove Atlantis opened on Paradise Island. Another tower, the 497-room Reef Atlantis, opened 19 December 2007.  Atlantis had to lay off 800 employees to face a decline in occupancy rates.

howyoudoin,37b14i,ameliagillis,68,Tue May 26 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"The truth is that babies don't make very interesting plot lines. Think about how boring it would have been if Rachel was offered the job in Paris, she talked to Ross about it, and they both immediately decided that she shouldn't take it because of Emma.  That's it. We wouldn't have gotten any closure to the romantic tension that was strung along throughout the whole series. We wouldn't have been shouting at the answering machine along with Ross to find out if she got off the plane. It simply makes for better television than watching two single parents make a mutual decision to leave things the way they are."
howyoudoin,37b14i,internetguilt,2,Tue May 26 13:49:55 2015 UTC,Well It just bothers me. I mean they could have though up a better ending where Emma wouldn’t interefere with the plot. Honestly the friends ending were kind of cringeworthy anyway. Plus everytime I see it i can’t stop thinking about how they ignore Emma.
howyoudoin,37b14i,tehvolcanic,26,Wed May 27 04:59:43 2015 UTC,The kids on Friends were mostly props.  The most character development any of the got was when Ben learned about the Holiday Armadillo.

Having kids should have been what ends their beautiful adult teenage living style as much as moving to Paris or buying a house. On Friends it's more ""oh hey I had a kid. Wanna hang out at the coffee house?"". I know series are not supposed to be just like real life or it would be as boring as real life but you still need to be able to relate to characters or situations to fully enjoy it and absolutely nothing in the way kids are raised on Friends is relatable."

Ben was there in a few episodes- like when Rachel babysits him, the holiday Armadillo and such. Even the triplets were featured in a few episodes.  Also, I think it's disappointing that Ben and Emma never met."

It just was recognized by the government, so they were not allowed the civil benefits (tax, health care visitation, ect) that the government granted heterosexual marriages.

howyoudoin,373c11,blaaaahhhhh,61,Sun May 24 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"Monica and Chandler's trouble conceiving was likely a result of Courteney Cox's having suffered several miscarriages. The writers possibly wanted to allude to that and didn't want Courteney to have to go through pretending she was pregnant. By the end if the season (and the series) she got pregnant again and this time carried the baby to term.   The episode where Phoebe thinks a cat is her mother was written by Marta Kauffman shortly after her mother died. It was said if it wasn't for that circumstance, the episode would have never left the writers room.  One episode had Chandler and Monica flying to their honeymoon but they get held up by security airport because Chandler makes a joke about a bomb. The episode was set to be broadcast shortly after 9/11, so the storyline was scrapped and another one was written and shot in its place. You can find the original on YouTube."
howyoudoin,373c11,Schnutzel,28,Sun May 24 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"I think the storyline about the other couple on their honeymoon who always got the free stuff ahead of them is what replaced it, right?"
howyoudoin,373c11,SagaCult,15,Sun May 24 15:48:12 2015 UTC,Yeah. Also I think the episode was literally going to be the next to air after 9/11 but like a lot of TV they had to edit it.

I'm surprised none of the, have released an autobiography with details... Im guessing they don't need the money just yet at 1m per episode each. However, it could just be that they really all were as together as a team the whole time... Just seems unlikely as no one gets along all the time, especially over such a long period.  I Just finished the whole series and have to say, they certainly finished on a high.  However, The loose ends were tied up too quickly towards the end, i think.  I know there's the argument that the show was meant to be about singles living in the big city, but it could have evolved and become something even better, the comedy was some of the best in series 8/9/10"

howyoudoin,36z2kb,feralcatromance,2,Sun May 24 04:44:54 2015 UTC,I like to put a paper towel in a solo cup and pour it in there once it's cooled off. Allows for almost immediate disposal.
howyoudoin,36z2kb,hey-you-there,8,Sat May 23 15:40:17 2015 UTC,Do not EVER use a Styrofoam cup.  Hot bacon grease dissolves Styrofoam almost immediately.    I learned this the hard way...
howyoudoin,36z2kb,HumanTrafficCone,11,Sat May 23 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's there but I don't remember seeing it.  You can save bacon fat and use it fantastically! Whenever you cook bacon you let it cool down a bit and pour/scrape it into a container. Then you can often use it in the place of other fats and it gives a great flavor!  I know, I'm totally betraying my vegetarian tendencies lately. I think the tofu in my fridge probably would be glaring at me right now. Regardless, bacon fat is a fantastic fat that many people needlessly drain or dispose of; IMO, it's worth saving to use as a fat with flavor."
howyoudoin,36z2kb,NewMerril,2,Sat May 23 10:57:51 2015 UTC,"I understand about saving fat, I guess my question is about why its in a juice glass uncovered"
howyoudoin,36z2kb,Lions08Owen16,18,Sat May 23 11:03:53 2015 UTC,She probably covered it and Chandler uncovered it in the hopes that someone would drink it thinking it was juice.

howyoudoin,36z2kb,kiariehanata,2,Sun May 24 07:47:47 2015 UTC,"It would have to be in glass, any plastic would warp from the heat.  It's also best to leave uncovered while cooling down so the steam can escape."
howyoudoin,36z2kb,caret-top,2,Sun May 24 07:56:07 2015 UTC,"You can't put it into a plastic container until its cooled down though, and by that time it would be hard as hell to put it in there, you'd have to scoop it out.  I mean I get the point of your thread, her character probably would have put it in a mason jar with a lid if the show were real.

howyoudoin,36z2kb,makinglogs,6,Sun May 24 09:19:06 2015 UTC,"Assuming she put it in there while it was hot - which, being fat in liquid form, it probably was -  glass is the obvious choice; you really don't want to put hot fat into a plastic vessel."

howyoudoin,36udqw,blaaaahhhhh,6,Fri May 22 04:58:10 2015 UTC,"On a different note, Phoebe always drove me insane. She's incredibly irrational and has all of these ""codes"" that she only keeps when they're in her best interest, like the time when she gets all on Joey because he cancels on her to go on a date, but she does the EXACT same thing to Ross a couple seasons later when she gets asked out in front of him and then tells him she can no longer make dinner. *cue laugh track  In addition to that, she's always instigating every fight between all the friends and meddling where she doesn't belong causing way more trouble than her funniness is worth.   I personally always hated Phoebe themed episodes just because they're irrational and chaotic."
howyoudoin,36udqw,Jonny_Tide,7,Fri May 22 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... every sitcom character, under analysis, would turn out crazy and horrible. This was called out by Phoebe's psychologist boyfriend, and similarly Kevin in HIMYM.  However, gotta defend Joey a bit here:  • He bought the barcaloungers and the entertainment unit when he started making money, and gifted Chandler with a golden woman repeller. He also lent money to Monica & Chandler. That's nothing compared to the money Chandler lent Joey though (a redditor did the math).   • He felt bad for screwing the student, but if we put our shoes in his as a struggling actor, that is to some extent understandable.  • When did he lord his money over Chandler and try to fuck a married woman? Jog my memory, please?  • He didn't rat out his dad. He pressured him to come clean to his mom, and that's reasonable.   • Again, when did he try to fuck his boss's girlfriend?  • Rachel and Joe were consensual and into each other. He never seduced her, and came to Ross before he confessed to Rachel.  • Joey and Chandler was competing for the Dutch girl. No stealing here.  • ""The woman he and Ross helped move in"" -> Janine? Please, Janine never cared about Ross.  • He asked for Phoebe's permission before asking Ursula out. After that, it was Phoebe's issue to suddenly change her mind and get irritated about it. But don't forget, he chose Phoebe over Ursula."
howyoudoin,36udqw,consuellabanana,6,Fri May 22 06:44:24 2015 UTC,"The woman Ross and Joey help move in is Kristen Lang - they both date her with the intention of letting her chose between them but mess it up for each other by their behaviour in front of her.  Joey mentions trying to get his boss's ex-wife to sleep with him, no-one's interested in talking about it and I don't think we hear about it again."

But its good to read your take on it, which is far better imo   A good thing as i'm currently just starting season 8 on a re-watch of all the seasons  The boss's wife thing defo makes no sense, unless im missing something  Have you a better spin for that guys last paragraph about the rest of them?"

howyoudoin,36udqw,consuellabanana,2,Fri May 22 13:26:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  The Rachel moving to Paris thing: she announced the job offer to Ross and discussed possible solutions with him. He didn't protest because he knew it was a great opportunity for her (don't forget they broke up partly because he wasn't very supportive of her career).   Phoebe had a dysfunctional childhood. The wedding thing is common among brides who don't want to spend that much money on one day, but still crave for a beautiful memorable day. She mugged people because she didn't have anything to live off. I don't have anything to defend the mother-cat thing, but Ross's tone can be very condescending, thus irritating sometimes.  At the end of the day, it's not fun when sitcom characters are normal and nice."
howyoudoin,36udqw,dragonsky,-1,Fri May 22 19:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sorry but this is fucking bullshit. Also using ""womanizer"" as a bad thing.  Like seriously if you want to you can turn every character into whatever you want him to do...  For example I watched one series where there was a guy who ever since he was a little he wanted to sing. So he went to singing school but they rejected him. Crushed with this the guy actually decided that the only way he can be of any use is to actually join the military so he can help his country. He selflessly worked his way in the army all the way up and eventually he ended up really successful.  Oh, actually my bad he wasn't actually singing but painting stuff and he got rejected from art school.  Oh and also I forgot... that wasn't a series but that was actually the life of Adolf Hitler."

The nonsense Pete spewed during the fight also shows that either the trainer was a shill, or Pete's full of himself.

howyoudoin,365ptp,yusernametaken,10,Sat May 16 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"That's the whole point of this episode... The next line in this sequence is Ross asking Rachel if she's ""just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?"""
howyoudoin,366a0z,i_bring_joy,9,Sat May 16 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"I think TOW No One's Ready might work without knowing a lot of history. Or, probably the earliest really funny one to me was TOW the East German Laundry detergent.  TOW the Cop could work for sheer hilarity (pivot scene), although does mention the Monica/Chandler and R/R relationships."
howyoudoin,366a0z,gamma_wow,3,Sat May 16 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"I know these are not from one of the first episodes, but I always ask people to watch TOW the football (S3E9) or TOW the embryos (S4E12). As you can probably tell, I obviously find competition hilarious. If you do want one from season 1 though, I would recommend TOW the blackout (S1E7)."
howyoudoin,366a0z,Cotomili,1 point,Sun May 17 14:03:16 2015 UTC,I say some episodes like -    The One with the East German Laundry Detergent The One with the Fake Monica The One with the Ick Factor The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister The One Where Joey Loses His Insurance - (although this episode has a spoiler that Ross and Rachel got married in Vegas)
howyoudoin,366a0z,Elly2014,1 point,Sun May 17 10:22:24 2015 UTC,"I think random ones like The One with the East German Laundry Detergent, The One Where No One's Ready, The One with Ross's Tan would be really good for people who have never watched the show"
howyoudoin,366a0z,GammonBlaze,1 point,Sun May 17 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"TOW No One's Ready is always a good choice. Awesome story lines, great jokes, classic Friends humor.   I also like TOW Rachel's Dream in season 9. You might have to explain a little backstory for this one but IMO it's one of the best Friends episodes. Each character has a hilarious storyline, there's a lot of funny conflict, Ross gets high on maple candy and there's lots of Phoebe's musical ...talents? I used this episode for a project in high school once and even non-Friends fans enjoyed it."
howyoudoin,366a0z,spandxlightning,1 point,Sun May 17 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"Any of the Thanksgiving ones - normally the entire cast is together on one set (the apartments). Lots of playing off each other. TOW No One's Ready is one such, as well."
howyoudoin,366a0z,dwain_da_bathtub,1 point,Tue May 19 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"you'd want something early on that doesn't depend on you knowing too much about the characters past relationships...but a couple that immediately come to mind, that have classic quotable moments were: -season 1, episode 15, the one with the stoned guy -season 3, episode 8, the one with the giant poking device -season 4, episode 8, the one with Chandler in a box -and, one of my personal favourites, season 5 episode 8, the one with all the thanksgivings (Joey and Monica both put a turkey on their head) hope this helps!"

howyoudoin,362zc9,aut0matix,24,Sat May 16 00:22:22 2015 UTC,Maybe it's because you were using your precious remaining battery taking the quiz. IT KNOWS

howyoudoin,362zc9,idwthis,9,Fri May 15 20:42:50 2015 UTC,I got Monica.   Wanna be best friends and move in together?
howyoudoin,362zc9,CelestialRose,6,Fri May 15 22:31:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Will you let me have a seashell lamp and a naked lady clock that goes ""woowoo"" when it hits the hour?"
howyoudoin,362zc9,idwthis,5,Fri May 15 22:59:07 2015 UTC,"Rach, I think we have enough regular lamps... besides, it doesn't go with any of my stuff!"
howyoudoin,362zc9,CelestialRose,3,Sat May 16 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
howyoudoin,362zc9,idwthis,4,Sat May 16 00:57:48 2015 UTC,Mmmm.... no?
howyoudoin,362zc9,CelestialRose,5,Sat May 16 01:00:32 2015 UTC,"Okay while you mmm on that for a while, I'm going to go find a place for my new lamp."
howyoudoin,362zc9,idwthis,6,Sat May 16 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"Hey Rach, you know what we haven't played in a while? Hide the lamp!"
howyoudoin,362zc9,CelestialRose,3,Sat May 16 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"Monica, let it go."

howyoudoin,362zc9,salradicchio,3,Fri May 15 22:35:44 2015 UTC,Do you have the link of the quiz?
howyoudoin,362zc9,meGustaa,3,Fri May 15 22:42:18 2015 UTC,There's two.   This one is OP's: http://www.buzzfeed.com/jenlewis/which-friends-character-are-you#.icOYov6Xp  And this is the other one I found on the same site: http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/what-friends-character-are-you-really#.ydXpODaBl
howyoudoin,362zc9,idwthis,15,Fri May 15 23:00:28 2015 UTC,Thank you! I got Rachel for the first one and Ross for the second. So I guess you could say I'm my own lobster haha
howyoudoin,362zc9,meGustaa,3,Fri May 15 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"I got Ross for the second one too! hahaha then I retook it, all different answers, and I still got Ross!"
howyoudoin,362zc9,idwthis,2,Fri May 15 23:38:20 2015 UTC,I got the exact same results as you. But I know that Ross is much more accurate for me.
howyoudoin,362zc9,billmcneal,2,Fri May 15 23:38:33 2015 UTC,I got the same results as you! :)
howyoudoin,362zc9,_coco,4,Thu May 21 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"Haha!  I got Mike. Works out, people call me Crap Bag all the time."
howyoudoin,362zc9,sarah_cate1,4,Fri May 15 23:38:47 2015 UTC,I got the same thing. It's accurate though. I'm just a child masquerading as an adult.
howyoudoin,362zc9,TheLizLemonParty,2,Fri May 15 20:52:40 2015 UTC,I'm 27 and I also got Emma. Apparently 27 is the new 3!
howyoudoin,362zc9,mrylzbth,2,Sat May 16 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"I got Tag. ""You're a child at heart, and you're still finding out what you want to do with your life.""  I'm in college and have no fucking clue what I want to do with my life.  For a buzzfeed quiz, that is scarily accurate."

howyoudoin,362zc9,GoAvs14,4,Fri May 15 20:52:05 2015 UTC,And making an inane comment that serves no purpose other than being an asshole is supposed to be the better option?

howyoudoin,364m8s,JWard515,1 point,Sat May 16 02:21:27 2015 UTC,Hey that's me
howyoudoin,362oum,GellerWillickBunch,27,Fri May 15 16:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after Emma was born we never saw Ben again, not that he was even in that many episodes anyway."
howyoudoin,362oum,TheLonesomeCheese,10,Fri May 15 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"I know, but I guess it would have been a good emotional moment to have them meet. Kind of like when we met Monica and Chandler's twins."
howyoudoin,362oum,TheLonesomeCheese,7,Fri May 15 18:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it would definitely have been nice to see that, but I guess the reality of child actors made it a more difficult scene to arrange, for just a short moment."
howyoudoin,362oum,idwthis,6,Fri May 15 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"I think they could have done an episode about the sibling rivalry that would have been sure to crop up from Ben getting a little sister. But then this show was never meant to focus on the kid aspect of the Friends, so aside from the few kid centric plotlines they did have I can see maybe why they avoided it."
howyoudoin,362oum,idwthis,7,Fri May 15 21:30:47 2015 UTC,I honestly think that an episode about sibling rivalry between the kids and having it mirror the sibling rivalry between the Gellers could have been hilarious.
howyoudoin,362oum,SoMuchMoreEagle,4,Sat May 16 02:45:51 2015 UTC,Exactly! But then that raises the question of if Ben would have nightmares that Emma was going to eat him lol
howyoudoin,362oum,Luxzin,2,Sat May 16 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but who is Ben?"
howyoudoin,362oum,SoMuchMoreEagle,18,Fri May 15 18:04:32 2015 UTC,"Uhh, the son of Ross?  How do you miss that?"
howyoudoin,362oum,AlliInChains,18,Fri May 15 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry.  For some reason, I thought this was the Once Upon a Time subreddit.   I saw Emma and just assumed.    Makes sense now.     Also, Ben is kind of a little jerk and would probably act out because Emma would be getting all the attention."
howyoudoin,362oum,SoMuchMoreEagle,10,Fri May 15 18:11:39 2015 UTC,I thought this too and was like wait what
