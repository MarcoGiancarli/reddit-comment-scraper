SuperShibe,3d1kge,Nail_,0,Mon Jul 13 19:38:15 2015 UTC,Cate no make sense. Doge is dumb spelling of doggie/doggy. Cate is nothing.
SuperShibe,3d1kge,mario_meowingham,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"The history of doge has nothing to do with the similarity of the pronunciation of ""doge""    The use of the misspelled word “doge” to refer to a dog dates back to June 24th, 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode of Homestar Runner’s puppet show. In the episode titled “Biz Cas Fri 1”, Homestar calls Strong Bad his “d-o-g-e” while trying to distract him from his work.   I personally do not think there should be an official pronunciation but personally I say Doge as they do in the puppet show.   Anyways ""Cate"" is the logical progression of how a cat fits into a ""doges"" world.   You can read more about here: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge"
SuperShibe,3d1kge,Nail_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the effort in this post and it is the best explanation i have yet read, but seeing as the original shiba inu ""doge"" picture and the homestar runner episode are 5 years apart, i am not convinced that there is any comnection without seeing some further evidence. The underlying joke is that the comic sans phrases are the written thoughts of the dog. Obviously dogs cant spell for shit because they are dogs; so ""doggie"" becomes ""doge"", a crude phonetic approximation of the diminiative phrase for dog. ""Dohj"" or ""dogue"" make no sense (unless you are speaking about the ruling class of 15th century venice) while ""cate"" is virtually unpronouncable."
SuperShibe,3d1kge,mario_meowingham,2,Mon Jul 13 23:01:06 2015 UTC,This video (https://www.youtu.be/yqtwpwso8Ak) although an unorthodox chat made YouTube gives an excellent history of how doge went from puppet show to internet meme.   The point of doge to me is that it is unique as it is ubiquitous. The general format and lose guidelines to doge speech are easy to pick up on and have spread to become ubiquitous online. However for something so spread out its also very personal to people who post and read doge memes.   To each of us doge means something because we have filed in the gaps of the simple meme that were not there. The only concrete thing about doge is its history from Japanese school teachers blog post to internet meme.   You say that the joke is that the dog is trying to speak and does so in comical broken English. Your explanation makes sense but doge lacks any substance for it to be concretely one thing or another. It cant anything definite because doge is whatever someone makes it to be with in the guidelines of another recognizing it as a doge.    Cate your right is an awkward word. However others have incorporated it into doges and I have accepted as a funny addition.  Cate is no righter or wrong-er then doge.

SuperShibe,387y8r,justsomepersononredd,0,Tue Jun 2 22:43:23 2015 UTC,"sigh I hate to be that guy, but remember when this sub used to be more than just a random picture of a shiba? I mean, the content was far from 'good' quite a lot of the time. A lot of it was just a picture of a 'wow' or a 'such' somewhere, it didn't even have to be out of place or anything, but at least you'd get some posts which resembled the original style of the whole doge/shibe meme.  Nowadays what we're getting is the remnants of the meme. The people who went out and got a shiba cause they liked the meme are now posting pictures of their shiba with some caption. The humour's pretty much gone.  I mean, I don't really have any proof to back this up or whatever, but I'm sure that any relatively long-time subsciber of this sub would agree that the content's changed quite a bit and in my opinion, not for the better. Still the community wants what it wants so I guess I'll just have to put up with this stuff. /rant"
SuperShibe,387y8r,Lefthandedsock,3,Tue Jun 2 22:06:36 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, and I've said the same thing.  It's always met with downvotes.  There are some truly hilarious old school shibes out there.  I think it might be over, unfortunately."
SuperShibe,387y8r,justsomepersononredd,2,Wed Jun 3 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yes that's partially true. The reason why I didn't add captions is because the shibe isn't really doing anything. Plain shibes are still damn funny if you ask me.  There are less people around to do the effort of photoshopping a shibe into some other picture, so that's why it seems less funny now, but there was also a lot of REALLY bad content circulating.  Yeah old fashioned doge meme is good, but if people can't think of anything, I say it's better to not ruin the image with bad captions and leave it plain to the imagination."
SuperShibe,387y8r,ablebodiedmango,2,Tue Jun 2 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"Shibes are funny, but not when they're just doing nothing. I mean, I don't really see much of an expression in this shibe's face. It's a pretty blank expression, but in my opinion if you can't think of any shibey captions or text to put on the image, it's really because there isn't a lot of comedic value to the picture. I mean, I've seen shibes that look agitated/angry and I really don't see that in this one.  Also you aren't ruining the image if you're posting bad captions, that's kind of the whole point of this sub. You'd be ruining the image with horrible captions if you're posting it somewhere like /r/aww or /r/shiba, but this sub really did revolve quite a bit around captions. There's even links in the sidebar so you can create them with minimal effort."

SuperShibe,3589bn,Narfhole,25,Fri May 8 04:15:46 2015 UTC,very serious question: are you prepared for the sheer destructive capacity of a shiba?
SuperShibe,3589bn,shmeeandsquee,32,Thu May 7 23:31:23 2015 UTC,wow

SuperShibe,3589bn,Agonze,14,Fri May 8 00:25:59 2015 UTC,This. This doge-ling is the most adorable thing I've seen all day...until it's ripped your couch in half. Then it's only slightly less adorable
SuperShibe,3589bn,kauni,20,Fri May 8 00:23:47 2015 UTC,He has 6 more weeks to go from doge-long to doge-lette before he comes to rip the couch
SuperShibe,3589bn,thedoginthewok,16,Fri May 8 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"My shibe's not destructive, she's a sweetheart. She's not a chewer, and has her own door and bed. She's 12, and still doesn't fetch unless she wants to.  She has taken to being creepy lately, going outside and then staring at us through the door."
SuperShibe,3589bn,superlalaura328,14,Fri May 8 03:15:12 2015 UTC,such creep         very mystery       wow

SuperShibe,3589bn,Agonze,3,Fri May 8 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"Like a dog? I don't know how we got so lucky. I think we just kept her busy and didn't let her get bored so she didn't act out. She loves the toys you have to take out of other toys, like squirrels in a tree or balls that squeak in a box with holes in the sides. Toys that are not balls or don't squeak aren't interesting to her.  We free feed because she's not greedy, and not fat."
SuperShibe,3589bn,Etonet,8,Fri May 8 14:09:38 2015 UTC,Did I mention he's fucking adorable though. Congrats on the pup.

SuperShibe,3589bn,ClintonHarvey,8,Fri May 8 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"Haha get ready. My Mr. Wow machine is just over a year old. I wouldn't trade him for the world, I love him to death, but fuck me if he didn't completely ruin my dinette set and chewed through college text books and 5 remotes.   Definitely recommend obedience classes ASAP at PetSmart or something similar. It really helped with him somewhat behaving. Also, they love to run. Be prepared to chase him when he accidentally gets out. They say don't chase (he'll just keep running) but what else are you gonna do? Mine loves to chase, so I run the opposite direction, yell his name, and he comes after me. Also, laser pointers.  Also, crate train him. Your life will be so much easier if you crate him from day 1, and have him sleep in it at night. You'll find out, they are like little kids and need to be put down for a nap sometimes haha.  Other than that, wow with him all of the time, and enjoy him."
