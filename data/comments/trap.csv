Not saying anything against UZ, obviously dude revolutionized the genre and has more than made his mark, but this track is pretty average.  The Frontier EP was great, though. Just in contrast."
trap,3e32e3,xTrill,9,Tue Jul 21 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"The thing is - it was probably not released for that reason. I assume it was just put out to promo the bundle, the AMA & to 'celebrate' the fact the ""Trap Shit"" series has came to an end."
trap,3e32e3,FrankFeTched,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I noticed the artwork is even old. Probably just never got a release and just did it to finish the whole Trap Shit series. Guess I can't complain all that much.

trap,3e32e3,xTrill,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:04 2015 UTC,Yeah but this was made in the early days of UZ so he got better and more famous overtime and probably had this sitting somewhere and was like fuck it and released it. Just wait for people to remix it.
trap,3e32e3,NStevie,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:17 2015 UTC,Which is why it wasn't released earlier. lol UZ wasn't pleased with it so he skipped it. People begged for it though and are now disappointed... Imagine that! It's like he didn't release it on purpose.

trap,3dyxt6,brackin,8,Mon Jul 20 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"its just a bit of news -  i think its the top submission because madonna is/was such a big name and to have her select diplo (even though hes a massive dj) as an opening act is huge as there are so many people who listen to pop music who dont know who he is. plus everyone on r/trap loves what diplo has done for the genre - by him giving the ok for flosstradamus to remix original don. also just look at his record label and the artists hes released on it: 813, baauer, dillon francis, dj snake, djemba x2, flosstradamus, gent x jawns, grandtheft, gta, carmack, remedy, yellow claw, zeds dead, etc  i get what youre saying about it not really being that relevant to r/trap but with how much diplo has done for trap music its unsurprising that almost anything about him will get upvoted here - and thats not really a bad thing"

trap,3dz1yr,Time_Terminal,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:21 2015 UTC,"Rapping has nothing to do with making a song trap, 808 kicks are a must, though.   One thing in this song is that the bass you hear isn't from the wobbles or any of the noises in the snog, it is from the 808 and a trap bassline separate from the other sounds in the song, if that makes sense. If it were dubstep the bass would come from the wobbles and the drums wouldn't produce much bass."

Also, I think it's an obvious point of discussing, that without Skrillex, EDM or electronic as we know it today would be a completely different media. He is the sole star of this industry and he is undoubtedly the pioneer of EDM and plays a vital role in whichever direction it goes. Of course, it might sound like I'm blowing some smoke up your asses, but when you think of this industry without Skirllex, I can't even imagine where it would be."
trap,3dwlku,HappyToBeHere24_7,19,Mon Jul 20 04:57:14 2015 UTC,"I was a junglist turned dnb head. I hated dubstep in general and bro-step in particular. So of course I hated Skrillex. Then I heard his remix of International then all the Jack U stuff and now I have to say. He did it. For better and for worse, but now for better. His new shit is live and IMO EDM defining.   Can't hate that."
trap,3dwlku,soundsdistilled,3,Mon Jul 20 05:43:41 2015 UTC,"Huh, all the nailcore junglists i knew were like the first guys to embrace dubstep, waaay back in the early days of like Mary Anne Hobbes and Joe Nice and shit."
trap,3dwlku,sunnO8,2,Mon Jul 20 06:34:27 2015 UTC,"Man, I had so many friends jump into into it and none of the dubstep I was hearing never did anything for me. I was hardcore vinyl too and the digital switch was really gaining steam. Had no interest in that either so just drifted away from the whole LA scene and djing in general.   Wasn't until trap in late 12/ early 13 and then bass music that got me back into new music and pushed my switch to serato."

trap,3dwlku,soundsdistilled,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"especially if you spin trap I can see that, since most of the stuff that comes out are new or small name artists on soundcloud that only release digitally. I play mostly other genre's, house, techno, footwork/juke, so its easier to stick to vinyl.  I do wish cashmere cat - mirror maru had a fucking vinyl release though."

Calvin Harris, Tiesto, and a group of others definitely had a massive impact on EDM. I neglected to think of other genres, but I think Skrillex still played a big role in Dubstep and Trap and evolved the genres into the powerhouses they are today."
trap,3dwlku,HappyToBeHere24_7,44,Mon Jul 20 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"Would like to see him hang Jack √ú on the shelf for a while and focus on making some more of his solo work. I don't mind if it takes him a long time for releases, as a Skrillex fan you need to accept the time it takes for him to release music, I prefer perfection over something that was rushed.  With him squashing the rumors of a new solo album, and Jauz saying that their collab basically won't be released, can't say I'm not disappointed. But I'm excited for the future.  I'd like to see him go back to his electronic roots and collab with Deadmau5, MUST DIE!, even a Savant collab would be really cool."
trap,3dwlku,Acipere,4,Mon Jul 20 03:49:25 2015 UTC,It would be a fucking crime if jauz and skrillex don't release this shit. JAUZ ended the set at audio on the bay with this song and it was just such a sick way to finish the set off. Both of their styles are apparent in the collab and the bass kick has such a great flow

So I'm not so sure that the new solo album is completely out of the picture. Maybe it will no longer be the late 2015 release that I was initially told of by people in his camp, but just 2 or 3 months ago Tim told me an album/solo tour was coming toward the end of 2015. Which means there were/are solo tracks being made"
trap,3dwlku,tsstx,27,Mon Jul 20 17:58:23 2015 UTC,"Skrillex is an interesting entity.  We got into dubstep a few years before he burst onto the scene, so watching him take this underground little genre and make it the biggest fucking force in popular music was absolutely mind-blowing, in both a good and a bad way.  It's easy to think of him as an 'EDM' powerhouse now, but before trap was even a glimmer in anyone's eye, Skrillex rocked the foundation of electronic music and (even though it's not his fault) Kind of completely ruined dubstep's original vibes in a way that it will never fully recover from.  The guy's a fucking legend.  We were drinking with a friend a while ago and someone brought this up, which I think sums it up nicely:  ""Skrillex is the reason Dubstep replaced Techno as the word your mom uses to describe all electronic dance music."""
trap,3dwlku,sunnO8,10,Mon Jul 20 05:23:50 2015 UTC,"Would love to hear something not Jack √ú - maybe something more like Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.

trap,3dwlku,seven17,5,Mon Jul 20 04:59:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly I remember back in the days when people were starting to hate on Skrillex, because all the stuff he released was sounding like Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. It was the Levels remix for Avicii and First of the Year in particular. Then he branched away from Dubstep and did some super original and unique cutting-edge stuff that nobody else did as Jack √ú with Diplo. And now I'm reading a lot of people wants him to return to his old sound."
trap,3dwlku,xTopNotch,3,Mon Jul 20 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"People hated him because of his sound lol. They weren't used to hearing shit like that. Now with the explosion of edm, mostly everyone is used to it."

So i started getting into more dubstep cause of him and just electro stuff..so then he released his goin in (goin down mix) and it got me turned on to trap..i had heard of rl grime and floss round that time too...shit like mercy and original don...but goin in was the song that made me go....""i can really fuck with this genre.""

I ripped the youtube video when it was posted here but the YT link is down now because of copyright infringement - does that mean something in terms of whether it'll get a release? I just uploaded it on streamable (warning: its fire). I think this track was revealed before Goh as I recall a video where Skrillex played it in one of his sets.

trap,3dwlku,hellofromsc,2,Mon Jul 20 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"Man I remember I also first listened to Skrillex in middle school, which is also what got me into EDM. I just graduated from high school and love his stuff just as much as I ever did. Never before had an artist held my interest for so long."
trap,3dwlku,carterhutton,3,Tue Jul 21 05:10:55 2015 UTC,He's freaking killing it atm. Liking his newer stuff like Ragga Bomb remix and Burial. JackU has been straight fire from the ultra2014 set and I think at this point he's unstoppable.
trap,3dwlku,beachedazd,3,Mon Jul 20 05:39:07 2015 UTC,he seems like the most down to earth dude in all the interviews ive watched
trap,3dwlku,cobbaluke,3,Mon Jul 20 14:06:28 2015 UTC,"He's one of my favorite artists! He seems like a cool guy too, he's not a douche like Diplo or Deadmau5. I remember when he gave his music away for free, he makes enough money playing shows he doesn't need to sell music. I've seen him twice, once in a small local nightclub Sammy T's in Huntsville, AL and the first Spring Awakening on Soldier Field. He use to release music left and right, like I said he gave it away - now it's a drought! A serious Skrillex drought. I didn't know how good I had it in 2013."

trap,3dwlku,throwaxanny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty much said this in a reply to another use but Skrillex got me into EDM when I was in middle school. To put this into perspective, I just graduated from high school and still absolutely love everything he puts out. I've never listened to or had my interest held by an artist for so long in my life."

trap,3dxyme,ExploreMeDora,5,Mon Jul 20 13:48:22 2015 UTC,I got new headphones. You would be surprised what good headphones do to music you thought you knew
trap,3dxyme,Nigsignoodles,3,Mon Jul 20 15:07:12 2015 UTC,And now you can never go back to bad headphones. Believe me. It is like an addiction.
trap,3dxyme,FrankFeTched,3,Mon Jul 20 15:41:07 2015 UTC,Do you mind if I ask which ones you got?
trap,3dxyme,spread-summer,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"I myself just bought a pair of Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro Plus. I used to use Soul by Ludacris headphones but made the jump to a better pair and it's the best purchase I've made in a long time. I listen to music everyday, for hours a day, so I felt it was justified to spend $200 on some."

trap,3dxyme,FrankFeTched,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:42 2015 UTC,sometimes if I get way too high (especially at a live show) sometimes I think I'm hearing things tat actually aren't there lol
trap,3dxyme,real_trap_shit,2,Mon Jul 20 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"When I was listening to Fire in the Room by Djemba Djemba and London Future after about the 5th or 6th listen I noticed that there's a ""whoop"" that continues throughout pretty much the whole song. I have a hard time listening to that song now because all I can hear is ""whoop""."
