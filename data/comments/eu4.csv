I had issues getting a simple independence war won in 1.12, mostly because Denmark didn't actually land troops on Gotland but let them move to Skane which made things awkward.   If you really want to cheese hard after that, give Sweden a province inside Denmark whilst their army is on it so they can't move off that province (during your war with Denmark, build some galleys so you can win the naval battle comfortably).   The biggest issue is Sweden allies, I think in my last Norway game I ended up dow'ing some OPM in North Gemany that didn't bring Novgorod into the war. That first war with Sweden, you have to take the province with the uber copper mine in it, that alone will give you such an edge over Sweden it's not even funny (also, use that war to get them to break alliances with powerful allies).

It survived until 1470 or so, which is when I'd managed to unite the rest of the berber states under my flag. I vassalized Granada and took the southern half of Iberia over time while doing the usual stuff: Colonizing and hoping the Mamlukes didn't die too quickly so the Ottomans wouldn't want all of my land and stuff.  I finished the Sons of Carthage achievement around 1590 or so, and I was sitting pretty at 3rd overall in the world, barely behind a still-united Ming and the ever-mighty Ottomans. The last step to getting the achievement was integrating Granada, who owned the southern half of Iberia.  This enabled me to click the ""Form Andalusia"" button, and I figured ""Hey, free prestige."" It moved my capital to Iberia, and all of my African holdings became distant overseas with 75% autonomy.

I attacked Poland, which had Lithuania under a PU and was allied with Venice. Numbers wise we were pretty much equal but we had the superior tech, like Lithuania was 2 techs behind in military and so was Poland. I had the same numbers as Venice (a 25 stack) but 125% discipline and 1 tech ahead. Not to mention the military ideas and 2 active military policies. I went to war immediately after I got my tech so it was pretty much a timing attack.   We had this in the bag. And why do I know this ? Because they attacked me in the past, i was on the defensive, and we wrecked them. It was so one sided I was giggling the entire fight.   So I go to war and what happens ? Scandinavia's 40 stack is just chilling in Stockholm while me and Muscovy are getting raped. And wait for it, after we both lose our stacks and Poland is balls deep in Muscovy, ONLY THEN Scandinavia sends their stacks to my aid only so they can get wiped because they were all alone at that point. And yes, they were not land locked because we had a 3 way alliance and Muscovy was bordering Scandinavia and Lithuania.  This happens to me all the time. When I fight the AI, they always consolidate their armies and attack as one when they want to remove my stack but if I want to do the same, I have to light a candle and pray to the RNG gods.  It was so rage inducing and ridiculous that I immediately thought of recording it but I was playing on Linux so I couldn't use Shadowplay.  And just to address OP's issue, if I was you I wouldn't go to war when it was that close, simply because I get burned way too often."

I mean I don't expect the AI to ferry troops across the sea for me, which is why I never get England / GB as an ally but if Scandinavia could have just ... marched. They weren't that far away, my borders started in Livonian Order since I owned their lands.  Muscovy had to cover more ground and they came to my aid but the Swedes weren't having any of that. Needless to say I rage quit and deleted my savegame.  I really enjoy Iroman and don't have any fun in normal games when I know I can roll back stupid decisions (+ achievements) but god fucking dammit it's frustrating to throw away a game just because you get RNG'd or AI'd.  I have an unfinished Germany game with 110 years left to play that I had to abandon because France was my only worthwhile ally  and they decided, out of nowhere, to break alliance and rival me. Like after 100+ years of fighting together, me aiding them in Spain and them aiding me with the Commonwealth, the game just decided ""Fuck you, I actually want to ruin this lucrative alliance just because you're big"" We weren't even border touching (except for 1 province) because there was some Burgundy and other crap left between us.  Ironically enough, this is the only game I've had where I can 100% say the AI was god damn useful and on the ball, and the one time I didn't hate France for simply existing. But then I get Paradox'd."

He didn't mention military tech and the numbers are pretty equal.  I try to do a mix of both since I'm tired of getting screwed. In one of my latest games I had Germany and could fight the Ottomans, Spain, a pretty big Bulgaria, Scandinavia and a tiny Swizerland (still had a 15 stack) on my own with no allies.

eu4,3e24xb,kingnomzteri,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:18 2015 UTC,Blitz Pomerania with Brandenburg to get them out.  Poland will probably help with this.  Go with them and carpet the place since they are isolated.  Muscovy has low manpower so just let them waste it sieging your nation.  Now it's the 3 of you versus a slightly crippled Muscovy and a mid sized Sweden.  Easy.  You alone almost have more manpower in reserve than your enemies.  This shouldn't be a very tough fight.
eu4,3e24xb,nupotsacred,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:07 2015 UTC,"If you attack you need a clear strategy. Here is what I would be aiming to do. This assumes you have common sense expansion.   Raise a few mercenaries and station them in a few of your eastern border forts. Station your actual army in the west. Declare war. Scorch earth with mercenaries in those forts to maximise russian and scandinavian manpower losses. Delete mercenaries in the east. Siege up pomerania. Only station minimal infrantry (mercs if you have the money) along with cannons. Obtain white peace from them asap. If you don't do this, then your best ally poland will not move their troops over to your 'at risk' border in the north east. Once they are peaced poland will be more helpful.  Once you have them peaced out you should move your armies east. We are assuming that sweden will have done the same but if at any point they launch an attack from the west then drop everything and go back to battle them. It's a great opportunity to hit an army with no hope of russian reinforcements. Now you just have to attempt to outnumber in battles as much as possible. Wait until allies are close then go for numerical advantage. Use all your monarch points on rolling for a high shock general. If all goes to plan you should be winning in terms of troops and manpower. Begin to siege russia up once their armies are mostly destroyed. I would advise completely ignoring swedish land. It will split your armies. Given time they will accept a white peace. Consider conceding defeat to them if opportune and it's worth singling russia out.   However, you could consider stealing crimean land. Are they allied to ottos?"

eu4,3dyftm,onemanmanywomen,8,Tue Jul 21 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with CPU speed, but I could be wrong.  I only say that because on my own system I don't notice much if any difference between autosave speed when using either my SSD or standard HDD.  I do, however, notice that my Core i7 860 (significantly downclocked b/c of stuff) autosaves so much slower than my father's newer HDD-based system that has a much newer Core i5.  Talking the difference between 1 or 2 second autosaves and 5-9 second autosaves.  Now I want to try at full clock speed, though I'm sure the overheating will become a problem very quickly.  TL;DR: I don't think autosaves are mostly disk-bound, they seem to be CPU-bound."
eu4,3dyftm,oddfox,7,Mon Jul 20 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that it is linked to your CPU, I did some benchmarks. It's not the writing to disk that is intensive but the power used to save the file. CPU spike in tests along with GPU usage.   I would suggest upgrades in RAM, CPU and GPU rather than a HDD/SDD.   But this is an expensive upgrade process just for some achievements lol. But it will only benefit you in any game you play."

Easy - I had Austria & Brandenburg as allies. Beating them down fairly handily. Sweden, Muscovy, and a number of small HRE nations cite coalition. Then, to really screw me over Ottomans, Crimea, Golden Horde declare war on me citing conquest of Moldovia.   Three wars started in less than a year. Folded pretty quickly."

Getting cores back is one of the easier things to do.  You just have to rethink your alliances, strategy,  and look for opportunities to exploit circumstances or the ai.  Brandenburg especially bounces back well with the ni's and being an elector. Most ai games I see them bulk up to around the size of bohemia before being broken down smaller than it's start size before becoming the 2nd or 3rd strongest German state in the end game.

This game is more about playing than winning. If I loose most of my land then hey that's a story of my country.   Also playing that way teaches you to pay more attention to things. If you can't save scam your way out of coalition you learn to deal with them or plan your conquest in a way so they don't form. If you can't save scam from being attacked by otomans as hungary you learn to drain their manpower with scorched earth and deleying them with mercenaries.  Etc.   I have nothing against playing with save scum but claiming that one bad even can ruin your game is over exaggerated.

While I have completed 30 years or so of Ironman gameplay (earning the very basic achievements) I gave up, partially, because it dragged it out by so much.  Auto-saving happens after most decisions and after each month, so from November 1444 to January 1821 it auto-saves over 4500 times.  (Solid state drive or similarly High-speed storage device are complicated because I am not a computer scientist)   Lucky Nations   I personally feel that this pushes the World towards a ""pre-determined"" destination rather than helping the player to play the ""what if?"" and randomised game.   I have self-control but like to explore   I like exploring the ""what if?"" (as above) however with only a single ""run"" I become too emotionally invested in my country to completely ruin it by exploring a ""Less than optimal"" option. Being able to have different saves of Great Britain as a Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Sunni, Shia and Hindu nation is funny....to me...I might be weird.

I prefer alternate histories which encourage anyone to come out on top instead of the most likely scenario of pretty much the same general Lucky Club always dominating.  So, I don't play Ironman.  Achievements are meaningless, anyway.  I play games to have fun, not win internet points."
eu4,3dyftm,ACardAttack,23,Mon Jul 20 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"I don't play ironman since I don't have all the nitty, gritty details of the game memorized.  So a lot of my major decisions are just guesses: when they go majorly wrong, I reload.  This is my biggest complaint with the game.  That the UI does not display enough information to make informed decisions about major events.  For example, I can figure out why I can't westernize since the UI doesn't say a thing about tech level disparity or why vassal annexation stalls.  I have to go to the internet to learn about stuff the UI should tell you."

eu4,3dyftm,Edoexplosivepawn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"Tool tips are your friend. If I'm not mistaken the ui should have that information. In the tech tree the westernize button should tell you the tech disparity between you and the neighboring western county. The progress bar for diplo annexation might give you a clue, or the diplo tab. You diplo annexation spends diplo points to ""core"" the vassals lands and it spends them at a rate determined by you're diplomatic reputation. If you have a negative rep then it will annex slower or maybe not at all if its too bad. Annexing vassals gives you a temporary hit to diplo rep so annexing multiple vassals at once might not be feasible. Edit: Although I do get where you're coming from and sympathize. The ui really could be better."
eu4,3dyftm,RhysticStudy,5,Mon Jul 20 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"I never play ironman because I really enjoy tag-switching mid-game, and also meddling in everyone else's affairs.

It's just more fun for me that way, plus all this achievement-hunting bores me to tears. I play for what I want to do, not what Paradox thinks is fun."

Couldn't stand the constant freezes from autosaving, so quit out. However, in that time, I did indeed get the Royal Marriage achievement."
eu4,3dyftm,dluminous,12,Mon Jul 20 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"No, you're right. However, it establishes an effective greatest lower bound on how many people play Ironman regularly.

Therefore we know that the percentage of people who do not regularly play on Ironman  must be greater than 85%."
eu4,3dyftm,Colder87,4,Mon Jul 20 16:11:15 2015 UTC,An autosave every month kinda sucks.
eu4,3dyftm,dluminous,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"It's probably the monthly autosaving that puts off most people from playing Ironman. If you don't have a good computer, it can take forever to save, and then you have to do it every month!  For me, it takes 2-3 seconds to save, so it's not too bad. But on CK2, it seems to take forever to save the game for some reason (and I've only played the game about 1/10th as much as EU4) so I have never played that on Ironman.  I dunno why they bother to force you to play Ironman for achievements. You can still kill the exe from task manager to quit without saving if something really bad happens to you that you'd rather avoid if you are inclined to do so, although I suppose even then you can only revert at most by a month."
eu4,3dyftm,Colder87,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:15 2015 UTC,Actually I can't get the achievement I thought it was broken /:
eu4,3dyftm,nietzscheispietzsche,3,Mon Jul 20 16:14:21 2015 UTC,I don't but I just started playing the game so it's understandable. I constantly reload saves of a few months past since when I thought a mechanic did something it turns out it did not.   On a side note: any tips for colonizing as Portugal? I started my first colonizing game and I find with a single colonizer (for now) it takes so long to set up a colony. I want to secure Brazil and around the African coast.
eu4,3dyftm,dluminous,3,Mon Jul 20 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"The ideas are really important, first go for exploration (for explorators) and you will get 2 more, with expansion you can get one and then you could go with quantity to gain another one (policies).  But colonisation is pretty expensive at the beginning, so you could also go with Trade ideas.   Basically colonisation is the same with portugal as with any other country, you just can colonize VERY early since you are not so far away from the colonies. So you don't have to bother about colonisation range."
eu4,3dyftm,nietzscheispietzsche,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in ~1480 and unlocked New world, discovered Brazil and I invested ~3 or 4 of the ideas in exploration so far. I have no lack of explorers, I went exploration and have 1 explorer and he sits at a port waiting for a colony to complete to increase his sailing range. I just opened a second idea set so that's where I am at now - I think I will go trade since I need $$."
eu4,3dyftm,_caponius,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"The nations in America are also insanly rich, so if you are short on money and have the exploration complete you can war them and get alot of money.  Also, colonize the valuable trade provinces in africa first."
eu4,3dyftm,Djackal03,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:50 2015 UTC,A) You can colonize more than one province at once; just recall the colonist and send him somewhere else. Can get expensive fast.   B) Get further through exploration ideas and you'll get another
eu4,3dyftm,bigmeanjoegreen,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm afraid of being attacked by Natives. What happens if they take over the colony again?. Also my money count is not high at all."
eu4,3dyftm,Artess,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"Park 2-3 infantry there and it'll never be a problem in the Americas. West Africa can be rough, so park 5-6k over there. Ally some strong folks in Europe (Austria is always a nice friend to have) to watch your back and/or fight wars for you on the mainland.   You should try to financially maintain N+1 colonies, where N= how many colonists you have. Once you get colonial nations in Brazil and the Caribbean (super important since it's the main trade node in the Americas), start colonizing one province at a time around west/south Africa so you can then move to the Phillipines unopposed and get that spice trade. Make sure to make your merchants work for you shuttling trade around the globe, and you should (eventually) have endless money to pour into European campaigns of conquest."

eu4,3dyftm,CptMortos,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"I play on Ironman because I love achievements - not just in general, but as specific goals. I start as Sweden and say to myself: Okay, in this run I get Lion of the North and Sweden is Not Overpowered. It's fun to play towards a certain goal. And then along the way I randomly pick up new goals. A Reformed centre of reformation right on my border? Hello, Center of Attention. Force-vassalised Muscovy, let them colonise all of Asia and now have a Pacific coast? Well, The Rising Sun, here I come. By the way, since I own a ton of provinces, I just invest a bit into manpower, pick up Quantity, and boom, A Decent Reserve. Oh, and since literally no-one in the world can stand against me (I had the pleasure of fighting the coalition of literally the entire HRE plus England, France, Aragon, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Lithuania and beat them through sheer manpower), I'll just go and grab a bunch of provinces around the world BECAUSE I CAN! But which ones? Oh, right, achievements! Well, then I'll probably be getting Trade Hegemon, Four for Trade (if I cant) and On Every Continent. The last one is easy, but I just never bothered until now. Well, since I'm on Ironman anyway, why not?  Also I got an unexpected gift: out of the blue, already after I became the world power, I get the message ""We formed a personal union with France!"" Well, the one time I get it is when I absolutely don't need it. Could go for Double the Love, but there's only 70 years left, and I don't even share dynasty with anyone else.  The moral of the story: if you love the pop-ups telling you that you've achieved something, you can suffer through monthly auto-save. But yeah, it's annoying. Also, if I don't play on Ironman, I'm afraid I'll fall to temptation of getting 9/9/9/9 leaders for my armies, and that's not fun. Well, it is, but only for a time.

Sometimes I'll actually go buff countries that are my enemies by increasing their stability and paying off their debts. It's just how I like to have fun.

I always want to achieve the maximum result and always micromanage like the world depends on it.   Ironman games also require luck... if you don't have it you are forced to restart and lose that precious time you put into it in the first place.  Example: 2 regency councils 12 years and 9 years really screw up your ambitions. Or a 0-1-0 ruler that just WON'T die... which puts you behind on tech as an eastern nation and pretty much screw up your game.   I find the biggest issue to be monarchy point management as a monarchy. Which is why I HATE ironman because it makes me wanna tryhard and I get frustrated if the game screws me over.

I started as a custom nation with Scotland's 1444 borders, decided to do a colony game in which i would jump my capitol to NA as soon as i could.  So i started out by annexing every Norwegian province north of me (Orkney, Shetlands, Faroe Islands and then Iceland) which is easy to do considering that their development is so low that you can core them all for basically 100 admin points (if that).  Sweden got their independence and then over the course of a few decades they wiped out the left over parts of Norway and Denmark.  I got my colonies up and running and to do the capitol transfer i had to basically be down to a single province in Europe so i created Norway as a subject and then sold them my mainland Scotland provinces until i was able to swap my capitol. I wrapped up by giving them Lothian to completely break away from Europe and concentrate on NA.  Over the next couple hundred years i would periodically go back and check out the UK and Europe to see what had been happening, Provence killed France and basically became the monster itself, The Papacy ended up ruling Italy, Castile imploded and ended up kicked out of Europe.  Then i noticed that my self created Norway had been ravaged by rebellions and the real Scotland formed out of its ashes, then Scotland started slapping England around before taking pretty much all of Northern and South Eastern England and forming Great Britain before eventually swallowing the remains of England in Wales and Cornwall.  That was definitely an odd game."

I would rather want a change to the ZoC of your own forts. If you have a country that is a bit stretched, enemies can often just walk through your land, ignoring forts, since there are neutral provinces on both sides, which seems counter intuitive."
eu4,3e1124,KaitoIris,2,Tue Jul 21 08:12:20 2015 UTC,"Not really?   Or at least, countries have done this in real life before. Germany went through Belgium to get around the French defenses in World War 2."
eu4,3e1124,BlackHumor,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I meant counter intuitive as in ""from a game mechanic perspective, forts are meant as a means to block enemies"", not as in ""this is how it worked in history"". If it was the latter, then we would have a different discussion... for example, why should a fort block you in the first place? Historically, a fort usually did not totally block advancement, although one usually opted for taking it to secure supply lines; but nothing prevented you from just going around it in a sufficient distance as long as the fort was not built on a natural choke point.  I just wanted to say that, if you have for example 5 provinces in a row and have built forts that cover all provinces in a ZoC, the ZoC currently is useless because you can go through it. So you have to have a country in a ""round"" shape to get at least some functionality out of it."

And because it is so long, you are not even able to easily send supplies around it, which might actually be easier if it was more of a small blob. RL arguments only work to a small extend when talking about game mechanics, since you find arguments for both sides of a discussion most of the time, which is why the developers use reality/history as a start, but ultimately only consider gameplay when designing features.  Of course, I can simply build my country such that I can use forts optimally, which also nets me pretty borders. But I'm definitely not the only one that already had situations, maybe after conquering some new provinces, where an enemy passes through my forts and it just feels like he should not be able too :)"

eu4,3e1124,Lanceth115,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:55 2015 UTC,Yes it's really shit. What I also hate is that enemy controlled territory has their unrest levels.

It took me like 6 restarts to get them to attack again but this time I didn't ally anyone and it worked well. I got all of the territories near me plus Corsica. A couple of years later Lithuania attacked Crimea so I took advantage of that and declared.  I then used Corsica to slowly move up to the Germanic region. The new provinces also allowed me to get alliances with Austria, Poland and Muscovy.  I honestly was trying to vassalize a OPM on the north Germanic coast but I couldn't make it work. An ally would always siege the province before I could get there so I had to go through Savoy and Burgundy."

eu4,3e3hy3,rks57,8,Tue Jul 21 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"'Manpower' doesn't work that way. Manpower is what you use to build and reinforce your armies, 1000 manpower per regiment and manpower equal to your losses respectively. What you mean is number of regiments. That said, a player 16 regiment army can still defend against an ai 32 regiment, as you can have the tactical ability to do things like get defensive terrain and river bonuses, only allow engagements where you have a better general, and take better idea groups. That said, a 50% morale boost would be utterly op, and a 16 stack would destroy a 32 stack if they had that bonus. Most morale bonuses are 5 or 10%, so maybe a 1 or 2% bonus per level might work. Even better might be a defensive die roll bonus that increases by one every other or every third level.  But basically, a large country should steamroll a small one, that's why you try to ally the rivals of any large threat. Choosing the right military ideas is also important. As the player, you have a huge advantage over the ai in terms of tactical and strategic decision making."

But you have to close other potentional colonisers (main are Portugal, Castile/Spain, France, England/Great Britain). These four will start colonizing soon after you, so you either attack them and get their colonies, or you shut them off by taking their ports.  Be aware that later on other nations will join in, so forget about inland colonization and focus on getting all the coastal/island provinces starting from the nearest ones (so that others will have to get further colonization distance)."
eu4,3e2607,Borsund,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:43:39 2015 UTC,Portugal is the earliest colonizer. As Castille you are in an excellent position to hurt them early. You are also strong enough that later on you can fight France and England and take their colonies too.  It would be much harder to prevent other colonizers as Portugal because you are very weak as a land power.
eu4,3e2607,fluffy_5432,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:39 2015 UTC,As Portugal it's probably easier to release and play as Brazil as a colonizer after you've given them a hefty start and colonized a bunch

eu4,3e2607,ojzoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, be besties and let Castille also colonize upstream.  4-5 colonists instead of 2 makes for a valuable home node.  Try to maintain 50% in Castille, grab Brazil, grab Ivory Coast, then head to India.  Get 100% and collect in South Africa.  Stay a devout Catholic for mercantilism and the treaty.  If I'm going for Africa I usually go all-in and annex the non-overseas portion of North Africa to help with my force limits."
eu4,3e2607,Andy06r,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"My Recomendation would be England. In this patch it's really not hard to ally England + Aragon and overwhelm France. Take Paris and one or two northern provinces then cycle missions for the PU. From there you can push down into Iberia. Eat the coastal provinces but leave them with an inland capital to stop them from capital swapping overseas.  The advantage is that it's much easier to dominate the English Trade Channel as opposed to Genoa, but it may be a bit slower than starting as Castille, not sure."
eu4,3e2607,Beebop_18,2,Tue Jul 21 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree with Beebop_18 here.  England is by far the best option.  Ally with castille and Austria and Force that PU over France.  After you have the PU, use that strength to take out Portugal/Castille.  Let France Eat Brittany. You yourself eat scotland (You can make it a vassal and use the ""create GB decision"" to integrate them) (you can even wait till lategame and take their colonial nations as well)   Somewhere along the way take out Norway.  There you have it. You are now alone in the new world.  If they already started to colonize the new world, you take their colonial provinces first and than take their homeland provinces"

Norway will meet a similar fate, once they get colonies I will colonize next to them for the casus belli, and take them and Iceland. As for Portugal who colonized freely, I will just try to make the Portuguese Crown event to PU them later. Or kill them. I will be the only colonial power left except Malacca."
eu4,3e2607,BertilFalukorv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:09 2015 UTC,I just find England easier because of the PU over France. (next patch it is fixed and getting a PU will be harder)   French attack dog will let you own europe. and clear up the colonizing nations.

eu4,3e2607,CzibiIsALegend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:42:10 2015 UTC,"The trick here is going to be the solo part, it's hard enough to block off colonizers but so many natural vassals in doing so will get exploration.  I'm not even sure if there is a Iberian country outside Aragon which doesn't get exploration/expansion. (I had a Leon vassal go exploration first on me)  I'd probably go castille because they have easy cb's on all the major colonizers and the extra colonist/growth from ideas will help you paint the map. You also start next to Portugal, who along with castille go exploration first.  England is the hardest to block off but you get the least ae taking their shit and exploration is usually their second idea.    Take Portugal islands and some land, maybe even give some of their land to Aragon if you feel like rolling the dice for the Iberian wedding.  Two wars and you can eat them all.  You should be able to stomp France pretty hard with Austria and Aragon or burgundy but again here I'm not sure which vassal you want to block the coast with, you'd have to check the wiki. I'd rush this even though France doesn't usually get exploration till the 2nd or 3rd idea just to start weakening them.   Use the cb on labourd to declare on England, be careful here they rock like up to 40 troops early and the ai isn't really good at invading the isles so you'll be alone.  Again you need to see who doesn't colonize between cornwall Wales Northumberland.   Then it's just the minors, a stable Denmark will usually integrate Norway before they colonize, Scotland colonizes as do the Irish and Dutch minors.  (Burgundy actually has 1 colony in my current game as one of their pu partners was colonizing as they were integrating. Brittany and the Netherlands will also colonize. You can go after Granada whenever you have the points they get expansion at some point. If you are really committed to the solo colonizer idea you can prop up Novgorod vs Muscovy."

eu4,3e2tvs,fluffy_5432,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't mean their relation of you will be negative. It means that they will have 30 or more AE opinion against you and they will be able to join a coalition against you. If you ment that it will decrease relations it does it with every nation, even if they have less than 30 AE opinion against you."
eu4,3e2tvs,DaDerpyDude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:23 2015 UTC,Yes it does.  Countries who will stay positive after the peace deal will not show up in the list. You can check this by improving relations during the war. If you get relations high enough countries will disappear from the AE tooltip in the peace window.  Countries need at least 30 AE against you in order to start a coalition. But as long as their opinion is positive you can go much higher with AE.
eu4,3e2tvs,fluffy_5432,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:41 2015 UTC,It shows people who will end up with both negative opinion and at least 30 ae

eu4,3e1h1o,SouthernBeacon,10,Tue Jul 21 05:53:14 2015 UTC,I think its a good way to prevent publishers from simply shagging 0ut broken game after broken game because they know they have to fix the one they have not just release the next BUT it does mean that anyone coming into the game at a late stage has to either make a massive investment OR faces a confusing list of expensive DLC's they don't know whether to buy or not.
eu4,3e1h1o,Spank86,3,Tue Jul 21 06:51:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, personally I spend a lot of time trying to understand if the game was playable in vanilla and, if not, what DLCs I needed. If I wasn't so interested in the game, I probably would just don't buy it at all."
eu4,3e1h1o,Spank86,5,Tue Jul 21 06:54:21 2015 UTC,It's a pretty steep learning curve anyway and it doesn't look that exciting if you watch streams on Youtube before you know what's supposed to be going on So I reckon it's a pretty massive barrier to getting into the game.
eu4,3e1h1o,Flouyd,3,Tue Jul 21 07:19:21 2015 UTC,Too bad addictiveness can't be demonstrated in video :P
eu4,3e1h1o,Cmushi,7,Tue Jul 21 07:29:57 2015 UTC,I poprally have a very uncommon opinion but I think the big patches are giving too much away for free. It makes me feel like the expansions add to little to care about. CoP and WoN feel like they are hardly worth it. On the other hand when they introduce a really core mechanic in a expansion (development improvement) the community goes nuts.  That being said I love all the music DLC and couldn't care less about unit packs. The fact that they started to bundle music and unit packs into one content pack kinda bugs me
eu4,3e1h1o,Flouyd,2,Tue Jul 21 07:02:49 2015 UTC,"Most of the free stuff we get are revamped systems (colonial nations, cardinal system, reformation spread, development)."
eu4,3e1h1o,Moranic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:14:50 2015 UTC,"The bundles seems a little odd to me. When I bought the game I thought I was buying only the base game, but it was a bundle."
eu4,3e1h1o,TheWhitestGandhi,2,Tue Jul 21 07:15:59 2015 UTC,That's not what i meant. Paradox started to bundle all the cosmetic DLC for a patch in 1 content pack like this http://store.steampowered.com/app/338161/ I guess it limits the DLC spam so EU4 wont look like CK2 any time soon but I liked that you could piecemeal your DLCs (for example onyl the music)
eu4,3e1h1o,MacGillycuddy_Reeks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:25:41 2015 UTC,"I see. And I agree. But a massive list of DLCs can be very astounding. If it show it as ""cosmetic DLC"", ""music DLC"", ""expansion packs"" and we click on it to expand the list, it would be better, but that's up to Steam, so I don't know how to solve this problem."
eu4,3e1h1o,Andy06r,4,Tue Jul 21 07:34:56 2015 UTC,Combined with the very frequent sales I think it's a wonderful model. And the way it works in Multiplayer is great too (if the host has the DLC the clients can use it too).
eu4,3e1h1o,Legios1,2,Tue Jul 21 10:35:36 2015 UTC,That's the best part for me; I have a friend that's willing to buy every expansion soon after it comes out so when my group of EU4 buddies plays together we all get to experience the most up-to-date DLC.  The rest of us are cheap bastards so when we go play singleplayer we realize how much we're missing out on.
eu4,3e1h1o,DarkNinja3141,6,Tue Jul 21 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"It's bullshit.  Things like Charlemagne and Old Gods are worth the money. What isn't worth the money is the Ruler Designer and similar things. That should have been part of the game from the start. Same with being able to play as Muslims/Republics. The EUIV converter should have also been part of the game. Say you bought both CK2 and EUIV for £30 each, then you have to shell out some more money to convert your games? It might not be much more (relatively speaking) but still.  Paradox is just that: a paradox. They make great games and a lot of the DLC add great features, but charge for a lot of things."
eu4,3e1h1o,bluebottled,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:53 2015 UTC,"But this kind of things take time to be made. If it was in the release, would you think ok to wait a few more months, maybe even an year, and probably pay more for the vanilla game?"
eu4,3e1h1o,tsargtsarg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:07 2015 UTC,But converters and custom nations are optional content.  The only reason I have either is because of the super bundles - they don't interest me.  Something that interests many players and is meh to many others is pretty much the definition of DLC.
eu4,3e1h1o,SvengeAnOsloDentist,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"I'm all for DLC's and if they make the game running for few years longer, I'll gladly pay for DLC expansions.   However, cosmetic dlc's that come out with the expansion are just a bit wrong in my humble opinion.  I mean, come on, if you want to get the ""expansion flavor"" you have to cough out around 25-30 euro, and that's a bit too much.   Common sense expansion was just plain wrong. Adding development, but, if you don't buy the expansion, you're a bit boned. So, there is that.   I've got Vic2,CK2 and EU4 and have around 80% of dlcs for those games, including music, portrait and unit packs, I really like Paradox and their games, but their DLC model doesn't seem fair, especially for new players."
eu4,3e1h1o,tsargtsarg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"If you don't buy the expansion, you can't build buildings in some provinces. It makes playing as a custom nation in the new world worse"
eu4,3e1h1o,kirdan84,3,Tue Jul 21 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"It's pretty awful. Stripping out unit models and music from the expansions they should be included in so they can overprice both, opting for quantity over quality meaning we get rushed, half-assed features (save converter, random new world, development, etc.).   Also, the total cost is ridiculous. I'm pretty confident that if I was coming to the game new I'd pirate it all and wait for the complete bundle to be on sale, unfortunately I bought into it from the start and so have paid for the value of the game several times over.  If they'd bundled all the flavour content (unit models, music) with their expansions, dropped the price to £10, and given away shit like Purple Phoenix and American Dream away for free, you'd probably get a price closer to the actual value of the complete game with all DLCs."
eu4,3e1h1o,MikeyTupper,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:17 2015 UTC,"I only have one DLC for EU4- El Dorado. However, I have purchased much DLC for CK2. I know that it was my choice to buy it, of course, but I must say that I think that the DLC model, for CK2 at least, is not very fair to the customer. I very much like the content of the DLC, and do not hold Paradox accountable for me buying it, but think that much of it really could have been packaged with the base game. All of the unit models and character portraits really should be part of the vanilla game. It's ridiculous how many purchases are required just to make the models and portraits look somewhat realistic (without DLC the portraits come in two flavors: pan-European, and non-European). The large DLC like The Old Gods makes sense, however."
eu4,3e1h1o,haloraptor,5,Tue Jul 21 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"I think the aesthetic packs are my favorite part of paradox's dlc model. They really aren't important to me, I haven't bought a single one, and not including them probably doesn't decrease the cost of the base game noticeably, but they're very good for the company. They provide a small, steady stream of revenue from those people to whom they are worth enough to buy, supplementing the development of paradox's brilliant content, and making them less dependent on trying to get new dlc out as quickly as possible to keep making a profit, so they can make us better stuff. They are also great for the artists, as they can keep their team continuously employed making portraits, unit sprites, etc., instead of just hiring people for a little bit to make all of the artwork at once then leaving those people to find some other work."
eu4,3e1h1o,MikeyTupper,2,Tue Jul 21 06:09:58 2015 UTC,"When you say that it should be part of the vanilla game, you mean at the release of including on the free patches?"
eu4,3e1h1o,Beebop_18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:21:30 2015 UTC,"Either is fine, I just meant that the portraits and unit models should be free, even if it means increasing the price of the base game a bit (but not as much as the price of all the portrait and model DLC + the price of the game). I just find two dollars for one of the many portrait sets unreasonably expensive. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Again, I know I don't HAVE to buy it, but it really just completes the game. The game seems unfinished without the extra portraits. Last time I checked, Mongols and Sub-Saharan Africans don't look exactly the same, and neither of them look like Arabs..."
eu4,3e1h1o,MikeyTupper,2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:27 2015 UTC,"It is fine. IMO theirs DLC should add more flavor and not game mechanic change that often. More missions, more events, more decisions more dynamics."
eu4,3e1h1o,Reyfou,2,Tue Jul 21 07:32:49 2015 UTC,It would be fun if they added lengthy background historical info on each province that you could click and read while you're not at war and waiting for rebels to appear.
eu4,3e1h1o,Rapester-,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:34 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy having additions to the game, and I like the new content and features, but I am a bit sad at the money I've spent. But I've put 1200 hours into EU4 so it's not as if I'm not getting my value for money, is it?"
eu4,3e1h1o,zsimmortal,2,Tue Jul 21 10:41:14 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. I don't know how much I spent on the game but it's a tidy sum. But the hours played/money paid ratio is too damn good.
eu4,3e1h1o,Ichigo1uk,2,Tue Jul 21 12:57:35 2015 UTC,"One thing I really like is that everyone gets the DLC on multiplayer if one person has it. It makes it a lot easier for me to convince other people to get in on this game.  I do think that they should lower the cost of the base game and release some sort of base game + 'core' DLC ( AoW, Common Sense) pack though. The price and complexity is just too much to attract new players which is poor business IMO"
eu4,3e1h1o,MikeyP63,2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"There's too much of it, yet I throw my money at the screen whenever a new piece pops up. It's a very abusive relationship."
eu4,3e1h1o,sunnyandtony,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly I find it very, very expensive. (But I end up buying everything).  Most music/graphics/portraits DLCs are not worth it, in my opinion(since you can have even better music/portraits in steam workshop for free).  I have all DLCs. Art of War is a must have. Despite what people say, I really liked the changes in Eldorado. The others are ok.  My only regret is one of the music packs that I find so, so annoying. (That girl screaming when you lauch the game. Had to disable that).  Anyway, eu4 is for sure the game I have spent more money in all my life. But its one of the my most played games as well, so I guess it's worth it?"
eu4,3e1h1o,pee5Ciej,2,Tue Jul 21 13:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think the Multiplayer DLC policy is very, very classy. Literally caused me to get the game, and then fall in love with it. Compare to Civilization and most other games, where if your friends don't buy the DLC you can't play it with them.  I've told them before that they should make everything older than the last 3-5 main DLCs (and base game) free. If the perceived barrier to entry is too high for most people it'll hurt sales, but testing would be required to see if it would be a profitable move.  Either way I'm happy with Paradox. They're one of the classiest and best game devs around."
eu4,3e1h1o,CynicalCommunist,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:17 2015 UTC,"Excellent. Choose what you want, most of the stuff goes on sale for dirt cheap. The only problem is how much they give away for free, apparently, because people now seem to think it's unfair that they'd have to pay for new fun features when every other game would straight up make people pay for everything (e.g. CiV requires you buy every single DLC to have more than half of the Civ roster, religions, ideologies, trade routes, etc.)."
eu4,3e1h1o,Extracheesy87,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:58 2015 UTC,I think my biggest criticism would be that the base game is still £35 on steam and on other sites the lowest is i think around the £26 range. It's close to 2 years old now and is well due a price decrease regardless of the discount sales.
eu4,3e1h1o,MrPutey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:49 2015 UTC,"If you're paying anything close to full price for a Paradox game, you're doing it wrong."
eu4,3e1h1o,CynicalCommunist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the idea of what Paradox is doing is rather great. Honestly, I would rather have a game perfected over time and improved upon in order to give gamers more time with that game, especially when it comes to grand strategy games.   As for the way Paradox does it, I would prefer to see them be more open to new players. There have been a few new players on the forums lately, and they often ask ""What do I need to buy to play the game?"" While all the DLC is great, I think there should be a pricing scheme that helps both Paradox and new players/players without much cash flow. I think by the second DLC, the base game should be around $14.99 and $9.99 during sales. Then, depending on how old the DLC is, there should be pricing on it to reflect the age of it. For example, Common Sense should be $19.99 or $14.99,  and Art of War ought to be $14.99 or $9.99, and older DLCs should be $4.99.   Yes, I am sure Paradox worked a lot on the game, but there also needs to be balance between income from seasoned gamers like me who will just buy the DLC when it comes out, people who can't afford a DLC when it comes out, and new players.   In my own personal opinion, I think that unit packs, music, and e-books are a waste of time and especially money. If you get them bundled in a Steam sale, go for it, but otherwise, I don't think changing a unit's appearance is worth $2.99 or $1.99. Personally, these should just come with the DLC, or not have them. It seems like micro transactions that detract from new users.  New users aren't going to instantly know what they should buy and what they shouldn't buy. They might end up accidentally buying a bunch of unit packs thinking that is what they need and miss out on the content in a DLC, and that could lead to them losing interest.  Right now on Steam, these are the prices:  Base Game - $39.99  Extreme Edition - $44.99  Collection - $99.99  DLCs  Common Sense - $14.99  El Dorado - $14.99  Art of War - $19.99  Conquest of Paradise - $14.99  Wealth of Nations - $9.99  Res Publica - $4.99"
eu4,3e1h1o,CynicalCommunist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"Well I still buy almost every one, since the Paradox games are like crack, but the DLC are a bit expensive, the quality suffers as no one is able to test all enabled/disabled DLC combinations. The CK2 has some core mechanics as addon(retinues, playing as Muslim/Indian/Republic). What I really wonder is who will buy EU5/CK3 if basic version will be missing stuff people already paid for in older versions :P"
eu4,3e1h1o,Extracheesy87,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"I am very much against paying for intellectual property in general, but with the current false scarcity, I still dislike DLCs. I have no problem if it were a functional game that would get updated consistantly and also have a few expansion packs with lots of nonvitql features (think Civ 5), but Paradox is putting vital features in small DLCs.  I think they should just do the same Mojang does with their games, and just do free updates. It's not like they need the money, their games sell really well. The DLCs are just annoying and badly planned."
eu4,3e1h1o,CynicalCommunist,6,Tue Jul 21 07:46:42 2015 UTC,"""It's not like they need the money, their games sell really well."" You have no idea how expensive game design is do you.

eu4,3e010e,Kashchey,2,Tue Jul 21 04:40:37 2015 UTC,Excommunication? I only ever saw the AI using the crusade option (and not very often) with minimal success. What modifiers does excommunication give the target country?
eu4,3e010e,BuzyB,2,Tue Jul 21 09:56:03 2015 UTC,"Curia controller can only excommunicate if the Papal States has a negative opinion of the target, so it's rarely an available option. It causes some minor negative modifiers, and gives neighbouring Catholics the excellent Excommunication CB (50% AE on claims and neighbouring provinces)."
eu4,3e010e,Kashchey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:14:50 2015 UTC,"Question - when you're playing as the Pope, what are surefire ways to make yourself hate another country so you can excommunicate?"
eu4,3e010e,ChickenpoxForDinner,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:26 2015 UTC,"Haven't explored it fully yet.   Rivalry (you rivalling them) gives -75 Their refusing military access another -10 If you're allied beforehand you can probably call them into a war when you know they won't accept for -50 I think, and another -50 for dishonoured alliance You having a claim on them is -5  A CB on them is a further -15   Those are all I can think of that are under your direct control."

Fully occupy them for a year or so, and just watch them fall over and over to peasents, seperatists and every neighbor with a grudge. Few things in this game have been more fun for me than watching little burgundy, Hainaut and Switzerland consecutively 1v1ing France and winning."

eu4,3e2kt7,apache_alfredo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"Colonial nations depend on colonial regions. If you conquer a province in a colonial region (see the specific map mode for this) where you already have a colonial nation, the province will flip to this nation the next day. However, if you conquer provinces in a region without a colonial nation, you will have to get 5 cores in this region first, such that a colonial nation forms at the beginning of the next month. This nation will also take all remaining (uncored) provinces at the next day."

They're only available when the tech difference between two countries is >= 60% (for Westerners, this is Indians and below except Nomads).  The reason Itza wasn't folded into New Spain is because I'm pretty sure they're in the Colonial Colombia region.    Tradewise, in this patch the real money is to try and take over the Genoa tradenode."
