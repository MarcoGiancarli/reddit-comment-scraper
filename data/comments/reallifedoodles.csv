reallifedoodles,3dqq2j,croppedcross3,4,Sat Jul 18 17:45:25 2015 UTC,Builder here depending on the end pointy there referred to as lag bolt mostly for wood attachment flat end known as machine bolts
reallifedoodles,3dqq2j,secondsbest,2,Sat Jul 18 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"I've heard them called lag screws more often than lag bolts. To me the difference is you bore a hole for a bolt, and a screw does it itself. Also a bolt generally has a nut of some sort, while a screw anchors itself"
reallifedoodles,3dqq2j,croppedcross3,2,Sat Jul 18 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"If you try to put it in a lag bolt without predrilling, you're gonna split whatever you're putting it into."
reallifedoodles,3dqq2j,secondsbest,3,Sat Jul 18 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"But a hole for a lag bolt is sized for a clearance fit, and a lag screw hole is undersized for screw thread bite. That's the difference in the terminology."
reallifedoodles,3dqq2j,Hamadaguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:13:59 2015 UTC,Your use of lag hole and lag bolt is confusing me. Are you saying there's two different things?
reallifedoodles,3dqq2j,bigbluegrass,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:23:36 2015 UTC,"It's a hole for a lag bolt, and a hole for a lag screw. I just phrased the second part 'lag screw hole'. Each type has a different thread design depending on how they fasten."
reallifedoodles,3dqq2j,II-Scum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:35:22 2015 UTC,Then I'll call it a bolt from now on.

reallifedoodles,3d06rm,rickmaninoff,2,Sun Jul 12 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Look up Satoshi Kon.  He directed Paprika and a lot of his movies are pretty mind-bending stuff.  They've also had a lot of influence on Western films as well (like the aforementioned Paprika and Inception, or Perfect Blue and Black Swan)."
reallifedoodles,3d06rm,dankmernes,2,Sun Jul 12 16:17:28 2015 UTC,Spirited...your son?
reallifedoodles,3d06rm,SpyMaster356,2,Sun Jul 12 23:52:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I do recommend Spirited Away if you have not seen it yet.  As for other anime, i recommend Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann if you want something to turn your brain off for, Sword Art Online if you like video games and MMOs, or Fairy Tail for some magical explosions."
reallifedoodles,3d06rm,Dunkeal,5,Sun Jul 12 15:03:24 2015 UTC,It's because I've seen spirited away more times than I've been to bathrooms.   And thanks for the recommendations :)
reallifedoodles,3d06rm,Yllarius,11,Sun Jul 12 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"I never got the SAO recommendations, To be honest Log Horizon is so much more interesting, and so much less...stereotypical. Though if you REALLY wanna get in deep, .Hack//signs is an amazing MMO anime.   I havn't seen Paprika, but I my recommendations are Fate/Zero (It's pretty dark.) and Steins;Gate. Attack on Titan is super popular right now, and particularly brutal.   To be honest I don't like anything that doesn't feel new to me, which is why these are my recommendations."
reallifedoodles,3d06rm,icelander08,3,Sun Jul 12 16:06:08 2015 UTC,"I don't get what people see in attack on titan, I feel like they made it too shounen? for me. Would have liked it being more serious somehow."
reallifedoodles,3d06rm,SpyMaster356,2,Sun Jul 12 16:14:23 2015 UTC,The thing that drew me to SAO was the Death Penalty. Knowing that any of the characters could literally die at any point was what drew me to the series.

reallifedoodles,3d06rm,SpyMaster356,10,Sun Jul 12 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"In the nerf war video, it's hard to tell who is on what side of the battle because the camera jumps across the line a bunch of times.   When the camera does this, it disorients the watcher as they are expecting the people to stay on that side of the screen. The Paprika scene shows two examples of this, once with the detective walking up the steps to the clown, and then again in the theatre where he is explaining it to Paprika."

Whenever I had to reinstall my OS it was in the middle of the night and the only copy I had was on CD... Might be partially explain because an available USB key has a life expectancy of about 20 minutes in my house, after that, for some reason, they tend to get filled with super important files and holidays pictures of which no copy exists and that no one shall delete or move until the end of days..."

Even if it continues to exist, I imagine it'd be easier to just have it be on rigid stilts to begin with (or just being waterproof), which would both be cheaper and less prone to issues (not detecting the spill, mechanical issues with the stilts coming up, something heavy stacked on the drive, etc)."
reallifedoodles,3cfpq5,neeon88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same in the US... Any nice laptop doesn't have a disk drive.   Only the really high end large ones do. (17 inch plus generally).   You're hard pressed to find any decent laptop with an optical drive. Either you get something huge and clunky, or cheap and crap.   I actually don't mind it, as I think it's great, since it makes them more portable and lighter. I mean in really high end laptops sure, but most of those will be huge anyway just due to the cooling and components used, so it's not a big deal."

reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,walc,9,Tue Jun 30 15:08:21 2015 UTC,Any animation software that will allow you to import .gif files or movies and supports hand-drawing or asset importing should work just fine. I'd personally use Photoshop as it has an animation mode and drawing tools - I'm unfamiliar with most other programs.
reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,EnigmaticPhilomath,6,Tue Jun 30 16:41:59 2015 UTC,"i use flash 8. get any gif, open it in a program which shows you all the frames and then draw on each frame. using an onion skin will make it easier because it lets you see what you drew on the previous frame(s)."
reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,sooperdavid,5,Wed Jul 1 17:37:49 2015 UTC,You could check out The GIMP for pulling in your gifs and having it separate them into layers. Then export the layers back out as a GIF.   There are several places to do things like this. Also check out Adobe After Effects.
reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,Heratiki,13,Tue Jun 30 16:50:13 2015 UTC,"...but seriously, what program do you use? I'm on a Mac."
reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,jeremiah1119,34,Tue Jun 30 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"Super complicated way: Download Blender (free 3d software). Import gif and export as .png / .Jpeg files. Open up photoshop / Mac paint equivalent. Paint each individual frame. Import all pictures back into blender as image sequence, export as .Mp4 and upload to gfycat   Easy way: Download one drawn 3 months ago and re-upload for karma"
reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,PM_ME_YOUR_DESIGNS,8,Tue Jun 30 16:10:58 2015 UTC,Why use blender when you can use something much easier like iMovie?

reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,jeothesmar,6,Tue Jun 30 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Why not just draw on the .gif pictures, though? Why bother converting them to jpg or png?"
reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,jeremiah1119,3,Tue Jun 30 16:37:28 2015 UTC,Because you go frame by frame! Another option would be to use after effects
reallifedoodles,3bn0d8,wat555,3,Tue Jun 30 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"You could, just off the top of my head I don't know if it natively supports .Gif files, which is why I mentioned it."

You don't hear a joke from someone at the office, then tell the same joke to other co-workers with the original teller in room, who may have gotten it from somewhere else, and NOT credit them.  It's the same principle."
reallifedoodles,3ap0br,Miltrivd,9,Mon Jun 22 23:02:21 2015 UTC,"I think you are confusing concepts.  OC for the context of this sub is not the gif, it's the gif plus the doodle. The same gif with 5 different drawings would be 5 different OC posts.  This is not /r/gifs this is /r/reallifedoodles, the doodles are what makes the content, the gif it's just the excuse."
reallifedoodles,3ap0br,AvalokitesvaraMC,-6,Tue Jun 23 04:10:15 2015 UTC,"What I am saying is that introducing the source to the community is introducing new content into the community. In this case I feel that the fact that it was derived/inspired from a past popular post, it would be appropriate to cite the source, for credit, information, and link to a like post in case they liked it."

reallifedoodles,3a9jkr,PM_ME_UR_JUGZ,88,Thu Jun 18 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"Senpai is a Japanese term. Japan has a whole load of different honorifics, like we have ""mister"" and ""miss.""   Senpai is an honorific you give to someone when you're the same as him, but he's at a higher level. For example, a student who's in the year above another student is the younger student's senpai. The younger student would call the older student ""[name]-senpai.""  There's a cliche that, in Japanese media, a younger student would be in love with his/her Senpai. There's also a cliche called Tsundere, which describes a character who is in love, but hides their feelings by being mean. Also, Baka means idiot.  /r/TsundereSharks parodies Tsunderes by presenting sharks doing sharky things because they want attention from their ""Senpai."" It is a silly place."

reallifedoodles,3a9jkr,koalaondrugs,12,Thu Jun 18 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"""Drongo""  Australian slang: A ""no-hoper"" or fool. Derives from a racehorse of that name in the 1920's that never one a race out of 37 starts.   Recruits to the RAAF in WWII earned the nickname ""drongos"".   (Nothing to do with the class of bird -- drongo)  ""You've really mucked that up, ya drongo!""

reallifedoodles,39z3op,therocktdc,8,Sun Jun 21 00:33:11 2015 UTC,"The preacher is channeling the holy ghost. It can be small scale, where they lay hands on someone (to pray for them, or bless them) and the person will collapse (presumably under the effect of the spirit, although it seems more like peer pressure). Slightly larger scale is when they go to lay hands on someone and the people trying to hold them up will also fall down.  Larger scale, they will wave in a general direction and a bunch of people will go down.   This is all attributed to the holy ghost, which is 1/3 of the trinity of God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost. They believe that those are three separate entities, but are inseparable, as in you can't have one without the other."

reallifedoodles,39fnsz,LP_Sh33p,77,Thu Jun 11 13:09:07 2015 UTC,man-  there is just no escaping that shit.  even in here.
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,AddictedToFishing,23,Thu Jun 11 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"I know about the drama, but I haven't encountered any of it so far. Are people just blowing it out of proportion as per usual reddit fashion?"
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,LP_Sh33p,35,Thu Jun 11 15:43:33 2015 UTC,Did you check /r/all/? It's some pretty heavy stuff there.
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,BlckMrkt,36,Thu Jun 11 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly trying to find it. I've crafted my reddit subs to my liking, probably why I'm filtering out lowest common denominator stuff."
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,CaptHayes,40,Thu Jun 11 16:12:46 2015 UTC,Imagine if everyone did that instead of bitching about their hurt feelings.

reallifedoodles,39fnsz,xmlns,12,Fri Jun 12 01:49:06 2015 UTC,"Bullying people in /r/SuicideWatch because of their weight is a little more than 'baww cry me a river' stuff. Besides, reddit isn't obligated to give anyone a platform."
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,Patrik333,32,Fri Jun 12 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"Those other subreddits weren't removed because they weren't harassing individual people like FPH was. Also, no one has any right to free speech on a private website."
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,SimonWest,2,Thu Jun 11 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really know all of what's been going on, but    Those other subreddits weren't removed because they weren't harassing individual people like FPH was.   Well, what about FPH2 or 3, then? If users decided that in FPH2 they'd no longer harass individuals, then why should they be banned? (Not saying that they did, but if they were banned very quickly then I'm guessing they didn't even have a chance to defend themselves...)  I'm fat myself (trying to lose it...!) and I never liked FPH, but I am definitely very pro 'freedom' - sure, Reddit's a private site and at the end of the day it can do what it wants... but just banning  subreddits left and right doesn't feel right to me.   Feels like in a year's time, Reddit will have started down the road to becoming Tumblr mk.II where everything has to be as PC as can be, or it'll be silenced..."
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,phailhaus,-1,Thu Jun 11 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"There's a difference, sure, but a sub dedicated to beating women? How do you justify that!"
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,Jamesathan,7,Thu Jun 11 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"Well they're being consistent. The admins said they're banning behavior, not content. If they banned those subreddits simply for being ""distasteful"", you enter a gray area that can't be easily justified and will end up taking down subreddits that don't deserve it."
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,xmlns,-17,Thu Jun 11 20:37:24 2015 UTC,I bet you use those subreddits I listed.

reallifedoodles,39fnsz,David-Puddy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:39:27 2015 UTC,I don't think raping women or burning children is legal anywhere.
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,BlckMrkt,2,Fri Jun 12 03:09:46 2015 UTC,But talking about it is.
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,pm-me-uranus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:18:49 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I want to see what reddit wants to put on the front page. When I say ""reddit"", I mean the user base, not the admin team.  This censorship is disgusting. It's an abomination."
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,Jamesathan,5,Fri Jun 12 12:46:09 2015 UTC,What's with everyone thinking this is censorship? Did anyone actually read the articles that explained why FPH was banned?  They banned it not because of the content but because the community was linking to other subs and harassing people there. They couldn't keep the harassment going on in their subreddit contained. Imagine if one of your posts got linked into FPH and suddenly you're being followed all around reddit by a mob of angry pissants.
reallifedoodles,39fnsz,BlckMrkt,-3,Thu Jun 11 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"I probably found my way to /r/fatpeoplehate once or twice in my lifetime, if they got enough upvotes or someone linked them in a thread. But after the censorship I just started upvoting and supporting anything that was Anti pao. Like. The internet is the one place, where you can say what you want, and have it just be there. For people to see, or not see. Which is why I'm probably going to move to voat.co :D Hope to see you there."

reallifedoodles,39fnsz,Afrew,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:19:16 2015 UTC,I was lucky that I saw only one post on my front page relating to the fiasco and the comments weren't butthurt and cringeworthy.

reallifedoodles,39571u,adamdreaming,-4,Tue Jun 9 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure someone who does suffice something like this will wear appropriate safety gear. Just like that idiot who poured molten metal into a watermelon while wearing tennis shoes."

If you think molten metal is going to explode, I would choose a welding mask over plastic safety goggles.  Or I would have done the pour with a jig from a safe distance."
reallifedoodles,39571u,adamdreaming,3,Tue Jun 9 22:38:43 2015 UTC,"Nah, that's why you have someone else hold your beer first. And I know he's not alone. So many people do stuff like this, and I can't understand why they do it with no safety gear.   I don't do anything like this and wouldn't know where to start. But I know enough not to wear tennis shoes and plastic safety goggles when messing with molten metal. Also wouldn't do it on my grass."

reallifedoodles,38ssi4,UltraChilly,8,Sun Jun 7 00:47:08 2015 UTC,Wait what?! What is it?
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,Vertigo666,27,Sat Jun 6 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"Disc golf disc. Frisbee is a brand, they aren't relevant at all in disc golf. Some people can get a little snobby and turn up their noses when people say ""frisbee golf"". Personally, I say call it what you want, I just want more people out playing the sport :)"
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,cakeandpiday,14,Sat Jun 6 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"Disc golf disc   Ok, I never heard of this before but here is my opinion anyway : the first ""disc"" should be implied... I mean if you guys said ""have you seen my golf disc?"" I'm pretty sure everyone (who knows disc golf exists) would know what you're talking about.   I just want more people out playing the sport   Just don't call your golf disc a disc golf disc, thinking we'll have to call our disc that way is a huge turn off IMHO, just picture it :   Golf disc scenario :  - have you seen my golf disc? - a golf disc? what is that? - it's like a frisbee, only to play disc golf... - disc golf? that sounds (relatively) fun (compared to lame ass regular golf)    Congrats, you just enrolled a new victim in your cult :)  Disc golf disc scenario  - have you seen my disc golf disc? - are you ok? do you need some help, is there someone looking for you? - no, wait, I'm just looking for my disc golf disc... - sir, I will have to ask you to leave, I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now - please, wait, it's just, you know, a disc golf disc to play disc g- - officer, there is a maniac in the park harassing my children    Next thing you know you're shot dead by a cop, the last thing you see as your soul leaves your body is your disc golf disc that landed on dog poop. :(  Conclusion  So the real question is, do you want new friends to have fun with or do you want to die?"
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,UltraSpecial,10,Sat Jun 6 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"The simplest way: just call it a disc.  ""Have you seen my disc around? Should be left of the fairway"", ""Hey, what disc is that you're throwing? It looks really cool!"""
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,theravensrequiem,6,Sun Jun 7 02:12:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he was just trying to be helpful. Within the sport, everyone just calls it a disc. If we're talking with someone not in the sport, most of us say frisbee, because explaining what a disc is just isn't worth it."

reallifedoodles,38ssi4,Mik0n,5,Sun Jun 7 02:09:31 2015 UTC,Is it shaped the same?
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,WilhelmSchmitt,7,Sat Jun 6 18:34:40 2015 UTC,"no, not quite. disc golf disc shapes actually vary quite a bit, but in general they have a smaller diameter, more weight on the outside of the disc, and the edges on drivers are actually kind of sharp, as to cut through the air faster. you would not want to try to catch a driver. i could talk all day about how the differences in plastics, weights, and shapes of the wing affect how discs fly, its pretty cool actually."
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,rchase,8,Sat Jun 6 18:42:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, a driver. Is there also a putter-type disc, and something midrange too?"
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,LordVaako,9,Sat Jun 6 19:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, there is everything. Drivers, fairway drivers, midranges, approach discs, putters, some that are in between. They also vary in stability, so some discs are meant to turn and go right, some fly dead nuts straight, and some are designed to turn left the whole time, and everywhere in between. What he is using in the gif is probably a stable putter. When I play I carry around 20 discs."
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,rchase,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:17:23 2015 UTC,Okay.. I give up.  Please explain the virtues of the various weights and shapes of discs on the course.  I'm not being shitty... I really want to know?    Please change my view on this.
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,veryhandsome,3,Sat Jun 6 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"Well weights are pretty simple, the heavier discs will cut through wind more easily, but they require a stronger arm to throw properly. Max weight drivers are pretty uncommon just because of the perfect technique and strength needed to get the full benefit. The shapes are a whole different story though. I don't know exactly the physics, but what it comes down to is there are overstable, neutral and understable discs. overstable will tend to turn to the left (for a right hand backhand, or rhbh) much harder, whereas an understable will actually turn to the right. It's the opposite for lefties, or if you are throwing a forehand. The different shapes give it different characteristics, there are some that will turn right before turning left hard, some fly straight. There's pretty much a disc for every way you would want one to fly.  It's easy to overthink it with all the options though, in the end all you need to play for fun is a good stable driver, maybe a midrange of whatever stability you'd like, and a putter. You can get pretty good with just 3 discs, but when you get really into it you start learning exactly what you'd like out of a disc that you can't get out of what you have, and that's when the different styles start coming into play."
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,rchase,-10,Sun Jun 7 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"All of which are bullshit.  It's a fucking frisbee.  Been playing frisbee golf since 1984.. when we made up our own courses outta shit in the park.  You just throw the fucking thing at the basket.

I'm 46 years old, and I guarantee you I could beat the best of you wanker 'disc golf' morons with one single 150gram frisbee on 9 holes any day of the week.  All that being said... frisbee golf is really fun!  edit... for reference... I just shot 9 holes on my local block course with a 175gr Frisbee.. and hit 3 under... 1 Frisbee.  No ""discs"".

I'm old.  Frisbee golf will always be that to me.  And I love it.  Trademarks notwithstanding.    I sorta chaff at the idea that one needs lotsa ""discs"" to play.  1 single 150 - 175gr Frisbee or ""disc"" or your choice would be fine.  The rest of it (all this putter, driver BS) is pure wankery (and let me be clear... by wankery I mean masturbation... the British use... that hasn't gone outta style has it?)."

I started playing disc golf with just a simple frisbee, that's all I knew for a while. Now I have a bag of discs, and I have more fun with it than I did back then. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad. I just like the added skill level of using actual discs, instead of just a frisbee. I get that you like playing it your way, but don't bash other people for playing differently, the discing community is pretty friendly, so why be a jerk about it?"
reallifedoodles,38ssi4,rchase,8,Sun Jun 7 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"Shit.  I'm really sorry about that.  And you are right.  I got caught up in a personal mind-fuck.  Seriously, I was being a full-on dickweed.  And I completely apologize."

reallifedoodles,38sa48,coconut_radio,19,Sat Jun 6 11:07:01 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different ways to do it, but the general idea is to load the original gif into a program (fx Flash, Photoshop, GIMP or similar) and split it into frames. Then you paint on each individual frame, and thereby create an animation. It can take a long time depending on how many frames there are, as well as the quality of the gif (shaky gifs take longer time in my experience).  As an example, here's a 2hour timelapse of a WIP - I only managed to draw 94 frames..  I personally use GIMP because it's free to use and I have more experience with it. If you want, I can create a more in-depth guide.  Here's a video guide by /u/UltraChilly on how to make it in After Effects.  Previous threads, which might prove helpful: 1, 2, 3  Edit: I have just tried out Flash 8 for like half an hour, to see what it's like.. I can strongly recommend using that instead of GIMP!

reallifedoodles,387bsv,SacredTree,275,Tue Jun 2 11:52:08 2015 UTC,"I work on the office side of a large manufacturing plant.    Our boys out on the floor have 10 or so table saws, which are one of the more easy-to-fuck-yourself-up devices out there.    Last year the CEO replaced them with these stop saws, or as they are lovingly referred to: ""hot dog saws"".     The very next week, a young man left his thumb where it shouldn't. The blade went about 1/8 of an inch into the webbing between his thumb and index finger before the saw's emergency system kicked in and slammed the blade downward. This all but wrecks the very expensive tool and requires the expense of a small Buzz Lightyear Band-Aid® adhesive medical strip, but saves the company a ton of money on medical bills and insurance. Oh, and the kid got to keep 99.9% of his hand.  TL:DR - My CEO made that relieved hot dog ""phew"" face within a week of a very forward-thinking purchase."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,Skudworth,68,Tue Jun 2 15:04:09 2015 UTC,How does it wreck the blade though?  It's not usable anymore?
reallifedoodles,387bsv,mikachuu,248,Tue Jun 2 15:06:28 2015 UTC,"Here's a visual of the mechanism:    .gif   & gify (which do people prefer these days?)  The alluminum block stops the blade in it's tracks, but destroys it, utterly. Well worth the price, though.    And, as /u/CBruce said below, it also takes with it the aluminum block itself, "" the explosive charge used to fire it, and probably wrecking the motor and supporting structures for good measure.""    The manufacturer claims that you can replace the expended pieces, but we had to scrap the unit we ... used.    edit - how do they know to stop?     SawStop Saws Detect Contact With Skin. The blade carries a small electrical signal, which the safety system continually monitors. When skin contacts the blade, the signal changes because the human body is conductive. The change to the signal activates the safety system.     This is why less conductive material like wooden 2x4s don't trigger the system, but conductive flesh such as fingers and adorable hotdogs do."

reallifedoodles,387bsv,CBruce,5,Tue Jun 2 23:44:36 2015 UTC,This is the old version of the saw. I remember reading the newer version does not destroy the saw.

reallifedoodles,387bsv,TheTrueHaku,2,Tue Jun 2 21:12:28 2015 UTC,I believe something about the safety device basically slames into the blade stopping it and pulling it down instantly. All I remember is that either the safety device and/or the saw blade are destroyed in the process.
reallifedoodles,387bsv,PUNTS_BABIES,8,Tue Jun 2 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is a cheap saw - really only about $5000. When it goes off, it only costs about $1200 in replacement parts to get it back up and operational.  We had some of our guys try to cut aluminum with it - and since the saw works by detecting the increased conductivity of skin, the aluminum immediately set it off. Needless to say, there was a refresher training course the next day."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,twistedtactics,3,Tue Jun 2 15:11:16 2015 UTC,1/8th of an inch? I thought they were supposed to stop a little sooner than that?

reallifedoodles,387bsv,neurofluxation,8,Tue Jun 2 15:02:57 2015 UTC,WHAT THE FUCK!?!?! Did the blade go..?
reallifedoodles,387bsv,hungry-ghost,3,Tue Jun 2 13:28:35 2015 UTC,yes
reallifedoodles,387bsv,supaphly42,24,Tue Jun 2 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"Haha, love it. And Sawstops are awesome. I saw a demo where the inventor actually put his own finger through it to prove how safe it was, didn't even get a cut."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,Cheesemacher,12,Tue Jun 2 18:22:02 2015 UTC,There was one guy whose finger accidentally hit the blade. He still got a cut on his finger. But this was like 10 years ago so maybe the technology has improved.
reallifedoodles,387bsv,supaphly42,24,Tue Jun 2 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it's possible to still get a cut, it is a razor-sharp blade after all. And if you're coming in at an angle, instead of straight on, it could cut as it gets pulled down."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,PUNTS_BABIES,13,Tue Jun 2 13:51:25 2015 UTC,Would you rather have a cut on your hand/finger or lose a finger completely? I feel like I would deal with a small cut if the alternative was losing a digit.
reallifedoodles,387bsv,Cheesemacher,4,Tue Jun 2 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, of course."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,SilasTalbot,2,Tue Jun 2 15:13:32 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, let's think this one through from all angles..."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,Shaggy_One,3,Tue Jun 2 15:16:28 2015 UTC,If done fast enough you'll draw blood. Those saws go through wood like it's nothing so even if a couple of teeth it'll go in a good 1/8th.  The demos are usually done rather slowly but to get a good edge on plywood you need to go at a certain feed rate.
reallifedoodles,387bsv,Faggot_Mother_Fucker,5,Sun Jun 7 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"But he inched his finger closer and closer slowly.  Of course if he karate chopped it (would be a more realistic speed), it would probably cut 1/2"" into his hand, but of course the point of this isn't to avoid ANY cuts, but to avoid cutting all the way through."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,supaphly42,20,Wed Jun 3 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"the point of this isn't to avoid ANY cuts, but to avoid cutting all the way through   Exactly. Also, I can't say I blame him for inching it closer, I'd have a pretty hard time pushing my finger quickly into a saw blade, haha.   if he karate chopped it (would be a more realistic speed)   Have to disagree on this part. I'm not sure how you use a table saw, but it's far from karate-chop speed for everyone else. The only time it would be like that is if you're holding on to the material past the blade, and get a kick-back that pulls your hand into the blade (which is why you don't hold past the blade)."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,Faggot_Mother_Fucker,4,Tue Jun 2 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"Also, I can't say I blame him for inching it closer, I'd have a pretty hard time pushing my finger quickly into a saw blade, haha.   Well, I'm sure he's not scared of it. But it would be too much of an inconvenience getting cut. So he lets it just take a layer of skin.  Slitting your wrist is, in this day and age, pretty easy to fix if a doctor was there and had all the tools he'd need, but that doesn't mean you should be slitting your wrist willy nilly."
reallifedoodles,387bsv,tajjet,5,Tue Jun 2 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the dude who made it, but it's probably still super unnerving to put your fingers that close to a saw blade if you've used them a lot."

reallifedoodles,387bsv,SingleLensReflex,3,Sun Jun 7 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"They exist, but to my knowledge, table saws have advanced faster than gloves. So as to say it would still chop the fuck out of you unless you wear plate gauntlets"
reallifedoodles,387bsv,kintexu2,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"I've seen a hand go into it at a pretty good speed before, average for a table saw at least, and it wasn't much worse than a tiny cut. Not stitches, just a bandaid. Far less than 1/2 an inch. It's quite a wonderful saw."

reallifedoodles,37legt,legocatseyeguy,6,Thu May 28 17:37:42 2015 UTC,How do you make your great animations?  Like what program do you use?
reallifedoodles,37legt,Noroeste,8,Thu May 28 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"All you do is draw on each frame of the gif, depending on how many frames the gif has it can be quite time consuming. Any program that can take a gif and then explode it out so you can see each frame will do. I use Flash 8 because it's the program I have and I find it easy to use. Gimp and Photoshop are both usable, Gimps a bit easier than photoshop I think.   -- /u/sooperdavid   i've got a program called eximioussoft GIF creator (you can buy it here http://www.eximioussoft.com/gifcreator.htm - obviously there are other sites you download it from which will cost you less) which is pretty good for making gifs.   -- /u/sooperdavid"
reallifedoodles,37legt,legocatseyeguy,3,Thu May 28 21:49:15 2015 UTC,Thank you!
reallifedoodles,37legt,bad-r0bot,6,Thu May 28 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. I think Flash 8 is good for the animating because it has smooth lines when you draw but it isn't that good for creating the actual gif file because it ruins the quality so the eximmossoft program is good for that.  Open the gif, create a new layer over the top, draw on the first frame, move onto the next frame and then keep drawing til you've done them all.  There's loads of other programs too but flash does it best for me."

The show is cited as an early example of a popular Internet phenomenon achieving a cult following.   The action and adventure comedy is composed of simple drawings and juxtaposes cute forest animals with extreme graphic violence.  Each episode revolves around the characters enduring accidental events of bloodshed, pain, dismemberment, and/or death. At one point, the warning ""Cartoon Violence: Not recommended for small children, or big babies"" was given on the official website.   The episodes last from 1 to 7 minutes. In 2006, a television series featuring longer episodes aired. A spin-off called Ka-Pow! premiered on September 2, 2008.

reallifedoodles,37id1q,LadyLilena,24,Thu May 28 05:56:04 2015 UTC,Boobs are actually really uncomfortable trying to sleep with.  Can't sleep on your stomach without feeling like you're suffocating/crowding yourself and if you sleep on your side then they stick together.  They generate A LOT of heat and nobody wants sweaty tits.   It's kind of like putting a pillow between your knees - it's just a lot more comfortable then having your body rest against itself.

Like, someone could say what a fake movie is about and then others would create a poster based on the plot.  It could range from simple things such as ""The creature of the black lagoon, but starring a doodle instead""  All the way to, ""Sylvester Stallone teams up with the ghost of Robin Williams to take down a crime boss played by Danny Devito.""  We could call it, /r/comingtotheaters"

reallifedoodles,36z5bf,autowikibot,3,Sun May 24 01:55:40 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Mechanism of article  Diffuse axonal injury:       Unlike brain trauma that occurs due to direct impact and deformation of the brain, DAI is the result of traumatic shearing forces that occur when the head is rapidly accelerated or decelerated, as may occur in auto accidents, falls, and assaults.  It usually results from rotational forces or severe deceleration.   Vehicle accidents are the most frequent cause of DAI; it can also occur as the result of child abuse  such as in shaken baby syndrome.   The major cause of damage in DAI is the disruption of axons, the neural processes that allow one neuron to communicate with another. Tracts of axons, which appear white due to myelination, are referred to as white matter. Acceleration causes shearing injury, which refers to damage inflicted as tissue slides over other tissue. When the brain is accelerated, parts of differing densities and distances from the axis of rotation slide over one another, stretching axons that traverse junctions between areas of different density, especially at junctions between white and grey matter.  Two thirds of DAI lesions occur in areas where grey and white matter meet.      Interesting: Spectrin | Head injury | Injury | Jules Bianchi   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

reallifedoodles,36z5bf,HypeNyg,3,Sun May 24 01:56:14 2015 UTC,"This isn't at all like a car accident, the boat hitting the water is very cushioned and is more like a roller coaster than a car accident where you could go from 50 to 0 in a much faster time. The acceleration is much faster. It's found with delta velocity over time."

reallifedoodles,36z5bf,jethro96,4,Tue May 26 12:52:17 2015 UTC,"The life boat isn't supposed to flip, when the ship is at sea it sits lower in the water for more stability, so the life raft wont fall from such a height, plus when the life raft actually has people inside it is much heavier.  The way they work under normal conditions is to plunge into the water and then carve through like a dolphin, eventually pointing slightly nose up while underwater and use that buoyancy to glide up through the water and propel itself away from the stricken ship."

reallifedoodles,36z5bf,Squirrel_Whisperer,3,Sat May 23 16:22:16 2015 UTC,Going in directly means the decelerates smoothly rather than landing flat.  By flipping over it goes in directly again.  It places the least amount of forces on the body.  I doubt you would even notice you are flipping.

reallifedoodles,369oxn,jimmycigarettes,2,Sun May 17 22:57:45 2015 UTC,I haven't had PS for a while. Do you have to cut and paste each frame or can PS handle GIFs better than that.   I have Pixelmator but it doesn't do animation.
reallifedoodles,369oxn,mastertje,4,Sun May 17 23:28:39 2015 UTC,"I don't copy and paste. I open the gif in PS, expose the layers, and draw on each one. Then I select ""save for web"", click the ""animate"" box, and finish. It slows them down so you have to change the frame rate or use a gif speed-up site.  Someone mentioned that there are faster, easier programs/methods to make these, but PS is what I have, so it's what I'm using."

reallifedoodles,366bn2,penguingun,8,Sat May 16 16:22:33 2015 UTC,"I second that. I taught my mini dachshund to jump out of the door and down the one step to go out to potty, because I dislike picking him up so much (I don't want to pick him up wrong and injure his back, or grab the wrong place and get peed on). Now he tries to get out every time I go out the door. He doesn't try to take off, he just thinks he's going with me and trips me up or risks his tiny body or feet being smashed by the door if I don't see him."

reallifedoodles,365zng,ExecutiveChimp,2,Sat May 16 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"Impatiens:       Impatiens /ɪmˈpeɪʃəns/  is a genus of about 850 to 1,000 species of flowering plants, widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and the tropics. Together with Hydrocera triflora, impatiens make up the family Balsaminaceae.  Common names include impatiens, jewelweed, touch-me-not, snapweed, and, for I. walleriana in Great Britain, ""busy lizzie"", as well as, ambiguously, balsam. As a rule-of-thumb, ""jewelweed"" is used exclusively for Nearctic species, ""balsam"" is usually applied to tropical species, and ""touch-me-not"" is typically used in Europe and North America.

reallifedoodles,36038l,Sugarlips_Habasi,7,Fri May 15 20:37:11 2015 UTC,"The best way to make these gifs is using any program which can explode a gif out into multiple frames. Once youve got them split up you doodle on each frame to create the new gif (There is no real easy way to do this, it is a bit time consuming and you do have to draw on each frame) The programs we know that do this are.. Flash, Photoshop, Gimp (There's a lot more but these are the main ones people are currently using, if you have any other suggestions for programs you can use message the mods and we'll add them to this list) We will hopefully get a video tutorial or something up here soon but at the moment we do not have anything that we think is good enough.

I think it's the latter. The sped up version is likely around 24-30 fps which is gives the gif it's natural speed, your export looks like it's around 4-5 fps. It's there somewhere in your software's export settings.   Keep it up, it's great for a first try!"

From there you can separate each frame and edit it. Not sure if that helps or not but there's always Google :)

reallifedoodles,35erej,Buster_Hazelwood,12,Sat May 16 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere that since helium is very light, it eventually leaves the atmosphere and goes into space. The helium we do find these days is trapped underground (I believe), but once we expose it, it starts escaping. The US has a fairly large stockpile of the stuff, but it will eventually deplete here on earth. There seems to be many important applications for helium, since it is inert, and using it in balloons is not the best use for it.   You are right, though, as a byproduct of solar fusion, helium is very abundant in the universe, just not here on earth. I suppose once (if) we have fusion, we can begin producing the stuff for cheap..."
reallifedoodles,35erej,confused_chopstick,5,Fri May 15 12:19:12 2015 UTC,The US Congress in it's infinite wisdom decided in 1996 that the National Helium Reserve needs to be sold off and shut down by 2015 so they've been selling it off at fire sale prices for the last 10 years or so. Very soon there won't be a stockpile left. Good thing we'll have cheap party balloons for a while yet though.
reallifedoodles,35erej,tabulae,3,Fri May 15 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, the US has decided to start selling off the strategic helium reserve, which will only delay any action to drastically alter the way we waste helium.  That being said, party balloons are tiny, tiny sliver of helium use, there are applications that use a lot more and still don't recapture it."
reallifedoodles,35erej,Numendil,2,Fri May 15 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yes it's one of the most abundant elements in the universe. It just happens to mostly exist inside stars and spread out across the all of space at a few particles per kilometer. On the Earth, it's mostly extracted from natural gas and so getting rarer and at the same time it's needed more and more, as anything that needs to be supercooled, for example MRI machines, require it to work and there isn't really a good substitute. At present we're thought to run out of easily used helium in something like 50-100 years."
reallifedoodles,35erej,tabulae,0,Fri May 15 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there's no possible way of storing it for long periods of time without it escaping, including our atmosphere. How do you plan on getting all that Helium back to Earth?"

reallifedoodles,35erej,Anaxor1,2,Sun May 10 07:52:19 2015 UTC,"Oxygen by itself doesn't burn. If you think about the atoms, there's nothing that O2 can turn into except a couple of O's, which takes energy rather than releasing any. For the same reason, a fuel like pure Hydrogen gas won't burn either. It's the mixture of the two that can burn, because the formation of H2O releases more energy than it took to split the molecules you started with.  Though I kind of lied, because if you happen to be a star, you can turn O2 into all sorts of things: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen-burning_process"
reallifedoodles,35erej,oconnor663,3,Mon May 11 22:48:57 2015 UTC,"Oxygen-burning process:       The oxygen-burning process is a set of nuclear fusion reactions that take place in massive stars that have used up the lighter elements in their cores. It occurs at temperatures around 1.5×109 K / 130 keV and densities of 1010 kg/m3. The principal reactions are:      With the neon-burning process an inert core of O-Mg forms in the centre of the star. As the neon burning turns off, the core contracts and heats up to the ignition point for the oxygen burning. In about six months to one year the star consumes its oxygen, accumulating a new core rich in silicon. This core is inert because it is not hot enough for silicon burning. Once oxygen is exhausted, the core ceases producing fusion energy and contracts. This contraction heats it up to the point that the silicon-burning process ignites. Proceeding outward, there is an oxygen-burning shell, followed by the neon shell, the carbon shell, the helium shell, and the hydrogen shell.

reallifedoodles,35erej,-Daniel,2,Sat May 9 18:25:45 2015 UTC,Isn't there a difference between combustible and flammable chemically speaking? I don't know enough to comment more.
reallifedoodles,35erej,jelde,8,Sat May 9 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"Well, helium is inert because it has 8 electrons, so it can't react with  the O2 in the air, and combustion is a reaction with O2 (usually producing flame; there is no ""flame"" reaction in chemistry, only combustion)."
reallifedoodles,35erej,ReallyBigRock,7,Sat May 9 19:08:00 2015 UTC,You're right that helium is inert. But I'd consider a recount on the number of electrons.
reallifedoodles,35erej,BennyLee,2,Sat May 9 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, remembered it was a noble gas and assumed 8 valence; it has 2, but its valence shell only holds 2."
reallifedoodles,35erej,ReallyBigRock,1 point,Sun May 10 00:44:15 2015 UTC,There is not. The only difference is the speed that a substance combusts (or oxidizes).

War, murder, torture, we had it all, and I don't think we were any more messed up than other kids. So, I don't know. I can see why people would have a problem with adults encouraging children towards this type of play, but on the other, I don't think in the kids' minds it's that much of a big deal.

I assume you're either saying the abrasion of the hand can cause damage to the fish or that oils/checmicals on the hand can kill the fish. This is true with any animal (though fish are more delicate) but while delicate fish deal with abrasion from many other sources and easily handle it. As far as chemicals/oils go, most people that care/tend for fish have their hands in the tank at some point and know what to do before doing so (rinse hands, no soap, don't have stuff on them, etc).   I realize that I'm making an over reaction about the ""other animals too"" but seriously, there are a LOT of fish that don't mind human/animal contact and it doesn't cause them any harm."

reallifedoodles,32tdq1,Puckingtin,6,Thu Apr 16 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"Find gif that would look good with doodles over it.  An easy one is anything involving a moving inanimate object, since you can put arms and legs and eyes on it.  But you can get more creative than that, just channel your inner 5-year-old and use your imagination.  Use adobe flash.  Since the software costs 600 dollars or so...find, uh, your own way I suppose.  Obviously it's not hard.  The easiest thing to do with flash is frame by frame animations, which is what most content here tends to be.  Just draw on an imported gif each frame until you've drawn what you want.  Then export as a gif, post to imgur, etc. etc."

I would assume that just before this gif starts, the ball hit the wall/chair behind her and bounced back and hit her in the gluteus maximus, then fell to the ground. That may explain the surprised expression on her face. By the way, it's very common for lines judges to just barely lean out of the way when a ball is coming right at them at 120 mph. Maybe, she really does have tennis balls for testees."

reallifedoodles,32m9q3,matt01ss,4,Thu Apr 30 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, I don't know if you're familiar with Blender, but here's the setup. The materials are set to shadeless (i.e. they are never in shadow), and it's rendered against a green background. This is a sample frame. Then, using this (probably very inefficient) setup, it removes all the green, then layers it over the corresponding frame from the gif"

reallifedoodles,32di8y,Saint947,8,Mon Apr 13 06:21:20 2015 UTC,Tank of mercury...  made me pucker a little.   How rare/valuable is mercury...
reallifedoodles,32di8y,jchabotte,12,Mon Apr 13 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"Not very valuable at all. In fact, as it's so poisonous and it was used to be used a lot more in the past, if you have the correct environmental permits you can get paid for removing it.  In general, you shouldn't try to get any. Mercury vapors are seriously bad for your health, and fascination with mercury has claimed the sanity or lives of a lot of people in the past.  If playing around with liquid shiny metals interests you, try gallium instead. It's a lot less poisonous."
reallifedoodles,32di8y,CuriosityK,11,Tue Apr 14 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"Had a teacher in HS that said Mercury wasn't dangerous (it wouldn't absorb transdermally) and handled it freely just to show us.  Yeah, he died less than 5 years later."

I'll stick with Gif like everyone else :p  PS : I was in the bus when I wrote that so I couldn't go into details. I actually thought really hard about how I should pronounce Gif since Steve Wilhite said it should be Jif. It's hard to change a 20 year old habit and it's even harder when everyone you know uses the ""old"" way. Also, I found that almost everytime I said ""jif"" only few people got it and I had to repeat or even explain I was talking about Gifs. So my ultimate conclusion about this is I will continue with Gif (as in Guitar) until someone eventually asks me to explain what I'm talking about, then I'll know times have changed ;)"

reallifedoodles,32dmnh,PTomCruiser1,41,Sun Apr 12 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"All you do is draw on each frame of the gif, depending on how many frames the gif has it can be quite time consuming. Any program that can take a gif and then explode it out so you can see each frame will do. I use Flash 8 because it's the program I have and I find it easy to use. Gimp and Photoshop are both usable, Gimps a bit easier than photoshop I think."
reallifedoodles,32dmnh,sooperdavid,11,Sun Apr 12 23:02:57 2015 UTC,"All you do is draw on each frame of the gif (...) I use Flash 8    Wait, are you telling us you're not using tweens and animation capabilities of Flash?  edit : please note although I used Flash in the past, I never tried to open a gif in it and therefore have no idea how it's presented and maybe it's not as straightforward as I think it is"
reallifedoodles,32dmnh,UltraChilly,12,Sun Apr 12 23:20:38 2015 UTC,No tweens. I think you could probably use them but the things in the gifs generally dont move in straight motions so its easier just to draw frame by frame.
reallifedoodles,32dmnh,sooperdavid,2,Sun Apr 12 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"You click ""import"" and select gif.  It separates the gif into keyframes.  You can then draw layers over them.  Very simple.  You can certainly use tweens, but usually, like sooperdavid said, frame by frame just much easier for most gifs.  Like, I just did one with a moving jellyfish in -- the eyes were moving back and forth with the water, and the jellyfish were spinning in 3d...it was much easier just to draw the eyes where they looked like they should go in each frame."

reallifedoodles,32dmnh,GalacticCow,8,Mon Apr 13 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"Funny I was just about to ask the same question.  A while ago I tried using Photoshop, painting with the brush over every frame but it was super long and tiresome so I gave up in the middle of the process.  I was thinking about using after effects and vector paths but it feels like cheating.   Thinking about it, it probably has to be the one or the other but I wanted to know for sure...  edit : who in his right mind would draw over hundreds of frames to edit a gif? it has to be the second method   second edit : I was wrong it seems :p"

reallifedoodles,2wrkb6,Sneaton13,6,Sun Feb 22 23:41:04 2015 UTC,The GIMP can do animated Gifs (might need an extension?).  http://www.gimp.org/downloads/  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimpextensions/
reallifedoodles,2wrkb6,ultra242,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:49:36 2015 UTC,I think Photoshop is pretty good for this kind of video editing. It can import video and then you add layers over it and these doodles would be dead easy to draw.   Then output the video and convert to gif using some utility.   Edit: CS5 and CS6 do video editing. I don't think earlier versions can.

reallifedoodles,2u4hc2,mrfebrezeman360,2,Thu Jan 29 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks! Once upon a time I had an idea to do a whole bunch of these. My friend would do photos and I would mess with them afterwards. I first draw on paper rough pencil sketch, than do a fine detailed version with sharpies on top of it...scan it, color in photoshop. Than there is a lot of tweaking in photoshop with colors and tones, shadows...to make the whole thing more believable."

reallifedoodles,2ttn2l,taranig,6,Wed Jan 28 06:02:20 2015 UTC,"They owned it first.  Since they torn down that home can we now fully claim ""The 12th Man""?  Origin   The tradition of the Twelfth Man was born on the second of January 1922, when an underdog Aggie team was playing Centre College, then the nation's top ranked team. As the hard fought game wore on, and the Aggies dug deeply into their limited reserves, Coach Dana X. Bible remembered a squad man who was not in uniform. He had been up in the press box helping reporters identify players. His name was E. King Gill, and was a former football player who was only playing basketball. Gill was called from the stands, suited up, and stood ready throughout the rest of the game, which A&M finally won 22-14. When the game ended, E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, ""I wish I could say that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me.""   The dispute resolved   COLLEGE STATION, Tex. -- The fight over the ""12th Man"" is over and both Texas A&M University and the Seattle Seahawks will be able to use the phrase.  The university and the Seahawks said Monday they had reached a deal settling the university's lawsuit over the phrase reserved for fans.  As part of the agreement, the Seahawks acknowledge Texas A&M's ownership rights of the trademarked phrase. However, the NFL team may continue using it under license. Neither side admitted any fault or liability.  ""Our fans won't notice any changes in what we do,"" Seahawks chief executive officer Tod Leiweke said at team headquarters in Kirkland, Wash. ""They won't see any changes in the stadium. We are really happy about that.""  The only change the Seahawks will make is on any broadcasts that feature the 12th Man. A statement that the 12th Man is a trademark of Texas A&M University will be included on such broadcasts."
