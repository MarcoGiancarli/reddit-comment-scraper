glassheads,3dumwc,dracanius,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:42 2015 UTC,Also my preferred salt and alcohol method also uses rubberbands and seran wrap.

glassheads,3droui,staypadded,7,Sat Jul 18 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"From Banjo's IG post:   This piece is an exploration and a statement on the concept of seeking enlightenment and visionary experience through external means. There has been an ongoing debate stretching back at least to the 1960's on whether psychedelics can be of true aid in spiritual awakening and meditation practice. (The artists responsible for this sculpture all say ""of course they can"" for what it's worth)🙌🌈😀 The issue gets sticky when we fondly remember ""those times when I tripped my face off and suddenly EVERYTHING made sense and I was soaring effortlessly through the celestial heavenly realms and MAN I'd really LOVE to experience that again!!!!  The habit of ""clinging"" to the memory of such peak experiences can sometimes stand in the way of appreciating the wonder and beauty of the present, non drug enhanced moment. At the same time, for many of us, it is these very peak experiences that can break through our conditioned mental fog and help us to appreciate the beauty of the present moment in the first place! Can we find a balance between ""learning to open the doors ourselves"" and ""actively blasting them off the hinges?"" And then, by acts of our will alone, can we ""keep them open?"" In this piece, Freija's visions are as real as the mechanical device (connected to her eye goggles) through which they are actualized- much like the visions provoked by external means like psychedelics. It's nice to know what's out there (or in here) - regardless of the means by which we reach it. In the words of the late, great Alan Watts: ""when you get the message, hang up the phone"" And let's add to that: ""don't be afraid to call again."" 😜"""

glassheads,3dv873,KushAlien,2,Sun Jul 19 21:13:27 2015 UTC,Mood mats have some cool sacred geometry designs and they're a lot more durable than a mouse pad.

glassheads,3dgd08,bheath825,6,Thu Jul 16 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"the fact that this comment is getting downvoted signifies how uneducated and narrow-minded the average person on this sub is... a piece can be appreciated due to its design (including craftsmanship and efficiency in production) and function as well, colored or not"
glassheads,3dgd08,mrebb,2,Thu Jul 16 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"They pump these out on a lathe there is a good design and quality to it but not much else. All I'm saying is a heady piece has more of a personal touch to it other than just clear glass. A heady to me is more intricate techniques like wig wags, disk flips so on and so forth. I agree that the quality by mothership is heady status though.. nice piece overall though."

glassheads,3demjv,nakdamink,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:49 2015 UTC,Hes been blowing glass for over a decade but more recently he's been known for his ray guns and cacti work.  Fair to say his heady minitubes arent seen as often nowdays
glassheads,3demjv,rastapasta808,3,Wed Jul 15 23:35:21 2015 UTC,I'm aware of his current work and have a ray gun. I also have a piece from his weapons of glass series I bought in 08.  I would never refer to my roo or burtoni tubes as rare simply because the artist has transitioned to other shapes. Darby has pumped a lot of art out over the years and has been accused of having his assistants blow all his production work.
glassheads,3demjv,nakdamink,-1,Thu Jul 16 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"You try to find another dichro Aqua azul, threr pillar vac stack neck section Darby beaker with dark accents of black plum, if I remember correctly it's a retired color.   Darby does a lot of unique pieces but compared to his normal style, this is pretty different.   I mean, also, it's rare because it's not for sale, you can't buy it and it's one of a kind so??  http://i.imgur.com/5AhiEPv.png  Forgive me it's actually a 2011 http://i.imgur.com/jv1QzaY.png  http://i.imgur.com/wzauRRj.png  http://i.imgur.com/psa76yj.png  M"
glassheads,3demjv,nakdamink,2,Thu Jul 16 04:44:57 2015 UTC,"So I'm going to follow your line of logic for a cheap $5 spoon I bought in ~2000 from an snodgrass apprentice.   It's blown with retired colors and disco in it.  It has a shape radically different from current snodgrass shop  It's not for sale  It's one of a kind.  It's a decade plus older.   Is it rare? Not at all. It's a cheap spoon I keep around because it was my first.  Your metric for what makes a piece rare seems off to me... Every single piece in my collection meets your requirement, most every post on this forum meets that criteria.   Not trying to be super elitist about it even though that's likely how I come off. I'm just saying, we're dealing with art. Everything is one off and can be considered rare.   Also mind if I continue this discussion and ask the sub at large what they think makes a piece rare? Because it's an interesting line to draw with glass and I don't have a good answer to it."
glassheads,3demjv,The_DarkOne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:28:39 2015 UTC,"I beleive the challenege is ""rare"" and ""worth"" are being looked at as paralell concepts. A piece can be super rare, but int he Market Place not recognized as such with a huge price tag. Its interesting you bring up Snodgrass. I love his work, have a few Top hat bubblers and side car by Bob himself that I got for surprisingly reasonable prices many moons ago. I saw almost an identical Snodgrass Sidecar at a high end store in Chicago recently, and also at different outlets through the years. I don't think its super rare, but the price was quite ambitious lol.  My point is, the market value at any given time and the rarity of the piece are often mutually exclusive concepts, not inter dependent."
glassheads,3demjv,pokeyjones,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"All I meant by saying ""rare"" Darby beaker was that it's unique compared to your standard Darby tube.  Yeah, your five dollar spoon is rare bc there's only one like it, but no one wants your spoon. No one would seek out your spoon specifically to try to purchase it.   I'm not tryin to be a dick either but seems like you're really looking to far into it. And for a guy who makes prodo lines of his work, I'm guessing he's not gonna make a lot more pieces like this in the near future unless it's a custom order"
glassheads,3demjv,nakdamink,0,Thu Jul 16 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're splitting hairs, do you like the piece? Would you smoke out of it? Is it cooler than your Darby beaker? Oh okay."

glassheads,3derhg,genENTics,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:11:54 2015 UTC,Not really I basically form a gather on the color rod push in with the graphite pad or paddle heat and roll where u just flattened it then cold seal a clear rod on the front and go back to the rod  form another gather a down a little from ur last one and repeat. The saddle forms it's self and you don't have to put O rings on. Personally for 9/16 and bigger I'll use golden gate tubing but that's just me

glassheads,3d3hdh,Logan_Devereaux,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:41:38 2015 UTC,"heat red hot then drop in water, have seen quite a few people do it and seems to do the job"
glassheads,3d3hdh,montydabs,0,Mon Jul 13 07:52:14 2015 UTC,"You don't want it to be 'clean' in the sense that it looks like when you got it. There is supposed to be a seasoning layer built up over time that allows the oil to vaporize correctly. Unless you're talking about actual black ash buildup, which should be easy to scrape off with a dabber."
glassheads,3d3hdh,CreeperDays,2,Mon Jul 13 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"I thought this same thing for a long time but its actually not entirely true. My friend is conducting the experiment with fresh quartz, a Honey Hole and a QCB. If you take low low temp dabs, you can wipe the oil thats left over that doesnt get vaped and with a little torching it will come almost perfectly clean and if you keep with it after every dab, its amazing how clean they stay. Since everything that gets you medicated boils at like 380F~ your not really wasting anything in that sense, what you wipe off is the other terpenes that have higher boiling points. Quartz only gets that frosty look from the burnt left over carbon, the coloration does nothing to help aid in your dabs."
glassheads,3d3hdh,paperclouds412,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I dunno, I think there's a strong possibility the puddle left over when you do a low temp dab is oil that didn't have enough time to fully vaporize and thus became decarbed.  and I may be wrong, but it sure seems my banger works better now that i've put 2 grams through it than it did when I first got it.   I dunno man, it's all anecdotal."
glassheads,3d3hdh,CreeperDays,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:23:57 2015 UTC,I scraped mine pretty hard and there still seems to be a little black coating that won't come off toward the edges of the bucket. I may just be new to Quartz but it seems I'm wasting a lot with the dabs I'm taking but it won't come any cleaner. Been torching for 12 waiting 25
glassheads,3d3hdh,Enterice,3,Mon Jul 13 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Don't just wait 25 you're prolly letting it chill way too much as ten probably isn't enough heat, get the bottom just starting to turn red, cut the heat, wait about ten then go, then keep playing with different times, experiment and learn your quartz, you'll inevitably waste a few dabs on too hot or too cold quartz."
glassheads,3d3hdh,paperclouds412,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"I normally torch my QCB to the point that everything black has been burned off, the bottom of half of the bucket is glowing and then wait 30 seconds. I'd rather heat it a little longer and wait a little longer, to me it's easier to get the timing down. I also hold my hand over the banger as well, you can normally feel when the temp drops off enough for a low temp. Those are just my methods, they are by no means the only way but I've dialed in low temps on all my domeless nails that way."
glassheads,3d3hdh,Enterice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much the method I've seen everyone narrow it down to, most ppl just use the hand to feel the temp, but it'll still take you awhile to figure what the right temp feels like"
glassheads,3d3hdh,paperclouds412,2,Tue Jul 14 18:08:22 2015 UTC,No doubt I think the learning curve with low temp dabs discourages some people but it's well worth it.
glassheads,3d3hdh,CreeperDays,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"I would try not waiting so long after torching it to take your dab. Try and get it to the point where the oil melts for long enough for you to carb the banger, but not for so long that it just puddles up. I wasted probably a half gram just getting the feel for the temperature on my banger. Keep trying, i think you'll find the sweet spot."

glassheads,3cy9j3,benthejammin,2,Sun Jul 12 00:17:15 2015 UTC,"It's uneven. I think it might be intentional though, to go with whole waxy theme going on.   I don't mind worked glass being uneven. But tubes need to have as little warp as possible to them. This is purely a matter of preference for me, I don't think it actually hinders smoking enjoyment.   Even so I'm a big fan of pieces that do amber colors and bees."
glassheads,3cy9j3,Antilogic81,2,Sun Jul 12 03:15:10 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate? The can of the tube is intentionally carved to resemble a beehive and match the other smaller sculpted beehives in the set.

I don't know how to describe that, but if you've seen a lot of glass you know what I'm talking about.  All I'm after is maybe an artist or company who makes (or at one time) made these.  And also the video is a few years old and on YouTube to boot, so getting a straight answer that way is almost unfeasible."
glassheads,3ccu1o,grumpysquare,2,Mon Jul 6 23:51:03 2015 UTC,Don't know what to tell you mate. Find someone local or on /r/lampwork who might be able to make you one. If it is a 1/1 piece from seven years ago you likely wont find an artists name attached. TAG and Grav Labs made/make prodo versions that are fairly small and non-diffused.

glassheads,3c8j07,NeverInformed,3,Mon Jul 6 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"that's just the uptake part of the recycler, Quave, aka: Kevin, (althought not the first to design this, just first to put them in production) designed the Return part of the recycle, simply, on the outside of the piece. THIS is an original mothership klien design. See, not even an outside Uptake tube like yours, but the term Klien refers to the part of the glass that simply comes out at the bottom to return the water back down. Most people/shops get confused, and/or just want to make a sale and call it a klien. What you have is a badass recycler. Pyrology makes mainly all recyclers. They don't call theirs kleins just cause it recycles, the term is only coined by that one kid who in turn, everyone is now replicating. Stupid little dumb details, but just thought I'd give you some insight"
glassheads,3c8j07,mastererrl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:41:54 2015 UTC,So a Klein is just the straight circle recycler as seen in the photo? I have a rig that has a recycler like that MS but I don't know whether to call it a Klein or a recycler haha
glassheads,3c8j07,nigepz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"Klein:  the tube that comes OUT of the bottom of the pipe, for the Return of the water. Just the bottom part. If it just recycles up and back down within the pipe, thats just a recycler, if the return goes from inside to outside to back in.. like the tube on the bottom shows, then its a Klein"

glassheads,3bo746,ambivilant,2,Tue Jun 30 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"Are you worries at all about the thermal expansion/contraction of the ceramic on the joint?  I know a lot of people, including myself, have had issues with ceramic nails getting stuck on or in the joints because the material would expand and contract with heat.  I know most if the heat won't hit the joint but after a night of heavy dabbing it may be a concern"
glassheads,3bo746,rastapasta808,3,Wed Jul 1 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried, the heat from the swing shouldn't transfer too much to the joint of the bucket because its not in direct contact. It would definitely be less so than a ceramic domeless"

glassheads,3bo746,UnluckyWizard,5,Wed Jul 1 00:08:11 2015 UTC,Ofz = Optimal Flavor Zone (as far as I know)  Its a type of carb cap used with honeybuckets ( the bowls with quartz swings attached to them) that creates an optimal temperature inside the that vaporizes the oil at the lowest temperature possible through pressure and convection.

They're an online retailer imo and head shops refer to a physical location, not a concept.  But kids now days may see it differently.  I go online to avoid the bullshit that I have to deal with at headshops.  (Workers treating every customer as if they're an idiot until proven otherwise, ridiculously marked up prices, paying for their overhead, annoying 'salesmen', and pressure to buy)  I only go into stores for emergencies or to test out and feel new products before buying.

The light refracts in a weird angle so when you point it at the nail it could be measuring the temperature of something completely different.   Enails don't even give accurate temps, the coil is heated to your desired temp but the nail isn't going to be exactly 710, or whatever degrees you set it at."

glassheads,3bpd0a,TroubleInMyMind,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:11:07 2015 UTC,"For wax probably a titanium nail with the necessary accessories (torch, dab tool and some kind of cap - which is usually on the other end of the dab tool). Personally I use a 10mm quartz banger (I have a smaller rig, you will probably need a 16mm or 18mm for that rig). Quartz low temp dabs are the best IMO - but a banger and quartz or glass dab tool will set you back about $100-150 for a nice set. Cheaper for generic sets. Titanium set will go anywhere from $40-100 for a nice set, depending on name brand and style."
glassheads,3bpd0a,CaliNole,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:00:19 2015 UTC,"Do not use a titanium nail without an adapter, male jointed Ti nails are easiest way to break your joint. Titanium absorbs heat much faster then boro does, that's why we stopped selling them at the shop I work at."

That's how a lot of art and other luxury items are - they aren't practical nor are they intended to be. Do you similarly object to the price tag on Eusheen's pieces or do you simply not value this piece at $20k based on your preference of style?

Eusheen has some really nice looking stuff, though."

glassheads,3b8ehs,yeradolt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:33:39 2015 UTC,I've seen them as low as 1400 retail and as high as 40k for the tricerotops. I'd say the average lies around 1600.

glassheads,3b7595,rastapasta808,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Looks like a type of recycler that functions similar to a Bates x Worm diffusion pump.  I could be wrong but my guess is that you fill water up past where the downstem connects to the clear tube.  Water and vapor are drawn up the clear tube just like a straw sipping the last few sips out of a cup, a straight slurp.  Once the water goes into the first shake, it flows down to the bottom shake (like an incycler) as the vapor continues up the mouthpiece.  Just a guess tho"

glassheads,3b9luc,RobTheThrone,3,Sat Jun 27 02:42:36 2015 UTC,"With all those filters and ashcatchers, etc. I was thinking this was going to be used for flower.  For oil, honestly, the smaller the better as well as less percs. The smoke gets diffused less, meaning you get the most flavor and the smoke also covers a short surface area instead of a whole ashcatcher > carbonfilter > bong before you actually inhale the smoke.  Wax generally doesn't have a lot of resin like you're used to with flower so you don't have to worry about a lot of reclaim build up unless you don't clean it often."
glassheads,3b9luc,Cannaclysm,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"It's going to be used for vaping, dabs, and flower. I'm just not sure what to use for what."
glassheads,3b9luc,rastapasta808,2,Sat Jun 27 04:51:30 2015 UTC,"Never use the same piece for dabbing and flower unless all you're concerned about is getting high.  The flower will make your dabs taste like shit and you will lose majority of your dabs to the piece because there is way too much filtration.  To make this more clear, the tube itself is way too big for dabbing because you will develop polka-dots of reclaim all up and down the piece which is a HUGE waste.  What's your total budget?"
glassheads,3b9luc,Cannaclysm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:19:26 2015 UTC,Well now that I know a little bit more I'm just going to use my MFLB Orbiter for dabs. The bong is going to be used for flower and vaping.
glassheads,3b9luc,rastapasta808,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:34:34 2015 UTC,Also what would you recommend as far as cleaning tools for that piece? I have some gunk off I think it's called but I was wondering what I should use as far as utensils to scrub it good.
glassheads,3b9luc,hailmax,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:56:10 2015 UTC,Usually soaking it hot water with a mixture of cleaning solution like Formula 420 should do the trick.  Or even 91% ISO with some salt works as well.
glassheads,3b9luc,grumpysquare,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:54:56 2015 UTC,All 'glass cleaners' are complete gimmicks.  Use the highest % of iso you can find (90%+) and let it soak for an hour or two.  Then throw in Epsom salt as an abrasive to get the large chunks off.

glassheads,3b9luc,snobord,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:43:46 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you planning to have on it at once? What's your ultimate goal here? That's a ton of shit to be combining. With a carbon filter and an ashcatcher on a honeycomb bong it's gonna be extremely draggy let alone with some kind of dropdown.   Consider simplifying, start with just the tube and one simple accessory. Add pieces as you see it necessary."
glassheads,3b9luc,snobord,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:59:00 2015 UTC,Well I really want the carbon filter/ashcatcher combo. I'm just not sure if attaching the dabs adapter and the dome to it will make the bowl sit too high.
glassheads,3b9luc,rastapasta808,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:03:40 2015 UTC,"You don't need or want either of those to convert to an oil setup. It should be fine with the M/M adapter. If you stack the carbon deal on the ashcatcher it's going to be an extra six inches of glass, that's getting up there as far as height is concerned."
glassheads,3b9luc,mr_lemonpie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:08:46 2015 UTC,You don't want to use an ash catcher or a carbon filter for dabs.
glassheads,3b9luc,luseferr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:43:40 2015 UTC,Why not?
glassheads,3b9luc,luseferr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:08:44 2015 UTC,You don't want to over filter your dabs and they both add unnecessary filtering and drag (esp the carbon filter). They both work great for flowers (esp the carbon) but they're not for dabs.
glassheads,3b9luc,mr_lemonpie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:39:40 2015 UTC,Don't get the carbon filter.  Those things are so goddamn shitty and the only people who use them are high schoolers who think they're filtering out cancer from weed smoke.
glassheads,3b9luc,UseMeAsBaitPlease,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah every part of this would make a terrible oil piece. It is too big, honeycombs are too much diffusion etc. Get everything you have there except the drop down, adapter, and dome set and you have a really decent big flower setup, then just buy a separate rig, something small, recyclers are super hot right now, maybe one with a disk perk or even just a natural perk works really well for concentrates."

AK is obviously bipolar. you're right. i've heard how childish he can be from a few other people as well, but for real, to come at me like that over an opinion? its just not necessary as the entire face of his own brand. i don't respect it.   people are trying to tell me in this thread that my egg looks janky. i'm a pretty objective person and i just cant see what they see. i cant see anything out of shape/out of place and i've seen many, many eggs (and owned three myself). i'm not bent out of shape over it, everyone has their opinions y'know?"

glassheads,3as78r,hasn0life420,3,Tue Jun 23 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"The starting blank is double layered, with solid teal over the murrine tubing on the one on the right. Then Ryan places freehand masks over it and then sandblasts down to the layers below, all done after the shaping is complete.  For the one on the left the center section is four layers - black, dark blue, light blue, and the lime green. He progressively blasts his way through each one. Incredibly time consuming and unforgiving of errors.  The copper sections are electroforming adding at the very end. A solution is painted onto the piece and then is dipped in an electrolytic bath where copper attachs itself to the piece where the solution is painted."

glassheads,3auo3j,mrebb,6,Tue Jun 23 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"Its because in the video, the scene was like a child.  Innocent, full of wonder, and just developing the language to communicate the art they were trying to create.  Now we are in the teenage years.  Big egos, people trying their hardest to show off, and more wannabes than there are pieces.  We are watching what happens when an entire industry no longer needs to hide in the shadows of the law and what happens when youngsters frame their personalities around glass and dabs."

It just seems sad to me that this piece with so many hours devoted to make a beautiful functional pipe hasn't been christened with some sweet green.

Anyway I'm looking for someone to make a bulk order of fairly basic glass dabbers. Not all clear, maybe a few different color variations, but nothing to fancy is needed as I'm looking to keep the cost per price relatively low. The only specification is that the round ball on the top of the dabber needs to be between 1/4"" and  a 1/2"". I live in the midwest, and saw that you prefer dabbers and pendants to make, so I thought I'd give you a shout. Let me know what you could do for bulk orders. Would like at least 100 pieces for first order, if the projects I'm doing with them go well, I would order more. I can be reached by email but I'd rather not post it here. If you know how to message someone on this site please message me, haha. Thanks again!"

glassheads,3a8wtz,prisonsurhome,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"I think im pretty much done.  i could maybe put where a good place to buy american glass is, but i wouldnt want to lean in any market's favor (i sell on etsy but i am amonst resellers hense the inspiration for this.) I cant think of a good way to inform people where to shop, unless i listed individual headshops that ive visited that have great integrety. I think i should emphasize certain things like the sweatshop cruelty thing, but the facts are there for everything. There could be a sweatshop pic that was a good idea. Maybe it could say that you may be surpised by how thick, interesting, and american the import glass looks sometimes because they basically only steal designs to try to make whats popular. i cant talk about dishonesty or stealing designs because americans sometimes to that too. It would be cool if it was a square so it could easily be shared on instagram, since thats what is hot now. It should definately elaborate on what ""value"" is: even though it might cost a little more to buy it most likely costs A LOT more to manufacture the american one than the import. Obviously it should label which one is the import and which one is the american one better. Last night i was so tired i edited ""an original"" to ""a original"" for some reason haha.

It's almost like a botched reticello that you decided to wrap n' rake combined with a clean incalmo stack. I think if you keep refining this technique and work on cleaning up the tube/mouthpiece sections shaping, and maybe try laying down the color with thinner/thicker stringers to see how the pattern comes out with different diameters?

If you know a flame worker or glass worker I suggest you ask them to fire the piece and re-anneal it. I.e load into an annealer or kiln and bring it to 1000F allowing it to completely burn anything on the glass. Organic materials will gas off and will leave white dusty carbon that could be easier clean with alcohol and coarse salt. Unfortunately I've found that some stuff is rather stubborn and will outlast all efforts, such as mineral deposits from using hard water during long term functional use. Real elbow grease is require to buff hard water deposits off glass."

glassheads,3a2dv0,xandarrr,2,Tue Jun 16 20:04:16 2015 UTC,To remove these hard water stains I would give it a soak in something like CLR or some other product designed for the task.

glassheads,3a2dv0,panicogen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:35:44 2015 UTC,Bloom refers to quartz. What you are talking about is hard water build up.
glassheads,3a2dv0,panicogen,2,Tue Jun 16 21:42:07 2015 UTC,I've always seen the hard water deposit rings on pieces referred to as bloom. I figure hard water stains are like the hazy film left on the glass. But bloom describes the ring around the piece. Thanks.
glassheads,3a2dv0,panicogen,3,Wed Jun 17 03:58:13 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/Ju5v1AD  These are some practice quave club bangers I made. See the white ring at the base of the bend? That is the bloom I am talking about. Quartz get vaporized when melting it and the vapor deposits on anything colder. the more you melt quartz, the worse the bloom will be. Use hydrofluoric acid and flame polish it to get it off.  But yeah bloom this bloom that. Jargon jargon jargon. I am just showing ya :)"
glassheads,3a2dv0,panicogen,0,Wed Jun 17 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"Those rings are exactly what I have on my piece, no hazy films or anything. Just a single ring around the chamber. I guess I got to get my hands on some hydrofluoric acid then :) Thanks!"
glassheads,3a2dv0,KDAB_OilSlick,2,Wed Jun 17 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"Well that is borosilicate glass, not quartz. I would not suggest getting Hydrofluoric. It is super dangerous, you need ventilation or you will die using it. Also HF can eat away at borosilicate glass if left in there too long!   Don't get HF, get a new glass piece and use distilled water ONLY with it. Problem solved.   Also, distilled vinegar, oxyclean, and salt can help get the stains off. I had similar issues years ago and was able to get a little off with that stuff."

glassheads,39zckr,Itza420,0,Tue Jun 16 07:51:28 2015 UTC,preference nuff said................. i like grommy more then i do glass on glass and they dont use actual grommets anymore the use clear silicon tape and just wrap around the 10mm female joint in a tapered fashion and in my opinion i think the xtra section glass blowers have to use for the glass on glass joint clashes with the peice more then if they were to just poke a whole in it and make it a grommy but in the end its apples to oranges which do u like better?
glassheads,39zckr,Itza420,0,Tue Jun 16 09:11:52 2015 UTC,They use tape?  So eventually its adhesive will fail and you'll have to replace it. Silicone is definitely preferable to rubber though.   I'm a handmade worked GonG joint kind of guy. Handmade joints are basically holes poked in the tube like you would with grommets except they're sized perfectly so you don't need other materials.
glassheads,39zckr,Itza420,0,Wed Jun 17 06:17:35 2015 UTC,they tape has no adhesive properties it only sticks to itself wen you wrap it and even with handground glass joints glassblowers have to use that extra section i was talking about i own many glass on glass tubes too but i hate em and there all handworked too its just  prefrence u think this is better i think this is better its all opinion if i wanted i could use the same tape for a grommy for like 3 yrs but i dont need to cuz a single roll of the tape is only $7 bucks and itll last forever not to mention $7 aint shit when im spending hundreds on peice

glassheads,39zckr,Itza420,-4,Thu Jun 18 14:13:33 2015 UTC,lmfao they look cleaner because they dont have to add an extra section for the glass on glass joint so the bowl is in a better more preffred position its alll preferance really i hate how most glassblowers glass on glass joints look and the make the bowl closer to your face i honestly love the concept of grommy tubes much better then glass on glass its all preferance

glassheads,39v3ht,DabbieDavis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand that BC is one of the best glass shops in the entire nation man. I've worked in a few shops and been around the country. BC smoke shop gives illusions a run for it's money in a smaller form. I can't believe you say austin shops are the worst, they are some of the best in Texas if not the country. There isn't a single shop in boulder that is nicer IMO."

glassheads,39thmb,mastererrl,2,Sun Jun 14 18:19:25 2015 UTC,I fucking love hand made joints on rigs. looks so much nicer on a heady piece than a ground joint
glassheads,39thmb,BordahPatrol,2,Sun Jun 14 23:00:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, but ground joints do serve a purpose. I don't know how many people know it, but when you rotate a bowl in a stem, the 'grit' interlocks, and makes it harder to pull the bowl out. When you twist it the opposite way, it releases and it's pretty cool.  That said, if you could get a sick heady design to still look great and be ground, I'd be about it. I'm sure it's been done."
glassheads,39thmb,mastererrl,2,Sun Jun 14 23:04:27 2015 UTC,"For flower, absolutely. Just prefer the hand made ones for oil rigs because of them actually releasing easier on the dome since it claims up. I can see wanting it to stick with flower bowls though"

glassheads,39g5ku,grumpy_gardner,9,Thu Jun 11 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"The joint weld looks heavy and ugly to be honest. And the proportions for the munny are way off. The thing about munnys is they are a template for an artist to put their spin on. The dimension and proportions are extremely important as they are the foundation of creativity in this piece. Thats the whole point of the blank vinyl movement in general. To give everyone the same exact canvas to start with, and letting the artists imagination determine the extent of the piece. If every munny sold by kid robot was slightly different, it would detract from the initial point.    Overall its a nice looking piece. I was a personal friend with coyle when he first started his munny project out of Elbo's moms garage. He made 200 dry munnys before he even sold his first one, just so he could honor kid robot properly by making sure the original template wasn't lost. It takes making a lot of these to get them perfect, and you are on the right path.    Overall 6.5/10"
glassheads,39g5ku,Hereforthefreecake,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:12:10 2015 UTC,why didn't his have a tail then lol
glassheads,39g5ku,Yobi_Fox,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that the joint weld could be more elegant, but I think the shape of the munny is fine. I get that it's not quite what it looks like, but it's glass blowing, it's a difficult process. It's not as easy as a machine making them from premade molds. You're right in that they are supposed to allow an artist to create their own spin, well I think completely transposing the idea with new materials/medium is an excellent spin."
glassheads,39g5ku,Hereforthefreecake,2,Fri Jun 12 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"As a glassblower, that just seems like an excuse. And he wanted feedback. That joint weld doesn't need to be ""more elegant"" It needs to be properly working in so that when its flashed with heat it doesnt crack and explode. Structurally it isn't sound, which isn't OK if the intentions are to sell the piece. This just looks like an exploitation piece taking advantage of a market created and abandoned by another artist more than it looks like an attempt to create well constructed glass mirroring the intentions of the original munny. It screams ""pay me, its a munny"" more than it says ""I wan't to be apart of the munny movement"". He asked for feed back. I gave him mine. If you don't like it, thats fine. But thats how I feel about it as a vinyl collector and a glass blower."

glassheads,39g5ku,Graxxon,3,Thu Jun 11 16:01:54 2015 UTC,I like the color and sandblasted sections but IMO i would try to refrain from the basic munny and try making your own unique design to seperate you from the pack. There is many a munny maker out there now. Happy melting keep on raging!!
glassheads,39g5ku,shma1214,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"i agree, munnys are played out, but a very good tool to see where you are in your shaping skills."

My eyes get ""bored"" quickly while looking at the piece, if that makes any sense. Perhaps more geometry and lines, but subtle ones that help tie the current ones together, kinda reminiscent of spidey's suit but not. I think using a slightly brighter color might help too. Maybe make the sacred geometry panes larger?"

glassheads,39bgf5,gingerzuela,9,Wed Jun 10 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"Quartz bangers. This would be an excellent carb cap dabber. Dab then flip to cover the opening, restrict air flow, and help vape the rest of the oil on low temperatures"
glassheads,39bgf5,WINSTON913,5,Wed Jun 10 21:17:24 2015 UTC,Wut. This is English?   (I guess it's obvious I'm here for glass art.)
glassheads,39bgf5,finnerpeace,3,Wed Jun 10 22:29:59 2015 UTC,With butane hash oil you have to vape it off of a hot surface. Quartz has a very dense cellular structure so it is resistant to cracks and breaks when heated. A quartz banger is essentially a bucket with a hole to funnel vapor into the rig. When you hit it at lower temperatures to be nice to your lungs and get optimal flavor quality some of it might not vaporize unless you have something to cover the bucket (carb cap) to trap in excess heat and finish vaporizing all the oil. The dabber is the tool used to put the oil into the banger
glassheads,39bgf5,WINSTON913,8,Wed Jun 10 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"some of it might not vaporize unless you have something to cover the bucket (carb cap) to trap in excess heat and finish vaporizing all the oil.   The carb cap isn't to trap heat so much as to create an atmospheric vacuum around your dab, thereby lowering the temperature required to vape the oil."

glassheads,39bgf5,librarotron,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:52:14 2015 UTC,Idk It restricts all the air flow which causes oil to run down your bangers hole its better to have a small hole to prevent that so it dosent work like a straw

glassheads,396r4g,wardy24,3,Wed Jun 10 00:12:16 2015 UTC,doubt basic colors go for 2k or 3k my lhs marleys tobacco is about to drop 10 of them and i asked the owners and they said they start at around 1200
glassheads,396r4g,KushAlien,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"Yea that seems more understandable. Like I said before, they used to be 333,then a few years back he brought it up to 666 then it was 777, i do think some people will pay 2-3 k for the basic colors, because there's enough hype behind the artist."
glassheads,396r4g,wardy24,2,Wed Jun 10 00:23:07 2015 UTC,"definitely, those teleporter keys are the most over hyped thing ive ever seen though people paying 300 bucks for a piece of glass that is stamped and has a loop thrown on it. #hypetrain"
glassheads,396r4g,KushAlien,3,Wed Jun 10 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"Right?! And everytime I talk about how hype it is I get hated on. I respect shelbo and all he does, but that shit just isn't for me. Some people sadly even buy just to sell. It's fucked"
glassheads,396r4g,wardy24,2,Wed Jun 10 00:40:24 2015 UTC,yea dude usually its the people who just hopped on the hypetrain that get butthurt when you throw down some real facts but its because they dont understand the work that really goes into the glass. glass flippers are a big problem but its easy to see why they do it my lhs had a coldberger hotdog pendy going for 80 bucks shes coyles apprentice and shes blowing up hard right now doing collabs and shit that same 80 dollar pendant will be 250 bucks maybe more in like 6 months so i get why the hoard shit to flip but its grime as fuck because they dont really care about it.
glassheads,396r4g,sparta436,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That's my big issue. I collect because I love the art and respect the artist. Flippers buy for gallery price, then within a week they got it up for auction starting at 4 times what they got it for. It's just sad. I'm not knocking the artists that this happens to, because the work that goes into it is monumental. It's just the dudes lookin to make a quick buck off the people that respect the art hurts the scene"
glassheads,396r4g,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:07:44 2015 UTC,"Right but in the secondhand market they are worth far more, similar to ships. Some glass blowers have a knack for creating a tulip economy when they hit it big."
glassheads,396r4g,Penaliah,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"Tulip mania:       Tulip mania or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed.   At the peak of tulip mania, in March 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble),  although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit episode in 1619–22, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble.  The term ""tulip mania"" is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble (when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values).   The 1637 event was popularized in 1841 by the book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by British journalist Charles Mackay. According to Mackay, at one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper augustus bulb.  Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.      Image i - A tulip, known as ""the Viceroy"" (viseroij), displayed in the 1637 Dutch catalog 'Verzameling van een Meenigte Tulipaanen'. Its bulb cost between 3,000 and 4,150 guilders (florins) depending on size (aase). A skilled craftsman at the time earned about 300 guilders a year.

glassheads,3989rj,plzthrowawaygarbage,3,Tue Jun 9 23:42:16 2015 UTC,You've got barely any reclaim in there bud! Also reclaim is just a natural occurrence from dabbing. There's no way to stop it lol if you don't like how it looks just clean your piece.
glassheads,3989rj,Oakmaster815,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:04:02 2015 UTC,yeah but like it gets so gooky sometimes the downstem gets entierly clogged and if u pull it gets no air you have to pull harder and harder unill it pulls out and you get splashed by water whats the fix? clean often?
glassheads,3989rj,montydabs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"just clean it man, throw some ISO in there shake it up for a bit and rinse with hot water. Only real way to clean it with out running any risk of damaging the glass. But if you want to save the reclaim and smoke it or make edibles out of it, use Everclear or another food grade ethanol. DO NOT do it with ISO though, ISO is denatured and you DO NOT want to ingest it, contains poisons and other chemicals"
glassheads,3989rj,Ent-Turner,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:51:53 2015 UTC,If mine gets clogged I put it in the over on 200 for a short period of time and it works great.   Also i don't think this is really the place for this question. More for showing off your heady glass.  I belive /r/cannabisextracts would be a better spot
glassheads,3989rj,blakegrows,3,Wed Jun 10 12:11:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the design of domeless nails like that, as I tend to think it allows for more of the dab to be sucked into the downstem. I prefer the type with the single hole raised in the middle."
glassheads,3989rj,aaronisafalcomain,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:40:05 2015 UTC,Regularly clean your piece with Grunge Off. That shit works miracles
glassheads,3989rj,paperclouds412,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:37:16 2015 UTC,Tons of reclaim.  Haha. Warm water doesn't clog as quickly also.
glassheads,3989rj,greasemonkey710,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:28:54 2015 UTC,"what claim? lol but if you're worried about the ""waste"" aspect, something a lot of people don't think about is water temp. colder water, more claim, less dabs for you."
glassheads,3989rj,JacksonGuitars420,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"totally normal, however your nails prone to it due to the inlet holes being so close to the dabbing surface. the second that stuff liquifies and you start inhaling then that oil travels inside and down through the nail. there it sets up on the wall and is a perfect place for passing vapor to cling onto, to keep growing.  try a quartz banger or a domeless styled like the duality by highly educated titanium, they definitely build up claim slower than some of the other nails ive used(at least oil in the downstem claim.)  also iso wash your rig and evaporate off the iso and you got decarbed oil ready to ingest, or go on for further processing. i recently took a flight to england after eating 5 grams of our reclaim and it was a good 36 hour body buzz, no wasting there lol."
glassheads,3989rj,Sleep_Tight,2,Thu Jun 11 14:01:22 2015 UTC,thanks this is the most helpful reply yet thanks so much.
glassheads,3989rj,thankyouforpotsmokin,2,Thu Jun 11 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"I can confirm. My first nail was a honey hole, and I found that with a good sized dab, most of it would be running down the side of my rig, not even vaporized. I switched to a Quartz banger and have never looked back."
glassheads,3989rj,shitcock55,0,Fri Jun 19 16:38:24 2015 UTC,Get a drop down dude. Something like this   http://aqualabtechnologies.com/glass-accessories-1/drop-down-adapters.html  It works like an ash catcher but for reclaim.

glassheads,393arj,grumpysquare,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"Man, his errlocks have such great aesthetics. Should be tasty rippers from the looks of it, unfortunately never tried one. Unless you're looking for more than basic diffusion either option should make a great choice."
glassheads,393arj,grumpysquare,0,Mon Jun 8 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed on aesthetics. I would make the same assumption about flavor what with the apparent small volume.  I have a mad rob nano that is tiny w. simple diffusion and my larger rig (Toro) also with pretty simple diffusion.   Part of me is debating getting an amazing flower piece since I have multiple simple rigs that hit great. Another part of me thinks a nicer rig will just be cooler and more fun to use socially, especially in CO."
glassheads,393arj,a_head_with_wings,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"Tough choice, admittedly I'd go for the errlock before a sick flower piece, color>clear. What Toro are you rocking? Midsized double cans slay for some flower, I've been loving the mini circ-circ."
glassheads,393arj,TwStDoNe,-1,Mon Jun 8 23:52:16 2015 UTC,Not sure what Toro it is but I think that is more or less the style of perc. It's great for flower but gets dirty super quick. Actually gonna clean out a small bowl for it now and rip some lemon jeffrey.   http://i.imgur.com/4MPw6vL.jpg  That's a picture of my nano with the Toro in the background. You can (kind of) seek the perc and probably get a relative idea of size.
glassheads,393arj,Kouen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:58:21 2015 UTC,i think they're awesome and i love his shaping. i've always been a giant fan of sherlocks and his errlocks are the most clever way i've seen the shape incorporated into a rig. you can never go wrong with a two hole perc and reduced mouthpiece. it's sure to be a nice hitting flavor saver  only thing is they look much nicer if you don't use a domeless. if you're like me and still like using your matching domes it's perfect though
glassheads,393arj,Kouen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:29:59 2015 UTC,Unless you can get that dino for around 1500 id stay away only because there are more of those dinos then when they actually exsisted

glassheads,393arj,ggghhhhhh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, just look around and don't follow the crowd (i.e buying a dino because he discontinued the line and everyones scrambling for them). Find glass that inspires you to pick it up every day and go ""wow""."
glassheads,393arj,ggghhhhhh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:08:06 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the Elbo's are cool as shit, but they aren't exactly unique or fresh anymore, I could be WAY off (please, tell me if I am), but they seem to be fairly similar from piece to piece. If I was dropping 1500 or whatever and wasn't aiming for flower (Hellllooo, Sovereignty), I would much rather have something with amazing linework, perhaps--I'm not a HUGE Errlock fan, but I'd rather that then a dino."
glassheads,393arj,ggghhhhhh,0,Wed Jun 10 07:41:31 2015 UTC,Yeah my only incentive to get a dino is they hit amazingly and I've wanted one since they were slightly more rare.   I kind of wanted an AK minitube but from what I hear that dude is kind of a dickhead.
glassheads,393arj,LiftedJosh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"Krunks are more in the 10k plus range, no? I'm sure Dinos hit amazingly well, but there's a looooottt of glass out there that rips real well for much cheaper. I mean, I know it's an ENTIRELY different level of work, but look at a guy like Nectar of the Goats, making those dope ass banger rigs for around $600...I can't even imagine what kind of custom piece he would do for a little under $2k."
glassheads,393arj,pabra001,0,Wed Jun 10 18:40:25 2015 UTC,Yeah the AK would require another year or 18 months of me holding off on getting a piece. Also the idea of hitting something regularly that's work 12-15k still seems silly to me.

glassheads,38rw7j,Frompy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:48:15 2015 UTC,That's a gorgeous color.  Is there a reason they haven't used those colors with boro sooner?  And do you know anything about the chemistry behind the effect?
glassheads,38rw7j,Frompy,3,Sun Jun 7 00:19:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know the chemistry behind these colors, eventually the metals used gets out but for the most part they try to keep this stuff secretive.   Boro takes more heat to melt, the metals added in glass can only take so much heat before they start to fade, lose stability, bubble, or devit. In softglass the palette is much larger because the glass moves at a lower temperature, so they can have a lot more delicate metals that would burn out before boro got to moving temperature.  Boro glass color is a baby, for example Glass alchemy is established in 2000. Also it costs more to produce boro color, so the R&D is very expensive also slows down production from the backorders in this massively booming industry."

Hell, my local installed the $50 sheet for like $5 when I took the window to them.  Maybe they have scraps for cheap.  Thrift stores: look for stained glass, weird stuff from the bric-a-brac, stuff next to the ashtrays.  Hell, give some scraps of glass to the lampworker and have 'em warp the scrap in different ways... even have a kiln right there to anneal it.  You're going to need a ""day off boro"" day though, soda glass anneals at a much lower temp than boro."

glassheads,37t3p1,mrebb,2,Sun May 31 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"the possiblilties open up when you're objective is to find a meaningful piece instead of something that is only a $ sign to be flipped for a profit... and yea i'd get something like this its 1100 but fuck it if he's buying a 1000$ bong he shouldn't be worried about an extra bill. or he could save 200$ and get a dope filla tube here, for someone who has such an impressive collection i would expect you to have better suggestions than a barely worked devol tube, not talking shit but really? lol"
glassheads,37t3p1,K_sKyWIper,0,Sun May 31 03:42:55 2015 UTC,on the real your tube is fucking godly
glassheads,37t3p1,K_sKyWIper,0,Sun May 31 03:44:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest I barely tried, it was the best I could do given pretty much no criteria. There's a lot of stuff I would buy for $1000 but yeah op didn't tell us much so he/she is getting that in return"
glassheads,37t3p1,mrebb,-6,Sun May 31 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"also just a reminder, 1k alone isnt gonna get you anything new by a big name artist. if its baller status its gonna cost over 1.5k"
glassheads,37t3p1,Oakmaster815,4,Sat May 30 05:38:14 2015 UTC,Not if you take your time and search for a snag.
glassheads,37t3p1,Quats,-1,Sat May 30 05:43:51 2015 UTC,"Obviously, but does that sound like the type of plan OP is capable of performing? I mean he came here to ask strangers what he should spend $1000 on. if he knew where to look for a proper deal he wouldnt be here."

glassheads,37m610,nakdamink,2,Sun May 31 22:07:40 2015 UTC,I have a custom amber sidecar recycler that I got from Rad Brad.  He made an amber skillet swing to match it.  The finished product came out more beautiful that I could've ever imagined.  It hits super smooth and the marble work is fantastic; it is truly one of a kind.
glassheads,37m610,GGnerd,2,Thu May 28 18:55:45 2015 UTC,My favorite tube ever is the Opas fade to clear once owned by ninja on TC but has since seemed to disappear.   My favorite piece is either my HMK or my mike fro hammer.  Both just have amazing flow and flavor.

glassheads,37m610,mrebb,1 point,Fri May 29 05:50:12 2015 UTC,wow awesome! can i get a function video. Want to know how it works lol
glassheads,37m610,WaxBully,4,Fri May 29 19:56:59 2015 UTC,If there's one thing ive learned from collecting its that for most higher end buyers function is valued way less than form. As the concentrate market rolls in 1-3 hole stems are totally adequate for percolation allowing artists to focus more on the aesthetics. Personally im a fan of sculpting and old italian techniques like zanfirico and millefiori. But theres so many styles out there and to each their own. If you search for instagram in this sub you can find a list of almost all big names. Check them out and see what you fancy. Just dont buy anything marked up because of bake ons i.e. slumgold or sokol. Such brands will not likely hold value long
glassheads,37m610,mrebb,2,Fri May 29 20:12:51 2015 UTC,I like my krunks the most. You should buy a krunk.

glassheads,37f2dv,rastapasta808,4,Wed May 27 04:33:38 2015 UTC,he said he ran into banjo CHECKING punty in at the airport in the title...
glassheads,37f2dv,K_sKyWIper,3,Wed May 27 16:39:26 2015 UTC,Lol or he meant he saw banjo checking the years salary in his hands.
glassheads,37f2dv,Nbk420,-1,Wed May 27 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"No he didnt.  The title says:   ran into Banjo checking in this guy at the airport.   He didn't say ""punty"" in the title fool.

I understand the convenience of using Imgur.... But Instagram is the primary ""portfolio"" for glass artists... Direct linking to their instagram is a great  way to promote them, get more fans, and learn more about the artist through their little bio and other works... Why the hate?"
glassheads,3757ut,BANGcake,1 point,Wed May 27 14:41:38 2015 UTC,"Because of the self-promotion aspect. Some people, like me, are turned off when they feel like they're being advertised to.

glassheads,3739x4,thelousveryown,2,Sun May 24 18:23:46 2015 UTC,What did you pay if you don't mind me asking?
glassheads,374ovk,ShatteredThrone,2,Sun May 24 21:15:07 2015 UTC,Because stem 12's are usually triple bore. It's been ages since I was really into sovereignty but that's my guess. I don't even remember if double bore stem 12's exist.
glassheads,374ovk,mrebb,2,Sun May 24 21:51:13 2015 UTC,I dont believe Ive ever seen any double bore stem 12s. Thought they were always triple. 4k seems a little steep though for a stem12
glassheads,374ovk,Stoned4days,1 point,Tue May 26 05:53:31 2015 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance.  Is bore how big around or how thick?  Triple bore = king, double = queen ?"
glassheads,374ovk,mrebb,2,Sun May 24 22:44:21 2015 UTC,It's the tube diameter. The newer stem 8's are double bore meaning the stemline and 8 arm have the same bore but the neck is a different bore (diameter)
glassheads,374ovk,zeewubs,2,Mon May 25 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"While the stem12s are triple bore, the bigger factor in market value is the rarity of the stem12s. Sov doesn't generally produce stem12s on the regular. Also, all the stem12s I've seen have been worked collabs. I'm sure Steve's done solo stem12s, but I just haven't seen them.  When you're talking low-volume, ""hetti"" glass that is aimed mainly at the enthusiastic collectors, that's why you find the stem12s are so much more. I am very unlearned about glassblowing, but I'd also imagine that the difference in difficulty of an 8-arm tree vs. a 12-arm tree is negligible. I know Toro uses jigs to make their tree percs, so if Sov does anything like that, it's no harder to make.   I missed the ""clear"" qualifier at first - I don't know for sure what the Royal Stem12 (http://i.imgur.com/VSaENSN.jpg) went for, but the Mini Pillar from that set sold for around $5k. I would have guessed the Royal/SG Stem12 probably went for around 8-10k. I would never have guessed to hear of a clear stem12 going for 4 large, haha."

Also it doesn't reduce reclaim either, the best way to do that is to reduce the inside surface of the glass that touches vapor."

glassheads,36nuzf,defaultfox,1 point,Thu May 21 07:37:54 2015 UTC,"I think that it's for no splash with low volume and it has bit of extra aeration and cooler smoke, from having contact with the water more often, that ads to the flavor. I have seen a few of these in person and they usually need to be filled above the halfway mark on the fab egg portion for the recycler to even function. There's just too much flow through egg for the water to go to the recycler... But they are pretty."

I have a double mac to 8 arm (this) and I love it for concentrates. Really comes down to what you want though, I think most of the toros, except maybe the large tubes, would  funtion fairly well for dabbing, you just wouldn't get as much flavor out of the bigger ones.

If you think a peice of glass is beautiful and a lot of thought and work went into it, call it heady. Anyone who calls you out, doesn't understand the concept of beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   As an artist I see most creations as art. And that makes the whole world heady for me.

I think knockoffs on someone's absolute creative property, shelbo esqe goblins, is a terrible trait of capitalism leaking into our beautiful industry.   The first thing I asked myself when seeing this is if it was genuine. No doubt some glassblowers can copy very well, and obviously there skill is somewhat comparable to shelbos, however shelbo took years defining that symbolic head. And most goblins in collections were gifts out of respect.   The fact that artists wouldn't sell there shelbo goblin made the value skyrocket. Everyone wanted one and he simply couldn't meet the demand. He drove his proce up because that's what you do in that situation when your years of work has finally been recognized and too many ppl want your product. He's the only one who makes them. He doesn't have a team busting out mothership or toro like production. He's one man. And his work and legacy demands a good price.   Imagine someone trying to be identical to your visual creative baby, just for profit, when for YEARS you barely got recognized let alone paid.   I would be sour only because I hate ppl who throw morals out the window for profit. They are not being creative, they're thieves. And ppl shouldn't buy it cause it's 25% of the originals price. But they will. And those ppl won't be respected because they own a goblin head by some asswipe and got it for 300$ when shelbo didn't even get that much when he first was making them.   Sorry. I personally know a lot of these artists who get knocked off for profit including shelbo and they really just wish ppl would create their own goblin head or just genuinely create instead of stepping on toes to get to that profit margin quickly."
glassheads,3682bd,chakaglass,1 point,Sun May 17 12:58:51 2015 UTC,Well said my friend.
glassheads,3682bd,rhullphoto,5,Sun May 17 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"""goblins"" as created by Shelbo are a gift to the world. They wouldn't exist without him taking his journey in lampworking. Therefore people copying him would have nothing to copy in the first place if he hadn't spent years evolving his hands to the medium and growing his style. To copy this over and over at an undercut price is being opportunistic and not artistic.   Maybe shelbo isn't scared of properly valuing all that work and the originality of his design. Maybe we live in a world where not everyone can have one because he can't make enough, and thats ok, because its truly a special and unique piece of glass art. Thats the value of such an object and I'm glad he exists because he used passion to create those, and people with passion deliver art, people who just want that paycheck would never deliver a gift like the goblin, because making glass goblins doesn't pay the bills until you've been doing it for years and have built a following. Lucky for all these copycats they can just jump on shelbos shoulders and put in zero creative effort. smh. just my 2 cents."

glassheads,362qpg,Inventite,2,Sat May 16 05:37:09 2015 UTC,"You don't need to advertise or show an enail. But by having a fixed bucket, you limit the options to quartz swing or ti swing.

As a glassblower myself, in both the hot shop and on the torch, I really like DCN's work.   Saying it's ""easier to use"" is ignorant, both mediums have so many similarities; (afaik) you keep the piece wet to keep it malleable, like you keep glass hot, it being made on a lap wheel is the same thing as using a lathe.. it takes time and skill to make the pieces he makes, not to mention he's the first. (bongs weren't originally made out of glass, I guess that's not original or creative..)  Starting materials might be cheaper but once your work is valued high enough, it becomes negligible anyway; he still had to buy a kiln though which is one of the most expensive 'tools' for glass as well. Some paintings are valued so much higher than this functional art, and I guarantee materials his pieces use cost more than some paint.  Anyway, glad to see this here, glad you like it."

glassheads,360ia2,thelogicofpi,2,Fri May 15 15:47:27 2015 UTC,when porcelain is thrown thin enough it can be translucent. But not transparent.
glassheads,360ia2,chezzy79,1 point,Fri May 15 16:52:39 2015 UTC,Honestly these ceramic rigs shouldn't cost nearly as much as glass... talk about hype
glassheads,360ia2,Duh_Dernals,4,Fri May 15 02:02:15 2015 UTC,He was selling them a few months ago for like $200-350.
glassheads,360ia2,thelogicofpi,2,Fri May 15 13:48:58 2015 UTC,supply and demand. He got recognition and the support of the whole glass side of the industry so the prices kind of inflated to that market.
glassheads,360ia2,manning55,1 point,Fri May 15 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely is hype, but you gotta admit it's different and no one else is doin it yet. I do love the way it hits tho, and the taste is definitely different than a regular rig."

glassheads,360ia2,panicogen,0,Fri May 15 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, DCN quoted me $400-$700 for one of his rigs. No way they're worth that much. Not trying to dis his work, because it is nice, but you're paying for the hype."
glassheads,360ia2,pochopz,2,Fri May 15 05:08:51 2015 UTC,might be a similar phenomenon as to how coffee and most acidic drinks taste better out of porcelain. I think it has to do with it removing the extra hydrogen bonds from the acidic chemicals thereby neutralizing them.
glassheads,360ia2,akro25,0,Fri May 15 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"Doing the exact same thing with a less-suitable, easier-to-use medium as one would do with boro isn't original or creative... and you wouldn't want your rig to alter the taste of your dab anyways.  I doubt that graze would look good after a few years of use and cleaning, I would much rather get something like this for a similar price"
glassheads,360ia2,akro25,3,Fri May 15 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"It doesnt alter the taste in a bad way I taste nothing but the dab, and its still art and something I was fond of. I don't see the color fading much because it does have a finish over it."

glassheads,35z9iy,thedirtydabber710,1 point,Fri May 15 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"That all has to do with the application that your going to use after it. Doing these wigwags hollow, I knew I wanted to make hollow pendants and using a solid wigwag would be a bit harder to connect nicely, not to mention the weight that it would add. As for implosions i usually stick with how just because from the way I work, it's easier for me."

glassheads,35xsma,gbreadflowers,2,Thu May 14 21:31:31 2015 UTC,10mm minitubes with a 2 hole diffuser is the best possible flavor in my opinion. A quartz banger or HE nail is a must though. They both hold heat  pretty well. I prefer a banger because with them the joint is farther away from the heat. LIttle rigs and big globs are the way to go homeboy.
glassheads,35xsma,kidtrex,1 point,Wed May 20 17:08:48 2015 UTC,I dont own anything over 8in and a majority of my glass is 10mil. I like smaller pieces and prefer either a 10mil cfab or quave banger or the little 10mik HE flux. 10mil isnt too small but like others have said if the diffy/perc wasnt cut/made big enough it may clog quicker than one might like
glassheads,35xsma,Stoned4days,1 point,Thu May 14 14:51:40 2015 UTC,Just make sure it has a good pull when you water test it. Nails can be tricky for fittings and for larger dabs.  I have a 10mm greenflash that gets clogged within 1-2 weeks with regular use because the holes on the percs are very small. But i also have a heady little Gomez and it chuggs with just a two hole downstem!
glassheads,35xsma,thedirtydabber710,1 point,Thu May 14 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about 'claim, you really should avoid dabs. Small rigs mean conservation of your wax. Big rigs force waste. Wax isn't exactly like weed; the stuff that remains (all of it) should be going to whomever is taking   the dab. The smaller the piece, the more you are receiving per dab (it sounds counterintuitive when compared to bongs and the like but trust me, bud - that is the way of the dab). Find a 10mm that makes you happy. Get a decent recycler or hit me up and I'll make one for you. I have a 10mm Slymecycler that's prepped out and ready for assembly. Just need to get released from the hospital so I can get it finished."
glassheads,35xsma,ArrdenGarden,1 point,Thu May 14 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at some small pieces for regular use. I've heard that 10mm is great for flavor and it has little reclaim compared to bigger rigs. I'd mostly be using it for single dabs so I think it might be fine but I don't want to get a rig that is ""too small"" to take occasional slabs**"
glassheads,35xsma,thedirtydabber710,1 point,Thu May 14 12:19:58 2015 UTC,"If you're dabbing from a 10 mm regularly, you may want to consider buying a dropdown."
glassheads,35xsma,WINSTON913,1 point,Thu May 14 15:58:01 2015 UTC,Just make sure the holes on your downstem are cut well. Smaller pieces can have trouble clogging up if the cuts aren't big enough. If you're dabbing more than like 0.05g per dab you'll have a hard time finding a nail to get it all also.
glassheads,35xsma,Frompy,1 point,Thu May 14 13:30:09 2015 UTC,I love 10mm rigs but hate the nail selection for them. The Highly Educated Flux 10mm is the best nail I have found for 10mm. I prefer Quartz though so I use an Earl Jr Quartz 10mm domeless nail.

glassheads,35xsma,ryguy0492,0,Thu May 14 14:45:41 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be too small. Just get a knock-off quartz club banger for 20 bucks and it should be large enough to hold any and all Slabs.

glassheads,35v1pt,GandGsmokeshop,3,Wed May 13 20:17:35 2015 UTC,"Yes that little black lip on the side is the carb. And thank you I am loving this piece so far. This is the first custom heady piece I've ever owned, and while in honesty it doesn't compare to a lot of the stuff I see on this sub,I still marvel looking at it."
glassheads,35v1pt,rhullphoto,2,Wed May 13 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"Jahnny is a personal friend of my mentor and from what I hear a great dude and awesome glass artist. Be proud friend. This is for sure a nice scoop.   Heady is a unmeasurable adjective. Like beautiful. It's in the eye of the beholder. Just cause the price tag doesn't scare you doesn't mean it's not heady. Typically if a peice isn't production made and one of hundreds it's considered heady. But this is not a rule as I work with BTGB and he's made hundreds of production mastershake rigs that look the same, and they're still considered heady."

glassheads,35v1pt,HoneyErrl,2,Wed May 13 22:01:45 2015 UTC,It is unique I even listed the artist's name in the title. As for it having to be a masterpiece of art to be considered heady I don't think that's true. I know it's not a masterpiece but it is still very nice nonetheless and it is my first heady piece and I was excited about it and wanted to share it.

glassheads,35w5sr,Masked_Majora,2,Thu May 14 05:17:29 2015 UTC,Why is the downstem like that?
glassheads,35w5sr,pacifica333,2,Thu May 14 06:43:56 2015 UTC,"This was originally a piece of scientific glass manufactured by Kimax.  It wasn't made for smoking.    The downstem is a product of the way the hole was in the original piece.  I want the exact piece because this thing was the best bong I ever owned.  The smoke rose completely level, like rising water, and it was amazingly smooth.  EDIT: Here is what it looked like after it broke twice and I fixed it.  First break was around the narrow part by the base, second was about half way up, at which point I added more tentacles going all the way to the top; http://imgur.com/a/NqYdq"

glassheads,35rkam,TurboGlass,15,Tue May 12 22:39:04 2015 UTC,Only complaint is that I'd make the dabber horn a little longer and more straight sideways to better break dabs off with. I feel like as is it'd be a bitch to get a dab out of a container with that.
glassheads,35rkam,GraysonTheBassist,3,Tue May 12 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've definitely struggled with silicone containers in the past with some of the shorter ones like these. I do notice a trend back towards parchment paper though in which case the lower profile ones tend to not be a problem. The constructive criticism is appreciated though, I'll definitely be making some on the shorter end and some longer than I have in order to accomodate people who would prefer to use containers! Thanks!"

glassheads,35rkam,paperclouds412,10,Wed May 13 00:22:29 2015 UTC,Since its glass as long as it doesn't exactly conform to what it's being placed over it will still allow air to flow. I've seen lots of glass carbs that don't have holes.

glassheads,35rkam,spiderholmes,1 point,Wed May 13 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Right, but you do want it to restrict airflow upstream of your dab."

glassheads,35q6ri,TacojohnCel,0,Thu May 14 17:17:29 2015 UTC,I don't quite understand why everyone on this thread thinks there is something so special about glass made in the US. Glass is glass and they make artistic things that look just like that in China so I'm not quite sure why you think it's so special.  I was asking a simple question and pointing something out I'm not sure why you got so rude.

glassheads,35rfd8,HolyHydroBlunts,2,Tue May 12 22:35:07 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure they do. I'd look around your area for local blowers and get in contact with them.
glassheads,35rfd8,TurboGlass,2,Tue May 12 22:38:48 2015 UTC,"Ask around the local art community. Community colleges, art centers, art walks, etc. If you find some people in the glassblowing scene (furnace work) they may be able to point you in the right direction for local flameworking. Try to find out if theres any sort of pipemaking scene, ask around local headshops. If all else fails, go to a bead store and ask if they carry any locally made glass beads. Try to get in contact with the artist if you can because while they might be soft glass (not borosilicate), 90+% of glass beads are flameworked and that will at least get you going :D Good luck!"

glassheads,35kc6k,bsim16,3,Mon May 11 04:47:56 2015 UTC,there are a few nice looking things there but the majority of the glass in that post just isn't what we like to see here. i like my well functioning production glass as much as the next smoker but it just isn't fun to look at after seeing so much of it  that chillum in the front with the disc is cool and that hammer has a nice honeycomb on it. the fumey horned double bubbler in the back actually looks very interesting as well. that layback inline bub with the reversal also looks nice as far as i can tell  if you would have included just those pieces it would have been proper but with all the prodo in the picture don't expect for this to be upvoted. i personally wouldn't mind seeing another post w/ focus on the pieces i mentioned :O)
glassheads,35kc6k,defaultfox,2,Mon May 11 06:40:25 2015 UTC,"I mean... nothing here is crazy heady, dude. Maybe that bubbler in the back-middle, left of the Liquid?

glassheads,35b9z1,99drumdude,2,Sat May 9 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"The more detailed elements need to start off rather large; I'd guess between 1.5-3"" in diameter.  I know that's a broad range, but it does depend on how you build it and how much cane you want to pull.  Speaking of which, the simpler elements (such as the white star) can be made pretty small to begin with, but the larger you make them, the more cane you'll get from one pull."

It takes away the light brown/yellow color of the ss5 and makes it more orange it seems.  New favorite yunk pendy, glad a local got it so I can check it out. Catch you on the flip side quesadilla!"
glassheads,34w6fd,Frompy,1 point,Tue May 5 22:02:37 2015 UTC,Thanks homie! Its my favorite yunk pendant too. You'll definitely see me at the next local event with it
glassheads,34w6fd,Hippyvan,1 point,Tue May 5 23:46:01 2015 UTC,Damn! That looks so sick! Please post this to /r/pendants they will probably appreciate it!

glassheads,34tror,mouseclone,1 point,Mon May 4 18:18:03 2015 UTC,Dude this is awesome! You should post this and many more of your fav pendants to /r/pendants !!

glassheads,34tl8j,McLovin_33,-3,Mon May 4 13:26:16 2015 UTC,I don't think this really fits the sub. Sure it's cool and historical and what not. But it's irrelevant to the functional glass community.
glassheads,34tl8j,smokesinquantity,1 point,Mon May 4 22:52:07 2015 UTC,It's not only about functional glass. Robert Mickelson's goblets are a common posting on this sub. http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7c/0a/94/7c0a940e591576668b6a9c0b80c91857.jpg
glassheads,34tl8j,msager12,2,Tue May 5 02:57:32 2015 UTC,But he also makes functional pieces along with Hanshaw and pendant artists. This is a randomly blown murano dish and I think it belongs in /r/glassblowing.
glassheads,34snhb,Swill311,7,Mon May 4 05:38:32 2015 UTC,SCHMITZ! I work with him you got this from my glass shop!

glassheads,34snhb,DroppinCid,6,Mon May 4 14:30:56 2015 UTC,Never thought I'd see a piece I put on that shelf on glassheads. Too cool man.
glassheads,34snhb,DroppinCid,1 point,Mon May 4 14:33:43 2015 UTC,Do you work with the glass blower or in a shop?
glassheads,34snhb,Flendoaa,5,Mon May 4 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"About a year ago I learned to work glass with Schmitz, and I have worked on and off at the shop."
glassheads,34snhb,casefromthedojo,2,Mon May 4 17:14:55 2015 UTC,This is a hot little piece....is it a recycler as well?
glassheads,34snhb,turtleneckanchain,3,Mon May 4 06:25:46 2015 UTC,"negative, looks like an 11-slit inline diffusion. very nice piece by the way, love the color on the orb thing on the top part."
glassheads,34rlga,wishful_puppeteer,4,Sun May 3 23:25:50 2015 UTC,This is beautiful. How much does this run?
glassheads,34rlga,DJQuad,0,Mon May 4 00:34:15 2015 UTC,I'd expect to pay high 4 figures or low 5 figures for something like this but I could be lowballing tbh. A lot of work went into it.
glassheads,34rlga,broff,1 point,Mon May 4 01:20:41 2015 UTC,Insane. This is motivation for me to do well on my finals and land a nice job :P. Do you know the general size of the piece?
glassheads,34rlga,DJQuad,-1,Mon May 4 01:28:58 2015 UTC,Not exactly but the center marble is probably around the size of a tennis ball
glassheads,34rlga,broff,3,Mon May 4 01:34:27 2015 UTC,Tennis ball is too big. It's about the height of a lighter.  EDIT: Forgot to mention that it is a pendant.
glassheads,34rlga,broff,0,Mon May 4 02:19:11 2015 UTC,Oh I thought it was a marble (ish thing)
glassheads,34rlga,broff,2,Mon May 4 04:47:48 2015 UTC,My bad when j looked at it earlier I thought it was a marble / paper weight / sculpture

glassheads,34rlga,grumpysquare,2,Mon May 4 04:48:30 2015 UTC,"Lovely implosion, is it just opals encased or is it other stones as well? The way the light refracts in the second picture has me a bit puzzled."
glassheads,34rlga,grumpysquare,1 point,Mon May 4 05:10:55 2015 UTC,All opals. The opals change color at different angles.
glassheads,34rlga,lmwfy,1 point,Mon May 4 00:41:21 2015 UTC,"Rad, haven't seen many that reflect that pink/gold tone before."
glassheads,34rlga,Koalchamber,1 point,Mon May 4 01:14:03 2015 UTC,that's the dichro image behind the implosion
glassheads,34rlga,Koalchamber,2,Mon May 4 01:28:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a dichro image! Sorry I thought he was referring to the smaller opals around the large one."
glassheads,34rlga,jousting_narwhals89,1 point,Mon May 4 14:44:37 2015 UTC,I thought I heard somewhere that opals are the only stone that can be encased in glass. And only lab created opals at that. I could be wrong though.
glassheads,34rlga,NeverInformed,1 point,Tue May 5 01:55:10 2015 UTC,"Synthetic Opals are generally used within the industry.   Another interesting thing used in the industry is Moldavite, which came from a meteorite impact. It can actually be fused with glass, therefore is used frequently as attachments too."
glassheads,34rlga,NeverInformed,1 point,Mon May 4 02:26:57 2015 UTC,Yeah. I have a chunk of Moldavite from china. That stuff is cool. But can it be completely covered In glass like an opal?
glassheads,34rlga,rastapasta808,1 point,Mon May 4 03:19:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure if you can. If you can do it, I'm sure it would be 100 times harder than just encasing an opal."
glassheads,34rlga,Hippyvan,2,Mon May 4 03:28:31 2015 UTC,This is an amazing  pendant.  Any custom work you wanna sell?

One of them recently posted a pic of their tube and mentioned that its one that's only broken out on special occasions.  Like the porcelain pieces Daniel Nelson does, these are a step in a new creative direction with a less common medium."
glassheads,34pay6,lmwfy,2,Sun May 3 15:13:25 2015 UTC,Redeye is a great guy and makes some of the most unique pieces in the industry.   Bought a bubbler in 2008ish off tc

glassheads,34nndd,grabbinsumpillz,2,Sun May 3 03:39:20 2015 UTC,Dab and acid? Damn dude. I can barely smoke two bowls one after another.
glassheads,34nndd,HoneyErrl,3,Sun May 3 05:01:14 2015 UTC,"It's a fantastic experience. Dabs are like blankets when your tripping sack.  They put you right in that zone of comfort and relaxation, while the acid can keep you on edge. Plus I hardly cough when I trip, so it's even more enjoyable. I definitely recommend it, but do the 2 seperately first,  even though weed is just weed, it fucks with some of my friends trips.. I swear by it though. Happy tripping in the future friend; good vibes and positivity your way."

It's mainly just a place for the 40k+ collectors who follow us on instagram so they have another option to pay for items that are sold quickly through our gallery. Send an email to galeriadelsd@gmail.com with any suggestions you may have for when we update the site later this year. We always continuously work to provide better and better service. Some things just take longer than we would like. Have an awesome weekend and thanks for the constructive criticism. We will be correcting these issues as soon as possible.

You have to either give it to the place you bought it from or find a way to get in touch with Toro directly.

Heck of a lot easier than trying to ship a piece somewhere, JP probably wont fix it because A. he's pretty busy ramping up production, and B. he doesn't need to deal with the liability of other people's dirty glass (check out the termini post a few weeks back for an example)."

glassheads,34m726,GigglesMJ,1 point,Sun May 3 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"The way your piece broke makes it difficult to repair with the original mouthpiece, there's really nothing to grab onto. You called it a clean break despite being jagged, but those uneven edges cause mountains of problems when trying to fuse tubes together.  Sorry mang, buy a new one."
glassheads,34m726,geebers7,1 point,Sun May 3 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"I dont want to re-fuse the mouthpiece,  just have someone re-lip it"
glassheads,34m726,rabbigilbert,0,Sun May 3 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"That's not a wildly different process. I concede that you could have someone fix it, but this is what you'd end up paying for:   multiple hours (including heat up and cool down) gas kiln space (the amount of space it takes up in the kiln reduces the amount of more expensive glass that could be made that day) electricity (kilns and ventilation fans are huge juice hogs) glass itself (not all of it used actually ends up in the piece, there is a consumable amount used solely for manipulation) skill (repair is it's own skill, not everyone who can make a pipe can put one back together) monotony (glassblowers generally work with glass because they enjoy it, repairs are fucking awful)   So if you really want this repaired, be willing to shell out. Repairs generally aren't for those looking for the cheaper solution, they're for people who want to save a sentimental rig. Oh and there's never a 100% guarantee that it will survive the repair, no matter how baller the glass blower."

That other guy said you could talk to Toro, but if it's 40 bucks and 4 months, personally I'd just get a new piece. You could also just use some sandpaper and shave the jagged edges down and either inhale straight out of the dulled down, shortened mouthpiece. Or, I saw someone on here make a make shift cover for a shave down bong neck, it was almost like a big dome with a hose coming out."

The Lynx center fire is perfect for beginners and the outer fire offers plenty of room to grow in to. Plus the resale value on GTT'S is fantastic so you wouldn't lose any money if you change your mind.   A Carlisle,  Bravo, and GTT all operate pretty differently though so get what you're comfortable with if you get the chance to try some out.

glassheads,34kno2,glasslife,9,Sat May 2 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot of practice to achieve good color... Anybody can do a wig wag too but if you've only been on the torch a month then your wig wag is gonna look like shit. Fuming includes a lot of variables from your flame setting, gas pressures, the way you heat your glass, the way you blow it out, the way and rate at which you condense it back down, the way you lay your dots, etc. Anybody can make a fume spoon too but a Maka B fume spoon looks 1000x better than a beginner's fume spoon.

They're fun to collect as little trinkets if nothing else."

glassheads,33yb9b,jedemon,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:08:57 2015 UTC,Anytime the smoke condenses and expands it losses energy in the form of heat that's just basic science. Fabs also reduce the volume reducing the air displacement for a more direct less airy hit. Less air displacement means more flavor.

They then heat it up and with a lot  of major skill, they stretch it out like across the whole shop and it becomes super long and skinny, retaining the image, just way smaller. Very similar to how designs in good taffy is made. Then they chip off little pieces. So after all the Millis from that series are gone, they are gone for good, you gotta make a whole nother batch. That's why some Millis are rare and expensive. The ends where they stretch it stays kinda big, and if it's a nice milli, the ends  can sell for thousands each.

glassheads,33imsv,PakuaGlass,2,Thu Apr 23 00:31:55 2015 UTC,It's more about unfair pricing competition the cheap imports bring into the equation that irritates people. They take popular rig designs and produce them at a price that no one could parallel in the states.
glassheads,33imsv,Anal_Goblin,3,Thu Apr 23 08:08:40 2015 UTC,"Also im not talking shit on heady glass made by local artists, i work at a pretty well known shop here in so cal so i get the pleasure of being able to appreciate the heady game, no doubt about that haha. You yourself make some amazing work, Pakua, that i myself would throw down money for. But guys like OP who scooped a diamond glass rig shouldnt be looked down on, even in this sub that only appreciates custom glass art... i think OP's rig is dope and he got it for what was most likely a good deal at a time when he wasnt trying to throw money down on an expensive piece. I can relate to that"

I'm not normally piece this big, but my buddy bought the first one that we got in and when I actually tried it I was really impressed since I don't normally like Hitman.

Don't buy it.  No need to hate on it.  (I post this exact phrase every time these pieces are posted lol)  All you young glassheads are spoiled brats, straight up.  Ten years ago, if this caliber of work was put out people would lose their fucking minds.  Its a new aesthetic and concept, but since it doesn't involve a glassblowing technique, people are so quick to provide overly simplified explanations on how the pieces are made and their supposed value.  Its the exact same way with people who are desensitized by porn.  After you see Tori Black, the average 6/10 may not do it for you.  Once you see a Deppe headpiece, artists like Sokol might seem mediocre at best.  (Even though most in this sub can't afford either)  Moral of the story: understand where the glass game has cone from and where it stands today to gain a true appreciation for the American boro scene."
glassheads,33e755,rastapasta808,12,Wed Apr 22 02:22:17 2015 UTC,"Bruh it's because those artists can do better, they sold out. Their new lines are fine but it's frustrating when you look at how good their older work is"
glassheads,33e755,mrebb,8,Wed Apr 22 02:27:32 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree but we also gotta consider their side.  There are more than a few glass artists who didn't expect the success they've attained.  And there are also some glass artists who are successful but have lost the love for glassblowing that started them on their journey.  A lot of people now days seem to put big name artists up on a pedastal and are disappointed if their expectations arent met or surpassed.  Fact of the matter is some glass artists are businessmen first, and artists second.  They are concerned about the bottom line: profit.  Aaron Sokol turned himself from an artist into a brand name.  If he puts his name on a piece, it will more than likely sell.  So consider his point of view.  He could either bust ass behind a torch all day long making headies or he could production line that shit and just watch the cash roll in.  Yea its a shitty aspect of this industry but its a necessary one.  Prodo is where we all began, but now there's at least shit that's nice to look at.  And a lot of people don't want to step out of that honeymoon mindset they view glass with because you see that its not all hugs and kisses and some people are out there to hustle, not to spread their love and art.  I get that people are entitled to their opinions, but I don't think that gives everyone and their mom a free pass to hate.  Sorry for the rant, its not directed at you.  I just wanted to throw it out there for anyone to read and marinate on."

glassheads,33e755,grumpysquare,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with what you are saying. And I can't say that I wouldn't do the same thing if I were in their position. JAG is another artist who still creates awesome sculptures and can still blow my mind with his work on a regular basis. I just get frustrated with Sokol because I haven't really seen him do much of anything other than his bake on labels.   Like I said, I would probably do the same though, were I in his position. It just bothers me that he thinks he is an A+++ class artist, and he acts like it. I'm sure he could be too if he pushed his work a few levels higher."
glassheads,33e755,IVXXLLC,5,Wed Apr 22 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. JAG is a perfect example of this. Look at the things he used to make, his sculptures were absolutely incredible, and awe inspiring. The fact that an artist can have such an insane talent for lamp working, but limit themselves to basic shapes with transparent colors with random bake on labels is frustrating to say the least. Especially when the price of said pieces are so high relative to the effort put in. Also, Sokol is a douche bag in person, and thinks he is one of the greatest artists to ever walk to earth, which is really the only reason I don't like him."
glassheads,33e755,IVXXLLC,2,Wed Apr 22 02:42:17 2015 UTC,Well put. I remember when a simple colored spoon was thirty bucks and awesome.

The modern glass industry is barely 30+ years old and you really, really, really have to consider the ridiculously dramatic turn laws on cannabis have experienced.  We went from hiding in our houses with our glass and herb, to posting it on social media for the whole world to see and admire.  The bho scene on social media is even more crazy.  Its fucking awesome and to have been around since the 'stone ages' makes it even more exciting!  We are living in fascinating times people"

glassheads,33fzhi,rastapasta808,2,Wed Apr 22 05:30:51 2015 UTC,You don't even need salt.  Just pour iso in an inch or two past the reclaim and let it sit for an hour.  All of it will be dissolved and you can just run warm water through it till its clean.
glassheads,33fzhi,NOTORIGINAL420,2,Wed Apr 22 05:58:23 2015 UTC,Id just soak it in vinegar after the iso and salt so you get rid of the leftover salt that always stays on the glass
glassheads,33fzhi,dabIsland,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. ISO and salt should get rid of everything. Try to get 99% ISO  alcohol content for better results. I can only find 70% alcohol content usually, however that is still enough to get the job done."

glassheads,33a6f3,rastapasta808,2,Thu Apr 23 17:33:56 2015 UTC,The place you purchased it would be the place you would have to return it.  JP will only take repairs through a shop that carries his glass.  Repairs by him are usually free but take a long time because he waits till he gets enough to make it worth his time.  Now that someone else has touched it im not sure if he would try and fix it for sure
glassheads,33a6f3,rastapasta808,2,Thu Apr 23 20:46:42 2015 UTC,they told me it would come back like new but instead it was anything but. i feel slightly dishonored that they #jptoro when its not a true jp repair. i feel wronged that they posted my misfortune as an advertisement for themselves. I wouldve rather had it been away for months than look at like it is everyday. disappointed af.

glassheads,33a6f3,Chipperhof,2,Tue Apr 21 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"Seems like you're overreacting to the wrong things.  They posted their repair on their Instagram.  Pretty straight forward.  They didn't say ""Our dumbass customer broke their toro so we fixed it"".  You or your situation wasnt really taken advantage of.  And from my standpoint, the #jptoro hashtag isn't a proclamation that JP repaired it.  They mention in the post that they (the shop in question) repaired it in house so the hash tag is just a way of having more people see the post.  It sucks that they returned it discolored and ill-repaired.  You live and you learn.  From now on don't get pieces repaired from them and buy toros from somewhere else if you really feel like they did you dirty."
glassheads,33a6f3,Stoned4days,2,Tue Apr 21 07:24:01 2015 UTC,if you spent over $500 on the piece and $90 to get it ill-repaired you would reacting the same way.

glassheads,333uju,Xeas,3,Sun Apr 19 06:59:34 2015 UTC,"I think they're will be a jump up in production line and scientific glass,  maybe a jump in low-quality blown glass because people are just churning that crap out. More people will start having small habits and will eventually want glass to use most likely. The production line glass is easy and high quality so the manufacturing can be increased to meet a new market demand, especially to serve the growing medical demand as well. People who don't want tooled glass will go for the lower quality blown.  For the high-quality artisan level glass. I don't think there will be much change. The people who want to make the highest-quality glass are already doing it (for the most part). Those people will just continue on like normal, though maybe see a jump in the demand for this level glass, but because there isn't probably much they can do to increase production without a dip in quality it'll just end up making the artisan level glass more exclusive.  It might push the quality glass culture a bit more into the main stream smokers realm (or at least provide more contact) because once it's legal there will be stores that specialize in selling dank buds and stores that specialize in selling glass. So the regular users will have a knowledge base that is accessible beyond learning for yourself on the Internet.  Edit: I'd ideally like to see a big jump in the number of people trying to produce high quality artisanal glass. But I don't see it happening quickly. It takes time and dedication to get there. Maybe 15-20 years after legalization we'll see a jump in the number of glass blowers working at a high quality artisanal level.  TL:DR Abundance of meh glass: artisanal won't increase much. Won't decrease much."
glassheads,333uju,fruitPuncher,2,Sun Apr 19 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"The market will expand with legalization, but not all smokers/new smokers care about artisanal/art quality, so I would expect the continuation of the china/import market taking care of the types that shop at target/walmart/etc. and we will continue to have the art market for the whole foods/artisanal/farmers market types.  As long as there are artists pushing their craft, there will be a collector market for them, but I do worry about the mid tier guys and hope they can keep up with D.H.Gate overseas."

glassheads,333b69,glassta,2,Sun Apr 19 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"Some downsides I have encountered with Chinese clear boro (not necessarily joints):    Chinese glass tends to be less resistant to thermal shock (though proper annealing can mitigate this) Chinese tubes tend to be less round (especially at larger diameters) Chinese glass is more likely to have seeds, stones, and streaks I don't like how Chinese clear reacts with silver (either via fume or saturated colors), though there are many other factors at work (flame chemistry, type of silver, presence of other metals, fume skills, etc) and the only glass I've found that I like less for silver fume is...Schott.    Basically, the formulas may differ a bit, but the savings typically come from huge bulk orders from importers and poor quality control."
glassheads,333b69,soylentgringo,2,Sun Apr 19 06:28:27 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with chinese boro, it's used all the time by very well known artists. Chinese joints tend to feel like sandpaper. When people  say china glass sucks, they usually aren't referring to the glass itself but rather the work environment and quality of work produced."

Lol. But hell, I want one too lol! Although that just goes to show that the idea isn't just a novelty, I really think it's good and unique. Especially if it were big enough to hold a full beer... Or coke...  Where are you located? If you really are interested, I'll pm you my contact info.

Hollywood Smokin' is about two minutes from The Shop and has a good selection. I've never seen anything really ""heady"" in there, but there is better glass for sure and the support the local scene less than The Shop.

glassheads,32lrfw,Dr_StrangE,2,Wed Apr 15 11:09:09 2015 UTC,I like how he even has the other characters. This is really awesome.
glassheads,32lrfw,KtheAvenger,-11,Wed Apr 15 03:17:30 2015 UTC,Not a good Randy at all. Ugly.
glassheads,32lrfw,SHREDDY_KRUEGAR,3,Tue Apr 14 21:18:21 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty durn close.  What specifically looks off-model to you?
glassheads,32lrfw,soylentgringo,2,Wed Apr 15 00:41:59 2015 UTC,its just weird looking to me is all. like most pop culture character glass art.
glassheads,32lrfw,SHREDDY_KRUEGAR,2,Wed Apr 15 00:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem (with cartoon characters in general, not specifically this piece) is the awkward transition from 2- to 3-D.  This is probably most obvious with The Simpsons; there's a reason they are almost always shown in a 3/4 profile on the show.  Even their official merchandise looks weird from the wrong angle.    That being said, I find that the South Park characters tend to transfer pretty well, possibly because of the initial ""crappy construction paper"" animation style.  In this piece, the body proportions are a bit off (and I see the legs as stopping at the knee), but the facial proportions are pretty dead-on (the shirt as well), so it reads as Randy pretty clearly.  At least, I think so."
glassheads,32lrfw,soylentgringo,3,Wed Apr 15 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, if I remember correctly, they now use Renderman (the software Pixar developed) to animate the show, which is one of the most powerful 3d rendering software available. So they technically are 3d characters, just with no depth shading."
glassheads,32lrfw,Dr_StrangE,2,Wed Apr 15 11:19:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, once you've accepted the bouncy walking, square elbows, and other hold-overs from the paper days, the animation is pretty great!"

glassheads,32db4c,mrebb,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"I've always liked illadelph's quality standards and beaker styles, but I completely agree that their stuff is overpriced and nothing extraordinary – that's why I don't personally own any. However, it is difficult for me to ignore the craftsmanship on their more expensive beakers (when in the market for one). But that's why I am here! (For suggestions!)  Together, my friend and I own a lot of different pieces ranging from (all real) Roor, Illadelph, Mobius, HBG, Diamond, WGW, Revere, Crystal Fog, as well as from some local artists."
glassheads,32db4c,mrebb,2,Sun Apr 12 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"It looks like you guys have pretty much everything in that price range for a beaker. You should buy a .de over an illadelph imo, much more history and a serious following."
glassheads,32db4c,mrebb,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"We actually don't own a single beaker, so history is indeed important! I always knew .de's are well made and have history, but I thought illadelphs were regarded similarly. What's the history difference if you don't mind me asking?  We do love how you can customize a .de on their website, but their shipping times and possible customs delay are the main downsides (for us)."
glassheads,32db4c,mrebb,2,Mon Apr 13 18:56:43 2015 UTC,".de has an actual community on facebook  edit: Left out a few things out. If you go on tokecity you will notice the roor appreciation thread is about twice as long as illadelphs. It's that classic german and amsterdam feel that enthusiasts love, I don't know how else to describe it. Illadelph also has a shitty reputation (bad history) and they're honestly viewed as teenybopper glass. Not that roor has a squeaky clean past, but illadelph is probably scumbag steve's favorite brand. Everyonedoesit.com might have a good 4/20 sale going on, they stock roors like crazy. But I think it's worth the wait if you order it direct and customize it."

glassheads,31rbpn,ghengiskhantraceptiv,3,Tue Apr 7 15:43:19 2015 UTC,"That's the battle I've been having for 2 years now. You find someone who is good to work with one go and you try them again and get the waiting list or the run around. Find the specific artist your after and try and find their contact info (FB,IG,KiK,Big cartel, etc) having money ready in hand never hurts when talking to these guys as you can get things faster/show real interest. Try and talk to owners/collectors of the artist you're interested in and try and find out how their buying experience went. With what I know now there are some people you want to avoid as their business management is not where it needs to be (unfortunately this happens quite alot)"
glassheads,31rbpn,gatorboy240,2,Tue Apr 7 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"Many artists prefer to work with stores that have a reputation of good practices and a wholesale tax ID because when we sell to an individual there is are risks involved including Age, Sales Tax, entitlement, etc.  Its a tough situation but any artist worth their salt won't sell to you directly unless its for the full retail price.  And the artists who do ""wholetail"" to the public get a bad rep in the industry because they are jumping the line and cutting out the support network that is involved with keeping the industry safe and legal, remember pipe dreams? The government used the example of selling directly to the public as evidence against glassblowers and almost ruined the whole party."
glassheads,31rbpn,hooly,0,Wed Apr 8 01:22:16 2015 UTC,That's probably the best response. I will say that it hard to know who's a reputable dealer sometimes. I feel like the mark up on the piece I wanted was over 300% and at that point I can justify the purchase anymore.
glassheads,31rbpn,hooly,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:12:41 2015 UTC,"i understand your frustration especially with the niche market gaining value so fast right now seems like a major money grab.  The current value of glass is crazy and I don't quite understand pricing.  Most reasonable stores only double mark up, but some seem to think they can get highway robbery for some popular artists.  some stores will make deals if you talk with them and let them know that you are a loyal customer.  With pieces going for upwards of 1k these days sometimes it makes sense for stores to put a high price tag on a piece hoping that someone will come in and drop that much but in reality if they are a good store they can easily get another replacement so will sell for a couple hundred bucks profit for almost no real cost on their end.  So try to make a deal with the store but don't be disrespectful or undercut too much."
glassheads,31rbpn,Glasspirate,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:20:04 2015 UTC,I can understand where they're coming from I mean it just came in and you're definitely try to get top dollar.

I can't assure that you'll like the pull (some prefer the stem8/gline8s - they are airer hits, the pillar CHUGS). Nothing against the 4arm pillars, but I personally much prefer the look and function of the Peyote balls.  If you can find one of the 2015 overgridded pillars, or one of the OG pillars, that's the way to go."

I've heard the new pieces from steve are disappointing like the 4 arm so which are the best one's?  Obviously the OG pillar The stem-8 (which I personally am looking at)  Which other designs?  I honestly am not sure which the 2015 over gridded pillar is and how would I know that I'm getting one of his older better designs?  Also how does the hit of the hollowfoot differ?

I remember for the longest time I couldn't get into heady glass because it was more of a show piece than a utility and i preferred a really smooth rip and stacking bubbles over the art.  But now the two worlds of scientific and heady are colliding and its really amazing to see pieces that look and hit flawlessly.  Such as Eusheen's upcycler, Patrick Lee's skurps and crazy recyclers, quave's kliens, mothership's laser-cut percs, etc.  Right now so many artists are throwing down so hard, its important to take a step back and appreciate it all  Also thanks for the coverage, the event looked like a blast!"

glassheads,3176lw,TwStDoNe,3,Thu Apr 2 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"In general, prodo usually sells for a bit under retail value. Join the for sale groups of each brand on Facebook to get a feel for the market. With heady stuff from an independent artist, work usually will appreciate in value, but the market is never solid. I would get a piece from an established artist and sit on it for a while. There's really no right or wrong way to go."

glassheads,3176lw,montydabs,2,Fri Apr 3 16:57:56 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks man! I was getting similar anecdotes for other ppl so I went with a 1/1 custom instead from a fellow reddit or instead of a promo.  Thanks for your help guys
glassheads,3176lw,montydabs,3,Fri Apr 3 17:03:21 2015 UTC,"I would be very careful when it comes in investing in glass for the ""long run"" your safest bet would be something that a person who is not into smoking can appreciate. That is a good indicator as to what other art collectors who dont recognize boro artists at this time. That being said the glass market is always a series of ups and downs. Elbo for example was selling prodo dinos for over 2k last year, now people dont have the same demand and the prices have dropped. Mothership prodo is heading that way as well. Best advice is to find a talented relatively unknown artist and get a 1/1 from them and watch the market for their popularity. Every artist has the moment when they are at their peak demand and that is the best time to cash in. This is all just my opinion but I feel the glass market as a whole is a growing bubble and will pop eventually"

glassheads,30xj03,foodbudglasslife,2,Tue Mar 31 15:49:22 2015 UTC,Yes it's ceramic with a special glaze that pretty much gives it all of the function of glass.

We are stepping into a new age if this takes off and gets support from the community as a whole.  If people accept this medium, there will be no telling of how many new and intricate designs will be created through ceramic.  Might not seem like much but this is something to get excited about!  Its like we just landed on a new planet!!!  Also theoretically these could be 3d printed if made with ceramics so right now we are only limited by what we can think of.  Amazing time to be alive"

glassheads,312kh6,andrei0635,3,Wed Apr 1 16:04:20 2015 UTC,This post is pretty much impossible to answer. There aren't sufficient details to know what you're talking about. Is it a problem between the diameter of the adapter or the downstem? Pics?
glassheads,312kh6,aaronisafalcomain,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"ok, so i have a 18mm bong and i have bought an 14 mm downpipe. the downpipe fits but it is very loose, like it shouldn't let air pass but it does edit:http://imgur.com/lWV0e54"
glassheads,312kh6,aaronisafalcomain,7,Wed Apr 1 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't the fitting, it's the length. Your downstem is touching the back wall of the main tube, preventing it from reaching the fitting properly"
glassheads,312kh6,CODEINE_GUSHERS,2,Wed Apr 1 18:18:35 2015 UTC,this is the only answer worth reading in this thread people. everything else is a waste of time

glassheads,312kh6,ambivilant,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"Your pipe is an 18mm pipe yes, but that downstem is a 18 to 18. So it does fit, but the length of it is too ling like the other dude said"
glassheads,312kh6,gravehorn,0,Fri Apr 3 16:06:01 2015 UTC,You can buy 18-14mm adapters that will shore up the space between the two. You won't even notice the difference.   Edit: here ya go
glassheads,312kh6,rwekyes,2,Wed Apr 1 17:08:53 2015 UTC,That adapter won't do shit for your downstem. The outer joint on all stems is 18mm. That adapter will only allow you to use a 14mm slide in a 18mm hole
glassheads,312kh6,rwekyes,2,Wed Apr 1 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"Downstems are cheap as dirt, rigging it up wih paper sounds like tweaker shit. Just get the right one. Glass in glass joints have the same taper, it's a standard, so technically, yes, putting some stuffing would work. But I mean, really? Just spend the five bucks on a new one that fits and seals and won't have you fucking around with resin coated paper."
glassheads,312kh6,K_sKyWIper,2,Wed Apr 1 16:24:01 2015 UTC,"well, i have bought a new downsted so buying another one is not a problem, the problem is not using the bong untill i receive it"

glassheads,30w6x6,BongForAbrain,3,Tue Mar 31 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"My favorite piece by far, in terms of function.  It has a really nice pull to it that is similar to stemline-to-disc percs where there's an initial drag to get it going then it just purrs.  Not to mention is fucking awesome to watch when you hit it  Here's a function vid of my klien: https://instagram.com/p/zOtiWalXsF/"
glassheads,30to1d,goldie_chron,5,Mon Mar 30 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"Dont know why this guy's work hasnt gotten more popular. I think his mastershakes are way better than BTBG and his Yoshis are dope too. Never understood why BTBG mastershakes got so popular, i think his work is not clean and almost jank in some instances."
glassheads,30to1d,r0nin,6,Mon Mar 30 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"Epok is a hermit.  He is super low key and isn't into social media and hustling glass like other artists.  He has a loyal following and its enough for him.  Like others said, its all hype nowadays because this scene is so young.  Almost immature at times.  So much so, that the majority's taste is usually defined in fads and bandwagoning rather than research and experience.  Some glassheads love glass for the art and culture while others depend on it as a personality.  At times I dislike parts of this scene and how fake it can seem but there are talented, humble artists out there, like epok and birddogg, who keep it real without losing their heads.  Tl;Dr: its all hype and if enough people say your name, your glass will sell."
glassheads,30to1d,rastapasta808,5,Mon Mar 30 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"Good assessment of Epok, and i have to praise him for how humble and low key he is. Other artists could really take a page from his book on how to handle themselves online (cough glassmunky cough).  Even better assessment on the hype. Completely agree with disliking parts of the scene and how fake it can be. IMO the rise of dabs and 710kids had a lot to do with this."
glassheads,30to1d,r0nin,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"I mean like its nice that he's humble, but I literally can't buy one of his pieces because I gave up after hours of googling"

glassheads,30to1d,BongForAbrain,3,Mon Mar 30 18:47:28 2015 UTC,"Look up bart banisadr on fbook, he is one of Epok's top distributors and probably your best bet for getting a hold of his work. He had a majority of the yoshi's that were made and I am pretty sure he has these rainbow rigs as well."

Function: https://instagram.com/p/0Q9_V5Gu_7/  So dope.  He and Birddogg are a couple of extremely creative glass artists who are flying right under the radar for now.
glassheads,30to1d,rastapasta808,2,Mon Mar 30 19:06:49 2015 UTC,They are shopmates along with another of my favorite lampworkers Rob Harper and i believe one more person.  Some of Oregon's finest
glassheads,30to1d,TwStDoNe,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:08:08 2015 UTC,"Most likely because of the action of the percolation.  If you think about it, the shrink perc and epoks perc don't really cut bubbles and diffuse the smoke like, say, stemlines or hole or tree percs.  They pull the vapor and water together through the piece which cools the vapor while preserving flavor.  As the vapor travels, it expands and shrinks while going through the percs.  I could be wrong though"

glassheads,30pah9,defaultfox,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:13:51 2015 UTC,well when you do if your up to it let me know in a pm what the price will be and I might be interested.
glassheads,30pah9,herblover_72,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:21:17 2015 UTC,Will do man. I'm moving out of state so I estimate it will be around two weeks and the price will be around $60-80
glassheads,30pah9,herblover_72,2,Mon Mar 30 00:27:55 2015 UTC,"Seriously, for marbles that beautiful? And that's all you're selling then for?  When you get your shop back open I might need to fund your pension lmao"
glassheads,30pah9,herblover_72,2,Mon Mar 30 00:37:00 2015 UTC,Will do! it's what I love doing and I just want to make enough to keep doing it
glassheads,30pah9,herblover_72,0,Mon Mar 30 00:59:12 2015 UTC,you rule! it always makes me seriously happy to see people in glassblowing with this attitude  that's not to say i don't hope you start making way more than enough to keep at it though :P you should-- you're slaying it  anyway i hope the weather gets better soon so that i can get the tent set up in my backyard. i'd love to eventually throw some cash your way and maybe get you on a project with one of my friends. it's pretty damn exciting to see flowers so reminiscent of kobuki's work going for less than a fortune haha

glassheads,30kjel,ambivilant,2,Sun Mar 29 02:07:38 2015 UTC,You can hold them about 6in away and be fine. The heat radiates inside the rod similar to a fiber optic cable. The end is much hotter then the outside.

glassheads,30m6dm,Wyess,3,Sat Mar 28 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"If you slap a nail on that (which I'm not sure why you would),  the nail will dictate the overall air flow.  If this is being used for flowers tho,  I don't think you need to worry about that small of a difference.

glassheads,30m6dm,paperclouds412,5,Sat Mar 28 17:30:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter.  The female has a larger diameter at the opening but what are you going to put in there so you can smoke?  A male joint, which will make it the same diameter as the other male joint and also give it a similar airflow w/o a nail.  Male joints became popular because it took the converters out of the equation that were required for the nail and dome setups.  But now that honey buckets and drop downs are very popular, male joints arent necessarily convenient anymore.  Also female joints have the added benefit of keeping reclaim on the inside of the joint unlike male joints that get it on the outside.  This can cause the nails to get stuck on the male joints which is a common problem"

glassheads,30a0s9,peepingthom_,5,Wed Mar 25 18:11:08 2015 UTC,Add some salt to the rubbing alcohol  for an abrasive then shake the hell out of that thing. easy fast and gets pieces the cleanest of any other method I've tried

glassheads,30a0s9,Kingofmonke0,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:19:31 2015 UTC,Let me know how it works for ya
glassheads,30a0s9,wingmanly,3,Tue Mar 31 00:25:05 2015 UTC,I do hot hot water to get what I can out. Then at least 91% ISO Alcohol with Kosher salt and shake until it's clean. Kosher salt is definitely what takes it to the next level clean since the rocks break away the gunk.
glassheads,30a0s9,420smokeweed,7,Wed Mar 25 18:53:08 2015 UTC,"also, keep a Rabbi at hand to make sure your glass stays kosher."
glassheads,30a0s9,Bendy0,6,Wed Mar 25 19:42:31 2015 UTC,Shalom
glassheads,30a0s9,Bendy0,3,Wed Mar 25 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"Since it's a curve and a rig - use acetone and salt as a first wash, then do it again using isopropyl, and finally wash it with hot water.  I've found if you only do the acetone wash you're left with a small film on the glass. By doing a second wash with rubbing alcohol it cleans it up real nice.  The normal isopropyl/salt won't work for oil like it does for flower pieces."
glassheads,30a0s9,Bendy0,2,Wed Mar 25 20:20:22 2015 UTC,Any idea of what kind of acetone to get? Just regular acetone from a hardware store? What would u recommend? Yeah salt/iso still doesn't get some of the oil residue out.
glassheads,30a0s9,Frangipwn,2,Thu Mar 26 02:38:11 2015 UTC,I bought nail polish remover with enriched vitamin E from CVS. I was looking for just plain acetone but couldn't find any (didn't look at a hardware store though). It worked great for me.

glassheads,30a0s9,Stoned4days,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:22:05 2015 UTC,I used to use rubbing alcohol and salt untill I found this stuff. It works amazingly quickly and take about 30 seconds to clean the worst pieces.  http://www.doughmainsmokeshop.com/Randy-s-Black-Label-Cleaner-12oz.html
glassheads,30a0s9,FroNGrow,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:17:15 2015 UTC,if you can just put a small amount of iso in your rig then place said rig in the microwave for 25 seconds. after a shake or two your piece will be sparkling. (only do this if your rig is quality boro)
glassheads,30a0s9,Quats,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:04:10 2015 UTC,I use grunge off everytime and give it a good hot water rinse after.  Only distilled water in my pipe to prevent water marks.
glassheads,30a0s9,Mahatma_Blondie,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:51:16 2015 UTC,Stains as in stubborn reclaim or hard water stains? I have ridiculously hard well water at my place and every couple weeks or before I sell any glass I have to give it a heavy shake with CLR and also apple vinegar to fully release the mineral staining.

I know their cups are different but I feel it's really the concept of them which makes them original artworks. Slop cups look that way because C.U.P. stands for C.ontemporary U.ndercover P.ipe in Japan cannabis is strictly illegal and enforced harshly, so it is made to hide in plain sight. The Eskuche cup rigs are inspire by his non functional ""Trash"" line of work where he makes more than just icee's and soda cups but a wide variety of trash items.

glassheads,2zzc8u,goldie_chron,3,Mon Mar 23 04:50:11 2015 UTC,"Amani Summerday isn't really on the come-up.  He's been balling for the last couple years but like certain artists he is very low key on social media.  Dude has an amazing style of cold work, reminiscent of Clinton, and his compositions are very aesthetically pleasing."
glassheads,2zzc8u,rastapasta808,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:11:07 2015 UTC,Agreed come up isnt the right word. Maybe gaining more internet prominence maybe

glassheads,2zx2c6,Matchstix,5,Sun Mar 22 17:05:13 2015 UTC,Any ballpark for how much this ran you?   I have been trying to get my hands on some of his outstanding work. I love his petrology collabs.
glassheads,2zx2c6,Hatstacker,4,Sun Mar 22 19:22:23 2015 UTC,It's on aqualab now for $2200.00 .    Some of the best work I've seen though.
glassheads,2zx2c6,darknetasshole,7,Sun Mar 22 20:45:38 2015 UTC,Unbelievable that something like this goes for 22 and an unworked egg goes for 25+ lol.
glassheads,2zx2c6,Rigga_Mortizz,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:46:49 2015 UTC,For sure. I like it a lot....
glassheads,2zx2c6,ellisDfor20,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:25:23 2015 UTC,His work doesn't hold its value as well as some other artist's so it's sometimes easy to scoop a good deal if you keep your eyes peeled.
glassheads,2zx2c6,antidamage,4,Mon Mar 23 12:57:42 2015 UTC,"Nice, my boys got a blue eyes giraffe too, I really like the hit on those"
glassheads,2zx2c6,Toasty337,8,Sun Mar 22 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"You don't mind it sitting there, judging? Or is it more of a ""DO IT YOU LITTLE BITCH"" look?"
glassheads,2zx2c6,Dick_McTwist,2,Sun Mar 22 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"hahah its eyes are saying, ""hit me you lil bitch"""
