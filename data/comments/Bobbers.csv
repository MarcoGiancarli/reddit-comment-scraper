Bobbers,3e0dvd,aStinkyLoad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting question with two very different answers depending on how you look at it.  If you want to know if it will bob well in a philosophical sense, that is to say ""stripped down and made to go faster"" then yes it will. If you're willing to work with all of the unusual traits of the shadow, you can make a really interesting modern street custom.  If you want to know if it will bob well in a traditional aesthetic sense, that is to say ""made to look like a 1940s/50s bob job"" then no it won't. You'll be fighting with it the whole way and it will never look right.  It's got camshafts and cam chains rather than pushrods and rockers. It's got a twin backbone and twin vertical carbs rather than a single backbone and single horizontal carb. It's got a radiator and liquid cooling rather than air cooling. It's got mag wheels rather than spoke.  If you're willing to work with these things and make features out of them, you can end up with a really cool bike. If you attempt to hide them and make the bike something it's not, it will always be just another imposter and a poor substitute for a harley.  Oh and to answer your question about spoke wheels, that can get pretty expensive. Expect to have to spend a good 600 bucks or more to have spoke wheels made up for you with custom rims. Especially since you're basically going to need custom hubs made up for you as well."
Bobbers,3e0dvd,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"Well shit....that puts a damper in things.   Not looking for the traditional sense of the 40s/50s look. I want stripped down, decently fast, and good minimalist looks.   As far as the wheels go, that really outs a damper on things. Is there no way the 750 wheel will fit? Or any other Honda wheel for that matter?"
Bobbers,3e0dvd,ZombieOmNom,0,Tue Jul 21 02:17:50 2015 UTC,"It's possible that wheels from other models might fit, you're mostly just up against some machining challenges at that stage which is preferable to hundreds of dollars worth of bespoke wheel building. Your biggest concern with wheel swaps is spindle diameter. If the spindle is the same size, all you really have to do is turn some new spacers. Most competent shops should be more than happy to take on this work for you, and I'd expect it to be no more than a couple hundred bucks and that would only be if they hit some snags along the way.  You will probably find that the 1100 will be a lumpy, vibey, sluggish ride at best. It's a shaft drive bike, it's water cooled, none of these things really help with weight. Adding spoked wheels will add weight to an already heavy bike.  My advice to you is find a donor bike that is closer to what you want. Like this: http://sanantonio.craigslist.org/mcy/5129079361.html  Chain drive, spoke wheels, newer bike, lighter, cheaper to insure, etc. etc."
Bobbers,3e0dvd,CrunkvilleTX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:29 2015 UTC,I'm bobbing an 1100 shadow spirit right now.   The one thing I don't like about it is the brutal double backbone. Doesn't give many options for different tanks.   I'm not sure if you can get the spoke wheels. I usually see the 750cc with those.  The 750 also has more parts available like bobber rear fenders and struts and stuff like that so you'll have to fab a little more with the 1100
Bobbers,3dyf5m,gita4,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"TO... Starting TO look the part... God damn autocorrect.   Next up: Pipes, forward controls and seat. Then hard tail. Oh and it might be good to get a tag bracket and brake light."
Bobbers,3dyf5m,Leejin,3,Mon Jul 20 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"Dude. That's scary as shit. Every time you accelerate your bum's gonna get a good wipe from your tire. There's a reason they're required. Get a fender, cut it short, put a piliover cushion on it.   This picture scares me. X)"
Bobbers,3dyf5m,Leejin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on the rear fender requirement? I couldn't find any literature specifying one way or another for my state (I live in the U.S., in Iowa). Laws are pretty relaxed here. I think the only real requirement for daytime riding is a headlight.   I'm not riding it on the street at the moment anyway because I don't have the tail light or tag bracket on yet, but I took it around the block a few times and the rear tire doesn't come close to the seat even at full tilt. There's a good 6-7"" between the bottom of the seat and the closest place on the tire."
Bobbers,3dyf5m,awaytome,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:04 2015 UTC,"I mean when you accelerate. You don't slide back?

Bobbers,3dtv1b,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:26 2015 UTC,Not at all.
Bobbers,3dtv1b,highwirefixer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:42:14 2015 UTC,"First of all I wanna say that I totally get where you're going with the bike, you want the hardtail bobber look with the low tire hugging fender, springer seat, and chopper style bars. I like that you've actually bitten the bullet and done the work yourself, and that's how everyone starts. I just think that you could do better and that you've cheaped yourself out of a much better bike by going overboard with the budget cuts.  I gotta say that one thing that stands out for me is the struts. I'm really not a fan of hardtailing struts and I never will be. They seem like a rather pointless backwards step. They don't really give you the hardtail look, they just give you the ""I've replaced my shocks with struts"" look. It's not authentic or genuine... it's as lazy as it looks. And you've sacrificed ride quality in the process. Seems like a fairly poor trade to me, and I'm willing to bet they were almost as expensive, if not more expensive than a new pair of shocks would've been.  There are alternatives to struts. For instance in some cases you can flip the swingarm upside down so that the shocks mount from underneath the swingarm rather than on top - pretty oldschool trick from back in the day, people used to do it to the early swingarm harleys. You can buy and fit shorter shocks too. Another mod for swingarms is to relocate the shock mounts further back, which is a bit of cutting and welding.   Or if you really want the hardtail look, you can buy DIY hardtail kits that use the swingarm as a jig. The hardtail kits require you to cut a fairly large chunk of the rear section of your frame off and then weld the new tubes in place, but the result is a substantial reduction in weight, the right look, and a sense of satisfaction that can only come from doing the job yourself.  Also, you'll always get a lot more praise and appreciation for making a good looking swingarm bobber than you will for another generic hardtail. Not saying that we make these things purely for the praise of others, but it is kinda fun to see people trying to figure out how the heck you managed to make a swingarm bike look good.  Never pussy out of a custom job because you think you aren't capable of doing it. These alternatives are rarely that much more expensive than struts (maybe by 20 bucks or so) but getting the job right and authentic is priceless.  I have to say another point letting down your build is your seat. It's completely flat, and has very little curvature lengthways. The upholstery was kind of a neat solution but seemed a little extreme considering that a rivet gun and some rivets probably would've cost less than all those eyelets and shoelace. Also the foam doesn't look especially dense, you'll probably find that it isn't very supportive and over time will cause sagging and excessive movement of the covering. More curvature in the seat pan will give you better lines from the side and offer more support. Also adding some curvature down the middle adds strength, support, and that authentic ""saddle"" shape. Or alternatively you could just hop on ebay and buy a ready made seat pan for about 30 bucks or so.  Upholstery is a pretty interesting and satisfying craft. Even cheap sewing machines usually have the ability to stitch through vinyl and thin leather. Beyond that you just need some basic materials. Scrimback foam is great because it allows you to stitch pleats to make a simple tuck and roll effect. You can make your covering into a kind of ""sock"" that fits over the foam and is then secured to it, rather than having to be stretched and risk tearing.   The last thing that stands out to me is the electrics. Specifically the wiring on the bars. You'd probably surprise yourself with how easy it is to relocate the various buttons and things from the bars to other parts of the bike. The main controls you need on the bars, just from a safety standpoint, are indicator/signals, horn, and high/low beam. These are 3 pairs of wires and 3 small switches, pretty easy to route that unobtrusively along the bars if you're willing to drill a few holes and feed some wires through. You can buy small switch units online which makes the whole thing so much easier.  Also things like dual throttle cables are just unnecessary. The ""push"" cable exists for one reason alone; in case the return spring on the carb(s) stops working. The chances of this happening are ridiculously low, so it's mostly just front end clutter. A good custom front end should have only 3 wires emanating from the bars; clutch, brake and throttle. If you move the starter, killswitch and lights on/off buttons away from the bars you can switch to a minimal throttle housing. The end result looks beautifully clean and gives the bars a massive impact.  Another little thing, and it's a really simple thing, is your risers. The leaning back shape of your original risers were designed to work with the swept back original bars. They make a kind of jarring contrast with the way your bars sweep forward. This would just be a case of spending a few bucks to get yourself some shiny new risers that will bolt right in.  I hope some of this is food for thought. Enjoy your ride, make sure you rack up the miles on it, and go check out sites like www.bobberinspiration.com. Develop your own tastes, develop your skills, keep building bikes, it's a fantastic hobby."
Bobbers,3dtv1b,417zq8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:28 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate this feedback.  You have some great points.  I think I'd much rather have an authentic hard tail than the strutted bike.  For now it'll do but might be something I will take on in the winter months.  The struts didn't cost me anything, they were made at work, but still I get your point.  The seat was shaped but turns out not enough, I'm not a huge fan of how flat it looks after the padding was added.  I don't think I'll buy one though, I'll just try  to make it again later on.  All in all, I really enjoy it as is and I'm proud of it but for sure it's a work in progress.  Thanks again for the feedback."

Bobbers,3d5jnd,Gadfly21,3,Mon Jul 13 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"One of the fun parts about having a bobber or a chopper is doing a lot of work yourself.  That's how guys end up with that kind of bike.  We just like working on it, trying different things/looks, getting ideas.  So it's not really that your taste changes, but you might get an idea for something better or just different that still fits the same aesthetic.  And if we didn't work on it ourselves, the bike would just be a money pit.  It's a big part of the subculture that you don't really see if you only look at it from the outside"

Bobbers,3d5jnd,Curtis_Low,0,Fri Jul 17 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"The easiest thing to ride is a bobber with offroad flat track style bars, mid controls, and a supportive seat. With those kind of ergonomics you just melt into the bike and focus entirely on the road and the ride.  The more you deviate from neutral ergonomics, the more the ride suffers I've found. Exaggerated bars, forward controls, oddly slanting seat, stupidly low seat heights, you get the idea.  Expect your tastes to mature and develop over time. Stuff you like now probably won't be stuff you like a year from now. I absolutely hate the kind of bikes I used to really love when I first started out.  If you've got the money, I'd recommend going for a Yamaha Bolt or a Sportster and taking advantage of the bolt-on aftermarket support that will let you get the look you want along with forgiving ergonomics."
Bobbers,3d67c5,dlavalley,2,Mon Jul 13 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"Why don't you take the bars off the risers, have someone hold a tape measure on your trees, and hold the bars up to where they would be with Zs?

Bobbers,3d67c5,stevenfrijoles,0,Tue Jul 14 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"You can have control cables made up/modified to fit easily enough, and most of the switches can be moved off the handlebars and relocated elsewhere. This gives you cleaner bars as well as solving your problem and is pretty easy to do."

Bobbers,3bj1ar,Curtis_Low,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"The internet is your best friend for starting out. Start by image searching your bike including the words bobber or custom or chop. Try different options. You can then click on the bikes you like the look of and this will often lead you to the forum / page / shop it was posted on. Quite often people include their build story in the thread with pics. You can go through and start getting some ideas on what to change and how to do it. If your new to mechanical processes than I tell people to start by ""tinkering"" - take something off, clean it, then work out how to put it back on like you removed it. You will learn your bike in no time :)"

I would also suggest either going with rigid mounted seat and keeping the rear shocks, or hardtailing it and keeping the springer seat. It's generally considered a bit derpy to have two sets of springs."

Bobbers,3atxoe,HTMLdude04,8,Tue Jun 23 14:07:58 2015 UTC,Honda Shadow is by far the best platform for a first bobber build. I built mine for under 2k and that included the price of the bike. Been using it as a daily commuter for the last 4 years with no issues except for a burnt out stator and rectifier and some fork seals i had to replace.

Bobbers,3atxoe,ZombieOmNom,2,Wed Jun 24 23:25:06 2015 UTC,What size bike are you wanting?  Lots of people on here buy smaller bikes because they are cheaper (600 CC or less).  I found a 96 Honda Shadow 1100 for 2K last week and picked it up.    So... what is your price range and how much power would you like to have?
Bobbers,3atxoe,tgwill,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:54:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm looking for one on the smaller side. Something that's good and maneuverable. As far as price range I'm trying to keep it under 2k.
Bobbers,3atxoe,NLH1234,2,Tue Jun 23 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the world of compromise. On the cheap japanese cruisers you'll find tradition-defying things like water cooling, shaft drives, and vertical carbs. All a complete fucking ballache if you're trying to make something relatively traditional looking.  However, if rather than hiding these things in an attempt to make the bike something it's not, you decide to make a feature of them, these bikes can really shine. I've seen some really slick ""new school"" light weight chops made out of japanese cruisers. Not a springer seat, swingarm mounted fender, or sportster tank in sight.  The downside here is to get something that really stands out, you need to put a lot of work into the fabrication. There's nowhere near the kind of bolt-on aftermarket support for the japanese cruisers.  As it stands right now, the 883 and 1200 sportsters, XS650, and vintage Triumph twins are the most well catered for in terms of parts. You pay more, but life is easier when it comes time to customize. Opposite is true for the jap cruisers; cheap to buy, but expect to have to set up your own workshop if you're not using a local fab shop.  That's just how it is."

You can fit a sportster tank with some minor modifications since they usually sit above the frame.  I'm getting a custom peanut tank modified from an old moped. But it can be problematic.  Personally I think the stock tank is too wide.  http://pinwallcycle.com/ebay/bike2840/001.jpg  Other than that, it's a great first project bike.

I think it works out as 1.8 gallons which is enough to take you about 100 miles depending on the bike.  I really want to mount it to my bike, even though it will require some modification.

The fork brace is actually the original that was attached to the underside of the front fender and then wrapped in carbon-fiber vinyl wrap.

I struggled with what to use in place of the original ""bubble"" style covers that were/are pretty damn ugly. I had this mesh sitting around and started messing with it and it turned out to be really easy to work into the slightly convoluted shape (bent on two planes albeit fairly slightly) AND it already had plenty of holes!

Bobbers,39zvvt,bigtrash,3,Tue Jun 16 14:53:15 2015 UTC,Any way you could shorten that front brake cable? That and lowering the rear fender would make this thing damn near perfect. Solid build man.
Bobbers,39zvvt,SligerStyle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"That's next on my list. The cable in the photo has been rubbed up on by the tire, so might as well get a new one thats shortened."

Bobbers,39zvvt,jamesvdant,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:02:28 2015 UTC,Looks great but you may want to consider some kind of fork brace ..I left one off my kz bobber and it felt seriously unsafe above 50mph added one and it's all good

Bobbers,39o3fk,RandomHero03,3,Sat Jun 13 03:49:40 2015 UTC,Does anyone have more information on the pod filter. Does it replace the entire intake system? im assuming you have to rejet after installing it.
Bobbers,39o3fk,jewmouth,2,Sat Jun 13 06:58:00 2015 UTC,54mm. I bought a filter for an xs650. Looks like this https://www.mikesxs.net/parts/img600/15-0027.jpg. I also did a stage 1 rejet. Works great.

Bobbers,39dim7,g33k_01,3,Thu Jun 11 07:09:06 2015 UTC,You can use it like a fuel gauge.
Bobbers,39dim7,Stuff_N_Junk,2,Thu Jun 11 12:02:57 2015 UTC,Can I get details on how you did the rear fender mount and it's supports?
Bobbers,39dim7,LouSkyWaka,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"Can I get details on how you did the rear fender mount and it's supports?   I used my original fender that I cut in half and rounded the rear with a grinder. I attached it using existing bolt on the swing arm (L/H & R/H lower shock bolt and upper drive shaft bolt). It's simple and it works pretty well!  I did the brackets with 3/16"" steel leftovers."
Bobbers,39dim7,Stuff_N_Junk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:11:08 2015 UTC,Are you thinking about doing the single carb mod? I just ask because I see you did an aftermarket air filter.

Bobbers,39d5x4,Leejin,3,Wed Jun 10 23:39:47 2015 UTC,"Most lights are grounded through the housing. Scrub the piss out of the mount until give got good bare metal to metal contact, should work.   Otherwise check your brake switch, probably gonna be a pressure switch inline with the brake line, might need to be replaced. You can try and jumper it and see.   Also, and this may be a stupid question for you, but are you running the correct bulb? Should be a dual filament, could be your issue there. Is it lit but just not getting brighter when you depress the brake?"
Bobbers,39d5x4,88sporty,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:00:22 2015 UTC,It's a dual filament. One is strong. The brake one is very week. I am gonna try to find the ground. That makes sense. It's a painted housing on a painted fender.
Bobbers,39d5x4,88sporty,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yea it definitely sounds like a bad ground somewhere, track that down and I bet it'll fix your problem."
Bobbers,39d5x4,lurker818,2,Fri Jun 12 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"With my voltmeter, it reads a solid 12v on both points of the 1157 bulb contacts.    I'm a little confused, both points should read 12v but only when checking the difference between any point and ground. if your getting a 12v difference between the two contacts one is shorted. It should read as 0v difference or an open circuit."
Bobbers,39d5x4,slothlovechunk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"Bypass the brake switch by shorting the switch wires together. If it lights up bright, your switch needs to be replaced."
Bobbers,39d5x4,TheAdobeEmpire,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:27:40 2015 UTC,Nope. Does the same thing. It tyurns on the second light.. but only dimly.. The voltages across both points are the same.

Bobbers,39d5x4,cgsouljah,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:36:00 2015 UTC,If its getting 12 at the light that exludes the entire power circuit including fuse...thus just leaving the ground to be the demon  Source: aviation electronics technician

Bobbers,3939xi,usbombs77,2,Tue Jun 9 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"Nice work.  Dig the color too.  What year is that?  Is it a kicker?  Did you delete the battery or just hide it?  Does the spring seat clear the fender?  How are those pods working out for you?  Is that hardtail a kit or a different frame?  You ever consider a gauge cluster delete/move?    (Yeah, lots of questions, I know.  I have an 82 GS550L in the garage collecting dust.)"

Bobbers,390k9l,cgsouljah,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:57:29 2015 UTC,I had a look on the website and i cant find pipes for the 400. The 600 has heaps available.
Bobbers,390k9l,Contemplatio,2,Tue Jun 9 10:07:46 2015 UTC,Look at your bike. Draw it on paper. Draw how you want it. Make reality. Use your own creativity to keep from falling into a mold... brake out of the box and inspire yourself!
Bobbers,390k9l,irishexpatriate,2,Mon Jun 8 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"Like many have already said, it's way too plug and play. Sure everyone's different and we all like what we like, but this bike is pretty much completely uninteresting for me. A bike should be about style and personality, and this just shows that you have a job and knows how to google ""bluecollar bobbers"" or similar.  That side cover goes against the shape of the tank and fender. Looks out of place.  Things I would do for a start?  Change the bars. Change the air filter. Change the pipes. Led blinkers. New tank.  And for the paint job, google bikes with more personality. Pinterest is your friend.  For me, motorcycles are about personality, style, gasoline, grease, metal, speed and some form of rebellion.  You're bike is more 35-40yo caucasian dad shoe."
Bobbers,390k9l,pendragoonz,2,Mon Jun 8 21:38:02 2015 UTC,"Fuck the haters. Do what you want.   Seriously. Do what YOU want. Don't listen to us assholes. Find pics of bikes you like. Figure out why they look that way. Then do that. If you don't want to do that yourself, maybe a bobber isn't for you.  And that's cool too. If that's the case, just enjoy your bike as it is!"
Bobbers,390k9l,Plutoid,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd change the pipes and wrap them. Paint the bottom of the forks, air intake and the headlight black. Could change the handle bars to something less stock locking but they seem to work. Normally most people remove the front fender but the orange looks awesome so I'd keep it on. Maybe some whitewall tires down the track when those need to be replaced. I'm not a huge fan of the side covers on steeds though, very big a clunky. At the end of the day it's your bobber, you can do whatever you want, just ride it and enjoy it :)"

Bobbers,390k9l,Contemplatio,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:20:06 2015 UTC,I ordered new bars and mirrors shortly after picking it up. I want to put new pipes on but i cant find any where that sells pipes for the 400. Heaps of stuff for the 600 but everything for the 400s is hidden. I want to change the side covers and seat so im going to try and make something up to replace both of those. Im looking at new indivators and also a new head light as this one isnt bright enough for me. I want to change the speedo aswell but im unsure what to change it to. Really appreciate all the help and advice. Im new to bobbers and something about them and seeing some of the bikes around this sub-reddit is amazing. Thanks guys
Bobbers,390k9l,Contemplatio,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:02:58 2015 UTC,"The pipes that are on there can be chopped, extended and baffled. That's what I'm doing to my 600."
Bobbers,390k9l,bcvickers,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:59:50 2015 UTC,I thought about that. What piping are you using to extend yours? They look fairly small with larger chrome covers over the top but i havnt pulled it off and had a look at them properly

Bobbers,38qdkb,stevenfrijoles,2,Sat Jun 6 19:02:09 2015 UTC,I do know what a bobber is. And this bike stock is far from one. I'm going to be posting here frequently showing my progress on somewhat bobbing this thing out. Just thought it'd be an interesting project.
Bobbers,38qdkb,stevenfrijoles,-1,Sat Jun 6 01:36:22 2015 UTC,"So since you know what a bobber is, are you going to be making a new post for when you remove the fuel controller?"
Bobbers,38qdkb,eatoncj,2,Sat Jun 6 18:32:34 2015 UTC,Nah I'll keep that in there. Kinda necessary to have. Just a tad bit.
Bobbers,38qdkb,stevenfrijoles,-1,Sat Jun 6 21:57:29 2015 UTC,"Despite your sarcasm, it's literally not necessary at all.  An engine is necessary.   Did your bike run before you put it in? A fuel controller is an accessory, which let me clarify, is absolutely fine to have on your bike if you choose. But if you want a bobber, well, you can't have your cake and eat it too."

Bobbers,3893ae,Curtis_Low,2,Wed Jun 3 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Going to give you a bit of advice based on a looooong history of running forums with one specific one making it bigish (not close to the big big once but it was big enough that somebody paid a substantial amount of money to buy it off me and it was big enough to have an insane expensive server need). The below text is based on my personal experience.  Building a forum from ground up is very much like a restaurant, over 90% never make it past 1 year, its one of the hardest social media platforms to get off the ground. And the reason are quite obvious. If you have been in the ""webpage"" business for a sometime you figure out quite quickly that you have to give people a VERY good reason to participate. Most users are ""lazy"" they don't want to spend a lot of time registering, writing posts, responding etc. Especially if the forum is dead and the only person that answers is a mod and or he admin.  The busier your forum is the better of a chance you have to convince anybody who visits your forum to sign up and participate. Thats why so many people pay companies that ""fake"" posts which means you pay companies to create meaningful content e.g. posts and responses.  In my case since I was working of a budget the first few month I had conversions with myself, I argued with myself, banned myself to show people the forum is active - Its a lot of work!  The installation of Vbulletin is the easy and sexy part, finding the forum skin is nice, resist from having something flashy but go with easy to read and view themes, I know you want to have a flashy type of theme but you are not fooling anybody, you are the new kid on the block and too flashy looks like you are trying to hard. I would even leave the original theme since this way you show that you are working on the objective that users really care about… content. You wouldn’t believe how little users care about the theme – Some of the busiest forums like Offtopic etc. have really simple themes, sure they have massive traffic and have to have a very light skin but why not plan for the future, use the already given theme which is specifically designed to be lightweight, you can always update the theme later.  The plan Right from the start, work on a plan, how far are you willing to take this? Money wise how far are you going to go with throwing money at this project? What is your line in the sand? Do research, start contacting other admins and see how they do things, read how to guides (there’s a ton of free advice out there). But plan ahead so you are ready when your numbers are increasing. Also think about long term plan, bobbers and cool rides is the “new” thing now, but I am pretty sure give or take a few years the interest will wither away. Be ready for that time and don’t loose half of your userbase.  Mods: Nothing screams louder noob if you ask the first member that signs up to also become your mod. You don’t need a mod with 100 users, you need a mod once things get out of hand and you have a hard time getting on top of peoples requests. Choose VERY VERY wisely who to offer the mod position, not everybody is made out to be a great mod, the funniest guy is most likely not the best person to be a mod. A good mod can make or break a page and I am talking out of experience here. I had a big enough forum and ONLY because of a two mods that made some very bad decisions and me not acting fast enough as the admin my community of 1k very very active members crumbled to less than 50 in a matter of days, it can go that fast, your community makes the community you are only there to support them. For the moment resist having any mods at all even if somebody begs you, you know when its time to have mods,  Rules: Again a noob mistake, they copy past the rules of other pages to look “legit” – it doesn’t. Have a rule Thread, sticky it to the top and have two rules. 1)  Have fun  2)  Be nice to each other  Coolness and being relaxed goes a long way and in todays over moderated internet area having a “free forum” can be very relaxed.  You never get it right for everybody: Get used to the idea that you will loose members because they don’t agree with your decision and or don’t like other members, the day will come when a very respected member and somebody you learned to like and appreciate (active members are worse their weight in gold) will threaten you that he she will leave if you don’t ban that member. Don’t give in to threats, if the person leaves so be it, you cannot get it right ever time and your userbase will forgive you if you stay honest to them.  Modification: For the love of god! DO NOT GIVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION  to get too many modifications from vbulletin.org (including template changes etc.) on your board, DON’T HAVE ANY!! AT ALL! – RESIST RESIST RESIST. There are a thousand of cool mods out there and a lot make sense but only later when you have a the userbase that can use them and like them.  Members: They are your bread and butter, treat them super well, be nice and respond to them fast, a lazy Admin is the death to any forum, you are the fore runner of your place, running a forum is really hard work!!  Treat your competition nice! Chopcult is big and what I would say a successful community but don’t worry they are struggling as well and depend on their members as well. BY NO MEANS user their page or any other page to slingshot your forum, it’s a total no no, and makes you look like a dick. That includes links to your forum, Links in your signature etc. Instead get in contact with the admin team, tell them who you are and that you don’t want to leave the wrong impression, say that you are not interested in competition but you are doing your own thing and ask for advice, I had one of the very successful independent Media webpage admin mentor me for a long time we are talking about a page which has per video 200K + views some even in the close million views, that stuff you usually only see with pages like youtube and other big companies. Because I was nice but didn’t back down (At that time) we had a real good thing going where he helped me out (plugged a lot of my videos and posts for free which he usually charges a lot of money to other pages).  Learn the difference between good and bad traffic Or rather traffic that sticks e.g. traffic that gives you members.  For excample: The traffic that you get from posting your link here, will most likely not get you a lot of users because you posted it yourself (I know you have to start somewhere), a respected webpage that compliments for free because you have good content will get you a lot of traffic and also a lot of new members.  There is a critical point were (and you know when you get there) once you hit it you have enough members and things run by itself and all you have todo is to continue to drive forward. ITS INCREDIBLY HARD TO REACH THAT POINT AND SOMETHING THAT MOST ADMINS TRY OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Its down to luck, the right concept, the right time etc,  Some more tips and tricks that gives you at least a fighting chance:  1)   The first battle is to convince new members to sign up, Vbulletin is a great platform and in the beginning I would highly suggest that you make the sign in process as easy as possible, resist the urge the admin the shit out of your board, I know you have all the sexy options in your admin CP but seriously you can use these all later (and you will need them, spammers are increasingly headache for Admins) for the moment, let members sign up by putting in a username and password don’t make them confirm their account (do that later when you have a good few members). You want to advertise that they can sign up real quick and post.  2)  The first golden rule when starting your new forum is IT HAS TO LOOK BUSY! The worse for you to convince any new potential member that your forum is worth signing up for is if you have 20 subsections and 19 have zero posts and all posts are old. Trust me if you ever get a lively community they will tell you what they want, I’ve been there and it’s the revers spectrum were users become a headache because now they care about the page and demand change and see it as THEIR page. Once you get to that point when they think they run the show that’s when you give them piece by piece stuff, never everything at once.  For the moment I would seriously condense it to 3 sub forums.  a)  Top Forum – Gossip and or all goes (this is the forum people shoot the shit, less strictly moderated, that’s the forum you build up the community, were people bond and fight with each other)   b)  Bobber forum (all bobber talk including how to’s pictures etc)  c)  News and updates in regards to the page (maybe, but if It would be me I would resist the urge and have only 2 subforums).  With the above layout you guarantee that you don’t spread out your content too thinly but it looks better if somebody sees that a subforum has 100+ posts and not 5+  Edit: Some spelling and formatting."

Bobbers,37zwxx,BigMike0228,4,Sun May 31 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"Nope. I'm not a big springer fan. Is the tank raised? I think, if it was my bike, I'd lower the tank some and keep the rest like it is."
Bobbers,37zwxx,TurboGLH,2,Sun May 31 23:21:38 2015 UTC,Yes its raised.  I bought the bike like this so maybe I'll drop it down and see how it looks.
Bobbers,37zwxx,Contemplatio,3,Sun May 31 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"This was exactly what I was going to recommend. Keep the front end, looks mean. I always feel like adding springers is trying too hard to be different/custom/oldschool. Lowering the tank would make the bike look more compact, right now it looks a little bolted on.  Last thing to consider would be a belly pan. Image 1 Image 2  It's a great place to put some graphics."

Bobbers,37vr25,Blizzardnerd,5,Sat May 30 20:21:50 2015 UTC,Was it wrapped all the way up there? I've heard that wrapping holds water and slows down the cooling of the pipes and causes things like this.
Bobbers,37vr25,robosmrf,1 point,Sat May 30 21:00:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I had it wrapped all the way up. Now I know. Thought's on how to get it fixed? New custom pipe is like $400. Don't have the money for that. I saw that a used yamaha vstar 650 pipe is going for about 200 on ebay. Wondering if a welder or exhaust place can fix it.
Bobbers,37vr25,drstock,1 point,Sat May 30 21:38:31 2015 UTC,If you're in the san francisco area I actually have a vstar 650 exhaust from a 2009 laying around. Not sure if the exhaust is the same for all years but if so you can have it for cheap.

Bobbers,37vr25,Frodofficer,1 point,Sat May 30 23:23:49 2015 UTC,Had the same problem myself ...by the time the pipe is in that bad a shape there really is no fix .. If you get it welded up it'll just find a new place to break/leak... Hit eBay and the bike specific forums maybe you'll get lucky I did  ...if you decide to wrap the new one make sure to maintain a coat of silicone spray on the outside of the wrap to repel water ..has worked well on my new(old) set

Bobbers,37h1js,the_truth_here,2,Wed May 27 16:01:48 2015 UTC,This is my eventual plan. The only downside is you can't have a tiny rear fender. With how often I have a pilon it's all I need.
Bobbers,37h1js,WhatDidYouSayToMe,1 point,Wed May 27 19:59:04 2015 UTC,Well I'd like to have a passenger seat too. It's my only bike and people are always wanting rides.

Bobbers,37hfsn,z9nine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:08:28 2015 UTC,Everything I've read talks as much about the safety aspect more so than the handling but they pretty much go hand in hand if you asked me. When I took my front fender off there was a large heavy duty bracket spot welded to the underside that I simply removed and wrapped in carbon fiber vinyl wrap and reinstalled. These older bikes are twitchy enough that I didn't want to risk it.

Bobbers,37hfsn,lurker818,1 point,Wed May 27 19:38:43 2015 UTC,I haven't noticed anything too bad with the front removed.. the rear on the other hand throws dirt and water all over your back. I ended up putting a small fender but i still get dirt all over my shoulders and helmet.
Bobbers,37hfsn,Mazdaspeed6,1 point,Wed May 27 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"I think for the rear, I'm going to use the stock fender and cut about 4 inches off of it to show a bit more of the tire. Perhaps that'll look decent."
Bobbers,37hfsn,Mangledbyatruck,1 point,Thu May 28 14:26:00 2015 UTC,The worse is driving on a freshly paved parking lot with no front fender. Its like sand blasting your face.

Bobbers,36c0wh,hugalar,2,Mon May 18 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Calm down though. No, I don't think you can do all that for $4k. IIRC, the open primary alone will eat well over half of your budget.  If you want to go rigid, you could use biltwell or similar struts, but for the look you're thinking of, you'll need to weld on a rear end. Know anyone that can weld good enough that you'd bet your life on it? Make sure you're 100% on it before you go this route.  If I were you, I'd just work on it slowly and consider it a learning experience. Take off some stuff that you don't need, extra chrome and whatnot. Maybe start by putting some of those ape hangers you want on, as that's usually pretty straightforward and inexpensive. Remove and then reinstall the gas tank, seat, rear fender as they are all easy and you'll get a better idea of how everything fits together and how the wires are run.  Ride it in between projects, make sure you still like the direction you're going. You'll end up changing your mind on some parts as you go, that's normal."

However I do know of a guy i fully trust to do any kind of welding for this bike, would you suggest going with a premade ridged frame weld on an attachment?

A bike's a terrific piece of rugged metal ingenuity, I wouldn't hide that by making it all one dull color.  My thoughts on spray painting in general are: Spray painting your bike doesn't have to mean matte black.  It's actually kind of surprising how professional you can get spray paint to look if you take your time and use the right type of paint.  For 1/10th the price, you can't tell the difference."

Bobbers,34pms5,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sun May 3 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"The definition isn't loose. A bobber is a motorcycle that has stripped down to save weight, which is a practice known as ""bobbing"" - the resulting bike is properly termed a bob-job. Drilling holes, cutting bits off, shortening things, etc. Modern bobbers often go with a 1950's aesthetic for bolt-on parts.  Chopping came out of bobbing, and involved modification to the frame. Hardtails, goosenecks, rakes, girder forks, etc.  There's a crossover between bobbers and choppers where you get a ""50's bobber style"" chopper, the intention being to get something resembling the look of a 1950's bob-job. This involves the addition of a hardtail, which makes the motorcycle a chopper.  There are a lot of people who don't know the difference between a ""bobber themed chopper"" and a bobber, so they just call it a bobber. One day that might end up changing the definition, but as of right now those bikes are technically all choppers."
Bobbers,34pms5,Contemplatio,1 point,Sun May 3 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just meant the general definition, not the textbook/wiki/dictionary one. But I agree, it should be quite clear, I find it more irritating though when someone does a minimal change like a shortened fender and new grips to their stock cruiser and call it a bobber.  Edit: Early on I though the hardtail was the definition of a bobber since when you ride it you bob up and down on your springed seat."

Bobbers,341b80,LegendaryLaserX,3,Mon Apr 27 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Well that really depends on what you like and how you like to ride. For such a stripped down bike the handle bar area is very busy.   I'd ditch the mirrors and get something round and simple [if you legally have to have them, I just run one mirror on my bike] it might look good having a mirror clamped onto the front forks instead on the bars. The mirror are 75% of the problem   Move the speedometer, or get a smaller one [that can be pricy depending on your budget].   Relocate the ignition switch to the back of the frame?  The stock bars aren't bad but there are hundreds of bar choices out there and that can really change the style of your ride. Unfortunately I don't know anything about Hondas so I can't give you exact part ideas.   I'd also love to see some more pics of this thing. Maybe some before and after shots to. it's clean as hell"

Bobbers,341gou,thedog88,3,Mon Apr 27 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"I'd look at a different machine for your lady friend. That is guaranteed to ride like shit due to the hard tail and front suspension laid out like that. It's been my experience that most chicks want a nice smooth ride if they are to go more than a couple blocks. You can get away with the forks pointing that far forward with a springer front end but telescopic forks don't work with an extreme side load. Take a close look around the stem portion of the frame and make sure that you trust your life / bodily injury on the quality of welds that you find there.  Beyond that, check for the normal stuff of a vintage machine, make sure the rubber is dry rotted, that the electricals aren't corroded, that all cables and levers move smoothly, that the bearings roll smoothly and have no play etc."
Bobbers,341gou,dirty_hooker,2,Tue Apr 28 04:35:54 2015 UTC,I wouldn't get it for that price. There are no air filters and you can see gas dripping out the bottom of the carbs where there should be hoses. I also don't see a license plate bracket or brake lights/turn signals which is only a problem depending on the state you live in. As for the wife you could get a detachable seat but you still need to attach some foot pegs for her and it will still be uncomfortable with those solid struts.

Bobbers,341gou,Stuff_N_Junk,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:41:09 2015 UTC,Just look up detachable passenger seats. They usually just suction cup on or use snaps.  When you go and check it out I would test the front suspension. It looks pretty dropped down and there might not be much travel. It really comes down to how uncomfortable you will be. I know where I live I wouldn't want to ride that with all the potholes and shit.

Bobbers,341gou,Whitworth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:20:43 2015 UTC,"http://bobberinspiration.com/  When I think of a bobber, there's definitely a style aspect to it when you compare it to any other motorcycle. It does closely resemble a chopper at times, albeit an older style chopper.  More specifically, I believe bobbers spawned out of the desire to reduce the bike to bare, absolute essentials only and nothing else. This is why you'll often find things like turn signals removed, electric start removed (where kicker is available,) even the battery can be removed and replaced with a charge-holding electronic thing if I remember correctly. Rear shocks can be gone, front brake can be gone, etc. The less on your bike for you to have to deal with, the more of a bobber it becomes in my mind. I'm sure others have different opinions on that. :)"

With cruisers for the most part you're not going to run into anything that can accidentally wheelie or break the tires loose in a turn unless you REALLY fuck up.  It's mostly a matter of finding a bike that fits you and one you're comfortable with the weight of.  In all likelihood you'd be fine with either a 650 or a 1100.
Bobbers,33y1l4,Plutoid,2,Sun Apr 26 19:52:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I might just get the 650 for a first and then upgrade if I need to. I don't need to go fast like a sport bike. I just want to make sure it can get up up and move if it needs to

The V-Star 650 is like 40.00 HP and 37.6 ft.lbs of torque - albeit at much lower RPMs.  The SV is 375 odd lbs and the V-Star is over 500lbs.  They're very different animals.

Bobbers,33y1l4,Mangledbyatruck,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:48:50 2015 UTC,Yea I'm gonna sit on it and see how it goes. There is one of each for sale in my area. The 1100 has 6k miles and he's asking 5500 and the 650 has 7k miles for 3500.
Bobbers,33y1l4,Mangledbyatruck,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:45:00 2015 UTC,"I would say either a Shadow or Vstar 650.  Reasons: Both are reliable as fuck, and have great resell value due to being beginner bikes.  The great thing however is, both are highly customization if you into that thing.  650cc is also plenty enough especially in the city, you've got to ""push"" them a bit on the motorway but they do 160 Kmh max which for me is plenty since my bike has no fairing etc. and by 160 you are holding on quit a bit.  Another reason why 650's are a lot of fun to rid is that you use all gears when riding in the city.  Don't believe people that say these bikes are slugish, they have plenty of power and I ride both nice and agressive when in traffic, once you get use to the bike you can push them both pretty hard.  The only downside of the vstar is (IMHO) its dual backbone, which makes the whole frisko'ish tank conversion a pain in the ass!"
Bobbers,33y1l4,Contemplatio,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:26:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm gonna sit on both the 650 and 1100 and see which one is more comfortable.   As far as the highway is concerned, some of my friends ride bigger cc cruisers and I don't want to be left back or hold them up. That's one of the reasons I'm considering the 1100"
Bobbers,33y1l4,Contemplatio,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"Just go easy on the 1100, you just make a ton loads of mistakes when you are a new ride and I mean shit loads, its unavoidable and part of the learning process, when I think back what shit I got away with!!! The 650 in my opinion is a bit more forgiving than the 1100."
Bobbers,33y1l4,Robofetus-5000,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:54:21 2015 UTC,I was reading that the 650 isn't as forgiving at highway speeds. Like it needs different gearing or another gear all together.
Bobbers,33y1l4,Robofetus-5000,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:06:58 2015 UTC,"what you mean excatly when you say forgiving? A bike's natural ""instinct"" is to stay upright and go straight, I found the 650 really easy to handle even by max speed, once you get used to the fact that the engine is fucking screaming at you to throttle down or die you are good.  Keep in mind that my exhaust has only one baffle left so its really loud - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nehSruqdgc"
Bobbers,33y1l4,Robofetus-5000,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:16:21 2015 UTC,"I have a Shadow 600. Highway is a pain, super high revs, not very pleasant. If you're going to do highway on a regular basis, go with the 1100. Also it's quite a timid bike, while my personal riding style would be problematic with a higher HP bike, I do wish for more power every time I ride it."
Bobbers,33aioc,ZombieOmNom,3,Mon Apr 20 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"She's currently in the process of a bit of a refurbishment, today's job was the chain.   Although she's a ""rat bike"", I like the oily rag well maintained but well used look. You tend to see that look a lot on the Japanese bobber scene. For me ""rat"" doesn't mean ""deferred maintenance"".  She's had:   New wheels, laced up with stainless steel spokes. The front rim is wider, going from fitting an 80 tyre to a 110. New bearings throughout. Cleaned, tuned carb, pod filter, open pipes. New carb boot/intake manifold. Crankcase breather. New sprockets, new chain (obviously). Reconditioned caliper, sprayed red, brembo pads. New headlight, tail light and indicators. New shock absorbers. New fork dust seals. New oil and filter. New speedo and throttle cables. Automatic chain oiler fitted. HEL stainless steel braided brake hose.   Next up I gotta remove the seized and stripped-head allen bolts on the brake disc so I can replace it. The disc is pretty deeply scored. The replacement disc will be brembo, to match the pads. No point having a stainless steel braided brake hose, reconditioned caliper and fancy new pads if they're being used on a totally fucked disc.  I also need to fabricate a bracket for the seat. It will sit very slightly higher with the bracket in place. Not a huge difference, probably about an inch or so.  The tank is in the process of having the stickers stripped off. I'm going to repaint it in some kind of rat theme, and hand paint some lettering and whatnot on there. Maybe ""Bob's Speedshop"" or ""Salt Lake Speedway"", something like that.  UPDATE: I decided to put the caliper on the bike to see what it would look like. As you can see the old disc is pretty badly scored."
Bobbers,33aioc,ChiefRama,2,Mon Apr 20 23:51:46 2015 UTC,Why the knobby tires?
Bobbers,33aioc,ChiefRama,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:07:41 2015 UTC,"A very valid question.  The bike is themed after desert sleds, salt flat speedway, early flat track, hillclimb, etc. and I also have a soft spot for the Japan custom scene. They use some pretty ridiculous tires and I liked the aesthetic.  They actually aren't true 100% dirt knobbies. The rear is a winter tread, which was the ""knobbiest"" tire I could find in that size. The front is an enduro 50/50 tire, which has a street profile.  I went with the street profile because although the bike is rideable down flat dirt roads, it spends most of it's time on streets and I wanted it to actually handle. I love riding too much to have a rolling sculpture, I wanted something that could be pushed through the twisties.   I've found that the extra width combined with the nice compound in the tires has made it very streetable, and it corners like a champ. I put narrower dirtbike style pegs on it so that it doesn't ground out, as that was a bit of a problem before.  I'm pretty happy with where it's at handling wise now. :)"
Bobbers,33aioc,Stuff_N_Junk,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:02:22 2015 UTC,Well either way it goes with the overall aesthetic.
Bobbers,33aioc,SixGunGorilla,2,Tue Apr 21 20:31:24 2015 UTC,Nice bike but I feel like the buckle on that seat would kill my nuts. Is it not noticeable?
Bobbers,33aioc,Robofetus-5000,2,Tue Apr 21 12:24:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't really ride it far like this, and the new shock absorbers make it a much smoother ride anyway so I haven't noticed. The belt buckle is just a temporary measure to hold the seat in place until the seat mounting bracket is fabricated. Once the bracket is in place, obviously there will be no need for the belt."
Bobbers,332u4d,busman_87,7,Sun Apr 19 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"Dude. I bet your bike will die at like 30mph. The forward facing exhaust? Strange. Also, drink a Newcastle if you're working on a British bike. X) cool bobber though. Fix the pipes."
Bobbers,332u4d,Leejin,2,Sun Apr 19 01:12:07 2015 UTC,Not gonna have the end of the pipe like that. Was just fuckin around to see what extended pipes looked like. And I do enjoy a nice Newcastle.

Bobbers,332u4d,matthewtmagee,2,Sun Apr 19 04:11:26 2015 UTC,I guess I should have been clear that it's just a mock for longer pipes. Obviously would cut the pipe to have to end by the rear wheel.

Just life - started off with a lot of landscaping that needed attention after some crazy storms in our area this Spring.  Then my car was in the shop, now dealing with insurance to get a new roof, had a death in the family last week....just priorities that take over.  My son (6) is on me to get back to work on it - our deal is if he helps me, he'll get the first ride since he's too young to really remember me riding it years ago.  Yes, all paint has been done with a rattle can.  I prep the surface normally, use a self-etching primer, then color, then clear....all from a spray can.  Honestly, no idea about fading or chipping, because it's sitting in the garage right now, but for the use it will get, if I can get a couple of seasons out of it, I'll be happy - I'll be itching to change it up again by that point anyway ;)"
Bobbers,32xabj,highway_hooligan,5,Wed Jun 17 15:35:10 2015 UTC,You're going to want to un J-Slam that bike before you tear the gussets off your frame. Thats a 650ccnd.com bike and they love lowering the back suspension by drilling a hole in the frame gussets and attaching the shock head there. The same effect can be achieved with a shortened shock head and you don't have to compromise the frame. If you have any questions PM me.  My V-Star 650 Custom

Edit: after looking at the first picture I see that the back (closest to the seat) part of the fender is quite high up and sticks out a bit. The only issue I could see here is that your arse is going to touch the fender when sitting on the solo seat, depending how heavy you are ;) but once you get on the road and you hit a bump your seat may touch the fender which could lead to chipping of the paint, I personally don't care since I have long time stopped to clean and care about scratches but I am not sure how neat you want your bike to be."

As far as the seat goes I see what you mean. I'm waiting until I pick out a seat and I'm going to re-adjust the mounts to make it work so that I'm not on the fender. Hopefully haha I'm only 5'8 155lb so I'm not big guy
Bobbers,31okjx,bcvickers,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:45:47 2015 UTC,Looks great. I've always wondered how these ride with such a short travel shock? I guess marginally better than a hard tail?

Bobbers,317xiy,Dirtroadrocker,3,Thu Apr 2 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying to ditch the chrome and paint it black. Man, everyone and their brother rides a no-chrome, blacked out bike.  So- my suggestions: New pipes. Drag bars. 1/2 of a fender, just enough so your ass doesn't hit the tire. Remove front blinkers- replace with led strips on the lower triple clamps. Similar minimal blinkers on the back. Eliminate huge air filter.  I can't recall if that one is a single or dual carb.  If it's a dual, you could build a custom setup to go to a single, if it's single, you may be able to just slap a pod filter on it.  Here is a metric shitton of insperation: http://www.chopcult.com/forum/showthread.php?t=11641 Make a build thread if you've got big plans!  And remember this - you can do it. No matter how daunting the fab work, no matter how little experience you have, you can find instructions on chopcult or another corner of the internet, and you will follow them, and you will make it.  It may not be perfect the first go round, but damn you will be proud of what you've learned. And don't half ass it. Go big, or go home!  And I'm westboundbiker on the cult, you'll see me on from time to time."

Lower it - front and back, by a good 2"" or so.  Optionally, remove the stock silencers and put on some turnout tips or something.  Inspiration   inspiration   inspiration  inspiration"

Bobbers,30qupy,Dirtroadrocker,3,Mon Mar 30 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend dropping a set of pods right on the carbs. I just did the GAK from Ziv, $90 shipped with new mains and shims and replacement screws. Much cleaner look and a big performance boost, especially since you gutted the pipes. No more donut on the side.   Even gutted, those stock mufflers are quite heavy. Even the slip on Cobra's a lighter with a better look. I just did short shots on mine, they're nice, but I had to go back and buy baffles after the fact. Just too loud."

Bobbers,30adq4,stevenfrijoles,2,Thu Mar 26 13:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yea change the front turn signals. For bobbers I think the bigger gas tank looks a bit odd on a trimmed down bike i'd change it to something smaller and lighter. it looks like you still have passenger foot pegs on so those can be removed.   Change the mirrors to something smaller, relocate the speedo.   Your handle bar rises are the stock clunky looking ones I'd change those just for looks.   Again just my thoughts."

Love the clipon bars. Would probably be a bit more comfortable with some mid controls though surely? I'd love to have some mid controls fabricated for my bike but sadly can't justify the time or expense to do so.  Few things I'd recommend: Ditch the ""push"" throttle cable if you want a slightly tidier front end - it doesn't do anything, it's just a failsafe in the extremely unlikely event that the throttle return spring on the carb gets stuck/comes off. Take your control cables to a parts shop that does custom control cables and have them shortened. Takes a few minutes, costs a few bucks, and looks much tidier. Get yourself some braided stainless steel brake lines too, it makes the brakes a lot more responsive and they're less conspicuous."
Bobbers,303syx,ZombieOmNom,2,Tue Mar 24 21:44:24 2015 UTC,"The clipons are actually brand new, so I'm in the process of doing the cables. It's driving me crazy haha, but I just wanted to ride, not fuss with cables that day. But you're right, I use dot have mid rise controls, but I didn't like the look. Bought these clipons, and now I'm WAY too folded. They're awful haha. So I'm having a custom set of rabbit ears made, so hopefully that will be the last set of bars I have to buy."
Bobbers,303syx,Lamow,2,Tue Mar 24 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"Rabbits would be cool, would give it a kind of frisco 70's david mann meets japstyle look. They'd make the forward controls a LOT easier to deal with if they're your thang. I personally prefer the aesthetic and comfort of mids anyway, regardless of the bars. I just know from experience having tried low bars on a bike with forward controls that riding it is like a kind of yoga exercise. :P  Personally I'm really into lanesplitters when it comes to medium height bars. Once I'm settled in to Canada I want to find someone on Chopcult to make me up a set. Think they'd look pretty cool on a japstyle crazy orange inspired 883."

Bobbers,303syx,straws,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:36:47 2015 UTC,Question: Is that street legal? It looks like you just glued a broken plate to your caliper or something. I'm genuinely curious I've wanted a bobber for forever but can't afford one atm.
Bobbers,2zxj43,HotRod_Al,3,Sun Mar 22 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"That is a thing of beauty. Seriously, nice bike!"
Bobbers,2zxj43,TheDevilLLC,3,Sun Mar 22 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"Looks good, the scaled paint is killer. Is that the original rear fender?"
Bobbers,2zxj43,fallskjermjeger,2,Mon Mar 23 02:33:00 2015 UTC,"Sick chop man, I really dig this. Not so sure about the z bars though, I would've gone with something a bit more david mann inspired personally. Kudos going for mid controls rather than forwards. I bet this thing is super comfy.  Love the double whitewall btw."
Bobbers,2zxj43,ZombieOmNom,2,Sun Mar 22 21:13:49 2015 UTC,Nice bike. Is this in Winston Salem by any chance?
Bobbers,2zxj43,lacampbell900,2,Mon Mar 23 13:20:44 2015 UTC,Your bike looks awesome. Is it hard to use that mirror?

Bobbers,2ztzn4,ZombieOmNom,2,Tue Mar 24 13:59:51 2015 UTC,"Hot damn man, that looks so much better. Also I think that's the first time I've ever seen biltwell keystone bars actually suit a bike. Love the white paint job.  Looks like quite a versatile bike. I could see myself going the japstyle route and fitting a solid mounted seat, shorter rear fender, lane splitter bars, mid controls, etc.  Anyway I really dig the narrow frisco look going on. Bet it feels funky sitting on it looking down at that narrow tank!"
Bobbers,2ztzn4,dustbeard,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:01:50 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Still want to lose bar mounted switches and bring out the look of the bars more.  Definitely a good feeling looking down at the skinny tank.
Bobbers,2ztzn4,TheDevilLLC,2,Sat Mar 21 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"Something I've always wanted to do is remove all the bar switches. Unfortunately in the UK the law requires you to at least have horn, indicator and high/low beam switches on the bars, and your vehicle must have these to pass a yearly inspection. Practical, but unless you route the wires inside the bars, it's hard to get a clean look. I've seen some minimal looking switches but they're pretty expensive.  It's at least pretty easy to ditch everything next to the right hand, you just wire the lights to be permanently on, ditch the killswitch entirely, and move the starter button down near the battery box. This just leaves you needing a minimal throttle assembly, and a more subtle master cylinder + reservoir.  I removed my choke cable, converted the throttle to single cable operation, and zip-tied the cables together so they'd be tidy. It did make an improvement, but then you still got those big blocky switches on the bars."
Bobbers,2ztzn4,racoon1969,2,Sun Mar 22 00:07:27 2015 UTC,"I just bought a '00 VN800 this very morning - woo! I love the look of yours, and while I'm not going to change much on mine for a time, your bike is definitely a look I'd go with."
Bobbers,2ztzn4,stevenfrijoles,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  It's like an addiction.  Every time I change something, I'm ready to change something else.  Congrats on the new bike!"

Bobbers,2ztzn4,d_le,2,Sat Mar 21 23:33:29 2015 UTC,people underestimate the value of a clean and simple paintjob. The mixture of black and white looks great.

Bobbers,2zl9d1,GrandaddyFarooq,2,Thu Mar 19 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"Looks great! Time for some new pipes and a tank lift!  Do you have any ""before"" pictures. I am looking at a '95 883 in the same price range that I want to make into a bobber. I have never done anything like it, so I am a bit intimidated by it.   I would love to see what you started with. Nice work!"
Bobbers,2zl9d1,BobbyLee_Swagger,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"Go for it they are simple machines. Um unfortunately I don't have before pics. I can email you an electronic version of the manual if you PM me. These tanks don't lift quite as easy as the 01 and later but it can be done. I opted not to lift the tank right now, heres why.   My last bike had a lifted tank had a lifted tank and when a mini van ran a stop sign and I hit it broadside at 40 MPH the lifted tank and gas cap and speedo were in the way of my balls as I flew over the van. Was wearing full gear so I was mostly ok. Aside from my balls which swelled up to the size of a large grapefruit and turned purple/black from internal bleeding. Seeing the inside of my scrotum through an ultrasound machine was neat though. Also beer, prescription narcotics, pizza, and documentaries for the next five days was fun. Also the $14,000 dollar settlement was nice too.  I may do a very mild lift on the front of the tank. Need to get around to getting a flush mount gas cap. You know so my balls can slide right over it next time!"

Bobbers,2z5jj9,Portmantoverboard,3,Mon Mar 16 02:15:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I gotta figure out a strap. Still got a ways to go before I get it out on the road
Bobbers,2z5jj9,Leejin,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:54:16 2015 UTC,Love the rack too. If it's not too late perhaps you might consider raising the rear of the rack so the rail of the deck matches the angle of the backbone of the bike? It's a small change but I think it'll really make the board flow with the lines of the bike and make it look like it's supposed to be there.  Also it looks like there is a fair amount of play between the board and the uprights. Is there a chance you can secure the board by running the upright over the hanger of the truck To get a sort of pressure fit?
Bobbers,2z5jj9,TheDevilLLC,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:32:34 2015 UTC,It does actually go with the frame. i wanted to avoid making the board horizontal. I thought it would look dumb. As for completely securing the board. I'm gonna use a leather strap sort of like a belt.
Bobbers,2z5jj9,z6joker9,4,Wed Apr 8 09:06:22 2015 UTC,Um.. that skate rack has my butthole puckered. Secure it from the top somehow man. One bump.. that goes on the road and kills someone.

Bobbers,2yvsy9,Robthatguy,3,Fri Mar 13 05:42:26 2015 UTC,Well. In the beginning when my beard was sea captain length (see image in link) I just rode normal. Had a rather large moustache at the time. No real issue with the wind but I regularly use beard oil so I think that protects it somewhat from drying out. My girlfriend also became somewhat of an expert at getting bugs out of it which she found rather funny. I felt like a monkey getting groomed.  When it grew to halfway between grandpa and wizard I got a bandana since it would just get too bushy from all the wind.  Beard is back to sea captain but I kept the bandana because of looks.  BEARD LENGTHS
Bobbers,2yvsy9,Contemplatio,3,Fri Mar 13 10:10:13 2015 UTC,Wizard beard here. I've only ever had a bug or two. Oddly never been an issue. Maybe it's the magic spell.
Bobbers,2yvsy9,Robofetus-5000,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:18:40 2015 UTC,Windshield?

Only been hit by something larger once. Right on the cheek. Had to pull over for a couple of minutes to stop my right eye from running. Must have been a beetle or something."

Bobbers,2xmqfd,Leejin,2,Mon Mar 2 05:54:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely man. Some of this was just ""mocked up""  good enough to ride,  so I'm slowly making it better.  Adds to the excitement I guess,  haha."
Bobbers,2xmqfd,ThrowEmAllOut2012,2,Tue Mar 3 13:57:31 2015 UTC,I rebuilt my bike by hand and it's only tried to kill me once. But even after riding it for a year it still makes me nervous. But damn if it isn't fun and it makes me feel like a bad ass for riding a bike I made myself.
Bobbers,2xmqfd,Dirtroadrocker,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:29:11 2015 UTC,Damn that's a clean build. Looks great!

Bobbers,2xmqfd,Regalzack,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:58:47 2015 UTC,I have a Paughco hard tail frame as well. Your oil bag looks a lot like mine which is a 70's Paughco oil bag in black instead of the chome.

Also some gold paint on the chrome part of the headlight would balance it out nicely, That and throw another white wall tire on the front and that thing will be sharp!

Bobbers,2x6acx,Plutoid,2,Thu Feb 26 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't really either!  It's just that, for me, I look at bobbers and go, ""Now where are you gonna put your backpack/gym bag/gallon o milk/12-pack/whatever?""  I think it'd be cool if people put sissy bars or minimalist racks behind the seat just in case you need to clip something on there.  A back rest is a good way to eliminate the whole back fender and still keep your balls out of the tire should you hit a bump (especially with that hard tail/strutted job.)"
Bobbers,2x6acx,juicenx,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:48:21 2015 UTC,Would love to see it with some ape hangers.

Bobbers,2wrr89,FuckShitCuntBitch,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a ton of shadow threads over on chopcult. Some doing some really different things- one where the tank is built into the seats, and the 'tank' on the front is fake."

Bobbers,2wrr89,Dirtroadrocker,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"If you make a build thread, shoot me a pm- my handle over there is westboundbiker."
Bobbers,2wrr89,Mangledbyatruck,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely. The things is I'm on a budget, so I went to blue collar bobbers, and everything there is expensive. I'm trying to do the least expensive build with $300 the only thing I'm looking to buy are clip on handle bars and a solo seat, and the rest I will recycle and make brackets for the parts."
Bobbers,2wrr89,Mangledbyatruck,2,Mon Feb 23 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"I give you a bit of feedback on blue collar bobber.  Their stuff is not bad, in fact I kitted my current bike with Blue collar bobber seat and back fender. Their customer service is friendly and they are easy to deal with, very professional. For example, I ordered a ford light (above number plate) and while installing it one of the cables connected came loose. They literally send me a brand new light the next day, no questions asked.  Here is why I used them and I am sure its somewhat similar to you. Had a love for bikes nearly all my life, had a few before but never did anything with them but rode the shit out of them the way they are. We are all people that don't want to ride stock and don't feel satisfied riding the same crap so many others do.  But here's the problem ....  1) no garage  2) few tools 3) no experience welding or wrenching   Blue collar comes to the rescue.  You can literally bolt on and make your current bike look like a bobber in an evening, it seriously is that easy, even the wiring is  peace of piss with Blue collar boober.  Would I use them again... ABSOLUTELY NOT and here is why.  I have been wrenching on bikes now for a little over 3 years, and you learn an amazing amount you never ever thought  you would.  Fuck the first time I had to change the battery I thought it was a big deal, now I am angle grinding the shit out of the bikel, learning how to weld, working on solutions to problems to keep it running with the little time and money I have and you learn learn learn.  There is only one item that I would consider ""harder"" to finalize and much easier with BCB.  1) Seat, sure you can buy a seat from lowbrow but chances are you will need todo a fair bit of custom work maybe even weld a few things or get them welded for you to get the seat pan and all lined up depending what bike you have.  All other items BCB is selling expensive (but their product are quality wise great) like - number plate holder (lowbrow custom) - any type of lights (lowbrow) - handlebars (lowbrow) - Back and front fender (use what you have an angle grind the shit out of it. etc.  Front fender and back fender are piss easy to do yourself once you get yourself an angle grinder and get comfortable with the idea that your first ""custom"" bike will probably look like shit and no where near as neat as some on Chopcult.  HERE IS THE MAIN REASON WHY I WOULD DO ALL CUSTOM WORK MYSELF  If you use BCB it just another BCB bobber, if you make it yourself even if it looks shitty its YOURS!! Its so much cooler, I am that fascinated right now with that concept that I am actually consider de-installing my BCB seat and doing my own seat.  It'll look like shit but its going to be my one of a kind seat!  If i can give you advice, fight the urge to only go for BCB because you are itching to have that ""look"" - its way more than that."
Bobbers,2wrr89,Mangledbyatruck,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't see it that way. Good thing I'm on a budget as of now, so I'm not looking to spend too much but I want gut it as much as possible and do a nice solo seat and rear fender. Do you know if it's possible to move the front fender to the back?"
Bobbers,2wrr89,Dirtroadrocker,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutly, its been done a lot of times. It might need a bit of custom work maybe even a tiny bit of welding but they I did it before I started welding is to make a post on CC (with me its an irish board) e.g. local board and just find somebody that is willing weld a few agles on it, than you angle grind the shit out of.  I couldn't weld but really needed a sissy bar since its my daily all time all year ride (wife has the car) the biker community is really and I found a guy in the irish country side that did a cheap dirty sissy bar for me in half a day. Now I would do it myself.  Here is my bike as of now - notice all the BCB seat etc.  http://i.imgur.com/c6aAUd9.jpg  I am currently building a shadow myself and since I don't need it for work runs I can take my time.  BTW that is exactly what you HAVE to do with your first bike, spend as little money as possible, try to be an absolute cheapscate and find alternatives for everything.  What this means is   1) Way more respect from community even if it looks like shit - actually you get mad love and respect for trying alone   2) Way more fun   3) You learn way more  4) Looks unique   5) You start loving your bike so much more"
Bobbers,2wrr89,Dirtroadrocker,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:28:08 2015 UTC,Is that a Vstar? It looks nice. I really dig that rear fender. Yeah I can't wait to start grinding some things off and making brackets for parts I'm going to keep. Nice build though!

Bobbers,2vqlse,90harper,1 point,Fri Feb 20 03:51:52 2015 UTC,Looking into it now on a computer finally on the VT DMV website. Which do I apply for exactly? How to register a used vehicle in VT?
Bobbers,2vqlse,FuckShitCuntBitch,2,Fri Feb 20 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"Its been a year or so since I did this but AFAIK this is everything you need to know:  If you read the first sentence of the section labeled Vermont Titles it says 'vermont titles only vehicles 15 years old or newer', your bike is 35 and is therefor ""non-titleable"". This is your loophole.  First you need a bill of sale. I used the standard form for my state, but I've registered cars using a napkin as a bill of sale, as long as you have all the right information anything should work. ""my friend Bill"" sold me my motorcycle as I had no idea where my bike came from.  Fill out the standard registration form. If you scroll to the bottom of that form there is a sheet explaining how to fill it out. You will see that a non-titleable motorcycle over 500ccs requires a vin verification. Some people in that thread claimed they didn't bother and it still worked YMMV.   Basically since no one from the vermont DMV is ever going to see your bike, or you for that matter, they want someone to verify that your paperwork matches the bike and you are who you say you are.  You take the bike to a DMV or a garage that is approved and they compare the VIN on your bike to the VIN on your bill of sale and registration form, then hand you a piece of paper saying that they match. My DMV gave me a hard time, the first garage I went to did not. Should probably see what is required in your state I think I needed bill of sale, and a Drivers license.  That's all the paperwork. Now go back to that first link Scroll down and there is a table of registration fees. It looks like yours will be $44 for a 1 year registration. Tax is 6% of purchase price or 6% of the bluebook value whatever is higher. Should probably read for yourself I'm just skimming. I didn't bother looking up bluebook just put something reasonable down on the bill of sale because they want their taxes. If you put sale price as $1 you'll probably have a bad time I think I did $500 because that's their minimum making my tax $30  So... Bill of Sale, Registration form, Vin Verification, Check for  Registration Fee + tax cram that shit in an envelope mail it to:  Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles 120 State St Montpelier, VT 05603  Then check your mailbox/bank account compulsively to see if they cashed your check."

Bobbers,2vnsgc,Kytoaster,4,Thu Feb 12 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"Pretty much whatever colour you paint these they'll look really cool. Gloss black looks awesome on motorcycle wheels, because of the neat contrast between the browny-matt-black of the tire and the shiny pitch lack of the wheel. The older the tyre gets the more satisfying the contrast becomes. Matt black isn't such a great idea because it tends to hold on to dirt and looks worse over time. It's also not as hard wearing as gloss clear coat.  I'd advise against powdercoating though honestly, I'm really not a fan of the process. Unless the wheel is cleaned to absolute perfection, it will eventually flake and chip off. I've yet to see anything powdercoated that has stood the test of time. Decent rattlecan paint on the other hand, starting applied in layers and allowed to cure is in my experience much harder wearing. It just takes more time and can be a bit more expensive. It's more likely to survive tyre changes and small stones. Paint is also easier to remove with stripper and sand blasting.  So yeah, go for it man."
Bobbers,2vnsgc,ZombieOmNom,2,Thu Feb 12 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"Ya, I'm with you. Powdercoating is way over rated."
Bobbers,2vnsgc,Dirtroadrocker,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"Much appreciated!  I added a few photos to show roughly what I'm going for as a whole.   Do you think that wrinkle on the case covers/valve covers, with matte ceramic on the exhaust (with dei titanium wrap on headers), and gloss on all of the other chrome accessories (headlight bucket, speedo, rear fender support bars, rear shocks, lower forks), would be too many different finishes to keep it looking ""clean""?  My main goal is too keep it looking like it was an oem option, I'm afraid that many different blacks will really take away from it though."
Bobbers,2vnsgc,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"I use matt black VHT paint on headers and mufflers, followed by a coat or two of VHT clear. VHT stands for very high temperature, and is often called engine paint, or engine enamel. It comes in rattle cans and once you've done the clear the end finish is satiny sort of like the black paint you used to see on old honda engines. You can do it without the clear, but I find that what happens over time is the heat of the exhaust bakes dirt into the matt finish, and you end up with a beige-grey-black that only recovers it's original blackness if you give it another coat of paint. Matt also chips and scratches like a bitch.  Wrinkle also looks good for the first week or so, and is very hard wearing, but beware that it picks up and holds dirt in the wrinkles VERY easily. Unless you're really set on the look and don't mind the dirt/cleaning I'd skip it.  If you want gloss black shocks, buy some aftermarket ones that are gloss black. There's a special flexible coating they use for painting shock springs that works kind of like plasti-dip but is harder wearing. You'll probably find that the ride quality is significantly improved as I often find on a lot of old bikes the rear suspension is totally fucked. Trying to paint them yourself will result in tatty looking shocks a year down the line. I can recommend Forsa MDI shocks, I use these myself and they're surprisingly good for how little they cost. If you'd rather paint the shrouds on your current shocks, just paint the top section and leave the bottom chrome, otherwise as they're moving against eachother the paint will rub off.  As for the fork lowers, layer and wet-sand smooth a decent amount of primer, allow it to cure for a few days, then go for a few thick coats of matt black (thick enough that it looks like gloss paint when wet, but not so thick it runs), wet sand that smooth and allow it to cure for a good week, then start doing layer on layer on layer of clear. Use really high quality chip and scratch resistant automotive clear, the expensive bodyshop stuff. The fork lowers take an absolute beating over time so they're the one bit that you're gonna want to get a very tough finish on. You'll notice that on harleys the fork lowers have so much clear they look like glass.  So long as you take good care with your paint, retain branding, and have the occasional splash of chrome trim here and there it should look relatively oem. Once you've blacked out your engine, going with a stainless fastner kit will really dress it up and make it easier to maintain in future."

Bobbers,2vnsgc,SixGunGorilla,2,Thu Feb 12 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, they'll definitely be powdercoated.

Bobbers,2tso6l,Cmtkat,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:43:20 2015 UTC,"Very straightforward and easy. There are a few things not mentioned in the video but were fairly easy to figure out. For example, the on my C50, the video instructs you to cut off a section of the plastic battery tray on the rear of the tray. The video doesn't mention that you also need shave off a couple of vertical standing plastic pieces. If you don't do this the seat pan won't sit flush. By looking at the video again, it was obvious BCB cut those vertical tabs off as well- but it was never mentioned in the video.   Otherwise, the most time-consuming and tedious part was doing all the wiring for the new lights. The instructions were very clear on this part and are very easy (as long as you're good at following instructions)."

In my opinion the Sinnis/ Cleavlend Heist is a giant POS, American designed, Chinese built..? Yeh that seemed to work well. Not to diss chinese bikes, have one sat in my garage rusted to hell with no exhaust and it still tuns better then a Heist."

Bobbers,2tjr2p,peteydanger,2,Sun Jan 25 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"The Heist, or the Kicker kits are both viable options,  or you could buy a 250 - 500 cc jap bike and build yourself a bobber.  Bikes are a very simple way too get into diy mechanical stuff. Honda Rebels make great little bobbers and they're an ideal starter bike."
Bobbers,2tjr2p,Kytoaster,1 point,Sun Jan 25 21:48:11 2015 UTC,"Savages can be bobbed out pretty easily I believe, and there are a few kits for them floating around.  The older models can be found fairly cheap, the pre-93 four speeds aren't really a highly sought after version.  650cc, one piston and one carb to worry about.  Not huge power, but plenty of torque to get you around.  http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg291/SWThomas-Clymer/ClymerManualsSuzukiBoulevardSavageRycaRigidBobber.jpg  http://bluecollarbobbers.com/media/bcb-style/bike-gallery/suzuki/sav1.jpg  http://pictures.topspeed.com/IMG/jpg/201308/suzuki-savage-bobber-husz-01w.jpg  EDIT: I am a complete idiot.

Bobbers,2svdjo,Mangledbyatruck,2,Sat Feb 28 00:33:57 2015 UTC,They look great.  I'm going that route too.
Bobbers,2svdjo,Mangledbyatruck,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"Couple of ideas,   1) Don't black it out   2) Don't get rid of the tank but instead dish it yourself, piss easy.  3) Get rid of the indicators unless you have to keep them  4) Get some Zbars or drag bars, Zombie performance or lowbrow have some rad once  6) Small sissy bar - I use  mine ALL the time, its hard on the paint of your back fender tho, I have a rat so I don't mind.  6) Unless you plan on having a rat or I don't give a shit bike you need to work on the under the seat cables, you should be able to hide them with a gloss black plate, be creative.  7) Get rid of the Rabbit ear mirrors, I have no mirrors at all and its fine you get used to it, but if you havew to get some small end of bar mirrors if you plan on having a narrow grip bars or otherwise a single mirror that is installed below the handlebars.  Thats all I can think about right now  Edit: narrow sporty frisko tanks look good on shadows, I think they are single backbone so no issues, jsut need to get a lip on both ends and drill some holes in the frame and you are good to go."
Bobbers,2sbd2r,ggander,5,Tue Jan 13 19:58:23 2015 UTC,If it's a hardtail it'll ride kinda rough. Or if it's got drum brakes you won't be able to stop as fast and if you use just the rear brake it will lock up the back wheel. It'll be a lot slower. Bobbers are more of a custom bike that are made to the owners liking.
Bobbers,2sbd2r,samwilly67,4,Tue Jan 13 21:08:52 2015 UTC,"Never owned a crotch rocket but a bobber is meant for cruising. Letting people see the custom work you did, just going on a nice casual ride. If you want power don't get rid of your current bike"
Bobbers,2sbd2r,Goodolgator,3,Tue Jan 13 22:53:56 2015 UTC,Don't do it. Keep the sports bike and add a bobber to the collection.  Bobbers look cool and sound like they're  about to rape your wife and kill your children but compared to a sports bike they are slow as fuck and handle like shit.
Bobbers,2sbd2r,ishp2005,3,Wed Mar 18 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"I went from an 05 zx10r to a 93 honda shadow.  I still miss it a little bit, but to be honest that bike was terrifying.  I do wish the Honda had a little more oomph."
Bobbers,2sbd2r,stevenseagal777,2,Tue Jan 13 22:58:53 2015 UTC,I think the best way to do it is have one of each.  I started on a hard tail bobber. It was a little rough to daily but I loved it. It needs work now so I switched to a crotch rocket. Imo it's more comfortable for the everyday back and forth to work.  Gotta say they're both special/awesome in their own ways though.
Bobbers,2sbd2r,ShadowLTDS,2,Wed Jan 14 05:35:59 2015 UTC,"I've never owned a bobber, but I think power would definitely be something I would miss.  I have gone from a 2006 R6 to a 750 Magna to a Monster 620 and the latter two just felt really unresponsive in comparison.  I too am in love with the look of a bobber and will certainly own one in the near future, but i very much plan on having a crotch rocket as well."
Bobbers,2sbd2r,Veloqu,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:36:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the imputs guys.   What about all weather riding ? i find my crotch-rocket convenient especially in cold weather. I can duck under and try to avoid as much air as possible.  With a bobber, i fear winter trips are going to be a nightmare. But i was thinking of gearing myself a bit more in this case.  Second solution would be to build a second bike just for summer. Just need to sell that to the wife ...."
Bobbers,2sbd2r,s3b_,3,Tue Jan 13 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"I added a 1/4 fairing to my bike and a windshield to my helmet along with some other cold weather gear. Fortunately living in socal ""all weather"" riding is only a couple weeks of rain and cold nights in the winter."
Bobbers,2sbd2r,SuperTuff,2,Wed Jan 14 11:47:53 2015 UTC,"Weather can be a bitch. You can't hide behind any windshield so your body will be completely uncovered. Even your legs.   Also, driving in the rain can be shitty, because most bobbers have a short fender so the water from the street will get your back very wet. Don't drive over something you are not comfortable to have stuck on your back. ;)"
Bobbers,2sbd2r,WhiskeySlx,1 point,Wed Jan 14 07:40:03 2015 UTC,I will say that from personal experience you are going to hate your life commuting on a bobber after being on a sport bike. The handling by comparison is going to be awful. Bobbers are generally an aesthetics game rather than performance and practicality.
Bobbers,2sbd2r,SuperTuff,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:43:23 2015 UTC,"Heh, my experience is the opposite - the riding position is just infinitely more comfortable. I was on an RF600RR and went to a vulcan 800 that I bobbed (build).  A bobber can still get up and run - still be very responsive on the throttle and can still dice up traffic and pass at will....  but what you're not going to do is carve up corners. Most of the time I'd prefer the bobber, but... every once in a while I'll drag a peg on an on/off-ramp and miss the RF.  (Of course, I dropped mine a good 2"", so I have even less clearance than most)"
Bobbers,2sbd2r,peteydanger,2,Fri Jan 16 21:15:01 2015 UTC,Awesome build! I guess to be fair your experiences can differ greatly based on what machines you're working with.
Bobbers,2sbd2r,Eselkopf1,1 point,Fri Jan 16 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"I went from a GSXR 750 to my Bobber.  It took me a long time to find the right bike to be honest.  Coming off a 125hp 750cc, I had a hard time dealing with the fact that the similar dispacement V twins had less than half the power.  Eventaully I stumbled on a partialy built CB900 bobber, and that's what I went with.  It has a 100hp inline 4, sport touring forks, and I bolted up a set of Showa shocks meant for a Harley Sportster.  Does it work the way my Gixxer did?  No, but it moves out well, and it'll handle twisties decently. During the Spring/Summer/Fall I ride daily.  I don't regret giving up my sport bike, not a bit.

Why red and white? Because those were the most readily available colors for sigh painters who also pinstriped.  Bobbers history comes from racing these bikes. The bikes were stripped of all non essential items hence the extremely simple and clean looks to them. The name bobber comes from the term for ""bobbing"" the rear fender.

Bobbers,2r6o5a,FuckShitCuntBitch,1 point,Sat Jan 3 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"I cant take credit for this build. I bought it from Casa Customs in 2013 just to have something to ride. I found for me it was lacking in power, especially compared to the chopper I built lol. The only things I did do to it was a color change, rear footpegs, rear fender and bitch seat, and I also made a sissy bar. I wanted to be able to take my wife out on it. I sold it this past summer."

Bobbers,2qvdri,Robot-overlord,3,Wed Dec 31 00:56:26 2014 UTC,Sounds like a fun project to me but id offer the guy $300 with a blown motor. Worst case Ontario if the rest of the bike is decent you can part it out and make your cash back. Challenge is finding people now that want stock 83' 750 parts.   But all that said 750 is a great motor to work on and if you get in over your head a replacement is not hard to come by. Also great exhaust note out of those too when they're done up.  Best of luck and post pictures!

Bobbers,2qm84e,Slobodan600,2,Sun Dec 28 14:02:19 2014 UTC,I had an 02 vstar 650. Miss that bike a lot.
Bobbers,2qm84e,beefsuave,2,Sun Dec 28 15:08:31 2014 UTC,"I have a 2002 V-Star 650. I used a bluecollarbobber.com kit to get my bike started. I took the front fender completely off, replaced the rear fender and seat (bcb kit), a new signal kit (bcb as well) with their '34 Ford vertical license plate holder. If you're going to do their kit, bare minimum, you'll need the rear fender, seat, rear light kit and licence plate holder. It'll run you around $1200 with shipping I believe.  I'll tell you, it was a little more than I was hoping to spend, but the time it saved, and with my lack of metal working skills, it was the best place go. Everything installed in an afternoon. The wiring took the longest.  I also installed the Vance and Hines Short Shot pipes, and wrapped them in tan heat wrap to match the seat. I blacked out my air filter cover, battery cover, and storage cover by roughing then up with a high grit sandpaper and then painted with black spray paint. My next two big projects on the bike are putting on 14"" Z Bars and doing the wiring with that, as well as changing out the tank. When everything is done I'll paint the bike, but that might not happen until late next year.  Good luck to you! Feel free to PM me if you need any advice or have any questions!"
Bobbers,2qm84e,RealSaltLakeRioT,1 point,Sun Dec 28 16:03:35 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the replies, bcb has some nice products but I'm not looking to spend that much on this bike since I'm also restoring a car this winter.

Bobbers,2qm84e,peteydanger,1 point,Mon Dec 29 22:28:28 2014 UTC,"$300 is not a whole lot in the way of parts.  You could try bobbing the stock rear fender, and removing the front fender all together.  As for the seat, why not just reshape the stock pan?  Foam camp mats are super cheap and work well for padding, and the local fabric store will have some affordable vinyl or leather for wrapping.  Check out Deadbeat customs, and Lowbrow Customs for affordable plate mount brackets, taillights, mirrors and mufflers.  What do you want for bars? Apes or drag style? Drag bars are easy to make with a piece of 7/8in staight pipe.  Ape hangers you'll have to pay for.  Might be able to get a good used set for cheap though, same goes for mx bars, you should be able to get a decent used set for peanuts.  Tanks swaps are tough on V-Stars because of the frame's backbone, so I'd stick with the stocker.  V-Stars are a pretty good platform for mods.  Good luck with your build."

Bobbers,2qfiit,Mr_Death1996,3,Fri Dec 26 07:36:25 2014 UTC,could you get into more detail of the struggle? it's just I'm planning on bobbing out Yamaha xvs125 so any info would be much appreciated
Bobbers,2qfiit,hahiits,3,Fri Dec 26 14:10:43 2014 UTC,"Sorry was asleep lol, well the bike was mostly bobbed when we bought it but the guy had let the rego lapse and so we had to go through the whole process of registering it as a brand new bike to be road legal again. We had to go through and upgrade a lot of things such as add the center stop/tail light as an off center was not good enough (apparently) and also since it had V&H cruizer pipes we had to modify the baffles and add extra baffles in (ended up putting 5 in like this http://www.gadgetjq.com/vhbagger_shhh.htm) and yet they were still too loud so we ended up screwing a large custom washer to the back of the baffle with a 12mm hole (over half the diameter of the pipe) to restrict it enough to literally just scrape under the 97db limit. Also since the frame was cut in certain places we had to have a more thorough inspection to ensure it was good but in the end since it was just where the rear seat and guard was attached it was fine. Also we had to import some new ape hangers as the Z bars that were on the bike were welded (obviously to get the shape..) but we were going to have to have them xrayed to ensure that they weren't cracked or fractured internally (buying new ones looked better and was far easier). Along with this we had issues with the carbs which we thought was too lean so we got bigger jets but this made the problem worse so we went back to stock jets but with the added back pressure from the added baffles the bike goes well now. Think that's everything but ask if you want to know more"

Not a fan of the shaft drive, but that's just personal preference.  You got a plan for this yet?"
Bobbers,2qfhr1,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sat Dec 27 03:34:02 2014 UTC,Well I did want to and planed to have the twin back bones cut and a  single  welded in but the guy who was going to do it decided that it was too much for him to do right now but I'm going ahead with the build just going to use the same tank.  Single carbing it or sure!! Going to use one of the 38mm carbs for now then put a bigger one on later. Putting a harley front end on it with a raked out triple tree. Flat black or a simi gloss perhaps a distressed look to it..  And drop it as far as I can get away with. LoL  I've had a few shaft bikes and I'm building this one for a drive cross country and I really want the reliability..

Bobbers,2px8gc,Exayex,4,Sat Dec 20 22:39:45 2014 UTC,"Needing a carb cleaning is pretty common because people leave bikes sitting with gas in them, but it is also a catch all for ""doesn't run."" So I'd be hesitant with one of those unless you know what to check for, as you might need to do a little more work than they are implying before you can ride.  Most shops will do it for a couple hundred around here. I wouldn't consider it terribly difficult but if you've never touched a carb before, tuning it after cleaning might be a pain."
Bobbers,2px8gc,z6joker9,1 point,Sat Dec 20 23:01:02 2014 UTC,"I'm glad to know what ""needing a carb cleaning"" indicates.  I've seen it so much on Craigslist that I assumed it was the norm.

Bobbers,2px8gc,Jdhberger,2,Sat Dec 20 23:31:53 2014 UTC,I would look for something bigger than a 400 if your going to be running it at 75 MPH for and hour at a time.
Bobbers,2px8gc,Jdhberger,2,Sun Dec 21 02:22:16 2014 UTC,I thought so but I also read they're capable of topping out around 90 so I wasn't sure. Any recommendations on what I should look for?
Bobbers,2px8gc,ZombieOmNom,3,Sun Dec 21 02:42:05 2014 UTC,If your handy I personally would look for a Yamaha V star 650 or 1100. I have a 1100. You can take of the rear fender easy pop on a side mount licensee plate and tail light and pop on a solo seat. Only bad thing is that it has a big fat gas tank. so if your into a slimmer tank there is a lot more you have to do since the speedometer is on the tank.  http://www.yamahamotorcycleforum.com/gallery/files/1/1/3/7/9/res2108.jpg
Bobbers,2px8gc,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sun Dec 21 03:00:53 2014 UTC,"That's a great looking bike. However I'm 5'9"" and 145 pounds. Might be a little big, no?"
Bobbers,2px8gc,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sun Dec 21 03:26:14 2014 UTC,"""Needing a carb cleaning"" is usually just a sneaky way of saying ""it runs like shit and I'm not sure why"". It could be that the carbs are out of sync, the valves might need adjustment, the piston rings might be on their way out, the spark plugs might need replacing, the plug caps might be corroded, the points ignition might need looking at (if it's an older bike)... there are many things.   Also, a cb400 would cruise at 75 just fine. Really anything from a 250 upward will quite happily sit at 75 all day long. The big problem with commuting on bikes is vibration - twin cylinder and single cylinder engines being the worst, triples and inline fours are slightly smoother. An inline four won't have that annoying handlebar vibration in the mid range, which usually tends to be at about 70mph in the higher gears (ie right where you don't want it), instead you'll likely find that most of their vibration is at the low end of the rev range, and that they smooth out as the revs go higher."
Bobbers,2px8gc,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sun Dec 21 20:50:08 2014 UTC,Very informative. Thank you.  So I'm looking for a triple cylinder or inline four.  Any idea what models tended to have those so I know what I'm looking for?

The Cb400 twin had a rather primitive counterbalancer that was known for not doing a whole lot to help smooth out the vibration.

To do it right you should probably take the engine out, but if you can't or don't care, it can be done with the engine in. Just cover it up with garbage bags and mask it off. For the tank you'll want something like spraymax 2k clear that will protect the finish from gas eating it away. You can wet sand the existing paint if its in good shape, spray some primer on and then your black topcoat and then the clear."

Personally, I would recommend a Sportster with a salvage title. Reason being, a lot of Harley's get salvaged for very light damage (I bought one that was literally just dropped, resulting in a dented tank, torn seat, and broken turn signal). Because OEM HD parts are so expensive, it's often cheaper for insurance to ""salvage"" it than repair it, so it results in bikes that are easily fixed up and ridable for a lot less than normal."

BCB has one horrendously overpriced kit the merely changes the look of the rear end of the bike. Other than that and some hideously expensive aftermarket exhausts, there's a big fat nothing on the market except universal parts that will require a LOT of fabrication to fit.  You can't change the foot controls, the tank, the carbs or intake, the headlight, the handlebar controls or the battery box without serious modification.  It's probably the absolute worst machine for a beginner to work with because there's absolutely nothing you can do with it, except change the handlebars, the seat and the rear fender. If you've got the metalworking skills to make up brackets, then you may be able to fit a new headlight.  Compare that to a sportster where everything can be unbolted and a whole host of new parts bolted straight on as a direct replacement."

I don't ride 2 up obviously, and never did with it before I bobbed it so I couldn't tell ya how that is either. Removed the fenders, threw some 10"" Z bars on it($75), retro diamond groups($15), took the decals off the tank and put some PBR vinyls on it($10), switched out the stock  canister shocks for some Honda Rebel 250 shocks($85), made my seat($50), stripped front signals & swapped rears for some bullet style($20), plastdipped my lower front forks($5).

These bikes have plenty of power, but if I were you I'd swap the rear sprocket for one that'll give you a bit higher end power as they tend to sound like they're dying at higher speeds. Also, the stock seat on the ACE absolutely sucks. Some people like it. I am not one of those people. I modified the hell out of my seat with some memory foam and neoprene to make it a bit more comfy.  Other than that, these bikes are amazing. I'm 6'4"" and I still have the stock mid controls on my bike. No issue for me. Then again, I've got highway pegs, so those help a bit.  The only thing I'd caution you on is taking it through the mountains. While you'll make it through all but the most demanding of routes, you will find that the carbs tend to get a bit asthmatic and you will notice a loss in performance at higher altitudes.   Other than that, they're phenomenal machines."

Bobbers,2lvbff,Buildnotbought,1 point,Mon Nov 10 16:21:16 2014 UTC,What do you mean by their off
Bobbers,2lvbff,-Han-yolo-,2,Tue Nov 11 04:37:51 2014 UTC,The angle of your support in the middle doesn't match the the angle of the original frame member. That creates a stress point which could fail.  where your top seat rails meet the frame are mitred on a different angle than the original seat rails on the frame. And by the way it's attached I can tell that there isn't a slug in the frame to add strength to the joint. That joint will take alt of stress because that's where every jolt and vibration that your rear wheel feels ends up.  that joint needs to be beveled on both sides with about an 1/8inch gap and a slug plug welded in on both sides.  As a fabricator and a welder that tail end looks quite dangerous to me and I would not be riding it at highway speeds for sure  Don't wanna be the bearer of bad news but any failure that has to do with your seat or rear wheel could end in death pretty quickly

Seat is also an issue due to the fact I don't want a springer seat and every other seat is very expensive. Blinkers could be smaller, but I haven't found any I like.

Bobbers,2k8qn6,badger28,6,Fri Oct 24 23:14:04 2014 UTC,"Learning to ride a motorbike will involve making a lot of rookie mistakes. There's a good chance you'll drop it, and a good chance you'll have a low speed accident. Generally speaking, the more a bike weighs, the worse it will come off in either of those situations.  There's a few things you should know first about bobbers and cruisers before you start riding:   Fork rake is the angle in degrees that the forks are set relative to a vertical axis. A ""raked"" bike is one that has a wider angle on the forks - an extreme example would be an OCC chopper. Wide/long rakes cause slow steering, but are more stable at speed, and the shallow/short rakes you find on sports bikes are much quicker steering, but prone to instability at speed (which is why they fit steering dampers). Anything inbetween is called a ""neutral"" rake, and you usually find this on sportsters or ""universal"" street bikes. The XS650 that is often used for bobbing has a neutral rake. Many cruisers and bobbers have ""forward controls"". These are footpegs and foot controls set far in front of the rider, so that the rider has more of a straight leg. Mid controls are set around the halfway point, usually directly under the rider, or slightly in front. Rearsets are set slightly behind the rider, and are usually found on sportier bikes because they give improved ground clearance while cornering, and aid in the racing ""tuck"" position. Wide rake and forward controls are not your friend when you're learning to ride. They cause the steering to be slow, and the footpegs will grind on the road surface even in a moderate lean. This can startle a new rider or cause them to steer too wide; both of these scenarios have killed a lot of riders. Mid controls will allow you to stand up on the footpegs if you're about to run over a pothole or a bump, and will allow you to shift your bodyweight around the centre of the bike, which is better for cornering. They'll also have better ground clearance, and since they require a bent knee, will have slightly better ergonomics for a taller rider. Many cruisers and large capacity engined motorcycles are heavy. Aside from the obvious fact that if you drop it you'll have a hard time picking it up, a heavy bike also brakes a lot less sharply. It is likely to have beefier brakes to compensate for this; however a novice has a tendency to panic and ""grab"" the brakes, particularly the front, and beefier calipers have an easier time locking up the wheels. You're more likely to get into a situation where you panic and grab the brakes if you're on a bike that brakes more slowly. Lightweight bikes are your friend, in other words. You'll want to aim for something 175kg wet weight (meaning including fuel and oil) or less. Riding hardtail (no rear suspension) as a first bike is not smart. When you hit a bump, the suspension will rebound and be dampered, keeping the wheel in contact with the ground. It is SO easy to lock up the rear wheel on a hardtail, you would not believe. Roads are nowhere near as flat and smooth as they look, and when you're rolling over that on a hardtail, the rear wheel will be airborne a lot more often than you realise. Since an airborne wheel has no rolling resistance, the brake has a pretty easy time bringing it to a total stop. When it touches down again, the wheel won't be moving, and you'll go straight into a slide. Easy as pie to control if you're used to it, but I've seen it trip up more than a few newbies. Therefore, cool as it may look, I'd advise against hardtails. Tall handlebars such as ""ape hangers"" are a really bad idea for novice riders as they are far harder to control, particularly at low speeds. They also place high leverage forces on the risers (handlebar clamps) that hold them in place, meaning if you yank on them a little too hard, the clamps won't keep them in place. Many a rider has ended up with their handlebars in their lap or rolled way forward, because the risers weren't able to cope with the tall bars. Low handlebars will give you far superior control over the bike, as well as giving you a forward leaning stance that will make a taller rider look more in proportion with the bike.   Being 300lbs, you're going to want not only an engine that can cope with your weight, but also a comfy seat and good suspension. You will probably find that the 600cc midweight range of cruisers have adequate power. A Harley Davidson 883 sportster would probably be a perfect fit for you, or alternatively a Yamaha XS650. Both have good aftermarket parts support, and several options to get the ergonomics perfect without any major modifications."

Bobbers,2ih194,ChainSWray,2,Tue Oct 7 08:33:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks! This was my first ever build. It took about 2 months mostly because I chased my tail allot. Cost is hard because I invested in new tools, bike lift etc. However I can tell you I spent. $250 (Panic Cycle) on the seat and $100 on the tank (Perfect, no dents; quite the steal) $75 on the 6"" fender (JP Cycle) $30 air pod, $160 new 18/38 sprocket and chain. $50 pipe wraps. Everything else I'd ballpark at about $200-300. Total cost: About $900 From back and Other Side My buddy and his Shadow  Edit: The thing tied to the sissy bar is a hoodie folded up on itself.  Edit 2: I also gained allot of horsepower! Cut off the EPA shit, wrapped pipes, bigger jets, air pod and less weight make this thing get up and go!"

Bobbers,2hao9q,ZombieOmNom,2,Wed Sep 24 12:20:14 2014 UTC,"Everyone is assuming you live in the US, but you're actually Australian. This means you have a few bikes on the market that have a lot of Japanese aftermarket support, because the Aussie licensing is similar to Japan. These bikes include the 125, 250, and 400cc cruisers from Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki and Kawasaki.  A lot of parts are available on ebay and from Japan (you might have to use google translate). These bikes are solid, well made, easy to bob, and don't cost too much. They have engines that are powerful enough to have fun with, but the bikes aren't so heavy or powerful that you'll get yourself in trouble.  A word of caution, the ""bobbed"" look isn't really something you can get entirely using aftermarket parts. You can swap a fuel tank, or a headlight. There are also some generic universal fitment parts such as sidemount number plate and tail light brackets, 22mm metric handlebars, solo seats, etc. But to really get the best look you'll have to do a bit of modification yourself. That's really part of the fun of bobbing and custom bikes anyway though.  Do a budget build on a small displacement motorcycle first, learn to ride it, then move up to a Harley sportster when you've got the money and the experience.

Bobbers,2hao9q,autoposting_system,1 point,Sun Sep 28 02:13:22 2014 UTC,"Honda CB750.  You can't go wrong. Get one of the later ones: DOHC. I think the switch was in 1979, so anything after that. If you want to look into it, start with the Wikipedia article. It's great.  Huge production, many many parts, cheap, reliable, powerful enough (okay, it's not a liter or whatever but for god's sake its nickname is ""The First Superbike"", and it's a four), and it's got that classic UJM shape; you could make a bobber or a cafe or a scrambler or a super rat or whatever.  Shit, people have put turbos on them.  The CB750 is the perfect bike for what you're describing."
Bobbers,2hao9q,climbingrocks,1 point,Wed Sep 24 15:21:53 2014 UTC,Why do you recommend the DOHC over the SOHC?
Bobbers,2hao9q,autoposting_system,2,Wed Sep 24 16:01:52 2014 UTC,"As far as I can tell, the DOHC pros and cons outweigh the SOHC pros and cons. DOHCs have better performance, but only marginally. SOHCs have better reliability, but only possibly (kind of depending on who you talk to). The real advantage the SOHC has is that it's prettier, which is a matter of opinion, and on top of that the guy's apparently going to heavily customize this machine, so you'll see a bunch of that before you notice the shape of the valve cover and the cylinder head, so that benefit is kind of negated.  No, the only really serious advantage here is parts. There were WAY more DOHC motors produced than SOHC. This guy is going to be looking for parts, and maybe buying used, and used DOHC parts are (a) more common and (b) newer.  So that's just my $.02. It's really a matter of opinion, and this guy hasn't developed one yet, so until he does I'm just going with practical considerations. Entirely a matter of opinion anyway."

Buddy has had and done a bunch of Kawasaki 3/4 & 1 liter bikes, I've done a few Suzuki the same size.  Always wanted to do a small Honda. So, my son and I are doing a CB77 Super Hawk up as bobber, cafe racer. Nice simple clean bike, small displacement, easy to work on, great starter bike, electric and kick starter, most parts are still available, once the electrics are cleaned up it should be a very reliable bike.

Bobbers,2gvlly,BethesdaBlue,3,Fri Sep 19 17:21:00 2014 UTC,post some pics!  Also what state are you getting inspected in?
Bobbers,2gvlly,txroller,1 point,Fri Sep 19 21:21:08 2014 UTC,"MD inspection. It'll take some work to be road legal, and a little more work to look decent, but she's mine and she's my first major purchase.  Here's more pics of her, she's got a little over 4000 miles:  http://imgur.com/a/JIVcE  Sorry for the bad quality pics... Its got straight pipes Speedo mounted on the right side No longer a softtail, but the back looks unfinished. I'm planning on changing out the rusted metal that the seat is on, then making a bracket to fit into where it looks chopped off and possibly mounting another brake light there. And then hide all the exposed wires under the seat with some covers.   Also, I'll probably need a different size front rim if I wanted to put a white wall in front too, my front tire size has no whitewalls that I can find."
Bobbers,2gvlly,txroller,1 point,Fri Sep 19 21:49:35 2014 UTC,I like it and wouldn't stress the details.  Bobbers are supposed to be a little rough around the edges. Am planing on doing something like this myself.  The black is great.  I plan to go drag bars but everything else the same.  Have you seen that spray coating (I think Rustoleum) that you spray Rust and it turns it Black?

Bobbers,2gvlly,77Yamachop,7,Fri Sep 19 22:14:13 2014 UTC,"Congratulations on answering the question in the douchiest way possible buddy.  Make your bike however you want. If you don't want fenders, don't use them. Although, why anyone would want to ride without fenders is beyond me. Just remember they can still ticket you for all the shit you tear off after it passes inspection. Everything else you asked is pretty much your personal preference. Go to one of the huge parts stores online and browse their shit until you find some stuff you like."
Bobbers,2gvlly,gar187er,3,Fri Sep 19 18:07:42 2014 UTC,"No need to go crazy, I'm here because I want to learn, not piss people off. I was planning on putting a bobbed rear fender on, the guy I bought it from said that he used a quarter fairing from the front of a buell blast and mounted it back there. But I was under the impression that word bobber stood for bobbed fenders, which means rocks can still fly. I never really thought of rocks too much before your comment and I appreciate you pointing it out, as I said, I'm learning."
Bobbers,2gvlly,gar187er,2,Fri Sep 19 18:51:48 2014 UTC,"No matter what you do, you'll piss someone off. That guys' an asshole and his corvette is probably a giant piece of shit that he prides more than the kids he'll never have.  Maryland has some serious laws as far as requirements for passing inspection. In Va, it's a lot more lax, if you have turn signals, they have to work, if you don't, that's what you have arms for and it passes. Read up on the minimum requirements for the state inspection and make it happen.  Personally, avoid the model A tail light, every bobber in the country uses them. Get creative, French an LED strip into the rear fender, it'll clear up the rear end and you'll be able to see it just as well if not better than one of the Model A's.  Like Citytitty said though, browse parts online until you find what you like and make it your own,...you aren't in it to make assholes like banmeagainuhippie happy while they are cruising in the car."

Bobbers,2g95g4,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sat Sep 13 02:52:59 2014 UTC,"The problem with swapping a throttle to the left hand side, is obviously it twists the wrong way. If you swap the cables around so that they cross over once, the throttle will work backwards. Your existing throttle body may have a ""throttle stop"" on it, on the other hand it may not and might just rely on the throttle stop on the carb.  If it has no throttle stop, and you mount the pull cable on the push side, and then mount it on the left side of your handlebars, then it will work. :)"

Bobbers,2fxxyi,WhenIVoteIUPVote,1 point,Wed Sep 10 01:33:55 2014 UTC,There are people on ebay who just make custom bars all day long. You should try that first because it's usually way cheaper.
Bobbers,2fv6o9,theotherone23,3,Tue Sep 9 01:36:31 2014 UTC,"Generally speaking it's actually easier to work with new parts than to turn a used bike into something decent. A rolling chassis is usually built to take a specific donor engine with specific model years. They can be fairly expensive but require very minimal fabrication and welding, if any.  The rest is all a matter of fitting your desired tank, seat, lights, wiring it all up, and adding finishing touches like foot controls, hand grips, fenders, etc.  There's more wrenching and painting involved. So long as you have a good working engine, good working carbs, and engine bolts that come undone without much issue, then it will be a nice easy build. If you buy a donor bike rather than a donor engine, you'll also end up with a whole bunch of spare parts that you can put on ebay. Sometimes the parts individually amount to more than the complete bike is worth.  So basically I'd say go for it."
Bobbers,2fv6o9,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Tue Sep 9 02:35:35 2014 UTC,Thanks for your insight.  Right now its the fear of the unknown and wondering if I am overlooking anything that we couldn't handle.  Between the two of us I don't see why we couldn't take on anything it would throw at us...including the painting.  I'm thinking if I start with a brand new rolling chassis and brand new engine the odds of us running in to speedbumps will be minimized...which is important because I'm not trying to stress out my newly retired Dad in doing this ;)
Bobbers,2fv6o9,ZombieOmNom,2,Tue Sep 9 02:55:32 2014 UTC,"Haha yeah, the only issue I can see with brand new engine on top of brand new rolling chassis is just cost. If you're looking at an S&S engine you're talking 8 grand before you go anywhere. You can quite easily buy an entire good Harley for the same money and have a bunch of parts left over that you can make money back on by selling them on ebay."
Bobbers,2fv6o9,truckerdadpunk,2,Tue Sep 9 05:00:26 2014 UTC,"exactly, you can still get an old shovel or iron pretty reasonably, i just bought a shovel for $4500 running. then you can put on a hard tail kit or buy a rigid frame and then choose tanks, fenders, etc. craigslist is your friend!"

Bobbers,2fhiak,KirbyinAustin,3,Thu Sep 4 20:10:56 2014 UTC,"If you hard tail it, it will attach to the hard tail and the fender. If its still a swing arm when you get there, it will attach to the fender struts."

I realize the motor is close to the front tire but there was no extra room to move the motor further back in the frame.  In the future, I want to upgrade the forks and in doing so I will add a few more degrees of rake to make some space between the tire and head.  Also, I realize the stock brakes are lousy and undersized, that's also something that will be addressed as the build continues.  As it stands the motor is in, the bike is wired and I have a few odds and ends to sort before it's maiden shake-down run.  Then, as you all know, disassemble, chop/fab/build, ride, repeat."

Along the way I bought new grips, bulbs, kickstarter, bicycle speedo, chain, and other little bits and bobs for about £140. I painted it at my work and just had to pay £30 for the actual paint. So in total it was only £300 - £330 or so."

The bike in your photo is an 1100 classic with stock wheels.  The ""oldschool"" style is to have a 16"" rim front and back, and something like a 130 front and a 150 rear. The vstar classic has a 130/90-16 front and a 170/80-15 rear. So it's visually very much an oldschool look.  You should be able to find some used wheels on ebay."

Bobbers,2dkbg2,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Fri Aug 15 20:21:41 2014 UTC,"Motorcycle wheels don't use lugs, they use a spindle and bearings. So long as the spindle diameter and hub width and such are the same then the wheels will fit. Since the only difference between the models with spoked and cast wheels is the wheels, everything else is the same and they're a straight swap.  EDIT: I should probably mention that this only applies to this specific model of bike. You can't fit wheels from a different make or model without machining up some spacers so that the disc will fit into the caliper correctly, and the spindle will fit into the hub and between the forks."
Bobbers,2dkbg2,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sat Aug 16 02:57:31 2014 UTC,I just found a spoke front wheel on ebay and it says that it fits 2000-2009 custom and 99-03 classic. Will this not fit the 07 classic then?  edit: Also thanks. I feel like a chicken with my head cut off on this stuff.
Bobbers,2dkbg2,ZombieOmNom,2,Sat Aug 16 03:27:45 2014 UTC,"The custom has a skinny front wheel, so yes it will probably fit but it won't be the look you're after. The classic is the one you want.  Here you go.  And another.  And a rear wheel."

That bar across the bottom should angle down and back, level like this is ok, but a proper geometry springer should ride almost as smooth as a shock system.  If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me, just wanted to help if I could.  Other than that- damn she's sexy!"
Bobbers,2cqxns,mmm_dumplings,7,Wed Aug 6 02:03:39 2014 UTC,"I personally don't like springer seats on bikes with shocks. The springer seat is necessary on a hard tail, but it seems kind of redundant and fake on a modern sportster. Something like the non-spring kit from here would look good, I think.  You can also chop the rear frame and mount the fender to the swingarm to get that close to the tire fender look a lot of rigid bobbers have. Heres a few examples of what that looks like: Photo 1, Photo 2  I'd also remove the reflectors on the fork and on the rear fender. If you want to retain the visibility from them, put some retroreflective tape on your rims."

Bobbers,2cqxns,far2common,2,Thu Aug 7 01:35:30 2014 UTC,"Start small. Personally, I'd probably start with a solo saddle. Decide if you need to carry a pillion. Decide if you're eventually going to go hard tail. It should be relatively easy/cheap to grab some struts and try out hard tail. After lowering my bike, I eventually did and love it. If you're going to keep the suspension avoid a sprung saddle. It feels... weird imho.   After the seat, I'd work on cleaning up the back end. Brake light and turn markers need to go, if only to be replaced by something more paletable. Maybe some sort of license plate relocation. Check local regulations, vertical plates aren't legal where I live.   take it slow and have fun!"
Bobbers,2cqxns,oscar2hot4u,1 point,Wed Aug 6 04:42:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I'm going to avoid the struts for now. Just ordered the drag bars and will do that first.

Cause that should be the first purchase otherwise. :-)   So I know its already a low, but it looks like you need MOAR low. You really should be flat footed while riding to be the most comfortable. So I would get some lowering springs.   Burley Slammer kit is a less expensive option. http://www.burlybrand.com/slammerblack/index.aspx Progressive also sells kits. (easy to find on JP Cycles)  Also agree that the springer seat. Rich Phillips is a great choice.  Not a single picture of the right side of your bike. But I bought a bunch of separate little kits to clean up the sides of my bike. I moved the horn to the front of the bike. Cleaned up the coil pack. Relocated the carb choke to the right side. (You don't have). Also made a custom air cleaner and bought the parts to remove the old one. (Breather bolts etc)   You can chop the rear fender or get one of the many kits on ebay. Your bike is black, so saves you a lot on paint.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/EASYRIDERS-SHORT-BOBBED-REAR-FENDER-HARLEY-SPORTSTER-XL-04-06-10-UP-BOBBER-CAFE-/331280633933?pt=Motorcycles_Parts_Accessories&hash=item4d21dd504d&vxp=mtr  TC bro's is a good spot for Harley chopper/Bobber parts.

Also I'm usually able to flat-foot, but I think it was maybe just the shorts didn't give me enough mobility to stretch my legs out. I forgot to mention, but I did relocate the coil and ignition. Other than that, I haven't messed with the air filter or exhaust. I'll have to do more research on how that affects the air/fuel mixture and how to deal with it for the EFI. And thanks for suggesting the off-the-shelf bobber fender. Didn't realize that existed. For now, I just ordered the drag bars, so I'll see where it goes after that!"

Bobbers,2c3syu,rebeldefector,1 point,Wed Jul 30 03:06:46 2014 UTC,"Very nice! Here's a slightly higher res version  Possibly ceramic coated pipes... ceramic exhaust coating is marketed as one of those magical HP boosting tricks that supposedly make your engine run better, but I can't afford it so I have no personal experience in the matter.  Evidently it has due to with thermal conductivity and insulation, holding heat in... the less heat dissipation in your exhaust, the more the exhaust fairies want to escape, increasing exhaust velocity and flow, thereby increasing ""scavenging""... but all wikipedia says is that it helps with heat management, keeping intake air temperatures low in cars.  Also lowers the chance of burning your leg, I guess.  I'm no expert, but I agree... I love the white pipes."

Bobbers,2bsyl8,Robofetus-5000,2,Sat Jul 26 20:19:13 2014 UTC,if you can't make your own you can always go to an exhaust/bike shop and ask them what you want and they can do it for you. if not look up your bikes exhaust options and whats out on the market. usually 2-1 has better performance due to the collection of fumes into the one pipe. as for paint i did mine with high temp engine paint and then wrapped them myself no problem. chopped welded painted and wrapped all in a day.
Bobbers,2bsyl8,yayger_82,1 point,Sat Jul 26 20:40:29 2014 UTC,Thanks man! Not really any shops where I live so buying pre done pipes is probably where I'll end up. That high temp paint over chrome is cool? I'm obviously very inexperienced. A lot of the pipes that were the normal 2 pipes seemed easy to wrap but the 2 into 1 has the flair out at the end. Do you wrap that too?
Bobbers,2bsyl8,yayger_82,1 point,Sat Jul 26 20:51:15 2014 UTC,"You can paint what ever you want man, if it starts to fade or chip then you re-apply when needed. once you start these projects you don't go back so just be ready for that. With the pipe wrap most of the time its just the header that it wrapped. the reason for that is so the exhaust is a few degrees cooler when exiting the motor and creating a better flow meaning better peer and response. that being said you can wrap what ever you want or what looks best in your eyes. wrapping a tip or slip on etc is kinda pointless but its your bike and your project. get two rolls try it out see what fits."
Bobbers,2bsyl8,yayger_82,1 point,Tue Jul 29 03:12:01 2014 UTC,"honestly, I just like the way it looks. I'm naive as to the function of the wrap other than it possibly protecting you from burning your leg."

Bobbers,2bsyl8,ZombieOmNom,2,Tue Jul 29 03:14:11 2014 UTC,"2-into-1 exhaust systems are advantageous because they reduce weight and improve scavenging and exhaust flow. This can be combined with a high performance silencer/muffler, increased jet sizes and high flow air filters for some considerable gains in horsepower and torque. For an engine the size of the 1100, a 20hp gain is not unusual.  Building an exhaust system is not especially difficult. Exhaust kits featuring mandrel bends of varying degrees are available, and require little more than an angle grinder, a few different shapes of file, and a mig welder. If you don't feel confident doing it yourself, most auto shops that do custom exhaust work can make up a basic 2 into 1 exhaust for you for comparitively little money. You'll need to have a bracket made up to secure the end of the exhaust to the frame, otherwise the weight of the pipes will be supported only by the engine which isn't good.  You can have black pipes if you prefer, you just need some VHT paint. If you build a set of pipes or have some built, they'll be in raw steel which will have to be finished by either chroming or painting. If they're stainless, then they won't rust but they will ""blue"" with the heat.  I'd strongly advise avoiding off-the-shelf aftermarket exhaust products, as they're normally hideously expensive and the styling is usually aimed exclusively at the cruiser market. Bobbers are more the lightweight antidote to ponderous cruisers, so unless you're prepared to hack the bulky silencers and heat shields off a $1500 exhaust system, I'd avoid that option entirely.  There are a few other simple changes you can make to reduce weight and get the more streamlined bobber look. Ditching the stock headlight for a smaller unit will give you a small weight saving, as will removing the fork covers if you have them. There is a kit you can buy to convert the vstar from a twin to a single SU carb, which would allow you to mount a smaller sportster style tank - this is a double whammy weight saving. There's a lot you can do on these bikes depending on how far you're willing to go and how big your budget is."
Bobbers,2bsyl8,ZombieOmNom,2,Sun Jul 27 00:32:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for all the info. The off the shelf exhaust I have been looking at have been in the $400-500 range. Something like this  http://www.amazon.com/04-09-YAMAHA-XVS11A-Cobra-Exhaust/dp/B000I5AISQ/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1406424226&sr=8-10&keywords=cobra+exhaust+vstar+1100  or   http://www.amazon.com/Cobra-Speedster-Exhaust-Yamaha-VStar/dp/B000WP1O0S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1406424226&sr=8-1&keywords=cobra+exhaust+vstar+1100  I do appreciate the advice of the custom pipes, but I'm really not sure anywhere around here will do that. I live in Oxford MS (currently visiting in Florida) and there just doesn't seem anyone like that around here. I'll definitely take into account all the other stuff you said as well. Switching out the head light and taking off the fork covers sounds good too. Thanks again for your help.  edit: by the way, I really do like the idea of the custom exhaust from a shop. I will be calling around when I get back into town, I'm just not optimistic. I'll let you know how I fair."
Bobbers,2bsyl8,ZuluPapa,2,Sun Jul 27 01:26:11 2014 UTC,"Oxford is about an hour drive from Memphis, which has quite a few custom shops that do exhaust fabrication. That'd be your best bet if you want something specific.  The vstar doesn't lend itself well to customising, and as a result there aren't really many products out there for it. There are a few cool builds that have been done with them though. This is one of my favourites. Scroll down to the ""back alley brawler""."
Bobbers,2bsyl8,ZombieOmNom,2,Sun Jul 27 02:33:20 2014 UTC,what kind of info would they need from me about doing a custom exhaust? Obviously I am naive at all of this. Thanks again!
Bobbers,2bsyl8,ZuluPapa,3,Sun Jul 27 02:47:39 2014 UTC,"They'd ask you what kind of style you want, what material (stainless, mild steel, etc) where you envisage the pipes going, etc. If you plan on fitting a muffler, you'll need to know the ID (inside diameter) of the muffler, so that they will be able to fit the correct OD (outside diameter) final tube so that the muffler slips right on with no leaks. So for instance if it's a muffler for a 45mm pipe, they'll need to know that so they can make sure the end of the pipe is 45mm.   They would need you to drop the bike off and leave it with them. They'd get some mandrel bends and some straight tube in the correct size, fabricate the 2-into-1 join (called the merge) and tig weld it all together. They'd build it around the bike so that it fits perfectly. Once it's done they'd call you and tell you to come pay the bill and pick up your bike.  Most shops are used to dealing with people who are new to the subject, so they'll be able to help you through the process. Once they see the bike, and you describe to them what you want, they'll be able to figure out the job and give you a rough estimate price. They may even be able to give you a straight quote. Depending on where you go you may be able to get a full system including muffler and tuning, or they may be willing to do only the pipe fabrication and leave the rest up to you."

Bobbers,2ajqgc,fosiacat,7,Sun Jul 13 16:44:45 2014 UTC,"right, so what of your fucking full dresser with a solo seat is a bobber? nothing.  www.bobberinspiration.com if you'd like to look at some examples of a real bobber. that's a good site with good examples.   full sized foot pads, huge mirrors, turn signals, and a 50 gallon tank is not a bobber.  so no, im not a ""d-bag trolling"" -- im someone that is sick of how this sub went to shit after every fucking moron in the world with a honda or yamaha with no fender decided they now have a ""bobber"" because bobbers are now ""cool"".  and instead of clipping the one part that you can speak to, post the rest of that  The bobber was the earliest simple and stripped down custom motorcycle hand-built by individuals with mechanical skills, and was often part of the early biker clubs scene before there were any such things as choppers.[2] This style of custom motorcycle, which took shape in the 1940s and 50s,[3] is generally thought to have been started by returning WWII American servicemen working on ex-military motorcycles, and inspired by lighter European motorcycles they had seen and ridden.[4] When bobbers were first created, the intent was not to create a new type of motorcycle or sub-genre, the idea was to keep motorcycles on the road as cheaply as possible  what on earth are you fucking talking about, bobber? you have a full dressed bike with a solo seat. there is nothing custom about it, there is nothing hand built about it, there is nothing about weight reduction, nothing. you took a stock bike and you put a different fucking seat on it. next you'll buy a ""kit"" for some other garbage."
Bobbers,2ajqgc,yankerage,2,Sun Jul 13 16:58:24 2014 UTC,"Old bikes vibrated and needed lots of adjustment and repair.  It broke,got taken apart and rattly bits that weren't mechanically necessary was deleted, cracked fenders were shortened or bobbed. That's all."
Bobbers,2ajqgc,fosiacat,-2,Sun Jul 13 20:05:22 2014 UTC,"Lol you must be pleasant to ride with. Keep up the attitude, I'm sure you make a lot of friends that way. And thanks for policing the bobbers sub reddit, you're doing gods work and it's a great use of your time."
Bobbers,2ajqgc,muffinman5423,5,Sun Jul 13 17:07:37 2014 UTC,"no, im just using the already well established definition of a style of bike. it's not something that you just make up as you go along. if i want to see a stock bike, ill look at stock bikes. if i want to see a bobber, ill look at bobbers. if i say to someone (that knows motorcycles) ""bobber"" they know what i mean, just as if i say ""full dresser"" they know what i mean, which is basically what this is, again, except with a solo seat. don't be pissed and whiny because you have no other response to someone who is correct, especially using your own definition page."
Bobbers,2ajqgc,NegraMuerte,3,Sun Jul 13 19:08:19 2014 UTC,"""superfluous parts removed to reduce weight."" This is one of the most important things when I think about bobbers. You have a start but a lot of pieces need to be removed before it's a bob."
Bobbers,2ajqgc,gar187er,2,Mon Jul 21 18:31:00 2014 UTC,"congrats, welcome, Why did you make the switch?"
Bobbers,2ajqgc,Kinect2,3,Sun Jul 13 06:56:18 2014 UTC,My dad started riding and bought his first bike 2 years ago.  I wanted something more comfortable so we can get out together more often.
Bobbers,2ajqgc,WhiskeySlx,2,Sun Jul 13 07:10:58 2014 UTC,You need to take off way more then the fender to be called a bobber....that bike has soooo many extra parts in it.

Bobbers,2afec1,fosiacat,1 point,Fri Jul 11 20:14:36 2014 UTC,"You get better with time, I have been buying a lot from Blue Collard Boobers as well which gave me the confidence todo most of the stuff myself next time. I totally understand the fact that some people don't want to compromise their bike if they feel they are not up for the task, mine is my daily ride and I ride all year so I have no margin for error.  Here is mine for the moment, http://imgur.com/tA1vOGk  I am shockingly bad in anything DIY so no suprise that the front fender is fucking shit, that the Balkenkreutz is shit, that a lot of other stuff on the bike that I did myself (handlebars) are shit but... I've done these things myself so I am in a weird way proud of them even if they only ""look good"" from far away. Rest is of course Blue Collard bobber.  Future plan... Sissy bar (which I will fuck up), Rattle can blacking out (which will look shit, guaranteed) bullet lights which will be easy to install.  Also I am currently just bolting shit on the bike that I like, for excample have an old belt buckle from Bounty hunter inc, just put that on the gas lid, fuck it, looks like shit but its something I like.  I encourage you to just stop giving a fuck and just... do it..  Edit: Also modded the Stock pipes with the infamouse 4hole mod, sounds a lot better but I am still going to cut the exhaust and make it loud as fuck."
Bobbers,2afec1,fatlace,1 point,Mon Jul 14 09:56:17 2014 UTC,"True that. Thanks man. Your bike and mine have the same style so far. I think my next purchase will be new pipes, but right now I'm more interested in doing something about the rust. Specially the engine. I wonder how much it would cost to chrome it."

Bobbers,2aeuy7,DrBeefyEUW,1 point,Fri Jul 11 09:12:17 2014 UTC,"For between $15 and $40 you can get a trailer fender, which look great on bobbers. It's not a slick, bolt on part like the BCB fender, but you can buy a lot of Harbor Freight tools to help fab it up relatively easy."
Bobbers,2aeuy7,jbrtwork,0,Fri Jul 11 17:48:40 2014 UTC,"Your bike already has fenders, doesn't it? Why don't you learn to turn them into what you want.  It should be called a Bolter, not a Bobber, at this point."
Bobbers,2aeuy7,Pacsh,7,Fri Jul 11 11:39:18 2014 UTC,"don't be so arrogant maybe he doesn't have the tool or the knowhow to get his fender to look like what he wants, not everbody is a custom genius like yourself.  OP: three options. You can go to lowbrow customs and many other webpages and get yourself a ""clean"" fender, you probably have todo some bending and custom work to get it to fit the shadow.  Second: Go http://bluecollarbobbers.com/catalog/shadow-600-400  And get yourself a fender that is pretty much tailor made for the shadow.  Lowbrow option - cheap but can be trickier to get to work. BlueCollar Bobber: Great product as in quality, but very pricy, amazing customer service, comes with DVD how to install, SUPER easy to install.  Be careful, if you want a bobber fender that usual means you need to relocate the indicators, breaklights, numberplate and in most cases you need a new seat.  Third option - Which is what Pacsh talked about. Buy yourself an angle grinder, take the back or front fender off, mark were you want to cut, cut it down, sand it down and take the edge off, repeat until you are happy with the product.  Third option is by far the cheapest (angle grinder costs like 20 bucks) and also the most satisfying since its YOUR bike, also you learn on the way."
Bobbers,2aeuy7,fosiacat,-2,Fri Jul 11 15:11:38 2014 UTC,"don't be so arrogant maybe he doesn't have the tool or the knowhow to get his fender to look like what he wants, not everbody is a custom genius like yourself.   then you learn. that is what a bobber is. it's not ""how much money can i spend to make a bike look cool"" it's ""how much can i get away with with spending as little money as possible."" -- learn your history.   the answer is you build them, you salvage something and retrofit, you make it work. if you're just going to buy parts and put it on a bike, it doesn't belong in /r/bobbers, and don't call it a bobber."

Bobbers,2a7tpb,2seannh7,6,Wed Jul 9 05:51:52 2014 UTC,"Who made it for you? What kind of bike is it?  I'm also embarrassed to admit I spent a few too many minutes trying to figure out what that second headlight right above your tire was, before I realized it is the bus's wheel.  Also, no rear suspension and no springer saddle? You're a brave individual."
Bobbers,2a7tpb,dteeban,1 point,Wed Jul 9 07:45:41 2014 UTC,"My father made it, he lives in NY and I live in WA. It's a custom frame with a Revtech 100, cammed and 40 carb, 240 rear. The first thing on the list is a springer seat, but I knew the deal going in that it was going to be a rough ride."

Bobbers,2a7xra,DrBeefyEUW,7,Wed Jul 9 06:56:09 2014 UTC,"Aren't bobbers kinda supposed to look boring? Stripped down, flat black, and white walls."
Bobbers,2a7xra,robosmrf,1 point,Wed Jul 9 15:44:55 2014 UTC,"A bobber doesn't look ""boring"" just by virtue of being a bobber. Your definition is a hot-rod look and is no way a good description of a bobber, but what you describe has been way overdone. Bobbers are at their core a chopper without rake, with a style that pays homage to the original bobbed harleys of the late 40's early 50's. That's pretty goddamn open ended.   If the builder has any talent then it can really stand out as a beautiful motorcycle. Sure the blue collar cookie cutter bobbers are boring because they don't really do anything interesting and have very awkward lines because they haven't really been built from the ground up. Every popular genre of custom motorcycle has the boring copycats.  The best way to avoid a boring looking bike is to avoid the tropes and cliches. Avoid Z bars, apes, springer seats, forward controls, drag bars, wide tanks, sportster tanks, fat tyres, slab yokes, chrome, sweep pipes, white walls, skulls, flames, US Army stars, flat black, tall risers, etc.  Instead, try to look at historical cross-genre inspiration, dirt bikes, flat track, racing bikes, the frisco scene, the japanese custom style, brat style, shinya kimura. Try to distill the essence of what a bike means to you, and build something around that. Or maybe go the other way and look to the future, think dystopia, terminator, blade runner.  Whatever you do, try to avoid things you see most often. Everyone loves the underdog, particularly if it looks cool."
Bobbers,2a7xra,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sun Sep 14 23:02:30 2014 UTC,in this sub a full dresser w/ a solo seat = bobber
Bobbers,2a7xra,fosiacat,-3,Sat Jul 12 22:21:57 2014 UTC,Bobbers only come in kits.
Bobbers,2a7xra,robosmrf,2,Sat Jul 12 23:33:16 2014 UTC,"Well, if you can afford a set of bars like that for $339 you can do whatever you like to it.  Search around and get some ideas rolling. Mix it up and make it your own. Theme it some how. What do you like? Take some ideas from painters and tweak it a little. Sometimes a little grafix or pin striping can go a long way."
Bobbers,2a7xra,Lopakalolo,1 point,Wed Jul 9 08:32:49 2014 UTC,Well i am not going to buy exactly those z bars. Same style but different company. Definetely not going to pay 339$ i was too lazy searching for cheaper ones i guess.  i would love to have a little graphic on the left and right side of my tank. i thought about something like a yggradsil or a compass in pirate-style but im afraid that those would look childish as hell but i guess in the end its about me liking it or disliking it.  Also im not sure if it would look better as a sticker or an airbrush and if i should put on some flat black color on my tank or a regular shiny one.
Bobbers,2a7xra,V8titanpwr,1 point,Thu Jul 10 07:17:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah fuck me, like someone else said, if you can afford Roland Sands gear on your bobber, you can take it to a shop and tell them to make it look badass."
Bobbers,2a7xra,yankerage,1 point,Wed Jul 9 12:08:41 2014 UTC,I think it looks neat when they have external oil filters and cyl head temp gauges.

Bobbers,2a7xra,jbrtwork,1 point,Thu Jul 10 06:12:12 2014 UTC,"I think my favorite thing about bobbers is how an owner can do some simple, unique thing that makes a difference from all the others. I had a V-Star classic that I made into kind of a bare metal lead sled. On it, though, I put a bottle opener. This tiny addition really gave the bike personality."

Bobbers,2945m3,Plutoid,2,Thu Jun 26 14:44:10 2014 UTC,"Depends. Do you want a rigid? If you change frames, you usually have to change titles.   If you want a rigid you can always buy a weld-on hardtail section and keep the original front loop (same title, yay!), or a complete rigid frame. (I can share links and pix if you want)  If you want to keep the rear suspension, I'd probably just clean that frame up with an angle grinder. Just be careful, and you can always bondo any nicks and scrapes on the frame that aren't structurally bad."

Bobbers,28onwx,Lopakalolo,2,Sat Jun 21 01:15:31 2014 UTC,I have a few other pics in this sub. The motor is a 77kz400 and the intake is a 4 inch K and N from a car we had kicking around. It feeds both carbs.

If you can't install it yourself (lack of tools/know how), they send a DVD with each kit, showing you how to do it properly, but DONT take the bike and kit to a mechanic to have them do it. Buy the parts from your local mechanic, if you can! Te internet is putting the small guys out of business and most online places don't guarantee their work!

I'm most familiar with the V-Star 650, so, that's where I'm coming from. Slamming a 4"" drop (at the stock rear fender) required a drill bit and relocating the position of the mono shock 1"" forward. Easy. Cheap. For a different rear fender, find a fender off a boat trailer. Different bars, lights, seats, etc. can be found all over ebay. So, why buy their expensive, cookie-cutter kit?

Bobbers,27cejt,rebeldefector,2,Fri Jun 27 16:44:17 2014 UTC,I think it was a kit. When I got it it didn't run so I payed dirt for it and found a 200cc engine for it. You can find those v-twins all over ebay and amazon now
Bobbers,27cejt,ZombieOmNom,2,Thu Jun 5 03:33:19 2014 UTC,"Lifan made the V twin as pretty much a direct copy of the virago 250 engine. It's available as an off the shelf engine and it's generated a pretty decent sized following. Type ""Lifan 250 vtwin"" into google images and you'll see what I mean.  I've been wanting to build a bike around one for a long time now. There are aftermarket intakes that allow you to run a horizontal carb and all sorts of other cool mods.

Bobbers,27cejt,rebeldefector,3,Thu Jun 5 04:05:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah this is the lifan 200cc. The bike used to have a 110cc that was still pretty fun it just looked like more like a ""mini bike"""
Bobbers,27cejt,ZombieOmNom,2,Thu Jun 5 04:15:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah the 110/125cc engine is a ""laydown"" engine which creates a lot of open space in the frame, making it look a lot smaller than it really is. 200cc is easily enough to get up to 80mph and it's surprising how much tug those little singles have.  I know that kikker had two types of frame, a ""two thirds"" frame and a ""full size"" frame. The two thirds frame was basically two thirds the size of a regular motorbike, and the full size was big enough that the 250cc v-twin motor still had space around it.  Also I'm not sure who is downvoting us or why."

Or just because it's a kit? I honestly think it's ridiculous that everyone is so anti kikker and pro blue collar considering that bcb is a total ripoff, and is fundamentally the same type of kits except with way less parts for the money. What Kikker were doing was selling entire motorcycle kits for people who have a low budget. Would've been better off on the UK market in all honesty.  Personally I'd chuck a vstar 250 engine in it, since that's what the lifan motor is a copy of anyway."

Bobbers,26cat6,DiligentDildo,1 point,Sat May 24 04:30:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah I was going to say the same thing. Definitely need to re-gear, I used to have a 250 that would top out at around 80 on the highway."

Bobbers,26cat6,Pacsh,1 point,Sat May 24 13:33:16 2014 UTC,Your best bet is to contact a honda dealer and ask if the motors are interchangeable.

The savage is super simple, and they've been making the same model since '86, meaning that parts are plentiful. Not to mention, it has better aftermarket support. Ryca makes a pretty sweet bobber kit for the savage.  Edit: I accidentally a verb"

Bobbers,25ud2a,Raging_Hate_Boner,3,Sun May 18 07:30:32 2014 UTC,"I wish. I live in the UK, so actually it rains quite a lot, I just don't ride in the rain anymore. Bobbers aren't really a ""rainy day"" motorcycle in my view. The point of a bobber is the challenge of seeing how much extra speed and acceleration you can get out of it by removing things - some of those things are practical like mudguards. Honestly this bike sucked to ride in the rain anyway, because the mudguards it did have were way too short to be of any use."
Bobbers,25ud2a,monoxidex,2,Sun May 18 15:58:36 2014 UTC,"Here's a link to my album of progress photos of the build. Bike was used as a commuter for about 2 years in all weathers and it really took it's toll. It became progressively worse over that time (rain, mud, etc). About a month and a half ago I laid it up in the garage and started tackling various jobs one by one. Starting point was about 13bhp at 10500rpm, and 135kg dry weight as a stock motorcycle.    New chain and sprockets.  Added a Tutoro chain oiler.  New copper plated 4"" headlight.  New indicators.  New rubber carb joint - old was cracked right through.  Removed air box, replaced with cone filter.  Increased jet size.  Added separate crankcase breather filter.  Cleaned carb.  New open exhaust.  New throttle cable, converted to single cable.  Oiled all the cables for the first time in their life.  New handlebar grips.  Repainted rims gloss black.  Repainted tank, was going to be silver, switched to black.  Removed a lot of rust on the frame and repainted those patches.  Removed lots of tags and tabs.  Repainted the engine.   The pile of useless crap that got cut off or otherwise permanently removed is enormous. I went in with the philosophy of stripping off everything that didn't contribute to the basic running of the motorcycle, and then adding back just enough to make it roadworthy. I'm not sure exactly how much weight I've taken off this bike, but to give you some idea at this point it must be at the very least 20kg lighter than stock. She picks up very well and brakes much faster.  Now I just need to work my way through some minor electrical issues. But it's great to be back on two wheels again! And wow, she sounds a million times better. The throttle response is awesome. I'm going with a vintage flat tracker/motocross theme (hence the stickers). The battery box is eventually going to be covered up by a racing number to complete the look."
Bobbers,25ud2a,BambiMurderer,2,Sun May 18 04:55:22 2014 UTC,That's looking great man.
Bobbers,25ud2a,BambiMurderer,2,Sun May 18 05:17:31 2014 UTC,Wow man looks awesome probably weighs as much as an RS now :') can you feel the difference in acceleration with all the weight thats been off it I test rode this dragstar but instead went for getting my full licence
Bobbers,25ud2a,oscar2hot4u,2,Sun May 18 22:52:07 2014 UTC,"Haha no way, it's the rusty tank dragstar with the brembo caliper. :D I've seen that thing on ebay so many times. I'm guessing it felt really breathless.  Yeah the acceleration difference is very noticeable, it picks up really quickly, the speedo needle makes it's way up a lot faster now, and the brakes now seem to be more able to bring it to a stop. Probably not far off an RS in terms of weight, it's certainly a lot easier to move it around on foot and feels roughly the same as the RS did.   It's probably benefiting from a combination of the open air filter, bigger jet, and less weight. Took it for a ride down the dual carriageway today and it actually held 70 on a slight hill. I'm now changing up into 5th at around 60mph, and it has power in 5th as well which it never used to lol. I can actually feel the pull in the gear change. Also because the air filter is under the tank, the tunnel of the tank seems to be acting as an air scoop, which is feeding the filter with a lot of slightly compressed air so is probably giving a bit of a high end boost.  The only downside is that it's deafeningly loud at high revs. Shifting down to 4th to climb a hill it feels like my ears are going to pop. I'll almost certainly be putting a pair of shorty silencers on it. I might try going with a slightly bigger jet as well just to see how it runs and if there's any improvement."

I wanted to fix mine into a bobber too but I just bought a Harley so I gave it to my mom so she can learn to ride. If your power ever decides to randomly kick off, there's a little tiny clip like fuse in a box by the battery. It kinda looks like a wrench. Mine oxidized and disintegrated and it took me forever to figure out what was going on. Hopefully it doesn't happen to you so I'm just warning you. Otherwise, great bike and ride safe!"

Bobbers,24ab38,MisterMeatball,2,Tue Apr 29 16:55:24 2014 UTC,"1.) Is my budget realistic? The bike I've got my eye on is $2000 asking, figure I could grab her for $1600-$1700 and leave the rest for mods?  You say build in the intro, but I'm getting the impression you mean buying a runner and doing bolt-on mods? Seems fair, depending on what you specifically want and the condition of the bike. Keep in mind the cost of title transfer and registration, plus I would hold something back since it's unfamiliar and someone might have bubba-ed something in a less than obvious way.  2.) I've got all summer but I want to do it in about a month? Can it be done? - I plan on spending entire weekends on it since I work through the week and would like to get it done so I DON'T spend too many weekends just working on it  Refer to one. What are you going to do? What is the condition of the bike? Do you have a perfect vision that you intend to crank out all at once or were you going to modify it slowly over time?  3.) What are some forums I should or NEED to consult to immediately inform and help myself with the build or with any bobber for that matter?  I'd definitely read the forum for the specific bike. In addition I like jockeyjournal and, as MisterMeatball suggested, chopcult.  4.) I've cleaned the carbs on my ninja/replaced brake pads but that's about it so am I getting way over my head or can I manage? I can do any sawing/shaving needed but I may need to learn how to weld as well but I have family who know so it shouldn't be too bad  Depends on the mods. If you're just gonna throw away the front fender and bob the back one then you don't really need much. Welding is awesome, but you can get some mileage out of bolt-on stuff while you're starting out. You say you don't want to spend much time on it, want it all done at once, and you want to learn as you go. This might be a problem.  5.) What should I expect from owning a boober or a Honda Rebel (250) in this case? (maintenance, commute/lifestyle, cost to own [insurance/gas/bits and pieces])? I'd commute given the weather is nice but don't really plan to, just a bike meet/weekend ride kind of bike.  There's nothing specific about owning a bobber. Maybe less storage space behind you if you chop a shitload of the fender off. A 250 rebel will be crazy slow, but should hold it's value well (as most 250cc beginner bikes do...though you'll sacrifice some of that chopping on it). Do keep in mind that nothing you do to the bike will increase its resale value, and most will likely lower it. Do it because you dig it but never use the word ""investment."""
Bobbers,24ab38,noeatnosleep,1 point,Tue Apr 29 18:52:08 2014 UTC,"1.) Yea sorry you're absolutely right I am just looking at bolt ons  2.)  Because I only have weekends to work on it I'm going to say  I'll mod it over time 3.) Cool good to know  4.) Pretty much spot on but what exactly do you mean?  Sorry like I said I'm new,  so what ate some common welds done to bobbers? And I want it done right so I'll take my time 5.) I figured and fully understand,  since I'm hopefully doing this all by myself,  and people usually only trust themselves when  it comes to modding bikes I don't expect to get 100% of my money back.  With that note however, given it is a 250 and the fact that I just came off a 500, what do you recommend I get that would still make a great bobber and be in my price range?  I seriously can't thank you enough for the help, hell any help is help nonetheless"
Bobbers,24ab38,noeatnosleep,1 point,Tue Apr 29 22:12:38 2014 UTC,"1)  Nothing to be sorry about. Your bike, your choice. Plus everyone starts somewhere...I suck at welding.  2)  For sure, but how much time is still a question. A decent project could take an entire season...or several years. Simple bolt-on stuff could easily be done in 3-4 weekends.  4)  You could easily get away without welding anything, but common things would be tabs or whatever for changing out gas tanks, seat mounts if you decide to go with a solo seat or the like, and fender struts if you toss the stock fender and do something custom. Eventually you may decide to do a hardtail, which usually requires welding (boltons aren't so common). You should pay someone for that. Obviously you can weld anywhere, but these seem like the most obvious.  5)  You could get tons of ratty bikes to cut on for that price. I'm currently playing with a sportster...it ran me $1200 and just needed the carbs cleaned, a new chain, and tires. You could get a ""good"" one for 2k-2500 in my area without doing much work. XS650s are the flavor of the week, so there's always that though the prices have risen accordingly. Small displacement CB's are also big, though the DOHC 750s are cheap, since everyone wants SOHC. Really it's just whatever you want to mess with."
Bobbers,24ab38,noeatnosleep,1 point,Wed Apr 30 12:56:43 2014 UTC,"Awesome great stuff man and again thanks for the advice,  I've looked at some sportster in my area but a lot seem like shit and decent ones go for above my budget,  and I'm just a honda guy so I think it may just be rebel/ shadow for now, which I know sounds pretty closed minded but Idk just preference I guess. Thanks again though will take all of this into consideration, this has definitely changed my thoughts but in a good way, what I should realistically be expecting if I want this to be good, and that this is an investment, this is something that is going to take time and $ but I'm excited nonetheless can't thank you enough stay tuned for a future post I guess lol"
Bobbers,24ab38,ThrowEmAllOut2012,1 point,Wed Apr 30 23:21:23 2014 UTC,"You should xpost this to /r/bikebuilders as well.   To answer some of your questions:   Is my budget realistic?   That entirely depends on what you want to do to the bike. What do you want to do to it?   Can I do it in a month?   No idea. What do you want the bike to look like?   forums   jockeyjournal.com and chopcult.com are great forums.   welding   is way harder than it looks. You might consider taking a welding class, or paying someone to do your welding. A motorcycle is probably the worst thing to learn welding on.    What to expect   You should expect it to be uncomfortable, unreliable, attractive, frustrating, eye-catching, small, slow, and fun.   If you have any questions, yell at me. I love talking bikes."
Bobbers,24ab38,Jakedubbleya,1 point,Tue Apr 29 19:36:18 2014 UTC,"1). Haha just to make a badass looking bike I can  cruise on for under 4k  2.) Awesome thanks man! !  3.) Ok good to know what are some common welds done to  Bobbers that I may need to have done pprofessionally?   4.) I just came from a 500, and being a 250 I understand it will be slow but is there any other bikes I should consider that might be just as good only a little bigger (cc)?  Thanks a ton man really appreciate the help!!!"
Bobbers,24ab38,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Tue Apr 29 22:33:30 2014 UTC,"Well, you can absolutely build a bobber for 4k.   Hell, you can build a chopper for 4k. If you have 1500 to 2k extra after buying it, you can make a bad-out honda rebel.   Some common welds would be probably mostly welding on tabs for fenders/seats/tanks, and if you're going to do anything super-cool, you'll need to do a little frame modification, as well.  I could walk you through the whole process, if you wanted.   As far as larger bikes; you just build what you can get for a decent price. If you can get a Virago 500 or something for 1500 bucks, that wouldn't be bad. Whatever you can afford. WHATEVER YOU BUY, MAKE SURE IT RUNS WELL! There's nothing worse than building a bike and then having motor problems."
Bobbers,242ief,Kinect2,3,Sun Apr 27 00:33:41 2014 UTC,"A simple google search will probably yield results but here, Ill just hand it to you. I don't get the animosity towards the production quality and/or product placement. It seems to be the culture surrounding these events and just dropping labels such as hipster comes across as edgy and unappreciative of these sort of events. Not trying to be rude or anything but ive just uploaded a few sweet edits featuring some sweet builds and /r/bobbers has just been focusing on the people in the clips rather than what this sub is about, the bikes themselves."

I have an xs650, so there are loads of forums for it that I use.   I can guarantee you'll find better info that way."
Bobbers,23s87d,Leejin,2,Wed Apr 23 19:23:04 2014 UTC,Honda shadow.net great forum connects to other models
Bobbers,23s87d,Coolsta,2,Thu Apr 24 13:24:59 2014 UTC,"Make sure that you've put the correct jets in the correct carbs. I haven't touched bikes in years but I recall that the rear cylinders are jetted differently.  Also, with jet kits they have suggestions on what needless to use, what height to set them at if they're adjustable, how many turns of the idle mixture screw, and the float height.  It's worth double checking all these things."
Bobbers,23s87d,pipsqeek,1 point,Wed Apr 23 22:12:22 2014 UTC,The jets came in the same bag. Got them from carbjetkits.com. The installation instructions that came with it don't really help. They actually show them installed on a magna. It's completely different. Even the manual is difficult to follow.
Bobbers,23s87d,pipsqeek,1 point,Wed Apr 23 23:25:15 2014 UTC,Okay. I'm not really sure how much more info I can give. Sounds like things are running lean. So check that the idle mixture screw is turned the correct number of turns.  Also check that the needles are at the right height. Perhaps they are sitting too low and not letting enough fuel on throttle.  Usually a circlip adjusts the height. Though I've seen some with plastic spacers. Washers also work.
Bobbers,23s87d,pipsqeek,1 point,Thu Apr 24 01:22:39 2014 UTC,"Exhaust temps went down slightly running a slightly richer mixture, the engine began to load up. Both needle valves were installed with the same amount of washers. I'm going to do a cooling system flush as well and then make sure the carbs are synced up properly. It runs a lot better now and I'm really excited to get it out on the road."

Bobbers,23s87d,lurker818,1 point,Wed Apr 23 22:08:04 2014 UTC,"Higher temps usually mean it's running lean. This means to much air, not enough fuel, or both. That's where I'd start my search."
Bobbers,23s87d,lurker818,1 point,Wed Apr 23 20:47:50 2014 UTC,The exhaust pressure seems to be higher from the rear pipe as well. I didn't touch the float level when I had the carbs apart. The throttle cables seem to have a little bit of slack in them as well.
Bobbers,23s87d,ScottyGoody2Shoe,1 point,Wed Apr 23 20:54:38 2014 UTC,Do you have a carb sync gauge?

Bobbers,23s87d,littlefield20,2,Wed Apr 23 23:22:29 2014 UTC,"Lurker818 here, this is the exact correct sub for your question. I have a duel carb sync tool you can have for cost of shipping if you like. I only have one and you're the first person to mention needing one so it's yours if you like. It has gauges instead of using oil. Once the carbs are synced it should run fine as long as you used the right jets. One question, do you know the new and old jet sizes you're using?"

I honest to god fully believe in do what makes you happy but I have a hard time taking some of the posers that I see today seriously in my stupid macho believes I much have much more respect for somebody who owns an ugly looking bobber but rides the shit out of it than somebody who has a high gloss expensive looking bobber and all the ""gear"" that comes with it to look like a poster boy for chop cult and death science but rides his bobber only under perfect weather conditions."

Bobbers,23b180,GreyDog2,2,Fri Apr 18 10:16:41 2014 UTC,I have the same problem. I just returned a biltwell because it was enormous. I normally wear a medium and had to get a small because they run big and what sucks is the small uses the same shell as a large just with extra padding. I just ordered the 2014 bell custom 500. The new models are supposed to be much slimmer due to the different shell sizes. I've also heard the lick's are the lowest profile but they are only available in flat black. I'll post an update on the bell once I get it (probably next week) as there doesn't appear to be much information out there for guys who wear smaller sizes.

I feel like it'd look a little better if the headlight was mounted slightly lower, and the back of the tank was mounted slightly higher.  What's the plan for the paint?"

Bobbers,22u92t,Plutoid,2,Sat Apr 12 16:24:23 2014 UTC,"Well all that has to happen at this point, are wiring up a brake light under the seat and above the ""fender"", put some turn signals on(I'm thinking of actually getting some LEDs and putting them in the tube of the frame), pull the air box and carbs (carb 3's float is messed up), make a new airbox or pod the carbs, because whoever put the backbone in (it was supposed to be a cafe bike) must've forgot he took half of the air box off when he welded the bad boy up... Then all that's left is cleaning wires up! For 350 for the bike, and 50 for the tank and seat, I'm pretty happy with my investment! Oh! And it got me a job at a mechanic shop, so that's cool too!"
Bobbers,22u92t,Plutoid,1 point,Sun Apr 13 13:49:59 2014 UTC,"You could fab up a tall sissy bar/back rest to go into the frame tubes.  Maybe mount the brake light up high on it.

Bobbers,22qksk,Whyarentyoumadbro,3,Fri Apr 11 00:07:06 2014 UTC,"Honestly you're better off finding a 1970's helmet in restored or good original condition. I tried all the ""DOT"" helmets, and living in the UK that was pretty expensive. The Biltwell (both novelty and DOT) were huge, so was the Daytona, Fulmer, and a bunch of others.  Then I got a 1973 helmet and it fit me like a glove. Didn't look stupid and it actually felt stronger, better made. There's just nothing that beats it, the shape is completely different to the retro replica helmets... it's just the real deal, authentic - you can't really replicate that.  With the money you'd spend on a ""new"" helmet you're better off buying a restored old one and avoiding disappointment."
Bobbers,22qksk,ZombieOmNom,2,Fri Apr 11 00:30:35 2014 UTC,"Well shit, thanks for the good advice man! I didn't even think of looking for an original but I guess that'll be my best bet. I looked at the Bell brand 3/4 because it has positive reviews as far as low profile and fitment but its pretty expensive and still looks bulky. I'll scour eBay and such for an original, cheers!"
Bobbers,22qksk,ZombieOmNom,2,Fri Apr 11 00:53:04 2014 UTC,"I tried the Bell 500 as well and it was nowhere near as ""low profile"" as an original vintage helmet, and nowhere near as low profile as it looked in the advertising. I don't know how the fuck they managed to make them look so slim in the promotional adverts - the only thing I can think of is they used a gutted next size down shell so it'd fit slimmer on the model - an old 1%er trick.  What I've found is that in terms of profile the real-deal vintage helmets are all narrower if that makes sense - so when you put one on, the sides are closer to your ears, even though other dimensions are similar to the modern helmets. I put one of mine side by side with a biltwell novelty, and the biltwell was physically wider, but it was the same height and length. I actually managed to modify it narrower by taking a hairdryer to it and bending the thermoplastic to the desired shape! Looked pretty good after that, managed to sell it on ebay pretty easily.  If you're in the USA, I seem to remember there being a lot of old Buco helmets on ebay. Might be a good place to start.  EDIT: One more thing, back in the 70's and going back before that, motorcycle helmets came in numbered sizes. This confused the fuck out of me at first but I eventually figured it out, so here's a quick conversion chart:  Size 1: 55-56cm Small  Size 2: 57-58cm Medium  Size 3: 59-60cm Large  Size 4: 61-62cm X Large"
Bobbers,22qksk,ScottyGoody2Shoe,3,Fri Apr 11 01:47:56 2014 UTC,I'm about to get one of these. It's DOT with all the style of a novelty one.   http://www.skullcrushgear.com/dot-helmets.html
Bobbers,22qksk,ScottyGoody2Shoe,1 point,Fri Apr 11 03:29:07 2014 UTC,Awesome. Now I really have to get one. Then I can stop riding around with this novelty 1/2 half helmet that might get me killed
Bobbers,22qksk,hammertonail,3,Fri Apr 11 05:07:30 2014 UTC,I have a biltwell Gringo and A Licks NovDot.   The Licks is smaller for sure. But I don't think any are are small as the vintage ones.   http://www.lickscycles.com/product-p/novdot-mb.htm

Bobbers,22dk6i,1600cc,1 point,Mon Apr 7 00:34:21 2014 UTC,I hear wrapping the exhaust may cause the gear changer to touch it as there isn't much room to spare. Just be sure to factor in this chance when you get around to it. Otherwise nice bike! Debating whether to install apes on mine or keep the drag bars.
Bobbers,22dk6i,Fattychris,2,Mon Apr 7 04:18:09 2014 UTC,Pretty cool as is man. You could clean up some wires & cables for a simpler look. Get rid of some chrome maybe? Cool bike.
Bobbers,22dk6i,1600cc,2,Mon Apr 7 00:58:29 2014 UTC,I'd lower it with the j-slam method. Do the pod filter mod and get rid of that big air intake. I'd also get rid of the fork tube covers. I have mine on a lift right now doing the j-slam mod and installing a custom rear hugging fender. I have the same 150 front and 180 rear tire setup too! Head over to the chopcult forums for good ideas
Bobbers,22dk6i,Fattychris,2,Mon Apr 7 03:17:50 2014 UTC,I have a 650 VStar that I'm bobbing out... Where did you get that rear fender?
Bobbers,22dk6i,punkn00dlez,4,Tue Apr 8 00:17:15 2014 UTC,I'd get rid of the apes.
Bobbers,22dk6i,Twisted_Cuber,6,Mon Apr 7 05:13:25 2014 UTC,"I love the apes.  This is what makes the motorcycle community awesome.  So many options, tastes, and styles.  In most communities, when you disagree with someone it's an argument.  In ours, it's verification of our ability to build and modify our machines to look and run how we want them.

Bobbers,22dk6i,jaysjeep,1 point,Mon Apr 7 07:47:23 2014 UTC,"Sweet! Loved my V*. To get rid of some of the chrome, I painted the air cleaner with a rattle can crackle finish black. The paint needs to bake to get the right look, but the cleaner is plastic and would melt. So, heated up the BBQ grill, turned it off and put the painted part in, resting on a rock, as it cooled down for the required length of time. Worked perfectly."

Bobbers,227nsa,TurdDrop,1 point,Sun Apr 20 23:16:34 2014 UTC,i already fixed it.  The misfire was the result of the carbs being totally out of sync and the throttle's also being out of sync.  The bike sound great with straight pipes imo.

Bobbers,21yhoi,smellyhamper,11,Tue Apr 1 21:11:28 2014 UTC,"Edit: Note: Complete build photos in linked album.  My dad and I had the pleasure of surprising my brother with this 1994 Sporty Bobber for his birthday this weekend. It was an awesome, awesome day!  Little back story...  Last summer, after purchasing my first HD (Road King), I swung by my brother's house to show it to him. He commented that he would love to have one someday and we started looking at bikes online. When I got home, I immediately called my dad and asked him if he would like to go 50/50 on a bike for him...and spend the winter building it. He said ""Hell Yes!""  My brother has worked for non-profits since he was 18 years old and will most likely never be in the financial position to purchase his own bike. He currently gets around by bus, bicycle or walking...so this bike is a pretty big deal.  Anyway, last week we told my brother that my dad was entering a couple of bikes in the Donnie Smith Bike Show (St. Paul, MN) this past weekend. His 1946 Knucklehead + another one he just finished up for a client. We all met at the show and after looking at all of the bikes, we took him outside for some fresh air and let him in on the secret. I asked him if he liked the '94 and he said ""Yea, it's beautiful."" I said ""Good, I'm happy you like it, because it's yours"" and handed him the keys and clean title. It took him some time to get over the shock - but he hasn't stopped smiling since.  I can take zero credit for this build. I found the stock sporty and chipped in 50% of the costs, but my dad did all of the work and spent endless hours working on this thing so it would be ready to give to him this past weekend.

As far as everything else, I probably spent another 3k on parts and paint. You have to take into account all the tools you'll need to buy (I thought I was prepared, still ended up spending quite a bit on misc parts and tools). All in on the build I think I spent close to 4.5k (including bike).     As far as the around part of your question, I'm just a stupid kid in college, so it took me about 6 months (working weekends) to finish it. So take that as you will. Might take longer, you might be faster than me haha.   Good luck man! I had a blast doing my shadow."

Bobbers,208q0g,cantreed,3,Wed Mar 12 17:59:11 2014 UTC,"Everything is going on from the tank forwards. Stretch the rear section a few inches, and put a fender on it. As it is, it looks like a mullet."
Bobbers,208q0g,RustyCutlass,3,Wed Mar 12 18:10:38 2014 UTC,Business in the front. Party in the back Haha.  I see what you mean.  Im currently working on a fender for the back.

Bobbers,203qgj,mtthmmnd,1 point,Tue Mar 11 04:49:51 2014 UTC,it sure as hell is. I never thought about building a bobber but I have started looking at bike recently and that's what Im gonna do
Bobbers,203qgj,mtthmmnd,3,Tue Mar 11 11:50:26 2014 UTC,"Its a Cb400 engine, the rest is custom.   I could price you everything for that bike for about 6500.00 (that includes paint, soda blasting cases and powder/ceramic coats)   It's a lot of money to put out if you don't have the time to finish it, the most common projects you see forsale are bobbers."
Bobbers,203qgj,Orange_Banana_3150,1 point,Tue Mar 11 16:44:29 2014 UTC,"How about without paint, soda blasting (what is that anyway?) and power coats? I would like to do something really close to this but I'd just buy an old Harley of I had 6500.00"
Bobbers,203qgj,Orange_Banana_3150,2,Tue Mar 11 17:21:06 2014 UTC,"I mean, you could probably do it for around 3-3500.00 if you were really handy at fabing stuff. I'm just talking to have one that would be absolutely immaculate without a ton of work/speciality tools you'd be into $6500.00. Soda blasting is similar to sandblasting, but much less abrasive  it does beautiful work on engine casings, fork lowers and other parts. No pitting or warping. I've used in numerous times and wouldn't go any other route unless I had thick layers of paint of was doing something really large or something non delicate, then I'd sandblast.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmjEG7_5a38"

Bobbers,200zii,just_a_hack,2,Wed Mar 12 06:38:18 2014 UTC,"You may not want to make purely straight pipes/ drags pipes, as engines rely on some amount of backpressure to operate properly. They will run well at speed, but you may notice a gutless bottom end or ""holes"" in your power and. I'd suggest getting some beer can/slip in baffles or making some lollipop baffles to provide some backpressure. If you're doing 2-2, try to make them even length.   A TIG will be better suited to doing work that will be chromed or polished. If you're going to wrap them or want them to look dirty, a MIG will work just fine.   When I did my 2-1, I went to a local muffler shop and bought 3 u-bends of my desired size and a straight section, and slowly cut, swiveled, and tacked the pieces together until I got where I needed to be. Be sure to look at routing to make at least 1 support for each pipe aside from where it connects to the engine.   Biltwell sells an exhaust builder kit, but the pipes are sized for Harleys. You can use it and go to Autozone or another parts store and get reducers/expander sections depending on what bike you have to match up to the ports.  A scrap set of pipes that fits the bike is good to have so you can cut off and reuse the sections that mate to the engine, unless you have the skill and means to make them .  Good luck, and don't worry if they aren't perfect the first time, it can take some practice, but you'll feel great when you hear your own design roar for the first time."
Bobbers,200zii,Mentally_Displaced,1 point,Mon Mar 10 06:52:44 2014 UTC,Thank you thats really helpful.  I have done some research about straight pipes but I wanted to be able to ask people who have done it and I could have a dialogue with rather than just read about it.  I own a MIG (and a background in metal work) and intend on wrapping them.  As well I am going to re-jet my carbs at the same time as I would install my new pipes.  I wanted custom pipes which I why I didnt want store bought ones.
Bobbers,200zii,Mentally_Displaced,2,Tue Mar 11 00:17:10 2014 UTC,"try to tack it all together 120deg apart on the tube (3 equal tacks around its circumference), if youve got pipes side by side and/or collectors, then tack it all together as is, remove from the engine, mark out then break tacks to seperate the system into a couple sections so you have full access to all sides of the tube. keep in mind how you're going to weld the completed sections back together too so choose the right section to break  with mig its easy to have leaky pipes, which isnt so bad when theyre open but if you change your mind and get a muffler it wont really have the desired effect. also keeps wrap a little fresher if there arent any leaks, minor thing tho. small fillets can mitigate leaky pipes depending on your technique but for thin wall tube it can be tricky if you're not used to it. get a couple hours practise first, try high heat and a quicker pass, if you tacked at 120deg then stick with three runs around the pipe. that'll help your technique and make it easier to keep torch angle correct and avoid other problems"

Bobbers,1ze59r,Plutoid,5,Mon Mar 3 05:48:35 2014 UTC,"I appreciate seeing the journey.   I admire your use of pipe fittings and heat shrink. It looks like you have plenty of skill to remove the motor and clean up some of the other bits next winter. Always have to have a project right?   It was a great choice to display that rear shock setup, and all the powdercoat.   You didn't ask for opinions but I think a white wall front tire would look good. And cleaning up the handlebar's as well.   Handlebars and top clamp are the next project on my sportster. It will allow me to fit a smaller tank and generally begin my journey to clean up the look."
Bobbers,1ze59r,hammertonail,2,Mon Mar 3 02:17:41 2014 UTC,"We will have to see how well my handiwork hold up this riding season, haha. I definitely learned a lot, and I think I could give it a proper go this coming winter.  And you're right. Now that i see it all together, I'm thinking about a whitewall on the front as well. I'd love to clean up the bars too, but I set a pretty strict budget for myself, and I barely made it. New hardware will have to wait until next year!    Thanks for the kind words!"
Bobbers,1ze59r,LksdG2,2,Mon Mar 3 02:39:14 2014 UTC,"Looks awesome, the only thing I personally would do differently is get narrower bars and ditch basically everything off them and put on a small rear fender.

Bobbers,1zckor,noeatnosleep,2,Mon Mar 3 02:02:22 2014 UTC,"Really like this. I did a test ride on something similar a little while back - guy at a local biker spot turned up on this sick bobber and I was like ""oh man, wanna swap keys?"". He liked the look of my machine so we went out for a quick run on eachothers bikes. He'd done a 2 into 1 exhaust and moved the footpegs so they were right under the seat, upside down bars, and a fairly similar seat to the one you've got on there. It was crazy fun to ride and sounded beastly. It was like a supermoto disguised as a bobber. These shadows are surprising, very torquey and responsive motor, and with all the weight stripped they're pretty nippy. He'd put a narrow wassell/peanut tank on it so the whole thing had this really nimble skinny stance."
Bobbers,1zckor,noeatnosleep,1 point,Mon Mar 3 05:57:07 2014 UTC,Wheres the battery?
Bobbers,1zckor,noeatnosleep,2,Sun Mar 2 16:10:40 2014 UTC,You can't see it from the side. It's mounted down in the frame (almost under the bike)

Bobbers,1z0cb2,Leejin,-1,Wed Feb 26 21:08:52 2014 UTC,"Not a bobber in what sense? Because it's not a stock bike that's had parts removed purely to reduce weight, or because it hasn't been made to look like a vintage Harley?"
Bobbers,1z0cb2,ZombieOmNom,3,Thu Feb 27 01:39:23 2014 UTC,Bobber in my eyes is bobbed. Bobbed fenders and stripped.
Bobbers,1z0cb2,Leejin,1 point,Thu Feb 27 03:57:12 2014 UTC,"It's just become really fuzzy for me because there is the ""bobber philosophy"", which is to strip everything until all you're left with is a very basic motorcycle, then there is the ""bobber style"" which is basically imitating vintage bobbed bikes of the 40s and 50s. In theory, a true bobber should have no styling elements whatsoever, other than whatever aesthetics it had from the factory. The only goal is a lightweight bike."
Bobbers,1z0cb2,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Fri Feb 28 02:57:42 2014 UTC,"Looks like they just put the front fender on the back and replaced the seat with something about the same dimensions only more uncomfortable.    It's a trim, not a haircut."
Bobbers,1z11od,0rangepeel,4,Wed Feb 26 22:07:31 2014 UTC,Of you're thinking of going the route of a kit then may I suggest bluecollarbobbers they have kits for various bikes so you can see what's a good platform to start on. I have the suzuki savage and just put the kit on over the winter
Bobbers,1z11od,proudofya,3,Thu Feb 27 12:09:28 2014 UTC,I second the bluecollarbobber route.   Get yourself a Honda Rebel 250 or savage like above and the kit and you will be well on your way.
Bobbers,1z11od,hammertonail,3,Thu Feb 27 14:17:00 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't start on a 250 cruiser, they are dogs, start between 500-800. The whole beginner start on a 250 thing doesn't transfer to cruisers because they are heavier and generally don't put out as much power."
Bobbers,1z11od,Laptop-Gamer,2,Thu Feb 27 19:30:54 2014 UTC,Interesting point of view. Thanks.   I do think it is important to keep in mind the kids weight. Small guy who might want something light to start out with. Though cruisers are still lower to the ground. Just a thought.
Bobbers,1z11od,hammertonail,3,Thu Feb 27 19:56:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah I get what you're saying but I think it would be best for him to start out on an old Japaneses standard since he can go either way, cafe or bobber."
Bobbers,1z11od,Laptop-Gamer,3,Thu Feb 27 20:11:19 2014 UTC,My first bike was a Honda CB-750k and I miss it to this day. Heavy and tall but a great bike.
Bobbers,1z11od,hammertonail,3,Thu Feb 27 20:30:55 2014 UTC,"The bcb kits are nice but some of it is overpriced, I only bought the seat and the fender, the rest can be done for much less."
Bobbers,1z11od,Laptop-Gamer,4,Thu Feb 27 20:20:01 2014 UTC,"Chopcult is probably the best for info on all things bobbed, chopped, and cafed. Caferacer forum is filled with pretentious douchebag purists.  First you need to pick a style you like, a sportster makes a great bobber but not an easy to make cafe. Old japanese standards are easy to make into a cafe.  Even newer cruisers make good bobbers this is basically a stock bike with minimal fab work (besides the exhaust) that anyone can do in their garage."
Bobbers,1z11od,Laptop-Gamer,3,Wed Feb 26 23:04:37 2014 UTC,"Seconded chopcult, those guys are great, they like helping people with their builds, but you must follow the golden rule of chopcult: POST PHOTOS.  My best advice to you as a newbie to customs, is get yourself a decent drill, socket set, wrench set, soldering iron, and a tap and die set. So long as you can make holes, unbolt stuff, wire stuff, and make threads, you're good to go for most simple builds.  Also, beware of ebay parts. Sure they're cheap, and some of them look pretty cool, but most of it is absolute garbage. Chrome will rust after a few days, electrics will stop working or malfunction, and if it says it's ""waterproof"" it probably isn't. I've stopped buying stuff from ebay now because I've had to throw so much of it in the trash.  If you're painting anything with rattle cans, remember this formula:  2 coats or primer, wetsand with 600 then 1000 grit.  3 coats of colour, wetsand each with 1000 grit.  2 coats of lacquer. Wetsand with 1000 then 1500 grit, then finish with polishing compound.  For your budget, I'd recommend the Kawasaki W650 or W800. Plenty of potential for a cafe, tracker, scrambler, or bobber. Probably the most versatile bike on the market at the moment.  Good luck, and have fun!"
Bobbers,1z11od,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Thu Feb 27 02:35:02 2014 UTC,W650 and w800 not sold in US unless my dream came true.
Bobbers,1z11od,Laptop-Gamer,1 point,Thu Feb 27 02:59:04 2014 UTC,That's sucky.  The suzuki savage 650 is a pretty good starting point as an alternative. Not quite as pretty as the w650/800 but it's got a lot of scope.
Bobbers,1z11od,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Fri Feb 28 03:01:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks mate! Which ones going to be easier to handle, the bobber or C'Racer?"
Bobbers,1z11od,Laptop-Gamer,2,Thu Feb 27 07:58:22 2014 UTC,"Well a cafe racer will be more nimble and have more ground clearance for riding in the curves. A bobber will generally be more stable at high-speed but performance really is secondary when it comes to bobbers. I would start off with a japanese standard and see what kind of riding you like. If you like tearing up the twisties then modify it into a cafe, if you like cruising on the highway maybe doing some long distance stuff go for the bobber."
Bobbers,1z11od,Leejin,2,Thu Feb 27 19:28:27 2014 UTC,"Like always, I suggest a Yamaha xs650. Plenty of power. Ubiquitous parts, multiple great forums.   Mine is pretty simple. Super easy to work on. More of a go-cart level of tinkering than a newer bike. Carbs can be annoying, but overall, I love my bike and can't wait to get it going this spring."
Bobbers,1z11od,Laptop-Gamer,2,Thu Feb 27 15:37:36 2014 UTC,Maybe look for a nighthawk 700 assuming your in US if not the nighthawk 750. It's a semi modern bike so it's reliable and makes plenty of power. They can be found for sub $2000 and can be converted to either a bobber or a cafe.

Bobbers,1ylcc8,nopetonope,1 point,Sat Feb 22 02:39:50 2014 UTC,"thanks! from beginning to end, i spent less than $300. a lot of the mods i made using what i could, and what i had laying around (seat, fender, etc.)  to get it to look like what it does, it was... 90 for the bars 50 for all 4 signals 45ish for the tail light seat was free fender was made from the support liner, so technically it came with the bike. paint and prep was probably around $40 for all the VHT, BBQ, flat black protective enamel, and sand paper bar end mirrors were $16+shipping on amazon and the struts were $35 on ebay  the rest was just a lot of time and creative problem solving. i have spent about $1-200 more on parts to upgrade it from stock such as a paper air filter (soon to be a K&N) a new chain, and the 17/38 swap from the stock 16/45 gears. other than that i cut out the rear baffles, and rerouted some of the electrical."

Bobbers,1yipfp,xofb,3,Fri Feb 21 07:30:08 2014 UTC,"Anything can be a bobber with a bit of work. However assuming you have little to no wrenching experience I would go with a bike that blue collar bobbers sells a kit for.  Ace 750 Rebel 250 & 125 Spirit 750 Chain Spirit 750 Shaft Shadow 600 & 400 Shadow Aero (Phantom) Vulcan 900 Vulcan 800 & 400 Savage (S40) Boulevard (M50) 800 Volusia (C50) 800 V-Star 1100 (Dragstar) V-Star 650 (Dragstar)  If you can weld and do some work on a bike then go for anything really, Sportsters are popular because of the massive amount of parts available, xs650s have blown up so now donors are expensive but they make cool bikes, any of the pre 90 jap standards can be hardtailed and made into a bobber.  Basically pick a style that you like then buy a bike that is closest to it then start hacking away until you see your prize.  It's hard to give suggestions without your experience level."

Bobbers,1yipfp,universalmind,2,Fri Feb 21 22:12:04 2014 UTC,"I just wanted to say I completely agree with you. I've seen some really beautiful hand made bespoke carved leather seats sell for less than the bcb one.

Bobbers,1yipfp,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Mon Mar 3 16:01:48 2014 UTC,"You obviously don't agree with that because you just said that I linked a seat that was ""substantially superior"" and you had no qualms with it's price. The seats you linked are not a better comparison because they are not bolt on and require fabrication to use. The BCB seats are bolt on plus the biltwell seats are like sitting on a 2x4."

It also has, presumably, unique fittings to that model bike that you have to pay for on a factory OEM part.  Considering that I could (and have) built a springer seat out of a piece of metal, a little padding and some leather for under $100, charging $300+ for a springer seat kit is more than a bit outlandish.  TL;DR Why pay $300+ for something you can make for under $100?"

I realize it's a matter of opinion and taste, but in my opinion, if you're going to go with the bobber look, a v-twin is the best option purely for aesthetics.   The downside of v-twins, is that they have more torque and less horsepower than an I4, but for something like a bobber they are totally sufficient while providing really good looks."
Bobbers,1yipfp,Wage10,1 point,Fri Feb 21 17:39:15 2014 UTC,There are also a few parallel twins that look pretty good and have better power output than v-twins. The CL350 makes an awesome bobber.

Also, a bobber used to be a bike with parts taken off, now it's a ""look"" you get with parts you bolt on. On top of that you end up with a bike that looks like a million and one others out there.  I know this all sounds really negative - the blue collar bobbers kit DOES improve the looks of stock bikes. They are better for having the kit put on. I just think that the scene needs to encourage creativity over copycat otherwise it's just gonna die out."
Bobbers,1wehqw,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Wed Jan 29 16:32:43 2014 UTC,"What got me into the ""scene"" were the bcb kits. Someone who is inexperienced with welding/ fabricating could be intimidated by making their own parts and just pass over customizing completely. These kits push newer people to start wrenching on their bikes and often times they then move on to fabricating their own parts. So in a different way these parts encourage creativity. Contrary to your point about these pieces contributing to the scene dying out they open the world of custom bikes and bobbers to a much larger population."
Bobbers,1wehqw,Laptop-Gamer,1 point,Thu Jan 30 08:15:39 2014 UTC,"they open the world of custom bikes and bobbers to a much larger population.   I think it's more important to have a small group of innovators than it is to have a big group of imitators. Usually by the time the masses have caught on to something it's already become passe and the core scene moves on to something else.  It moved from bobbing and hardtailing harley sportsters and big twins to jap cruisers, then cannibalising jap standards and sports, XS650s went crazy and now they're stupid money, then cafe racers got popular so now CB750s are stupid money, then flat trackers and vintage dirt bikes, now we're seeing people convert more modern dirt bikes into vintage style flat trackers so heaven help anyone who needs a tank for a vintage dirt bike.  Right now as it stands, we're running out of donor bikes, and running out of nostalgia. Pretty soon we're gonna end up with a generation of bikers who were so busy reliving the past that they weren't even alive to see that they get frustrated because their ""scene"" now is just a ren fair reproduction of genuine, authentic things happening years ago. What are we going to relive in the future? A reproduction of a reproduction of a bike that looks kinda like the bikes that people used to ride when they were having fun 100 years ago?"
Bobbers,1wehqw,ZombieOmNom,2,Thu Jan 30 19:56:46 2014 UTC,Awesome my biggest concern is how i get something like this through inspection I can barely get my stock bikes through
Bobbers,1wehqw,wiseguy187,3,Tue Jan 28 21:50:18 2014 UTC,"What are they inspecting for? Safety, or deviation from social norms?"
Bobbers,1wehqw,Twisted_Cuber,2,Tue Jan 28 22:24:54 2014 UTC,"Damn. What state are you in? Texas isn't too concerned.. As long as you're lights work, horn & show them your brakes will stop you."
Bobbers,1wehqw,wiseguy187,1 point,Tue Jan 28 21:56:01 2014 UTC,Who do you have inspecting your bikes? Take em to someone who knows nothing about bikes and they will pass it.
Bobbers,1weiun,overall_anal,4,Tue Jan 28 21:14:56 2014 UTC,"Bobbers are getting pretty generic these days. I like the silver paint on this but it's really basic. Aesthetically it's fine but I just feel like I've seen a million of these already. Would be nice to see a little bit of innovation and some new trends coming in to keep the scene alive. Right now it seems to be getting buried under a mountain of copycats.  As an aside, I never noticed this before but the 600 Shadow has a really nice shaped tank. Not too wide either."
Bobbers,1weiun,ZombieOmNom,2,Wed Jan 29 00:47:46 2014 UTC,"Once you've seen all these makes/models bobbed, there's not much more to do. This particular style kind of depends on the simplicity. It doesn't take a lot of fabricating or thinking to clean up a stock bike for a 'bobbed' style. From all the big publications, it looks like the 70's stretched out, peanut tanks & narrow bars with all the back sweep are becoming the thing to do. That, & cafe racers are fucking everywhere."
Bobbers,1weiun,i_dont_want_to_be_on,1 point,Wed Jan 29 14:44:34 2014 UTC,"I think the nu-skool look is what's getting kinda tired right now. The 70s psychedelic and frisco styles are definitely coming back in, but then so is the ""only a harley will do"" kind of snobbery as present as ever, which naturally makes a good chunk of the custom scene feel alienated and uninspired. Magazines lately haven't really been serving the average joe which has been doing a disservice to the scene.  I'd love to see more hot-rod inspired, patina'd, bonneville drag racer, crazy brat style/jap style, and cross-genre fusions. I think there's a lot you can do with these, just that people are going with what they know because the scene doesn't really have any big inspiration right now, there are no leaders setting any precedents. It's all gone over to cafe, flat track and vintage dirt bike restoration.   The bobber will make a comeback I think, it just needs some good role models and some new donor bikes to get people interested again."

Bobbers,1wcn85,Plutoid,1 point,Tue Jan 28 08:10:15 2014 UTC,Is it just the angle in the photo or would you be bumping the seat pan on the wheel at every bump?  You going to hardtail or use struts or is the clearance enough?
Bobbers,1wcn85,wiso4,2,Tue Jan 28 17:31:08 2014 UTC,"It's a shaft, I'm guessing he'll use struts."
Bobbers,1wcn85,Plutoid,2,Tue Jan 28 20:24:30 2014 UTC,Clearance is about an inch and a half. The shocks are from a Suzuki Savage and don't have a lot of travel. I haven't managed to bump the seat yet. Plan on keeping it as is unless I go hard tail next winter.
Bobbers,1wdj8l,littlefield20,4,Tue Jan 28 15:37:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah man.. my bike has them and I love the look. I personally hate bars. Prepare for an uncomfortable ride though.

Bobbers,1wdj8l,Laptop-Gamer,1 point,Tue Jan 28 18:47:46 2014 UTC,"Are clipons supposed to be used for this? I'm not sure I understand your question. Yes clipons are supposed to go onto the forks, if you feel it would be comfortable then go for it. Personally I think clipons look great on a bobber but its really up to you. Plus if you still have the shocks you have the makings of a really cool cafe."
Bobbers,1wdj8l,Laptop-Gamer,2,Tue Jan 28 17:59:54 2014 UTC,Thanks for the input.  I'm gonna try the clip ons. :)
Bobbers,1wdj8l,Laptop-Gamer,1 point,Tue Jan 28 18:04:38 2014 UTC,"However it might make more sense to pick up a set of standard rise bars because you can use them as they were intended, for a more upright position, or flip them over and have a lower stance.

Bobbers,1wak15,ZombieOmNom,2,Tue Jan 28 00:12:36 2014 UTC,I like the look of the peanut tank's on sporties. I don't think its much smaller than the tank you have now though. Big difference on my 1200c though. That tank is HUGE.
Bobbers,1wak15,hammertonail,2,Mon Jan 27 18:39:47 2014 UTC,My vote's Frisco
Bobbers,1wak15,BigMike0228,4,Tue Jan 28 01:54:20 2014 UTC,"I say leave it how it is. Looks pretty nice currently.  If you were to put a rounder tank on it, or even raise that tank up, it would look way off with the lines of the bike....Unless you chop it up and do some serious fab work."
Bobbers,1wak15,Pacsh,2,Mon Jan 27 18:43:51 2014 UTC,"Rather than buying a new tank you could raise up the tank currently on your bike, possibly weld on an extended filler neck to increase the gas you can fit. This will give the frisco lane splitter look without spending $100-200 + paint on a new one. It looks great though, nice job. Maybe put the money towards hard tailing it if you swing that way."
Bobbers,1wak15,Laptop-Gamer,2,Mon Jan 27 18:34:04 2014 UTC,"Get a set of fat-bobs, cut them both flat on the insides, weld a plate on each one, then bridge them and mount them side-by-side.   Easily the baddest look, IMO.  Something like this."
Bobbers,1wak15,noeatnosleep,1 point,Mon Jan 27 19:04:27 2014 UTC,Cool scoot. I'd hardtail it before I touched the tank though.

Depends more on the frame and suspension I think. Touring Harleys have huge looking front ends that don't look great without a bulky body to back it up, and they look kind of strange without saddlebags because the rear shocks are so noticeable. Traditional bobbers are rigid so that kind of kills the look there. Here is a custom ""bobber"" Victory, which has a 106 CI engine (1700cc)"
Bobbers,1vuk8w,hammertonail,2,Wed Jan 22 15:08:22 2014 UTC,"I would say no, but imo the larger touring bikes look odd when bobbed. That whole aesthetic looks far better on smaller cruisers, not touring/huge bikes but that's all just personal tastes."

An aftermarket oiler is a necessary purchase and the valves need to be readjusted constantly. I don't know where the v-30 fits in there, but look up and see if it has the notorious oiling issue. (btw all older magnas have some form of oil issue with the valves but the 82-83 is considered a lemon because of the severity of it.)  http://v4musclebike.com/forums i use this site constantly for my bikes."
Bobbers,1uit8a,pakcman,2,Mon Jan 6 11:30:46 2014 UTC,"If you're going to do a bobber, I would recommend buying a cheaper bike with more cosmetic issues, but a strong reliable drive train."
Bobbers,1uit8a,Twisted_Cuber,2,Mon Jan 6 23:10:26 2014 UTC,that bike has 4 cylinders and a radiator... Not really bobber material.
Bobbers,1uit8a,porksnorkel,1 point,Mon Jan 6 22:50:49 2014 UTC,Can you go further in depth about why plz?
Bobbers,1uit8a,Twisted_Cuber,1 point,Mon Feb 24 07:46:35 2014 UTC,"Sure,     Classically, Bobbers were stock motorcycles modified by returning veterans of WWII to be more like the bikes they rode while touring in europe. These bikes were either 1 or 2 cylinders and air cooled. They were stripped of all non essential parts so they would be lighter and faster. The term ""Bobber"" was coined for these bikes as they would typically have shortened fenders. The process for shortening the fenders was called ""Bobbing"". Any bike can be stripped down and made lighter to be faster and also it can have bobbed fenders and be called a bobber but it won't really look like one if it has things that were not available in the 40's and 50's like water cooling, emission controls or rear suspensions."

Bobbers,1tgc3u,flatlander30,1 point,Sun Dec 22 21:07:39 2013 UTC,"Bars, hate the bars. Seat needs to be changed (preferably to something that's attached by more than a bungee cord)   It was ""running"" in this pic but the coil was faulty and wasn't sparking the rear cyl. so I had to replace that and when I took it apart, I decided to have the machinist give the bike some love.   Hopefully I'll have it back and running by tomorrow.   first thing is to shave that fender bracket back a little bit.   second (and 3rd) is to have bars and a sissy fab'd and a bracket fabbed since I'll be cutting up the bracket.   After that, I want to find a good King and Queen style seat.  That's all I have planned for her at the moment, although I am considering the BMX foot peg thing everyone seems to be loving these days."

Bobbers,1rlzxp,showmeyourfartbox,3,Thu Nov 28 01:33:19 2013 UTC,In a straight line you'd be great.. It's just when you start to lean that the edges on the tires will start acting weird.
Bobbers,1rlzxp,Twisted_Cuber,-1,Thu Nov 28 14:42:00 2013 UTC,"I can confirm this is not true, the tire bends when it contacts the road so its not like your riding on the edge of the tire."
Bobbers,1rlzxp,buenobro,2,Thu Nov 28 17:40:35 2013 UTC,"It doesn't contact the road like it should, thus, the handling is sacrificed. Pulling a trailer for camping? Oh hells yes! Just watch the tight turns. :)"

Bobbers,1quuon,noeatnosleep,1 point,Mon Nov 18 03:32:55 2013 UTC,"I might have a few somewhere. It was a chain idler off of a thermo king refrigeration unit. It ended up putting to much torque on it (plus getting the perfect tooth ratio dealing with 4 sprockets) I ended up removing it and just off setting my motor mounts. Luckily the triumph motor doesnt weigh to much. If you were looking to use a wider tire on a fixed sprocket motor, I would recommend using just an offset idler to space chain over how ever many inches needed."

Bobbers,1qs88i,whateverdipshit,1 point,Mon Mar 10 22:52:30 2014 UTC,"Board track racers were early motorcycles that were essentially bicycles with motors, typically started by turning the pedals to get it moving then dropping the clutch. While this bike isn't a board tracker (it doesn't have pedals and looks beefier all in all) that was probably the inspiration.   This is a modern take on the board track style by Wolf Creative Customs and is super sexy"

Bobbers,1qs88i,wholypantalones,0,Thu Nov 21 17:28:22 2013 UTC,Sometimes people just down-vote because they don't have the time to consider maybe I'm not being an asshole..   But I believe this is legitimately considered a moped.  Like that looks like a 49cc (give or take) single cylinder motor mounted on basically a custom fabricated bicycle frame. Like I said.. it's a moped.  I know that name sounds bad but I gave you the only honest and correct answer so of course I have a negative score.  Not all mopeds are lame.  For example: This is a moped that could easily pass as a small custom bike built cafe style.. But it is simply a moped.  http://imageshack.us/a/img585/370/20130508120446.jpg
Bobbers,1qqdyy,dteeban,3,Sat Nov 16 01:23:04 2013 UTC,"I suggest: if you're getting a bike in May, ride the shit out of it during the summer and fall to hone your skills. This will also give you time to save money.  When the weather starts to turn, you can retire the bike and turn it into your winter build project. Then, come springtime, you can ride your new bobber to your heart's content."
Bobbers,1qqdyy,ucbiker,2,Tue Dec 3 08:17:48 2013 UTC,Take the msf. You usually use 250 cruisers during the course. Doing that made me realize I didn't want a 250 cruiser.

Bobbers,1qqdyy,noeatnosleep,2,Sat Nov 16 13:50:11 2013 UTC,"First off, the Rebel isn't underpowered.   Second, don't ever bob your daily rider, unless you're a pro. Always get a second bike. It'll take you 4x longer to do it than you think it will, and you'll be depressed about not being able to ride."
Bobbers,1qqdyy,Sk4ld,1 point,Sat Nov 16 14:42:08 2013 UTC,You won't be able to ride it through the majority of the stages of bobbing the thing. It's also not going to handle nearly as well once you've worked on it so in all likelihood not a great bike to develop your skills on.
Bobbers,1qqdyy,sodapopsik,1 point,Sat Nov 16 22:26:49 2013 UTC,"First off, it's good that you will be taking a safety course.  It might even make you realize you don't like riding or will give you that instant love to want to ride.  I took the safety course and saw some people who just gave up and realized it wasn't for them.  Better to know before you spend and buy a bike you don't want.  Good luck on the course, though.  If you plan on going on the highway DO NOT gets rebel.  It is not a highway bike.  It's a great bike if you're just going through the city streets and is a perfect beginner bike that you will probably outgrow in at least six months but it will be a good way to get you comfortable on the streets and on a bike.  My favorite bikes are Harley knuckleheads and yamaha xs650 but i couldn't find any I liked so my first bike was a honda shadow (600 model)  that was a bobber.  It had custom parts (handle bars, no fenders, no mirrors, no rear shock, custom seat) that made it a little more challenging to handle for a beginner but you get used it just like anything else Although it did seem a bit bulky at first, I became accustomed to it fairly quick.  It had plenty of power for street and was ok on the highway but would shake at about 65-70 so I mainly used it on the streets.  I grew out of it in about 4 months and sold it to get a new Sportster 48 but other things happened and wasn't able to get it.  a year later I buy my current bike which is a 80' yamaha xs650.  It's way quicker than the Honda and is decent on the highway but I still stick to the streets.  It is a fully custom bike and would probably suck to learn on if I was a beginner but I have some experience so I was easy to get used to it.  I would suggest you get something around 600 if you want to ride street/highway and something 900 and up if you want to ride highway more often.  You'll eventually want something 900 and up anyways because you skill level with go up and you'll ""outgrow"" a smaller bike. Sorry for the long story.  this is my xs650  http://imgur.com/rAB05dN"

Bobbers,1qqdyy,Dungeon_Masta,1 point,Thu Dec 5 10:19:58 2013 UTC,"Pretty much just reafirming everything everyone else is saying buuuut 1. The rebel is too small to be safe on the highways. A Vulcan 500 or xs 650 would be ideal for what you need. 2. Don't bob out your daily rider, the lack of rear suspension will destroy your back and all you will be able to ride after a few years is a trike or a car. 3. The safety course I took(California) expected you to have some riding experience before you took it so either make use of your permit or take the 35 dollar beginner skills course.  4. Enjoy your bike!! I just started riding and I love it! Side note I started with an 800cc and it felt right."
Bobbers,1qqdyy,Pacsh,-2,Thu Dec 5 11:50:43 2013 UTC,"If you're looking for safety and comfort, forget about building a bobber.   Second, don't bother with any of those Jap bikes. Grab yourself an old 60's or 70's ironhead Sportster for around $3500 and go from there. They're just as small, and 900cc may seem like a lot right now, but once you start riding, you'll soon want more.  Other than that, take your time and do it right. Apply yourself to the build. Don't just take the fender off and call it a bobber. the only thing you'll get out of it is what you put into it. If you take the easy, half-assed route, you'll have a half-assed looking bike."

I had sold my previous bike earlier in the year (2012) and after watching this I realized what a huge mistake I had made.  I had been searching for a good bike since then and found my current bike a few months ago.  I've been saving up money to do a few trips but unfortunately could only do 3-4 day trips being that I work a shitty warehouse job and don't get much time off.  Current bike is a 1980 xs650 and saving up to buy a 2nd bike which will be a knucklehead for sure.

Bobbers,1q7wba,mmm_dumplings,3,Sat Nov 9 01:39:21 2013 UTC,"Do you want it up high on the backbone like the photo? If so, buy a frisco-style tank with tabs on the front and back. You will need two bungs (try bungking.com) to set in the top tube. If you use a center punch and a step bit you can place the bungs in the frame for them to bring the cost down, as for welding you are looking at 4-6 inches of welding which should be <$40."
Bobbers,1q7wba,a_randy_sewer,1 point,Sat Nov 9 05:13:40 2013 UTC,"Thanks for pointing me in the right directions. Just so we're on the same page, I'm gonna summarize what I think you mean: I should buy a tank like the following: http://www.bungking.com/tanks/gas-tanks/low-tunnel-sporty-tank.html and then buy 2 bungs that will be put into the spine of the bike. These bungs can be placed into the spine, at locations corresponding to the top and bottom tab of the tank. Then drill holes in the tabs and and screw the tabs down on the bungs. Very straight forward, very helpful, very affordable. Thanks for this! (I also learned what bungs, center punch, and step bit are.) The concern I have is with the spine size of the Rebel compared to a Sportster. I think the Rebel spine is much much bigger and may require welding of the underside of the tank. Similar to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=9ro4TpIduAg#t=52 . Any ideas for a good solution to this? Thanks in advance!"

I'll probably look into doing this first when i get a tank. This guy put it on a CB250, so the frame is a bit different, but not sure by how much. If they're the same, then the tank will probably sit higher than the blue bike up top =/. here's pics of the guy's bike from afar: http://www.chopcult.com/truerobotech/albums/6877/69681 . It might turn out pretty nice on the Rebel since the back is lower, but I guess I won't know until I have the bike and tank. (FYI, going to check out one next weekend going for $1100, 1986. Should be pretty good condition from the description)"

Bobbers,1q7wba,Kvorter,1 point,Sun Nov 10 19:47:43 2013 UTC,You said $1100 for a rebel right? Check out the CB's too if you are a honda guy. I can imagine everyone growing out of a 250cc.

But it's all YOUR FAULT that I've removed the rear brake lights. I went to go take a pic of the profile like you asked and sat there and looked at it and thought about the lines and flow... and realized that my idea of matching dual headlights up front with dual bullets on the rear looked good on paper but just seemed slightly off in reality.  So I didn't get a side pic yet. I removed the rear bullets and am fabricating up and under-fender LED strip for run/brake.  Y U DO DIS?

Bobbers,1p32ff,AmoebaCowboy,2,Fri Oct 25 01:22:03 2013 UTC,"I've always loved the flying vtwin engine configuration of the Cx500 series. The GL monoshock setup also opens up possibilities. For the classic bobber look you'll want to strip things down to bare essentials while retaining the lines of the bike.  I'd suggest something along the following:   strip off most of the handlebar wiring & instrument cluster. Something like this maybe? Consider switching to a spring solo seat and going with a chopped rear fender similar to this or this. Most Honda bobs retain the stock wheels but I've never been a big fan of them. You can black out the stock wheels or whitewalls on blacked out rims are always a classic.   The cx500forum.com is a great resource for build ideas, parts and advice."

Bobbers,1oq3t2,littlefield20,6,Fri Oct 18 17:00:10 2013 UTC,Definitely make a new tail section. I never understood struts. All the drawbacks of a hardtail with none of the benefit.
Bobbers,1oq3t2,Vegall_st,2,Fri Oct 18 20:04:35 2013 UTC,Yeah Im working on that.   I know where to get a hardtail kit but I dont know how I would weld it on. I suppose I could rent a welder but I would know how to get everything perfectly lined up and balanced.
Bobbers,1oq3t2,a_randy_sewer,5,Fri Oct 18 21:26:29 2013 UTC,"First. Do not weld the frame yourself. Pay to have a certified welder do it for you. You do not want your bike splitting in half while you do 80 on the freeway.   Secondly. The word bobbers came from bobbed fenders. So, bob a fender and stick it on there. I don't see the appeal of riding without a rear fender.   Lastly, you shouldn't care what we think. Make your motorcycle yours."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,Plutoid,3,Sat Oct 19 02:44:44 2013 UTC,Thanks for the advice!
Bobbers,1oq3t2,Vegall_st,2,Sat Oct 19 14:22:48 2013 UTC,"I see that comment as 1 | 2 right now.  Who the fzck downvotes a thank you?  /u/a_randy_sewer is right.  Make it your own and fzck the haters.  One thing I can say, though... I question the struts from an engineering standpoint.  You're making single bolts carry the entire weight of a hardtail bike, bouncing over bumps (while carrying your fragile ass) in what seems to me to be the fashion that would put the most shear stress on them.  Not an engineer, just have a healthy respect for physics.  I'd hate to think of what might happen if one should snap from wear."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,a_randy_sewer,1 point,Sat Oct 19 16:58:42 2013 UTC,"Yeah reddit is strange sometimes.  This same thing happened when I asked for advice on malefashionadvice....  My thank yous got down voted.  I just wanted some ideas for the bike....Not instructions.  As for the bolts,  I'm scared about them too.  I bought the bike like this and I am trying to figure out a way to weld on a hard tail.  Money is a factor as well.  Thanks for the help and confidence."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,a_randy_sewer,1 point,Sat Oct 19 18:24:44 2013 UTC,"I have read that same thing about struts being rough on hardware. Force is mass times acceleration, and removing the shocks decreases the time involved in each bump (shocks decrease the force by spreading the acceleration over a longer time) which mean the forces involved are much higher. A strut focuses the force on a few bolts and bars, while a genuine hardtail disperses more of the impact throughout the frame."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,Plutoid,1 point,Sat Oct 19 18:33:49 2013 UTC,"Struts are good temporary decision makers. If you want a hardtail and are unsure of the ride and commitment, throw some quality struts and bolts on there and give it a whirl. A hardtailed frame will flex more than struts though so keep that in mind too. Struts serve their purpose, just not in a long term sense.   If money is a concern, save it up before having someone weld your frame, don't cheap out. If you are near MD (USA) I have a friend who is certified and reasonable, more importantly, a perfectionist.  The ultimate question is, what is the final ""look"" you are going for? I love seeing smaller bikes as cafes but that is my personal opinion.  http://i.imgur.com/894Pe3h.jpg   Rest of the blog here.  Find a picture or pictures of your endgame and we can help you get there. Outside of welding, a lot can be accomplished by hand tools and elbow grease.  Make your ride yours, make it safe, make it fast."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,ZombieOmNom,3,Sat Oct 19 19:30:24 2013 UTC,Thank you for the response.  I'm kind of stuck in the middle of do I want a welded hard tail or shocks? I love my hard tail so much but shocks are safer.  How much would it be to get someone to weld a hard tail?
Bobbers,1oq3t2,dteeban,2,Sat Oct 19 21:47:32 2013 UTC,I think $150-$200 is reasonable. It would be better if they have motorcycle experience. Do you have an indie shops near you?
Bobbers,1oq3t2,dteeban,2,Sat Oct 19 21:53:36 2013 UTC,"I have a bad back.  I'd go with shocks all day long.  Like was said, make it your own.  You don't have to be uncomfortable just to hold up to some stupid aesthetic.  If you don't like the look of the shocks you can dress or disguise them.  I've seen them with rags on them, which looked pretty cool, and they have plenty of designs that don't have visible springs if that's the look you're going for.  Edit: You can even do a monoshock conversion if it suits you.  Lots of options."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,wiso4,2,Sun Oct 20 09:05:09 2013 UTC,"Take it to a motorcycle mechanic, have him chop the sub frame off, which is the bit of frame that you've currently got your seat mounted to. Buy some hardtail axle plates off ebay. Tell him you want about 6 inches of stretch. The GS has a sports/standard wheelbase, but you want a longer wheelbase if you're converting it to a bobber.  Mount the headlight bracket to the bottom yoke/tree. Trust me, it will look a lot better that way. Also, drop the forks another inch or so. While you're there, pop some rubber fork gaiters on. They look oldschool and protect your fork seals. Hop on ebay and get yourself a set of royal enfield bars from india. http://www.ebay.com/itm/ROYAL-ENFIELD-BRAND-NEW-7-8-HANDLE-BAR-IN-BLACK-/121170036851?pt=Motorcycles_Parts_Accessories&hash=item1c364c0873&vxp=mtr  Throw some Amal/Jammer style rubber grips on, and the rest is history."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,xxxMDKxxx,3,Tue Oct 29 15:58:34 2013 UTC,Maybe a slimmer tank?
Bobbers,1oq3t2,xxxMDKxxx,2,Sat Oct 19 12:32:52 2013 UTC,"This is a much more minor adjustment, but one that I think could make a cool difference:  Until you get those whitewall tires, I'd consider swapping out your white exhaust pipe wrapping for black. Right now, the white pops a bit much, but it will complement the tires when you get them.  You also need to do something about the battery and all that exposed wiring, unless you're going for the messy, unrefined look."
Bobbers,1oq3t2,n8_,4,Sat Oct 19 16:04:09 2013 UTC,I had to make a wiring harness for it so its a little messy but a hell of a lot better than it was.  The old harness had about 6 feet of speaker wire that didn't even do anything.  The excess just wrapped around the fork and came back to the seat wtf?!   I bought some of that ribbed split tubing though and when I get home again I'll tidy it up.  I would like to get a mustang fuel tank too.   But one thing at a time :)

Bobbers,1obrwk,Kinect2,2,Sun Oct 13 06:01:16 2013 UTC,"!st thing i would recommend would be to narrow your search for the right style to a few bikes. There are many ""styles"" of bobbers. For me its the sporty look with the frisco tank and frame gutted to basics meaning that from a side view the bike is very ""see through-ish"". Vintage Coker Tires w a 21"" in the front, Springer front end and clamp on bars. You have to narrow it down because i went too quick and ended up w a blue collar bobber kit which are cool but are just not the style i want. Heres a vid of what im looking at getting done to my bike before the end of the year. YAMMY VSTAR 650 by T.E.C."

Bobbers,1obrwk,JVanity,2,Tue Oct 15 04:22:49 2013 UTC,"I think a lot of people are going to get at the fact that your bike is too clean to bobber out. I would trade my raggedy bobber for a newer stock shadow in a heartbeat.   I have a crotch rocket in addition to my bobber as well as a bmw for a driftable daily. But that's just me  Now to answer your question, my favorite bobber mod is hard tail. You have some nice fenders on there. But they cover too much. Get some custom fenders or trim yours, replace the rear shocks with fixed metal inserts(or weld the chassis straight to each other), and for your seat, I highly recommend a spring seat.  For your front, look into drag bars or clamp ons for your controls, handle bar end mirrors perhaps, and you should be pretty much there.   But before you take any of that to heart, do your research and be sure that these are the mods that you like best. This is your bike, not mine or any other redditors. That being said, what are the specs on this girl? What got you into the bobber style?"
Bobbers,1obrwk,Vegall_st,2,Sun Oct 13 12:47:02 2013 UTC,"i think it can still be clean and bobbed out. i guess it really comes down to the flavor one is looking for. i am looking at pics on this page daily and if i had a bike from 92' i would probably be taking a different approach.   the other thing is i do not want to affect the ride/safety performance of the bike. to me this means no messing with suspension, tires, or anything the like."
Bobbers,1obrwk,Vegall_st,2,Tue Oct 15 04:30:20 2013 UTC,Trade it in for something else
Bobbers,1obrwk,xxxMDKxxx,6,Sun Oct 13 02:21:13 2013 UTC,no can do. i actually like the bike and i bought it brand new. i just recently learned that bobbing was a thing and I love the look and sound of a well done bob job. i have seen late model phantoms look awesome so i know that it is possible.
Bobbers,1obrwk,Vegall_st,2,Sun Oct 13 06:00:43 2013 UTC,"i'm on a 750 and i'm about to remove the sub air cleaner and mount a couple of KN filters so there's not that big goofy looking air cleaner on the side.   in the space where the air chamber used to be, that's where i'm going to try to tuck a lot of the electronics so the frame doesn't look as cluttered under the seat.   next i'm gonna get a couple of slip in baffles and some muffler packing so i can chop off the big parts of the pipes, put in the baffles, and get a good drag pipe look without waking up canada. then it's just cutting a new bracket so the pipes aren't free floating from the head.   i want to hardtail it, i'm looking at a kit from ardtail choppers here; http://web.ardcorechoppers.com/parts_hardtails.asp  they do specify ace and spirit, not phantom, but if you call and ask for specific measurements then compare that to your frame, you should be able to see if it works. there are other options and weld shops out there if that one doesn't work.   you definitely need to come up with a new license plate bracket and seat. i manage to use some scrap angle iron + some threaded rod through the back axle to mount the license plate, and i used the same seat pan/foam/leather, just shaved down, cut, and restapled to make a solo seat. then put some more scrap angle iron across the frame under the seat to hold it in place (it doesn't actually bolt anymore but i'd need several thousand more CC's before that could slip out.)  this pic kind of shows what i was talking about, let me know if you want me to snap a couple better shots to clear it up some.   http://www.imgur.com/kM3rVJH.jpeg  edit: if you ever want to get rid of the tank, you're going to need a new odo/speedometer at least. side mount would be my first inclination but i haven't looked much into them yet. also i want to keep my neutral/oil press/temp lights, but i haven't decided on a good place for them yet. honda put all of that mounted directly on the tank so if oyu want a nice looking teardrop or peanut tank, you will need to make all those things first.   edit take 2: if you want to put on a springer front end, here's a tutorial (i haven't done it yet, it's a more major undertaking)  http://www.spiritchopshop.com/mod%20webpages/SpringerForkModificationfortheHondaSpirit750.htm"

Bobbers,1obrwk,chrisgedrim,1 point,Mon Oct 14 04:00:27 2013 UTC,"I AGREE 100%  Maybe find something carburated and air cooled. If you want to have a real bobber grab an old virago, sportster, or Bonneville. Your bike looks nice though, congrats."
Bobbers,1obrwk,albertgt40,6,Sun Oct 13 03:50:59 2013 UTC,"That's not very supportive. It doesn't have to be old or carbureted or a specific make to fit the bill. As FigPutins says, start by removing non essentials, reflectors, front fender, "" bob "" the rear with a hacksaw, remove or tighten up the turn signals, and clean up, hide, or simplify the wiring if it is visible. Bars and shocks change the stance and appearance greatly as well, likely pushing you in the direction you want to go."
Bobbers,1obrwk,Vegall_st,0,Sun Oct 13 06:03:30 2013 UTC,"My bad, not trying to be unsupportive but if a bobber is exactly what is wanted then we could have told him exactly what kind of bike to buy."

It means you have the freedom to do whatever you like without having to conform to any 'rules' that people set out for building a bobber. You may end up building a bike with a all of the traditional features of a bobber, at which point it will become as much, but you'll have built it that way because you wanted it that way. All that being said; work out what features you like and find some resources that explain how to accomplish them."
Bobbers,1obrwk,xxxMDKxxx,1 point,Sun Oct 13 11:19:50 2013 UTC,"White walls in my opinion are super cool, give it that old look. Keep the bike black and just add white walls. Eventually try to get the solo seat kit for your bike if they make one. Drag bars/pipes later but not necessary right away. Try to get the bobber style rear fender or you can just go without running one, your decision but I think they look better with a little fender in the back. Bobber taillight/plate relocate kit, most common is the ford model a light with plate that hangs on the left side. Different air cleaner maybe, also you could paint the front fork shocks black but that's just my taste. There's running boards for your feet too.  There's so many ways to customize your bike op, I just listed some things that I like/planning on doing to my 1100 vstar. It's really up to what you like, but if I had to suggest just one thing, it would be the white walls.

When I bought it it wasn't running, but all it needed was the ignition coils to be hooked up, and a proper carb cleaning!

I just came from a little cafe, so I wanted something different and decided that a magna was a great bobber candidate! The backbone he meant for the CB tank would work great for a peanut tank, and if I moved the clip-ons up to where they are now, it should work well. I'm a stereotypical broke 18 year old college kid that is on a budget so I'll only be spending money when I have to. Right now I have $450 in it, and I'm hoping to be able to keep it under $500.

Bobbers,1o17q7,noeatnosleep,2,Wed Oct 9 15:10:23 2013 UTC,How did you mount your oil tank? The original brackets I got were too big and now it makes my oil tank touch my chain. Yours looks like it's right on the underside of the frame itself?
Bobbers,1o17q7,noeatnosleep,1 point,Wed Oct 9 04:15:48 2013 UTC,Just fabbed two tabs out of flat stock on the top. I don't have a great picture on my phone. Then added another bung and a gusseted tab on the bottom to make it sturdy. Maybe this is a better shot: http://imgur.com/p91tkRU

I have always preferred sitting as far back as possible on my bikes so the pillion seat touches my tailbone to my lower back, depending on the type of seat, obviously.  That being said, I feel like riding a bobber with no rear fender would be really weird for me >.< I wouldn't have that support back there, and I would be welcomed by a nasty surprise from the rear tire if I happen to forget. Is that style something that's easy to get used to sitting on or is it not even an issue?"

(Obviously I wouldn't be interested in that chopper thing.)  Are you interested in building one for me?  /s Because I don't have the time or the knowledge.  So is it uncool to ride a bobber that you didn't build?  Serious question.

Bobbers,1n6ssh,Leejin,1 point,Fri Sep 27 15:34:46 2013 UTC,"Cool cool. You gotta start somewhere. My advice; Get the RIGHT tools. You can't put a value on having the correct tool, at the right time. If you're a broke college kid, take some time, but get tools. spend some time on Craigslist and your local Nifty Nickel shopping garage sales.   Maybe even find a cool Honda Shadow 600 for a damn good price. I have seen some 90's V-Twins for under $1k before.   Might be worth looking into. Good luck man. I hear ya too. My dream; renting out a studio apartment/garage in SoCal and moving my 66 Fairlane and Yamaha bobber into my living room and making a small shop. Maybe build a bike or 2 for some locals."

You're just at a very common stage for people who get interested in bikes, especially when they're internet users.   A few questions:  Do you ride currently? What do you ride?   What kind of fabrication experience do you have?  What is your work-space like?   Are you mechanically inclined enough to get this TS running in top form, before you decide to chop it?

The only part I wouldn't trust myself with is the welding. 4. Work space, either outside/dirty old shed with dirt as the floor. Or a pretty nice garage, not the biggest but it would get the job done. 5.I believe so, the main delay in getting it running is its with my mum in nova scotia and im in ontario, that and i didn't have the money for a new coil and couldn't find wire that was thin enough to rewrap the coil myself."

Bobbers,1mvbv8,a_randy_sewer,3,Sun Sep 22 02:15:14 2013 UTC,"Here's a pic of it with the front end on: http://imgur.com/RcFGn18   It's a turbo-diesel Yanmar clone, 418cc. Unfortunately I couldn't mate a proper gearbox with the budget, facilities, and time constraints I am dealing with, so it's got a CVT.  It is not fast. I think I had it up to maybe 60 -65 mph, but the thing is torquey as hell and fun to ride."
Bobbers,1mvbv8,NegraMuerte,1 point,Sun Sep 22 02:57:04 2013 UTC,"excuse my ignorance: Is it true that in gear and at idle it cruise at a constant speed if so, how fast/ how much?"
Bobbers,1mvbv8,NegraMuerte,1 point,Sun Sep 22 14:19:46 2013 UTC,"At idle the CVT does not engage, so no, it wont cruise at idle. Once you push the engine over 1700-1900 rpm the CVT tightens up."

Bobbers,1mt5br,pewonyew,1 point,Fri Sep 20 23:42:38 2013 UTC,"Pipes in all honesty should have TIG welding on them for perfect airflow. If you're not looking for perfection MIG will work to make what you want. Do not confuse MIG with Flux-core welders, they look the same, and the wire shoots out of the gun the same, but they do not create the same types of welds. If you can get your hands on a mig welder, practice with that, and use that same welder for your final work. Welding takes either years of fucking up and learning from your mistakes, Or a year or two to draw up the basic principles in school. I took a year in college and a few years in high school welding. There is no better feeling than to say ""hey, I made that out of a couple bars and pipes, now look at how awesome it is!"" Some more details would be awesome, I hope it works for you bro!"
Bobbers,1mt5br,Fabrikator,1 point,Sat Sep 21 09:04:00 2013 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply. I'm going for a 'if it works I use it'. I don't care as much if it looks nice, it just has to fit. I'm hugely into 'do it yourself' work, even if it looks bad. The mig welder I know has a co2 tank so no flux-core welding for sure. I mean I'm going to really just give it a shot in the dark. I don't have any school training right now but I plan to take a ton of classes in the future. I got some biltwell evo exhaust flanges that I can use to attach the pipes to, and I haven't looked but I'm going to get some U pipes and straight pipes to practice on. What do you mean when you say 'perfect airflow'? Like no holes in the welds?"
Bobbers,1mt5br,No_shoes_no_shirt,1 point,Sat Sep 21 17:39:21 2013 UTC,"Airflow. I believe he means the bends and size of piping used. Any size increase or decrease points and especially tie in points (2 into 1 designs) everything will affect the flow and back pressure. Incorrect flow or back pressure can lead to head damage down the road.  On a side note, for what you want to do, even a 110v welder will suffice as I don't imagine you will be welding much over 1/4"" thickness.  Your shielding gas will be an argon/co2 mix. Probably 80/20 or 85/15%. Id use .030 or .035 wire. I prefer .035 but you might have to weld a little hotter than you'd like, and it makes learning more difficult, so id suggest .030 for good all around thin gauge use"
Bobbers,1mqp2m,Pacsh,28,Thu Sep 19 22:43:09 2013 UTC,I would like to see OP's bobber.

Bobbers,1mqp2m,warnerve86,1 point,Fri Sep 20 06:37:53 2013 UTC,What type of bike are you building?
Bobbers,1mqp2m,warnerve86,1 point,Fri Sep 20 11:40:55 2013 UTC,"A '66 Xlch, bored out with P cams, sitting on a hardtail with a 45 Springer up front. Drum brake rear and speedwheel (no brake) front."
Bobbers,1mqp2m,sodapopsik,2,Fri Sep 20 19:54:51 2013 UTC,I like the sounds of that.
Bobbers,1mqp2m,warnerve86,11,Fri Sep 20 22:53:24 2013 UTC,"I agree with you.  While there as some sick looking bikes that just have one or two things taken off the stock look, it doesn't feel 100% right to call it a bobber.  But that's just me.  Like you said, a bobber has traditionally been a minimalistic looking bike with just the essentials to function.      Here's mine.  http://imgur.com/H7WzTqp"
Bobbers,1mqp2m,sodapopsik,3,Fri Sep 20 01:14:57 2013 UTC,I love that. How do those bars handle? I always wonder how those real narrow bars are for handling.
Bobbers,1mqp2m,warnerve86,1 point,Fri Sep 20 01:34:33 2013 UTC,Thanks.  Maybe it's because i'm used to them but they handle pretty well.  Pretty comfortable as well.
Bobbers,1mqp2m,sodapopsik,1 point,Fri Sep 20 01:47:44 2013 UTC,I think this winter I am going for some clubman bars. Is that a XS650?
Bobbers,1mqp2m,Plutoid,2,Fri Sep 20 01:49:26 2013 UTC,Right on.  I used to have some on a vlx600 I used to have but my back did not take too kindly to those.  The forward controls didn't help either.  Yes it is  1980 xs650

Bobbers,1mqp2m,JVanity,19,Fri Sep 20 06:36:05 2013 UTC,Wow... while it's fine to think this way.. maybe even down vote bikes you don't think are bobbers.. (guilty here).. an entire post worthless rant on it...?? Maybe this isn't the sub for ya. I like giving advice and seeing people mess with stock bikes.   This whole post of yours is kinda douchey.. IMO.
Bobbers,1mqp2m,Plutoid,9,Thu Sep 19 23:14:42 2013 UTC,"Maybe he didn't approach it in the nicest way, but I have to mostly agree with him. Most of the time it seems like it would be more appropriate for this subreddit to actually be called /r/sortoflikebobbers"

Bobbers,1mqp2m,comanche_MJ,3,Fri Sep 20 05:58:45 2013 UTC,"I agree with you on your rant... except that part. The birth of bobbers also came from trying to keep bikes on the road as cheaply and easily as possible, and thats what jap bikes offer. Harley stuff is too damn expensive for what it is-average quality parts. They're a name with a great PR campaign, but not much else special to offer beyond an image, and maybe 'a sound'."
Bobbers,1mqp2m,Ironman-mk42,-1,Fri Sep 20 06:39:04 2013 UTC,"That's completely wrong.  Bobbers started around the time World War 2 ended. They go hand-in-hand with the rise of outlaw motorcycle clubs.  Soldiers coming Back from the war felt they did not fit into normal society anymore, so they created their own.   One of the first details you will hear about early outlaw motorcycle clubs (precursors to the Hells Angels, such as the Boozefighters and Market Street Commandos) is the common characteristic of riding a stripped down ""74(ci) Harley.""   Like I posted before, these bikes were stripped down to decrease weight and increase speed/maneuverability, for recreation and events similar to the Cannonball Run.   With the start of the ""Rat Rod"" craze a few years ago, people decided to attempt to adapt it to bikes. Don't get me wrong, I like rat rods, especially when they involve such craftsmanship and ingenuity that we need to see more of here."
Bobbers,1mqp2m,gypsymojo23,1 point,Fri Sep 20 11:33:59 2013 UTC,I have a 73 Ironhead on here. It just finished getting painted and there will be pictures soon.

Bobbers,1mqp2m,Vegall_st,3,Thu Sep 19 23:19:08 2013 UTC,"Part of the problem might be the legal requirements. You try to strip all the unnecessary stuff off but then you go to get it inspected and before you know it universal plastic crap is all over the bike.   Also, I get the appeal of American engines but you gotta love the old Japanese motors. They are practically indestructible and easy to work on. I know OP isn't bashing them but some do.   I've been trying to make a stripped down bike here in CA and every mechanic that looks at it for inspection gets very pessimistic. God forbid you don't have a full instrument panel!  Neutral light! You have to have a neutral light! For the love of god the neutral light!   I personally just want an engine on wheels that's fun and minimal. No bullshit crap but I do get a lot of push back. My two cents."
Bobbers,1mqp2m,Mentally_Displaced,3,Fri Sep 20 04:00:32 2013 UTC,I'm not even halfway impressed unltil they have a hardtail.
Bobbers,1mqp2m,gypsymojo23,0,Fri Sep 20 06:54:13 2013 UTC,"A hardtail doesn't make or break the bike. Sure it does a good bit for looks, but they were only factory up until around '56.   I've seen plenty of great bikes with rear suspension, and just as may terrible bikes with aftermarket hartails"
Bobbers,1mqp2m,JVanity,1 point,Fri Sep 20 04:08:25 2013 UTC,"do you have some kind of inspiration folder etc with pictures of builds you like? sounds like i would like your taste in bikes but i'm a new and unskilled modder. i'm going to be teaching myself to weld later this/next year, and i don't even know what i can/can't remove from my bike yet."
Bobbers,1mqp2m,fosiacat,1 point,Fri Sep 20 06:41:11 2013 UTC,"here is the link.   The first bike is my main inspiration to a degree. Its an 81 Ironhead with a modified Santee hardtail, and a fairing from a CB750 race bike.  Like I mentioned before, most of these pics are saved due to small details that I have noted, not the bikes in general. All are Harley. Most are Ironheads of different years (because of my ironhead project), although there are a few Shovels, Pans,  Flatheads, maybe a Knuck or 2. There are also a lot of paint ideas, yet again, just small details though.   EDIT: There are also a couple early Hell's Angels pics thrown in the mix"
Bobbers,1mqp2m,txroller,0,Sat Sep 21 03:29:36 2013 UTC,"I do. I'll link an imgur album for you.   I usually save a bunch of pics but label them (file name) to point out certain parts, since no one bike has had everything to my taste."

Bobbers,1mo64u,alexmunse,5,Thu Sep 19 00:12:55 2013 UTC,Oh that poor 48. What have you done?
Bobbers,1mo64u,JVanity,1 point,Thu Sep 19 03:11:30 2013 UTC,"That wasn't a 48. Too much chrome, no wide glide front."
Bobbers,1mo64u,a_randy_sewer,-1,Thu Sep 19 12:05:19 2013 UTC,A. A 48 doesn't have a wide glide front end. B. It's a 48 with a narrowglide front end look at the tank.
Bobbers,1mo64u,JVanity,3,Thu Sep 19 12:33:35 2013 UTC,Doesn't the 48 have an engine and two wheels?
Bobbers,1mo64u,ThrowEmAllOut2012,2,Tue Oct 8 18:06:54 2013 UTC,"Check your facts. 48's have a 130 front tire and wide glide trees.   Secondly, there is chrome on the tranny cover and sprocket cover and it should be flat denim black.   This was never a 48, just has a 48 tank."
Bobbers,1mo64u,a_randy_sewer,2,Thu Sep 19 13:24:43 2013 UTC,Looks like a 72 with a 48 tank. Maybe
Bobbers,1mo64u,robosmrf,0,Thu Sep 19 14:54:41 2013 UTC,That's possible honestly but why would you do that. It's the same tank with diffrent paint
Bobbers,1mo64u,JVanity,1 point,Thu Sep 19 16:40:15 2013 UTC,because it has different paint.
Bobbers,1mo64u,Vegall_st,-1,Thu Sep 19 23:05:29 2013 UTC,Wide glide has a 49mm front end while a sportster including the 48 are 39mm. As far as distance between the forks a 48 is about 9 1/2 inches a cross while a 2013 wideglide is aproximitly 11 1/2 inches across. Also chrome parts are available for almost any modern sportster including all for mentiond covers. Hows that for facts straight.
Bobbers,1mo64u,JVanity,2,Thu Sep 19 16:37:57 2013 UTC,you can swap out any parts for any parts. this is still pretty clearly a 72 with a 48 tank.
Bobbers,1mo64u,Vegall_st,1 point,Thu Sep 19 23:07:44 2013 UTC,Sure still don't understand why
