cars,3e2nmf,GymLeaderMatt,4,Tue Jul 21 16:07:16 2015 UTC,the T/A has a higher top speed because of all the aero work on the ACR. But the ACR has the potential for faster times because it can carry more speed into the corners because of all the aero work.

The hybrid hypercar trio and the Koenigsegg probably would blow it away in a straight line thanks to much more power and much less drag, but this just might show all four a lesson or two in the twisties.   That being said, I find all these downforce numbers to be misleading. It makes ""nearly a ton"" of downforce (actually 1700lb, not quite ""nearly"" 2000 or 2200lb) at a top speed of 177 mph, but nobody hits a drag limited top speed that high on a racetrack (without a ridiculously long straightaway) let alone takes any corners that fast. Given that downforce proportional to the square of speed barring any active aero, the new ACR makes only about 10-20% more downforce than the previous one at a given speed (1200lb @ 150 mph vs 1000lb) and not double as it would seem."

The original GTS coupe had a higher top speed, and it’s nearly 200hp down on this ACR. The ACR will likely be fighting for those last few mph due to the drag. The Nurburgring probably has one of the better straight sections for trying to get close to top speed during a lap. Something like the C6 ZR1 or C7 ZO6 would just shout ‘Leeroy Jenkins!’ and fire out of Galgenkopf, down that main straight and possibly pass the ACR. I say ‘pass the ACR,’ because the Viper would likely be ahead in the very technical section before reaching the straight.  It would be really interesting to see Chevrolet release a special model with closer ties to their Corvette race car, with aero more like the ACR has. The level 3 aero on the ZO6 is powerful, but more like what the Viper TA has than the ACR."

The committee in charge of the Nurburgring are supposed to meet at the end of the year and decide on how things will be handled in the future.

Pressure loss or head loss are much better terms to talk about.  This article largely refers to the Darcy-Weisbach equation which is derived from energy/pressure conservation equations in an open fluid system.  In general the article does a good job of summarizing the physics of exhaust flow and keeping it easy to understand.  It does leave out an important part of exhaust design, though.  While it's true that pipe diameter is the only thing you can control for the Darcy-Weisbach equation, friction across a pipe length is only responsible for what's called the ""major losses.""  Minor losses due to obstructions/turns in piping are also important and controllable.  Basically, the further away you get from a straight, constant diameter pipe, the more minor losses you get.  Turns in the pipe, changes to the diameter, entrances and exits of chamber (like mufflers), are all examples of minor losses that contribute to pressure/head loss and are controllable via design."

cars,3e1wt7,Omgninjas,12,Tue Jul 21 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"Basically:  The bigger the pipe, the slower your exhaust will move.  At high RPMs, bigger pipe is always better, because less backpressure, and exhaust speed doesn't matter.  At low RPMs, backpressure is still bad, but having high-speed exhaust gases is more important, so a smaller pipe can give you benefits. You can't go too small though, or backpressure will cancel out those benefits."
cars,3e1wt7,tacol00t,4,Tue Jul 21 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"You misread it. Back pressure is bad, and a larger pipe will give you less back pressure, and also since you increased the size of the pipe less velocity as well. What causes the loss of low end torque when pipe size is increased is scavenging. Scavenging is caused by the pulses of exhuast. Each pulse generates an area of vaccum behind it. The higher the velocity of the pulse of exhuast the bigger the area of vacuum. In a smaller pipe each pulse can follow the other and draft like in NASCAR which helps to reduce the force needed to expel the exhuast. When the exhuast pipe becomes too big the exhuast is slowed down enough that the vaccum behind each pulse is too small to draft and those gains are lost. So with a large pipe at low rpms without a lot of pulses of gas there is very little drafting and an increase in pressure. At higher rpms those pulses are closer together and allow drafting and the large pipe helps to lower back pressure. And if you have a turbo it helps smooth out the pulses and makes it a steady stream so you don't have to worry about it as much.   TLDR: Scavenging decides your power, back pressure is always bad, and finding the balance is the hard part unless you have turbo and then bigger is better.  Also on mobile so sorry for any typos I missed."

For an odd ball color, you can't just press a button, you're going to need to take all those parts off the assembly line, and either have them painted by hand (more labor), or shut down the painting robots and clean them out, then refill them with the odd ball color only to shoot like 10 sets of parts at a time.

cars,3e2y0w,Stone_The_Rock,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"$64,000.  But at that point, who's counting?  According to a post I found on a forum, this is from the official printed 918 sales brochure regarding the Liquid Metal Silver (and Chrome Blue):   ""Nine coats of the Liquid Metal paint applied with high precision, three manual processing stages, and three final clear coats guarantee impressive light reflection and extraordinary depth. Every reflection helps to emphasize the contours of the 918 Spyder with even more clarity. The paint is highly vibrant and gives the surface the appearance of liquid metal. We'd even go so far as to claim that rarely has a concept been realized so tangibly.""    And believe me, the color is stunning.  I saw the liquid metal silver in person, and believe me I would pay a 6% premium on a vehicle like that if I wanted silver or a lighter blue.  The poster goes on to say that magnets are used in each stage of the paint to align the metallic flakes in the same direction, which provides uniform reflection matched to the contours of the vehicle.  BMW's ~$10,000 Individual Pure Metal Silver color uses a similar concept (though, IIRC, no magnets are involved).  It's a lot like the Porsche GT Silver (offered on the 911 Turbo and other models @ ~$3,000) and it uses a multi-stage silver paint to give the car much more depth--and it makes a big difference.  Again, on a $200,000 Porsche, paying $3,000 for such a beautiful silver would be a no-brainer for me.  *TL;DR Magnets *"

cars,3dztf9,ASCr,3,Tue Jul 21 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"..... Yet another stupid idea.   What's the point of the button, if you already have to turn the key?  I have a push button start on my car and the entire benefit of that feature is that I don't have to to fumble with my keys.  I push a button on the door handle to unlock it, I get in, and I push the button to start it.  To turn off the car, it's the same process in reverse.  I love it.   The 458 is a beautiful car, but I think sitting behind the wheel of it would make me angry.  I have little tolerance for bullshit in a car.  And this car seems to have a lot of bullshit."
cars,3dztf9,B0h1c4,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"What's the point of the button, if you already have to turn the key?   To make the driver feel like he's at LeMans. This isn't a Ferrari exclusive, the start button in the S2000 was exactly the same (though mounted to the dash).  In the old days at LeMans they had something called the ""LeMans Start"" where the drivers had to run across the track, get in the car, start the engine, and go. This led to the cars having a big start button presented to the driver as a primary control, to shave fractions of a second off that start. It's still done in that sort of race car, even though the LeMans Start is gone for safety reasons, because likewise you don't want to lose seconds fumbling for the starter switch if, say, the car were to stall in the pits or after an off.  In a street car? Pure wannabe race car wankery. Granted, this is Ferrari, but it's not like most 458s will EVER touch a track much less competition."
cars,3dztf9,AKADriver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:23 2015 UTC,"I understand the reason for the button.  I just don't understand why you still have to put a key in and turn it.    At LeMans, they wouldn't have wanted to use the key either.  Just hit the button.    With modern technology, there is a proximity sensor in the key fob so the car knows that you are the owner.  Even Hyundais have it.   It's similar on the Pagani.  You have this beautifully machined key fob, but you still have to stick the thing in the dashboard like a goddamn animal.   It's the same reason we don't have to put the key in the door any longer.  Imagine if you had to put your key in the door and turn it, then push the unlock button.  That's the approach the 458 takes to ignition.   If they want to make it feel like a race car, they should make the driver flip a switch for battery power, flip a switch for fuel pump, then push the button to start.  That would feel a lot more ""race carish""  than having to use a key like it's a 1995 Toyota Corolla."
cars,3dztf9,B0h1c4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"Ah. Yeah, I suppose it is odd that it has no proximity key. It's not like having a physical key cylinder saves weight."

I am not sure about the 575 or 360 but the front bumper on a Murcialago (circa 10 years ago) was 12-14 thousand dollars. Body work on Ferraris isn't too far off that. People think its great that you can buy certain older 80's and 90's Ferraris for cheap but they fail to realize that you still need to pay Ferrari maintenance prices. The general rule is that if you can't pay for maintenance new you can't pay for it used (unless you can fix it yourself which is a different story). Sounds like you got out at the right time.

cars,3dztf9,keitarno,6,Tue Jul 21 13:34:23 2015 UTC,I'm not a lawyer but I have a very basic familiarity with trademark law.  The way trademark law works is you must litigate on every single infringement otherwise you create a precedent allowing other infringers to cite past non-litigation. The law is pretty black and white so it's safer to always litigate.   In reality Trademark law is almost always handled 100% by a legal firm under retainer who will act on your behalf. Also remember that Ferrari is a household name and one of the world's most valuable brands -- the name alone is with about $4 Billion. Might help a bit in seeing why they care so much to protect their brand assets.

In the end, it's not different from people buying any 1500hp+ Supra or GT-R or Gallardo.  There are reasons not to make it have 2000hp, but that comes more down to the fact that it gets really expansive, because you not only need a 2000hp engine, but need to adapt the whole car to handle the power. That's a ton of money in components alone, and not many people will buy such a car.  But on the other hand, of course it's a bit silly to make this tribute car only 100hp more powerful. A good twin-turbo+supercharger setup can easily get you 1000hp+, makes you wonder why they didn't want to crack that magical number. But really, I know why. The only ""real"" reason it makes only 800hp is, that they poured all their time and budget into the engine conversion, and it's low enough that upgrading other components isn't necessary.

cars,3dycpc,mt145,27,Mon Jul 20 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"Kinda, but not really. The Apollo Mustang is part of a partnership between Ford and an organization called the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), based in Oshkosh, WI. Every year the EAA runs an airshow up in Oshkosh called ""Airventure"", which is the biggest airshow in the world. Think your local municipal airport, but with 10,000 planes flying in and 500,000 people. For the past few years, Ford has been donating custom Mustangs to benefit a program run by the EAA called ""Young Eagles"", which is intended to get kids interested in aviation. Every Airventure, there's a banquet and auction called ""The Gathering of Eagles"", to raise money for the Young Eagles program; the Mustang is displayed at the tent for most of the week, and then auctioned off at the banquet.   They've had various themes over the years (in no particular order):    AV8R P-51 Mustang (the car was named after the P-51 Mustang) SR-71 Blackbird Mustang Tuskegee Airmen ""Red Tails"" Mustang Blue Angels Mustang USAF Thunderbirds Mustang F-35B Lightning II Mustang   And then you've probably already seen pictures of the Apollo Mustang. They try to keep with the theme for that year's Airventure, so for instance the year they had the Thunderbirds Mustang was supposed to be the Thunderbirds' debut at Airventure, but the sequester, and resulting halt of the Thunderbirds' show season screwed that. This year, one of the main themes of Airventure is Apollo, because this year is the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 13 mission, hence the Apollo Mustang.      Sorry for the wall of text.   TL;DR: Kinda, but not really."

cars,3dycpc,GearGuy2001,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:03 2015 UTC,I think it is because the power is a little more useable. When u have something like twin screw SC you get ridiculous TQ from very low RPMs. Having 900+ ft lbs from 200 rpms = roasted tires everywhere all the time. centrifugal blowers act more like turbos in sense that the power and torque curves follow the RPMs and you have peak power in the higher RPMS.

You're pre-charging a huge positive displacement supercharger which is normally pulling from atmospheric to make 15 psi... so any amount will make a huge difference. If you send it just 2 psi extra, it's going to be a multiple more at the intake. I'm guessing they underdrove the supercharger a bunch if those turbos are making even just 3 or 4 psi.

cars,3dycpc,firststate,12,Mon Jul 20 20:55:48 2015 UTC,Honestly the biggest difference you feel at that point is torque and peakiness. Mine made 580whp at one point and I've ridden in a 700+whp evo x. Only difference is mine pulls more consistently and his is way peakier.
cars,3dycpc,vegittoss15,10,Mon Jul 20 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that's true for larger displacement motors. A 900hp LSx will usually have a similarly wide powerband as a 600hp LSx car, it just keeps pulling harder with more RPM's. I guess I could use my car as an example, on low boost it actually lags a little bit more than on high boost (the tune is to blame), but once in boost it pulls from about 3800rpms very hard to red line. On high boost (about 300hp more), it still starts pulling and initially feels very similar around 3200 (spooling) to 3700 (full boost). Once RPM's come up in the powerband, however, it feels like your eyes are being pushed into the back of your head...something low boost doesn't quite do. It's hard to explain, it's like a freight train of power that just doesn't stop coming. I wouldn't call it peaky by any means. My turbos are sized just a tad small for a 408ci motor, which is probably why they spool relatively quickly for the displacement. I do have some experience in some 500+hp small displacement cars and what you say is definitely true, but it's mostly due to turbo sizing relative to displacement."
cars,3dycpc,chaddercheese,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:34 2015 UTC,"You're using the same hardware to do all that, though. I have 4 tunes in my gti, spanning 80 (valet) to 260whp. Regardless of the tune the engine is, and feels, the same. Same turbo (and therefore torque) lag, response, intertia, sound, etc. Just bolt on a supercharger and the character of the engine will change drastically. You have a C5 to compare with the 408 so you know there's a massive difference between the character of those engines. Likewise, the Hellcat X would have an entirely different character to the Hellcat with the addition of the turbos."

The newer Vipers are much more tame than one would expect and handle exceedingly well. And Vettes are so easy to make power with, you pretty much just have to sneeze on it and it'll make 20 more horsepower to the tires.

I was talking with a buddy of mine that has one, and what made me realize how good I have it is while we were talking, he walked out to his car and it wouldn't start. And his is one of the cleanest examples of a Gallardo around. I've put nearly 25,000 on the Viper so far and haven't had any problems, other than a trackday cooked my OEM plug wires so I replaced 'em with some neat very high quality handmade ones. from QualityWires.

I was hoping someone could explain why the Hellcat challenger/charger has so much power, but doesn't really seem all that fast for what it's got.   Like, a 2002 Camaro/Trans Am/Corvette- the Hellcat has twice the power, but the bump in 0-60 and quarter mile isn't all that huge. Is it aerodynamics, weight, just how the Hellcat uses the power?   ELI5 if possible, please?"
cars,3dycpc,comach2,8,Mon Jul 20 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"Well the answer is weight and lack of AWD but really, I'm not sure where you're getting the idea that the Hellcat isn't all that fast. It's fast as...uh...hell!! I mean how many cars can you buy off the show room floor that can do a 11.2 quarter mile and hit 200mph?! If you put aggressive summer radials on the back wheels ($600 ""mod""), you'll hit 0-60 in 2.9 which is amazing for a RWD car and you'll get 10.8 1/4 mile. These numbers are unheard of for most any production vehicle let alone one that cost only around $70k.  If you get a chance you might want to go for a ride in one. I've driven a 4th gen Trans Am and a Challenger Hellcat and while I love the TA (one of my favorite cars ever!!), it's not even in the same stratosphere as a Hellcat. You can cruise at 90mph yet even then if you floor it, you'll still pin everyone to their seat. The power and torque is always on tap and as a result Hellcat's are scary fast!"
cars,3dycpc,sinurgy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"The main thing hurting Hellcat acceleration times are weight and relative lack of traction. Stock Hellcats that have street legal drag radials instead of stock rear tires have broken into the high 10's in the quarter mile.   Personally I think the stock traction is a hoot since I'm not racing my car, just enjoying it on the street. Being able to burn rubber when flooring it at 40MPH is fun!"
cars,3dycpc,acog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:59 2015 UTC,"Well it's not always going to translate to a quick 0-60, it's a bigger higher revving engine meant to use more of the horsepower at higher revs and higher gears. And it is pretty big and heavy but I'm not sure that alone slows it that much as the power:weight ratio is still good with that much HP.  I'm no expert but yeah it's mainly that it uses more of the power later rather than just off the line, I'm sure it goes a much higher top speed than most comparable cars with a faster 0-60, and also it would help the 0-60 if it was AWD."
cars,3dycpc,solidsnakem9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"Acceleration is usually limited to tire grip and weight. That said, the hellcat is fast. You can double horsepower but 1/4 mi times aren't gonna halve. You can double power but top speeds spiny double.

Three other engine families are notable for their swaps; LS, Windsor, and Modular. The LS family goes without saying. Windsor means it's easy to put a 351 based engine in anything that had a 302. Modular is where it's real fun. You have a family that runs the gamut from the high strung NA 5.4 of the Cobra R to the big bad blown engines of the Cobra/GT500/Lightning, and you can more or less wedge them into anything that came with a 4.6/5.4 from a Town Car to a Crown Vic to a base Mustang (fox/SN95/new edge) to an F150 and my personal favorite, into a lowly little Fairmont.  Can't forget the 2.3 Lima either. Available as a potent turbocharged version in the xr4ti and Mustang SVO, they can go into base model foxes, Rangers, or even Pintos."

I think the Stratus is one. Ive seen the SRT4 motors in a bunch of 80/90s 4cly cars(Omni, Lebaron, etc). Recently someone sold a lebaron wagon with the SRT4 motor/trans. It was so fucking ugly but was pure sleeper status.  Oddly the Dodge avenger can fit a 4g63(bolt in) since it used a mitsu engine from the factory. Granted you have to rewire the entire thing."

Another interesting place you can stuff a turbo 2.4 is a 2nd/3rd gen Caravan. They were offered factory with an NA 2.4, and the SRT parts bolt on. Now that is a sleeper. Also noteworthy is the 1st gen Caravans that were offered with the Turbo I/II, which could also be swapped into the base ones."

cars,3e31rp,jailbot,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:59 2015 UTC,The caveat is wiring. Subaru doesn't follow the usual Japanese car practice of having a separate engine and chassis harness.

cars,3e31rp,rudbri93,4,Tue Jul 21 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"The pony cars should have little or no issues when it comes to swapping the V8 engines into the lower trim cars.  The one caveat with this type of move is pretty big. The performance models rarely have a more powerful engine as the only difference. There's often a laundry list of other performance hardware that is added, along with amenities and optional extras. You can make a sleeper by doing the swap, but at the same time, you could be making a compromised car if you don't include the matching hardware. You have the more powerful engine, but now your brakes, wheels, tires, suspension and transmission aren't up to snuff. That's why it's often recommended to just sell your lower trim car and buy a car with the performance trim outright. Here's an example of this dilemma with a Toyota Celica If you go ahead and take the time to add the matching hardware, then you can easily outweigh the cost of just getting the performance model in the first place, and still not have the complete package.   All those changes will mean taking a hit when the time comes to sell, because you've spent quite a bit of money, and will have difficulty getting much of it back when selling. Your extensively modified base car won't have the same appeal as the stock performance trim car that likely still has more equipment on it anyway."

It's smooth, both in its vibrations and the way it puts power to the ground. It's great to drive both on the street and on the track. The Z4M would be so much less desirable to me without the S54.

The Venom's interior looks exactly like you'd expect from a tuner company. Nicely executed but super simple. Air bags? Sorry, not in this $1.2M car.    but they don't even list stopping distance   Since the car doesn't have ABS, I'm guessing no one is brave enough to try to set a number. Stomping on the brakes at over 150MPH in a short wheelbase car with no ABS is an exercise best left to the very brave and very skilled.   IMO the Venom GT is inexcusably crude for its price range."

Even the lower power level is specifically for this purpose - give the car too much power and it will be too easy to loose control in a drift.

These guys remove the front sway bar, make the rear end almost solid, which makes a fucking FWD car OVERSTEER just naturally, and especially on liftoff, and they run really aggressive tires for grip.  I got a ride in a Auto X set up honda fit, and we were on 2 wheels more than I would have liked. And on 3 most every corner.   Running that sort of setup on the street is very dangerous."

If you're in the market for a small two door coupe, it's a great option. The only downside I found for daily driving is it just has no torque. It's a quick car, and it's great in the corners, but if you're driving it around town and on the highway, the lack of power shows.  The build quality and reliability is there if it's what you're looking for. If you want something fast but practical, the Fiesta ST, Focus ST, Golf GTI, and WRX are all great options. The GTI with the DSG is probably the most adult and daily friendly car. The Fiesta is the most fun, The Focus is just a bigger, more adult Fiesta, and the WRX is a great driving car but the interior is meh."
cars,3e3gd9,mc_nibbles,0,Tue Jul 21 17:57:34 2015 UTC,"For what the average person looks for in a daily, probably not. The other post mentioning torque is correct. The non-enthusiast likes low-end torque, because they aren’t driving fast, where upper rpm power comes into play. They want good pickup off the line from a stop sign or a traffic light. They want to cruise on the highway, but be able to easily make an overtake maneuver. In both cases, your engine is operating at lower rpm levels, but can be quick to respond within reason. An engine with low-end torque is going to be able to move the vehicle more effectively in those situations.  In cars like the FR-S/GT86/BRZ, you need to use the revs to get them going. This is something that usually just enthusiasts will want to do, and not even all the time, because if you’re traveling at low speeds, you don’t have much leeway to do it. Most of the time while driving, you will just be commuting and running errands. Enthusiasts will try to find opportunities to do more spirited driving, but that’s still going to make up a small portion of their time behind the wheel. To some, a car that needs to be revved isn’t going to be as fun as they thought it might be, because they have little time to put the car through its paces. I’ve heard of people taking an FR-S back, getting a tC, and enjoying that more. It’s sad, but again, most people aren’t going to be able to really put these cars to use. Try the FR-S on a test drive and see how it feels for you. You may end up wanting something more like a GTI that doesn’t have the same dynamic edge, but has a sporting character that is more usable and accessible."

Even then I dont think it's necessarily about the slow car it's more about being invisible. You can be an obscene asshole because you arent being loud and annoying while doing it.
cars,3e364n,munky9002,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"There are no slow cars you can drive fast while stock. To make something slow into a fast car you must modify it heavily.    They are only talking about driving these slow cars in a fast manner, as in hustling them and beating on them. It doesn't mean that the cars need to be fast, or else they wouldn't be talking about such slow cars in the first place.  The inspiration for the article comes from the old adage that 'it's more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.' Basically, it's going to be more fun to take something like a Mitsubishi Mirage and blast through some backroads than it would to be stuck in creeping traffic in a Viper ACR, because in the latter case, you aren't even doing anything. At least in the Mirage, you're pushing hard and really driving."

Not how I read the article.    The inspiration for the article comes from the old adage that 'it's more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.'   That's my point and what you just said wasnt the case.    The inspiration for the article comes from the old adage that 'it's more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.' Basically, it's going to be more fun to take something like a Mitsubishi Mirage and blast through some backroads than it would to be stuck in creeping traffic in a Viper ACR   Now you're comparing apples to oranges.   If you're in creeping traffic in the slow car vs viper acr. The viper ACR will always be better.  If you're chasing the slow car in the viper where it's at the limit but the viper is yawning. The viper is having a better time.   If you're beyond the slow car's capabilities in the viper you're having a better time.  You misunderstand slow car fast adage completely.   It's about modifying the slow car to be fast and that's going to be more fun."

cars,3e1iqi,LeetHarveyOswald,12,Tue Jul 21 06:12:44 2015 UTC,We're going to need much better pics. Especially of any part numbers or markings.
cars,3e1iqi,verdegrrl,4,Tue Jul 21 06:15:58 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this is the only picture i have. It was a torquoise/teal car and it was night so i couldnt make out a model
cars,3e1iqi,IFuckingLovePDFFiles,7,Tue Jul 21 06:39:58 2015 UTC,So you threw it away after taking that picture of it? You can't take any more?
cars,3e1iqi,verdegrrl,5,Tue Jul 21 07:34:39 2015 UTC,Its with the police now. They took it as evidence iirc

cars,3e1iqi,CM_Pun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:49:45 2015 UTC,There was a peice of code with letters and numbers on the inside. A google search only took us to a manufacturing company by the name of that code. My friend has it written down. I can provide it if you wish
cars,3e1iqi,Avocandos,4,Tue Jul 21 07:07:01 2015 UTC,so where's the mirror now?

Also, it looks like you are in a neighborhood so I would to to the street and maybe knock on doors and ask if anybody has cameras. Most likely, somebody has cameras aimed at the street."

cars,3e1iqi,Avocandos,4,Tue Jul 21 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"According to the code its produced by SMR. Also, according to a news article ""SMR USA had sales of $226 million last year, producing mirrors for Chrysler, Nissan, GM, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, Tesla, Mercedes and Mazda, according to figures from the firm. Chrysler is its biggest customer, accounting for 28 percent of its sales.""  We can maybe reduce our search down to these manufactures. Also, OP, do you have any sort of recollection of the car, like was it a small passenger car, a large truck or an SUV...really any piece of info is valuable.  Or any other markings on the mirror. Did it have turn signals on it? Were there wires coming out the bottom? Some of these things let us know if it was a higher-end car with lots of features or a base model car.   sauce: http://www.voicenews.com/articles/2015/01/22/news/doc54c13c35f2c59382823617.txt  EDIT: Im goign to go ahead and eliminate Tesla, and Merc...I don't remember either of them have those mirrors or colors.   EDIT2: Whats everyone think of a first gen ford fusion in that color?  EDIT3: Im putting in my vote for a 2010 (or + a couple years, but first gen) Ford Fusion in metallic blue: http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Uk5hfWNK--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18nd5rzfdcspgjpg.jpg"

cars,3e1iqi,Futurskullz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"That's actually pretty helpful. Not really any 4 door mazdas that have mirrors like that, same with merc. You being in Canada will also change a couple things on which cars are available."
cars,3e0yzt,W35,6,Tue Jul 21 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"Some of the stuff that made Top Gear great was just the banter between the hosts. The video has potential but no one's giving each other shit about their choice, no one's describing their experience in the car, there's no talking to the viewer, it's just music. Top Gear clips use a little bit of music when going through a new car and it can be well placed, but I don't want to just listen to music for 14 minutes.  It's also a lot easier to do with a big production team and all that jazz so kudos."
cars,3e0yzt,GhostReddit,11,Tue Jul 21 14:08:05 2015 UTC,The music kills the whole video. It's like horrible 2006 Good Charlotte.
cars,3e0yzt,Fenrir85,2,Tue Jul 21 08:59:30 2015 UTC,Where did you guys do this? My friends and I have been dreaming about destroying some $500 cars for a long time but we don't have a location to legally dick around in cars (or at least somewhere we wouldn't be noticed.)
cars,3e0yzt,SlimKlim,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the input guys! I share some of your thoughts/concerns as well.  Regarding equipment, yeah... we had terrible preparation. Low batteries, no chargers, full memory cards. Most ended up being filmed on phones which is not ideal.  Regarding banter, it's tough having a camera rolling in the right place and right time with a lack of crew/equipment. And I felt it was worse when we tried to recreate those moments.  Music I always end up struggling with. Might play with doing voice overs the next time.  Considering the shambles that go on behind the scenes, I'm decently happy with the result."
cars,3e0yzt,Clean-one,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"I'm 5 minutes in and I already really liked this! In my opinion, the music was a bit too loud-it felt a bit like a music video."

This type if video is the best you can do if you just want to have fun and film what you're doing.  If you want to make an 'actual' video you have to set up scenes, and do so many takes and so much setup it becomes all about the filming and not about just getting out there and having fun."
