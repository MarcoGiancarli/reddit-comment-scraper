Drumkits,3dyfjs,screaminginfidels,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"Quickly made this with the beatbox freestyle Cara Delevingne did on Jimmy Fallon.   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVO7-L9-pkQ)  I cut it into breaks and deleted any parts where the audience were cheering.   There's a few claps, closed hi hats, kicks, open hi hats, snares and the original breaks I used to sample them from.  57 sounds and 5 breaks in total.  Enjoy!"
Drumkits,3dyfjs,theidiotfromla,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:42 2015 UTC,DOPE!
Drumkits,3dld5p,daveminer87,3,Fri Jul 17 05:15:13 2015 UTC,"What kind of feedback are you looking for?  The hats, toms and snares sound excellent, nice variety, well recorded, really enjoyed them and will likely use a couple.  Great work there and I appreciate the upload.   The kicks, to me, are a little weak (volume wise, and ooomph) and I didn't really care for the vocals, too much hissssss on there.    But....it's a really great sounding kit, i'm just splitting hairs.   I'm really looking for a brush on snare sound if you have one of those lying around?"
Drumkits,3dld5p,SingleFinSoul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"This feedback is perfect. TY!   The kick doesn't have a ton of oomph, but its intended to be a unique alternative... would you never use it?  The vox are VERY hissy. I was curious if anyone would actually dig them. I may just pull them from this kit.  As for the brush set, I am working on a loop and sample set based on brushes. It isn't ready yet tho."
Drumkits,3djbpx,benrod1,3,Thu Jul 16 19:01:05 2015 UTC,not worth the money imo

Drumkits,3djbpx,Hamtastic1121,5,Fri Jul 17 00:30:05 2015 UTC,"They're worth a download but I'm not sure they're worth the money.  A lot of the samples are either hit or miss, some of them I can't imagine ever needing to use.  Plus some of the SFX samples sound a little cheap."

Drumkits,3c3ydy,MeltDown52,2,Sat Jul 4 23:28:31 2015 UTC,"Hi, there are folders clap, kick, cymbal,snare etc. Well you will need some time to browse it all and pick what you would like to use in your music production. It will last hours to make kits out of all these sounds, that´s why it is only in folders by type of sound. Best way is to make your own directories, pick sounds what you like. There are drums for any music style i believe."

Drumkits,3c2613,penismcpennis,7,Sat Jul 4 02:35:22 2015 UTC,Feel free to take the liberty to do this because I sure as shit don't like fiddling w/ Audioz.  He's taken something that for many people is a hassle and turned it into a convenience for the people subscribed. Just chill.
Drumkits,3c2613,mesabeats,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:21:19 2015 UTC,"Audioz has seen steady traffic regardless of the state of third party uploads. Yes, every download that goes toward some individual uploader is one less for Audioz, but this is comparable to someone choosing Arby's over McDonald's. At the end of the day both parties will remain and prosper, coinciding to leave us as the downloaders with nothing less than options.  Maybe you're mad that he might be making money,  but I honestly doubt that r/drumkits generates enough traffic to outweigh the hours he's put into managing and overseeing this resource for producers. If the circumstances were different I would definitely side with you, but this act is nearly harmless in the long run and provides us with an organized list of easy to download samples."

Drumkits,3bav0x,HULKAVELLI,7,Sat Jun 27 13:19:08 2015 UTC,"I'm about to check this out now. Thanks for the upload and I'll give my full detailed opinion on this bad boy shortly.   EDIT: Ok. This kit is really well made.    Kicks. The kicks are really dope and great for multiple styles of producing whether it be boombap, southsynth, low end, mid trap. They have a well blended feel to them. Not overpowering. Most Kick Mixers (generally speaking for producers who make kits) make them inoperable purposely for 2 reasons. 1 being they don't know how to mix kicks/808/bass in raw state. or 2 They do it because they don't want other producers to sound like them or make shit the easy way (so to speak). But these are mixed indubitably well.  I'm going to give them  8/10. Low end mixing is tough for even the most advanced audio engineers.  FX. These Transitions are a tiny bit generic but definitely not common in terms of usage (speaking from the standpoint of a producer who makes transitions from scratch). Raise and decline sweep style transitions are the future. I enjoy the mixing on all of them except for one in particular ""OTHChainingDownlifter"". (just my opinion, don't mean it isn't good) I'm not a big fan of sidechaining. I like it when it's blended well in the mix, it's just got too much of a ""forced sidechain"" feel to it. all in all 7/10 Percs. These misc percussion sounds are almost what I expected in terms of miscellaneous hihats/filler sounds. Very reverb-ish and high end EQing. (definitely not a bad thing) Easily blendable and thats what producers SHOULD be looking for when they are researching for technique or motivation when creating their own. 8/10 Snares & Claps. And this is where most people who can't take critique, hate me.. I'm sorry to say but these particular claps/snare (besides 4 of them) are very generic. They all seem to carry the same reverb amount and gain. The EQing on them are subpar. but still ok. Definitely not horrible though. These claps/snares are definitely better than a lot of kit creator comparisons, however these seem to throw off the kit. because out of everything, these seem to make it easy for people to overlook the kit as a whole. I'm gonna give this a 6/10. (still not bad though.)   Saving the best for last.   SAMPLE PACK    These....... Where do I start with these elegant, beautiful, merciful, amazing sample cuts?  I've been through at LEAST over 60k samples in my career (16 years in!) and these bad boys are very operable. These samples are greatly formatted. Amusing to the ears and they have this ""atmospheric"" feel to them like drifting away, yet if mixed in a track right, can be sculpted to go anywhere, feel wise. I'm definitely taking these and gonna chop em up and give them a go. I'm in love with these. 10/10 for sure    OVERALL This kit gets a 97%/100% rating. This kit can be used by itself to create something very nice with little mixer track work. You don't get that with kits too often. I would definitely recommend this to any producer who uses sample packs. Good job.    FYI. I'm a registered R.I.A.A producer, Registered AVID FLStudio user. Keep up the good work."
