kings,3e51g1,yopeee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:19:17 2015 UTC,His legs are getting old..  So he relies more on skill and ball IQ. Slows down the game and makes intelligent passes. Having a backup passer is better than a mediocre scorer. Add in vet experience and personal relationship with the coach... Better option IMO.

If he didn't get the 3rd string PG spot here, I highly doubt anyone else would want a 40 year old point guard. If anything, maybe he's calling it quits and he joins Karl as part of his coaching staff?"

kings,3e51g1,N1celyDunn,0,Wed Jul 22 01:22:25 2015 UTC,That's not true he just had a great summer league.. He was fantastic on Duke! I would rather have someone who can make a big difference than a person who is a good passer.. Curry can pass I have no idea what you are talking about..

kings,3e02lj,hipnerd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:55:33 2015 UTC,He might not have wanted to move from starter to buried 3 deep on the bench.
kings,3e02lj,James__Franco,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:48 2015 UTC,I mean he was only starter because of injuries. 3rd string PG will get playing time with us since Karl loves 2 pg lineups.
kings,3e02lj,hipnerd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Maybe we were still planning on getting more depth in that initial free-agency push and it didn't pan out.   Our roster is still imperfect, but it is years better than it was."

kings,3e02lj,HSBen,2,Tue Jul 21 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"Had to come in here to see what peoples response to this would be.  Hes an insane character guy, his father was a scout for the Bulls back in Jordans day.  He was a ball boy for Bulls etc.   Yea he didn't get alot of minutes in Bo's rotation mainly because of Dekker and Kaminsky, but he has a good stroke.  Greg Steisma a guy who barely played at Wisconsin is a rotation guy(although his height has alot to do with that), so there is precedent here."
kings,3e02lj,Marcush5000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about him, but just looking at his college stats, how does a guy with 4.6 ppg and 2.6 rpg make it into the nba level? I assume he's just got potential and didn't see much play-time with Kaminsky, but I don't get how these guys, who don't even start in college, get the attention of nba teams"
kings,3e02lj,matty25,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:34 2015 UTC,That's a good question. Apparently he's a floor spacing 4 but he shot .319 PCT from the 3 point line. That's not very good for college ball.  But as non-guaranteed filler for our roster I won't complain.
kings,3e02lj,CeJeH,5,Tue Jul 21 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"He shot 41.7% from 3p in Summer League and has a beautiful, smooth stroke and a quick release. He's also 6'10 and didn't start because he played behind Frank Kaminsky, Sam Dekker, and Nigel Hayes on an excellent team.  He has really solid potential. Great pickup for us."
kings,3e02lj,matty25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean in 5 summer league games he looked fine. That's not a very large sample size though.  And I get why he came off the bench in college. But the fact is, he stunk in college, even when he did play.  I don't think he has ""really solid potential"". Apparently most NBA teams don't either, he wasn't even a 2nd round draft pick.  But as I said, if he's filler for the 15th spot what does it really matter. Maybe he can carve out a niche."
kings,3e02lj,CeJeH,7,Tue Jul 21 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"I would say that he has solid potential, especially for a guy that is going to play on a non-guaranteed rookie contract. We can stash him in Reno for awhile and let him take 10 3's per game to work on his stroke and focus on moving the ball in an up-tempo offense, and see how he does. Solid potential for a rookie 6'10 shooter that's going to be at the end of the bench for awhile. If he sucks then we can just cut him.  I know 5 games doesn't mean shit, but i watched all of his minutes and the guy can really shoot. He has a high, quick release. He gets his feet set and squared quickly. He has a smooth, fluid stroke thats the same every time. He has the chance to be a really good 3p shooter, which is exactly what the Kings need.  He's a guy who, if he develops properly, can play alongside Boogie, Koufos, or WCS and create a lot of spacing issues for the defense. He's worth the risk. And it's not much of a risk.  Edit: Just wanted to add that Dukan can play the 4 or the 3 imo"
kings,3e02lj,matty25,3,Tue Jul 21 02:39:29 2015 UTC,"Those are fair points. And you're right, we can stash him Reno and see what he does there."

kings,3dzz6z,Ethanhekker,3,Mon Jul 20 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"I really like his positioning on both ends of the court. I don't know if it's instincts or a lot of work, but he is great at rolling or rotating to the right spot to open up a good passing lane on the offensive end. On the defensive side, he slides very well and times his rotations very well. He does get caught out of position every now and then because it seems like he's used to being able to recover with his athleticism, but I think that'll be easy to fix.  I know a lot of people talk about basketball IQ in terms of guys who play well with the ball in their hands, but WCS seems to have a high basketball IQ in the way he plays off the ball. His head is always up and moving and he is able to anticipate rotations before they happen. I think with more experience at this level he'll learn quickly and become a big part of our team sooner rather than later."
kings,3dzz6z,ChangloriousBastard,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:36 2015 UTC,"i mean, the blocks are just phenomenal. for his height, the guy has phenomenal speed. but this is a well known fact.  if hes moving to the 5, he needs to beef up to play against dwight/gasol/davis/duncan/etcetc"

The downvote button has always been used excessively, and there's always been a portion of the fans there that are missing a few nuts and bolts. It's an NBA fan community. It's Reddit. It's any community, really. It's just higher volume, and you're going to have more bad experiences than before. Even if the percentage of bad experiences goes down, you're going to feel like you're being shit on all the time because the bad ones are the ones you remember most. That's why EVERY FUCKIN FANBASE thinks that /r/nba/ hates them.  Besides, I tend to think that anyone who disagrees with my optimism is super negative, unintelligent, and circle jerky, despite the fact that at no point during the last 14 years of being a Kings fan has the team actually lived up to those optimistic expectations. Objectively that's pretty fuckin insane for me to show up every year and act like we got a good thing comin, but shit, if we don't believe, who the fuck else is going to believe for us?"

With that being said, it's not just /r/NBA. Every single ""sports journalism"" articles has always been skewed to take a shit on us. Thus alot of that anti-kings circle jerk gets posted on /r/nba. I just take everything with a grain of salt and hopefully we surprise the league by storm. I mean we surprised everybody at the beginning last season until Cousins took a meningitis hit yeah?"
kings,3dv6c7,Narwhail0r,5,Sun Jul 19 20:43:47 2015 UTC,The sports writers that stir up shit with no substance whatsoever are the big problem. /r/nba is just full of airheads that repeat whatever they see ad nauseum.

That sub mostly just abides by whatever they see on TV, or read about on Twitter or on Grantland or whatever.  /r/NBA is not the problem. For all the shit they give the Kings when we do stupid things (which our team has done A LOT of over the last couple years) they also love us whenever good things happen. They generally appreciate us, the Fanbase, for our severe loyalty. They appreciate Boogie, and Rudy. They seem to love WCS. They mostly supported us during the relocation saga. And you can rest assured that if the Kings are successful this season and make a playoff run, we will be one of their favorite teams.  I think the problem is that Kings fans have been so battered for so long that our Fanbase has become overly sensitive. In the last few weeks I've seen many posts like this on this sub that have been generally anti-/r/NBA. I've seen Kings fans attack every writer or blogger on Twitter that had anything even remotely negative to say about the team. Frankly, it's really disappointing and makes our Fanbase look bad.  At this point, we should be de-sensitized from all of the abuse that we've taken over the years. With all the bullshit we have been through, why let some dumb hive mind posts on a forum bother you? Just let it go. It doesn't matter. It's certainly not worth hating the entire rest of the NBA over."

I'd say our franchise was right to stick with Boogie and ditch IT.

Granted there are certain things if you say you get automatically downvoted to oblivion, or if you think the Kings will do better than the T-Wolves next season. Most guys on /r/nba don't even watch the Kings aside from maybe one or two games on ESPN or TNT, so they just take our record and assume we're ass; Boogie isn't a legit T5 player etc etc.  I know what I know, and I don't really care anymore if some redditor thinks every move our FO makes is horrible, Vivek doesn't know what he's doing or whatever else there is.

kings,3dwxbx,guy15s,2,Mon Jul 20 05:27:32 2015 UTC,"One decent takeaway is that Karl has adapted quite a bit in his career as a coach... it's just such a long career that it's easy to forget.   I think combining his fast paced offense with our big guys could make us the team that finally hits on how to exploit small ball teams with size. The problem as I see it with going to big guys against a team like Golden State, is that they usually have more than enough time for their smaller, quicker players to rotate on help defense. Having 4-5 inches on your defender becomes less helpful when you have two of them. If he can find a way to use Rondo's passing (or just more passing in general) to get the ball to Boogie/WCS in motion towards the basket and not with their feet planted against a set defense, we're more likely to see situations where they're going one on one against their smaller defender and use their size. We have two big men who are really athletic and have excellent footwork so I think he can find a way to do this.  It's going to be critical that our three point shooting is there to give our bigs room to work. For this team to hit it's potential I think Collison/Belinelli/McLemore need to all be at/above 0.370 from deep (two of the three were there last year) and I'd like to see at least one of them at 0.400 (Marco has done it before)."
kings,3dwxbx,jkopecky,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah as an outsider here, I just don't like how Karl fits with this particular Kings roster.   Karl wants 30 free throws, 30 layups and 30 assists every game, which reflects his core beliefs in ball movement, pushing the ball quickly up court and driving to the rim.   The Kings have lots of isolation talent. Cousins and Gay will pass the ball, but they're not optimally used as quick ball-movers. Rondo too: he's an assists machine but not in a Spursian swing-it-side-to-side type way. He also didn't want to run much in Dallas.   The only real restrictions on offense: Don’t hold the ball and don’t take 2-point jump shots   Yeah this a huge part of Rudy Gay's game. And he's damn good at it.  I might just make a separate post about this. Perhaps he changes his style to fit the roster but his comments about Cousins suggest he's wanted to do the opposite--change the roster to fit his style."
kings,3dwxbx,Eckcalibur,11,Mon Jul 20 06:49:34 2015 UTC,"No. Rudy's iso game was fucking horrid with Malone and especially under Corbin. When Karl finally took the helm, Rudy found a system that gave him better looks. As far as Cousins goes.. Well Karl is going to have to adapt to Big Cuz if he wants to keep coaching the Kings lol."
kings,3dwxbx,Narwhail0r,0,Mon Jul 20 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"Rudy was awesome under Malone; he had his best games of the season under Malone, not to mention the previous half season. He was bad without Cousins, not under Malone."
kings,3dwxbx,Eckcalibur,6,Mon Jul 20 12:48:30 2015 UTC,"Pre and Post Karl  Yeah I understand the variables as well. No one gets comfortable until around post-ASB, he was also without Cousins for almost a month. With Karl we saw him more in a stretch 4 role. He took less iso shots which lead to a lower TO ratio. My issue isn't his iso play. It was the fact that it was either feed the ball to Cousins or a Rudy iso. It was the only offense the Kings had pre-ASB. However with this new line-up, I don't think we're going to see much of Rudy at the 4 if the roster ends being the one I'm thinking of  Rondo - PG  Ben - SG  Rudy - SF  Cousins - PF  Koufos - C  In fact we might see him execute more iso's this upcoming season. But at least we know he will do a decent job if we used hims as a stretch 4."
kings,3dwxbx,Narwhail0r,2,Mon Jul 20 13:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a nice stretch of games, but then again it's just 20 games. His first 15 before Cousins went down were pretty good too. If Karl works it all out good on him, I just see a scenario in which it doesn't, which would be shame considering there is talent on this Kings roster.  That lineup--it's a good lineup, but as you say not a small ball, wing it around the court and run type of lineup. Will be very interesting to see how Karl uses Koufos"
kings,3dwxbx,Eckcalibur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I wasn't saying he was horrible by any means under Malone. Rudy's iso just sucked because it was our go to offense when Cousins sat on the bench. His iso game shouldn't be our 1 or 2 option in my opinion. But other than that I would love to see what Karl can do with this roster! I'm sure with a small ball line up it would include both Rondo and DC on there. DC's speed is underrated imo."
kings,3dwxbx,Narwhail0r,2,Tue Jul 21 08:27:42 2015 UTC,"when Cousins sat on the bench    Which was my initial point. This is going to happen whether Malone or Karl is the coach. Karl doesn't possess some secret potion to keep DeMarcus from getting viral meningitis*, nor did Malone infect Cousins with the illness (I don't even know if it's contagious but you get the point)  Yes, it's not a good idea to just give Rudy the ball every possession and ask him to score (although there are situations where it's a good idea, as we saw with the Cavs in the Finals). If Malone did that then that's no good. I'm just not convinced Karl's alternative ideas are the way to go for Rudy and the rest of the Kings. Again, if Karl works it all out then good for him   His iso game shouldn't be our 1 or 2 option in my opinion   I disagree with this. I think that in the half court, a Rudy post-up on the baseline is an ideal 2 option, the 1 option being something with Cousins (either in the post or as the roll guy). It's where he scores and passes best from imo, and best takes advantage of mismatches. Anyway, maybe this whole discussion is moot and Karl adapts his coaching style a bunch. I'm an optimist.  And yeah, the small ball/two-PG stuff… that's another discussion and I don't want to keep being negative haha. I have some very pointed opinions about two-PG lineups and think going to them wastes the talent on this Kings roster. But again, Karl's the hall of famer and I'm just some dude."
kings,3dwxbx,Eckcalibur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:40:05 2015 UTC,"I'm an optimist.   Haha! You sure you're not a Kings fan? That's basically what Kings fans are!   Karl adapts his coaching style a bunch.   I think the difference now with the roster is we actually have some shooters we can rely on. So moving the ball around can and will give us the opportunity to play with our offense.    If Malone did that then that's no good.   The thing with Malone was that he was a defensive minded coach. So basically he had no system for an offense. That's why our offense relied heavily on Rudy Gay's iso and Cousins. Now that we have actual shooters we can kick the ball out to, Rudy Gay doesn't have to take as much iso shots. Hopefully Karl is smart enough to use Rudy Gay's iso in crucial moments. Cause that's where I think he shines in iso plays.   That way we get more videos like this posted :D"
kings,3dwxbx,Narwhail0r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"I'm just an optimist in general, especially in the offseason. I think the Pelicans (my team) Bucks, Magic, Kings, Knicks, Kings, Wolves and Pistons have the potential to make big time improvements next season.  But yeah good luck to Karl, he has a pretty versatile roster to work with. I'm a big Belinelli fan, hope he has a good shooting year"
kings,3dwxbx,Eckcalibur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"This is something I've been bringing this up occasionally in this sub, I feel like Karl clashes with parts of our roster and that it may not be pretty. On the flip side, maybe being an incredibly experienced coach he can adjust his style to the players players he has available. Here's to optimism."
kings,3dwxbx,ItsNotSpaghetti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:26:18 2015 UTC,Old dog new tricks? As much as I hope this could be the case I just don't really get the feeling that Karl is that flexible.
kings,3dsf3u,Vitatim-t,29,Sun Jul 19 00:30:02 2015 UTC,Probably the best defensive player. Future DPOY imo
kings,3dsf3u,truwarier14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'd just gotten the ""DPOY"" song out of my head."
kings,3dsf3u,TWK128,12,Mon Jul 20 07:05:13 2015 UTC,Doubt he'll be the best. Definitely looking like a good pick though! Hoping his high level of play continues into the regular season!
kings,3dsf3u,GentleGenitalia,9,Sun Jul 19 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"His upside is insane, so I wouldn't count him out.  But I wouldn't say he's most likely to be best in this draft, there are some other's I'd put before him."
kings,3dsf3u,IMDATBOY,10,Sun Jul 19 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Howard is a better rebounder, particularly on the offensive end. Howard also has much better offensive instincts and has an okay post-move game. Trill has a lot to work on to be a better offensive player.  To the point about him being the best player in the draft, I think it's not out of the question. I think his ceiling is 12-15 points and 10 rebounds with a lot of steals and blocks, and just general solid defense. It may not be a flashy stat line but he can certainly valuable. There is a lot of work between where he is now and his ceiling. The unfortunate reality, though, is that defensive focused players are undervalued in this league, particularly by the average fan. If he only averages 12 points a game in his prime, few people will even think to consider WCS as a candidate for best player of the draft, even if he is the league leader in blocks and the DPOY.  The good thing about a player like WCS is that they are add value to a team even if they're under-appreciated by the casual fan. Aside from Demarcus Cousins, I think WCS has the potential to be the player most critical to our long term success. A DPOY type guy directly creates wins, and WCS has that potential. True defensive anchors are extremely important assets in this league, and the Kings may have just snagged one with the 6th pick. At this point, I'm not sure I would have wanted anyone else even if we had the 1st pick."
kings,3dsf3u,ChangloriousBastard,3,Sun Jul 19 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"honestly, with first pick id definitely choose towns or okafor. WCS just has speed over these two, but no strength.   i think we just made the better pick of WCS over mudiay."
kings,3dsf3u,adriantada,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:00 2015 UTC,"I think Larry Bird was telling WCS he is gonna be the best player in the draft and the Pacers would even built around him at some point, so it's probably not that baseless of an opinion.  I don't think that WCS will be individually the best, or the most complete of all the players, or a franchise player, but he could very well turn out to be the ""most valuable"" in a literal sense, especially if all goes well with Rondo and he turns him into a 15ppg player to go with his defensive skillset."
kings,3dsf3u,uututhrwa,8,Tue Jul 21 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"D12?  You are comparing WCS to the wrong player.  Dwight was much more stronger and already had a NBA developed body coming out of college.  You should be comparing WCS to a prime Marcus Camby, that is his ceiling IMO. He will probably win multiple DPOY's awards when it's all said and done.  Hopefully he and Cousins can play together, they have the potential to be the best pf/c tandem in the NBA if WCS lives up to his potential.  How do you guys think Cousins will do at the pf position?"
kings,3dsf3u,Rocketz1Bruh,4,Sun Jul 19 02:48:05 2015 UTC,"Celtics fan here. Isn't Cousin best in the post? Will he be able to operate in the post with WCS at C?  edit: I noticed someone downvoted me ... this wasn't meant to be an offensive question, just a question about offense"
kings,3dsf3u,BQGIE,4,Sun Jul 19 06:58:04 2015 UTC,Cousins always wanted to play the 4 next to a defensive minded center.
kings,3dsf3u,geekus_mayne,2,Sun Jul 19 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"He wanted to play 4 on offense. DMC will never play 4 defensively in the traditional sense when he's paired with WCS. WCS was drafted to play the mobile 4s and be a C when DMC takes a break.  If anyone were to make DMC guard the PF while WCS guarded a C (again, in the traditional sense), then they're idiots."
kings,3dsf3u,CalyxOfHell,3,Mon Jul 20 06:49:16 2015 UTC,I think the idea is that Big Cuz would still play the same game on offense but he wouldn't have to pound down low so much on defense which would just save his body for whatever post work he will do on offense
kings,3dsf3u,DrNevernude,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"He actually can play really well out of the high post, ala Divac.   Notice I didn't say Webber. Unlike CWebb, opposing teams do not want DMC to take 18-19 foot jumpers because he'll actually hit them pretty consistently."
kings,3dsf3u,TWK128,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"Cousins is better in the high post than the low post. He's a beast in the low post, but he's really, really good in the high post."

I always thought the only thing holding him back was his confidence level which doesn't seem to be a problem at this point.  Folks often got caught up in the fact that he was ""different"" and failed to see his tremendous skills or accused him of not loving the game because he had other passions.  Sacramento is the perfect place for him to continue to blossom.  He's a gentle creative soul but the kid can ball.  I'm looking forward to coming to Sacramento to see him play."
kings,3dsf3u,indykatie,19,Sun Jul 19 16:34:42 2015 UTC,The answer is a definite maybe
kings,3dsf3u,PostYourSinks,9,Sun Jul 19 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"You definitely can't rule him out now, but it's also not likely. I think he could have a shot at being ROY and at least being one of the better ones from this class"
kings,3dsf3u,4everpurple,4,Sun Jul 19 00:39:53 2015 UTC,Towns gonna be the best no doubt But shit willie can be the best defensive !
kings,3dsf3u,FatBitchExclusive,3,Sun Jul 19 00:58:41 2015 UTC,"Could? Maybe. Is it likely? No. Sorry, he's in the top 5. I think Towns will be #1. Mudiay #2. and then from there it can be a toss up."
kings,3dsf3u,cmeng,2,Sun Jul 19 02:17:22 2015 UTC,Still sad we passed up on Mudiay
kings,3dsf3u,BigGreekMike,7,Sun Jul 19 04:43:46 2015 UTC,I'm bummed Mudiay didn't show up to work out for Sac. Think Vlade made the right call.

kings,3dsf3u,cmeng,3,Sun Jul 19 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"How has Karl been with playing rookies in the past? I think he's good, just don't think he'll get to showcase as much as a KAT or Mudiay just because I think we will be good, with less garbage games."
kings,3dsf3u,CycleKing,3,Sun Jul 19 06:14:42 2015 UTC,He addressed that issue during SC and said despite not starting rookies being part of his MO he feels he's going to be more inclined to start WCS dye to his efforts he's bringing to the table thus far.
kings,3dsf3u,nations21,3,Sun Jul 19 07:02:59 2015 UTC,"He has a reputation of not playing rookies, but it's not like he's coached many top draft picks, being in the playoffs so often."
kings,3dsf3u,thepufferfish,3,Sun Jul 19 07:03:18 2015 UTC,There are some pretty dank scorers in this draft but we definitely scored the fastest big man I've ever seen lol
kings,3dsf3u,chubbupp,2,Sun Jul 19 06:19:33 2015 UTC,"Not the best, but he's up there in my opinion. We'll just have to wait and see how WCS turns out. He's already looking like he can make an impact his rookie year. Let's see if he can go beyond that."
kings,3dsf3u,Narwhail0r,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty good bet on being top 3 imo. I'm really excited about him. He's obviously going to be great defensively but his offensive upside is what I'm curious about, he'll be great for a high tempo offense."
kings,3dsf3u,thrillerv,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:37 2015 UTC,He is going to have to become much stronger to be on Dwight's and Deandre's level.  He is a pretty bad rebounder for his size and athleticism to be honest.  And Dwight has a much more developed post game
kings,3dsf3u,bruwinning,10,Sun Jul 19 00:40:02 2015 UTC,"Wait what? Dwight's post game is terrible. He's just strong. While that can sometimes work in the post, it won't get you that far in the NBA"
kings,3dsf3u,4everpurple,2,Sun Jul 19 00:41:39 2015 UTC,"That's true, so when you know that WCS has a worse post-game than Dwight, you know it's bad."

kings,3dsf3u,4everpurple,0,Sun Jul 19 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"He does have a chance of matching Dwight's rookie numbers. Dwight didn't average 20 pts per game until his 4th year. WCS has more low-post skill than Dwight does as a rookie and he might be a better learner, but we'll see about that.  Dwight will probably be the better rebounder (rebounding 10 in his rookie year), but if WCS flourishes next to Boogie with a focus on blocking, he has the chance to develop really well and go down as the better blocker. He's also pretty exceptional at avoiding fouls, and he has had an improving trend on his free throws."

Remember our big three missed a total of 71 games. Plus our bench was non-existent.   This year we tremendously improved the bench at every position, and with hopefully a healthy starting line up, Playoff berth isn't out of reach."
kings,3drqiw,kingsin4,6,Sat Jul 18 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"Nice write up, some of my exact thoughts on our situation. I like the ending: Failure is not an option. It's very true, it's an incredibly real possibility that we lose Cousins once his contract is up if we don't start winning, he won't wait around forever, Rudy is getting older and Rondo isn't exactly a young gun either. We have them in their prime or late prime, but we have to find a way to harness their talents and make some noise."
kings,3drqiw,ItsNotSpaghetti,3,Sat Jul 18 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"Would love to see it like that.  I think we can do it.  This team is going to have a pretty balanced attack.  I think it will be more offensively inclined, but WCS can really help there.  I see a lot of guys having career shooting years as well."
kings,3drqiw,IMDATBOY,2,Sun Jul 19 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"If you figure the top six seeds are these in some order:  -SA -GS -MEM -LA -HOU -OKC  which is completely reasonable to do.. that means competing for the 7/8 seeds with a free-agency stripped Portland, Utah, Denver, Minnesota, New Orleans, Dallas, Phoenix and Lakers. NO, Dallas and maybe Phoenix are really the only scary teams out of the bunch. We will still have to see how things mesh, but on paper right now, I truly like our chances of getting a 7 or 8 seed in that mix."

kings,3drqiw,4everpurple,3,Sun Jul 19 05:44:21 2015 UTC,"Dallas also completely lacks depth.  They've got a proven coach but he's going to have to really overachieve with Dirk/Matthews/Parsons/Williams as their stars, two of which are in the declining stages of their career, a third coming off a major injury, and the other seems like a complete overpay.

kings,3dnp88,deademery,19,Fri Jul 17 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think articles like this value proven ability over gambles like us. I'd bet if you included some kind of measure of variance (like ceiling/floor) we'd have one of the largest of any team. There's definitely an argument for most western conference teams ranked above us for why they're a safer bet. If the chemistry looks good in preseason we'll easily jump a bunch of these teams.    The Suns have moved laterally imo, better starting five and worse depth so I see no reason for them to improve, but they've proven themselves as a fringe playoff team so they get preference.  In the absence of an AD injury the Pels are almost certainly in the hunt for the 7-8 seeds. Probably the safest bet of any to make the playoffs.  Mavs have a top coach and Dirk so despite them being a shell of their former self it's a safe bet they'll overachieve. I have to assume Portland ranking is more about what they did last year which I think is creating an upward bias,  ""they have a winning culture"", etc. The Nuggets... that's just disrespectful. Especially now that it's almost certain that Lawson won't be an appealing trade chip and he may get suspended for part of the season. They're the same team they were last year (which basically had the same record as us) and we've gotten better."
kings,3dnp88,jkopecky,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:08:32 2015 UTC,The Nuggets were only bad last year because of their coach. Before that we were one of the best teams in the league with basically the same roster.
kings,3dnp88,eg14000,5,Fri Jul 17 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"If we're going back to the year that the Nuggets had one of the best records in the league (which was two years ago) then I wonder who that magic head coach who can make a dysfunctional team win is?!?  Also if we're comparing those rosters you're missing two starters in Igudala and Koufos, and two high impact bench players in Miller and Brewer. Couple that with the fact that as far as I can tell management has been unsuccessfully shopping Lawson who's stock has just fallen further and I have to admit that things look pretty bleak.   That said anyone who watched the first quarter of the kings season will tell you that Malone is the real deal, and I'm extremely high on Mudiay so I wouldn't be surprised if the Nuggets turn out to be way better than expected... but I'd definitely say their floor is as low or lower than the Kings without nearly as high an upside."
kings,3dnp88,jkopecky,5,Sat Jul 18 00:59:34 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets were never really  dysfunctional with Karl, he didn't have to fix anything. but everything else you said were good points, it's hard to admit defeat on reddit but you win this argument."
kings,3dnp88,eg14000,2,Sat Jul 18 02:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah fair enough, I definitely don't know much about that teams chemistry so dysfunctional was not a good choice of words, just thought it was funny to appeal to coaching as the difference maker when we have your old coach! I think that people (especially in this sub due to all the drama) are forgetting that Karl is a really good coach who can really improve a teams outcome.   I also don't mean to discredit the Nuggets entirely. I think Faried will be excellent, especially if Karl gets him playing more of a two way game. He's a guy who I think is a good coach away from breaking into the upper tier of power forwards, watching him play for team USA last summer made me believe he's got that talent. Nurkic definitely has a lot of potential as well.  If Mudiay can run the offense and take on a starter role quickly and have Lawson play more of an IT spark plug off the bench role they could certainly be an interesting team this year. Maybe one of those ""would probably make the playoffs if they were in the east"" teams."
kings,3dnp88,jkopecky,2,Sat Jul 18 03:00:55 2015 UTC,We have a more complete roster than they do.  Nurkic disappeared in the latter half of the season and we've actually got some defensive bigs to help Boogie so it wouldn't be a stretch to say we outperform them.

Which makes zero fucking sense, because our offseason moves for sure made us better. He is just really doubting Rondo and his ability to fit in here with the instability. I guess it's not his job to follow every detail about every team like we do, he just covers every team lightly, but I don't think he knows how stoked Rondo is to be here and prove everyone wrong.

Boogie missed 10 games last season with a freak illness which if avoided could have added ~5 to the win collumn, bumping us three spots to 22nd. Becoming a .500 team will remain to be seen with potential spacing issues but that leaves us in the 16-18 range. A fringefringe playoff team. But let's hope I'm wrong and we go deeeep! #sacproud"

kings,3dnp88,guy15s,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:07 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember about the media is that the vast majority of its members follow trends.  Less than a month ago, everyone was writing about the terrible, horrible, no good Kings' rumored trades, team riffs, and more.  Very few of them actually offered any true insight.  It was a topic that was easy, pretty much guaranteed a solid amount of page views as trash talk tends to do, and wouldn't rankle many feathers (There are dozens of us!) outside of Sacramento.  So, the narrative has been that the team is a joke.  In fact, that has been the narrative for about a decade now (time flies, huh?).  To that end, the team simply must accumulate wins.  The team solidified its roster, but didn't aquire any highly sought free agents.  No splashes, just a lot of ""Hey, that's actually not so bad.""  Most significantly, the starting lineup doesn't project to be that different from last year's, with only a ""Is he or isn't he done?"" addition.    On the flip-side, there were several rumors about players spurning bigger contracts to go several other places.  At least one of those reported offers has been disputed, and I suspect another one or two more could have been the work of agents taking advantage of a situation/perception.    Someone who doesn't actually follow the team, and I truly doubt that most writers pay close attention to this team, looks and says, ""meh.""  In their eyes, it wasn't the disaster that they'd hoped for, but it didn't have anything eye popping enough to make many take a gamble with their projections.  They don't remember how the starters looked before Cousins' illness, and that veteran depth was needed as much, if not more than, anything else.  That was all to say that the media will expect little of the team until they sign LeBron or actually get wins.  I have different, though biased, expectations this year, but I can't blame them too much for taking the safe bet and doubting.  They'll learn."
kings,3dnp88,1000facedhero,2,Fri Jul 17 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. We're still ready to accept that this is a gamble and that the season needs to happen for us to know, while the media continues to make affirmative statements before the season starts. The media just isn't prepared to acknowledge a turn around until we show it in the win column. If they're right, they're right. If they're not, everybody forgets and we become an underdog darling. Reasonable predictions always involves taking risks and acknowledging variability over absolutes."
kings,3dnp88,bogus_Wizardry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:42:34 2015 UTC,"25th is a bit too low I'd say about 20 is about right.  The 5 big additions are in no particular order, WCS, Rondo, Koufos, Karl and Bellinelli.    As much as I think WCS will be great in the future he is a rookie and rookies are almost universally bad in their rookie years.  I think he ends up being a net negative over JT in his first year especially with his offense being so raw.    Koufos is a solid backup center, I think his defense will be an asset, for about 20 min a night.  Offensively he doesn't bring a ton but I think he is a huge improvement and should net us a few more wins especially keeping the kings competitive on nights where DMC doesn't play.  I will admit I am much lower on Rondo than other people here but I do not expect him to return to form.  My case is this, Rondo's Win shares from 08-09 to last season, 9.9, 9.6, 6.6, 4.9, 3.2, 1.0, 1.6  His Box Plus Minus over the same time: 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 1.3, 1.8, 0.0, -0.5 and his TS%: .543, .540, .495, .483, .516, .461, .448.  I don't see a guy primed to rebound to previous form with a change in scenery.  I see a guy who has been declining for years and probably isn't actually that good anymore.  He is an improvement at backup PG, but I think it would be a mistake to attach a lot of hopes for a win jump to him.  Belinelli is a good player, a savy veteran spot up shooter who while not athletically gifted enough to be a good individual defender is smart and plays good team D.  He will be an asset, but it remains to be seen weather the team can create good spot up looks for him as he will be certainly be seeing worse looks than with the Spurs.  Karl is a good coach but I would also say a question mark as so much of the teams success depends on keeping Cousins engaged on the defensive end.  I think Cousins can improve on both ends this year and I expect McLemore in particular to improve a lot.  That being said there are still a lot of question marks on the team.  If everything goes well I could see 40-43 wins if everything breaks perfectly, if the luck stays as bad as it was last year me may only improve by a game or two.  Something in the middle is more likely though and I see 35-38 wins.  That would put us at about 20th best in the league."

However, its his attitude that still gets to me.  Case in point.  Look at the end of the video.  Outstretched hands reaching to him, wanting high fives, people glad for him, fans wanting to adore.. yet he ignores them and doesn't engage.  This me-first attitude needs to stop if he is going to be successful.  It really affects his game, complaining about calls, thinking everything he ever does is correct.  I really hope that things will turn around this year.  I play with a player like him.  Gifted with the body and skills, yet doesn't trust his teammates and wants the entire game and structure to be built around him.  This is why him and Coach Karl don't get along.  DMC feels that he should be calling the shots and yet a successfull basketball teams needs to be run by someone who can manage these egos.  The player needs to be put in their place to see the team as a whole.  It seems as though Vivek wants to pander to DMC's needs and Coach Karl wants to put the TEAM ahead of DMC.  Just a rant.  I will be watching the games nonetheless. Kings fan for life."

But are you serious about your example? What about the part where he jumps up and has his teammates all around him and embracing him? Or that part where he high-fives the coach after making a play? Or all the times throughout the year where he was smiling like a jackal when, say, Stauskas started finally sinking shots or when Omri was on fire?   You're talking about him walking down the hole to go to the locker room after the game and you're disappointed that he isn't shaking hands and giving high fives in one shot? That's going down to the locker room, man. Hell, I know more players that won't give high fives to random fans than will. That shit is how you catch the Con Flu, for one, and for another, dude is tired and just wants to get out to the locker room. It's an incredibly minor thing to point out that he's not high-fiving people in the stands, and there are even multiple stories of him acting cool with the fans and clowning on fans from opposing teams. Dude has the heart and soul of a King, and he's shown as such, in respect to the example you cited.   DMC feels that he should be calling the shots    Now this, I can see. Although, I don't think it's about him calling the shots, so much as him being the star of the team and making sure he stays that way and continues to be utilized by the coach. But it is fair enough that he looks out for that because not only does he have the right to look out for his career and make sure the team is using him to the best of his ability, but because the team deserves to get more usage out of him than, say, Nene or Wilson Chandler were with Karl's past teams. Karl is going to have to focus on Cousins, when he is more used to focusing on guard play and the frontcourt complimenting that guard play, and that is a fair concern to have. Cousins is the best player we have on the team, so Karl needs to figure out how to make a team lead by Cousins, otherwise what is the point of having him here?"
kings,3dmdfv,Aedonr,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:49:41 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. I hope I'm wrong but I don't think this team ever contends building around Cuz
kings,3dn49p,FWG_Wani,28,Fri Jul 17 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"""All that stuff is so out there,"" said Karl, who nonetheless admitted that hypothetical conversations about trading Cousins occurred ""behind closed doors.""

Does this make us better? Does this get us in a better place? That's our job.  ""There was never a discussion in that area even close to happening, in my opinion,"" he said. ""...

kings,3dn49p,Ethanhekker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"And they need to consider all scenarios and possibilities. If Cousins, or anyone else for that matter, suddenly decides that he doesn't want to be a King any more I don't want the FO to get caught with their pants down because they never considered it likely that he would jump ship. And I don't want them to avoid discussing it because it might hurt some feelings.  This fits in line with what I thought happened. Karl and his staff were running different situations and Fagen twisted it into something that it never was and fed it to Woj who wrote about it because Woj is a rancid trough of donkey piss. Same as all the other bullshit Woj wrote about us. His attempt to damage the rep of the King's organization has actually backfired and hurt his credibility."

Quincy Acy might be just the sort of guy we're looking for. For Karl, it's much more important that our forwards be athletic and can operate down low, not that they have range.

kings,3dn6vg,CeJeH,5,Sat Jul 18 08:20:24 2015 UTC,"The Kings should invite Duje Dukan, David Wear, Deandre Liggins, David Stockton, and Julyan Stone to training camp.  David Wear is the most NBA-ready of the 5. He actually played a couple games for the Kings last season. He's a good 3p shooter normally even tho he shot terribly in Summer League and at 6'10 he is big enough to grab rebounds. He's not very quick, and not a great defender, but he can fill the kind of role that Matt Bonner would have played here. He would also probably take a bare minimum contract. We should at the very least have him in Reno next season.  Same goes for Duje Dukan. He played behind Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker, along with Nigel Hayes at Wisconsin. So a lottery pick/national POY, a 1st rd pick and a likely future 1st rd pick. He played for a great coach in Bo Ryan. He's pretty athletic for a 6'10 guy. Can play 3 or 4. He can put the ball on the floor a bit. He's a decent passer. And he's a lights-out 3p shooter, shooting 41.7% in Summer League. Has a nice high, quick release. He kind of reminds me of Peja a bit. He's even Croatian! I wouldn't be surprised if Vlade brings him along. At the very least, like Wear, Dukan should play in Reno. Plus when he makes 3's we can say HAAA DUKAN! Awesome.  Liggins is a bit older and more of a journeyman. He's had some NBA stops but never stuck. He's a pretty versatile player at 6'6. He can shoot a bit. He can handle the ball a bit. He's a decent passer. He's also a pretty good defender. He should at least get a training camp invite and could be our 3rd SG/SF.  I don't think David Stockton is an NBA player. Stockton is better at running an offense and is probably a better shooter, but he's tiny and isn't great at anything. He's also pretty bad at anything outside of passing or shooting open 3s. Has some decent hesitation moves but not a great first step.   Julyan Stone showed some flashes of good things, but also showed a lot of bad things. He's a decent ball handler. He showed a knack for finding the open man. He's also pretty big and active away from the ball. He didn't score much but racked up quite a few rebounds, assists, and blocks in Summer League. He also had a lot of turnovers (including some very dumb ones), didn't play great defense at all, and showed that he's not a reliable shooter. He has potential, especially with his size, but he's not an NBA player. Might not ever be. I'd give him a shot in Reno, though.  I would prefer to take Andre Miller over Stockton or Stone as our 3rd PG. Wouldn't mind stashing them in Reno however.  In order of likelihood to make the team this year I would say it's: Dukan/Wear/Liggins/Stockton/Stone. With all of them being borderline.  I'll be upset if Dukan and Wear don't at least get a camp invite. They both have a lot of potential."

His good 3p shooting was an outlier if you look at the last 4 years of his career. Bargs wasn't going to get us over-the-hump.  I would much rather take, say, Duje Dukan on a non-guaranteed rookie contract over Bargnani on even the veteran's minimum. At least we can grow and develop Dukan, and he's already a better 3p shooter. Bargnani is just plain broken.  The Mbah a Moute thing was quite unfortunate, although it's still possible for him to play with us next season. That's not Bargs' fault, though. We needed The Prince even if Balogna signed with us."

kings,3djuec,Poptart2776,6,Thu Jul 16 21:50:01 2015 UTC,"Generally, yeah, unless they're getting signed to a <100% rookie scale contract, in which case the contract amount is less than the cap hold, making it advantageous to sign the rook before other FAs. However, this almost never happens.   Edit: From CBAFAQ.com  A team may sign a player (rookie) for as little as 80% or as much as 120% of the scale salary figure. Teams usually spring for the full 120%, but there have been exceptions. Teams over the salary cap use the Rookie exception to sign their first round picks.  Before signing the rookie, the cap hold is 100% of the scale. Since most rookies get 120% of the scale, it makes sense to wait."

kings,3dki8f,emkaysee,27,Fri Jul 17 00:26:59 2015 UTC,"First off...  10 million for a veteran 4x all star and championship with the cap raising? Not a bad deal.  Some people wanted Lee..  And Matthews.   Rondo has an ego.  It sucks but it's true.  He looks semi humbled with what happened.  If you listen to Rondo talk about his contract,  it was the Kings decision for 1 year.  He was asked to prove himself.  He has a chip on his shoulders.  His risk is no different than Rudy's risk. I can gamble that.   Acl tears suck. Will Rondo be rondo again...  Idk.  He is one of the best passers in the league.  He hasn't been paired with great teams. Mavs were a horrible match up and Celtics damn near had no one. He has multiple shooters now, dominant front court,  killer backup pg and a great coach.   Remember how sacramento is.  We are a small market team so we are forced with rookie talent who just wanna play for a team and fading veteran talent who...  Just wanna play on a team.  Remember CWebb talked shit about sac when he was coming here. He still says the greatest experience of his career. Rudy same. Ron Artest even praised sac.  We land spurned vets who have been trashed and we build them up when vulnerable and they stay for the long hall.  We kill them with kindness while others buy their teams.   Check my post history...  I was against it.  No one here has changed my opinion on him.  Only Rondo did. I believe we will see a great Rondo."
kings,3dki8f,yopeee,3,Fri Jul 17 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"Woo! I was in the same boat as you. Rondo wasn't my first choice, but now I've hopped on the Rondo train!"
kings,3dki8f,Narwhail0r,8,Fri Jul 17 05:41:08 2015 UTC,"This is his last chance to showcase his talent before grabbing that juicy contract for the TV deal.   Rondo can flat out lead a team, and take over even playoff games.   I'm sold on him, better than any of the work by the Maloofs"
kings,3dki8f,MedievalValor,7,Fri Jul 17 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping this works.  Also, Vlade Divac seems like a guy that people want to do things for.  And as others have said, Rondo has a lot of motivation to undo the negative perception of him that is out there."
kings,3dki8f,drewm916,7,Fri Jul 17 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"Here's the reasons I think you should feel better about him (my numbers aren't correlated with yours).   His play style was never very athletic. In Boston last year he was showing flashes of his past self but was obviously not putting forth effort all the time, on the Mavs he was just clearly frustrated.  If we can give him a situation to succeed he has every incentive on the one year deal to do so.  Boogie does well on iso plays, but putting him in those situations wears him down. We need to get him easier buckets if we want him to be able to play both ends of the court and have stuff left in the tank at the end of the season. Rondo is the perfect guy to do that.  We need someone to set up guys who can't(or aren't great) at creating for themselves.    WCS has the athleticism and awareness to be on the receiving end of lobs and inside passes that Rondo will be able to get him.  Marco has proven that he can be an elite 3pt shooter when people can find him some room.  McLemore has has the athleticism to make great cuts inside if we can find him and also will look better on the wing if we can break down the defense and kick it out.  Rondo isn't fast, but he's good at playing up tempo which we know is Karl's style. He's smart about when to push the ball down court before the offense sets and can create for others on the break.  Karl likes his players making decisions on the court. He's not a micro-manager like Carlisle, but more like Doc. Rondo's got some of the highest basketball IQ and court vision in the game.    At the end of the day the experiment may not work, but it's low risk. There was no one else we were going to get with that money that would have been as potentially high impact as Rondo and to get him on board I think it was important that we didn't throw offers at him that are disrespectful to the player he was. Even if it's an overpay I think it increases the likelihood that he buys in to what we're doing."
kings,3dki8f,jkopecky,7,Fri Jul 17 04:37:40 2015 UTC,"Bad contract   I don't see what's so bad about it. I think it's a fair price. Will it be a bargain if he can be the player we know he's capable of becoming again? Absolutely. And I think it's not a lofty goal to re-attain peak Celtics-Rondo. It's an effort thing with him. It always has been. He hasn't been on a team that was good enough for him to make a difference. Now he is. And I know he'll give great effort. Plus we all know he's extremely smart. He knows better than to diminish his value past what it was on the Mavs.    He hasn't been good since he tore his ACL   What's good here is that he doesn't rely on his athleticism. He's quick, but that's not what drives his game. His IQ does. And you're forgetting that he's been on trash teams and teams that don't fit with him.    I don't think he's going to get better   We don't need him to get better per se, but just tap into what we know he can do and what he has done. Basically just do what he's always been doing. And that's not out of question.    He's a bad fit.   How?? You're trying to tell me that the team that's bottom-5 in the league in assists per game totals won't fit with one of the best passing point guards and assist-getters in the league? How so?   And why does he have to score to be effective? You're talking about the guy that lead the league in assists per game (and total assists for that matter) multiple times---and you're complaining about the fact that he can't score!? He doesn't need to!  The 3 HOFer argument is irrelevant because he was a big part in making them what they are and emphasizing their skills. I'm in no way trying to say that they'd be bad without Rondo, as we can clearly see that that's false, just that he had a big role in making them so good.   And Boogie doesn't even iso that much on offense besides in the post, and even then, not that much. Yes, give him the ball in there, and more often than not, he'll finish. But Rondo will give him better looks both inside the paint and out. That means more open looks and more made shots for Boogie. You don't want that?    Collison is better   Slow down man. You lost me here. I love Collison as much as the next guy, actually more than the next guy, and he was fabulous for us last year, but this is plain false. Collison's game (ability to both score and pass)is better suited off the bench, even though he was great as a start for us.   And you're saying he's better than Rondo on offense and defense? Rondo has made all-defensive teams before, and whether he makes one again or not, you don't just suddenly lose defensive ability. And Rondo is capable of leading a top-5 offense. He's that good. I fully believe that."
kings,3dki8f,4everpurple,3,Fri Jul 17 01:46:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Rondo's decline has to do with the injury (his defense would have suffered a lot more if it was down to that)  The main reasons are probably that:   His FT percentage got abnormally bad (this must be a psycholgical thing) which makes him hesistant to drive Rondo isn't an all around player, he can only play good in the right system. In Dallas the system was making him near useless (which is part of the reason he got so frustrated). For his last months with the Celtics the team was either in tanking mode or they had spent almost a year playing a different way and Rondo coming back disorganized their offense which made it look worse than it really was.   I think the current roster and the way Karl wants to play is close to where Rondo is supposed to thrive, so with 10 mil for 1 year it's a low risk high reward move. And tbh I can't think of a better PG to make a player like WCS have more impact on offense."
kings,3dki8f,uututhrwa,3,Fri Jul 17 07:02:58 2015 UTC,This is a great contract.. We get an allstar point guard for a 1 year deal if he does great we can resign him.. If now he can bounce and we have money to spend.. I mean who are really going to spend that money on? Secondly he is choosing to come here and no matter what the media is saying other teams were interested in him for sure.. This is just his best chance of making noise.. He had a down year which didn't shock me as he was coming off an injury.. I think he has tons to prove and can really only help us.

He didn't produce. He could do all of the things we expect anyone his size to do. Rebound, defend, occasionally block shots, alter shots near the rim. He could do all of those, but because of his lack of scoring ability, to have value on an NBA team you need to excel at those things, otherwise you are replaceable.

I know that WCS's hat isn't all the way on, but by estimating where his head stops, you can see that he's definitely taller than Cuz. Trill is listed at 7'0"" and DMC at 6'11"". It's weird for sure.   And as a side note, Boogie treated everyone! He's obviously got the money to do so, but he seems to really like that we got WCS, and he's in a good mood and wanted to pay!"

kings,3ddgmt,2JMAN89,7,Wed Jul 15 12:17:38 2015 UTC,I think Rudy and Boogie will both see a good amount of PF minutes this season.
kings,3ddgmt,ser_friendly,7,Wed Jul 15 12:47:01 2015 UTC,you could even see mbah a moute at the 4.
kings,3ddgmt,The_Sacramento_Kings,4,Wed Jul 15 13:41:51 2015 UTC,"I think Vlade wants him in the Chris Webber role. I don't think he can bang down low like Chris but I'd give it a chance. We're clearly still going after another 4, Bonner and Hedo have been mentioned"
kings,3ddgmt,chubbupp,5,Wed Jul 15 14:55:33 2015 UTC,Why? George Karl would want him as a stretch 4 and that sounds perfect
kings,3ddgmt,Ethanhekker,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:21 2015 UTC,Offensively he would be awesome in that role but I worry about him on D. He's not the most physical guy so what happens when boogie is at center guarding someone like asik and Rudy's stuck on AD?
kings,3ddgmt,chubbupp,2,Wed Jul 15 19:12:10 2015 UTC,How funny - I was going to use Rudy Gay shutting down Davis as an example of why he's fine.
kings,3ddgmt,Ethanhekker,2,Wed Jul 15 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, he can cover AD for stretches, but any moment he gets lazy AD will make him pay. I worry that might offset any benefit he provides offensively as a stretch 4. But AD is a beast, it would be easier in most other matchups.  Rudy's been covering guys off the ball on the wing for us so far. He's done a pretty good job out there, but I haven't seen much that leads me to believe he would be willing to battle physical PFs down low for more than a few possessions here and there. Last year we had JT who took on that role. He fouled all the time, but it was clear he was putting in the effort - do you see Rudy being willing to do that? I think he maybe could, but it would require energy he likes to save for offense. What about more physical PFs like Randolph & Griffin?   My guess it is will be matchup based, cus I would rather have WCS or MaM dedicating their energy covering threatening 4's and save Rudy for cakewalks like Kevin Love"
kings,3ddgmt,chubbupp,4,Wed Jul 15 21:33:51 2015 UTC,I'd rather see Vlade nabb another reserve PG next.
kings,3ddgmt,oh_peaches,4,Wed Jul 15 15:02:21 2015 UTC,Bring back Andre for the vet min
kings,3ddgmt,4everpurple,2,Wed Jul 15 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Andre was great for the first several games for us, but it became clear pretty quickly (10 games or so) that his body just isn't ready to handle extended time. What if Collison or Rondo gets injured? You want Andre playing 18 minutes? I'd like to get him back but we need one more guy, too. David Stockton just ain't the guy for us. I'd rather get a guy with a higher ceiling."
kings,3ddgmt,oh_peaches,3,Wed Jul 15 21:56:30 2015 UTC,"Except, when he's in, he doesn't have to be the primary ball handler. Karl likes running dual-PG sets. It wouldn't be just him. And Stockton could be a very good player. He shows flashes of potential"
kings,3ddgmt,4everpurple,2,Wed Jul 15 22:09:38 2015 UTC,"I dunno...Stockton is already 24 and probably generously listed at 5'11""."
kings,3ddgmt,oh_peaches,3,Thu Jul 16 00:20:54 2015 UTC,"Okay? No one said he has to be ""the future"" for us, and no one said height is gonna stop anybody. We as Kings fans have seen it first hand. Last pick of the draft, 5'9"" Isaiah Thomas has transcended into a starter.   All I'm saying is that I think he can be good. Whether that's 3rd string pg, sixth man, or even eventually starter. Whatever his role is, I think he has it in him."
kings,3ddgmt,4everpurple,2,Thu Jul 16 00:37:59 2015 UTC,Watching summer league has changed my opinion of him. He doesn't seem to have 3 point range.
kings,3ddgmt,oh_peaches,2,Thu Jul 16 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"Dudes a pass first point guard. I know that he should be able to score as well, but I don't think it's as necessary when you have his awareness, vision, and passing ability. It's insane. Surely you've noticed that too in SL right? All of his traits I listed are unmatched by some starting NBA point guards. That's what I see.   And his form is at least solid. He can build off of that"
kings,3ddgmt,4everpurple,3,Thu Jul 16 01:21:27 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm beginning to worry about minutes here. Boogie and wcs I don't worry about because of foul trouble. But someone in our front court is not going to get enough minutes for their liking and not everyone can be as graceful as David Lee...
kings,3ddgmt,WisteriaHysteria,2,Wed Jul 15 15:21:16 2015 UTC,If I was running the show:  Cousins(24)/Koufos(24)  WCS(20)/Cousins(10)/Gay(18)  Gay(16)/Casspi(14)/Butler(10)/Belly(8)  McLemore(32)/Belly(12)/Collison(4)  Rondo(32)/Collison(16)  That would be a few weeks into the season as long as WCS proves himself.  Then my next adjustment would be deciding who wins the backup SF spot between Casspi and Butler.  With the loser getting cut from the regular rotation and spreading those minutes to the Winner/Belly/Collison/McLemore.
kings,3ddgmt,RU_Crazy,6,Wed Jul 15 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sitting here trying to deconstruct your lineup, but I'm having a hard time.  I will only say that I don't think Ben has earned that much playing time and should probably split a little more, and Collison should definitely get more PT, and IMO as the incumbent who did nothing to lose his starting job shouldn't get slotted to the bench for a meager 20 min/game.  I think Butler is a benchwarmer who you stick in sparingly, maybe 5-8 mins/game, or if you can get away with it on matchups to give other guys rests.  Casspi def earned more PT, and we'll probably see him run along side Rudy a decent amount.  I have a hard time playing Marco at the 3, depending on the matchup, when we've got such a deep front-court that all needs minutes."
kings,3ddgmt,WisteriaHysteria,4,Wed Jul 15 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"Agree on Collison but that will come once Butler or Casspi get cut from the rotation.  Ultimately I'd want him around 28-30 minutes a game.  But like I said that means we cut one of Casspi or Butler's minutes significantly.  Disagree on Ben because he's our only capable defender at the 2 spot.  Need him on the floor and I'm counting on him to make another jump as he did from year 1 to 2.  Assuming he doesn't make a progression then yea, his minutes would be cut down a bit.  Disagree on Casspi.  He definitely didn't earn more playing time.  Honestly if he didn't love being in Sac so much I would want him gone.  He sorely lacks in all basic fundamental skills.  Woefully subpar dribbler.  Tunnel vision with the ball.  Below average shooter.  What exactly does he do well from a skill perspective?  Disagree on Belinelli.  He's obviously not going to get matched up against starting SFs but against bench units he can easily play the 3 spot.  We're not really deep at the three spot.  Especially if we're going to be playing Gay at the 4 extended minutes."

kings,3ddgmt,goldenonecenter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:38 2015 UTC,Butler can't guard 2s anymore.. he'd be a sieve for any sg that gets mins in the league.
kings,3ddgmt,coachadam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:28:50 2015 UTC,I mostly like the minutes distribution.  I don't see cousins averaging 36 minutes because of foul trouble.  Collison needs more time.  Butler can't play the 2.  I don't see WCS guarding centers as a rookie or playing that many minutes - hell be in the high teens low 20s.
kings,3ddgmt,RU_Crazy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Collison will get more than 16 minutes per game. Maybe 20 mpg if they run him with Rondo a bit, but that's max. You're right about Butler at 2, so Collison may just absorb his minutes. Rondo will get real starters minutes.  Cousins played 34 mpg last year and he won't have as much foul trouble this year with WCS and Koufos sharing minutes at C. I think he will get all the minutes he can handle.  I agree with you that WCS will not start off with 34 mpg, but I think he will be at least around 30 by season's end."
kings,3ddgmt,goldenonecenter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"Karl has indicated his intention to run Collison and Rondo together.  Expect to see Collison play closer to 30 minutes.  Are you aware of WCS sickle cell condition?  He has trouble playing extended minutes.  Add to that the fact that Karl is notorious for not trusting rookies with heavy minutes.  Also, if you've been following summer league you'll see WCS tends to be really jumpy on defense (as with most young shot blockers) which leads to foul trouble.  That being said I hope to see WCS play 30 that would mean he is physically capable and making an impact on the floor without fouling."
kings,3ddgmt,RU_Crazy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"No way Collison sniffs 30 minutes. And I don't believe WCS will have trouble playing 30+mpg, but it's really up to Karl. I'd rather have him give WCS minutes and develop him quickly."

kings,3ddgmt,coachadam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:33:13 2015 UTC,I think you're right in being closer to Collison's minutes and further on WCS mins. I think WCS will end up around 26 mpg
kings,3ddgmt,coachadam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:31:58 2015 UTC,"WCS is a center and he'll guard the most dangerous post, which will usually be a stretch type post in today's nba."
kings,3ddgmt,coachadam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:30:17 2015 UTC,No way.  If WCS and Cousins share the floor WCS will be on the perimeter guarding the 4 or the pick and roll.  WCS isn't strong enough to guard 5s and Cousins isn't well suited for guarding pick and rolls or on the perimeter.
kings,3ddgmt,RU_Crazy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:57 2015 UTC,Boogie did very well defending in the PnR last season. It was the weakside rotation that started failing when Malone got fired..

kings,3ddgmt,coachadam,2,Thu Jul 16 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"I could see Rudy playing some minutes at the 4 at times but I think he'll mainly be at the 3 with Cousins at the 4. I think Moute will get some good time at the 4 in reserve minutes, can also see WCS playing 4 at times when not at the 5 but after watching some SL games I have to say I'm liking Moreland I know it's still early but hopefully he can keep improving and be a solid 4 off the bench for us."

kings,3darat,vifra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:31:19 2015 UTC,Pretty much. Hopefully he doesn't take the same route as Landry.
kings,3darat,bababerands,6,Tue Jul 14 21:33:25 2015 UTC,They're coming in with different circumstances so I don't think he will. Landry came in with a big contract and was supposed to be the new regime's first big signing and set us off in a new direction. LRMAM is hopefully coming in for the minimum and is just here to add depth and be a stopper off the bench.
kings,3darat,vifra,6,Tue Jul 14 21:41:39 2015 UTC,Nice move the Kings seriously needed some depth at forward especially since Mbah a Moute can play PF.  I wouldn't be surprised if Gay plays a lot of PF this year as well as the position is a little iffy since WCS is a rook.
kings,3darat,1000facedhero,4,Tue Jul 14 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Most people are penciling in Cuz at PF and Koufos at C, at least until WCS gets a few miles on him."
kings,3darat,NightWriter500,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Cousins would be a particularly effective PF.  Offensively obviously his game wouldn't change much but having two guys down low could crowd the paint a little, but this isn't that big of a problem, it was similar last year.  Cousins played good defense last year as a C and I'm not sure if his skillset translates well to the PF position defensively.  I'd rather have WCS and his elite closing speed on guys like Dirk and Aldridge while Cousins bangs in the paint than the other way around."
kings,3darat,1000facedhero,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"I've given some thought to this and I'm still not sure what we're going to see. It seems like Koufos and Boogie are bound to share at least 15 mins of court time nightly yet neither one seems for to guard the PFs who are comfortable playing on the perimeter. Nobody wants to see Koufos or Boogie chasing AD around all game.  To counteract this problem, if I were Karl, I would run a ton of 3-2 zone defense. Play Boogie and Koufos on opposite blocks and dare the opposing offense try and beat you by the three ball (this pair won't give up much inside). This scheme could work against a lot of teams, particularly less experienced teams with lesser deep shooting, but I have a feeling the Spurs and Dubs would make quick work."
kings,3darat,oh_peaches,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:12:56 2015 UTC,I thing 10-15 mpg overlap might be a bit much.  Cousins averaged 34 mpg last year which leaves 14+ mpg for Koufos if he just backs up Cousins.  Add in the inevitable rest/minor injury days for Cousins and you would need less than 5 min per night to end up with Koufos's career high in mpg of ~20.  I think you can manage those smaller stretches based on the opponent lineups so you don't end up with Cousins on AD Dirk or LMA on the perimeter.
kings,3darat,1000facedhero,2,Wed Jul 15 14:56:32 2015 UTC,I have to think Koufos was brought in and handed that contract to play more than 20 mins a night!
kings,3darat,oh_peaches,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"Looking at the salary rankings for next year for centers he isn't being paid that much (25th most).  Take into account the guys who are way underpaid due to when they signed their contract or the Rookie deals, and he looks like a reasonable deal with the cap rising for a 20 mpg center."
kings,3darat,1000facedhero,2,Wed Jul 15 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"He will be the 4th highest player on our squad, though. Besides the money, Koufos is a good player and Karl is going to be pressed to fit his best players on the floor. I'll be sorely disappointed (and surprised) if we don't see Koufos play at least 25 mpg, hopefully 30."
kings,3darat,oh_peaches,2,Wed Jul 15 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"Competent centers tend to get paid more than other positions.  I see the 4-5 min rotation (96 min) being something like 35 for Cousins, 20 each for WCS and Koufos, 15 or so of Gay playing small ball and 5-6 for Mbah a Moute.  Of course injuries will change that rotation as would other signings and I would guess WCS plays more later in the season than in the beginning.  Koufos is pretty good but I don't think he is one of the top 4 players on the squad.  Collison Cousins Gay and Mclemore are the top 4 in my opinion."
kings,3darat,1000facedhero,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"I think youre right that WCS will work into the rotation more as the season progresses, which should change Kosta's minutes. As of now, I think Koufos is exactly our fourth best player IF Rondo plays well. 3rd if not. It's really hard to compare PG talent to C talent, though, I suppose. This is probably the first time I've had to think twice about who our top players are...I mean...Karl actually has options. It's pretty remarkable how deep this bemch has gotten. In Vlade we trust."

kings,3darat,oh_peaches,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else think this move might affect Moreland's status with us? Luc primarily played PF for the Sixers last year, so let's roll with that since I think that's the better fit for him given his knee issues.   We now have: Boogie, Koufos, WCS, Gay, Mbah a Moute, and Casspi to expect frontcourt minutes. Based on what I remember from Karl's lineups last year and what he's said in the offseason re: Gay's role, we can expect to see him and Omri at 4 fairly frequently...not to mention Koufos and Boogie are going to share the court a lot. It looks like Moreland will be buried behind veteran depth and we may see him stick with the Bighorns this season."
kings,3darat,GentleGenitalia,6,Tue Jul 14 21:52:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like Moreland was bound to ride the bench outside of garbage time, anyway.  WCS basically does everything that Moreland does but much better.  Moreland doesn't really add a unique skill that's missing from our current squad."
kings,3darat,oh_peaches,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:34:01 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with Moreland going to the D League. I don't see any issue with roster redundancy, though. It's not a bad thing to have two young developing bigs who protect the rim. At this stage in his career, it's all about putting him in the right place to continue learning the game at the quickest rate."
kings,3darat,_DrPepper_,2,Tue Jul 14 23:49:46 2015 UTC,Moreland needs to be slowly introduced into the NBA. I think for now 3rd string isn't bad for him. But I believe he can be 2nd string by next season because of his defensive potential

kings,3dbehe,goldenonecenter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:39:58 2015 UTC,35 wins is a flop. We managed 29 last year with Collison playing 45 games and Cousins playing 59. We would've managed 35 wins last year with a healthy squad. Anything under 40 this year is a bust.

kings,3dbehe,cmeng,0,Wed Jul 15 15:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of giving up Nik AND a 1st. Nor was I a fan of the Ray McCallum trade.   Anyway, here's the deal with the 1st round pick and the 6ers.    The Kings owe their 2016 first-rounder to the Chicago Bulls. That pick is top-10 protected next year, and if it doesn’t convey then it will be top-10 protected in 2017 as well. Should the pick still not convey by then, it will become a second-round pick. The Sixers will receive Sacramento’s first-round pick either two years after the Kings’ first-round debt to the Bulls is paid or in 2018 if the pick owed to Chicago becomes two seconds.  The pick owed to Philadelphia is reportedly protected for picks 1-10 for one year before becoming unprotected. Trading picks with the potential to become unprotected is fairly uncommon in today’s NBA, so the fact that the Sixers hold not only this pick from Sacramento but also the Lakers’ lightly-protected first-rounder (top-3 in 2016 and 2017 and unprotected in 2018) is noteworthy.  The picks swaps are a bit more complicated, as they depend partially upon the Kings’ debt to Chicago. The Sixers have the right to swap first-rounders with Sacramento in both 2016 and 2017, but their ability to do so may go away in one of those seasons if the Kings select outside the top-10 and thus convey their pick to the Bulls. It should be noted that the right to swap comes after the Draft Lottery is conducted, meaning that if the Kings were to finish with a better record (and therefore a less favorable pick) than the Sixers, they could still jump ahead of Philadelphia via the lottery. In that case, Philadelphia would choose to swap picks with Sacramento.  What this means is that if the Kings miss the playoffs in either of the next two seasons, Philadelphia will essentially receive Sacramento’s ping pong balls going into the lottery. There is no protection on the swap, making it incredibly valuable depending upon Sacramento’s record in 2016 and 2017.   http://www.nba.com/sixers/news/150710-kings-trade-story  In light of those trades, we need to be a 50 win team, which I'm not quite sure we are."

kings,3dchle,tman916x,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:19:39 2015 UTC,He's actually a pretty quiet guy. Think Kawhi Leonard. Very much to himself. Super Texan. I know he resigned with the Spurs but just don't think he would fit in Karl's system. He's too slow. Spurs usually have to compensate and switch their style of play when he comes on. Usually with Diaw too.  Just not the same player he was 2 years ago. Had that infamous drop-off unfortunately. Don't think he will see too many mins with Spurs

kings,3d9437,BigGreekMike,5,Tue Jul 14 14:55:30 2015 UTC,Agree that winning fixes all. Where do you think Butler fits into the rotation?
kings,3d9437,kvnbrch,2,Tue Jul 14 15:31:28 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I think he's basically somebody who we'll see when one of our SF's or SG's are having a bad night. If Ben Mac is having a bad night, he'll come in at about >50% of the time that Bellinelli comes in, and if Bellinelli is doing bad, he'll take up most of his minutes.  I also think it's fair enough to say that Bellinelli, Butler, and Moute will battle for that second string position all year. I don't see Moute making his way in, but Butler had enough defensive prowess that I can see him shaking things up, depending on how Bellinelli performs and if Butler can defy his age."
kings,3d9437,guy15s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:07:37 2015 UTC,Lockerroom and keeping the bench consistant.
kings,3d9437,Zezzaz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:43 2015 UTC,Just a great vet/playoff experience guy. A guy you can put in when everyone is slacking or playing with a lack of confidence. He's s great spot up shooter and knocks it down consistently from 3. Will be a good locker room presence as well as a good mentor for Ben Mac and WCS. He's been known to keep a positive atmosphere amongst the players. Good player motivator. Think he will bring great guidance to Cuz and Rondo. Just a really good pickup. Worst case scenario is his physical game drops a few notches but everything else remains. Really excited that we picked him up. I thought he did really well for OKC the other year and knocked down some important 3's in the playoffs which is what he's known for. I'd be really surprised if we didn't make the playoffs this season.
kings,3d9437,iplay4keepz07,2,Wed Jul 15 22:44:25 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, as much as I like him, I don't think Moreland will make this roster."
kings,3d9437,4everpurple,0,Wed Jul 15 01:12:32 2015 UTC,I think our organization has bee. Impressed with him from summer league. He definitely won't play big minutes and he will be at the end of the bench getting a minute or two per game. I could see him as second string by next season. I think any players that's skilled on defense has a place in this league because there are way too many offensively orientated players.
kings,3d9437,college_pastime,3,Wed Jul 15 22:54:33 2015 UTC,I like the lineups you thought of and all of the points you made about them. I feel like those are the best possible lineups to achieve our goal of making the playoffs. And I think it's a perfectly attainable goal

kings,3dab37,IncubusSc2,16,Tue Jul 14 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"To call DeMarcus ""not very athletic"" is just false. The dude can run, and he runs hard even when he's tired. I think his ability to fill the lanes and even run the break as well as clear defensive rebs to outlet are great assets to a higher paced team."
kings,3dab37,IMDATBOY,7,Tue Jul 14 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"He also played in a very athletic system in college and excelled. There's no real reason to think he can't perform in a fast-paced system. He just can't be the only option on the floor in a system like that. Really, nobody but Lebron James can do that, and even then."
kings,3dab37,guy15s,4,Tue Jul 14 19:18:05 2015 UTC,He played dribble drive motion with John Wall and Eric Bledsoe dishing to him and Pat Patterson filling the shooting big role. The more active a post is in that type of system the better results he'll get. Primarily he will get drop offs from the dribble drive or get quick hits to the low post.
kings,3dab37,coachadam,6,Tue Jul 14 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between explosiveness and athleticism. Demarcus is a very good athlete for his size. Elite hand and foot speed and we'll as hand eye coordination. People see Blake Griffin and think ""oh well Boogie can't jump like him, he's not athletic."" Boogie is very athletic, he just doesn't have the vertical explosiveness. He can absolutely play this system."
kings,3dab37,coachadam,4,Tue Jul 14 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And with the addition of WCS, our front court got a hell of a lot faster. This team is built for Karl's scheme"
kings,3dab37,foxmtbr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:17:40 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Maybe I exaggerated. It's just that when I think of D.C. as a player athleticism isn't one of the things that comes to mind.
kings,3dab37,oh_peaches,4,Tue Jul 14 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"I think it can be hard to adjust our perceptions of players as they develop. Your statement was more accurate in describing rookie and sophomore Boogie, but he lost his baby fat and definitely hit the gym hard between seasons 2-3. He's really got more stamina and explosiveness than I thought he might ever have. A lot of those reckless charges and bone-headed reaching fouls have gone away thanks to his ability to much improved agility and conditioning. Boogie gon beast."
kings,3dab37,guy15s,5,Tue Jul 14 21:11:54 2015 UTC,"Cousins is a lot more athletic than people give him credit for. He did excellently under Callipari's system, which is highly athletic, and we really haven't seen him much in a fast-paced system, besides with Karl, and his endurance was really, really tested since he was basically our whole front court towards the end of the season.  Rondo is a question mark. He's still very good at running the fast break, though, and using pick and rolls to get into the paint, so there is a decent chance he'll do well in Karl's particular brand of a fast paced system. Especially considering how Karl's system specifically actually relies on having an aggressive defensive scheme, which favors Rondo's play style."
kings,3dab37,coachadam,4,Tue Jul 14 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"There will be no compromise. The system will be Karl's system, same as always. He'll implement some more low post looks for Boogie but that's it. We'll run, we'll create transition with our defense and play a secondary break offense that get Boogie or Rudy the ball in a post on to score.   Rondo brings the ability to get players easy buckets. Rudy and Boogie have had to create a lot but Rondo will create for them and then give them the ball to finish. I bet Rondo averages Celtics level assists and steals.  Every player on this roster is a Karl uptempo, trapping D type player, even Boogie and the vets like Butler..   This team will play fast and aggressive and Rondo will call the shots mostly.."
kings,3dab37,cmeng,2,Tue Jul 14 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"They should play a really slow, grind it out, half court based offense /s"
kings,3dab37,-Hoopin-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"Kings fans wont like this but I agree. Rondo, Gay, and Cousins are our three best players. I do think they can play up tempo and still play well, but we would get the absolute best out of the team if we slowed it down. Demarcus is athletic but he would benefit from a half court offense. He needs to touch the ball more than anyone on the team for us to be successful. That means him getting into position and running the half court sets. Rudy can probably run and gun as well, but even he plays better as a half court take you man one on one play style. If WCS plays up to his potential, he and Demarcus would be a defensive force down low. I think Mclemore will improve this season but he's more a catch and shoot type of player which would work in both run n gun or half court offense.  Since Karl likes to push the ball we will obviously be a more fast pace team, but the reality is any successful team with their best player being a post player, is a half court offense team. On the flip side the only successful run n gun teams I can think of had MVP PG's to push the ball (Cury, Nash suns). We will still make the playoffs this year but would probably have the higher ceiling with a Mike Malone, or Tom Thibs type of coach with our current roster."

I mean so bad that he was useless against the Clippers even with Big Baby guarding him. He missed wide open 3's. It was atrocious. Also, you can only pair him up with WCS otherwise he's a defensive liability.  I think there's better stretch 4's left in free agency. Barg would have been nice, too bad."

But I think Vlade is trying to fill out the rest of the roster with high character guys who can contribute just a little bit.   Caron Butler is an example, he's probably the 10th man in the rotation right now meaning he might not even play but if he does he can knock down a shot. And by all accounts he's a great locker room presence."

He was the best available point guard?  It was the same when we were getting Deron Williams. Shitty guard and a wash up has-been...  Mavs get him and he's a hero haha.  Laker are shitty.

So far Vlade looks like he has a better eye for talent. Obviously we won't if the signing a work until the season gets underway, but it's hard to not get excited with all the talent that has been brought in. It looks nice on paper, now we must wait to see if it pans out of the hardwood."

kings,3d4vum,Pixelcide413,10,Mon Jul 13 21:24:42 2015 UTC,Not only Vlade filled the bench with quality players but hes done it by signing them to reasonable contract values and lengths. By doing this he's also filled our bench with tradable assets of value that can be moved for a potential big name on a crappy team that wants out.  We haven't had this kind of talent/flexibility/value on our team in a VERY long time.

D Will signed for quite a bit of money. (2 years, $10M). I wouldn't want that. Getting rid of Landry was my dream too, lol. And Stauskas was just not good last year and although he'll be better in 15-16, will it be enough for a contender?    I don't think we would be watching Isaiah Thomas tearing it up in Boston had Vlade been involved a year earlier.   I don't care, I love Collison and he is a better fit to this team than Thomas. Thomas kind of acted butthurt after the S&T."
kings,3d4vum,N1celyDunn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see what you are saying, overall I mean that it is kind of funny how the team has been in Pete's hand for 2 years and now with Vlade under control, he has undone some of the things that weren't helping us that had Pete's stamp on it. Kind of a slap to Pete but having 3 different coaches certainly doesn't help either. IT was awesome to watch and I would like to think he would work in a fast paced Karl system.

I liked the fact that Vlade from the start had a vision and wanted to lead. Pete was more of a yes man. If Vlade was at the helm last year I guarantee we wouldn't have drafted Stauskas. Felt like Nik was Vivek's choice and Pete had no balls to tell Vivek that drafting two SG in a row is a terrible idea. It's ingenious to say that he was horrible for us though. He got us Gay,  Casspi and the extensions. However,  we needed a leader in the FO. Vlade fit that role and is already helping the disarray in the King's FO."

I agreed with a lot of what Pete said regarding the direction of the team, and you can split half and half the hits and misses he had acquisition wise. Collison, Gay and Casspi were great adds. Williams and Sessions were fine ideas initially, I don't blame him for trying on those guys. It's a little harsh to boil his whole tenure here down to his mistakes. Blades obviously bring more aggressive and handling situations better outwardly, let's see how it plays out."

It secures a team being here and with a possible hockey team coming..    It creates an environment that says ""We wanna win"".  Our skyline needs to develop and this may be a necessary piece to luring investors. Gridlock will suck but like anything...  We will make it work.

kings,3d5ffv,tman916x,8,Mon Jul 13 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"First time I've ever though he got one wrong. I spend massive time/money down by AT&T park that I wouldn't if that stadium had never been built and was so nice. Not just at the park, but in the bars/restaurants nearby. On the flipside, there's nothing near the Oakland Arena where I'm a season ticket holder, and they've been in need of an overhaul for a long time. If there was something to do out there they'd get my money, but instead I hop on Bart, go back to the city, and spend it there. Sac's new arena is blowing up the area around it for blocks, even miles. New storefronts, new apartments, the entire downtown area is getting a makeover. Shoot, two friends of mine actually moved back to Sac in all the excitement- it was a deciding factor in them picking up their families and buying houses in the area. Take away that arena, take away the Kings, and it's still just a skeleton of Downtown Plaza.  Small example though. I agree in general principle that cities shouldn't be using their tax revenue to buy billionaires profitable buildings."
kings,3d5ffv,NightWriter500,9,Mon Jul 13 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Building a billion dollar stadium is worthless if you don't have a team that plays well. I could make his argument by showing the Barclay center.  From what I heard, it didn't really change much.  Put a stadium in a small city with a winning crowd and people pay.   I love grabbing a drink and talking about the game...  But where do I go besides Petes after Arco? Mels?   This will be nothing but good for a city, who in all honesty, doesn't really have much other than the capital.   Billion dollar stadium with shitty team = Bad  Billion dollar arena with great team = great"
kings,3d5ffv,yopeee,9,Mon Jul 13 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"Small example though. I agree in general principle that cities shouldn't be using their tax revenue to buy billionaires profitable buildings.   This is key. Arenas are great at revitalizing communities when there is a business owner behind it who shows they are interested in the area. When cities bankroll arenas and the owners only contribute a fraction, it won't instill confidence for other businesses coming in. The big difference with our arena is that Vivek is contributing almost half of the cost for the arena, while most of the bombed arenas only end up with about 10-15% of the cost being covered by the owner."
kings,3d5ffv,guy15s,2,Mon Jul 13 18:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'd even say that there's a strong correlation, the more profitable the venture for the owners the more likely it is to succeed in bringing positive benefits. The problem with public funding for arenas is it skews the reality of when a new stadium is really a worthwhile idea and when it's not.   I'd be all for some degree of public support if there was some degree of profit sharing until it's paid off. Sort of a public loan that shields the owners from some of the risk while still letting the city get paid off over a long period of time."
kings,3d5ffv,jkopecky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:55:47 2015 UTC,I don't see how that's an argument when the city will own the arena. Why shouldn't we pay for some of it?
kings,3d5ffv,tman916x,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"We still do. I did say when owners only contribute a fraction. The city should still pay for a good amount of the arena, just not 75-95% of the cost."
kings,3d5ffv,guy15s,5,Mon Jul 13 22:04:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say he has good points but in the context of the Kings arena, this is worth it. The new arena is helping revitalize that area, like you said. It's about location for us. And downtown has been suffering so much that it needs the boost. I'm rooting for the Bucks, but one downside for them is that they are looking at the lot next to the current arena. Probably won't be much of a difference in attendance if they aren't winning. Lucky for them they're a good team."
kings,3d5ffv,IMDATBOY,3,Mon Jul 13 19:24:56 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% sure but I think AT&T was privately funded
kings,3d5ffv,TanTanMan,2,Mon Jul 13 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"Hey you're right, it was the first privately funded stadium since 1962. That's awesome. My larger point was about what it does for a neighborhood though. Like this: if the Giants were still at suck-ass Candlestick, I might go to maybe one game a year, and I damn sure wouldn't hang out in the neighborhood after. As is, nice new stadium and a sweet neighborhood that popped up around it, I've been to 8 games and I'm going to my 9th soon. I hang out before and after the game. Granted I'm going broke, but still, none of those businesses would be getting paid without a new stadium being there. None of those people would be employed (there at least).  Again, I agree that cities shouldn't be using public tax revenue to buy billionaires buildings. But those buildings can do amazing things for a community."
kings,3d5ffv,NightWriter500,3,Mon Jul 13 21:31:46 2015 UTC,Same here! My grandfather and I go to a bunch of giants games and get there hours early and spend money at various restaurants and other businesses. I also feel that the golden one can and will be just as awesome! The Kings should look at the Giants as a model on how to build a successful business/arena.
kings,3d5ffv,TanTanMan,5,Mon Jul 13 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"He makes some good points, but they're too general. It really ought to be judged on a case by case basis. Sacramento is a city that sorely needs that arena to preserve it's local economy. I would argue similarly about San Diego with the Chargers."
kings,3d5ffv,BigGreekMike,2,Mon Jul 13 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"Ideally, I'd either like the city to just pay for the entire thing, and then the team pays rent in a lease; or the team buys the stadium on its own, and keeps all the profits.  I hate when the city pays for a large chunk of the arena, but all the revenue flows into the owners' pockets.  This is a nationwide problem with all sports franchises. Since the teams are finite resources, the threat to move them allows the owners to extort concessions from cities that they would never be able to get otherwise.  I'm happy we got an arena. I am ecstatic the Kings are staying; but I think the current system is fucked. I'm not positive I have any brilliant plan to fix it."
kings,3d5ffv,hipnerd,2,Mon Jul 13 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"Lots of good points in general, and stuff that was used to argue against our arena.  I think though there's a few differences that makes our arena more palatable:  1) The primary funding mechanism for this arena wasn't crippling municipal bonds but rather what essentially amounted to the selling off of public lands and the privatization of public parking (I'm pretty liberal on the political spectrum, but I know lots of people get off on privatizing publicly run stuff like this and you could make a reasonable argument that a private corporation could run the whole thing more efficiently and modernize it in the way I've seen in cities like SF where it makes parking so much more hassle free)  2) Oliver's assertion that nobody goes to hang out around stadiums is correct... most of the time.  Like, look at Oakland - no new stadium, baseball, football, basketball, or otherwise, no matter how shiny and special, is going to get people to hang out in Oakland during or after games.  But just look across the bay and tons of people go to baseball games at AT&T park, then stick around in the city afterwards to wine, dine, and party.  Depending on the circumstances, a new stadium could provide the same boon to local economies, but location and circumstance are key.  IMO, I think the new downtown arena will be great, because people already like hanging out in midtown and the Sacramento nightlife is beginning to kick into gear, and this will only bring more of a draw."

kings,3d3uvk,IncaseAce,14,Mon Jul 13 08:39:45 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, as my bold prediction for this season I think the Kings will make the playoffs.  You've got a DOMINANT force in Boogie, a great athletic defender and mismatch nightmare in Trill to free him up even more.  Then youve got Rondo who can control the flow of the game, run their offense efficiently, play good D, and will likely have an easier time scoring himself with the fear of dishing it out to Cousins any time he drives to the basket (people forget how good he was before the whole Dallas debacle). Then youve got Gay and McLemore who can create their own shots and score efficiently.  And on top of all that, youve also got Collison, Bellineli, Kufos and now possibly Mbamute who can play incredibly well against other second units, and even fill in as starters if really needed. As long as George Karl doesnt try to trade everyone this team will be A LOT better than most people realize, I mean didnt the starting lineup have the 3rd best point differential or something like that last season? Now that starting unit is improved and the depth isnt otherworldy terrible.  As I sort of alluded to before, Cousins will dominate this year, hes been playing along side Jason Thompson, Carl Landry, and Reggie Evans and with Collison as his PG. Cauley-Stein and Rondo are gonna make his life so much easier.  This is coming from a neutral NBA fan btw"

Put up some nice numbers for our D-League team, but in that offense, everyone does. Not to discredit him though. I expect he'll either make the team, or barely miss the cut and play for the Bighorns.   However, I think he'll play for us at some point next season. He'd add good bench depth for us. His defense is great and he's looked good in SL so far. His offense looks improved but definitely not great. His jumper is kinda ugly, but post offense looks a bit better. He's still a bit too stiff on that side of the ball. Needs to become more fluid.  Good potential though. 6'10"" and athletic. Obviously a good shot blocker. If he can develop that offense better, I'd be excited to have him on the roster later down the road.   Some on this sub got beef with him though....lol"
kings,3d34z6,4everpurple,3,Mon Jul 13 03:48:15 2015 UTC,Lmao naw I'm over it But totally unbiased I don't think his offense is developed enough for how long he played in college  With WCS don't see why we need him  Shot blocking is decent tho Also he only 218 at 6'10

kings,3d1q8f,BigGreekMike,2,Sun Jul 12 20:36:26 2015 UTC,Why do you love this signing? Legitimately curious.
kings,3d1q8f,CeJeH,4,Sun Jul 12 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not him, but I love this signing if it's cheap enough to allow us to add someone like Andre Miller.  What makes me love the idea of adding Bargs cheap is because he's a legitimate stretch 4 that will be playing on a team where he is about the 7th or 8th best offensive option.  That's crazy for him, but a much better fit than anywhere he has been.  People like Bargs fail to meet expectations so badly that they get written off as belonging to the NBA at all, and that's just not true of Bargs.  He can still give you 25 on a given night, and his 7 foot frame is still something that opposing teams need to deal with when it's near the rim.  He's not a great defender, but that height is still something.  Basically, there's no downside to bringing him in I guess, especially if he's near the minimum.  And this might be the best fit he's had in his whole career."
kings,3d1q8f,IMDATBOY,3,Sun Jul 12 21:26:21 2015 UTC,To be fair when he got traded to the Knicks Many of us Knicks fans said the same thing. But with his time here he never really took off offensively like we were hoping and his shooting was kinda underwhelming. But he's actually better on defense than many give him credit for. A very competent low post defender when his head is in the game
kings,3d1q8f,B_eb21,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"See I guess you and I just have a difference in the way that we look at things. I kind of admire you in a way. You seem to be very optimistic about everything related to the Kings. Every time we sign a guy or make a trade, you look at the best-case scenario for that player. That shows hope and promise. I respect that.  Unfortunately, I've been a Kings fan long enough to know that the hopes and dreams of turning around every misfit NBA player into something great, or even good, is typically not a reality. Often times things don't work out best.  When you look at Bargnani you see a guy that scored 15ppg last year and shot 36% from 3p as a 7'1 PF. That sounds very promising, especially for this team the way our spacing works out.  But when I look at those numbers I see a different story.   For example, Bargs only played 29 games last year. In fact, he's only played more than half the games in a season 1 time in the last 4 years, that was the year before last when he played 42. He's averaged just under 37 games a year the last 4 years. That's a guy who is almost always hurt.  You mention that he's a legitimate stretch-4, and that he's a good 3p shooter. What I see is a guy that took a career-low 1.4 attempts at 3p per game last year to get that 36%. He made 15/41 3s last year. Not exactly a great sample size. The previous 3 years, however, he took over 100 3s per year, and shot 29.6%, 30.9%, and 27.8% respectively. That does not sound promising to me.   You mentioned his defense being ""not as bad as people think."" He finished 67/68 in Def Rating for Centers last year. Bargnani is probably the worst defensive Center in the NBA over the last 5 years. We're not bringing him in for his defense, but he still has to guard somebody while he's on the floor.  Even mid-range shooting, his bread-and-butter, is not that great. The majority of the shots he takes are outside of 10 feet and he's not particularly efficient there either.  Basically, we're getting this guy because of talent that he used to have, and hoping that he still has something left in the tank. Another example of Vivek's ""buy low"" philosophy. Well, there's a reason why you can buy low on guys like Bargnani: They just aren't that good.  I really hope he does well here. Maybe playing with Bellinelli will help him rekindle some of that magic he displayed earlier in his career. I just can't get that excited about signing guys like him. Certainly not enough to justify ""I LOVE THIS SIGNING!"" There's nothing to love here.  You know what we really need more than anything? Perimeter defense. We need wing defenders. We need a guy we can bring off the bench and shut down all those scoring monsters of the NBA that play the 3. We don't have that guy! WCS might be that guy? Maybe? But he's a Center. And a rookie. Rudy Gay isn't that guy. Ben isn't a shut-down defender. We need a lockdown guy. Not a washed up stretch-center with a big name who's biggest contribution defensively has been blooper reels.  You know what fuck it. I just saw that he signed with the Nets. THANK BABY JESUS. I'm posting this shit anyway."
kings,3d1q8f,CeJeH,2,Sun Jul 12 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"Damn man I'm legitimately sorry you wrote that whole thing now haha.  But I completely agree actually, it is just a difference in our philosophical approach to evaluating these moves.  I will almost always take the positive side of things to frame my opinion on our moves, but there are definitely always going to be negatives, and often I find myself taking a positive perspective on something that ends up working poorly or in a completely different way.    You bring up a lot of good points as well, but you'll rarely find me agreeing that they are significant enough to have a negative perspective on moves or whatnot.  Not because they are actually positive moves, but more because taking a positive perspective has made rooting for this team bearable in these dark years.  Eventually there will actually be positive moves, even some that initially look negative.  And until that happens, I'm gonna keep assuming the best, being briefly disappointed when they go wrong, and move on to the next thing.  Otherwise, I just can't root for this team haha, this shit is brutal."

kings,3d2uci,ericcc32,14,Mon Jul 13 02:06:41 2015 UTC,"SL isn't exactly known for team ball, I wouldn't look too hard into it. Actually, I think he looks great out there. His stats don't jump off the page, but his game looks good. He's protecting the rim like a rabid animal, even if he isn't getting a piece of the ball."
kings,3d2uci,Bear1727,11,Mon Jul 13 02:13:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely not his fault they're losing. He's doing unbelievably well on the defensive end. Him and Moreland are holding it down. These guards are beyond awful at closing out on 3s though. He's giving them all the opportunities in the world to get back to their man in time by cutting off penetration, but our defenders keep getting lost."
kings,3d2uci,IMDATBOY,5,Mon Jul 13 02:31:10 2015 UTC,The overall team isn't very good so don't expect too much from this team.. We just want to see what he does as a Player.. so far I am happy with what I see!
kings,3d2uci,N1celyDunn,2,Mon Jul 13 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"He doesn't even need to worry that much about rebounding when you have cuz, getting back on d and protecting that rim doe."
kings,3d2uci,StuperSconed,2,Mon Jul 13 04:23:18 2015 UTC,He's never been a good rebounder. I don't know why people keep thinking otherwise
kings,3d2uci,The-Hot-Tamale,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:42:35 2015 UTC,"If you think WCS is going to get a ton of rebounds with Moreland and the other athletes out there against this level of comp, you're missing 2 things. When you are the primary rim protector you're going to lose rebs, it happened to JT. At this level WCS is just working on protecting the rim and you've got guys driving into him and throwing up junk, you lose long rebs to wild shots like that to the wings, especially if they are crashing the boards.   The things he will do are protect the rim guard like crazy and run and dunk alot.. Boogie's reb totals will go up most likely.."
kings,3d2uci,coachadam,0,Tue Jul 14 17:52:56 2015 UTC,He's just adjusting to MUCH bigger bodies and MUCH better players than he went against in college.
kings,3d2uci,Arugon,3,Mon Jul 13 02:20:06 2015 UTC,"he never had to focus on rebounding he was a rim protector, when you play next to nerlens, poythress, dakari, towns, you dont need to grab rebounds. He'll work on it though hes got all the talent in the world and he's a hard worker"
kings,3d2uci,mmaaffee,-2,Mon Jul 13 02:35:26 2015 UTC,"From a nuggets fans perspective, I think Jokic and Lerverne simply shut him down.  Both players are fundamentally sound and boxed him out on ever play."
kings,3d2uci,eg14000,2,Mon Jul 13 04:24:39 2015 UTC,Even defensive rebounds? Jokic grabbing 10 offensive rebounds?
kings,3d1nbk,unclearColt,3,Sun Jul 12 20:04:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know but if there is room for one last contract, I want him on this team. Great insurance for point guard injuries"
kings,3d1nbk,IMDATBOY,2,Sun Jul 12 20:19:06 2015 UTC,"We have his Bird rights, so I don't think they'll sign him until they're done with cap space."
kings,3d1nbk,thepufferfish,2,Sun Jul 12 22:47:48 2015 UTC,"Nice, and very reassuring.  I'm decently comfortable with the roster as it is, but any improvements we can make with that remaining space are definitely welcome.  Bummer bout Bargs, as crappy as he's been his whole career, he was a good fit for that role.  Him and Andre would have really solidified the roster for me."
kings,3d1nbk,IMDATBOY,3,Sun Jul 12 22:53:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's very safe to assume that he'll sign for the vet min, but I'm not sure what the hold up is. Then again, we technically haven't signed anyone yet. All of the guys that verbally committed are expected to sign tomorrow"
kings,3d1nbk,4everpurple,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the Kings are saving their cap on other free agents, and then if any's left they'll sign Miller. If not, they'll go with Stockton."
kings,3d1nbk,BigGreekMike,3,Sun Jul 12 20:35:29 2015 UTC,"There's a Minimum Salary Exception that states that we can sign as many players as we want over the cap as long as it is at the minimum salary and only up to two years.  source  This isn't really to put doubt on what you're saying since signings like this still put us over the cap. Just thought you would be interested to know, if you didn't already. :)"
kings,3d1nbk,guy15s,-3,Sun Jul 12 21:06:43 2015 UTC,Andre Miller will probably sign with Houston.  They need a backup pg and Miller probably wants to play for a contender for his last year.
kings,3d1nbk,Rocketz1Bruh,2,Sun Jul 12 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"This is literally the first I've ever heard anyone mention a connection between Andre Miller and Houston. I think it's widely, massively assumed he's signing with Sac after they've finished signing everyone else. He basically said as much at the end of the season."
kings,3d1nbk,NightWriter500,-1,Mon Jul 13 02:40:21 2015 UTC,So he rather be the 3rd string vet mentor behind Rondo/Collinson with little playing time or be the backup pg for the Rockets and contend for a championship?
kings,3d1nbk,Rocketz1Bruh,2,Mon Jul 13 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"He'd rather play for a coach whose system he knows and fits him perfectly. When Karl signed with the Kings, Andre was flying over like the next day. He's also at the stage where he's transitioning over to coaching. This last year he'll mostly be a player coach and then move on to assistant after that."
kings,3d1nbk,NightWriter500,-1,Mon Jul 13 02:49:07 2015 UTC,"Only one problem with what you said...  He want be playing in Sacramento!  Rondo/Collison willl get all the minutes at pg, Dre needs to be on a contender to show his true value. Houston will contact him before it's all said and done.  Patrick Beverly is the only pg on Houston's roster right now. They are desperate."
kings,3d1nbk,Rocketz1Bruh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:57:05 2015 UTC,"Rondo and Collison will be on the court at the same time in a lot of sets. I seriously doubt the Kings would've dealt away Ray McCallum unless Andre was a sure thing. Dude is 39 years old and looking ahead; I'm not sure he really needs to be the everyday second string PG on a contender. You're probably right that Houston is desperate, and who knows, they might throw enough money at him to get him to listen. But it's widely believed by pretty much everyone that he's got an agreement to return to Sac."
kings,3d1nbk,NightWriter500,0,Mon Jul 13 03:15:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe the agreement was before the Rondo deal?  Miller doesn't even fit with a strong personality like Rondo. It would have made since for him to come back mentoring McCallum, but now he is not needed."
kings,3d1nbk,Rocketz1Bruh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:26:32 2015 UTC,"It was before the a Rondo deal. But that doesn't make much difference- before he was 3rd string behind Collison and Ray, now 3rd string behind Rondo/Collison. He's needed just the same as a player coach implementing/teaching the Karl system to the team. We'll see, maybe you're right and he'll go to Texas. I think we'll probably disagree about Houston being a better shot to win a title though, so the rest of our discussion is all based on different starting points."
kings,3d1nbk,NightWriter500,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:54:04 2015 UTC,"Andre Miller has a bunch of family connections in Sac. Maybe through his wife, IIRC."
kings,3d3nyo,sharkytowers76,6,Mon Jul 13 07:02:52 2015 UTC,"Alright, since no one else seems to be sharing. If you want an idea on the whole firing and all the other FO fiasco's you've been hearing about take a listen to our Cowbell Kingdom podcast on ex GM Pete D'Allessandro."
kings,3d3nyo,bradsbeds,6,Mon Jul 13 08:31:17 2015 UTC,"Summary: Malone was everything Kings players wanted as coach, but the losing (mainly due to DMC getting sick) coupled with an impatient FO that desires a run-and-gun offense (as opposed to Malone's defensive, grind it out style) necessitated a firing. And Malone got the can.   Also, Lakers suck.   Sorry, you'll always be the enemy. Until we win a series from you in dramatic fashion. Or forever. Whichever comes first."
kings,3d3nyo,icemanjl333,3,Mon Jul 13 08:53:49 2015 UTC,"Malone was found to be one of the refs from 2002 western conference finals.  Since on the resume he said he was honest and had integrity...  We realized he lied.  When Vivek brought in Vlade to negotiate bringing him on, he recognized him as one of the refs.  He had ptsd and canned his ass.  Fuck the Lakers.  I enjoyed you guys having Jeremy Lin. Steve Nash look great too.  So did Chris Paul."
kings,3d3nyo,yopeee,2,Mon Jul 13 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"Daellesandro had planned on Chris Mullen in as the coach at the end of the season and he had Vivek's ear.  Since Malone started to win, they were worried that it was going to be hard to fire a winning coach, so as soon as they had an opportunity, ie, Cousins got sick, they got rid of Malone."

kings,3d1z76,goldenonecenter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, til proven otherwise. He's as advertised so far and a nice fit for what Karl wants to do at C, plus pulls the pressure of Cousins."
kings,3d1z76,SacUp,2,Tue Jul 14 04:06:53 2015 UTC,I don't disagree strategy wise. The only thing that makes me think Kofous will start is that he's a George Karl guy. The last time he played for Karl he started 81 games. He also publicly stated that he wants to start. I think Kostas starts and WCS get abt 20-24 mpg this year as the 1st big off the bench..
kings,3d1z76,coachadam,0,Tue Jul 14 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think starting lineup will be:  PG:Rondo SG:Mclemore SF:Cassipi PF:Rudy C:Cousins  And the rotations will vary throughout the season.  I'd say 45 wins this season, possible 7th/8th seed."

kings,3cyyyq,4everpurple,13,Sun Jul 12 01:49:07 2015 UTC,Dude gets a bad rep because he was a first pick and didn't live up to it. He's still a solid player and he's a good shooter. I'm down with it either way
kings,3cyyyq,BASKETBALLgod,4,Sun Jul 12 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"Solid Player?  He sucks.  His shooting is overrated, he doesn't pass, rebound or play defense"

kings,3cyyyq,uututhrwa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:39:29 2015 UTC,Mid range pick and pop from the FT line he is probably top 10 in the league if just a bit motivated. It's probably gonna suck on defense but him Cousins and a pg like Rondo will mean the offense will be rolling.  They only need to get Josh Smith or JR Smith now and assemble the all-misfits and headcases team.

kings,3cyyyq,matty25,12,Sun Jul 12 01:47:57 2015 UTC,Vlade likely has seen how well the starting 5 has been for the Kings under Cousins and really addressed the depth as a result. Assuming this signing happens we go 11 deep now. Crazy.  C: Koufos/WCS PF: Cousins/Bargnani SF: Gay/Casspi/Butler SG: McLemore/Bellinelli PG: Rondo/Collison
kings,3cyyyq,ChangloriousBastard,9,Sun Jul 12 03:03:53 2015 UTC,What I love about the roster is that a lot of guys can play multiple positions if Karl wants to play different rotations. Collison and Rondo can guard the 1 or 2 if need be and would work well on the court together. Ben can play 3 in a small ball lineup. Gay is a solid small ball 4. All of our bigs can play the 4 or 5 (and have done so in the past).  We have the potential to cause some real matchup problems for other teams.
kings,3cyyyq,chandler55,8,Sun Jul 12 03:52:02 2015 UTC,can be a great scorer off the bench. doesnt play d well but what 2nd unit player plays amazing d anyways

Could be solid off the bench still. This will probably be a one year or two year deal with a team option after the first year. If it does turn out to be a small contract I have full reason to believe Vlade is gonna go after Ryan Anderson next FA because of his interest in a stretch 4 and Anderson would be a better upgrade.

kings,3cyyyq,WOL6ANG,2,Sun Jul 12 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"He wanted to come here after his MIP season but the Maloofs wouldn't pay him.   Don't blame him at all for taking that Pelican's money, he deserved/needed that big check. Fully expect Vivek to go after him when his contract is up."

kings,3cyyyq,ninjawartortle,6,Sun Jul 12 04:37:59 2015 UTC,He's a decent stretch 4/5. I'd pay him 3 mil but we probably have to offer the rest of our cap space or the MLE.
kings,3cyyyq,IMDATBOY,3,Sun Jul 12 01:48:27 2015 UTC,"Which is fine because after adding him, we won't have much room on the roster anyway."

kings,3cyyyq,matty25,6,Sun Jul 12 02:40:10 2015 UTC,I like this move. I suggested it earlier this offseason.  I assume that Koufos and Cousins start. WCS and Bargnani would be a good 2nd unit frontcourt together.
kings,3cyyyq,Poptart2776,3,Sun Jul 12 02:59:31 2015 UTC,Another center...? I thought we were good
kings,3cyyyq,IMDATBOY,3,Sun Jul 12 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"Looks like we're either planning on running Rudy at the 3 or just building depth in the case of front court injuries/trades. Also he gives a big man who can shoot, which we don't have and allows us to use more versatile lineups."

kings,3cyyyq,32rahul,5,Sun Jul 12 02:58:33 2015 UTC,Is he a good backup tho?
kings,3cyyyq,mostbasicusername,3,Sun Jul 12 02:14:34 2015 UTC,"10 and 4 off the bench as a stretch big should be the expectation, can play perfectly fine man to man defense, gets lost in team defense though."
kings,3cyyyq,jveezy,4,Sun Jul 12 02:18:42 2015 UTC,Good enough for me. There were times last year we had a hard enough time getting 10 and 4 out of some of our starters.

kings,3cyyyq,StayMe7o,-1,Sun Jul 12 02:07:41 2015 UTC,He can be a great player when he plays aggressive. Which is twice a season if you're lucky. Hope it works out for y'all though!
kings,3cyyyq,tman916x,4,Sun Jul 12 12:03:06 2015 UTC,Who else on our roster is a bust?
kings,3czggf,trilliam_clinton,8,Sun Jul 12 04:36:52 2015 UTC,"If all players live up to their potential I think our best starting lineup could be Rondo-Ben-Rudy-DMC-WCS. Darren will be 6th man getting the same amount of minutes as the starters. Karl will likely play at least 6-12 mins of two PG lineups. Ben and Rudy will start at the wings with Belinelli and Casspi rotating in, butler will see around 4-8 mins a game as well, probably doesn't play every game though. Boogie gets to play PF, with Rudy getting some minutes here in our small ball lineup, Bargs might even see back up minutes at the 4 as well. WCS, Koufos, and Bargs will get center minutes based on performance with Boogie playing center in small ball lineups.  Really this is all a crap shoot, Karl has a lot of pieces to work with. If we get Bargs we have 11 players who probably deserve playing time.  That's too many players to play a game, not a lot of minutes to go around, so it will be interesting to see what Karl comes up with."
kings,3czggf,-Hoopin-,2,Sun Jul 12 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a big believer in having a solid bench. Last year I would take another shot of tequila whenever I saw Collison and Cousins come off the court, and Reggie Evans and Stauskas step on. Now having maybe WCS, Bellineli, Casspi and Collison coming off the bench, perhaps I won't have to drink so much."
kings,3czggf,HypnoticONE,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:53:46 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I hear ya. It was hard to watch when our big three were on the bench last year.
kings,3czggf,-Hoopin-,6,Sun Jul 12 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"No one really knows what the line up is going to be. However you can kind of guess how the rotations are going to be.   My prediction for the starting line-up would be   Rondo  Mclemore  Gay  Boogie  Kosta  Reason why I feel so strongly about having Kosta start the 5 is because during the FA Kosta has expressed that he wants to start.  Kosta also played for George in Denver and I'm sure George wouldn't mind starting him. He started Kosta over Mozgov in Denver if that says anything.   WCS will most likely be backup for Kosta and that's great because that would mean he would get significant PT. He'll be able to develop faster. Once Bargs signs over I think he will eventually be a back up for boogie at the 4. Karl loves playing 2 point guards. In Denver he would use Andre Miller and Lawson to close out games. I definitely feel Collison and Rondo will see alot of playing time.   This is just all speculation on my part as a fan anyways, so take it with a grain of salt. I just know for a fact that we finally have some solid depth."
kings,3czggf,Narwhail0r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:50:44 2015 UTC,I think you're on to something with Kosta starting over WCS
kings,3czggf,BigGreekMike,4,Sun Jul 12 20:39:01 2015 UTC,The only guaranteed starters are Cousins and Gay at this point.
kings,3czggf,kingsin4,3,Sun Jul 12 14:19:03 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Cousins only playing 32-34 minutes a game.  Less, but more efficient minutes."
kings,3czggf,Arugon,2,Sun Jul 12 06:56:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's official that Bargs is coming, but all the same, it's probably very likely.   I'm not great with minute allocation, but something like: Rondo ~30 McLemore ~34-36 Gay 36+ Koufos~28-30(?) Cousins 36+  To begin the season, I'd say Koufos starts over WCS. If WCS turns out to be good right away, then he'll probably take over.   Most wing minutes: Ben, Rudy, Casspi, Bellinelli.   Casspi sixth man.   I think Rondo and Collison will play together, but not that much. Assuming we get Andre Miller back, he'd be playing with Collison more often than Rondo. Rondo is really ball-dominant, and in his case, that's not really a bad thing. Fortunately in this situation, Collison is also a good scorer, so he'd still fit with Rondo"
kings,3czggf,4everpurple,5,Sun Jul 12 04:57:51 2015 UTC,"I really think they've put together quite a versatile roster with the pieces they've acquired this offseason.    They can surround Boogie with shooters and go small with Gay at the 4 and Casspi at the 3. They can obviously go huge as well with any combo lineup of Koufos, WCS, Boogie and Bargs at the 4/5.     I think WCS & Rondo will really be the fulcrums to their season. If WCS picks up the game quickly (I think he will), they have arms and hands everywhere. Gay, Rondo, WCS, Boogie all have nice wingspans."
kings,3czggf,4everpurple,4,Sun Jul 12 05:09:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The versatility is insane. We can go small or big, without really sacrificing a lot at any position"
kings,3czggf,IMDATBOY,2,Sun Jul 12 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"None of us actually have any idea, it's wide open for debate"
kings,3czggf,WOL6ANG,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:57:08 2015 UTC,"I could see us doing what the Bucks did last year, very fluid line up that is based on match ups. I know Karl likes to stick to his guns and the guys he likes but we have so much versatility and depth now I would like to see be fluid."
kings,3cysdz,hipnerd,16,Sun Jul 12 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"Rondo, if for anything because Collison is a better scorer so you want to have those guys that can come off the bench when a team is struggling and help out some points on the board."
kings,3cysdz,HakunaMatata023,2,Sun Jul 12 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"At the same time, you want to have as much space around Cousins as possible. I like Rondo off the bench in small ball lineups."
kings,3cysdz,thepufferfish,11,Sun Jul 12 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"Rondo.  I love Collison and think he is a far better scoring guard than Rondo, but Rondo's experience, play-making and facilitation abilities are a great fit for a starting lineup that's already going to have 2 possible 20ppg threats.    This also allows us to beef up our bench's ability to score having Collison next to either Beli or Ben.  Our bench is gonna need scoring from the guard position due to our backup forwards/bigs being more defensive oriented.  The opposite could be said for the starting lineup, but I'm sure we can still count on Ben to make some noise starting at the 2.  Also, don't discount lineups with Collison at the 2.  That would be very effective, but probably a lineup that is less likely to start."
kings,3cysdz,IMDATBOY,5,Sun Jul 12 00:33:57 2015 UTC,I'd say Rondo
kings,3cysdz,4everpurple,5,Sun Jul 12 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"Rondo to help out the main guys score, and Collison to lead 2nd unit off the bench.           Rondo needs scoring teammates with him on the floor, he's not gonna be impactful with the 2nd unit lineup"
kings,3cysdz,peterkimmm,11,Sun Jul 12 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"Small ball playing both, mac at 3, rudy 4 and cuz 5"
kings,3cysdz,el_guapo_sr,5,Sun Jul 12 01:05:24 2015 UTC,That's a good lineup but a bad starting lineup. Ben can't guard starting sf. Also starting Rudy against big PFs could be a problem. We wouldn't have a backup pg/ball handler. Rondos game fits better with the starting lineup bc we have two great scorers and hopefully a consistent third in Ben. Rondo is one of the best ball distributors in the NBA. Collision can control the 2nd unit and be our first option off the bench.
kings,3cysdz,-Hoopin-,4,Sun Jul 12 05:24:50 2015 UTC,McLemore cannot guard a 3 lmao  Imagine him trying to stop James or Durant. He's not strong or smart enough yet.
kings,3cysdz,Ethanhekker,5,Sun Jul 12 02:10:01 2015 UTC,But how often are we going to be playing Lebron or Durant? It would be a decent lineup against the right opposition.
kings,3cysdz,osufanboy23,3,Sun Jul 12 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"Collision.  Honestly, until Rondo can prove otherwise, collision is demonstrably better than Rondo at just about everything.  He gelled with the team, was the incumbent starter, and provides better floor spacing and defense.  It just doesn't feel right to kick him to the curb just because we signed a reclamation project in rondo that hasn't earned jack shit with this team."
kings,3cysdz,WisteriaHysteria,3,Sun Jul 12 12:26:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going with Collison. I think Trill will be our best PF, but I don't think there will be enough shooters with WCS/Cousins/Rondo sharing the floor. The bench on the other hand, with Belinelli, Casspi, Butler, and (maybe) Bargnani has a plethora of shooters who need a play-maker like Rondo to create shots for them."

kings,3cysdz,WOL6ANG,3,Sun Jul 12 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to Collison. He was lighting the place up for us before the injury, and he should have even more opportunity under Karl's system. I also think he'll be better at pushing the ball.  Most imortantly. I think he deserves a chance to show what he can do under Karl's system before getting replaced."
kings,3cysdz,IMDATBOY,3,Sun Jul 12 02:23:56 2015 UTC,"In some weird way, I want Rondo to start and close games, but Collison to get more minutes. Probably as a means to try and balance chemistry issues. Though, I'd be comfortable with both of those guys on the floor during crunch time."

kings,3cydkc,truwarier14,16,Sat Jul 11 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Haha man for as much shit as Sixers fans have been giving us, we should really just take the high road though. Gotta feel for the team with a GM, who while being smart, is conducting an experiment that could result in nothing but losing basketball for a long time. Embiid really could have been their guy, and that's a huge blow. We definitely know the disappointment that injuries can bring, so regardless of some Sixers fans talking mad shit, you gotta feel for them as they really have nothing but the future to hope for. We're lucky we get an entertaining product on the court next year at the very least."
kings,3cydkc,4everpurple,6,Sat Jul 11 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"Soooo true. It gets really annoying and I try not to reciprocate it (even though I'll admit that I have sometimes). But I understand that it's gotta suck hearing this news. Not tryna sink to anyone's (regardless of who your team is) level. Being a fan of a Kings team that has gone through so much in the past decade, I feel for them"
kings,3cydkc,4everpurple,7,Sat Jul 11 22:40:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly man.  And I'm sure we've all reciprocated some of the trash talk, but that's just how sports is sometimes.  But obviously, it does us no good to attack them when they're down.  The extremely low losing records are bad enough.   Plus, it cracks me up at the logic behind it all.  Like, they got a great deal in the trade.  Literally gave up nothing of value and got nothing but upside in return.  Anyone would do that deal.  But completely disregarding the Kings' intentions, goals and further actions in order to shit on them is so pointless in terms of how good of a deal the Sixers got.  I understand the pick swaps are relevant, but outside of that, the other team doesn't need to lose the trade in order for you to win.    So when we look back at them, we need to understand the same thing: We don't need the Sixers to suck in order for the trade to be good for us.  Unless of course they are so good and we are so bad to the point that the pick swaps come into play, but (knock on wood a million times), that's highly unlikely with the amount of talent we've acquired."
kings,3cydkc,finnagohome,3,Sat Jul 11 22:58:57 2015 UTC,Wow. I seriously cannot agree more with literally everything you said. Especially about how one team doesn't have to win for the other to lose. I love the way you worded that. And it's so true. So many people don't understand that
kings,3cygk8,IMDATBOY,3,Sat Jul 11 22:38:07 2015 UTC,Looks like a better version of Reggie Evans
kings,3cygk8,_DrPepper_,4,Sat Jul 11 23:12:36 2015 UTC,Looks better at shot blocking.  But in no way would this guy rebound like Reggie.  He's an elite rebounder.
kings,3cygk8,4everpurple,2,Sat Jul 11 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"Skip to around 3:20 to see him erase Luka Mitrovic's (the 60th pick we received with Gudaitis) layup attempt.  He looks like a solid big man with that 6'10"" 250lb frame, and what appears to be a decently wide wingspan.  The most intriguing things about the guy are that he is 22 and at an NBA-ready weight, plays with a lot of aggression that you don't normally see from Euro-league bigs, and is oriented toward rim protection (2.3 blks per 40 min.).  Biggest weaknesses seem to be that he is a poor shooter and limited offensively.  On offense, he relies heavily on using his power to bulldoze through guys for easy buckets and highlight dunks.  However, at 250lbs, that might not be something that isn't an option for him at the NBA level.    Maybe the guy can actually secure a spot on the roster for this year as a 14th or 15th man in case injuries hit.  Who knows, he could get up and make some highlight reels with a block or two and we may be looking at a guy that can add to our front court depth a little or simply someone who makes a name for themselves as a potential shot blocker, which is valuable in this league and could be a nice trade piece down the line.    Or we might just surrender his rights or cut him or whatever to make room for other guys.  Who knows with mid-late second rounders.  http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Arturas-Gudaitis-67621/stats/"

kings,3cxj36,AssholeAlert3000,12,Sat Jul 11 18:04:59 2015 UTC,He said it solidifies it. Which it does.
kings,3cxj36,4everpurple,4,Sat Jul 11 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"embiid wasn't going to make the sixers better than the kings. rookies (unless they're shaq) rarely produce wins. the sixers were always going to be worse than the kings barring some major implosion (or really bad injury luck). from the sixers perspective, the value of the pick swaps doesn't change."
kings,3cxj36,AssholeAlert3000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"Rookies don't have but impacts on teams, unless they lack a lot of talent otherwise. Look at MCW. He put up crazy numbers because it was HIS team. Besides him, there wasn't much NBA talent tbh. He won ROY there. Now he's on the Bucks, and more flaws are becoming apparent. If Embiid played, he'd be one of ""the guys"" that the team relies on, so I think he'd put up pretty big numbers.   Edit:to clarify, I'm not trying to say he'd make them better than us, just that I think he'd have a bigger impact than you think"
kings,3cxj36,wehopeuchoke,3,Sat Jul 11 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"Big numbers =/= impact. MCW was definitely putting up big numbers on the Sixers, but his presence wasn't winning them a lot of games (obviously). The Sixers did better with him on the court, but that's in part because there was a significant drop-off in backcourt talent behind him.   That's not really the same with Embiid, who would be playing in a rotation with Noel and Okafor. Embiid's better than both of them, but the drop-off isn't as significant and Noel has an extra year of NBA experience. The marginal decrease in production from Embiid to whoever who will be taking his minutes this year is pretty slim.   But this is all kind of irrelevant. My central point is the injury doesn't affect the Kings- besides the schadenfreude from seeing miserable Sixers fans, I guess."

kings,3cxgs5,sdub,4,Sat Jul 11 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"We still can. But I think the question was always will Smith sign with us? I dont think he is influence by money, since he is guaranteed his Detriot money. He's probably waiting for the Free Agency to played out and decide which team is the best situation for him."
kings,3cxgs5,kingsin4,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think teams aren't that interested in him. If you think Josh Smith isn't interested in signing the largest contract he can, you might be talking about a different Josh Smith than I am."
kings,3cxgs5,oh_peaches,4,Sat Jul 11 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Who knows? Maybe, at this point in his career, he just wants to win. Maybe he wants to be on a team with guys he knows and loves. Maybe, just maybe, he doesn't care so much about money. Not saying it's likely, not saying it isn't. But you never know.   Seeing as he's never had a better opportunity to join forces with Rondo, I think he's at least considering signing with us. Don't forget that he took the vet min (I'm pretty sure. If not, it was cheap) with the Rockets last year."
kings,3cxgs5,4everpurple,3,Sat Jul 11 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"He signed for the biannual exception (around $2 mil) and apparently was only interested in playing for a team that offered him a starting spot. If he wanted to screw the paycheck and play for a team with a shot at winning, why wouldn't he just go back to the Rockets? Don't they check off more boxes than the Kings? He's well known to be best buds with Dwight. If money was not a factor, he should choose the Rockets if they wanted him back. Maybe they don't want him back.  But money is likely the biggest factor for Josh Smith. He's 29, I believe, which means that this is/was his last opportunity for a sizable multi-year contract. 33 year olds don't tend to ink big money deals unless they're named Kobe. The fact that he has not yet been offered one makes it look increasingly like the market is very soft for him because he's not respected around the league for his play. If the Kings sign him for a small amount of money on a short contract, then fine. I'm not going to be upset because at that price Karl can sit his ass and not think twice about it. I really don't understand this sub's fetish for a low BBIQ forward who fancies himself a 3-point gunner. The Kings are far better off giving these minutes to Casspi, WCS, and Butler and I don't see any legitimate basketball argument to the contrary. /rant"
kings,3cxgs5,oh_peaches,2,Sat Jul 11 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"He told the coach he preferred the 6th man role once he got to Houston, and I highly doubt money was the main motivator when it came to choosing between Dallas and Houston, where he had close friends on each team. And it's not a bad thing to want a bigger role, a lot of guys want to contribute as much as they can. Josh has bad shot selection and a big contract from a team he didn't fit on like Rudy, but people assume that means he has a bad personality. As we've seen with Rudy in Sac and Josh on the rockets, that's not necessarily true."
kings,3cxgs5,IMDATBOY,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:04:44 2015 UTC,I hope I haven't insinuated that Josh Smith would be a bad lockerroom guy or has a bad attitude - I don't know if I've heard anything credible to suggest that he is. I don't think he'd be a helpful asset to us on the basketball court.
kings,3cxgs5,oh_peaches,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"Rebounds: Dude got more than 6 rebounds/game last year, and that was with limited minutes. Blocks: Last year he blocked 1.4 shots/game.  Just consider for a minute how gross it would be to put this guy next to Cuz and WCS.  Who's going to want to get into that lane? Assists: 3.34/game for a PF/SF.  Yikes.   We wouldn't be bringing him in to be a scoring option really.  He's got game, but he'd have to understand his role- Cuz is #1, Rudy is #2, then some other guys.  He'd be here for all the other things he does, and if he's ok with that, we'd be a sick, sick force."
kings,3cxgs5,NightWriter500,2,Sun Jul 12 02:58:43 2015 UTC,"I actually don't disagree with much of what you said. You left the bad parts of his stats out, though. He turns the ball over as much as he assists and shoots a horrid percentage for a forward. That said, IF he does know his role and play within it, he'd be an asset. Then again, there's a big IF like that for a lot of guys too. I'm just not optimistic enough to think that Smith can learn how to play basketball more efficiently in one offseason."
kings,3cxgs5,oh_peaches,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:09:35 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'm an optimist about things like this. I just get excited about possibilities. Like how good would the defense of Rondo, Smith, Cuz, WCS and Ben be? Amazeballs. If he stuck more to passing rather than shooting, how fluid an offense could Smith be with Rondo and Collison dishing it to Cuz and Rudy? Sick as fuck. How realistic is it that all this would work out like it does in my head? Slim, I suppose. But what's to lose? Low risk, high reward."
kings,3cxgs5,NightWriter500,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"If he stuck more to passing rather than shooting   That's the thing - I would love to see this if it were to happen. If the Kings happen to land Smith, I'll root for him to do just this...and I will root for him."

Best offseason in a loooooong time. I'm pumped."
kings,3ctuwf,ZombieFeces,21,Fri Jul 10 19:07:03 2015 UTC,Solid vet pick up.  Don't believe he has alot in his tank but definitely a good role player.  I'm gonna take this as a sign that Smith isn't coming
kings,3ctuwf,yopeee,11,Fri Jul 10 19:00:59 2015 UTC,Great locker room addition. Something this team can never get enough of.
kings,3ctuwf,thepufferfish,3,Fri Jul 10 19:04:21 2015 UTC,I would wager Smith wants to see where the Rockets take him this year. We may get him next season depending on who does better.
kings,3ctuwf,randomstormtrooper,2,Fri Jul 10 20:00:48 2015 UTC,Sounds about right. Clippers are an option too
kings,3ctuwf,yopeee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:02:23 2015 UTC,What should I know about this guy?
kings,3ctuwf,Bocheetus,9,Fri Jul 10 21:22:56 2015 UTC,He's gonna play off the bench and be a huge key factor in calming the locker room. Had a good 3pt shot at one point but wouldn't call him a phenomenal shooter.  Plays solid D.  2x all star and has played on a championship team.  Vet minimum contract for two years...  Solid pick up.  Main this is his level head to keep our young guys focused.
kings,3ctuwf,yopeee,3,Fri Jul 10 21:27:06 2015 UTC,He's pretty damn clitch. Has ice in his veins. Shoots close to 40 percent on 3. Won't get burned on defense. Huge locker room presence and vet experience for guys like Ben Mac and WCS. I mean just an excellent move by Vlade to bring in more vet experience and assess the lack of 3 point shooting. He will be great in Karl's system. Old but will be solid for 10 to 15 mins per game and probably skipping back to backs. Pretty much all we needed anyways. Brilliant signing. Didn't like Smith idea anyways
kings,3ctuwf,_DrPepper_,3,Sat Jul 11 02:01:08 2015 UTC,not nearly as good
kings,3ctuwf,Ethanhekker,5,Fri Jul 10 19:32:38 2015 UTC,I think the whole point of this was to have some level headedness in the locker room
kings,3ctuwf,Poptart2776,2,Fri Jul 10 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"Apparently he's great in the locker room.  Also, in the later stages of his career he's proven to be a reliable 3 pt shooter.  What's interesting about the roster, and I do love what Vlade has done, is that we don't have a PF on the roster. We have C's who can play PF (Cousins and WCS) and SF's who can play PF (Gay and Casspi) but we don't have a true PF unless you consider Eric Moreland.  I'm ok with that but it is interesting to me."

kings,3ctuwf,fuzzydunflop,4,Sat Jul 11 08:50:14 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy about this if it didn't likely mean Smith isn't coming. But unless we have some magic cap action up our sleeves I don't understand, I think we have our final roster."

kings,3ctuwf,sdub,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:39:05 2015 UTC,No one. We never had it in the first place.
kings,3ctuwf,truwarier14,2,Fri Jul 10 22:05:29 2015 UTC,"Every team gets an MLE.   Per wikipedia:   Once a year, teams can use a mid-level exception (MLE) to sign a player to a contract for a specified maximum amount. The amount of the MLE and its duration depend on the team's cap status. The MLE was initially set at $5 million for a duration of four years for teams that are over the cap either before or after the signing, but under the luxury tax apron, which is $4M above the tax line. Teams above the luxury tax apron have an MLE that was initially set at $3 million with a three-year duration. Teams with cap room, previously ineligible for the MLE, have a new MLE, initially $2.5 million with a two-year duration. The MLE was frozen at the stated levels through the 2012–13 season, since then, it will increase by 3% per season (with the percentage based on the initial amount of the exception, and not compounded).[6] In turn, this means that MLEs in the current 2014–15 season are:  $5.305 million for teams without cap room, below the tax apron  $3.278 million for teams over the tax apron  $2.575 million for teams with cap room  Before the 2011 CBA, the MLE was equal to the average NBA salary for all teams over the cap. Teams with cap room were previously ineligible for the MLE.[6] The Mid-Level Exception for the 2008–09 NBA season was $5.585 million.[23] The MLE was $5.854 million for the 2009–10 NBA regular season.[24]   If I read that correctly, we have about 2.5 million we can use for the MLE"
kings,3ctuwf,ChangloriousBastard,2,Fri Jul 10 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"Right, but when we made a salary dump we lost our right to use it. I'm on mobile right now so I can't really give you the details. there should be someone else here who can explain."

kings,3ctuwf,ChangloriousBastard,2,Fri Jul 10 21:09:42 2015 UTC,"Basically we did a salary dump right before the free agency and we forfeited the MLE. We entered the FA with $39M in active contracts way below the cap. That's how we lost the MLE. However, since we don't know how and what we used to sign all of the FA we may still have our room MLE of $2.8M"

I personally thought if a trade was going to happen it would be after the draft and after Summer League.   Vlade pretty much said the main reason he didn't take Mudiay was because he never saw him play with his own eyes.

Your system has to be able to adjust to the talent you have.  “(San Antonio’s Gregg) Popovich has shown that. His team now is totally different than it was before. Good coaches adjust to the players because it’s a players’ league, not a coaches’ league. I don’t care who you are, if you have bad talent, you’re not going to win in the league.”  How did Adelman do it?  “By understanding every player is different,” he says. “You don’t treat everybody the same. There are some players who accept more discipline. Other players will not allow you to call them out in front of the team or in the newspaper. You have to put the players in a position where they feel they can succeed, and the team can succeed, too. If you can win, they’ll buy into it.  “That’s a hard thing nowadays. Many players have an entourage. It’s not one agent; sometimes it’s four agents. It’s family and friends and hangers-on. Everybody has an influence. You have to figure out how to deal with that. The only way you can is to form a relationship with the player, where he trusts you. Otherwise, he’s not going to listen to you after awhile.”  Adelman did a marvelous job of getting his players to buy in. He got the most out of players who had feuded with other coaches, players such as Rod Strickland and Webber and Latrell Sprewell. A rare exception was Tim Hardaway, whom he had trouble with at Golden State.  “I blame a lot of that on myself,” Adelman says. “I went from the Trail Blazer job, where everything broke well for us until the end when they fired me, but it was a great scenario. When I went to the Warriors, I listened to people I shouldn’t have listened to instead of doing it how I felt it should be done. I alienated Tim, got on his bad side, and it was hard to turn that back around. We ended up trading him and making other trades, and it didn’t work out.  “I learned my lesson. If you’re going to succeed, you’d better figure out a way to get along with your main players. For the most part, I was able to do that.”"

kings,3ctq21,lmhTimberwolves,7,Fri Jul 10 21:00:20 2015 UTC,Adelman is too old imo. Just let him enjoy retirement.

He's a good coach, but his final years with us he was just out of it. You could hear it in his voice and in his body language. Wife healthy or not, I don't think he has the fortitude to come back to coaching."

kings,3ctq21,truwarier14,3,Fri Jul 10 18:43:24 2015 UTC,I would argue that Webber's knee injury and the Maloof's going broke put us where we are.  Adelman getting canned was a result of those things.  I agree that Adelman was and probably still is an excellent coach.

kings,3ctkyy,uncreative157,4,Fri Jul 10 22:01:06 2015 UTC,no report anywhere of this turning in to a second round pick at any point.  also the 76ers-heat pick and 76ers-lakers picks become completely unprotected 1st rounders for the 76ers in the next one or two years.

kings,3crsrj,NightWriter500,5,Fri Jul 10 17:46:03 2015 UTC,I always wanted him. If he didn't have his issues we probably wouldn't even have a shot. Same with Rondo. However Gay was able to turn it around in Sacramento so I'd love to see these guys do the same.
kings,3crsrj,Drunk_Physicist504,4,Fri Jul 10 07:30:53 2015 UTC,We might as well go for broke at this point.
kings,3crsrj,sakebomb69,2,Fri Jul 10 15:52:41 2015 UTC,"Chemistry is relative. If you put people with similar attitudes together than it's usually beneficial for team cohesion. People understand the way their team mates think because they are so self absorbed that they can only understand the mind of one of their equals. Rondo is a pass first point guard and it may be out of necessity more-so than skill but having that be his game has made him a good passer. His relationship with Kevin Garnett on the court has seen him benefit from a lot of ball movement through the low block. He runs the break, which an athlete like cousins is great at. I bet DMC is going to get 3-4 extra transition FGA a game and love Rondo for it. The that that Rajon can't hit a 15 footer means DeMarcus will get more offensive rebounds and get extra high percentage looks.  Honestly, the Kings are in good shape and need to focus on depth. If you want Rondo gone by the trade deadline he is an expiring contract that someone will take on if he plays well and has a good attitude. If not, it's because he DMC and Rudy get alone which isn't bad at all. If they run the ball through Gay a lot like they did with Pierce in Boston than sharing possession should lead to better looks and when you get good looks you play well and everyone is happy.  This is George Karl guys......do you honestly think that anyone on the Kings right now is nuttier than Shawn Kemp? Karl knows how to manage every kind of player. He's managed and won with stars like Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson who have had all sorts of attitude or character concerns. Mostly, they're just ignorant human beings which stands to reason as it is the great capitalist construct of profession sports being a vehicle of spectable for the bourgeosie to confuse people into believing any of that shit actually matters. Point being; trust George Karl. You trusted Rick Adelman, after all."
kings,3crsrj,victoriamproletarii,2,Fri Jul 10 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"I still don't want him.  I don't think he fits anywhere, nor will he be happy if he's getting like 15 mins/night which is where I'd have him.  We have two SFs that are better than him, and we have three PF/Cs that I'd rather see get minutes over him too."

As for me though I've always wanted him, at least if the price is reasonable. He'd be a good backup to WCS or even starter if WCS isn't ready yet. People just think about him as playing in Detroit but he is a good player he just didn't fit that system at all and it showed once he went to Houston because he started playing much better. He's not far removed from his ATL days when he was playing at a high level and in the right system with the right team I think he could get back to that. He needs to be at the 4 though, maybe some minutes here and there at 3 but most of his time should be spent at the 4."

I do agree that winning will solve a lot of problems although the Nuggets won a lot of games with Karl there and there was still discord. Time will tell..."
kings,3cq2gp,Schwaginator,3,Thu Jul 9 22:37:06 2015 UTC,Fair points.
kings,3cq2gp,matty25,4,Fri Jul 10 00:19:50 2015 UTC,Cheers. Let's hope they can coexist! I want playoffs!
kings,3cq2gp,Schwaginator,3,Fri Jul 10 00:21:30 2015 UTC,HELL YEAH! That would be bonkers.
kings,3cq2gp,Narwhail0r,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:26:47 2015 UTC,Cousins just had to buy into Karl's philosophy. He probably fucked up by trading to get him traded first though. Winning changes everything. Let this season begin!
kings,3cq2gp,Arugon,6,Thu Jul 9 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is all this 3rd party information bullshit speculation.  Like George Karl should have come out 2 weeks ago and addressed the current situation to the Media instead of allowing crappy reporters like WOJ to spew bullshit for weeks.  This is 2015, hell upload a youtube video for gods sake.  Letting the speculation run rampant aggravated the situation ten-fold."
kings,3cq2gp,FatBitchExclusive,2,Thu Jul 9 22:27:46 2015 UTC,Exactly!   Look at what Cuban did for example. They could've ended this so quick.
kings,3cq2gp,JonTheBruin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:04:35 2015 UTC,The other side to that is that maybe they don't give two shits about what the media thinks. They just keep it within themselves?
kings,3cq2gp,N1celyDunn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:02:47 2015 UTC,"I think its probably safe to assume that this isn't a case where the national media just decided to take a shit on sacramento with bull shit speculation, rather its probably safe to assume that there existed genuine animosity between the two.  In fact Vlade all but confirmed it on both Rome and Grant's show today.    Both guys were probably at fault here with Boogie's agent talking to Woj Stein et all, and Karl openly shopping DMC behind Vlade's back. Any neutral observer can only assume that the situation in Sac was truly akin to a dumpster fire."
kings,3cq2gp,_DrPepper_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"But it's not bullshit, Vlade just said its a real beef.. Karl has the chance to say it wasn't true but gave an answer that made it seem true.. So it's not third party  bullsht at this point"
kings,3cq2gp,P3zcore,4,Fri Jul 10 01:35:11 2015 UTC,Kobe and Shaq hated each other but they had one thing in common: WINNING. It's the one thing that kept them from killing each other every day. The hunger and thirst to win a championship. I'm not worried about Karl and Cousins. They have the same hunger.
kings,3cq2gp,adamento,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:51:50 2015 UTC,LOL @ SHITWAVES
kings,3cqpe6,spenrad,7,Fri Jul 10 00:30:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely possible. The Pelicans made the squeeze into the 8th spot last year, and I think we're certainly talented enough to do the same this year. Especially given that, as you mentioned, we can scratch the Blazers and possibly the mavs off the list of playoff teams. Our competition (out of non-playoff teams from last year) will be OKC, PHX, and maybe UTA. I don't see DEN improving enough to contend at all. LAL is LOL. OKC is pretty much a lock to make it, but that still leaves one spot open and I think we've improved more than PHX or UTA."
kings,3cqpe6,foxmtbr,5,Fri Jul 10 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not too high on PHX but I just had this discussion with my roommate and I remembered how GOOD Utah was at the end of the season. They are going to be really good this year too and could definitely make a playoff run. 8, 9, 10 will probably be some combination of Kings, Mavs and Jazz."
kings,3cqpe6,oh_peaches,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. IMO the Kings and Jazz will be duking it out for the 8th spot until the end of the year. Dubs, Spurs, Clips, Grizz, Rockets, and Thunder are 6 virtual locks unless something dramatic happens. I suppose the Pelicans are the favorites to win the 7th spot but I'm not so sold on them - I think they are a bubble team. Assuming this likely scenario, I like the Kings for the 8th over the Jazz because we're far more veteran and have better scoring (though Jazz the better defense). Mavs look a mess now that Jordan is a Clip. Phoenix is young and tough but just not talented enough to compete unless everything breaks perfectly for them.   I'm scary optimistic. Last year I predicted 35 wins so I'm not like some delusional optimist."
kings,3cqpe6,SacUp,2,Fri Jul 10 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"Hell yes it does.  Kings have a deep roster with little difference between starters and bench at most positions. Portland is out, MIN needs another year. PHX is out. Mavs out."
kings,3cqpe6,Wallamaru,2,Fri Jul 10 04:09:36 2015 UTC,"I think there are 6 teams in the west that, barring anything crazy happening, are locks for the playoffs: GS, HOU, MEM, LAC, SAS, OKC.  After that I think it will be a five way fight for the last two spots: NOP, SAC, UTA, PHO, MIN.  Then the struggling teams: LAL, POR, DEN, DAL with DAL being the worst of the lot by a country mile.   LAL could surprise though. They did better in FA than many give them credit for."
kings,3cqpe6,oh_peaches,2,Fri Jul 10 05:47:51 2015 UTC,"The Wolves a bubble team? I like their talent, but I really don't see them competing seriously until next year or the year after. Towns would have to be AMAZING."
kings,3cqpe6,Wallamaru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:22:48 2015 UTC,"I think the TWolves are going to surprise some people. They were really competitive in most of their loses last season, even against good competition. I think they are a longshot to get a seed (I have them at the bottom of my middle list), but I can see them crackin' a few skulls this coming season."

kings,3cqpe6,jkopecky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer. Everyone's talking about NOLA like they're a lock but they barely grabbed the 8 seed last year. With a lot of teams getting more competitive from the bottom they're going to have to fight to stay in the playoffs.   That said I'd put them as having the highest probability of the teams that aren't a ""lock""."
kings,3cqpe6,Wallamaru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. I put all the teams I listed in the order that I think they will finish.
kings,3cqpe6,CeJeH,2,Fri Jul 10 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on whether or not OKC matches that offer sheet Enes Kanter signed with Portland today.  I could see us competing for a playoff spot if everybody plays to the best of their abilities all year, there's no internal turmoil, and no injuries. Dallas and Portland are more than likely dropping out. OKC will be back in. That leaves 1 spot up for grabs with us, Phoenix, and Utah all competing. That's also assuming that New Orleans is as good as they were last year.  It's possible. Not likely, but possible."
kings,3cqpe6,Sharks_Eat_People,2,Fri Jul 10 08:23:28 2015 UTC,"We've got to remember, there are other really good improving teams in the West too. The Thunder will be back at full strength next year, so they'll replace the Blazers. The Mavs are looking like they might fall off a bit so that 8 spot will be in competition between Us/Jazz/Mavs/Suns at the least."

Maybe adjust to 30-35 if not so much. Parsons and Dirk are good enough to distinguish them from the dregs of the league, I think."
kings,3cqpe6,Wallamaru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"Dirk can't play big minutes anymore and Parsons is no superstar. He can facilitate offense but he won't ever be the guy to go off for 35/20 a night. With their roster, he's gonna have to be to get to that many wins in the west.   That team is done. Funny considering how many of their fans were talking shit about the Kings FA moves before all the dust settled. Fuck 'em."
kings,3cqpe6,oh_peaches,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"At least you have to admit that they're both veteran and competent. No, they're not very talented anymore but they do have some players that can play. Plus, it's looking more like Deron will sign with them, too.

kings,3cpl6q,yopeee,2,Thu Jul 9 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need to necessarily list him at 4 or 5 officially. Let's say WCS takes the starting role a bit early in the season (I'm not expecting him to start right away, but if he's good, he can still start fairly early on). If that happens, that gives us endless matchup possibilities. Boogie can guard the stronger and slower guy, and WCS could guard the quicker guy, or if he's a stretch four, WCS would guard him too.   Even if WCS doesn't get the start early on, he could still do that off the bench"
kings,3cpl6q,4everpurple,3,Thu Jul 9 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"I'd rather keep Cousins at the 5.  Few people in the NBA can dominate 7+ft'rs like Cousins can.  I think having Cousins at the 4 and someone else at the 5 would actually shrink the Floor spacing, which is definitely NOT a good thing.  Cousins at the 5 can stretch the floor, dominate the paint and boards all from the 5 position.  I think Rudy running the 4th spot would be perfect, it would stretch  out the spacing ALOT giving DMC more room to operate.  I just don't see much benefit of DMC running the 4th with our current roster.  EDIT: Also keep in mind that a big emphasis for DMC this season will be incorporating the 3pt shot into his offense.  A center that is a threat at the 3pt line makes an offense MUCH more flexible."

kings,3cpl6q,N1celyDunn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:43:17 2015 UTC,It also doesn't make sense to start our only small forward at the 4 when we have multiple players for PF/Center
kings,3cpl6q,N1celyDunn,2,Fri Jul 10 03:50:40 2015 UTC,Yes. He's always wanted to. Let him play the 4 unless he gets abused at the 4.
kings,3cpl6q,cmeng,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:53:30 2015 UTC,I remember last season Karl was encouraging Cousins to shoot 3s. I'm not sure if it's because the season was a wash or he'd like to see him add some spacing and a deep threat. I believe Boogie could shoot about 33% if he took enough chances.
kings,3cpl6q,spenrad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think it matters at all. However, Cuz isn't going to be able to guard any stretch 4s. I don't think he has the quickness to keep up with them."
kings,3cpl6q,jennys0,0,Thu Jul 9 23:02:29 2015 UTC,"Pros:  It's his natural position, that's what he played in college.  Being at the 4 gives him more space to be a dominant offensive threat.  If it's with WCS at the 5, he is fast enough and a great enough defender to not be as big of a liability when playing vs small ball.  If you thought Boogie was a mismatch at the 5, he would be even more of a mismatch at the 4.  Cons:  With the trend of the NBA shifting towards small ball, 2 bigs may be a defensive liability due to lack of quickness.  Spacing is also a big issue unless 3 out of the 4 other positions have long range capability.  For example, with the 5 and Rondo not being an outside threat teams can help defense and clog the paint very easily.  Also, George Karl and the FO seems to be pushing the Cousins at C + Gay at the 4 + 2 ball handler system."
kings,3cpl6q,divini,0,Thu Jul 9 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"I think he's a better Center than he is PF but given that we also have two other C's on the roster in Koufos and WCS, Cousins should be playing PF. (I know people says WCS is a PF but given his skillset, he's best suited as a C.)  It could lead to less foul trouble which is a good thing but overall I'm not so sure about it."
kings,3confq,bababerands,9,Thu Jul 9 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"None of us really know Fegan at all.  But looking from the outside in, the guy looks slimey.  I guess from DMC's perspective, he's looking out for his best interest.  Agents have a job, but man... his ethics.  Good grief.  DMC is so loyal, too.  It'd take a lot for him to drop Fegan."
kings,3confq,golfingmadman,3,Thu Jul 9 15:53:32 2015 UTC,As long as he is loyal to us too (which he has been at every opportunity)
kings,3confq,pocketmonsters,8,Thu Jul 9 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"Who knows. History has clearly repeated itself, but whatever makes Boogie happy..."
kings,3confq,KF43,5,Thu Jul 9 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"Here's my take: Feagan is a Yale trained attorney and he specializes in NBA contracts. I bet he's a really charismatic, intelligent dude in person and Boogie is a loyal mofo and it would be hard for him to distrust someone who's ""been there"" for him. I doubt boogie is even able to see thru Feagan's IF Feagan is dishonest.   Then again the fuck do I know"
kings,3confq,FatBitchExclusive,6,Thu Jul 9 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"The dude has an undisputed history of causing drama. Maybe Boogie is disputing the part about his agent being a joke, since Fegan's moves have technically resulted in DeAndre having a better role in his offense (hopefully), Dwight becoming a hot commodity amidst a wave of criticism over his offense, and Boogie now has a team built around him. His methods are questionable, but he gets the job done, so far.  That being said, ""he just seems to cause problems for organizations"" still seems to be true. Both the Lakers and the Mavericks have been royally screwed by players under Fegan's agency. Perhaps we'll just see what the fallout is from the DeAndre drama, and Boogie (and all of us) can see just how good of a deal DeAndre, Dwight, and Fegan's lesser known agents get since Fegan's reputation has seemingly taken a real hit this year and there is a chain of events that support his popularly received reputation.  Unless the truth is completely different from what we see and owners really are the driving force behind these shenanigans while Fegan just tries to come up top, I know I would be very wary about dealing with any of Fegan's clients at this point, and once that opinion is shared among multiple owners, that becomes leverage."

kings,3cpps1,jackellekcaj,2,Fri Jul 10 01:23:56 2015 UTC,yup Cuban bumped him up.  He made a lot more money considering taxes than signing with us and tbh we could easily be worse than them

kings,3cpps1,Narwhail0r,2,Thu Jul 9 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"I doubt he is. Honestly, I dont think he ever was serious about signing with us. I think he used us as leverage to get a better deal with Dallas. I remembered reading Dallas was offering him around $12M. Right after he met with us and we offerred him a $16M, he signed with Dallas for $14M that same day. Considering there is no state income tax in TX, $14M in TX isnt much less than $16M in CA. To me that look like he was only using us.   Plus he signed with Dallas before DAJ even committed to Dallas. I dont think DAJ was the main reason he chose Dallas."

The Mavs and Trailblazers dropping this season really opens up the Western Conference. I really think this is the season for us to make the playoffs. This is seriously the best coach and roster we've had in a decade"

kings,3cndmi,zakyop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:27:57 2015 UTC,Wow that wooshed right past me. I'd put them in tied between 3rd and 4th. It's a race between us and the Jazz.
kings,3cndmi,Narwhail0r,3,Thu Jul 9 07:31:04 2015 UTC,We beat the Pelicans. Something is eating me about that team but I will for sure say it's more of a hunch than analytical observations.   I believe that we will make 6th seed but 2nd and 6th last year was like a game or so difference.
kings,3cndmi,yopeee,2,Thu Jul 9 08:01:38 2015 UTC,I think they're fixing that this year so that seeds are based purely off eins rather than conference winners as well. Edit: Division
kings,3cndmi,SmashBrosEntusianst,2,Thu Jul 9 13:58:40 2015 UTC,One thing that we definitely have going for us in terms of beating the Pelicans? Boogie always goes off against AD
kings,3cndmi,4everpurple,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"Only reason why I put them above us is because they have Alvin Gentry that's going to finally utilize AD right. I think we have a slight edge though, but we'll see."
kings,3cndmi,Narwhail0r,2,Thu Jul 9 08:08:15 2015 UTC,"this is what I predict the playoff seeding is going to be:   Spurs - rejuvenated and deep.  Aldridge is an mvp candidate Warriors - little bit of a hangover, and as defending champs will have a target on their back on a nightly basis.  Still, they'll improve as a team Thunder - KD and Westbrook back at full, they'll be on a mission. Clippers - will find a way to get their 55 wins like usual.     The difference in the contenders and pretenders     Kings - YEAH BOIIIIIII.  Mark my works and stamp it.  We'll be this good. Grizz - largely the same team, but now a year older.  I think our front court destroys theirs now, and that's their big advantage. Rockets - Screw these fuccbois.  Harden as a player broke during the last playoffs and their shallow team won't be able to keep up with everyone making improvements in the west. Pelicans -  I do think they get better as a team with a better coach, but they're too injury prone and that's going to set them back a lot again.   Edit: yo, FUCK reddits stupid formatting.  The second 1-4 should be labeled 5-8"
kings,3cndmi,WisteriaHysteria,0,Thu Jul 9 09:13:02 2015 UTC,Yea we shall see.  I still believe the Pelicans are just a mess of a team.  Alot of talent with nothing to show for it but AD.
kings,3cndmi,yopeee,2,Thu Jul 9 08:12:39 2015 UTC,"I predict the Kings easily making it into the Playoffs at 7th seed.  Infact I give them a 20% chance of even making it into the second round.   I just don't see how we CAN'T Succeed with our bloated roster.  NO WAY we don't get 45 wins.  If the Kings fail to get 45 wins, it will be Karl's fault and no one else's.  Karl has the talent, now he needs to apply it."

kings,3cndmi,cmeng,4,Fri Jul 10 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"The Spurs will be better (which is a scary thought) because of LMA.   The Bucks will be better because Jabari should be healthy and they got Moose. Plus young guys like MCW and Giannis developing.   Timberwolves (but not substantially) because they got KAT and their young guys will continue to develop.   Pelicans I guess. Because of Gentry? If they actually use AD better and more often, then they'll be better.   Thunder, only because they sucked last year compared to what their healthy roster can normally do.   I fully agree, OP. I think there's a very good chance that the Kings improve the most out of any team, for multiple reasons. We were a better team than our record showed last year, and because our roster has greatly improved this offseason."
kings,3cndmi,4everpurple,3,Thu Jul 9 06:49:16 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that the T-Wolves will get quite a bit better just by having decent health.  They were pretty banged up past year and their team was significantly better when Rubio was on the court (even if his stats aren't impressive and he was hurt most of 2015).  KAT obviously helps Minnesota in a massive way going forward but Wiggins & LaVine in year 2 with some veterans like Rubio, Martin, KG & Pekovic can be a sneaky good part of the schedule if they're healthy.  Won't be a playoff team but they'll be improved.  It's also not as if the Pelicans misused Anthony Davis.  NOLA was injured all last year too, more than most teams in the league.  Trading a first rounder for Jrue Holiday might've been silly but he's still a great two way guard and the Pelicans will be in the hunt for a playoff seed again.  As a Bulls fan, I hope you're right and Sacramento takes the leap this year though."
kings,3cndmi,poorchris,3,Thu Jul 9 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting take here Cotton, /u/4everpurple seems to believe that the Milwaukee Bucks play in the Western Conference when their record in fact, has no effect on the Kings playoff seeding. Let’s see how this plays out."

kings,3cn7et,Zombizle,9,Thu Jul 9 06:21:50 2015 UTC,Kings hate been real.... Lol
kings,3cn7et,Jabroni916,9,Thu Jul 9 06:43:58 2015 UTC,For a second round pick when Ray is already developing very well..... This will bite us in the ass. He will be playing like patty mills over there . Dang it
kings,3cn7et,hipnerd,12,Thu Jul 9 06:20:20 2015 UTC,It might not be about us. Ray was going to be buried deep on our bench. Trading him to a team that will play him is the right thing to do for Ray -- who helped us through a tough injury year.   Sometimes teams don't try to dick over their players.
kings,3cn7et,sketchy_crab,3,Thu Jul 9 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, good for Ray, but dumb for us.  He could have been great for us in a year when Rondo leaves.  Not to metion that both of our point guards have had season-ending injuries in recent seasons.    He'll get a lot out of playing for SA and I'm happy for him, but I wish we had kept him.  And if the Spurs play as well as I think they will next season, we just landed ourselves the 60th pick in the draft."
kings,3cn7et,The_Sacramento_Kings,2,Thu Jul 9 07:24:50 2015 UTC,"This is what i thought the case is. We just buried him in PGs, he deserves a chance to be a rotation guy. Good guy vlade hooked him up."
kings,3cn7et,_DrPepper_,3,Thu Jul 9 13:22:51 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Vlade and Pop are close because of the Serbian heritage. I feel like Pop hooked us up with Belinelli and in return Pop wanted Ray Mac. I like that we have an inside with the Spurs. It can come in handy in the future if the Spurs have to offload someone for cap relief like their bond with the Hawks. Vlade is a true G. He's running the show
kings,3cn7et,jimbrope,9,Fri Jul 10 01:06:22 2015 UTC,Pop choses his players so obviously he sees something. By no means is this anything like IT. Andre is a player coach and can facilitate an offense with bellinelli on perimeter and koufos in post.   Smith > Ray.
kings,3cn7et,4everpurple,3,Thu Jul 9 06:46:14 2015 UTC,Even tho he did well for us last year I hope this isnt just to sign Andre for George
kings,3cn7et,The_Sacramento_Kings,5,Thu Jul 9 06:27:01 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with Andre? Yeah, he's super super old, but he can ball. His passing is what we need. Yeah I know we have Rondo, but you can't have too much passing. And he's a super smart player! He'll take the vet min anyway. It'll barely cost anything."
kings,3cn7et,4everpurple,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:51:39 2015 UTC,Ray cost nothing either he was on his rookie deal as a second rounder.
kings,3cn7et,bpralayscomedy,2,Thu Jul 9 13:24:05 2015 UTC,Okay...but Andre can do things for us that Ray can't. That's the main point
kings,3cn7et,cmeng,2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Ray doesnt have any hard feelings toward the Kings. He is on he Spurs now. Kings did him a major favor. By next year, if they re-sign him, he could be a big part of the rotation. Congrats, Ray!"
kings,3cn7et,FatBitchExclusive,2,Thu Jul 9 09:44:04 2015 UTC,Damn... I liked Ray. I still think he can be a good backup / 6th man in this league. Plus I kill with him in 2k. Damn.
kings,3cn7et,FatBitchExclusive,4,Thu Jul 9 18:34:57 2015 UTC,Hopefully we can trade Moreland for a 4th round pick

kings,3cns48,Rockdrigo221,9,Thu Jul 9 09:59:00 2015 UTC,He got Boogie in college from Rod Strickland cause he would do guard moves and the coach would say you got a lot of boogie for a big man and always called him that so it stuck through to the NBA.  Hard to get a NBA nickname when you already had a college one.
kings,3cns48,WOL6ANG,5,Thu Jul 9 15:43:02 2015 UTC,"See: O.J. ""Grocery List"" Mayo"
kings,3cns48,Purplegill10,5,Thu Jul 9 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"It wouldnt make sense for a nickname since Run DMC already exist. When Tyreke Evans was still here, they were known as Reke DMC."
kings,3cns48,kingsin4,2,Thu Jul 9 10:06:40 2015 UTC,Boogie was given to him in college by coach Rod Strickland because of the way he handled the ball like a guard.
kings,3cns48,randomstormtrooper,-6,Thu Jul 9 15:43:52 2015 UTC,Because running is not what Cousins does... More like mosey down the court pouting at ref-DMC  Edit: It's a joke...  Jeez

kings,3cn6vc,Sonitis22,10,Thu Jul 9 05:19:22 2015 UTC,Decent defense.  Takes care of the ball.  Can get to the rack.  Not really great at any one thing though.
kings,3cn6vc,KingSwisher,7,Thu Jul 9 05:22:31 2015 UTC,Noooo. Not Ray Mac. Led the kings summer league team to a championship. Coaches son. Four year college player. Will be great in spurs system. You guys got a good piece. Hopefully this means we are looking to sign someone else to fill a roster spot.
kings,3cn6vc,nuts_in_a_ladder,6,Thu Jul 9 05:22:17 2015 UTC,You're here before anyone in this subredddit even broke the news. Well he's amazing. Very humble guy and gives 110%. He's not a starter but he does produce his numbers and isn't a bad pick up.
kings,3cn6vc,atransformerr,7,Thu Jul 9 05:22:50 2015 UTC,"He's very consistent and is hard nosed player with a good knowledge of the game. He's the type of guy that is good at almost everything, but not really ""great"" at anything. Sad to see him go, but he should fit really nicely on the Spurs. Pop will probably love him."
kings,3cn6vc,ReggieEvansTheKing,5,Thu Jul 9 05:23:24 2015 UTC,"Very smart player. Doesn't excel in any one aspect of the game, but is very well rounded. I'll miss him, but I don't mind trading him. He'll be great in the Spurs system"
kings,3cn6vc,4everpurple,4,Thu Jul 9 05:26:25 2015 UTC,Gonna be a good back up point guard for you guys.  Glad we traded him.  He has a ton of potential that would be wasted here at this point.
kings,3cn6vc,yopeee,3,Thu Jul 9 05:28:12 2015 UTC,"Solid player. Exceptional work ethic. Got better with more playing time. Probably has a relatively low ceiling, but he'll work his ass off and play within himself.   Solid bench player and good locker-room guy. We loved him here, so take care of him."
kings,3cn6vc,hipnerd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:38:31 2015 UTC,"solid player, all-around. Not a ""passing"" PG but more of a scorer, and plays average defense - not great but not bad. Yall will love him"
kings,3cn6vc,Ethanhekker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:46:51 2015 UTC,"You guys got a steal on this one.  I wish we had kept him for selfish reasons, but I'm happy for him.  He seems like a good dude, and the type of player that will flourish in a system like the Spurs'.  I wish him luck."

kings,3cl90i,Narwhail0r,35,Wed Jul 8 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it worked out better in the end. A blessing in disguise sort of. I really wanted Matthews. But now thinking about it, $16M a year for a guy coming off an achilles injury. It's a huge risk. A career ending risk for Vlade or one that will haunt him for years.   Seeing how our Free Agency unfolded, I'm glad he rejected us. Last year starting line up was rank Top 5. This year with hopefully an improved BMac, addition of Rondo, and interior D from KK and Willie will make our starting line up even better. Our bench last year was the real problem and we address that by having Collison, Belinelli, Casspi, KK or Willie. That's a solid bench."
kings,3cl90i,kingsin4,10,Wed Jul 8 20:06:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, in my mind that ship has sailed. Despite everything that's happened, I'm really happy with the squad Vlade has assembled this offseason. I think we have a team that will be competitive, and will move the franchise in the right direction going forward. And maybe when contract time comes for DMC in a few seasons, we'll be a contender that he wants to stay with. If we have a solid season, dare I say possibly sneak into the playoffs, Vlade will look like a genius. And all the shit sports media has talked about us will old news."
kings,3cl90i,penis_showing_game,8,Wed Jul 8 20:04:59 2015 UTC,If we had signed Wes. We would have probably gotten Rondo and Omri with our exception. Personally getting Beli and Koufos in the roster has probably put a step forward into healing Cousins and Karl's relationship. Cousins can play the 4 like he's always wanted and Karl gets his guy from the Denver days. I would rather have that than having to worry about both Rondo and Matthews achilles this coming season.
kings,3cl90i,WOL6ANG,6,Wed Jul 8 20:07:54 2015 UTC,For a franchise that isn't supposed to draw FA's attention Vlade did an incredible job his first offseason. So far at least.

Instead, he spends most games sitting courtside with his family while sporting a cool light jacket.   One particular game late in the season, he's there enjoying the game, but it comes down to the final nine seconds and the Kings are down by two. Coach Karl calls a time out. Vivek and Vlade Nod at each other. Then, they nod at Peja. Peja then rips off the light jacket to reveal a Kings jersey. Coach Karl subs out somebody and Peja steps onto the court. He jogs over to the team huddle and nods when Coach speaks. Some back-pats and high-fives are exchanged. He didn't understand what was said, though. He doesn't speak English. It's okay. Peja Stojakovic gets paid to do one thing.  We're back in the game. 9 seconds. Rondo tosses in the ball over to Cousins. 8 seconds. Cousins begins to post up nicely. 7 seconds. Big Cuz sees Peja about to make a cut to the other side of the arc. 6 seconds. Cousins makes a behind-the-back pass back to Rondo at the top of the arc. 5 seconds. Rondo very quickly seems to begin to drive and starts to outrun his defender, also drawing the foolish defender who was trying to catch up with Peja who is running to the corner of the arc. 4 seconds. Rondo takes one more step towards the hoop and the big man in the key who would have likely blocked him. He then makes a smooth assist over to Peja. 3 seconds. Peja looks over to Coach Karl, shrugs, then smirks. He jumps and releases the shot. 2 seconds. It's a beautiful arc and it goes right in. 1 second. The opposing team isn't going to waste everyone's time with a time out just for a one-second hail-mary three pointer. Time is up. The Kings win.  For increased enjoyment of this story, assume the opposing team = Lakers. For further increased enjoyment of this story, assume Casspi and Cousins shared a headband-adjusting moment during the timeout."

NO fans should have their team taken away unjustly like this.   If Seattle wanted a team so badly they should have kept theirs while they had a chance or try and push harder for an expansion rather than take teams away from other cities. It just doesn't feel right no matter who it is."

My point was that despite how gross some Sonics fans are being now, Seattle didn't deserve to have it's team taken the way it did anymore than we or Milwaukee does.

And plus, did we really sign Kostas Koufos to that big deal to be Boogie's backup? I think Koufos starts alongside Cousins. If you bring in Smith it really cuts down on Koufos' role and I'm not sure it's that much of a net gain.  Plus, do we even have the money for Smith? Seems like he can get more than the 2.8 room exception elsewhere.  I think a role player, and not a former star like Smith, is more appropriate. Someone who can fill the 8th or 9th spot in the rotation. That's why I'd like Jason Smith or Andrea Bargnani.  I know the suggestion of Bargnani probably elicits some laughs but  he could be a great fit on the second unit next to an ace defensive C like WCS."
kings,3cdp8f,matty25,5,Tue Jul 7 20:17:53 2015 UTC,Yes..  We did sign him to play backup.  He is a stellar backup.  Depth is what we need.  Who says Smith has to start?
kings,3cdp8f,The_Sacramento_Kings,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"You think if the season started today Koufos would be a backup? I'm not convinced.  And I suppose Smith doesn't have to start but asking him to take a huge paycut and come of the bench is asking a lot of him.  Also, say we do sign Smith...then what? Who is going to ride pine? We paid big bucks for Koufos and used a high draft pick on WCS, and have the best big man in the game in Cousins. Someone's minutes are getting squeezed and it isn't Cousins. Doesn't really make sense to sit Koufos or WCS a lot either."
kings,3cdp8f,oh_peaches,2,Tue Jul 7 20:55:45 2015 UTC,Why would he take a pay cut...  He isn't gonna get over what he's set to receive from Detroit.  He's gonna sign for no more than 3 mil somewhere.   No we didn't sign Koufos to play bench on this roster.  We signed him with anticipation of Smith.   We are lacking at the 4 and Cousins can play 4.  Smith is a stretch 4. All depends on rotation.
kings,3cdp8f,Bocheetus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:01:50 2015 UTC,"Oh so whatever salary Smith signs for isn't in addition to what he is making in Detroit? Well it makes more sense then.  But still, Cousins, Rondo, Karl and Smith? That's a lot of mercurial personalities. I think a guy who is used to be a role player off the bench might be better suited rather than adding another player who is used to the spotlight.  But hey, if I'm wrong and they do sign him I hope it works out."
kings,3cdp8f,SizzleOh7,4,Tue Jul 7 21:05:32 2015 UTC,"From what I read the plan is to MLE Smith for 2.8. If we get that,  we receive a great deal while Smith still receives I think it was 10 mil all together. Smith, Rondo, Gay and Cousins are all friends. That win at all costs attitude may be good. We never know.  Josh smith seems to have calmed down a bit.    The power of what being an underdog can do alot of a team. Every person has something to prove from name cleaning to all star nodding. 2.8 mil for a 12-8 pf is good money spent."

kings,3ccnej,I_Is_Batman,3,Tue Jul 7 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"Well, rumors have us speaking to Josh Smith and Ryan Hollins. I personally think we need another shooter. None of our bigs can really shoot from the outside (though Boogie is solid out to about 20 ft), and when Rondo is your PG, you need as much spacing as you can get."
kings,3ccnej,uptoolate712,7,Tue Jul 7 04:54:53 2015 UTC,"I really hope you guys get smith, you'll be surprised as to how much he'll help. The rockets wouldn't have won game 6 without him.   Plus as a celtic fan, I've always wanted rondo and smith to team up; might not sound as pleasant as it did 5 years ago, but maybe it could work."
kings,3ccnej,I_Is_Batman,2,Tue Jul 7 04:57:08 2015 UTC,I don't even mind if they teamed up with a different team. I would finally love to see Rondo and Smith play together like they've always wanted to.
kings,3ccnej,Narwhail0r,2,Tue Jul 7 07:20:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We need a 4 that can shoot.  I wouldn't mind Jason Smith or Andrea Bargnani. I know Bargnani has the reputation that he does, but for an 8th or 9th man at the 2.8M room exception he wouldn't be bad."

kings,3ceac3,IAmRedeemed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"I meant, what's the point in drafting players that are not able to play right away? Why waste a pick on players that are 2-3 years away? Also I did not know he was picked that late, thought he went earlier in the 2nd."
kings,3ceac3,I_Is_Batman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:50:26 2015 UTC,"You can get them at a buy-low price this way. If you wait to draft the rights to a Euro once they're a relatively develoed and proven commodity, it's gonna cost you a first rounder. Dibs them early on a flier and maybe you'll be rewarded with a real player in a year or two."
kings,3ceac3,oh_peaches,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"Because 2nd Round picks have unguaranteed contracts.

kings,3cc3pk,GentleGenitalia,5,Mon Jul 6 19:36:41 2015 UTC,"I was there for that. I felt like I knew it was going to happen the whole time- I knew the Kings were better, I knew it was going to come down to it, and I fully believed that whoever took the shot would make it. Was also there a few years later when Kevin Martin made the game-winning buzzer-beating layup over Tim Duncan in Game 3 of that series... I threw my soda into the air and screamed until everything turned red and I fell into my seat. Caught my breath, stood up and screamed some more. Arco at its best is a mad-house unequaled by any other venue in any other sport."
kings,3cc3pk,NightWriter500,4,Mon Jul 6 19:48:12 2015 UTC,Came here to say this. I'll never forget how loud the crowd was after he hit that shot. It absolutely convinced me that Arco was the loudest arena in the league at that time.

kings,3cc3pk,urbsindomita,9,Mon Jul 6 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite memories:   I grew up in Texas, so my first ""Kings game"" was actually a preseason matchup against the Mavericks, probably in 2002 or 2003.  The Kings ended up losing, but it was a lot of fun actually seeing my heroes in person.  My first real Kings game came when I moved out here in 2008.  I can't remember who we played, but I remember that Kevin Martin went to the free throw line about 2,000 times that game.  I loved every second of actually seeing the Kings in Arco.   One of my favorite games was ""Tyreke Evans"" night.  There was a big push to get him some attention for rookie of the year, and the coach just let him get stats.  When he finally got his triple-double, the crowd went wild. I was at one of the games where I fan hit the half-court shot for a car.  Honestly that was the craziest moment I can remember.  Arco went absolutely bananas.   As /u/KF43 mentioned, the home opener of 2012-2013 was an amazing experience.  From the big red carpet before the game to the endless chants during the game, that night was truly awesome.     And my most enduring memory from a Kings game:   The last home game of 2011.  At that time it really felt like it was probably the last game in Sacramento.  I remember that after the buzzer went off, nobody really left.  A lot of people were tearing up (myself included), and everyone just chanted ""Sacramento!"" or just cheered on the Kings.  That moment really made me realize how important the Kings are to me.  Now when people talk shit about the Kings, I just remember that it'll never feel lower than that point, and our position is a million times better than the alternative we had."

I also saw Tyreke hit the half-court game-winner over the Grizzlies a few years back. Both were exciting for different reasons - the first was great because the Kings were in their glory days taking care of business as usual; the second was great because seeing a buzzer-beater live is just insane!

kings,3cc3pk,ScabbyLasagna,3,Mon Jul 6 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"I've only been to one NBA game due to moving around and not really having the money to get tickets at the other places I moved to. The game I went to was in 2004 against the Timberwolves when we lost by 11 points. The game wasn't really anything special and I was in the nosebleeds watching with binoculars, so I really couldn't tell much about what was going on.   I was ecstatic, though, to get to watch KG play since he was my favorite individual player at the time. I spent most of the game trying to figure out where he was and I was just left in awe of what all the players could do. Even from where I was, I felt like I was watching real-life superheroes. I had just got done meeting Bibby by chance in Old Sac some time earlier (different day) so I had him to kind of establish a perspective and I knew that even he was a huge mass of muscle, so watching these guys move faster than I thought was possible doing these precise movements just blew my mind.  The other experience I remember is constantly feeling like I was going to fall to my death because of how steep the seats were. I didn't move that entire game, thinking some fan would push me from behind while we were cheering. Shit was scary."

I stood up as soon as he got the ball and started booing as loud as I could right next to my cousin who is a lakers fan who took me to the game. The whole stadium joined me in unison as if it was just instinct as a Kings fan and Arco starting echoing with the loudest boo I've ever heard in person! He ended up missing that shot! I also remember Caron Butler slamming a nasty one handed dunk down while being fouled very hard and being sent to the floor. Even us Kings fans gasped at it!

Once we managed to sit behind the players and said Hi to Bobby the night of his accident. We did that for a few years until marriage and family caught up and we didn't have the time or money to do that anymore. A lot of years later, we managed to squeeze in a game in 2013 that ended up being one of Tyreke's last games as a King. We were up in the same nosebleed seats, older and we could have afforded better seats but we liked sitting up there, surrounded by empty seats. We spent the whole time chatting and catching up and we barely watched the game. Last year right before the season started my little brother passed away at 39.  There's a lot of memories I have with him (his favorite player was always Big Nasty and mine was the Wizard) but that last game we attended where we sat by ourselves just catching up is what I will always remember."

kings,3cdg3k,4everpurple,2,Tue Jul 7 02:00:58 2015 UTC,How good of a shooter is he?
kings,3cdg3k,IAmRedeemed,2,Tue Jul 7 02:51:43 2015 UTC,He's a pretty good mid range/outside shooter but not consistent from 3.  He's a career 34.3% from 3 (aka over 2 years).  Just good enough not to hurt you but nothing special.  He's the definition of a good end of bench player.  He had a .536 TS% last year with low usage. But most of his shots weren't in the paint.  http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hummero01.html?mobile=false

kings,3ccqk3,IAmRedeemed,5,Mon Jul 6 22:06:18 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bring him back. We already have 3 centers. I'd much rather another shooter.
kings,3ccqk3,uptoolate712,4,Tue Jul 7 00:37:09 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind him coming back. But if he leaves it won't bother me.
kings,3ccqk3,Tactial_snail,6,Mon Jul 6 22:59:45 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be bad to bring him back for big man depth. I'd rather see Josh Smith if we can get him for the 2.8M exception or whatever it is we can offer.
kings,3ccqk3,foxmtbr,8,Mon Jul 6 22:17:27 2015 UTC,He wasn't that bad in the PT he got here. Great locker room presence and always cheering on the bench. I wouldn't mind a vet minimum if Smith doesn't work out.

kings,3cd31s,DoTheLaLaLaLaLa,19,Mon Jul 6 23:42:22 2015 UTC,"I guess you can say he is a homeless mans Josh Smith.  Really athletic, isn't a great 3PT shooter but still takes those. He is horrendous on defense, I don't think Smith is.  Nik Stauskas had more blocks than Derrick Williams last season.  Just expect highlight dunks, and everything else that comes along is a bonus."
kings,3cd31s,IAmRedeemed,3,Mon Jul 6 23:50:40 2015 UTC,Are there any attitude issues? If not then would you suggest he's coachable or is he always going to be a shoot/score first guy?
kings,3cd31s,YusoStoopid,12,Mon Jul 6 23:56:57 2015 UTC,"In that regard he's Supercool Beas lite. He's coachable, but can play brainlessly."
kings,3cd31s,4everpurple,2,Tue Jul 7 00:01:07 2015 UTC,"Well, he's still fairly young so I guess he can still develop. He would be a bench guy anyway. I was just iffy on the 10/2 contract. I suppose the short contract is to see how much he could be coached. Thank you for your comments."
kings,3cd31s,IAmRedeemed,0,Tue Jul 7 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"Enough with these ""blocks= good defense"" arguments. Not saying he is a good defender, because he isn't really, but don't act like being able to block shots at a wing position makes you a good defender. It's obviously different for post players, but for wings, I don't really care if a guard/small forward can block shots."
kings,3cd31s,KF43,10,Tue Jul 7 02:05:12 2015 UTC,I am not saying Stauskas has good defense or that blocks are good defense.  It was just a surprising fact.  A rookie SG has more blocks than an experienced SF/PF.
kings,3cd31s,ChandyCommentaries,6,Tue Jul 7 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Like /u/IAmRedeemed said, he is very athletic and will give you showtime dunks. He is pretty solid at driving in and getting to the rim. His shooting is either off or on, very streaky. On defense you aren't going to get that much from him. Overall, he is a very fun player to watch if your team isn't trying to make a playoff run. He's a cool dude and nice to fans. I have nothing bad to say about his character. You'll enjoy your time with him."
kings,3cd31s,EddieScott,3,Tue Jul 7 01:10:35 2015 UTC,"He loves fast pace ball. Back in his AZ days he developed a mini jump shot but haven't improved since then. He hesistates on many of his jumpers (which I believe he can develop), atheletic wise it's all there. I believe he can be a good F going in, a bust for a pick but can develop fairly well as a player."
kings,3cd31s,NightWriter500,2,Tue Jul 7 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"Somebody tweeted (I don't remember who, or I'd give credit) that he has games where he convinces you he can be a star small forward in this league. And then there are the other 79 games."

kings,3cctkz,KF43,10,Mon Jul 6 22:36:35 2015 UTC,Yeah especially since both Collison and Rondo are coming off injuries he's a good back up to have. Also hes really cheap so id say keep him unless we can get another PG in a good trade
kings,3cctkz,Arrdurr,3,Mon Jul 6 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"I get the impression based on some of his offseason comments that Karl doesn't like Ray. I'm sure if there is a decent trade opportunity, we'll take it."

My WCF prediction are you guys and the Spurs. I can't imagine how pissed Westbrook is going to be and I know Durant is gonna come back healthy and ball out of his fucking mind. Hopefully you guys stay healthy next season and make alot of damage to remind everyone you guys still exist."

kings,3c9aqi,gohstrifle,3,Mon Jul 6 02:34:56 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we can only offer the room exception at $2.8M to Smith
kings,3c9aqi,truwarier14,2,Mon Jul 6 02:50:23 2015 UTC,Why is that?
kings,3c9aqi,IMDATBOY,2,Mon Jul 6 03:02:16 2015 UTC,We basically forfeit the MLE when we make a salary dump
kings,3c9aqi,truwarier14,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:03:12 2015 UTC,Hmm I don't get that. I thought the MLEs value was dependent only on whether a team has cap room and if they're below the luxury tax?
kings,3c9aqi,IMDATBOY,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"Right, but apparently we can't free up cap space, sign free agents to the cap and then use the MLE.  You can follow THIS thread and the thread linked in the comment. I was confused too. Still kind of am, but apparently that's how it is."
kings,3c9aqi,truwarier14,2,Mon Jul 6 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"That still says that it only applies if the sum applied after the MLE is over the cap, then we would get the MLE. If we use the MLE now, we would be over the cap, so we still have access to the MLE at 5m.  Edit: Remember that none of these contracts apply until July 9th, so a sign and trade doesn't make a difference when all these contracts take effect at the same time."
kings,3c9aqi,guy15s,2,Mon Jul 6 03:38:55 2015 UTC,I'm still super confused and I'm not trying to be ass sorry. But our active contracts as of right now nets to $39M. If you add in all of the exceptions we would still be well below the cap thus forfeiting our MLE.
kings,3c9aqi,Narwhail0r,2,Mon Jul 6 05:53:26 2015 UTC,"But the thing is that the MLE doesn't take effect until all the other contracts take effect as well, so there still isn't anything in the posted rules that specifically answers this question. It might go either way, but I don't think any of the posted rules directly states that we don't get access to our MLE. The important piece of information is when July 9th hits, if our new contracts that we have signed apply to the cap at the same time as the MLE is allowed, which I think is the case, then the MLE can apply if the MLE, itself, plus the new contracts we signed can be what puts us over the cap to allow the MLE exception.  Think of it this way. If we use the MLE exception to sign Josh Smith, we won't technically use it until July 9th, which will be when the MLE plus all of our other newly acquired contracts apply to the cap. The rules don't state, either way, that this is or is not the case, but if the MLE can apply to the cap to allow the existence of the MLE, then it stands to reason that other contracts coming into effect at the same time as the MLE can also apply to the cap for the MLE to take effect. Nothing in the rules posted seems to directly address this fact, instead applying to other loopholes which we have already satisfied."
kings,3c9aqi,guy15s,2,Mon Jul 6 05:59:27 2015 UTC,So basically we don't know if the MLE starts before July 9th or after. Okay I get what you mean about how vague the MLE is. So if the MLE starts before July 9th we're screwed if it takes place when the contracts are executed then we're good to go?
kings,3c9aqi,Narwhail0r,2,Mon Jul 6 06:02:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, learned a lot"
kings,3c9aqi,IMDATBOY,2,Mon Jul 6 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"He's still owed his original salary from Detroit though, maybe he feels anything else he earns is just house money"

kings,3c9aqi,truwarier14,2,Mon Jul 6 03:28:02 2015 UTC,No one has his bird rights and I don't think anyone wants to give him a payday so the Gay factor could work out
kings,3c9aqi,whyte_ryce,2,Mon Jul 6 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"The 2.8m is just a rumor at this point. The rules are not clear on this point. None of these contracts hold until July 9th, including the MLE, so if the MLE applies towards the cap to allow the MLE, it would stand to reason that other contracts applying at the same time would also count towards the cap that allows the MLE. As far as we know, this is all based on a bunch of redditors interpreting contract and salary cap rules."

kings,3c9aqi,bruwinning,10,Mon Jul 6 02:48:40 2015 UTC,DWill is a bust at least we get a pretty solid defender in Smith (if we get him).
kings,3c9aqi,truwarier14,5,Mon Jul 6 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"And Josh is a much better passer, ball handler, rebounder and even scorer. Just not as good of a shooter."

kings,3c9aqi,foxmtbr,2,Mon Jul 6 03:40:53 2015 UTC,Josh smith had all star potential in Atlanta. He is was a killer perimeter defender and a stretch  4. He even showed signs of his old form and improved shooting in the playoffs.  Dwill is a poor man's Gerald Wallace.

kings,3c94z1,Narwhail0r,2,Mon Jul 6 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"This really isn't clear at all. I wouldn't start spreading this rumor until we know. The rules are very vague on this point and no contracts including the MLE are signed until July 9th. I would think that if this were true, we would be hearing more about it than from anonymous commenters on Reddit."
kings,3c94z1,guy15s,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm 99.9% sure we don't get our MLE because we had too much room under the cap. It's specifically designed to keep a team from getting a ton of room to sign free agents and then also use the MLE.  Start here, and read all of question 26: http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm"
kings,3c94z1,KyleBown,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:02:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think that directly applies to our situation. That is talking about using the MLE to avoid being over the cap because it doesn't apply to the cap in respect to signing free agents. The loophole that they mention basically refers to this: if I sign somebody with an MLE and it does not apply to the cap in any way then I can also sign a free agent normally while ignoring the impact from the MLE exception.  But since the MLE exception does apply to the cap in respect to acquiring free agents, it does count towards being able to acquire more free agents if I use the MLE to acquire free agents past the cap when the MLE puts me over the cap.  So what this rule is really doing is just defining how the MLE can apply to itself in order to make the MLE usable when the MLE is the free agent contract that puts you over the cap. I think this is more about how to resolve Bird rights (for example) coexisting with the MLE than it has anything to do with our current situation. Otherwise, any rule that allows going over the cap to sign a free agent would come into conflict with the MLE and would allow ""double-dipping"" with various salary cap exceptions."
kings,3c94z1,guy15s,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:17:24 2015 UTC,"Basically it would only matter if the MLE executes before the moratorium or after. Technically right now we don't have MLE because we are way below cap. But also we technically didn't officially sign any FA yet. Trust me, I was definitely on your side before he won me over lol. The rules on when MLE can be used are pretty vague on that website. Ignore all of that. We don't have MLE. MLE starts at the beginning of the free agency."

kings,3cbpga,mjziegler33,14,Mon Jul 6 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"""I'd play Mclemore at the 3""   Yea..  Let's not. I say this time and time again. Kings have one of the worst development staffs in the league. Everyone always asks ""why you trade X, look at him now"". Truth is,  until we change things we can't create those players.  Whiteside would not have panned out here just like Lin didn't in Goldenstate.  Stauskas may be Jimmer... May be Ray Allen.  Idk but personally,  he has something in common with Jimmer and that was he was apart of a team that wasn't meant for him. Good luck.   People need to stop trashing the trade. Kings need endorsements for the new arena and they need to sell tickets.  I renewed but I know a few people who didn't after last season. This was a revitalized trade which has given us real hope and I haven't had that in years. (I'm delusional...  I believe we will win the championship every year.)  Personally, I don't feel we need these posts here but you are always allowed to post. Understand that the general consensus of the City,  not just fans,  liked the trade."
kings,3cbpga,yopeee,8,Mon Jul 6 18:33:04 2015 UTC,Stauskas had no confidence and is more then likely going to end up like Jimmer or be lucky enough to be like JJ Reddick. Since leaving Sacramento he has been totally overrated even though the national media shit on the pick last year when we made it. We are a better team because of this trade and taking the risk was necessary. 76ers aren't getting the right to swap picks either so don't worry.
kings,3cbpga,Knowaa,7,Mon Jul 6 18:10:26 2015 UTC,I don't think Stauskas is going to be a bust. He's just one of those players where it's going to take longer for him to develop.
kings,3cbpga,Narwhail0r,7,Mon Jul 6 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"I still thought we have up too much. Vlade recovered by filling out the bench nicely but at great cost.  But he's under mandate to be competitive when the new arena opens and they probably need to try and improve now in order to keep Cousins happy. Under those guidelines then improved bench now is worth more than pick swaps, a future first, and waiting on Stauskas"
kings,3cbpga,whyte_ryce,20,Mon Jul 6 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Plus, when we become playoff contenders for the next few years while Philly stays in rebuilding/lottery mode... Those pick swaps will be useless. And so what if we end up losing the 29th pick of the draft?    I'm a big homer."
kings,3cbpga,JamesBearded,9,Mon Jul 6 18:10:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. No one really understands the climate and current situation of the Kings. People see the trade and assume BAM we're stupid for pulling the trigger on it. But in the situation we're in I honestly think we had no choice.
kings,3cbpga,Narwhail0r,8,Mon Jul 6 18:28:08 2015 UTC,"Mozgov, Hardaway Jr, Vasquez: all guys who were moved for a late-first round pick.

kings,3cbpga,thepufferfish,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:22:32 2015 UTC,I love that everyone thinks that Stauskas is a promising young talent AFTER we trade him away. Before the trade he was just another kings bust.

Since they are not necessarily my favorite team, I feel I can unbiasedly review their trade, as I do in article here.  What I am curious about though, is if many people feel the Kings came out alright in the trade, or if the opinion that they gave up too much is universal.  Let me know any thoughts (even if it is telling me I am way off) here or on the sportsblog page.  Good luck Kings!  At the very least, it's a very fun roster!"
kings,3cbpga,Holy_Crapkin,15,Mon Jul 6 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"Given the end result, I'd say the majority of us are in favor of the trade. From the article, it sounds like they see Thompson and Landry as irrelevant and it's more about losing Stauskas. If that's true, then we gave up Stauskas to help sign multiple proven players that can help us next season immediately. I think that's worth the risk.  What makes me more upset is the view of the Kings management regarding Stauskas. First the article bashes us for drafting him in the first place, saying this is the worst place for him to be considering we signed McLemore. Then they bash us again for ""giving up on him"" too fast. I mean, which is it? Seems like no matter what direction we go, it'll be viewed as the ""wrong"" one."
kings,3cbpga,Narwhail0r,6,Mon Jul 6 17:56:14 2015 UTC,As far as the Kings fans on this sub and the city we're generally happy with the trade because of the return. I think you're selling Kosta short though. He was arguably one of the best back up centers last season. Not to mention he played for George Karl. George is going to know how to use this guy. As far as the Stauskas thing..I personally don't think we gave up on him too early per se. We traded him because we needed a good shooter now. I'm still one of the few believers that think he will be good some day he's just the type of player that takes awhile to develop.
kings,3cbpga,NightWriter500,6,Mon Jul 6 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you've come to the wrong place if you're hoping to get a bunch of people hating the trade. That circlejerk is at r/NBA or in the national media. The majority of people here give the nod of approval to that trade, and since we know/follow the Kings more than most others, the piling-on of outsider hate is pretty irrelevant to us.  At the start of the offseason, I literally told a friend ""If only we could unload JT or Landry, we could get in some good pieces here."" Glade went out and unloaded them both, and that was nothing short of amazing. Neither of those guys really fit what we're doing here. Basically trading Stauskas, who could work out somewhere but is by no means a guarantee, for two guaranteed players we actually need in a sharpshooter and backup big, was an amazing trade."
kings,3cbpga,NightWriter500,4,Mon Jul 6 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"This was kind of the reaction I was hoping to see (maybe minus all the downvotes, but I can understand your fanbase is probably pretty tired of outsiders kicking around insults!).  Sometimes those outside of a market can get caught up in the mainstream opinion.  While I do stand by all my thoughts in the article, I am also interested in seeing what those closer to the team think.  For example, when the Bulls (my #1) fired Thibs, most people piled on what an awful FO they have.  But those closer to the team thought it was a necessary move (similar to how this is being received by loyal fans).  So thanks everyone for the responses, all have been very thorough and educated, and I appreciate the perspective!"
kings,3cbpga,The-Hot-Tamale,3,Mon Jul 6 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you have to look at it from our perspective. A couple weeks ago someone claimed Kings were shopping Cousins and it was a downpour of people coming in saying ""Would you take the #8 pick for Cousins?"" or ""What do you think about a Cousins-for-Scallabrini trade straight up?"" It was infuriating, because it was all based on bullshit. Then there was the draft, and everyone was happy, except people kept pouring in ""Now that they've drafted a replacement for Cousins, would you take Nick Young and an old ham sandwich with wilted lettuce for Boogie?"" Infuriating. Then the trade went through, a trade I'd only dreamed was possible, and while most here loved it as the only way to move forward, again you had people pouring in- ""Wow you guys got fleeced, why is management so terrible?! Feels!!"" Meanwhile people here are literally calling Vlade the Vladfather. He goes out and makes amazing signings, all while awful national media writers are posting completely false reports the whole while, and it feels like us against the world. Our team is sio much better than last year, every hole has been plugged, and the team itself seems to jel already- and still the media wants to circlejerk themselves using their own proven bullshit reports as proof that it's toxic around here. But it's not. It's the media that's toxic. So yeah, if/when this team starts winning and the media wants to jump on the bandwagon, they can go fuck themselves. I'm keeping note of exactly who in the media are dead to me."
kings,3cbpga,BillLordZero,3,Mon Jul 6 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"If they want to keep DMC this was the last season to prove to him that it's worth staying, so changes had to be made. Without this trade, they go into the season as largely the same team as last year, the Boogie trade rumors continue, and another losing season follows. That certainly doesn't inspire confidence for him to stay and it doesn't entice free agents to come next year when we will have to bid against the entire league. So obviously changes had to be made.  Is this trade perfect? No. Are the players we signed a gamble? Yes. Even if they improve enough to obtain a decent record, then that coupled with Boogie, Rudy and a new arena could be enough to sway a better player next year.   I consider the pick swap this year would be highly unlikely to happen. Next year I'm sure wil be more likely but I can't imagine it will even be a top 10 pick. The 2018 pick could be big since it could be the first year without DMC, but the odds of it being a player even as good as him are very low.   Bottom line is that I would happily trade away a decent rookie and a pick in a crap shoot draft for the ability to improve immediately and a much higher chance of retaining DMC"

But have we not learned to not turn our nose up here and get talent whichever way we can?  Ending FAency with a Casspi and Smith signging would make this offseason a HUGE success.
kings,3c80t5,jimbrope,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:11:22 2015 UTC,"Again, everyone on this sub seriously is blinded by the big name players and forget how terribly they've played the last few seasons. Smith has been almost historically bad for the pistons and didn't improve that much on Houston. Look up his stats, he was still a terrible shooter when he left the Pistons.  If we have him we'll be screaming at our TV's all season when he pulls up for a shitty 3 pointer and bricks it.  I've watched a lot of basketball and have seen him go from a perennial all-star to absolute shit. If he can play the 4 the way he did in ATL it would be very nice signing, if he wants to play the 3 like DET then it'll be a disaster. Clearly no one agrees since I've been downvoted to the negatives but no one really watched him play, obviously. He basically shot 40/30/50 last season, look it up."
kings,3c80t5,ItsNotSpaghetti,3,Mon Jul 6 03:53:53 2015 UTC,"Meh you could say the same thing about Chris Webber, Rudy Gay, Cousins  We've taken chances on guys with terrible reps (you kind of have to if you are a small market bad team) and its actually worked out pretty well for us.  At like 5m a year that is a risk worth taking imo"
kings,3c80t5,jimbrope,2,Mon Jul 6 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about stats wise, I like the comparison of Rudy and Josh because Rudy was shooting TERRIBLY for Toronto and we took a major chance picking him up. He turned his game around, but still has his crappy shooting games.  One thing I'm worried about is that Smith went to 2 different teams and played bad, better on Houston but still bad overall. Yes a 1 year deal is low risk, but we could not sign him and run with the squad we have and maybe sign an undrafted rook who is much younger and cheaper and could, just maybe, turn into a solid player. We already know what Smith brings to the table so i just don't see why we can't look elsewhere.  Also, just cuz we have the space to sign the guy doesn't mean we should."

kings,3c8efi,truwarier14,2,Sun Jul 5 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"I fail to see how that excerpt he put out says anything about us waving our MLE in order to get what we got over free agency. It just says exactly what we've been stating, that if the MLE is the signing that puts you over the cap, it still allows access to the 5m MLE because the MLE still applies to the cap. The ""exception"" part is that it is an exception when you normally can't sign players outside of your team when you are over the cap."
kings,3c8efi,truwarier14,2,Sun Jul 5 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"Ye, I was confused too. Maybe we would have to sign Casspi just below the cap limit so then we can use MLE on Smith?"
kings,3c8efi,KyleBown,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:15:51 2015 UTC,Lol dude that was the comment I was referring to in this post. I thought the consensus was we have to sign Casspi with our remaining space in order for us to use the MLE. Then he said some shit and it just scrambled my brain.

kings,3c8efi,KyleBown,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:21:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, I finally get it now. Basically, if your salary is so far below the cap that adding in the exceptions and other things to that total is still below the cap, you don't get those exceptions. Check here: http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q26 Question 26.  The relevant example:   For example, assume there is a $58 million salary cap, and during the offseason a team has $50 million committed to salaries, along with a Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception for $5 million, a trade exception for $2.5 million, and an unrenounced free agent whose free agent amount is $2 million. Their salaries and exceptions total $59.5 million, or $1.5 million over the cap. What if their free agent signs with another team? The $2 million free agent amount comes off their cap, so their team salary (including their remaining exceptions) drops to $57.5 million. This total is below the cap so the team loses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level and trade exceptions."
kings,3c8efi,truwarier14,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:04:01 2015 UTC,"So, if I understand it correctly we just need to be at or above the cap and can then use the MLE?"
kings,3c8efi,guy15s,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"No. The MLE is an exception. It's to be used if you don't have room to sign free agents. I believe, that because we were below the salary cap if you add in our MLE, trade exceptions, etc, we don't get the MLE at all. Just the room exception.  Another part of Question 26:   A team's exceptions may be lost entirely, or the team may never receive them to begin with. This happens when their team salary is so low that when the exceptions are added to the team salary, the sum is still below the salary cap. If this happens when the exceptions arise, then the team doesn't get their exceptions at all. If the team salary ever drops below this level during the year, then any unused portions of their exceptions are lost (and do not return if the team salary increases)."
kings,3c8efi,webbersknee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:13:29 2015 UTC,So at what point did we lose our MLE? Can it only be used during the season and not when we do a salary dump to sign FAs?
kings,3c8efi,Greekzzlies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's the plan. Technically, we don't even have to do that. We're already within 5m of the cap so the MLE should be open to us now. We're probably just fine-tuning contracts now while the players try to get as much as they can out of our tight space."
kings,3c8efi,IAmRedeemed,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"You can't actually sign a player and then use the MLE to go over the cap.  Essentially, by putting the team far enough under the cap that they would be allowed to sign a free agent, they would lose the rights to the exception and have to use the smaller room exception. (http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q26)  I'm curious whether there would be a way to pull a 3-way trade to maneuver in such a way as to never get that far below the cap (remember that we have a 7.2M trade exception from IT).  For instance it might look something like:  Trade 1:  Sixers get: Stauskas Thompson Landry  Kings get: Koufos Rondo  Dallas gets: Salary filler from (Memphis or Philly) or Trade exception (for Lin)  Memphis gets: Rights to oversees players  Trade 2:  Spurs get:  IT Exception  Kings get:  Bellineli  At least from the Kings perspective this should be legal (or at least not breaking any rules off the top of my head at midnight on a Sunday after a holiday weekend), assuming the papers that send Stauskas and Landry over haven't actually been signed.  It would have to work for the other teams, and have to be timed so that it works for the signing of the free agents (the IT exception expires on 7/10 or 7/11 I think).  Also there isn't really a good reason for Dallas to do this unless they get a non-guaranteed contract (or something else LA would want) from Memphis, which is probably going to be valued higher than the rights to oversees players.  Anyways, just something to think about.  If anyone sees something obvious that I missed, let me know.  Edit: Also those numbers are off...  Standard MLE: $5.464 million  Room MLE: $2.814 million  Biannual: $2.139 million"

kings,3c6iml,Thousandtree,3,Sun Jul 5 09:05:39 2015 UTC,Do we have the cap to sign him though?
kings,3c6iml,kingsin4,7,Sun Jul 5 09:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think Smith can take the vet min and it still doesn't matter to him. His Detroit contract is still valid, so however low he signed, he's still guaranteed his Detroit money. He was stretched by Detroit, so he is getting paid $5.4M a year until 2019. So if he signed for $2M with Sac, Detroit will only have to pay him $3.4M. Only way he'll get more than his Detroit contract is if he signed for more than $5.4M. In which case Detroit is off hook with his salary, but it will still count against their salary cap. People think Detroit was dumb to pay $40M to waived Smith. But they know some teams will give him a contract, and Smith might worth $5M a year. So in the end they might only be on the hook for about $10M on his contract.   Speaking if stretch provision, I dont think it wouldve been a bad idea to stretched Landry or JT's contract. We might not have to pay any money if some teams picked them up and the hit against the cap will be very minor. I think we could've saved the 1st rounder in the Philly trade if we only send them JT and Nik."
kings,3c6iml,Thousandtree,9,Sun Jul 5 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"Pistons fan here stopping by to see what rumors there are about what the Kings have to offer Smith. You're sort of correct in what Detroit owes Smith.   Because of the stretch provision, we owe him $5.4 million this year, but the amount our obligation gets reduced is a little more complicated. Basically, if you paid him the $5.5 million MLE this season, we get to reduce our payment (and cap number) by $2 million (the calculation is new salary minus vet's minimum of $1.5 mil, divided by two----5.5-1.5=4, /2=2). So taking away that $2million setoff, Detroit would pay Smith 3.4 million, plus Smith would still be paid $5.5 million from you guys, for a total of $8.9 million. So he does have every incentive to still get as good of a contract as he can. The only way he doesn't get ""extra money"" from Detroit would be if he gets a yearly salary of more than $12.3 million from somebody else, which probably won't happen because no one else has hired Joe Dumars yet. :)  Edit: fixed a number."

Also, did SVG screwed up playing hardball and gamble with Moose? I was interested to see how he would do as President of basketball ops."
kings,3c6iml,sketchy_crab,3,Sun Jul 5 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a high chance that it was a bad move. We would have either been bringing in more bad contracts or giving up draft assets if we traded Smith. With the rising cap, this summer is probably the worst impact we would see from Smith's dead cap weight, but we still had huge space that no free agents (other than Aron Baynes) wanted to fill. And more importantly, SVG has been making great use of the 2nd rounders he was able to keep -- he used them for our trades with OKC and PHX to bring in two starters. The only way I see it as a negative move is if, at some point in the future, we end up just a few million short in cap space to trade for somebody...but that seems unlikely since we'll probably be going over the cap when our young core all get their next contracts.  As for Moose? I think that worked out well for everyone. He was a good fit when Brandon Jennings was our point guard, and I think we would have used his Bird rights to offer him a larger max than other teams if Brandon hadn't gotten injured (and I think he would have stayed because he was having a lot of fun when we were winning).   But once we got Reggie Jackson, there really was no place for him on our team other than as a wildly underutilized backup to Drummond. He's a great player, but SVG's offense needs at least three shooters on the court at all times, and Moose's defense certainly wasn't going to make up for the team's offensive shortcomings. He will probably be awesome in Milwaukee's system with his passing and post play on offense, while adding strength and rebounding to a defense that can overcome his lack of shot blocking and athleticism."

kings,3c8pwm,tman916x,2,Mon Jul 6 04:52:05 2015 UTC,Mayhem. I love it
kings,3c8pwm,rolladoob,10,Mon Jul 6 05:06:14 2015 UTC,Sign Casspi for the minimum on a 3 year deal and convince Josh Smith to sign for whatever is left over.
kings,3c8pwm,truwarier14,4,Sun Jul 5 23:17:21 2015 UTC,Apparently our only option is to sign Casspi for whatever is left and then give Smith the room exception.
kings,3c8pwm,rolladoob,4,Sun Jul 5 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't put us into the luxury tax or anything, would it?"
kings,3c8pwm,James__Franco,6,Sun Jul 5 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"No. We'd be over the cap, but under the luxury tax apron."
kings,3c8pwm,rolladoob,5,Sun Jul 5 23:33:05 2015 UTC,"Well, shit, then what are we waiting for?"
kings,3c8pwm,sdub,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:37:01 2015 UTC,No way Smith would accept that little.
kings,3c8pwm,kingsin4,3,Mon Jul 6 05:45:11 2015 UTC,A multi-year vet min deal is an insult for Casspi. He has shown last year is a valuable backup for us. I say he's worth at least somewhere around $3-$5M. He wants to stay in Sac. Good teammate. Gave it 110% on the court. And actually our best 3 point shooter last year based on percentage. Give the man his money. I'm surprised he isnt getting a 3/$12M deal some other teams yet.
kings,3c8pwm,rolladoob,2,Mon Jul 6 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"What exactly is the vet minimum for him? I figured it would be about that range, if not a little bit less."
kings,3c8pwm,kingsin4,2,Mon Jul 6 00:17:20 2015 UTC,"About $1.2M for Casspi. The more years youre in the league the higher the vet min is, but not much."
kings,3c8pwm,coachadam,5,Mon Jul 6 00:29:37 2015 UTC,Or if we retain Casspi and get either of those other two for depth I'd be very happy.
kings,3c8pwm,4everpurple,5,Sun Jul 5 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"I think getting Casspi would be great. I think that would be all we need to really be a competitive player for the 8-9 spots..   Getting Bass, Lawson, or Cory Joseph would make us even better, but I think Lawson for DC is the only straight across upgrade that is really feasible at this point.   JSmoove isn't really needed at this point with a player like Trill on the team. He does all the best Smith does on D plus more, without the TOs and terrible shot selection.   If all he does is dunk, play D and rebound then yes Smith is good for us, but there's too much likelihood that he would bring the bad with the good."
kings,3c8pwm,dscheidt,4,Sun Jul 5 23:37:24 2015 UTC,I like Smoove but I 100%agree with you. I really like the idea of keeping casspi and getting one more solid scorer or plus defender.
kings,3c8pwm,SacUp,3,Sun Jul 5 23:42:38 2015 UTC,Well bass is no longer an option.
kings,3c7lvo,Such_Good_Insight,11,Sun Jul 5 17:22:19 2015 UTC,It's McLemore's job to lose. Bellinelli is better suited in a bench role.
kings,3c7lvo,CeJeH,2,Sun Jul 5 17:33:08 2015 UTC,tbh ben hasnt shown that hes not better suited for a bench role  I think its just gonna be an open competition in camp and what Karl sees/likes
kings,3c7lvo,jimbrope,5,Sun Jul 5 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think neither will start. Rondo, Collison, Gay, Cousins, WCS is my guess, with a rotating bench featuring McLemore, Belinelli, Casspi/Smith, Koufos, and sparse minutes from McCallum and Moreland. But the truth is, I think we're finally starting to see the team that will put into practice Vivek's vision of positionless basketball.  The lineup options are absolutely endless with this squad. Need spacing/small-ball? Rondo, Marco, McLemore, Rudy, Boogie. Want to play uptempo? Collison, BenMac, Casspi/Smith, Boogie, WCS. Want to rest some starters and have defense that won't blow the lead? Collison, Marco, Casspi/Smith, Koufos, WCS. Want to play a version of last year's starting five that was one of the best in the NBA? Collison, BenMac, Gay, WCS, Cousins. Want to play the worst five guys on the team in garbage time? McCallum, BenMac, Casspi, Moreland, Koufos. That's still a pretty decent squad. And don't forget, our coach is a future hall of famer in George Karl, who is known for his consistency in making the playoffs.  Honestly, Vlade did a beyond amazing job this free agency, and I think the story of next season is gonna be that not only are the Kings a playoff team... but they're gonna actually be competitive. Can't wait for the season."
kings,3c7lvo,BigGreekMike,5,Sun Jul 5 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"I can see this happening once every now and again but not our regular starting lineup. More than pretty much any other coach I know of (except maybe Westphal), Karl really tinkers with starting lineups to suit his gameplan/matchups.   Our day one starting lineup is going to be really hard to project at the moment mainly because WCS is kind of a wildcard. Is he a legit starter as a rookie? Maybe. Maybe not."
kings,3c7lvo,oh_peaches,2,Sun Jul 5 22:13:48 2015 UTC,Yea the whole 2 PG or Rudy at the 4 is not going to be to start games IMO  it will be a rotation they slip into under certain situations
kings,3c7lvo,jimbrope,0,Sun Jul 5 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the whole 2 PG idea. I know Karl did it in Denver, but that's when he got a scoring guard in Ty Lawson. So basically an undersized SG. Rondo and Darren won't work together. Rondo without the basketball is pretty much useless out there. And Darren isnt really an off the ball scorer."
kings,3c7lvo,kingsin4,2,Mon Jul 6 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like Ben has proven he can start and as young as he is they wouldn't take that away from him. With that being said, he can lose the spot with the inconsistent shooting he displayed a few times last year. I feel that they'll let him play though, gotta get that PT to develop."
kings,3c7lvo,ItsNotSpaghetti,2,Sun Jul 5 20:50:42 2015 UTC,Yup.  Just stay out of foul trouble and make smarter choices.
kings,3c7lvo,tman916x,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:02:59 2015 UTC,I'd give him a 50% chance.   I would rather have bellinelli off the bench as a sixth man because I think he can handle the ball better than McLemore.
kings,3c5w3t,ThisIsMyFavoriteSub,28,Sun Jul 5 03:00:40 2015 UTC,"This bench is getting better and better, collison, belinelli, Koufos, McCallum, now we need to get Casspi back."
kings,3c5w3t,gohstrifle,8,Sun Jul 5 03:08:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously, are there any other bases we needed to cover? I think this covers all the needs that we've thought needed to be covered. I heard about us needing to cover the SF position, but that's solved when we get Casspi, right?"
kings,3c5w3t,guy15s,10,Sun Jul 5 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"We got everything pretty much covered, solid backups at every position, if we get casspi back, we are pretty complete"
kings,3c5w3t,gohstrifle,4,Sun Jul 5 03:16:24 2015 UTC,Still need a reserve 4. Or starting 3 if Rudy is really playing the 4
kings,3c5w3t,The-Hot-Tamale,3,Sun Jul 5 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"We have Eric Moreland coming in, but you're right. We could use somebody more proven to back up the 4."
kings,3c5w3t,guy15s,3,Sun Jul 5 03:41:24 2015 UTC,So we need to sign Omri and a reserve 4 with 2mil. Hmmm....
kings,3c5w3t,The-Hot-Tamale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:45:24 2015 UTC,"With the present interchangeability of the PF position with the SF position and the athleticism of our centers, I think we can do without the reserve PF. It will be the part of this team that isn't complete, though. Casspi should definitely be a higher priority than covering the reserve PF, unless we can get an amazing deal.  EDIT: Also, what about our MLE? Now that we're this close to the cap, shouldn't it be 5m?"
kings,3c5w3t,guy15s,2,Sun Jul 5 03:47:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. However that still only leaves 5 guys covering 3 positions, which is not the best situation, and injuries do happen"
kings,3c5w3t,The-Hot-Tamale,2,Sun Jul 5 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"Just in case you didn't see the edit, we can use the MLE to sign Casspi to up to a 5m for 4 years, right? Then that just leaves the reserve PF to get with 2m, which won't get us anything great, but it should get somebody who can cover the position in case of, like you said, injuries or mishaps."
kings,3c5w3t,guy15s,2,Sun Jul 5 03:54:09 2015 UTC,What are the options we have with 2 mil?
kings,3c5w3t,gohstrifle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:00:01 2015 UTC,"Somebody we haven't heard of in a while. :p Quincy Acy is still available, but he's really short for that position. Tenacious enough to cover it in a reserve role, though, maybe. Especially with George Karl coaching. Other than that, nobody really stands out.  Here's a list of who is available. http://www.nba.com/freeagents/2015/  URL doesn't look like it will carry over my settings, so you'll want to go to the available tab and then switch to forwards to make it easier."
kings,3c5w3t,guy15s,2,Sun Jul 5 04:04:24 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I believe the MLE is only for teams over the cap
kings,3c5w3t,The-Hot-Tamale,2,Sun Jul 5 04:00:31 2015 UTC,"It also applies if signing the MLE would put you over the cap, so it could work. It could actually be exactly why we've been waiting to sign Casspi."
kings,3c5w3t,guy15s,9,Sun Jul 5 04:05:29 2015 UTC,Fuck I don't think we'll be able to get him back I seriously hope I'm wrong. The last talented guy that really wanted to stay with the kings was shown the door while getting smacked with a broom. Let's not make that mistake again.

kings,3c5w3t,tman916x,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:38:36 2015 UTC,"SA yes, but they're not really banging down low, more finesse. Phoenix has Tyson, we'll see who they choose at the 4, Len or Morris. Houston has Dwight and I guess Dmo qualifies here. He is pretty good and has a really nice post game. DJ is solid defensively, but Dirk doesn't play like a big these days.   SA, Houston, Dallas and Memphis have bigs to compete, but Memphis are the only bruisers to compete with us. With our depth in the front court, I think only Memphis is better right now, and that could change depending on how well WCS plays this year."
kings,3c5w3t,James__Franco,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:42:22 2015 UTC,I hope so man.  Boogie abused a lot of those guys last year with Collison/Gay.  Now he's got much more help which will be nice especially if everyone pulls it together.
kings,3c5w3t,tman916x,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:52:48 2015 UTC,"exactly.  everyone has bigs right,but Boogie is a dominant force down low compared to everyone else (minus Gasol. That dude is dangerous). I think he can take dwight, duncan, tyson, and whoever. Gasol is the only person I can think of that can put up a good fight.   anyways, i dont think im overly optimistic. I just think we have the right pieces to be in the right spot. The only real threat is SA. With LA and if ginobli comes back, man that is one tough team to beat."

kings,3c71bx,hipnerd,4,Sun Jul 5 14:40:29 2015 UTC,I think it was physical limitations from injury rather than poor attitude.
kings,3c71bx,coachadam,2,Sun Jul 5 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about this stint or the 1st? He played down low alot, especially for Malone. Malone would basically feed Boogie, then sub Carl in and Boogie out and feed Carl..   Towards the end of this year under Karl he got no run because he can't move at the speed Karl wants, much less play at that speed. So he jogged up as the trail post and shot open looks if they sagged off from him to pinch Boogie..   There's a huge difference and I think it's disrespectful to a really solid player and guy to say he played lazy. I'd say your answer was lazier than his play honestly."

This doesn't include cap holds or anything.   As you can see we still have about 2 roster spots to fill. I'm fairly certain that David Stockton will either be released or moved to Reno. They certainly don't need him unless they cut or trade RayMac.  We need another SF and a scoring PF. Casspi would fill that role nicely, especially if we can get him for cheap and if he continues to play like he did at the end of last season.  Other guys the Kings should look at are Dorell Wright and Mirza Teletovic. Both of those guys can play SF/PF and both are good 3p shooters. Wright is the better defender but will more than likely be more expensive than Casspi or Teletovic.   Personally I would prefer that they cut David Stockton, find some way to hide Moreland's salary in Reno while he re-habs from his injury and gets used to the pace of the NBA, and do whatever we can to sign Dorell Wright. He would be a really good backup 3/4 for us."

kings,3c7o59,Arugon,3,Sun Jul 5 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"He was one of the best backup Centers in the NBA last year. He's a very capable post scorer, a good defender, solid rebounder. He is capable of playing Center and letting Boogie move to PF, although I'm not a big fan of the spacing issues that could create. Or, if he comes off the bench, he will probably be the best backup Center in the West and fully capable of replacing Boogie if he's out with injury or something.  Very good pickup for us at a pretty good value."

kings,3c6gvk,iamablueberrymuffin,2,Sun Jul 5 07:54:25 2015 UTC,How much would the MLE net Josh Smith? He's on a $2M deal with the Rockets plus the whole infamous no income tax in Texas.
kings,3c6gvk,Narwhail0r,3,Sun Jul 5 07:57:27 2015 UTC,"MLE would give him 5mil. And the fact that there hasn't been many teams clamoring for him, he may be willing to accept it."
kings,3c6gvk,Narwhail0r,7,Sun Jul 5 08:07:44 2015 UTC,5.3m for Jsmoove with the MLE if we cap out with Casspi (which he definitely deserves a significant amount extra). If we ended the FA by signing those 2 lol..Vlade would win EOTY imo. Lol.
kings,3c6gvk,32rahul,5,Sun Jul 5 09:00:42 2015 UTC,I agree. Getting those two would be like a fairy tale
kings,3c6gvk,Narwhail0r,2,Sun Jul 5 12:55:21 2015 UTC,If Josh Smith signs with us..think of what Vlade was able to do in the short months he was the GM. It's no secret the Kings have long sought after Rondo and Josh Smith....if Vlade did this in one off-season after being what..in charge for 2-3 months? Can't call Vlade a rookie lol.
kings,3c6gvk,chubbupp,2,Sun Jul 5 20:18:47 2015 UTC,Didnt we use the MLE on Collison last year? Does that carry over to this year?
kings,3c6gvk,tman916x,3,Sun Jul 5 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"No, we straight offered him 3 years 15 mil."
kings,3c6gvk,guy15s,2,Sun Jul 5 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"On top of /u/tman916x's comment, you get a new MLE every year, so if we did use it last year, we would still have one to use this year. Houston can also still use theirs too, though, so we'll see. Rumor is they want to use it on a point guard or another addition, instead of Josh Smith. If they use it on Josh Smith, we're likely out of the running, I think."
kings,3c6gvk,tman916x,2,Mon Jul 6 01:52:38 2015 UTC,Does jsmoove have a say in the matter?  Like could he reject our bid and stay with HOU?

kings,3c6gvk,DemonicDimples,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:46:10 2015 UTC,Correct.  You get the room exception instead which is 2.8m.
kings,3c6gvk,guy15s,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is right. I've looked at the rules myself, and as long as the MLE signing causes the team to go over the cap, it still counts. I'm not finding anything about losing your MLE because you went under the cap, just that the MLE counts towards the cap, so if you sign somebody to go over the cap and get the full MLE (which it does count that way, specifically) it does allow the full MLE."
kings,3c6gvk,guy15s,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:57:34 2015 UTC,"Where does it say that? I'm reading the rules and there's no mention of losing it once you go under the cap, just that you lose it if the MLE signing doesn't cause you to go over the cap."

I believe we have enough to sign a 4-5 mil guy and resign Casppi (SF2) with the exception and Andre (PG4) to the vet min."
kings,3c5y3p,amblix,9,Sun Jul 5 03:26:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I do feel bad for Collison though because he did so well for us last year. While I have you here, could you explain what the pick swap means in the Sixers trade? Also is the 1st round pick not that bad since it's top 10 protected or is it bad because we aren't planning on being in the top 10?"
kings,3c5y3p,PattiYoureTheMayo,7,Sun Jul 5 03:35:51 2015 UTC,"Not him, but I'll try to explain the picks in the Sixers trade.  Hopefully, this is helpful.  If not, let me know.  The Sixers will have the right to swap picks with us in the 2016 and 2017 drafts (should neither pick go to the Bulls as part of a previous trade).  So, if they end up with the 6th pick and us the 3rd after the lottery, they can say they want the 3rd and we'll end up with the 6th.  There aren't many people who think the swaps will even happen, as the Sixers are still openly racing along the bottom.    The protected pick will go the Sixers if it doesn't fall into the top 10.  In that case, we lose out on a low lottery or non-lottery pick.  I probably shouldn't have been the one to answer this, because I'm not sure how long the pick will be protected.  If it is like the other protected picks traded in the league, it will eventually lose its protection or standing.  The pick owed to the Bulls, for example, will become an outright 2nd rounder if it doesn't change hands by 2018 (I believe that is the year).  My opinion is that it is too soon to say whether any of it was good or bad.  Some believe that it was bad enough to damage the team for another decade.  Others, myself included, view it more as a timely gamble that can actually be recompensed in the event that all goes south."
kings,3c5y3p,PattiYoureTheMayo,4,Sun Jul 5 04:04:57 2015 UTC,"Very helpful, thanks!  So what is our draft pick outlook right now? What was the Bulls trade? Was that a 3 team trade?"
kings,3c5y3p,ChangloriousBastard,3,Sun Jul 5 04:13:02 2015 UTC,"Well, the draft pick outlook right now is pretty unknown.  It is possible that we end up with a single, low pick in the next three years.  If that ends up being the case, I see a major overhaul being executed to regain picks.   We could lose next year's pick to the Bulls, or trade down with the Sixers.  The same applies to 2017, if the Bulls don't get our pick next year.  2018 could see a loss of both picks, should the parameters fit.  We really just wait and see at this point.  The Bulls have our pick that was sent to the Cavs as part of the deal to bring in Hickson a while ago.  The Cavs later sent it to the Bulls as part of a trade for Deng."
kings,3c5y3p,corvenzo,2,Sun Jul 5 04:40:15 2015 UTC,"While I have you here, could you explain what the pick swap means in the Sixers trade?   If we have a better pick than they do, they take the better one."
kings,3c5y3p,Bocheetus,5,Sun Jul 5 04:42:42 2015 UTC,I think it would be better to run a 2 PG line-up with Rondo and Collision and have McLemore as 6th man.
kings,3c5y3p,MaverickENT,7,Sun Jul 5 04:03:09 2015 UTC,That's been my thinking.  Having Kuofos start makes sense since.  Idunno how quickly WCS will transition to the pro level.  This way WCS can develop into the starting C role more effectively.
kings,3c5y3p,-Hoopin-,4,Sun Jul 5 04:20:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and keeps Boogie happy by putting him at the 4 (presumably). I think Ben is primed for a breakout year, and am really happy we can let WCS ease into the league. If we can get Casspi back then we can also slide Gay to the 4 in small ball lineups."
kings,3c5y3p,coachadam,2,Sun Jul 5 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, Mclemore should become more and more consistent and we already have seen flashes of his potential. We need Collision to run the 2nd team, he's a great ball handler and playmaker for us, he will excel more in a role where he is first or second option on the 2nd team then playing a brand new role with the starting lineup. This makes our bench actually competitive and hopefully DC gets 6MOTY."
kings,3c5y3p,coachadam,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're right and that hr will run a lot of 2 guard small ball lineups with he and Rondo on the floor at once, they just won't start together."
kings,3c5y3p,Jabroni916,0,Sun Jul 5 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you start a 2 point guard lineup with Boogie and Koufos in. I think you go small with Boogie or WCS at the 5 Rudy or Omri 4 then Any of the shooters 3 with DC and Rondo, better spacing tempo for the 2 guards to get into the D quickly or get a post to set the early high screen action."
kings,3c5y3p,oh_peaches,4,Sun Jul 5 23:41:34 2015 UTC,We have a legit deep team now. our bench can finally hold the fort down and Cousins and Rudy wont have to score 30+ to keep us in the game
kings,3c5y3p,jkopecky,2,Sun Jul 5 05:26:02 2015 UTC,"The Koufos signing was huge for two huge reasons. For one, DMC missed a lot of games last year and our frontcourt rotation was bad without a legit backup center. Also, Koufos' signing should allow Boogie to play fewer minutes in the first three quarters and more in the fourth. He's had to stay on the court even when he's tired and in need of a sub just to keep us in games."
kings,3c5y3p,oh_peaches,2,Sun Jul 5 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"The Koufos pickup is definitely huge. Boogie only played 34 minutes per game last year but his play style along with carrying so much of the load wears him out, by the end of the year it was clear he didn't have much left in the tank.   I'm hoping we see an interesting mix of lineups. I hope that between backing up Gay and being able to slide over to the PF spot in smaller lineups Casspi get's a little more time this year as well."
kings,3c5y3p,kingsloyalty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"In regards to Casspi's playing time, I'm not sure if we'll see him more than 20 minutes a night and I'm okay with that. Casspi is most effective when he's hustling his ass off and I'm not sure he (or any mortal) can sustain his level of effort for 30 minutes night in and night out without risking injury. He's just such a balls out player. I agree that we're likely to see him at PF a little more now that we don't seem to have a single veteran true PF on the roster. I'm in the ""Boogie is a center"" camp."
kings,3c5y3p,oh_peaches,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"I really like the small ball/2 point guard line up of:   Rondo, Darren, Ben, Rudy, DMC. Lot's of ball handlers and people who can pass the rock.  Bench: Ray, Marco Bellinelli, Kosta, WCS."

kings,3c5zwu,The-Hot-Tamale,5,Sun Jul 5 04:19:52 2015 UTC,I know Gay can. He guarded AD very well last year
kings,3c5zwu,4everpurple,2,Sun Jul 5 04:13:11 2015 UTC,Gay can. Casspi needs work.  Offensively they are gold
kings,3c5k31,atenschnplies,26,Sun Jul 5 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, I think he might be our glue guy for this team. He seems to be really good at strengthening relationships between the players, he was key to recruiting Rondo, and he seems to be a good leader in the locker room. He seems to be really committed to being an optimistic force, which is something that is crucial to our team right now. I definitely see him as being key to our future as a team."
kings,3c5k31,guy15s,14,Sun Jul 5 00:47:19 2015 UTC,"The guy is freakishly calm. The only time I've ever seen him get pissed for some reason was..uhh I honestly forgot what game it was against, but it was like 5 minutes into the game and he got 2 techs within minutes and walked back into the locker room. But yes other than that, it's just so weird how relaxed this guy is even in dire situations. I wold have to agree with you there...I think he is a key to our future."
kings,3c5k31,Narwhail0r,6,Sun Jul 5 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the exact game, but I think you're talking about when he got frustrated with Beverly, which is completely understandable. Dude is really good at pulling stuff outside the view of the refs."
kings,3c5k31,guy15s,5,Sun Jul 5 01:08:27 2015 UTC,HAH! Found it! The night Klay Thompson dropped 37pts in a quarter.  I had to dig through my comment history cause I definitely remembered commenting on that game thread. Man..that night gave me PTSD that my brain legit just tried to forget that ever happened.  Edit: It was actually the beginning of the second quarter  4 minutes in. But yeah Rudy man. Cool dude.
kings,3c5k31,Narwhail0r,3,Sun Jul 5 01:15:20 2015 UTC,"lol I remember that game.  Rudy seemed like he didnt want to play that night lmao  When we first got him I thought he would be this ballhog cancer from what people in TOR were saying but it wasnt the case at all.  His efficiency dropped a little this year, but he seemed to be picking it back up when Karl got here and got him shoting closer to the back (and no more of the dreaded Rudy ISO).  When he plays within the offense he is awesome and man when he is on he looks like any of these other superstars in the league."
kings,3c5k31,jimbrope,2,Sun Jul 5 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think his big thing isn't that he's a ball hog, but that he needs a system. Without a system, he reverts back to playground ball, and that shit don't work in the NBA."
kings,3c5k31,guy15s,2,Sun Jul 5 03:21:11 2015 UTC,Yea I agree you saw that a lot when Cousins got hurt because we didn't have an offense without cousins so that was the peak of the Rudy ISO™
kings,3c5k31,jimbrope,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:08:54 2015 UTC,Rudy ISO was at its peak when Corbin was at the helm lol.
kings,3c5k31,Narwhail0r,9,Sun Jul 5 06:27:11 2015 UTC,"he had a great year last year despite our losing. He's clearly our number 2 option behind cousins and that won't change with the rondo signing. Since he's gotten to Sacramento he's shot .466%, and definitely has improved his efficiency since his awful stint in Toronto. He scores about 20 a game and grabs about 6 rebounds, and I'd consider him the 6th best small forward in the game (behind Lebron, KD, PG, Carmelo and Kawhi). Overall it was a fantastic pickup from the kings front office, and he's one of the main reasons I continue to trust this front office despite all the negative media. He also signed a very team friendly deal with us, (4 years, 62 million) which really gives us room to make some of the deals we are making. He's probably the best pure scorer on our team and he's worth every penny of his contract. I could not be happier with his production and with his attitude. If we do well next year and make a run in the western conference you can be sure that he'll be right in the middle of it with his production and with his attitude."
kings,3c5k31,save_the_pigs,2,Sun Jul 5 00:58:06 2015 UTC,"The analytic crowd hates him because he takes a lot of mid-range shots. Also his half season in Toronto didn't do him any favors on that front, he was horrible."
kings,3c5k31,The-Hot-Tamale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"I forget the exact title because it's been a while, but Rudy Gay was a winner of Bill Simmons ""Internet Shamed into playing better defense and passing"" Award two years ago."
kings,3c3wxo,SiegtonfThaSwizz,10,Sat Jul 4 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"Hey! First off thanks for stopping by! We'll take care of Rondo and hopefully you guys take care of IT! Reading that Rondo article on ESPN it does seem like he flourishes in a positive environment. Surrounded by friends. Boogie LOVES Rondo and obviousy him and Gay are good friends. Karl likes playing 2 PG line-ups so adding in DC to the mix who can also hit his shots surely helps out Rondo even more. It's too early to tell if this will mesh, but at least we know he's in an environment surrounded by friends. It's going to be one exciting year for us."
kings,3c3wxo,Narwhail0r,4,Sat Jul 4 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting to see how Rondo does in 2 PG line-ups. I can't recall any time in which that happened in Boston. How good of a shooter is Collison? If he's pretty decent--or especially if he has particular spots he's great from--it could be a good match. Hopefully Rondo puts in effort on defense, though, because that's a small backcourt."
kings,3c3wxo,Narwhail0r,4,Sat Jul 4 16:04:13 2015 UTC,"Darren's 3 point percentage was 37% last season. So we at least know he can make those shots. We're no defensive juggernauts, but hopefully our new draftee WCS can make the difference."
kings,3c3wxo,UncleDucker,6,Sat Jul 4 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty high on WCS. If I recall correctly, he was mostly a football player growing up. Basketball is relatively new to him. Assuming the injury concerns are overblown, I think he could be a weapon next year even. The question is really gonna be figuring out an offensive role for him. If he can be for the Kings what Tristan Thompson is for the Cavs, he could make some noise."
kings,3c3wxo,oh_peaches,2,Sat Jul 4 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"DC has the most reliable shot on the team. It's a consistent mid range from the elbow that will serve the team well especially since Ranadive has been trying to get Cousins to initiate the offense through the high post, which relies on cutters.   With the high post offense (basically the offense of the Kings' glory years last decade), you need your 2 and 4 to be good spacers and cutters (something JT was not) and your 3 to be able to run the weak side pick and roll (Gay can do that if he chooses to) and the point guard to take the hand off from the high post to attack the basket and make plays (which sounds like Rondo's forte).   Last year we only saw DC for half a year, and when he was out we lost that dependable shot from the elbow and the appropriate spacing. So looking forward to this season. Then again if we pick up Josh Smith all the spacing is out the window."
kings,3c3wxo,oh_peaches,3,Sat Jul 4 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The mid range elbow shot is one that Rondo has experience feeding--that's Avery Bradley's bread and butter. They had a pretty good rapport, but never got a ton of time to work together due to injuries.   If Cousins does park himself in the high post instead of down low, the Celtics Big 3 comparison is even more apt. KG would always be there to open lanes for Pierce and Rondo, and to allow Perkins to hide down low. Cousins is higher usage than KG and on lower efficiency, but if he can hit those shots at a slightly higher rate, Karl should have plenty of examples of where this offense can go.   I don't know if I much like Smith on this team, and I don't think it's especially likely he'll leave Houston. But he would definitely increase the talent level, and he might be worth it for that alone. If he'd accept a bench role as a defensive terror who can also push the ball like Karl wants, that could be a good fit. He certainly had a lob connection with Dwight, so maybe he and Trill could cook something up. I just don't know that he'll leave a sure thing in Houston."
kings,3c3wxo,bbgun91,2,Sat Jul 4 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting. I always knew that Demarcus had a slight edge on KG, as evidenced by his much superior 3 point percentage. /s"

kings,3c5ijh,The-Hot-Tamale,2,Sun Jul 5 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"I like it. If Rudy is starting at the four then WCS will be our reserve 5, Casspi at 3, Marco 2, and Collison 1. Only spot we're missing is reserve 4. I dont think David Lee fits there at all, since they'll be looking for someone more like Rudy"

kings,3c65sb,4everpurple,3,Sun Jul 5 05:33:22 2015 UTC,"You could say this about pretty much every team, but more shooting would be sweet.  We have Belinelli now which is cool, we have Gay and Collison who are decent 3p shooters, and Mclemore who kind of alternates between shooting the lights out and looking like he's never shot a basketball before.  Ideally, I think adding 1-2 more really solid shooters would definitely take some pressure off of Boogie by giving the defense second thoughts about all collapsing on him in the paint.  A stretch 4 would be dope.   We've got some solid defensive bigs now to pair with Boogie and take some of the load off him on that end, and either Koufos or WCS should be able to hold it down while he's on the bench.    I love what Casspi brings to the table, and it would be awesome to have 2-3 hustle/dirty work guys like him.    Really, though, I think our biggest need is a solid wing defender.  Mclemore improved a lot on defense last year and Rudy is decent when he wants to be, but a lockdown wing defender might be the single biggest piece that we could add right now, because we get absolutely lit up by teams with good shooters."

kings,3c1pfc,tomchaney479,5,Sat Jul 4 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"If Rondo can get back to being a superstar (what would have to happen), and Karl coaches this team well, they will be contenders.... They won't win next year but they'll be knocking on the door, which is what I meant to imply by ""If he makes Sac a legitimate contender."""
kings,3c1pfc,jkopecky,0,Sat Jul 4 05:28:03 2015 UTC,I know this is the Kings sub but this is some delusional shit. You guys have some hope to put together a solid playoff squad this year. 0% chance you will be knocking on the door of being a contender lol
kings,3c1pfc,nocioniisgod,2,Sat Jul 4 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"Hey man I'm actually a Bulls fan, but I live outside Sac and have always loved the Kings. I'm just trying to imagine a best case scenario and honestly there's enough talent on this squad. A LOT of stars would have to align. Rondo has to be great, McLemore has to improve dramatically, WCS has to live up to the hype, Boogie has to play with focus... ect. When I say ""knocking on the door"" I mean i:   grabbing a 7-8 seed. either causing a first round upset or scaring the pants off a better team in a 6-7 game series.    That outcome would mean they have a chance of brining in one or two guys to make a jump to a contender. Is this team less talented than the Nuggets team that Karl brought to 57-25 a few years ago? Are they worse? Maybe...probably, are they less talented? I don't think so.   EDIT: Okay looking back I said ""they will be contenders"" I meant to phrase that more as in ""they will have the potential to be contenders in the future"" I don't think they're cracking the top 5-6 of the west next year... that would be a bit crazy."
kings,3c1pfc,jkopecky,-2,Sat Jul 4 15:54:40 2015 UTC,"Rondo was never close to being a superstar. Don't be ridiculous.  Moreover, he's taken huge steps back since his prime."
kings,3c1pfc,tomchaney479,4,Sat Jul 4 06:32:11 2015 UTC,"he's taken huge steps back since his prime.   I don't disagree... I just wouldn't be surprised if he can come back to 75-80% of that.    Rondo was never close to being a superstar.   We can argue semantics about whether he was or wasn't, but I'd say that the three straight seasons where he had 11+ assists and scored 10+ points (on efficient shooting btw) with 4.5+ rebounds, while being the best defensive point guard in the league put him at least close.   All I'm saying is that if he improves just a little bit on what he was doing in Boston LAST YEAR he could be putting up 10/10/7 as the fourth scoring option on this team."
kings,3c1pfc,jkopecky,-2,Sat Jul 4 06:42:58 2015 UTC,"Rondo was never the best defensive PG, Chris Paul was.  Rondo racked up high steal numbers due to gambling (a la kobe) but a guy like Paul has long since been a top on ball defensive PG.  Rondo's advanced metrics never placed him even near superstar status, despite him posting good numbers in a couple categories.  Take his best seasons and he was FAR below actual superstars like Lebron, CP3, Durant, Dwight, Blake, A Davis, and at least a dozen or so others.  This isn't semantics, this is a fact.  All star?  Sure.  But Rondo was not ever, and was never close, to being a superstar.    You're conveniently ignoring some of the things that Rondo is historically bad at: such as shooting.  Please don't be a homer.  Try looking at things objectively here."
kings,3c1pfc,tomchaney479,3,Sat Jul 4 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"You either need to relax or shut the fuck up. Rondo is on the Kings and he is a good player, THOSE are facts."
kings,3c1pfc,liquidsquid00,0,Sat Jul 4 13:51:17 2015 UTC,"Haha, so one guy says Rondo is a superstar, and you say that he is a good player.  Not only are both of those statements false, but good =/= superstar."

People are seriously underestimating this squad. The roster is a lot better than last year, and last year we were on pace for playoffs before Cousins got deathly sick and then they fired Malone..."
kings,3c1pfc,XpLoZiioN,-1,Sat Jul 4 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"LOL, I love it when people say that.  I've said this before, I wish we could place a bet on the Kings next season.  I'll bet on them not making the playoffs, you can have them being seeds 1-8 in the west.  I'd take out a mortgage to bet against you.    I wonder how confident you'd be in that prediction with money on the line."

kings,3c1pfc,gut_killer,2,Fri Jul 3 23:21:44 2015 UTC,Your comment perfectly sums up my thoughts. A team option year 2 for the same amount would have made this an excellent arrangement. A one year deal with no team option surprises me with because of Vivek's laser focus on being a winner for year one of Golden One Center.
kings,3c1pfc,oh_peaches,2,Sat Jul 4 01:36:43 2015 UTC,He more then likely will but I think the hope is to look like a decent team on the rise with a few pieces after this coming year is over in hopes that even if he does leave someone else will have seen what we did and what we did for Rondo and be ok with signing with us.
kings,3c1pfc,HakunaMatata023,-2,Sat Jul 4 01:46:53 2015 UTC,"You will have his Bird Rights so you will at least be the only team that can offer him 5 years and a little more money as well. I suspect he will probably not work out though, to be honest."
kings,3c1pfc,mcorcoran3,7,Fri Jul 3 23:27:02 2015 UTC,"At least we know he should be motivated, since if no other teams were bidding on him this offseason, one more poor year on the Kings might just end his career. Plus if it makes Boogie happy, then that's a pretty good thing too."

He and Rudy are great friends. Both rondo and Demarcus have said positive things about each other's game in the past. These two respect each other and will probably play well together. I think rondo could lead the league in assists this year, possibly. He's still one of the best ball distributers in the league."

kings,3c1pfc,endubs,6,Fri Jul 3 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"[celtics fan] I'm happy for you guys.  I've been saying ever since he left our team, he would be great on the Kings.  The Kings need someone to take charge on the offense, and Cousins isn't quite there yet and needs some help.  Rondo is going to be able to help Cousins work on his shot by getting him open looks, rather than forcing tough contested shots.   He's going to be able to play great with WCS and help him score in the paint with the p&r and lobs.  And with shooters like Gay, McLemore, and Benelli you guys will see your 3PT% increase with Rondo getting them great looks.  And I know everyone loves to bash his shooting, but he can actually knock down the 15-20 foot jump shot pretty consistently if people give it to him.  The FT% was weird, as he's always been poor, but not this poor.  He's statistically shot better in past years, so it should improve.  I'm really rooting for you guys to succeed.  He's really fun to watch and can make some incredible passes.  Not to mention he's incredible smart and knows at any given moment where any of his teammates are on the floor.  Hopefully he meshes well with the coaching staff and their able to work with him."

kings,3c1pfc,guy15s,4,Fri Jul 3 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"I think the talk about him being a cancer might be overblown. He can obviously be a problem, but if he plugs in, he was also a leader during one of the most chemistry-focused teams in recent history with the Celtics. I think he can really be a strong, binding force if he buys in. He's just really either/or, but if we can really get him involved, I think he'll put his heart and soul into this team. If not, he's a 1-year contract that we can trade for somebody safer but with a longer contract that somebody wants to get rid of, or we can look elsewhere next year. With DC waiting in the wings and Ray Mac not being that bad of a guy and working in the off season, I think we have the security to take the chance."

If this guy really wants to bounce back in the NBA..he's gonna want to work his ass off and improve his image. 50/50 he either does that for Image rehab, or for the money. My bet is on the image rehab. If it doesn't work out it's only one year and we have 10m free again next year."
kings,3c1pfc,pocketmonsters,7,Fri Jul 3 23:20:26 2015 UTC,Well if it is a complete train wreck it is at least an expiring contract. Not like the straight jacket we would be in if we shelled out 64 mil to a wes matthews that might not ever recover.

kings,3c1pfc,N1celyDunn,3,Sat Jul 4 00:22:10 2015 UTC,Believe what you want but they say that about cousins people don't know the situations these guys are in and only hear the media.. This is a high reward low risk move.. Just helps the squad.
kings,3c1pfc,ItsNotSpaghetti,2,Sat Jul 4 01:03:17 2015 UTC,"I don't buy the low risk high reward thing, he's still making 9.5 mil and what if he plays great? well he's getting a cutest to somewhere else and we'll be stuck looking for a replacement. He doesn't fit the offensive scheme of an up tempo offense and he CAN'T SHOOT THE BALL. I feel like we all forget that fact."
kings,3c1pfc,sketchy_crab,4,Sat Jul 4 00:12:07 2015 UTC,"100% agreed, and even if he does improve us, we'll lose our draft pick and then Rondo will bolt, leaving us with nothing."

kings,3c1pfc,N1celyDunn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:35:57 2015 UTC,Low risk because that money would get lost with not signing someone else.. You keep saying he can't shoot well the shooters we had struggled to shoot and couldn't do everything else he does.. If he doesn't work out we are still in the same position as last year.. If he somehow plays he way we should we are fine.. Remember they said cousins can't play in the system I don't believe in that..

kings,3c1pfc,ItsNotSpaghetti,3,Sat Jul 4 06:47:54 2015 UTC,"How could it be amazing? Seriously, I don't see a way this works out for us. He's a slow down PG in an up tempo offense who can't shoot the ball. What could be so amazing?"

kings,3c1pfc,ItsNotSpaghetti,5,Sat Jul 4 07:29:21 2015 UTC,"But with George Karl he doesn't want a half court offense, he wants a run and gun offense. So that already doesn't really make sense."

In one of those hands is a winner and in the other a dream. This team is built to be the most dominant defensive team in recent history.

kings,3c1pfc,ItsNotSpaghetti,4,Sat Jul 4 00:37:03 2015 UTC,"As nice as that'd be, I feel like Karl is stubborn enough that he tried to move Cousins to get his up tempo players he wanted. I feel like this can easily blow up in the teams face."

News flash 30 year olds who cannot shoot (he's a historically bad shooter) and have declining athleticism to get to the rim do NOT age well.

kings,3c1pfc,ZOOTV83,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:01:03 2015 UTC,"Celtics' fan checking in.  I'm sure you all know as well as any how much of a headache Rondo can be.  But my God when he is on, he is on.  He was never as moody and arrogant in Boston as he was in Dallas, so hopefully he will work out for you guys.  Here's to the 2020 Kings vs. Celtics finals."
kings,3c1pfc,_DrPepper_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:16:28 2015 UTC,How was he playing last season for boston? I look at the stats and he was a walking triple double before he went to Mavs so that's super promising for me. Was he playing like old Rondo or does he look a few shades off? Thanks!
kings,3c1pfc,ZOOTV83,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:37:54 2015 UTC,Last season he was so uninterested. He really struggled to shoot from everywhere on the court and sometimes it really just looked like he didn't care. Still not as bad as his time on the Mavs though. Hopefully since he can pass the ball to Boogie he'll be more aggressive.
kings,3c1pfc,RadRandy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:32:21 2015 UTC,"No matter what, we have increased our teams talent level and improved the roster over last season! Now resign casspi and sign a PF or C!"
kings,3c1pfc,dd2811,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:08:13 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal with Rondo.   As a Celts fan I've watched a lot of this guy, and when he wants to play he can turn it the eff on. He has the ability to dominate a game, but he often just doesn't. He has fantastic passing skills, is quick and runs a good offense. He's just a head case. Stubborn, cocky, anti social, often getting into conflict.   If Karl lets him run the offense and do his thing, and if Rondo can learn to keep quiet and do his job, you've got a great point guard. but those are big ifs. Regardless, it's a team friendly deal, so low risk, high reward for yall."
kings,3c1pfc,Narwhail0r,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:15:17 2015 UTC,The great thing about Karl is he lets his point-guards run the plays especially when he's running the 2 PG line-up. But will Karl and Rondo click?    ¯_(ツ)_/¯

I understand wanting to be able to maintain flexibility, but all the big fish are gone now, and we're never going to sign with the Kings anyway.  A good organization does right by its own, and the Kings need to show casspi some love."
kings,3c3ckj,WisteriaHysteria,2,Sat Jul 4 22:04:11 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Just offer the guy a reasonable $3 mil/year contract and everyone is happy. He's just the kind of player every team needs off the bench.
kings,3c3ckj,oh_peaches,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:06:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. Casspi had the same PER as Al-Farouq Aminu but put up more points and a higher offensive and defensive efficiency yet Aminu just received 7.5mil for 4 years to play in Portland.  Seeing as how he thrives in Karl's system and wants to be here he should get at least 3 years 10 mil or something similar. A veteran's minimum offer would be an insult.
kings,3c3ckj,tman916x,2,Sun Jul 5 00:08:41 2015 UTC,He will be back
kings,3c3ckj,yopeee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:27:47 2015 UTC,Sac loves him and he loves Sac. He'll be back for sure. Can't we wait and sign him with bird rights for cheaper and longer? (I'm not super well versed on bird rights so can someone answer that?)
kings,3c3ckj,4everpurple,2,Sat Jul 4 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Bird rights don't let you sign players cheaper, they let you go over the salary cap to re-sign free agents that have played excl for your team for the last 3 or more seasons.  edit: But I agree, he'll be back."

The difference would be that we wouldn't offer max, but could only offer 175% of his prior salary or 104.5% of the league average, whichever is higher. Does he qualify, though? Didn't we just get him last season?  Edit: also, I heard something about our MLE increasing to 5m if we hit the cap. Maybe this is what we're waiting for?"

He is one of the smartest players you'll see the only thing you should be worried about is how much control he gets. The problem with the mavs was that he couldn't really get comfortable with our offense especially with Ricks play calling and monta ISO ball here and there.   Rondo likes having the ball in almost every position, though this sounds like a bad thing, it is not. He is capable of making the smart choices, and it seems the Kings organization notices that especially since they went out and picked up a spot up shooter, Marco, at rondos request. I truly can't wait to see how this unfolds, personally reserving a seat in the bandwagon myself."

We don't need him to be the best player on the team, we need him to be a leader and do what he does best.  Super pumped to see how it plays out!"

kings,3c1xvg,-Hoopin-,3,Sat Jul 4 01:17:41 2015 UTC,What do you think about kosta koufos coming off the Kings bench? How much would he be? We wouldn't need too much from him since boogie and wcs will play a lot of minutes. But we still need to target a backup big man since we traded away jt and Landry. I like kosta as someone who can play 8-14 mins a game off the bench.
kings,3c1xvg,amblix,3,Sat Jul 4 01:23:18 2015 UTC,First comparison that popped into my head was Greg Ostertag. Not expected to put in a double double but if the bigs need a breather he could come in and provide some support.
kings,3c1xvg,Rocketz1Bruh,2,Sat Jul 4 02:15:22 2015 UTC,Jsmoove or Koufos + Casspi and all of the sidden we have a pretty deep roster.
kings,3c1xvg,blandrick,0,Sat Jul 4 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"I agree the Kings will be improved, but I didn't get the WCS pick at #6.  The Kings already have the best center in the NBA, and the NBA is going away from the tradition 2 big lineups. I think Winslow would have been a great pick instead of WCS. Should be interesting on how the Kings use him.  I said last year that the Kings should target Rondo. He is the perfect pg to pair with your 2 scorer's Cousins/Gay."
kings,3c1xvg,drp6,5,Sat Jul 4 02:27:00 2015 UTC,"He's a defensive juggernaut, even if he has issues offensively, he can give Boogie a break without causing the team to hemorrhage points. There may or may not have been better choices available, but the dude has the potential to be a DPOY candidate in time. Look at MKG, he's a starter based solely on the same factor-beastmode defense. Boogie could also play 4 if they wanted to play a big lineup, which is something WCS' mobility allows defensively. WCS potentially unlocks some pretty neat things, and I like the pick."
kings,3c1xvg,jkopecky,3,Sat Jul 4 03:58:41 2015 UTC,Honestly I think WCS could be one of the better players from this draft. I think he'll be able to put together a solid offensive game like ibaka

kings,3c0qwl,Arugon,2,Fri Jul 3 18:51:37 2015 UTC,"Watched his HL tape earlier.  He's got 2 different shots he can fire off.  He can fire fast with a hand in his face or if he has a second he can take like an extra .2 or .3 when acquiring the rim in his vision and drill the shots that really matter.  (His 2 point buckets during the 3 point competition for instance)  And when he creates for himself he can fire off a very Peja-esque, quick, short stroke, fall away jumper.  To top it off he's got some athleticism and can finish at the rim even when taking contact.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this signing and I was high on it just knowing he was a good spot up guy."

With that being said he is still a good player, he cuts really well off ball, is a great 3 point shooter and has mean pump fake. You guys will love him"
kings,3c0qwl,Dabawse26,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:11:48 2015 UTC,Interesting...I wonder why ESPN'S scouting report said different. His advanced defensive stats aren't that bad either.
kings,3c0qwl,matty25,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:34:12 2015 UTC,If he's on the court while WCS is on then it's not a problem. Our zone defense will compensate for any lack of D. His defense is a sure upgrade of Stauskas.
kings,3c0qwl,_DrPepper_,2,Sat Jul 4 09:38:49 2015 UTC,Macro has been proven to be a pretty good defender in two (admittedly very good) defensive systems (Bulls and Spurs). He's definitely coach-able on that end so as long as he's not expected to be stopping the other team's number one option man to man I think he'll do pretty well on that end... I'm hopeful Karl will put something decent in place for him to succeed.

kings,3c0qwl,gohstrifle,4,Fri Jul 3 18:48:31 2015 UTC,Truth
kings,3c0qwl,JamesBearded,2,Fri Jul 3 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely an upgrade day one, Nik has a bit more potential upside, but who knows if we'd have gotten it out of him... I'm skeptical that the 76ers will."
kings,3c0qwl,jkopecky,2,Fri Jul 3 20:12:50 2015 UTC,We had enough cap room before the trade.  We had 10 million in space and his deal is for an average of 6.3/year.
kings,3c0qwl,1000facedhero,2,Fri Jul 3 22:04:54 2015 UTC,"Right, but who says we're done??"
kings,3c0qwl,coachadam,2,Fri Jul 3 23:09:52 2015 UTC,I assume the FO isn't done but this is a move that could have been done regardless of the trade.  You cant really evaluate how good/bad the trade was based on a signing they could have done before the trade.
kings,3c0qwl,1000facedhero,2,Fri Jul 3 23:17:59 2015 UTC,How about now that Rondo just signed??
kings,3c0qwl,coachadam,2,Fri Jul 3 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"So we traded a 1st round pick, a 2nd year player with potential, a competent rotation big man on a fair contract and Carl Landry's corpse for the right to overpay a washed up Rondo on a 1 year deal.  I don't see the upside on the deal.  I don't envision a scenario where Rondo plays above a 10 million dollar level and if he plays like he did last year he isn't worth 5 million.  Since the deal is only 1 year he can bolt if he rehabilitates his reputation.  So we gave up picks and young prospects to chase the 8 seed for 1 year.  I'm not even sure if we can get the 8 in the west.  Portland isn't likely to make the playoffs but I think that puts us in a 4 way race with the Suns, Dallas and Utah for the 8 seed (OKC isn't going to be as injured)."
kings,3c0qwl,1000facedhero,0,Sat Jul 4 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"Stauskis is not a young prospect, he's the juice leaking out of a rotting corpse.  He's putrid, vile, human leakage.  We are trying to get out from under bad contracts left from the Pete D and Maloof past, and get rid of a wasted pick of a garbage ass dude with no balls."
kings,3c0qwl,EagleofFreedomsballs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:28:47 2015 UTC,"Did Stauskas fuck your sister or something?  He wasn't great in his rookie year but that isn't really that atypical for rookies.  And our only ""bad"" contract was Landry.  Most teams would kill for their worst contract being 2 years 13 million left.  Which if the Kings wanted to dump they could just have used the stretch provision on it making the hit only 2.6 million per year."
kings,3c0qwl,1000facedhero,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:17:50 2015 UTC,Jason Thompson is also terrible.  And for how bad he was on the offensive end his contract sucked too.
kings,3c0qwl,EagleofFreedomsballs,4,Sat Jul 4 06:29:52 2015 UTC,Nik will be better than Belinelli for sure in the future. For now - as we try to contend - Marco is better than Nik.
kings,3c0qwl,Ethanhekker,15,Fri Jul 3 18:54:14 2015 UTC,Let's revisit this in 2-3 years.. T-Rob just signed to Brooklyn for the minimum and Jimmer is still looking for a spot around the league.
kings,3c0qwl,sdotgarcia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:02:36 2015 UTC,Jimmer ain't Nik dude. Nik plays better defense now (and Nik is an average defender) than Jimmer has in his whole career.
kings,3c0qwl,Ethanhekker,2,Fri Jul 3 19:08:48 2015 UTC,And both cant shoot for shit.
kings,3c0qwl,Whyyougankme,5,Fri Jul 3 19:16:57 2015 UTC,dude wtf are you talking about? Nik went through 3 coaching systems. He shot 44% from three (or something) in Karl's system. You all agreed with me before he was traded...
kings,3c0qwl,Ethanhekker,8,Fri Jul 3 19:25:59 2015 UTC,I never did. Mclemore shot better from 3 than stauskas did from the field. I hated the stauskas pick the second i saw it and i knew it wouldnt work out.  He was a terrible rookie and im glad hes gone.
kings,3c0qwl,Whyyougankme,3,Fri Jul 3 19:29:30 2015 UTC,i agree with this. mad we passed on elfrid
kings,3c0qwl,adriantada,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:56:37 2015 UTC,Stauskas shot 36.5% from the field his rookie year. McLemore shot 37.6%. What a difference eh?
kings,3c0qwl,cssher,3,Fri Jul 3 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"Mclemore shot 35.8 from 3 and 43.7 from the field.  I thought stauskas shot 35.5 not 36.5, but still it's pretty pathetic from stauskas.  Just because mclemore drastically improved doesn't mean that stauskas will improve.  We just had no reason to pick him last year anyways so I don't mind that he's gone, and now we have belineeli who is a far superior version of stauskas."
kings,3c0qwl,Whyyougankme,0,Fri Jul 3 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"McLemore started out the same way Stauskas did, and McLemore only had one coach the whole time. Look where McLemore is now."
kings,3c0qwl,Ethanhekker,5,Fri Jul 3 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"Slow it down just a bit. Nik had a cool nikname, but his defense was atrocious, and just because one guy vastly improved in his second year doesn't make it some universal truth. Who knows, maybe you're right and he'll turn into some amazing sharpshooter someday. But it wasn't going to be today, and we got a sharpshooter today."
kings,3c0qwl,NightWriter500,0,Fri Jul 3 19:39:54 2015 UTC,I'd like to see any stat or scouting report that says Nik is an average defender. He's well below average.
kings,3c0qwl,wehopeuchoke,7,Sat Jul 4 06:26:56 2015 UTC,It's a fraction of the cost of what it would've taken for Matthews and he comes from a team that epitomizes winning culture.
kings,3c0qwl,tman916x,3,Fri Jul 3 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's big next season, but fair price for the last two years given the expected salary cap rise. Proportional to the salary cap it's like a $4million contract now (which I think is fair)."

I'd like to see us toss some money at Biyombo, 5-6 million should bring him here.  Rondo/McLemore/Gay/Cousins/WCS  Collison/Bellinelli/Casspi/???/Biyombo  Would be about as good a roster as we could have hoped for going into this free agency shenanigans... obviously there's a huge risk in counting on Rondo, but he has every incentive to give whoever he plays for his best so if there's anything left in him we'll get it, and we have a proven player in Collison to fall back on if there isn't."

kings,3c0qwl,Narwhail0r,-2,Fri Jul 3 19:25:15 2015 UTC,So we trade away Stauskas + extras to clear cap room to bring in Belinelli which is essentially the same type of player but more expensive. Not sure I understand this logic.  Good shooters that are a liability on defense. I don't know if I see this as an upgrade.
kings,3c0qwl,earlston,11,Fri Jul 3 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"He's the same type of player as Nik, except he's proven he's good at basketball."
kings,3c0qwl,Bear1727,4,Fri Jul 3 20:13:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Bellinelli could start on a lot of teams and is WAY above average as a backup 2-guard (the same could probably be said of Ben) this makes us much deeper on the wings.   Nik's a guy with a lot of upside but no certainty whatsoever that he's going to even hack it as a rotational guy. I believe he will, but if we're really trying to win now this is a huge upgrade."

kings,3c0qwl,adriantada,3,Fri Jul 3 22:01:09 2015 UTC,"We brought in a more proven commodity who is an upgrade right now over Nik, and we still have room to sign 2-3 more players, including Casspi resigning.."
kings,3c0qwl,coachadam,2,Fri Jul 3 23:13:27 2015 UTC,Scout report on him say he's not that bad on Defense. Not by any means great.  Not to mention he's got two years under Coach pop. That experience could always help us.
