You look super cute! Also, you've got an awesome figure going on.  I would sacrifice my firstborn child to have your incredible sense of fashion.  I looooooove the new hair color.

I, for example, didn't have a ton of hair pre-HRT, and am now mostly completely hairless except a few strays here and there and then everything on my face and neck (nothing changed there)."
transtimelines,3e50d7,Khelek41,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"I don't have any pictures, but I can tell you what happened. I have been on HRT for 15 months and it now takes three weeks what used to take one day for growth. That's right. I shave my legs every 3 weeks when I used to shave them every day. My arm hair is virtually non existent. Just tiny blond vellus hairs that I never shave anymore. My arms used to have a very long dark brown hair growing on them. That's all totally gone. No changes to the face. Hair still very much grows there. It's all blond, but that is because of laser hair removal. All the dark hairs got zapped. The blond hair on my face is still rather course which annoys the heck out of me. Chest hair are the same as my arms. Tiny blond vellus. Back hair is no longer existent.  I used to be a hairy beast. Not so much anymore, much to the jealousy of my sisters...  Results vary between individuals so you can't really take my experience and think that you'll be the same because you may not be. But ya. I hope that helps."

You should see regrowth (if the follicles aren't completely dead). Adding in something like rogain might also help, since it's mechanism of action is different from Fin/blockers."

I'm sure the fluctuating hormones that your body is getting used to has something to do with your weight gain.  Once your body gets more used to the hormones then you should be able to drop some weight.  I know what its like to have some messed up hormones and have it wreak havoc on your weight.  I do have to say though, that from theses pictures you can't tell at all that you've gained weight.  It seems like the opposite from the last three or four pictures.  Either way, keep your head up, you do look great!!!!!"

I totally get why you're doing it, I used to do the same when I wasn't really sure how to get it to be proportionate, but you'll find hard to find a cis woman your weight has breasts remotely that big. They're actually massive. Maybe if you were very overweight (you don't seem to be) they would seem more proportionate. The majority of women really don't have anything anywhere near that big other than a few outliers. You're doing a really great job especially for someone who's pre-HRT, but I'd say that they're not doing you too many favours, because when they're that big they just attract attention to you and look suspicious / fake."
transtimelines,3dp110,Vathoska,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I really appreciate it. Actually, they're breast forms and only a D. They just look massive in this picture, I think. I actually am pretty overweight, I just wore a top that I think hides the fact. I'm about 80 pounds heavier than I should be for my age and height. And that's for the male average. :/ however, I'll definitely keep your advice in mind.   Edit: spelling and such."

transtimelines,3dfclf,CorruptPixie,9,Wed Jul 15 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"My progress photos so far. I started losing weight back in November of last year when I learned I finally had doctor in my area who would help me start HRT. I went slowly at first, I started going to a gym and doing 20 minutes on a recumbent bike. As time went on I increased the time, resistance and speed. I still ate what I usually did, but  slowly changed out things I ate for healthier options and portions.   In February, I went to the doctor for the first time and was put on 200mg Spironolactone. While waiting for my tests I added walking to my daily routine (keeping up the biking at the gym). After a lot of thought and soul searching, I came to the conclusion I was addicted to unhealthy food. I cut out eating out entirely. At that point the weight was starting to fall off. I always made sure I had enough calories and my macros and nutrients were right where they needed to be. I was concerned I was losing to fast, but my doctor has been monitoring me and I am in the best shape of my life.  In March, I went back and was prescribed 6mg of Estroidal. I changed my morning workout to three days of HIIT on the recumbent bike and two days of cardio/endurance. I have ever been increasing the pace and distance in my walks.  I have been refining ever since. Learning how to eat out in a healthy way and ever moving to new and healthier options.   I love the results. This is the best I have felt in my entire life. I am moving on to laser hair removal this month and always working on my voice, makeup skills and a dozen other small things. I am so excited about what the future will bring!"

If I may be so bold I'd like to suggest getting yourself a nice high quality bicycle now or in the future and go on rides in your area and explore. I've found that it's wonderful to get out and explore and take in the scenery while also getting the exercise. I went from riding to the corner store and back to 20-30 mile rides around town.

transtimelines,3dftie,meganpdx,5,Thu Jul 16 02:08:07 2015 UTC,I am so happy you just said that because my shoulders are something that are really dysphoric for me.  I've always done a lot of cardio/running so that didn't really change from pre transition.  I did do some leg exercises for a while (only legs nothing else) but swapped that out for yoga about a month ago.  I think the main thing has been cutting my protein intake way down.  I basically went vegetarian (but I will still eat meat occasionally on the weekends...I still crave buffalo wings all the time) and I am just generally conscious about how much protein I am getting.  It kind of sucks because I love long distance running but my times have gotten a lot worse and I can't run as long with such low protein.
transtimelines,3dftie,flopsflip,2,Thu Jul 16 02:31:50 2015 UTC,"so I wasn't the only one who noticed those hips. By the way, there are plenty of common vegetables that are higher in protein than meat if you're trying to monitor your intake. Broccoli raabs, pak choi, cauliflower, white mushrooms, and of course legumes are all pretty high up there."

transtimelines,3d94mb,MissHalina,6,Tue Jul 14 14:01:48 2015 UTC,I'm glad you were invited to the wedding. I hope it's a sign you are still close to your family.
transtimelines,3d94mb,RobinCalls,8,Tue Jul 14 14:15:00 2015 UTC,I am still close with all of them.  I was actually really surprised by how supportive my friends and family were (with the exception of a few) through the whole process.

transtimelines,3d94mb,mickelle1,4,Tue Jul 14 16:47:40 2015 UTC,My wife and I are going to renew our vows and re-do pictures with twice the brides if I transition. You look fantastic! Very womanly. May I ask if it was just HRT (and I suppose hair removal)? I'm mainly wondering if everyone eventually gets FFS because it seems really popular but I hope to not need it.
transtimelines,3d94mb,mickelle1,3,Tue Jul 14 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't had FFS yet, but I'm planning on having it eventually."

transtimelines,3clj4f,ZelkyZo,5,Wed Jul 8 21:41:46 2015 UTC,Hnngghhh this is really good but it also makes me feel really bad.  D:  I really want to see how well I can feminize myself before HRT and I do have sisters that can help but I feel like there's no way I can get myself to look decent even though I have (I think anyway) a good face.  I even have longer shoulder length hair!  The skillz are just not there!  D:  Maybe you could give some advice/tips/pointers to a novice?  :D
transtimelines,3clj4f,broff,7,Wed Jul 8 23:19:21 2015 UTC,"Time, practice, research and patience are all really important. Work with makeup. A lot... Like Im still not what I'd call good at it. putting on eyeliner well is sorcery as far as Im concerned.  Other then that its also important to know what your goals are and work towards them. r/makeupaddiction is worth having a peak at. And if you are comfortable with it. Go to Ulta or Sephora or any place that does makeovers. For the most part the people who work there won't bat an eye at someone coming in and asking for help. I've been lucky enough to schmooz with some ulta girls and they've helped me out/hooked me up so much."
transtimelines,3clj4f,caerul,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"Ah I was afraid of that.  D:  Considering I am starting completely from scratch, I've got a huge mountain to climb.  :(  Ugh having social anxiety on top of it all makes it so much harder too.  Oh well.  :)  I'm going to have to rely on my sisters to give me the boost I need.  Thanks for replying though!  :)  It's all pretty scary stuff for me but I have to start somewhere."
transtimelines,3clj4f,ZelkyZo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:40:59 2015 UTC,My male friend's husband works at sephora and he's non-binary so I'm confident they will treat everyone well.
transtimelines,3clj4f,caerul,3,Thu Jul 9 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"Gonna disagree with the majority here and just say wait for HRT, unless there's a reason you can't get access to hormones for a long time. There's no rush, and you'll probably hate any pictures of yourself taken during that period a year from now when hormones have actually worked their mojo on you."
transtimelines,3clj4f,ZelkyZo,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"There's that chance, but I want to see how good I can look without any hormones.  If I can look almost or completely female with a good makeup and eyebrow job before, I'll be going into HRT with tons more confidence with myself and this decision.  Plus, the earlier I can practice the more time I'll have to learn the ropes of the mysterious world of cosmetics.  :)  It's more so I can affirm that this is what I really want.  I know that I have a decent face so I'm fairly confident I won't be disgusted by the results.  If anything it'll feel a bit awkward but that's peanuts compared to seeing how accurately I can pull off a female appearance prior to hormones."
transtimelines,3clj4f,kylatron9000,4,Thu Jul 9 00:11:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Beware making yourself look like a stereotype with cosmetics, though. The less makeup you can get away with, the better -- ain't nobody got time for going all out with makeup to go to walmart, so when someone sees you decked out with foundation and everything else they try to figure out what's up. That's how you get clocked. Fuck it, I can't be bothered doing more than eyeliner most days anyway, if even that."
transtimelines,3clj4f,Chelsea_J,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:26:33 2015 UTC,Yup that will come with practice.  Plus I'm hoping my sisters will be able to coach me up and help me find a balance.  :)

transtimelines,3cfl1b,mistselkie,5,Tue Jul 7 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"I love that name, sounds just cute to me. If I lived in an english speaking country I'd pick it for me, but Emilia just does not have the same ring to it."
transtimelines,3cfl1b,em1lyelizabeth,4,Tue Jul 7 20:56:52 2015 UTC,I... I don't know what I've done!! There's too many of us!
transtimelines,3cfl1b,_dEm,5,Wed Jul 8 01:30:38 2015 UTC,One of us! One of us!

transtimelines,3cfl1b,Carricre,3,Tue Jul 7 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"That brings up a question I've been meaning to ask. When selecting my first bra, what do I go for at first? I mean, I don't ""need"" it yet, so I have really nothing to fill a proper bra. I know some wear a bra to give themselves a more feminine silhouette when starting out. Still, I have no idea what I should buy or do."
transtimelines,3cfl1b,bamberjean,3,Tue Jul 7 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"I use a demi bra in a comfortable size. If you've got nothing to speak of in the boob department, just a half cup could work. How far along are you?"

Did you find that as they grew the bra you wore helped shape them?  If so, tips?  Avoid pushups?  Wear a cup size bigger?  I mean... clothes can literally shape the girl (woman)."
transtimelines,3cfl1b,HeadBandHalo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"Now that I'm thinking about it, wearing a bra might not help shape them, but it definitely keeps your nipples from poking out of your shirt! Plus it feels good and looks quite a bit more feminine. Try it out, you would be suprised how much of a difference wearing one makes to how you feel about yourself. And no, I doubt you would need a pushup right away."
transtimelines,3cfl1b,split_chickadee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:36:03 2015 UTC,I honestly would try to find a nice store where a pro can help you. Somewhere where they do bra fitting. Push up adds volume. Don't get too big in cup sizes it won't look good. It definitely is a nice thing to wear :-). Makes many women feel more fem!
transtimelines,3cfl1b,SyCottic,6,Wed Jul 8 12:36:15 2015 UTC,It's really kinda cool how there's a clear line in there where your smiles become more genuine.

transtimelines,3cfl1b,bamberjean,2,Tue Jul 7 22:21:52 2015 UTC,You are rockin the look and I hope every time you look in the mirror you crack a big smile :)  On a more serious note though...one of the pictures shows you in the hospital and I was wondering if you would share the story. I'm quite nervous about the prospect of being admitted for something and getting stuck with inept doctors unable to wrap around the being trans thing.
transtimelines,3cfl1b,drawingredreams,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"Well, thank you! It was actually my second stay at the same hospital. The first stay was 3 days for behavioral health. And they were wonderful. They insisted on using my correct name. The gender thing took them about a day to inform the staff members to use she/her pronouns. But that was okay because I was pretty out of it when I arrived. The second stay from the picture was for an appendectomy. My surgeon and nursing staff were wonderful. Again insisting on my chosen name, and the surgeon and physician's assistant informed everyone I might have contact with about my pronouns after just taking a look at my perscriptions. This was at a small hospital in a very conservative area in a state without specific discrimination protections (Ohio). The very best thing to remember is just to be kind and courteous to your staff. A little friendliness goes a long way; not to mention that you may be the first trans* person they've ever encountered (I know I was) and we should try to set a good example. But you should expect them to act professionally. But I wouldn't worry about it. The worst thing that could happen is that maybe someone makes a snide remark behind your back. Personally, I feel safer in the hospital than just walking down the street. I hope that answers your question!"
transtimelines,3cfl1b,glitter_box,2,Wed Jul 8 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"I'm so very, very glad. It's a really scary idea of putting your life in other people's hands not knowing how they will treat you. Yay Ohio!"

transtimelines,3cehj6,sarahbrissa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:18:37 2015 UTC,Ugh. Let me tell you about my love/hate relationship with my straightener. I love that it straightens my hair. I hate that it takes half an hour and it still isn't that straight. Oh and what color? I can't wait to get mine long enough when I can start coloring it. That thought makes me way more giddy than it should lol.
transtimelines,3cek73,IamAprilLee,3,Tue Jul 7 08:18:02 2015 UTC,"For me, stepping outside my house for the very 1st time was the biggest moment in my transition. I knew that if I could find enough courage to step out that door, that my life wouldn't never be the same. What a year it has been. I lost another 25 pounds during that time. A year ago, I had to put on a ridiculously short clubbing dress to feel like a girl. Now I can do that equally well with a tank top and jeans. A year ago, it would take me over two hours to do my makeup. Now I am happy with what I do in about 20 minutes.   April's Tweets"
transtimelines,3cek73,flopsflip,2,Tue Jul 7 08:22:34 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the milestone. I'm just starting my journey and know what you mean about the time and work it can take to feel feminine in a tank top and jeans, or god forbid a t shirt. In those times, I remind myself that my cis-mother rarely wears anything other than a t shirt and jeans and looks just as awkward as I do in a dress. I hope your second year brings just as much progress."

transtimelines,3cdiy2,newtype06,3,Tue Jul 7 21:38:20 2015 UTC,Oh yeah anything that is similar face-wise is stuff too ambiguous to out yourself to former acquaintances.

transtimelines,3c6qp6,gwillyn,17,Sun Jul 5 11:19:02 2015 UTC,USENET and blind obsessed determination. I was particularly lucky in that my family owned a small business and my father saw my brother and I as cheap labor. So I had money.
transtimelines,3c6qp6,friendsKnowMyMain,8,Sun Jul 5 11:25:16 2015 UTC,When did you parents find out? Where they supportive? If you don't mind me asking that is.
transtimelines,3c6qp6,friendsKnowMyMain,15,Sun Jul 5 15:25:08 2015 UTC,I told them at 12. They said it was probably due to trauma and took me to my therapist again. I realized it would probably never get anywhere this way so I lied to get out of more therapy. So when my parents found out I was about 17 and had already been on them for 3 years. They were....pissed. I think is a good word. Livid is probably far more appropriate.
transtimelines,3c6qp6,friendsKnowMyMain,5,Sun Jul 5 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry they weren't very open to helping you. I'm super amazed that you were able to make it happen on your own!  So it sounds like they found out on their own, and not that you choose to tell them :(.   Have they come around these days?"
transtimelines,3c6qp6,guisar,9,Sun Jul 5 18:41:27 2015 UTC,Yeah they found out because I ended up in the hospital due to an accident at high school. They knew something was up when they saw me in the hospital gown and everyone on staff was referring to me as she her and your daughter...woops.   They finally came around...it took ten years of us all being estranged from each other but now we have a really good relationship.

transtimelines,3c6qp6,ToTallyNikki,4,Sun Jul 5 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"oh my god, going on hormones DIY at 14 years old without telling your parents and pulling that off for 3 years is quite literally the dictionary definition of badass. how the heck did they not realize it?? you look extremely fem in your pic of 17 years old and boobs are pretty hard to hide!!"
transtimelines,3c6qp6,fartzoane,3,Tue Jul 7 02:20:33 2015 UTC,"Cognitive dissidence is a hell of a thing. I found out later they saw changes, but they thought I was just going through puberty later. My family is rather private, we don't show skin around each other, and I tended to take showers later at night (small water heater) because I really liked taking long hot showers. The boobs were concealable due to the times.  It was the grunge alternative era where flannel shirts, baggy clothes and layers were all the rage. I don't really see it as badass, it was me surviving the only way I knew how."
transtimelines,3c6qp6,Elfking88,12,Tue Jul 7 05:44:55 2015 UTC,It is nice to see a timeline from a person on HRT for so long.  Too bad you had to have orchi done in shady place.

transtimelines,3c6qp6,Elfking88,2,Sun Jul 5 12:21:28 2015 UTC,Can I ask why it was shady?  I've considered going to a doc who doesn't ask many questions and just sorta does it in his office for about $2k.  Others seem to be happy with the results though.
transtimelines,3c6qp6,TickleMafia,6,Sun Jul 5 22:26:11 2015 UTC,I question whether he had a medical license and if he did was it valid or had he lost it. It wasn't performed at an office but an apartment that he looked like he had partially converted.

transtimelines,3c6qp6,bakw00ds,4,Mon Jul 6 06:37:36 2015 UTC,It removes the testes. The testes are the primary testosterone production centers of the body. So it makes it so I don't need to use T-Blockers anymore.

transtimelines,3c6qp6,HDZombieSlayerTV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"Because sometimes people don't, and then they instantly regret it. You will never get in trouble by offering to buy a goon a beer."

transtimelines,3c6qp6,Imtired101,2,Mon Jul 6 01:52:40 2015 UTC,"The sexism isn't too overt. It's more unconscious stuff. I was a speaker at blackhat last year and kept getting asks who I was sales/recruiting for. Or at defcon where people presume you're a girlfriend (until I talk and they realize I work as a pen tester and know a heap more technically than they do).   It changes when I break stealth. But you know, treated like a girl or treated like one of the guys... Win some lose some...  Being married to a woman scares off a lot of annoyances too."
transtimelines,3c6qp6,Imtired101,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yikes, that's a bummer. Gotta be a good feeling though when they underestimate you and then you see their realization of being outclassed lol."

transtimelines,3c0tan,JessmichelleH,3,Fri Jul 3 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"Very cute! Great progress! If I might make one suggestion I think a nice subtle eyebrow wax or pluck would do wonders to open up your face/make it so we could see your eyes. I have big eyebrows too and I don't like the look of those weird little baby eyebrows, but a minor pluck/or shape up can change your whole face. Honestly you look great regardless and so so much more happy!!"
transtimelines,3c0tan,bamberjean,3,Fri Jul 3 23:20:13 2015 UTC,My eyebrows are my Everest.  I sculpt them all the time.  They are a little thick now.  They are always a work in progress. I still work as a guy so I can't go all diva.  Marylin Monroe is what I'm going for

It's Ok I'm presentable as Laverne cox would say just not passable by societies standards but who cares.  I'm healthy, happy, loved, and loving. Maybe one day I will but I'm not holding my breath. Uncanny valley for life yo;)"

transtimelines,3blew2,essenoh2you,6,Tue Jun 30 04:14:46 2015 UTC,Your facial changes have been remarkable.  I think you went from androgynous to full on guy.
transtimelines,3blew2,wannabe_pixie,3,Tue Jun 30 16:33:35 2015 UTC,My T must be broken. I've barely changed at all and I'm a good few months ahead! Great progress!
transtimelines,3blew2,dontmindmyboobs,2,Tue Jun 30 15:29:14 2015 UTC,I looked at your older submission and you've definitely changed a lot! I do have the upper hand on you in terms of facial hair. :P http://imgur.com/a/9KVUQ

They're not flattering at all but I wanted to show my rock bottom point vs now.   Dysphoria depression was really bad and I just didn't care about maintaining myself anymore. HRT changed everything and I feel so much happier now. It's been a total rollercoaster, but I finally feel like I can start living my life."

transtimelines,3bj8rw,oicu81shoe,4,Mon Jun 29 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"Everyone is complementing your hair, and I agree with them, and I gotta ask: What have you done with your hair to make it that great?  I mean, for one thing the hairline is totally changed!  Is that from HRT alone, or did you do the transplant thing?  How long does your hair routine take?  It's really amazing!"
transtimelines,3bj8rw,ProfitPenguin,2,Tue Jun 30 06:42:56 2015 UTC,"HRT helped a lot in that regard (Especially Avodart / Dutasteride) but I still use extensions for extra body, length, and fullness.  Also quitting smoking made a HUGE difference in my life. It was causing my hair to fall out and aging to accelerate. Quitting + HRT helped to reverse that."

transtimelines,3bjjof,Xruuruu,6,Mon Jun 29 19:55:27 2015 UTC,Those curves!
transtimelines,3bjjof,Xruuruu,8,Mon Jun 29 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"For some reason I was born with really wide set hips, a tiny waist, and the boobs are growing really fast, but I payed the price for it with brow bone and nose from hell."
transtimelines,3bjjof,Xruuruu,2,Mon Jun 29 21:27:37 2015 UTC,Not sure how to tell my waist size but my hips align roughly with the edge of my shoulders kind of like yours and with no HRT.  But yeah the face scares the hell out of me (my face not yours lol).  I took some side shots of my face this morning because  was already worried and it was just a MASSIVE depression bomb.  :( :( :(  Urgh....  :( :( :(
transtimelines,3bjjof,Chelsea_J,2,Mon Jun 29 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"Most of my dysphoria comes from my face, so transitioning has been rough for me because of how badly I need FFS. A good old side shot can really ruin a good day. :("

transtimelines,3bjjof,Xruuruu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:49:46 2015 UTC,"Well you'd be surprised how much the size of your rib cage and waist can be muscle. Now that my T is in female range, I've been doing a ton of cardio 5 times a week and the muscle seems to be coming off a bit."

I'm around your age and 5 months in and stuggling with my endo to push me up to female range :( Btw you look amazing! If you keep on that track I'll be so jealous of you ;)
transtimelines,3bjjof,imightnotbeanyone,3,Tue Jun 30 05:00:28 2015 UTC,"So at my 4 month checkup my T was 560, then I started taking my titty skittles sublingualy. For my 7 month checkup my T was 40. My place doesn't track our E levels directly but do so by checking prolactin levels. There's also good lighting, laser hair removal, light makeup, lots of cardio, and very low calorie diet invested in these pics."

My dad living in Mexico has threatened to kill himself by drinking himself to death. It hurts... A lot. But at the same time I know that that's HIS decision to react badly. It's not my fault nor am I responsible. It may seem cold but I'm entitled to a happy life and make it so. I hope that things work out for you!

transtimelines,3bed86,myusernameisthis1234,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"It feels amazing. I don't think it changes your personality too much, but I can say for a fact that I'm more emotional and I'm feeling more complete.  I lost 20 lbs. in the past three months, quit a pack a day smoking habit, and stopped drinking to excess all the time. Self-acceptance has done wonders and hormones certainly help as well. Also, I have real, actual boobs growing in, which is wild!"

transtimelines,3b48ik,Igotantinmypant,3,Fri Jun 26 07:40:17 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about that. I know you want to see changes asap but they don't appear at the same time for everyone.   For me, I didn't saw much until 10-12 months of HRT and experienced a lot of changes around 12-15 months. Keep in mind that you are looking at yourself everyday, that make it hard to see them.  But there is differences. Your skin is much better looking, your cheeks are rounder and you are smiling in that last picture! You might want to trim your brows a little thinner and let the titties skittles do their job!"
transtimelines,3b48ik,moonpotion,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:45:18 2015 UTC,What were the first things you noticed in the 10 - 12 month period? And yes I'm smiling much more in my life now. Having the correct hormones in your body does that hihi :)
transtimelines,3b48ik,moonpotion,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:55:29 2015 UTC,"Fat redistribution especially in my face, I went from AA to B cup, most body hair stop growing and etc."
transtimelines,3b48ik,NordicFairy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting, for me the first big thing I notice is that my arm hair reduced in density, grows much slower and very fine white hairs now. The same happened to my chest to a lesser extend, chest hair reduced by about 75% I think."
transtimelines,3b48ik,NordicFairy,3,Sat Jun 27 22:27:14 2015 UTC,I see changes in the roundness of your cheekbone areas that read as girly to me. And that's just four months in!
transtimelines,3b48ik,Amy_co106,2,Thu Jun 25 22:48:57 2015 UTC,Seems like my cheekbone area changed a bit based on comments in this thread. I don't see it though :/ How are they different?
transtimelines,3b48ik,tt5969,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:54:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm... If you imagine a line between your pupil and the corner of your mouth in the most recent picture, that line would pass through the approximate center of the new softness/roundness of your cheekbone. In earlier pictures, this area is flatter and more angular. Currently that softness to the cheekbone gives a decidedly female cast to your features. You're looking quite pretty :)"
transtimelines,3b48ik,raerae_onelove,2,Fri Jun 26 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation, last night I looked in the mirror with your notes in hand and I did notice some changes :)"

It's such a hard reality to live in, she should never have had to leave her dream job for this, to be who she really was. This is a heartache on all of trans people as the success of several celebrity trans people will undoubtedly far over shadow the stories like this that the public really needs to see. Yes I'm proud of and happy for Laverne Cox and Ms. Jenner but, the world seems to think the world is all of a sudden a different place now.  Most public opinion on trans people hasn't changed. Were still spat on by most, refused employment and fair treatment, rejected by even the government there to protect us. Nothing is different, and this wonderful beautiful woman's story is a very important one. Drove to death for no reason other than she was being herself. Fuck this society, I'm so sick of seeing all the people I love and look up to be neglected untill they can't take it anymore. If this country ever wakes up you can bet I'll be front row for the riots and demonstrations."

Maybe it's that my eyes are smiling. :P The first pic, I made many attempts and ended up with only one picture that I was satisfied with - it's hard to tell but i'm wearing eyeliner and i pencilled in my eyebrows. The second pic was first try, nomakeup nofilter :) So it's true, I really am changing! I wonder how long until people really start to notice ... XD  edit: I am currently 28."

I felt really isolated in my head for a long time, until one morning I was packing my bag to head home from a trip and I realized that I felt like a man forced to dress as a woman everyday. I was so tired of pretending. That's when it hit me that trans applied to me, it was a real eye-opener. I told my husband a few days later. It was really hard for him, but he accepted that it was a part of me and how I felt. I hope you find that support in your life and continue on your path to becoming you."

transtimelines,3ahdyy,tumblrbae,6,Sat Jun 20 06:49:16 2015 UTC,Thanks! I appreciate it :-). I completely underestimated how much transition would change things emotionally for me. I'm so much calmer and more centered now.
transtimelines,3ahdyy,tumblrbae,4,Sat Jun 20 12:58:24 2015 UTC,Great timeline! You look so happy! We're the same age and I'm starting HRT in the next couple weeks -- how quickly have you been noticing changes? Everyone talks about 25 being the end of male puberty and stuff slowing down after that but I'm not sure how true that is or how big a difference it could make between 25 and 26.
transtimelines,3ahdyy,transgnyc,7,Sat Jun 20 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! Now, that's a loaded question, and this is gonna be a long winded response :-P. I'm in a slightly different boat since I didn't have the typical ""start of HRT"" experience. As I mentioned in the timeline, I'm pre-diabetic. I asked the endo I see for my insulin issues whether he treats trans patients. He said yes. I thought it'd be nice to have one endo who keeps an eye on the whole picture. Anyway, at my first appt, he prescribed a super small dose of estrogen to be taken orally twice a day and no T-blockers. I questioned the no T-blockers thing, but he said he that often he finds that most people don't need them. I was dubious, but I went with it. Over the first three months, I noticed a SLIGHT softening in my face, and my nipples got more sensitive but no actual breast tissue growth. When I went for my follow up, my endo just gave me a new prescription and still no T-blockers. I asked him where my levels were at. He looked at them for what SEEMED to be the first time, and he said, your estrogen levels are slightly elevated. Then I asked where my T levels were, he said they were exactly the same. He still refused to change my prescription. So, needless to say, I made an appt with a new endo. She did blood work, and in the meantime put me on spiro and told me to keep taking the e I had been previously prescribed. Then in two weeks I'd come back, she'd go over the blood work, and she'd give me a prescription more tailored to me. I went back, she told me my levels were nowhere near the range we want to see them in, she kept my spiro the same and put me on injections once a week. After I started the injections, within a week I started to get legit breast budding. Over the last 3 months on the injections, my ass and hips have grown like crazy. Also, body hair is def starting to thin out and my skin is WAY softer. Also I smell totally different. I no longer have that musky male smell, I smell almost floral. Breast growth is sloooooowwwww. Also, I have not yet had much diminishment in muscle mass. I was never all that muscular, but my arms and pecs are more muscly looking then I'd like them to be.  Now, as for the 25 thing. All of that stuff is anecdotal. I really think HRT is a, your mileage may vary, sorta thing. Also a lot of it depends on your starting point. If you're 6'3"", bald, muscular, and hairy, in all likelihood, it'll take longer for you to reach the thresh hold of being read as female all the time than someone who's 5'7"" waifish and already feminine. And neither of those things have anything to do with how old you are. Also, for example, I've had very slow and very little breast growth. But I have major butt/hips/thigh growth. Meanwhile I have a friend who started HRT in her late 30s, her boobs grew to a full D Cup on HRT alone, but barely any difference in overall body shape. I think the 25 thing is not so much the efficacy of hormones, but it's that the biologically male body continues to masculinize as it ages well after puberty. So I think it's an issue of, the older you are, it's likely that the more there is to reverse, and the more there is that may not be reversible at all. For example, I almost came out as trans and transitioned when I was 18. I still kick myself over that, because I feel like my body went from a smaller boy body to a man body around the age of 22-25. But already more of that has reversed than I was expecting it to. Also, I can't stress this enough, PRIORITIZE FACIAL HAIR REMOVAL. It does wonders for feminizing the face.  Basically, my biggest piece of advice is, your mileage may vary. And it's a long sloooow process. Remember, puberty takes years to complete, and you're sending yourself through a second one. Often I feel like nothing is happening, because the changes day to day are so small and incremental you barely notice them. I only notice when I make a timeline like this and see photos spanning months apart. SO take lotsa photos, and be patient, and when you feel like nothing is happening, take a look at those and you'll realize you've come further than you think."

transtimelines,3ahdyy,GildedLily16,3,Sat Jun 20 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"you look absolutely amazing!  congratulations! has dating gone any better for you now that you're transitioning?  I can relate because I came out as ""gay"" when I was 16 as well...but i always felt like a female when I was with men and I really wanted to be treated as such.  They didn't get it :("
transtimelines,3ahdyy,GildedLily16,3,Sun Jun 21 04:40:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I went through the exact same issue. And sex was always super uncomfortable for me, because I had ZERO desire to use what I had going on, and being the receptive partner wasn't much better, because I desperately wanted to have sex as a woman. But even more than sex I wanted to relate to the guy I was with as a woman in a straight relationship. The dynamic of trying to be a gay man with another man, it just didn't make sense to me.  I haven't dated at all since starting transition. I wanted to take the time to get to know myself as the real me before I start adding someone else into the mix. That said, I've noticed that my relationships with straight men, from platonic to flirty, make way more sense to me... If that makes any sense... So I assume, the difficulties of dating straight man while trans aside, that when I do start dating, it will feel way more right to me."
transtimelines,3ahdyy,ishii,3,Sun Jun 21 04:50:52 2015 UTC,"You are SO gorgeous. The photoshoot pic and the GoT premier in particular you look like you were born female. I am female and not trans, but I kinda wanna go on estrogen and Spiro so I can become prettier haha."

transtimelines,3ahdyy,static_anonymity_,2,Sun Jun 21 16:56:58 2015 UTC,Just the old fashioned way. I was 237. I started dieting before HRT in anticipation of it. I got down to 213 by the start of HRT. But basically it was just exercising and eating smaller more healthful portions. I've been hovering at 197ish for a while now. I'd like to get back down to my low of between 145 and 150. I've just gotten a little bit lazy recently. Gonna try and ramp back up after today :-).

I just had a laser treatment yesterday and the women administering was complimenting me on my complexion and how pretty my face was looking. You saw in the timeline that I had acne problems in the past, but I was a habitual face picker as well, so I caused a lot of scarring. So I also set out over the past 3 years to correct those issues and try to even out my tone. I guess it's paying off!"

transtimelines,3a8h79,Luciaquenya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:07:42 2015 UTC,"great changes, beautiful... what was your diet and health style changes that made you this far?"
transtimelines,3a8h79,verbenasFaros,3,Thu Jun 18 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"They came at different times and different changes. For a baseline, my starting diet was basically eating a lot of fast food and in large amounts. I'd eat an entire large pizza at a time, drink 12 pack of soda a day and eat entire bags of chips for a snack. I had (and still do) an emotional attachment for food. My calorie intake at the time was easily 2500 to 3200 a day.  2008 - Cut out soda, switched to whole grain and cooking more at home.  I began to exercise on a more regular basis, including run small amounts (a mile or less). I started to count calories and went from 40 inch waist to 36.  2010 - Cut out fast food and started to run again sporadically. This was married life so it was hard to stick with changes.  2012 - I finally buckled down and started to exercise 4 times a week and cutting calories back even further. I started to eat more vegetables and ran longer distances (3 miles or more). I got down to a 34 inch waist.  2015 - I now eat fruit for breakfast, I eat small portions for lunch. Dinners are my biggest meals and I try to opt for variety over amount. I try to not snack, but if I do, I eat low calorie, such as popcorn, pickles, etc. I also exercise intensely on a regular basis again (at least 5 times a week if not 7). I'm now down to 32 inch waist and a lot of weight has left my face and limbs. Of course, the belly is the hardest thing to go"

transtimelines,3a4p86,whompalicious,3,Thu Jun 18 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"It's not dyed, but the photo is not actually a great representation of my hair color. My hair is really more brown with reddish undertones that come out in the light, though I have thought about dying it so it looks similar to how it does in that photo and a few others I have. That my hair color is not reproduced faithfully is actually not intentional and sort of a defect in my image process.  [Incoming photography nerdery for the benefit of other photography nerds] For whatever reason, my photos seem to display online more magenta than they are in my color-managed image editor, so it is not quite that red. Also, the flash I used was bounced off the ceiling, so that probably exaggerates the way my hair reflects light a different color from some angles. Finally, the image colors under the settings I used are not a completely faithful reproduction of the actual colors."

First your shoulders will get hairy then your ass and well just all over that area will become thicker and unpleasant.  you get the jist of it. Then your stomach will get hairy not in a sexy manly way but more of in a problematic plague theme. Then your nipples and chest again not in a sexy sort of way but in a continuing plague then for about 4 years till things calm down with the hair growth. Then your arms will grow THICK. And just all over thicjer as well. You know any farsi? I may be a full blown Armenian but my family lived there for 400 years so persians are like family too me. Right on bro. Viva la revolution

I don't know if I need more protein or less, or more sulfates or fewer, or what. I've definitely gotten the hang of the basics, but I want to kick it up to some next level /r/curlyhair shit."

transtimelines,3a0i8j,Luciaquenya,4,Tue Jun 16 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"I think you already look really feminine. I wouldn't worry about FFS until you've been on hormones for a couple years. If you want to start HRT you should go for it!! It takes time for the effects to be noticeable, but I'd say most trans people thing it is totally worth it :)"

transtimelines,3a0i8j,Zottie,2,Tue Jun 16 07:50:50 2015 UTC,"Hormones do a lot, and you have such a babyface that I think you will do well. Some trans women do FFS, but it depends on what you are comfortable with. After 2+ years on hormones, I am sure no one will mistake you for a man."

transtimelines,39vu4t,Darkurai,15,Mon Jun 15 12:28:41 2015 UTC,"Oh right, sorry! I'm the tall one that's not Japanese. And yeah, about mid-photoset, I had FFS, and you can see some black eyes."

transtimelines,39y1s7,danaEscott,6,Mon Jun 15 18:51:50 2015 UTC,"Hi. 9 weeks feels like forever. I know b/c I'm only slightly ahead of you. :) I'm trying to keep my expectations low. I've been using this timeline as a guide to help me slow down and (try to) enjoy the process. According the chart, we should be only just now entering any sort of 'onset of change' state.   For what it's worth, I do notice you have some subtle changes that lean towards feminine."
transtimelines,39y1s7,Nina1701,5,Mon Jun 15 19:40:43 2015 UTC,I do have the shrinkage downstairs already and I definitely have some boobs.  It's amazing how HRT reacts differently in each person.
transtimelines,39y1s7,dackeltx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:46:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting the link to the timeline graph.  It is most helpful.  I am 44 and started HRT about three months ago.
transtimelines,39y1s7,throwaway_tg,3,Tue Jun 16 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"The patience that you need for this is terrible, but totally worth it.  With all seriousness, you'll see the most notable changes in your face between 6 and 9 months, assuming that your levels are correct. I don't know how profound that it'll be starting at your age (this is from lack of experience), but 9 weeks is 100% too early to tell."
transtimelines,39y1s7,AndreAbdel27,2,Mon Jun 15 23:34:55 2015 UTC,are you allowed to post your dosage? maybe I can say something.
transtimelines,39y1s7,AndreAbdel27,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:44:08 2015 UTC,Sure   100mg spiro (50am/50pm)  E patches 2x 0.1 twice a week.
transtimelines,39y1s7,quinn_marigold,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"maybe you should increase your spiro.. I'm taking 200mg (100mg Morning/100mg Afternoon) have you done any blood test? if you know your Testosterone level, please post it."
transtimelines,39y1s7,AndreAbdel27,5,Mon Jun 15 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"Suggesting someone increase their spiro by looking at their face instead of looking at their blood work is a foolish thing to do. I know you mean well, but you have no way of determining such a thing by appearances alone—especially after only nine weeks."
transtimelines,39y1s7,April41,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:54:31 2015 UTC,Blood test was done this AM.  My 2nd appt is 6/24.  I am assuming if everything is okay my dr will up the dosage.  I have noticed changes below the neck but just not in the facial area.

transtimelines,39y1s7,wannabe_pixie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:32:28 2015 UTC,I got some of my results.  Estradiol went from <20 to 80.  Still waiting on T results.  This was from 4/20(when I started) to 6/15(day of test)
transtimelines,39y1s7,Tbhitskendall,2,Fri Jun 19 12:16:08 2015 UTC,"What facial changes are you looking for? Another factor is obviously genetics. Another is that the changes are obviously minor and compounded over time. You may not see the changes where as someone who doesn't see you as much may notice them. People keep telling me that I have had changes and I don't see them, but people who see me once a month say that the changes are absolutely happening. So yeah, patience, but also, genetics."
transtimelines,39y1s7,guisar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:06:57 2015 UTC,I'm not really looking for anything specific.  I saw someone had posted on reddit a couple of pictures that shows a thermo image of the face on HRT over time.   I thought it was interesting but can't find it..   So like I said.. I'm not looking for anything specific.  I am monitoring my progress and was just curious.

I can't wait to see your hair keep growing--I'm a super curly girl, so I know how it takes 3-5 inches of growth just to make it look like it's grown an inch! You have super gorgeous curls, honestly! Have you ever been to /r/curlyhair ?"
transtimelines,39ghkq,ChibiOne,6,Thu Jun 11 15:45:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I'm never sure what date I should consider to be my ""rebirth day"".  There's the day I publicly came out to everyone and stopped using my old name, that actually seems like the most appropriate day to me, but then there's the day I started HRT which I know is a popular choice, but for me it's kinda muddied by the fact that the doctor started me on a half dose and reviewed my blood work after six weeks before increasing to a full dose (and eventually ended up upping the estradiol twelve weeks after that), so the whole process of going on HRT has been kind of an extended event.  Finally, the day in court when I got both my name legally changed and my birth certificate updated with the correct name and gender -- that actually seems like the most official rebirth there, due to the rewriting of the birth certificate itself, if for no other reason.  Maybe I should just celebrate all three rebirth days lol"

The pigment cancels out the blue/black of the beard shadow. :)"

transtimelines,38p9fy,CosmicNed234,12,Fri Jun 5 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"I couldn't make it all the way through, to be completely honest I can't stand criticizing another trans person for being born white, or for being wealthy.  EDIT: I finished the whole article and I think it's just awful. But hey because I'm white and have a good career I'm not trans enough, and my opinion doesn't matter."
transtimelines,38p9fy,emily_purdy_pants,2,Fri Jun 5 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's saying that Jenner isn't trans- clearly no one would deny that. She's just pointing out that there are other axes of privilege in play here.   I think we especially as white trans people have to at least listen when trans poc tell us of systemic racism etc because we cannot truly understand it, in the exact same way that a cis person cannot understand being trans.   Be honest with yourself, do you think a cis person's opinion matters when talking about trans issues? I don't think it does: everything meaningful they could contribute can as easily be contributed by a trans person.  So by her reckoning as a trans poc, visibility for the trans community in general is not a panacea, and given what Caitlyn Jenner could provide for them, is really not even helpful. I think the article would have been better had she then proceeded to explain some of what Ms. Jenner could do for them, but to criticize her letter in this way doesn't invalidate her own criticism that Jenner has made herself (as she said, intentionally or not) the de facto face of our community, perhaps even more than Laverne Cox or Janet Mock, when she in fact represents only some of us in a meaningful way."
transtimelines,38p9fy,mianc,7,Wed Jun 10 03:50:26 2015 UTC,"This article felt like just pointing the finger nonstop at someone who is openly allowing the worldwide machine to dissect their life. Caitlyn Jenner is doing the rare thing in showing admittance to actual transitioning ALL ON CAMERA.   I don't know much about this. Even 2 months in to HRT I still just sit at home in my cocoon waiting to be me, but I do know that finding this Reddit community in December and now having an open dialogue floating in the populous continues to make it easier for me to transition and not just end it all in a bloody mess as the mind does tempt.  Anyshway, Laverne Cox really hit the nail on the head in addressing Ms. Jenner. http://lavernecox.tumblr.com/post/120503412651/on-may-29-2014-the-issue-of-timemagazine"
transtimelines,38p9fy,captsaracold,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:03:07 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat. About 2 months in, cocooned, hoping that at my next endo visit I can convince them to ramp up the doses even further. This initial part is the worst. I want to be me, already.   And I agree, Caitlyn is incredibly brave here. Not just for transitioning, but for doing so in the public eye. Some may see it as a publicity stunt but or that she's trying to better herself, but I'm happy that someone is bringing awareness and championing the cause, intentionally or not."
transtimelines,38p9fy,Charwomander,3,Sat Jun 20 20:20:06 2015 UTC,I'm curious to hear this communities response to this somewhat negative open letter to Caitlyn Jenner. I'm a cis gendered male who subscribes to this subreddit not because I've ever had gender issues but because I like to educate myself and be an ally in any way I can. I also find the mental (as well as the physical) transition to be incredibly fascinating and deeply moving to read about. But I'm curious what you guys think of this letter?

transtimelines,38gna6,D4rthLink,3,Thu Jun 4 13:53:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly the muscle decomposition is such a slow process that you wont notice it for a long time, and if you just keep training you will probably maintain that muscle. I wouldn't worry about it! Other than the fact that I haven't ridden for almost a month, my ride yesterday felt the same as it did when i wasn't on hrt!"

transtimelines,38be08,athey,37,Wed Jun 3 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps your mom insisted you go full time because she has eyes and can see that you look perfectly female.  You pass in every one of those pics, so either your camera is a god damn liar, or your own jaded and depressed mental filter is distorting your perceptions of people's reactions towards you.    I've seen loads of timelines on here where you spot the unfortunate body types with overly masculine shoulders, and you can definitely spot them.  Sometimes people can skew a couple photos with angles that are just right, or lighting, or FOV, and you get a couple pics where the masculinity is hidden better, but there are always angles where you see it.   NONE of these look masculine.  Even the early ones look like a tomboyish girl.    Have you considered seeing a therapist?  Are you on anti-depressants?    Being depressed makes all of the bad stand out like a horrible beacon you can't ignore, and pushes any good, out of mind.    I bet you pass a lot more than you realize, and with more confidence you'd pass full time easy."

If you use a male voice, people will gender you male. Given your attitude about yourself, I'd imagine you're using a male voice because you're not full time yet. Use a female voice, and you'll do perfect.  You complain about your shoulders. Lots of women have broad shoulders. And guess what? You're a woman, who thinks she has broad shoulders. Your bodily features don't make you any less of a woman. Your confidence in yourself shows to everyone around you, and the more confidence you have and the more respect you have for yourself, the better people will treat you.  If people don't want to acknowledge you as the beautiful woman you are, then make them."

It must be something else, either your voice or the way you carry yourself.  I kind of think you are being your own worst enemy and seeing things that likely aren't there. I have seen plenty of cis girls with your same build and with wider more defined shoulders. You look in the mirror and see every flaw, things that people won't be noticing.  If you don't believe me that there are so many other girls with wide shoulders look at 60% of all runway models.  http://fashion.lilithezine.com/images/Skinny-Runway-Model-02.jpg  http://www.womenfitness.net/img2013/artimg/may/Karlie-Kloss1.jpg"

I really do"
transtimelines,38be08,LazagnaAmpersand,10,Wed Jun 3 04:36:00 2015 UTC,"Girl you have got to take it easy on yourself, you've been experiencing the changes of HRT slowly over a long time so even if you can't see it, doesn't mean changes didn't happen. And their are plenty of women with builds like yours, masculine or feminine or not. You pass, you're very beautiful in fact. This is 100% honesty here. Not trying to kiss ass or sugar coat it, you appear as a woman and I know a lot of other people on this thread agree with me. Don't be afraid to be yourself just because you think you don't look the part, even if you didn't, be yourself every day"
transtimelines,38be08,XYEaQMZJvS,9,Wed Jun 3 05:15:55 2015 UTC,"Girl you have a more feminine body than me and my chromosomes say I'm female, if you're not passing it's for sure not because of your body. I think part of being female is to be insecure about something about our own bodies, for you maybe it's your shoulders, for others maybe it's their butt, or their boobs, or their nose. Everyone's got something they feel makes them a not perfect woman but no woman is perfect that's just part of being human. I'm not a bullshit hugboxer, check my comment history if you don't believe me, I just want actual pretty people to feel pretty and you ma'am are pretty."
transtimelines,38be08,Phoebe_Inanna,7,Wed Jun 3 07:09:13 2015 UTC,You very much pass! Where the heck do you live where you're not getting called female?
transtimelines,38be08,VolcanicVaranus,5,Wed Jun 3 03:52:25 2015 UTC,"I could see not passing in about the first half of pictures. Afterwards, you seemed much more female than male, and the last few there were absolutely no questions. Maybe a different hairstyle might help. That, or accentuating the large breasts you got lucky with. :D But even in the full body pictures, I'm not seeing your shoulders really getting in the way."
transtimelines,38be08,quinn_marigold,7,Wed Jun 3 04:39:46 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, not passing? You totally pass!"
transtimelines,38be08,MBirkhofer,4,Wed Jun 3 05:25:25 2015 UTC,Agreed.
transtimelines,38be08,jongargia,5,Wed Jun 3 05:30:09 2015 UTC,you look great! Just let yourself be more confident; it'll be fine!
transtimelines,38be08,Quillaprickles,5,Wed Jun 3 03:43:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenters, you look like you pass from the photos. As they have also said, it's possible this is because of your voice or mannerisms.  Confidence is key, and being transgender is all about being yourself. Do you. Rock that shit.  The human mind is trained to pick up on subtle body cues, and a person who looks uncomfortable/afraid/awkward/etc. can really stick out. If you have confidence in who you are, people treat you differently.  You are your own worst critic. Every person cannot help but see the flaws within themselves, and as mtf women we have a tendency to focus on the physical.  Voice training and mannerisms take time. Youtube is a great resource, but the internet is chock-full of others. A few tips from me: Women tend to walk with their elbows in toward their body, and wrists out away (think of a woman doing a curtsy). Men do the opposite - elbows out, wrists in (think of a guy with his hands on his hips). Also, women tend to move their hips when they walk, but they don't really move their shoulders (again, men are opposite). These are simply generalizations, and I've found that many cis people naturally fall outside of these behaviors. For this reason, over-exaggerating these masculine/feminine mannerisms can potentially make you stick out more.  I hope I've helped!  Be brave, be safe, be yourself."
transtimelines,38be08,Goryunov,13,Wed Jun 3 07:12:37 2015 UTC,"I am going to be honest with you!  Despite what the comments here say, there is no way to tell if you pass from these photos. There are no clear straight-on body shots, we can't hear your voice, and we can't see your mannerisms.  Obviously you are not passing if people you actually meet tell you that you do not pass, so please do post some clear photos—or, better yet, some video—if you would like some advice! You face seems perfectly workable to me, so maybe better clothing choices and some work on mannerisms would help you a ton."
transtimelines,38be08,Pippystix,9,Wed Jun 3 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"yeah.  I think she passes 100% in these photos. but body language, posture, dress all matter.  I fear/suspect the op lacks confidence.  so probably dresses baggy, with poor posture.  giving mixed signals, and failing to emphasis the features she needs to."

transtimelines,38be08,MichelletheDiva,3,Wed Jun 3 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"How's your makeup game? Not that these photos indicate that you need it at all (I'd swap you in a heartbeat). But, maybe people need ""another"" reinforcement to the idea that you are female. To help offset your alleged ultra masculine build. Of course, you have boobs, so I don't know how that can be the issue either.."
transtimelines,38be08,PrincessSissi,3,Wed Jun 3 06:39:07 2015 UTC,You're seriously adorable and I can't even imagine you getting gendered male. imo you're kicking butt but I definitely get how hard it can be to feel that.
transtimelines,38be08,Zottie,3,Wed Jun 3 06:58:10 2015 UTC,"You have a beautiful face! Seriously stunning cheekbones.  I'm sorry you're having trouble passing- I'm seconding the voice lessons! You can definitely teach yourself to speak in a higher register. I'd also suggest working on how you walk, how you move your hips and shoulders. A beginner's ballet class might help with this! Women move more lightly on their feet than men to. And it's hard when you feel self-conscious but try to brush off rude people! They don't deserve your time Or emotion"
transtimelines,38be08,DGunner,3,Wed Jun 3 13:22:40 2015 UTC,Wtf I don't believe ur not getting gendered female. You look more passable than me and I've never been clocked once since I've went full time.   The only thing I can think that would give you away is if u didn't voice train. Do u sound male or have u voice trained before?
transtimelines,38be08,Hobo_Rocker,-1,Wed Jun 3 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"people clock me before they hear my voice. again, i have a very masculine body. i look like a man that shoved water balloons down his shirt."

I have a larger upper body than u so not sure why that would be and I only have 36A boobs. Hmmm  http://imgur.com/e8Np8VI  That's me as u can see larger upper body and I think u look more feminine so not sure why.
transtimelines,38be08,BiddyCavit,-2,Wed Jun 3 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"um, you pass way better than me."
transtimelines,38be08,comradejenkens,3,Wed Jun 3 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"I have broad shoulders and no hips either and two things I found that helped with that are fit and flare dresses and blazers. The dresses give you hips and the blazer gives everyone broad squared shoulders, it makes them look normal. The red dress also helps, sleeves help a lot.  Your face looks very pretty, I'm jealous.   people clock me before they hear my voice. again, i have a very masculine body.   I get clocked too before people hear me but I find that going full time helps with feeling better about myself and being more feminine.   i can't get a job because no one wants to hire me since i look like a crossdressing man.

You wanna switch me? Didn't think so.  You are lucky you started young and you're lucky you already had such a feminine face and bone structure.

Your face is very feminine, your body is skinny, and those boobs mean you can't be anything but female! However I'm guessing your mannerisms and voice are not close and in most of the pics you don't look like you're trying. Your hair is also kept in a male way. I can see you being taken as a teenage boy, especially if your mannerisms are screaming male. Also from the look of it you're wearing male glasses which have a huge effect on your appearance."

As all the other commenters have said you are a super beautiful woman. This breaks my heart that you are giving up. I think hormones changed way more features than just your amazing tits. Your face in particular looks more feminine. I hope you can find some other people in your area who are possibly older transwomen to talk to.

She was not pleased with the news, but she has shown a remarkable ability to work through the grieving process at each step. She's been pretty ferocious correcting her family when they slip with pronouns.  She's very much not lesbian, and neither of us accept a sexless marriage, but when you have an established relationship with someone you love you're not really looking at their physical being anymore - she's been able to see past the changes, and go along with them. We are committed to our marriage and our family, and from the beginning have promised to do what's best for all. At this point, staying together still feels best - hopefully that doesn't change, but if it does, we're both prepared to walk away."

transtimelines,381z39,emily_purdy_pants,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:19:50 2015 UTC,"Well initially they were very short and I wasn't sure if they were new or not - now I have really long versions of the same blonde hairs and I know they are. I'd say the transparent areas of my hair are doubled up with blonde hairs of a similar length (not not to mention the receded hairline where a sea of littler hairs are growing longer and longer). In time, I am hoping, they will go terminal and become darker. Yep like peach fuzz - initially."

transtimelines,37r9t2,Phoebe_Inanna,3,Sat May 30 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   A friend of mine said something similar to me, once. It was in April of 2014, before I was full-time. I decided to go temporarily full-time while I was traveling out-of-state to a friend's wedding. The original plan had been to guy-mode through the airport and change when I got in, since I hadn't changed my legal name or any documents or done any voice training.  But, I decided to ditch that plan at the last moment, and just go through in girl-mode, without bringing any of my old clothes with me. No escape hatch. That was when my friend advised me to just smile whenever anyone was looking at me.  I can't say it really worked out that well, in terms of passing. But I'm glad I did it. I had a lot of experiences as myself that I would have missed out on, if I had gone in guy-mode."

transtimelines,37r9t2,bgail101,2,Fri May 29 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly hadn't thought about that trade off before. Doing this as an adult, under my own power, with the (limited) maturity gained by life experience on my side, may be making my own transition a bit smoother as well. I know that as a teen I may have had some difficulty transitioning too, especially considering that the world wasn't as friendly to trans people 15 years ago."

That was big part of the reason I didn't go through with it; I believed the whole thing about losing whatever-x% of passability per year past 25. I figured, if it couldn't be perfect, why try?   I'm happy to say, the reality didn't turn out to be at all like that."

transtimelines,37lo2c,Vacancies,4,Thu May 28 20:02:37 2015 UTC,Just wanted to apologize if my comment came across accusatory or harsh. I was baffled by how much 1 month on T did for your friend so I looked at the post history and then I became rather confused. I think I get worried about people trolling trans subreddits for their own bigoted pleasure and I just wanted clarity to make sure that wasn't happening here. Thank you for clearing things up and tell your friend that his one month pic is incredible and that it'll only continue to get better! I'm quite envious - his one month looks like my 11 months haha.

transtimelines,37k57b,black4ugust,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:53:29 2015 UTC,"Hey! Congratulations, you seem like a really nice! I like what you said about being religious and transgender, a lot of people who're transgender have a lot of problems with religion for no good reason, it seems like a lot of people here forget that religion and spirituality aren't the issue, it's people using religion as a scapegoat to be a horrible person that's the issue.   Although I do disagree with you that rich people don't face discrimination, and in saying they don't face discrimination, you're sort of disproving your own point, there's many psychological studies that say that no matter what conditions humans are in, eventually our mood balances out to a level where we feel comfortable, and un-stimulated, whether we live in a shed we rent for minimum wage, or a 20 room mansion. I think we should be mindful of all peoples problems and not treat people differently for their social status, this goes both ways, for instance, if a rich person gives $10 to a homeless person, when they have $1000 in their wallet, it's the same as someone with $10 giving someone 10 cents. really tbh, you should just be careful never to use the fallacy of relative privation.  Overall, great video! I wish you the best!"

transtimelines,36s6vj,qwinz,1 point,Sat May 23 13:05:12 2015 UTC,my one tip for you for that: coconut oil!  I've gotten 7 inches of growth in a year from only washing once a week and conditioning with coconut oil :)  I'm ftm and trying to pass with my long mane.. it isn't easy but I love my hair so much I don't think I could handle having it short again. I look awful haha

transtimelines,36s6vj,ranktwo,1 point,Sat May 23 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"omg I should have specified haha. okay so don't just stop washing your hair ahha it will be gross. over the period of a year I started extending the time between washes. I still shower almost every day but if I do wet my hair I'll do an apple cider vinegar rinse instead of shampoo and that really cuts out any oil buildup. but after a while your head just stops overproducing that oily gunk because you aren't stripping it all the time with the harsh chemicals in your shampoo, resulting in your body trying to balance by producing more oil, so it is a vicious cycle of greasy hair... throws me back to my high school look... I do recommend a shampoo with no alcohol or harsh chems in it if you don't already have one."

transtimelines,36jin5,tgthrowaway89,16,Tue May 19 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"Seriously about to cry, so beautiful! Congratulations, so many of them! :)"
transtimelines,36jin5,nachturn,8,Tue May 19 21:20:03 2015 UTC,"Although I'm single, as a lesbian MtF this gave me so much joy. I'm so happy for you."
transtimelines,36jin5,LadyLizardWizard,2,Wed May 20 02:22:30 2015 UTC,I'm getting married next year to my fiancee. We have been together 5 years now and I came out about a year into our relationship. (:
transtimelines,36jin5,Luciaquenya,2,Wed May 20 16:52:33 2015 UTC,Shows how the trans stereotypes just don't add up
transtimelines,36jin5,ardamass,2,Thu May 21 10:33:27 2015 UTC,When I was early on in my transition I went with her to a support group and everyone there said (to my clearly supportive partner's face) that we shouldn't get married because there was no way we would last. I'm not saying that every partner will or even should stay but transition certainly isn't an automatic break up.
transtimelines,36jin5,StephanieAmbrose,22,Thu May 21 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"As someone whose wife left during transition, Im so glad y'all were able to stay together I cant even imagine how much better that makes life."
transtimelines,36jin5,ardamass,21,Tue May 19 21:52:04 2015 UTC,"I'm on the verge of having to pick between two women, myself or my wife. kinda jealous of these pics."
transtimelines,36jin5,kira_paige,21,Tue May 19 21:57:48 2015 UTC,About a month in my wife decided she was going leave me no matter what. After all even if I didn't transition there would always be the risk that I would.   Pick yourself its going to hurt like hell but being trans is not going to go away. You don't want to wait get down the road a ways and then she leaves you. Now your depressed and missed all those years you could have been on hrt.
transtimelines,36jin5,HaveILostItAll,5,Tue May 19 22:06:24 2015 UTC,This is mostly my story.
transtimelines,36jin5,ardamass,6,Tue May 19 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"^---this.  Heart-rending, agonizing decision.  But in the end, it's a matter of survival for many of us."
transtimelines,36jin5,StonerMealsOnWheels,9,Wed May 20 00:48:43 2015 UTC,"I am really thankful for all of her support. And I'll be honest, it's not that she had some great undying love that has allowed us to stay together. It's our love plus a surprisingly flexible sexuality on her part."
transtimelines,36jin5,lesbichan,3,Wed May 20 04:10:34 2015 UTC,Well im glad it works for yall
transtimelines,36jin5,cupstard,8,Wed May 20 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yaaaaaay! So happy for you, you both look wonderfully happy."
transtimelines,36jin5,PariahSilver,5,Tue May 19 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"This is super irrelevant, but I have that same dress! I love it so much, haha.  But on a more serious note, you ladies look so happy! You're both also very beautiful, if I ever had a doubt in the world trans folks were truly meant to be their identifying gender, I could look at you for living proof. I wish you both the best of luck :)  Edit: Spelling"
transtimelines,36jin5,uncleowen2auntberu,5,Wed May 20 04:56:24 2015 UTC,Cute couple!

transtimelines,36jin5,good_little_monkey,5,Wed May 20 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"damn, y'all cute"
transtimelines,36jin5,SammyTheKitty,5,Wed May 20 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"This is completely precious. I, too, am one of the lucky ones whose spouse (though we were married before I realized) stayed with me.   To all of the people in this thread who've lost relationships because of transitioning - it's not that you weren't worth it, or that neither of you tried ""hard enough"", or that your partner didn't really love you, or any stupid, stupid shit like that. It makes me sad that several of you are dealing with a breakup on top of the gravity of transitioning; that must be very hard. But i feel like whether or not a couple stays together through a major life change is basically a roll of the dice to see if each are compatible with the changes. Like with OP, my SO happened to realize that he had a deeply buried sense of bisexuality. If he didn't, I don't think we'd still be together either. You are all incredible, brave, worthwhile people, if you don't already know that <3"
transtimelines,36jin5,stephenkingsthinning,3,Thu May 21 20:12:51 2015 UTC,Absolutely one of my favorite before and afters ever. Congrats to both of you for being so in love!
transtimelines,36jin5,DSkooms,3,Wed May 20 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"Hnnngh, I love seeing couples that stay together post transition <3"
transtimelines,36jin5,El_Hunters,3,Wed May 20 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"Very inspiring. I'm married and transitioning after being with my wife for 10 years. It all came as a pretty big shock to the both of us a couple of years ago. She's incredibly supportive and we're still as happy and loving as we've always been, but I don't present as female and haven't changed my name yet and so on. She's afraid of how she'll feel about those changes, and we're both aware that, even though our marriage has been entirely wonderful, in the end this may be something that she just won't be able to handle."
transtimelines,36jin5,LiaThePenguinologist,2,Mon May 25 14:07:41 2015 UTC,this is so cute..wow
transtimelines,36jin5,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Wed May 20 10:09:24 2015 UTC,"You look very cute together, I'm happy for ya girls. I'm slowly starting to see a funny pattern here. How come that whenever there is a photo of a trans girl with a cis girl parter, the trans girl almost always looks prettier (no offense to anyone, you both look good)?"
transtimelines,36jin5,Nina1701,2,Wed May 20 14:03:40 2015 UTC,"At least in my case it's because I wear my femininity as armor against misgendering. I wore that dress and make up not just because I wanted to (and I did want to) but also because I wanted anyone using male pronouns for me to feel hella awkward doing so.  My wife, adorable lil cis girl she is, has never in her life been misgendered. I on the other hand was misgendered the night the photo was taken by someone who knew me before transition despite the overtly female presentation."
transtimelines,36jin5,sherlock_watson,2,Wed May 20 15:39:20 2015 UTC,great success

I earned money from boxing and the army, all while being put through christian ""therapy"". One night, after receiving acceptance into an overseas school (and hence a visa) i left a letter on the table and just... left.  It was probably the best decision in my life. I didn't think i had the funds to last several years and would just starve/die during my mid 20s, but i wanted to have HRT and/or experience validation for a year at least. Somewhere along the way my immediate family managed to find and contact me, and sent me funds to keep going. Eventually I graduated and... I didn't die. I'm still alive. And i have a new home.  I'm visiting my hometown after much coercion from my immediate and extended family. I thought i'd mark this milestone by contributing my own pictures to this subreddit and ""give back"". I know the pictures here always keep me positive and hopeful everytime i look in the mirror and wonder ""when will HRT start working?"" or if i could ever experience all those amazing envy-inducing changes i see being posted from all you extremely passable, beautiful people."

I started seeing a therapist last august and the CBT tactics are helping little bit, but def still a struggle. any tips/advice would be very very very very appreciated?!!  even small stuff!!!!"
transtimelines,35elnl,pirfle,3,Sat May 9 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"I've suffered from anxiety for years,  at my worst they were full blown panic attacks.  I also spent most of my 20s in a drunken state and learning to deal with emotions while sober is difficult.    I have several methods of dealing with my anxiety,  the two I use the most are deep breathing and talking to myself.  I know what my triggers are for anxiety and they are mostly when I am not acknowledging or expressing the emotions I am feeling.  Instead of getting stuck on the negative spiral of thoughts on my head,  I talk them out.  The conversation goes something like this:   ""OK,  I'm feeling anxious. Why?  What's just happened? Well I started getting anxious when I saw this scene in the movie where the people got in an argument.  Why is that bugging me?  Well I did get frustrated at work today and John was kind of a jerk to me and I didn't say anything and I'm actually still mad about that. He was a dick and I was kind of an ass and that's OK.  The situation was a but silly and really not a big deal.  I'll apologize tomorrow when I see him. ""  And I just kind of do my own version of therapy where I talk it out.  I speak aloud because when my thoughts are over the top or extreme or very unrealistic,  I can hear how silly it is when I say it out loud.  If I just think it,  it's easy for me to overthink everything and make it into much more than it is.   I used alcohol and drugs to mask my emotions for a long time and even though my anxiety is generally under control,  sometimes I still get anxious.  Everyone does.  There is no shame in feeling anxious.  I did take medication for a short while and that helped me quite a bit but I also wanted to manage my life without self-medicating. I tried therapy but I was pretty broke and didn't find the guy I saw to be very helpful.  I Googled a lot of stuff for social anxiety and used any tip or trick that I felt would work.    Sorry for the wall of text,  I hope you find what works for you to manage the anxiety.   And you are beautiful being you,  don't let what others may or may not think of you be what defines you.  Good luck."

I know the negative spiral well!!  it usually happens for me before I even get out the door.  if I can get myself out of my room I can generally fake it enough to keep a conversation going, but getting to the point where just seeing other people isn't terrifying is the big hurdle!  I can't thank you for your thoughtfulness and taking the time to pass along your strategies!! I need to remember the deep breath system too.  the connnection between mental stress and physical anatomy seems like it can be kinda managed through taking control of breathing, at least in the moment.  it has helped before.  thank you."
transtimelines,35elnl,IDoNotWantToBeAlone,2,Sun May 10 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"Glad to help.  Anxiety is often discounted or played down by people and those of us who suffer from it fear ridicule and judgement from people and so we don't like to talk about it.    Another of my major coping strategies is to actually tell someone I am anxious in the moment.  I will tell my friends that I'm with,  I've even gotten comfortable enough to tell strangers (if the situation warrants it of course!) I just say to my friends, ""whew,  the anxiety has just kicked up a notch."" or something like that.  And almost immediately,  the anxiety lessens because I am no longer worried about someone seeing or finding out that I'm anxious.  I take the control back by admitting it.    On my first overseas flight last year (which was VERY anxiety inducing for me,  there was a lady 2 rows up that I overheard say she was a nervous flyer. She was still standing at the seat row getting settled in so I could see her clearly so I piped up -  I'm nervous too!  She and I had a quick chat and she even checked in on me a couple times through the flight.  It really helped.    So many times I have mentioned to someone that I am anxious and they will often tell me that they are anxiety-prone as well.  The worst you can do is suffer in silence.  Tell your friends.  Tell your family.  Tell anyone you need to in order to gain control of the situation.  I find most of us who suffer anxiety need to have a sense of control over the situation and not feel at the mercy of our thoughts.    And another thing that really helped me was finding out that the racing heart,  shortness of breath,  and other physical symptoms of anxiety and panic are NOT dangerous.  It is actually the way our body deals with the sudden surge in adrenaline.  It is what our body is SUPPOSED to do in that situation.  It is perfectly healthy and normal.  IT WILL NOT HURT YOU. I promise."
transtimelines,35elnl,tuuliu,2,Sun May 10 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"I guess you could say you've been sober for 12 years :P  I don't really have ay good advice, but you could always try having people over for dinner?"
transtimelines,35elnl,tuuliu,3,Sat May 9 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling with social anxiety all my life and I thought there was no way out, I still often do.  Gestalt therapy seems to be helping out. Getting to know the physical and emotional reactions I experience and dropping demands for myself are at the core of it. It also requires developing a trusting relationship with the therapist, something I never got as a child from my parents. Learning to relax has been a real effort.  Being consistently gendered correctly after 1 year HRT also helps enormously. The hiding I did before transitioning still affects me though so I'm a bit insecure when it comes to interacting with people who show confidence or are physically attractive.  Also, last fall I tried a guided audio for my complex PTSD. That helped me through the hardest times. I guess you can find different tapes, but this is the one I bought and that worked for me: http://www.healthjourneys.com/Store/Products/Healing-Trauma-PTS-Health-Journeys/19"
transtimelines,35elnl,tuuliu,2,Sat May 9 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"Also, you're looking real pretty :) (if that's what you're going for! you left me guessing with the order of the pics.)"
transtimelines,35elnl,tuuliu,2,Sat May 9 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"thank you!!! it's the ptsd stuff that I really have trouble with!  this learning to relax part is what I'm trying to figure out now.  gestalt therapy I've heard about and want to learn more, and I can't thank you enough for passing along the audio.  thank you."
transtimelines,35elnl,Healfwer,1 point,Sun May 10 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"Heyy no problem! Really :) I'm glad that I could help.  Gestalt therapy for me mostly means sharing events or feelings with my therapist and then we go through how I feel in that moment - mostly, how does it feel in my body. Not how I think I feel more generally, but specifically what and where I experience in my body. That has opened up my eyes. That helps me reshape (gestalt=shape in German) the experiences. I'm not sure if all gestalt therapy emphasizes bodily experiences but my advice to you is to find a therapist that does.  We also do exercises, like this one time not too long ago I strangled a towel and cursed at it. And cried. Totally helped me show my aggression, which is something that I needed to let go of my overwhelming anxiety that day. I felt so calm and at peace afterwards."
transtimelines,35elnl,yr_mom,1 point,Mon May 11 07:51:14 2015 UTC,"but yeah for the ptsd its mostly basic stuff, abusive homelife growing up and then a couple years ago I got jumped in the middle of the day in a library bathroom and some dude I never met before beat the shit out of me and broke five bones in my face, almost died and all that.  this was right around when I quit drinking and the combination of all of it was good for coming to terms with things mentally but bad for being able to go out into the world.  the ptsd stuff is always complex but if you have any more general links please feel free to share!!!  thank you!!  -jt"
transtimelines,35elnl,ice-cream_dreams,1 point,Sun May 10 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"Ouch... I'm so sorry, nobody should have to go through something like that :( I'm happy you're ok though and I hope he didn't get away with it.  I think that because of the motherfucker attacking you it's possible that you're suffering from ptsd. It's also possible (though I'm not a doctor) that you're suffering from complex ptsd, which is caused by prolonged emotional abuse (usually at home by those supposed to be caregivers). This is what I have had and probably still affects me. The bad news: if you have it'll probably never go away. The good news: you can learn to live with it.   Pete Walker writes about complex ptsd. I found his texts somewhat helpful... He understands how complex the effects of emotional abuse can be. That's how his texts help you reach some sort of absolution, that you're not the one to blame. Could actually go take a look again myself :)   http://pete-walker.com/fAQsComplexPTSD.html  (see How Did I Get Complex PTSD?)"

transtimelines,35elnl,kirinizzi,1 point,Sun May 10 18:36:09 2015 UTC,"ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) helped me a lot with my anxiety.  Check out the books by Russ Harris.  Also, what if you call people on the phone or skype?  That could be an intermediate step between staying in and going out.  You could even tell the people you trust that you have social anxiety and give them some suggestions for how they can support you. Good luck.  <3"
transtimelines,35elnl,MissHalina,1 point,Sat May 9 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"First off, wow, you look great!  Second, I also deal with social anxiety. Like others have said, CBT and ACT can both be helpful. But I found mindfulness and meditation to be the most helpful. There are some fairly simple techniques you can use that are good grounding techniques to get you out of your head a bit! You can search for some techniques or courses online (there is quite a bit of info out there) otherwise feel free to PM me if you like :) Good luck!"
transtimelines,35elnl,summer_d,1 point,Sun May 10 01:43:39 2015 UTC,"my little sister is studying neuroscience and has been trying to get me to practice more with radical acceptance, mindfulness, and finding ways to shift perspectives before the feedback loop causes in and causes the panic attack.    I want to be able to do it reflexively, or at least with some degree of competency.  I know its not the same, but just blatant gratitude for being alive and understanding that none of this is guaranteed helps more than anything. I still feel pretty defeated most of the time, but  being openly and actively grateful of the chance to be here at all. it has probably helped the most.  thank you for taking the time to say hi and offer advice!  it really means a lot to me.

Those lovely curls will be a great asset when they grow a little, with a little bit of care they will be awesome for helping you pass, as curly and wavy hair naturally softens one's features. It's still early days so don't pay too much attention to how you look right now - with a bit of luck you will one day soon look at these pictures and struggle to recognise yourself. You'd be surprised how much of shoulder width is muscle: mine got a good few inches wider just from HRT with very little exercise at all. Fingers crossed the opposite will happen to you."

transtimelines,34s5vk,jelly_cake,4,Mon May 4 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"When my parents told me transition couldn't possibly make me look like a passable woman, I showed them your timeline from January (among others).  You  are  crushing  it  and have been for a while now!"

transtimelines,34s6qx,Hobo_Rocker,12,Mon May 4 02:40:24 2015 UTC,"I think you could pass easy with longer hair and make up. The top right pic i think you look super cute, dont be so hard on yourself, please :)"
transtimelines,34s6qx,arriflex77,4,Mon May 4 03:35:51 2015 UTC,Yeah but hair takes so long to grow its awful
transtimelines,34s6qx,arriflex77,6,Mon May 4 04:59:09 2015 UTC,"Keep at it. You say you dont notice any facial changes, but you already have a feminine face. The expression in the last pic is very guyish, i bet if you smiled and had a little eye make up youd look great."
transtimelines,34s6qx,bamberjean,1 point,Mon May 4 05:03:47 2015 UTC,I have the most masculine face on earth though
transtimelines,34s6qx,Phoebe_Inanna,8,Mon May 4 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"You really dont lol. Masculine = big prominent nose, square jaw line, etc. You have neither. Hell my face is wayyy more masculine and i pass. If it wasnt for the guyish pose in top right pic i think you would pass."
transtimelines,34s6qx,kira_paige,1 point,Mon May 4 06:25:55 2015 UTC,I have both of those though.  It's literally what makes it masculine
transtimelines,34s6qx,noushieboushie,4,Mon May 4 06:53:14 2015 UTC,You have the opposite of a square jawline. I would call your face heart-shaped or oval.
transtimelines,34s6qx,NordicFairy,-1,Tue May 5 01:00:52 2015 UTC,Which is just as masculine if not more
transtimelines,34s6qx,abrackish,6,Tue May 5 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"Heart shaped and oval faces are heavily associated with femininity throughout human history. I'm giving you an honest compliment but you seem to be willfully making yourself into something aren't. If I wasn't on mobile I'd provide some examples of women's portraits versus the typical square jawed male, but alas I am not able to at this time. But a narrow face and chin are certainly associated with a delicate, womanly frame. I don't know how you got the impression otherwise, honestly. I have literally never heard some describe a man's face as heart-shaped in person because it's just not associated with masculine image."

transtimelines,34qprr,mwshelly,3,Sun May 3 18:54:04 2015 UTC,Big change. Your face has really softened up. You've got boobs and hips too. :D  Is this taken in the same bathroom/toilet?
transtimelines,34qprr,pandachoco,3,Sun May 3 19:06:39 2015 UTC,I was in men's bathroom on the left side and now in women's bathroom on the right side. I am really surprised no one clocked me anymore even when I went shopping dressing like that without any makeup.
transtimelines,34qprr,pandachoco,2,Sun May 3 19:12:31 2015 UTC,Looks like you are at the point where you need next to none of it to pass now.
transtimelines,34qprr,tofulingo,2,Sun May 3 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"I do pass as a girl, but only a tomboy. I guess the next step to do is to explore and improve my style. Gosh there's a lot of people on campus who dress really well and I am staying in HK for the summer vacation which pressure me to do it since I am going to meet a lot of my old friends."

transtimelines,34np7y,leona0317,10,Sat May 2 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"In my experience it's not about looks as much as confidence, body language, and voice. I get sir'd a lot if I'm in guy clothes with no makeup and acting dude-like. But when I act feminine and change my voice I do waaay better. Don't think it's your looks, keep practicing."
transtimelines,34np7y,Cute_Shannon_hehe,6,Sat May 2 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"Sound advice, I think confidence is my biggest issue... I dont want to change how I act or how I talk at the risk of feeling unnatural, but I guess thats what practice is for."
transtimelines,34np7y,Cute_Shannon_hehe,3,Sat May 2 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"Totally, I've decided that at this point in my life it's easier to be ambiguous and androgynous instead of going full throttle fem right away. It's different for everyone though, do what makes you feel comfortable (not popular opinion when it comes to ""passing"" but I'm over trying to cater to other people with my appearance)"

transtimelines,34np7y,DarkSunGwynd0lin,1 point,Sun May 3 04:06:38 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  Who in their right mind would misgender you?  I know I'm not the norm, but I don't worry so much about being misgendered.  Even if it's blatantly obvious I would prefer ""she"" and ""ma'am""s, inevitably, somebody is going to ""sir"" me at some point.  I kinda view it as having bigger fish to fry.  If you're happy with who you are, and you should be (seriously WOWZA you're pretty!) then who the hell cares?  Also remember that cis-girls come in all shapes and sizes, too.  (Even a  cis girl can be misgendered under certain circumstances.)  Some have deep voices, some have high, some act ""dude-like"", some act super femme.  It's not really about how you act or talk (though clearly a very deep voice on such a beautiful girl would be a bit of a tell.)  In my opinion, it's all about owning how you feel.  You should feel great, honey.  You pass so very very well."

transtimelines,34l7we,guisar,12,Sat May 2 05:00:53 2015 UTC,Not yet. My transition has been much slower than most that I've seen. It took 14 months of tweaking the dose to get it right. Finally settled on 100mg spiro and 13mg/week injected estrogen.   I guess that I want to be as androgynous as my genetics allow for.

Without makeup I look andro, but voice pitch, inflection, clothing, etc and I am still identified female.

transtimelines,34axc3,TheFlyingSpork,-8,Fri May 1 03:12:54 2015 UTC,Don't forget to hit the gym while on T. If not... you're just gaining mass and not muscle and that's not masculine. T is amazing stuff... don't let it go to waste :)
transtimelines,34axc3,bionictransgirl,19,Wed Apr 29 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"Fortunately I can do whatever I want with my own body. Considering I am a man, my body is already masculine. Thanks for your concern though."
transtimelines,34axc3,bionictransgirl,9,Wed Apr 29 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"It is masculine, there are plenty of guys without tons of muscle and they don't get called unmanly. I think T is working great for you, we have a similar body shape and you give me hope. :)"
transtimelines,34axc3,bionictransgirl,5,Thu Apr 30 03:25:27 2015 UTC,Thanks! :)
transtimelines,34axc3,bionictransgirl,-13,Thu Apr 30 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"Sure, don't take perfectly good advice. Your call. Nice attitude. I bet your T levels are lower than mine ;)"
transtimelines,34axc3,bionictransgirl,7,Wed Apr 29 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"Probably, because I chose to be on a low dose."
transtimelines,34axc3,ranktwo,2,Wed Apr 29 23:00:30 2015 UTC,Just curiosity here (not meant as a slight or anything) - why a low dose? Too low and the body will aromatize testosterone back into estrogen and cause gyno + water retention + (all those other estrogen related sides).   Are your T levels within typical male range? Sorry if I came off edgy on the first response - it wasn't intended.
transtimelines,34axc3,bionictransgirl,2,Wed Apr 29 23:05:26 2015 UTC,I read that you get better results (especially for voice) on a low dose. I was on 50mg/week for the first 3 months but my T levels were low (300's) and I felt exhausted so I've been at 75mg/week for the last 4 months.

transtimelines,34c7lo,thefrostyfour,2,Thu Apr 30 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"oh I felt the same way, I think at 4 months or so I thought I was pretty my done.. definitely didn't think it was going to get as deep as it did. and I didn't do any voice training officially, but I have always liked doing crazy voices so maybe I inadvertently stretched out my cords or something haha"

transtimelines,347o59,helloitsimi,19,Tue Apr 28 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely gorgeous. You're like a little fairy.   Although, word of advice, all girls go through the ""too-much-lower-eyeliner"" stage, and it's normally a teller of age. If you want to look fresher then try and only line the very outer of your lashes. Otherwise it can prompt people to think you're a lot younger than you are. (Obviously if you like it then go for it! Rock it! But if you find people think you're a lot younger and it's confusing then that might be the reason.)"
transtimelines,347o59,helloitsimi,8,Wed Apr 29 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've recently backed off on it a bit.  replaced the bottom waterline with white eyeliner.  Makes me look more awake anyway."

Haha   It always sucks to hear about people who have spouses that after being so supportive eventually  just kind of drop it and want to end things. I mean, I get it, kind of. Most of them I see are straight women, but it sucks, nonetheless. I just keep hoping my girlfriend won't end up being the same way with me. She's been supportive since before we were even together, since I came out this time last year. and she's who I would call my best friend prior to our relationship. Sorry about the rambling.  You look amazing, and I wish you luck with the new guy!"

I am curious though, I am getting married this summer and starting hrt estrogen in July. my fiancee says that she will be with me no matter what but I have to expect the worst case scenario. I noticed you had a wife and now you are dating men. Have you always liked men or is this a new territory with transitioning? I hear stories of transwomen and their orientation changing with transition. I wonder if that could happen to me.  Thank you Danielle."
transtimelines,33k6pk,beatboxpoems,2,Fri Apr 24 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"I've always had a seriously repressed bisexual predilection. Confronting my transness and embarking on the journey of self-exploration that inevitably follows divorce have had a combined effect on me to allow myself to go where the moment leads. I'd say I'm confidently middle-of-the-spectrum bi, while it's new that I'm embracing it, it is not new that that's where I fall on the spectrum.  Best of luck to you and your love."

transtimelines,33k6pk,beatboxpoems,3,Fri Apr 24 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"Gosh... I didn't apply a science to it, or even over analyze it. I stayed fit and active (ran a half marathon 4 mos after starting E), started lazer early (before I even started spiro), and started practicing makeup very early (like years ago).  Other than that it's just been time and genetics I think."
transtimelines,33k6pk,agriff1,8,Fri Apr 24 22:50:46 2015 UTC,I don't think you can really blame your wife though. What you're doing is awesome. But not every body can take that the person they married is changing in such a way.  Don't hate her.   You'll find someone more suitable b
transtimelines,33k6pk,beatboxpoems,8,Thu Apr 23 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"Especially if she's a heterosexual woman attracted to men. Hopefully, especially for your children the two of you can remain on friendly terms even if not romantic terms.   Just give her time and space for the adjustment.   Still, you look fantastic, and you definitely shine when you're with your children."

transtimelines,33k6pk,TransThrowawayyy,2,Thu Apr 23 23:25:55 2015 UTC,Nah i didn't mean your divorce. I mean it purely because she entered the relationship as a heterosexual woman.
transtimelines,33k6pk,MissHalina,6,Fri Apr 24 02:14:09 2015 UTC,she entered the relationship as a heterosexual woman.   That's a big assumption to make.
transtimelines,33k6pk,sara53,3,Fri Apr 24 04:33:53 2015 UTC,Huh?? She entered the relationship originally with a man. Does this not make her a hetero woman?   So as shit as she is for not supporting OP. You can't blame her. If she loved a man its tough to love a woman if she is straight.
transtimelines,33k6pk,ImKira,9,Fri Apr 24 14:07:23 2015 UTC,"Also, she's one of my biggest supports to this day.  When I asked her to testify for me at my name change hearing (next Tuesday!) because my state demands two witnesses who have known you at least a year, she enthusiastically said ""Hell yeah!"" and took a day off work.  And then without batting an eye, she took off ANOTHER day of work when the court called me to reschedule because the judge's day suddenly ""filled up.""  She's massively supportive despite our failed relationship.  Again, I get really frustrated when everyone ""knows"" what I'm going through and imposes on me their generalized views of trans relationships in the same way they impose their generalized views of trans anything-else.  My situation is my situation."
transtimelines,33k6pk,RubyAF,6,Sun Apr 26 11:54:04 2015 UTC,"Does this not make her a hetero woman?   No, it doesn't. There are plenty of people who are attracted to multiple genders. Just because you enter a relationship with a ""man"" does not mean you're only attracted to men. And OP has stated above that her partner is attracted to women. It's not about orientation."
transtimelines,33k6pk,TeaSwitch,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:20:24 2015 UTC,Nah I meant more of in the traditional sense. Just trying to she'd light in not blaming the partner.   And I apologize I didn't read the comment where OP said that.

transtimelines,33bd0o,pandachoco,3,Tue Apr 21 03:56:52 2015 UTC,"My drive and my happiness just keeps going up and up and up honestly. I'm moving out on my own finally in two weeks and combined with multiple workout facilities, less money to spend on my food, and the ability to do my own shopping, I'm really committed to killing it! I'm living it up a bit before then as a last hurrah of sorts but once I'm out, I'm rocking it! And, also, working on busting out some serious savings for GRS hopefully later this year because that totally needs to happen. One thing I've been really dealing with as well has been being MEGA guy crazy and obsessed. Hormones are crazy like that, but between everything, it's just the perfect storm of motivation. I've never felt so driven or excited in my life! I really can't wait at all~"

I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but looking through your timeline and reading the captions caused me to cry. This is the first time I've cried in over two years (fucking testosterone and my general stoic demeanor), and I feel so relieved.  I'm so happy for you, even just picking up on your expression as the timeline goes on, how much happier you appear. You're adorable, too. And haha, I'm coming from the opposite side of the 'timeline' myself and I found this incredibly inspiring, even though I've been transitioning for years now.  Best of luck with everything, and thank you again, you've succeeded in making an 'emotionless' guy choke up. Take that for what you will."

transtimelines,33bd0o,SassyCassie216,2,Tue Apr 21 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"I do too, I hear too many shitty stories and it bums me out every time :(  My dad's....okay. The man tries at least but he struggles a lot of the time. Like as we started to discuss surgery, for example, he was acting like, ""Well, what if she has the surgery and later down the line decides she doesn't want it anymore and can't reverse it?"" My mom looked at him and was like ""There's no going back on this as is!"" He also had trouble because of ""remembering changing diapers"" when I was a baby and because I often tend to have a rather colorful vocabulary often reserved for sailors and truck drivers as he puts it lol."
transtimelines,33bd0o,SprikenZieDerp,2,Tue Apr 21 05:21:49 2015 UTC,"Better than my dad who completely quit talking to me the first time I started HRT. He's part of the reason why I stopped. Then I just said fuck it after a few years and went back on it. He talks to me still, but he's definitely very uncomfortable."
transtimelines,33bd0o,SprikenZieDerp,3,Tue Apr 21 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I tried self-medding for about 3 weeks back in 2009 and when my mom caught me dragged me to a super right-wing conservative christian guy (picture magazine clippings about him joining a march in DC for ""our lord and savior"" hanging in the waiting room) who put me through a REALLY shitty ordeal, then she told me how I'd never pass commenting on my physical build, and forceably applied high doses of testosterone prescribed by said doctor to try basically bringing me up to ""normal male levels"" and to basically try ""fixing"" me. We fought constantly and it was HORRIBLE for the first 4-5 years after finding out. Soon after she came to terms with things and realized it wasn't a phase in the slightest. However, it was very awkward for years. I was still scared to talk to her after how things went in the past and frankly was right up until I had the discussion about how I got my approval for HRT and that I needed her help with it. She was still shaky but once I actually got on hormones, she very quickly saw me happier, more smiley, giggly, and social than I ever had been since I was a toddler and became a full and strong supporter. The relationship took time to rebuild, but it's made a full recovery and then some. We've truly got the mother-daughter thing going on now...just took 9 years to get there lol! I hope things eventually get better for you as well <3"

I think I ended up spending $90ish including my gift card on some good concealer (I have rough reactions to laser on my upper lip) and an eyeshadow set. Super worth it though. Only reason o don't invest in more makeup, cuz I freakin love it, is strictly money, but oh well. I'll get more eventually!"

TeeFury keeps spoiling me with awesome ones~ Unfortunately they don't always look the greatest on my body atm because of my weight (even 3XLs are like unusually super small) but hopefully with my drive to drop my weight I'll be able to wear them better soon~  And totally! I've never been so happy in my entire life since transitioning~ Best thing to ever happen to me by far! <3

It's really funny given that a lot of my friends thought I was a very ""manly man"" because I'm a bit of a serious hard rocker (though I admit I've been listening to WAY too much pop lately. <3 Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and Sara Bareilles) and wore only black and such.  And there is actually a very funny story from my freshman year of high school too! One day in Spanish class we had a partner activity where we pretend to be gypsies. How do we do this? Towel wrap our hair up! Well...when I did it, my partner just kinda stared at me blankly for a few seconds before saying, ""Whoa....dude....you look like a chick!"" Considering id just realized I was trans a few months before that, it was crazy validating :)"

As for those looking for tips... I basically just reduced my calorie intake quite a lot. Cut out all the chips, fastfood, bacon, candy, chocolate and other delicious stuff that I miss so much :(. Watch out for fruit, too. It's good, but it usually has a lot of sugar, which is what makes you fat, so don't overeat on it. Going for wholegrain pastry is also quite helpful."
transtimelines,33bsa7,El_Hunters,3,Tue Apr 21 08:50:59 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/H1XSF5p  Sweet 16 and How I lost it.  The woman was stunning, enjoying a classic feminine beauty that seemed effortless. She moved with an elegant charm in an ivory colored suit, her heels tapped musically as she exited the elevator leaving behind a delicate floral scent. Most men would desire her I desired to be like her. A few weeks later I was in Lord and Taylor I saw it, the most beautiful ivory suit on a mannequin. Paired with a pair of black pumps and purse it called out to me. I had to have it.   I checked the rack looking for a size that fit me. The largest I found was a Misses size 16 but I wore a Women’s size 24. I bought the size 16, I don’t know why, but I had to have that dress. It didn’t fit, the skirt wouldn’t even go past my knees. It hung in my closet for three years sometimes I would take it out and hold it up and daydream.  Time had passed and today was the day; the suit was ready back from the cleaners it hung there in a clear plastic bag. I was ready too, pantyhose, bra, spanx, hair and makeup.  I took her from the hanger and opened the zipper on the skirt and stepped into it and pulled it over my hips, reaching behind, I heard the wonderful sound of “zzzippp!” as the skirt fit perfectly around my waist. As I slipped into the jacket the satin lining felt cool against my skin. As I worked the buttons closed the jacket hugged my hips seductively and proudly accented my bust.  I sprayed a bit of perfume and then stepped into my shoes. When I turned toward the mirror there she was……. the women from the elevator.  Although I was smiling a tear ran down my cheek. In 2009 I turned 50 years old, and had reached the weight of 280lbs. I hated how I looked. I was a year or two away from high blood pressure and diabetes. My dreams of expressing my feminine side were slipping away.  I was burdened with guilt, shame and self loathing.     Through the years I had worked so hard and sacrificed for so many things and for so many people in my life. Now at 50 the one thing I wanted most, the one thing that had nagged at me since childhood was going to be left unanswered. I couldn’t do it. I could not let it go. I needed to express that woman who I knew lived inside me. I may never transition but I needed to at least experience the world as a woman in some way.     I had no plan. I was still lost, but then one day during lunch I went to a local mall. I decided that I was going to buy makeup, a good quality foundation.  I walked around the sleek and polished cosmetic counters in Lord and Taylor. I was feeling horribly out of place and self conscious. I walked up to the Lacome counter and stammered out a request for a foundation with heavy coverage.  The sales associate told me that their foundations were very sheer, but asked me to wait a minute; she walked over to another kiosk and spoke briefly with another sales associate. Meanwhile I was turning red with embarrassment, I was sure they were shocked and appalled by my request. I fought the urge to bolt and run as I had done in earlier attempts.  You see I was starting to get weary of making excuses and being afraid I had enough I wasn’t going to run anymore. I was going to stand up to that bully who lived inside of me.     From across the aisle, came a smile and a petite wave. Soon I found myself standing in front of an attractive young woman who was the manager of the NARS counter.  Kasey, I would later learn her name, was pretty enough to be a model, her make-up true to her profession was artistically perfect. She quickly put me at ease and started to explain the different types of foundations available. For the first time in my life I spoke the truth openly about who I was. I told her that I was transgender and was starting to use makeup and wanted to develop a conservative business look for going out in the world. I didn’t know what to expect in return, I imagined the worst, disdain, scorn, condescension, but instead she responded with enthusiasm, and it was contagious. I listened intently to every word. Fifteen minutes later I departed and walked proudly back to the car carrying my cute little NARS bag with my new foundation. Best of all I felt good about my purchase; I didn’t feel guilty or shameful. For the first time in my life I felt acceptance. About three weeks later I went back to the NARS counter. Still a bit apprehensive and uneasy about what my reception might be, I was relieved to be greeted by Kasey and a friendly smile. “Hey how’s the foundation working for you?” She then helped me pick out colors for my eyes and gave me advice on application. When she reached for her business card under the counter I noticed her lunch, a small container of soup, fruit and a bottle of water. As I walked away it dawned on me, if I wanted to look like a slender stylish woman then I needed to eat like one. I was a yo-yo dieter who always went back to a fat and bad carb based diet. It was what I was use to, and it was destroying me physically but also destroying any hope I had of stepping out into the world as a woman. This was an epiphany, it was at that moment where I associated and connected my diet with being feminine and achieving my dream. You see I wanted to dress as a woman, socialize as a woman, and be accepted as a woman.  What I was saying was in all practical ways I wanted to live as a woman. I finally realized that along with the clothes, cosmetics, manicures, perfume and hair I also needed to include diet! Now anytime I reached for food I asked myself “What would a healthy woman eat?” Every time I made a correct choice it connected me a tiny bit to my feminine side.  No longer was making a healthy choice an act of self denial, but instead it was self actualization and a step toward femininity. That realization made all the difference in my battle against weight. As my weight started to drop and I built a wardrobe and I began to evolve as a woman. I started seeing a gender therapist and began to talk about my feelings openly. The guilt started to fade away. I began to accept the fact that I was transgender. I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t have to be ashamed of dressing as a woman. The world opened up to me. What worked for me was simplicity. I live a busy life; my family has all kinds of foods, and busy schedules. I didn’t go out and buy all kinds of diet food. What I did was to start counting calories. Male bodies (unfortunately that’s what I’m working with here) burn 2000 calories a day if you don’t exercise.  So I began slowly changing my diet. Here is an example, for breakfast instead of a cheese omelet, toast butter, and bacon. I’d have just eggs maybe some mushrooms, and a slice of toast with no butter. Then for lunch maybe some soup, and fruit, or a sandwich and some fruit. We not even up to 1000 calories yet. Dinner just a small piece of meat, lots of vegetables maybe some bread. The trick is to eat different foods get into a rhythm that acceptable for full time. Your hunger will diminish and you will begin to loose weight.  On weekends I don’t go crazy but do enjoy nice dinners, pizza and maybe some beer. Find an exercise that you can do regularly, if going to the gym is going to cause problems with your busy schedule then find a niche of time that you have free. I walk; I use to be a runner and laughed at walkers. But your research will tell you that the benefits of walking are close to running. Best of all I can do it anywhere, which means on the weekends I can hike the woods and during the week I can trek thru the office park. A half hour or an hour starts to slice off those 2000 calories.  Most important and listen closely here, if you don’t enjoy exercise you won’t keep it up. My walks are an escape, and I enjoy them, I feel as if something is missing if I don’t get that daily walk in.  The whole process is not rocket science, eat healthier food, keep it under 2000 calories a day and exercise. The experts emphasize that diets don’t work that eating healthy does. I found a reason to eat healthy, something that gave me more satisfaction than feasting. Femininity."

transtimelines,33bsa7,corbridge,4,Tue Apr 21 06:23:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the trick is to just make sure you eat under your maintenance level. This way you will eventually lose the weight. To do this efficiently you have to track everything you put in your mouth religiously."

transtimelines,33bsa7,michealcell,3,Tue Apr 21 06:55:39 2015 UTC,"Starting weight was 250 lbs, currently i'm at 155 lbs. Goal is to be around 150 lbs or maybe a bit below it. I'm 5'9''.  My goals are not really weight related but more body measurement related, I have a goal waist in mind :)"
transtimelines,33bsa7,nmi986,3,Tue Apr 21 07:10:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, my starting weight was 250 lbs as well, was at 228 lbs after 4 months of exercise/diet and then 220 lbs after my love handles lipo. I haven't weighed myself since the abs lipo, was waiting till my GP appointment this Wednesday for that. As I'm not too familiar with female waist sizes, which I guess I should be, so I'm going by weight and my goal is about 160-150 lbs.. Again, you look awesome in those last 2 pics; think you might want to wait on HRT to give you some more curves for that dress, kind of hard to tell from the angle."

transtimelines,32ysa2,IamAprilLee,12,Fri Apr 17 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"Hons, I truly appreciate the constructive criticisms, I really do, but how I dress is a reflection of how I actually live my life. I don’t believe that all the pain of transitioning I have endured is simply for me to jump from one box to another.  I am not going to embrace some PC notion of how an older trans should live at the sacrifice of being my authentic self.   There is a lot that doesn’t come across in the pictures, such as my love of incorporating a skull motif into my accessories. I realize that my choices put a spotlight on me. I don’t deliberately seek that, but I am totally comfortable with it. I have felt invisible my entire life, and frankly being seen a little feels pretty good.    I have become rather well known in both the local club scene and the local rainbow community. I am rather famous for my dancing. A lot of people tell me that never have met anybody who so totally owns their own space. That is because I am being totally authentic to who I am now. I am also utterly proud to be trans. That is good enough for me.  April's Tweets"

If I had any complaint about transitioning in Portland, OR, it's that zero fucks seem to be given - so you have no idea if you 'pass', or people are just rolling with it.  Short answer, I don't get male pronouns anymore. No problems with clothes / jewelry shopping, or bathrooms. Co-workers have their moments when they slip, but I had worked with them for almost 10 years before transition."

Just a trim.  April 2014 - https://instagram.com/p/mRGmCbiI2l/  Late July 2014 - https://instagram.com/p/qPPqtWiI_t/ - cut about six inches to get rid of poor, heat damaged hair.

If I can ask a question though, do you miss the strength/old routine in the gym at all? Its still something that bothers me greatly thinking about my identity and transition and I haven't talked to anybody that has been through it to such an extent."
transtimelines,32th6g,taylor-in-progress,2,Wed Apr 22 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"It has bothered me. I feel so much weaker and tire much easier. My brain can remember the strength and fury of my old body, but it's physically not capable of that anymore and it's difficult. Transition so far has been more about sacrifice in many ways and I'm hoping that it's all worth it in the end."
transtimelines,32th6g,emily_purdy_pants,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"To me the loss of strength feels defeating.  I shouldn't let it bother me, but having to ask my friends or brothers to help me with things I used to be able to do really easily is still a little embarrassing for me.  Moving band equipment sucked before, but now it's even worse!  I should have learned to sing instead of playing guitar, but alas."

I'm about where you were in your picture on the left (a bit lighter and not as ripped though) I'm about to start my transition next month and you've given me great hope as to what can be accomplished!  Out of curiosity, in your other post you said you cut out most animal protien, so I'm guessing lots of fish and tofu?"

transtimelines,32th6g,thelazerbeast,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:55:32 2015 UTC,"YMMV, what works for me might not work for you. The key is knowing your body. Id start by creating a daily food journal where you write everything you eat in a day then tally it all  up before you go to bed. You can then calculate your basal metabolic rate to find out how many calories a day you need just for being you, and whether or not you're over or under that number. If you're over, you are gaining weight, if you're under then you're losing weight! Adjust intake as needed and go for a little run a few times a week :)"
transtimelines,32th6g,ImKira,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:06:16 2015 UTC,"As for keeping a journal, if you have an iPhone, there's an app called MyFitnessPal that is pretty detailed and easy to maintain. Keeps track of calories, weight, water intake and steps each day and charts everything out to see your progress."

Before I started my own MTF transition, I admit it, never thought once of the other side of it since I knew so many butch lesbians and  they seemed to almost blend in fine.. Boy was I wrong. FTM transmen have so much more to do to blend in and be ""one of the guys"" than transwomen have to do to be ""one of the girls"" since men have to prove themselves and shit. Girls accept MTFs easier than guys accept FTMs.. Sucks, but its true. Love you for you! Mwah!"

I have wanted to transition since I was 16 but I probably won't be able to until I am 19-20. But if your parents support you then you'll already be a step ahead.

I'm planning on changing it when I have some spare cash.  I love ""Gwyn"" because it's Welsh, and the full name is Gwynedd (gwyn-ETH), which confuses everyone and that makes me happy.  Since the entirety isn't my legal name, I figure it's safe to use online. I'm all over the internet. I also love Gwyn because it's actually a non-gendered name- there's a politician in Texas named Gwyn Shae who's a guy, but then obviously there are females named Gwyn as well. Also, I was looking through some of my really old (like junior high/high school) notebooks, and apparently I made a character named Gwyn, so I guess I've loved it for a long time."

transtimelines,32cyzh,leona0317,2,Mon Apr 13 15:51:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you all SO MUCH for your lovely comments and support!!  Here are some additional thoughts I can share: - Five combat deployments and transition was scarier than all of them combined.  But living my life is beautiful, bright and I'm able to experience love and connection in ways I never thought possible. It was absolutely the right thing even if I lost loves along the way - Hair?  Well...I have gotten regrowth in the places I want it and lost a lot in the places I don't want it.  But I do have a little help on the top as it's still thinner than I'd like - I do wish I had started earlier, but don't we all - VA has done OK by me...but only after I had an outside endocrinologist prescribing.  I'll give them credit for starting me on Zolodex (I was weak and tired for a few weeks but now I'm back to normal with a T-level that's almost non-existent)  - Name and gender change was easier than I thought.  VA was hardest only because the couldn't agree on what documentation they needed and are never in a hurry.  Social Sec., Passport, Driver's Lic., bank stuff were fairly easy.  Even changing name/gender on my retired ID was not all that hard (told them that the lack of match up between my name/gender and what showed on Tricare's roles was a hardship that required expediting) - Had to give up quite a lot of male privilege I never knew I had until I lost it.  But that is simply life as a woman. - Had to give up my good-paying DoD contractor job, but I'm happier now living on retirement and disability and going to grad school full time (studying...you guessed it!  Women and Gender Studies) - Life is simply amazing...made more so thanks to the help of a wonderful therapist to unpack and heal traumas from the past!"

transtimelines,31y6yu,raider5319,5,Thu Apr 9 02:48:52 2015 UTC,"Man, that's inspirational, what a change! You look incredible!  Regarding the hair, you could try checking out some of the methods and info from /r/curlygirl /r/curlyhair. I've got hair that's fairly similar to yours, and I've been having some really nice results playing around with some stuff from there."
transtimelines,31y6yu,galactic-fantastic,2,Thu Apr 9 03:26:09 2015 UTC,Think you've got a typo in your link. Should be /r/curlyhair.
transtimelines,31y6yu,hatfulofmadness,2,Thu Apr 9 21:50:32 2015 UTC,"Whoops, you're totally right, fixed. Thanks for pointing that out!"
transtimelines,31y6yu,galactic-fantastic,3,Thu Apr 9 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"You need to checkout /r/curlyhair. The advice they have there about hair maintenance is invaluable. I don't know if my hair texture has changed over the years, or if I'm naturally this curly and I only learned that after really trying to address my previously frizzy/wavy mop, but you look like you've got similar hair to what my hair looked like a few years ago.   If that is the case, your hair is going to look killer if you try plopping it, and (counterintuitively) not combing it/brushing it, and doing stuff like sqish-to-condish. It's all covered in that sub.  Do me a favor: Look up how to plop your hair, and sleep one night with your hair plopped. All it takes is a large-ish t-shirt. Don't brush it before you plop it and, when you're showering beforehand, be sure to use a ratio of, I dunno, 4 to 1 for conditioner and shampoo (yes, that much conditioner, but be sure to rinse thoroughly) . Do not, I repeat do not, towel dry it after you get out of the shower. Some people say that sleeping with it plopped makes their hair a bit unruly (though still a large improvement to not plopping it), but I never have the patience to let my hair dry enough otherwise before taking it out of the plop.  Dont bother looking at my account for pics, as I don't have pics on my account of how it looks because I only recently (as of this week) got the hang of it, but it is a drastic improvement."
transtimelines,31y6yu,hatfulofmadness,2,Thu Apr 9 06:59:07 2015 UTC,"Was coming here to say this. Once I learned about CG method I've never really looked back (except when I had short hair, because it's not really curly at that point). Anyway, /u/taylortots1, you're looking great! Def check out /r/curlyhair"

transtimelines,31y6yu,LittleMissBitchFace,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"You should check out /r/curlyhair (even wavy hair is curly hair and curly hair is so easy to frizz if you try to style it like straight hair!) I have always had frizzy hair, and didn't realize what I was doing to cause it I JUST learned a lot of this stuff so I'm excited to share it whenever people tell me they have frizzy hair!   Without needing to buy products, squeezing your hair with a soft tshirt instead of rubbing it with a towel already makes a huge difference as far as frizz.   You look super cute!"

I'm only a month along so I'm still in the process of finding my true face but when I look at pictures of me as this chunky teen with short hair I'm like... That's not me.

I really don't know why I haven't had any tests done sooner. My Testosterone was initially 568 ng/dL (7.8 pg/mL), and the target level was like 60 ng/dL. I guess I will find out in May.

transtimelines,30yjyq,Viffer98,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I didn't have any top balding, just receding, so I can't say much on that. I know that it was thinner on top than in the back, but I haven't had longish hair since I was 18 so I can't remember if that's just how it goes, anyway. My hair feels softer, in general.   As far as the hair that was receded, it's coming back in better than expected. Originally, I only saw little fine blond hairs, but now they're getting thicker and darker!   The only problem with results like this is that everyone is different. Genetics play a role in everything, so don't have too high expectations. Top baldness is far more likely to grow back fuller than receded hair, though.   I'm only taking Spironolactone at the moment, too. I have a prescription for Finasteride, but I can't afford to fill it yet. I'm poor. :/"

AS FUCK. around three months, i was wearing like, skinny jeans and oversized button ups, and shoes with no socks. which was a look i considered andro/mildly femmy. but lo and behold, i'd go out and get 'miss'ed and 'ma'am'ed all day. to be honest, it was scary af, because i hadn't come out at work, i hadn't come out to my mom, it felt like maybe it was too fast. but i was so happy with my brain and body i sorta just kept rollin with it, started dressing more feminine, came out way before i was like, mentally prepared to deal with the conversations and questions i was about to be asked.   but yeah, i mean, weird, but overall, it is nice. like, i've never been misgendered by a stranger. ever. as soon as i started presenting, strangers changed with me.   although, around this same time, 3 or 4 month, i started getting sexually harassed. a dude like, followed me out of the subway asking if he could come home with me. i was fucking NOT prepared to deal with that. so, blessing and a...well, not 'curse', but it was hard too."

I stopped spiro due to it's long term side effects and started Prometrium (safe progesterone).  The combo of E and P are keeping T down naturally, without the need for spiro.  And P promotes DHT blocking on it's own.  Way cool.  Hope more docs pick up on these new findings.  Thank you for sharing!!"

I didn't expect any noticeable effects of P right away, but within the first week my dormant 'girls' woke up.  A wonderful feeling indeed. :)  They are indeed filling out, but slowly of course.   Also my skin is much smoother, which was a surprise to me.  Even smoother than on E & spiro.    I've talked with two other gals who started P at the beginning of the 6month of HRT and they also experience similar positive results with P in their regimen"

Sure they get attention, but I have also seem some rather beautiful super tall girls. If this is truly who you are, don't let anything stop you.  My parents are ultra religious and not accepting, I was married for 10 years and had 2 children. My wife left me and took the kids, and a lot of my friends vanished.   BUT! I've been on HRT for almost 1 year, my parents are sort of starting to come around. All of my sisters are now totally accepting (3), extended family has been far more supportive than expected, I have made all new and wonderful friends... Both trans and cis. I also now have an absolutely amazing, beautiful girlfriend who has become the love of my life.  Did I sacrifice a lot? Absolutely. Was it worth it? Absolutely!

Finding your channel was inspiring and challenging when I was working through my issues and questioning my gender. You helped me realize that transition was an actual possibility for me. I started hormones about 3 weeks ago!   Also thank you so much for continuing to engage with the community and post here on reddit! Your timeline is seriously inspiring, you look so incredibly happy and beautiful."

transtimelines,30q2l4,PinkiePai,3,Sun Mar 29 19:46:53 2015 UTC,Hey Jess! Thank you. You always know how to make me blush and smile.  I've got a picture that's like me at 5 years old on FB and even the early pics on there don't look like me anymore. It's so odd to not recognize yourself from pics that were post-HRT.  I try to keep it all relatively away from the profile except for a little bit here and there.  I feel better about posting it here since it's kind of the point of this subreddit.  Ugh I can't believe that I ever looked like that. So awful.
transtimelines,30q2l4,animatroniczombie,2,Sun Mar 29 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel that. I'm starting to get to that whole not being able to connect with that old self thing as well. It's really strange and hard to describe, but it certainly is a rare human experience to have."

I kind of wish I would have just started wearing women's clothes instead of coming out a really dramatic way. Though this second time around I'm just telling people matter of fact. If they have questions I'll answer, but I've decided no more tears. Any, you look marvelous!"
transtimelines,30r0zj,TheFlyingSpork,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks a tonblush, you're too nice.  Yeah the clothes thing was nice, and I got pretty lucky with that. The stars sort of aligned to make the right call for me. I was a tutor for my university comp Sci department. My boss was very LGBT friendly and never batted an eye. The students I tutored appreciated the fact that I was a good tutor and we're always nice.  The decision to do it without explicitly coming out to everyone explicitly was the result of how many people I was acquainted with but not great friends. Since I ran with the drug party circles so long I knew a lot of people that way, and even though my school was small getting them all on the same page wasn't happening so I went for it.  It worked out great. If I came out to someone a lot of the time it would be an 'oh, that makes sense ' scenario, or a scenario where they ask what's up and I tell them. I was lucky to have such good friends. That really took a lot of pressure off.  It definitely worked out well for me, and I consider myself lucky for that. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone's situation,  but if your situation allows I'd say go for, if your comfortable with it of course."
transtimelines,30jye1,RavensEatMyEyes,19,Sat Mar 28 00:44:27 2015 UTC,"Wow.. You're cute either way, but look better as a girl I must say!"

transtimelines,30jye1,m2cwf,12,Sat Mar 28 03:28:03 2015 UTC,what a crazy journey .. so when u stopped hormones did literally everything come back as before?
transtimelines,30jye1,nmi986,5,Sat Mar 28 07:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, T is a powerful hormone. I think I still have some breast tissue, but it not really noticeable as I've gain some muscle on my chest."
transtimelines,30jye1,neapologist,6,Sat Mar 28 12:38:15 2015 UTC,"Best of luck on take 2!  I also stopped transition to try to be genderqueer for a while, but am transitioning again.  Guess I'm not the only one to run into that."
transtimelines,30jye1,justafleetingmoment,6,Sat Mar 28 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"Whoa, I remember you from trueselves. All the best for take 2."
transtimelines,30jye1,split_chickadee,5,Sat Mar 28 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I took time of from most trans related forums. Sometimes if get drunk and go back and then start crying because I knew I was making a mistake by stopping"
transtimelines,30jye1,split_chickadee,5,Sat Mar 28 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why you decided to stop for so long and start again?  I started for a few months and stopped for personal reasons, not so much gender reasons, and hope to start again soon.."
transtimelines,30jye1,split_chickadee,9,Sat Mar 28 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"It was for financial, social and maybe intellectual reasons. I couldn't afford hormones anymore right around the time I took an intro to women's studies class. The class talked a lot about gender roles and gender as a construct. It also touched upon genderqueer and nonbinary notions of gender. And as I've never been particularly dysphoric about my penis, I started to question transition. Socially, I was being gendered as a woman until I spoke, which felt great. But I wasn't used to people looking at me all the time and I figured I was being clocked. Also my parents always had this look of disappointment or sadness in their eyes when they interacted with me. So all those things and having low confidence pushed me to detransition."
transtimelines,30jye1,Amilani,6,Sat Mar 28 15:28:10 2015 UTC,"So has anything changed your mind to start transition again?  I feel sort of the same, I'm not terribly dysphoric physically, but I do feel like life as a woman would be better for me.  Its just the process of getting there, relearning everything, disappointing family like you said, that really scares me.."
transtimelines,30jye1,Wannabkate,16,Sat Mar 28 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've started socializing with other women more often. And when they say things like ""I wish there was another girl around here to talk with"" I would feel like, damn it, I am another girl but my outward appearance betrays me! And everytime someone called me handsome, I'd think, why not pretty? Then there was me looking at this subreddit when I was drunk and crying because I knew I made a mistake. Last Sunday I did that. Cried until 1:30 in the morning and then I said fuck this. I'm a grown ass person and I can do what I want and be who I want."
transtimelines,30jye1,halt_den_Mund,3,Sat Mar 28 16:11:23 2015 UTC,Good for you!  Good luck then :)  You were very pretty before!  Still are :)
transtimelines,30jye1,ScolipedeTim,6,Sat Mar 28 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"I just want to let you know that this post really hits home for me. The ambivalence, the shitty feeling of questioning who you are. Sometimes it's good to know that, like me, not everybody is totally confident or positive of what they are doing. It's also good to know that second (third, fourth) chances are possible and that what's important is that you stay true to who you feel you are. You have a supporter here :)"

Without that, I've found that people think I'm 17 because the estrogen has changed my masculine-framed face to be softer."
transtimelines,30ihs9,Karfunkley,5,Fri Mar 27 22:06:11 2015 UTC,"What advice do you have for people who are trying to understand their own gender identity? I identify as Demigender, mostly cause I don't feel like male completely encompasses who I am.   I want to transition, but I'm not even sure what to aim for.    I really love your timeline btw. You look great. :)"
transtimelines,30ihs9,Karfunkley,3,Fri Mar 27 23:35:52 2015 UTC,"Try not to focus on the end result. That will change, I guarantee it. That's part of being human, not being trans.  My best advice is to take the steps that feel right. Try everything. If it doesn't work for you, take a step back, and try another direction.   I thought I was a trans woman for 3 years. Until that first picture presenting male a year and a half after I went ""full time"", I never thought I'd want to present male. Things can change, and if you hang on to what you think you should be as opposed to what your feelings dictate what's right, you're going to be disappointed."
transtimelines,30ihs9,danaEscott,3,Sat Mar 28 16:43:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is great advice. I have been a little preoccupied with the end result of transitioning. I'm kind of always questioning how trans I really am because I'm scared that I may be lying to myself. Idk, but you're right, I just need to do what feels right and let it be a process instead of trying to figure it out all at once. Thanks for the advice. You're great. :)"

Especially since I don't have makeup on in them (except the first). I swear I don't really look like a girl, but the hair, the eyebrows, the voice (!), and my clothing are what do it. I still get read male by strangers on a frequent basis."
transtimelines,30fpvf,El_Hunters,2,Fri Mar 27 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"Wow I am so surprised to hear you say that you ever get misgendered. Well even if you do, no matter, you look awesome and your hair is Ah-MAZINGGGG! I am insanely jealous.  Best of luck!"
transtimelines,30fpvf,Crazydunsparce,2,Fri Mar 27 16:25:34 2015 UTC,"Now that I've been thinking about. The misgendering may just be be the pervasive male-terms-turned-neutral like dude, man, guy.   Also, people look at me more. Is it a girl they see? Is it that I'm a strong personality? Have I been clocked?! lol. I feel like since I've finally started presenting/acting/being all of me I've stopped caring. I am currently sick and having way too much fun playing jokes on my friends by switching to my guy voice. I can call them up from my phone and they won't believe it's me. I need to learn better phone pranks. Haha"

transtimelines,30az3i,NordicFairy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 11:57:27 2015 UTC,I'm in a similar situation right now. I didn't realize I was trans (still not sure) and I'm afraid to how she would react. I'm sure she would be supportive in the long run but knowing her she'd feel betrayed and angry at me. More than likely cause a break up.

transtimelines,3089sd,Jenntv21,3,Sun Mar 29 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"Oh no, it's been a year and two months. Started low dose (100 mg spiro, 2 mg estradial) last February and a full dose last June. The facial hair was the worst part though - I've had 12 laser hair removal sessions and nearly 20 hours of electrolysis - and the hair keeps coming back after about a month or so. The hair I do want to grow on the top though lol it's still not quite long enough and so that nice hair you see, well it's not my own. I hate wearing a wig because my natural hair looks nice but that'll take quite some time to be long enough.  I started living full time last week. I have terrible anxiety so I would only go out at night as Ruby until recently. My profile pic from the side is not as passing of course. I'll post a pic of that eventually but I have brow bossing and a boxy chin from the side. Going to Dr.Rossi in Argentina for those interested, let me know if you have any questions about my upcoming ffs!"

By transfeminine, I mean I definitely lean much more towards a feminine expression. Keep in mind this is different from identifying as a woman.... Just like you can straight up be a woman/girl and be a tomboy, which would be exprssing yourself in a masculine manner, without even being trans at all."

Plenty of water. exercise change - swapped heavy weight lifting (testosterone promoting) for yoga and long walks everyday.  stress control- prioritised sleep minimum 8 hours a night regardless of work or other commitments. Take small 10-20 min breaks a day to meditate or go for a short walk. Learned to say no to people, at work and in my life, put my emerging girl first :) genetics (as much as I wish I could wave a girl wand for everyone mtf out there, I can't help with that one :( ) finally intention - I don't know for sure but I feel once I stopped fighting the girl inside me and learned to love her, my body started changing, could have some placebo effects or could have influenced the commitment to the lifestyle changes above.

transtimelines,2zselb,nmi986,2,Sat Mar 21 16:13:07 2015 UTC,"I cut back over a few months before I went off them...started having vegetarian lunches at work, then dinner during the week, then finally weekends. I would still allow myself to have meet if I was at a friends and they had cooked or if I was on the road and had to get takeaway, but eventually friends knew I was eating vegetarian and I got better at knowing where I could find food on the run. I didn't get too hard on myself if I had to eat meat for convenience and just let it happen over time. I also started going on retreats to yoga ashrams and visited Buddhist temples where they cook home grown vegetarian dishes, which I found absolutely delicious and filling. I cook with a lot of recipes I found from these places and a lot of Indian type dishes as well :) On top of the feminising, anti ageing results I also noticed a HUGE boost in my energy levels and mood. I could eat big meals and not feel sluggish :)"

We are talking sausage links for breakfast, chicken fingers for lunch, and hamburger for dinner.  12-31-14 I ate my last meat meal. . . 2 brats standard condiments and pasta.    81 days no meat and I, like Zoltan2069 am meat free and no longer feel the need for it.    There are so many alternatives and so many things that to me even taste better than meat.    This was all part of my dedication to transition and rather than thinking it would be a hindrance it has become a catalyst for my change that I need to make myself a better person, both inside and outside.  Ohhhhhhh stomach problems are a thing of the past!!"

On that note if I'm going out in the sun always apply sunscreen, I have a small tube of tinted SPF 50+ moisturiser I carry in my pocket everywhere.  At night, I've used a few different night creams, but now just use straight jojoba oil on my face. Always use an eye cream, I, using an Elizabeth Arden one I picked up duty free last time I was travelling, but I've tried a few any things better than nothing.   I think everyone's skin reacts differently so you will have to try a few to see what works best. The trick is to be consistent in applying :)"
transtimelines,2zselb,LouLou_The_Clown,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:15:48 2015 UTC,Be wicked careful with jojoba oil. You should switch back and forth to other oils every so often. Using only jojoba can cause your skin to start rejecting it. It happened to me...it wasn't pretty! I'm gonna add some links to this comment when I get home. I just don't wanna see anyone else experience it

Women come in all shapes and sizes and I finally stopped telling myself I was to big, to hairy, had to big of feet, voice to deep to transition.  Those were excuses that let me hide in fear and fear is a powerful motivator but a destructive one.  If your truth is trans then those details shouldn't matter.  Hrt isn't going to change your bone structure.  The ligaments may shrink but as aesthetically pleasing as that is it's probably not beneficial for longevity and joint pain.  Bigger bones and smaller ligaments could be a recipe for disaster.  My hands have always been small wasn't a very good pianist because of that fact.

transtimelines,2zjjr7,pain-and-panic,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:08:43 2015 UTC,Hey not sure if you know about this but there is a transgender women’s group at the Q center.   http://www.pdxqcenter.org/programs/transgender/womens-group/
transtimelines,2zjjr7,pain-and-panic,1 point,Thu Mar 19 04:50:44 2015 UTC,I've known about it for a while. I'm unimpressed with the Q Center's politics and concerned about the make up of the group. I don't know how much help it would be for me if it's all older transitioners with families. Know anything about it?
transtimelines,2zjjr7,misfortune1,2,Thu Mar 19 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"The Q center has had a lot of political upheaval lately. There is a new board and stuff and they have a trans woman on the board now. I'm not really that involved in that part. They give us a place to meet and I trust the woman who they asked to join the board. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Groups like this are always in flux, currently we have a range of ages from 18 to 70 something, all in various stages of transition. There are quite a few of us in our 30's, hopefully that's not too old for you. Family issues have come up, but it doesn't dominate the topics discussed.   I've helped facilitate the meeting a few times. For me just being around other trans women helps, even if I'm just helping other people get answers to questions about trans things. Of course going out to eat together afterwards is lots of fun. I've made some good friends through the group.   Feel free to drop by, if it's not your thing I understand."

transtimelines,2z9vt4,starbuxed,6,Tue Mar 17 00:18:37 2015 UTC,I think a lot of trans people feel the need to overcompensate by being super feminine/masculine (depending on which way they're transitioning) to ensure passing.  I'm only genderqueer but i'm AFAB so i will admit i dress butcher than would be natural for me because otherwise people read me as solely female.
transtimelines,2z9vt4,starbuxed,3,Tue Mar 17 00:23:37 2015 UTC,feel the need to overcompensate by being super feminine/masculine    But... but... skirts show off DESE LEGS

Then when I saw what it was I actually cried looking through your pics and ur timeline.  I have to commend you on your journey it couldn't have been easy to make such a huge change.  I hope u have supportive people in ur life bc u deserve that.  Thank you for sharing I think your brave and should be proud of yourself for being yourself on the inside and outside. I would have never ever ever guessed the bearded guy was u. You just look natural and fem :)   Please keep ur head up and smile more.
transtimelines,2z8mb7,naked-singularity,3,Mon Mar 16 16:24:48 2015 UTC,Aww thank you :) Everyone in my life tells me to smile more and be happy! It's hard because I put up such a guard because I am so terrified of people but I am slowly getting over that anxiety and I'll remember your comment when I start to freak out! My wifey and boys are my world and she supports me.
transtimelines,2z8mb7,idreamofsissy,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:38:25 2015 UTC,I think that u are a great inspiration to people.  Sharing your story has made me more aware of the struggles that exist for some. Anxiety is something I deal with daily so it's not easy to just smile bc u have to figure out why ur feeling the way u do and then try and change things and that's all exhausting.  You never ever know what someone is dealing with internally. I'm so glad ur family is there that's so important to be loved and feel loved.  I hope that you can draw some strength from that and some people here and ignore the assholes. You can't please everyone.  Many many years of happiness to u ur wife and kiddos. They really have someone amazing to look up to and that's awesome. Step one was sharing ur story I hope ur anxiety starts to lessen and u can live happily especially for ur kids.

transtimelines,2z8mb7,idreamofsissy,2,Tue Mar 17 08:31:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the late response. I am conflicted. Is it a great company for Transgender people? In my experience, yes! Is it a great company? No. Target went to shit in general about a year and a half ago, and in my opinion sucks to work for now.   But when I started no one knew I was trans except for the hiring manager. Due to the government shutdown of 2013 my ID update (name change and gender marker change) was delayed. When I applied for Target, I had used my now name and true gender. However, when I was offered the job I hadn't been able to get my ID changed due to said government shutdown. I explained in private to the hiring manager. They didn't give a shit and still hired me on as my now name and true gender, they just asked I update them once I got it changed! This is technically something they shouldn't have done since by the books they hired someone who had yet to legally exist. Kind of like hiring an illegal immigrant with false information.   Then I went into training. Their training was a lot of videos. But one video was all about Target diversity. It featured gay and lesbian couples who worked for the company and a lot of ""alternative"" looking people. I.e., pink mohawks and piercings. They explained that Target was all about diversity!   I seemed to never get ""clocked"" at work and it was great!... Until I made the mistake of telling my gay coworker I was trans. I figured, hey Blank I can trust you and I want to get something off my chest. Next thing I know that big mouth went around and told everyone. Did it change how I was treated? Not one bit. But, I didn't feel as comfortable. Combine that with other issues, and I left the company.  Read this post about Target's issues"

I'll probably wait to see how things pan out at my current job, but it's good to know I have options. That's really shitty how your coworker went around outing you to everyone else. It's a shame how hard it is to find someone that can actually be trusted.  Also, I totally spaced this in my first comment, but you look AMAZING!!"

Parents have been mixed from what I can tell, but no major issues. I am going to do an AMA on transitioning as a teacher at some point. I think we did it right, and that lead to an easy transition.   The students knew for years I was female... my voice, mannerisms, interactions with male and female students, etc all gave it away. It took the district almost a year from coming out to being ready to go full time, and I am glad we took the time.   I teach in a school district in Southern California."

transtimelines,2z349e,misfortune1,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"yeah i understand it clearly !!!!! actually when you are a guy other people or at least ,girls never compliments you! just because they  fear to make you rude ! but to be honest you were a good looking but being happy girl is so better than upset handsome! its worth it to be yourself my dear!"
transtimelines,2z349e,misfortune1,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:33:17 2015 UTC,it has become worth it. more than i expected or hoped. thank you.

transtimelines,2z349e,misfortune1,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:53:56 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad that you asked, and also gave some indication of your field of practice. I have found that patients who knew me before, respect me more for my courage and happiness - clearly so much more alive and vivid that my old self; colleages are sensitive to my requests at pronouns and preferred name, and in the same spirit of a 'happier' version of myself, they too lend their support. I find myself more able to cope with my daily affairs, and sometimes, yes, I go into a patient's room and feel a slight hesitation, but it never gets in the way of the exams or history - most people are there for their own issues, and if they do talk about (many don't because they don't want to offend) your transition, 90% of the time, I notice it is a compliment or a good thing. It is worth it. I started hormones, waited for change, then picked a solid date, and asked everyone to call me by my preferred name and gender pronouns with notice. the compliance is hard, but the rewards are worth it."

In any regard to what I said, I'd like to say your timeline is very inspirational for me. I'm in therapy trying to figure out if transition will make me happier. Every timeline like this I see gets me a little closer to having the courage."
transtimelines,2z27q3,tptptp,2,Sun Mar 15 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks. Yeah, transition is difficult and if you're anything like me life can seem pretty crappy at times, but transition went beyond a simple want at some point with me and became something I had to do. I wish I had had more time to think about it, but it was more about survival at that point. And keep in mind that mtf and ftm are only two paths in an endless expanse of gender identity and presentation, so even if the whole transsexual thing doesn't work out for you for some reason, there are so many ways to express yourself and you always have the right to change your mind. Your body, your rules."

transtimelines,2z27q3,Jennica,5,Sun Mar 15 03:21:38 2015 UTC,I think you look great. I think you just think your face is pretty masculine because you're used to see it that way and it just resembles you of it.

transtimelines,2z27q3,thegreatistcornholio,4,Sun Mar 15 09:30:14 2015 UTC,"May I make a suggestion, I think getting your eyebrows professionally shaped at a salon would help alot with some of the  feminine shape you're looking for. There's a bunch of make up forums on Reddit to check out but you will be amazed what a difference darn eyebrows make! But keep up the good work, you look more beautiful with each passing day"
transtimelines,2z27q3,allthemolecules,4,Sun Mar 15 06:50:55 2015 UTC,Also maybe some new glasses.. It can dramatically change your look! Your can get glasses on the cheap at zennioptical.com or goggles4u.com :)

transtimelines,2z27q3,SyCottic,1 point,Sun Mar 15 09:43:46 2015 UTC,"I'm getting no satisfaction with the local salons, mostly due to language barrier I suspect... I can't convince them to take off a lot. Maybe they're worried about leaving a large expanse of plucked hair for me to maintain. I'm going to try a slightly more upscale place that will listen to me. The other problem is that my eyebrows grow like kudzu and they're wiry and unmanageable, so they're kind of an uphill battle and I mostly just capitulate. :P I get a lot of comments to this effect so I'll do what I can"
transtimelines,2z27q3,confusa-,2,Sun Mar 15 09:28:33 2015 UTC,You look awesome! If you're going to have your eyebrows shaped for the first time definitely go someplace where you can explain exactly what you want. After that you can maintain them as needed. I personally prefer threading to any other method.

It will take time and work. You can't expect to just turn into a girl once you start HRT. It's learning how to do make up, your clothes, posture, etc. Don't let anyone discourage you from the journey, especially yourself."

There are a ton of beautiful women on here that pre-HRT you may not have thought they would pass, but they totally do. You have soft features and what looks like sparse facial hair. I don't see any reason why you wouldn't pass. Beyond that, if you don't feel that HRT does enough to help you pass there is always facial feminization surgery. Good luck on your journey!"

transtimelines,2ywsei,ducksrevenge,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"Of course you have a chance at passing!  HRT will do awesome stuff for you - but you'll do things like, shaping your eyebrows, growing out your hair, buying new clothes, working on your voice and posture.   All of that together will help you feel more feminine and help you get to a happier place. Passing doesn't always just come naturally - but through the whole journey you take, you'll find ways to help yourself adjust.  Don't distress right now. Be excited you've found a path you want to follow. Do your best to keep your head up and realize it does get better!"

transtimelines,2yqe1o,hudsonvall,6,Wed Mar 11 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"Okay...here's the thing.  We are trans.  It sucks.  It's a daily struggle.  And we get this question entirely too often from people who suddenly think that the revelation of our trans-ness is free license to ask us about our junk.    Some people will share.  Others are not so inclined.  But if someone you just met walked up to you and the first thing they said was, ""Hi!  I noticed you're a woman.  Do you shave your vagina??  Sorry...just super curious."" I'd wager you'd be shocked and taken aback.  If not, good for you, but I think you'd agree that's not the type of question you ask in polite company...and you being a woman does not give them the right to ask invasive questions.  We're just people, just like you.  Before you ask ask something potentially personal, at the very least, ask permission first.  But honestly, you don't need to know what's in someone's pants unless you guys are headed to bed together.  It's just none of your business."
transtimelines,2yqe1o,HaveILostItAll,4,Thu Mar 12 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"That was a fantastic answer and I appreciate your taking the time to write. I agree, if someone came up to me and asked about my vagina shaving habits, I'd be pretty taken aback. However, if someone who I'll never meet and who, for me, doesn't even have a face, asked that in a woman-oriented sub, I might answer, I might not.   I really do understand this is a very personal question and a sensitive one for people who have transitioned in whatever capacity. It doesn't matter to me in any way if people are pre or post or never going to get that operation at all. I think I phrased my question incorrectly because I was really just curious about how common it is that people even get that operation (since it seems to me like a big fucking deal to get) and perhaps asking it in that way would've been better received and felt less personal (maybe). I really wasn't expecting lots of people to answer but I wasn't intending to be offensive, of course. Just curious and wanting to know more."
transtimelines,2yqe1o,HaveILostItAll,5,Thu Mar 12 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for being teachable on this.  It is something we're sensitive to because we experience it so often in real life.  It also kinda has the air of ""So which of you are real women (post-op), and which are just drag queens?""  You may not have meant it that way, but since it has no bearing on anything at all with regards to us and our stories, it just feels like you're trying to categorize us based on some meaningless standard.    It's hard enough meeting these arbitrary standards of ""passability"" to avoid having our asses kicked in a public restroom...and now we've got idiot legislators trying to pass inane laws that would require genital inspection or blood testing to enforce.    For those of us who never intend to go under the knife, it's invalidating.  We're still women...for those of us who haven't yet, but desperately wish we could, it makes us feel even more ""incomplete"" or like impostors.   Just take the response as a learning moment and we'll be happy to have you around.  We love allies!  If you have doubts as to the sensitivity of a given question, first ask yourself if you'd appreciate the question turned around on you, and then if still unsure, preface it with a disclaimer.  A little empathy goes a long way! :-)"
transtimelines,2yqe1o,HaveILostItAll,4,Thu Mar 12 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"What a beautiful answer. And it was a very good learning lesson for me. Even though I'm nameless and faceless, there are people on the other end of the computer who have feelings and a hell of a lot of struggles in life every day. Again, I find everyone in here really inspiring and am amazed at what you all experience."

transtimelines,2yqe1o,quatkum,8,Wed Mar 11 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"That's a fairly invasive question to ask. If someone wants to be open about such things that's fine, but it's still pretty rude to just ask someone Hey have you had the surgery? Best to leave such information between the persons doctor and whoever they may be intimate with."
transtimelines,2yqe1o,Kaylee212,4,Wed Mar 11 23:34:24 2015 UTC,Are you fucking serious?
transtimelines,2yqe1o,margueritelo,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"That ""lunch meat"" question definitely puts things into perspective! haha I appreciate the in-put! It's important for me to keep hearing from people why this question was so disruptive and upsetting. Your experiences in the world, from my perspective, are so unique. Ya know, a few years ago, I read ""Stone Butch Blues"" by Leslie Feinberg and it was a fucking great book. Maybe I need to re-read it and remember what I learned from there."
transtimelines,2yqe1o,djf87,2,Sat Mar 14 12:09:27 2015 UTC,"Per your edit:  If you want to learn go and read through the thousands of posts on r/asktransgender from people that are struggling to make it. Read the posts made by people that are so torn by what transition could do to their lives,  and yet they know they have no choice because they can't go on living the way things are. Read the posts from so many trans youth that are desperately crying out for help when everyone in their life ignores and even tries to squash their identity.   If you want to learn about what it's like to be trans in today's world then ask that, but that is not remotely what you asked here."
transtimelines,2yjnyu,Zoey1x3,8,Tue Mar 10 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"I really hope i can help someone by posting this. When i first came out, these trans subreddits were pretty big for me. Seeing successful transitions and people being happy in life was really important. But there was never anyone my height on here. It got to me so much, it made me feel like transition being this tall was impossible. If there's anyone reading this in a similar situation, i promise you, height is not a big deal. It really, really isn't. There's gonna be times where it may feel like it, but honestly, it's a tiny bump in the road. It can work to your advantage. I'm here if you need to speak to me. By far, i don't mean to idolise my transition, but i wouldn't wish feeling like transition is impossible on anyone, and if i can help reassure you even a small bit, i'm here for you.

transtimelines,2yjnyu,notnowlewis,7,Sun Mar 15 11:25:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh! Only 10 years too late (ish). From 0 to 18 years old or so, i always felt majorly like i was in the wrong body. I remember times where i'd look at my scrodum and wonder if i had a vagina behind there. Was very often depressed and actually felt better when i x-dressed. Because of how i was feeling and because i was so tall (7'2"" at my tallest), i got saught out genetic testing. My pituitary gland was just fine, i didn't qualify for Marfans, however it was discovered that i do have Klinefelter's Syndrome. Giving me an extra X chromosome, xxy, and i cannot produce testosterone naturally. With that information in mind, i thought long and hard what road i wanted to follow. I felt very comfortable as a woman and in womens clothing. But was it just because i've always had more estrogen than testosterone in my body? My ultimate decision weighed heavily on my vanity (i don't believe i'd make a pretty woman/ i'd make a better looking guy, also i'd never be able to find clothing that -I'd- want to wear. Being 7'2"", a size 22 shoe, i'd never find pretty clothes, i thought!) also my living arrangement, growing up in a small close minded southren town, i'd be out casted. So in the end, at 19, i decide Testosterone therapy was best for me!   It's almost been 10 years, and i'm quite happy being a man. Sporting a beard, wearing clothes that fit well, (shoes are terrible to find!), engaged to a beautiful woman. But there are still times i wonder if i made the right choice. I wonder how i would have turned out if i took that other path.   Thankfully i have a really lovung and supportive partner who understands my plight, and is willing to engage my occassional feminine urges in whatever way springs up. Be it sexual, emotional, or whatever, she's supportive and non-judgemental! She often jokes i'm more of a lady than she is, and vice versa. (In that she is a mechanic and likes ""manly"" things like that. Where as i'm more interested in not getting dirty or knowing how to rebuild an engine from scratch. It's a running joke, but we both know that mechanics and dirt doesn't belong to one gender.)  note I'm not trying to suggest anything, not that anybody should only go one way or make the same decisions i made. I'm simply sharing my story."

transtimelines,2yjnyu,MasterChilds,1 point,Tue Mar 10 14:03:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly wish i had looked into it more and didn't feel as pressured to make such a big jump. Everything comes into play; religion, your area/demographics, friends, family, school, personal beliefs and maturity, etc. So many factors to consider! And i think a great point to make, especially for people who cannot produce one or both horomones, is that there isn't a rush to make that radical jump. Give yourself time to process EVERYTHING.   I only have that weary/self doubt/feminine like feeling a couple times a year. Usually under stressful and emotional times. Even though i hate that i literally made the decision to go full male in 72 hours, without really thinking, i do think male is the correct way for me to lean. (Not that there is a correct way!) As much as i try to act manly, though, through body hair, full on chin beard (mustashe/goatee is trying to grow!), muscles, and a husky manly shape, i'll still always have that extra X to remind me who i REALLY am. I kinda like to consider myself ""genetically hermaphrodite"" as incorrect as that actually may be. Still got a full set of male working parts. But as we see a LOT on here, that definitely doesn't make you a man.   /.done running your ear off lol =p"

You had a very masculine-looking chin and face shape before, but now you're completely feminine. You look gorgeous! Seriously, if you were to overlay a shot of you pre-HRT with a current photo, it wouldn't even come close to matching up."
transtimelines,2yge52,Cereaza,1 point,Wed Mar 11 10:22:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I guess my face has changed a bit but only a little. It's one of the hurdles of my transition. Whenever I post online and sometimes to new people I meet my face outs me. My jawline is just so masculine.  My face and ribcage still make me feel sick when I look in the mirror, but I'm slowly crossing things off the list cause it used to be my face, ribs, chest, hips, ands thighs.   I still feel suicidal sometimes about my body but HRT saved my life. I would not be here today if I wasn't an estrogen filled mess"

Technically a brow lift is facial surgery, but way down the list of things that is usually part of FFS; brow contouring/bossing, cheek implants, jaw surgery etc.  Cost was ~$5k with surgery in Mexico. Pain is relative, but for me minimal, and recovery didn't take long. About 3-4 weeks to heal, and I was active from basically day one."

It's just that I've been lucky enough to be able to collect it much of my life, whereas you got a late start, so I thought perhaps I could put together a little care package of sorts."

transtimelines,2xvww6,Leeloo0,11,Wed Mar 4 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"This is actually quite rude. Just because someone feels negatively about their body because of societal standards does not mean we should negatively assume anything about them. This person might have a ""tight crop"" but there it is no fault of their own. They are beautiful no matter if you see it or not.   You too OP. You look great."
transtimelines,2xvww6,slacc,2,Wed Mar 4 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if I offended the OP I sincerely apologize.  I was only trying to make the point (in a jokey way) that with a face as beautiful as hers, if she is getting called Sir, then there must be other factors to explain it."
transtimelines,2xvww6,Leeloo0,2,Fri Mar 6 18:13:18 2015 UTC,How is it a joke or funny to make fun of somebody who doesn't feel comfortable in their body?

Up to laser 7 or so, and its finally showing.   Lately I've been able to give less of a fuck about peoples opinions, which is surprising since I had crushing social dysphoria for the last few months. Still obviously not FT though I don't know if I'm even aiming for that to be honest, I just want to be comfortable and atm that's beginning to happen in jeans and a t.   I'm occasionally being gendered female, tho most of the time it's male. It hurts but I care less than I did earlier. Kind of just embracing the madness that is being trans, I guess. I don't have much hope of cis passing privilege without FFS, and I'm dirt broke so I don't see that happening."

transtimelines,2xro6n,RocketQ,3,Tue Mar 3 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"I went to Dr. Cardenas in Guadalajara, Mexico for my FFS. I had a rhinoplasty, eyebrow lift, and Type III Forehead shaving/reconstruction. Note that the areas on my face where the surgeries were performed (mainly bone and nose cartilage) are, for the most part, affected very little by HRT. My hope was to pass very early on in my transition, so FFS was a step I wanted to take early.  I am 100% happy with my nose, 100% happy with my eyebrows, and somewhere between 75-90% happy with my forehead.   My confidence in my forehead varies day to day depending on the makeup I wear or the hairstyles I have. I am still finding angles where my forehead displays brow ridge bone even though my boyfriend and everyone else constantly try and reassure me that my imperfections are only noticeable to myself.  But otherwise, I am definitely in a better place passing-wise because of the surgery."
transtimelines,2xro6n,RocketQ,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:23:46 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, I was considering him myself but honestly I had heard some discouraging stories about him. What was the quality of his clinic and after care like?   Thanks so much for answering by the way!"

I have taken to wearing a sports bra when im out and about as to not be nipping out. (sorry if tmi) Idk only the future will tell hopefully they will fill out with time. And thanks btw.
transtimelines,2xcn09,AugustAnna,4,Fri Feb 27 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yay..so happy for you.    Good for posting as an older MtF myself on HRT 3 months at 46 y/o, it's great to see the changes at might happen.    Awesome!"
transtimelines,2xcn09,midsouthwendy,2,Fri Feb 27 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I was a bit shy about posting since there are only a couple of pics of my transition. But this group is what helped me decide to transition and I was always bummed there weren't more timelines of older girls. So figured I should share for others like myself."
transtimelines,2xcn09,midsouthwendy,3,Fri Feb 27 14:18:54 2015 UTC,I am happy for you beyond words.    I'm a freak since I'm transitioning to.....?  Certainly not f/t female....anything.    There has been much discussion about older girls being able to pass either way on extended HRT.  For me the interest is in being able to maintain boy mode (if I  want to -and I do).  What are your current thoughts on that idea? Other than why?  You have got it going on..  I'm going (try) to be the one that can pass boy mode or..... there is going to be hell to pay.
transtimelines,2xcn09,midsouthwendy,4,Fri Feb 27 14:29:02 2015 UTC,"I truly believe the concept of passing is toxic to the well being of trans women. Do what makes you feel best and fuck the rest. I will likely never ""pass"" but I don't care, I am doing what is best for me on my terms.   I went back and forth on whether I was going to consider myself female or genderqueer. As time has gone on I have realized that I lean much more towards female. I still rock boy mode due to work (truck driver so on the road in sketchy places a lot) but moving more towards authentic expression even then.   To transition on HRT and maintain boy mode is possible just will really depend on your choice of style. Mones' will change some aspects of appearance (mainly bewbs) but if you work towards a overall style that reflects what you want to express you can do whatever you want."
transtimelines,2xcn09,AdaArmstrong,2,Fri Feb 27 14:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree completely with everything you said.  I guess we are in the minority...but then again, we are older statistically than most. I'm personally going for a middle of the road look, with enough female in my presentation/expression to raise one, but not both eyebrows.  It may be 100% female, but without a body transplant I will never have people perceive me as female, but you are correctly thinking..I needed to adjust my thinking. So thanks.."
transtimelines,2xcn09,BrandiMcC,3,Fri Feb 27 14:59:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! I am 39.8 and also at about the 7 month HRT mark. I am feeling better everyday, and the more I go out presenting my authentic self, the harder it is to put on my boy costume for work. I am not even attempting to pass as a woman, but I sure feel more like myself than when I got here! I am starting to raise eyebrows (and my brows are on point!), and I like it. I am a beautiful and confounding creature and if I blow the squares' minds, I'm performing a valuable public service.  Keep up the good work, sweetie!"

Your last couple pictures give me hope.    And you're right.  We will probably never pass 100% but at our age it might not be a possibility.
transtimelines,2xcn09,danaEscott,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:58:00 2015 UTC,Question.  Has it been difficult to present in either direction.
transtimelines,2xcn09,midsouthwendy,2,Fri Feb 27 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"Not really, but I have a very don't give a fuck attitude about what random people think. I don't exist to please them and do what is best for me. Sure there are times I get a little nervous going somewhere crowded but just push on and do it and everytime it gets a little easier.  I sort of soft launched by doing a little eye makeup, women's jeans and simple women's shoes with a basic t-shirt. Stuff like that, Got over the inital fears of people staring by doing just small things, then it got easier and I began kicking it up a bit more and a bit more. Now I able to go out fully dressed and made up and feel fairly comfortable."

It looks great both curly and straightened, which is super awesome and makes me so jealous (since some curly hair doesn't like to be straightened and ends up soooo frizzy/dead looking)  Do you use any special hair products?

transtimelines,2x5ids,guisar,3,Thu Feb 26 02:42:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome progress! I have a question for you though. In your earlier pics you still seem to have a 5-o'clock shadow going on, but by the last pic your skin looks flawless! Did you do anything to combat the facial hair?"
transtimelines,2x5ids,Valtharius,3,Thu Feb 26 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"I learned to shave very very close with a dual edged safety razor. There's a block of soap with one of those little barber brushes and I build a lather that way instead of spray-can foam. I go once over with the grain, slowly, to remove most of the hair, then reapply the lather over my upper lip and chin and go very patiently against the grain.  After the shave I moisturize. With that, even my coarse hair takes a day to grow in enough that I can feel it.  I did not learn to do that overnight, and the gods of hygiene tasted much of my blood in the process. I plan to get electro (probably sorta funded by my parents) because the hair is so blonde. I honestly hate shaving lol."
transtimelines,2x5ids,Shea_it_isnt_so,2,Thu Feb 26 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"Facial hair, it's the worst!!! I will be so glad when my skin is clear, but I will kinda of miss the luxury of the brush and warm feel of the foam of that soap.  Mmmm, the smell of rosemary in it too."

It might've done about another year, a few years back, but different dosage, different doctor. I've decided on FFS, I get misgendered too much for my taste. Last note is technical, I tried to fix the lighting on it 'cause they're all backlit, sorry, they came out a little blown out and I don't have better pictures over time. And I'm a little shaggy in the face still, not done with electrolysis yet. No makeup. There's about a 3 year spread, middle one was a little over a year ago."

There is this notion of blending in, which for us late life transitioners is all about doing only things that won't draw us any attention. We are supposed to do our best to become completely invisible. Yet that is exactly how I felt as a male. I want to be seen now. My aunt had a style that was actually pretty eccentric, and she got noticed everywhere she went, but that was exactly who she was. I am going to be me as well."

I'm actually writing a paper on her for my Pop music in America class. ""How Laura Jane Grace being a transgender person has affected the band and her"" I'm studding their lyrics( how many and what songs are about gender identity and dysphoria), concerts before coming out and after, interviews. its becoming a 30 page paper."

That sounds awesome! I'd love to read that. Band dynamics are usually hard enough with big egos clashing, but when the lead singer (who in music arguably gets most of the attention) has such a major change the band gets pulled into their world as well.

I use CoverFX cream foundation, and Revlon cover stay. I like them both, the Revlon I find makes my face warmer in the summer than the CoverFX. I would just shave with an electric razor every morning and night and moisturize with whatever was in the cabinet at the time. It seemed to have worked."

And it is their timeline after all, let them show us how they want us to see it. The journey is very special and personal, I'd hate to try to put limits on what a timeline is and constrict their ability to share.

Yeah, the other stuff is annoying, but i do see them as confidence builders for some or perhaps an outlet for those looking for encouragement.    If anything, perhaps a recommendation that people don't do many of these things.

I had Dr Capitán, Dr Simon and Dr Bailón for the Maxillofacial surgery and Dr Bellinga for the Rhinoplasty.   I had...  Forehead reconstruction + brow reduction + hairline advancement Chinplasty Rhinoplasty  The biggest difference is my side profile, I should probably upload a before pic but can't find any which aren't awful!"

Would prefer not to post the cost if that's okay, but they were really  reasonable and their standard of care was excellent.  They were very friendly and professional. I had one other consultation elsewhere and Facial Team worked out to be a bit more cost effective, lovely management team, 3 surgeons plus one other dedicated rhinoplasty surgeon, also 2 nights hospital stay. In addition their forehead procedure was done as a reconstruction rather than filling it in to round it off.  There's a good explanation of the different procedures here...  http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/Forehead.html"

I have asked Facial Team to send me profile pictures because it's the feature I am the most worried about, so if you ever come across one and you find the bravery to post-it, it will be greatly appreciated (I absolutely understand if you don't though).

Do you have any before/after of your FFS specifically? in this timeline you just skip from beginning hrt to post-ffs so its hard to see what changes were ffs specific and what was hormones. as someone who would prefer to not get ffs unless absolutely necessary I like to see what people can achieve on hrt alone.  edit: HERP DERP I didnt notice the final pic. nevermind :P

Your face is really starting to feminize in the last couple of pictures.  (It's also looking a LOT clearer, as well, or you're doing a great job with makeup in hiding blemishes.)  I think you look a lot better with your hair down than back.  Somehow, having your hair back tends to point out the male features in your face, IMHO.  Good luck to you!"

transtimelines,2w7azg,laurenloves,6,Tue Feb 17 18:17:25 2015 UTC,"Finishing laser (not just on my face, but on my body as well), and voice surgery. I'm very dysphoric about my voice, and doing ""voice training"" only makes that worse. I don't want any part of me to seem like a put-on, especially something as personal as my voice. I don't want to have to worry about coughing and letting my ""dude voice"" slip out, or getting tired and having it slip. That's why I'm getting Yeson sometime this summer. After that, then I'll go full time.  Edit: I also don't think I'm really passable yet, and I really want to do the whole ""boy mode fail""/""forced to go full time"" thing."

transtimelines,2w7azg,DefinitelyNotwafle,5,Tue Feb 17 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure.

transtimelines,2w7azg,BrandiMcC,2,Wed Feb 18 00:18:43 2015 UTC,"I think your concerns about ""voice training"" are valid. For me (cis female), the biggest giveaway for transwomen who have been on HRT for a while and would pass otherwise is the voice, not necessarily because it's even too low, but because it sounds very forced/put on. I have a friend who recently came out as MTF, and her new voice is very ""valley girl"" (with associated mannerisms), which doesn't help her pass because it sounds forced to the point of being distracting.   For the record, based on looks alone, you don't come across as ""put-on."" You're rocking a natural look that works well. :)"
transtimelines,2w7azg,plentyofmelanin,3,Wed Feb 18 00:19:18 2015 UTC,"You look AWESOME :D Totally agree that I see a girl in a lot of those later pictures. I don't know how anyone can not look at you and wonder at this point!  Also, what do you do with your hair?? I love it! It looks very similar to mine, but, you know, good. I'm so frustrated with mine lately, I've just been living in a hat cause it's winter anyway :T"
transtimelines,2w7azg,tumblrbae,9,Tue Feb 17 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, apparently people are wondering. :D When I came out to a few friends of mine this semester (I'm abroad right now  and hopefully a broad by the time I get back) they said ""Yeah, I was wondering about the nips. They're a bit pointy...""   I've been maam'd a few times since January, when I moved out of the place I had been living and was able to femme up my appearance a bit. I'm in a country where I don't speak the language though, so I have no idea what gender strangers see me as now.  As for my hair, I do absolutely nothing to it. Shower, dry it off, and then maybe run my hands through it to simulate a wide toothed comb (which I keep forgetting to pick up at a store). My hair looks awful after being in a hat, and now that it's a little longer I'm finding it does a good job of insulating me itself."
transtimelines,2w7azg,tumblrbae,3,Tue Feb 17 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"DAMN seriously? I've been trying so fucking hard to do things with my hair lately! I mean, do you wash it every day? With shampoo? Conditioner? Do you just rub it dry with a towel? It just stays up out of your eyes on its own? Cause mine falls right into my face if I don't do something to keep it up. Aaagghhh I'm so jealous. Maybe I should get it cut a bit shorter, that would probably make it easier to handle... did you ask for a girls' cut last time you got a trim or anything? I'm wondering what I should ask for next time I go."
transtimelines,2w7azg,AllOverMyTransBody,3,Tue Feb 17 18:32:21 2015 UTC,"I wash it once every few days. Probably twice a week. Definitely not every day (though it changes depending on how much I go to the gym). I use a normal amount of shampoo, and a liberal amount of conditioner that I try to leave in for most of my shower. The other days I just use water. I rub it sort of dry with a towel, but let it air dry past that point. Some days it looks a lot worse than these pictures, but that's a pretty honest representation of what it usually looks like. I'm trying to grow mine out longer. How long is yours now?  Edit: I did ask for a girls cut the last time I went in for a trim. I looked up queer/gay friendly salons in my area, and found a highly recommended one. Places like that don't seem to blink twice when a male-presenting person asks for a girls cut."
transtimelines,2w7azg,iratasum,2,Tue Feb 17 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"In the back, it reaches down to just between my shoulder blades, and about to my lower lip in front. I haven't shampooed it in weeks, but I do co-wash it every day. Maybe I shouldn't, it's not like I go to the gym and sweat a bunch. I do wear a hat pretty much any time I'm out of my room but mostly that just gives me hat hair, it doesn't make it greasy or anything. I've been patting/squeezing it dry with a t-shirt and then letting it air dry, but that takes foooooreeeeveeeer. A lot of times I lose patience and go out into the cold when it isn't quite dry yet, which probably doesn't help."
transtimelines,2w7azg,ice-cream_dreams,2,Tue Feb 17 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"I saw that you're in Hungary right now. As a side note, it's a nice thing about the hungarian language, that it has only a single, genderless word for the 3rd person pronoun (ő). I suppose you already knew that, but others might find this interesting.  Anyways, you look great, and I'm jelly."

I'm pretty hairy, and it's incredibly obvious because of the contrast. Luckily, it makes laser work better, so I guess it balances out in a way..."

You are truly an inspiration <3"
transtimelines,2w1cz2,Sixthsomatic,13,Mon Feb 16 03:41:33 2015 UTC,You have been through a lot and are a very strong woman. You're also one of my favorite posters in the trans family of subreddits. Thanks for posting this!

It was interesting to see how other aspects of your life have been entangled the trans-related aspects. The accompanying photos made it all the more interesting.

transtimelines,2w1cz2,agriff1,3,Mon Feb 16 05:53:01 2015 UTC,"From ""Age 21"" You start getting younger!"
transtimelines,2w1cz2,CyanSheepMedia,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:19:40 2015 UTC,"That's sort of a thing about second puberty, for trans women and trans men both, it seems: we stop looking our age.   At 17, I was told I looked 25. At 30, I was told I looked 16. At 34, I was told I looked 20 (I was carded for drinks when I visited the U.S. — mysteriously, at the exact same place I used to deejay just five years earlier). At 40, I was told I looked 26. Now, I give the side-eye whenever anyone places me under 30, because it seems disingenuous, even if it really isn't intended as such.  I often think I look my age, but whenever I actually do run into cis people who are my age? Evidently not. They look a generation older."

I think you bring a refreshing sense of optimism, understanding, empathy, and opinions borne of a rich (though trying) life and a firm devotion to knowledge as a source of personal power.  I don't normally have role-models as such, but if I were to pick someone to want to be like at 41, you'd be a fantastic choice. Thank you for sharing your journey with us!"

I disagree with that mentality. I asked for help, and help was extended. I still don't know how this came to be. It just did.  I do hope you find a path to genital surgery, and soon. You deserve this and to be happier."

Make-up was on the floor in front of the mirror for a long time before I got a storage place for it closer to where I put it on. Why unplug the hair dryer and put it away when I'll just take it out tomorrow? Brush, chopstick, lotion, mirror, ect might as well be on the floor around where I tend to sit since I need them at random times/also get ready in that seat.  I'm messy, but my mess is more efficient. (So glad I get to ""throw away"" a lot of things soon.)"

transtimelines,2w06kb,trans-sister,5,Sun Feb 15 23:37:33 2015 UTC,I'd say that mode of the timelines posted here are people who started late-teens up to early-thirties and have at most five years of photos of transition ( and maybe a few from childhood). I think having a unique narrative perspective is helpful.

Hormones are amazing, and I am excited to see the future changes I can expect!   Gendered female in ""boy"" mode 50 - 70% of the time. Gendered female on the phone 100% of the time, treated as a girl everywhere, and I love it!   Expect to go full time in 4 - 5 months, part time everywhere but work before that!   Thanks for everyone's support!"

Both (especially the first) are incredibly low res and quality, so it really doesn't tell anything about what effect whatsoever hormones might have outside of that you seem to at least take better care of yourself, which is positive."
transtimelines,2vwk0j,EmmaCassandra,3,Sun Feb 15 00:29:46 2015 UTC,A touch rough but your calling them like you see them . Don't worry I know I have work ahead of me. Just felt like sharing and sorry forgot the potato quality pics.
transtimelines,2vwk0j,EmmaCassandra,2,Sun Feb 15 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"I apologise for my rough way of phrasing myself, I'm sick and at work in the middle of the night. (it's 3 am where I'm at right now).  Perhaps I should have stayed off the Internet.  What my point was more towards the line that the pictures pictures, while definitely shows a huge change (which I applaud, good for you), because the differences in how you were deciding to carry yourself in either (and the potato quality pictures), it's incredibly hard to judge the changes the hormones may have had, which at least for me personally is one of the reasons I came to this sub to begin with, to get an idea of what kind of effect hrt may have had over a certain amount of time for people either with similar age or build to myself, and I could imagine other people doing the same.   Still though, I can definitely understand you wanting to share your results (even if I personally am scared as a schoolgirl at the idea of posting my picture online), and I do wish you the very best on your journey forward. :-)"

I mean, I'm only around a 32B/34A, but padded bra's and all that.  However, I'm over joyed at what I have managed to get since  I was rail thin and effectively negative in the tit department.    Are you on injections, perform massage on your breasts?   Just Spiro & Estradiol and an over the counter progesterone cream from Amazon. I always mean to just sit around and play with them more, but mostly they just get massaged around 5-10 minutes every other day or so in the shower or when moisturizing."

transtimelines,2vnpnm,Ivyyz,6,Thu Feb 12 15:25:12 2015 UTC,"Congrats! I only have one question? Did you like ehm, pluck the top of your eyebrows? Because in the starting pics you have pretty nice angled brows and at the last picture they're straight. It might  be a preference, but usually you should never pluck at the top. Ignore me if you didn't, but just trying to give some advise."
transtimelines,2vnpnm,LuminousBubble,4,Thu Feb 12 17:47:38 2015 UTC,typically i just let my friends do whatever they want because for some reason my friends like making me look pretty. it's very possible they had done something to the tops of my eyebrows but all i ever do is get rid of the hair between them.
transtimelines,2vnpnm,LuminousBubble,3,Thu Feb 12 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"Okay (: I don't say it's a bad thing per definition, but higher and arched brows are typically more feminine. Males tend to have lower brows and by plucking the top it makes your brow look lower, thus more masculine. Plucking the bottom making it higher thus more feminine, an arch at the end also usually makes it look more feminine, so you could maybe give it a try next time to see if you like it x)   female brow arch"
transtimelines,2vnpnm,Ink_Bat,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:33:51 2015 UTC,My eyebrows have never really been a issue for me so i don't pay it much attention. I may try to do it in such a way at some point but it is unlikely but thank you anyways.

transtimelines,2v2nyy,femalehorizons,3,Sat Feb 7 07:31:09 2015 UTC,Your voice has definitely gotten better but I actually had to go back to your first video for comparison because it sounds so natural now it's hard to imagine it ever sounded different! Same goes for all the other changes. I've been following your story and obviously I've noticed changes but the transition has been so gradual that I didn't realize how drastic it was until I saw you back at day 1.   As for the name change I've always thought it would be nice to have input from my parents since they named me to begin with. Sort of if I was being reborn and they got to name me again. But I still think the choice should be yours and obviously ring true to you and your identity

transtimelines,2uysgz,PM_ME_UR_SINCERITY,3,Fri Feb 6 08:57:12 2015 UTC,"Part of it is that the first picture was from slightly upward and the new one was from slightly downward (because I was trying to keep the shadow from my lamp off my face, but also because it makes people look better.).  Part of that is that in addressing some of my depression by going on HRT, I naturally ate less (always been a stress eater). It came off my face and neck first.

transtimelines,2uugjd,biographer_seahorse,2,Thu Feb 5 13:05:02 2015 UTC,Thanks! I started on my 23rd birthday :)
transtimelines,2uugjd,biographer_seahorse,2,Thu Feb 5 14:43:28 2015 UTC,Any advice or other words of wisdom for someone just starting out? (I'm 25)
transtimelines,2uugjd,new_aphrodite,2,Thu Feb 5 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"Kick ass, take names, and don't let anyone hold you back. That's one of the biggest ones I've figured out. When you come out, not everyone is going to be cool and accepting, at least not 100%. It's gonna happen, especially as you begin transitioning. Remember it's not just you who is transitioning but the people around you as well. Even for my best friend, it was INCREDIBLY jarring to see me at first and there was even a one month period where we stopped talking completely because he was taking it a bit more poorly than we might've expected, despite him being supporting. I got sir'd very often early on but this eventually changed. Now when it (very rarely) happens, I tend to laugh it up thinking there's no way I can be getting sir'd and rather than assuming the worst I chalk it up to a person's general speech (i.e. people who call EVERYONE ""dude"" or ""bro"" regardless of gender).  Give people time. Some friends may be pretty plain as day asshats about it and there will be no changing their minds (of all my friends I had a whole one who ended up being that way) and you should certainly feel out if cutting them off is right or not. And who knows, somewhere down the road you may find your paths cross again. I had some friends who I cut ties with come back a year later saying it was such a small and stupid thing to throw away a friendship for. When it comes to family, they can often require a bit more time, especially immediate family. Both my parents were very unsupportive early on. It took them roughly 4 years before this changed and they stopped being so hostile. My dad still has some trouble ""getting it"" but he tries.  Lastly, don't be afraid to try new things! Some things will seem horribly daunting at first. Clothes shopping, makeup, just take these things one step at a time. I still struggle sometimes with clothes shopping because I tend not to think outside the box with what might look good on me at different times, but I've learned to love getting out there and trying stuff on. As for makeup, about two months into my transition my aunt bought me a ton of makeup. Good stuff too, like Smashbox. I left it untouched until January after a friend showed me how to apply it all a bit. I would always just feel so overwhelmed about it and how I'd be worried I was gonna do a bad job (and believe me, I've had my bad makeup days since) that I'd just keep putting off from trying at all. I've heard similar stories from other MTF friends. One of them didn't even touch makeup until she was 14 months in! It takes time but it's a blast once you get into it. Don't be afraid to make the mistakes and learn from them. Just look at what a year's difference in time and practice did for me, for example.  I could keep going on and on and I probably rambled a bit somewhere in there and fell off of my point a bit but those are a couple big points worth mentioning. Don't get discouraged, keep trying, and if you need advice, try your friends, maybe your family, and if all else fails the internet is always there for you. /r/transpassing, /r/asktransgender, /r/MakeupAddiction, and the like are open 24/7 after all. Best of luck in your transition! :)"
transtimelines,2uugjd,violaceous_trogon,2,Fri Feb 6 04:09:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the reply! I can't even describe how much it helps to be hearing this personally from someone who's transitioned so successfully.  I feel very fortunate to have acceptance from my dad (though he doesn't entirely understand), a wonderful girlfriend, and good job security, so I'm optimistic, though still pretty nervous sometimes! I go back and forth between feeling confident and comfortable, and feeling trepidation about every little thing. I'm not on HRT yet and my first endo appointment is a month and a half away, but even after that it'll probably be months before I even attempt girlmode. Maybe not, though! Two facelaser (laserface!) sessions have already made me so much happier with what I see in the mirror, with neutral boyishness coming to the forefront as the adult male subsides.  Your posts on here and on your transition blog has given me a huge boost of confidence. Like violaceous_trogon, I feel like I can see some of you in myself... I'm probably hopelessly projecting there, but all the same, thank you for putting your personal journey out there for the rest of us to see.  BTW: Favorite Opeth album? :)"
transtimelines,2uugjd,Solsken,2,Fri Feb 6 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"Aw thanks!  Yeah from what I understand dads can be like that. My dad is accepting but just doesn't get it from some angles, bringing up how he changed my diapers and knows what's there and how I often have, as he puts it, a vocabulary often reserved for truck drivers and sailors lol.  HRT changes A LOT. Not just physically but also mentally. You've seen how I look now, but how about just a week in? Very different. My mental state started clearing up about a month and a half in (that early period of hormones was very much an emotional roller coaster jumping between being more depressed than ever and being the happiest in my whole life) and I started feeling a bit more confident in my physical appearance around 2 months. I actually didn't go out girlmode for the first time until 2.5 months in and finally came out 3 months in. Note: I DEFINITELY didn't expect things to happen that fast, but sometimes life is full of surprises.  See at least you've gotten laser lol! It's too expensive for me with all my bills and not exactly getting enough money coming in at the moment, but I'm trying. I'm actually using my unexpected tax refund for my first session in a few weeks here. Really excited for that! Unfortunately my skin is real sensitive so I get razor burn bad no matter what I do and always, without exception, cut my face SOMEWHERE lol. Despite that though, the growth has slowed and the hair thinned to the point most people can't tell (especially with makeup and viewing from a distance). This is how I look 4 days unshaven as of a few months ago. Not very much there at all. Personally, it's one thing I say don't sweat too much about, but I know how dysphoric it can be for people. Not everyone transitions the same after all!  As for favorite Opeth album, are you serious? That's like trying to pick your favorite child lol. This answer changes a lot. Right now I'm gonna go with Watershed, with Blackwater Park and My Arms, Your Hearse bringing up the rear. That said, I haven't been listening to much death metal lately, even Opeth. If I am it's mostly been Eluveitie lol. I really need to catch up on my Cannibal Corpse for when I hit the meet n' greet next month here in Tampa.  That'll make for some more fun timeline action, as it's actually going to be my second time meeting them. That said, I'm typically all about my folk, symphonic, black, and pagan metals :3"
transtimelines,2uugjd,nerdcrest,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, from all your other pictures I had just assumed you were somehow lucky enough to avoid facial hair altogether! It seems like you've been dealing with it well. Congrats on being able to finally do some laser soon, though. It hurts like hell but the payoff is amazing; my second session's results have left me completely amazed. I didn't have much of a choice with it, because my facial hair growth had always been so thick and dark and visible, even when shaving every morning. I've always had the same problems with managing to slice myself up when shaving; I think laser has helped with that a bunch, unless I've somehow miraculously gotten better at shaving recently after years of failure.  I've read lots about the mental and physical effects of HRT, though I'm sure that all the reading in the world won't prepare me in the least for actually experiencing it myself. Excited but nervous. I've come out to a bunch of people online but no one at work knows yet, and the wild variability of HRT's effects leaves me wondering how best to approach the timing. It's definitely going to be a while before girlmode is a thing for me.  My favorite Opeth is probably Damnation, but I love Blackwater Park too. The Drapery Falls is amazing. Their proggy side has always been more closely aligned with my tastes than their metal side, though, and I've admittedly not exposed myself to all of their catalog. I ought to give Watershed another thorough listen sometime; it's been a long while and my tastes have changed so much since I last heard it. I could talk for hours about music but probably shouldn't try on a public Reddit thread! My music tastes would inadvertently out my real identity in an instant, plus I'm derailing your thread enough already, haha :D"

transtimelines,2ut6o3,misfortune1,3,Thu Feb 5 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"I approach hair care from two angles. One, the bottom up approach. Helping the body build better hair. Second, top down, making the hair I do have (and that grows) stronger. No procedures, no transplants. :P    Chemical:    Finasteride 5mg Daily:     Finasteride is a key part of the hair restoration puzzle. There’s lots and lots and lots of research on this with way more detailed articles than what I’m going to write down here. Essentially, it blocks dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which is a huge culprit of male pattern baldness.   Minoxidil 5% 2x a Day, Morning and Night (12 hours apart):     Minoxidil, otherwise known as Rogaine is another part of my treatment plan.   Foam minoxidil is nice but I’ve gone through almost all of the tubes now even though it was a 6 month supply. For the first month I was also using it improperly. In each application make sure to thoroughly work it in to your scalp. Even if you have thin hair! It has to get in there otherwise it won’t be effective. I now use the liquid stuff.    Viviscal 2x a Day, Morning and Night (12 hours apart): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JPJ2ZS/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1     The last part of my treatment plan. The main point of Viviscal is to supply my hair with the nutrients it needs. There are anecdotal reports of it also helping with baldness, though this is most likely due to the 1% finasteride solution contained within the tablets.   Hair Care (most of which I learned from /r/HaircareScience)    My routine is broken down into a day by day plan that includes shampoo, conditioning, and co-washing (washing with a conditioner).    Monday, Wednesday, Friday:     Shampoo (Shea Moisture Raw Retention Shampoo): I chose this shampoo for keeping my hair hair moist and hoping to avoid the oil problems, as well as the dry scalp that’ll cause dandruff.   I noticed a difference almost immediately. My dandruff went away, my hair was soft and not nearly as oily. No complaints. 3 months later and I’m still on the original bottle. The most difficult part is working it in using my fingertips. For the first month or so I was afraid to do that because I had so little hair up there, but it is important. Need to get the nutrients to the scalp.     Conditioner (Davines Deede Leave in Mist): This is a leave-in conditioner for fine hair that will keep it moist, not weigh it down, and protect it from heat damage.   The leave-in conditioner has worked well. One bottle lasted me about 2.5 months. I don’t know how much heat damage I’ve avoided but I really like how it provides a soft gel effect and holds hair in place. Lasts a few hours at least.    Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday     Co-washer (Shea Moisture Butter Restorative Conditioner): The conditioner I’m using as a shampoo. I hate not washing my hair every day and this is the solution that they came up with. Again, for fine, dry hair.   Amazing conditioner, absolutely love it. No complaints. As a co-washer it works extremely well. Maybe one day I’ll even be able to go a day without washing my hair. That’ll be amazing. Still on the first bottle after 3 months, haven’t gone through it yet.     Conditioner (Davines Deede Leave in Mist): This is a leave-in conditioner for fine hair that will keep it moist, not weigh it down, and protect it from heat damage (you’ll note it’s the same as above).   See above review.    Sunday:     Shampoo (L’Oreal Paris EverPure Volume Shampoo): This is to help with volume as well as clean everything else out, and protect from heat damage.   Conditioner (L’Oreal Paris EverPure Volume Conditioner): Part of the volumizer plan, might as well."
transtimelines,2ut6o3,msgallows,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try and not get too excited about your hair results! My base line right now is somewhat better than where yours was at. How many years was your hair as thin as in picture 2? I'm 32 right now, my hair is been slowly thinning out since around 25.  I just ordered Dutasteride because it inhibits much better than Finasteride (according to research) and significantly enhances effects of Spiro (so I hear). I'm excited but going to keep YMMV in mind.  You look great. Congrats."
transtimelines,2ut6o3,msgallows,2,Thu Feb 5 07:12:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah dutasteride is way more effective. I wish I'd gone that route but my insurance didn't cover finasteride or dutasteride, and dutasteride was like 5x the price at my pharmacy....    Ummm.. I'd say that it'd be that way for a few years at least. It was definitely slowly getting worse. Whenever my mom cut my hair she'd always remark how thin it was getting :(    The key is providing your hair with the nutrition it needs and keeping it strong. Don't do anything that damages it (like towel drying, blow drying, washing with hot water, etc)"
transtimelines,2ut6o3,originalme1,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"To tell you the truth I snagged it through a Canadian Pharmacy online. All told it was about $130 for a four month supply. It's kind of my ""I'll be responsible and not DIY while I wait for my letter but I'm at least getting this.""  I'll take your advice and be more gentle with it from now on. You obviously know what you're doing even if YMMV.  Are you still using Rogaine? I tried it for a few months and saw no results except for greasier hair, after a while my existing hair looked damaged by the vehicle the minox is carried in. It would probably be hard for you to gauge the efficacy of minox because you're doing so much other stuff."
transtimelines,2ut6o3,originalme1,2,Thu Feb 5 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"You have to apply minoxidil carefully. Def follow the instructions. I put it just where it needed to go, which was the very top of my head and did it religiously. One note though.    Think of DHT as poison. It literally kills your hair follicles. The minoxidil is fertilizer. You're putting fertilizer in the ground to make your plants grow better, but you aren't eliminating the poison that's killing your plants. Minoxidil is a stop-gap solution, and it won't work in a toxic environment."

transtimelines,2uc1vo,kirinizzi,2,Mon Feb 2 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"You look incredibly feminine, I adore your hair! From the way you worded your photos im assuming you're UK based, am I right? If so, how was the process for getting hormones?   I have my first GIC appointment in a couple weeks and am nearly a year RLE, not sure what to expect really!"
transtimelines,2uc1vo,onion_cat,2,Sun Feb 1 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"Hey! Sorry, I was asleep so my answer is super slow! :P  I actually self-medicated, as I started them about three months or so prior to my first appointment at the gender clinic. Funnily enough, my next one, the fancy third one that will hopefully get me prescribed hormones, is on the anniversary of when I first started them. Go figure. I basically did months and months of research prior, and bought them off an online pharmacy. It was really expensive, especially as I was only 18 at the time. Mind you, I'm only 19 now, but it seems so young. :3  In terms of getting prescribed hormones, they usually make you go through a period of RLE (I started mine in October with an official change of name, although I'm stressed about it as my form of 'work' is volunteering three days a week, and I can't afford any ID, so I'm not sure if I'm doing a good enough job- but I shouldn't whine about that while I'm trying to answer your question! :P) and assess your suitability in a 'network meeting', which is basically where you and a family member/close-friend/significant other/someone who knows you really well meet with the two clinicians you've seen in your previous two appointments. If they have enough to diagnose you with gender dysphoria, or believe that you are suitable for their aid, they will refer you on to an endocrinologist and continue to provide ongoing supportive appointments in intervals of around three months, I believe.  However, seeing as you have already done a year of RLE (wow, I would never have had the guts to do full-time before I had been on hormones for a while, I think that's amazing!), as long as you can bring along supportive documentation, I wouldn't be surprised if they wouldn't consider sending you to get hormones after the first or second appointment: it can't hurt to ask at the end of the first, when the clinician has finished with their assessment. I'm talking proof of name change, documentation (payslips?) showing you're working for a company or a testimonial (the route I'm going) from a manager asserting that you're there for, say, three days a week and living fully in role, and if you have any ID, it can't hurt and/or may be required to bring along. Anything else that helps your case is always a good thing to bring too!  I hope I answered that all okay! Let me know how it all goes, yeah? I'm always open to getting PM's from people! :3"
transtimelines,2uc1vo,ibethesmarterist,2,Sun Feb 1 09:32:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much for your reply!   I'm definitely going to get proof of living full time, do you think I'm best bringing copies of emails etc for work related things with my correct name on them would be enough ""proof"" of RLE? I was considering asking my boss if he would write a letter basically confirming I am working full time in my gender, would that help at all do you think?   Thank you again for your help!"
transtimelines,2uc1vo,swaggerqueen16,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:22:01 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm banking on! If you can bring payslips or whatever it'll also come in handy, but a testimonial from your boss should be okay, I'd think. I certainly hope so, else I'm screwed! :P I think I'm bringing along, so far:  -Deed Poll for the name change  -Credit Card in my changed name  -As many bank statements in my changed name as I can find, hopefully I haven't just chucked them! -A testimonial from my boss confirming I've been living full time and stuff and working, which would also go through HR, I think.  -Obviously I have to bring along a parent as part of the network meeting, and as assholish as they are about it all, I doubt they'd lie and deny that I've been living full time in role. Even if most of those days are sitting around in pyjamas and eating far too many nachos.  -Blood test results. Might have to update them, but hey, I had them done in November/December, so it's not that long back.  Hopefully that'll be enough, although frankly, I'm terrified that they might deny me treatment because I haven't got anything they might need to assert my full-timeyness. That I'm doing full time wrong. I dunno.  I guess to be more sure, you could also bring along:  -ID (I can't afford this option, so yeah, not fun >.< Could it screw me over?)  -Payslips (evidence of monthly work)  I can't think of much more, although I'm sure I'm forgetting something. These gender clinic appointments are so stressful, I desperately don't want to do them wrong, as dumb as that sounds, because I really do need prescribed hormones with a professional rather than self-medicating (I'm running out fast, again, eeeek!), and moving out of the assessment phase to, you know, actual therapy would be lovely.   Good luck with everything! :D"

transtimelines,2uc1vo,courtiecrunch,2,Sun Feb 1 10:04:54 2015 UTC,wow your hair is just amazing. you look incredibly feminine and your style is great. may I ask what brand hair dye you use and where you get those wigs? (edit a word)
transtimelines,2uc1vo,Zottie,3,Sun Feb 1 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"Dyes: For colour, I vary between Manic Panic dye (if I can afford to ship it here to the UK from America) and Directions dye which I can pick up at a local shop down the town. For lightening my hair (which I generally always do before I dye in colours to make them brighter/last longer) I'll just use a brand of platinum blonde/super light blonde hair dye that's a touch above generic and hopefully paired with some sort of offer so I can get multiples, instead of mixing actual bleach together and stuff. :D  Wigs: I've thrown out all of my wigs since then, but the ones I had were basically just from Amazon, usually a 'cosplay-something' product. Cosplayland? Something like that. Although I wore them for about half a year, they weren't very good and lacked volume, although they averaged out at about £25 each, which helped the wallet. Just search up a colour you're keen on in the Health and Beauty category.  I'm actually getting a new wig within the next couple of weeks (itching to get it, to be honest) from an Etsy seller, ExandOh. They do wigs that are more my style in that classic scene style of lots of volume and bright colours. Mind you, it cost £60, but you get what you pay for, I suppose! I'm definitely gonna post pics when I get it, as I think it might be useful for those seeking a more alternative-oriented style to see where to get them from and stuff. :D  Thanks for commenting! <3"

transtimelines,2u9obk,aspiringtobeme,2,Sun Feb 1 04:44:00 2015 UTC,You are so right and these bullshit societal standards of feminity have never done anyone any good. They are unrealistic even as a portrayal of cis women and  are an unecessary expectation to put on the shoulders of trans women (or any woman really). Being a woman shouldn't be defined by how well you satisfy someone else's ideals.

transtimelines,2u8f2z,adulthitter,1 point,Sun Feb 1 07:48:09 2015 UTC,"It can vary pretty widely. I've heard a bunch of guys get put on a low dose and ramped up over time, but I got put on 80 mg/week right off the bat."
transtimelines,2u8f2z,adulthitter,-1,Sun Feb 1 07:53:28 2015 UTC,Do you end up with 125 mg/week like in testosterone replacement therapy for men who are not producing enough T?
transtimelines,2u8f2z,adulthitter,1 point,Sun Feb 1 08:35:33 2015 UTC,"I it all depends on how my hormone levels work out. At too high a dose, the testosterone will aromatize to estrogen, which can actually slow down changes. And everyone absorbs it differently, so there's no real ""standard dose"", there have to be adjustments made in most cases."

No, I mean, I think makeup is super cool, and always tell myself ""Yeah, I want to learn that and get it all over my face!"" but I have a tremor in my hand, and am allergic to a lot of stuff, and am one of those people who, when I can't do something well the first time, gives up.

Also, I didn't think you looked like a guy in boymode (I hope that's encouraging)! Ah, those are good reasons to stay away. Your skin is so nice and smooth anyway, you don't really need it. I was just thinking that if you accentuated your eyes a bit (maybe just mascara) that you may feel you look girlier/pass better without your glasses. Like I said before though, you pass without them. :)"
transtimelines,2u47cq,onikitsune,2,Fri Jan 30 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"for makeup, you should look into the spray-on stuff.   I was super skeptical about it until my b/f showed me that hers was anti allergen and when she 'did me up' it was so light, and worked so well!   After the initial purchase of some application tools, the makeup she said, lasts longer and stays on all day. And -- you can get water resistant versions!"

I follow the following hair rules: 1: Don't wash every day, not even every other day. Twice a week at most.  2: Use a good sulfite and silicate free shampoo and conditioner. Failing that, at least get a conditioner without those. Love that conditioner. It is your closest ally.  3: Don't brush. Use fingers, de-knot and de-tangle. This seems insane, but it makes curls and waves come out a lot better  4: Don't use heat unless you absolutely need to. If you need to blow dry, use a heat protectant. I personally don't wash my hair on days I need to be out the door before noon, because it will be soaked.  5: Be gentle with it. Don't squeeze water out, don't be too rough drying it. Get out of the shower, pat it and rub it until it's not dripping, and put it up in a towel (or a teeshirt, if you, like me, don't have a good small towel to put it in). Let the fabric do the work for a while."

transtimelines,2u218r,michealcell,3,Fri Jan 30 05:53:30 2015 UTC,"Just wondering but how do you deal with your chest hair? I'm doing laser hair removal but won't be able to do my chest and torso until the latter half of the year, as I'm doing my beard, legs, and buttocks first. I can't figure out the best way to do my chest hair: shaving, waxing, etc. and was hoping for some tips. Thanks and you look so good in your last picture; what's the lipstick you are using in it?"
transtimelines,2u218r,michealcell,1 point,Thu Jan 29 07:07:18 2015 UTC,"I'm actually very lucky in that I barely grow any chest hair; I get a patch on my sternum and some hair around my nipples, and it takes about 30 seconds of effort for me to get it all off with a razor in the shower, so I'm probably not the best one to ask about chest hair removal. I am currently using hair removal cream (trying various brands to see if there's one I like best - they all work just about the same - that is quite well) for my legs, though. Razor everywhere else (chest, armpits, and I also prefer to shave my pubic area and arms completely). Hair removal cream I think works pretty well.  As for the lipstick I'm wearing in the last picture... I'm actually not wearing any lipstick in it :|  Edit: just took a second look at it to try and figure out why someone might ask me if I was. It's shiny because I have a huge natural overbite (owing to an underdeveloped lower jaw) so my lower lip is barely visible if I have my mouth in a natural resting state. When I try to smile (which is difficult because of my jaw structure - I think I look more like I'm grimacing instead of smiling) my lower lip juts out as does my jaw a bit, so it's actually just shiny from being wet since it's normally inside my mouth a fair bit."
transtimelines,2u218r,MrSnappyComeback,2,Thu Jan 29 07:29:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'd say you are definitely lucky in both area's. It does look like you have on some shiny pink lipstick in the last picture but that is a nice natural color to your lips then. Unfortunately, my lips are a bit darker and not as full, so trying to figure that out."
transtimelines,2u218r,AllOverMyTransBody,3,Thu Jan 29 07:37:16 2015 UTC,There are alot of trans people that never get hormones because they don't need them... i was going to a lgbt youth group and met someone openly trans and when i asked her how long she has been on estrogen she got mad at me. Because i had assumed that hormones are necessary for transition and that is simply not true... but i honestly don't think i would be so far along my transition without them
transtimelines,2u218r,Sixthsomatic,4,Thu Jan 29 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's cool for people that feel they don't need hormones, but there's not way in hell I'd be able to do it. That's why I want hormones so badly."

But yeah definitely, i understand what you mean by that, I get irrationally angry a lot! and silly things, but then the next minute I can be totally calm and collected. I am thinking of starting my own Vlog series but I seriously lack confidence xD How have you been coping with emotional changes?"

transtimelines,2tgtac,DGunner,5,Sat Jan 24 05:09:07 2015 UTC,"As a 26 year old with masculine bone structure and receding hair, your timeline was very inspiring to me.  It's very easy to feel like I missed my chance at being passable and all hope is lost. Then I go down the road of ""Well should I even bother?"", then I start thinking about just killing myself because being seen as a freak would hurt so bad and I'm terrified that I'll never be able to pass.   Seeing yourself as a woman is good, it's half of the desired outcome and it's a great first step, but random strangers always seeing you as a woman, omg. I'm almost crying just thinking about it.  Thank you for renewing my hope, however temporary it may be. I love you girl and keep it up! You look hot .^"
transtimelines,2tgtac,aspmaster,3,Sun Feb 1 23:57:30 2015 UTC,aww thanks.. just know that I felt the exact same way and that it is possible. keep your spirit up and don't give up. Also I don't pass all that well yet (mostly due to voice) and to be honest it's really not anywhere close to as bad as I had thought it would be. just be genuine and be yourself :)

transtimelines,2tji1c,MrSnappyComeback,17,Sat Jan 24 19:56:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I do electrology on trans-people, so I guess I'll venture an opinion. First, the laser hair places are right, and red hair will not be affected by laser. Dont waste your money.Red hair lacks sufficient pigment to transfer the heat to the hair root since the heat is generated by interaction of the light energy and the pigment in the hair. Second, of all permenent hair removal  out there ( laser ipl, electrolysis and the myriad of other schemes out there) only electrolysis  can perform permanent hair removal for all types of hair. Basically if you have red hair, it's electrolysis or nothing.  Now what I can do, is attempt to clear up some misconceptions about electrolysis, and hopefully put your mind at ease .  Your phrasing of ""needles and electricity""  brings an image that plays very well on the fears of many people who have not experienced electrolysis.  To begin with, electrolysis does not use needles. Needles  are sharp ended, usually have a hole down the center to deliver medicines,  and are designed to puncture the skin. Electrolysis probes however are blunt. At no time do they puncture the skin, they travel alongside the hair into the hair follicle. There is no sharp prick, actually there should be no sensation whatsoever from the insertion. Actually puncturing the skin is bad work! Not to mention very difficult to do with a blunt instrument. Actually if I were to press an electrolysis probe in a random spot  on my arm, all that would happen is the skin would tent inwards. It needs the hair follicle to get beneath the surface, and that is  done with fantastic magnification and great skill.  I'd also like to address the useage of ""electricity"" . There are three modalities of electrolysis galnanic, , thermolysis , and blend. Of these modalities, the one most commonly used by electrologists is thermolysis, the reason is a perceived speed of progress.  You will find some blend operators, and a few very old galvanic operators, but by and large much is done with thermolysis.  Thermolysis, does not use DC electricity delivered to the hair follicle. It instead generates a tiny radio frequency wave from the probe that creates heat right at the hair root and destroys it. It  is heat and heat alone that destroys the hair. No electricity.  Unfortunately if you have red hair, electrolysis is the only game in town. I have at least half my clients are red-heads. My best advice before you let yourself freak out over some misconcepption about the process, is to actually go have a trial session. Many electrologists do this for free,and will try a few hairs from various spots to give you a feel for the process. You are likely to find its not as painful as you may have thought, and not at all like you thought it would be. Ideally the treatment should involve minimal skin reaction, and be comfortable.  I also happen to have started a forum over at http://electrolysisinfo.forumotion.ca/ a few weeks ago, and often copy  questions I've answered so when they come up I can point to the answer already given. A few of the professional electrologists I learned from also frequent there. Would you mind if I copied your question, and my answer , to there? And I'm sorry its'snot probably the answer you wanted, but I think you already knew that , however hopefully I've pput some of your concerns at ease.  Seana"
transtimelines,2tji1c,SeanaTG,3,Sun Jan 25 18:05:19 2015 UTC,Thank you for the information. I had no idea that's how it worked. Just curious how many hours of electrolysis does it take to do the full face and neck on average?My body hair doesn't concern me just my facial hair.
transtimelines,2tji1c,SeanaTG,3,Sun Jan 25 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"Again a very common question, with not so clear answers. The final answer can range anywhere from 100-300 hours.There are a ton of variables that can effect this, frequency of treatment hair density and area, skill of the electrologist, modulation used . As we age hair becomes more widespread and also dense. Some of my colleagues would disagree that it canbe as high as 300, but it really does depend onthe individual circumstances.There's no easy average."
transtimelines,2tji1c,SeanaTG,0,Sun Jan 25 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"So your telling  me in gong to have to spend between $6000-$18,000 for just my face.... i might aswell just give up... above everything else this has made me lose hope"
transtimelines,2tji1c,SeanaTG,4,Sun Jan 25 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"18000 would not be out of  the question no.You could consider doing DIY though if you can get some good advice on techniques and physiology. That's how I originally started doing electrolysis . I would estimate I probably spent under $1000 total on equipment.I know I'm not the first to do so, and probably wont be the last. I live on next to nothing, and have 3 kids, there is no way I could have afforded $18000 in treatments. But I could afford my time and thought it couldnt be that difficult, and in fact it wasnt.  I've also seen people start crowd-funding to fund electrolysis, with some success on places like gofundme. Some electrologists will use a sliding scale for transgender clients because of the bulk of work, but it is demanding work so they cant discount too much. Would it be okay if I shared your question?"
transtimelines,2tji1c,SeanaTG,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:31:48 2015 UTC,You can share my question... Well thanks... :(
transtimelines,2tji1c,midsouthwendy,3,Sun Jan 25 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"aww I'm really sorry if it's somewhat discouraging, but I can tell you having gone through it, it is doabl, even on a budget. Also keep in mind that you dont usually pay that up front, and probably shouldnt. It's a pay as you go along thing and that does make it that much easier."

transtimelines,2tji1c,hatfulofmadness,0,Sun Jan 25 02:05:36 2015 UTC,I paid over $900 for face and neck only. Electro can be $60/hour and you can pace yourself. I have heard it can take 300 hours for full body.  You would be surprised how much HRT can slow down hair or stop it on on the body.
transtimelines,2tji1c,quinn_marigold,1 point,Sat Jan 24 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"What I'm doing it a mix of the two. I have coppery red hair that is actually a blend of brown and blonde hairs. Laser will help me with the darker hairs, and then I'll just take out the leftovers with electro."
