One of the main arguments I hear for having kids is so that there's someone to take care of you when you're old, or someone to pass your genes onto. Breeding caretakers and being so pompous to think that your genes are so important to pass on is noble, yet... not having children is the selfish decision."

childfree,3e30fl,Fluffiebunnie,7,Tue Jul 21 17:40:27 2015 UTC,"OP's argument is the main one as far as i'm concerned. Whether you are happy or not to exist, you'll have to die, which in most cases involves suffering. Having biological kids is sentencing them to death."

I can leave for a weekend and as long as I put out the food and water, she's fine. (I draw the limit at 3 nights away.) I sometimes leave for work at 8am and then am out until midnight and she's fine.  There are cats out there with a personalities that are compatible with a laid-back lifestyle. Cats can be trained. I trained my cat not to push my head off the pillow. I trained her now to wake me up in the morning. I trained her not to bring her toys onto the bed.   Don't let the cat rule your life. You are the boss.   Also, sometimes pet adoptions don't work out and it's okay. If you'd had this cat for five years and were sick of it, then that's one thing, but after 5 days, it's okay to go back and say 'I'm sorry, I was wrong, I want to return this cat while it's still adoptable.' I tried having a second cat for four months, and cat 2 was far needier than cat 1. Cat 2 needed someone that was home full time to keep him company. Cat 2 stole all of cat 1's food, so cat 1 just hid away all the time and withered to skin and bone. It was for my sanity and for the safety and health of cat 1 that cat 2 had to go back. I cried when I took him back, but he was still young and adoptable. And the minute I came home, I felt so much calmer. Seriously, sometimes it doesn't work out, and as much as it sucks, if you find you're incompatible with the animal once you bring it home, it's better to do something early on than to tough it out and make yourself and the animal miserable."

childfree,3e2m9p,bara88,18,Tue Jul 21 18:46:11 2015 UTC,"thats not actually true. See, in my country, young women are all bullshited by glamorizing pregnancy and the ""miracle of birth"".   Then the reality comes. The doctors are rude, the nurses are tired and they make depreciating coments about the mothers, like ""she thinks now its bad, wait until she is here for eight hours"", etc.   The doctors are nagging the mothers for screaming toom much or not being in the exact position the doctor wants. taht piosition is usually lying on back which mainly makes the pain unbearable and for no reason - just because the doctor said so and he like to be obeyd.   The episotomy in my country is on 90%, the application of oxytocin, which is usually given too soon (the doctors doesnt want to the womens body to open naturally, because its too slow) makes the pain drastically worse. Because of the oxytocin the baby is pushed in to non opened vagina, which ledas to much worse tearing. Your inner organs are teared by the pushing as they had no chance to open properly. Because of that they must cut your vagina, or you tear up to the ass.   meanwhile all this the mother cannot scream to not disturb the others, as they are giving birth by numerous people in one room. They also must to fill the documents.   The doctors are very rood and they come and put hands inside very roughly and unnecesarry often, which hurt as hell.   Also the seweing is done with no anestesia.   The doctors often deny epidural.   Now this is not always true. There are two hospitals in the entire country where you can be on the room alone and have more natural birth. In the rest sometimes they have officially some alternatives, but if you ask for them, you are automatically suspicious from being ""the hysterical problem mother"".   This also is not always truth, but the tragedy is, that one shift in the same day in the same hospital can be caring and considerative (although still you must have oxytocin and episotomy in most of the cases), and the second shift is terribly cruel.   In fact these are the reasons that lead me personally to reconsider having children. I have trauma from childhood abuse and I am very sensitive about my body.  Being treated like that would probably cause me life time consecuences and I would hate my child for causing this to me - exactly like my mother did all my life.   Also, if the woman doesnt agree with somethingm, they do it anyway. They tie you up if they must to. There was a story about a women giving birth who didnt want episotomy, and they fighted her and her husband, and they cut up her vagina anyway, holding her down. the public was with the doctors, saying she is crazy and hysterical and wanted to kill the baby (which wasnt threatened on life by the way).   The very thought of me liyng somewhere in horrible pain and seeing a doctor approaching to my vagina with scisors meanwhile other people is holding me is causing me trauma..."

Human reproduction is notoriously tricky (see The Obstetrical Dilemma), can result in severe pain and permanent disabilities, and up until very recently was often fatal. Trying to compare it to other scenarios in an attempt to undermine how difficult it can be for some women is like trying to say no one should be depressed when there are people worse off in the world.

If that causes you high stress you can ask for anxiety management, it's very common. Personally I like how dope and goofy it makes me and then I'm out of it quickly enough. It's really no different from sleeping, except that you're probably kind of loopy afterwards."
childfree,3e35r7,CandylandRepublic,4,Tue Jul 21 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"You can ask about an anti-nausea patch for the anesthesia too if you're worried about that.  I'm seeking a tubal now and have done a ton of research in the meantime.  The best thing to see is how low the risks are and how non-serious the are.  Honestly, the worst complications I saw were because of anesthesia, not the actual surgery.  There's the usual bleeding/infection risks, but those are low and easily treated.  Good luck and enjoy removing some stress from your life permanently!"

See, I've always felt somewhat unsettled when seeing people younger than me with a kid or two, but never really understood why--the feeling was very hard to describe. It's only recently that I realized that this weird feeling is actually a huge pity party my brain throws for my imaginary self.    That's... a little complicated. Basically whenever I see, say, a 23yo woman with a wailing toddler and another bun still in the oven, I feel incredibly sorry for her because I remember what it was like to be 23. I remember what it's like to stay up all night chatting with a friend in a faraway country, have fresh sushi delivered to a garden party or just spontaneously go to the seaside because you don't have anything better to do this particular weekend, and the thought that she is not able to do any of these things because of her kid is just so sad! It doesn't even register that changing poopy diapers or watching Frozen seventeen times in a row might actually be what this person wants, or that having a kid is the bestest thing to ever happen to her, because I simply can't help but project my own standards and expectations.    Then, whenever I see a young woman like this, my brain always points out, ""Hey, it could've been you, you know!"" and I consider all my dreams and achievements and realize that none of them would be possible if I were in the breeder's shoes and then I start to feel sorry for my imaginary self that has a shitty kid and shitty life.

I come from a Mormon family, so my sister and I weren't unplanned, but young-ass pregnancies are the norm in that culture. My mom had my sister when she was 21 and me when she was 23. When I was those ages, I thought about how bizarre it was that she was a parent of two babies at that point in her life. WTF.  Now I'm 35, and I often think, ""Wow...when Mom was my age, she had a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old. Fuck that noise.""  Despite my mom's young pregnancies, she did have sense enough to stop at two, which most Mormons never do. She was a clandestine supporter of the Zero Population Growth movement, which was a HUGE no-no for a Mormon (those of you who are Mormons and grew up in the 80s and 90s remember Saturday's Warrior...ugh...) so she secretly got on the pill after I was born, but had to drive to another town about 40 miles away to get her prescription refilled each month.  My dad knew (he was a total black sheep in that community) but nobody else did. In a gesture of support, he bought her a 280 Z, the fanciest car in town, in which to make the drive every month to get her fancy-lady birth control. She said she always felt like SUCH a badass, driving through town in her sports car to pick up her contraband birth control pills! (It was unusual at that time for women in that town to even drive anywhere, unless it was to the grocery store, let alone for a woman to have her own car, and if she did, it was especially not a sports car. And she most definitely was not driving it to Idaho Falls to get the Pill.)"

When I was seven and we went to the seafood restaurant next to the bowling alley, I usually ordered a halibut steak.  It was mouth-watering, and I wasn't even all that into fish.

It's probably more that she was ""lazy"" in her parenting (now, I sound like a goddamn sanctimommy). She probably didn't feel like cooking at the end of the day or having to fight the kid(s) over eating whatever she did cook, so she took the easy way out and gave them chicken tenders/mac/fries.  My sister is like this. She has three kids and she busts her ass at her job (she's an RN) but by the end of the day, she's drained. She grabs some fast food on the drive home, picks her kids up from day care and turns on the tv.   Either way, it's a product of being stretched way too fucking thin.

My cousin's half-brother was a complete and utter disaster to take to any restaurant. He'd literally throw a screaming, throwing-things, banging-head-on-the-ground, actually-had-the-cops-called-on-him kind of tantrums if the foods he wanted weren't available at a certain restaurant. At one point, my uncle's wife (long story, she's a bitch, I refuse to call her or her son family because I'm not related to either of them by blood) would actually order chicken fingers from a different restaurant to go, bring it to another restaurant, and pray that her kid wouldn't throw a tantrum.  I might have felt bad for her - but the way she raised her son really led to this kind of behavior. I mean, for the first four years of his life she let him communicate via screams and screeches rather than learning actual words. She was all about placating rather than parenting, and now the little monster is a teenager who can't even get a driver's license. He failed the text six times (he posted so on Facebook...) but now he and his mother claim it's ""discrimination"" because he's ""on the autism spectrum."" Mind you, he ain't diagnosed with anything..."

My husband's aunt uses this all the time to justify her teenage son's poor behavior, and he hasn't been diagnosed either.  Poor behavior ≠ Autism.    Poor behavior is more often a reflection of parenting failures.   And if you really think your kid is somewhere on the spectrum, then not seeking out a diagnosis and the corresponding services that will help your child be as successful in navigating life as possible makes you a terrible parent."

She'll excuse away her son's behavior as him being autistic - but no one else is allowed to call him autistic, and she won't get him a diagnosis because she doesn't want him to be ""labeled."" But she still wants all the accommodations of being labeled.  And it's also weird because she was a really shitty parent to my cousins. Girls, one my age the other two years younger. She forced them to share one meal at restaurants - whether it was McDonald's, Applebee's, or a nicer restaurant - until they were in high school. And then she'd scream at them if they complained about still being hungry. And it wasn't an issue of them not having much money either - oh no, that bitch was very quick to tell everyone she had a shitton of money, and she'd go around buying the boy whatever he wanted to eat.

I went through phases of eating only prawn cocktail, or sausage rolls, or whatever.

Often, mum would make chicken breast, peas, raw carrot and home made chips.   at one stage, i wouldn't eat bread, just pitta. So she sent me to school with sandwiches made from pittas.   if my parents tried to make me eat something i didn't want as a toddler, i threw violent tantrums. I would slam myself against a wall or door. That was hw i got away with it. That changed one day, though XD. I threw a tantrum and ended up skidding across gravel because the door wasn't closed properly. Still have the scar. My parents had no sympathy for me, they jus roared laughing at me.

My childhood is surprisingly similar to the person you replied to-- would eat anything until around age 2 when I got some doctor-baffling illness that made already-small me lose a worrying amount of weight.  After that there was a short list of things I would eat until high school when I began broadening my repertoire on my own.    As a kid my parents tried so, so many different approaches and strategies to get me to eat more/different foods, reading books and consulting medical professionals and the whole shebang, but none of them had any effect at all.  ""You have to sit at the table until you try some"" = I sat there literally all day.  ""Just let 'em get hungry enough"" = I didn't eat for several days and they felt horribly guilty (I did have a secret stash of Halloween candy that I made full use of).  Funny since I was most always quiet and well-behaved, but over a few issues (playing junior tennis was another one) would dig in and not let up for any reward/punishment.    A decade later we discovered that I have legit allergies to several really common foods, so turns out it's just as well I had an inexhaustible supply of food stubbornness.

And as for shellfish? Well, turns out I'm allergic.  Had a family friend who's kid would not TOUCH peanut butter. Like PBJ sandwiches, reese's cups, etc. We always thought he was just being fussy.

Like the above poster, I have IBS, and I spent a lot of time as a kid feeling sick.  Because I couldn't identify what it was making me feel that way, I went through periods of eating very little of a food category, only enough to keep my parents off my back.  Luckily, I ate fruits and veggies as independent snacks often enough to know they were fine, so I always ate all of them up.  It was everything else on the plate that I would go off and on of.  I didn't figure out everything until I was an adult and able to basically do an elimination diet and slowly add things back in, with the help and supervision of a nutritionist.  Turns out that the milk I was being forced to drink ""for strong bones"" when I wanted water?  No good.  The noodles often presented as a side dish?  Nope, shouldn't have had those.

Their taste-buds are a bit more sensitive, and they don't like things that stand out as bitter or tart or anything like that. There was science to it.  However, it becomes self-perpetuating. If the parents don't challenge the kids' taste buds, then they won't branch out. If the parent gives the kids whatever the kid wants on demand, then the kid is in charge, and as we all know, kids don't know what's best for themselves.   Parents depend on it because they can usually get their kids to eat it without a fight and these days they seem more interested in raising a kid without conflict than challenging the kid to be a functioning adult."

This, in spite of the fact that my mom was, and still is, one of the most amazingly fantastic cooks I've ever encountered.

Most probably couldn't name the three macronutrients much less how much of each a person should consume.    Suddenly being a parent doesn't grant that knowledge, and there's no real way for an adult -- outside of seeking the knowledge out specifically -- to learn it.  the USDA ""plate"" is a good start, but who the hell pays attention to that, or the RDA on the nutrition labels (which most people don't even know how to properly read anyway).    So parents fall back on what works:  They emulate the school lunch program they grew up with.  Pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken tenders, french fries, fish sticks, and tater tots.

Takes 30 minutes or less to make.  Hot dogs and burgers can be bought or made out of 100% meat, served with a whole wheat bun or lettuce wrap, and served with salad or veggies.  Chicken fingers and fish sticks can be made at home with whole wheat breading or even coconut breading and baked in the oven, as can fries.  And obviously all served with salad/veggies  I don't know about tater tots as I've never had them, but 1 out of 7 isn't bad.  Obviously, none of these should be the entirety of any person's diet, and they do take a little extra effort.  But for families that aren't desperately poor or working insanely long hours, they're not much of a stretch.  And even if they can't be 100% implemented, parts can.  Buy a pizza with veggies and chicken instead of pepperoni and extra cheese, for example."

Growing up in the 80s and 90s we had so many ads for foods that were little more than corn syrup and food color.  Then you have the toys in the kids meals (beanie babies and Disney cross promotion in my day) and the crossovers where Pizza Hut and Dairy Queen had book clubs.

My fiance doesn't dislike kids as much as I do though we are both CF. My mom suggested the other day to make a game area for children that will be there, she is totally cool with me being CF but apparently they did that at my cousin's wedding she recently went to. I told her hell no. Parents who bring their kids will keep them entertained or be asked to leave. I'm not giving a warning on this, just hoping the 3 people with kids will have some common sense. If they don't, a bridesmaid or my dad will tell them to beat it. My fiance thinks they will ""all be on iPads or DSes"" which I hope is true. If there were a situation where we had family members with younger kids I would definitely cut off the age around 8.  If I was having a CF wedding, I've seen on r/weddingplanning where people put it at bottom of their invitation or on their wedding website in an eloquent way ('It is our wish that this be an adults only event' and the like). Perhaps go search the threads over there, or ask. They are surprisingly receptive to CF weddings.  edited to piggy back on what u/Redheadsneedlove said: I see the X number of seats thing a lot on wedding planning. It's a polite way to go about it and I wish I had done it on my invites. I'm hoping the addressing the envelope to certain people sticks (some out of town friends have a toddler who I am not inviting)."

childfree,3dz5vd,torienne,6,Mon Jul 20 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"Because this woman is manipulative and shameless, characteristics that don't bode well for long-term recovery.  People like her excel at putting others between a rock and a hard place. You have to either come off as harsh, rude and uncaring, or you have to accept a gross violation of boundaries.We're thoroughly trained not to be the former, so we, so frequently, accept the latter.   Your wife needs to become aware of her mother's character flaws, and what they mean about the potential for any relationship at all. Your MIL is selfish down to her core. That's why she chose drugs over her children. Someone like that strikes me as likely to use you and your wife hard if she gets any chance at all."
childfree,3dz5vd,T-Wrox,35,Tue Jul 21 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your wife needs to understand that blood doesn't make family - she doesn't have to have anything to do with her mother, if her mother is nothing but a negative drain on her life.  And as someone who was too fucked up to raise her own kids, she really has A LOT of nerve telling anyone to have kids for her!"

""Oh look, with me here you don't need to get a babysitter! You can let recovering junkie Grandma take care of things and I won't have to get a job! Win/win!""

Most people sorta joke about asking bingoers why they're so concerned with your sex life, but being as your MIL was LITERALLY telling you to ""get in the bedroom and make babies,"" OP, I think you'd be perfectly justified in telling her you'd rather not discuss when and where and how you'll be fucking her daughter (or okay, maybe it's best if her daughter says it), but she should get used to the fact that no babies will be coming from it.

childfree,3dz5vd,tparkelaine,5,Tue Jul 21 05:33:08 2015 UTC,Babies aren't ice-breakers and they're not prozac. They are tiny human beings and they're not responsible for other peoples' feelings or relationships.  She can find another way to reconnect. It sounds to me like she just wants to have a do-over baby so she can play Grandma of the Year.

childfree,3e0lhx,CatsAreNicerThanKids,25,Tue Jul 21 01:07:51 2015 UTC,Now imagine the kids in the same classroom. How much learning do you think is done when the teacher has to discipline the unmanageable?
childfree,3e0lhx,Spikekuji,29,Tue Jul 21 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Those kids are nightmares. And I'm tired of the accusations that I'm ""picking on their kid"" only because I don't have kids.   Um. No. All the teachers have a problem with your kid. What's the common denominator? Why should the other kids miss out on an education because you don't want to bother parenting?  No, not bitter at all. :-/"
childfree,3e0lhx,spreads_like_butter,19,Tue Jul 21 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"In high school, there was this guy in my Spanish class who constantly disrupted class. The teacher always had to stop to yell at him and try to get him to shut up, but he didn't care. He got sent to the principal's office quite a bit, but he would always get sent back to class immediately because, oh, we can't deprive that piece of shit of an education even though his behavior is preventing everyone else in the class from learning! The teacher hated him. The other students, even the hardcore slackers, hated him because his disruptions always meant we never finished classwork and thus had homework. He was a jerk, and I was his most convenient target because the teacher refused to remove either of us. (though she did feel bad for me) She really wanted to do something about him but teachers today don't really have any power.  One time he made a comment while I was trying to give an oral presentation and I went off on him, everyone thought it was pretty funny and the teacher was looking at her newspaper, pretending not to notice. In hindsight, I probably could've gotten away with physically harming him if I wanted to. The teacher really hated him."
childfree,3e0lhx,PartyPorpoise,4,Tue Jul 21 03:13:45 2015 UTC,"I had a class mate like that in my government class in High School. He was disruptive on purpose because he thought the teacher put too much of their opinion into their teaching. I also had PE with this classmate and one day he was arguing with another classmate how guys tend to do, basically just trying to bruise each others egos so I marched over and told them they were being ridiculous and that they both probably had small dicks and should shut up. They weren't happy but I didn't care. haha."
childfree,3e0lhx,spamalicioussammi,15,Tue Jul 21 06:45:48 2015 UTC,"They expect the teachers to do the parenting they won't bother to do. Some even send their children to elementary school while not potty trained at 7. And the teacher mustn't bother the parents with her worries about their child, because then, she's not doing her job properly. It must be a total nightmare."
childfree,3e0lhx,SailorMercure,11,Tue Jul 21 02:38:05 2015 UTC,Teachers are expected to get kids to behave without disciplining them. It's pretty stupid.

childfree,3e0lhx,inflammatoryjustice,2,Tue Jul 21 08:56:47 2015 UTC,"2 semesters of student teaching, before I realized how much I didn't want to be a teacher afterall. This was a 3rd grade class, so kids 9-10 yrs old. Teacher had to basically potty train one kid by shaming him (nothing else worked) because his parents thought their precious snowflake would learn on his own. This poor kid was on a less than kindergarten level in many things, but here he was sitting in a third grade class. (Fuck the ""No Child Left Behind"" act, by the way). Had another kid who acted out often. This boy was being raised by his grandmother who treated him like shit (he could never do anything good) and treated his sister like an angel (she could never do anything bad.) I can't imagine why he had issues...  And thus the teacher's have to be parent as well as educator and councilor. It is a nightmare. And they don't get paid nearly enough for it."
childfree,3e0lhx,Naomi_DerRabe,2,Tue Jul 21 13:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's another thing, teachers are expected to fill so many roles, yet they still get treated like shit."

childfree,3e0lhx,TheDemonicEmperor,3,Tue Jul 21 04:17:25 2015 UTC,I don't take offense to it.   The parents are just grasping at straws to put the blame on anyone/thing except their child's shitty behavior and/or the parents ineffective parenting.
