This might give you a hint why the mods of /r/mildlyinteresting decided to remove the link in question.  It could also be completely unrelated or unhelpful in which case I apologize. I'm still learning.
longtail,3e6vy4,FrontpageWatch,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:29:37 2015 UTC,"Trump makes the claim that being captured does not make you a hero, and is widely ridiculed.  The Bush campaign passed out paper stick-on purple hearts mocking Kerry's medals at his convention, and it is treated as a serious issue by the press.  Why the difference.  Is it just because trump is well-known to be a buffoon so it is safer to mock him?  edit:  Just to clarify: Trump is an asshole who deserves contempt for his comments.  He was dodged the draft while McCain was being tortured but refusing early released because his father was an admiral.  My concern is on the other side.  Why did Bush escaped the same kind of contempt.  He also dodged the draft, using political influence to get a coveted spot in the National Guard while Kerry was fighting and getting wounded several times in Vietnam.  Yet his campaign claimed Kerry was a phony who did not deserve his medals while they had people ""thanking Bush for his service."""

Give me your worst roommate stories to make me feel better about my crap roommate until her lease is up!  Edit: Okay so my roommate is not THAT bad. We are just opposite. But I will say...it is not unreasonable to want a clean house!  Edit 2: These stories gave me perspective. My roommate isn't bad. I just like my house a certain way. That's that! Sorry, roommate!"

We've got a jungler, I main bot lane (both ADC and support) and our third plays both top and mid.   So, we need one more bot laner and either a top or mid.   We would really like to keep membership of the team to US military personnel stationed in Europe and the UK to mitigate ping issues and language barrier, and to promote teamwork (since that gets drilled into us pretty much from day 1).  I'm Silver 3 and climbing, our jungler hit his promo series to Silver 2 last night. Not sure what our third is ranked as I haven't talked to him personally yet.  We welcome all skill levels. If you're bronze and willing to learn or Diamond+ and feel like carrying  (and teaching as well) reply to this post or send me a PM.   We are also not limiting by position. We have 7 open slots on the roster and could use some backups/extras.  Thanks for your time, if you could drop an upvote for visibility that would be much appreciated."

longtail,3e606s,FrontpageWatch,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:41:38 2015 UTC,"Following an argument with my parents, I called a suicide hotline. They sent a police officer to my house even though I asked them not to. The policeman said that if he felt I should go to a hospital for treatment and I didn't want to, he would take me by force. I didn't want to be taken by force so I got into his car and went to the hospital where I sat for an hour in an empty lobby waiting to be seen by a psychiatrist. When I finally got into to see this person, he said that I ""have to make some hard choices"" when I told him my parents said they would cut me off if I didn't want to become a doctor.  Fast forward to today. I receive a bill for $540 from the hospital for ""Crisis Intervention"" and ""Crisis Intervention Extend.""  I think its absurd that I would get this bill when I neither called the police nor wanted to go to the hospital. I can't afford this and so I was wondering if anyone had advice.  Also, if someone feels this would be better in a different subreddit please let me know.  Thank you  Edit: I'm 19 and I am just at my parents' for the summer"
longtail,3e5yk2,FrontpageWatch,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:23:52 2015 UTC,"Stats:  Female 5’9 137 lbs Estimated body fat 17%  Bench: 90 Press: 60 Squat: 140 Deadlift: 155  I started weight lifting about a year ago. I was about ten pounds lighter and couldn’t lift the bar in any capacity. I had just lost about 20lbs the year previous through keto before I came into a bench and barbell set up. Skinny fat up the ass.  I finished Starting Strength late last year, after following it for about 6 months. None of my numbers are as high as I would like, but I still want to drop some more fat with possibly going on a cut.  My arms/inner thighs have more fat than I would like, but I don’t know if I am just being hypercritical or I should just stick with eating at maintenance and lifting 5-6 days a week, as I have been doing. I do a rotating push/pull split with chest/tri/shoulder, back and biceps, and legs. I want to build muscle with as little fat as possible (I know, I don’t we all) but I am just wondering which direction to go. Cut? Bulk? Maintenance? If this is where you were at, what would you do?   Possibly NSFW, sports bra and underwear: http://imgur.com/0Sokril"
