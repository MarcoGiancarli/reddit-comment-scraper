logodesign,3e2pbe,pvalerio,44,Tue Jul 21 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid concept, though I would recommend increasing the weight of the P and maybe looking for a camera style that has a slightly more distinct outline to make it more obviously a camera at first glance and at smaller sizes."
logodesign,3e2pbe,nicetriangle,8,Tue Jul 21 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I like the concept, and I'd suggest using a simplified camera silhouette with smoother, straighter edges to match the style of the P (e.g. - something like http://uxrepo.com/static/icon-sets/ionicons/svg/camera.svg). These look a bit mismatched as is."
logodesign,3e2pbe,cjolives,3,Tue Jul 21 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with this. The weight of the P makes the circle part look like the lens. I think adding to that too much would ruin that.  For the camera shape, I'm fairly certain that any photographer would recognize that shape instantly, and with the rise of cheap DSLRs I think most non-photographers would as well."
logodesign,3e2pbe,starshadowx2,4,Tue Jul 21 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"It's not that the shape isn't recognizable as a camera, it's that there are unnecessary additional elements on it that get muddy when shrunk down.  The image /u/cjolives linked is going to be much better at smaller sizes."

It does have that retro feel, so I'm guessing that is sort of what you are going for. Look for more examples of similar styles and get more inspiration from them.   As for the design itself, I would start by playing and experimenting more with different  palettes.   I would definitely eliminate that black ""star"" on the right.   And finally I would get rid of the black outlines on the ""that show"" text. When you try other colors, you wont need those outlines.  Hope I helped."

Now sure, you want some details but there is a point where it's excessive. Think about it this way: If I shrink my logo to be tiny, will you still recognize it? If I make my logo one solid color, will it still be recognizable. Maybe what you can do is make a keyboard with only specific keys with the letters cut out to show your company name. It would probably still have a lot of details, but it shouldn't be too many. I'll make a mockup to show you what I mean if you'd like.  TL;DR: Keep your details at a minimal. It should be recognizable if shrunk and one solid color."

logodesign,3dyu87,AndyRedditor,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:08 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing -- using the top icon with the text acronym.  Just place it inside one of those curved squares with a neutral black background to become a iOS app icon.  No background needed for Android.

logodesign,3dyu87,fivemanship,0,Mon Jul 20 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"I had this logo done on 99designs several years ago. I don't particularly like it (the font seems... off, for example) but we have a lot of materials in use (tshirts, playmats etc.) that all use the logo.  Anyway, we are building an iphone app, and I'm wondering if we should expend this logo somehow to make it work as the app icon, or go for a complete redesign.  I am NOT looking for free design work, Instead, I'd like to understand the process needed to take a long rectangular logo and turn it into a square, easy-to-identify icon."
logodesign,3dyu87,nicetriangle,3,Mon Jul 20 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"I would go with a logo redesign.  You could keep a lot of the same elements as you have here, but change the color scheme and perhaps the font.  When I see this, it seems outdated (gradients were more popular in the early 00s, but not so much today), unprofessional, and kind of sketchy -- not a site I would want to use.  I think the easiest, most immediate fix you should make is changing the colors from gradients (where they all fade into white), to bolder, flat, solid colors that will ""pop"" more -- this will make it look a lot cleaner and more professional.  I would also consider removing the black outline that appears around everything to further refine the cleanliness. Change the white subtext to black to accommodate this, and anywhere an image touches text, leave a little white space.  By doing this you can make your logo work on both white and black backgrounds (not that it couldn't already, but it will look much better IMO).  Last suggestion: The text is all italicized.  I'm not sure why.  After making the other changes you might wanna try playing around with non-italicized to see if it looks better."
logodesign,3dyu87,nicetriangle,0,Mon Jul 20 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"This is excellent advice, thank you. The color scheme, for better or worse, needs to stay since the site and emails etc all have the same scheme, (http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/46688/fresh_cut_day is the palette) but everything else is on the table.  I'll likely completely remove the tagline as well.  I like /u/andyredditor 's suggestion above for mobile.   Thanks again for the help!"

In general I would heavily suggest, that you find a few use cases and try the logo on them. make mokups of those: T-Shirts, Business cards, letterheads.  Aother good thing to try: Take a poster were there are a few sponsor logos placed at the bottom. take that and put your logo there as well.

Find a font with a similar profile to the stroke used on the heart (I'm assuming that's what you tried to achieve here) that is simple enough to complement the rest of the design.

Nothing wrong with drop shadows, it just doesn't add anything for me here. I have to look harder to see them in the first, I actually see fire before anything else.

I get the look you're going for, and it's cool. I dig it. But there's a lot going on with the sliced letters and overlapping. What if you tried to simplify the shapes and focus in on one defining feature? I thought the way the W was formed was neat, maybe have that be the crazy shape, but the rest of the letters are clean and continguous. It's bordering on difficult-to-read right now.

Geesus the brands would be held in the same store!  Chances are the company above is looking to the designer for this 2 min market research. To brand something remotely close to another brand is a really, really bad financial decision and more so if they are in the same stores. I doubt any market research was done in this instance.

There are numerous issues.  1 and #2     The green is neon green. That looks bad on almost everything but black There's almost no contrast between the letters and the burning green. What's with the weird black frame?   3 and #4     Boom! Headshot! Why is the tennis player being hit in the face with a tennis ball The logo is mostly decoration and not enough actual logo-ness. This seems more like a few words on a page and an illustration next to it.   Now, I don't doubt you have it in you to make a great logo one day, but this is not it. You're not there yet. You've got quite some ways to go, but your coach would probably like your go-getter attitude.  Things to do:   If this is any kind of project that needs to be done on a deadline, hire someone Study logos, look at all of them. See what makes them great, what you like about them, what you don't. Study fonts. Which font carries which connotation? Study colours. Every colour has a different meaning of sorts. Doodle. Just doodle away. Combine colours, fonts and shapes. See what effect they have. Put them in front of dark and light backgrounds, see if they still have the same effect.   To illustrate this, I imitated Apple's design crappily with the tennis ball free stock thing I found. See how the effect of the logo, text and colour is completely different? And even when you compare it with Apple's own design, the differences are striking.  http://i.imgur.com/0mur3MK.png  http://i.imgur.com/I4Wve2x.png"

logodesign,3dhavt,sevencoves,2,Thu Jul 16 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"These are not sketches. Get a pencil, a sketchbook, and draw out every little idea that pops up into your head. Sketch 100 ideas at least. Mind map. Sketch more...  Choose color last. Work in black and white. Use simple shapes. Test it on small icons that are 16px x 16px all the way up to full screen. Is it recognizeable at all sizes? Is the mark memorable at all?   Or.. just hire a designer. Logo design is probably one of the most difficult things to do in design. Let the professionals do it."

As for tablets, a lot of people say the monoprice offerings are a great cheap alternative to Wacom, but I can't say from personal experience. I have a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium and I'm pretty happy with it but I don't consider a tablet a design necessity unless you do a lot of illustrative work. I almost never use it for straight up design.  Anyway. here's some information on one of the better Monoprice tablets on the market: http://frenden.com/post/31659364200/the-little-monoprice-graphics-tablet-that-could  That site has a bunch of other tablet reviews you might find useful as well."

And yes, full links are the way to go because reddit is programmed to detect shortlinks like that goo.gl link you posted and flag them as spam. That's because people were using shortlinks to avoid getting caught for posting blacklisted websites and the admins got wise to it really quick and so now they're blocked site-wide.  It's also just nice for people to know what website they're clicking when they see a link. Shortlinks could lead to anything."

This ensures that your final product will be legible, and if you client is strapped for cash, they'll be grateful that they have a logo that looks good on their one-color print budget.  On a slightly different note, this looks like it doesn't know whether it wants to be skeuomorphic or flat. It's kind of floating in a limbo between the two. If you're going for the former, use your gradients to inform light sources and material qualities. For the latter, use your gradients more like shadows to give the effect of layered construction paper.  My personal opinion. Hope it helps."

logodesign,3dae4q,youcantstoptheart,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:48:14 2015 UTC,"The reason you want one color is because of the way people read shapes. I don't remember where I read it but at a glace people don't see all the intricacies of shapes, they just see the basic blocks of color. If the original logo doesn't have much contrast, which I already mentioned it does not compared to yours, then it won't read very well to a viewer. There is a reason that the best companies companies have logos that worked as 1 single color.   The logo does look OK online but why limit yourself? If you plan ahead and allow a logo to expand it's uses then you don't have to worry about the logo later."

May just be me but gradients don't work well in most logos. Make sure the logo works as a flat design with one color before adding color. The text seems out of proportion with the visual element of the logo. You will want to fix for the logo to work well on business materials   Like where it's headed though, depending on what your company actually does:p"
logodesign,3dae4q,IDGAFOS,22,Tue Jul 14 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I almost think IDGAFOS is a bot programmed to list every cliched talking point about logo design.   Since when is a logo's job to tell people what the business is? Look at all the most recognizable logos in the world: does Nike use an image of sportswear, does FedEx show a delivery truck, does McDonald's use a burger, etc.? The purpose of a logo is to work in conjunction with the brand to communicate the company's message to its market. It is NOT supposed to singlehandedly tell people what the company does. It is absolutely okay for a game host to use a potion jar as an icon, and it's amateurish to suggest otherwise. Yes, it's just you. Gradients are perfectly acceptable for logos. Sure flat logos are the trendy thing right now, but that doesn't mean you can kill off a tool in one fell swoop like that. A gradient is just a tool in the toolbox, that's it. It's nothing special or magical or evil. Gradients can be perfectly acceptable when used intelligently with taste. And I happen to think Ark Addicts hit that with this one. And as with most ""complex"" logos, companies tend to have simplified versions for the types of business communications that would be better served with one. Chances are good that most of Ark Addicts' marketing will be online, so why limit them to what will best look good on an embroidered golf shirt? The text / icon proportion is a subjective opinion. I won't discount your thoughts on it. I personally  like it the way it is, but I can totally see it looking good in other proportions, as well.   All in all, I dig the logo the way it is. Great work, arkaddicts!"
logodesign,3dae4q,GusGorman,0,Tue Jul 14 22:03:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the there is a couple of reasons /u/IDGAFOS said it. Reason one: he's fucking right. Reason two: if you think that the swoosh or the gates logos were designed in the past 5 years, you're probably wrong. Also it's very wrong to compare low level market logos to something like Nike or FedEx (which has an arrow in the logo as a reference to their business). Reason three: /u/IDGAFOS is still fucking right. Gradients don't work neither in this logo but more importantly in 9/10 other logos too. And the tracking on this logo is out of proportion very badly."

The FedEx logo is great for a lot of reasons, but its ability to tell people what the company does isn't one of them.  Might I add that you recently created a logo that goes against everything you've been saying. I have zero idea what the company does from looking at it (a company that guesses ears?), and it uses gradients through the entire thing:  https://www.reddit.com/r/logodesign/comments/3bs04w/a_logo_i_made_some_time_ago_for_my_weekend/  So I'm a bit baffled by your comments on all of this."

You are comparing multimillion company logo with something that I've programmed in 2 days and  needed to have an image to put online as profile picture, which I made in 7 minutes? Really? Well, then it's not a company logo in that case, it doesn't have to tell anything if you don't know what project it is related to (hence the ear and a question mark as you correctly guessed). It's not gonna be popular, anywhere on streets, print, any POS, it won't be black and white (hence gradients). I wasn't even saying anywhere that this 7 minute logo should be valuable by any means. And I didn't even ask for thoughts, opinions or anything :) So don't be baffled.  PS: Guess what my shitty logo would look like if I remove the gradients and print it in BW. And what a mess would this potion bottle look like.  PS: on a second look this logo reminded me of a purple thick glass container the size of a watermelon without a cork or any bottle cap.

The text is just there. In certain scenarios it may make more sense to put the text off to the side of the glyph. In some scenarios you may use no text at all. Arrangement isn't what we are trying to judge here, and that being said, I like the potion jar both flat and with the gradients.

If Colin is a guy, and takes pictures of things other than weddings and fields of flowers, I'd go a different visual route.  There are some serious kerning issues in the type. It reads CO LIN GO RDON, with other letter tweaking also needed. I like the typeface paired with the sans on the bottom. Sizing is good.

A less lengthy tail,  those toes wouldn't even show up small, i initially liked them though because they gave a serrated look,  but then i realized there was no reason for the compass to be serrated.  maybe a bigger compass to lizard ratio, then you could show that top left arm doing the traditional lizard pose.  imagine trying to make this a favicon and how even more detail would be lost, but still retain the idea behind the image."

How many colors do you need? Can you represent the train and building without the need for the lines? If I were you, I'd try to reduce that train ever further; Take out the links and maybe have four carts visible. All you need to do is get across that its a train. The text at the bottom seems off, too, and I'm not entirely sure that is the best position for it. And even if it is, I think it's still asking for some refinement. I also would probably keep the text color consistent with the rest of the logo for uniformity. Hell, if you could somehow manage it, I'd roll with a monotone design. Hope that was helpful.

I do like the idea of the taking out some of the train cars and trying to simplify them.  In terms of the text, ideally I would like to keep the two lines, but have the text fill the space (if that makes sense). Doing that has been tough, but I'm still working on it.

logodesign,3d4kdv,nicetriangle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:29:40 2015 UTC,Might be able to make it look better by abandoning the outline and letting the letters do all of the work. This was the only example I could find easily of a similar concept and it's not exceptional but is loosely what I'm talking about http://www.occguitars.com/images/charvel-logo-2.jpg  There's also the possibility that the style of letters you want to use for this just doesn't vibe well with this type of application and you may want to explore other ideas.
logodesign,3d4kdv,tomqvaxy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. In my head it seemed like a cool idea, I'll try to keep working at it with and without the outline. Maybe extend the top of the ""J"" out so it can imply more of the body shape to give the L context."

logodesign,3d4kdv,shingonzo,3,Mon Jul 13 14:22:28 2015 UTC,I would accomplish that by creating an offset path from the guitar and then hacking that into the letter or I would just use the pen tool and be very precise about it.

Another poster had the idea of replacing the top bun with the whole taxi sign - I would start there.   I would also play with a few different font options for the TAXI. If you're going to have words in the logo, they can't get lost in everything going on in the image, which is what happens, especially when you shrink the logo or put it on packaging.  The text looks like an afterthought, which can't happen.  Also, you've got nine different colors going on in that logo.  That's a lot going on in a small space, which is also going to get lost when you scale the logo down.

Simplify the number of colors. A good logo uses less colors. Remember, logos are supposed to work over a number of mediums. One medium that is often over looked is that of apparel. A logo with a lot of colors would require a lot of screens in screen printing and thread in digitizing for embroidery. This will make anything apparel-related with the logo incredibly expensive, therefore you'll likely have to reduce colors or go with a one color version, which will jeopardize any brand.   On the color topic: use PMS colors (Pantone Matching System). Specifically, use Pantone Solid Coated colors. This is crucial to making sure your logo is uniform across all mediums.   The logo is really unbalanced. The hierarchy is all over. A logo should really have a maximum of 3 tiers, if that. This has 4: The colorful P, the ""S"" and ""A"" (because they are larger), the ""ro"", ""et"", ""utism"" (because they are slightly smaller), and then your subtext.  I would start by reducing colors with in the P and then reducing it's size. I would make ""RO SET AUTISM"" all uniform in height and set as caps. Use a clean typeface, something simple and professional. Maybe Futura or Gill Sans.   If you're keeping the shape of the P (which needs some work), make the height of the ""RO SET AUTISM"" the same as the bowl (the curved part) of the P.  Your secondary text is really confusing. If you can shorten it (or leave part of it out), that would help you. If you have to keep it, replace the backslash with a hyphen. Then, GREATLY reduce the size of it. Make it about 1/4 of it's current size, then tuck it so it's under the bowl of the P. Then, exaggerate the tracking until it's right justified with the ""m"" in ""Autism"".  I know it's tempting (and fun) to save money by creating your own logo...but in the long run it will cost you more to do it this way. A good logo has a lot of design principles applied to it and should have several dozen drafts before being finalized. There's a reason why logo/graphic design is a 4-year specialized degree and designers are paid exponentially more based on their years of experience: it's hard.   Honestly, your best bet is to take your idea to a professional (the cheapest would be a professional freelancer...if you get the right one, you won't have to spend too much and the quality should be there). Their job is to take your idea and expand on it in ways you haven't thought of.   If they hand you over a logo without a brand standard telling you how to use it in different scenarios, then they didn't do a good job."
logodesign,3d2nnv,emayos,2,Mon Jul 13 02:13:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advice.  This logo is for a relative who runs a business teaching autistic kids tennis.  I could see the logo needed some work but they are not eilling to pay for it.  Their business cards are in comic sans and the website is being redesigned.  I think the website is the priority so they are focusijb on that and as an induvidual who knows a few basic desgn rules and has a general idea of how colours and shapes fit together I thought I could try to improve it slightly before he printed new business cards and created a new website with this logo.

You've got 12 different colors in this logo, and while EDGE kind of works, BEVELED has too many letters and too many colors, so the impact is a bit lost in confusion.  The pros, however, are that I like the idea behind it all. It has a very clever MC Escher look, with kind of a 60s throwback vibe.  If you simplify the color element a bit I think you'd be onto something really nice."

So I took ""W"" from Wroblewski and ""M"" from Michal and made a logotype. This is just a logotype, the ""full version"" of the logo will contain my name and last name right next to it.  In this logotype I mixed two the same letters - M. One of them is upside-down, so it looks like a W - I wanted to keep these two letters in exactly the same style. Then, I ""cut"" it, so you can see ""W"" on the top and ""M"" below it. I wanted to keep it really clean, minimalistic and nice to eyes.  Long time ago I made a logotype using three letters from my first name and last name - ""MICWRO"". I'll put it here if I'll find it."

Just looking for some general feedback here, any fundamental design rules I've broken or any suggestions to make it look a little more professional.  The font I've used is a free front called Monsterrat, a royalty-free alternative to Proxima Nova which I'd prefer but don't want to purchase at this time.  My other concern is that the little pixel graphic is inspired by this sprite from the game Super Mario World, however the graphic I've made was created from scratch without a reference. Is it too similar? Could I run into potential copyright issues if I were to try and trademark it down the track?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks."

logodesign,3crvth,Manlyarmpits,2,Fri Jul 10 08:51:26 2015 UTC,Yellow definitely pops really nicely with the purple but I'm worried it just makes the graphic even more similar to the Mario sprite further erasing any identity.

Is the aussie perspective important? Is there a spesific genre of games that is of more interest, or is it EVERYTHING? Are there any meaningful colors you could/should use (australia has gold/green as national colors, red/grey/black is NES, etc)?   It is important to seperate the logo and Mario, but I think you should take a step back. :)"

I am going back to the drawing board. Unfortunately the client refuses to give me more information on his company he continuously gives me generic responses. So I have until the 14th to sketch a bit more and get something mocked up. Sadly, since he doesn't know what direction he wants to go with the company and he wants a logo right now and refuses to take my opinion, he's not going to get much. I'd rather deliver him something by the deadline  than nothing at all. If he doesn't like the new one I am working on right now, we can renegotiate."

logodesign,3cioy5,Aztekke,2,Wed Jul 8 07:40:49 2015 UTC,"I appreciate all the feedback, it is extremely helpful. I will redo this without texture (find another font entirely) and I might make the umbrella regular instead of inverted. I used the texture only because I know that the company likes the Umbrella Corp logo which is a bit grungy, but I guess it doesn't quite match their tech company. I inverted the umbrella because I saw a poster of someone holding one and flying up into the air, I thought of it in a positive way but I can see where it might seem negative, like a broken umbrella. I also wanted to try a different logo than just a regular umbrella since the company is spelled with an A instead of a U. But I like the suggestions and the comments everyone has made and will use them. Maybe I will even show it to the company if I can make the logo look better."
logodesign,3cioy5,Geminii27,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:13:16 2015 UTC,"Try italic for the font, the holder of the umbrella does not connect to the umbrella itself, loose the texture and it's AOK :)"

Might work for a classy place or service which gets most of its clientele via word of mouth."
logodesign,3cioy5,El3mentGamer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"Kudos to you for learning graphic design. First piece of advice: don't give up. You'll have many moments where you will convince yourself that you don't have the skills or the creativity. Then one day, you'll do something that you really like and it will reenergize you. Fight through your own self-critical thinking and keep at it!  Second piece of advice: strategy comes before design. Good design is pretty. Great design is pretty AND smart. Logos are a company's identity, the physical manifestation of their brand values. So before you do any design work, you need to have a solid idea of what that logo is supposed to communicate. As people pointed out here, the blown out umbrella looks cool, but what do you think the message consumers are getting is? Chaos, unexpected events, malfunction, etc.  Final piece of advice: Simple Wins. Don't overcomplicate with textures and unnecessary elements. Keep it simple. Google ""logo evolution"" and look at how many brands have spent years and years simplifying their logos through iterative refinement. That doesn't mean you can't inject creativity into your design or do something cool. It means you need to be able to edit your work and really ask yourself ""is this adding anything""?  Specific to this logo, I would kill the textures on the lettering. It won't render in small sizes anyways, and frankly, why is it there in the first place? Then you need to focus on the practical - is this logo always going to be on black? How does it look on white? Is there too much verticality? Start thinking about it in context - how does it appear on a website, a business card, a print ad, etc.  Oh, and def fix the kerning! :)"

It's like they just decided they were gonna call it 'x' and let the pieces fall where they may. As far as I know none of them ever took much of a symbolic logo, but instead settled on an iconic and identifiable type based logo (Zoo York is the ZY logo). They are now free to use any iconography they choose for seasonal things, and can drop it whenever they want. Their logo is the type, the tag. How about AU REA as the brand and Young Carlos as a logo, or the basis for a collection?  To me, this would come off as more of a poser line, in other words trying too hard... It's just so upfront, I mean picture YUNG SWAGGA wearing his hat real low, while wearing a shirt with Yvng Au Rea wearing it the same way. It might be a bit much. Your mileage may vary, though."

logodesign,3cc0dd,exit65,2,Mon Jul 6 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"I think that's definitely better much better; makes it look like a solid object rather than a contoured surface.  I think I'd increase the prominence of of the nose and wing tips (extend them outwards) and replace the star tail with a two-triangle fan-tail to finish off:   The fan-tail would remove the ""mouth"" of the face. Having the bird's head going above the start of the wing more obviously would remove the ""nose"" of the face (it would be further up than the ""eyes"").   EDIT: Bottom right image here has a fan-tail - that but flat. (Not on desktop or I'd do it.)"
logodesign,3cc0dd,TriumphantGeorge,2,Mon Jul 6 20:02:47 2015 UTC,Yea the star tail seems to me like something op kept in because they originally wanted it. it doesn't really work with the piece. fan-tail would absolutely make things better.

While I agree that a great deal of art has been religiously themed, my study of art history doesn't corroborate your statement at all. I'd say that's a major exaggeration.  If you account for the fact that the barrier to entry for art has never been lower and that the world today is more secular than ever, while the population is massive, it's pretty easy to surmise that modern, secular art has eclipsed religious art by a long shot. Also since industrialization, art for marketing and package design has been produced at such a rate that there is absolutely no way that religious art could possibly compete in volume."

At small sizes it all runs together. I would also recommend figuring out a way to increase the size of the type relative to the rest of the design. It really could use a boost in visual hierarchy. That could include making it just larger and have it cut through some of the frame more, or you could set the type on two lines and increase the size and have it fill more of the middle."

Lore: I've noticed almost all dance schools have dancing figures in their logos as it's kinda difficult to convey dance with abstract shapes or letters. Drawing figures is my strong suit so I went with that. I wanted to use a handwritten-ish font since it's for a young audience. I think if this dance was a word it'd be italic.

logodesign,3bslnz,Luthery,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"One method in Photoshop:  For a black/dark background, you would create a solid black layer above all layers you want the effect applied to. Fill that layer with black, set the blend mode to screen. Apply an add noise filter, and adjust settings as needed (monochromatic, usually between 5 and 10%)  For a lighter background, you would do the same except fill the top layer white and set its blending mode to multiply.  There are other ways, this is roughly what I do. Some people would use premade textures or apply the noise effect to the image directly without using a top layer with a blending mode. It's a matter of preference."

logodesign,3bmun7,FangzV,4,Tue Jun 30 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"2 still looks like a flag. 11 is probably the best, try incorporating a bow motif either at the intersection or on top."
logodesign,3bmun7,bunnythedog,6,Tue Jun 30 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"The X reminds me too much of the flag of Scotland, the second is best because it contains same content as the others without the unnecessary complications. I also think that the "".com.ve"" should go more to the left and the letters of ""gft"" might have been connected. Still, the gift tag is an interesting element. What if it looked like this: http://i.imgur.com/NqyUgM6.jpg  Or this: http://i.imgur.com/yyzjHyS.jpg  The execution probably could have been much better, but you get the idea."
logodesign,3bmun7,DoughnutFan,2,Tue Jun 30 19:02:23 2015 UTC,"I think there's a nice vibe going on with these designs.... maybe mix the blue design i want to introduce into the tag + gift ribbons....  Thanks for the ideas btw, great artwork!"
logodesign,3bmun7,cambookpro,4,Tue Jun 30 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming these designs are based on the imagery of a gift? A blue box with white ribbons on it?  If that's the case, I would go with the version in the top right, because it's the least ambiguous. V1 doesn't read as a present, and V2 reads more like a flag. The addition of the tag in V3 locks it in as a gift. Maybe include a small curved line connecting the tag to the intersection of the ribbons?  If my gift-box assumption is incorrect, please disregard."

The gift label removes a bit of ambiguity."

logodesign,3bmqrb,piratelax40,2,Tue Jun 30 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"I can't really give you a straight answer like you're looking for, as there are too many variables involved for logos. Expect something definitely in the hundreds, but maybe even thousands of dollars. You'll have to speak with a designer you'd like to work with directory. Here are some things to consider:  Budget:  For first timers, I find it best to have the client set the budget and work within that, explaining exactly what I will do for their price, meaning the process, revisions, and timeframe. That way the client doesn't have lofty expectations and is aware that they need to actually think about the changes they ask for, instead of just shooting over random ideas which can really bloat a budget.  The important thing clients need to know when considering budget is the 'pick two' rule: Good, Cheap, & Fast. Whatever two you choose, it has the opposite effect on the remaining one. (eg Cheap and Fast won't be Good, etc).   Even though most logos are flat fees, the thing to understand is you are paying for TIME, not the design itself. Good logos are good because the client paid the designer more for more time to spend working on a good logo.  Communication  The best way for you to help the designer is to explain what the logo is for and how you plan to use it. If you have no idea, then say that, don't just use blind trigger words such as 'modern, clean, unique, etc'. A good designer will ask you all the right questions, in the same way a lawyer or accountant knows what to ask their clients.   You may want some examples of logos you want to emulate, but only provide those if you have a very strong direction with focused examples. Sending over fortune 500 company logos doesn't help at all.  The other thing is to listen to what the designer has to say, they are the expert. When a client starts micromanaging things can get frustrating, especially when a they have no experience in design. Most bad designs were made in the board room, not the studio. That said, don't get hung up on small things. You telling a designer to shift something over, make something pop, etc REALLY messes with the overall design.  End Results  Generally nowadays you will receive a vector file (.ai, .eps, .svg) which can be scaled or modified to any size, and exported as almost any file format you would need (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc). These won't cost extra as long as you work with a reputable designer, and know what to ask for ahead of time. Keep those files, especially the vector in multiple safe places, backed up on a DVD or CD or in the cloud. Once that vector file is gone, you will be stuck. You have no idea how much companies waste on paying a different designer to redo their logo from a jpeg because they couldn't be bothered to backup the file, and it never looks quite the same."
logodesign,3bmqrb,fat_over_lean,2,Tue Jun 30 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"ah thanks so much, this was exactly what I needed to hear! I wasn't expecting a 'straight answer' as I understand these things are highly specific and dependent on both parties, just wanted to start with the best foot I could forward.  Thank you very much for your input! :-) Good to know its the norm to receive a vector file, thats what I hoped but didn't know if that was the norm."
logodesign,3bmqrb,fat_over_lean,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"You should still communicate that you want a vector, just to be safe.

The name of the company is much too long to wrap around in a circle like that, IMO. It was a bit of a struggle to read it. I think you need a different type treatment.

A logo is a single symbol used to identify a brand/person/company/etc. It's just doing way, way too much.   Also that font is terribly illegible. Glow Ya Ro? Slow Yo Ro? Clarity and memorability are at the forefront of logo design. In the end it has to be recognizable and unique without being overcrowded and overdone. I firmly believe this needs a complete redesign rather than a scaling back.   Edit: Given the theme of your restaurant that sushi roll/joint thing could be the main focus, but it needs serious redesigning to get it looking recognizable and clean. That along with an easy to understand typeface for the name could make a strong logo that can be instantly recognizable and popular."

logodesign,3bbqg2,jeffderek,20,Sun Jun 28 20:14:19 2015 UTC,If you're going for a 1920s look then the highly detailed stamp is exactly what you want. A minimal and parsed down logo won't communicate the emotions and mindset of the time period whereas that stamp looks absolutely great.
logodesign,3bbqg2,nicetriangle,7,Sat Jun 27 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.  You can either have a minimal logo where all of the elements are identifiable from a distance, or you can emulate a time period where detail was an important part of every design.  You can't do both.  I also really like the stamp."
logodesign,3bbqg2,mayagrafix,11,Sun Jun 28 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's overly detailed given the vibe you're aiming for. If you study logomark design from the turn of the century and on into the 20s and 30s, it was often very detailed. Print houses especially often had very ornate brand marks and you're associating with letterpressing.  You may just consider making a stripped down variant for situations when you need something printed very small or embroidered, for for social media icons, but I think this logo looks great for a lot of the applications you'll run into."

I think the shading in the sky makes it feel too busy. I think you can just let the sky be blank space. Also, the left propeller lines up with the circular border, which makes the airplane seem to flatten out and blend into the background. I think if you adjust the placement and/or size of the airplane, it'll jump out more as a distinct element.   I think it looks fantastic, and you're 90% of the way there.

logodesign,3b7chf,_Woodrow_,6,Fri Jun 26 16:05:36 2015 UTC,Here's a quick and dirty variant of your idea you might like. The leafy part is pretty shit but I think the carrot shape looks better.  The drop/carrot shape is really easy to make with one circle. Here's a gif I made of the basic idea.
logodesign,3b7chf,nicetriangle,20,Fri Jun 26 16:25:16 2015 UTC,That loses the idea of the carrot also looking like a drop of juice
logodesign,3b7chf,_Woodrow_,6,Fri Jun 26 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Maybe to some degree in my example but OP's carrot looks like an orange beet or radish. It's not uncommon for stylized water drop designs to be shaped like mine is and my shape is way more recognizable as a carrot. It's more of a matter of getting the highlights to better agree with the idea of it being a droplet.

logodesign,3b7chf,Tartra,12,Fri Jun 26 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"I see what you're going for with it being a carrot and droplet shape, but I'm afraid that's just making it look like an upside down radish or beet to me. It's a strong concept, but I worry that in execution its not going to come out the way you imagined it when people see it with no background, especially if its ever not orange.  EDIT: Some things you could do to make it better: Others have said this already but I think you need to push it more in the direction of carrot and less towards a drop, meaning ridges and maybe a slightly more oblong shape. The thing that says radish to me is how round it is, and I think it could still read as a drop even if the base shape were more of an oval. I know that won't quite jive with what you've got going on with your circle construction, but don't sacrifice strengthening a design because you feel like you need to be a slave to a trend that other designers are doing (meaning showing how they used circles to construct something). The circles got you pretty far, now you just have to push it the rest of the way on your own."
logodesign,3b7chf,acertaingestault,2,Fri Jun 26 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"I'll second that. The one outlined with circles looked the best to me because it had the horizontal ridges that an actual carrot has. This one, even though it's supposed to be a juice drop, just looks too smooth and squat. Maybe if the shape was elongated, maybe it ridges were added, maybe if the leaves looked more realistic..."
logodesign,3b7chf,deviantbono,8,Fri Jun 26 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"That typeface is horrible. When choosing a wordmark to go with your carrot drop, choose it by itself. Make sure it looks good alone, and then put them together. I would worry less about color at this point in time. Do it in black and white first until it looks good and then add color. Color can often make it more difficult to identify issues.  I like the carrot/drop idea and I think you mostly executed it well. I would change the top spot that /u/nicetriangle circled in red as it just feels sort of funky, but otherwise, I like the drop.   The green on the other hand needs some help. As it stands, it's pretty one dimensional where the drop is very three dimensional, and I think reshaping the leaves to looks more like actual carrot leaves could help it read better as a carrot.  Can't wait to see your progress."

I would say you should kick around a few more layouts in that same vein. What would a carrot shaped juice glass or, a carrot shaped splash look like? How could you stylize the leaves into something else? You could do it as a garnish on the glass, or style it into a W for the word Worly If I were you, I'd kick a few sketches around to see if you could tie the carrot into other ""juice"" related objects.

You don't need to be so spot-on with repeat elements in the letters as well. You should just try to capture a similar ""feel"" as the shape you make with logoform. Also, having the text overlay the image removes the clarity of the 2 in one idea you were trying to convey.

I love me my sharp and straight lines, but when it's been done by so many people there needs to be a third, sort of ""wow"" factor to it, and this doesn't really have that.  Another thing to note is what is this a logo for? I don't know if I could honestly call this a logo as much as just a heading of sorts. The difference being, for example, a logo would be what you set as, say, your profile picture, while a header would be set as your cover photo or whatever. If this is to be shrunk down to the size of a profile picture, it's going to be kind of.. meh, and hard to read. People will know it says something, but have no idea what it really says.  Take all this mildly, I am by no means a professional at this and simply mess around with Graphic Design and Logo Design as a self-taught hobbyist.

Unfortunately, this doesn't read buildings as you've lost the home outlines (which don't make sense since they sell commercial anyway) and the windows (which were poorly done originally).  If I were you, I'd do some more research. Gather together some color schemes you like (This one reads a little 1970's to me with the harvest gold, olive and burnt orange.), maybe some skylines you like (if you'd like to stick to that idea) and draw out a hundred logo ideas, just like they make you do in art school.

Obviously there is creative interpretation that can lead to a less anatomically correct figure but a more visually appealing one, that's not what we are talking about here. The problem with the OPs logo is that it doesn't make sense anatomically or visually. The way he has the polys constructed makes a fairly nonsensical horn shape if it were rendered three dimensionally. A Rams horns go in more of a spiral. So, completely ignoring that, the polys are also boring to look at and don't really have much visual interest. They are all about the same size and shape. There is no push and pull. The shapes don't lead your eye anywhere."

I tried it once before with using a white beard and glasses and it looked like Santa lol.   For context I wanted a logo to evoke the idea of the everyday average geek. The main circle part of the logo is usually what is seen on it's own apart from the text. The idea was to be sort of a geek anonymous face.  I'm concerned with it being very male centric and wondering if maybe something more gender neutral would be better or if maybe moving to a completely different idea would be best.

This officially started with battle #25. During the two week period where people are submitting entries for a battle, the voting for the previous battle is also going on at the same time for that same two weeks. This means winners for a battle will not be announced until two weeks after all submissions were entered. This way, every entry may be voted on for the same period of time and people can't tank eachother with downvotes.   So entries for #26 are being accepted right now and voting on #25 is also happening right now.

It's definitely a little less intuitive and a bit more complicated than the old upvote system, but the results so far are showing that the upvote counts follow a totally different pattern than the form vote counts and that they were definitely favoring people who entered earlier into the battle.

Regarded as one of the most accomplished sports conferences in terms of its winning reputation, the SEC is also highly successful financially. The conference consistently leads most others in revenue distribution to its members, including an SEC record $455.8 million for the 2014-15 fiscal year,  which was a sizable increase over the $292.8 million for the 2013–14 fiscal year,  largely due to the revenue from the introduction of the SEC Network.

First let me reply to comments made.   @robot_turtle Thank you !    @onemoregenius @LAASR  Musical endeavours aside, I am the proud caretaker of a handful of wild birds, around which my life has come to revolve over the past few years.  The name also hints at origami, which we thought would be fun to play with where marketing is concerned.  That is all.  No deeper significance.  Why are record labels named 5 Rue Christine, or Quiet Year, or Young God, or Orchid Tapes ?  It's just circumstance and imagery, really.  As for the typeface it is, in fact, the same above and below; the one above is altered is all, but I'll play with the bottom one and see how it looks !  @ashura2k  Thank you for your input.  I'll work on it some more and post the results.    Now for my original post ...  Feel free to be harsh in your critique, please.  I am not a graphic designer, but am looking to arrive at something good.  Here's some insight into my process.   Started off with a simple design; essentially the paper dove you see in black, on either side of the logo.  The dove was white then, in a black circle, and that was it.  This annoyed me in a sense, because it felt like the first idea that might pop in one's mind (and in fact it was), and felt like ten other enterprises might come up with the same idea, if they hadn't already.  Next, I folded my first paper dove.  After unfolding it, I traced the lines which had resulted from the folding.  This gave a neat diamond-shaped diagram of sorts, with a star at its center.  I considered just going with that shape as is;  I liked the idea of an obscure representation of a paper dove.  I then noticed that the shape at the center of this unfolded paper dove was very bird-like, and decided to work from there.  This is the shape you now see in the center of the logo.  I left it as it was; in other words, the shape you see there is basically a piece of the unfolded paper dove.  Where typography is concerned, I originally started by placing it inside the circle.  From there, I had the idea of merging the P and the E with the outer edge stroke.  With this done however, the P merging as it did, the E started to look funny, like there was too much weight on the right hand side.  So I broke the E's center arm.  This worked, but had a similar effect on the remaining letters than the P initially had on the E.  I elected to tamper with the other letters as well.  Did I just violate something precious?  Typefaces are such a delicate, wonderous thing.  Finally, I included my original paper dove outlines, to stand as bookends of sorts, again in an attempt to balance things out.  Your opinions, please !"

logodesign,3ani4r,astro_case,2,Mon Jun 22 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be completely honest here: I do not see any of your description represented in your logo.  You need to think how your logomark is representing your business. You need it to say    Bracelets and necklaces, clutch purses, leather and metal, simple statement pieces.    Your logo needs to represent you to your customer base:   people like me, and for people who like to layer their stuff.   What do I see in your logo?   A jewellery store that sells costume jewellery that looks nice, but maybe isn't super expensive. I'd say your target group is teens to mid-twenties females. There appears to be a product line that is focussed on precious stones/glamour-stones that appear to be big and for an outfit to dazzle.  There is nothing in this logo that even hints at leather and metal to me.  With these things in mind, I think you're taking the wrong direction with this mark. My humble advice is that you take a step back and have a good think about how you can really represent your branding more appropriately.  I hope this helps :-)"

For example, the BUILDER font uses large pixels, while the subheading font uses smaller pixels. I would either make it uniform or change the subheading font to something that isn't pixelated. In addition, your color scheme needs to be more harmonious.

I like what's happening with the blade, and trees (sunset?), but the trees seem to complex. Either lose the trees or make them more simple.

logodesign,3ajcha,samili,5,Sun Jun 21 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"I like this because it keeps the trees, which are potentially integral considering the dependency on wood for the company and provides a nice rustic feel, while making the logo simple and easy to scale.  If you were going to get rid of the trees I might suggest a mountain range to keep with the rustic/masculine theme. Without something there you wouldn't be able to tell this is a sunset."
logodesign,3ajcha,Acedrew89,19,Sun Jun 21 16:00:25 2015 UTC,"Less is more - Drop the trees  Text needs a bit more room to breathe - Losing the trees helps ""Ross"", allowing a bit more space between the main bulk of the logo and ""Carpentry"", I think removing the bottom line entirely would be a good idea as the typeface already provides a strong base.  Great concept! I love how the saw looks like a rising sun."
logodesign,3ajcha,SolaVirtus,5,Sat Jun 20 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think if you dropped the trees it would loose the ""sunset"" look you commented on.  I think if the trees would be simplified and moved out to sides a bit it would look better and still hold on to the sunset look. Great work OP!"

logodesign,3ajcha,Devnik,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:07:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely has potential. I would space out the lines evenly so they're both the same length and just put the full name between them (vertically centered). Then lose one of the trees and make one of them bigger and center it within the saw. I'd also remove the little saw part sticking out on the left. Like someone said before, less is more. But that's just what I would do."
logodesign,3ajcha,notjustanymike,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with the mob here - drop the trees.  For one, they won't scale down. Even here on reddit, the 70x40 image preview turns the trees into blobs. Your logo needs to work on the side of a van down to letterhead and business cards. Elements with lots of detail, like trees, won't work.   If you're going for a sunset look, I'd ask why. What do sunsets have to do with carpentry?  Once you ditch the trees, you can probably bump up the font size on ROSS. I mean, his name is the most important part right?  I'd also fix the bottom spacing on ""carpentry"". There's not enough white space for the letters to breath, and like the trees it doesn't scale well.   Solid idea, just needs polish."

Hard to believe that they did this. The silhouettes are poorly placed & sized and combined with all of the little stars it looks very messy and distracting.  This is better. https://cdn.d23.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/feat.png  And this: https://cdn.d23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/d23expo_iris.png"

The angles of the castle, the silhouettes, the stars, it's all very distracting and I completely pulls away from the text next to the logo in a bad way."
logodesign,3airiz,Acedrew89,4,Sun Jun 21 16:04:07 2015 UTC,It's definitely underwhelming. I wouldn't be satisfied if I had hired someone to make it.
logodesign,3airiz,ArtisticProgrammer,3,Sat Jun 20 16:38:51 2015 UTC,I think that they could have gone with something a little more simplistic. It looks pretty odd when it's sized down.
logodesign,3airiz,-After,2,Sat Jun 20 16:55:50 2015 UTC,It's not supposed to be resized: it's not a logo.
logodesign,3airiz,dado3212,3,Sat Jun 20 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"It has been resized to fit on merchandise. It's not pretty but they must like it. People say if you can't scale it down, it's not a logo. At what size must it be legible to be ""officially"" considered a logo?"
logodesign,3airiz,dado3212,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:33:32 2015 UTC,What would you say the distinction is between an illustration for an event and a logo for an event is?
logodesign,3airiz,dado3212,2,Sat Jun 20 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"Since you can't answer my question, I'll answer yours. Now days there are 2 types of logo designs, Illustrative logos (think sports teams like the Mavericks and OKC thunder) and Iconic logos (Nike, Fedex etc...) A logo is a name, graphic, or symbol that distinctly represents a  company, event, idea, product, etc. Illustrations take a lot more time to create, because they generally have multiple layers, each containing a small part of the illustration. They tend to have complex shapes, often times with gradients or textures and multiple layers and colors, building up to a much larger image. This subreddit constantly confuses good logo design choices with the definition of a logo. Is it smart to design a logo that is simple, scalable and easily converted from color to b/w...of course it is. Just because a graphic image used to identify a product is not legible if printed on a postage stamp, does not mean it can't be a logo. It means bad design choices were made."

logodesign,3airiz,dustabor,-7,Sat Jun 20 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't know you were permitted to change the definition of a logo. At one time it was a distinctive design, stylized name, or symbol used to represent a company, product or event. In the title I asked your opinion of the castle, not the illustration or typography. The castle, on it's own, is what Disney is using as the logo for D23. I included the illustration to the right so redditors can see what the castle is being used to represent which helps give a better critique."
logodesign,3airiz,dado3212,-2,Sat Jun 20 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"You're moving on because you've explained nothing. What criteria does an illustration have to meet for you to consider it a logo? It can not change regularly? Sorry every major sporting event, concert and festival. It must be simple and scalable to a certain mystery size that no one here can decide on? So long Starbucks. Can not have more than 2 or 3 colors? No one told Ebay. You must become enraged anytime you watch sports because team logos, or apparently team illustrations, are getting out of hand by your standards."
logodesign,3airiz,Izanasz,2,Sat Jun 20 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  When you say 'logo' you instantly think company or product based branding, rarely event.  The stuff on the right isn't an illustration, but the castle is.  It's being used to advertise, but it's not a logo.  It won't be shrunk, resized, placed alone, it will constantly be paired with the right side of the image.  It's not a logo."
logodesign,3airiz,Lobstrich,0,Sat Jun 20 20:16:02 2015 UTC,I don't think you thought your event comment through. What about famous concerts like Coachella and Voodoo fest or sporting events like the Olympics and Tour de France. Are the Olympic rings not a logo?
logodesign,3airiz,MrHorbilon,3,Sat Jun 20 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it doesn't happen, I'm saying it's rarer.  The Olympic rings are a logo.  The Tour de France is a logo.  I'm saying that you can represent an event through a logo or an illustration.  Both symbolize the event.  A logo is special though because it's all-purpose, and can work on a variety of mediums.  It's just the core idea.  The contents of this shirt for Lollapalooza is not a logo.  It's an illustration, even though it represents the event.  This would be a logo."
logodesign,3akqvz,wakato106,14,Sun Jun 21 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"At first glance, I though it said ""testicles.""  But on a more serious note: it's definitely graffiti, but it seems so riddled with random angles and juts that it looks all over the place. It looks like pseudo-graffiti I would find on a children's website trying to appeal to the young demographic.  Maybe simplify it. There are tons of angles in the stroke that are distracting. The thickness of the words are also inconsistent and difficult to read."
logodesign,3akqvz,LadyLieDie,8,Sun Jun 21 04:45:34 2015 UTC,"I will be honest, I don't really like it. I get the graffiti vibe, and at first I did immediately think of a hip hop dance group, so it is working in that sense. But at the same time it looks too jagged and edged to really fit with the style. I just feel like a lot of people wouldn't look at this logo in a serious way. I think you are on the right track.  All of this is just my opinion."
logodesign,3akqvz,putputcat,7,Sun Jun 21 04:16:56 2015 UTC,Pretty lame in my opinion. Looks like someone that doesn't understand graffiti tried to appropriate it.
logodesign,3akqvz,vuxanov,2,Sun Jun 21 11:16:20 2015 UTC,"Not a fan. You captured the graffiti vibe, but it just looks too messy for my liking. It's not the easiest thing to read and I'm not a fan of the color choice either."

logodesign,3akqvz,notjustanymike,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with the rest, It needs to be simplified. I've seen a lot of good looking graffiti lettering out there, but that's all they are. They aren't meant to be logos in anyway because a logo needs to branch out to different kinds of people. (well some are considered logos but we won't go into all that now)  So, how can it be simplified but retain that urban graffiti look you want? Take a look at this example from a video game back in 2000s. In order for Sega to release this game to the world, it had to be legible enough to be read by an enormous amount of people. But, still retain that spray paint look. Thus, they solved this problem  by styling outside the letters, adding space between them, and keeping them relatively flat. Take a look  There's no need for them to be bunched up or have drop shadows. You also don't want them to be flat, because then it looses its momentum or sense of movement.  Or you can take a look at this logo from Square Enix. They wanted to retain that graffiti style, so they added the name in regular type on the bottom. Just food for thought.  Cheers!"

logodesign,3aji4i,greenphlem,3,Sat Jun 20 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"Hey man! I would put the letters a little closer together and get rid of the swirly design in the bottom. A good logo is representative of an idea or theme, even when designing for something small. The current design doesn't convey the idea of a group of gamers. Maybe integrate gaming controllers or headsets as your central point. There are some fantastic tutorials on YouTube and more specifically Lynda that can help you grasp the basics of graphic design."

logodesign,3aji4i,JakobGasiorek,0,Sat Jun 20 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know enough about logo design to create a logo. Not trying to be offensive but your logo looks like you opened paint and rolled your face over the keyboard a few times.  And that ""background"" you paired it with is from a tutorial (from Chris Spooner iirc) you just did. Those are meant for practice and not for publication."
logodesign,3aji4i,Lobstrich,3,Sat Jun 20 21:44:42 2015 UTC,"That's perfectly valid criticism! I agree it looks bad that's why I came here, everyone has to start somewhere, right?   Also this is for a private gaming group, nothing public so I just put that background. Don't worry.  Edit: also I've realized this might not be the best sub to ask.

logodesign,3aji4i,PM_ME_YOUR_BOBBYS,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:09:56 2015 UTC,I kind of like the letters. The swirly bar at the bottom could take a vacation. I know the letters are probably technically the same height but because the b has more mad it looks bigger. Moving them closer might solve the problem but you may want to make the b a little smaller.
logodesign,3aji4i,Lobstrich,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:12:13 2015 UTC,"good start, but that design below MB doesn't scream gaming. I would drop it and focus more on MB. Color is a big thing, especially if you are going to go with a simple MB (nothing wrong with that at all) so I would choose a color you guys would want to associate yourselves with and stick with it."

The big problem I see is that the rams head and the paint gun are at completely different perspectives.  The paint gun is flat and the ram is in a pseudo-3D kind of angle.  To me, one of these things should definitely change.   You could also simplify the design of the paint gun so that it would scale better. I'm not crazy about the font for ""R.A.M."""
logodesign,3aa1th,Xyrqurqualym,3,Thu Jun 18 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"How about, the simplest possible solution, you have a paintgun that has the ram as a logo on it?  Or how about having the paint gun spraypaint the ram onto whatever surface?"
logodesign,3aa1th,wearefishandwedrown,2,Thu Jun 18 14:20:07 2015 UTC,Be honest with him and tell him how bad of an idea the paint gun is.
logodesign,3aa1th,wearefishandwedrown,6,Thu Jun 18 13:05:13 2015 UTC,"Tried that, explained that reproducing with embroidery, or at small sizes it will look awful and its confusing if you don't know what a paint gun looks like no matter how its positioned. He won't budge on this point, he feels that he needs the gun in there. He's really proud of is painting career so its an ego attachment thing :/ So, I need to keep it in there-clients man."

They come back because the work is good, and pay the rate because they get more than a mouse clicker...they get a professional creative marketing consultant.   If all you are willing to do whatever the client says for a few bucks, then the client is only paying for a mouse clicker, making the lowest bid the best. You have no value, you offer nothing more than the next guy, at a lower cost.  Value is found in professional and results driven design."

logodesign,3aay6h,novalsi,5,Thu Jun 18 22:05:51 2015 UTC,Because it's psuedo-eyecatching rather than actually being a visually striking design.

logodesign,3aay6h,novalsi,3,Thu Jun 18 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"I should go with the first one, altough I would make a couple of changes. When thinking about chimneys the first thing that pops into my mind is smoke. None of these has smoke...  If I was you, I would add some smoke and remove that border. It also doesn't really look digital, so you might want to make smoke using zeroes and ones (if it looks good, otherwise, scrap that)."

The second one is okay, but even if the chimney is slanted - something i've never seen, ever, in the real world, the two connectors should like up over one another.  The third one is the most solid, except you need to axe the gradients and the circuit circus on the side.  maybe make eight layers of brick and try to emulate/suggest an rj-45 pinout?    I don't know.  But you've got some good starts here.  Don't be afraid to keep building on what you've got."

I'd like to see it without the greyscale shading within the chimney itself so I can see what it would look like in a thumbnail or icon, but in general I think it's got some very good stuff going on.  I don't know what font that is but I love the slice out of the D for some reason. Unreadable and easy to forget. I love the concept with the circuit board in the chimney, but when you shrink it, it loses all recognizability (not a word, but whatever).

logodesign,3aay6h,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"I think the third one (with perspecitve) is the best execution, but it still needs some cleanup and simplification.  There probably only needs to be 4 rows of bricks, and they should be split in a staggered way, like bricks.  Lose the continuation of the lowest brick as an underline.  The circuit traces are distorted, especially the pads.  They could likewise be simplified, and some angled lines instroduced.  someone needs to study circuitboard layouts a bit more.  This begs for a more modern, sans-serif font, but not one that's too light."
logodesign,3aay6h,Caraes_Naur,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:19:16 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the first one. Doesn't necessarily evoke a chimney, but it's there. I'd leave the pink strap in and remove the triangular sections. They don't need to be there, and they certainly won't be useful when the design is smaller.  The second one, while t does have some merit, bugs me out. I suppose you were trying to go for a goofier approach, which is okay, but I'm not a fan of the execution. I don't like the font (the letters M and Y especially skeeve me out), and I'm not too sure about the tilt of the chimney either. But I guess it could work with some tweaking.  The third one is on par with the first one, as far as I'm concerned, but my sense of aesthetics (not regarding it objectively now) tells me the text is a bit too smal for the chimney, plus, again, not foo fond of the font as it kind of cheapens the look. Plus it's a bit too close to the chimney. I'd also, maaaaybe, remove a few lines on the left side of the chimney, not too many, but just a few to make it less haphazard. And.. I wouldn't pair green with purple, it reminds me too much of a clown. Or Hopgoblin. Or the Joker. You can never go wrong with black/white/gray."
logodesign,3aay6h,Izanasz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"I really think it needs an emphasis on the bricks, as that's arguably the most defining chimney feature.

What you want for a good logo is a mark, something that sets you apart, IMO great logos are abstract, they present a simple idea but if you get to know more about the company and their history, values, quirks, you find new meaning in the logo.  Once again IMO, this piece achieves none of the above, it is so detailed that it would decluttered in a small scale. The idea is well anyone can think hermes greek god shoes with wings on it. I like that you used a new balance and you could build from that.   Try to always dissent your logo in black and white, there will be many times your logo has to be in b/w and if it only looks good because of the color scheme, shading, then it isn't a good logo.

It states that you only need these five typefaces: Bodoni, Helvetica, Times Roman, Century, Futura. And varying the relative size and weight of these types (and sometimes combining two that contrast) is enough to do anything.  E.g. A poster depicting a dog barking should not make the type also ""bark"" (you may disagree). The poster should employ good use of composition, color, proportion, and dynamic. Above all, the poster must fulfill its communicative purpose."
logodesign,3a5qq7,fizolof,3,Thu Jun 18 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"I like the second attempt, the dots make the logo feel science-y. Maybe color them in various hues to symbolze the diversity of topics in the series (just a simple idea, I know coloring is pretty cliche)? However, the type is ugly and doesn't fit visually with the illustration. Helvetica is a good font, but here it is used very blandly. And the coloring of initials, especially with a color that is out of place and not to be found anywhere else on the logo, is completely unnecessary and adds clutter. Personally, I would thin it up and increase the tracking to make it more unified with the dots and give it a delicate, scientific feel, also maybe make the word ""Ethnology"" more prominent, so it looks something like this: http://i.imgur.com/1eX4SrR.jpg (the symbol doesn't mean anything, it's just for the purposes of demonstration)."

How do you usually choose a type, is there a certain set that fits ""professional"" needs? Is it a trained eye that lets you decide? Is there any literature/blog/tutorial to help develop a feel for it?"
logodesign,3a5qq7,MasterCharlz,2,Thu Jun 18 10:47:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm a beginner, so I don't know much about fonts. But I know that every font has its distinct character and it has to fit the purpose of the logo. You have to look at what the font ""says"" and if these are the right things. So it largely comes down to what you ""feel"" is right. Some fonts are used especially often for professional purposes - for example. Helvetica is good for signalizing timelessness and stability, Gotham has a more modern feel and is probably one of the most overused fonts nowadays, and Trajan (based on Roman inscriptions) is especially used for movie posters. Here is a list of most commonly used fonts by professionals. This site contains a lot of helpful information about 100 best typefaces of all times. Here and here are posts by Graham Smith which describe how a professional might choose a font for a logo.   Also, you should try to make the text look like a wordmark rather than just typesetting, for that purpose you can for example increase the tracking or the reverse, connect the letters. You should also make the text unified with the logo in some way, giving it the same colors, style, or making the line width of the letters the same as the illustration.  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if Helvetica is the best choice here, it feels perhaps too clinical, especially in this light weight. Try a humanist sans serif maybe? I made this in Open Sans after a bit of messing around in Illustrator."

logodesign,3a2qy6,RIPGeech,9,Wed Jun 17 11:05:04 2015 UTC,"Why such contrast between your logomark and the type? There should be balance, the way it's set up now makes your name look insignificant in comparison to the symbol. Aside from that, i think the symbol itself is too vague to really become memorable. The way you've presented it, with the gradients, shading, and negative space makes it look really pretty and all, but if you were just to have it there in plain black on white I guarantee the impact wouldn't be there."
logodesign,3a2qy6,ABSXLVTE,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"I will be mainly using logo without the type, but if not, I will try to reduce the contrast.

logodesign,3a368o,ogcm,4,Tue Jun 16 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"To me it reads UTI, not sure how well that sits with you. Another point is that I don't think forcing a letter to fit within others is the best approach. If there was a natural negative space that made the shape of the ""i"" then that'd be real cool. But here you've kind of just laid the ""i"" down on top of the other two letters and it's created a lack of hierarchy and introduced a complexity that you don't necessarily need. Keep working at it, try playing around with different type, don't restrain yourself with just one idea, work on a bunch of small quick ones and then break them down into the basic concepts, techniques, and atrributes that you like and then bring them to fruition in a number of bigger ideas. Haven't really given much advice before, hope a 4th year graphic design student can lend some insight. Good luck, feel free to ask any questions!"
logodesign,3a368o,Lobstrich,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:52:26 2015 UTC,"Agree with this person - also, your logo should work on a flat colour, ditch the background and the drop shadow and try and make it work on both black and white, reversing the main colours if needed."

Sometimes you actually do need to demonstrate what someone is saying because your critiques can be a little confusing in a descriptive manner.   you need to extend the toilet paper a little more to make it clearer.   But really? The advice was so obvious that there could be no mistake about it. Nobody misinterpreted what was meant by this critique, you just had to do a visual to demonstrate. A lot of other people are even worse going and taking their own interpretation of how the logo should look. It's a critique of an existing logo, not a free-for-all hack job. It's sort of insulting that this community thinks it's okay to take someone's logo all the time and redesign it as if the designer actually wants them to do that."

A little work on cleaning / properly aligning the ovals for the tp roll / inner tube, as well as making sure the perspective is accurate on the ""depth"" of the object and you should be good.  Finding the perfect font to pair as the word mark should be fun  edit: as mentioned in other comments, a perforation on the overhanging tp could look great - its placement will be pretty important though, as you don't want the TP squares to look rectangular, and you don't want to have an awkward dashed line near the top of the logo.

logodesign,39y8w1,KeenanTheBarbarian,3,Mon Jun 15 20:18:14 2015 UTC,The outer circle appears to be skewed while the inner circle was not which gives the appearance of the entire thing being wobbly.

logodesign,39y8w1,thewarehouse,4,Mon Jun 15 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"By uneven I mean the weight of it is off. There's something not quite balanced compositionally about it, but also because some of the distortion on the shapes gives a weird feeling of motion to the back and right."

logodesign,39zvl0,kvagnier,5,Tue Jun 16 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"Hello there, fellow student here!  Not bad overall, but I think there's a couple of things that would improve your work quite easily.  First I think you'll get problems in print and small scales in general with about half of your logos because they are too detailed / thin lined / too packed to work properly in small scales.  I would strongly recommend you print them out every hour or so on a cheap laser or inkjet while working on them, this is probably the most important thing I end up writing down :). Always print everything all the time to check ""the real life feel"". Obviously you don't need to print out a website, for logo stuff it's nevertheless super helpful.  You should have a closer look at your typographie. Especially Kasey's Logo doesn't seem to be kerned at all and most of your sublines are a little generic in their ""lets space that to the same width as my headline"" look.   Also you could try experimenting with different positionings in future logos, it doesn't have to be centred.  Here and there I would like to see a stronger focus on the type instead of the symbol (Fubar – top heavy), some of your logos don't feel quite right from the scale of typo + logo.  Not trying to be a downer or something, I just like to be nitpicky because I think that's the way to learn stuff :)"
logodesign,39zvl0,JVattic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:57:52 2015 UTC,"First of all, Thank you very much for the well thought-out response! Secondly, I encourage any and all criticism as it will indeed only help me in the long run and there is almost always something that could be done for improvement. That is why I believe critiques are so important. It's difficult to see flaws when you've been staring at the same thing for hours/days. You have actually mentioned a few things that I had overlooked and will, in turn, keep a close eye on in the future. Once more, I appreciate the comments!"

logodesign,39z0nx,SecondHandWatch,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea, but the execution should be better. For starters, change the weight fo the ""buttondown"" word. It doesn't match the symbol or anything, really. Preferably, it should be the same weight as the other word - separating them by different colors (the two used in the logo) should be enough. Also, the weight of the strokes connecting the buttons, the ones surrounding them, and diameter of the holes seem to be all different. Try to give the logo some visual unity by making these elements more similar to each other. The letters should be kerned more precisely, perhaps the tracking should be decreased. I'm also not sure the spacing of the elements is right - it is perhaps wrong that the distance between the buttons is bigger than the distance between the symbol and the text - and shouldn't the ""arrow"" point towards the text, rather than away from it?"

They should've probably tied the not-Cubs C into the new logo somehow to at least make it cohesive.

I don't think many of these are very eye-catching per se, besides Coca-Cola's because of the unique text and red background.  I also don't think it's a factor of being around for so long, but rather the products they produce are so popular and well known that people are forced to see these logos on a regular basis, so it just becomes ingrained in their minds.  I think a lot of these could be completely different, but would still be just as recognizable for this reason."
logodesign,39v7mh,fivemanship,2,Mon Jun 15 04:42:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people don't really think about logos when they see them every day. With older logos, we don't translate the logo to the company, to our brain they're the same thing."

logodesign,39v7mh,ButThatWasntThere,2,Mon Jun 15 04:32:32 2015 UTC,"I've done a few logos, and none of them were text-only.  I've always thought text-only logos are a missed opportunity, even more so as everything goes digital and the reality of that world is that a brand identity must at some point fit into a square.  A graphic element, even one that doesn't stand alone, is more recognizable, more expressive, more easily internationalized, and therefore easier to establish than a word-mark.  What can be done as a graphic is nearly limitless, however applying the same couture to text leaves it flawed or broken more often than not.  Established companies show their longevity, risk aversion, and/or trustworthiness by sticking with, or moving to, a text-only centerpiece for their brand.  New companies may have any number of reasons for starting with just text, but I'd be willing to bet a desire to portray those qualities, even aspirationally, is part of it."

I might realign the striping or drop it altogether, it should all match or clearly be different.  The bottom logo is really tricky. While the type choice is daring ""Rambo"" looks like ""Bambo""... A couple of reasons for this are the patterns and the shadows. Imo, all too busy on or around typography... They make it really tricky to read this heavily stylized type face, and when it gets displayed size as it just won't be easily legible because of the patterns and shadows. Pick one or the other, simplify.  Further, they will have a hard time branding that bottom logo across all types of media consistently, which (imo) is key for startups.  For next time (if you get that chance) :   Adjust the proportions of Rambo and Dolphin to be closer in size or equal... It is going to be really tough to read Rambo once it's shrunken down, specially in the selected type face.  Speaking of type face, get a new type face, something similar, but you need better definition between the B and R.  Dolphin fin doesn't feel like it's the right size, arc or direction.  It's a good concept, they got what they paid for and you got some great experience.. Good work!"

logodesign,39tk3y,InspiredRichard,2,Sun Jun 14 22:21:42 2015 UTC,"Strip out the detail. The simpler this logo is the better. All of the detail makes the piece more complex, which takes away from it's effectiveness.  I would strip it back to a rectangle with the initials in and the antenna on the top, or even try to shape the initials in such a way that they resemble a rectangle enough.  Here is my five miniute draft to illustrate the point. See how it still resmebles a TV, even with the detail stripped away? The one without the rectangle would need quite a bit more work to make it right, but I think the point I am making is seen here.  EDIT:  Here is an additional idea I just had come to me  If you're going to downvote me I'd be keen to discuss what it is you disagree with"

logodesign,39tk3y,salutationsrachel,2,Mon Jun 15 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"All of the detail makes the piece more complex, which takes away from it's effectiveness.   Can you explain that to me? I'm genuinely curious.   Sure. Simplicity makes a logo design easily recognizable, versatile and memorable.  One of the ways to test if a logo is easily recognisable, people should be able to recall it. The more complex it is, the harder it is to recall.   To be versatile it needs to be able to work in lots of different but appropriate situations, so does it work on a business card? a pen? a website? the side of a car? a billboard? Does it scale up and down in size and remain as effective?   Does it work in greyscale as well as colour? The reason this is important is because it costs more to print in colour than in black and white and there may be some situations where you want to just use the mark in white or black or a single colour.  If people can redraw your logo it shows that they have come to remember it - your logo is so powerful that it has left an imprint in the mind of the user. Of course, repeated exposure will have some kind of effect in this way, but a simpler logo will be remembered much more easily. To test this out, try drawing the logos of some famous brands. Exactly draw out the Nike and Mcdonalds logo. Now exactly draw out the Starbucks or the Heineken logo.  The simpler logos (Nike and Mcdonalds) are much easier to redraw because they are simpler and thus easier to exactly remember.   I honestly feel like if it's not actually a television, it'll confuse people as to what exactly it's supposed to be. A box with a screen and antennae is a dead give away. But, just letters with antennae with letters, might confuse people a bit into thinking it's an alien.   How many well known logos that you know of are an exact representation of the thing they are symbolising? Think about the Apple logo. It is the shape of a 'perfect' apple with a bite out of. It doesn't hold any detail beyond the outline of the shape it represents.   Paul Rand, states that    “a logo is a flag, a signature, an escutcheon, a street sign. A logo does not sell (directly), it identifies. A logo is rarely a description of a business. A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it represents is more important than what it looks like. The subject matter of a logo can be almost anything.”   Your logo just needs to symbolise what you are trying to achieve, rather than being super-detailed. When you think of your logo as a flag or street sign it helps to understand how simply it needs to communicate.  Now my draft ideas were far from the finished article. They were meant to help you see that a simplification of the idea will help to refine your work into something more effective and usable. I am sure that you could take some inspiration with what I have done and use it to think about your own work.  I don't think the mark I created looks like an alien (no obvious markings of a face, and aliens are often portrayed as white or green), but you could do a few small things to enhance the appearance of it being a tv like so.  Have a think about how you can clearly display a TV in as simple a way as possible and then how you can incorporate your initials in there. Better still, consider if you actually need all of these things to achieve the best possible result. Can you communicate the message and meaning without using the initials? When you think about effective logos, how many use initials?"

Kerning adjusts the space between individual letter forms, while tracking (letter-spacing) adjusts spacing uniformly over a range of characters.  In a well-kerned font, the two-dimensional blank spaces between each pair of characters all have a visually similar area.  The related term kern denotes a part of a type letter that overhangs the edge of the type block.

This is the black and white version, and here it is against a colored background (a very neutral one this time).  Feedback adressed:   Kerning/balance : increased W-A space and decreased A-L-A spacing Handlebar in A was not centered : now it is. font for tagline changed and made smaller overall (tagline itself will probably change, so I'm not putting too much effort in there until it is confirmed) increased thinkness of the handlebars for A (now slightly thicker than the diagonal lines - same as L) Background to busy: changed to neutral background Some read it as WALP : Cutoff for last A moved a bit further, now it cuts below the handlebar.   Feedback not adressed:   Cutoffs not smooth or needs more curves: The client really loved the concept (with a double exclamation point, which he normally doesn't do) so I'm going to stick with it. Also, we were looking for a very linear, modern and ""clean"" logo. (I don't know how to translate the words he used :-) ), which I think it all does well. No backstory. I could make up something about how it represents a no-nonsense, clean and light solution, with as little waste as possible. The cutoffs also make the logo very precise and to the point. The could W represent a light wave and the A's could be beams of light :-P But my client isn't looking for anything like that.

The Captain America graphic is especially hard to read because the front text competes with the text behind. My mind couldn't really decide which one to focus on for the first half-second.  The viewer is always going to have a context about how the title should be read if they've read anything before. A culture that reads left to right is going to have a different initial pull than a culture that reads right to left or top to bottom. The context for front to back titles would be the way the titles are most commonly presented; whether designers usually intend for the text to be read front to back or back to front. I don't have any evidence but I would assume that these titles are most often presented with the intention to be read front to back. This is true, at least, for your two examples.  It might be a good idea to include an example where the larger text behind is meant to be read first. I think including two examples that are meant to be read front to back skew people's perceptions. It is entirely plausible that your brain actually does read the larger text behind first and the smaller front text second but then tells you that you perceived the front text first only in hindsight, after you've processed both."

Interestingly enough, the first example I gave isn't supposed to be read front to back - it's actually read as ""3 Bahadur"", and is the reason why this whole argument started in the first place. We were trying to figure out whether or not this was a design error on their part.  I agree with you on the context part, I should probably rephrase my intention.

Have you noticed if placing the hierarchy of words from back to front is common in Pakistan or is ""3 Bahadur"" an anomaly?  There are some schools of design and technical writing that implement pretty advanced usability tests that determine how people process visual information and I think the results in those studies eventually trickle down to the everyday designer but for most designers, these decisions are made mostly according to convention--what the majority of other designers are doing at any given time regardless of the actual science behind it."

Right now it's justified to the right and the straight line (below the top point) aligns with the top of the text. I like how it sticks out. Is that weird design?"
logodesign,39ktqp,G-Solutions,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"On second thoughts the cross bar of the star aligning with the top of the letters works well, but it's strangely aligned with the letter below, looks like it's falling to the left.  Also as an additional point, that coffee bean and cup in the middle of it is way too finely detailed. If you shrink this down to a smaller size as it will be used, it'll be an unrecognisable mess in my opinion."

Also, I imagine your dad will be in the market for vehicle graphics and possibly signage along with many other collateral materials, the vector format will be handy when cutting decals for graphics and signage. One way you could get the effect you're going for would be to take the background woodgrain image into AI and select it and auto-trace it. The trace dialog box will allow you to preview the results while adjusting thresholds until you get the right positive/negative space balance. If that method falls short try looking for another image of woodgrain with more light to dark contrast and repeat the trace method or you could just pull out the trusty vector pen tool and manually trace the woodgrain to your little heart's content :) Good luck!

If this tree gets printed on bad printers or fax machines the little space inside the tree may look like printing errors...MAYBE. Try it out. If so just make it solid and look if it still works as a tree. There´s a tiny bit of too much space between the ""R"" and ""O"" for my taste - a bit (micro)kerning would help but that is just a small detail in your case. hope that helps (no native speaker)"

To me it looks like we are moving into trends that have ever increasing complexity. Complexity generally makes for less memorable and less usable logo pieces.  If I am designing something I very rarely deliberately consider design trends, and try to start by examining the needs of the client. If I design something that falls into a current trend it isn't because I am looking to do so, but because it seems to fit the identity of the business.   I suppose the reason that I tend to ignore trends in my work is because trends come and go and I want my mark to be timeless rather than dated."

A few amateur opinions : I reckon remove the tail on the 'm' and I think the highlights on the text make it harder to read, also the kerning around the 'm'  looks a bit off, give it more space. In general and especially with logos, less is more. You want less (read one or two) colours and a consistent level of detail so it displays well at different sizes, on different mediums and in black and white. Try make the soldier a single colour silhouette (might dodge copyright violation if you do) and lose the gradient on the explosion. Your friend may want to print this on a t-shirt in which case the soldier would be very hard to make out. Also, you could move the explosion to the other side so it dots the 'i'  in ninja, and flip the direction of the soldier so it follows the direction of the letter angle. I like the font and the idea is great, I'm very new to this so would love someone more experienced to weigh in."

The top line is very spread out and the bottom one is very tight; they clash. Pick one style and stick with it. I'd even think of dropping the word ""translations"" altogether.  Next, the whole thing feels very cluttered. It feels like you're cramming too much into the double-sided ""T"" element. I like the element in general and I think you're on the right track with it. Keep working with it. There's just no ""breathing room"" between the text and the element. Give your text room to breathe, and that might mean moving the text outside of the element.  Your element is very heavy/thick and your text is thin, that clashes, too. If you want to keep your text inside the ""T"" bracket thingy, make them work together; right now they're fighting against each other weight-wise and it doesn't feel like your design is consistent.  I'm not familiar with the non-English writing, so it's difficult for me to gauge what looks right, but it should mirror whatever you do with the English text.

logodesign,39dnbb,Izanasz,3,Fri Jun 12 03:21:33 2015 UTC,(Paraphrasing) some logos are born great; some logos achieve greatness; and some logos have greatness thrust upon them.  NASA's classic logo steps up and punches your great logo in the face with its awesomeness.  Lately I've been looking at the old Golden State Warriors logo.  It has this crazy (I have to assume) hand-drawn typeface  But it's still awesome.

Where's all the people complaining that the colors are super retro? I don't know if I'm on-board with the muddy yellow or tomato red. The ""l"" of ""buffalo"" sticking out of the shape when the rest of the letters are contained (in the first view) seems weird to me. Also I'm not sure I get the ""point"" of it....a stack of books?"
logodesign,39cm50,thewarehouse,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"The rectangles signify both books and digital media. If you meant the L in regional and not buffalo, I actually completely agree with you. I wasn't part of the team to decide on the logo though, but I worked on the website design.  We do have a greyscale and one colour versions of the design for when CMYK or SPOT can't reproduce. The colour choices are meant to be bold and bright, I don't really see muddy or retro."
logodesign,39cm50,JackHasaKeyboard,2,Thu Jun 11 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"It looks moderately nice but it makes no sense on a technical level.  It's text in the foreground of three transparent rectangles. It's not so much a logo as an effect in Photoshop.   It's not unique or instantly recognizable. It entails nothing, unless the rectangles are supposed to be books. It not only fails at trying to be trendy but is completely vapid beyond looking trendy. This would have looked dated 5 years ago and it's going to look very dated in 10 years. It's not widely applicable or extensible, it's the exact opposite. One of the cardinal rules of designing a logo is to put it through a stress test that highlights its weaknesses, and looking at it throws up all kinds of red flags. If you put it on the side of a pen its illegible, if you put it on the side of a building it's going to look dirty extremely quickly, it physically can't work as signage because there's no negative space (unless you were to remove all the color, at which point the ""stack of books"" wouldn't look like anything and the color would be gone removing the only interesting or redeeming attributes). The way it looks is not only unassuming of a library but of the Wood Buffalo area, Wood Buffalo is a very industrious place and the design scene is completely and totally divorced from this.   I'd be fascinated to hear why this was considered viable."
logodesign,39cm50,JackHasaKeyboard,2,Thu Jun 11 23:49:42 2015 UTC,"5 - I'm going to answer this one first. You're very obviously not from Fort McMurray/Wood Buffalo if you think that. 1 - I think it's instantly recognizable. Our entire new design is based off the rectangles, as you can see on our website and FB page. I also haven't personally seen any other logos like it, please share some. 2 - Yes, they do entail books and digital media. Even if most people don't recognize that, it's still there. Typographic logos do still exist, not everything has to mean something. 3 - That's personal opinion. If you showed me some logos that looked like this and were dated 5 years ago I might agree with you. 4 - I uploaded what the new business cards and name tags look like here and the new library cards here. The scanner lightened the colours on the business cards, but you can still see clearly that it works on print just as well as web. We do actually have pens and jackets, but I don't have a picture of those. I don't really understand what you mean by it not working on signage, you'll have to clarify that. Also showing that you're not from here, we don't have an outside wall to put the logo on, so no chance of it getting dirty."
logodesign,39cm50,JackHasaKeyboard,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"5 - I live in Fort McMurray. I don't know where to begin with the ""industrial"" thing, Fort McMurray is known for one thing and that's for being industrious. It's a city built around the oilsands.  You want to meet up? I'm completely divorced from the design scene in this area, maybe we could talk and bounce ideas off eachother. I'm just surprised to run into a local here. 1 - It's not, if we weren't having this conversation I would have already forgotten about it. 2 - So there is some kind of symbolic representation there. However:   a - Rectangles are extremely ubiquitous.  b - That's highly contrived, I had to have the innuendo explained to me before it came into context. 3 - What's ""hip"" now is flat design and bright, vibrant colors. It's akin to a logo from the 80s with embossed metallic text and pink triangles. Maybe not inherently bad, but in this case I strongly feel it's to a disadvantage. If something is vapid beyond being hip, then taking away it's hipness not only means it's worthless but that this is inevitable.  The works of Paul Rand are a relatively good example of logos that have qualities you can appreciate regardless of time period. 4 - Yes, it works on business cards and jackets but it immediately begins to sliptest when you consider pretty much everything else. If you try superimpose it on something else it's either going to block the entire image or need to be given a stroke (like you did) that just makes it look flaky and hard to read, I'd have to see the pen to see what it would look like but I can next to guarantee the logo is going to be warped and impossible to make out, if you try to advertise it on a billboard it's going to look dirty extremely quickly.   we don't have an outside wall to put the logo on   That's ultimately irrelevant, this is what being forward-thinking is and taking into account extensibality. There's a very realistic chance the library will want to do some kind of advertising like I described, perhaps in the near future.   I don't really understand what you mean by it not working on signage   I was referring to 3D signage that isn't just a flat image. I suppose you could make all the books different colors, but that's not something you should have to resort to. What if they want to make it out of metal?  I live in Fort McMurray, I haven't seen the library you're referring to though."
logodesign,39cm50,JackHasaKeyboard,-1,Fri Jun 12 05:49:25 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression now that you think I made this, but I very much didn't. I'm also much more inclined to agree with the design choices of a successful and internationally recognized design agency over a redditor.  You might live in Fort McMurray, but I highly doubt it's been long, and I'm guessing you're just another site worker. I could be totally wrong on these counts though. For the record I've lived here for 11 years, and even though the economy is based off the oil sands, the city is not. We're more than just a mining town.  1, 2 , and 3 all seem to stem from personal opinions of yours. You could easily forget or not like the design, but that doesn't mean everyone will. I know ~50 people offhand already who disagree with you. You also didn't share any examples of old or similar logos. In my opinion, some of the logos by Paul Rand are good, but most just seem boring and uninspired.  Maybe the book thing is a bit hard to get, I never said everyone would get it right away, but that doesn't mean it's not there.  I like how you're guessing what the library is going to do in the future when you didn't even know there was one, compared to someone who works there."
logodesign,39cm50,Silvalogs,0,Fri Jun 12 08:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression now that you think I made this   I inferred it when you said ""Our new design"", yeah.   I'm also much more inclined to agree with the design choices of a successful and internationally recognized design agency    That's not what inclined means. The logo is not automatically lended more merit because it's from a successful company. You're a redditor too, sir. Having a reddit account is not a nullification of your graphic design capabilities, even if it were you'd be being a hypocrite.    You might live in Fort McMurray, but I highly doubt it's been long   You don't need to physically live in Fort McMurray / the Wood Buffalo area to say that the area is industrial. Anyone with a passing interest in reality will tell you the same thing.  But I've been there for roughly 7 years.   We're more than just a mining town.   I didn't say that Fort McMurray consisted of nothing but industrialization, I said it was disproportionate and that it influenced the town's aesthetics.  And it does. The vast majority branding (and there's plenty of branding) here is blue-collar, robust and industrial.   1, 2 , and 3 all seem to stem from personal opinions of yours   Much of what I said was objective. It's objective that the design scene in this day and age is inclined towards flat design and bright, vibrant colors. It stands to reason whether this is to a disadvantage, I'm saying yes.   You could easily forget or not like the design, but that doesn't mean everyone will.   Sure, but it's almost definitely disproportionate. A library is a tool for the general public and this is far too hip and trendy to be applicable to the average citizen. Consider a library in the 80s with embossed metallic text and pink triangles and how it shows its tack to everyone except the local teenagers.   You also didn't share any examples of old or similar logos.    Paul Rand was the example of logos with qualities that do a better job transcending time period. I actually assumed that the Warner Bros logo was a new redesign the first time I saw it.  They may look slightly stale, but that's what logos often have to be. I'd like to live in an ideal world where everything can look like the Firefox logo in that it's big, bold and interesting but that's not the case. Logos are a ubiquitously used symbol used to represent a company and in this case it's an immediate sliptest in virtually every regard.   Maybe the book thing is a bit hard to get, I never said everyone would get it right away, but that doesn't mean it's not there.   It's hard to get in the worst way. It's not unassuming because there's some kind of innuendo, it just does a poor job announcing itself. I could have looked at a dozen times and not have begin to think that it was supposed to be a pile of books.   I like how you're guessing what the library is going to do in the future when you didn't even know there was one, compared to someone who works there.   To say that you don't actually have a wall to advertise the logo on is to completely miss the point. There's a very realistic possibility that the library will want to advertise themselves on some large, flat surface at some point in the future. Even if they know as an absolute that this will never happen, it's got implications beyond that and the lack of applicability is negligent."

So anyway, the design is laid out well, but looks a little generic and kind of makes me think of beers like Genesee. I have no idea what sort of vibe you're aiming for (craft, generic, import, domestic, etc) so it's kind of hard to judge the design because each of those categories has a pretty different design language commonly associated with it.  If you'd be willing to give some background information, that would make it easier for people to guide you."

The fine print/ingredients/etc would be better off underneath the whole thing in the red area, not inside the black circle.   Just my two cents."

What critique I can offer right off the bat is that your text kerning is inconsistent and the overall tracking is too tight. When I scale this down the letters all bleed together and not in an aesthetic way, it just affects legibility. Also, the weight of the strokes on your symbol competes maybe too strongly with the text for hierarchy. I also don't care for the gradient and the darker muddled blue color fill in the symbol makes this feel a little dull and uninteresting. I would be thinking about more contrast and better spacing."

Maybe consider either making the f as wide as the rest of them. or shortening the P. Maybe I'm being picky, but looking at it it just seemed a little uneven to me. You can see the bottom of the P isn't flush with the other letters. with this block design style i would also try to get the spacing inside the P and between the two lines on the F to be the same.

It might look pretty good on a white background.  In another comment you mentioned that you thought the type looked too bubbly. I think you might mean that it's too closely based on circular forms and if that's the case, you may consider talking to your designer about using a less ""geometric"" font for it which this one very much is. You may also talk to them about using a slightly lighter weighted font.

logodesign,39azqn,MrCorwyn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"when you're designing a logo you should think about it working at all sizes, from something huge on the side of a building to something small on a business card.  the grey copy underneath the GFPS looks too close since the letters are all running into one another, and once you shrink that down it real small it may all look like a blob.  you should tell him to try a less bold font for that part of the lockup."
logodesign,39azqn,witchrist,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:48:40 2015 UTC,Huge improvement. I really like it.   The gradient in the globe is unnecessary though. I also think it might look better if the subtitle was a lighter weight

logodesign,39azqn,nicetriangle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mostly agree with that sentiment but especially for $1000 I think it's totally fair for the client to interject even if they don't have the best vocabulary to do so. I just think what's happened here is they've tried to talk to the designer and maybe got some jargony responses in reply and they just want to now bounce it off a fresh audience that isn't invested in the process which isn't a horrible thing to do.  On a side note I thought this might have been a squished gotham black but if it is, it's been modified a little.  I think having the designer provide some font options for OP to pick is a pretty solid idea and I've definitely done that with clients before when they couldn't explain what they wanted but had a specific idea in mind."

I like the typography selection, however, I don't know if I'd make the ""A GOOD"" most prominent... I'd perhaps keep all the type the same style and put the emphasis on ""CLEAN FIGHT"" by displaying ""A GOOD"" in red.   Fair play in boxing = Clean Fight, right?"
logodesign,398e2p,JaquesNoir,4,Wed Jun 10 00:52:05 2015 UTC,"The (primitive) idea was to symbolize cleaniness by thinning up the ""clean"" word, while linking the word ""fight"" to the red in the boxing glove (since you fight with gloves). To be honest, I simply didn't know that putting ""a good"" in white makes it most prominent (I guess it's because of the contrast with black). However, now I think the weight change is an unnecessary complication. The words are separated by weight, color, and spacing (because of the ""a"" which complicates things), that's too much.  Here's the version after applying your suggestions, thanks: http://i.imgur.com/FpZZZmo.jpg"
logodesign,398e2p,JaquesNoir,2,Wed Jun 10 01:14:20 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...I like the direction.. I don't know about the colour on the type now... You could try reversing it ""clean fight"" in red.  On the other hand you could stack the type left or right with ""a good"" on top' ""clean"" in the centre and ""fight"" on the bottom. They can be the same size as the logo.

logodesign,398e2p,PleaseNinja,3,Wed Jun 10 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"I love the idea.  It's a ubiquitous symbol thanks to facebook too.  From an art perspective, the current vertical angle of the thumb makes either the wrist look as if it is bent awkwardly, or the fingers look stretched out trying to touch the wrist.  This thumb angle would be appropriate for a bit of foreshortening (the punch towards the viewer) but with the wrist very definitely coming from the left this looks inconsistent.  Have a look at some photos of real hands doing thumbs up, or boxing gloves.  You'll see the angle of the thumb is gentler (about 45 degrees from the wrist) as well as where the fingers end - usually curling only into the palm of the hand, or base of the thumb, rather than the wrist."
logodesign,398e2p,vector_luver,6,Wed Jun 10 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"Love the design. Visually simple, uses a common gesture to convey a positive idea.  From far away it might be hard to tell its a boxing glove. Maybe add laces to the wrist area?"
logodesign,398e2p,GDMFusername,2,Wed Jun 10 00:20:48 2015 UTC,"Laces would be on the other side of the glove. If he puts laces here he'd have to draw the finger of the glove folded in which would probably muddy it up. I think you are definitly on the right track with this logo.

logodesign,398e2p,InspiredRichard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with turning the glove the other way, so that it's immediately obvious that it's a boxing glove and it has some of the natural anatomical shape that would make the 'thumbs-up' stand out.  It sort of looks like candy or a balloon.  I get what you mean by muddying it up, but that is in the context of the current design, which to me is a bit cartoony for what it is and what it stands for."

logodesign,399xyd,Marm8,3,Wed Jun 10 08:52:58 2015 UTC,"the text is a bit small, so it will be difficult to read from further away or if the logo is small, and the same goes for the circle surrounding it. Also, as good as it looks that way, try to imagine it without the neon effect. A good logo should still look kind of good in plain black over a white surface, and in your case the circle would probably look weird because of the thin lines.  Things I would change:   Split the text in two, put 2 words above and 2 below the monkey and make the text size way bigger. Either merge the two circles into one or at least make the lines thicker so that it would still look good without the neon effect. Redo it all in some vector-graphics program to avoid pixelation."
logodesign,399xyd,DarkWiiPlayer,3,Wed Jun 10 12:42:42 2015 UTC,"I like the whole cheesy neon bar look. I'd say make those circles in the background the same width as the rest of your neon lines. A more custom looking monkey would help a lot too; perhaps sipping from a margarita glass, which you could use separate colors for. To be honest, I don't like the acronym. The logo should be able to stand out on it's own and the name is fun and unique and shouldn't be hidden. Try placing the words Punch Drunk and Monkey Club above and below the logo respectively.

logodesign,398t0a,ButThatWasntThere,2,Wed Jun 10 11:31:14 2015 UTC,"The only think I can say that would help it appear less oily would be to make it the natural color of coffee. That would require your logo to rely on always being printed or displayed on a medium that utilizes color. So your logo would somewhat fail when printed on black/white, even if you have no control of that. If I were designing it I personally would scrap the drop.  But for some companies it's worth keeping some unfortunate elements in their logo so they can better convey a message. Their brand guidelines require they always print on color and the logo is never displayed in black/white for example. Ultimately it's your choice on how you want your logo to be viewed, you control your brand and you dictate your design philosophy."

If it makes any difference, I made all the original linework in Rhino, a NURBS based modeling program, so the geometry is ""pure"". A circle in there is a true circle, where every point is equidistant from the center point, regardless of the number of control points.

Try a wave instead of a fold in the flag.   Add color, coffee related companies have the luxury of doing all sorts of things with their identity. Be creative!  Your fonts are mid-19th century bold block fonts. I'd find something more suited for the colonial era. The vibe I get is Texas Revolution as it stands. There are plenty of good examples of revolutionary flags (think the snake from early in the Revolutionary War) that you can play off.  More on concept, what makes your roaster so revolutionary? If it's something unique you may want to convey it, whether subliminally or directly, in the logo itself. Don't think that just because your company is generally revolutionary in your mind that it will be received as anything more than wishful thinking by people on the outside unless it is based on something truly notable or unique.  Edit: Try using the Boston Tea Party as a way to play on the Revolutionary idea. They dressed as Native Americans, dumped tea, the English put stamps on all imports, etc. Americans went through a phase of decreased tea drinking at that time. There are all sorts of historical stories that can support your Revolutionary Roaster brand."

logodesign,392pi9,kevinesque,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:19:59 2015 UTC,"Of those designs, the second works best for me. However, at a higher level, I'm concerned about the star. Unless you're willing to invite the association with communism, it doesn't seem like an apt choice. And, even if you are, it would certainly detract from the emphasis on the American Revolution. You might consider stylized versions of other Revolution-era flags like the Gadsden or the ``join-or-die'' snake. Unfortunately, those too might invite associations you wish to avoid, albeit this time with contemporary conservative, not leftist, movements. But perhaps not. What about a 13-star circle?  Looking back again, a font similar to #4 now strikes me as something to play around with more. I still prefer the vertical orientation of the flag pole, though. I guess I'm thinking that either the flag should be of that era or the typeface should evoke it, but not both."

A few thoughts: I think you can simplify the design by keeping the tools and text but removing the shapes housing them. Additionally, the ampersand is concealing too much of other words. I'd suggest reducing the stroke or placing the ampersand to the left of craft. Good work."
logodesign,38xq58,cjolives,3,Sun Jun 7 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. My initial concept was actually just the tools with the text, but I felt like experimenting, and now I think I might go back to it then. :)"
logodesign,38xq58,BroadShoulderedBeast,4,Sun Jun 7 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"I like the color palette of the shape holding the main elements, but it might do without the shape like the others have said. I think the detail of the saw, hammer, and brush are simplistic yet detailed and that's good. This isn't going to be on trucks and business cards, it's for a blog, so it doesn't have to conform to the usual need to be able to be transferred to other surfaces and still look nice. It's just the chisel is more detailed than the others, either because of the complexity of the shape or something else.  Maybe space out the chisel and saw and point the paint brush down so it leads the eye easier to the text with its heavy black color, which is a nice font choice, I think.   Instead of an ampersand, you might try the look of a 1-3pt stroke horizontal rule between the words of the same color as the ampersand sign. I doubt it looks nice but maybe. Or it could be a bolder stroke with the word ""and"" of a contrasting shade in it. The horizontal rule could be the same color as the fill in the ribbon with the text, and the word ""and"" the same color as the ampersand sign."

logodesign,38xq58,maahhkus,3,Sun Jun 7 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"I really like the style. As /u/BroadShoulderBeast said, try the brush pointing down. I think it would also help to exaggerate the shadow on the brush to help it read visually as being behind the other tools.    I'm not sure about the jagged edge of the shadow on the hammer handle. It's just noticeable enough for me to wonder if it is an artefact of aliasing.    With regard to the ampersand, I'm not a fan of the stroke cutting out the other letters. My suggestion is to either:     Increase line spacing between Design and Craft, reduce size of ampersand, and add a thin horizontal line on either side of the ampersand.   Rather than using a stroke, draw a circle behind the ampersand for a cleaner cutout. As it stands, the complex cutout of the 'I' in particular is needlessly detailed.   Some combination of the above.     As others have said, the background shape elements may be unnecessary. It really depends on the context. Try mocking it up on the blog header to see if it needs to be framed. The grey tones in the tools would have more clarity on a white background, and I would always favour less elements over more elements if they both looked good.    One more suggestion: try minimising the colour palette. For example, the ampersand could match the paintbrush, while Design and Craft could match the hammer handle.    Keep up the great work!"

As for the thin line, when I get rid of it the look of the logo becomes unbalanced; maybe try replacing it with the machine-belt look of the short arm of that triangle or a thick line like the rest of the logo.

logodesign,38oo0e,_SGP_,18,Fri Jun 5 16:11:06 2015 UTC,I'm just one guy but I've got one honest opinion and that's that this looks a little dated already. I don't know what your brand style is or who you're targeting but I feel like this is the logo of someone who's been in business 20 years or so.   My intention isn't to sound harsh but just to provide an alternative viewpoint
logodesign,38oo0e,ForeverJung,5,Fri Jun 5 17:21:54 2015 UTC,"No that's great, thanks! I need this kind of feedback, it's been a while since I've done any blind graphic design like this, and I think I agree, I need to make it more simple somehow.. and remove a lot of the color.   What do you think of the alternate version I posted in my other comment?"
logodesign,38oo0e,ForeverJung,5,Fri Jun 5 17:31:21 2015 UTC,So here's what stands out to me. The font itself feels dated and so does the color palette. That's what's triggering that feeling for me. It's not the design in and of itself
logodesign,38oo0e,JaquesNoir,5,Fri Jun 5 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"Suck is a harsh word... It could be so much better. The colours are great, watch those gradients, hard to consistently reproduce in various print and web formats.  Why not work with a pro? ... Why not approach a skilled graphic designer?"
logodesign,38oo0e,JaquesNoir,4,Fri Jun 5 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm OK, It's been a while since I've worked in print and design, and you're absolutely right, I think I should stick to just a few colours. Gradients seem to be a thing of the past now too!   The short answer is I'm poor! I've quit my job to pursue my dream, and it may be a stupid decision but I'm tired of getting out of bed and dreading my life!   So yeah, at the moment I need to try and get more clients to keep me eating before I spend money on design! Although I'd be happy to trade skills for skills, but I'm unsure a digital designer would benefit from a promotional video/photo session!"
logodesign,38oo0e,Squebeb,0,Fri Jun 5 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"The short answer is I'm poor! I've quit my job to pursue my dream, and it may be a stupid decision but I'm tired of getting out of bed and dreading my life!    Understood, but this logo is going to be the first thing people see, it's the face of your business... Like the clothing you wear, you should be choosey about your image. This matters.   So yeah, at the moment I need to try and get more clients to keep me eating before I spend money on design! Although I'd be happy to trade skills for skills, but I'm unsure a digital designer would benefit from a promotional video/photo session!    ... Why look for a digital designer... ? Look for a graphic designer in your area who specializes in packaging... They could always use your expertise for their promotional imagery.  You need a basic logo/wordmark... It shouldn't cost more than $1000... $500 to $1000."
logodesign,38oo0e,Squebeb,5,Fri Jun 5 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going self employed to do photography and videography.  I like the name, as I live in an area famous for its beaches and cliffs. - although that's totally up for debate too!   But I think perhaps the logo looks a little too girly? More like a beauty parlor than a modern media company!   The lines are supposed to represent waves, but perhaps I need to get back to the drawing board. I love some of the simplistic designs I'm seeing on here.   EDIT: Another version I made originally. But it's a weird size and the lines are too thin to show on smaller mediums such as business cards."
logodesign,38oo0e,Splazeing,4,Sat Jun 6 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"How is your logo going to be used i.e where is it going to be shown?  This one looks a lot cleaner and not as dated as the other one, but I still think there's too much going on. I'd maybe suggest getting rid of the wave lines as they don't really seem like 'part of' the logo if you know what I mean. I'd be careful using gradients as well if you're going for a simplistic logo design. Sometimes they work, but there's a danger they can make your logo look like it was designed about 15 years ago.  I quite like the circle and text though, so perhaps play around a bit with the font and colour (maybe pick a colour that's a bit more vibrant?) and see how they work just by themselves."
logodesign,38oo0e,qerplonk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to pick up on 'gradients = dated!' haha!  I think this one is a little too spaced out, so I see what you mean by not being 'part' of the logo. The one in the title was the newer one, but I didn't like that I had to remove the circle!   I think I may have to go back to the drawing board with everyone's amazing feedback and return with a totally different design!!"
logodesign,38oo0e,qerplonk,2,Fri Jun 5 16:13:38 2015 UTC,Looking forward to seeing it!
logodesign,38oo0e,thisfugginguy,2,Fri Jun 5 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"imho the lines around the text are too far away from each other. Because of that, the logo is big"
logodesign,38oo0e,thisfugginguy,3,Fri Jun 5 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"Recommend making a mind-map of words related to your service and brand and combining some of them together to come up with logo concepts.  Aperture - Wave - Play Button - Camera - Clickwheel - Beach - Seagulls - Sun - Fish.  Does photography and the beach even go together with what you're trying to do?  What kind of photography are you going to do and is there a better theme to pair it with?  What you have right now is sort of suggestive of a ""path"" or a zen garden: how can you tie that in more (or less if that's not the right message)?   Try one on the realisti spectrum, then more on the abstract.  Try separating the text from the logo.  Could you replace any other businesses' name with that logo and it would work just fine, or is your logo specific to YOUR brand?  Do a bunch of different versions to see what's feeling right and - more importantly - specific to what makes your business unique."
logodesign,38oo0e,BentAxel,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"Awesome feedback!   I'm from cornwall, so as you can see we're surrounded by the sea and beaches and we have a general laid back ""seaside"" vibe to the whole county.   My work isn't specific to the sea, as I'll just be doing promotional and events coverage. But names are hard to come up with, and I think the cornish vibe can sell! (It's where most of the country come to holiday!)   I definitely appreciate your advice here. It would be better to have a more 'relevant' logo, I'll start a sketchbook with ideas and related imagery, I'd love to have a simple abstract logo that represents the company without writing, so I think this would be a great path to take. Thank you!"
logodesign,38oo0e,BentAxel,2,Sat Jun 6 12:18:28 2015 UTC,"Great picture, your home looks beautiful.  So your challenge is:  how do you get the Cornish vibe infused into a small icon?  Obviously you can't fit it all in, but think about this photo and how it should guide the elements of your logo.   How does that affect the typography?  Is it smooth and polished like your current logo, or would it have more bumps and serifs as a nod to some of that rough craggy cliff wall or the aging brick in that cottage in the background?  Then think about what kind of colors, textures, imagery could help reflect some of that seaside vibe."
logodesign,38oo0e,pm_me_your_rockets,3,Fri Jun 5 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"Something about the name and the fact that you're a media company makes me think your brand should be a little more loose and also the tie-in to the beach makes me think it could be vintage or scripty. Here are a couple of examples of the style I'm envisioning:   https://dribbble.com/shots/2093126-Battereaz https://dribbble.com/shots/2091971-Best-In-Show https://dribbble.com/shots/2089599-Logo-Concept-2 https://dribbble.com/shots/2089168-siberia https://dribbble.com/shots/2088023-be-simple   When designing a logo it's good to also consider the overarching brand (treatment, placement, usage in print or web, secondary fonts, etc..) so I often try to use fonts that have print-ready and web-ready versions. Google Fonts has an awesome assortment of fonts for that. I think this one is kind of cool. You can highlight the text and replace it with the name of your business to try it out."
logodesign,38pybn,designed_this_way,5,Fri Jun 5 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"It's a good concept, containing the power I/O symbol and both company initials in the space of one modified & non-convoluted letterform is pretty impressive.  However, aside from appreciating the cleverness, for some reason I just don't love looking at it. Seems a bit unbalanced / like it's going to roll away - maybe has something to do with the color of the c/e"
logodesign,38pybn,orewhat,2,Fri Jun 5 22:09:51 2015 UTC,Rotating it counterclockwise might help with that.  I also feel like the strict adherence to the base circle might actually make the I part of the symbol seem too far right. Maybe some cheating of that curve could help out.
logodesign,38nfj1,Chrixphizz,4,Fri Jun 5 10:10:47 2015 UTC,First things first my friend: 3gether is a band name. Secondly i really like the logo but i'd suggest to put the name under the logo. As next: I like the left one a little bit more. Last but not least: What does the logo picture?

logodesign,38nfj1,cosmicblob,5,Fri Jun 5 11:46:24 2015 UTC,"Post the full design then, no point addressing the illustration without seeing the full logo first."
logodesign,38nfj1,AlaskaGraves,10,Fri Jun 5 12:25:11 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate the name, it will hinder your growth as a business if you are successful and want to hire other people. It is so raw for a new employee to come and work under a name that suggests they're three people working at this. Apple is not called JOBS, Facebook is not called ZUCKERBERG, and Tesla is not called MUSK, for a reason. It suggests an immediate barrier between you three and the others that work there, you are not a fashion brand. You say you smoke pot for inspiration, this is a potheads idea, self induldgent. Pot is great for art, but design and branding have so many other facets to it than just art. Keep it in mind and think of a new name. If you want to market yourselves as people who create high, just call yourselves BLAZED. In that case, well, I guess good luck"
logodesign,38nfj1,cosmicblob,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:10:13 2015 UTC,"Wowowow haha, we don't design while under influence. And we've been friends for the last couple of years, not gonna expend in the foreseeing future. And this is a pot head idea, sounds mean :'("
logodesign,38nfj1,cosmicblob,3,Fri Jun 5 13:29:32 2015 UTC,"I like the name. I don't really see what he is saying about it being off putting to future employees, and it's not like you named it after yourself as they are making it sound.  Even if that were the case and did hinder you, you could say it stands for something else like ""design, development and marketing: working 3gether"" for example."
logodesign,38nfj1,cosmicblob,5,Fri Jun 5 13:44:36 2015 UTC,"""You could say"" is not nice branding, it's a cheap escape for sub par work. Only when you can go ""we are saying this"" and mean it, not as an afterthought,  you are doing a decent job. Afterthought design is the saddest design tactic used today.  And just so you can get the image: You are a budding designer, looking for a job. You stumble across a company called ""3 guys"", with 3 workers. What will you do? For me I wont go for it, I will just feel like I'm an assistant to the 3 guys, no different than a mcdonals cashier.  Again, the name is cool, just not for a design firm."
logodesign,38nfj1,cosmicblob,2,Fri Jun 5 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"Wait wait wait, so I know pentagram. I did not know it was started by 3 people. penta means 5 right? not 3. I dunno, maybe they were counting something else than the bodies in the room.   Yes it is subjective, design is that way and we live with it. If it was not subjective we would have automated machines to brand things by now."
logodesign,38nfj1,ComteDuChagrin,2,Fri Jun 5 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, thanks for the knowledge, I don't ask much on reddit cuz the question to actual chance of answer ratio is pretty low. I'm just typing with my knee jerk reaction here.   The name pentagram has enough abstraction to hold it's own. The name 3gether seems to hold much less, so easy to notice that people will, in essence, notice, and react accordingly. With a name like pentagram you do not think of five people.  But I do take your point, if I start my own company by myself, it will start with uni, mono, uno, or ena now. ena is greek for one. How about enatic? combination of ena and fantastic. I think it is better than 3gether already."
logodesign,38nfj1,AlaskaGraves,2,Fri Jun 5 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"I'm skirting around here, still holding my ground. pentagram is a word by itself, that is smart since now I know it was five peeps. 3gether is not....  Ok you know what fuck it, I'm backing down, my logic machine has churned enough out today, if they wanna be 3gether, fine.   Honestly I'm ashamed I got into this, I just remembered the words of my mentor. ""The name of the shop does not matter, it is what you do.""  I have much to aquire still.

logodesign,38nfj1,cosmicblob,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"you could say  ...

logodesign,38nfj1,JaquesNoir,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"Ok good, and thanks for responding.  But you should still change the name. It is very inclusive. Our line of work requires us to associate with others, and we want clients to associate with us too. I mean, if Jay z, Sinatra, and Janis Joplin started a group maybe they can be called 3gether.   But again they are artists. I'm not saying it's not a nice name, I'm saying it's not the right name for a brand agency started by nobody's (if you are actually very well known famous people, or extremely talented and have been recognized for your work already, dismiss my statement.) One's name should create some emotional reaction in others. Yours does, but it is that three people will work hard for your cause. With that you will only get clients that want a three man job. You are limiting yourselves.   And expending is about dreams and hopes, have some, they are nice to have in you.  Also, pothead ideas was not meant to be derogatory. I love them and had them. I'm saying it lacks the finess required in the professional world, and since you recommended pot to some other user, I assumed you came up with it high."

logodesign,38nfj1,Nuclearpolitics,3,Sun Jun 7 02:42:40 2015 UTC,"Consider the implications of printing this logo...  I know so many of us work and think digitally, but we also need to consider consistency of reproduction across all media. This logo will be very difficult to reproduce consistently across print.  Further, without your rationale or a wordmark, this logo doesn't communicate much to me, it is very interesting, but what do you need to convey to your audience?  I don't quickly see a 3 or a ""gether"", imo this concept needs to be pushed further. I don't think this is appropriate for a branding and design group."
logodesign,38nfj1,ComteDuChagrin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:29:51 2015 UTC,"So let's see, we are on a logo sub. Well aside from it showing a three no relation can be found to the objects used to compose the 3, no context, very confusing, and no flare. Adding texture to a logo is generally a sign that a logo is weak too, though I have done it too in a crunch. I'm sure u/LAASR will have some counter to this, but the name and logo indicate a lack of experience. I personally will recomend you kids get more experience at firms and shops and reunite, but again u/LAASR probably has an excellent counter to that."
logodesign,38nfj1,Nuclearpolitics,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:34:05 2015 UTC,"Looking at each one individually, they feel very off balance.  I feel like it's a jenga pile about to fall over.  There's too much space, to little balance.  Without text or context to tell me what this is supposed to be for, it also says nothing to me.  It leaves me feeling a bit confused.  But between the two, I like the left better.    I'd like to see this in a properly used context.  Remember--if you're going to be offering website, design, and above all, branding, whatever potential clients see that you use for yourself, they're going to assume that's the best you've got.  If it doesn't look thought through, they'll pass."

Those kinks in the middle need to be cleaned up.  And if you want the logomark to make more sense, I recommend picking a typeface for the full name that matches the more geometric style of the ab in the symbol so that people can make a proper connection. You'll also probably want to work on making the ab in the symbol more obvious somehow."

So in your case, start drawing the shape with everything rotated right, so the straight lines would align with the Y-axis. Makes it much easier.  It also makes it super easy to mathematically correctly draw the tangent you want; when drawing the circle with the ellipse tool, you get 4 anchor points.

You may need some more anchor points [Object, Path, Add Anchor Points] and then using the Direct Selection tool, start removing segments (I'd highly recommend starting from the 12 o clock point and going clockwise / anticlockwise so you join the circles along the x axis). Next, duplicate the circle and drag it up so it's showing a kind of figure of 8. Then drag the top circle horizontally until its midpoint is in line with the bottom circles most outer anchor point. Then all you need to do is connect the 2 anchor points using the pen tool."

What if you did the same with the shape (circle/hex) and made it a square with a slight curve on the top and bottom that followed the banner (or perhaps just a square?).

logodesign,38b6h4,Akeche,2,Wed Jun 3 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"The 2nd one (R /\ M E N)!  The spelling keeps changing on /u/LondonCultured 's mockups between 'RAMEN' and 'RAMAN.' If it's actually supposed to be 'RAMAN,' replace the 2nd A with the chopsticks to really accentuate the unique spelling."
logodesign,38b6h4,miguderp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:34:44 2015 UTC,"I like the top one minus the yellow logo and chopsticks in the bowl (since you have big chopsticks in the logo itself) They can even use the bowl/drink/chopstick part of the logo without the words for chef hats, aprons, receipts and small things like that. kevinesque also had an idea worth exploring by using just the name and a pair of chopsticks."
logodesign,389nq1,GoodEdit,12,Tue Jun 2 20:12:51 2015 UTC,The crude drawing style of the U and the circle around it doesn't match the clean and polished line work of the rest of the logo. Keeping it consistent will look a bit nicer.
logodesign,389nq1,ABSXLVTE,5,Tue Jun 2 20:15:43 2015 UTC,I said the same thing! But the shop owners liked it this way. The sketch style of the U and circle are what their logo normally looks like. I probably should have just made the trees and banner in a sketch style as well but there wasnt time. Now this logo is being printed on shirts. They really like it so I guess thats all that matters but I wish I could of convinced them to do it the other way
logodesign,389nq1,exit65,6,Tue Jun 2 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"yea you should have tried sketching the rest of it. Maybe still give him a version or at least make one yourself for your own book. Its good practice to finish up things like this to ""how they should be"" even if the client is happy with an ""unfinished"" version. It can often make the difference when looking for a job or showing off to new clients with minimal extra time involved."

logodesign,389nq1,devler,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:34:05 2015 UTC,"Right, thats a fair assessment. The reason for the trees however is that Port Orchard WA, specifically the skatepark there, is surrounded in pine trees. The whole town is kind of in a forest as is much of rural western washington. So once you know the context its a pretty good representation of the location of the shop."

logodesign,38azyc,VectorBravo,2,Wed Jun 3 09:35:57 2015 UTC,"you have an inner stroke on the K so it gives the illusion that the body of the K is only the width of the negative space, which it isn't, just an illusion."

Pencils: I use .5 drafting style mechanical pencils for detail stuff and 2mm leadholders for everything else, brand is unimportant, they just need to be not total shit. I've found that the Staedtler brand Mars Carbon 2mm leads are better than the Prismacolor brand. They break less and sharpen better. I like HB and 2B leads. I sharpen them with one of those standard barrel lead pointers.  Erasers: Pental Clic mechanical erasers for most erasing. I don't like block erasers. I just found out about Tombow Mono Zero mechanical erasers and they are the shit for small little spots in a detailed sketch. Only 2.3mm wide.  Paper: I use the cheapest art sketch books I can find when I go to the store. I also use tracing paper and graph paper as needed. Again, it doesn't really matter to me what kind, I just buy cheap.  Bresh Pens: I use some but I know jack shit about what is and isn't considered good. I have a few Tombow Dual Brush pens and they're ok.

You can get fancy if you want and buy the Staedtler Lumographs but they're the same pencil made by the same company except that they charge you more for blue paint and no eraser. To sharpen your new 100 pencils, I keep a brass bullet in my satchel and any ole' mechanical sharpener on my desk.  Lately, though, to break up the monotony I've been drawing with carpenter pencils from Home Depot. They're very sturdy and feel nice in the hand.  My paper preferences change from time to time but it's usually whatever I happen to have handy. Though I do always keep engineering pads around. I've tried the dot-grid paper and I just don't care for it.  In photography circles they say that the ""best"" camera is the one within reach. The same is true of pencils/pens/paper. Find something you like, but take care not to get too snooty about it or you'll let your most brilliant ideas fade and die while you're looking for the ""right"" material.  (edited to fix a link)"

I think you should reduce the size of them as well (try 75-80% of what you currently have).  Make the ""by: Jordan & Mandy"" smaller so it ends before Bloom rather than running off the edge (although personally I'd remove it entirely)  Remove the shadow, it's a dated element IMO, replace it with a very thin black stroke if you need something, but I think it'd work just great with the white border.

logodesign,384qqk,audioeric,2,Mon Jun 1 21:31:44 2015 UTC,"Logos are supposed to be simple. A lot of people think that any art form, whether fine art or more commercial, should be complex and detailed. A logo can be seen as a metaphor. In creative writing, a metaphor uses colorful language to describe a situation or a scene. A good metaphor helps you paint a picture by making you fill in the gaps. It doesn't tell you everything. It tells you just enough that you can understand what the writer is trying to convey.  As far as BoyWonder Gaming, I spent a few minutes making this."

logodesign,384qqk,sarcaster632,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:18:07 2015 UTC,Ask your clients what they want before you even start.   You shouldn't be working on a logo if you don't know if they want something complex or simplistic. That's one of the first things you need to be clear about when starting a new logo. If you don't know then you give multiple options and gauge their reactions.

You might want to think carefully over whether that is really the item you want to go for. If you can't figure out anything to associate, you might be better off going for a text logo.  However, assuming you're set on the wrench idea:  First thing you'd probably wanna do is mirror the wrench diagonally. Maybe you plumbers hold 'em differently but right now it looks like it's aimed the wrong way. I think most people expect the mouth of the wrench to be aimed downwards.  Try and change the graphic of the actual wrench to something that looks a little bit more recognizable, perhaps use a few more shades and some sharper lines.  Green may also not be the goto color to use. Green is associated with energy and ecological stuff.   Since your job relates to water and infrastructure, something blue or grey would probably make more sense. Or red if you really wanna draw attention. Humans are naturally triggered by red, hence why it's used to mark mistakes and stop cars and things like that. Though you should be careful with the power of red, it might start drawing attention away needlessly at the cost of something else."
logodesign,3851tl,Gryff22,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. Wrenches are very common in plumbing company logos. really, they're either wrenches, pipes, drips, splashes, or any combo of those. I'm not set on it, but I did throw it at my parents when they suddenly needed a logo. So, it has been used in a few small ads. I was just hoping to tweak it, unless the design community decided it was absolutely terrible.  I mentioned in a comment below why I picked green. Aside from that argument, it is different than all the other local companies colors. One of our biggest competitors has a large blue oval filled with text.  I envisioned this on a charcoal grey background, maybe..  Once you asked what it was, i looked and decided it should be mirrored, like you said, so that'll likely happen if i don't scrap it all together. But, usually you use a backup wrench that goes the opposite of the working wrench, but i guess only plumbers would get that, haha. Also, thats not why its angled that way, just random.  As for shades and sharper lines, i dunno.. this is about the extent of my illustrator abilities, haha. Might have to hand it over to someone for"
logodesign,3851tl,Nuclearpolitics,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"I think you could push it a little bit further without assistance still.  When I think of a pipewrench I imagine it a little bit more angular. Due to the rounded shapes right now it kind of looks like a keychain:  I think if you would exaggerate the size the head a little bit, it will become more recognizable. It might also help to add some very subtle teeth so it's clear that part is used for grasping. Maybe even add a bolt/nut in between to imply an action.

logodesign,37r5g9,ddddamn,2,Fri May 29 23:26:45 2015 UTC,I think the second one looks very nice. The only thing I'd suggest is making the C a little smaller so that it fits a little better with the rest of the letters. Or you could make it a capital C. Right now it's kinda in-between.

logodesign,37r1r9,nasdas,3,Fri May 29 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/6OjmUBn.jpg  Honestly, there are quite a few things not right.   1.  Is the name actually supposed to be ""aaua"" connect, with 2 a's?   Can't stress this enough: give the letters more space. Especially the whole left part of the logo (ac oval shape thing) looks really cramped and it isn't pleasing to the eye. The oval shaped ac thing: the a and the c are way too big for the shape and not centered.  Kerning looks off: the oval ac thing is way too close to ""aua"" and ""onnect"". Nitpicking but the nn is too close together, too. How I read it overexaggeratedly:   aa ua  co nn e ct Don't really like the font/spacing; personal opinion but I'd like it better if the ""aua"" and the first 3 letters of ""onnect"" would align properly.  If I'd see this logo I wouldn't think about a social network; to be honest it's not even really a logo but two words with a little bit of stylizing.    EDIT: Here are two little concepts/ideas for you I quickly threw together:    http://i.imgur.com/L9YZJH8.png http://i.imgur.com/mmHi6cn.png   get some inspiration, play around with shapes forming a's and c's and you'll get a great logo eventually!"
logodesign,37r1r9,nasdas,3,Fri May 29 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"The lines you drew out pointing out the flaws in the spacing is wrong, you just don't draw straight lines and evenly space it out like you're implying in your link?   point number 4:   Don't really like the font/spacing; personal opinion but I'd like it better if the ""aua"" and the first 3 letters of ""onnect"" would align properly.      the circle around ct implying what? It's too tightly kerned?    It was more of a pointing out that I don't really like the font. It doesn't look aesthetically pleasant to me, but i don't know maybe it's just my opinion.     Eh? What do you see from the nike logo or coca cola? Sports and beverages? Seriously. The logo isn't bad and needs just a slight change but you're making it seem like it needs all this fuss.   Nike's swoosh looks incredibly dynamic and Coca Cola's logo is a beautifully designed calligraphy. This ""logo"" however, is just a text, using a generic font.  Do you see any ""facebook"" or ""twitter"" lettering on their front pages? Nope, guess what? facebook has it's famous ""f"" in a box and twitter's got the bird. These companies have actual logos.    Also, this is my personal feedback. OP asked for critique and I replied with my feedback. You don't have to agree with it."
logodesign,37r1r9,nasdas,3,Fri May 29 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"I see your point and TBH I chose the wrong words to point out my criticism. It isn't important that it should look specifically like a social network. But as a social network it should look unique. If we'd assume that this social network would be all over the place, it wouldn't have a real logo, just a ""lightly stylized, generic text"". Facebook's f in a box isn't a flattering logo, but if we look at an f in a box we automatically link it to facebook. You can use the f as a share button and everyone instantly knows that it's facebook. How would the share button of this logo look like? The ""ac"" pill shape? It just looks like formatted text. Could it work? Possibly. Is it a clever, innovative, fun or unique logo for a social network? Not at all. At least in my opinion."
logodesign,37r1r9,ABSXLVTE,1 point,Fri May 29 23:11:14 2015 UTC,Honestly it would look fine without that shape over the first two letters. It would just be simple and clean with no fuss and I would be able to read it and understand it at thumbnail size (which right now isn't happening). The typeface and colour are very nice as is and I feel that the shape is just odd and it makes understanding the concept tough.

logodesign,37r3hr,GrammerNaziParadox,3,Fri May 29 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of things to comment on that I don't like - the drop shadow, the illustration, the ampersand - but it seems pointless once I saw your comment:   I got paid, client's happy, move along there's nothing to see here kinda shit.   So, I'll just say that I've done logos for a client that I didn't like. This logo reminds me of work I had done when I started out because I didn't have the gusto to say ""no"" to clients. Their creative input is welcomed, but sometimes you can tell a client, ""I understand your viewpoint on the direction of this logo, however it is my goal to provide you with a logo that will look good on anything from business cards, to tee shirts, to vehicle wraps. If you want me to just do what you say, I will do that. However please understand that this will reflect your business to everyone that sees it, including other designers and customers with taste that is different from yours. It is for this reason I recommend changing a few things to make the logo much more universally appealing and applicable."" At least, that's what I tell clients nowadays and it's made my business much better.  For this logo, do yourself a favor and either don't add it to your portfolio, or redesign it before adding it. The drop shadow has to go. The illustration is nonsense and either needs to go or be completely changed (I'm not even sure how to change it to make it work - it wouldn't work as a 1 color, so why bother?). The ampersand is too close to the word ""associates"" and the font doesn't work for it.   I say all of this as a friend and I hope I don't come off rude. I know exactly what you're going through, but you need to do your job as a designer and stop clients from making your work look bad so that they can get what they think they want. I'm glad they're happy and you got paid. But I've found that saying ""no"" and making a good logo earns you respect and more business far better than just being a 'yes man' and pumping out subpar quality work just to appease a group of non-creatives."

After you do that, you should make the hummingbird smaller because right now it tends to lead the eyes first instead of the name."
logodesign,37mqrv,XtremelyNiceRedditor,1 point,Thu May 28 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"I would also add a pin stripe above ""Outdoor Designs"" to further distinguish the two."

logodesign,37mqrv,ke7ofi,4,Thu May 28 21:02:34 2015 UTC,"You should think about how the logo can be replicated in things like shirts, in one color and in grayscale.  All those hummingbird colors may not translate.   Edit: with that in mind I like 3. The bird can be recognizable in one color because of the lines between the shapes."
logodesign,37mqrv,wallybinbaz,3,Thu May 28 22:30:57 2015 UTC,I think 2 and 4 are close to being different versions of the same logo. the lines in between the shapes on the other two get a little rough at a small size  If I were you I'd show multiple versions.   Work it out so that the green bird on white is made up of different shades of green. That way they could get it screened on a shirt easily with just green red and black.  a reversed version  that is white and red on green  a version that is white only but maybe with various tints of white.  and an all black version with various tints of black
logodesign,37mqrv,designerPaul,1 point,Thu May 28 20:06:05 2015 UTC,the lines in between the shapes on the other two get a little rough at a small size   Agreed. I also agree with /u/CHESTER_C0PPERP0T about the typeface. Work can be done there. Maybe put each part of the business name on a different line or shrink the bottom line of text and/or use a different typeface.

Change the font, this one isn't good for printing on fabric or in small format. At least bold it. I would go with 2 although your logo shouldn't have more than three colors so use only one shade of green. It looks great, good luck."
logodesign,37mqrv,Z0rasgar,1 point,Thu May 28 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's an interesting logo. My comments: • Increase the leading on these, the two text lines are way too close to each other.  • Same thing with the bird; Try pushing him out a bit. He seems twoo close to the text, the overall lockup looks cluttered. • I would recommend exploring different fonts. Maybe have each proposal with a different font? I would recommend something like Helvetica Neue Thin, or Gotham Book.  This is my very personal opinion :) Hope it was helpful."

Along with the red part drawing what seems to be undue attention, I think it would be prudent to consider that there is a quite a mismatch between the very sharp/straight/pointed lines/shapes of the mark and the very rounded typeface (is it century gothic?). If you are planning to stay with this over all look and feel, I would definitely consider changing one or the other so that they fit better. The inconsistency between the two just doesn't work.  As it is, I am not sure this particular identity works quite well enough for me right now.

Also, this was a rebrand and that includes designs for stuff like print collateral, web, signage, flags, forms, and any number of other uses.

The company name doesn't really help with the connection either. What is it your company does that's unique? Focus on that, and try to come up with an original angle to take with your logo. Something that will help you stand out, rather than blending in with the thousand other upstarts with the same tired ideas."
logodesign,37nx4m,AdvocateForLucifer,1 point,Fri May 29 03:14:55 2015 UTC,"The company name is a combination of 'parallel' and 'meridian', the company described their theme as analogous to meridians in the sense that they act as a guide in the complex IT world, hence the logo with the globe and the compasses. Do you have any suggestions that would make it stand out more?"
logodesign,37nx4m,AdvocateForLucifer,1 point,Fri May 29 04:33:02 2015 UTC,"Lines, I suppose? Maybe something having to do with like, a high-speed train. That gets across the high-tech idea, as well as being something to do with acting as a guide, or a place to arrive at a destination. Complex, fast-moving, it sort of fits.  You could also incorporate something like a subway map (which looks ostensibly like a computer circuit).  As far as being parallel, I also think of symmetry along side that. Something about them both being pleasing at first glance; none of your logos are really symmetric or involve parallel lines. The first compass is angled strangely, the second one is off centre. The last thing on my mind from that is 'parallel.'"

The way I see it, your logo doesn't look all that different from all the other metal bands with aggressive typefaces. I look at that logo, and I see Metallica, not Lithium. I don't listen to much Death Metal, so maybe that's why I'm missing the appeal, but it seems like something that's been done over and over again.  Your band name isn't too bad, and it gives you a lot of options. Just go to the wikipedia page for Lithium (the element) and look for ideas there. For example, it's atomic number of 3 could be factored in somehow. Or instead of spelling out the full band name, just keep it to the chemical symbol (Li). Basically, just try to get creative with it, and think about what you want your band to be."

Just black type with a white outline on a white background with a black area underneath.  A logo is supposed to represent you and as it, it doesn't do that. I know you say it is meant to be very basic, but this is so basic that it lacks any resemblance to a logo at all.  I think you need to reconsider your approach and start to think about how you logo can become a visual representation of you and your business."
logodesign,37ni2o,InspiredRichard,1 point,Fri May 29 01:49:32 2015 UTC,"I like the simplicity of the first one, the white bordering around the letters works well. It might be a bit more striking if you could lengthen the tails of the g and p so they descend further into the black.  I think the second is a bit busy and the eye isn't drawn to monograph immediately, especially considering the vertical height of the whole image."
logodesign,37ni2o,sirlikesir,0,Fri May 29 01:34:13 2015 UTC,"This was my design I came up with a few years back. It's meant to be vague but distinctive and more of a trademark than a calling card.  The first logo is the basic form. It's Georgia (which I settled on after trying out several dozen serif fonts) with a modified Cheltenham g. I don't know any principals of kerning and did the best I could. I added the white stroke around the descending characters because I didn't want to risk it being hard to read.  The second one I came up with for my website (thought it's not up right now). I like the look and the idea.  The fine detail in each one doesn't work great when I need to resize them, but otherwise they basically work for me. But I'd like a second opinion."

Wario Ware is obviously iconic and the coke ad looks interesting - thanks a lot for that inspiration.   I should add, that I chose to keep the logo so simple right now as it will also serve as the app icon. To blend it better with iOS 8 apps, I chose this very simplistic design. Which imo works quiet okay - http://puu.sh/i4bbJ/699b39a780.PNG  The example of BrainAge wouldnt work here for example, since I am limited to very few pixels. (Displaying 2, or even 4 different minigames on 120x120 will make the icon look too busy, if even possible)"

Although my tips for you maybe is to change the ""Carlsen"" font to a bold Slab Serif font, and i liked how you incorporated the truck in the negative space (although at first i thought the R itself was the truck) but as @m0tionblur said it is not working since the truck is pointing upwards. Also get rid of that separator and increase the space between the two words. Another remark is that the horizontal bar of the first T isn't identical to the last T, and finally stretch the ""Carlsen"" word proportionally to the height of the word ""Transport""."

I get the idea but it's just too close from the rest of the lettering to accomplish that. Otherwise, it's close to ready for print - close enough that I can nitpick at things like the second 'I' having that weird ridge in the middle and curving it to match the first 'I', closing off that little dip in the 'r', rounding off the weird edge on the first 'I', maybe rounding off the 'a' insides as well to match the rest of the language as well as the last 'e'.   Lastly, I would zoom in to that gorilla face and re-do it as it was clearly done at the resolution of the rest of the lettering but it needs to be more fine against it.   This amount of detail I'm giving obviously means it is far and beyond the other entries, not to detract from it."

You'll also notice most of these are for smaller companies, which is a perfect outlet for this type of design work."
logodesign,36hpn3,they0da,2,Tue May 19 17:00:07 2015 UTC,A lot of these are still pretty simple.
logodesign,36hpn3,chipwhitley63,2,Tue May 19 19:45:20 2015 UTC,"Many of these logos are nice to look at, but they have very complex patterns and shapes in them.  People will struggle to remember many of them, which makes them weak logos. People will not be able to re-draw them, which makes them poor branding choices.  These logos are in virtually every case unnecessarily complex, and could be communicated far more effectively by reducing the parts down. With many of them they would be more memorable AND much more effective if they took the core idea and took away all of the detail.  They list Starbucks and Heineken as quality complex logos, but the Starbucks logo isn't particularly memorable - people just know it because it is everywhere, and I bet the vast majority of people only remember the typeface and the star (the most simple parts) of the Heineken logo (can anyone state the other parts without going to google it?)  EDIT: Added in about Starbucks and Heineken."
logodesign,36hpn3,InspiredRichard,2,Wed May 20 00:25:19 2015 UTC,The ability to redraw a logo is evidence that it has made an imprint in a person's mind.  I bet you I could write a list of 20 logos and pretty much everyone would be able to redraw them pretty well exactly without any further revision.  A logo recalled without revision is a much more powerful logo than one which is remembered when shown again.

logodesign,36in8p,AkzidenzGrotesk,1 point,Tue May 19 21:00:55 2015 UTC,"This logo is super complex and busy. It seems that you are trying to visually explain what you represent with lots of different elements. But this has had the result of creating a piece which is saying far too much through the elements.  You can reduce the amount of elements massively and much more effectively communicate the message you want to convey.  Take each piece of the composition and ask yourself why it needs to be there and if the logo would be just as effective without it.  For example, why does the 'swoosh' behind the runner need five shades of green? Surely the same meaning could be conveyed with one? But then, why do we even need the swoosh? You can see the runner is moving by the stance he has taken.   Is this logo for a business you are working for? If so, you should nail down their vision, values, outlook, approach, products etc and try to summarise them in one idea. After summarising in this way, try to communicate this one idea in one thing. The current logo really has at least 5 main parts and is doing way too much.  Go away and do some research to see what this business's competitors are doing, and how their branding incorporates their vision, values, outlook, approach, and products etc. Their logo should be a great symbol for everything about them. Consider large brands like Nike (probably the same market segment) and how their logo is super simple, yet perfectly represents what they want to communicate.  Take a step way back and work out what is going to really work for this business."
logodesign,36in8p,InspiredRichard,1 point,Wed May 20 00:53:11 2015 UTC,"I get the impression that this company has some sort of product or service that allows athletes to monitor/track/compare their performance in some way. Look at the way a similar company like Strava has branded itself. Very simple. Two colors. Simple lines and shapes. And they seem to have grown a lot in the last few years.  Simplify this logo. Maybe the mountain could be made to look like a heart monitor reading (if that's relevant at all, maybe it's not). Then remove the streak and maybe the runner entirely. Clean up the text. As AkzidenzGrotesk points out, it's all over the map."

logodesign,367fn0,koloskye,9,Sat May 16 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"Too busy. Too many elements involved. As a rule of thumb, you should stick to a single idea/symbol/element within a logo. Either the buildings or the ruler, but not both. Also, the counter (hole) of the P looks off."

logodesign,367fn0,4ofclubs,6,Sun May 17 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"Good start.  I'd reduce the amount of notches on the ruler so it reduces better, maybe up the width a bit? Also consider a different typeface just because the j looks like it was made an extended i on purpose (I know the typeface is a good one but in this case it doesn't seem to be working.)  Also why is there four different names?"
logodesign,367fn0,drunkenstyle,3,Sat May 16 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. I definitely agree the notches on the ""P"" did not scale well and are lost at a distance. The ""j"" is a weird little abomination of that typeface.   The four names just represent four different takes on the words ""Vigour Projects Estimating Services"". As a beginner I'm was trying to figure out which combo worked best. Ultimately the client decided on a different designer before I was able to present this so I wasn't super invested in settling on one name."
logodesign,367fn0,InspiredRichard,3,Sat May 16 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with it being too busy with too many elements. I suggest either keeping simplified notches or keeping the buildings.

It's probably because of how bold the M is in comparison to the other letters in this font."
logodesign,364g6n,InspiredRichard,3,Tue May 26 23:56:35 2015 UTC,"The thing you'll notice about the best logos is how simple they are. They are often made up of very few parts, and usually those parts are quite simple.  The reason these logos often work well is because when there are less items, the focus is on the few things that are there, rather than being faced with lots of things. Without clear hierarchy in the composition, everything tries to take the focus of the viewer. Where there is more elements, it causes more noise.   Think about analogue vs digital radio or TV. Analogue often has lots of background interference, but digital is purely the content. The background noise is not present, leaving only the subject matter so you can clearly receive it.    The same is true for a logo - take away anything that is unnecessary and you'll be left with the refined, core item/message you want to convey through your work.  Let me ask you:   How simple do you consider your logo to be?  Are there any unnecessary parts that you could take away and more easily get the results you are looking for? Is there a simpler way to take this idea that has less elements?   Some thoughts about the composition you have already:   When I squint, the thing that really stands out to me are the two brown/gold rectangles directly below the bow. Are these the most important part of the design? I ask, because they really grab my attention A bow looks a bit like an ampersand (&). Have you considered trying to make an ampersand bow and placing it inside the box? Do you need the '.com'? Most businesses now have a website. Why have you used all upper case in the type? Uppercase is often regarded as shouting and is very masculine.   If you decide to make any changes, I'd be keen to see any revisions."

I also wonder if you need everything you've ever done on this site, or if you should curate it to a smaller selection of stronger work and then link to your dribbble or behance page?  I would be much clearer about your role in the bike designs. Labeling the section as ""Product Design"" led me to believe at first that you designed the actual bikes. I'm guessing you just did the artwork, though?  I would ask a copywriter friend of yours to take a pass at editing your About bio... I think it could be stronger. The contact page also reads fairly awkwardly. Why would they be contacting you with concerns if they're interested in purchasing your work? Etc.

logodesign,35oumw,streetlightnings,2,Tue May 12 11:31:10 2015 UTC,"So yeah, I intentionally left out specifics for what I was trying to achieve as to not distract from first impressions but the logo is an ancient Hawaiian warrior.  http://www.bigislandguru.com/uploads/9/3/2/8/9328373/1084257_orig.jpg  I originally wanted a classic mean looking logo (think traditional mascot logo designs of the past with more modern execution) but as I continued I started to think I could pull off a rainbow and a wave within the helmet. Obviously Hawaii is known for their Rainbow Warrior mascot, but along with that is their history of migration (the wave). If you've read anything of Hawaiian history/folk then you have heard of the fleets of warriors that came to conquer the islands.  Some aspects of the logo require quite a bit of backstory, which is okay because it's for a very localized demographic. The tongue for example being part of the haka.

logodesign,35nw2a,clintmccool,1 point,Tue May 12 01:17:43 2015 UTC,"The fact that the logo is smaller than the type in ""a - f"" is based on feedback from the other thread.

logodesign,35nw2a,InspiredRichard,1 point,Tue May 12 01:40:02 2015 UTC,"1) If you post something, don't post it with those strong JPEG artifacts and maybe a little smaller as well.  2) None of them is very appealing. It's mostly because of the too-narrowed typography, proportions and image/typo arrangement. Additionally, none of the shadows was a good idea.  Ask yourself the following and change it appropriately:  1) Why are the ""non-approved"" documents the same size as the approved?   2) What would you expect more to be recognized? The typography or your blip? Chose one, make the other smaller, yet readable and with a good margin + tracking.  3) Would you be able to recognize your blip if scaled down drastically? I doubt so. Give it more space as in E, and refine it.  My suggestion:  Use E as a starting point, scale the typo down to be in align with the blip, make the dashed documents somewhat smaller and let them blend with the approved one correctly, change the red tone to be not totally Adobe Acrobat and try some uni-spaced fonts."

Although I prefer how you handled the logo mark on version ""D"". Probably doing a thinner font for ""resume"" instead?   How do you feel about it? The only draw back to this version of the logo is you don't have a simple logo mark that you can use without the logotype, like you would with versions B through E on your first post."

However this is probably the best in terms of proportion of your icon and typography.  I think 1 is the closest overall, but the shape of the countries looks bad, especially next to the clean hand shape you have there – ie it looks like you haven't modified a noun project icon to make the countries.

This would help reveal how logos work in the trenches.  Of course, one problem would be that if it was a real-life logo, foreknowledge might interfere with the logo appreciation, but if fictional, it would be hard to compare the analyses to reality. Hm."

logodesign,35gbo2,Nuclearpolitics,8,Sun May 10 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"This is lovely as an illustration but a little too detailed for a logo. Think about what elements must stay and which might go, then figure out how to simplify the elements that must stay. A good rule of thumb is that the logo ought to work in greyscale or at least as a single color (maybe it will be reversed on a dark T-shirt?), and it ought to still work at 1/2 or 1/4 of an inch at the smallest dimension. This currently would fail those little tests due too being much too finely detailed and having not enough contrast between the darkest color and the grey.  The overall composition and balance are lovely. Maybe you can find a way to keep the general shape but simplify it down. I would first think about how you could get the different components across without using the grey stroke lines. Try to use the white/negative space of the paper or screen instead.  Conceptually, I think that the tree is coming across but I am not getting graduation cap at all. I thought it was simply a shape behind the leaves for contrast. As for the pomegranate, it looks more like a Christmas ornament to me right now.  Good luck!"

Using a globe for a travel firm is just too obvious. There's nothing special about it. Instead, I would focus the design on the ""connecting travellers"" aspect. Every travel agency/firm involves the world because that's what travel is. Your logo should identify the value and unique traits of the firm, not the core concept that is a dime a dozen.  For example, if you had an airline, don't use a logo of an airplane. Every airline has airplanes. Instead make a logo that symbolizes the superior quality/unique services of your specific airline (whether it be great customer service, luxurious cabin space, etc)"

logodesign,34csk4,statejudge,3,Thu Apr 30 02:49:58 2015 UTC,"On my last logo I probably spent 60% of the time on paper before moving to Illustrator. From there it was a quick build that mostly involved using the tools to get a perfect similarity between related letterforms, kerning, and getting consistent line weights from vertical to horizontal. Almost all of the actual design, embellishment, flourishes were worked out on paper.  But that might not be a common workflow. I just wanted to spend a lot of time on paper so that I made sure it had the sort of character I was looking for. On a logo before that it was more 10-90, but that was more of an icon than a wordmark, that lent itself well to iterating in the program."

logodesign,34csk4,nicetriangle,-1,Thu Apr 30 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"The main reason for using illustrator was primarly because of its vector capabilities, that no other adobe application had at the time.  Nowdays photoshop is closing up quite a bit in much of the vector functionality, but it seems like adobe still wants to keep illustrator as its main vector workhorse.  Footnote: What is vector and why does it matter for logos? Traditionaly we separate between bitmap and vector graphics. The first one is rendered pixel by pixel (jpg, bmp, png, etc). It looks crisp in its original size but looses detail when scaled up or down. Vector on the other hand is created by anchorpoints where the lines in between are ""recalculated"" each time it is shown. This gives a vector the property of beeing endlessly scaleable and will look crisp in all sizes (think from business card to side of skyscraper)."

Sometimes when I begin working for a client I'll have the winning idea just pop into my head as I'm sketching concepts out on the paper, so I end up just going from step 2 to 6. If I'm not getting that epiphany though, I'll use all steps.  I also look through some of my reference guides and logo books for inspiration if need be."

logodesign,344580,Juiceemang,7,Tue Apr 28 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"Like they said, make the leaf more apparent. You don't necessarily have to make the leaf a darker green, that might make it too busy with a 3rd color, which is kind of already is. Lose the gradient on the right side of the N stem, I get it's an implied sun, but it's an unnecessary focal point (distracting from the leaf itself).  Also, close the stroke cutting through the top of the 'N', this will be implied just by the colors meeting and also are arrows pointing you away from the logo itself, as well as distracting from from the N and the leaf. You should also close the top of the logo (the left side stem of the N).  There's no reason that it should be on the same level as the right side stem of the N. With the leaf pointing up and the opening leads you away from the logo and the name of the company, but with it closed it will shoot your eyes back down to the name of the company. I don't mind the opening at the bottom because they are level and lead you to the actual name of the company, but could be problematic if the logo should ever stand alone without the font underneath it (I'd have to see it updated & without the font to really know). The N and the S being a larger font size is unnecessary and causes problems for swift reading. Personally, I would stay away from the serif font and go towards a san serif because it's more timeless and less of a time stamp. The Serif makes it feel as though it's dated. Nice draft though!  Good luck!"

I think if I had to comment on anything it would be removing that blurred white that's supposed to represent what I'm guessing is the sun.

logodesign,343jr0,SilverBot,6,Tue Apr 28 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"A few questions for you:   What are you trying to say with your logo? How are you trying to say it? What is the purpose of your logo? How is this shown? Who is your logo aimed at? How is this logo appealing to your target? Why did you pick these colours? Why do you need the background lines? Does it work in greyscale? Where are you planning on useing your logo? Does it work in all of those situations? E.G. on a business card, on a letterhead, on a website, on the side of a car, on a billboard, on a pin badge, on the side of a pen? How well does it scale?   A few comments:   The 'G' is very undefined and looks like a dented 'O' Logos should be simple. This normally means having a few parts as possible. Your logo is made up of many parts. Have you scaled this logo back as far as you can to it's core to make it as simple as possible? Good logos are easily recalled wihen people see them again. How easily do people receall your logo? Great logos are easily redrawn from memory. How easily have people been able to redraw your logo? If people can recall and redraw your logo, what is memorable for them? For example, is it because it is clever, unusual, well designed, well suited for it's purpose etc?"
logodesign,343jr0,InspiredRichard,3,Tue Apr 28 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"These are very useful questions to ask before/during/after the whole process! Thank you for this, I'll use these next time."
logodesign,343jr0,InspiredRichard,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:16:14 2015 UTC,"Glad to have been of assistance :-)  One key thing for you to consider is the purpose of your logo.  Your personal logo acts both as a visual representation for you/your brand, but it also is made to connect with your target audience. So you should ask questions of your work from both of these perspectives.  In order to properly get an idea of what you might want to best produce, do your research. Look at those who are your peers/the people you are competing with to get some idea of how other designers are working. Try to work out who you are as a designer, then seek out designers who have a similar outlook and examine their work and style.   On the other side, think about the people who you hope your logo will connect with. What kind of work would you like to do in the future? Seek out the best businesses who are doing this kind of work. Examine their style, and the style of their work. Outline their vision and the things they see as important. Remember, you want to design in a way that would catch their attention and appeal to them. Design in such a way that if this business were to see your mark, they would notice you and want to hire you. Remember, every part of their work has been given the highest levels of consideration, so you should as well.   Take these two pieces of research into your work and make choices in your design based upon them. Justify everything and every single part of your design.  A couple of books I recommend you have a look at:    Logo Design Workbook: A Hands-On Guide to Creating Logos by Noreen Morioka. This book really opened my eyes to branding and how when done right, it can be implemented well in so many different ways. Design-it-Yourself Graphic Workshop: The Step-by-Step Guide by Chuck Green. Mainly the first four chapters (even up to chapter seven a little bit) helped me to work out my name and purpose as a designer. It got me thinking intelligently about my appropach to my work and my target audience. As you have, I began by using my initials, but then I starting thinking in terms of a brand for myself, which lead me into names which could represent me. With this kind of thinking, I was able to use a word which could then influence the logo design behind it too, and thus more easily make a logo to represent me.   Anyway, I hope this all helps too. I wish you all the best in putting together your portfolio :-)"

Basically you will always have your name/initial as a backup idea with the main idea being... you're using your initials to communicate that you designed your initials. Which speaking to broader creative terms, isn't that creative because everyone can do it for their names and a ton of people/businesses use this idea every day.   When I look at portfolios, I'm really interested in the actual work, maybe the UX/coding of their site if it's clear that they made it and not so much the personal branding element. Students oddly spend a lot of time debating the personal logo and yet they still are usually less impressive than the work - I think some of it has to deal with the old adage ""the cobbler's kids have no shoes.""

logodesign,33x5sj,iamheavensent88,3,Thu Apr 30 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"Also wanted to solicit your opinions. Thinking about instating a new voting system soon that would work roughly like this:   Battles still run every two weeks but each battle thread will also be a voting thread for the previous battle Votes will be cast on some kind of a poll website like google surveys Usernames will not be listed with their entries on the voting page. The person with the most votes will still get to select a fictional client for a battle but the battle they select for will be the one after the next since voting for any given battle takes place during the battle directly after it   This will address the issue we've been having with people hammering entries with downvotes and it will also give everyone the same chance to win, regardless of whether they submitted at the start or end of the contest period (since late entries currently don't have as much time to rack up votes). Also probably going to install a trophy flair of some kind for winners pretty soon. I'm assuming people would like that.  If you have any requests, suggestions, or even criticisms, please do feel free to reply here or message the mod team and I will get back to you asap. Thanks everyone for participating in these battles, the entries have been getting better and better and we're really starting to get a sizable turnout. I hope you're enjoying them.  Also on a side note, we're going to start building a recommended books list for the subreddit's wiki page. If you have any logo related books you like, please submit titles to me so that I can be sure to include them."
logodesign,33x5sj,GoldieFox,1 point,Tue May 5 18:29:41 2015 UTC,I think this is a good idea and is worth trying out. Keeping the voting open for longer will be good for the late entries who are currently at a disadvantage. As for using a poll website for voting could you not just disable downvotes on the battle threads?
logodesign,33x5sj,5tr2,2,Sun Apr 26 17:06:55 2015 UTC,"Disabling downvoting can be bypassed by disabling subreddit style in the sidebar settings, or by using an app like Alien Blue, or by highlighting a post and pressing Z on your keyboard, so it's not really a viable alternative."
logodesign,33x5sj,5tr2,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"Ah fair enough, I'm all for an alternative voting system then."
logodesign,33x5sj,5tr2,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea, but my concern would be participation in voting. On one hand, it means you'd really only have people who are interested and already involved taking the time to vote (negligible, maybe, but still more than an easy upvote) – then again, maybe that's a good thing. Although it'd take longer to get the results of the voting, it'd certainly be a fantastic way to make the contest more ""fair"" – by allowing people more time (since they wouldn't be penalized for later entries), it could also improve overall participation.  I think it's at least worth a try."
logodesign,33x5sj,5tr2,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:38:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's kinda my thoughts. The idea is not without a few drawbacks, but I think it's overall a net positive improvement over the current system. I think I'll give it a try for the next round and we'll see how that goes."
logodesign,33x5sj,5tr2,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:41:45 2015 UTC,"Additionally, the submissions could be retained until a specific date, this would prevent building on top of ideas of people who posted early, and it would allow people to follow their genuine ideas, and not dismiss them if somebody has already posted something similar.  It could happen that somebody has a brilliant but obvious idea, and rushes his design to be able to claim that idea first. Retention would prevent this."
logodesign,33x5sj,Alriteyeah,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:51:57 2015 UTC,"Additionally, the submissions could be retained until a specific date   I'm definitely open to suggestions, but I'm not 100% sure I follow what you mean. Would you mind clarifying?"
logodesign,33x5sj,dreadpirateroberts2,2,Fri May 1 15:49:46 2015 UTC,"Collecting submissions  from participants and posting them all on the same date for voting, this is what i meant. The rest like you suggested in your post. Sorry if there's some funky grammar in my writing, i'm from Germany :)"
logodesign,33x5sj,Alriteyeah,2,Mon May 4 18:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we would collect all the submissions from the battle once the submission period ends, then place them all onto a voting page at the same time so every entry gets the same amount of time to be voted on."
logodesign,33x5sj,dreadpirateroberts2,1 point,Mon May 4 18:27:06 2015 UTC,Best would be having the participants submitting through PM to you or another mod to avoid knowing who is who when voting.
logodesign,33x5sj,Botmid,1 point,Mon May 4 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"I think that's a little excessive and that simply having a voting page with the entires without usernames is plenty good enough. People don't downvote entries because of some kind of vendetta against a given user, they do it because they either don't like the entry or they're trying to give themselves a better chance of winning by downvoting everyone else. Having the voting page solves both of those issues, making everyone PM me the entries does not.  Also, going to such lengths to make the entries totally anonymous doesn't actually solve any problem. There is not some kind of organized campaign to tank someone's entries going on here. It just makes my job harder and also makes the submission process for people more complicated. It also would rob people of the opportunity to critique eachother as the entries are submitted over the course of 2 weeks, which is a valuable resource for the people participating. Open discussion is a good thing.  I appreciate your input but I think it's unnecessary."
logodesign,33x5sj,CokeHeadRob,1 point,Tue May 5 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"Too much work for too little benefit, i get that.  But maybe it's worth researching suitable voting systems to keep the bias unrelated to the work itself minimal. It would make it more valuable for the participants. We're just humans, and bias is in our nature.  Discussion and feedback should take place, i suggest making feedback mandatory at the time of voting, explaining why it was voted for or not. Discussions still could take place afterwards, or not?"
logodesign,33x5sj,dreadpirateroberts2,1 point,Tue May 5 19:23:03 2015 UTC,People are either going to vote for their design or the one they like best. There will be no down voting and only one vote per person so all of this added complexity you're suggesting is extraneous.
logodesign,33x5sj,CokeHeadRob,1 point,Tue May 5 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"I would prefer the following:  Participants submit to the page or online document themselves, ""anonymously"", this way you don't have to do the additional work.  Discussion of submissions could still take place in the thread, where everybody has the option to engage in the discussion and reveal himself, or not.  At the time of voting, written feedback for every submission should be mandatory, where voters drop a line or two why they voted for it or not.   Like ""pic C got my vote - opinion""    I think everybody deserves feedback who invests time into this, good or bad.  Too complex? Maybe, but i think it's worth it."

logodesign,33x5sj,CokeHeadRob,1 point,Fri May 1 23:02:41 2015 UTC,"The way I was going to go about it if I get around to doing one myself is just make a logo for Holy Spirits and kinda ignore the rest, but I suppose whatever anyone does within the rough confines of the rules that gets the most votes is the winner."
logodesign,33x5sj,fuzzyjelly,1 point,Sat May 2 13:40:43 2015 UTC,Yeah that would be my recommendation and is what I think /u/dreadpirateroberts2 was probably aiming for when he wrote this brief.
logodesign,33x5sj,zoobox,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"The original comments are deleted and all I can see are /u/nicetriangle's replies, but I'll throw in my clarifications. The brief constraints were geared to help narrow the options and inspire creative thinking within parameters. There were several questions regarding mockups in the previous battle, so I added that suggestion to the brief for inspiration. Ignoring it won't necessarily result in downvotes, but it seems that concepts which include mockups tend to be received more favorably."
logodesign,33y8tz,mrmonkeypower,5,Sun Apr 26 19:55:58 2015 UTC,"It's unbalanced, which is ironic given the symbol. I get that you're trying to achieve the yin yang with the white space, but it won't come across properly unless you put a border around it.

What's more interesting, I assumed they did the rebranding during the war which would be weird, but somehow those rebranding dates don't fall under the same time of WWI and WWII, strategic rebranding move? Probably."
logodesign,33ti19,LAASR,3,Sat Apr 25 14:45:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, those original ones have so much more character compared to the rather generic one they have today. But hey, I guess that's design trends for ya."

logodesign,33ti19,Akeche,0,Sat Apr 25 18:54:06 2015 UTC,2004 is a catastrophe. Adding a logo on the side like that just makes me cringe.
logodesign,33ti19,Hugotohell,2,Sat Apr 25 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is a part of the official logo though. SkyTeam is a collaboration of airlines (Namely Delta, China Airways, Air France, etc). For some reason, the person who created this collection of logos merged two together him/herself."

What would you suggest as behaviour for a non pro logo designer? I want to make logos every day, just getting more practice and trying different styles. There aren't enough logo competitions online or?"
logodesign,33qo9t,Sh4rPEYE,2,Fri Apr 24 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"This should really illustrate to anyone else paying attention how important it is to actually shit down and sketch through ideas. I swear that the majority of people posting on the design subs saying something along the lines of ""I'm trying to come up with an idea for X, but I can't think of anything"" probably haven't made a single mark on paper 90% of the time."
logodesign,33qo9t,nicetriangle,2,Sat Apr 25 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"I actually started asking young designers in interviews if they sketched out their ideas.

The line on the top is too far over to the left, /u/surehavechanged already addressed the bottom, but try to keep it the same as the top.  Size is a pretty big issue here, everything is big, making it smaller would give it more room to breathe and take effect, this is especially true for the centre, give it more of a border by making ""Farmer's Market"" smaller or making the green bar behind it wider and taller here's a good example that's similar to what you're trying to do  This idea has potential though!

logodesign,336344,dreadpirateroberts2,3,Sun Apr 19 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"It amazes me how critical people can be having never read the creative brief or understanding the project specs. The high majority of redesigns are leaping straight off the cliff of aesthetics with no regard for effectiveness.  A logo doesn't have to be good looking to be effective, and the Clinton '16 brand is still being developed, so the way the logo is perceived in six months will be wholly different than how designers are esteeming it presently.  I can remember Obama's logo in '08 getting ridiculed as well (although people tended to come around to being in favor of it pretty quickly.)"
logodesign,336344,they0da,3,Mon Apr 20 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"While I agree that simplicity does a hell of a lot of good in communicating values and improving recognition, I feel that each candidate's logos are fairly simple. People keep bringing up the fact that Hillary's logo is ""simple"" so it's effective, but I can easily sketch every other candidate's logo from memory. I've seen Hillary's, Rubio's and Rand's logo twice, and Cruz' once.   Personally, I'm not a fan of any of the current candidate logos right now so I am pleased to see what others come up with. If your point is that you're tired of seeing Hillary logos utilizing the arrow in essentially the same spot, then I'm totally on board with you. However, when I see clever logos utilizing different symbolism and composition, I'm all for that.   Let's also not forget that these standalone logos never really came about until Obama v. McCain. Sure there have always been complementary marks associated with candidate's names, but Obama had his ""O"" and McCain had his star. Ever since then, most candidates have been trying to recreate the success that Obama's designers found in his first running. Unfortunately, in the case of Hillary, I feel like they're trying a little too hard. I respect the hell out of Pentagram, even if I disagree with their decisions from time to time but I want to know their thinking behind the logo.   Obama's logo was successful in large part due to those rolling hills within the ""O."" It connoted an instantly recognizable sense of Americana while implying a sunrise slowly climbing over the hills. Yes, it was simple but it had enough of a supporting visual cast to resonate with the public. These are the stories that these candidate logos need to tell. With Hillary's, I look at that and I think, ""go this way to vote."" I don't want a candidate telling me what to do. Obama's logo invited you into his vision, to be apart of it. Hillary's just tells you where to go to vote for it. In other words, Obama's said, ""do this for us."" Hillary's says, ""do this for me.""  And just so I don't leave the other candidates in the cold. Rand's and Rubio's do a nice job of representing the torch in different ways, I'm just trying to figure out what their torches represent. Passion? Revolution? I think if they can straighten that out, they'd be in a good spot. As for Rubio, there's a map of the U.S. (missing two states) sitting on top of a squished wordmark. Nothing of interest to see there.  Damn, typed a lot more than I thought."

Also, I can't tell if Apollo represents (the diety) or Apollo (the space program) or some random dude named Apollo. You might want to revisit and determine what Apollo is and represents then use that to inform the design. Do you want to play off the god or space program? Do you want to be overt with those connections or subtle? How do they tie into the design/brand overall?  Since you're basically developing an entire brand, you'll need to ask those questions and create that storyline behind the fake company.  Ultimately, the mark doesn't feel informed or inspired. Create a backstory for the company and why they chose the name Apollo and why it's important to the company and their target. Maybe even write a brief mission and positioning statement. Move forward from there."

Looks like you've got a bit of the anarchy thing going but kaust is right, I think it would be a huge help for you to pick a direction or theme. If your theme is space, gods, anarchy, or whatever, it will help take your logo design and correlating materials in a specific and cohesive direction.   Skating is about action and movement so I'd work on adding a bit of ""motion"" to your design (not actual animation but the idea of movement within the design!)

logodesign,32s85j,wishtree,3,Thu Apr 16 13:27:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure the icon tells me anything about the app. It almost feels like a photo app because the name involves ""focus"" and the weird corners remind me of resize handles and photo corners (that hold photos to a page). I'm not sure the edges are necessary at all.  After reading about the app, I'd try to find metaphors for what your app claims to do. Immediately things like magnifying glasses, lenses, and even zen concepts come to mind. These don't have to be literal, but could help lead your design to be more meaningful.  If you're going to stick with text, you could try something like FOCUS (being slightly blurred but still readable) and ON being bold and sharp."
logodesign,32s85j,kaust,2,Thu Apr 16 16:17:31 2015 UTC,It's really not bad but kinda lacks finesse. I'd pick a different font with a bit more weight to it to match the thickness of the corner mark things.

logodesign,32l69s,thewarehouse,3,Tue Apr 14 20:29:18 2015 UTC,"With that cutout you've thrown off the weight of the letter. The letter B is pretty tough to work with, especially with modified cutouts. In most fonts the top and bottom bowl of the letter B are not equally sized and NEED a crossbar in order to not be confused with the letter D. I assume that thin white line is a mistake?  That said, the sharp edges inside do not go well with the smooth curves of the outside. You should also try to include more of a crossbar, keeping the weight of the B shape in mind with the goal of being 'balanced.' This doesn't mean symmetry, but my eye should look at the entire shape equally, as right now it is stuck looking at the gap between the two bowls, as the curves 'point' there.   How do you plan to use this? As a monogram? The first letter of a logo? What does the company do?"

logodesign,32l69s,GareKon,2,Tue Apr 14 18:50:39 2015 UTC,Well the white line just is random and doesn't look like it should be there. Also if it's a logo it should be distinguishable at all sizes and in the thumbnail it just looks like a misshapen rectangle. (http://i.imgur.com/lPfhAZN.png)
logodesign,32l69s,ABSXLVTE,2,Tue Apr 14 19:23:00 2015 UTC,The rounded outside edge and angular inside edge look really awkward together. They don't fit together. Also that thin white line looks accidental. It looks overdone for the sake of making it different

logodesign,32gi97,designgoddess,3,Mon Apr 13 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't followed their work in a while, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Seems to happen to a lot of big firms. They get so big that they can't take risks anymore. Payroll demands are real.   I was at a press check with one of my designers years ago. He started complaining to the printer that our clients didn't allow us to always do cool designs. He wished he could work on all the cool stuff he saw coming out of Pentagram. The printer took us to the sample room and opened a couple of drawers of middle of the road corporate sales materials. What I think of as our bread and butter work. Nothing fancy, no great design, it could have been done by anyone. Only it was all Pentagram. Even I was stunned. The printer told us that about 75% of the printing he did for them was the same. They did a lot of it, but they never ever talked about it. It wasn't allowed in portfolios, other clients never saw it. It was a nice lesson for my young designer and I was thankful to the printer for sharing."
logodesign,32gi97,Joe_FML_King,2,Mon Apr 13 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"It's because of how Pentagram is structured, I worked at their London office as a designer for a short period and basically it depends which partner is the lead on the project. Some partners do genuinely output some excellent work while others are more run of the mill, who generally will be as you said doing that bread and butter kind of stuff. Wolff Olins for me are a far better agency, but my favourite branding work generally comes out of agencies like Bibliotheque & Build."

logodesign,32gi97,Beerisradical,3,Tue Apr 14 23:03:00 2015 UTC,"I always try to look for designer's intent when judging a piece of work. Sometimes a functional/identifiable piece of design is better than just making something look pretty.  To see the intent behind The New School branding, we have to look at the current state of design. Where will all of these pieces live in the real world? Without delving too far, we can see that print still exists, but design is more and more digital as well as mobile. An identity needs to live in many different environments: phone, tablet, laptop/desktop, on top of various print assets.  With every application and website becoming responsive, why not make a typeface that is responsive as well? The flexibility of the typeface allows for an amorphous identity. The type can fit into any application/output you need it to, and it's distinct enough to be easily recognized (with time) as The New School branding. And personally, it's a good departure from everything looking super clean and ""bebas neue."" There's enough personality to discern it from everything else that gets put out into the design world.  It's not clean, but it has personality and functionality."

logodesign,328jh3,xscz,3,Sun Apr 12 22:47:28 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to the rough edges, I used two different techniques in this logo.  The first being that I pasted the MUD BURGERS text into photoshop, flattened it to a layer with a white background, added a decent amount of noise, blurred it such that the edges were soft and the center was still solid black, then adjusted the levels to get the outline I wanted, copied that into illustrator and did an image trace with the ""black and white logo"" setting  The second technique is all in illustrator. Make a path, go to effect > distort and transform > roughen and check smooth and use pretty minimal settings for size and detail. selecting absolute instead of relative may yield better results depending on what size you're working in in illustrator. I design logos in a 2000x2000 pixel artboard and so absolute works better for me.  Then, to get the logo to look like a stamp on brown paper, I basically used a layer mask on the logo with a grungy paper kinda texture pasted in to the layer mask and then I set the layer mode to multiply and the opacity to maybe 90%. You probably want to blur the edges of the logo a little too because a hard vector edge looks artificial.  Hope that helps, lemme know if you have any questions."

logodesign,328jh3,Wumbo_Corp,2,Tue Apr 21 12:26:17 2015 UTC,Sharp. Love your mockups.
logodesign,328jh3,logopoc,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:55:52 2015 UTC,Thanks man. Just figured out how to do them.
logodesign,328jh3,Losnomustachios,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:05:57 2015 UTC,How/where'd you figure it out? I'd like to learn!
logodesign,328jh3,Bromlife,4,Tue Apr 28 08:27:14 2015 UTC,"Google, quite simply.  I just googled ""business card mockup psd"" or ""packaging mockup psd"" and it will bring up sites (such as Graphic Burger that have free to download .psd files that you can edit in photoshop.   Once opened in photoshop the layer that you will edit is a smart object, so you can double click it and it will open as a seperate document that you can apply your design to and save which will make changes to the original file, most downloads will have instructions in the titles of the layers.  PM me if you have any trouble and I can try and help."

logodesign,328jh3,wookiesdontcry,2,Thu Apr 16 20:24:29 2015 UTC,I like the continuous line idea. Kinda think it would have been cool to keep little gaps like this to accentuate how the burger is made out of one single line

logodesign,328jh3,dreadpirateroberts2,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:07:38 2015 UTC,Yep to Illustrator's Offset Path function. I had to do some manual smoothing afterward to get rid of a few hinky edges.

logodesign,328jh3,IJustFartedOnMyGF,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"First time submitter here, and design student.  Trying to practice my logo design skills so I've taken to using these challenges to hone my craft.  I've taken the ""professional"" in a slightly different approach, and tried to create a brand that that aims to attract young working professionals who are looking to get right into the down and dirty that is a Burger.  They are greasy, cheesy, and sloppy.  And after a long hard day of working away, there's nothing better than a cold soda and greasy burger.  A Mud Burger.  It's a step away from what the client wants, I know.  But the first thing that came to my mind when hearing ""Mud Burgers"" was, obviously, ""mud.""  So I took that and ran with it, keeping it simple with line work and two-toned.  I've created a secondary page that shows a black-and-white version, if anybody gets this far and cares to take a look.  Also, as I said, I'm a design student new to logo design so critiques and feedback are more than welcome!  Thank you!"
logodesign,328jh3,Wumbo_Corp,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"I'm finding it funny to see several entries include the ""Established 1992"" tagline. I initially added it to my entries because it seemed like an element that a higher end burger joint might incorporate, even though nothing along those lines was included in the creative brief.  I think it adds a high-end touch to your entries, so I'm not criticizing any of you for it. It just hits me as mildly entertaining. There are some really nice entries this round. Congrats to all on the solid work."

logodesign,324grm,they0da,15,Fri Apr 10 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"If I didn't know what Waffle House was I would say this was a pretty nice comprehensive branding project. The type might be a tad small in the lockup but I like the posters and the pattern.   Unfortunately though Waffle House is a cultural icon and I think as a rebranding you have failed in utilizing any of the existing brand equity. You stripped all the character away that is associated with Waffle House and to me this says ""A place that sells waffles"" instead of THE ""Waffle House"".   I have to ask, have you been to a Waffle House?   Edit: I'd also add that it would be much nicer to see how the rebrand would apply to building exteriors, signage, interiors, etc. over something like watches, since the environmental design is a big part of the current Waffle House brand."
logodesign,324grm,Eduro,3,Fri Apr 10 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, the current waffle house shows what it is. A cracked out waffle restaurant. This rebranding could show that it is no longer a cracked out waffle restaurant."
logodesign,324grm,Ickulous,3,Fri Apr 10 15:40:03 2015 UTC,"Why even bother calling it Waffle House then?  OP said...   my research still indicated that Waffle House was seen as a low-tier highway chain (even though it's one of the most profitable chains in America)   It's seen as that because that it literally what it is and although I haven't done much research, it probably also accounts for a lot of their profitability.   Maybe I'm thinking about it too much but if this was a real rebrand there are a lot of things that OP's design makes me wonder. Is he targeting a new audience? How does this factor into Waffle House's current near nonexistent marketing? Is he aiming to gentrify Waffle House? Are interiors and exteriors being redesigned? How much will costs increase because of this and how will the costs trickle down to affect the average (current) Waffle House patron?   Consider this data...  http://i.imgur.com/0kklPbH.png  http://i.imgur.com/GzLBCm0.gif  http://i.imgur.com/8fgWVGw.jpg  There's a reason you can't plop a 5 star restaurant in a low income area off a highway.    I'm getting too deep into this but then again, that is why these made up projects often seem shallow to me in the first place."
logodesign,324grm,Eduro,3,Fri Apr 10 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"So my goal with this rebrand was to give Waffle House a different feel altogether. While I completely agree with you that it is a cultural icon, a lot of my research still indicated that Waffle House was seen as a low-tier highway chain (even though it's one of the most profitable chains in America). In a sense, it's an icon, but with an image that holds up lesser in the public eye.   I've actually been to several of their restaurants, and one thing I wanted to retain was the yellow squares in the original logo, which I allude to in the mark. One thing I also got the sense of is that everything essentially said ""THIS IS WAFFLEHOUSE."" I wanted to stray away from that and let the warm yellow and warm grey really come forward in the brand.   That being said, I understand completely where you're coming from. I think we simply have 2 different approaches in how we would go about rebranding the restaurant."
logodesign,324grm,nicetriangle,13,Fri Apr 10 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"I think your work on it is really nice looking overall but like others have said, you've lost Waffle House's brand equity in the process and the result doesn't really say casual roadside breakfast diner. It's definitely very corporate looking.  I think you may be missing the point a little bit based on how you're rationalizing this and I have an anecdote that is fairly pertinent here.  My old roommate a few years back got engaged to this chick who was an account exec at a marketing firm based out of Atlanta that happened to handle Food Lion grocery stores as one of their main clients (it's a mid sized chain of lower quality grocery stores in parts of the Southeast). Coincidentally my first job ever in high school was bagging groceries at a Food Lion.  I asked her why it was that all Food Lion grocery stores were always more run down and less well kept than pretty much any other chain in the area and she said that it was a fully intentional and that Food Lion purposefully targeted that specific lower tier segment of the market and that shooting for fancier stores would raise overhead and simultaneously alienate their specific target demographics.  The company had made a business out of being sorta shitty and were pretty successful at it and had cornered that specific market in a number of areas. If they tried to move into a different tier of the business, they'd be competing on a playing field they were no longer dominant in and they very likely would lose.  Back to Waffle House...  Waffle House's brand image is basically synonymous with being a greasy, kinda shitty road side diner. That grit is part of the chain's character and they've made a shitload of money that way. I don't go there for a polished dining experience. I go there because I know my severely drunken, disheveled appearance at 3am is going to blend right in. Their brand image is also strongly associated with retro Americana. They're not not trying to put lipstick on a pig and if they did, it would be a subversion of everything they've worked to build up about the brand. Unfortunately your rebrand definitely crosses that line and so it can't really be considered successful."
logodesign,324grm,GaslightProphet,2,Fri Apr 10 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"One of the things that helps contribute to the ""corporate look"" is definitely the product choice. For instance, I can't imagine getting a letter from waffle house. On other product choices, I think the sticker sheet is a cute idea, but one that's not easy to implement -- who wants to lug a sticker sheet everywhere they go? It's a better idea to get some sort of punch card that could fit in a wallet and serve the same purpose."
logodesign,324grm,Dr_imfullofshit,5,Fri Apr 10 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"There is nothing intrinsically wrong with your reimagining, its beautiful. As a consumer however, the side if the highway, open all night, greasy oasis identity is pretty closely knit with with what I remember waffle House being. I'd be a little disappointed if they tried to class up the joint. Aside from my personal feelings you did a great job, I love that logo."
logodesign,324grm,caseyls,5,Fri Apr 10 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, totally agree with this. To show off his skills, this rebrand is absolutely wonderful. It looks really, really good.   In practice, however, without waffle house going through a complete business model transformation (which who knows, could have been OP's intention in the first place), I don't think the rebrand fits the style of the current, late night, side of the highway sketchy waffle joint."
logodesign,324grm,jensenw,16,Fri Apr 10 20:45:05 2015 UTC,Looks like a tech startup
logodesign,324grm,novalsi,13,Fri Apr 10 19:01:07 2015 UTC,It's fantastic.  Aside from the fact that it's all wrong for Waffle House and their target demographic.
logodesign,324grm,ICanTrimYourArmor,5,Fri Apr 10 16:10:41 2015 UTC,It won't really match with the interiors...or the people working in waffle house. I have to agree with the above commenter that there really isn't a way to get around this logo unless WH is doing a complete business redesign.
logodesign,324grm,spaceicecream,0,Fri Apr 10 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"The brand was developed as a complete redesign. The group I was working with and receiving feedback from discussed at length how to best implement this a restaurant setting. What was agreed upon, myself included is that the grey would be restricted to the uniforms, type, and smaller items. The restaurant itself would be primarily white and yellow with grey accents. Being that it wasn't an interior design class, there was really no time for me to focus interior mock ups."
logodesign,324grm,Seann7656,4,Fri Apr 10 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"This is quality work, and I understand you put a lot of thought into re-imagining the whole restaurant  inside and out. But that's a pretty big disclaimer to put on this project (most people won't stop and read the preceding paragraphs).   Anyway, it looks like a logo for a tech company. For example, if it said Westward Systems, I wouldn't think twice about it, and this would be great. But the reputation of Waffle house is larger than what's easily considered in a redesign. Your logo makes me think WH is a much cleaner, nicer, more cute and friendly place to be. The uniforms, interiors, and cleanliness may change, but not to the extent to which the logo communicates.   Really quality work though, and it has me changing my mind as I type this. If you were going to run with it though, the waffle seems very large in contrast to the word mark.   Thanks for letting me rant about this."
logodesign,324grm,zyxone,4,Fri Apr 10 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely amazing. You are clearly very talented. but as others have stated I just wonder if it fits for a waffle house? The mood I get from viewing this is energetic & youthful. This seems perfect for a fast food restaurant or a food truck, but I don't know if this makes me think of a quality waffle house. When I think of a waffle house I think of an established, warm and comforting diner. Something maybe a little more ""old-timey"" and less corporate looking. My suggestions is maybe go with slightly toned down color shades and try to give it a more rustic look. If this is really what the client wants though, I think you nailed it!  Is there any chance we could see the old brand? I'd love to see a before and after!  Edit: Nevermind, I just Googled the old brand and researched the company a little. Being a diner chain, I actually find this more fitting than what I imagined. It's intantly recognizable wherever you may be. Their old logo is an atrocity, haha"
logodesign,324grm,HarveyDangerClose,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:00:09 2015 UTC,"I like the Rounded Typeface. The only thing that is bothering me is the kerning between the W and A in Waffle House, it seems a tad off. My eyes get caught on that part.   Really liking the posters/flyer & cards. But I don't quite get a waffle house feeling, if it wouldn't stand there it could be ""any"" other company. It's clean and neatly layouted but especially the website is missing some kind of character that is inviting to me."
logodesign,324grm,EuphoriaRush,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:25:07 2015 UTC,That grey doesn't do anything for my appetite.
logodesign,324grm,quackamoly,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:13:54 2015 UTC,"At first glance, I thought it looks way too corporate for a food company. I think you should drop the grey. Maybe go for more of a brown to make your audience think about delicious maple syrup or a cup of coffee. Though, I do love the seasonal holiday campaign and what you did with it. Though, judging from the comments, the Waffle House brand is untouchable, unless you incorporate the cheap and greasy aesthetics."
logodesign,324grm,helloitsdro,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:35:37 2015 UTC,"Unlike most of these people, I had no idea there was a the waffle house, and i have no idea what it represents, but even I can still tell you that what you made is not suitable for the name ""waffle house"", or pretty much any kind of restaurant.   It looks clinical, corporate, dry, cold and boring. This does not look like a place I would want to take my family. It doesnt look like a place i would want to go to get a waffle.  Here's whats wrong with it:  Colour: The greys are possibily the least inviting colours you could have chosen. Almost anything else would have worked better than two shades of grey. They look corporate, in the worst possible way.  Logo: The symbol itself looks like it should be for a tech startup, or a drone based waffle-delivery service. It's trying to be modern, but it just turned out flat and boring. The wordmark fits really well with the logo, but it doesnt inspire any feelings in me at all.   Overall look of the branding: You've done one thing really well, you took the flat design trend to places it was never supposed to go. Trends like this have their value, but this was not the place, not the time, nor the brand for it to be used on."
logodesign,324grm,Jmg3,-4,Sun Apr 12 07:03:11 2015 UTC,To be completely honest with you....  I love it! Your concept is awesome!
logodesign,322igf,letsgolego,10,Fri Apr 10 01:28:28 2015 UTC,"I think you probably want to reexamine your type. The typeface is uninspired for a company that deals in what should be a fun silly game. Another problem is how far apart your letters are spaced. It makes the word difficult to read. Your colors are really muted. Think brighter, bolder. You're trying to inspire people to get up and have fun. Keep the client's specialty and demographics in mind while you work on your concepts. Keep at it!"

logodesign,322ec0,TraderHoe,4,Fri Apr 10 00:54:00 2015 UTC,"All good logo designs start with a long conversation between the designer and the client about what the client wants and doesn't want.

Not even going to bother with picking apart the obvious problems if we were to address that as a logo, but I will say your idea of grandeur looks like a cheap chinese knockoff watch.   To be honest, you should be embarrassed. Your company, which focuses partly on branding, can't even do branding. Branding has little to do with logo design, it starts with strategy and envelopes the dictation of psychology and marketing to a viewer by reflecting your brand's value and establishing emotional engagement. Again, I refuse to call that a logo but for the sake of speeding along conversation, your ""logo"" does not do any of that."

You can refuse to call anything a logo, but just because it doesnt fit your standards of what a logo is doesn't mean its not a logo. A logo is literally just a visual representation of an entity, this includes ""just words"" which are called wordmarks. And furthermore, the logo is not the end-all be-all of a brand. The brand exists mostly outside the logo, so the logo doesn't HAVE to do all those things, as long as the branding picks up the slack. So, you're kind of wrong and kind of right. It's not a good logo, but it's a logo."

There is a reason why so few logos are completely plain wordmarks, it's because a plain wordmark just looks like a word. And when the word is also just an everyday word, and not something special like a brand name, it falls further into nothingness. Plain wordmarks of everyday words need either a tremendously interesting branding approach, or they need a pictographic accompaniment."

The entirety of his forethought was using all caps on a basic font. And serif just looks terribly cheap and dated. There is nothing for branding to even latch onto or enhance.   The whole purpose of making a company is to sell your services to others, so it really isn't my judgement of what constitutes a logo, but rather his potential customers. If his creative process for a brand is picking out a cool font with no real research, he is brutally doomed. Unless his business is going to use fiverr, how can he sell his business to a worthy client.  I totally agree with you that the logo is just a small part of the brand, I said as much.

Not a very well thought out one, but it is one.   And serif just looks terribly cheap and dated. There is nothing for branding to even latch onto or enhance.   This is one very narrowminded opinion you have there.You probably also think Bebas is the pinnacle of modern typography?

I totally agree with you that the logo is just a small part of the brand, I said as much. But his branding is going to have to pick up A LOT of slack.

It may be cliche to put a pair of scissors for a barbershop, but it may confuse potential business for the barber if you use a bunch of flowers because his name is Bobby Hydrangea.  There has to be some appropriate balance.  And a lot of businesses do want their branding to be quite literal. Clever is good only insofar as it still communicates clearly.

logodesign,31ikr3,ABSXLVTE,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, the only critique I can give is: bad You clearly have an understanding of how to use paint / basic software so it's probably a good idea to find some professional software that will allow you to really come up with a good design. If you're uncomfortable with vector based illustration software such as Adobe Illustrator, maybe something simpler such as Adobe Photoshop would be better. There are also alot of good, free alternates out there such as InkScape for vectors or Gimp for pixel based design.  If you're really new to the whole design side of stuff, then you're going to get lost, but this is the best part in my opinion, I love having to find the solution to a problem and teach myself how to utilize a feature later down the line.  If design is something that you love, you NEED to learn to use software that is far more advanced than paint so you can truly let your talent show.  That being said, I would be more inclined to go with something that actually represents your clan / team on CS. Maybe something along the lines of this: http://imgur.com/uqhEdPf  If you're interested in designing something similar, I suggest what /u/eacrataes mentioned and find as much online educational pieces as you can."

Your current design is lacking in every aspect. I wouldn't know even where to begin on how to critique it. Learn a bit and then revisit the logo again after a bit of practice.

I might consider a different color, or suggest using strokes for the stars so that they pop more. Also, that really long name is completely illegible at that size. I would either hyphenate it or abbreviate it somehow.   I know its a pain, but in the future I highly suggest a program other than paint. It's going to save you a ton of trouble when you have to go back and edit a logo. Good luck!"

Your name is short enough to work into a solid logo, no need to abbreviate it as that will actually hurt your brand.  Try approaching the new logo from a different angle. Every artist in the EDM scene has a 'pointy slanted' sans-serif logo. See if you can come up with something original that you can also apply to your music.  Good luck!"

I'm no expert and this is just my observation. My observation and opinion could be completely wrong.  I see what you mean about EDM artists having 'pointy slanted' logos. Here are some logos of producers that I really like 1 2 3 4. Some logos of competitors 1 2.  The market isn't too flooded with 'pointy slanted sans-serif"" logos.

logodesign,31g413,nicetriangle,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:07:13 2015 UTC,"Regarding your examples of ""Marks vs Text"", using Coca-Cola vs Pepsi isn't a good example as Coke is one of the most recognizable brands in the world.  Also, it was only recently that Pepsi started using the circle-only version of it's logo without any accompanying text, and that's purely a benefit of being around over 100 years.  http://logos.wikia.com/wiki/Pepsi  Realistically, you need to solve the problem of this scenario:  Imagine you are DJing infront of crowd of 100 people in a park. A new potential fan walks by, likes what your playing, and looks at the logo on the DJ booth to see what your name is. There are two outcomes here:   They see a 'LT' monogram, which by itself isn't enough information for them to understand it means 'Le Twitch', and they likely leave without ever getting to chance to follow you. They see a legible 'Le Twitch' logo, and are able to walk away knowing who you are and able to follow your music online.   Having a logo mark as an artist is not worth sacrificing the clarity that comes with having the full text as the logo. Of all the examples you posted, only Porter Robison has an accompanying monogram, and even then he still lists his name beside it. Had you just linked the PR monogram, I wouldn't know who it belonged to.  As far as how to approach it originally, I can't do that for you. You need to understand who you are as an artist. What makes you different from other EDM artists? What makes you stand out? If you don't have clear answers to those questions, it's going to be hard for you to describe that visually to potential fans."

We've tried this approach before but it always seems to connect in a funny way so we just opted to keep it unconnected (also has subtle symbolism with the concept of being off the line)
logodesign,31cbt0,iphonie,2,Fri Apr 3 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"I like where this is going, but make sure you pay attention to the stroke widths. See the e and the n. Make sure everything is consistent. Also the x height of the lowercase letters, make sure they are consistent. And the cap height of the O. Right now can't tell if it's supposed to be big or small. Right now it is in between the x height and the height of the l. Basically just make sure everything is consistent and that it works together."

If you can get the line weight of the type to match that of the logo, it'd look sharp. I would also avoid putting images in the triangle. They're hard to see and make it look cluttered.

I would choose a different font and split it up onto two lines... ""Sunset"" on the first line, large and perhaps a bit bolder than you have it, and ""Bible Camp"" on the second, in all caps with wide kerning. Adjust the size of this second line until both lines are the same width.  The strength of your redesign (and honestly, that's not saying much) is the trees. Could you take one of those and make it the focal point of the design? Maybe put it in a circle, off-center to give it a little visual interest, and ditch the mountains entirely?

logodesign,30yuzn,they0da,4,Tue Mar 31 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"One thing I can encourage you to do is to start doing word/mind maps. Essentially, you'll create 3 lists. One labeled ""Sunset,"" one labeled ""Bible,"" and one labeled ""Camp."" Example: https://surprisestumbles.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/map-2.jpg  What you do, is for each word, you think of words that associate with it. First thing that comes to mind? Write it down. Something else then follows? Write it down. It's a great exercise to push the associations of your words. The reason I'm suggesting this is that right now, I'm seeing a very evident landscape (which can connote but sunset and camp) but I'm no seeing a visual hint for a bible. If it's intentional, that's fine, but I think you could benefit from trying to explore more visual solutions.  Just curious what vector program are you using? If it is illustrator, I'd suggest getting very familiar with the pen tool. With logo design, creating crisp shapes is a must. It helps a logo hold its structure and improves recognition. That being said, there are always exceptions but it's a good thing to aim for when starting.  If you have any questions about what I've said or want to show me your progress, feel free to pm me!"

Can I ask why the long shadows are all angled differently at the top? I also wonder what it would it look like if you got rid of the drop shadows behind the ribbons? Generally you want to avoid drop shadows at all costs. It doesn't print well"
logodesign,30ui9y,Seann7656,2,Mon Mar 30 21:38:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! There angled differently because I kinda quickly threw them in there to see how it'd look. I'd fix them in the final render. Here is what it would look like without any drop shadows added.
logodesign,30ui9y,Seann7656,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:46:50 2015 UTC,That looks way better! Because of the color contrast the ribbon effect is not lost. This is cleaner and crisp. The long shadow effect is trendy but is only good for digital formats. What program are you using?
logodesign,30ui9y,glassmountain,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:56:40 2015 UTC,I see what your saying and yeah I do like the look of the long shadow but it is very widely used. I'm using illustrator.

Also be aware of the fact that long shadows are very much a visual trend and there's no saying how long it will stick around. Rule of thumb when designing logos, is to keep it as simple and as un-trend like as possible to ensure its longevity."

logodesign,30wf1m,jcxco,2,Wed Apr 1 06:22:49 2015 UTC,The outer circle stroke. I would probably double the thickness. It will get lost at a smaller scale. I might also consider increasing the font size slightly.   Your guild will be proud of this logo!

logodesign,30u7d8,FauxPenumbra,3,Thu Apr 2 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"A couple things I wanted to mention:  I have added a rule to the contest stating that winners must reply to the admin team with their choice for the fictional client within about 24 hours. This is out of courtesy to the rest of the participants so that we can keep the battles running on schedule and allow everyone maximum time to submit work. If you do not reply or decline to provide a client, we'll move to the runner up or the admin team will select the fictional client. So, please check your messages.  Secondly, I want to point out the fact that because of the way we select winners for the battles, people who submit sooner have an advantage in the voting. While I want to encourage you to put as much time into your entries as you see fit, please be aware that last minute submissions do not have a good chance of winning. We may address this issue in the future, but for now that's just how it is.  And lastly, (and this is kind of a waste of my breath) please stop downvoting your fellow contestants. If your design isn't good enough to win without trying to tank other people's entries, then maybe you should figuratively and literally go back and hit the drawing board.  Thanks everyone for participating. Battle 19 was possibly the best showing we've had so far and some of the entries were really good. Really makes the effort of continuing to run these battles worthwhile. Keep it up!"
logodesign,30u7d8,Ickulous,2,Thu Apr 9 14:28:40 2015 UTC,"Have you considered dividing the contest into a set time period to submit entries, receive feedback and reupload corrections, followed by a set time period dedicated to voting. That would give late entries a fighting chance. Long ago, I was a contributor to Worth1000 and I'm pretty sure that's the format they use, which seems to have done well for them. It was strongly encouraged that participants vote and leave feedback for all of the other entries. Their voting was on a 1-10 scale, so that might not apply here, but the feedback rule might be helpful."
logodesign,30szf5,thlayli_x,5,Mon Mar 30 13:38:12 2015 UTC,Looks nice. I would thicken the strokes and typeface (and add some more kerning) so it scales better and looks fuller but overall it's fairly well done.

I love the color red for this logo, but maybe you can do some different shades for the dots to give it a more dynamic look. You nailed the balance of the logo.

If he only wants to see a single color, whether it be black/white/red/purple/magenta/whatever then it might be a little more tricky.  To accentuate the LINK in the company name, you could take the LINK portion of the text(I assume you made it an outline) and add a stroke that is the same color to make it thicker.  This could also be done by simply using a regular version of the font for TECH and a bold for LINK but I know we don't always have that luxury."

However if you want to try it in Gimp my best advice would be to trace your scanned logo with the ""Pen Tool"" (note - this is the same thing you would do in Illustrator/InkScape/CorelDraw).  The Pen Tool creates lines based on points rather than just being specific pixels like in a typical rasterized image.   FURTHER RASTERIZED ADVICE: If you do go with Gimp; This video shows the idea behind creating line work using the pen tool, although it is done in Photoshop, Gimp will be comparable."

The first 'F' is difficult to see, but the 'O' is even less easy. The shading looks like a dirty thumbprint In smaller usages, the detail will be completely lost (EDIT: I saw your comment after typing this) What is the purpose of the shape between the 'D' and the 'I'? Why did you choose this font? It doesn't say anything to me about gaming in the style of the letterforms I do not think it give me the impression of a gaming business My first glance of the icon is that it is for some kind of grubby camera company. Perhaps a second hand camera business that sells well used/worn equipment cheaply? Two ways to test if this logo is decent: a) can people recall it? b) can people redraw it.  There is no way I could even redraw the icon while having it open in front of me. The only part which is memorable is the shape between the words, and that because it is a bit odd.   EDIT:  10.At a smaller size, without the icon, it will basically be a single line, all caps logo with a strange shape between the two words. I do not think this will be overly memorable or even really look like a logo.  Sorry if my words are a bit hard, but I am trying to be honest to help you."
logodesign,303xve,redeyedesign,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:04:23 2015 UTC,"Hi there,   Thanks for the honest critique, I'll take that into account when I revisit the design. However I did have one question, how should a 'gaming business' look like anyway? I mean is there even a defined look that all game companies need to reflect? I can understand if their occupation involved developing games for children or had a very cartoonish art style."
logodesign,303xve,Seann7656,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"That is a really good question.  I'm not sure what kind of background you have with items of design, but there is a lot to consider when designing a logo.  One appraoch you can take is to examine what other gaming companies are doing, but even this approach may be flawed, because maybe the companies you look at didn't get it right either.  The approach I would take is to ask exactly what elements a gaming company should be seeking to project. Then consider, what does this gaming company want to project?  For example, I recently designed a logo for a nanny agency.   The brief required a friendly, approachable feel, yet professional, showing that the business was able to cater for children of all ages (hence the range of different 'toys' at the top).   You'll notice that I used soft colours, and a typeface which has rounded letterforms. The arrangement of the icons at the top gives the impression of a wall freeze or even elements of a 'cot mobile'. The icons chosen, with the heart at the centre were used to try to say 'loving care for your child'. I wanted to avoid the well overused symbolism for nanny agencies - an umbrella (Mary Poppins), but also give the impression of 'nanny' or someone who is going to take great care of your children. The typeface I used is not over-used, and it really adds to the over all brand. The icons and colours can be used on their own in any number of connecting situations, and really help to broaden the brand appeal. For example, I can use the colours on different parts of their website, maybe to emphasise different things. I can use the icons on their own in a places that require subtle branding.  A really important part of designing a logo is picking the right typeface. The shape of the letters will often have a massive impact in how the final design is laid out.  I would start by writing down exactly what you are looking the logo to say, and then consider what kind of chacteristics display this. For example, if you want to convey something fast moving, you might use an Italicised font, or, for friendliness a rounded font, An image of strength might require a font with thick letterforms, all caps and hard edges. Websites such as DaFont have lots of reasonable typefaces there for free. Spend some time browsing the site and have a look for the type of typeface you're looking for.  After you have your font, you will have a better idea of how to change the letter forms in some way to make it unique, or how to best incorporate the icon you'd like to use.  I hope this is helpful :-)"

This is partially due to the investment company naming themselves an ""adventure"" company. I would focus less on the adventure aspect of the company and more on creating a design that showcases the real estate investment piece, that is if they are dead set in naming it Property Adventure.   On the design itself I would make the peaks two different peaks and not a duplicate of each other to add depth. Also the peaks seem to be squashed a bit, I believe you could try adding widening them out. The circle with a banner design works for a variety of companies, but I don't feel like this is one of them. Definitely explore some different ways to represent the logo and text."

At first though, I kept reading DANG, then DANG GIRY GIMES for the 4th one.   I think you need to decide how you're marketing your studio. For a games studio this should be easy; what kind of games are you creating. 3D, 2D? Large scale games or arcade style games? Clean and stylish or messy and childish? Who are you marketing yourself to and what do you want them to think when they see the logo?"

As far as marketing goes, I estimate the indie-gamer crowd would be the best fit, fans of role playing games, that type of deal."

However, I do feel that the whole ""L that's also a nose"" concept is forced and a bit too much. The problem with it is that it only works if the logo is rotated, whereas all elements and images in a logo should be apparent and understandable in the upright orientation. Use a normal letter ""L"" and let the glasses stand out as the main point of interest. I found myself thinking ""hey that g looks like a pair of glasses... not sure why they made the L so small though.""  I also agree with /u/nicetriangle that the line weight is too thin.

The others appear like they spent more time and effort getting it to fit into these complex geometric figures, when all they likely did was add the guides AFTER they created the logo. Not to say they didn't create nice logos, but they didn't use predetermined shapes, they made the logos first and drew the lines after. Hope this helps!

The type could use working on too, the font I dont feel suits the logo at all, maybe try something closer to comic sans style(its no joke.). People often make jokes about how terrible it is but I think it suits some themes very well.

logodesign,2ytv0y,ABSXLVTE,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:04:53 2015 UTC,I think it comes down to font. When I saw it I thought right away that it would look really nice with either DIN font or Aktiv Grotesk font.
logodesign,2ytv0y,nicetriangle,2,Fri Mar 13 01:40:08 2015 UTC,I also prefer the 1st and think with some extra work it'd be pretty useable. I think any computer related business logo with the on/off icon is kind of cliche and played out at this point so I'd suggest avoiding it.

logodesign,2yq8of,GishHD,3,Wed Mar 11 22:17:43 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/gusI0S7  Make sure it's readable on various colored backgrounds. (:
logodesign,2yq8of,LeoFromTheTribe,3,Thu Mar 12 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"So being your first logo, I will say you definitely have the creative juices flowing. As of now, the text is difficult to read and I'm wondering if there is anything else that the ""fin"" shape represents? Is there also a reason for the backwards ""F?"" One thing I always aim to do, is make sure that my typography reflects the shape of my mark. Right now, you're using a condensed sans-serif with a slight curve at the corners. Try reflecting this same type of finesse in your shape. With that being said, it would also be a good rule of thumb to modify the corners of your ""F"" to fit with the rest of your type. Overall, it's not a bad first logo by any means, you just need to push it more.  Here are some things to consider going forward.    When designing a logo, make sure everything is done in a purposeful manner. Everything you do (typography, color, shape, etc.) should have a reasoning behind it.  Explore. When I began as a designer, I always found it hard to keep expanding and refining my concept. I'd always settle on the first ""good"" idea I'd have and call it a day. What I learned over time however, is that this severely handicapped my creative ceiling. You need to be willing to set aside your first ""good"" idea and see what else is out there.  Consider your objective. Do you want to create a masculine feel? Does the company or organization have a certain mission they're trying to accomplish? These are just a few of many questions to ask yourself and the client during your creative process. The better you can identify the organization's desires and traits, the better your design will be.  Keep going! Logo design which is just a small segment of identity design, is a very tough business. Personally, I love the challenge but I know a lot of people who hate logo design simply because they've decided to give up. Don't be one of them. Look through inspiration, find designers to follow, and keep pushing. To be completely honest, most designers flat out suck within their first five years. They have the creativity and the passion, but lack in execution. It will take a while, but you can do it!   Good first start. And as a small aside, many if not all logos are created using vector based programs such as illustrator. While I got away with using photoshop before I entered design school, it is a very limiting program in creating logos. Just something to consider."

Some of my clients don't like the work displayed in my portfolio, but I've designed logos / graphics for universities, software companies, real estate companies and everything in between. One of my most notable clients is the YMCA.   I went to school and have an associates degree from the Art Institute. I personally believe that it's not necessary to go to school for design if you have a deep passion.   My website is https://www.JacobWilliamsonDesign.com. I'm currently doing some small maintenance to the site/ uploading more content.  And recently I was accepted to dribbble!"

As you mention yourself, I'm actually attempting to do this without any sort of degree.  If I were to think of a good article I'd love to read, it might be in regards to freelancing.  I'm also personally having difficulties deciding on what I'd like to focus on in terms of design.  Whether I should focus on one type of design like Typography, Logo Design, eBook/Book or Magazine covers and of course Package Design too.  Or maybe I'm over-thinking it, and should learn as much as I can about every type of design?"

Ask him/her how to counter such objections - they'll be familiar with your situation and being in such a position (sales), should be very well how to counter objections.  Also I'd consider having the design firm pitch your stake holders and whomever possible on the advantages of the re-branding.   Just because they got ""the sale"", doesn't mean they are done selling.  That's a very fair thing to request of them - and no they shouldn't charge you.  This is a continuation of the sales process, that and if they can assist with buy-in internally, they stand a better chance of landing any/all future work."

Present your new solution with reasons why it solves their problem more effectively.  I would start by focusing on the glaring issues with the current presence without the use of opinion - be factual and give examples.
logodesign,2xlmko,BearCommander,6,Sun Mar 1 21:41:28 2015 UTC,"The logo mark is way better by a long shot. You really cleaned that up and it looks much more modern and professional.  One catch is that your shadow is inaccurate. When a piece of paper is folded over, the paper corner gets further away from the paper as you get towards the point of that corner so that the shadow is more offset from the corner than it is from the point where it folds.  I found a real world example to illustrate what I'm trying to describe here. It shows how the shadow width decreases towards the fold.  What I would recommend other than that is to maybe track the letters more closely together and perhaps consider a non italicized font. The reason I don't like the italics here is that the angle of their slant doesn't match the leading slant on the A in the logo mark and it looks disjointed, but if you made the text slant further to match that angle it would look worse because the slant would be too extreme."
logodesign,2xlmko,nicetriangle,3,Sun Mar 1 22:12:28 2015 UTC,I'd lose the Italics. The mark is much better.
logodesign,2xlmko,designgoddess,2,Mon Mar 2 06:08:09 2015 UTC,"A good logo generally only has 1 focal point or ""hook"". This one has 2: the fold and the road. It adds confusion to what ""point"" the logo is trying to make."

logodesign,2xlmko,Acidflux,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"I really like the logo. It's come a long way!  I'd spend a little more time working with the Kerning of your letters. The letters O I and M look way closer together than the AUT AGE or parts. I'd manually position each letter a little closer together and try to find a balance. You might also make the gap between the O and I a bit wider so that it's more clearly two words.   The gap between the A and I at the top could also stand be a touch wider. It might work with a lower-case I as well, and that might help it be more identifiable as an I instead of L without having to use a serif style font, which would mess up the balance of the AI you have going on right now.  A critical element to focus on logos especially is the scaling. How will it translate onto a billboard? AT-shirt? What about a hat? A business card? What if the customer wants embossed black ink for their business cards and you have to create a single-color version? Right now, as you make it smaller and smaller, the fold in the A becomes more of a red dot than a folded corner.   Also, as awesome as that shadow is, that's now a 4 color design if you spot-color print it. You save a TON of cash for the customer if you can make work with 2 color swatches. Does the folded corner really* need to be there? I think the AI with the perspective road is very strong on its own. I think the logo would stand alone without the folded-corner element, and removing that element would make the entire logo more ""readable.""   Have you considered making the dashes in the ""A"" red? I would also do a version where you change the red to black and the grey to black outline so that there's a single-color variant for business cards and black-and-white publications (newspaper, fliers, etc).  That's all I got."

Here is another I didn't submit but I like this one the most. What do you think about this one? I feel eliminating that corner lets me achieve the same concept with only two colors (if I remove the shadow) and in conjunction with the road I think this almost creates the image of a tuxedo that could imply dressing up your car. My concern Is this too many focus points for a logo? I mean this is pretty simplified
logodesign,2xoxct,trendykendy,2,Mon Mar 2 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about your company, so I don't know what you are trying to convey with your logo.   To me, the fact that the letters in Media are much thicker than the letters in Entropy is bothersome. I don't know why, but it feels slightly awkward. Also, the ""O"" in Entropy looks like the top of a pinwheel with the ""i"" right below it, but it is ever so slightly off center to bother me as well. However, if you were to make Media narrower, the i and the O could line up well enough to look like a pinwheel while keeping both words centered. Not sure if that is what you were going for or not though"

Without a design brief, or at the very least a description of the company - we have no way of knowing what the design intentions are.  Does entropy media sell candy? Advertisements based on pinwheels?  Why is there a gradient on your pinwheel?  Maybe it's not a pinwheel, maybe it's a lens iris?  The point is, your logo tells me nothing useful about your company.  It fails to convey meaning beyond the text.  You would be better served with a text-only logo in that case.

Design is about being bold and creative while your type is just not doing that, I dont necessarily mean go for a frivolous or ornamental font but pick something that really communicates what the personality of your design group.

I need to say two things - first, this is my first design whatsoever, to be honest. And the second - still I'm really happy you said it looks like you can just blow it away.   Why, you ask? Because that was the thing, the idea, I was aiming to do. Well, the goal was not exactly the ""blowable"" feeling, but I indeed wanted something light and maybe elegant and simple. I may not really reached it, but I was (considering my skill and experience) close. But be sure I haven't understood your opinion as a compliment, I just pointed out the light feeling.  The typeface is my favourite OpenSans (but looks like Helvetica Neue, which I love). I will however try some typefaces with more... Character.  It will surely be hard to make a eye-catching and pleasing logo, that will be easily recognizable and still simple and elegant. Something that is far beyond my skill, I fear.  I will try, however.  Thanks again :)"

It is not requiring you to do any fancy illustration or wild graphic effects! So youre in luck!  Considering what you said about the look and feel youre going for I have a few things that will help you reach your goal within your current set of skills:   Look for a typeface that is TALL, these typefaces are often tall, slender and empowering because they denote the idea of something grand and elegant that stands without taking too much space.   Opensans while it may be your favorite font may not be your brands favorite font if you catch my drift. If you were designing for your own personal brand, id say go for it, but youre not. OpenSans or Helvetica for that manner do not signify any of the qualities you wish to express in their historic use. These fonts are often times used for signs, manuals and maps because of their easy readability and ability to resonate with almost any audience, rich or poor, smart or dumb. They offer information rather than excellence (even though they offer extreme excellence in their uses) You are as you said ""close"" because you KNOW what you want, and like I said before, its easier to attain than you think, i will link you this: freebiesbug .com where you can find a HUGE variety of fonts and styles. use it to your advantage.

If you need to use the peel back effect, look at how google does it with their app icons (news, keep, docs). Good luck!"

I stand by my opinion that your logo does not have internal cohesion between the wordmark and the pictogram, and within the pictogram between the tree and the smoke. Now that i see the product i believe even more that the logo does not properly represent the product or its appeal. The product is modern, geometric and exclusive, but the logo doesn't represent any of these values."

Not too big of a deal but the M and 'design' aren't aligned correctly, not sure if you did that on purpose but if you tried using this on a more even background I think it would look off. There's something about the M itself that I don't like. I think it might be too wide for one, and the middle section is too short.   It's easy to slap something onto a mockup or a cool picture and get good reactions, but I think you need to work on the logo itself a little more. Think about why you're making each decision that goes into it."

Anyway, I think you're actually on a good track but you need to think about proportions and making the logo universal. Usually you want to limit your colors to 1-3, and you want something that can be identified even when it's really small. I think the sword is a good shape you can use considering your name, but think more about incorporating the X because traditionally swords did not have X shaped hilts."

logodesign,2vq6ff,LuisFaus,3,Fri Feb 13 03:12:16 2015 UTC,"Are you asking as someone who wants to use the logo or as the designer who created it? The execution is nice, but the concept of a stock logo is all wrong. Why would a company want to buy a logo that's already being used by another company, and could potentially end up being used by many more? This creates all sorts of problems for both the design industry and the companies using the logo.  Even if the logo could only be used by one company (that part is unclear from what you linked), buying a stock logo skips so many important steps in arriving at the right brand for a company, and the price definitely misrepresents the value of professional logo design."
logodesign,2vq6ff,mgodseydesign,-1,Fri Feb 13 08:17:05 2015 UTC,"While I completely agree with all your points, I think these stock logos appeal to more serial entrepreneurs testing the market with small niche businesses that have low start-up costs and often short life spans if they don't hit a good market. Someone testing the market won't want to drop $5,000+ on professional branding."

I would recommend either adding extra tracking between the characters to match the space around the i  or change the bug itself to match the tracking that is already used.  It can be difficult to make a wordmark combined with a graphical element read properly without losing the overall message. You might consider using the graphic element as a secondary feature.

logodesign,2uucmi,dissentwa,3,Thu Feb 5 05:24:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a designer, just interested in design.i find the font choice odd. The AS gives a retro-futuristic feel, the bottom font gives a retro 80s feel and the wreath and crown give a classic turn of the century feel. Kind of clashes for me.  For others you may want to let us know what kind of brand it would represent and link to a non transparent version."
logodesign,2uucmi,hitmyspot,2,Thu Feb 5 08:42:57 2015 UTC,"My critique:   1) There are four elements to this logo (crown, wreath, initials, text). All of the four elements are in completely different aesthetic styles and they do not work together. If you're set on using all four, at least stylize them so they work together and mesh into a single symbol.  2) Wreaths are very overused in logo designs and as such they're seen as kitschy or played out by many. The wreath cheapens the design and makes it feel borrowed and unoriginal. Same goes for the crown.  3) The initials and written text create a sense of redundancy. Either give us the initials or the entire company name. Giving us both just splits up our attention and we end up engaging with the symbol less.  4) All in all, there is too much going on. 4 separate components is too much here.  What I would do:  1) Decide between either the initials or the text to be the final logo. If you choose the initials, remove the period and work more on the shapes to make them a bit more recognizable.   2) I would personally scrap everything but the text at the bottom. I think the script is pretty cool and unique and it would look at home on a t-shirt. On it's own it is recognizable, legible, and displays restraint. I would maybe make the lines a bit thicker to give it a more substantial feel, but that's my personal preference.  TL;DR: Scrap everything but the text at the bottom. Read above to understand why."

My critique of this as just a logo is that none of the elements of the logo really come together. you should pick either the style of the A.S and have a modern wreath, crown and wordmark, or pick a classic style, and replace the hand-lettering, the A.S, and the simplified crown."

logodesign,2uk5vn,thewarehouse,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"At first I saw 'vape free' until I actually saw the word.   Definitely steer away from any shisha imagery, out of context it could be misconstrued as a bong.   Steer away from flames or any combustion imagery, vaping doesn't involve lighting anything and it'll look like you're involved in cigarettes rather than vapes.   Personally, I'd go with the second one. It's legible, and classy, without giving the wrong impression."

logodesign,2uk5vn,JimmerUK,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, it needs to be a lot clearer that it's not flames.   I'd have the words 'Vape Tree' so it's legible. Then use the stylised Ego from the second in the middle of the words with vapour to make the 'leaves' of the tree.   Don't use clouds, I don't think it'll come across, plus if you make them recognisable as clouds it might be mistaken for cloud data services.   Use vapour tendrils and it should all come together nicely."

It takes me 40-80 hours to design a logo, and heres why: Usually when designing, I start off with a design brief - essentially a list of questions that helps me figure out what the logo is supposed to do, who it's for, and how it will be used.  Then I'll brainstorm and make a mindmap. Then I'll pick out some of the best ideas, and develop those further by drawing about 50 quick small rough thumbnails.  Then I'll pick some that best fit the goals outlined by the design brief, and start developing them on the computer. (usually only 2 or 3 are any good at this point - the quick thumbnailing with a pencil helps me weed out all the shitty ideas quickly, before i hit the labor intensive computer stage) Here's some quick pointers:  If the design works in black and white, then it will work in color.  Keep it simple.  Avoid gradients.  Don't mix fonts unless you REALLY know what your doing.  Fonts in the same family are ok. (Helvetica regular and Helvetica Condensed)  Good luck!"

Based on your short description I would definitely go with #3, love the logo with the music note, it's very noticeable and distinguishing.   Edit: Also I just want to say after looking up a Sistrum I thought that was pretty clever in #1, but like I just had to do, looking up a sistrum to get the logo isn't something you would really want. With #3 after looking it up it's also more clear why you used an eye in the logo, but that is very acceptable symbolism, just as if someone questioned why Starbucks has a mermaid in their logo. Great job with this design."

For me, a logo has to have an instant, semiotic understanding for it to resonate as 'good', and this just looks like a clip art picture of a rocketship. It looks neat, but I don't think it is very well executed as a logo.   I also don't see much of the typography being implemented in a very interesting way so that is something I would work on too."
logodesign,2u0jox,Superduperbals,3,Thu Jan 29 01:10:07 2015 UTC,It looks good! I'd keep it straight. Have you try to put a thin circle around the logo? It could work

logodesign,2u0jox,2ne1dara,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:24:36 2015 UTC,"There's some other good advice here but I'll leave this: if there's motion in your logo... make it lead the eye back to the beginning of your logo. Look at the PUMA logo. The cat is jumping back, it creates a loop that makes your eye read it more than once. It really works well when the logo is near something else, so that the viewer's eye doesn't jump to something else. Like if your rocket ship was pointing right and it was in the lower righthand corner of a poster, the person might look at the logo and then scan what's next to it on the adjacent ad."

logodesign,2t624w,VAPossum,1 point,Wed Jan 21 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"Also, both the water and the tire ""overflow"" the edge of the picture.  The feet are completely contained within it.  This means two show action, one stalls (and the eye sticks there, too).  I'd vote for the tread of a running shoe, either one large one, or a trail of them, that is cut by the edge of the area as well. That gives you a feel of action in each block, and takes the  eye completely around the logo.  You might also consider making the running area a somewhat lighter version of the same color, so that it's not quite so weighted in comparison to the others."

Successful company logo design provides information about the company through its main elements: colors, icon, and texts.

The logo achieves these qualities through what is often called a ‘hook,’ something that draws the eyes in to look at it while suggesting uniqueness."

Try to figure out how you can get across what the service is as clearly as possible with as few elements as are necessary.  If you took out the text at the bottom, would it be clear what the product was?  It took me a moment to figure out that the shape in the ""girl"" circle was an S.    IMHO, this is a great example of a social networking logo.  It's clear that the service is about talking to each other because of the simple overlapping speech bubbles.  Here's a networking logo with the universal healthcare symbol broken down into lines representing a sense of interconnectivity.  Try and simplify - pick one element to focus on and play with it so you can figure out how it's supposed to represent the service.  Have fun!"

Badge style logos are hot right now, so go out and look for some inspiration.  The way I approach design is to make 5-10 different designs and try to compare what works on each of them. Refine your design decisions from there and then iterate on that design, making 5 more slightly different designs.

I think this is a good place to start, but you have a long way to go before your design will stand out from the crowd. I would suggest spending time brainstorming more and thinking about how the name of the company can be incorporated into the design of the logo.

First of all, I will assume this is for a real company and not just a proyect. So as far as my taste goes, logos should be simpler. The reason behind this is to make it reproducible, printable and memorable (if those are even words). The most important is memorable, if a logo has too many elements it will be too complicated for a person to asociate it immediatly with the brand it represents. Also I feel like the Name is too small in comparison to the logo, this would not mind for a stablished brand but for a starting bussiness the name is very important. I dont know if the ""Z"" means something, but if it doesn´t then drop it. Leave either the Z or the bull, I feel like both is too much. Anyway as I said, I am product designer not grapich, so some one might give a better insight. btw, the execution is really nice, looks good in the mock up, and feels warm, but as I said I would keep it simple."

logodesign,2pef2v,drmyersii,7,Mon Dec 15 21:43:30 2014 UTC,"Firstly, I would say look for another non-literal design of the logo. If you look around you will notice that many many MANY companies use a very similar mint to the one that you use. It may be difficult but I think in the end you will come out with a more creative and unique logo.   Secondly, I would say that I feel like there is a disconnect between the logo and the font, they just don't seem to mesh together to create a cohesive and wholesome visual. It's difficult to offer any further suggestions as to images or typography since there is no background of the company itself and what they do.  All that being said, keep trying different looks, styles and combinations!"

logodesign,2pef2v,travisjd2012,1 point,Tue Dec 16 14:47:10 2014 UTC,"Think of something that stems from the literal meaning.

You should break from that."
logodesign,2pef2v,akidneythief,6,Sun Dec 21 19:23:11 2014 UTC,"I think you've got a good start but if you want it to stand out you need to hammer it out a little more. If you've got time have a look at this video. This guy explains his concept and technique really well. I realize you might not use the software he uses so don't worry about that. Just watch the video and see how he explores his concepts.   The minty leaf is an obvious choice BUT that doesn't make it a bad one. The execution of the leaf is what's important. When you start to think about the logo think about how it will be perceived by your consumers. Who is your target market? What kind of logo would they like to see? What might catch their eye? How does that apply to the leaf and how can it transfer to your font choice?   You color choice is also standard. That's not bad. Its just . . . well standard. One thing you'll read about when choosing a color is to look at your competition and choose a color that stands out against them. A good example is the Starbucks logo. Would you choose green for a coffee shop? No, you'd likely choose brown. But the Starbucks logo works!  Personally I would drop the rounded edge font. I believe the last logo you showed used a san serif font which is a step in the right direction. I think the font is a bit too bold so maybe choose a sans serif font that isn't so thick.    Anyways this hopefully will spark some ideas and push your idea further!"

logodesign,2pef2v,Oldspooneye,2,Tue Dec 16 18:04:50 2014 UTC,"Yup, different typefaces can give different impressions, and great logos convey some sense of what the company or product is about.  As for the 'non-literal' advice you've gotten elsewhere, since it's for Software Development, you might try exploring how that overlaps with the mint concept. Development makes me think of new growth, so you could show a sprouting seedling, for example. Maybe there's a way to make an M look like something software-related, and have it be a minty green color? I dunno, just some things to get you started.  The ideas you have here will get the job done, but if you want to push it to the next level I'd keep playing with concept :)"

Its NATO code is BZ.  BZ is a glycolate anticholinergic compound related to atropine, scopolamine, hyoscyamine, and other deliriants. Dispersal would be as an aerosolized solid (primarily for inhalation) or as agent dissolved in one or more solvents for ingestion or percutaneous absorption.  Acting as a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at postsynaptic and postjunctional muscarinic receptor sites in smooth muscle, exocrine glands, autonomic ganglia, and the brain, BZ decreases the effective concentration of acetylcholine seen by receptors at these sites. Thus, BZ causes PNS effects that in general are the opposite of those seen in nerve agent poisoning. CNS effects include stupor, confusion, and confabulation with concrete and panoramic illusions and hallucinations, and with regression to primitive, involuntary behaviors such as floccillation and disrobing.

logodesign,2pc9ad,radumazilu,3,Mon Dec 15 07:23:32 2014 UTC,"Maybe try writing down any words you associate with coffee, like warm, cozy, bitter, or if in the other direction stained, jittery, tired. Then start sketching anything that shows that, such as the steam from the coffee, or a coffee ring left behind on the table.  Doing that usually helps me when starting out, if none of it is used, it can start to give you different ideas from things you produce. Sketching out tons of ideas is very helpful rather than to try and come up with one perfect idea."
logodesign,2pc9ad,bangbangwut,3,Mon Dec 15 11:54:16 2014 UTC,"Ran into this problem a few years back while working on some branding for a coffee shop, and I was trying to do the same thing you are (avoid the generic associations with coffee).   Unfortunately we tested a bunch of different logos with people (including a rosetta latte art type thing), and very few people, if any, associated these unconventional logos with a coffee shop. We eventually went with a logo that had a cup in it, but it was more abstract than the proportions of a real cup, and the mug was not the focal point of the logo. If you experiment with different iterations while keeping those 2 points in mind, I'll bet you'll come up with something that you're happy with."

logodesign,2p7hz4,hangman_style,3,Sun Dec 14 14:34:43 2014 UTC,"I remember seeing a logo design process for Tor, a sci-fi imprint for (IIRC) Random House (see edit below), on their website. It was pretty interesting.  I think any iconography that evokes 'speculative fiction' could work equally as well for fantasy and science fiction, so no need to try to fit two symbols in unless you find something that works really well as such a pair.  I like how subtle the E is (and the planet/rocket equilibration) in the bottom-right logo. Like /u/qwya suggested, I think indicating a literal leading edge (although I do not think it has to be of an aerodynamic wing; presumably the magazine was named that to represent progress of technology, and/or the production of new fiction, and to evoke 'cutting-edge' [of a blade]) could help.  Ultimately, an important thing is the culture of the magazine as distinct from other spec-fic magazines (If, Galaxy, and so on) - is it playful? Literary? Fast-paced? Exclusive? Any of these traits would shape the feeling you want your logo to give someone looking at it.

However I suggest hitting the sketching phase again and just draw/sketch nonstop. Anything that comes to mind that fit descriptors you and your client needs the logo to represent. When sketching don't stop to analyze ideas. Nothing is good, or bad at this stage, just ideas.    That said...  To me the logo reads more like a gavel than a sledgehammer. When I think of sledgehammers I think big, forceful, momentous, impacting, and destructive etc. Even in your description you state a need for a ""striking"" logo. Something powerful, possibly loud (visually). To me that signifies expanding. Think how forces/sounds reverberate/echo outward. Of course you can choose how literal you want to take the notion of striking.   Even when sledgehammers are going to town slamming into things you might think ""but Timewarp, it is contracting/closing space as it hits stuff"". No dude, that sumbitch is smashing shit, making dents, creating holes, etc to create more space for it's fucking self. It's a muthafuckin' sledgehammer, it can't be contained, and it needs no man... wait wut? Simply put it is expanding its influence through anything that dares to get in the way. I realize your client probably just means ""eye-catching"", when they say striking, but that is lame because you are dealing with a badass sledgehammer here.  Unfortunately the current size/proportion, and placement make it seem wimpy, and ineffective for the object it represents. Also instead of being expansive, it is closed. Self-contained and inward. Doesn't come off as striking visually. You have a striking contrast (black/white), but the visual/theme itself does not have the same impact. It's a sad little sledgehammer probably having identity issues. It does not want to be wielded by Judge Judy (although she too is a badass), it wants to be wielded by a dude that would kick Thor's ass."

logodesign,2oh4ua,alreed1014,3,Sat Dec 6 18:07:04 2014 UTC,"I think the guy (presumably meant to be you!) at the bottom looks good, but on the lettering, the lighting looks too forced.  It looks like your average gradient that any user could make in a graphics program. I would flatten the lighting, or give it a top light rather than a radial in the middle.  But that's just my opinion, I don't do this for a living, but I've done the odd design job. I'm sure other users here could give a better critique.   ""Flat design"" seems to be an in thing at the moment, and is how I've worked before; however I think it's important to still somehow give that ""lit"" look due to your occupation. So I think a balance perhaps needs to be found.  To follow this idea, I'd try making a whole load of different versions with varying gradients on the lettering, radial and linear, at different angles, and pick the best to work from there."

logodesign,2o3gx1,LeoFromTheTribe,3,Tue Dec 2 23:19:39 2014 UTC,"Hey LeoFromTheTribe,  That's a cool concept. I like it. There could be some work done to it, but the concept itself is solid. The main work would be in terms of making the additions feel like they're part of the letterform. Right now, they feel a bit too incongruent. And while you're at it, there might be some nicer Gs you can use from other typefaces. The current letterform probably looks fine in body copy, but blown up to display size, it doesn't have the slick finesses for a bold job like this.  As for rotation, I would recommend keeping it how you have it now. In its current form, you see the G, and then notice the glasses. Perfect. But if you rotate it, you'll see the glasses, and then... well, I don't know. I doubt that many people would pick up on the G. At least not as many people as would pick up the glasses in your original concept. That's just pure speculation on my part, though.  tl;dr Cool concept, but could just use some fine tuning with the nitty gritty.  Thanks for sharing!"

logodesign,2o3gx1,ehlfeh,2,Wed Dec 3 01:35:34 2014 UTC,"I agree with GusGorman  I think the orientation of your logo is good as is. You want your g to be read first as it is more important for your name to be associated with it. The glasses are a unique fine, similar to the well-known FedEx logo with the hidden arrow.   Overall, I think this is a great logo! I recommend looking for another g, stick with sans serif because you're almost there!  Good Luck and thanks for sharing!"
logodesign,2o3gx1,MJDeebiss,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:11:44 2014 UTC,"As soon as I read r/jailbreak and then looked at the logo I IMMEDIATELY got handcuffs and not glasses. Might be something worth playing with? Maybe handcuffs with lenses to make nerdy glasses? Might be a cool little logo. Good work!  Edit: And also obviously keep the handcuffs/lenses aimed at the lowercase ""g"""
logodesign,2o3gx1,wh1pla5h,1 point,Wed Dec 3 12:50:44 2014 UTC,"You'll want the ""circles"" in the g to be the same so that it actually looks like glasses. In addition, since it won't be rotated, you'll need to add a feature to make it clear that it's not only a g but also glasses. For example, adding a nose or swish of hair or smile or some other feature that is unique to you."
logodesign,2o3gx1,GusGorman,1 point,Wed Dec 3 19:31:47 2014 UTC,"I have to disagree about using circles for the letterform. It would stop looking like a G. It will either stop looking anything like a letter, or worse, start looking like an 8. There's are reasons why type designers don't use circles for Gs. The letterforms are designed for recognition and readability. Those are highly desirable traits in a logomark such as this.  I like the idea to add another facial feature, but I would only recommend it if it uses LeoFromTheTribe's first initial. Otherwise, if it was just a purely graphical design element, it would further obfuscate the idea that there's something to be read in the logo."
logodesign,2o3gx1,wh1pla5h,1 point,Thu Dec 4 14:53:32 2014 UTC,"Then the whole concept is dead. It simply will not carry the concept of glasses if it does not look like glasses (as it currently does not). And I disagree that you can't make a g with circles. I'm looking at the chrome incognito ""spy"" right now, and you could easily turn the glasses sideways and it would look like a g. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've seen lowercase g's drawn like that in several typefaces."
logodesign,2o3gx1,GusGorman,1 point,Thu Dec 4 15:19:31 2014 UTC,"Nah, that's silly to brush off the whole concept as dead. We're just talking about making a design that can communicate the letter G and some glasses. That's hardly insurmountable. All it's going to take is some time and finesse to do it properly. Doing two circles doesn't seem like the right approach. Not only doesn't it look like most proffesionally designed letterforms for G, but two circles also don't look like glasses. Other than really old glasses, or hipsters trying to recapture the old look, eyeglasses are never circles. They are more dynamic, and complex. Much like the various G letterforms, eyeglass designs vary. That's why I'm certain that there's a design that can fit both styles into the one element."
logodesign,2o3gx1,wh1pla5h,1 point,Thu Dec 4 16:53:15 2014 UTC,"It's a symbol that accurately portrays the idea. So what if it looks like old-school glasses? What's important is that the idea is carried across to the viewer. Just like how symbols for tvs are always shown with antennas, despite the fact that tvs haven't had antennas since like the early '90s."
logodesign,2o3gx1,GusGorman,1 point,Thu Dec 4 17:15:38 2014 UTC,"What's important is the kind of brand LeoFromTheTribe is trying to create and communicate. If and oldschool style of eyeglasses is what fits him and his needs, then that very well could work. But without that information, you can't brush such a broad stroke like that. You probably won't see a lot of Sony icons using antennae on their TVs. They're modern, hi-tech, and a premium brand. The design needs to match the brand, not the other way around."

If I understood the logo idea, then I believe it should be replaced but in all honesty there is much more to it.  To give your new company a proper logo what is the motivation or feeling behind it? Consider down the line what you may evolve or even expand to with your products.   Assuming John forester is the company, Why not a unique style or logo with just that name that can be branded on the bags them selves, website, etc.   Do you have any other sketches? Is the logo worth taking time to improve for you?"

What would help is to see what your bags look like or show us examples of bags others have made that are similar to yours. The reason for this is to get a feel for what type of company you are.   Don't take the criticism too personally. It's better you do sort it out now than later.   Remember this logo is going to be on the bags. I personally wouldn't want this logo on me.   Pm me if you want to talk more about it.   You should also consider getting a designer to do your logo and you stick to making bags. Good luck with the company

logodesign,2noii3,UltraChilly,1 point,Sat Nov 29 12:04:33 2014 UTC,"The colors are a good combo.  I can see the antlers/branches, which definitely say outdoors.  However, beyond that, this doesn't say anything to me, and it looks very weird.  It doesn't have to say bags (what kind, btw? I love bags), but it looks like it's trying to say something, and I can't see what it is.  I would either go very easy to interpret, or very simple.  It doesn't have to be equally weighted on left/right or top/bottom, but the weight distribution should make sense.  Here's a couple versions of a quick and dirty option: http://i.imgur.com/je9iDkw.png http://i.imgur.com/Lw7WvhN.png    It's still got curves (and thus flow), it's abstract but not so abstract you can't see a bag (backpack) in it, and it's more adaptable (the top ""straps"" can be removed, [replaced with antlers[(http://i.imgur.com/g5frXRC.png), etc.).  Since any company that makes bags is bound to eventually expand into other products, adaptability is handy.  My version is also rather bland, and the one square corner is probably a bit cliche these days, but I wanted to show you something inspired by your logo, but that might be more accessible.  Also: right now, you have very few spots that could be considered serifs or similar.  This is a good thing!  Since you're going to be making bags, you'll probably be having your logo embroidered a lot, and it can be quiet difficult to stitch those effectively and attractively.  (Any fine stitching can suffer that, but a friend who sells promotional items like aprons and shirts says it's the serifs and fine points that are the bane of his existence.)"

logodesign,2ndyjz,mrsnakers,1 point,Thu Nov 27 19:35:43 2014 UTC,Fine Gardening Design doesn't sound appealing. It doesn't sound extravagant. It sounds just mediocre. As for the logo the heavy lines draw my eyes away from the text under Fine and your name on the business card. Of course this is just a layman opinion.

logodesign,2nd1sn,akidneythief,2,Tue Nov 25 12:35:19 2014 UTC,"I think you've done a great job. The inscription doesn't read as well as a thumbnail. But I tell you I get tired of hearing that. In reality when do you ever see your logo the size of a penny? I think it looks great when its at a readable size and I think if you messed to much with it to accommodate the thumbnail legibility you might lose the great look you have already. Having said that if the logo is going to be seen mostly in a small thumbnail format then by all means address it. But if its going to be on a website, facebook, printed material, I'd leave it alone."

The circular shadow is pretty unnecessary.  The gradients are probably the worst part of the logo overall, if your adamant on using gradients do it subtly.  And professional haha. Thats like saying a baby that kicked his dummy across a field once, a professional premiership football player."
logodesign,2mzm6a,I-Molest-Sheep,15,Fri Nov 21 15:07:56 2014 UTC,"I'll say what others are probably thinking: That is neither a good nor a professional logo and if it's indicative of your portfolio you are not going to do well.

logodesign,2mzm6a,thewarehouse,5,Fri Nov 21 15:33:44 2014 UTC,"Would be good if you said why it isn't good rather than just criticising it, but thanks."
logodesign,2mzm6a,thewarehouse,9,Fri Nov 21 19:37:47 2014 UTC,"Fair enough!  Criticism about this starts with noticing. Notice any thing about this logo. It's all wrong. Why? Well:   The letterspacing is rough. Putting them so close to each other creates really awkward and uninteresting spaces. Look at the middle of the B bumping up against the K. And the super thick/thin variation that happens there. But then the R doesn't create a complimentary shape on the other side. The compressed typeface looks like it's squished into the circle. It's claustrophobic. Actually it looks like you manually scaled it down horizontally. I can tell because the height of the bars is way taller than the width of the bars. Don't do that. It really throws off the carefully considered shapes of letterforms. There are certainly valid opportunities to reverse letters out of shapes - this is not a great way to do it. It looks crowded. The background texture is confusing at any level except extremely large. There's not enough color and variation for it to be interesting. It just looks like a smudge of shapes. Also that polygon look is pretty flash-in-the-pan right now. It does not have longevity. It's already overused and kind of lazy - and even when it is used it's usually implementing more color. The color, speaking of which. Just a grey logo? So dry! I know designers tend to have very austere color palettes. That's fine. But this looks like you just couldn't think of a color. There's no good clever visual reason for things to be reversing out of a circle with a pattern. It doesn't look cool enough to justify it. If it did, it would be completely fine. But it doesn't.   Sorry for the short reply earlier - I don't know your history. Assume you're fairly young, perhaps still in school? Without trying to sound too harsh, let me suggest you continue to look into basically every element of graphic design and typography and ask yourself it the logo you posted does it well."
logodesign,2mzm6a,zachwad22,2,Fri Nov 21 21:49:21 2014 UTC,"Really appreciate this, thank you!"
logodesign,2mzm6a,zachwad22,7,Sat Nov 22 17:23:48 2014 UTC,"I'll go ahead and give some constructive criticism instead of blindly upvoting the guy above me.  The poly pattern within the circle is interesting. Why is it there? Do you want it to be an important part of the logo?  Try emphasizing it more. Try multiple iterations of it using different colors and different poly shapes.  The size differences between the letters is also interesting. Again, why? If you can come up with a good reason, push it. Make it really important or not there at all.  Watch spacing. Is the awkwardly small space between the first two letters important?  Have them touch fully instead, or alter then by hand to integrate into each other.  What do the letters stand for?  Consider this: if they don't stand for something very concrete, or they stand for a really cool and unique brand name, maybe it would be more interesting to abandon trying to keep them legible and unaltered, and instead really modify and stylize them. Anybody can lay out three glyphs of a typeface. A really good designer can make them his own by either laying them out with such perfection and grace that it works as a logo, or by altering and hand-editing them to the point they become truly his own (and to tell a secret, the second way is much easier and more fun).  Good luck.  I'd love to give you more specific criticism once you have gone through a few more experimentations if you PM me to remind me. Logo design is really hard (and I struggle with it) but I can certainly critique it from a pure design standpoint."

It's just too think and heavy... Unbalanced. The typeface is too thin for the thick mark under it. The spacing is awkward as well.

One critique is that it really looks like brass knuckles to me, or evokes them. However, depending on your angle, that may be a plus.  I also have to agree with whoever said that there's a very big thick area in the middle.  That traps the eye, and it's so heavy that the ""doctor"" gets lost.  But I do see where you're going, and I think it can be a great direction.  Maybe turn the ""doctor"" on its side and use it to fill in the white space over the d?"

logodesign,2kka9b,MasterCharlz,2,Tue Oct 28 13:39:41 2014 UTC,"Right now the company is following material design principles so I think the shadows are admittedly part of the package for now... The design has versions with no shadowing though, so it should be able to last through this era."

logodesign,2kka9b,chadisfred,2,Tue Oct 28 15:14:15 2014 UTC,"I think this is a good start.    I will agree about dropping the long shadow. In it's place I think you should really focus on android material specs. the focus on layering and shadows is definitely a part of the L spec, but if you are going to commit to L, make sure you stay closer to the spec, then the idea behind the spec.  For example, the drop shadows you are using are not 90° and don't incorporate the 2 level shadow system in the L guidelines.  Also, utilize the icon grid they make available to you to really nail the look.  Again, I think you are on the right track. Just stay tight to those specs as much as you can.  I am also working a lot in L spec these days, and the amount of info available on how to achieve the design language will pave the way to a tighter design."

Keep in mind however that it is extremely difficult to transfer this effect in print applications.  One thing that I feel you could improve upon is the type choice. As of now, it does not reflect the shapes that you are using. I would suggest using a more geometric typeface such as Futura or any good alternates you come across. Additionally, the spacing between KAT and HOUSE creates and optical illusion making the nose seem like it's positioned more towards the right, even though it is centered.  The idea however is solid.

Don't ask for feedback and then be dismissive when you don't get the response you were hoping for.  Orange does set you apart from the rest of the blue based social networks (Tumblr, FB, Linkdin, Twitter) keeping in mind that blue is generally associated with business and technology.  I'd suggest making ""Owe"" Orange  and a complimentary blue for ""Yaa""    Your font choice is all wrong. You should be using a sans-serif font at minimum, maybe with rounded edges.  You should be balance a heavier weight and light weight in tandem to get the separation you want.     I get what you tried to do with ""we"" in ""we owe ya"".  No matter how clever you think it is, the majority of the populace is not going to make that connection, hell it took me a 30 seconds to figure it out why the ""We"" was in the circle and I'm graphic designer and i know to look for that shit.  You'd be better off visualizing the concept of the back and forth nature of ""owing"" someone."

It could be great as part of an infographic for a site or brochure though I'm not sure how it even ties into palliative treatments.  Not sure what the bottom icon represents. Which brings me to another concern, I'm not sure how any of the icons tie into relieving pain. Ambulances don't relieve pain... They transport. The heart icon symbolizes well-being, heart health, or heart attack, but doesn't say much, if anything, about pain relief/treatment. The doctor represents health care (in general), but doesn't really speak to pain therapy/treatment because it's so generic.  The type feels stiff and futuristic. I would explore other typefaces that feel a little more professional and human. Health care should be approachable and a tech-looking typeface doesn't convey that.  I would try for a more compact icon that represents pain relief/treatment. You may have to get more abstract."

logodesign,2iae35,scannerlicker,6,Sat Oct 4 17:09:23 2014 UTC,They are static and fixed graphic representations that reduce identity to a single visual form.   That's a good definition for a logo.
logodesign,2i8rpx,pattern2primes,12,Sat Oct 4 01:51:25 2014 UTC,Bold move to not use a logo from 1997 to 2000.   You had to open the bag to actually see if they were doritos.

logodesign,2i8rpx,DarkTri,1 point,Tue Oct 14 10:30:06 2014 UTC,"Overall, it's just arbitrary change for the sake of change.  For the 2005 to 2013 version, that drop shadow overpowers to the point that I can't see anything else. The notch in the D, the curve of the r, the curve on the crossbar of the t, the hook on the s and the fact that it looks italic compared to all the other letters, all going in different directions typographically. It's just a hot mess.  For the 2013 to present, where to begin. The type gets worse! Extremely disjointed. The D and the o's are WAY too wide. The rit is all smashed in there. The i and t are all stunted on top. The sharp points only on the s and nowhere else. It's just weird.  And I get that they're marketed to teen boys especially, but the flame/zap visuals come off as patronizing."

Wouldn't a font closer to a highway sign like ""interstate"" be more interesting to work off from? There are so many visual cues to roadways and the rich typography behind that. To use a plain old post-modern want to be futuristic ""go green"" type font is just cuing that your studio makes stereotypical web design. Your logo reminds me of some fruit juice packaging I see, and your droplets just remind me of a faux-environmental movement or solar panel company. I am not saying what you made is bad I just don't think it speaks to a design studio. Go on sites like pinterest to help build a better visual vocabulary."

A company like P&G sells products that each have their own interesting logos such as tide and bounty. People do not necessarily know about P&G but they know about Tide and Bounty. So a company like P&G may not need an interesting logo because of their products has a logo that stands on it's own.

I feel like that allows you to emphasize the ""will"" and/or ""love   ""Designs you will love"" ""Designs you will love""    I guess emphasis on the will makes it a bit agressive, but you get the idea.   Be careful with scaling on the ""Pixels"" the light weight of the font will suffer at smaller sizes, perhaps create a small version with a slightly thicker weight.

Just to give a ball park number, if the 2nd square away from the nearest is smaller by 20, the furthest one will be twice as far, so around 40.

We wanted to go with a style that was a bit heavier on the abstraction side. Our goal was for the logo to spark uncertainty/curiosity but make sense if we revealed the symbolism. The concept behind a bench being our logo makes a lot of sense, but the visual appeal of making it look obviously like a bench doesn't, so we tried to strike middle ground.

logodesign,2htwex,novalsi,2,Tue Sep 30 00:04:35 2014 UTC,"Here's their blog post about the new logo   Established in 2002, located in Warsaw (HQ) and Kraków, Poland, CD Projekt RED was born out of raw passion to video games. The studio’s founders–Michał Kiciński and Marcin Iwiński, both pioneers in video game distribution in Poland in the 90s, decided to employ their gaming industry experience in video game development. A lot of time has passed since 2002, and the studio’s logo remained mostly untouched. Until today.  The new logo is a combination of energy and passion for game-making the studio is known for. This is how Adam Badowski, CD Projekt RED’s Head of Studio, sees the change:   "" We are rebels and rebels are free. Just like birds. The Northern Cardinal is what we see ourselves in the industry: intrepid, bold and confident; flying high and aiming even higher. The colour, cardinal RED, is something that connects it with another bird, a mythological creature close to our cultural roots and heritage–the Raróg, a small firebird believed to bring luck to people. RED stands for energy, the inner fire that drives us; it represents something very close to everyone here in the studio–the creativity and passion we harness from within ourselves to make the best RPGs in the world. ""   Starting May 14th, the Cardinal logo will become the new, official logo of CD Projekt RED–it will accompany all official assets and will form the core of the studio’s visual identification."

Not vise versa.)  Your line of work.

A more consistent width of line would do so much for the logo. The crown uses a thinner line than the outside of the circle/badge, and the dog is rendered with multiple line widths for no real specific reason. A consistency in geometric vs. rough hand-drawn would also help. For example the dog's eye and most of the ear are perfect geometrical shapes, but then they are joined to erratic lines in the forehead and muzzle."

logodesign,2h8fux,TpointOF,6,Tue Sep 23 15:06:14 2014 UTC,"This is the worst, most incorrect infographic I have seen in quite some time. It is full of inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and takes no effort to establish that some of these relate to a UK only standpoint. It promotes disinformation, and should not be used as an example by any professionals. Lets delve into SOME of the bullshit...  It says Pepsi was named 'Brads Drink' till 1961. No, Pepsi became known as Pepsi Cola in 1893. Source  Google was never officially named backrub. It was nicknamed that by its creators during development, but upon its first release as a Stanford based search engine, it was known as Google. It was never known as Backrub when it became open to users. So, this isn't a rebranding. Most products undergo development names before their release. This shouldn't be on the list. Source  I also take issue with the Firefox example. It started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project under the codename Phoenix. In less then a year, due to trademark issues, they changed the name to Firebird. Once again, due to legal issues they were forced to change the name to Firefox, also in less than a year. I would argue that considering both of those names were used for less than a year, and long before the product had a chance to develop significant brand identity, I wouldn't necessarily consider this a rebrand. Not only do very few people know that firefox had previous names, very few people actually used it. I would consider this part of product development, since all the versions with previous names were ALPHAS and BETAS. Its not rebranding because the first official release was known as Firefox.  Considering this is from a UK site, I can 'slightly' forgive the Snickers issue, because it apparently was actually named Marathon in the UK till 1990. In the US, where it was invented, it was always known as Snickers. Its still bull shit, because that's not really a re-branding is it? They just started calling it what they do in the rest of the world. More of an Un-branding.  It says Starburst were called Opal Fruits until 1998, which is only true in the UK. So once again, I can 'slightly' forgive this. When it was introduced to the US in 1967 it was known as Starburst. Due to its heightened popularity overseas they decided to use the same foreign name, 'Starburst' in the UK, which was in 1998. Considering this was an initial brand title, it is also not a rebrand."

logodesign,2g6wui,GoogaNautGod,6,Sat Sep 13 03:29:55 2014 UTC,"While I'm not a fan of the colored one, I love the single colored version!  For both, I think the ""swish"" marks next to the tail and the paw above the ""g"" are unnecessary and can easily get lost and difference logo sizes and uses.  For the colored one, I would get away from gradients -- and why is ""Wag-ging"" split? I read it awkwardly because of the color change. Also, I think the dog's face needs work and the lines should be thinned down a bit. But again, my preference was the flat design!  Great work!"
logodesign,2g6wui,pleasebekidding,2,Fri Sep 12 12:44:44 2014 UTC,"The colored text looks pretty bad to be completely honest. Also the gradients are way too much and there is a lot going on in the logo. You have 3+ colors, the dog - with strokes - the paw and more. Try to cut it down more and the white logo is definitely on the right track but the silhouette is not great. Maybe try something using the top of the ""g"" as a tail or something like that."

logodesign,2fovs6,Parodyse,2,Wed Sep 17 04:45:11 2014 UTC,"I'd approach this one  a bit differently from the gradient mesh.  Mesh is an extremely powerful tool, but looking at the additional shadows and glows, I think this is built with some based colour gradient layers, and then those additional glows an shadows on top of the base layers.  I've included a screen shot of the original vs. the mock up I did using the additional glows and shadows method.  demo  Just my take..."

logodesign,2fo3b6,Cykadia,2,Sun Sep 7 02:13:02 2014 UTC,Ok so what I've found is essential to making a logo youre proud of is that you must give it a personality/purpose.  Right now while I like how this can relate to the idea of being a developer and using 'building blocks' as your tools of the trade I do nottt quite see the initials that you're clearly trying to get across.  Quality though? it looks very clean and professional which makes it look greatt. Its appealing but it's not meaningful. Also ... i also dont really see the J in your original.

logodesign,2f9wwf,lopalou,1 point,Wed Sep 3 00:06:30 2014 UTC,I used the Z from that font to create the base Z in the LZ monogram.
logodesign,2f9wwf,shewter,1 point,Wed Sep 3 02:01:25 2014 UTC,"I gotta admit, something looks off about it. If I'm looking at the z part of the logo, the outermost edges of the shape are angled as well (top left and bottom right). Maybe you accidentally sheared it the path?   IMHO, you should make the thickness off the logo as thin as the text. I think it would make it more uniform, because it seems you're going for that. Measure the width of the font and try to apply it to the logo."
logodesign,2f9wwf,shewter,1 point,Wed Sep 3 03:13:29 2014 UTC,"All the sides were designed to be either horizontal or at that upward angle. If I had the ends at a 90° vertical I don't think it would look as good, IMO. As for your second point I feel if I thinned out the logo it wouldn't feel as substantial when it's by itself, like in a watermark. But that's just my thoughts."

logodesign,2f9s0c,mibi,4,Tue Sep 2 16:37:21 2014 UTC,"Very cool effort. I really liked seeing your process. The creation of the Z by cutting out blade-edge shapes was really interesting, though I agree that it'd be too much, and I credit you with tossing a neat idea when you saw it wouldn't work perfectly. Unfortunately, I felt the same about your final design. It was clever--using a knife in the lettering--but it still didn't look right. It felt like the beginning of an idea. One of the reasons it doesn't work is that the blade handle has too organic of a shape. Without the backstory, the knife does not jump out at you, and it ends up looking and feeling awkward. Two blades coming out (to form the Z) would have been better IMO, but it still doesn't really reflect the words you listed for inspiration.  Also, you say the ZT logo is inside ""some oblong C shape"" which for many logos tends to be true, but I'm betting they would say it is a zero, and that zero even fades off into nothing--emphasizing zero again. But I agree with you that it is a logo that could benefit from a redesign."
logodesign,2f9s0c,still_thinking_,1 point,Tue Sep 2 20:05:28 2014 UTC,"Like the idea a lot, but I think if the shapes (e.g. blade) were a little sleeker it might have been nicer."
logodesign,2f9s0c,rmongoose,1 point,Sat Sep 6 21:52:12 2014 UTC,"This is a really cool idea and it was a good read. You have the right process and took the right approach. I wasn't a big fan of the final design though, I don't think the 'Z' was obviously a half extended knife. It looked like a blobby Z next to a nice clean, crisp 'T'.  How about instead of trying to use an entire knife (handle and blade), try using the distinct part of the knife that everyone recognizes? Just the blade. Or maybe there's no literal knife at all, perhaps it should just be a type logo that has the qualities of a knife. I think more exploration would be needed before something that outshines the competitors comes out."
logodesign,2f9s0c,sevencoves,1 point,Wed Oct 15 18:54:41 2014 UTC,This would not be legible on a knife where you have 1.5cm of space to work with.

I don't think I've ever seen somebody who went to the store and chose to buy a bag of Hershey's Kisses for consumption.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are popular somewhere, I'm just genuinely curious. That said, the kiss silhouette is a pretty good looking symbol to have.

I buy those pretty frequently if I want a cheap, sweet indulgence. But you might be right. The Kisses might be a bigger seller elsewhere in the world, or at certain times of the year. I know I eat a lot of green and red wrapped Kisses near Christmas time.  But that said, I think the Kiss is a more recognizable shape that the brown rectangle of a Hershey bar. I'm mixed on the little paper wisp coming out of the Kiss in the new logo. It feels like it extends too far out, but even then, if it was shortened to be flush against the edge of the logo, it'd still feel odd.  Pretty good logo though, imo."

Additionally, the mark itself feels very heavy right now, especially compared to the text.

logodesign,2eblai,thisdesignup,5,Fri Aug 22 23:09:20 2014 UTC,"Although open box logos have been done many times before, the cardboard is an interesting spin. However, you can only really tell it's cardboard in the first image when it is a pretty big image, has a texture, and a color. You can't rely on all those when it comes to a recognizable logo. Also I agree with /u/zero-irony, your vector version doesn't look that great with all the shading that was seen in the first one -- you can barely tell what's going on in that one. Also, it seems a lot like the flaps are too small when compared to the rest of the box. And why is one flip detached while the other is attached? As for the yellow background, yeah I think it's a little too dark, it looks like a mustard-y color and you could still go with yellow but you gotta mess around with it so it compliments the brown. Not trying to be mean but right now I can see the same colors I would find in a public restroom toilet.  Don't get me wrong, your lines and everything are clean (except I don't know why the left side of the box curves at the top) but I feel like you need to spend some more time thinking about what your business is all about and how you can express that with the logo"
logodesign,2eblai,Parodyse,4,Sat Aug 23 01:47:47 2014 UTC,"It's actually not very clear as to what the logo tries to represent. A box of ideas?

logodesign,2eblai,carmelag,2,Sat Aug 23 00:19:38 2014 UTC,"I'll try to help:   we are looking at the box from the side, with the flaps flatted out. it would be clearer if we were looking at it a bit from above, or if the flaps where less straight out. the 2-color version doesn't look like a box, because the sides of the box merge into a single white rectangle.  it takes mental effort to identifiy that it is a cardboard box, so it's more like a riddle than a logo. when scaled down, the waves of the cardboard in the flaps will be invisible. there is no balance between the ""weight"" of the box and that of the flaps. one is a solid white and wide and big and the other uses thin white lines and has tiny black areas."
logodesign,2eblai,carmelag,1 point,Sat Aug 23 09:39:52 2014 UTC,"Thank you, it did help quiet a bit.    I don't want to show any of the top because your not supposed to be able to see inside of the box. Unless you may have an alternative suggestion. I may try with a different angle and for sure test different flap angles.  I did notice that but didn't think much of it. I have an idea that I will try to see about differentiating the edge. Are you talking about the 2-color version or is the full color also troublesome? This was mentioned by one other person also but I am not sure. At 25% the waves still show up fine. I will test with webicon size and see if I can make it work. Thanks for pointing that out, I notice it now. My idea for differentiating the left edge may also solve this problem.   Thanks again, you've helped a lot. I've honestly just been staring at this too long that I needed some fresh eyes to look at it."

logodesign,2drr6s,Xx420xYol0xSW4GxX,13,Sun Aug 17 02:44:57 2014 UTC,"Definitely a design choice, not a mistake.  Adding the whitespace between the w's (which removes the red triangle) makes the overall shape much more clear while still maintaining an illusion of depth. It's a much better mark for it. To the casual observer it will look mildly interesting while being much more recognisable than the version with the red bit still intact.  Besides all that I've got to say that it feels like a completely safe, uninspired and tired design... What a shame."
logodesign,2drr6s,opzienbarend,13,Sun Aug 17 09:53:01 2014 UTC,Aren't you assuming the space between the black lines is supposed to be transparent? Maybe it is supposed to be white.

Look at the Japanese flag, is it one of the most well known flags and is often praised by vexillologists and designers, yet it is just a red circle.

In all those contexts, boardgames are the default, so there's no need to communicate that that is what you do (as opposed to apps, or gamification consultancy). It's almost a B2B case.  By contrast, the name is the most important thing of all, since that is what they need to remember to find you again. Including a board game piece like a meeple, dice or pawn dosen't help me stand out since dozens of similar logos already exist, and it would, if anything, make it harder to protect the IP.   Some (most) designers choose imagery heavy names: Wicked Grin Games, Clocksmith Games, Tinkerbot Games. The purpose is to use the image to help remember the name, the most important bit. Cromlyn means 'crooked glen' in Gaelic, but that's hardly a directly memorable piece of imagery, so short of creating a mascot, it's going to be text heavy."

I like Doha's. I feel like the typeface matches well and the shape is interesting. My main problem is how generic trees have become for logos.  From a purely visual standpoint, I like Baku's. The typeface seems fine. My biggest problem is how it's not really a logo. It doesn't represent or show anything at a glance. It would likely scale poorly. It's a bit of a cluster fuck to the eye as well.   Edit: only just saw the ""2020"" after it was mentioned. It's kind of cool, but a bit too hard to see.   I feel like Roma has the most solid concept. Showing the colosseum was a smart move. The typeface is fine, although I feel like I would have gone for something different.

I could be wrong, but that's where my mind goes.  I pretty much agree with all of your assessments. I'm probably most drawn to logos that use the olympic colors for sake of brand clarity, and among those I think I like Tokyo's and Baku's the best. Madrid's and Doha's are a bit too generic."
logodesign,2cpjrm,SoulSerpent,6,Fri Aug 8 17:04:09 2014 UTC,"Baku is my favorite, even though it took me a minute to see the ""2020"" in the design. Once I did it was even cooler. It felt like a graphical play on the olympic rings themselves.  Madrid was definitely my least favorite. It is too simple and it looks like it says ""20020"".  Rome was a nice try, but IMO it needed more work, or a little more thought put into it. It felt like they weren't really trying all that hard."

It literally feels like it could be any place on earth except a desert that borders a sea.

During that time, I noticed that London changed their logo from something that was acceptable to something I outright hated...at least until the games begun. During the games, they barely used the ""2012"" logo, but the jagged shapes were mainly used. Public outcry against it or not, but it worked out!  If I were to guess, it would just be money that prevents a solid logo and brand at the beginning... but I don't like that answer considering the millions you have to sink into the Olympic bid, let alone the possible billions in infrastructure cost."

I'd experiment with that color and some more shapes for the river. Maybe a longer perspective that goes from top to bottom with another squiggle or two.  • Tighten up the space between the two words and track out the individual letters a little bit.

Also providing a b/w version.  I also tweaked the hill/horizon line in the emblem a little bit. I really want to keep the emblem part as simple as possible so I didn't do anything to create more lines like extending or adding to the river.  The logo works well at small sizes IMO. It does get a little messy looking at it at favicon size (I'm trying just the emblem) but that's the only instance I could ever see the logo that small so I'm not too concerned with it. I'm a web designer and whenever I come across a logo that doesn't work at favicon size, I just create something simple and congruent that does. It's not hard.

Obviously, these are things you don't do to someone else's logo.  Logos are designed the way they are for a reason.  You don't do anything to them.  If it's just in general, when designing a logo, then I think it's crap.  I mean, if you didn't know the puma logo, you wouldn't know that it's ""distorted.""  So, if you're creating a logo that has a tall font, if it's that way from the start, then it's not ""distortion,"" it's just the style you've chosen.  I also don't agree with the box, outline, or frame suggestions.  I mean, you don't do it on every logo (you shouldn't do anything on every logo), but sometimes there are times you do want a neat, clean shape to use as a standalone logo and a box works for that.  And there are outlines on a lot of logos.

Secondly, it's not actually a logo. We'd call this a logomark because there is no typography or logotype. So you need to add some type in there. I think some clean all caps sans-serif tracked out a bit underneath it would look clean and attractive. But you'll have to try it yourself. Have some fun with it.  Thirdly, make this mark in illustrator. You're on the right track using the pen tool in PS, but you need it to be vector so that it's scaleable.

But at least make your PSD 300 DPI. It looks a little artifacty in the png you posted.  As far as font choice goes just keep trying things until one works. Anything clean and simple would look fine. Think about trying some with some curves to mimic the mark. But line up a bunch of different examples of font choices and see which one works the best. And then take a break from looking at it and come back to it with fresh eyes and make a decision. Or get other people's opinions.  BTW, it looks like a CM to me."

Either one thing will ""lead"" to another, or as it tapers off/goes to the edge of the page, something in the peripheral will be strong enough to draw the eye back into the ad.    Look at a lot of art for what I'm talking about.  It's one of those things that once you realize it, and get the hang of it, it can make a subtle-yet-huge impact on projects."
logodesign,2b07lj,nPoika,3,Fri Jul 18 00:45:51 2014 UTC,"1.a works better than 1.b mostly for the reason that breaking up ""building"" and ""design grad"" is a tad confusing at first. The period after grad helps, but still. 1.c is too average and feels dated. The shading on 2 is cool, but the backwards ""n"" is more distracting than compelling. Good idea though. Unfortunately I don't see the ""P"" enough on 3, and 4 through 5.d look like the abbreviated form of the word ""number"" (ie ""No.""). I think all the 7s are too bland for you since the 8s are so dynamic. I personally like 8.b more, but both are good, and I liked 9 a lot. My opinion is that the best are 1.a, 8.a, 8.b, and 9."

logodesign,2b07lj,CupcakeGoesRawr,2,Tue Jul 22 09:50:39 2014 UTC,"I don't know anything about the conventions of your industry, but marketing yourself as a ""grad"" seems strange. You're no longer looking for internships. Being a student isn't part of your life anymore. Sell yourself as what you are: a building designer. If you're a professional, it will be assumed that you have a degree of some kind.   For the actual marks, versions 4 and 5a-5d look like you're trying to incorporate some kind of degrees symbol, not combining your N and P. I think 1a and 1b are strongest. They're solid and clean and to me look most like something an architect would have. Many of the others look like you're a visual designer of some kind, print or web."

I think part of the fun of these comps will be the kind of fast pace of them (only 2 weeks, not a lot of deliberation time).  So, if you choose something you've already spent a lot of time perfecting, then that is no longer in the spirit of the ""rush"" of the competition.  However, I could see the value in having feedback, too.  So, I would say winners should be able to submit and get votes and feedback, but not win two weeks in a row, even if they have the most votes.    You can win again the following week :)"

Script typefaces exist (standard in most word processors), so Americans remain familiar with cursive (and blackletter).

logodesign,28k9yk,Kelruss,2,Tue Jul 1 19:25:56 2014 UTC,"Well, no, because it's a logo. What's a logo but a symbol for your company? A script typeface works fine, perhaps better, than a circle or a triangle or some geometric design. Johnson & Johnson (which appears in the OP graphic) is one of the oldest trademarks in the world - with virtually no change.  I think that's something to get into as well, Instagram and Titleist excluded, many of these are legacy brands that are almost synonymous with the product they sell. Though the graphic doesn't include Coca-Cola, that's perhaps the most widely-recognized brand in the world. Suppose Coca-Cola shifted their logo over to a serif or sans serif? I'd expect their profits to fall, because consumers recognize the brand with script. Take that away, and people might easily become suspicious of the product they were buying."
logodesign,28k9yk,GaslightProphet,-1,Wed Jul 2 18:20:59 2014 UTC,"A fair point. Yes, if you are already well known, then your script font is part of how your logo is recognized. It makes me wonder why Instagram chose cursive/script though, since they are rather new and have a young audience."

I don't think a little bit of glow is bad (though the current trend in logos is away from shadow and glow) but the glow definitely works better with your name than with the fox. And as far as the fox goes, it's definitely a nice simple image, and you've created something that I think will be easy to recognize. It will scale well, too.

Everyone keeps asking us what we want, but if we knew that we would have made it ourselves.   This is what good logo designers do. They find out what you want the logo to say about your business, group, clan, etc. It is impossible to make something without knowing what you want. If you do not tell the designer what you want they will still have to spend time figuring out what you want.   You are also wanting a bunch of people to give you ideas and then you would pay the person you like the best. Your essentially using everyone's time but only paying for one person's time. Just to let you know a lot of people will look badly upon that here.   Also the fact that your contest has no end date is really bothersome. But this goes back to looking for professional ideas from multiple people yet only paying one of those professionals."

logodesign,27glwp,still_thinking_,2,Fri Jun 6 14:30:01 2014 UTC,"No, I agree. The first one, especially, looks really good. The concept of the blocks works very well, and though it might seem a bit plain to you, with all the words below the symbol included, simple will work better as you don't want too much for your eye to have to deal with.  My only suggestion is that if you go with the second design--using two colors rather than three--you might want to combine the Z and V--with five total blocks rather than seven--since it is harder to make out the design. But the first design is definitely more successful, and is just about perfect the way it is. Even your font choice works great."

My only advice would be to find some way to keep the letters separated in the one color version. What you've done in two colors with the letters is clever, so its a shame to have those shapes just turn into a block.  I also think the typeface you're using under the blocks is working fine, but if you're looking to add some more interest to the overall logo maybe try some more contrasting typfaces, either for you name or just for the smaller letters under them.  EDIT: Actually, scratch that very last part. I say keep the smaller letters how they are and maybe mess around with just the name. I imagine at a small size you're going to have to lose the small text anyways."

In fact, I'll probably send in an entry myself, but the professional route will still most likely result in a better outcome."
logodesign,26zt0d,TpointOF,2,Sun Jun 1 02:53:58 2014 UTC,"Not hiring a designer or paying them properly because you're afraid you won't get what you want is a poor excuse. Hire someone good/reputable, give them a clear brief and pay them properly. You will be allowed a certain number of revisions and no good designer will just leave you with  something you're unhappy with."
