webcomics,3e0a0i,AlwaysHeldBack,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course! I don't know if I can say much about the plot without spoiling anything, since there are only 6 pages out so far. I have the whole story written already, so it's just drawing it into comic and adjusting things along the way.  The story takes place in modern United States. Main character is Michael Ward, 26 year old human mage with a limp and a bad attitude. In the world are fae, which are magical creatures in general. They stay hidden from humans as much as they can. There is one type of fae that leads the others. They organize themselves in a traditional fae court system (no winter/summer courts, only one). There is also a council of human mages that stay hidden from the rest of the humans, per cease-fire agreement from a war that happened long-long ago between the fae court and humans.   Also part of the cease-fire was included that a specific human would become part of the fae court as a way to humiliate the mages by taking away their strongest warrior. This was Michael Ward's ancestor. His family has been serving the fae court ever since, and over time their loyalties have switched to support the court. Ward's family is the only humans in history to ever have served as a Penumbra Knight, the personal hit-men and task-doers for the head of the court, the Fae Queen. His mother was the knight before Michael, and her father before her, etc. His mother went spy against the fae though and gave the human mage council information of their inner workings so that small attacks could be set up. Eventually she was caught and killed by the other knights and her home was burned to the ground (michael was there as a child and he survived)  Michael dislikes being involved in the politics of the upcoming war and is trying to find a way out of the old magical contract of the cease-fire that binds his family to the knight position. Of course the fae are super manipulative shits so that just makes it that much more difficult to get away from them.  All this happening while he is trying to magically cure his leg since it really is a pain in the ass to deal with, and all of a sudden the human mage council has an interest in his research into healing magics without knowing his allegiances to the fae, and with a war coming up he has to figure out what to do. Oh and also did I mention Michael regularly talks to his hallucinations?  I have prologue that sets up the story, but it was not as exciting to start the story in Ward's childhood as it was to start it right in the beginning of his adulthood. I suppose that all isnt really much explaining the plot, but I really dont want to give away future things, just backstory that will be revealed soon anyways. There will be battles, betrayals, intrigue, and a tiny hint of romance that relates to the plot(but no on screen smut, this isn't xxx comic ugh)"

webcomics,3ddg7z,lunarbaboon,47,Wed Jul 15 12:13:49 2015 UTC,"This may be incorrect.  Children that age are sponges of information, yet are often talked down to.  If given an intelligent, correct answer, they will use it as a foundation for more knowledge.  From my own experience I once gave an accurate description of how a TV worked to a small boy, and more than a decade later he thanked me, both for the information and that I had treated him as if he had an intelligent mind."
webcomics,3ddg7z,WendyLRogers3,45,Wed Jul 15 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"If you're not confident that you can explain it well, though, encouraging the child to find out for him/herself will also be a pretty good result. Teaches them how to find out for themselves. Maybe they will give up, or get a innaccurate answer, but if a kid's first reaction is ""go grab a book"" that's a wonderful result."
webcomics,3ddg7z,TheFirstKid,5,Wed Jul 15 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Gotta teach kids you gotta put yourself out there even though you're not perfect, the idea that all info needs to come from a google search and that there is a terrible social consequence for being wrong sort of kills the idea that we can still gain knowledge from each other. Otherwise why converse? We should just look up all possible info for hyper accuracy."
webcomics,3ddg7z,Hazy_V,4,Wed Jul 15 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"Never said you should punish for being wrong all the time-but leaving a kid to be horribly incorrect is also bad. Since I'm apperently terrible at getting my point across in text, I'm going to give it one last try and leave it alone.  You should help the kid look something up if he's wondering what something is. Then, later on, you can tell them ""it's probably in such-and-such book"" and they'll be able to find their own awnsers. Included in this can be the idea that "" you shouldn't be ashamed of being wrong"" but also ""doing your own research and figuring out what is the right awnser "" is being taught. I never mentioned Google- in fact, I wouldn't use Google for this, because I'd want to teach the child how to use books and the like properly and not get a shortened tidbit at the top of their fingers."
webcomics,3ddg7z,TheFirstKid,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"Except there are millions of books about, and young children do not know how to find what they want.  This is one of the things that annoys, when adults assume children have ""imagination"", but the children have no concept of what things are and do.  Something on which they can base their imagination.  ""Imagine a pirate!"" ""What's a pirate?"" ""It's somebody with an eye patch, a parrot and a cutlass on a ship."" ""What's a cutlass?"" ""Go read it in a book somewhere."" ""Why?"" ""Because."""
webcomics,3ddg7z,WendyLRogers3,10,Wed Jul 15 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"Then you help the kid until they do know or are old enough to find out. It's not a thing you tell them and shut them out afterwards. ""Let's go find it in a book"" for example."
webcomics,3ddg7z,TheFirstKid,7,Wed Jul 15 14:08:23 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong or right in this scenario. Children are sponges but teaching them that knowledge is within their grasp if they make the conscious effort to find it is twice if not as valuable as telling them how things work. Give a man a fish vs teaching him how etc.

The first one (Glight of Ocarus or something?) and Kid's Story   are just prequels to Reloaded.   The second renaissance is the backstory. The anime one (my favorite) it's just a day in the life of a Japanese neighbourhood that happened to have a glitch.  The only really weird one is the one by the Aeon Flux guy. That's the one where they try to brainwash a machine. Crap. Now I need to go watch it again too.

I think there was a better way emphasis the punchline, maybe a better set up in panel two with larger text.   Something like have the guy say ""Hey (her name) can you help me tap..."" in order to lead the reader to only one conclusion in line with the punchline.  But that is only my two cents, and my comics are no Picasso,  so please take it from someone who sees potential in the comic and not trying to slam it because the joke is funny."

The quality really suffered when he went three days a week and a lot of predictable fluff was released. Glad to see a decent comic for a change. The problem is that he's gone to a place he never went before - sexual innuendo- because he's run out of ideas. The 'great' comics similar to this never stooped so low.  Could be time to start a different kind of comic to see if he has enough creativity within him to do something that isn't just an exaggerated version of his life.

webcomics,3cjeos,game004,3,Wed Jul 8 14:00:09 2015 UTC,its a shitty job
webcomics,3cjeos,GetMeOffReddit,-11,Wed Jul 8 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"Did I mention money anywhere in my comment?   The quality of a career isn't really determined by paycheck. Paycheck is determined by the number of people currently working in the field, and the amount of competition you have. If you're the only horse shit shoveler in town and the town is full of horse shit then you can charge whatever prices you want... until someone else grabs a shovel.   The quality of a career in pipe-fixing is nil. Anyone over the age of twelve can do it as it doesn't take much serious brainpower to do the work.   And again, as I said, if the kid absolutely loves the work then there's no issue. I'm happy for her, and for anybody that loves doing the work that they're doing.   But the number of mechanics, plumbers, electricians, and repair men I've known that wish they'd gone to college and actually tried to improve their lives is saddening. Especially as they get older and people stop coming to them for work, since there's a slew of younger faster kids coming through for cheaper.   I'm not saying it's a bad life, but I am saying it's a life where you're settling for mediocre at best.   And why would anyone wish mediocrity on their kid?"
webcomics,3cjeos,Innitinnuitinnit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:06:23 2015 UTC,You're right. The quality of a job is decided be YOU.

webcomics,3cjeos,reactantt,6,Wed Jul 8 22:57:02 2015 UTC,Plumbers are a vital trade. Also with a degree they make almost as much as your average doctor.
webcomics,3cjeos,GetMeOffReddit,-4,Wed Jul 8 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"Did I say that they don't make money? I said that it's strange that people are willing to encourage their kids to settle for a mediocre career of fixing pipes. I'm sorry, but last I checked it wasn't a bad thing to hope that your kid had aspirations. You know, maybe get an education. Not settle for work that A) is about to get overcrowded by workers and B) requires no serious education or thinking.   Now, again, if the kid really loves fixing pipes then there's no issue. All the more power to the twerp."
webcomics,3cjeos,jonjefmarsjames,13,Wed Jul 8 15:00:35 2015 UTC,"Is sitting at a desk all day starting at a computer screen a better job than plumbing? It wouldn't be for me. Some people work rather work for a living and don't want to spend the rest of their life working in an office, dealing with the public, or programming computers. Also, in the US, a journeyman plumbing license requires four years of school while working full time as an apprentice for a master plumber."
webcomics,3cjeos,Futurames,5,Wed Jul 8 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"My brother is a plumber and he's tried to talk to me about some of the stuff he does and it's pretty complicated. He was explaining to me how he has to replace some guys entire plumbing system in his house and I just zoned out after a while. Plumbers have to be query to lots of ever-changing information that the average person doesn't worry about.   Sometimes his job isn't so fun but every job has aspects that aren't great. He gets to meet new people every day,he gets to be active and he faces new challenges every day.   Plus, for the most part, people are always happy to see him."
webcomics,3cjeos,GetMeOffReddit,-4,Wed Jul 8 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"I learned plumbing when I was twelve. Both of my uncles do house repair work. They failed school and don't even have their GED's.   It might be boring to you, sure. Or you don't know the lingo, again sure. But it's definitely not difficult.   And again, if he likes it then all the more power to him. I'm not trying to say it's a bad thing to enjoy your work. I'm saying its strange to hope your kid doesn't get an education and instead settles for grunt work."
webcomics,3cjeos,Futurames,8,Wed Jul 8 15:30:13 2015 UTC,"You probably learned basic plumbing like how to snake a drain or to replace a pipe underneath the sink. That's great and I think more people should know how to do basic things like that.   If that's all plumbers did though, they wouldn't make as much as they do. Nobody would be willing to pay my brother $500 for an hour and a half of work if their 12 year old could do it.   I know you're not saying that laborers are bad but if your child were to come to you someday and say that they want to do something other than work in the STEM fields, are you going to discourage them? My brother decided fairly young that he wanted to work with his hands and to build and fix things and my dad took steps to make that happen for him. Now he's 22, has a beautiful home and financial stability. I have friends approaching their 30's who have what you would consider ""respectable"" jobs and they're going to be paying off their student debts for another 15 years at least."
webcomics,3cjeos,GetMeOffReddit,-4,Wed Jul 8 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"Of course I wouldn't discourage them! That would be awful to the kid. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't push for them to explore more before deciding on such a cut and narrow path either.   Most of us grew up playing with toy trucks saying how great it would be to drive construction equipment. Our parents smiled, bought the toys when we asked, and then asked us to get good grades in school and to pay attention to the world around us. My parents, your parents, so on.   There's nothing bad with a person deciding to do what they want with their future. But there is something very strange behind a parent looking at their baby kid and saying ""you know, them being a plumber would be fine. I'm not going to expect more out of them than that.""   And a lot people seem fixated on the idea of labor of this form being well paying. And it is, currently it is doing very well for itself. But we all do understand that as more people start applying to the field (uneducated people hoping to avoid college loans and testing and education in general) that the competition will go up while the pay will start to drop.   Eventually it's going to be as crowded of a market as any, as far as I can tell.   So anybody in the industry right now, and maybe for another generation or so will be fine no doubt. But it's not a guaranteed money maker.   Though, if I'm wrong I'm fine with someone explaining to me how I'm wrong. My understanding of supply and demand economics is not exactly the best thing ever."
webcomics,3cjeos,caroline_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"You're staking a lot on this whole /u/lunarbaboon - wants-his-kid-to-be-a-plumber-thing. I think it was merely a device to deliver a punchline. Perhaps you've taken it too literally.   But additionally, I find your opinions of blue collar workers, and plumbers in particular, to be really ignorant and insulting. You don't know every single person's situation or circumstances. Either they went into this field because they wanted to, which shouldn't be any of your business, or they had to, due to lack of opportunity or privilege, which they shouldn't be patronized for. You're essentially saying it would be a tragedy for any parent to wish a blue collar career on their child. It's also shitty to assume that plumber = uneducated.   My husband and I have had to hire a plumber recently. Because we had a problem neither of us could fix, and we're college educated people. So the plumber gets to come out and charge a lot of money for their services. Our plumber is his own boss and he seems to love his job. My husband on the other hand is a manager in a corporate office and he hates it.   The world needs tradesmen, and the people who take on that work deserve a hell of a lot more respect than persecuted intellectuals on the internet. Plumbers, mechanics, etc.. I'm glad they're around; their skills are probably more valuable than mine, and most of all, we need them."
webcomics,3cjeos,MaryOutside,6,Thu Jul 9 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"What message is it that you get, then?  Because the message I get here is that there's an expectation for women to fulfill traditional ""feminine"" roles; women even police themselves as concerns these out-dated expectations! Instead, I love that /u/lunarbaboon points out that women can do things that are traditionally cast as masculine activities, like plumbing."
webcomics,3cjeos,GetMeOffReddit,-4,Wed Jul 8 15:30:04 2015 UTC,"The message was pretty clearly ""I don't like people assuming my kids going to be girly, in fact I kinda hope she'll turn out to be a plumber or something just to prove them wrong.""   Aka, instead of saying ""boy, I'd love it if my daughter went to college and got a degree in something she's really passionate about."" he said ""I hope she proves all those sexist old ladies wrong and gets work fixing pipes.""   Which is strange to me, since I would hope that most parents would want their kids to aspire to be more than grunt work.   And again, if the kid loves to work on pipes then it's a non-issue. I just wanted to point out that I find it strange that someone would want their kid to be a plumber. I'd think most fathers would rather have their kid go to college and accomplish more than that.   But again, as far as beating the patriarchy. Sure, I guess, his kid should get a ""manly"" job such as fixing pipes. That'll show the world. Especially those nasty old ladies and their princess talk."
webcomics,3cjeos,omegashadow,14,Wed Jul 8 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think societies idea of ""grunt work"" is heavily flawed. I contest your statement that plumbers have poor career prospects.

The whole ""wish what you want"" and Oprah's The Secret are bullshit, but those notions got popular because they activate something very healthy in people--the fact that if you project positivity, you will feel it more so.    If you go about your life under the assumption and treating every interaction with people as though you are this person and that you are a person who doesn't get opportunities to engage with other people, well, you won't ever engage with other people.    People often stay depressed, alone, and miserable not because they are incapable of mustering willpower or because they're flawed people, but because it is so damn difficult to imagine anything other than our current state, that it literally seems impossible to imagine a normal, happy, healthy lifestyle.     But stupider, weaker, uglier people than you have friends, a social life, and even romantic interests. There is nothing about you that prevents you from having them too. It isn't that you lack opportunities--it's that the path of least resistance is always easier than stepping out of your comfort zone and staying there.   Eventually, your comfort zone shifts."
