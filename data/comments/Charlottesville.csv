That's relevant because they both work from home 50+ hours a week and couldn't do it without reliable connectivity.  They use CenturyLink for what it is worth.

They also boarded my kitten when I was out of town; I like that if something had happened, all his med history was right there for them to check.

Charlottesville,3e0rn1,owlbeyourfriend,6,Tue Jul 21 02:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'll throw a downvote at Georgetown.  They're expensive and they treated my wife like absolute shit when it was time to put one of our dogs down.  There was a lot of ""are you sure?"" and ""Let us run more tests first...""  It was one of the hardest decisions we had made as a family and they just shit all over it and made it that much worse.  We currently using a subscription service for our new dog at the Banfield Animal Cinic inside PetSmart.  Their vets are super-friendly and knowledgeable.  I have also used VETTS out at Airport at ""odd"" times, and their prices are reasonable, considering the times of day/night you need them."
Charlottesville,3e0rn1,kuanes,3,Tue Jul 21 09:27:33 2015 UTC,"While I haven't had that experience at G'town, I'll upvote for VETSS at the Airport for emergencies. I liked that they ran through all the charges with me before proceeding (just a swollen paw from a cut that didn't look like it was draining, so time wasn't an issue).   One thing for OP: DON'T GO TO GREENBRIAR! My boss's cat wasn't eating for a few days, and she brought him there as an emergency location (her regular is G'town). They said Teddy had cancer, and nothing could be done. They suggested she put him down right then, but she went to her regular vet for a 2nd opinion the next day or so. Turns out Teddy just had a severe cold, and couldn't smell the food enough to eat it.   Another co-worker brought a cat who had been hurt badly (unsure of circumstances) to Greenbriar in an emergency situation, and they operated. When the family brought the cat to their regular vet as a post-surgery follow-up, the vet said that the surgery was a useless endeavor and the cat was in just as much pain as before.  TL;DR--Avoid Greenbriar like the plague."

There have been many cases in Cville of Pedestrian injury due to deer stampedes; I think last year there were 12.  What the Authorities suggest you do is to clap loudly while raising your hands above your head. So Arms out and then reach upward to clap. This creates dominance and the mother will usually get out of your way, I suggest you do this at the slightest view of a deer just to be safe. It’s also helpful to let out a deep “swoosh” sound, this is while clapping overhead makes the deer think you are its predator and she will not attack you."
Charlottesville,3dsfmc,machine_restart,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:33:36 2015 UTC,"Deer in the city are very used to people so they won't be as skittish as deer in more rural areas.  However, they'll get out of your way if they feel threatened.  It is VERY unusually for an adult deer to attack a human, even if the human is ""threatening"" a fawn.  The greatest risk to a fawn is a person thinking a fawn has been abandoned and trying to help.  The only time to be extra cautious is during their breeding season (~November-ish) when hormone levels are running REALLY high."

Charlottesville,3dhu9s,722KL,2,Thu Jul 16 15:12:11 2015 UTC,Do your research. Healing from a piercing done with a gun is a lot different than a piercing done with a needle. Also the difference in earrings is important as well.

The network does go along 29 up there, but it will take some work to get it off the highway and into various neighborhoods and businesses. Much of that area is pegged for medium to long term ""future expansion"". This year will be focused largely on North Downtown, Martha Jefferson, Locust Grove, Belmont. The good news: after those four, it's on to new areas!  :-)"

Charlottesville,3cg4h5,whatcontext,2,Tue Jul 7 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know if charlottesville has anything that is super ""charlottesville"", but there is lots of really good food to be had.   Little Johns on the corner is a late night institution, while it isn't my favorite i would say white spot might make that level too.  For non-late night, I would second the ace bbq and maybe lampo, but i would also recommend Mas or one of the many other good restaurants in belmont.  I don't really know where people go for weekday breakfast other than bodos (which is a must and a half) and probably blue moon diner, but i would recommend commonwealth or blue ridge bakery for a weekend breakfast.  As far as other ""local"" food, i would recommend getting oysters at either public oyster for a good meal on main or rock salt for happy hour.  I also recommend making it out to bbq exchange.  If you are in town for restaurant week (http://charlottesvillerestaurantweek.com/) you should hit up a couple places."

Where are you shacking up? I imagine you'll want something relatively close by.   Randomly, I'd say- La Michoacana for really good Mexican food. Guadalajara for pretty bad Mexican food that is also dirt cheap.   Mel's or Riverside if you want a greasy burger and are tired of the White Spot (Riverside's pretty far from the hospital though.)  Afghan Kabob Palace is pretty close and really good, they even deliver. Try the Qabuli Palow.   If you're here for a month and never eat Bodos you should probably be arrested or something."

No Joke, the school treated us to Bodos our first day here and it was a part of the mandatory orientation.  No Bodos?  No UVA for you!  And I got the egg and sausage on an everything bagel but a lot of people suggested the herb cream cheese one as well.

Like other people said I'm not sure that there's really a specialty specific to Charlottesville that you can't get anywhere else, but we have a lot of great food. Finding decent dinner after 11 is going to be the hard part. Maybe Italian Villa? If you go out Ivy Road to get to 250 from the hospital there's a wings place open late.

Charlottesville,3bxlnk,fsacb3,6,Sat Jul 4 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"I was born and raised here, lived in NY and LA for about 10 years, and now I'm back. I feel somewhat qualified to answer.  I think it's easier to find dates in a big city. As you say, a lot of the people who move here are in steady relationships or just got married, which is why they moved here. The largest pool of people your age who are single are either grad students, or just graduated and started working. The problem with that no matter where you are is that people your age are very busy. They're working there asses off trying to get established in a new career. But this is true in a big city or a small one.  I have tried OKCupid in Charlottesville and NY/LA, and there's no comparison. In big cities there are a TON of single people. Very easy to get dates if you put in the time and effort. Not so much here. I think the best way to get a date in Charlottesville is through work, friends, and random events and activities. The good thing about VA is that if you're outgoing, it'll be fairly easy to meet people. It's a small enough town that you can become a regular very easily and therefore you'll get to know the bartender, the barista, the girl who's always at the coffeeshop that you like. In NY either you meet people online or you meet a stranger at a bar. In Charlottesville you play a longer game where you see the same person a few times and then it's easier to get to know them. Does that make sense?  I'm rambling. I think it's easier to date in a big city. That's where young single people move. This is a small town, and family oriented. The thing keeping it young is the university. There are single people here, and if you put in the effort you can find a mate. And when you do, it may turn into a long term thing. But if your priority is to get laid a lot and have many girlfriends, I would go somewhere else."
Charlottesville,3bxlnk,YoScott,2,Fri Jul 3 11:02:54 2015 UTC,"This is good advice and similar to my experience. I grew up in Southern VA, moved to DC for 10+ years, then settled here.  The dating pool is shallow and you have to really be careful if things don't work out.  I've done the online dating thing for a while, and run into a few of my online dates socially through mutual friends, or in mutual locations.    The one thing nobody seems to mention is that the young adult population here is very transient.  I'm not talking about grad/med students either. It seems like everyone here is only here for a few years, particularly if they fail to settle down with someone.  That of course means there's a constant turnover of people to try and date along with all the life-long townies.   That said, the quality of women I've dated in town far surpasses that of DC for me.  In DC there seems to be an attitude that if you're not 100% of what they want, they will move on to someone else and keep trying.  Around here with a smaller pool of people to pick from, there's a little impetus to compromise and make things work, which in my opinion seems like good practice to make a long term relationship work."
Charlottesville,3bxlnk,blaxbear,3,Mon Jul 6 20:53:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in same boat as you (24-year-old straight male). I've been here just over a year, and haven't put in a lot of time or effort into dating, but it hasn't been terribly difficult to meet people. Making friends isn't hard as most people are friendly, so I'm sure you would get your feet under you quickly. What specific complaints have your friends made?"
Charlottesville,3bxlnk,Notjohnnyv,5,Fri Jul 3 00:21:42 2015 UTC,"I am consistently astonished at all the beautiful women in this city. Every day. And there is no shortage. If you can't find a date here, that's on you."

There are lots of people here in our age group!"

It used to be that there were all these little theaters scattered about, with just a few screens each; now there's only the one big mainstream venue. Either way, the effect is the same: if you want to see a particular film, you have no choice in where to see it (or how much you pay).   Other places, including the similarly-sized city of Roanoke, have two or more theater chains that show the same movies at the same time. That means that if I don't like one or the other theater, I don't have to go there. And it also means that they are little more constrained in their ticket prices, since they don't want o get undercut by the other guy.  At least Stonefield is a nice enough theater, unlike some of the carp-holes we used to have to deal with. But you're paying a lot for the privilege, and there are no discount alternatives to keep them in check."

Charlottesville,3aqa0f,balathustrius,6,Mon Jun 22 17:24:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know those apartments myself, but if you're new to the area, I can offer some advice and insight into the Charlottesville housing market and a couple of other quirks.  This town grew very unevenly. The University students drive the cost of housing ever upwards. Lots of units have been structured with them in mind - low on amenities and space, high on cost. I don't mean that to sound blame-y; it isn't their fault. The City Council here can be astoundingly incompetent at city planning, and many students subsidize apartment costs with student loans without realizing how much it costs in the long run.  The population density around UVA and downtown is very high compared to what the roads can handle. We have the fascinating problem of having not enough, and yet far too much housing. As a result, traffic, while well-shy of NoVa-level-fuckery, can be very frustrating at times. Learn the back roads to and from work, depending on your hours. Get a phone traffic app and check it before you head out into rush hour.  Overall, avoid apartment complexes that cater primarily to students. School is out, so you won't be able to tell what they're like when classes start back up. And as mentioned, I think they're overpriced.  If you're just out of school, and if you haven't done so yet, you may want to consider browsing Craigslist for large housing groups with an opening. With school out for the summer, you can probably find some left behind by people who graduated and moved away. I'd avoid official housing cooperatives unless you know and like what you're getting into. But if you're into that, there are a few scattered around town.  Another option is to find the cheapest place possible (there are some suites next to the railroad tracks on Fontaine Avenue, for instance) and sign a six-month lease.

Charlottesville,3am1mg,sosoosos,4,Sun Jun 21 15:31:50 2015 UTC,It's an awful decision IMHO. I used to decide on my route home (downtown to north end of county) based on what actual traffic conditions are when I leave my office and this totally eliminates Park St as a viable route to 250.
Charlottesville,3am1mg,Und34dMonk3y,5,Sun Jun 21 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"So if not Park or McIntire, that only leaves Locust to get to 250, which is now going to really negatively impact that street for the residents."

Charlottesville,3am1mg,fobis,5,Mon Jun 22 02:19:57 2015 UTC,"There's no reason for it.  I've commuted through that intersection many times, and traffic has never been that big of a deal even at rush hour.  Before the light went in, at its busiest, traffic might have been backed up to around Melbourne, but at least it usually flowed fairly well.  Haven't been through there at rush hour since the light was turned on."
Charlottesville,3am1mg,eaglescout1984,4,Mon Jun 22 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"Having almost been creamed about a thousand times trying to turn left (south) onto park from 250, I think the new light is a good idea.  It probably adds to traffic but I'd be willing to bet it is a lot safer.  Maybe they need to rethink the timing of the lights for peak hours?"
Charlottesville,3am1mg,dabneyd79,2,Mon Jun 22 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"Like others said, it's terrible. It even made the news last week. http://www.nbc29.com/story/29364069/new-park-st-stop-lights-causing-some-traffic-problems As for me, McIntire is not that great of a solution because I'd have to go through downtown or wait at the Monticello/Ridge St light. So, apologies to Locust Ave and Holmes Ave residents, I'll be using your streets to get to 29 north."

Charlottesville,3am1mg,Retroactive_Spider,2,Mon Jun 22 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out of my way to avoid Park Street in the future   That's likely the reason for the decision.  It's been a few years since I've been back home.  Has the extension from McIntire to Rio Rd opened up yet?  If so, they're likely trying to induce people to that route."
Charlottesville,3am1mg,YoScott,3,Sun Jun 21 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"The extension has opened, but access to it is from Park Street via the bypass, or from McIntire, which has equally poor stoplight/traffic backup issues now due to the new lights they put in there. So I don't think the light was designed to push traffic off Park to McIntire - I think it was to eliminate backups due to people trying to turn left onto the bypass during rush hour. Unfortunately, it has now created backups at ALL times, and leaves people sitting in their cars for minutes at the red while there are literally no cars at the green lights."
Charlottesville,3am1mg,YoScott,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"or from McIntire, which has equally poor stoplight/traffic backup issues now due to the new lights they put in there   I thought once McIntire was extended past 250, they were going to make that a light-less exchange.  Oh well."
Charlottesville,3am1mg,ThaWZA,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the John Warner Parkway?  That's been open for months now, and you don't take Park to get to it from the Bypass.  And you no longer have to use Park/Melbourne or just Park to get to Rio.  I feel like the lights help people get onto Park heading Westbound on the bypass, but probably slow down actual traffic on Park. Either way, why are people using Park to get to Rio when JWW Parkway is so much faster?"
Charlottesville,3am1mg,datcv,2,Mon Jun 22 17:18:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, we are talking about the parkway, specifically the extension of the parkway south of Melbourne to the 250/McIntire intersection. And yes, you do take Park to get to the Parkway if you are coming from downtown Cville or Belmont (you get on the westbound bypass from Park, and then get right off again). You misread my earlier comment - which said you take the BP from Park, not vice versa.  Finally, I (and apparently other drivers) would disagree with you that the JWW Parkway is ""so much faster"" than Park/Rio. The ""Parkway"" is a one-lane, heavily trafficked road zoned for 35 mph (with frequent drivers going much slower than posted limit), and with long lights at both the McIntire intersection and again at the Rio Rd. E intersection. Depending on whether you hit red lights and/or slow drivers, either route is less than a minute different. So people continue to take Park instead of the Parkway because it is just as fast, and sometimes easier to get to."
Charlottesville,3am1mg,Retroactive_Spider,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"I live in Belmont and to get up to Hollymead area, I take the Bypass to JWW then up Rio to 29. That light on Park + Melbourne is tragically slow and the traffic there has always been heavier than on JWW, in my experience.  I drive it regularly as an uber driver.  Taking JWW, you only encounter one stoplight between 250 and where it meets with Rio and its they are timed for the traffic on JWW.  I don't think I have hit it red once since the parkway opened up.    I don't know why you have to take Park from downtown... I'd probably opt to take McIntire from downtown, and Meade/High from Belmont so you don't have to deal with people getting on/off the bypass at Park.    I will agree the stoplight situation on McIntire under the bypass leaves a lot to be desired, but having to choose between that one intersection, and choosing between the (now) two lights on Park, I'll take McIntire."
Charlottesville,3am1mg,YoScott,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:58:46 2015 UTC,"Well, we have very different experiences driving the same roads. Heading up to 29, that light on Park + Melbourne has never been a problem for me....it has almost invariably been green and I can decide to take the left to go to the JWW or just continue straight up past Pen Park on Rio E, depending on time of day and traffic flow in front of me.  Again, I don't think there's more of a minute difference at any time, whichever way I go.  (That being said, I absolutely will not take JWW and/or Rio/Park in the other direction (ie, going south back to Cville from N. 29) as I agree with you that the lights and backups on Rio/Park/Melbourne are unbelievable. In that case, I would stay on JWW to the BP, or more usually, I just stay on 29 to the BP via Hydraulic.)  On the other hand, every single time I've gone up the JWW, I've hit the red at Melbourne (which you say is always green), and then the red again where it meets Rio. Both of those lights seems to cycle very slowly to me.  Finally, taking Meade/High to get to the BP is going in the complete wrong direction coming from Downtown or Belmont nearer the bridge. If you are coming from the Hogwaller then I can see that route making sense, but it doesn't make sense if you are anywhere down the Avon corridor."
Charlottesville,3am1mg,datcv,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:44:54 2015 UTC,Has the extension from McIntire to Rio Rd opened up yet?   It has and it sucks just as much as every other road in this town.  The problem is that all of the stoplight timers are way off. I can drive exactly the speed limit and hit every single red light on 29 between UVA and Hollymead. Every single time. It's infuriating. A re-evaluation of the stoplight timers would do more for traffic here than any amount of bypasses.  And don't get me started on the 29/Hydraulic intersection. That may be the worst intersection in America.
Charlottesville,3am1mg,Fandemonium,4,Sun Jun 21 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"The worst thing about that intersection is if you are trying to make a left turn off of Hydraulic to go 29 South from the K-Mart/Whole Foods side. If the cars go immediately, 2 maybe 3 cars can get through. If the person in front delays at all, forget it.  I doubt it's the worst intersection in America, though. I've seen so many more accidents at Rio/29."

City life gets old for a lot of people. It's expensive, and if you have any sort of commute you don't get to enjoy the city life anyway.  For the folks that want to experience the city, Charlottesville is a great location in that DC is an easy drive away for a day or weekend trip. Also, with the University here, Charlottesville has many of the things that all the big cities offer (sports, arts, culture, etc) in a very homey, small-town environment.  If nothing else, tell them this:  The day before my wife and I left DC, we had breakfast in Del Ray, Alexandria. During this breakfast, I overheard three separate groups planning day or weekend trips to Charlottesville.  We live where those city folks escape to. You can either live here with us, or you can be a city folk that escapes here and wishes they could stay."

Charlottesville,3ae7od,crimesofthemind,3,Fri Jun 19 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"I lived in DC for 5 years after college and finally I couldn't take it anymore. I convinced my wife to relocate to Cville and buy a house; we couldn't be happier. I'm a software developer and I was actively trying to get to Cville, but rather than find a job in Cville, I found a place that lets me work from home. I think targeting college students is going to be tough. You would probably have much better luck targeting people who have been out of college in DC for a few years and are ready to get out/buy a house/start a family/etc... When you're fresh out of college the positive attributes of Cville (cheaper houses, good schools, smaller community, less traffic) just don't seem to matter as much."
Charlottesville,3ae7od,vawhitewater,3,Fri Jun 19 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"My wife and I had a long search for where we wanted to live after having our first kid. We wanted to be somewhere in the DC/MD/VA area. So we hunted and hunted and hunted for the right place to live. Every weekend we were visiting places and going to open houses. Our requirements included affordability, good schools, proximity to things to do & restaurants, walkability, natural beauty, no commute, and reasonable career opportunities.  In MD we evaluated Bethesda, Poolesville, Baltimore suburbs like Linthicum, Annapolis. In VA there's Arlington, Alexandria, Vienna. All basically to stay attached to the limitless career options in a larger cities.  The DC area towns tended to have at least some commute. Lowest we were going to get was 20-25 minutes. The nice places had broken down fixer-upper homes in the 700Ks. And prices have only gotten worse. Move-in ready homes were in the million plus range. We'd have basically no career flexibility to live here. Poolesville and farther out locales were an affordable option, but that commute -- ugh! We were simply priced out, or commuted out. We didn't want to be house poor for our kids to get a reasonable K-12 education.    While this is my experience in DC/MD, I feel the same could be said of many larger cities. There's a depressingly severe premium for living in a nice place with good schools with no commute that is affordable enough that we could have flexibility in our life. I can't imagine, for example, being able to have a second kid with my wife taking a career break in DC. We simply would need both parents making 6 digit incomes commuting all over to make it all work.  So long story short, we eventually settled on Charlottesville as a good compromise for affordability, opportunities, quality of schools, proximity to things to do, no commute, and close enough to DC/Baltimore to visit grandparents. We have enough flexibility to take some risks or let one parent stop working for a while.  These were our considerations. They of course won't apply to everyone. I'm sure there are dozens of small town that could also claim Charlottesville's strengths. And more affordable places to boot. But I think this is a theme I've seen shared between other at least family-oriented folks that move to Charlottesville from other places."

Cville has a ton to do for its size and some frankly amazing restaurants (including 2 james beard nominees) and tons of breweries, wineries and cider houses .  Also has a music scene that is bigger and has more history then you would expect from a city of our size.  Being small means people are all pretty friendly and the traffic by and large isn't too bad.  You can also get out of town and be in the woods by yourself in just a couple of minutes.  UVa also ensures that there are always new smart people moving in and our of town.  UVa also ensure a constant supply of jobs and more and more start ups.  If you need bigger towns we are ~1 hour from Richmond and ~2 hours from DC and ~3.5 from the ocean.    It is going to be hard to compete with san francisco, but if someone is looking for a lot of the attractive aspects of san fran without the size and cost cville is a great option.

Great concerts and theater venues and productions. Lots of live shows. Don't forget the annual Virginia Film Festival! UVA for continuing education and city-wide amenities. Lots of great restaurants spanning various ethnic tastes. Close to DC so access to even more special events, airport for international travel, conferences etc. National Parks - lots of trails and fun activities. Wineries and breweries are everywhere with great brewpubs.  Quality of life and great amenities. There are so many cities in the U.S. where it takes a long time to get anywhere. Most things are easy to get to in Charlottesville and within walking distance. Biking and walking are great ways to commute and get to places. Transport is also pretty decent for a city the size of Charlottesville. Driving isn't necessary at all.

Know the horrors he brought to Western Europe and learn from the past. Not ignore/remove from sight the history he represents. The fact that effort was made to immortalize a figure of such evil in statuary form would serve as a reminder to my children how evil can lurk in people who at the moment are respected and cheered on by their people.

Charlottesville,3a3kke,Cut_the_dick_cheese,9,Tue Jun 16 23:19:41 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling there's not gonna be much middle ground on this issue. But I'll try.   I'm an avid cyclist that rides several days a week on county roads. As a motorist, I've also been stuck behind large groups of cyclists riding uphill at 10mph taking up the entire road. Like most problems, this one can be solved with civility and common sense. Motorists should watch out for cyclists, share the road, give cyclists room, and be patient. Cyclists should ride single file and get as far over as practical.   In my experience, the vast majority of both groups follow these rules. However, I've known some cyclists that are aggressive, uncompromising, alpha males. They deliberately antagonize motorists. I don't ride with those guys anymore. Conversely, I've occasionally experienced rude behavior from motorists. There will always be belligerent dipshits in both groups. Not many, but just enough to give each side a bad reputation and keep the controversy festering.   Here's some of the laws related to bicycles on Virginia roads:   Bicyclists must ride with the flow of traffic on the right side of the highway. Bicyclists operating a bicycle on a roadway at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place under conditions then existing shall ride as close as safely practicable to the right curb or edge of roadway. Exceptions to this are when bicyclists are overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction, preparing for a left turn, avoiding unsafe conditions, avoiding riding in a lane that turns or diverges to the right, riding on a one way street where bicyclists may ride as near the left-hand curb or edge of roadway, or when the lane width is too narrow to share with a motor vehicle. Additionally, bicycles are not excluded from riding on the highway shoulder. Bicyclists must not ride between two lanes of traffic moving in the same direction unless one lane is a separate or mandatory turn lane. Bicyclists cannot ride more than two abreast on highways.  When riding two abreast, bicyclists cannot impede the movement of traffic and need to move into a single file when being overtaken from the rear.  On a laned roadway, bicyclists shall ride in a single lane.   Source  If you see groups of cyclists breaking these laws, perhaps a passenger can take a video. Share it with the cops. If it becomes a serious enough problem, I'd think the county police will do something about it."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,MattAtUVA,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:44:01 2015 UTC,"If it becomes a serious enough problem, I'd think the county police will do something about it.   ACPD's traffic enforcement is nonexistent.  They're not going to care about this."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,MattAtUVA,3,Wed Jun 17 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"There's a full time traffic enforcement division in the ACPD. Source. Will they care about this? I dunno, but in my experience they are responsive to the community."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,emperor000,-4,Wed Jun 17 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"Bicyclists must ride with the flow of traffic on the right side of the highway.   This is for a street bicycle, though... If we are talking about somebody just taking a leisurely ride or kids on their bikes or something, then they should definitely be riding against traffic just as they would if they were walking or running."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,kintaeb,3,Wed Jun 17 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"No, this isn't true at all. Bicycles are vehicles. This means they shouldn't be used on sidewalks whenever possible. It is much safer to go with the flow of traffic than it is against when you are on a vehicle. Pedestrians can get away with running or walking against traffic because they are more agile and can avoid oncoming obstacles. The same is not true for bikes. If you are travelling against traffic you are effectively adding to the momentum of the oncoming car, as opposed to reducing that momentum if you are going with traffic."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,emperor000,-2,Wed Jun 17 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, I am not disagreeing with /u/MattAtUVA or the law and I said nothing about a sidewalk. We are talking about areas where there probably are no sidewalks. If we are talking about city streets then it is definitely advisable to go with traffic.   It is much safer to go with the flow of traffic than it is against when you are on a vehicle.    No it isn't. You vision and hearing are both tuned to focus on what is in front of you. Being on a bike unable to or with limited ability to determine if a car is coming up behind you is dangerous. If you are going at about walking or running speed then you are better off facing traffic. It doesn't matter whether you are on a vehicle or not. It is more about your speed and maximizing your awareness. You can more easily see and hear the cars that are on your side of the road. The other cars are on the other side.   The same is not true for bikes. If you are travelling against traffic you are effectively adding to the momentum of the oncoming car, as opposed to reducing that momentum if you are going with traffic.   Adding maybe 10mph at most of momentum, but probably not even that... If you get hit, you got hit. 10 mph isn't going to matter much. The idea is that you stop and move off to the side if you have to. You're a kid riding your bike, not Lance Armstrong touring. You don't have to turn your head and take your eyes off the road, etc. It helps to be able to see and hear the car(s) coming.  I'll give an example. I was driving how the other day and 3 or 4 kids were on their bikes driving with traffic and they had no idea I was behind them. They were going slow enough so that they needed to use balance to keep upright and they were wobbling back and forth a little bit in and out of the middle of the road. I slowed down as I passed (illegally, but more or less safely) and told them (nicely) they were on the wrong side of the road. The older girl said ""Oh, okay"" and after I passed I watched her in my rear view mirror whip out into the lane without really checking if a car was coming. Obviously she could hear (although the sound of my car would hinder that some) and was maybe relying on that, but it still made me nervous.  At least that is how my parents taught me. It has more to do with common sense, than the law. If you are going at about pedestrian speed, then you are for all intents and purposes a pedestrian and you're better off having higher awareness of the cars closer to you than farther from you."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,kintaeb,2,Wed Jun 17 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"So what this tells me is that children need to be supervised/taught better. If they had an adult that was riding with them and trying to keep them safe they might not have whipped around into traffic. Kids shouldn't be riding on main roads by themselves because it's operating a vehicle on a road made for adults.  The issue with telling kids that you should ride against traffic and all that is that it causes confusion as they get older. It's the same principle as with drinking while pregnant. Can you do it a small amount and be okay as long as you know the overall rule? Yes, but it isn't advisable. The more we educate people to ride safely with traffic and follow laws the better off everyone will be. Adding in exceptions and little ""well in this situation"" scenarios only leads to cyclists that piss off motorists and cause petitions like the one we are discussing."

If they had an adult that was riding with them and trying to keep them safe they might not have whipped around into traffic. Kids shouldn't be riding on main roads by themselves because it's operating a vehicle on a road made for adults.   I can't really argue with this except that you can't reasonably tell kids they can't ride on the streets and roads around their house... I mean, they also weren't wearing helmets, but I didn't bring that up.   The issue with telling kids that you should ride against traffic and all that is that it causes confusion as they get older.

Adding in exceptions and little ""well in this situation"" scenarios only leads to cyclists that piss off motorists and cause petitions like the one we are discussing.   I don't get this. I would never ride with traffic on a country road if I was only going at a casual pace. I'd have too hard of a time riding without knowing what is coming up behind me going much faster than I am. I'm not confused as an adult... I just don't feel like having oncoming traffic to my back.   Adding in exceptions and little ""well in this situation"" scenarios only leads to cyclists that piss off motorists and cause petitions like the one we are discussing.   I'd rather have a petition than people hit by cars because they didn't know they were coming.  If you are worried about agility, a car is less agile than a bike. Unfortunately, sometimes the correct thing to do is to just get off to the side of the road and let a car pass."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,n3dward,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"And if you were to ride against traffic on a country road, you would be breaking the law. As a biker, if you are riding to the very far right of the lane, on the right side of the road, or in the shoulder, You should have the confidence that you will be seen by cars and that they will have enough sense not to hit you. One of the main reasons bike should not ride against traffic is that it decreases the reaction time of the drivers, as you are traveling towards them, as opposed to away from them.   Another reason is that if you get to choose where you ride, then some bikers will choose left, and some will choose right, and then what happens when two going opposite directions in the same lane meet up? As a biker, there have been a few times that I've almost run into other bikers coming the opposite direction, and they would have been at fault for riding against traffic."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,emperor000,0,Thu Jun 18 09:39:39 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point. I'm not talking about being a ""biker"". I don't know how you missed that since I explicitly stated it. I'm talking about riding a bike, where you are basically a pedestrian. You're not going 17-20+ mph depending on hills, etc. If you are, then you definitely need to get over on the other side.   One of the main reasons bike should not ride against traffic is that it decreases the reaction time of the drivers, as you are traveling towards them, as opposed to away from them.    And in most cases you should be moving off of the road when a car is coming... You aren't in the Tour de France, you are a kid riding your bike and you can stop if you are in an area that is dangerous. The point is that it makes it easier to be aware of what is in coming at you on the side of the road you are on. You're much more aware of what is in front than what is behind.  The logic you just presented above is the same regardless of whether you are a ""biker"" or just casually riding a bike at a slower speed or a runner.   You should have the confidence that you will be seen by cars and that they will have enough sense not to hit you.   This sounds like horrible reasoning. Why would I completely place my confidence in those drivers? It's hard enough to do that riding in a car. It would be even harder doing that on a bike or as a runner going at about the same speed."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,emperor000,3,Thu Jun 18 11:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure ""removing"" them is a good idea or fair, but it is definitely a problem. It can be pretty unsafe for them for drivers, and it is extremely inconvenient to drivers.  The biggest question I have is why don't they stop and pull over? When you have a line of cars behind you, wouldn't you just stop and go off to the side? A bike can do that almost anywhere. If you can't, then the drivers will probably be able to see that and be thankful once the biker finally pulls over. Sure, it might mess up your workout, but we are supposed to be sharing the roads and bikes basically take them over..."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,LuciDaydream3r,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"How inconvenient is it really? For either? On a bike, stay as far over as possible. In your car, wait until it is safe to pass, maybe a minute or two at the MOST. I get more frustrated at stupid drivers in county roads that are going 15 under the speed limit then I do when I have to pass a biker. Saying it is inconvenient is just saying you have little to no patience. I'm not saying all bikers are good about sharing the road, but neither are all drivers. When's the last time you almost got in an accident because of a biker? Me? Never."
Charlottesville,3a3kke,emperor000,2,Wed Jun 17 16:20:17 2015 UTC,"I couldn't say I've almost gotten into an accident, but I've had to follow them for 10 to 15 minutes, maybe more. On some roads in this county, you can't pass legally or safely.  Like I said, I don't think we can just remove them, but it is definitely a problem. You often hear ""share the road"" referring to cars sharing with bicycles and other vehicles, but bicycles very often do not share the road themselves."

Charlottesville,3a3kke,emperor000,2,Wed Jun 17 14:11:26 2015 UTC,How? You go a little slower until a time when you can safely pass the cyclists. Is that really a major inconvenience?
Charlottesville,3a3kke,lordgeezus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"I guess you are from Charlottesville, but have you ever been outside city limits in the county? There are plenty of roads that would literally add 20 minutes or more to a trip into/out of town when there are bicyclists on it, especially a line of them. That is, assuming traffic laws are followed, like no passing on a double yellow. If that's not what you meant by ""safe"", then sure. But now the suggestion is to break the law... That doesn't seem like a very good argument.  There is also an inherent danger in going well below the speed limit, just as there is well above. Suggesting for somebody to ""just slow down"" doesn't really solve the problem of safety. If the speed limit is 35 and I have to go 10 because of a cyclist, then that is at least approaching the realm of unsafe. The speed limit is probably 35 because of curves and hills and so on.  Is it a world shattering catastrophe? No. But it is definitely inconvenient and can certainly be unsafe."

Charlottesville,39mwn2,Ninjazanus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"Budget isn't too big of an issue, but it's more of a casual first date and I'm currently on a medical scribe's salary (ie: not much), so I'd prefer to spend less than $100. I don't mind spending up to that, though. I also really would dig any recommendations for romantic spots etc throughout the city?"
Charlottesville,39mwn2,Ninjazanus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"If you are space kind of people Observatory Hill or O Hill is a good place for star gazing. If you are more active, Ice Skating can be a lot of fun, not to mention being near down town opens you up to tons of good meal options.   Now before I go completely crazy with food options - what kind of cuisine are you looking for?   In the downtown area some great, cozy, but not too expensive places are ""Bang!"" which is kind of an Asian American Fusion Tapas bar with the best martinis in Cville. ""Monsoon"" is one of the best Thai places in town (and we have a  ton of them). And the Whiskey Jar, which is a bit more upbeat in atmosphere, but has great southern style food. Those are my top 3, reasonable budget downtown eats.   Let me know if you want any other recommendations by cuisine or part of town."
Charlottesville,39mwn2,Ninjazanus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I've heard about Observatory Hill actually, but never been. Would we be able to go up on a Sunday night? I know they do public nights on Fridays or something like that, but can you still go up to look at stars? I may actually want to do that.  In terms of food, I will generally eat anything, so I'm looking more for atmosphere and location (I do love Asian, though). Are any of those in the Downtown Mall?"
Charlottesville,39mwn2,Ninjazanus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"So Kokoro and Ten are both fantastic sushi/ Japanese places downtown. Ten is much more expensive, for which you get a more romantic atmosphere and more elegant looking food, but I honestly prefer the taste just about everything in Kokoro. Also, if you want to sit at a kotatsu, then the obvious choice is Kokoro. Also Monsoon is the best Thai place downtown, as previously mentioned. And you Kind of just have to look at Bang!'s menu to get a feel for it as far as your asian options go. All of the above are superb options, but my #1 recommendation goes to Kokoro as it is my most frequented date spot down town. (side note, we have gotten Tako Yaki every time we've been there, its just that good)"

Charlottesville,39mwn2,spicyeyeballs,4,Sat Jun 13 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"I started making this list before realizing you said Sunday night only. Oh well, here are Sunday night options:   Goochland Drive-In Movie theater Stargazing on Blue Ridge Parkway. There's a nice overlook just 1/4 mile south of I-64. Playing pool, board games, and arcade games at Firefly Go dancing - Sunday Salsa at Rapture, Swing dancing at Greek Orthodox Church on Wednesdays, etc. You have your choice of Salsa, swing, West Coast Swing, tango, and probably others, most with beginner lessons beforehand. Or just go to Escafe on a Friday or Saturday night after 11pm and get your club dancing fix.   And here are other options, in case you come back again:   Carter's Mountain - orchards and fruit picking, sometimes live music, gift shop, awesome view of Charlottesville Any of our 20+ local vineyards. I personally recommend Veritas, Glass House, and King Family. (During the summer, King Family has Polo on Sundays, and Veritas sometimes has live music) Grab a picnic lunch at Take It Away on the Corner and walk around the UVA gardens (quick, before the students come back!) Friday's After Five! Free concerts, food trucks, and beer Tour of Rt. 151 - Blue Mountain, Wild Wolf, and Devil's Backbone brewer, plus a ciderworks, vineyards, and a distillery. Helps to have a designated driver or do a taxi Beer Tour thing. Go to the SPCA and pet all the puppies and kittens. Free Wine and Beer tastings at Market St Wine shop. Lots of cool people! City Market on Saturday mornings."

It's got a swimming hole called Blue Hole. You could park in the parking lot there. The path to the left which immediately crosses the river leads to Blue Hole. But the road continues to the right and then it turns into a trail up to the Skyline Drive and the AT. So you could go up the right path. Get to the AT and head south. Camp somewhere up there. Continue south and take the alternate trail which leads back down to Sugar Hollow. You will hit Blue Hole sometime in the middle of the second day, which would be a nice reward. Google it, map it, and if you want more clear directions I'll be happy to provide them."

Charlottesville,38uv54,LuciDaydream3r,4,Sun Jun 7 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"I second the recommendation to go with something that uses Verizon's network.  Their phones work well indoors around here, largely because their network here uses the lower 700/800 MHz bands as opposed to the 1700/1900/2100 MHz bands most other networks use.  There are some dead spots, but the coverage is mostly good (I've seen a map of where their towers are in the area...it was surprising to see how many there are).  I've never had a problem with customer service with them, either.  Just make sure that if you go to a store for a customer service/tech support issue, you go to a corporate store and not an 'authorized retailer' or 'premium retailer' -- retailers will often want to charge you for something a corporate store will do for free.  They have two corporate stores in town -- on Rio across from the mall, and on 250 at the bottom of Pantops.  There's a huge difference between dealing with a CS representative on the other side of the world, and being face-to-face with one."

Charlottesville,38uv54,Ultimateforeveralone,2,Fri Jun 12 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"Hi there, i am a cell phone rep for charlottesville so i actually know the answer to this!  To make your search easy. Know that most of the cell towers around here are owned by verizon. So pick a company that is friendly with them if you want the best reception. At&t is great for the highways and some of the hills. But it usually sucks indoors. Sprint is great if you want a vary expensive paperweight. I used to use the tracphone and net 10 stuff all the time around here and i was fairly happy with it. Price is the other thing that is pretty easy these days. Most of the no contract phones will still have a monthly fee. And if its a smart phone its not likely to go below 30 a month. Thats any smartphone, Even if its crap at the smart stuff.  Regular phones you can go as low as 15 from what ive seen.   If you want some form of internet on the device your looking at at least 50 a month right now. Wallmart and best buy sometimes have deals on the phones. You could even try target.   4g is a bit tricky to answer. The reality is that we dont get real 4g here. Though most reps wont say that. Easy test is compare our 4g to richmond. Theirs is waaaaaay faster. But our 4g is still pretty nice. You wont get alot of buffering in the morning or late evening. Also the reception bars you see on your phone indicating how much reception you have? Yea they dont mean anything."
Charlottesville,38uv54,Ultimateforeveralone,3,Sun Jun 7 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""we don't get real 4g here""?  Comparing speeds in two cities doesn't tell the whole story -- XLTE (which Charlottesville was one of the launch cities for) basically doubles the bandwidth between your phone and the tower, but that won't do any good if the tower is overloaded."

This ended up being a large problem for us because she ended up losing her card. No card, no transfer, no money.

Charlottesville,38ryix,2_old_2B_clever,3,Sat Jun 6 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"As the owner of multiple businesses I've used several banks. Here's my take on them for personal banking services. I'll start with the good news.   Schwab Investor Checking - Not local but highly recommended. They refund ATM fees so you can just walk up to any bank, use their ATM and you'll pay no fees at all. They were one of the first to offer an app that let you deposit checks remotely. They are usually the leaders in the industry instead of always playing catch up. Finally, their customer service is astoundingly good. They are used to dealing with savvy customers and know their stuff. They don't hire kids or offshore call centers to ""help"" you. Don't fuck around with the locals.  VNB - Very slow to adopt new tech. They still don't have an app to deposit checks remotely and their online banking is 5 years behind their competitors. They are also very conservative lenders. Even after banking with them for years and paying off multiple loans they still treated me like a criminal when applying for loans. Also, they charge silly fees for basic services...and no service. Other banks make life much easier.  UVACCU - The upside is they keep their fees low because they're a credit union. The big downside is if you ever need to do anything other than basic banking they get lost fast. Something as simple as wiring money to a bank in London was a huge headache. I sat in the branch using my cell phone to look up how to do it for the bank employees who don't even have Internet access at work. Really. No Internet access. Don't try to do a home mortgage with them either. Long story.  Bank of America will screw you every chance they get. Also, high fees."
Charlottesville,38ryix,gsimd,2,Sat Jun 6 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"Even after banking with them for years and paying off multiple loans they still treated me like a criminal when applying for loans.

That said, you may want to checkout Virginia National Bank for a local'ish flavor."

Charlottesville,38ryix,IlikeCondors,2,Sat Jun 6 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"Second, I use Wells Fargo and have for years and they're pretty great. I don't want the bells and whistles I just want someone who will keep my money until I want to spend it and then let me spend it.   Also, I got my info stolen a few months ago to the tune of about $4000 and they alerted me like within the hour, cancelled my card, cancelled the charges and sent me a new card in one phone call.

Charlottesville,38ryix,monoclediscounters,2,Sat Jun 6 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"How important is having local branches to you? If you don't find yourself going to them that often you could try online banking such as Ally, Simple, or Capital One 360. A lot of them refund ATM fees and such.

They have an app with mobile check deposit and full mobile banking that I've been very satisfied with."
Charlottesville,38ryix,_RE_TARDIS,2,Sat Jun 6 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"I concur with others that recommend UVACCU. Been with them for over 2 years now and literally don't have any bad things I can say about them. The only problem is traveling and ATMs. Since it's a local CU, you'll get charged service charges for using out of network ATMs if you're away from the area. However, I haven't had any other problems with them."
Charlottesville,38ryix,jonassalone,2,Sat Jun 6 21:09:21 2015 UTC,"If you're semi tech-literate and don't get paid in cash, I strongly recommend going with Charles Schwab Bank.  No ATM fees (credit back if you use someone elses), interest on checking, amazing customer service, mobile check deposit, no fees/minimums/etc.  Obviously the trade-off is you cannot walk into a branch.  Upon realizing the last time I did that was like 2008, I decided CS was perfect given the benefits."
Charlottesville,38ryix,MickeyDMouse,2,Sat Jun 6 22:47:47 2015 UTC,"Bias because I happen to work for BB&T, and almost didn't chime in until you said you were with PNC. So here goes:  If you are not going to have paychecks direct deposited, go with a credit union. If you are going to overdraw a lot, go with a credit union.   However, if you like having branches close by in case and if you plan to travel a bit in the US go with a larger bank. ATM access is less and less important, but it's really nice when you need it. BBT is Maryland down to FL, over to TX with TN and KY thrown in. Soon to add PA & NJ at the end of this year. With 6 branches in Cville, more in Ruckersville, Crozet, Palmyra, Scottsville, Fork Union, Mineral, Gordonsville and Lovingston no other bank comes close to the coverage of BBT locally.  If you like online banking, DEFINATELY go with a larger bank. I have had to help people with their VNB and UVACU and Blue Ridge bank and on and on - and they all suck. Seriously, ask them to show you it before you open the account. It's a fair request. Truth is those banks can't afford to invest in a solid online platform and let's not even go into their security. Also, you said you liked PNC wallet - well BBT is 2 months away from a very similar platform which will be very similar and include P2P transfers.  Lastly, the people are pretty fantastic too. Of course service is relative to the employee in front of you, but BBT has good people and if you find one you don't like - there is another branch with someone you do 1 mile away."

Charlottesville,38e386,TitsMcGrits,4,Wed Jun 3 16:44:08 2015 UTC,You should check out Charlottesville Rec center. Smith aquatic and fitness center is 39 a month or 390 for the year.
Charlottesville,38e386,ram_it_VA,3,Thu Jun 4 02:53:47 2015 UTC,They're not cheap. My wife did a 30 day trial for $30 but the regular price would've jumped to about $90/month for an individual. Our neighbors have a family membership and I think they pay about $180/month.
Charlottesville,38e386,cdhicks21,2,Wed Jun 3 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"If I remember it's about $90/month with a $200 sign up fee. Not cheap, and not open 24/7. It's smaller and no pool, but if all you need is free weights, machines, and cardio, I'd look into Snap Fitness. $40/month"
Charlottesville,38e386,howmuchlongerdoihave,2,Wed Jun 3 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's right for an individual, though they'll waive the sign-up fee during some promotions. OP is looking for a family rate though. I know couples and roommates can join together ($75/month, if I recall), but not sure the family rate. And yes, the hours leave much to be desired. :("
Charlottesville,38e386,kuanes,2,Wed Jun 3 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"I kind of remember paying between $80 and $90 because I worked at UVA.  If you can make it out there, the Albemarle Square one is a little more chill (YMMV)."
Charlottesville,38e386,Logiber,2,Wed Jun 3 19:00:57 2015 UTC,"For a single, it's 90/month for everything except tennis and waterpark, 115 if you want the tennis and waterpark. Great facility; I just joined a couple weeks ago and I've been loving it. I definitely get my money's worth. Not sure about the signup fee as I signed up when they were doing free enrollment but if you have the money, I highly recommend it."

Charlottesville,36zvoo,spicyeyeballs,3,Sat May 23 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for more breweries you should be able to walk to http://cvillebrewco.com/  I know in the past it hasn't been the best in town, but they got a new brewer awhile ago, so it might be worth a shot."
Charlottesville,36zvoo,YoScott,1 point,Sat May 23 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"Their new brewer is no longer with them. And while I wish them success, the brew has not improved."
Charlottesville,36zvoo,spicyeyeballs,2,Tue May 26 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"That is too bad.    The owner seemed to think all he had to do was open a veteran owned brewery and people would come even if he couldn't brew good beer.  He told me that things weren't going well and they would likely close by last October if things didn't pick up.  I talked to them at homebrew for hunger they seemed to understand the need for, you know good beer and that the new brewer would help with that.   To bad he left."
Charlottesville,36zvoo,YoScott,2,Tue May 26 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"Last I heard through the grapevine is that instead of paying for an established brewer, he's decided to expand his operation and go into distribution and hope to make money there.  I hope that's not true, because more money can be made by hiring someone to actually make a drinkable product. The Location is great and would be successful with a re-launch."
Charlottesville,36zvoo,the5thLight,5,Wed May 27 14:34:24 2015 UTC,"If you're staying within city limits, make sure to visit   Three Notched, which has several beers on tap, and where you can buy 6 packs of their two most popular beers; Champion, which has about 5 or 6 on tap, and sells cans of several of their brews; And if time allows, South Street, whose beer is not quite as good, but they serve food.   If you have time to get out of town and don't mind a 45 minute drive west into the foothills of the Blue Ridge, which in my opinion is some of the most beautiful land this side of the Mississippi, then you must visit Devils Backbone. They serve food, and their Vienna Lager is, in my opinion, the best beer in the world.  Other area breweries are Wild Wolf (very good beer) and Blue Mountain (better than average, but not the best around)."
Charlottesville,36zvoo,the5thLight,1 point,Sat May 23 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, southern Delaware and some of Maryland are just starting to get a few of the Devil's Backbone.  Driving 45 minutes further is just a bit too much because it will already be about a 4-5 hour return trip.  It will definitely be on my list if I can come back again.  Hopefully we can find something interesting a a local liquor store."
Charlottesville,36zvoo,sosoosos,0,Mon May 25 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"As mentioned by others, the local stores have a decent selection of local brews. Unfortunately, many of the best brews aren't sold in bottles or cans. DB's Vienna lager and 8 point ipa are readily available, but if you find a place with 3 notch'd grey ghost or south st's roux on tap, make sure to have one."

Charlottesville,36zvoo,daytonwestpark,2,Tue May 26 00:57:52 2015 UTC,"3 notch'd is my favorite of the three you mentioned. they do sell beer to go, in the growler or in packs of (what i assume are) cans on the left side of the bar. not a build your own setup though. their berliner weisse is solid if you like the tart thing.  if the rink is on the mall somewhere, there are a few spots on market street you can probably grab some local beers like market street market or market street wine shop. beer run is a ~15 minute walk from the east end of the mall (carlton and meade) and has as big a selection as any bottle shop in cville. costs a bit more than buying elsewhere, but you can build your own 6 pack there and the employees can point you to anything cool they have from anyone local"
Charlottesville,36zvoo,alicemonster,5,Sat May 23 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"Go to 3 Notched and Champion and South St. to drink their draft beers. And trust me, for Champion and 3 Notched you will not be disappointed. Go to Beer Run on your way out of town and pick up any number of local beers in 6 packs to take home. In fact, Beer Run's brunch is far superior to South Street's. Maybe combine that errand. I hope you enjoy your time down here!"
Charlottesville,36zvoo,the5thLight,1 point,Sat May 23 19:02:57 2015 UTC,Thanks!  My girlfriend is a mac & cheese fan and South has a build your own thing on the menu.  Maybe we can do a late dinner at one and then brunch at the other.  Beer Run will be definitely a last top as we leave town then!
Charlottesville,36zvoo,alicemonster,2,Mon May 25 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"Three notched doesn't do 6 packs.  They do, however, do growlers.  You can buy a growler from them for like, $5, then fill it up there for somewhere between $9-13, depending on the beer, or bring your own and pay an extra $2 to fill it up.  Totally worth it, in my opinion!"
Charlottesville,36zvoo,OldInTown,3,Sat May 23 16:45:56 2015 UTC,Three Notched has a fridge full of 6 packs of 40 Mile and Hydraulion Red.
Charlottesville,36zvoo,YoScott,2,Sat May 23 22:16:31 2015 UTC,Really?  well I guess I've never noticed!  Good to know!  Sorry for the incorrect info.  Still a big fan of their growlers though :)

Charlottesville,36jk37,prdycool,14,Tue May 19 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"YAY meetups! :) I've recently moved back from DC so I thought I'd share what has worked for the DC reddit meetups! The DC meetup is usually held in a park on a Saturday afternoon and done potluck style with grilling done in the park. People bring music, hookah, board/card games (done at picnic tables) and outdoor games (frisbee, football, corn hole, slack line, hula hoops) and it's very successful (think adult field day). It was also held in someone's house one year with a large back yard (I think fewer members RSVP'd that year) with video games inside and activities outside (and drinking, which is harder to do in public parks). It was all organized with a spreadsheet on the reddit page of what people were bringing and RSVPs were handled through a meetup.com page. I'm not very familiar with public spaces in Charlottesville so I can't really recommend anything specific. Maybe pick a date and poll how many people plan to come and then pick a space accordingly?"

If you show up ~20 minutes before they open, you could probably get a table there. Or hit up a vineyard with a picnic.  I went wine tasting on graduation weekend last year and it was a little more crowded than usual but not unpleasantly so.  You could also look into brunch/lunch at the breweries on Route 151.

One thing I'm wondering is about places a bit up on 29.  PastureQ, Travinia, Taste of China, Bamboo House.  A good strategy might be to call those sorts of places, which are less obvious for students and parents, and after you have dinner go back downtown to stroll around, browse used books, have an ice cream cone etc.  The mall should be lively and fun with all of the people."

All in all, not a bad place but it does depend on what part of the complex you end up in.  Some buildings/areas tend to be louder/rowdier than others.  It does have a shuttle to the university/hospital area which may or may not be useful to you.  Stone Creek Village is nice and I don't know anything about Carriage Hill.   And I agree with /u/KawiZX6R that the Villas at Southern Ridge are good.  A really good friend of mine lives there so I'm pretty familiar with the area.

We complained about it to their regional manager who came over and told us that we are expecting too much, the place was ""just a rental"". They own a few other complexes in the area so be aware."

My brother's father-in-law is a optometrist and gets us glasses at cost, and whenever we get new ones, we send him a picture of the frames we like, and he sends back a picture of the styles he has that are similar. Sometimes he has the exact same frames, sometimes not. Good luck on your glasses."
Charlottesville,35wp4m,Mmmmpizza,3,Thu May 14 03:27:59 2015 UTC,I feel like it's always smelt weird here.
Charlottesville,35wp4m,Cut_the_dick_cheese,2,Thu May 14 13:05:08 2015 UTC,To expand on MoondogVikingOf6thAv...municipal water around here is reservoir water and quite often acquires a smell (swampy/algae-y) in hot weather (probably as stuff starts to grow in the more or less stagnant reservoir).  All city tests say it's safe to consume but it can smell pretty bad.  I filter all my water and it removes the smell.  Couple years ago it was so bad my laundry came out of the wash smelling but it went away once the clothes dried.  The intensity of the smell varies all over Cville.

She doesn't have to do this, but she was with us during the whole selection process. She also drops by our house during the building process, and knowing what our selections are, she is able to make sure they're getting us what they want. The home buying experience has been a pleasurable rather than stressful one. Two of my other coworkers have also used her.   I've used Mike B at First Heritage Mortgage and he's been really good too. He's always been there for questions, is extremely responsive, and eager to help. Lee McAllister at Fulton Mortgage was great too--she explained everything in great detail and helped us really understand what getting a mortgage was like. We only didn't go with her because we wanted certain credits that we could only get with FH."

I understand your desire to go local with a mortgage company, but I would at least price out the differences in cost with other lenders (find high rated ones on Zillow or something) so you know how much more you'll be paying.  In most instances you'll pay a hefty premium for this choice, but will likely get better service.  I would at least get some quote comparisons and let your local lender try to sell you on why his quote is better."

On rare occasions, a UH-60 can be seen departing the area. I did a ride along with a cop who during his rookie year drove past the no trespassing sign. When he got to the top of the hill, a concrete barrier came out of the ground and blocked his entrance. A voice from a speaker told him to turn around. Fast forward a few months, he was actually called back to the base to remove a deer that had gotten its head stuck in the chain fence that surrounds the perimeter. He was instructed to meet the guard below to be escorted up. When he got to the gate there was no guard so he proceeded all the way to the top, this time not being stopped by a barrier. He got out of his patrol car was soon surrounded by personnel yelling at him. Security guard eventually caught up out of breath and started yelling while getting yelled at. Long story short, he removed the deer and got the hell out. He got a pretty good look and told me the structures up there are huge and that satellite pictures don't do them justice."

Charlottesville,34vmca,anonreview,13,Mon May 4 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"I ate there a lot when I was younger (Hispanic) and while none of us have the right to tell you your feelings were right or wrong, I think you went about expressing it the wrong way.   Systemic racism is real, but it isn't about conspiracy and collusion to act prejudicially under subterfuge, it's about systems that undervalue and underrepresent minorities.   Could this establishment have a policy of discriminating against minorities? Sure, but not likely. Could this waitress have a history of refusing to serve minorities? Sure, but not likely. What's as likely is that it was Saturday, they are busy, understaffed, and she isn't a great waitress. What's as likely is that she knows what kind of joint they are and that if she spends all her time serving regulars and groups of 4+ then she will get a lot more in tips than if she focuses on small tables.   You felt what you felt, and nothing we say should change that. But just because you felt it doesn't mean it was true. And to write a Yelp and Reddit review where you express these feelings as facts just hurts your argument. Stick to things you know to be true. And consider calling and asking to speak to a manager. That Yelp review won't change anything. Telling a manager that you had a bad experience, irrespective of perceived racial undertones, might have a bigger impact than you think."
Charlottesville,34vmca,tnofuentes,12,Tue May 5 12:42:05 2015 UTC,"Talk to the manager.  If the waitress is just a rogue employee, the manager needs to know about her.  If it actually is systematic at this place (not likely, but possible), they will at least know that you noticed."
Charlottesville,34vmca,Cvilledog,3,Tue May 5 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"I would second this. Speaking to the manager/owner is going to get better results in many cases than a Yelp review, assuming this is an aberration. The Yelp review route assumes 1) that they will be aware of the review, 2) that they won't dismiss it as some anonymous person made up."
Charlottesville,34vmca,random_phd,3,Tue May 5 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"Restaurant owners are aware of their yelp reviews. I usually think it's a good idea to try and clear things up with the owner before blasting them on the Internet, but a yelp review will get their attention and give them an opportunity to clear it up."
Charlottesville,34vmca,Cvilledog,1 point,Tue May 5 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"I think many owners are aware, but perhaps not all. My concern, with which others may disagree, is that a Yelp review is both a very public forum and a very impersonal one. For that reason, the subject of the review may be defensive and dismissive in response. It also runs the risk of taking an unfortunate incident and turning it into a semi-permanent mark against the subject since any action taken by the subject is unlikely to result in the Yelp review being taken down, as the review writer may not even be aware of those actions. If the goal is to flame the subject or discourage others from patronizing the establishment by presenting a critical assessment, then a Yelp review may be the way to go. (I've certainly written critical reviews where I thought the place was overpriced, for example.) If the goal is to see a response to a specific incident, then it may or may not be effective. I would argue it has less chance of being effective than contacting the owner directly - by e-mail, phone, or even a written letter, if there is a concern about face-to-face confrontation."
Charlottesville,34vmca,49erlew,-1,Wed May 6 01:13:54 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I posted the review and this post here to make others aware of the experience we had at this establishment. I understand that they themselves may be skeptical of who posted the review. It was embarrassing enough for me to go up there and pay so we can get out of there after feeling like we were discriminated against but to then take it a step further and potentially tell someone their sister/cousin, or other family member is apparently racist may have escalated the matter and I did not feel comfortable doing that in this particular situation."
Charlottesville,34vmca,howmuchlongerdoihave,2,Tue May 5 02:04:52 2015 UTC,"I did not feel comfortable doing that in this particular situation.   So, you don't feel comfortable addressing this issue in person... but you're okay with launching a campaign against the establishment via the internet?  I know that this sounds harsh, but it doesn't seem like you made any attempts to attain an explanation while you were there. Instead, you looked at the situation and assumed the very worst about every other person who was involved. How is that really any different than what you're accusing this establishment was.  Of course, I have no idea what was actually going on. They very may well be a building full of bigots over there. They may have intentionally ignored you. They may have even done so after giving you your drinks, ensuring that you felt obligated to wait and prolong your humiliation as long as possible.  Or... she may have just been a crap server, or she may have been in the weeds. She may have taken your drink order to cover for another waitress, not realizing that the smoke break she thought she was covering hadn't ended.  There are myriad explanations for what happened. None of them make your experience acceptable, but unless you know both sides of the story... it's pretty irresponsible to play the race card."
Charlottesville,34vmca,tamaydo,4,Thu May 7 16:00:25 2015 UTC,It's a family run joint from the looks of it. Not the same as going to Cheesecake factory where I could easily speak to a manager.
Charlottesville,34vmca,howmuchlongerdoihave,5,Tue May 5 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"Even a family-run joint will have a manager.  Heck, they might care more than a large chain -- if a family's livelihood is at stake, they're going to want to do everything possible to protect their business's reputation.  The manager at your local fast food place probably doesn't give two shits if you don't like the chain; this will be much different for a family-owned place."
Charlottesville,34vmca,YoScott,-6,Tue May 5 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with you I really do. If you are operating under the assumption that they are always doing the right thing and do not have ill intentions when it comes to ""ethnic"" patrons. But what I am trying to get across is, if one or more operates under the premise that they are in some way superior, than from their standpoint we may be insignificant therefore what we have to say or feel may not matter. This is the way we felt we were treated. I understand that in some ways it is a little bit of a ""you had to be there to get it"" type of situations."
Charlottesville,34vmca,figureinplastic,10,Tue May 5 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know this place, and I'm not saying racism doesn't exist in this town, but I'm not sure this is it.  It would seem that if they brought you drinks, they weren't refusing to serve you.  Did you tip last time you were in there? Maybe the waitress remembered you as a bad tipper. Did you let them know why you were leaving and give them a chance to offer an explanation? Is it possible the other table were perhaps friends or relatives of the staff?"
Charlottesville,34vmca,monoclediscounters,-2,Tue May 5 00:00:17 2015 UTC,"Last time we went we had a decent experience. I usually tip anywhere from 18-20% Which I thought was a decent amount. Aside from the weird looks the first visit, nothing else out of the ordinary occurred. It seemed like a much older couple was in charge the first time we went (Grandma and Grandpa are the owners maybe?) And that older woman was polite with us.   I wish I was wrong about how we were treated and that it was just a fluke but the vibes we picked up were much more hostile than ""I just forgot about your table"" kind of thing. I am trying to be as logical as I can but the whole experience was pretty terrible.  And yes at first we did not think anything was wrong, she brought our drinks and it was fine but she never came back for maybe 30 minutes. Obviously they wouldn't put themselves at risk by outright telling us they would not serve us, so I am guessing they go about it in a more discrete and programmatic way.  It is a very small place, and after the 30+ minutes of waiting we really did not feel welcomed, the last thing I was going to do was try and make a scene. I told the man who I paid ""I just want to pay so we can leave please"""
Charlottesville,34vmca,dan1101,7,Tue May 5 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"so I am guessing they go about it in a more discrete and programmatic way.   I think you're really stretching it here to try to confirm an idea that you have convinced yourself is true.  Do you think a server at Riverside would really have some devious plan including serving drinks but not food to strategically discriminate against certain races?    Considering your first interaction with the wait staff was fine, I'd say it is entirely possible you either had a bad waitress, or a waitress that spaced out.  I spent years working in restaurants, and I can tell you that sometime you have a bad day.  I have had tables that I sat, took drinks orders for them, got swamped with 4 other tables sat at the same time, and then poof, I completely forgot about my first table.  It happens.  Were there other servers?  Maybe there was a miscommunication and she asked another server to take your food order since she had multiple tables that were sat after you, and it never got carried out?  I am just not sure immediately jumping to race distrimination is the appropriate response to this situation where you had one experience of bad service."
Charlottesville,34vmca,greekdoughnut,1 point,Tue May 5 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"All the points you made are valid, and to sit here and say that none of those were the case and it is a fact that we were discriminated against would be silly. And as I have said in other replies,  this is our perception of what happened. We did not simply jump to conclusions, it was more of a progression. We sat with our drinks for a while making jokes that she must have forgot about us... you know, making light of it because at that point we did not suspect anything, I'm being real about it, we are all human we all make mistakes. It was not until we were looking at her and she looked back did we begin to think something was wrong. And that happened a couple times. My fiance mentioned that as I was walking up to pay they both looked at each other while the waitress was sort of slapping around one of those little orange menus in her hand. Again it may sound silly to focus so much on the details of what exactly happened, it is just hard to communicate the mannerisms and the feeling of it all."
Charlottesville,34vmca,iseducationpower,2,Tue May 5 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Hard to communicate the ""vibe"" via text."
Charlottesville,34vmca,iseducationpower,4,Tue May 5 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"I eat here at least once a week, and more often than not, the service can be a little slow, to non-existent.  Depends on the crowd.  If the place is full, forget about getting refills on drinks.  The servers, though friendly, only come by when theres no food on your table.    I'm not saying what you experienced wasn't racism. But I'm as white as they come, and I get the same kind of odd treatment from time to time there.   Still, it might be my favorite Griddle-burger in town.  That's why I keep going back."
Charlottesville,34vmca,werdswerdswerds,1 point,Tue May 5 20:19:07 2015 UTC,"Completely understandable, and yes the food was good which is why we were making are way back several weeks later for our second visit. I did my best to give all the details I could but it really was not packed. Especially compared to our first visit. And yet our first visit was ""normal"". Excluding the older couple we saw working during our first visit the rest of the staff seemed the same. I will reiterate that I am very aware of the human element of things... but what I have been trying to get across is that it seemed to us much more than just bad service."
Charlottesville,34vmca,JPNastyDogg,4,Tue May 5 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"The place isn't that big...why didn't you actively try to flag down your waitress when you were ready to order?

Charlottesville,34vmca,iseducationpower,2,Tue May 5 15:52:48 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, I just went into Riverside tonight with a friend, and a waitress greeted us and took our drink order before we even sat down.  She brought the drinks promptly and asked if we were ready to order, we said we needed a minute.  We decided, and waited, and waited, like 10 minutes, but she never stopped by our table to take our order.  There were 2 waitresses working.  Finally I flagged down the other waitress and asked which one of them was our waitress and she said ""Oh, we haven't got your order yet?""  From then on she was our waitress and our service was fine."

We also had a certain amount to spend (per landlord's instructions) so they worked with us on that too. I would use them again in a heartbeat. Great job cleaning the house as well, it was spotless, and the last tenants left it a real mess. Also left us some extra cleaning supplies so we could keep using it on the stove grates. Felt like they cared about their clients, not just getting the job done."
Charlottesville,341ysj,crimesofthemind,9,Mon Apr 27 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unmarked cars in non-sting situations are completely ridiculous. I can see going undercover if you are drying to catch the leader of a drug cartel - but regular civilians?  You gotta ask yourself (and them, if you ever get the chance) What is the PURPOSE of the police? to prevent crime or to catch people committing crimes. Seems to me everyone would drive slower and more safely if there were MARKED police cars all over town!   Isn't driving more safely the goal rather than busting people for speeding? Sounds like a philosophy of punishment and retaliation instead of prevention to me."
Charlottesville,341ysj,iseducationpower,3,Tue Apr 28 08:18:39 2015 UTC,My former home town put in a policy to allow the local officers use their patrol car as a personal vehicle.  They eliminated speed traps and such at the same time.  The result was seeing the police cars all over the place in normal traffic and no way to know if that officer was on duty or not. So rather than trying to trap people they just made themselves super visible.  Worked well in my opinion.
Charlottesville,341ysj,theslats,2,Tue Apr 28 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that people are more likely to drive safely if any car could could pull them over, rather than just marked cars."

I find the entire concept of unmarked cars predatory in nature and it easily makes an enemy of the police. They're no longer here for your protection or as watch dogs, they're wolves set to prey upon you for infractions, enforcing the law through fear of reprisal, by definition setting them up for an adversarial relationship with the public.  As a kid I was told I could always trust a police officer. They stood on the open. Highly visible and approachable for anything from helping a lost kid to stopping bank robberies. Now, even when the local bike cope are around, I avert my gaze and speak quieter. The two are related."

Charlottesville,33d3xm,outofcapecod,2,Tue Apr 21 22:19:07 2015 UTC,I went to blue ridge just last week to try and get six simple 1 color shirts printed. They told me minimum order is 12 and that it would take two weeks. I think it is the busy season for them with frats and spring time in general. I got the same answer from crazy horse as well. Go DIY if you need to get it done any time soon.
Charlottesville,33d3xm,daytonwestpark,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:31:14 2015 UTC,"Wrote to both and neither could help me with such a small order, but Blue Ridge sent me to Zip Print and they did the one shirt for only $15. Pretty good deal."

One restaurant that I love that is too new for the C-Ville list is Lampo. They don't do reservations and are tiny, so get there early or be prepared to wait!  Only microbreweries are allowed to serve alcohol without selling food in Virginia, so there aren't really any traditional bars around. That being said there are several good bars on the downtown mall or the corner (near UVa)."

Charlottesville,33a69i,mathematicus,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, there are a ton of places around. If I had to pick favorite restaurants in four categories it would go something like:  Cheap (Under $10): Bodo's, Stick's Kebob, Al Carbon Chicken (way up by Lowe's)  Moderate ($10-20): Beer Run, Michael's Bistro, Continental Divide  Expensive (~$20): Brookville (which has gotten cheaper recently), The Local  Special Occasion: C&O, Commonwealth  These aren't necessarily the best places in town, but they're where my wife and I end up the most."

Other places I like--Citizen Burger (upscale burgers), Al Carbon (authentic Mexican), Commonwealth (they have a bar that's nice, so I'm told), Timberwood Grill (extensive beer selection, food is pretty good not great), Taste of China (authentic Asian--love the bubble pancakes!), Vocelli Pizza (regional chain, the cheese makes this pizza).

Charlottesville,33a5h5,swoon_squad,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"I went there the other day. Asked for a buzz cut: #3 on top, #2 on the sides.  What I got was a #2 on the sides and about an inch and a half flat top. Another guy, I assume was the owner, came up to me and asked if I had wanted a buzz cut or a ""regular hair cut"". I said I had asked for a buzz cut, but I thought I was going to be late for work so I just paid and left. When I got to my car and realized A) That I did have time to get it fixed before work and B) how bad it actually looked, I went back in.  The second attempt at a buzz cut with a #3 guard involved scissors, and resulted in about an inch of feathered hair on top of my head. By now, I'm late for work and my hair still looks horrible.  I ended up buying a set of clippers that afternoon and finishing it myself.  I hate to be all crazy right-wing MURICA speak MURICAN or GIT OUT guy, but if you don't understand even the basics of your profession in the language native to the land in which you practice it... you've really got to change something.

It was mixed very well and sounded great at the show - but definitely loud as FUCK. I believe Snoop's tour used a different production/sound company than is standard at the Pavilion, so this could play into it.   Also I'm pretty sure you can crank pre-recorded music (which is what Snoop was using) much louder than actual live instruments."

Charlottesville,3315ly,49erlew,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"With the right setup you can crank live instruments as well.  I saw Deftones at a festival in Florida a few years back. It was too loud, even for me... we moved to the far end of the field, over a quarter of a mile away, and it was pretty much normal concert volume level.  I wasn't there to see them, just getting my money's worth. I became a fan that night. That was one hell of a show, even from that far away."
Charlottesville,3315ly,tnofuentes,2,Tue Apr 21 02:02:49 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people pointed out how loud it was compared to other events, though I wonder what the lease actually says about noise levels. If you live near a venue, beware. I wonder whether there's an argument to be made about bass heavy music having a different standard than SPL from a distance. The other question is whether the issue was more familiarity with the type of music. Rap and hip hop concerts aren't nearly as common there as many other styles, so it might stand out more than say rock or country."

If I'm paying you a supremely expensive monthly fee, you install that crap yourself. Lock me into at least a year contract, fine.  But hell if I'm paying $200 or $300 fee.

You're leaving potential customers on the table there.  To put it another way, you're already offering a low cost plan for 5/5, right? So, clearly 5/5 is profitable to you.

He specializes in vintage and custom jewelry and is really great at what he does. I got a vintage 1920s diamond and platinum engagement ring there and he made me a custom wedding band with the same tiny forget me not flower design that the engagement ring has. I seriously can not recommend them highly enough and they are super reasonably priced. I accidentally damaged some of the filigree work on one of my rings a couple of years ago when I almost mangled my hand; I thought my ring was ruined but he was able to clean it all up and get it back to its original state using lasers to repair it. He did all that, again, at a shockingly reasonable price and I was without my ring for only a few days."

We custom designed my wedding band, with sapphires and diamonds all around that perfectly match the ones in my engagement ring, and the price was much less than we had expected, and they were really attentive and friendly through the whole process.  I definitely think it's worth looking at a few stores, but they're absolutely worth a look."

It cost about 50% of the watch value to repair and took a month longer than they quoted. When I did get the watch back it broke again 2 weeks later. They did fix again but I wasn't pleased with the customer service across the whole experience.  Wasn't the worst but wouldn't recommend. Watch repair might be different than engagement ring buying etc.

Charlottesville,31klcd,michaelconfoy,9,Sun Apr 5 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"So, on the one hand, I commend RS for allowing an entirely independent investigation into what went wrong with its full cooperation. IMO, that's great leadership. On the other hand, how are they not at least publicly firing the author and her immediate editor? IMO, that's terrible leadership, and at the very least, those 2 needed to be publicly disciplined (probably fired). As an investigative journalist, it's simply inexcusable to not investigate an article of this magnitude."
Charlottesville,31klcd,katie333,6,Mon Apr 6 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"What is clear to me is that there's a failure of leadership that goes all the way up to Will Dana. He has (incredibly) praised his staff despite this complete fucking trainwreck, and has publicly stated that nobody will be reprimanded. How can you get the basics of journalism that wrong and not even see a goddamned paycut? That just sends the message to the rest of your staff: ""there's zero accountability for utterly and completely failing at your job"".   Whatever tiny shred of journalistic integrity RS was clinging to before this has been lost. The fact that they got a third party to come in and investigate the failure means nothing if there is not fundamental, widespread change to ensure that this doesn't happen again. It was obvious from her notes that Erdeley was out looking for a story to confirm her narrative about ""rape culture"", and that alone should be enough for her to be canned or demoted to the mail room. It's completely backwards. And then there's the fact that she straight-up lied about speaking with Jackie's friends. And how the hell do you not fire the fact-checker, who failed spectacularly in the thing that is the title and very essence of their position? It's astounding."

Charlottesville,31klcd,KingWilson128,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:37:14 2015 UTC,They should sue and hope to settle for something and Rolling Stone should be reasonable and make up for their mistakes and not bring in their high-powered lawyers and go to court.

Charlottesville,31dhey,JPNastyDogg,2,Mon Jun 15 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"Basically, a developer tried to build a luxury hotel on the mall, but when the recession hit, the bank that was financing the project went under. The developer made lots of promises, but on further inspection, all of his projects across the country were in a similar state of being not funded or completed.  It took the city a few years to be able to reclaim the project and sell the rights to another developer. They finally did, and that developer promised and promised that he'd be starting it soon (I think in 2011??), all he had to do was finish another project in South Carolina.  Well, that took forever, but it's supposedly done. And he hasn't done shit on the Landmark hotel. In fact, when the city forced him to secure the property because of vandalism, etc happening inside, he fought back (and lost).  So there it sits, and the city council was duped once more.  Meanwhile, the city council remains unaware that it's not playing a game of monopoly, and that they are not actually obligated to build a hotel on every spot they land on. So now there are (two) proposed hotels at the corner of 10th and West Main, a hotel being built on the corner of West Main and Ridge Mac, a proposed hotel (shot down for now) for the corner of Ridge and Cherry, in addition to the hotels that have been built in the Stonefield area (at least one of which is in the County).  So by the time that someone actually does get around to having the ability to do the Landmark, it will not make financial sense anymore because the hotel shortage will have turned into a hotel surplus."

Charlottesville,31dhey,dcheesi,2,Sat Apr 4 21:15:54 2015 UTC,"I can't find the source at the moment, but I recall reading somewhere that they can't use it for anything other than a hotel, pending some permit issues. Of course, the Council can always change that, but add 5 years onto the process for doing so. This is the same municipality that took 40 years to build the Meadowcreek parkway -- and in the end they got a two-lane road that won't even make up for the increased traffic due to the past 10 years of population growth."
Charlottesville,31dhey,the5thLight,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"I believe it can only be used as a hotel because the ceiling height would not allow for duct chases, thus each room requires it's own heating/cooling.

My understanding from the recycling advocates locally is that your best bet for sustainability within city limits is to get curbside compost through Black Bear (or compost at home), carefully sort recyclables into your green bin, and use a small container for residual trash.

My understanding from reading the details is that the portions are small and each general admission ticket only comes with 4 tasting tickets.  That doesn't seem like an amazing amount of bacon for $30.  For more food, you need to purchase additional tickets and no matter what you need to purchase separate tickets for beer/cider.  If that's the case I don't necessarily see the awesomeness of this event, and think I'd be better off having some friends over to my house where everyone supplies a different 6-pack and a bacon recipe they found on Pinterest.

If you'll be here over the weekend, head to Parallel 38 at lunch for their Pork Belly Gyro, which is awesome. They also have the largest wine selection by the glass.   There are many breweries in the Charlottesville area, and a lot of them have live music. They're always fun to visit. Same goes for the wineries. Google ""Brew Ridge Trail"" and ""Monticello Wine Trail"", and you'll see a few options.   If you like tea and hookah, the Twisted Branch on the downtown mall is a great place to go and chill. If you want a quick snack while on the downtown mall, I would recommend Marco And Luca Dumplings.   If you like sushi, Now and Zen is one of our favorites. Reasonably priced and it's good quality."

Plenty of good restaurants there -- Citizen Burger, Ten, Alley Light, Commonwealth, etc.  If you're OK with driving a bit out of town, about 35 minutes west is Route 151, which is basically a corridor of fantastic breweries and wineries and spectacular mountain views.  Monticello is close, and is worth a visit.  UVA is also worthwhile to walk. The campus is beautiful and it would be a shame to not see it.  Other local restaurants worth visiting: Maya, Horse & the Hound, Bodos (for cheap breakfast!), and probably a billion more that I'm forgetting. We have a lot of restaurants.

Very small place though so try a week night.  Sedona Taphouse $$ (American) - Everything we tried good here  C&O Restaurant (Very pricy) $$$ (American) - super tasty but much more spendy  Hamilton's at First and Main $$$ (American) - also super tasty but spendy  Al Carbon Chicken $ (Southern - awesome chicken) - super cheap, super delicious.

Charlottesville,30bga5,insertamusingmoniker,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:17:04 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you, but... Charlottesville is very defensive of itself.  Try to not take it personally.  People here like to see themselves as bright blue, left-wing social-justice-warriors in the slowly purpling sea of red that makes up most of Virginia.  Looking back on the truth of Charlottesville's past stings and those same upper-middle-class folk that spend their wages to appear charitable, socially active and politically relevant want to sweep the truth of Charlottesville's history under the rug.  They want to be vocal about what they do and proud of the city they want to do it in, which by itself is not a bad thing.  I think Charlottesville's racially-divided history makes the strides this city has made all that much more important.  But not everyone sees it that way, they want to hide behind the curtain and pretend Charlottesville is the pinnacle of social equality and always has been.   This article is important.  More people need to read it.  Because I  think that unless we acknowledge our past fully, we can't move beyond it."

Charlottesville,30bga5,katie333,3,Fri Mar 27 02:32:01 2015 UTC,"This part of the state is pretty weird socio-politically. The city is a stark contrast to the rural areas even just 10 miles in each direction. The most-oft-heard voices around here are the ones who are loud for the sake of being loud; not because they're necessarily dedicated to the causes they're preaching but because they're working to be heard more than the groups that are making an effort to make real change.

In one year, we had 3 major incidents occur at or near our residence (attempted rape in front of the house, car stolen from the driveway and neighbors shot at by passers by).  I've lived in a lot of other neighborhoods in the city, and nothing close to this level of shenanigans has happened anywhere else, so I'd say that I could personally judge that part of town as less than safe."

Charlottesville,301ei7,Werepony,8,Mon Mar 23 18:32:49 2015 UTC,"honestly, there's nowhere that I would say is a definite no-go. There are definitely nicer and less-nice neighborhoods, but the less-nice neighborhoods still are largely family homes. There are few/no crack houses, and no real abandoned/run down neighborhoods. Many of the less nice neighborhoods are on the up-and-up, so you may be able to find rentals that have been fixed up for significantly less in these neighborhoods. You can walk pretty much anywhere in and around Charlottesville during the day time alone with very little concern for your safety.   There certainly are places I would not recommend you go while  alone at 2AM, but Charlottesville is largely a very safe place if you behave safely."

Charlottesville,2zz5ki,tnofuentes,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:44:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I guess I should have clarified my goals. I was hoping to live somewhere close to where there would be a lot of things to do. I've heard of the Corner and the Downtown Mall. From what it sounds like to me (I've been to neither), the Corner and the Mall both have restaurants, but the Corner has more bars that cater to UVA students, while the Mall has shops and stuff, but not much nightlife. Is that accurate?  I think my price range is in the $1000-1500 per month range, preferably lower. I'll be working at UVA so it would be nice to be close-ish to there."
Charlottesville,2zz5ki,tnofuentes,6,Mon Mar 23 03:57:20 2015 UTC,"Anyone telling you there's no nightlife downtown is interested only in getting as drunk as possible, as fast as possible, as cheaply as possible. Downtown is an awesome area, day and night; but it avoids the trashiness of the Corner at night. For that price you should be fine in one of the complexes on West Main, between The Corner and Downtown. The Flats and Walker Square come to mind, though there are a few newer ones too. For something less dense, the Belmont area is just off the Downtown mall and has its own restaurant scene. All those will be in your range, but if you want to go lower you'd be better off heading South rather than North because of looming traffic projects. Good luck!"
Charlottesville,2zz5ki,ericrz,2,Mon Mar 23 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"West Main is a great suggestion, walking distance to UVA, and the Corner, and downtown.

Charlottesville,2zz5ki,jah7va,2,Mon Mar 23 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"Awesome guys! West main looks pretty nice, considering it's walking distance to the medical center (where I'll be working) and the Downtown Mall. I'm looking for something more urban, and I'm not really looking to live in a house or anything. Tried looking at places like rent.com and zillow and haven't found much in the West Main area, only things I've found are what /u/tnofuentes suggested, like The Flats. It looks really nice, but seems like it caters more to undergrads, since all the rooms are pre-furnished. Any tips on where to look or what other complexes are around the area? Planning to drive to Charlottesville to scout it out in the next week or two. Could even up my price range a bit if the place is nice enough."
Charlottesville,2zz5ki,frontofficehotelier,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"Try brac.com or rentwithnest.com, both are great resources for rental units around town.

Charlottesville,2zz5ki,joethetipper,4,Tue Mar 24 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find downtown mall nightlife, while less crowded, most certainly exists, and tends to be a bit nicer all around.

I ended up picking a place in the newest building, Phase III, built in 2009, and it seems like it will work well. Either way it's on the side of the building so it only borders one apartment.   I am curious, what are the other issues when you were there?"

Sure, C'ville has plenty of culture and arts and wineries, but surrounding is basically what I have dubbed ""MS with mountains"". There's plenty of small town areas with festivals if that's more your bag.   Food? Well, there's plenty. Restaurants pop up and shut down all the time. Upscale southern is all the rage right now. I'm personally a fan of Timberwood Grill for sit down, and Littlejohn's as quick eats.   One good thing about C'ville being farther north is the authenticity of Eastern cuisines. I love Lemongrass (Thai/Viet) and Taste of China."

Charlottesville,2zurge,your_plag_is_showing,2,Sun Mar 22 21:45:34 2015 UTC,"Charlottesville isn't actually a City though they claim it to be, it is just a big town with a big university. The difference is that a city generally has an urban middle and suburbs surrounding, but Charlottesville is just all suburbs (though some places are more densely packed than others) with a near-instant transition to rural if you venture 10 minutes west, east or south (20 minutes north along 29, once you get past Hollymead/Target shopping center you've basically gone through it all, since Ruckersville hardly counts for much). It does not have a city vibe to it.  Everything is much more relax and easy going than you (I at least) would expect.  As for food, there is a thread about it once a month at least with people chirping in on their favorite X at Y place at Z time of day/year to avoid, or meet specific groups of people, so there's no sense to opening up another one now about it. Actually you know what, just take this http://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/wiki/index  The weather is better than mississipi, for sure.

We're small enough to have things like local farmers markets and big enough to attract the likes of Snoop Dogg who's playing downtown on 4/15. Lots of culture.

Charlottesville,2zv600,LisaBeezy,4,Sun Mar 22 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"Our dog loves the Chris Green Lake dog park. It's a large fenced-in wooded area with access to the lake for swimming. Not the big muddy square of grass you usually think of when you hear ""dog park""."
Charlottesville,2zv600,mayoroftuesday,2,Mon Mar 23 15:55:02 2015 UTC,I would say the Monticello farm trails. Lots of trails and open space and its not anything like a dog park. Its across from Piedmont va community college
Charlottesville,2zv600,LuciDaydream3r,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:27:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on your dog - size, athleticism, sociability. The Downtown Mall is great for going with a dog, but I second the comment that people will want to talk to/pet/hug your dog, so it's not a good place if you or your dog aren't cool with that. The dog park at Chris Greene is nice, as is the Rivanna Trail generally. (I find I'm mostly just agreeing with LisaBeezy.) I would add the Belvedere trails, which are technically also part of the Rivanna Trails, but not on the city-wide loop. If your dog likes swimming, Darden Towe is a good place for that, assuming you don't want to  drive out to Chris Greene - or you don't want to pay the admission fee in the summer months)."

Charlottesville,2zt1ag,leftyscoober,2,Sat Mar 21 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"I recently discovered that The Carving Board in Albemarle Square has them. It's not listed on the online menu, but in the restaurant, there are little signs up advertising their gyro. I thought it was pretty good - better than Mykonos, which I wasn't impressed with. I also really like Basil's, but the meat is in cubes, rather than souvlaki slices, so it's a little awkward for me to eat - meat tumbling out the whole time."

I've read a lot about the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and am hoping to get in touch someone local that's a member.  FYI, the Masons aren't a club though, neither are the Odd Fellows; they're both fraternal organizations.  The difference between a club and a fraternal order is a ritual.  When it comes to such rituals, some people may have their imagination influenced by pop culture and think there's some crazy stuff involved with their rituals.  There isn't.  It's as benign as the rituals to the opening of the Olympic Games, ceremonies for school graduations, arguably even a Pledge of Allegiance.

But the Virginia ABC officers are consistently under scrutiny for overreaching their bounds, excessive force, unnecessary prosecution (see Lockn' Festival, where even the Nelson County Sheriff publicly commented that the first festival was a great weekend overall, very minor problems, and wanted to see Lockn' back for many years to come, since it was quite a boon for the local economy. A certain ABC officer who is KNOWN for being a jackass took Lockn's organizers to task for....wait for it....MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION WITHIN THE GROUNDS OF THE FESTIVAL! The fucking HORROR....that some people at a 30,000+ MUSIC festival would smoke weed...he also tried to revoke the liquor license because he observed a woman sunbathing topless. The horror...the horror.)  Gotta justify that ever-increasing state budget, I suppose.

Charlottesville,2zj3js,Mythsterious,-1,Thu Mar 19 02:09:33 2015 UTC,"Since when is it illegal ""agitated and belligerent""? How can someone possibly be arrested for that?  Apparently I should have been in jail for most of my teen years..."
Charlottesville,2zj3js,emperor000,0,Thu Mar 19 02:47:56 2015 UTC,"He was clearly drunk and being drunk in public is illegal in a lot of jurisdictions. So that, alone, means he could justifiably be arrested.  That doesn't mean he deserves the head injury. But people making it sound like he wasn't doing anything illegal are out of touch."
Charlottesville,2zj3js,howmuchlongerdoihave,2,Thu Mar 19 02:57:12 2015 UTC,I have never in my entire life seen a drunk and belligerent UVA student walking down the corner at night.  So I am right there with you /u/emperor000.  It's a little disturbing that anyone would think a college campus would be a place where someone could just go and get drunk and walk around all agitated.  Especially a MINOR.  Blows my mind.
Charlottesville,2zj3js,emperor000,1 point,Thu Mar 19 03:28:45 2015 UTC,"The sarcasm is subtle, but detectable. I'll bite.  Fist, I'm not arguing that every drunk person walking on the downtown mall should be approached or taken into custody. I'm only saying that they could be.  Second, I do not believe he is a minor. For one thing, if he was then he would likely have other charges. His age has nothing to do with it except that, from what I can tell, the pub thought his ID was suspicious and assumed him to be younger (he does look pretty young) and the ABC might have acted on that and that is how things got started. But none of his charges have anything to do with his age (or his race)."

You may want to call the highway department or animal control of Albemarle County to find out more, I'm not sure who handles that in the area.

But if you don't mind paying a little more to live somewhere you might fit in better, then Charlottesville is your best bet.  Charlottesville is expensive for real estate. You could probably find an apt in the county for under $1000. But, anything near the city center or UVa is gonna be expensive. Not NoVa expensive, but more than you'd think for a city that size.  The plus side is Charlottesville is very diverse and open minded. And, even though I'm not a fan, it is a liberal hotbed. As for the valley, I'm white, so I've never had a problem there. But, I wouldn't be surprised to find people who might second guess you.  Culpeper could be a good option to. There are plenty of DC commuters who live there, but I don't know much about the culture. It does have a small town charm about it."

Charlottesville is the best spot in the region for ""culture"" but do yourself a favor and live closer to Elkton. Harrisonburg has to be a good town. JMU is there so there will be a young crowd and the amenities that come along with it (bars, activities, young people, etc.)   I'd shoot myself I'd I had to drive 33 twice over the mountains every day for work."
Charlottesville,2ymb79,lordgeezus,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:14:17 2015 UTC,Is the issue for you that it is a long commute or a stressful commute?
Charlottesville,2ymb79,FrozenHusky,2,Wed Mar 11 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"It's not long or stressful in the sense that a DC commute is long and stressful.  Route 33 is a country road meaning lots of curves, hills (and the Blue Ridge), deer, locals barely going the speed limit, etc.  It's not a road where you'll be able to do 60+ without thinking.  I'm the type of person who would rather drive more miles for a longer period of time than to be stuck in traffic and I'm happy to get off of 33.  It's fun occasionally in good weather, but watching the sharp curves and grades gets old fast and even faster in rainy/snowy weather."
Charlottesville,2ymb79,FrozenHusky,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:11:15 2015 UTC,I don't mind that. I am a safe driver. Is this a particularly dangerous road? What I mean is other than the fact that it goes through the mountains.
Charlottesville,2ymb79,lordgeezus,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's dangerous in that a lot of people get hurt on it.  More that you always have to be aware of your surroundings and some pretty tight curves (ie it goes through the mountains).  Combining that with the fact that deer are very plentiful (plus bears and other wildlife), it's a stressful drive.    In some ways, I think it's more stressful being constantly aware of your surroundings when you're doing 50-60 than stuck in the parking lots that DC highways are.  And I feel that this is what most of the other posters are cautioning you on."
Charlottesville,2ymb79,tnofuentes,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:26:56 2015 UTC,"One of the luxuries of not living in a metro area is you don't have to settle for a 60 minute commute to work. If you live in Cville after a couple weeks you'll know EVERY BLADE OF GRASS along 29 and 33 to and from work. I know folks who commute from Culpeper to DC every day and I'm astounded. That's easily 90 minutes each way on a good day. Some folks may find ways to justify it, but my time before and after work is valuable.   You'll have to decide if sacrificing 2 hours of personal time each day to sit in the car and drive is worth the differences between Cville and Harrisonburg. And I'll just leave this here, you're going to have to cross a mountain to go to Cville, you won't with Harrisonburg. Weather can make this tricky, especially with snow/ice which will be back come October/November."

Charlottesville,2ymb79,FrozenHusky,3,Wed Mar 11 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're going to regret having a long commute. Two extra hours of time for driving every day is a lot, and you might want the time back for yourself after a few of those commutes. The drive over the mountains on 33 from Charlottesville is also very stressful in anything but perfect weather.  I had a former roommate who did what you're thinking about; she moved in with me in Charlottesville and was paying about $1,300 per month to live in a condo (downtown, about 2,100 ft2). She loved Charlottesville but hated the commute, though she learned to live with it and eventually just listened to a lot of podcasts.  Harrisonburg's downtown is becoming more developed lately, so I would probably give that a shot if you wanted to save a little money and cut down on the commute. Breweries and restaurants have been opening up slowly, and it's a college town so people are more likely to be liberal-minded. Staunton is also great, but it might be a little too quiet for you if you want things to do after work.  I'd probably take a pass on Waynesboro. It's too sprawly for my taste and not laid out well."

I've personally never been bothered too much; but, I'm a 6' man. It makes my wife quite uncomfortable, she doesn't like to run there without me or the dog)"
Charlottesville,2y0p3b,MrBill1983,2,Thu Mar 5 19:17:29 2015 UTC,You can run pretty much anywhere around the city. The best place for 3 miles would probably be the Rivanna Trail that goes from Darden Towe Park to River View Park. You can park at either park.
Charlottesville,2y0p3b,MrBill1983,2,Thu Mar 12 12:08:00 2015 UTC,"UVa grounds is probably the place to do it. There's a lot of area that is walking-only, and before 9AM the paths are usually pretty clear. Charlottesville is a very runner-friendly town, and so you can go pretty much anywhere in town and you'll be fine. If you're only looking to run ~3 miles, then you can just pretty much run 1.5 miles in any direction and then runb ack and you'll be fine. (Parts of)UVa grounds is pretty and if you don't have another occasion to check them out, that's a good time."

Charlottesville,2xqmei,leroy020,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:25:16 2015 UTC,"Weird but I had a similar experience when I applied there 3 years ago. I came in to get a tb shot or something, I was not expecting to give a urine sample. They asked me if I could do the drug screen also, I said I wasn't expecting it and didn't really have to go right then. I asked to come back later or use the mail in kit that they had sent me but they said that once you are there they typically don't let you go without giving a sample. I couldn't go initially so they sent me back out to wait in the waiting room. I also chugged like 5-6 cups of water to the point where I must have dropped my core body temp as I was very cold after that. I also was able to provide a diluted sample, but thankfully that was the last I heard from them and I got the position. Maybe I'm lucky as a male and have higher urine creatinine at baseline so maybe it didn't trigger as a low result, who knows. Weird to read this as I had almost forgotten about all that but it seems like they're still at it! I'm sorry they didn't offer you the job, seems like they should offer to let you retake the test if that was the only offending part of your application. Also I agree with these other guys that it comes off as adversarial to have all the names and weird containers of urine everywhere in your post, a future hospital you apply to might see this as a red flag if they find it."

The position involved working with children. It makes sense that they would therefore be extra-strict about drug tests and such. They have a policy in place and they really need to follow it. It might seem like common sense to allow an exception due to the circumstances surrounding your experience, but in fact that would be very bad policy on their part. It's just not that simple for them. It would open them up to potential lawsuits as well as other potential criticism. For example, just imagine the headlines if they had passed on hiring someone else due to drug testing issues but decided to give you a ""second chance."" You can see how that could easily be misconstrued in the news. It would look even worse if the other applicant were a minority. Policies like this are in place for a reason, even though they sometimes ensnare innocent people. It's just how it is."

Anywhere in the interior it has issues, and even in the window I sometimes have to rotate it until the signal stops dropping out. Digital TV does not like indoor antennas very much. It can be very particular with the placement.   I have a computer-based tuner which helps a lot with placement because it reports not only signal strength (which will always be 9/10 or 10/10 because you're so close to the transmitter) but also the number of errors. Your TV probably only reports signal strength which isn't all that useful.  My advice is to get the antenna as close to a window facing Carter's Mountain as possible, and also plug in and turn on the amplifier if it has one."

Like I said, it's pretty random in that I haven't figured out any weather/seasonal pattern to the issue and it's rare that it causes viewing problems.  I do have more issues with ABC 16...usually have to move the antenna to a special spot just to pick it up.  My biggest irritation was the switch to digital, you have to have a near perfect reception to get anything unless analog where you'd just get some snow.  Annoys me to no end."

Charlottesville,2wx8jz,tclaus,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm down in Scottsville using a leaf antenna.  I get NBC29 rain or shine, and can usually pick up Fox and CBS as well.  I'm shit out of luck if I want to watch any PBS (which is the only station my neighbor across the street reliably gets) or anything else.  I know that's not helpful at all, I don't know what to tell you.  Gypsies?"
Charlottesville,2wx8jz,daveherring,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:54:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I'm just outside Charlottesville on the Scottsville side, and I get a great signal with a Mohu Leaf antenna. I liked the first one so much that I picked up one of their powered/amplified models, and found that the results were the same. I don't think the stations are far enough away to require the signal booster.   A friend in town near the UVA hospital complained to me about the poor reception he was getting with his cheap antenna and I suggested that he pick up a Leaf. He gets a great signal now, even in a basement apartment. It's important to note that antenna placement in your house is critical. If it doesn't work great on one wall, keep moving it around and checking the various stations."
Charlottesville,2wx8jz,Irish_Samurai,2,Wed Feb 25 17:28:23 2015 UTC,"Another good site to checkout is antennaweb.org.   Before I went back to cable, I was using a ChannelMaster mast antenna up in my attic (I believe it's an older version of the 4221). Worked well. They cost about $70 online. If you're handy, you can also build a DIY antenna (just Google ""DIY HD antenna"").  I've never used one, but I've heard great things about the ChannelMaster 7777 preamp. They cost about $70 online. I had an old Radio Shack amp that increased my signal by about 5-10%. If you use an amp, be sure to use as short a run of coax as you can between it and the antenna. Longer runs will cause more interference which will then be amplified by the amp.  Anything about about 80% signal strength should give you a solid picture. From 70-80% I would get occasional pixelation. Below 70% was unusable. I briefly tried one of those flat, amplified antennas in my living room, but even though I'm only 3 miles from Carter's Mountain, the signal on every channel except 29 was 60% or lower. The higher you can get your antenna, the better.  One of the problems here is that CBS/ABC/FOX are all owned by one company. As I recall, some FCC rule prohibits them from using more than one high-power transmitter, so two of the three networks are on low-power transmitters (I don't remember which ones). That may have changed, but I haven't used the antenna in over a year. So I can't say for sure."

Have they assaulted or robbed you, or do they just make you feel uncomfortable?   I live near the mall, and see panhandlers on a regular basis. Sometimes I give them money, sometimes I don't. Depends on the case, and how much money I have in my pocket. Regardless of whether you approve of panhandling or not, and regardless of whether they could be doing something else to make money, they are human beings.

Charlottesville,2wk69r,dan1101,2,Sat Feb 21 05:26:46 2015 UTC,"We don't have enough ""appropriate facilities"" for the mentally ill of this area.  The Salvation Army beds and PACEM beds (in the winter) fill up FAST and every night most of the people who want to get it are left out in the cold.  There's also the problem of people with substance problems (often due to attempting to self-medicate their mental illness) getting banned from these places due to having alcohol on their person (which is not allowed).  UVA only has 25 hospital beds, which are almost always full, and essentially require someone to be suicidal or near-death in some way to get admitted to.  Our state hospital is almost always full too (see reasons why that mental health reform law won't work for $100 Alex), and all the private hospitals in town have shut down years ago due to lack of funding and poor reimbursements from insurance companies in Virginia.    Many of the downtown beggars are homeless but aren't THAT seriously mentally ill (i.e. most of them aren't schizophrenic, but instead struggle with personality disorders and substance dependence).  Many of the other beggars (near Whole Foods), Barracks, aren't really ill at all, and some aren't even homeless.    We do need more housing options for the homeless, but more importantly, and better treatment for substance dependence (there's almost nothing in town).  Otherwise, it's not going to get better."

Charlottesville,2wk69r,soapsuds43,6,Fri Feb 20 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"Ever been to 16th street in Denver? Beggars flock there.  I'm not in agreement to say that panhandling is a form of speech, but an activity. If areas have permission to ban activities I.e. skateboarding which actively affects the environment of others - why can they not ban panhandlers?"
Charlottesville,2wk69r,jxf,2,Fri Feb 20 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, private businesses can (and frequently do) ban panhandlers. That's one part of what ""no solicitation"" signs prohibit. Owners of private property can prohibit many kinds of activities that would otherwise be legal in public.  The question is whether the government (not a private entity) can prohibit certain kinds of speech. Specifically, the ordinance that the City passed says that solicitation of certain kinds and in certain places is illegal, and it defines solicitation as:   Solicit means to request an immediate donation of money or other thing of value from another person, regardless of the solicitor’s purpose or intended use of the money or other thing of value. A solicitation may take the form of, without limitation, the spoken, written or printed word, or by other means of communication (for example: an outstretched hand, an extended cup or hat, etc.).   The Court said a lot of things in the opinion, but one of the biggest problems it highlights is that the City's law is not a very good law. How is a police officer trying to enforce the law supposed to tell if something is a ""thing of value""? If you give a panhandler a sandwich, is that a ""thing of value""? How about a cup of water? How about a business card for the Haven? How about a ride in your car to the shelter? It's really tough to police that.  A good analogy might be if someone was at an intersection with a ""Free Hugs"" sign. That's a form of solicitation, but everyone would probably be okay with that, and we probably don't want to prohibit that kind of speech. So why is that kind of solicitation okay but panhandling isn't?  The real answer mostly seems to be that cities want to prohibit panhandling because it makes people feel squeamish and uncomfortable to be confronted with the reality of how our current civilization is set up -- namely, that we're not very good at preventing homelessness and poverty. But the Constitution doesn't protect people who feel uncomfortable because of speech. In fact, it goes the other direction: speech which makes you uncomfortable is exactly the sort of speech that should be protected."

And even if they have the road open and the gross repairs finished, there was a LOT of damage, so I'm sure they'll be tweaking things for some time.  Given your location, it MAY not be related to this, but you never know."

Charlottesville,2wgiqv,tamaydo,2,Thu Feb 19 19:00:33 2015 UTC,I drive back and forth on 29 daily and never have any real issues with traffic by Rio that would justify a $100M+ interchange project. Is this project trying to plan for future traffic?
Charlottesville,2wgiqv,End3rWi99in,4,Fri Feb 20 06:05:04 2015 UTC,"My wife's father, who works for VDOT but not in the Cville area, so take this with a grain of salt, told me that Cville is the one of the only towns on 29 that does not have a bypass. When more research was done, it was determined the fastest way to get people from target to south of 64 is the interchange at Rio they are now building. For whatever reason, somebody wants a bypass around every city on 29, and having scrapped the plan for a bypass, they are doing this instead."
Charlottesville,2wgiqv,bc2zb,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"I take 29 from CVille down to NC frequently, and you're father-in-law is right: there are bypasses around almost every city (Lynchburg...grrrrr) and it is a beautiful thing.  Coming north and hitting the Fontaine area when the speed slows to 55, then 45, then that craziness at the Hydraulic intersection followed by everything until Target?  It absolutely sticks out on the otherwise speedy 29.  So yea, it sounds silly to ""want a bypass around every city"" just to collect them all or something, but it really is a boon when you're trying to get through central VA."
Charlottesville,2wgiqv,80-,2,Mon Mar 2 19:14:27 2015 UTC,Apparently they were trying to make 29 a real interstate highway or something similar at some point but the businesses complained that time too and it never happened. If only we did have a proper highway through central Virginia
Charlottesville,2wgiqv,bc2zb,2,Mon Mar 2 19:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think all the 29 improvements they have planned take aim at future growth and traffic along that corridor.  I agree, though, that the Rio interchange is not the worst problem we have.  They have tentative plans to tackle the real big problem areas like Hydraulic sometime in the future:  http://route29solutions.org/learn_more/7._hydraulic_road_intersection.asp.  So, I guess Rio is just the first step."
Charlottesville,2wgiqv,frontofficehotelier,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:44:00 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it will help any overall scheme of things.

For something that will pretty much destroy any business that isn't the mall/acac/kroger, and even those will take a hit.  And they're going to be widening 29 in the Forest lakes corridor. which means it will be bottlenecking down to 2 lanes for this ""expressway"". You know how stupid the Hydraulic intersection can be because it cuts down a couple lanes? Imagine that at 50 miles an hour. Yeah people are going to die. It is going to be awful."

Isn't that the problem they are trying to fix? 29 DOES bottleneck down to two lanes at forest lakes. I guess I realize construction is going to be generally awful, and that some small businesses by rio/29 will be hurt, but it still seems good to me in the long run."
Charlottesville,2wgiqv,brainchrist,2,Mon Feb 23 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"no I mean going other direction. Heading south, like traffic from DC and such which seems like what this is geared towards.

Charlottesville,2wgiqv,frontofficehotelier,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:31:34 2015 UTC,There are still 2 straight lanes on the top of the interchange at the light.  Not that there won't be accidents from people trying to merge to avoid the light still.
Charlottesville,2wgiqv,brainchrist,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"What accidents? I have lived a quarter mile away for about 20 years and the number seems low compared to hydraulic, or park street, or barracks, or trying to get into the rio hill Kroger..... There's a lot of things that could be done to fix the 29 traffic problem that have a higher probability of working that don't involve that intersection"

Charlottesville,2w8itf,Terkan,10,Mon Mar 2 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"Gander Mountain has hunting only.  Dicks actually has other stuff.  If it IS doing poorly, which I have no evidence to say it is, you can do the same to a new Dicks by simply not shopping at it. If you don't like the big box stores, don't shop there. If you want to prevent them, run for office. The question isn't why approve them.  The question is WHY NOT approve them? People shop there and make money, it makes the county taxes, it may generate a few dozen unskilled low wage jobs.  What more could they hope for with the land? Trees? Why let anyone build anything then.  Why not simply make the rest of the county into a State Park? It's simply development.  More people being born every day, gotta have some place to put them.  How long until there are so many people that you feel as though we'd need another Dicks?  10,000 100,000 1,000,000 people?"

Charlottesville,2w8itf,PerceivedShift,3,Thu Feb 19 03:53:09 2015 UTC,"OP here. it seems like, by the tone of your writing, that this community discussion or ""fuss"" has offended you. That was not my intention because 1) I don't know you and 2) this is reddit.   You ask ""why do I care"" if businesses put themselves out of business. I care bc this is my community and I am a part of it. I raise my family here, I drink the water here, I breathe the air here, I raise my family here, I patron businesses here, and I even walk in the Trees here.  So...no I don't want to see my community suffer, or water and air polluted, or property values drop, or people lose their jobs, called me old fashioned I guess.   Thank you for the quick lesson on how capitalism works and how private property works. Correct me if I'm wrong but because this is 'Merica and you can do whatever you want on your property without regard to your community and F anyone who says otherwise. To celebrate I'm burning some tires in my front yard right now!!! It's cold out you know.   I'm glad you brought up Kroger (because I never did), because they are a great example of businesses that are waaaaay busy, or the opposite of DSG.  When DSG is so busy I have to wait for one of their eight self check out lines to open up, I will no longer log on to a community forum and question a developers decision to build another one, ever, I swear.   Can you really get from barracks to rio hill Kroger in 5 minutes? There's a traffic camera on Rio you know, be careful!!!!!!!   It will probably be 4 minutes after dat interchange is built.   Ok ok, I give up, maybe we COULD use another Panera. Huge bagel shortage here but hey it's on I64 so fuck it lets try it. That will make 3 after the one going in at the UVA Battle Building. Have you seen those new Broth Bowls? I see why Moto Pho Co went out of business.   Any who, thanks. And man, I hope that new DSG has one of those sweet sweet golf simulators.   TL:DR; ignore dicks."
Charlottesville,2w8itf,insertamusingmoniker,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:24:02 2015 UTC,"Assumption #1, incorrect, I am not offended by people talking.  Assumption #2, you seem to say the community, air, water, and your family suffers... by Dick's being built and/or going out of business?  I am clearly missing the point you were trying to make. If it goes away maybe you'll get a store you want! I just don't see how a Dick's interferes with your family, air, water, or walking in the trees.  Not like you could walk in them before anyway, private property.  Which brings me to....  Statement #3.  Yes, if you want to burn trees in your front yard, that is your business, not mine.  And it is not my business when the police arrive to question the legality.  Statement #4.  I always have the same experience at Kroger.  never any lines open, just 1 person sitting at the self check-out.  So I will continue to question why you feel as though you have to question it.  Question #5, yes you can make it in 5 minutes, by following all of the laws, traffic cameras having nothing to do with it.  You just can't make it at 5PM.  All of the lights time down 29 perfectly at 45mph after 9PM at least with fewer other cars to get in the way and trigger cross lights.  I estimate the interchange cutting out about 2 minutes per light.    Statement #6, Bodos has much better bagels, except Panera's cinnamon candy coated crunch bagel.  That thing toasted with butter is a tasty nutritional nightmare.  Statement #7, I wish it was an REI instead of Dick's, so I'll have to hope for a slightly larger selection of camping gear.  Blue ridge has excessively expensive, decent stuff with a very verrrrry limited selection.  It is like they took their old store and just spread everything out further in the new space without capitalizing on the opportunity.  Dick's has an equally small selection of crap stuff for mediocre prices.  KMart actually had a large camping selection for dirt cheap prices for mediocre quality. I went into the Great Outdoor Provision Co and bought a hat at least, but I was so focused on getting a hat (they had over 80 different shapes/colors/kinds, I counted and got bored) I didn't actually inspect the rest of their stuff.  Still none of it compares to REI.  So last statement, I forget what number this is, I was distracted by hiking/biking/camping stuff.  Ignore Dick's, generally, yes.  Oh have you ever been in to Gander Mountain?  I had no idea what it was a few weeks after opening, I thought it was like Dick's.  Then I saw the WHOLE ENTIRE back wall was nothing but guns, lots and lots of guns.  Like hundreds of feet of guns.  I haven't ever needed to measure guns in feet before.  It is all hunting stuff, and all of the clothes were camo and/or orange.  I didn't see much use for the place and haven't been back since."
Charlottesville,2w8itf,jdeanseal,1 point,Fri Feb 20 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with 1) the quality of a cinnamon crunch bagel at PB, and 2) how REI would be better than DSG.   It too has confused me as to why BRMS moved to stonefield and just spread out their gear. I imagine that location offers better traffic exposure, but at the cost of less foot traffic. Surely less people casually walk by their front door anymore and go in to look around as they while shopping in barracks.   REI has amazing customer service and return policies, if they had ski and bike rentals that would be killer here.  They also host lots of classes and outings.   Never been in gander mountain, bc I don't hunt. Probably won't go in any other hunting stores they build. I think the valley has some well respected mom and pop gun shops that gets most of the over the mountain business.   Maybe I should have phrased my OP to ask ""what would people like to see next to Wegmans"""

As those areas become more dense, the cost of building a big box store will get bigger, so a lot of these commercial developers are trying to get in early.   Now, the county doesn't have complete veto power on who gets to move into a commercial development, really the developer has that power. What the county can do is establish code that blocks certain businesses (no giant sign = no Cracker Barrel) or they can block construction based on Architectural Review Board concerns. But even those are somewhat toothless."
Charlottesville,2w8itf,kyleg5,1 point,Wed Feb 18 11:56:03 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives a mile from where the new shopping center is being put in, it's because I don't shop in Charlottesville due to the inconvenience.  It's such a hassle getting out 29 that I don't bother.  I get groceries at the Kroger at Hydraulic to avoid college students at Barracks and I get everything else I want online.  Other than stopping at Kid to Kid for some clothes for my nephews on my way out of town for the holidays, all my holiday shopping was online.  Plenty of my neighbors do the same thing.  That's a lot of lot revenue.  With a good shopping center close by, I'll go there instead."

The rio interchange should help tremendously is the long run though.   I'm very excited for Wegmans.  I imagine it will be the go to for keswick/glenmore crowd as well.

I woke up one Friday morning about a decade ago with mind blowing tooth pain. I didn't have a dentist so I started calling around. No one would see me on short notice. Then I got to Dr. Hodges' office. He picks up himself and I tell him my story. You see, I had a date. Not just any date, either. This was a date with Melody. I couldn't miss it, and I couldn't show up groaning in pain. Dr. Hodges listened, told me to come on in.  When I got there it was just him. He plans a day off for his staff once a month to catch up on paperwork, he tells me. He pokes around and tells me I have a Wisdom tooth coming through, which is causing intense pressure and the pain. He offers to cut a window in my gum to relieve the pressure and a prescription for some pain pills.   As I'm leaving I ask how much I owe him, he waves me off and says, ""Come back Monday and we'll get the paperwork taken care of.""  The date went great and I've been going there ever since! My wife and kids all go to him, too. I've gladly recommended him to many people and anyone that's gone has been satisfied!   Good luck in your search, if you end up seeing him, let him know Jason I says 'Hi.'"

Charlottesville,2vkng6,tnofuentes,1 point,Thu Feb 12 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"This review is so well written it makes me skeptical. You aren't indirectly trying to participate in his referral program, are you?   What I am looking for in a dentist is compassion and comfort and not someone who's anxious to diagnose and drill... I'm not sure if this is my guy or not based on what I can read about him even though it sounds like your case turned out great with your wisdom teeth."
Charlottesville,2vkng6,tnofuentes,3,Wed Feb 11 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"I would gladly offer the referral bonus to you, he really is just that awesome. As a more recent example, I can offer you this:  I spent a few years in Philly and went to a boutique dentist, briefly. He immediately diagnosed me with teeth grinding and suggested a root canal for one painless tooth and an expensive bite guard, and an Invisalign package to straighten some front teeth. Upset with the upsell, I went to Penn Dentistry. There I was offered the same bite guard, and some enamel replacement plan that was also pricey. Came back to Cville, went to Dr. Hodges, he told me I'm brushing too hard and we could follow up in six months with softer brushing. Just had that visit, and he says I'm all clear now. Suggested a bite guard for some TMJ, then looked at my x-rays and said I had no TMJ damage to my joint, so I could probably delay but he'd be glad to order me one to help with pain if it bothers me.   He really just is that good of a guy, that's why I gave him a glowing review."
Charlottesville,2vkng6,nick_pizzle,1 point,Thu Feb 12 00:54:59 2015 UTC,Gonna second this comment - Jeff Hodges is as good as they get in Charlottesville. Don't think twice about this - go to Dr. Hodges.

Charlottesville,2vkng6,mypages,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:30:15 2015 UTC,"I've had great experiences with Kayton, but he doesn't ""participate"" with any dental insurances.  So you may end up paying a little more out of pocket since 99% of the time your insurance won't foot the whole bill."
Charlottesville,2vkng6,fsacb3,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for pointing that out. To be honest I'm more focused on quality than cost at this point.  Would you rate him as being pretty compassionate and conservative? I don't see sedation info on his site, I assume nitrous is an option? Anything else to make patients more comfortable?  I'm really really really bad at the dentist, with drills and the metal pokers and prodding... the whole thing screws me up.  I just tried calling but they closed at 4 today. It feels good to be tackling this but I really want to make sure I have the right doctor for me.  Dr. Viglione, the other dentist I was considering, his exam fees are on the high side. But then, you seem to get a very high level of comfort for the extra money from what I read. Comfort is sort of a priority but if Dr. Kayton is cheaper and has at least comparable comfort I may go with him.  Any more suggestions from anyone else are definitely welcome."

If given the choice for a few dollars more I would recommend that over unlimited IHOP since you can get unlimited pancakes at Wood Grill anyway, but also pastries and cereal, meats and fruits and heck salad if you want it.

Charlottesville,2u3xti,aurelieclaire,6,Thu Jan 29 18:56:46 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is why anyone would go straight through the intersection? Looks like they've got two straight lanes there, but unless you're turning into one of the businesses right there at the light, you'd be better off going under instead.  Which of course means that people who are turning right soon after will be tempted to stay in the left lanes and then swoop into the right-hand lane immediately after they join back up.   Which in turn will just anger other drivers. C'villians already have a tendency to block people from moving over into their lane, and this will only give the lane-blockers moral justification to keep on doing it."
Charlottesville,2u3xti,dcheesi,4,Thu Jan 29 23:03:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, I get what they are trying to do, strait through traffic will not need to stop at the light, but to me this seems like a reaaaallly expensive band-aid which will likely not be very effective and will generate a lot of confusion, especially for cville visitors."
Charlottesville,2u3xti,PerceivedShift,2,Thu Jan 29 23:38:24 2015 UTC,"One of the newspapers published an article about this awhile ago. The three options were retime the lights, build the bypass, or build this overpass. From a commuter perspective, the overpass is the fastest way to keep traffic moving. Though why they think this is necessary escapes me."
Charlottesville,2u3xti,bc2zb,2,Sat Jan 31 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"That's what I want to know!   My only thought is say you are turning out of goodwill trying to go south, you can't get all the way over to go under the intersection so they have to wait at the light to go south."
Charlottesville,2u3xti,ewilliam,2,Fri Jan 30 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"Also, no way to get into goodwill/29 storage if you're traveling northbound. So I guess everyone will have to go down to the light at Lowes and pull a u-turn."

But there's still a decent amount of stuff there and there is only 1 straight only lane, and one lane that is turn right in addition.  I guess they figure a decent amount of people want to go to that shopping center?"
Charlottesville,2u3xti,cornshake,2,Sun Feb 1 23:18:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, so they're planning to get rid of the light at Albemarle square?  Now I see why ACAC is so upset about it.  As cool as this looks, I can't help but remember the 20 other lights on either side.  Maybe in a few hundred years from now, when each light has its own $100m underpass, this will be almost as good as a bypass.  Leave it to Charlottesville to reinvent the wheel (poorly)."

Charlottesville,2u3xti,Terkan,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:41:14 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about?  This isn't making it an expansion, this is simply letting you drive straight through and SKIP the bland centers.  You will probably save 90 second by not having to wait for this traffic light anymore."
Charlottesville,2u3xti,Mythsterious,2,Sun Feb 1 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"This is going to let more cars onto 29.  More cars means more people, and that means more development.  Target and the other nameless retail behemoths on 29 have been creeping towards Ruckersville for years now.  This will just make it happen even faster and before you know it you'll be able to drive from here to Culpeper and see nothing but 'Dicks Sporting Goods' and 'Bed Bath, and Beyond' where there used to be houses and trees."
Charlottesville,2u3xti,Terkan,-1,Mon Feb 2 03:36:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a convincing argument.  What a shame people have been thinking like you in the Americans since around the year.... 1600. The thing about development is that people are constantly making more people.  Perhaps instead of complaining about roads allowing more people in, you should start getting people to stop making more people. Oh, and if you don't like seeing specific stores, how about you arrange a boycott?  Good luck finding people for that. And if you are complaining about land being bought up that used to be houses and trees, how about you form your own Foundation and buy up that land for yourself and keep it... ""Pristine"" You can do all of those things, yes, but sadly look at the country.  If you don't like the way of development, I'm sorry to say you're on the losing end 100% of the time.  There are more people and they need places to live and jobs to help them buy crap.  These people will need roads to get them places which will only lead more people to move in faster leading to a need for more roads, and more people will come in!  Get used to it now, because there are going to be more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more and--  Or I have another solution.  How about you move somewhere where there are no roads, and no people, because people will want roads.  I would say Antarctica, but they have roads down there getting bigger all the time. I guess you qualify for Mars, but there are already a few vehicles there too. I think the easiest thing for you is to realize that your idealized world is not reality and to move on with life."

Albemarle HS is the biggest (and best-but I'm an alum, GO PATRIOTS so I'm biased).  Western Albemarle has the reputation of being the nicer, ""Country Club"" HS, and Monticello HS is a nice mix of everything.

The pork belly was delicious and it was definitely a respectable amount of meat. The Thai salmon was also good. I'm a seafood snob so I won't say it was great, but definitely excellent with respect to the seafood options in this area. A friend who went with us said that the papardelle was definitely the winner among the three entrees we chose. The beer pairings went well with the courses.

My take away from there has always been it attracts a lot of Cops for lunch.  Cops know food :) Also, You forgot Riverside!

Charlottesville,2syza3,Geek2009,4,Mon Jan 19 20:24:40 2015 UTC,How does one become an Uber driver in Cville?
Charlottesville,2syza3,_RE_TARDIS,7,Mon Jan 19 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"Uber has very few requirements to drive.   Own a vehicle with 4 doors. The vehicle must be 2005 or newer. Valid car insurance, registration, and safety inspection. Must be able to pass a background check."
Charlottesville,2syza3,ericrz,5,Mon Jan 19 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"Do you (or any local Uber drivers) work early AM (like 5-6AM), to serve those crazy early flights from CHO?  Seems like I can't ever find an Uber driver on those mornings."
Charlottesville,2syza3,minimey,5,Mon Jan 19 22:11:41 2015 UTC,"I don't. One of the major upsides/downsides of Uber is that we get to drive whenever we want to. The upside is that I set my hours. The downside is that a driver may not always be working. Also, Uber doesn't tell us when drivers are/are not driving. I genuinely enjoy my job and want to help people out and get them from A to B. All of this being said, Uber is getting better. They are still a newer company and they are learning. As Uber expands in the C'Ville area, I would expect to see more drivers around providing 24/7 coverage."
Charlottesville,2syza3,ElroyZipper,4,Mon Jan 19 22:23:48 2015 UTC,My friends and I had an Uber driver take us only a few blocks pretty late at night. He told us that they pay you a bit extra if you make yourself available during those hours where there might be higher demand but fewer available drivers.
Charlottesville,2syza3,Collegep,2,Tue Jan 20 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"That's correct. It's called surge pricing and is based solely on demand for Uber. There was a Florida Georgia Line concert at JPJ on Saturday night and the surge went past 5x. Essentially, riders were paying 5 times the normal fare to use Uber. Although that may sound like a lot, the Uber service is well above and beyond the typical cab service."
Charlottesville,2syza3,Collegep,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"Does that increase in pricing, the surge charge, go to you? Hopefully?"
Charlottesville,2syza3,appleapple123123,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Uber takes 20% off the top. The overall fare is higher on surge, so Uber gets to take more too."
Charlottesville,2syza3,lordgeezus,3,Fri Jan 23 22:37:48 2015 UTC,Do you make enough to significantly off-set additional maintenance (if there is any) on your vehicle due to increased milage as a result of your being an Uber driver?
Charlottesville,2syza3,PerceivedShift,2,Mon Jan 19 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it depends. I am in the process of figuring out what when the most beneficial times to drive are. If there is only one other driver, I may drive during the middle of the day. If there is more than one, I will typically lookout for surge pricing and drive then. If I can't pull more than 4 fares in an hour without a surge, I will typically lose or make very little money in the end."

Charlottesville,2sw6zh,Charlottesvillebound,4,Mon Jan 19 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"I came from baltimore so I have a good estimation of how you'd be. Charlottesville is actually a big town, not a small one.  There's actually a huge difference in terms of the important things, quantity and quality of or retail and dining options. Besides the charming nature of the town, and the charming buildings, you will find that the population tends to be youthful and fit and healthy and particularly gorgeous.  At your age you'd probably find not only undergrads but grad and med students, and perhaps a local or two. Assuming you like drinking that is, because it seems almost everything in this town revolves around alcohol. If you like drinking, this is the town for you. Other than that, I find it best to avoid anything that involves UVA because I don't like dealing with students.  But like I said, at your age you might relate a lot better and enjoy the social interactions with those kiddos. Traffic is not an issue anywhere really.  You'll find silly drivers and they tend to err on the side of more cautious than your typical city stressful drivers."

Lots of hiking and outdoor activities available. There's always something happening just in a smaller scale: concerts, festivals, etc. Plenty of bars (both near UVA/undergrads and the Downtown Mall with young professionals).

Merging as early as possible and not cutting is less efficient, but it is seen as more polite. And then people act the hero by  sitting in between the lanes, imagining all their fellow motorists cheering them on, defending them from the evil line cutters, and it's just a huge mess."

Charlottesville,2sj4fw,ewilliam,2,Thu Jan 15 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is true - which is why we need for VDOT to change their approach and signage like Minnesota and other states. MNDOT has engaged in a public education campaign to inform and explain to people what the zipper method is, how it works, and why it's better. We should have the same thing here.   All I see when I look at OP's picture is a bunch of wasted roadway that could be used up to to the pinch point...but people like OP seem to take it as a ""douche move"" when someone ""cuts in line"". The public perception needs to change...until then, the zipper merge cannot work."
Charlottesville,2sj4fw,ewilliam,0,Thu Jan 15 20:21:59 2015 UTC,Take a ride over 250 and you'll see they do in fact have a zipper merge.

Charlottesville,2sj4fw,VoteThemAllOut,-3,Fri Jan 16 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"Where are you talking about exactly?  I live just off Park, and work on Ivy, so I go this route daily. They have been closing down the left lane eastbound every day during the day, and it's routinely backed up past the fire station, with the left lane empty (as seen in OP's pic). It's ridiculous. I went up to the front a few weeks back, and a few people got super road-ragey about it. Hey, guess what, guys, you can do it too. After I went by, some jerkoff ""vigilante"" trucker moved into the middle to prevent anyone else from going by. People are dumb."

Fortunately posts like this now get voted to the top.  Still, sure would be nice to see a brief special on this appear on the major nightly news programs to help increase awareness."
Charlottesville,2sj4fw,captain_reddit_,10,Fri Jan 16 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"except it's actually supposed to work better if you dont just line up and wait, but to merge at the lane reduction spot.  http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2014/05/the-zipper-merge-convincing-motorists-isnt-a-snap.html  Studies by the Texas Transportation Institute, Minnesota Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration have shown that the zipper merge (thus named because both lanes are used and drivers take turns merging one car at a time, like the teeth of a zipper) improves traffic flow by as much as 15 percent, according to the Detroit News. MnDOT also found it reduces the total length of a backup by as much as 50 percent, and commonly by 40 percent.  ""Although motorists seem to believe that a single lane of traffic flowing into a work zone should flow through unrestricted and much faster without a slowdown for merging traffic, this just does not happen in the real world of traffic hazards,"" MnDOT says. ""Motorists slow down because of the uncertainty of the drivers' actions ahead, poor visibility beyond, signs/drums/barricades and (other obstructions). That slows down the rest of the line of traffic, and the longer the queue, the more it slows down and a longer time before it regains speed.""  Instead, states that ask motorists to use the zipper method want all available roadway used up to the merge point. The zipper is not intended to be used when traffic is flowing briskly, with ample distance between vehicles to move over earlier without causing a slowdown. But when traffic is slow moving, using both lanes and taking turns one car at a time from each lane has proved effective. MnDOT says by creating two full lanes of traffic, the speed difference between the lanes is reduced. When everyone is equally ""disadvantaged,"" incidents of road rage and other bad behavior — like playing ""lane cop"" and driving in the center to prevent passing — are fewer. Signs instructing motorists to use both lanes up to the merge point help take the pressure off people who fear scorn or retribution.  The problem is, the concept pretty much goes against everything we've learned about driving etiquette, which traditionally tells us to get into the continuing lane ASAP. Compounding that is a lack of consistency among states. While states like Minnesota, Illinois, Colorado, Washington and Pennsylvania use, or have used, the zipper merge, California, for example, does not."

I was paying close to $90 for Comcast's 25Mbps package which was just too much and I wasn't ever really seeing really fast download speeds anyway.   Neither are great, but CL is less expensive and DSL is dedicated which is a plus if you are moving into a dense area."

They charge me 70/month for 25mbps. Besides it dropping once or twice a week for a few minutes (yes I consider that awful.  Internet should be like the electric company, once or twice per week for a few minutes is unacceptable), they also installed when I first moved into this place, and I got awful miserable 2mbps service 6 months later for a few months until I had enough and asked them what the hell.  Turns out the Comcast said the equipment the Comcast guys used to install was labelled as ""stolen"" months later.  How they could confuse Installed with stolen, I have no idea.  But it took many hours to figure this out.  Which is another thing.  If you need to call comcast for anything, expect it to take 60 to 90 minutes, and they will attempt to sell you so much more junk claiming it to be good deals. Watch out for contracts that will screw you, or rentals that will screw you, or promotional rates that will screw you.  Fuck Comcast, it is one of the worst companies in the world for a reason.  Century Link isn't a viable alternative for my high-bandwidth lifestyle either. I would love Blue Ridge, but they haven't quite installed out to here yet. Fuck Comcast."

Just recently (a month or two ago) they sent around a lot of mailers about increased speed tiers they are offering.  It will depend on what area you're in, but I'm on 40mbps with them now for $35/month.  For the cost (and hassle) savings, I don't miss the extra speed I had with Comcast.

Honestly I feel the business internet packages are really fairly priced with what you get (start ~$70/mo).  In most areas a business account has a 4-6 hour window for repair regardless of time of day so internet breaks at 5pm, you're running by 11 that same night.  Business services get a whole different support structure from residential customers as well.  Usually different call center people, different techs, etc.  This really comes down to probably being 2 things, bad modem or bad RF signal (more likely) into your modem.  You can try moving the modem to another cable outlet in your house and seeing if it can lock on there but from the information provided, it sounds like you might need a tech.  Also remove any splitters you have in front of your modem if possible, each splitter drops your RF levels."

I'm afraid of not being competitive because I'm not a crazy overachiever that is the president of every club on campus and yada yada."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,daveherring,7,Tue Jan 6 01:37:54 2015 UTC,"No, they are not. I did grades 2-11 in the city school system and always had great teachers and am still friends with many intelligent people (if any of you are reading, keep your mouths shut or you'll ruin it) who came through along with me.  I used to do the after school programs at Buford in the Carver Rec center as well, always had a good time.  11th grade was back in 2003, so things may have changed a bit but I'd be hard pressed to believe that they've fallen far.  All that being said, I was a kid who was put in the Quest program in elementary school tracked for honors and AP courses starting in 5th grade.  Is tracking a problem that creates different environments for different students within the same school? Yes.  Would that problem be the same at pretty much every other school in the area? Yes.  All-in-all though, the extracurricular, athletics and after school programs drew from the entire student body and always had the same supportive, structured environment (as best you could hope for from say, a middle school band class) that I got in the tracked classes.  Middle school and high school can always be miserable and I know I was no different, but in retrospect I would have to say that I wholly enjoyed my time in the city schools. +1 for what u/the5thLight says about Cherry Ave.  Folks can have a hard time letting go of a place's reputation.  It might have passed for a rough neighborhood 20+ years ago, but there really is not a ""bad part of town"" in Charlottesville.  Crime rates across the city are very low, you still have a good deal of racial/socioeconomic segregation by neighborhood as you would find in pretty much any other southern city.  But anyone who thinks that 5th and Dice is still a rough neighborhood needs to take a long walk through Baltimore, Hartford, Memphis, etc. (steps off soap box) There are lots of nice communities in the surrounding area that can be much cheaper than Charlottesville.  My wife and I moved to Scottsville a few years back because we were tired of paying out the nose for a 2BR in Belmont that only had a wood stove for heat and a landlord who let her ex BF live in the shed out back.  Things are good and cheap down here, the drive up rt 20 only takes 20-25 minutes to get you into downtown (and you pass PVCC on the way) and with all the work they've done on 20 in the past 5-10 years it's not nearly as bad of a road as it used to be.  You could also look around North Garden, just south of town on US-29.  There's not really a grocery store in that area, but it's an easy 10 minute drive to UVA and Barracks Rd where you could find everything you need.  And of course, Crozet is an easy commute from the western side of the county, though it's much more popular than, say, Scottsville (but we've got better fireworks!) and therefore a bit more expensive. I don't know about outdoor lessons, but Rocky Top Gym has lots of indoor walls and would probably be able to put you in touch with anyone who does outdoor lessons. Food Lion, probably. PVCC and UVa have very solid connections.  Like u/the5thLight said, some of it will depend on your program. But no matter what, the administration at both schools will be very familiar with what you're trying to do and should be able to provide good advice to get you there. In all honesty, $750 could be tough to find in C-ville.  I'm sure that there are places out there, but it's all about inventory.  Rent in Charlottesville is rising rapidly in some places and so those places that are still cheap will be getting snapped up faster and faster.  Try using something like [Padmapper](www.padmapper.com) that will aggregate  listings from several sources and let you search them all by price.   That's a lot more than I set out to write, hope it's all somewhat comprehensible.  Best of luck!"
Charlottesville,2rfct6,docsuess,2,Mon Jan 5 20:28:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for all of the help! I have scoured all the rental sites but somehow never came across padmapper! That's great! Thanks for that! :D   The cost of housing in Charlottesville is something that I am really having a hard time wrapping my head around because where I live now, $750 could get you a house. I am a bluegrass-loving mountain girl at heart, so living a bit farther out and hopefully in a wooded area would be A-OK with me. Gas and utilities are much cheaper there than they are here, so perhaps it all comes out in the wash in the end, though. (Utility bill for my 1-bedroom apt with no heat and only a window a/c unit was $120/mo... insanity)."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,mtnbkr531,2,Tue Jan 6 01:57:29 2015 UTC,"No problem, that website has helped me out a lot in the past - gotta pay it forward.  The other thing to consider is that a lot of the rental properties in Charlottesville are student housing (college town and all), so a lot of inventory is currently occupied.  I think you said you weren't moving for a while, so you may see a lot more stuff come up in a few more months once the school year starts to wind down and those rentals all start coming back on the market."

Any students here who could verify?"

Charlottesville,2rfct6,Cvilledog,4,Wed Jan 7 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"As far as PVCC to UVA, I was under the impression that if you have a 3.0 GPA in your first 2 years at PVCC, you can automatically transfer to UVA or other state schools (JMU, VCU). Not sure if this is still the case, but a relative of mine did this a few years ago.   I suggest living in the Belmont area (zip code 22902) if you're in school - it's far enough away from the UVA scene but is still close to the downtown mall and has a nice neighborhood feel. A bunch of the houses have been split into duplexes/different apartments so you'll be able to find something that fits your needs.   Welcome! Hope you enjoy your time here."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,Cvilledog,2,Mon Jan 5 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"Instead of living all the way over in Belmont, I would suggest the JPA area. There are two residential off-grounds areas that draw UVA students. One is known as the Corner or Rugby. This area generally goes from Grady Ave to University Ave and from Rugby Ave to 10th St if you include Wertland. This area is a place to avoid if you want a cheap, safe, and calm place to stay and raise your child. However, the other area is along JPA or Jefferson Park Ave. It is much calmer, safer, and cheaper but you still live around young people where you can make connections within UVA. JPA has a third of the crime rate of the Corner.   City elementary schools aren't bad but I would be wary of the middle and high school. That's where the kids tend to get violent. They rioted in the high school a few years ago. Nothing crazy but it was still a riot.  If you get into UVA, there is rock climbing stuff for students including walls, climbing gear, and clubs. Before UVA, I would recommend Rocky Top.  Yes, go to Kroger.  I have no clue about day care.  Source: I'm a local who now goes to UVA"

Charlottesville,2rfct6,FrozenHusky,2,Tue Jan 6 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"By the time I graduate from PVCC, if I get all A's, as I have continued to do except my one giant kegstand of a semester when I was 18, I'll have a 3.86 and I'm in honors. I have been over on the college confidential boards though and they are all like, ""MY GPA IS ONLY A 4.95 AND I ONLY HAVE 8 EXTRACURRICULARS.... DO I HAVE ANY SHOT OF GETTING INTO UVA??!?!?!?!?!!?"" It's kind of crazy.  What I'm gathering in this thread is that if I live in Albemarle County, I should look for a place kind of south/south-east-ish of the center of town.  I am not high maintenance by any means so as long as there's no gun shot holes in the windows or a leaky roof or the front door falling off the hinges, I'm pretty cool with whatever is affordable, for now. Another question I had was, when is the best time to rent? I will be renting in May or June so I don't really have a choice but I'm wondering if my options will be terrible, great or in-between. I lived in Gainesville, where UF is, and so there were renting ""seasons"" when everyone was renting at the same time, and after that there was literally NOTHING available."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,FrozenHusky,1 point,Tue Jan 6 01:48:47 2015 UTC,"If you're seeing things on ""college confidential"" asking about UVA admission, it's coming from kids still in high school. As you will be coming from PVCC, your situation is entirely different and I would definitely suggest talking with one of the people at PVCC who works on the transfers. It sounds like you are in a good situation to be able to transfer successfully, but it depends on the program."

Charlottesville,2rfct6,zxo0oxz,3,Wed Jan 7 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"I lived in Cville on a very limited graduate student salary for the majority of 7 years, so I can answer a few questions.    3).  Cherry Ave isn't that bad, past the hospital (10th street and above), the side streets definitely have good housing options that are affordable.  My best friend lived in a 4 bedroom newly renovated duplex for about $850 a month, so it's not unheard of.  It was really safe, and semi close to UVA.  Also, UVA areas are louder, so yeah, avoid that if that's not your thing.  As of rental companies, MSC is good and there are a few smaller, private rental companies or private owners.  Do avoid the New House Company. Their properties are garbage, their service mediocre and they will do whatever they can to keep your deposit.  They're scum.    4). The surrounding areas are not bad, commutes aren't bad either but parking is a problem depending on where you work. Sometimes you have to walk a ton. I lived up 29N near Rio Rd for a year, rent was cheaper but the 5 mile commute would take me 15-20 minutes on a good day, and often I had to do the trip 2-3 times per day and I ended up spending more on gas than what I saved on rent.  You can find cheaper stuff off Rio Rd and Hydraulic Rd and the surrounding areas but make sure you figure out parking first if you need to go anywhere near downtown or the university area.    5).  Most practices are pretty small, I think. I was an interpreter for one local lawyer, and he used to hire a few paralegal assistants every once in a while.    6).  No idea about rock climbing, but ask at UVA Oudoors, give them a call.  As for swimming holes, I forget the name but there is one down Ivy Rd (I think it is called Blue Hollow).  7).  Kroger has a very decent selection now, they seemed to have revamped the stores since I first got there.  The cheapest I think is still Food Lion off 5th extended. Depends what you need, really.    9).  See #3."

Charlottesville,2rfct6,hotspots_thanks,3,Thu Jan 8 13:40:12 2015 UTC,"I can't answer all of your questions, but I'll take a shot at some.    C'ville schools are great (with the caveat that there are differences at the elementary level). They have a strong arts program and high academic standards. (I have a child in middle school who has been in the city schools the whole time.) There are separate elementary schools, then the kids come together for upper elementary, middle, and high school.  You can find cheaper housing outside town - parts of Albemarle Co., Waynesboro, Scottsville, etc. You will also find differences in schools. The commute isn't terrible if you're from Atlanta, but your standards may change once you're here. (I avoid all commutes, if I can.)  There is a large legal marketplace. C'ville seems to have more lawyers than the local economy can account for. There are social groups for young professionals, etc. Unfortunately, I can't point you to any myself, but you should be able to find some online. UVA Outdoor Rec may do lessons. There is a local gym, Rocky Top. It's a far cry from pro gyms in big cities, though. There is outdoor climbing on the Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline Drive, but maybe less than you might think. We're pretty close to good climbing in WV and NC. (I'm a former rock climbing instructor and gym rat.)  Kroger is ok, as is Food Lion. Grocery shopping in C'ville is pretty diversified. It includes several Asian markets, a couple of Indian shops, an Afghan market, and a dozen or so Latino stores, in addition to big chains (Harris Teeter, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Fresh Market, CostPlus World Market, and Wegmans - coming soon). For local options, check out Integral Yoga (organic, run by a local Yoga concern, bulk foods but sometimes pricy on fancy stuff), Foods of All Nations (fairly upscale international selection as well as local produce and products), and Reid's Super Save Market, a local grocery folks like for cheap food and good meat."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,hotspots_thanks,1 point,Mon Jan 5 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've heard there's a big ""foodie culture"" in Cville which I am pretty excited about.

I'm pretty happy to hear about the legal marketplace. I don't see a huge number of paralegal postings on Craigslist or any of the other job websites so it was making me wonder. I guess I'll just have to do the good-old networking thing.  Thanks!! :)"
Charlottesville,2rfct6,IlikeCondors,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"I have lived in major cities and college towns. C'ville has much better food that a town of its size deserves. That said, the Mexican restaurants are pretty generic, but we have Latino stores where you can buy ingredients and imported products. I would suggest La Guadalupana, El Tepeyac, and Tienda ""El Tio."" Renowned Chef Melissa Close-Hart is opening a new Southwest/Mexican restaurant in Belmont sometime in the spring, which I'm looking forward to.  What's your experience as a paralegal? You might try contacting the Charlottesville Albemarle Bar Association (CABAonline.org). I don't know, but they might be willing to send out a group e-mail announcing your arrival. That's also a good source of contact information if you want to try sending out resumes."

Charlottesville,2rfct6,Terkan,2,Wed Jan 7 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"A couple do have small kitchens. We also have a decent set of taco trucks and La Michoacana restaurant does good tacos (http://www.c-ville.com/super-taco-newly-renovated-la-michoacana-still-relies-on-home-cooking-for-its-charm/). If you're a fan of tacos al pastor with the meat rotating on a spit and a slice of pineapple on the top, though, you'll have to settle for meat cooked on the flat top. The Virginia Dept. of Health doesn't permit cooking meat on the spit. Al Carbon is also good - they have a coal-fired rotisserie imported from Peru, as is El Tepeyac (the restaurant), which trends more Salvadorean with pupusas."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,bailey757,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"Pupusas! Holy camoley, I haven't had those in years. It sounds like Cville is better outfitted with Central American food than Florida is."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,ericrz,2,Wed Jan 7 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"I can't answer all your questions but I will say, both of my sisters live in Waynesboro and commute to UVA for work everyday. You do have to go ""over the mountain"" which can be iffy on some days (fog, snow, etc.) but it is SUBSTANTIALLY cheaper. I just looked real quick on trulia rentals in Charlottesville v. Waynesboro and you would just have a lot more options in Waynesboro. They really like it over there too. Albemarle Co. is just insanely expensive, even if you look towards Crozet (which there aren't many rentals). This is probably not helpful but just an FYI, maybe?   And I will say (thus completely negating my previous info) Albemarle County schools are amazing. I don't know how much ""worse"" the city schools are but an ACPS education is pretty much guaranteed to be a good one."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,ericrz,1 point,Mon Jan 5 19:35:00 2015 UTC,"No, it is quite helpful! What is the commute like, time-wise? I usually do about 5-7 over the speed limit on the highway so the google maps time is not always accurate for me. My cousin says that there are always like five-car pileups on the mountain in the winter. Does the monthly cost of gas negate the rent savings?  I would like for him to go to an Albemarle County school, but we might just have to grin and bear it for a year or so while I'm getting adjusted. This moving process is not an easy one. It's actually a little hellish. I just don't want, you know, a preschool gang jumping my little boy with a pair of safety scissors."
Charlottesville,2rfct6,emperor000,2,Tue Jan 6 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Here's a couple I can answer quickly:  2) I don't have children, but as a graduate student in the engineering school, I know professors who have sent their kids to Cville schools their entire academic career.  I know few people more concerned with education than PhD-holding professors.    4) It depends on where you're commuting to/from.  Anyplace from the north that requires traveling on 29 is not the best idea since traffic on 29 is not fun.  Crozet isn't bad, to the south isn't bad.  I actually live in a nice 2 bd, 1.5 bath townhouse just south of I-64 (technically in the county, not city) with easy access to downtown, I-64, etc and pay $850/month.  That's pretty doable.  6) Try these groups: http://www.outdoorsatuva.org/ It's student-run but community members can join as well.  They do all sorts of outdoors stuff including rock climbing (both teaching and trips as I recall)  I was going to link you to www.outdoorcharlottesville.com but the site is down for me.  It is/was a creation of UVA grads...basically doing what the student group does but not student-run.  They did a re-org a couple years ago and I'm not sure what's up now.  7) Kroger and Giant are probably the cheapest.  Harris Teeter is a bit nicer than Kroger but more expensive.  Then we have Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, great food and selection but too pricey for me.  9) $750 is pushing it if you want to stay close to Charlotteville.  It's doable, but, I'd say, hard to find.  Again, I have a 2bd/1.5bath townhouse near the county police/admin building for $850.  Things tend to get cheaper if you move further out...Crozet might be a good option but it is more of a drive."

I was up there for thanksgiving and they are doing just the craziest construction on a pretty big road. There were like two levels of traffic and right in the middle was a ton of construction, and traffic was at a near standstill in the middle of the day. Of course, it was also the holidays when more people were probably out of work. Is that 29?"
Charlottesville,2rfct6,Phantasmal,2,Tue Jan 6 02:12:36 2015 UTC,Yup. That sounds like 29. Although it could be the 250 bypass but that should be wrapping up pretty quick whole 29 construction is just getting started.
Charlottesville,2rfct6,balathustrius,2,Tue Jan 6 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"Ohh yes that sounds like the construction on 250. Absolutely horrible. It's been going on for a few years but it should be finished soon! I have to drive by it every day and I'll be such a happy camper when they stop closing one lane during rush hour.

It's a good way to hear about what various people are up to and represents a decent cross-section of the tech businesses in town, or just to talk about whatever is of interest to you.  Members have suggested that I cross-post these meetups to Reddit when another one comes around, so I'm making good on that promise with this post!  Meetups are easy to remember: it's right in the name. We meet the first Wednesday of every month, starting around 7:00 PM at South Street Brewery (but sometimes we move around a little, like when South Street was renovating or if we just want to try something else, so you should check out the meetup details just in case!)."

You can eat at Michie Tavern after that on your way down the mountain after your tour where you eat food that was eaten in the Jeffersonian times. I believe Michie Tavern closes at around 3 so be aware of that.   I definitely second the winery or brewery tours, although the weather is more fitting for beer, I think.  Most of the breweries have a full menu but I think Wild Wolf brewery has the best food. If you do the Blue Ridge Brewery route, there's also the Bold Rock cidery so you can try all types of cider and Silverback, the new distillery for moonshine, vodka, and gin.   Enjoy CVille!"

On the mall you'll find Christian's Pizza, Revolutionary Soup, Just Curry, and Marco & Luca's dumplings if you are looking for lower priced places. The Skybar and C&O are good for more upscale, and Mas is amazing and not too far of a drive from the DT Mall (get there early though!). You definitely won't have trouble finding a good restaurant as we have a lot of them here.   Wine tasting is big in Cville, so you can always do that.

There's another incubator in Richmond that's much farther a long, and includes some employment matching services. Can't recall the name, it's somewhat generic like Virginia Biotech Innovation Center.

Charlottesville,2pouop,dan1101,2,Thu Dec 18 15:36:00 2014 UTC,"I don't doubt this guy was in some shady or sleazy dealings of some sort, but seems like the judge and CA are determined to leave him in jail and convict him of abduction despite evidence that at least parts of the accuser's story were made up:   Judge Cheryl V. Higgins declined to hear the motion Wednesday, as the sentencing already had been continued several times. Albemarle Commonwealth’s Attorney Denise Lunsford objected to hearing the motion on the same grounds.""   So they just want to railroad this case through in spite of new evidence?  Or does he need to go ahead and be convicted and then file an appeal?   After the motion was declined Wednesday, Benjamin asked for a continuance on the grounds that he is an employee of the General Assembly, where he serves as paid special counsel to the Senate Courts of Justice Committee. The Code of Virginia allows for an automatic continuance of court proceedings for employees of the General Assembly who request it in a period stretching from 30 days before the beginning of the General Assembly session to 30 days after the session ends.""   So then the judge moved the sentencing forward to May to dodge that 30 days rule.  Seems like a bit of a dirty trick to me."

At our apartment, the doorknob on the entry door broke one Friday, so we could not get in or out. We called them around 5 or 6 that afternoon to tell them, and when the guy (their son) answered, he said he was already in bed and wouldn't be out till Monday with a new knob. Instead, their handyman came out that night, and the solution was to take the doorknob off and duct tape the hole for three days before they did anything else about it.   When we were moving out, their son was on the property, so my roommates asked him if he wanted our big screen TV at no cost. Of course he said yes, then they charged us a trash removal fee for it later."

Charlottesville,2owpo3,AquaFloat,4,Wed Dec 10 22:07:29 2014 UTC,I've also been meaning to check your spot out. I listen to Joe Rogan's podcast and he's a big proponent of float tanks.
Charlottesville,2owpo3,MountainMan121,5,Thu Dec 11 01:02:04 2014 UTC,"He is! However, we caution anyone who listens to Joe Rogan to go in without any preconceived notions of what happens in a float. The experience is highly individualistic, so it is really best to set any expectations aside."
Charlottesville,2owpo3,fsacb3,3,Thu Dec 11 03:06:02 2014 UTC,I'm really curious about trying this. What's the typical first time package? Time? Cost? And what happens?
Charlottesville,2owpo3,scottyjnc,2,Wed Dec 10 22:10:12 2014 UTC,"When we opened, we only did 60 minute floats, but we found that pretty consistently, it takes people around 45 minutes to really get into that deep state of relaxation where the brain starts putting out theta waves. Once you get down that deep, 15 minutes just isn't enough time to really integrate and anchor the experience, so we added an extra 30 minutes. From the looks of the faces on people when they come out of the tank, the extra 30 makes all the difference!  In terms of the effect, the float itself differs drastically among different people. Once thing tends to be pretty consistent though - the glow afterwards. By combining magnesium's muscle relaxing properties with complete sensory silence (audio/visual/kinesthetic), people report the relaxation that comes from it for up to a week later. We've found that it lasts longer particularly for people who have a somewhat regular meditation practice.  Price-wise, we do $60 for a 90 minute float, and we provide pretty significant incentives through memberships or package deals."
Charlottesville,2owpo3,kruyne,3,Wed Dec 10 22:23:48 2014 UTC,Is it true that all you need to do to float is weigh less than the water you displace?
Charlottesville,2owpo3,hrtaus,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:11:09 2014 UTC,"Wow, good question! Not so sure about the displacement to be honest, we just make sure you guys float by adding a thousand pounds of epsom salt to each tank, creating a 25% solution of salt to water."
Charlottesville,2owpo3,ElroyZipper,3,Wed Dec 10 22:14:08 2014 UTC,I've been meaning to try it out. I work literally a block away and just haven't found the time to do it. Hopefully after the holidays I can head over there after work.

Charlottesville,2owpo3,jhamm,3,Thu Dec 11 03:05:02 2014 UTC,"I've never heard of this, but I snooped around your site after seeing this post to learn more.  Do you provide any guidance before the float on relaxation tips to get the ideal experience, especially for us non-meditators?"
Charlottesville,2owpo3,AChapelRat,6,Thu Dec 11 01:05:22 2014 UTC,"Hey there! We actually give people a very comprehensive orientation the first time they come in, but aside from the technicalities of the tank, we really recommend people start off with a 15-20 minute ""body scan."" A body scan is a mindfulness exercise where you place your attention on parts of your body to become aware of any tension, and then work to let it go. This is particularly important in the tank because people tend to instinctually tense up because every other time they've floated in water, they've needed their body to be tense in order to stay afloat.  Intentionally relaxing your body in the tank is actually really cool because you sort of trick your brain into believing its a lot better than it actually is because as you are trying to relax your body, magnesium from the epsom salts is getting into your skin through a process called transdermal diffusion. Magnesium has a lot of muscle relaxing properties that definitely contribute to how your body relaxes."
Charlottesville,2owpo3,2_old_2B_clever,3,Thu Dec 11 03:25:50 2014 UTC,"Do you guys clean or replace your water, and if so how often?"
Charlottesville,2owpo3,AChapelRat,4,Thu Dec 11 02:07:30 2014 UTC,"Germs and pathogens can't survive in a 10% solution of salt to water - ours is 25%! Beyond that, every time someone floats, ALL of the water in the tank goes through a filtration system (UV, Hydrogen Peroxide, Ozone, 10 micron filter) a minimum of three times.  We make sure to fully comply with the standards set forth by the National Sanitary Foundation!"
Charlottesville,2owpo3,722KL,3,Thu Dec 11 03:08:34 2014 UTC,How large are the tanks on the inside? I have mild claustraphobia and freak out in something the size of an MRI.
Charlottesville,2owpo3,722KL,2,Thu Dec 11 17:24:59 2014 UTC,"Hey there! The tanks are 8.5-9ft long, about 4ft wide, and about 3.5ft high. We've had a lot of claustrophobic people ""make the plunge"" so to speak, and we haven't had ONE freakout.  The door to the tank never locks, and you can actually keep it partially open as its run by hydraulics. The floater is in complete control the entire time.  Also, you're floating in absolute darkness - its quite hard to tough any boundaries to the tank!"
Charlottesville,2ow0mg,blackwidow618588,0,Wed Dec 10 18:52:59 2014 UTC,"The Cville maintains a best of which does a good job of separating the wheat from  the chaff.

Charlottesville,2ow0mg,tnofuentes,-1,Wed Dec 10 21:10:19 2014 UTC,"I don't think we do have any restaurant critics.  Maybe I should start.  Today I ate at Travinia.  The Granny Smith Apple salad was nice, but was too sweet in my opinion.  The apples didn't have the neccessary sourness to balance the sweet notes in the grapes and dressing.  Another option would be too make the dressing less sweet.  I ordered the Pollo Isabella, my table mates ordered Fettucini Alfredo and Seared Scallops.  All three dishes were lovely.  I tasted the Fettucini Alfredo before and after cheese was added.  It was spot on before the addition of table side cheese, the best I've tasted in a long time.  After, it was too sharp.  The Pollo Isabella was a beautifully composed dish with grilled chicken breast,sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, lemon basil beurre blanc sauce, baby spinach.  The chicken was a bit tough.  This dish is not for the faint of palatte, the flavors meld well, but it is intense.  The high point of the meal was the Seared Scallops. Pan seared with basil oil, over artichoke-pesto risotto this dish was out of this world.  The scallops and the risotto were a perfect pairing: flavorful, creamy, not too heavy.  And the scallops were perfectly cooked.    I had heard tales of terrible service at Travinia and went today reluctantly.  My experience was exceptional and I have nothing negative to say about the atmosphere or our service."

They say they use a bechamel sauce, but I'm pretty sure it was ricotta...  plus it was kinda soupy and the sausage seemed frozen...    My wife had an herb roasted chicken that was delicious though.  Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned."
Charlottesville,2ow0mg,spuddaddy,-1,Thu Dec 11 04:15:12 2014 UTC,"It depends what you're looking for, the food options in Charlottesville are massive. A few top places which come to mind:  I think Mas and The Local in Belmont are both fantastic. Skybar and The C&O Downtown are also great. Ten is very good sushi but expensive, Now and Zen is cheaper but a drop in quality (still good though!).  Citizen Burger downtown is great for classy bar food, Riverside is better if you like smashed burgers. Ace's Biscuits and BBQ is very good too.  What specifically are you looking for?"
Charlottesville,2ow0mg,Azohko,-1,Wed Dec 10 19:42:19 2014 UTC,Everything at Bodo's. Chicken at Wayside. Nachos at Millers. Soup at Eppies. Pizza at Buddhist Biker Bar. BLT at Blue Moon. Wings at Buffalo Wild Wings. Italian at Fellini's. Chinese at Peter Chang's China Grill.

I looked up homicide statistics for Charlottesville from the FBI site, and for each year from 2000 to 2013 the figures are: 3, 3, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 0, 3, 1, 2.    I haven't been keeping close enough track of the news to know the count, but I'll trust you on the numbers.  If this is 6 for the year that's the record for the last decade and a half, but not really out of line with what's possible with random variation."

Charlottesville,2oprs9,FantasiainFminor,4,Tue Dec 9 17:50:42 2014 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but I don't think that's the right response.  If you keep a loaded firearm at home it's vastly more likely to kill someone you love, through accident or suicide, than to prevent something like this.  At any rate, I expect we'll learn a lot more about this atrocity over the next couple of days."
Charlottesville,2oprs9,softwaredoug,2,Tue Dec 9 15:40:29 2014 UTC,"exactly, especially considering homicide stats vs accidental gun deaths. Homicides have been desclining for a while, and are low in Charlottesville."
Charlottesville,2oprs9,InformalCriticism,0,Tue Dec 9 15:56:21 2014 UTC,"It's true that statistically they are being used for suicide more, but based on what he just said, I don't think he's planning anything stupid."
Charlottesville,2oprs9,FantasiainFminor,0,Tue Dec 9 17:52:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, it does not sound as if he/she is planning to commit suicide, but that's not the point.  The point is that if you choose to keep a loaded gun in the house permanently (that is what we're talking about, I think, if the idea is to have it handy and ready in the event of a home invasion), then it becomes a very real permanent hazard to family and any friends who will be in the house.  Over the years, think of the ways a kid could find it; even if it's in a high drawer, could a kid climbing on a chair find it?  If there are no kids in the house now, will there ever over the years be family friends who will come over for dinner with their kids?  Will there ever be a nephew or grandchild over to visit?  All it takes is 30 seconds for a kid to find the gun before a family is torn apart by a tragedy.  And then about suicide.  Will there be teenagers or 20-somethings living in this house over the years?  Life changes, moodiness, depression, bullying, peer rejection, failure, crises of sexual identity, all of these things happen to young people sometimes and sometimes when there is a handy means of suicide in the house a tragedy ensues.  The odds the the gun will be used to deter a home invasion are just tiny compared to the odds of these other things happening."
Charlottesville,2oprs9,InformalCriticism,1 point,Wed Dec 10 03:55:17 2014 UTC,"I would only advocate responsible users of firearms. In every case of tragedy there was a lapse in prevention measures. Complex safety mechanisms have come a long way. (My 1911, designed originally in 1911, has 3 safeties and requires and adult grip on the handle to be use able), spreading knowledge of the firearm and where you keep it is also a risk, in or outside the family. All it takes is a responsible adult to vastly mitigate risk."
Charlottesville,2oprs9,softwaredoug,2,Wed Dec 10 11:05:34 2014 UTC,"To keep this in perspective (and in part why we're so horrified by this crime), Charlottesville homicide statistics are in the low single digits anually.   Random home-invasion turned murder (if that's what this actually is) just doesn't happen around here.  Check the stats yourself."
Charlottesville,2oprs9,FantasiainFminor,5,Tue Dec 9 15:51:40 2014 UTC,"That's a good resource, which I had not seen previously.  Thanks.  You can also get local crime data from the FBI site, and compare it to other towns.  From that site, I picked up the numbers for ""Murder and non-negligent manslaughter"" for Charlottesville for each year from 2000 to 2012.  They are: 3, 3, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 0, 3, 1, 2 respectively.  It'd be nice if those were all zeroes, but they are small numbers and definitely not going up.  So we should not be freaked out by the occasional highly-publicized case."

Charlottesville,2oprs9,anon__sequitur,2,Tue Dec 9 17:55:11 2014 UTC,"with a danger as remote as random home invasion, it doesn't make sense to prepare.

Charlottesville,2oprs9,InformalCriticism,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:16:06 2014 UTC,"And in the same way that vehicle accidents can be avoided, so are firearm accidents.  Responsible, well trained use and stewardship.  Your argument is a little confusing, you're saying that driving is high risk but people do it anyway.  How does that convince people not to take low risk for accidents with firearms in order to prepare for home invasion?"

Omni is definitely not in the parking business and the booth to leave is often unmanned so you can leave for free.  Generally after ~10pm on weeknights and 12 on weekends.  It is also free to leave all day sunday.

Charlottesville,2oe0b4,LyndsySimon,8,Fri Dec 5 19:11:12 2014 UTC,"In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced.   That's a very vague statement, and really cheapens this entire statement in my opinion. This could mean anything from small and largely inconsequential details of her story (which are common in life in general, let alone with the inclusion of potentially traumatic experiences) to a full-on exaggeration or fabrication on her part.  The harsh wording of the next paragraph or so seem to insinuate that this is a lot more than small details, but it would have been nice for them to have been a bit more concise."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,49erlew,5,Fri Dec 5 19:59:04 2014 UTC,"So, this seems to be the article that they were trying to get ahead of.  It looks like there is some confusion about the dates, and whether the guy that this young lady was going out with was a member of the frat.  However, the claim that they didn't have a party on that date is debatable, given their records don't date back that far according this this guy:   Tommy Reid, president of the Inter-Fraternity Council, said that all Greek organizations must register parties with the IFC. He said that the council’s records did not date back to the fall of 2012."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,redreplicant,2,Fri Dec 5 20:04:55 2014 UTC,"Ehhh... even if the records did date that far back, they might still be debatable.  When I was in school (at UNC Charlotte) we also had to register parties with IFC. Parties, however, were defined as either a) any social event which any student was invited to attend, such as our yearly Mardi Gras party; or b) a mixer or other event involving more than one organization.  That being said, we had parties virtually every weekend. The difference was that these were events that weren't advertised, and were pretty much only for brothers and their guests. These were often a lot more low-key, but they were parties nonetheless.  So really, while we were having what would generally be considered a ""party"" almost every weekend, only a handful of them were actually official functions that were registered with the IFC."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,49erlew,4,Sat Dec 6 15:37:59 2014 UTC,"It's a shame that so many people will focus on the discrepancies in the details instead of some of these key bits in the Post article:   Her friends and fellow advocates believe she was attacked, even if they doubt the details of her account. She has PTSD and recurring nightmares about it, so it's possible her own memories of events have gotten mixed up at this point. A ton of other people have come forward to talk about their own sexual assaults since the article, so even if this one account was completely fabricated (which it seems like it was not) you can't act as though there isn't a problem here."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,CJGibson,2,Fri Dec 5 20:40:01 2014 UTC,"The third bullet point is what we should be focusing on; the second is impossible to verify (not that she has PTSD, that it's genuine) and the first bullet overlooks the fact that the details are the part that matter most.   So I agreeto an extent; let's not let this distract us from the problem of sexual assault. But let's not cling to one person's dubious account either. We don't need Jackie's personal narrative to sympathize with a very real problem."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,Jefftopia,2,Fri Dec 5 21:06:13 2014 UTC,"The details only really matter most if you're trying to prosecute someone for something (in which case it matters exactly who it was and exactly what happened).  If you want to be better about helping victims of sexual assault, the mere fact that she was assaulted is far more important than what the precise details were.  But yes, I agree, that the last bit is the biggest.  This one account, whether it actually happened like this, happened in some other fashion, or even didn't happen at all, matters a lot less than the fact that, from the plethora of reports from many different people, there's clearly an issue with sexual assault on campus."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,CJGibson,1 point,Fri Dec 5 21:33:25 2014 UTC,"I don't disagree, but I want to chime in and say that I think the prosecution bit matters a lot.  IMHO, the best way to combat rape culture is to prosecute; seems to me that suspension and expulsion aren't enough to actually deter the crime."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,Jefftopia,1 point,Fri Dec 5 21:38:24 2014 UTC,"Oh absolutely.  I think prosecution should happen more.  But it's also not what's really happening here.  The frat maybe got some negative attention in a lot of people's eyes and if, in fact, they weren't involved at all, then that's obviously a bad thing. (And the vandalism was a bad thing, regardless.) But what should really be the focus here is how can we make society better when it comes to responding to and helping the victims, and for that, the details of Jackie's actual assault matter less than the fact that she probably was assaulted."
Charlottesville,2oe0b4,CJGibson,7,Fri Dec 5 21:41:37 2014 UTC,"I would sum up the original RS article with one word – irresponsible.  Especially, with regard to the (unintended) impact this will likely have on Jackie.  The story, as told by Erdely, is so evil that it warrants some fact checking.  But RS basically says in its’ partial retraction “We trusted Jackie.  She misled us.“  And the implication is that, upon further scrutiny, Jackie is no longer credible.    Mrs. Erdely used Jackie’s story to illustrate the larger issues of a perceived administrative indifference/suppression to sexual assault,  a supposed “rape culture” in fraternities (and UVA as a whole, as illustrated by the verses of the “Rugby Road” song that were published), and violence against women in campuses across the country.   Mrs. Erdely wanted and needed Jackie’s story to be sensational in order to get the most exposure.  She wanted it so bad that she neglected to verify important details (over the course of several months of interviewing Jackie) that other news organizations disputed with apparent ease (over the course of two weeks).    Now, Jackie is being sought by reporters, interviewed by the Charlottesville Police, and questioned by folks in her support group.  And RS says “Hey, we just reported what she told us.  If you have doubts about her story, just take it up with her.”    The original story can’t be un-reported.  Mrs. Erdely and The Rolling Stone Magazine should be ashamed of themselves."

I mean, since - what, 98% of rapes are committed by men? - you might as well add **Holy crap, why do men rape?"".   It's just another shitty argument that doesn't further the debate. Even if some women make false accusations, rape's obviously still a problem."

I don't know if that's true at face value, but certainly in the U.S. society views the accused, and laws have been written to make it just as bad to be accused of rape as it is to be physically raped.  I'm sure your 98% stat and narrow definition of the term ""rape"" is based on only reported data and convictions.  So, I have nothing to say about it.  I didn't argue anything.  I just asked a question.  If it can only be explained by comparing men to raping people, then fine, I agree, it's just as bad.  It was an expression of bewilderment, and you seem to think it is more.  Let me assure you, if I was arguing something, I would do my best to make it obvious and simple to understand."
