HotPeppers,3e5gkq,wzl46,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"Capsicum chinense 'Naga Bon'  Heat rating 11/10  Naga Bon is a newly-bred Chilli that has a neat, branching habit and flavoursome fruit with nice heat. It was bred at The Chilli Factory by crossing the Naga Jolokia with the Scotch Bonnet and named by compatriot Neil Smith of  The Hippy Seed Company fame. Grows to 1.5m high and yields over 2kg of fruit per season.  That was taken from http://www.potnall.com.au/catalogue/item/6-pot-n-all-heart-starters/73-chilli-naga-bon  I would use one or two in a hot sauce recipe. Dry the rest for powder and flakes. Enjoy!"

HotPeppers,3e3g8p,jesusdildo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"pick the first and second batch off quickly before they turn red, water heavily and once the third batch starts getting bigger than the previous, shock the plant a little, dont water them for a day if its not super hot out maybe longer, if the leaves wilt then of course give them some water. stressing the plant makes it release more capsaicin, and you will have hotter peppers if thats your goal, but still your first harvests are the weakest, they speed up after that in that they get bigger and produce more. also pruning is always good to focus the energy of the growth onto the peppers"

HotPeppers,3e169j,zola_zola,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:05 2015 UTC,I've seen experiments done and I have done them myself to the same conclusion. Your first harvest will undoubtably be later but will be significantly larger if topped. So for cold climates its really risky because you delay harvest but you could always bring them indoors to finish off. Works great however for early ripening hot's like thai/fish.

HotPeppers,3e0gyk,banjaxe,5,Tue Jul 21 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm worried I will mess something up   The only thing you're liable to mess up is your peaceful toilet time for the next day or two.   In my experience, if you're just after heat, use whatever hot pepper on whatever dish. If you're looking for a pepper that complements a certain dish, then you have a couple different flavor traits here in this picture.   On the left, the habs are hot and fruity. They're good in caribbean dishes like jerk chicken, they go well with mango, etc..  In the center, assuming those are ""asian"" peppers like aji, etc, can't go wrong with something like stir-fry or barbecued beef. On the right, your fataliis, personally I find those the hardest out of all the peppers I grow to ""mesh"" with a specific cooking style. They have a distinct fruity flavor, and I like them dried/powdered in a shaker for adding a decent amount of heat and ""zesty"" flavor. (I put fatalii dust on EVERYthing.)  Anyway tl;dr buy some Tucks medicated wipes some milk, and chow down on those peppers."
HotPeppers,3e0gyk,banjaxe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:45:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! I think I will dry some of them and use the others for cooking. I never tried Caribbean food but it's a great idea! As for biting in one... Wipes?

HotPeppers,3dyqqb,Socal7775,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:22 2015 UTC,I was thinking of transplanting it into a large pot with better drainage that I could keep partially covered but still outdoors. The issue isn't so much the rain (I am covering it with shade cloth) but with the water on the ground. The dirt here is sand and clay and so the ground can stay soaked for days after a rain. When it rains every day....very wet soil. I thought a huge container might be better.

HotPeppers,3dwo9p,juanitospeppers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"Weed is always a good choice that uses a good amount of attention if you don't have the automated systems set up :)   But really, peppers are easy, just make sure you get a big enough pot with good drainage on the bottom and a good soil setup. I like the E.B. Organics potting soil mixed with lots of vermiculite to help the soil stay airy. Drains well and helps the roots thrive. Once you do that and it gets going, you barely have to watch it. Just give it enough sun and it'll provide more peppers than you know what to do with. I've done this with ghost peppers and jalapeños so far, I still have ghost peppers left over in my freezer from last summer (got over 100 from one plant)."
