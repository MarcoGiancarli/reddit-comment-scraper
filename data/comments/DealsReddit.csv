DealsReddit,3e0zg5,Baoburu,12,Tue Jul 21 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"It seems like there are a lot of serious campers in this thread who assume everyone is looking for a tent to live out of for a few weeks.   I have a smaller Ozark tent that I've had for a few years. The rainfly leaks and it doesn't cover the whole top. The sides leak. It survived Mountain Jam twice, a trip to the Pine Barrens and a night on the Appalachian. If I camped more I'd invest more, but it was like $20 when I got it.  Ozark Trails is a Walmart owned house brand and they're pretty shitty, but if you want a tent for camping in the backyard, at a festival, or for a random one night trip, this is a fucking steal, especially considering the bed and chairs that come with it."
DealsReddit,3e0zg5,rastacola,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I'm not going to take an REI tent or anything more than 80 bucks to a festival for some drunk person to fall into and break, or it to get ripped by idiots walking by.  I buy a cheap tent like this that I don't care if it breaks. Solid deal."
DealsReddit,3e0zg5,meest,3,Tue Jul 21 20:39:30 2015 UTC,What's the quality on this?
DealsReddit,3e0zg5,PewPewPenguin,8,Tue Jul 21 04:13:09 2015 UTC,It's Walmarts store brand.
DealsReddit,3e0zg5,I_Saw_What_Ya_Did,8,Tue Jul 21 04:29:31 2015 UTC,Ozark trail is actually pretty good for its price. Those chairs wont last too long depending on how often you go camping and Intex is typically a better air mattress that will last. A really good deal in my opinion since you can find similar style tents for the same price.

DealsReddit,3buva2,Hopkins2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"I have the same brand kickstand, but with two slots for cards instead of one big slot.   I really like the product, but have a few issues. The leather on the corners of the back of the case are starting to wear, showing the undyed leather underneath.   Also, the kickstand is magnetic. Be careful around your credit cards. But the magnets aren't strong enough to use the kickstand as a money clip.   And the case doesn't extend past the front glass, so if you set your phone face down, it is resting on the glass, not the case."

The case fits the phone well, snaps right into place and offers access to all the ports on Apple's design. And even when the wallet portion is full the wallet case still fits comfortably in the pocket. The added attraction is that the wallet portion of the case also provides astand' for viewing messages or other diversions while sitting on you desk. A very fine new addition to the iPhone 6"

DealsReddit,3baw4h,HigH1guy,2,Sat Jun 27 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"Save your money. I got a pair when my Sennheiser hd280s broke. They are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever owned. I bought stuff to make them more comfortable, and that was a waste. After a short time I caved and bought another set of hd280s, which probably cost about $75. I'd take them over the monoprice headphones any day of the week. My primary uses are editing video and playing music, and the monoprice cans actually hurt to wear after a short time and were always coming unplugged while I was playing. The hd280s sound better, are more comfortable, don't get easily disconnected while I am playing music, and provide better sound isolation from the outside world. So yeah, save your money for something else."

On the side note, there is no way to detect hardware keyloggers. They promise to detect all software keyloggers and they do.  I have been using SpyShelter for over 3 years now and as far as I remember the software exists since 2009. Moreover, they are offering free 14 day trial without registration.

DealsReddit,38rf7z,KnashDavis,2,Sat Jun 6 21:41:26 2015 UTC,I'm with you. It's hard not to be at least a little skeptical that the products listed are not was they actually say they are when the prices seem way too low. It may look similar and there may not be many negative reviews because generally people don't know anything about leather. Good reviews may mean these are worth the cost but it also might make more sense for someone who knows more to move along. I hope OP responds.
DealsReddit,38rf7z,0157h7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:06:52 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I have a little experience with leather which is why I said something.   I really do hope OP responds as I'm genuinely curious.    Good reviews may mean these are worth the cost but it also might make more sense for someone who knows more to move along. I hope OP responds.   This is absolutely true! They may be well constructed and worth the cost.
