pokemon,3e222u,lava172,3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"No, there are several more responses below this one"
pokemon,3e222u,skippingmud,7,Tue Jul 21 18:17:15 2015 UTC,"Great insight about the mechanics of forgetting a move. I think it could be supported by the fact that these forgotten moves can be remembered, although with the help of an outside force. The data of the move is still there; the Pokemon just needs someone to ""reactivate"" the data for it."
pokemon,3e222u,Elr3d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:20:16 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with the fact that the pokemon has issued the command to use the move, so the game already checked if he was able to use it (is it in moveset, does the pokemon has enough PP for the move chosen). By the time the pokemon actually uses the move there is no further check?   In any case I don't think there is any check on what attacks the pokemon should be able to use given its data, else what happens during an online battle when a Pokemon in OR/AS uses a move it doesn't learn in X/Y (applicable to any generation, I was more thinking Diamond/Pearl vs Platinum)? In one game the move would be legit and not in the other. I mean isn't it possible to hack any move on any pokemon?   Do being paralyzed or hurting one-self in its confusion still expense the PP? I don't remember. What would happen if you issue a command to use a move, get hit with whatever attack makes you lose PP so you don't have any for this move, then forget it? I'd be curious to know if the game still knows about forgotten moves PP."
pokemon,3e222u,Silver34,10,Tue Jul 21 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"In online battle, if you are on OR/AS and the opponent is on X/Y, the one on OR/AS can't use any move that is only possible on OR/AS. You can't even fight him.  Maybe there is a check on the pokemon data (the species) but not on him specifically.  But on the PP case, maybe we can try something with Spite. The thing to know is what kind of information the game retains on a forgotten move. Or, just like Encore, you can't use Spite on the move because the pokemon doesn't know it at the time."
pokemon,3e222u,Jimtehjournalist,10,Tue Jul 21 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"If I recall you can trade pokemon with moves they couldn't learn in XY back from ORAS, so long as the move exists, say if you taught a pangoro Knock Off at the battle resort. Not so with new moves such as origin pulse though."
pokemon,3e222u,gregguy12,4,Tue Jul 21 14:57:19 2015 UTC,Couldn't they patch the move into X and Y?
pokemon,3e222u,Elr3d,3,Tue Jul 21 15:51:36 2015 UTC,Yes but they decided not to
pokemon,3e222u,SamTheSammich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:21 2015 UTC,"Is this restriction also present in non-online battles? I don't seem to remember anything of the sort and I'm pretty sure I used the Battle resort to teach a few a my poke some new moves, then battled my brother with them who only have X. But maybe I'm imagining things.  This restriction using pokemon's data can totally come from GF's online filter (that for instance forbade any pokemon but those of Hoenn for some tournaments), but it is not necessarily tied to the game engine.  What I'm wondering is, is there a way to make a game check for a forgotten move PP before it is used using OP's method? I really wonder what things could break (or not break) with this. It's all about what the game retains on a forgotten move as you said and it can say a lot about the engine so it's really interesting."
pokemon,3e222u,skippingmud,71,Tue Jul 21 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"This is because when you activate a move, that specific moved is put into a queue or similar structure for your Pokemon. When it is time to use your move, if the Pokemon is still alive, that same moved will be used. Moves are really references to the actual data. The game is not doing a check to see if that move is learned by your Pokemon at the time of execution, and just carrying out the move.    You can test this by using a memory editor in an emulator. Select your move, and then freeze the game. Edit the value of the pending move to something else. You will use the attack corresponding to the new move ID.   OP found a legitimate bug. There probably wasn't a test case for this during development."
pokemon,3e222u,SamTheSammich,30,Tue Jul 21 14:07:40 2015 UTC,We're talking about two different things though. You're referring to the forgetting of moves as part of the game while I'm referring to forgetting moves as part of a Pokémon's natural capability. I thought OP was addressing the latter but since we're talking a lot about the former I guess I thought incorrectly.  In any case I agree with you though. It's definitely a bug.
pokemon,3e222u,DamngedEllimist,7,Tue Jul 21 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I see what you mean. I was just trying to outline the mechanics behind why OPs situation was possible. Cheers"
pokemon,3e222u,JoeDelVek,12,Tue Jul 21 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"In fact, i'm interested in the two, and maybe the two are linked. Maybe the game does it like this on purpose and it's not a bug.  And maybe it was done so to lay emphasis on the fact that it's not a permanently forgotten move but, like I said in my post, a move that is put aside to train other moves.  ...or maby the developpers are lazy :P"

Normally, when i think of a cool thing like this, i find that someone else already found it and even has a complete explanation. In this particular case, I didn't find a clue.  And for my English, i learnt it in school, so i can write pretty well. But you never know, some sentences can sound weird for some people.  Good luck in finding the next cool thing :)"

pokemon,3e222u,tatonkaman156,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:58 2015 UTC,"To me [British] those mean different things. ""I'm writing a letter to my friend"" implies that the friend is the intended recipient of the letter. ""I'm writing a letter for my friend"" implies that I am writing the letter on my friend's behalf, and my friend will send the letter to someone else.  But ""sound weird to some people"" and ""sound weird for some people"" mean the same to me. Although I would prefer to write ""to""."

pokemon,3e222u,Entinu,7,Tue Jul 21 17:57:41 2015 UTC,Ah ok. That makes sense.
pokemon,3e222u,sander1095,3,Tue Jul 21 13:47:25 2015 UTC,"This is just a guess, but I'll try to explain what might be happening:      When a move is selected to be used, it is put into the queue for execution immediately and waits for the Pokemon's turn. If the move is forgotten after the move is selected but before it resolves and is used, the move in question that is already in the queue will be executed anyway. When a move is selected, the game subtracts PP, some calculations, etc,. When all that is already done and the move is slated for execution, why reference the Pokemon's current moveset? After all, it's faster not to check and nobody really expected a move to be forgotten in between selection and execution anyway.      As for why recalling forgotten moves using Encore doesn't work, it's probably because it needs to reference the moveset each time Encore is in effect. When a move is being recalled because of Encore, it's as if the player is selecting the move once per turn until Encore ends and it acts that way- PP is lowered, calculations are redone, etc,. If that weren't the case, a successful Protect that has been recalled using Encore would be successful each time and have no PP lowered, or a critical hit being recalled would be critical each time. Since this is the case, the game would realize the move is gone (or at least the move suddenly has 0 PP) when it sees the moveset and stop Encore.      Other things taking multiple turns like Uproar might continue because once they have been selected by the player, the moveset- unlike with Encore- does not need to be referenced, as one Uproar takes one PP no matter how many turns it lasts. Thus as long as it is in the queue, it will calculate everything needed by itself and its effects will carry out as if the move weren't deleted. Referencing the moveset would make the move execution process slower."
pokemon,3e222u,GreasyBub,3,Tue Jul 21 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting analysis.  In fact, i asked this myself by comparing this case with the ""Encore/Torment"" or the ""Encore/Disable"" combo which forces the pokemon to use Struggle.  The game could have checked the pokemon's moveset as it checks the stats for instance.  But expermient shows us that it's not the case"

A team of Staravia and Monferno were in a double battle iirc, and Monferno leveled up after Staravia got a kill, it wanted to learn Close Combat, so I got rid of Shadow Claw. Staravia had just attacked before, and Monferno was to move next, and instead of using Shadow Claw, it used Close Combat. Maybe it's something only possible in Gen VI, or just triple battles."

pokemon,3dz5mu,juan-jdra,149,Mon Jul 20 21:12:03 2015 UTC,I think the big thing is a majority of the ground moves available when this type resistance happened all affected the ground itself so pokemon in the air were immune. Now its gotten out of hand.
pokemon,3dz5mu,linkbetweenworlds,78,Mon Jul 20 21:24:07 2015 UTC,"Similarly, Doduo can't fly, but it's part flying type (somehow??), so it's immune to ground, but logically that doesn't make sense (the whole flying type thing doesn't make sense). That's more of a case of a plain weird type choice, though, and could have been fixed by making Doduo a normal type."

pokemon,3dz5mu,ParchedCamel,22,Tue Jul 21 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Chickens can't fly but they have claws and wings, beaks too. Peck is a flying type move because mainly birds have beaks. Surf is a water type move because it's easy for water pokemon to surf, doesn't mean that other type pokemon can't (Dragonite, surfing Pikachu)."

pokemon,3dz5mu,Delavonboy12,16,Mon Jul 20 22:28:12 2015 UTC,Bonemerang is a gen 1 move though.
pokemon,3dz5mu,slowest_hour,2,Mon Jul 20 22:31:38 2015 UTC,Was it ground type in gen 1? I can't remember.
pokemon,3dz5mu,linkbetweenworlds,28,Tue Jul 21 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"This ^ Though we really need to keep in mind, its a show still geared towards children sadly. Despite its loyal fan base, they really aren't worried about technicalities."
pokemon,3dz5mu,Nyx90,5,Mon Jul 20 21:34:08 2015 UTC,The way i saw it. Ground moves are slow hard hitting move. They can't land a hit on flying type they are fast and have better options to dodge in the air. Dodrio is fast prob miss him too.
pokemon,3dz5mu,PencilFiend,3,Tue Jul 21 00:49:01 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with the specific moves themselves, but rather the concept of their types. Its pretty intuitive that flying type pokemon are always above the ground, and thus wont be affected by ground attacks"
pokemon,3dz5mu,facedesker,5,Mon Jul 20 21:37:15 2015 UTC,The problem with the idea though is that the types don't always accurately reflect the pokemon. Gyarados is water and flying but can't actually fly yet is still immune to ground attacks.
pokemon,3dz5mu,NextArtemis,22,Mon Jul 20 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"I think the logic is that having control of the ground wouldn't do much against something not touching it (earthquakes don't directly affect airplanes for example). The problem is that bonemarang shouldn't really be a ground type attack, since boomerangs don't stay on the ground unless you're really bad at throwing them."
pokemon,3dz5mu,ptatoface,22,Mon Jul 20 21:25:00 2015 UTC,I think the only reason Bonemerang is ground type is so Marowak gets STAB so it can be a useful move.
pokemon,3dz5mu,Metalhead62,10,Mon Jul 20 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"Make it a combination rock/ground move (a la Flying Press), since a bone is a type of fossil and yadayada prehistoric Pokemon and rock typing."
pokemon,3dz5mu,CanuckPanda,6,Mon Jul 20 22:27:42 2015 UTC,"Except 0*2=0, and it still won't work. Unless flying press' damage modifier is counted differently"
pokemon,3dz5mu,pmofmalasia,4,Mon Jul 20 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"How does Flying Press work against ghost types? Is it considered a fighting attack and thus doesn't affect, or is it considered a flying attack and still hit them?  The latter is what I'm thinking for a dual-type Bonemerang."
pokemon,3dz5mu,CanuckPanda,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:44 2015 UTC,Flying press doesn't hit ghosts.
pokemon,3dz5mu,me1505,5,Tue Jul 21 00:22:49 2015 UTC,"Before someone claims to have been hit by it, remember that Foresight allows for Ghosts to be hit by Normal and Fighting moves. You may have been hit by it, but it was only because of a move like Foresight was used first."
pokemon,3dz5mu,SupermansBulge,3,Tue Jul 21 00:27:39 2015 UTC,Scrappy too
pokemon,3dz5mu,flounder19,9,Tue Jul 21 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"I reckon it should just ignore flying immunity, that would be cool."
pokemon,3dz5mu,MetalMrHat,10,Mon Jul 20 22:08:56 2015 UTC,"I think Bonemerang, Bone Rush, and Bone Club should be able to hit Flying-types and those with Levitate.  The unreleased attack Thousand Arrows will be able to damage Flying-types and those with Levitate, so why not the Bone attacks? Or possibly even mud attacks like Mud Shot and Mud Bomb?"
pokemon,3dz5mu,zoso33,6,Mon Jul 20 23:31:26 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does that sound insanely OP? 10 less power than Earthquake in exchange for hitting everything? Including Gengar for super effective?
pokemon,3dz5mu,Jack_Krauser,3,Tue Jul 21 04:23:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. Type advantages exist for a reason; ground immunity is one of the key aspects of Flying in terms of viability, considering how good ground type is. While type-breaking moves have been explored lately, they're definitely not going to be dished out so liberally to retcon older moves for the sake of logic, and there's a definite reason why Thousand Arrows has never been released. It would just be way too powerful."
pokemon,3dz5mu,Naikado,4,Tue Jul 21 06:10:39 2015 UTC,"I think the definite reason that Thousand Arrows hasn't been released yet is because they're waiting for Zygarde's new form. That and the other attack, Thousand Waves, will be released soon, just like Hyperspace Hole/Fury and Steam Eruption, and like Diamond Storm was."
pokemon,3dz5mu,zoso33,5,Tue Jul 21 06:26:06 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, it seems like it should be a ground type attack only because it's Marowak's signature move. I can see it being super effective against Rock and Electric, not very effective against Grass, whatever. Just as a result, it also happens to not effect Flying type, which is just weird."
pokemon,3dz5mu,Dapplegonger,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"They should do classifications like they do for some psychic attack. Like when some psychic moves state they are also physical, like psybeam..or psyshock or whatever."
pokemon,3dz5mu,teh_proto,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"That's just psyshock I believe, it uses your spec atk against the target's def instead of their spec def"

pokemon,3dz5mu,EnterTheTragedy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:46:56 2015 UTC,No. It's because the flying types can fly.
pokemon,3dz5mu,Juicedid9111,3,Tue Jul 21 00:27:57 2015 UTC,You're trying too hard to apply logic to this.

pokemon,3dz5mu,sickly_snake,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:37 2015 UTC,But Pokemon like Aegislash and Klefki who float above the ground are still affected by ground type moves.
pokemon,3dz5mu,neopolitancake,2,Tue Jul 21 04:40:26 2015 UTC,"I think the obvious answer is that the flying types are always assumed go be in the air (and moves that paralyze you and whatnot take their toll when the victim has roosted on a tree or somewhere high up).  Moves like bonemerang probably just fly a foot or so above the ground, whereas the flying pokemon is 50 feet up in the air (or sleeping in a tree 20 feet up)."
pokemon,3dz5mu,uber1337h4xx0r,2,Tue Jul 21 08:30:56 2015 UTC,I get what your saying. But they do have eyes. As far as I know anyways.

pokemon,3dz5mu,Protosega,8,Tue Jul 21 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"Bonemerang should get a buff that allows it to hit Flying types for Super Effective damage, much like Freeze Dry hits Ice types for double damage. It would give Marowak a strong niche. They should do this for more moves. It'd level the playing field to introduce this for certain poorly spread moves providing edges against other Pokemon types, not necessarily those they're weak to, but just giving them a strong way to counter.  Go on, it'd simplify things Ken, honest."

pokemon,3dz5mu,xEtownBeatdown,178,Mon Jul 20 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"To this day, I remember that fighting type is ineffective against flying type because ""have you ever tried to punch a bird?"""

pokemon,3dz5mu,Daibakuha,67,Mon Jul 20 20:28:47 2015 UTC,The way I see it is like dark types use tricks and dirty moves as attacks like feint because they are too weak to normally damage something and have no elemental dmg types so fighting types just take the hit but are strong enough to ignore most of the damage.
pokemon,3dz5mu,smellerbees,101,Mon Jul 20 20:34:49 2015 UTC,"In Japanese dark is essentially evil, while fighting pokemon generally are considered the hero types. So it makes sense that one is good against the other."

But for weakness explanation, Forest Fires, Frostbite, Locust Swarms, Pesticides. The Flying VS Grass thing you kind of have to look at the flying as a more ""Wind"" type for that to make sense."
pokemon,3dz5mu,colin23567,2,Tue Jul 21 00:45:46 2015 UTC,Hmmm you're good at this. I'm gonna ask you some more in the hope you can think up some more solutions.     Why is Grass super effective against Water? Why isn't Freeze Dry the default behavior? Psychic -> Poison Ice -> Dragon
pokemon,3dz5mu,Kiosade,11,Tue Jul 21 01:44:20 2015 UTC,"Grass is super effective on water because plants absorb and drink water.  Ice is resisted by water because water has a high specific heat capacity, meaning it requires lots of energy to freeze or boil (also explains why it resists fire).  Psychic is good on poison because smarts are required to counteract poisons (though if it was the other way around I'd say poisons attack the nervous system).  Ice is good on dragons because what killed the dinosaurs? (A: DE ICE AGE)"
pokemon,3dz5mu,Masterdavis,6,Tue Jul 21 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"Psychic could be like... Mind over matter. You have such great control over your physiology, that you can essentially render the poison ineffective (or less effective). Kinda like how placebos can help people even if they have no active ingredients. Ice vs Dragon is probably like... Dragons are oversized lizards, and lizards can't live in icy cold areas (they are cold-blooded, so need lots of heat to live)."

pokemon,3dz5mu,MintyFreshNipples,8,Mon Jul 20 22:07:14 2015 UTC,What is going on here?
pokemon,3dz5mu,DefNotNuz,31,Mon Jul 20 22:34:14 2015 UTC,Starf berry boosts a random stat by 2 stages when a Pokemon gets below a 1/3 of their HP.  Cheek Pouch gives it HP back as well and substitute keeps Dedenne status free and healthy.  Recycle allows Dedenne to regain the berry after use.   It's a very gimmicky set that is very unlikely to work but it's fun when it does.
pokemon,3dz5mu,Derninator,19,Mon Jul 20 23:02:54 2015 UTC,"The dedenne in question is holding a starf berry at the beginning of the battle. His ability is cheek pouch and his moves are recycle, giga drain, substitute and thunderbolt. What the strategy here is that the dedenne starts off with a substitute and then simply stays alive until his HP gets to 25%. At that point, the starf berry is activated and sharply raises a random stat on dedenne. Because of his cheek pouch ability, the dedenne can also gain back 33% of its HP bring it to around 50% HP. He then substitutes again to protect against the next attack and uses recycle to regain back the starf berry. This cycle continues until the dedenne has enough stat boost to sweep. He then thunderbolts his way to victory while giga draining when needed."
pokemon,3dz5mu,TheJonatron,6,Mon Jul 20 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"Dedenne's ability is cheeck pouch, every time it consumes a berry it restores 25% of it's health. It holds a Starf berry which boosts a random stat by +2. And recycle restores your eaten berry."

pokemon,3e1ywq,mjc27,6,Tue Jul 21 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that it is as vague as you say. When all there is to go off of is a silhouette with 2 glowing eyes and a glowing thing just above the eyes, making the connection to a similar feature in both Kyurem forms, which we know story-wise does have a final form isn't out of the question. And it would be a nice twist for them to go back and finish Kyurem off instead of going with the obvious Zygarde form. Lets not forget that there is references to Reshiram and Zekrom in Kalos, so its not completely out of right field."
pokemon,3e1ywq,KingPikablu,6,Tue Jul 21 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"firstly, there is a lot more to base idea's from such as, the cycle of movies (think the giratina in the sky warrior after the dakari one). then there is the fact that there are other clear shapes in the silhouette that suggest zygarde. and thirdly the eyes aren't even similar. the unova twins eyes had the third 'diamond/ kite shape, while zygarde's new form silhouette has a different shaped middle part."
pokemon,3e1ywq,mjc27,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that calling the kyurem theory isn't vague like you say.

pokemon,3e0oy7,imepicwin,41,Tue Jul 21 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"Several issues later, when more fans were contributing to the PokéCenter section of Nintendo Power, we started seeing more decently-built teams.  Hell, I remember when somebody had a Slowbro with Fire Blast on their team.  I was like ""it can learn Fire Blast!?""  My mind was blown."
pokemon,3e0oy7,Ghalheart,23,Tue Jul 21 03:04:37 2015 UTC,I remember reading one where a Persian knew Thunderbolt. My 9 year-old brain exploded.

I haven't followed it too closely, but apparently the latest hilarious TPP-ism is that they created a secret base, messed around with the PC and accidentally plonked a fence across the entrance.  Which they were then utterly unable to remove so that they could get out.  They ended up using an Escape Rope.  Oh, and two of their party members made an egg in the daycare, the result of which actually leveled up into a useful party member."
pokemon,3e0oy7,swirlythingy,4,Tue Jul 21 14:01:43 2015 UTC,They are actually. They're currently doing a randomized version of Alpha Sapphire. The viewer count is very low these days though.

pokemon,3e0oy7,pokemonfreak97,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:47 2015 UTC,Technician Persian is one of my all time favorite Pokemon. Make her a special attacker just because you can. Shockwave/WaterPulse/Swift/Nasty Plot is damn strong in game.

Breeding wasn't a thing yet, TMs were limited use, so if you had multiple teams,  you were out of luck (and I doubt NP would advocate the Missingno.

pokemon,3e0oy7,el_gumbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:38 2015 UTC,Seriously. Tauros was the very last thing I caught in Gen I when I hit 150.

pokemon,3e0oy7,berychance,28,Tue Jul 21 06:08:49 2015 UTC,Why did you switch to Alakazam on Rotom heat instead of Blastoise? And why not Blizzard for the last move instead of Skull Bash? It's at least worth a shot.
pokemon,3e0oy7,TheSlimyDog,3,Tue Jul 21 06:06:59 2015 UTC,I was worried about Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch.

pokemon,3e0oy7,Vengeance417,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:37 2015 UTC,"Banning any pokemon they don't like without good justification, If they get to ban one, they would have to ban another for example they banned m.mawile and then they banned aegislash because it was wrecking OU, ofc it would wreck it now that mawille was gone, also, that Lando-I ban was just hillarious when Lando-T is a much greater threat for the Meta game."
pokemon,3e0oy7,Kkalox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:09 2015 UTC,"Since I've been out of the loop, all I know were the Aegislash/Greninja/Mawile bans. What were some of the other things?"

pokemon,3e0oy7,Kkalox,9,Tue Jul 21 17:07:22 2015 UTC,Didn't they do that in 5th gen? Didn't seem too controversial then.
pokemon,3e0oy7,misserray,4,Tue Jul 21 17:33:08 2015 UTC,At least back in gen 5 lando had access to it's HA which atm in gen 6 it doesn't.
pokemon,3e0oy7,Kkalox,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:19 2015 UTC,Couldn't Alakazam learn the elemental punches in Gen 1? I seem to recall just giving them to my Abra when I caught him simply so I would have some moves besides teleport...
pokemon,3e0oy7,strider_moon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, I don't believe so.  Not in Gen I, at least.  IIRC, you could get the elemental punches taught onto the Abra evolution line in Gen II, starting with Gold/Silver."
pokemon,3e0oy7,Ghalheart,14,Tue Jul 21 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"Ah yes my mistake! It was Gen 2, just outside of Goldenrod City. Thanks very much, and sorry about that :P"
pokemon,3e0oy7,strider_moon,26,Tue Jul 21 04:09:37 2015 UTC,You had to teach it them in Gen II and transfer it back.
pokemon,3e0oy7,MintyFreshNipples,24,Tue Jul 21 12:56:46 2015 UTC,"Via GSC, the punches mad Stadium 1 a joke, throw the 3 punches on an Alakazam and sweep everything."
pokemon,3e0oy7,metalflygon08,10,Tue Jul 21 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"Oh god the pain. All but one of them has at least two moves of the same type. Two horrible accuracy moves makes Blastoise a joke, and Fly on Zapdos? Come on.  The only halfway respectable moveset is Gengar's."
pokemon,3e0oy7,FlakJackson,22,Tue Jul 21 02:08:23 2015 UTC,Blizzard had 90 Accuracy in gen one for some dumb reason.

pokemon,3e0oy7,Hytheter,18,Tue Jul 21 08:58:01 2015 UTC,"Blizzard is one of the best attacking moves in the game. 120 BP, 90% accuracy and a chance to inflict the most devastating status condition in the game. It was used on practically every pokemon that got it."
pokemon,3e0oy7,berychance,27,Tue Jul 21 06:07:11 2015 UTC,No STAB lick?
pokemon,3e0oy7,kononobunaga,7,Tue Jul 21 04:28:14 2015 UTC,Toxic and Hypnosis? How is that half respectable? It's quarter at best.
pokemon,3e0oy7,aaronfaren,6,Tue Jul 21 02:18:13 2015 UTC,"Compared to the rest, and considering the limited Gen 1 options it sure as fuck is.  And don't knock Toxic, it's a great move and has always had a strong presence in comp Pokemon."
pokemon,3e0oy7,FlakJackson,5,Tue Jul 21 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"It's not that Toxic is bad it's just you can't sleep and poison a Pokemon at the same time and since Dream Eater is its only attacking move, it doesn't make much sense."
pokemon,3e0oy7,aaronfaren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, right, fair enough."
pokemon,3e0oy7,FlakJackson,7,Tue Jul 21 02:33:03 2015 UTC,Let's talk about how annoying it is to be confused and toxic'd at the same time.  Which you can be.
pokemon,3e0oy7,RuneKatashima,4,Tue Jul 21 12:45:29 2015 UTC,"Toxic is awful in RBY because once you switch out, it reverts back to normal poison.  It also blocks paralysis, freezing and sleep, the important statuses in RBY.  Poisoning Tauros, Starmie or Alakazam is a death wish in RBY because you can't slow them down or stop them.  This is also why Fire Blast is a poor option (and it thaws freeze).  Hypnosis is actually good on Gengar.  It's awful by itself, but Gengar is the fastest sleeper, so if you nail the first turn sleep that's a big advantage."
pokemon,3e0oy7,x42bn6,4,Tue Jul 21 09:44:33 2015 UTC,"Um, did freeze exist in RB?"
pokemon,3e0oy7,RuneKatashima,5,Tue Jul 21 12:46:09 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It's even worse in RBY, because you don't thaw (unless you are hit by a Fire move).  http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Freeze_(status_condition)#Generation_I"
pokemon,3e0oy7,x42bn6,3,Tue Jul 21 12:52:51 2015 UTC,The way this is written makes me want a Pokemon themed Total War-like game.

pokemon,3e0oy7,TheSlimyDog,2,Tue Jul 21 05:57:56 2015 UTC,"They don't even mention ev and iv spreads, which did both exist on red/blue just no breeding"
pokemon,3e0oy7,The__Chosen__One_,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:20 2015 UTC,"Smogon doesn't typically list IV spreads anymore either. Generally, you just want them perfect outside of the attack stat for pokemon without a physical move and some other rare cases.   It's the same here for both. There's no decision to be made. You could max out every EV and you obviously want perfect stuff outside of that."
pokemon,3e0oy7,berychance,5,Tue Jul 21 06:13:08 2015 UTC,"EVs were not limited to 510 until gen III, so every competitive Pokemon had 255 in everything."
pokemon,3e0oy7,edavis707,4,Tue Jul 21 12:42:23 2015 UTC,"There was no limit, so you would have all 15s and all whatever-255-squared-is."

Or everyone would like in gen 1-2, basically have the same Pokémon.  And to you saying everyone train to get one same like smogons usage tips. Urm, no. You don't need to check out smogons page and copy the exact same IV/EV/Nature/Moves they tip you to use. Experiment on your own. It might pay off."
pokemon,3e0oy7,TheOneWithALongName,2,Tue Jul 21 09:36:13 2015 UTC,"I'd support getting rid of IVs at the very least. EV's/Natures can stay. The game would balance a bit better and my OCD would settle down. Most people want play the same IVs anyway so apart from a time investment, they really should be set."

I completely forgot that Hyperspace Fury goes through Protect (and its variants), so I tried to King's Shield and instead ended up tanking a hit with my face; not until it mocked me by laughing at my Aegislash afterwards. It looked like fun, but if you're saying it doesn't have potential, that really sucks... :/"
pokemon,3e2f93,creyk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"It does hit hard of course. But most of the time, the opponent outspeeds it and OHKO's it, which is really disheartening.  That is why I gave it Sticky Web support so it actually outspeeds opponents. However, often it attacks so much that the Opponent stays alive with a very low HP and hit back really hard.  Also, it's ability is completely useless"

pokemon,3dyba4,Nas160,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"Aren't there a bunch of hacked ones on the GTS though?  I mean TECHNICALLY the one I'd give you would be ""hacked"", indirectly; either by using a code to get Oak's Letter but then catching it legitimately, or by injecting a wonder card/mystery gift into the game.  In both cases the pokemon would be legal and as close to legit as you can get if you never got to go to the events - there wouldn't be any IV or EV shenanigans or any of that shit. No fakery."
pokemon,3dyba4,KoNP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"Hey just wondering how have you found the wonder cards online, and how would you inject them into say a pearl game, or a pearl save on an R4 card?"
pokemon,3dyba4,Juiced4SD,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"If you've got a legit cart, you'll need to dump the save file using PPSEDS (which you do need a flash cart for) and then edit it using something like Pokegen (only for gen 4 or 5).  Here's a database of all the events for the relevant games. You would download the relevant files and insert them into your save using Pokegen.  If you're using a flash cart, you should be able to get a usrcheat.dat file that contains cheats that activate the events as if you were currently attending one. Say for example you want the Member Card in Platinum (for the Newmoon Island event). You'd flick the cheat on, then go into your nearest Pokemart and talk to the little dude in green standing by the desk. He gives you the card. As far as the game knows, this is all completely above-board, so there's no illegal/illegitimate flags on the pokemon if you catch it normally.  If you're wanting to do it with Gen 6 games, you use a device called a Powersaves Pro 3DS. You plug your X/Y/ORAS cart into it, and it allows you to activate events using a similar method to the flash cart event cheats I mentioned. Same story - as far as the game knows it's all legit, and you also get the wonder cards to boot (although you can delete them later as per usual).   I've used all of the above methods and they work flawlessly, and Pokebank doesn't bat an eyelid at the pokemon obtained this way - not even the Hall of Origin Arceus, even though the item for that was never released.  For the record, I don't see the value in hacking in stupidly overpowered pokemon, forcing shiny, making impossible EV/IV combos or anything like that. I'm loathe to refer to the event activation as ""cheating"", even though it technically is, because that gives it a connotation that is somewhat undeserved."

pokemon,3dyba4,RibShark,10,Mon Jul 20 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"yes because the initial diancie distribution was that using the code it would be sent to pokemon x and y, whereas this distribution can only be accessed through omega ruby and alpha sapphire's mystery gift.  so to clarify, you can only receive this gift if you have one of the ORAS game.  this mystery gift will not be attainable if you only have x or y.  however if you already got diancie for x and y and you also have oras, your intitial diancie wont mess up your chance to get another because  they are for different games."

pokemon,3dyba4,greyredpanda,8,Tue Jul 21 15:58:26 2015 UTC,One of the things I've been regretting is not picking up Diancie the first time round. I hope this is available in Australia too.
pokemon,3dyba4,CMGuy89,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"It should be, because Nintendo consider Australia to be in Europe for most things, events included."

pokemon,3dyba4,CMGuy89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:35:26 2015 UTC,I already have a spare Diancie from the first distribution cause I got them for both D and Y. If this one is available for Australia too then I'll get it for both my games again and I'll have three extra... The only thing they'll be good for at that point is trading to get other event legendaries.

pokemon,3dwp6u,Bellicapelli,7,Mon Jul 20 12:26:07 2015 UTC,'con' is a slang word meaning 'vagin' (vagina) but the word lost it's real meaning. So yes 'con' = 'cunt' which is also a slang word for 'vagina'.  In french some games also censor the word 'douche' that means 'shower'.
pokemon,3dwp6u,Herowyn,8,Mon Jul 20 12:32:31 2015 UTC,"Yes but saying that Con is equivalent to saying Cunt is just wrong, they have nowhere near the same impact."
pokemon,3dwp6u,Bellicapelli,5,Mon Jul 20 12:42:20 2015 UTC,I was just saying that etymologically it's the same word. The use and interpretation are different.  Edit: The word 'con' is also the abridged form of 'connard' which means 'douche' in english. That's the one /u/Bellicapelli was refering to.

pokemon,3dwp6u,fullplatejacket,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if a Pokemon gets traded with a taboo name or a taboo OT name then I guess the answer would be to just replace the nickname outright.

If you just want to name your character Viol that's one thing, but if you use an actual well know name that shouldn't be a problem. Furthermore Pokémon online services are international so it wouldn't make a lot of sense to allow one person to be named Violet and not the other one based in regions. Showing the names online is probably the biggest concern, not what you do in your own game."
pokemon,3dwp6u,Vilokthoria,8,Mon Jul 20 13:12:52 2015 UTC,The French equivalent of Violet would probably be Violette or Violet.  Means purple.

We as a community shouldn't be forced to moderate ourselves, especially since we have such a great team of mods who want to keep this community in quality condition. We were allowed to vote, as a community, on whether or not to ban low effort content, and we decided to do so. The mods didn't have to let us have that option, but they considered the overall community opinion instead of just bringing down the banhammer.

pokemon,3e2p7u,HoennBorn,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:41 2015 UTC,This is my main issue - if you decide this much content is unacceptable there will be little to no content at all.
pokemon,3e2p7u,pokemonfreak97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:01 2015 UTC,Speculation posts are different from those funny memes. I think a good way of compromising could just be to have a mega thread that gets refreshed every month and has a link to archived threads. That's better than making a new sub or changing the rules back entirely.
pokemon,3e2p7u,Codyislong,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"The numerous ""I just completed my XXXXX pokedex give me Karma"" posts come to mind. The memes suck. Fusions aren't creative. Neither are shinies. Reposts come through all the goddamn time. There's a reason why I leave this sub between game announcements. The quality of the posts here falter a lot. I'm glad these rules are enforced."

pokemon,3e2p7u,Goldeen_Need_Log,6,Tue Jul 21 18:03:19 2015 UTC,"You seem to be completely misunderstanding the new rules. It has nothing to do with the 'seriousness' of a post. The only 'joke' posts that are being removed are the one-liners, that I'm sure most people have heard before. All of those 'joke comics' that are popular will be fine, since it involves artwork that clearly takes effort. Look closely at the 3 conditions:    Did not obviously require a good deal of time and effort to create Not especially original or unusual Does not seek information which would be difficult to obtain via Google   Most are not going to be searching for information, so we can ignore the last one for now. If a post did not take any effort, and is nothing original, is it really worth posting? I don't see how a post like that can have much (if any) merit. Posts that are unoriginal but took effort are fine, and posts that took little effort but are original are also fine."
pokemon,3e2p7u,Goldeen_Need_Log,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"When the mods decided to vote on the rules, they made a sticky thread. For the next weeks, the side bar, the sticky thread, and information bars here and there  informed the community of the temporary changes, so that the community could vote on them, having seen them being implemented, in another sticky thread. That's 2 sticky threads, information in the side bar, information bars, and threads being removed, over the time line of  ~1 month.  That you did not notice all of this, is your problem. The community has already spoken, and has voted on these changes. We know what the majority of the community thinks, and the mods have listened. To demand a re-vote, just because you didn't pay any attention and don't agree with the majority of the community, is not how this stuff works.  And what if this re-vote would happen and the rules would get reversed again, and another person shows up to complain? Should we re-re-vote? Should we re-re-re-re-re-re-re-vote for everyone who ignored everything, or was on vacation, or whose phone and laptop were broken, jadajada during this time? No. No, we shouldn't. You visited this subreddit many times during the past month and missed your chance, that's too bad for you but not our issue."

I'm not saying that this is how it will play out, but if the majority decides that they don't like this new rule, why shouldn't it be reversed?  I've said elsewhere that it's very possible to participate in this subreddit heavily and never actually visit reddit.com/r/Pokemon, thereby missing all stickies.

You can't keep going back and forth like that.  It's true that you can see content without visiting the subreddit if you're subscribed, but the way Reddit works is that you'll miss much of the content as well - as you will have noticed by now. Doesn't mean my point doesn't stand, since you missed your chance by your own actions (not visiting the subreddit directly), which still simply puts you on the list of 'people who would have voted if they knew, but somehow didn't get the memo despite the mods' efforts', like the other examples I gave in the last paragraph.  Consider this a learning experience and that it's wise to sometimes visit the subreddits you feel strongly about to avoid being out of the loop, and take the opportunity to vote, make suggestions, or otherwise contribute in any way in any future community votings."

However, if you made a post saying something like ""What's your favorite Pokemon joke?"" then people can contribute to it and start a conversation. Do you see the difference?  One of the best things I've seen here recently was this. Did it take hours/days to do? No. Did it start a great conversation? Yes.   That's the difference. When jokes get posted, what is there for anyone else to say but ""oh, good one."" But when you make an open thread for people to add to, then you've got something good. I'm not bashing you here, I'm outlining the difference between something that adds to the sub, and something that doesn't."

And how is that their problem? What, did you expect them to somehow code something into reddit that forced people to answer the poll before browsing? That's not their problem. If, as you say, people didn't care until it negatively affected them, THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM. They easily could have done something to prevent it, but they didn't care enough. If they didn't care enough to do the poll the first time around, why should the sub cater their rules to them? No other elections work like that: ""I didn't care enough to vote for this issue but then when I saw how much it affected me I really think you should do a re-election because all the people that didn't care enough to vote should get a vote!"""

I'm not looking to force anything through based on my opinion alone, I'm just trying to gauge the community and bring attention.  If I knew the issue existed, I would've voted against it.  However, as I said before, I don't check /r/Pokemon six times a day looking for updates in case some rule changes might take place.  Its not unreasonable that I and others may not have even been aware of changes coming down the pipeline until we saw their real effects in action.

We also did it with a catch: two weeks later, on 14 July, we would ask the community to vote on these bans. If people didn't like them, they would go away. If people liked them, we'd keep them around permanently.   That second link is from here. You had about three or four days to come here. If you really don't check /r/Pokemon more than once or twice a week, this rule won't affect you at all.

pokemon,3e15dc,Cruel-Anon-Thesis,11,Tue Jul 21 04:02:31 2015 UTC,"I accepted long ago that Gamefreak will never let Pokemon live up to its full potential. They insist on marketing to children, as they should, but refuse to include optional features that will appeal to many players, children and adults alike.  Most notable is the lack of a difficulty setting. So, so many of us would kill to have a Pokemon game where the trainers are actually challenging, where they strategize, predict and exploit type advantages. But aside from Black/White 2, we haven't seen anything remotely like it.  Furthermore, you can never get too attached to any particular feature, because inevitably it'll be gone with the next game they bring out. Secret Bases? Gone for three generations and only brought back because their games were remade. Following Pokemon? Fuck you playerbase that universally desires this as a permanent feature. Gym leader and E4 rematches? Sporadic at best in appearance and often implemented poorly.   I'll admit that Gamefreak has improved a bit lately. We've actually seen a full set of features (PSS) introduced in one set of games transfer to a second, different set of games!  But DexNav? Yeah, we're never seeing that again."

pokemon,3e15dc,FlakJackson,6,Tue Jul 21 13:04:56 2015 UTC,"I do agree that there's a lot of lost potential with the Gen 6 event legends given that legendary and mythical Pokemon, from the very way we describe them, are products of (or supported by) legends and myths. The other event Pokemon aren't really filled to the brim with lore, but they do have, at the very least, some sort of story attached to them before being able to catch them.  I also think that it's a shame that we don't get to catch them, although this I have a feeling is one of the things reflected by their attempt to make the games easier, as it's one less legendary to worry about catching.   That being said, I have a feeling that we don't know the full story between the three event legends yet. I saw this post on Tumblr speculating that they may be connected to the Anistar Sundial. Of course, this could be a stretch and their story could really just be limited to the very shallow dialogue we get from the events, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that the next Gen 6 game might have something up their sleeves for them, just like how Platinum expanded on Giratina."

pokemon,3e15dc,_Aurora_,4,Tue Jul 21 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"Making the event legendaries actual events would be great. There are some issues with making them events where you have to go catch them (such as them being harder to recognize by not having set OT, ID, Cherish Ball, Ribbon, etc), but it worked in the past and it really is a more fun system. If they just use Hoopa then they don't even need to make a ton of separate islands/areas to encounter them (such as Sinjoh Ruins/Embedded Tower in HGSS, or Navel Rock/Birth Island/etc. in Emerald). As much as having those locations in-game is cool, with the growing list of legendaries, they could even just make a special area to use event items (or hey, Hoopa!) to summon them.  Also, making them events where you have to go catch them would make the events WAY LESS farm-able, which I think is a good thing because it does make them more personal. I know a lot of people on /r/pokemontrades would probably cry though."
pokemon,3e15dc,Leocul,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:16 2015 UTC,"There are some issues with making them events where you have to go catch them (such as them being harder to recognize by not having set OT, ID, Cherish Ball, Ribbon, etc)   None of the things you listed to identify them would be a problem, unless it's recognition by other players. The game just has a certain flag set for event legendaries that checks if they're eligible to activate whatever event. This is shown in-game with ""a fateful encounter at x location"" IIRC, and is what prevents legendaries that are poorly done hacks to activate their events. I don't think this still exists in Gen VI, I believe it just checks for a Pokemon of the proper species and nothing else, but it's how events were handled in Gen IV. This was mostly done for giveaway Pokemon, but the Oak's Letter Shaymin had this flag set in Platinum so that way it could be used to obtain the Gracedia Flower. I think the Full Moon Island Darkrai and the Hall of Origin Arceus had these set, too.  I think the main problem is that they thought it might be getting too complicated for the kids they're trying to direct the games to. In D/P/Pt, the Arceus event never happened as they figured it was too complicated for kids to know where to use the flute. Why not just kind of hint at going to Spear Pillar with it on the website or on the event card? The last event that required an actual effort was the Liberty Island Victini in B/W, and even then, it was given out on release so that players would encounter the event during the story of the games.   As much as having those locations in-game is cool, with the growing list of legendaries, they could even just make a special area to use event items (or hey, Hoopa!) to summon them.   I like this idea a lot, but I don't think summoning them would give that same feeling as past events did. Maybe if you battle against them after summoning them? I think once you summon them they should go out into the world and roam, similar to the Beast Trio, Lake Trio (Platinum), etc. They could still have 3 IVs and stuff, and synchronize would work for ability if you caught them. I doubt it'd happen, but whatever, we can hope I guess."
pokemon,3e15dc,Swiftphantom,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Not only does the concept of these Legendary Pokemon being events pretty much rob us of them ever getting interesting backstories/lore on them, but it also forces considerably more soft-resets trying to get one that is even decent. This is because distributed Pokemon usually have their IV's completely randomized and give the player no way to either influence their nature or get them in a ball of choice. Gen 6 finally took a step in the right direction by having all legends that are obtained normally in-game have a minimum of at least 3IV's maxed, but at the same time cemented that another good feature would also not be returning: the event item. The event item (like Oak's Letter or the unused Azure Flute) fixes most of these problems, not only usually letting us interact more with other characters as the player figures out how to use it to unlock the legend in question, but that same process usually involves us getting some cool lore on the alluded to Pokemon before we encounter it.   There is one slight problem with the event item though: GameFreak thinks that most of them are too hard for children (and even a few young adults) to use without having to consult a guide of some sort. Since these games are largely marketed to children, this instantly pushes GF away from a almost perfect solution to this problem as they would feel that it would be too difficult and unfair to its younger audience. Oh, how they have neglected the past. Back before the Internet was as established as it was, rumor and hearsay regarding glitches and other such things were some of the reasons why Pokemon even became a multi-national phenomenon at all, especially with respect to Mew. Why not instead of just assuming that we are all too ignorant to use an item that you properly word its description or better work it into the plot to give us more hints on how to use it, if it even be necessary. You had it right back in Gen 4, and the environment for using event items is arguably even better than back then due to the PSS and improved internet functions/distribution.  On an unrelated note, I'm surprised that there isn't a ""lesser legendary trio"" like in all the other regions similar to the Legendary Birds, Beasts, or Golems, instead favoring these largely underdeveloped solitary legends. Not only was it a bit jarring, but it helped exacerbate one of X/Y's greatest flaws: its almost barren post-game."
pokemon,3e15dc,ThePokeBro,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like event Pokemon are made for the anime at this point. That's where they debut and they're unavailable until the movie's first showing. They're not even allowed in official competitive rules so really they're only collectables in Gamefreak's eyes. But even with this, I don't understand why they can't at least just have DLCs for the Pokemon with a short side quest to capture them. It's easy to do, keeps everything from being discovered by hacking, and would generally keep fans interested in the series between releases. The Pokemon development team is an enigma."

pokemon,3e25bt,Cardifox,3,Tue Jul 21 13:33:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're getting downvoted for, asking a question is apparently not allowed now or something.  /r/tf2 is the subreddit for Valve's popular Multi-Class shooter, Team Fortress 2, where there is a whole boatload of optional extras in the shape of hats that you can win or buy.

Kind of like Battle Frontier is, I'd imagine this area is outside the boundaries of any one region. I'd like it to draw a crowd of famous Pokemon NPCs and PCs alike that you can talk to and/or battle. It'd be neat to, say, complete my Kalos Dex and then go on vacation and meet Oak or win a Johto badge or obtain a Soul Dew from Ruby. That kind of a place would be fun to explore."
pokemon,3e25bt,BlooburyPancakes,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:33 2015 UTC,"I think accessing new areas in the game would be a great reward. Such as an area where you battle Red, among other protagonists depending on the day/time, a Battle Frontier, and/or somewhere to catch lots of hard-to-find Pokemon with a shiny rate like that of the Friend Safari (except it can be multiplied by the Shiny Charm in this case).  That, or opening a new area to catch the event legendaries, and/or another chance at all the ones you catch in-game."

pokemon,3e25bt,iprefertau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:30 2015 UTC,"Problem with that is, if people have a Living Dex in Pokemon Bank, they can get the Championship Points, use Game Sync to register the points online, then put everything back on Bank, restart the game, and complete the Pokedex again.  Because of the Global Link's update system you can only farm the points once per week, but that makes getting Championship Points way too easy."
pokemon,3e25bt,KaSlaps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:14 2015 UTC,but what if you can do it once per game per account?
pokemon,3e25bt,iprefertau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:28 2015 UTC,"Again, that's the problem. If you restart the game, you have to delete your old game file from your account, and sync the new one, which is why it's a once-per-week job.  The only way I see it being viable is if it's once per Play! Pokemon account, but even then I don't know what number of Championship Points is reasonable, as you technically haven't earned them via VGC battles."
pokemon,3e25bt,KaSlaps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:28 2015 UTC,Play! Pokemon account   that's what i meant to begin with  i think it should be the same as participating and not winning in a local VGC tournament  i dont know about the vgc though i only play tcg
pokemon,3e25bt,iprefertau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:30 2015 UTC,"Well, getting any considerable CP merely for completing the video game is kind of pointless in my opinion, since you're not earning it in the same way as CP should be earned (via battles).  If you got it once per game, again as I said, each time you reset your save file it counts as a new game. You'd be able to farm 4 Pokedex completions a week, so any negligible CP boosts per Pokedex completions actually becomes significant (even at 1 CP per time you'd get 40 CP in 10 weeks which is starting to enter dangerous territory)"

Would me breeding help me or am I best doing other stuff. I don't know anything about breeding. Do you have a link our video that explains how to breed well? Thanks.
pokemon,3e060e,simoalley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:59 2015 UTC,Breeding will only give you one of two Pokemon that you've already caught and left at the day care center. If you breed with a ditto (poke 1) the begotten Pokemon is always the same as poke 2
pokemon,3e060e,Tekken_Fashion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:45:11 2015 UTC,Thanks. Guess it helps to not have to go catching 2/3 of everything. Cheers.
pokemon,3e060e,simoalley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:48 2015 UTC,"There's probably loads of videos on YouTube, but I'll try to explain.  Each Pokemon have a set of iv's which is like genetics, the best iv a Pokemon can have in a stat is 31, you can have the stats in, HP, Attack, Defence, Special Attack, Special Defence and Speed. You can check the iv of Pokemon by finding the iv checker.  Finding 6iv Pokemon is extremely rare so the best chance is getting a ditto from r/breedingdittos, the dittos hold a destiny knot which means that offspring will be likely to be 4-5iv, if you pair a ditto with the Pokemon you want, if the Pokemon is given an everstone then it will pass down the nature onto the offspring. Natures can increase and decrease stats, there are some that are neutral so no stats increase or decrease.  Natures and iv's are used for battling, for example if you have a physical crobat, you'd want iv's in: HP, Attack, Defence, Special Defence and Speed. This would increase all the stats for Crobat, as Crobat is a physical attacker, having iv's in Special Attack wouldn't be beneficial. Also, Crobat's nature is important, the most common nature used for Crobat is Jolly, this increases his speed and lowers his special attack. As there are loads of other natures its best you keep breeding until you get one with jolly.  From the top of my head this is the only things I can think of, but if you have any more questions, look on bulbipeadia or serbii as they're probably a lot better at explaining than me."
pokemon,3e060e,JTC_x,-9,Tue Jul 21 11:20:48 2015 UTC,Any possibility of giving me that Ditto? :3

pokemon,3e060e,XzaylerHW,14,Mon Jul 20 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"I breed for competitive stats and moves, and if I have access, rare Pokeballs like Dream Ball and the HGSS exclusive ones."
pokemon,3e060e,KaSlaps,7,Mon Jul 20 23:21:08 2015 UTC,"I just use Showdown for competitive because starting up in game seems very daunting and overwhelming. If you wouldn't mind, I'd love some help getting started."
pokemon,3e060e,KaSlaps,17,Mon Jul 20 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Grab a Destiny Knot and an Everstone Head to /r/breedingdittos and follow their guidelines to receive a Ditto with all IVs at 31. (/r/pokemonforall can give you Dittos to deal with Hidden Power IVs. Again, follow their guidelines) - Note that any Ditto obtained from these locations will be hacked and/or cloned. If you have a Pokemon with the Nature you want, ready to breed, give it the Everstone. This guarantees the Nature is carried to all Eggs. You can give the Everstone to your Ditto to carry its Nature. If not, skip this section for now and come back to it once you've bred a Pokemon with the correct Nature. Put the Destiny Knot on one of your Pokemon. This guarantees that a total of 5 IVs will be carried from the parents to the offspring. This is useful, as you are able to get anything up to 5IV perfect with just Ditto + random. The more perfect IVs you have on your Pokemon, the more likely it is your Eggs will have perfect IVs as well. Do the cycling bit. This is the most long-drawn part of the breeding process, where you cycle about to hatch your eggs. The Battle Resort in ORAS has a cycle loop round the island. If your hatched Pokemon's IVs are better than the current Pokemon in the Day Care, switch them around (don't forget to move the item to the new Pokemon too). You can check in the Battle Resort Pokemon Center by talking to the Ace Trainer near the map (any stat with an IV of 31 will be described as ""can't be beat!"", and 0 is a negative comment. You'll want 0 for Speed stats in Trick Room, and Attack stats on Pokemon that use physical attacks, but anything works for Attack). Egg Moves require using a female of the Pokemon you want to hatch and a male in the same Egg Group knowing the move. Serebii has any info on Egg Moves you'll need to know, and it may be that your Pokemon has all the Egg Moves you need. Females can pass Egg Moves on too. If you want your baby Pokemon to be in the Pokeball of a parent, make sure the female is in that Pokeball (Ditto and genderless Pokemon can't do this job) as only females can pass the Pokeball onto Eggs. Note that Hidden Powers require specific stats having either even or odd IVs. 30 won't show up as ""can't be beat!"" and may be hard to detect. Entering a battle with all Pokemon set to Level 50 can help this, and there is an old lady in a house in the northern area of Fortree City who tells you what type your Pokemon's Hidden Power is.   I think this covers everything. Let me know if you need any more help or if I worded anything terribly."

pokemon,3e060e,hyperambush,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:44 2015 UTC,The offspring of a h4xx0red Pokemon will be legal Pentagons. I bred a Wondertomb 6IV with a normal Spiritomb and that non-Wonder-tomb is legal.
pokemon,3e060e,SalaBenji,3,Tue Jul 21 05:26:44 2015 UTC,So the offspring from such 6V ditto is perfectly fine and does it mean this is how pro usually does it?

pokemon,3e060e,DefiantEmpoleon,2,Tue Jul 21 06:28:56 2015 UTC,"yes competitive players use ditto's with 6iv's, and no the offsprings are not seen as ""hacked"" pokemon, even at tournaments the hack check doesn't work as well as one would like, a landorus modified with AR to have 5/6 perfect iv's will not set off alarms, recently at uk nationals someone was caught using a hacked hydreigonn, how did they know? the hydreigon was lvl 50 in that guy his battle box, which isn't possible since hydreigon evolves at 55, so if you hack , you just have to do it good lol..."

pokemon,3e060e,llamalegs100,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:40 2015 UTC,"I breed for stats/egg moves and for the Pokedex, mostly; my attempts to breed for shinies have never worked out well. I use the standard Power Items/Destiny Knot + Ever Stone setups, and of course, the destiny knot calculator I once saw linked here. Also very important to discover the loop in your respective game, though I am not bold enough to use a coin to exploit it to the fullest. And don't forget Talonflame for flight and faster hatching."

pokemon,3e060e,pieraite_cannerball,5,Tue Jul 21 11:19:21 2015 UTC,I breed to launder my action replay.  Also egg moves for competitive battle
pokemon,3e060e,PKMNtrainerKing,5,Mon Jul 20 23:57:02 2015 UTC,I breed because I love the feeling of all my hard work finally resulting in a shiny competitive pokemon. There's that one second that my heart jumps when I look down at the screen for the thousandth time and see an oddly colored pokemon. And that one second feels so nice.
pokemon,3e060e,Potataro,2,Tue Jul 21 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"I breed when I'm bored. Breed, EV train, and level up pokemon for battle. Thing is I'm terrible at putting teams together. I can breed and battle like nobody's business but i can't put together a decent team for my life."

pokemon,3e060e,simoalley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"Alot of answers here are normal. Get some egg moves and iv's and you're good to go. My answer is a bit weird because i rarely battle, and i think i have most of the competitive pokemon in the game already... yet i still breed things...  I think i still breed because firstly, i find satisfaction in creating order from disorder and using my understanding of the game's features to manipulate a system. I like the fact that i can, in a relatively short amount of time, pick a pokemon, and create something almost impossibly perfect, that would be a 1 in 326 x 20 chance of getting through random encounters in the wild.   Secondly, i also enjoy the thought process behind my breeding projects and the fact that i have calculated the breeding process down to a fine art, wasting very few steps and seconds. I have six 6IV dittos so that i can immediately start with the six most popular natures without wasting time.  Thirdly, i enjoy using my talents for the benefit of other people. I breed things sometimes simply to give them away on the likes of r/pokemongiveaway because they're rare or hard to obtain in some way for most people, but not for me.  Fourthly, I've been doing it for so long now on X and Y that it feels like an enjoyable hobby and complex game all in itself. I simply can't do it in ORAS. The fact that the hatching of every egg messes up your direction on the cycling loop on the battling island in ORAS is an absolute shambles. I also don't feel like earning Hatching Power lvl 3 again. So i breed in X and Y, and then send to ORAS.  If you'd like anymore information on breeding, please let me know :)"
pokemon,3e060e,SomeAltRamen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but someone already provided sufficient information. I'll PM you if I ever need some help, though. :)"
pokemon,3e060e,simoalley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:29 2015 UTC,I posted above asking this also.   Hi mate. I'm going about wanting to complete the living dex. Fairly new to these games. Would me breeding help me or am I best doing other stuff. I don't know anything about breeding. Do you have a link our video that explains how to breed well? Thanks.
pokemon,3e060e,SomeAltRamen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:31 2015 UTC,"Breeding will get you pokes that you have the evolution of when you can't catch the base form, such as Spearow or Meowth.  To get an egg for a certain pokémon, you need two things:   A FEMALE of the family you want (e.g. Persian for a Meowth egg) A MALE of a species the female can bred with.  Check the Bulbapedia page for the mother's Egg Groups and pick from there.   Alternatively you can get away with the following:   A Pokémon of either gender and the family you want to breed A Ditto.   ONce you have the Pokémon, you just throw them in the daycare, walk around (in game) and come back later!  After a while the day-care person outside may be facing toward you - that means you have your egg!  Otherwise, keep on walking it can take a little while!  PROTIP: Make sure the daycare person goes off your screen to ensure that you're notified that there's an egg ready."
pokemon,3e060e,simoalley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:39 2015 UTC,Thanks. Guess it helps to not have to go catching 2/3 of everything. I'll have to look into it deeper and start figuring it out. Cheers.
pokemon,3e060e,Aurion7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:38:43 2015 UTC,"Catching is less grindy than breeding in ORAS with the DexNav, because you get the poke already leveled somewhat so that you can train it to evolve more quickly.  It's only needed for some pokes where you can't get the first stage for whatever reason."
pokemon,3e060e,K_Ketaan,4,Tue Jul 21 09:40:40 2015 UTC,With the dex man thigh I still have to just walk through grass to get the new ones right? Like in the first route I have caught 3/5 which is the first 3 from the original game and not the 2 from after the E4. The only way I can catch them is by luck right? Just wanting to make sure there isn't some easy way and I'm using the dex nav wrong.

They're pixels, but I find it amusing to have something to care for on my spare time.    Process:   Any little cup Pokémon will do, though I try to find bank balled females.

pokemon,3dvs3b,InsaneZee,17,Mon Jul 20 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"After getting into TCG, I'm fairly sure that the anime goes at least partially by TCG rules.    I can't tell you how many times I cringed at how many times the anime blatantly disregards type matchups, how many times the effects of moves made no sense, how many times base stats were ignored, and so many other things that made not sense in the context of the games.  In TCG, Pokemon often have no resistances, the stadium can have a huge impact on the battle, certain attacks can partially or completely negate the opponent's moves, and there are clutch moments where KOing the opponent or getting KO'd comes down to no better odds than a coin flip (literally, in TCG).  If you think about the anime as having elements of both with general anime elements mixed it, it makes a lot more sense."

Can an anime expert help me understand how legendary Pokemon are supposed to work? Like, Tobias has a Darkrai and a Latios, if I'm not mistaken. Is that the Darkrai? Or is there more than one? Also, is there any anime figure that's existed so far who would have a chance against Tobias?"
pokemon,3dvs3b,CallMeBanjo,47,Mon Jul 20 01:51:21 2015 UTC,There was an episode in Johto where they find a Lugia and a baby Lugia. So I'm sure it's like there's multiple different legendaries (they're just extremely rare) and 1 REALLY special one which we usually see in the movies.
pokemon,3dvs3b,TwiceBakedPotato,9,Mon Jul 20 01:55:30 2015 UTC,Just like that one time Ash saw that gargantuan Dragonite? Would that be legendary according to the anime or does it need its own (hi)story?
pokemon,3dvs3b,Thrashlock,33,Mon Jul 20 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"In canon, many legendaries aren't unique. Lugia, the Regi trio, the Bird trio, Darkrai, Latios and Latias-a bunch of legends have more than one member of their species out there somewhere.  There's not only the movie version of Darkrai, but there is also a nasty Darkrai in the anime who was tormenting a town until a Cresselia showed up to help the gang stop it, as well as Tobias' Darkrai who is most certainly another individual of the species.  There have been a few of people in the anime who own legendaries. Two frontier brains, for instance, owned an Articuno, and the other owned all three members of the Regi trio. Thing is that Tobias was just a badass wandering master who obviously trained his Pokemon like a beast. We don't know how he'd fair against, say, Elite 4 or actual champions, since we barely ever see them in action, but Tobias more or less totally decimated Ash's team with just Darkrai, and then sent Latios out to finish off Ash's last Pokemon."

pokemon,3dvs3b,Renaulte,79,Mon Jul 20 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"It makes sense when you stop looking at the anime as just a number game like the actual games. It's real life for them. You don't win pokemon battles just because your speed stat was higher, so your pokemon will 100% always attack first and do a set amount of damage. In their world, just because your pokemon is faster and super effective doesn't mean the attack will even work. You need to be smart, not just base it on ""265 speed vs 100 speed, i attack first, and have enough power to one shot it. got it.""  Like look at Ash vs Paul. Paul had his pokemon use toxic spikes on the ground to poison infernape. To counter this, ash had infernape jump underground, and literally burn the spikes. You can't do that in the games because they're predetermined number sets, and just a bunch of data in a game.   The anime is about actually having a pokemon battle where everything is moving and happening in real time, with each trainer/pokemon having to think on their feet and react to a live attack.   People always act like the anime is stupid because it's not 100% following the way the games work, yet that's because the anime is about the world being alive. Pokemon can think and react differently just like you can."
pokemon,3dvs3b,Asks_Politely,14,Mon Jul 20 04:49:16 2015 UTC,Speed as a stat and double team is actually much cooler in the anime because you can use them to DOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE!  Relevant flair is fucking relevant.

In a real street fight, is it just ""person one punches, then person two punches, then person one again, etc?"" Or do both people often use different methods of fighting sometimeS? Like say person one picks up sand off the ground at a beach, throws it into the other person's eyes so they can't see, then punches them? Or person one baits person two into punching them, but dodges so person two punches a wall or something and breaks their hand? Things like this are what happens in an ACTUAL live fight (maybe not those exact thigns, but you get the point) which is exactly whats happening in the pokemon anime.

He has massively improved (ignore Unova), and it's blatantly obvious if you compare how inept he was in the original series with what he's like today. The very gradual improvement makes it harder to see if you watch them all in order. In Sinnoh he got to the top 4, and was defeated by a guy that had two legendaries, and Ash was the only one to make him bring out his second. His Kalos team is looking good, depending on what he gets for his sixth, so it should be interesting this time."

pokemon,3dvs3b,GekiKudo,22,Sun Jul 19 23:24:32 2015 UTC,Shoulda kept Goodra on the team...
pokemon,3dvs3b,Crabs4Sale,58,Mon Jul 20 00:36:02 2015 UTC,Goodra will come back just in time to lose against something in the league so that Ash will once again fail to become a champion.  Probably right after Noivern drops.

pokemon,3dvs3b,proindrakenzol,9,Mon Jul 20 14:25:36 2015 UTC,He got rid of Goodra. It went to its home to be big boss. Even though it had some sort of super pokerus that caused it to evolve from goomy to Sligoo to goodra over the course of about 10 episodes.

pokemon,3dvs3b,TheBasicofBasics,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:22 2015 UTC,I kinda wanna know when he reaches league. That's the only time his fights become interesting
pokemon,3dvs3b,MintyFreshNipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:18:45 2015 UTC,He have been going through gyms very fast since this gen is 4 years long. This fall we will see the team flare arc. Numerous magazines implies that Ash will get a key stone by then. I would say the team flare arc will be very interesting since they have set it up in the mega specials. So we will most likely see Ash's M-Charizard Y vs Alain's M-Charizard X since it has been heavily implied in numerous ways. So I would definitely advise you to watch that. We will also most likely see the 8th gym this year. My bet is that the league begins in around april next year.
pokemon,3dvs3b,Keranu,3,Mon Jul 20 15:39:20 2015 UTC,Megazard v. Megazard? That's the only episode of the regular anime I'd tune in for.

pokemon,3dy2dh,chelseabot,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"Did indeed.  It's using Amazon's Lambda server to host the code.  Written in Node.JS, and then used the ASK Alexa Skills Kit to format the questions.  Also used the http://pokeapi.co/ for the database file.  I haven't published the function yet to the market, as there's still some stuff I'd like to improve."
pokemon,3dy2dh,Perks2409,2,Mon Jul 20 17:37:55 2015 UTC,"It would be cool to know evolutions. For example:  ""Alexa, ask Dexter about Growlithe."" ""(Info)... Growlithe evolves into Arcanine by using a Fire Stone.""  Or Mudkip: ""(Info)... Mudkip evolves into Marshtomp at level 16 and then evolves into Swampert at level 36.""

pokemon,3e0rmu,DefNotNuz,8,Tue Jul 21 01:57:48 2015 UTC,i'm sure that would be very difficult to make work
pokemon,3e0rmu,ragnorak12,4,Tue Jul 21 02:04:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should devolve. That would be an asinine move as far as battle mechanics go. However, as a suppressant I think it would be a cool inclusion. I wouldn't want the Pokemon to have access to too many resources that would allow it to simply stall in its existence though (no active or passive recoveries).  I agree with metalflygon, I'd like to see Embargo work against them, and even knock-off even if it already has a strong presence in the competitive world."
pokemon,3e0rmu,Officer_Warr,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:36 2015 UTC,Knock Off's already a pain to deal with so I disagree with you there. Embargo sounds like the better choice since it doesn't also deal damage and isn't as prevailant as Knock Off.
pokemon,3e0rmu,mjangelvortex,7,Tue Jul 21 07:31:59 2015 UTC,"I still think Embargo should prevent Mega Evolution, you'd still have to predict and hit them on the switch-in, but it'd be something."
pokemon,3e0rmu,metalflygon08,3,Tue Jul 21 02:08:56 2015 UTC,Maybe it could be like a 5 or 8 turn effect.
pokemon,3e0rmu,Tolstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:56 2015 UTC,Or until switch out.
pokemon,3e0rmu,djm1997,2,Tue Jul 21 07:34:21 2015 UTC,I think it would be a good terrain move for 5 turns or so
pokemon,3e0rmu,andrak7,2,Tue Jul 21 02:51:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, wait, was that Wonder or Magic Room?"
pokemon,3e0rmu,_Aurora_,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:04 2015 UTC,I think it would work good on a legendary's mega evolution. Like a mega arceus or something that should negate other pokemons strengths.
pokemon,3e0rmu,IceCubesBurning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:05 2015 UTC,I was trying to think of a good possible ability for Mega Arceus. This is the third one that could work.

pokemon,3dy51a,TyFIGHTER420,50,Mon Jul 20 15:07:11 2015 UTC,"Given my current posture, I'd probably tumble to the ground from my chair, hitting my head once or twice.  Being a Fire-Type with no experience on control, there's a good probability I accidentally set the wood floor on fire.  Unharmed by the growing fire, I try to put it out.   Failing that (small paws), I run to the rest of my family to try and warn them of the fire.  They don't understand me but seeing such a creature in their house would prompt them to lock me up while they call someone qualified to handle wild animals.  In the meantime, the fire spreads and by this point probably sets off the smoke alarm.  Reprioritizing, my family calls the fire department and my brother takes the fire extinguisher to try and mitigate the fire.  Fire department gets here, puts out the fire, but my room is completely ruined.  Firefighters ask what caused the fire.  My family points to me.  I cough up a lick of flame as way of proof.  Gain media attention quickly.  Internet goes crazy as Pokémon appears to be non-fiction now.  My family doesn't have the paperwork to own exotic pets; I get taken away.  PETA tries to get a hold of me, no one lets them.  Taken to actual animal care facility.  Employees of Game Freak claim ownership under them having copyrighted my species.  Taken to Japan; Game Freak employees marvel at me for a while.  Scientists show up wanting to observe me.  Game Freak enters an arrangement with the scientists.  I now spend some of my time being observed by scientists.  Continue this way indefinitely."

In Pokemon Red and Blue Rescue Team, the post office was run by Pelipper, and Pelipper would deliver new rescue missions to your mailbox. It's pretty similar to the animal crossing post, which Pete as his email app, but I really like the reference to the mystery dungeon series.  Also, I think that Lanturn or Chinchou would work well for a flashlight app, and maybe have Jigglypuff as an alarm, since it puts everybody to sleep in the anime.  I think either Chimecho or Shuppet would be good for Snapchat, since they both kinda look like the logo.

It would be weird though to have an additional region or section considering how the Kalos Pokedex is already divided."
pokemon,3dykmq,1upIRL,7,Mon Jul 20 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've thought the same thing about the HGSS starting in one region then migrating north. Maybe the southern mountains could hint at a divide between the two Kalos regions. Once you finish the south game region you work through the north, which has considerably harder gyms. I like that idea. I just can see the parallel with BW/B2W2 with in BW the whole destruction of the castle at the climax of the story. Some what same event happens in XY. Maybe they will mirror that aspect, having certain locations closed off, while adding the new southern Kalos."
pokemon,3dykmq,1upIRL,5,Mon Jul 20 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"As well, all they would have to do is add a south Kalos menu to the pokedex. I don't believe that too be too difficult."
pokemon,3dykmq,1upIRL,3,Mon Jul 20 20:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense, but would it be ~150 pokemon of the ~270 not included already in the other ~450?"
pokemon,3dykmq,CrapCakes99,3,Mon Jul 20 20:06:11 2015 UTC,Elaborate on what you mean because I'm not getting what you're saying (my apologies).
pokemon,3dykmq,StrawberryCake88,4,Mon Jul 20 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"The Coastal, Central, and Mountain Kalos Pokedexes each had ~150 distinct species, with a total of ~450. Generation 6 has brought the total up to ~720, so there's only ~270 Pokemon species not already represented in the Kalos Dex. A Southern Kalos Dex would have to choose from those if arriving in Generation 6, no?"
pokemon,3dykmq,xsamy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. Natural assumption would say to add 150 more, but they could always just repeat Pokemon in southern Kalos.

pokemon,3dykmq,Dark-Scar,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:47 2015 UTC,It would also be nice to add 150 additional Pokemon because the whole unobtainable Pokemon debacle and transferring is a mess. That would mean only 120 would be unable to get which would be relatively awesome.

That said Poison-types are routinely slaughtered by Rock, Ground, and Psychic moves. Poison needs more options for dealing with these threats. For example: Why couldn't Gamefreak introduce a move that eliminates Steel's immunity? (i.e corrosive fluids, gases, etc.).   I also wouldn't mind seeing more exotic type combinations for Poison, like Electric/Poison, Steel/Poison, or Fire/Poison; All three of these could draw designs from the real world (especially for combustive chemicals and man-made creatures)."

Of these, I honestly think Normal is the one that deserves that spotlight. While they aren't wholly presented as weak, the strength associated with them isn't really positive, but more of annoying resilience (Whitney's Miltank, Norman's Slaking, and Lenora's Watchog being representatives of this). I'd like for there to be a Normal-type leader that capitalizes on how diverse Normal-types can be, what with their access to a lot of coverage moves and the most powerful no-drawback offensive move in the game.   I'd also like for the Normal-type E4 member to explore the fact that Normal-types aren't limited to their single-typed members. It's only in B2W2's PWT where we get to see leaders use dual Normal-type Pokemon, and even then it was only limited to Norman and Lenora (although Whitney does use Girafarig in her Saffron dojo rematch in HGSS). There's a lot of great dual Normal types out there, ones beyond the usual Normal/Flying and Sawsbuck, especially with the additions of Gen 6.  And, well, it does act as a nice contrast to how Normal-types are usually the first ones you encounter in the game, and it has a nice ""underdog"" feel to it when you see that Elite Four member rocking a Staraptor or Linoone."
pokemon,3dxnk8,skippingmud,9,Mon Jul 20 11:44:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree about Normal types, and I would love to see them in the Elite Four. I'm glad you brought up Norman, as for me he was always the most memorable of the Hoenn leaders. Not because he was your dad, but because he gas always been (for me) the difficult 5th gym hump. There is quite a build up to your challenge, and then somewhat against the ingrained expectations for the type, he is very powerful. Having a supposed underdog like that in the Four would be another great surprise."
pokemon,3dxnk8,xpoz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:40 2015 UTC,"i hate norman's gym because i battle every single trainer i can find in a given gym in order to gain experience against trainers i'll never be able to battle again, and it's such a chore to go in and out of every room and click through all the ""there's a sign. it says this is the attack room. are you sure you want to enter?"" text.  i found anistar gym and the B2W2 version of opelucid gym to be similarly annoying  EDIT: can't believe i forgot about lumiose. deliberately answering each quiz question wrong twice was so tedious"
pokemon,3dxnk8,xpoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"Norman ' s gym is a good example of what a lot of people seem to want though: a gym based around certain tactics rather than just a type. Granted, it's still a normal type gym and they don't go too far with the variation beyond the items, but I would be very happy to see its like again."
pokemon,3dxnk8,lukaswolfe44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:37 2015 UTC,"it's definitely an interesting concept, but usually that specific gym's tactics only get effectively showcased if you go into the gym with an under-leveled team. i don't think any of those trainers even got a hit in during my ORAS playthrough."
pokemon,3dxnk8,queenie504,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:58 2015 UTC,I never had an issue with him. In ORAS especially I just spammed Power Up Punch and beat him with no issue. My Lopunny also wrecked him on my next playthrough using Wondertrade.
pokemon,3dxnk8,Kelbeast,5,Mon Jul 20 22:56:55 2015 UTC,A later type Normal Gym Leader would be fantastic. Usually they are put in the 4th/5th spot but one that's number 7 or even 8 would be pretty nice. I'm neutral on most types but I agree that they should be given a chance to show that they are more than just middle of the road types.
pokemon,3dxnk8,FireHawkDelta,3,Mon Jul 20 14:21:02 2015 UTC,"Was Lance not a flying type user? I seem to remember him having 6 flying types with like 3 or 4 of them being Dragonites, but maybe I'm wrong."

pokemon,3dxnk8,xpoz,6,Mon Jul 20 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"Mentioning Mega Lopunny and Kangaskhan reminds me that I wish we went up against Megas more often in the story as well. In XY and ORAS it was only your rival, antagonist Team leader and the Champion that had Mega Stones. I get that it is a rare thing to have, but it would be nice to see the Elite Four representing their type's Mega possibilities at least, since two random kids can manage.   Plus this would really toughen up the types that Gamefreak seem to think aren't worth the top slots."

pokemon,3dxnk8,creyk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"I had an idea a while back for a UK - based region with the E4 all important military/political figures. I think I settled on Water as an Admiral (Nelson sort of figure), Steel or Fire as Army General, Dark as Spymaster but Bug could work too (we've had shutter bugs so this would be a play on 'bugging' as in espionage). The Dragon type Champion would have been an Arthur type figure. I liked the idea of a Normal E4 member who was the Attorney - General - sounds lame but she'd be called Orla  (Irish name and almost the word normal like a female Norman) and she would be all about precise speaking and argument: 'Watch me precisely cut to the heart of this matter!'; 'Maybe I was wrong...maybe actions do speak louder than words' etc. She'd obviously use an Exploud!   Even if bug weren't in the E4 I think there are enough good Bugs now for a late game bug gym."

They should be used more for meaningful powerful pokemon as well, there is nothing wrong with them and no reason for them to be so under-utilized."

pokemon,3dxnk8,_Aurora_,11,Mon Jul 20 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how it would play out, or if it would even be tenable, but maybe reform the way gym leaders and elite four members make their teams  I would be open to the idea that gym leaders could instead have teams of local wild Pokemon. I find that any player's team is varied enough in type to challenge any one-type leader right from the off, so maybe that could bring some life into it  I would like the elite four members to have teams also based on different things. Maybe a fossil one, or a team associated with desert Pokemon, maybe seasons or weather? I know it would be hard to do and a lot of them would have similar types in their teams anyway, but it is something different  EDIT: maybe teams based on abilities, whether it is the same second effect or all have the same ability"
pokemon,3dxnk8,BebesPC,3,Mon Jul 20 12:44:34 2015 UTC,"This would also be a nice twist I agree. I myself prefer playing mono - type,  which keeps certain gyms very challenging, but my last playthrough I introduced the idea of having one 'Bug-like' slot in any Bug team I fielded -- Magcargo, Goodra (slug), some of the Water crustaceans etc. It was fun and really helped balance my teams; even a small something like that could give Gym leaders a new edge.  I have to say it would be really nice under the current system to see unprecedented  types gain an Elite Four splotlight though."
pokemon,3dxnk8,BebesPC,3,Mon Jul 20 13:54:02 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I mean I still find it strange how electric in particular doesn't have an elite four member yet  One thing I've additionally considered it maybe 'clash' types. For example, one could have a 'fire and ice' team, normal and ghost, electric and water for example"
pokemon,3dxnk8,calgil,8,Mon Jul 20 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"And yet Electric is so common as a gym! Always the bridesmaid, never the bride...  Clashing types could be very interesting. You could have a very tricky Ghost/Normal gym if they introduced either a Ghost or Normal type (or both!) full field attack a la Surf, and had it as a double battle. You could even get the move as a TM reward."
pokemon,3dxnk8,queenie504,7,Mon Jul 20 14:03:25 2015 UTC,"i think in terms of the actual number of species, ice (including forms and megas) is one of the least represented. i'd like to see some more fire types, too. to get both, we'd probably have to go to a region with a volatile climate or just throw in a stark mountain or shoal cave equivalent somewhere.  more than that, though, i want to see type combos we haven't seen before, like electric/poison, ice/fire (maybe a man-made pokémon whose body is unstable and shifts between solid ice and fiery gas), maybe normal/ghost (three immunities could be interesting), etc.  also, a couple more fairies that aren't grossly pink or reminiscent of food. things like granbull, mawile, and gardevoir. they should be able to evolve without items.  rock, flying, and fighting eeveelution trio.   I would love to see Rock be weilded by a tougher leader.   i agree. anything higher than the second gym would be fine. ramos was number 4 in kalos, and grass has the same amount of weaknesses as rock has (5), is resisted by more types than rock is (7 vs. rock's 3), and is strong against less types than rock is (3 vs. rock's 4). to me, that shows that rock could easily be a mid-tier gym, especially if they let the leader use secondary rock types for coverage and diversity."
pokemon,3dxnk8,_Aurora_,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"Speaking of ice and fire..  I'd like a lot more ""balance"" legends - called this because they're a balance of polar opposites. Fire/Ice type, Grass/Fire type, Normal/Ghost type, Ice/Steel type, to add to Pokemon like Volcanion, Heatran, Hoopa-U, Landorus, and even stuff like Mega Altaria the fairy dragon."
pokemon,3dxnk8,queenie504,11,Mon Jul 20 21:06:34 2015 UTC,Either Dark or Poison. 6 generations in and NO Dark type gym! I would also like to see a poison type legendary.
pokemon,3dxnk8,_Aurora_,4,Mon Jul 20 13:48:40 2015 UTC,It would be nice if Poison got upgraded to Elite Four after a couple of gyms.

Maybe just the Four for a real challenge?

Also it's new and shiny so I don't see why not.   A Dark Gym Leader is something that I want pretty badly as well. I know that Dark translates to Evil type in Japanese so I'd be willing to accept that the gym leader was a big part of whatever the main bad group was. Like Giovanni. I loved the twist with Malva, so I'd love that on a bigger scale again.  I also think a flying E4 Member could actually be done rather well if they picked more unique flying types other than JUST generic bird. Altaria/Skarmory/Gliscor/Yanmega are good examples. But Flying is my favorite type so to see it done well would make me pleased as punch. Plus I think their room could look awesome. There is something so whimsical about Flying types and I would love to see a E4 member built around this idea.   Finally just better ice types. Better ice types everywhere."

pokemon,3dyo1x,Mockturne,6,Mon Jul 20 17:24:31 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend this to anyone, but here's what I did for the toughness contest:   Krabby Yellow Scarf Crabhammer Thief Rock Slide Ice Beam   You'll want to max out the stats thanks to them never getting full and use the scarf.  Those two together will put you slightly ahead of Lisia and therefore first in the first appeal round, but you won't be staying there for long.  This whole strategy revolves around stealing and hindering your opponents instead of actually trying to win.  Your win will come from your lead in the appeal.  Lead with crabhammer to get some decent points.  More than likely, Lisia is setting up for her mega evolution, which will happen.  You want it to happen.  You'll wind up near the back in the second round.  Now it's all about rock slide and thief.  Rock slide will take way from everyone who's performed.  Your real money is in thief, which takes the points that the pokemon in front of you just made.  No doubt someome is setting up for a 2-turn move like solar beam, so be sure to thief them if you can.  Crabhammer doesn't bore the audience and has a decent gain.  Lisia WILL mega evolve at some point.  You've seen it before.  It's inevitable, so embrace it.  That's when you unleash thief for the win.  Get the same amount of points.  You can usually see it coming a turn away, so rotate it wisely.  Ice beam comes as a clincher.  It's a devastating to whomever is in front move, and the judges hate it because this is a toughness contest, not a beauty one.  Use it to screw someone with hearts in front of you and screw the person behind you from filling up the judges hearts.  It might look like you've tied or even lost to Lisia, but your curve in the appeal will get you your win.  If Lisia didn't mega evolve for some reason, or it looks like she won't, focus on screwing everyone over with ice beam and rock slide.  You aren't necessarily aiming for the most points, but you want to drag everyone down so your appeal gets you the win.  You want them to hate these contests.  You want to make them feel...crabby.  I apologize for nothing.  But seriously, it worked for me."

pokemon,3dyymc,zkfleer,8,Mon Jul 20 17:51:45 2015 UTC,I stopped at Black/White because of Iris. My start watching the Japanese versiom of X/Y as I heard it had improved
pokemon,3dyymc,CrapCakes99,4,Mon Jul 20 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"XY is leagues better than Black/White. I managed to stomach up to around 80 episodes of BW before giving up, but I can say that XY is much more worth watching."
pokemon,3dyymc,KaSlaps,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:39 2015 UTC,That's good. I'll definitely have to give it a try!
pokemon,3dyymc,CrapCakes99,9,Tue Jul 21 00:04:36 2015 UTC,ITT: Iris and Cilan
pokemon,3dyymc,Brandilio,15,Mon Jul 20 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"Cilan is the worst thing ever, period."
pokemon,3dyymc,KingBubblie,7,Mon Jul 20 18:04:09 2015 UTC,"He would just meet a random person and be like. I AM A CONNOISSEUR DID YOU KNOW THAT I AM BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU BECAUSE I CAN COOK, PANSAGE TIME TO BE GLORIOUS. Really he just gave me headaches"
pokemon,3dyymc,catgotswag,6,Mon Jul 20 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"This opinion leaves a bad taste in my mouth!  No, but seriously, fuck Cilian. He's the sole reason I stopped watching BW. If your entire character is based around food references then what the fuck is the point of you being here?"
pokemon,3dyymc,benoxxxx,5,Tue Jul 21 02:34:07 2015 UTC,"I hate him so much, I wish Brock or Tracy was still on the show"
pokemon,3dyymc,hu12345u,5,Mon Jul 20 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"I thought Cilan actually wasn't that bad in the Japanese dub. His voice actor definitely portrays him way better unlike the English dub. Although, everyone currently in the English dub just flat out can't act."
pokemon,3dyymc,Kira-the-Cat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"Cilan upsets me because he was a huge waste of Sonic the Hedgehog's then voice actor, same with Looker, which is sad because you can clearly hear its Sonic talking! I'd really like Cilan more if he didn't come off so damn flamboyantly and sound exactly the same as Sonic (and Werehog!Sonic) at the same damn time. Give him a slightly different voice inflection, as it took me a while to catch on that Looker was basically Sonic the Werehog in a human body voice wise, but I caught on immediately after first hearing Cilan. And hearing them both talk in the same scenes later on is just.....weird because of the above. But yeah, Cilan had some choice Pokemon but that went down the shitter whenever he opened his mouth."
pokemon,3dyymc,GooeyGoodra11,5,Tue Jul 21 06:16:38 2015 UTC,"I personally like Iris, but Cilan..... GAAAAAAAAAAAH! NO MORE FOOD PUNS!"

pokemon,3dyymc,MintyFreshNipples,4,Tue Jul 21 04:11:00 2015 UTC,Cilan and Iris are easily the worst.

pokemon,3dyymc,supersystematiser,4,Mon Jul 20 18:08:25 2015 UTC,Iris made Cilan look good. That's how much the Gen 5 characters sucked.
pokemon,3dyymc,KaSlaps,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:00 2015 UTC,I don't know if I liked Cilan or I just really hated Iris.
pokemon,3dyymc,Marchingbandhero,3,Tue Jul 21 03:03:33 2015 UTC,I have that issue too. I thought Cilan was good but that was only in comparison to Iris because the entire BW series was ridiculously hard to watch overall.

Not even Misty's slight Flanderization, in terms of getting more mean later on, pissed me off as much as Iris did. She's just so bratty, which sucks because I love every single one of her Pokemon except Emolga because its just as much a brat as she is. She's continually nasty to Ash, even more so than Misty ever was, and is constantly putting him down on the basis of him being a little kid despite the fact that she acts exactly the way he does. Iris was unnecessarily nasty and brattish which is upsetting because again, she does get a nice selection of Pokemon, and her design is pretty unique. I also hate Tracy but pretty sure everyone does."

The problem was I did it without bank or trading from x/y, so I had to wait on the GTS to trade me what I wanted from what I thought people would want that I had (mainly starters) or wonder trade for hours to get a new one. I tried to go in dex order, so by the time I was to Gen 5, I would go for days sometimes before wonder trade would give me something new"

However, gen 6 reinvigorated my love for Pokémon because it had so many cool Pokémon I had to do 3 playthroughs just to experience all of the one I wanted.  I chose gen 6 though because it's the hardest gen to decide which is determine my favorite because I love them all and not because I don't particularly care about any of them (I'm looking at you gen 2 and 5)"

pokemon,3dvm4g,franksbank,4,Mon Jul 20 05:04:26 2015 UTC,BW and BW2 was in the US. XY and the future game (probably Z) take place in France.
pokemon,3dvm4g,pinkdratini,2,Mon Jul 20 04:51:36 2015 UTC,They had a France focused out twice. X and Y and now Z
pokemon,3dvm4g,Paradox228,25,Mon Jul 20 08:02:39 2015 UTC,"If there is both a Z-quel and a Kanto remake, they will both only be one solo game each.   FURIOUSLY CROSSES FINGERS FOR BOTH POKEMON Z AND POKEMON YELLOW REMAKE EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT WON'T HAPPEN"
pokemon,3dvm4g,Sceptile90,14,Mon Jul 20 02:17:55 2015 UTC,If they remake yellow I might die of excitement before I get to play.
pokemon,3dvm4g,Sceptile90,12,Mon Jul 20 03:37:29 2015 UTC,"I think they might make a remake of Yellow on the 25th anniversary, since Pikachu is No. 25 in the National Dex."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Mrrtrtrtrt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:46:58 2015 UTC,That would make a lot of sense. That would be well into Gen 7. Although I'm not sure what they'd do for the 20th if they're holding off Yellow for the 25th.
pokemon,3dvm4g,Mrrtrtrtrt,2,Mon Jul 20 13:34:12 2015 UTC,Possibly Pokémon Purple Version as a combination of Red and Blue? Could be a sequel set twenty years in the future and they'd have Mewtwo as the mascot.
pokemon,3dvm4g,SuperMegagon,2,Mon Jul 20 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"Twenty years? That's a long time. That'd be like, at least 10 years from when XY is predicted to take place. I think a Yellow remake would be good enough rather than making yet another completely new story. Even ORAS had a super expanded story."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Nightingail,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:07 2015 UTC,"Well, Pokemon world time are usually pretty similar. Gen 2 is 3 years after gen 1 because gold and silver came out 3 years after red and green.

The proposed ""Purple Version"" would then take place at least 10 years after XY, depending on how big the BW gap is."
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheHeadlessOne,3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:56 2015 UTC,Now I'm kind of hoping for a game that combines the two. Visit both regions in the same game. They haven't had one where the main story spanned over more than one region yet. I know they're seriously unlikely to do it but I can dream.
pokemon,3dvm4g,brownsfan125,49,Mon Jul 20 15:31:15 2015 UTC,"All of these points make for great arguments, however, I feel they should not be portrayed as facts. ""Mega evolution specials never.."" Have never. Up until now.  Things don't HAVE TO follow a set formula.  E.g., everyone was expecting a Pokemon Grey, because ""There is always a third game with more content."" Yet we got B2nW2.   They don't have to do what everyone expects them to do, for all we know they could release 2 more gens and 6 more games on the 3ds. Who knows. Anything can happen..."
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheHeadlessOne,14,Sun Jul 19 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that the patterns wouldn't break, just that that's how they were until now.

It would be weird if the special had cameos of like 20 new megas that nobody knew about beforehand.  The time period stuff (like how much time is in between games) is probably solid though. We know that Game Freak rarely ever releases 2 new games within a year, and even when they do, a year without new main series games comes before and after them, which would still average it to 1 game every year with some years skipped.  We also know that the 3DS can't last more than 7 or so years, so the next handheld's gotta come out some time around 2018, which would be perfect timing for the next Gen to come out.  So, I see your point, but realistically speaking, the next Gen is probably gonna end up on the next system."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Toolspaper,16,Sun Jul 19 23:39:36 2015 UTC,IIRC the anime doesn't actually reveal new never-before-seen Pokémon   The first episode showed Ho-Oh
pokemon,3dvm4g,Toolspaper,4,Mon Jul 20 00:21:34 2015 UTC,about 40 extra pokemon that became gen 2 pokemon were actually created in gen 1 but didnt make it into the games. fun fact Ho-oh was NOT one of them.  Theres a TamashiiHiroka video where she cites an interview with a developer.
pokemon,3dvm4g,Black_Belt_Troy,2,Mon Jul 20 05:37:01 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware actually!   It bummed me out because, had Ho-Oh been intended in gen 1, then my headcanon that Ho-Oh = MissingNo (the pokemon the 'dex can't identify) would have been closer to the truth"
pokemon,3dvm4g,Black_Belt_Troy,2,Mon Jul 20 11:44:23 2015 UTC,And togepi.
pokemon,3dvm4g,BlooburyPancakes,2,Mon Jul 20 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"I knew Togepi was announced early, I  just didnt trust myself to  assume it was pre G/S's announcement. 'Twas a long time ago!"
pokemon,3dvm4g,brownsfan125,-5,Mon Jul 20 12:51:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but nobody knew what it was."
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheHeadlessOne,10,Mon Jul 20 00:27:51 2015 UTC,What
pokemon,3dvm4g,Faren107,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"Like, nobody had any idea what it even was. For all we knew, it could've been a Moltres with a crest. There was nothing saying it was Ho-Oh, no explanation of it. It was just... there. For like 2 seconds. I guess it kind of opens up people's minds to the possibility of more Pokémon outside the 151 who made it to Red and Blue, but it wasn't really officially revealed until we knew about the next games and the systems they were on."
pokemon,3dvm4g,461weavile,7,Mon Jul 20 01:19:33 2015 UTC,Pokemon now has a wider fanbase that extends to the Internet. You can't claim everything as regimented as you assume to be fact

pokemon,3dvm4g,Brackner,5,Mon Jul 20 01:36:22 2015 UTC,Wasn't your point that the anime never shows Pokemon that nobody knows what it is?
pokemon,3dvm4g,xayezi,-3,Mon Jul 20 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"The only time they did was a 2 second cameo that didn't show the actual thing, just an outline of it.

pokemon,3dvm4g,fearile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:27 2015 UTC,That's a myth. They new Pokémon could have been added in any order in the hex code.   Also togepi was revealed in the anime.
pokemon,3dvm4g,DarthMewtwo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:28:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they revealed a totally new pokemon no one knew before. Just like no one knows this green blob and theories abond"
pokemon,3dvm4g,Xattm15,10,Mon Jul 20 11:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the New 3DS came out just a year or two ago, it will probably be a while before the NX comes out, so there is a chance that a new generation will come out for the New.  Going back to your original post, what do you mean when you say there is space in the games coding for 2 more games. Do you mean there is only enough room for the current games to be able to connect to those games, or what? What is stopping them from releasing more?"
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheHeadlessOne,6,Mon Jul 20 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"The ""number of games"" has to do with migrating your Pokemon. Part of the games' code includes 6 separate IDs which indicate that a Pokemon is from that generation. Before ORAS, nobody knew what the IDs meant really, but after a bit of experimenting, 4 of them were determined to be for X, Y, OR, and AS. The last two aren't from any of the 20 [compatible] games we have already.  (BONUS:) If you evolve a migrated Eevee to get a Sylveon for your Pokedex, the game doesn't check to see if it was from Gen VI since you can't have a Sylveon in any previous game"
pokemon,3dvm4g,461weavile,6,Mon Jul 20 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"The 3DS came out around 2 years after the DSi, so a 2017 handheld wouldn't be too Farfetch'd.  I think the 2 games thing came from a Pokébank datamine. Like, it can only support 2 more games. They might patch it though."
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheHeadlessOne,7,Mon Jul 20 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"However, the New 3DS came out just recently, unlike the 3DS  Yeah, it's not exactly a full upgrade, but we still had two generations on the DS, which was broken up into DS/Lite and DSi, so we could have a case of Gen VI and Gen VII both being 3DS gens, maybe with Gen VII using some features exclusive to the New 3DS"
pokemon,3dvm4g,461weavile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:20 2015 UTC,"I guess that could happen. The only problem I have with that is the fact that Gen 5 changed so much graphics-wise to set it apart from Gen 4, but there's not much left to do on the 3DS except make 3D available everywhere."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Toolspaper,9,Mon Jul 20 02:15:21 2015 UTC,"Improve the engine to have better FPS in all battles, increase number of animations for Pokemon, increase detail/try different styles for overworld, use the c stick on the New 3DS to allow us to change the camera angle to spot easter eggs, hidden items, etc., FIX MANY PROBLEM SHINY COLOURS (Seriously Gamefreak we do not care THAT much about consistency we'd rather have shinies that are great looking), add various effects to Pokemon (e.g. Gengar is made to have a whispy effect around it)..."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Toolspaper,4,Mon Jul 20 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"I think that if they make the games look too realistic, it'll start to lose its charm. Changing angle is a great idea, and maybe could finally be a use for the LR buttons.  TYPHLOSION ACTUALLY HAVING FIRE NORMALLY WOULD BE NICE! EMBOAR HAS IT, BLAZIKEN HAS IT, I'D LIKE SOMETHING OTHER THAN A SLIGHTLY MISCOLORED HONEY BADGER PLEASE."
pokemon,3dvm4g,461weavile,6,Mon Jul 20 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"L does have a use, at least in some games - You can make it do the same as A, which lets you one hand the game for a lot of parts"
pokemon,3dvm4g,461weavile,3,Mon Jul 20 02:42:31 2015 UTC,SO THAT'S WHY THAT FEATURE IS INCLUDED! I've always wondered why they included a way to make L=A.

pokemon,3dvm4g,Jadonson,16,Mon Jul 20 10:29:45 2015 UTC,"This means there will be a new Kalos game (or multiple games)   this is a pretty big assumption from your first point.We live in a day of digital patches-which Pokemon begrudgingly employed but has been employing more thoroughly lately. It is entirely reasonable that they would release a Zygarde form without a game   I mean I see Z as very likely, and your assumption here as reasonable, but not a 'fact'   Space exists in the games' coding for two more Generation 6 games. This means 2 individual games, not 2 pairs.   Care to elaborate on this? I didnt hear about that   Nintendo has never released two home consoles without a handheld in between, meaning the NX will most likely be a handheld.   The N3DS to the 3DS is very similar to the GBC to the GB, it could be considered a 'new' handheld  Still, interesting points and perspective!"
pokemon,3dvm4g,a_c_31,6,Mon Jul 20 00:19:45 2015 UTC,"I think I can help with the other possible Gen VI games. Nothing is confirmed, but GameFreak and PokeCo have given themselves some leeway without giving away very much"
pokemon,3dvm4g,cyberine,2,Mon Jul 20 02:27:06 2015 UTC,"thanks for the info! I do think that the 'third version' is somethng they seriously consider in development, so I'd agree this is some very interesting evidence"
pokemon,3dvm4g,BigG1392,2,Mon Jul 20 11:42:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm super excited for what they're working on. Honestly, with how much time they've spent on this generation (and how little truly new content was in X and Y), I can't wait for whatever they're planning for us"
pokemon,3dvm4g,businesstravis,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think the N3DS is more like a DSi. It has a couple exclusives, but is mostly just an enhanced 3DS.  They also said they don't want there to be DLC. They didn't patch XY with the new Megas, so it would be weird to just put in a new form for Zygarde."
pokemon,3dvm4g,MDRox99,5,Mon Jul 20 00:29:58 2015 UTC,"If the DS and DSi are grouped together, the games released were:    Diamond/Pearl Platinum HeartGold/SoulSilver Black/White Black 2/White 2"
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheZett,-3,Mon Jul 20 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"The DSi actually had no exclusive Pokémon games. They had like 3 not-very-well-known AR games and some DSiWare, but no Pokémon games. Gen 5 had some DSi-exclusive features, though."
pokemon,3dvm4g,crawlspace_taste,4,Mon Jul 20 01:28:31 2015 UTC,That's not the point I'm trying to make. I'm just saying that by saying the N3DS is like the DSi isn't valid as you seem to just be dismissing the possibility that it's release extended the group of games released for it
pokemon,3dvm4g,dcjboi,-3,Mon Jul 20 01:38:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry. I guess there could be games released for it. Although it doesn't seem like there will be many games for it, all I've seen is 10-ish games within the next year. I'm not sure about the devs being okay with basically forcing people to get a new system after 3 years, since they seem to want Pokémon to be more accessible to people.  Will there be features in the next games exclusive to the N3DS? Probably yes.  Will there be games exclusive to the N3DS? Probably not."
pokemon,3dvm4g,VoidFog,4,Mon Jul 20 01:46:47 2015 UTC,Umm... there already are games exclusive to the New3DS.  ...Unless you meant to say Pokemon games

Admittedly the GBC had more exclusives (mostly a lifetime thing, it was much more readily adopted compared to DSi and N3DS because color was a big deal) but through its life most of the games also came out on Gameboy classic.   The jump between GBC and GBA was much muhc much bigger than GB and GBC. GBA to DS was much bigger. DS to 3DS was much bigger. GBC was the original half-generation handheld"
pokemon,3dvm4g,Disgruntled__Goat,2,Mon Jul 20 11:39:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't the NX their new home console, though? Wasn't the whole point that the Wii-U is still running last-gen hardware and nobody is buying it up? They literally just made the N3DS, which has higher capabilities and therefore runs different games. They're not going to suddenly shove out ANOTHER handheld. They want some of the Home console money they got with the original Wii."

pokemon,3dvm4g,Icalasari,4,Mon Jul 20 11:18:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's very obvious that the ""Z-quel"" exists, and I think there's a very good chance that the Z-quel ties in both Kalos and Hoenn. There's never been a remake (FRLG, HGSS) that's had it's story as drastically altered as ORAS. I think there's a chance this ""new pokemon"" could be some sort of link between Zygarde (Kalos) and Rayquaza (Hoenn). The fact that this Pokemon is Emerald colored (also of note, so is Zygarde) gives the idea at least a slight chance of being possible. Not to mention, various NPCs in ORAS mention being able to travel to Kalos, and the Battle Frontier isn't ready yet (implying that it is coming - why else even acknowledge it?).   As far as the second game slot goes, given the 20th anniversary, I think it's super plausible that we may very well get a Kanto game in the same vein as ORAS. This game could tie in the events in Pokemon Origin related to Mr. Fuji and Mega Evolution, and perhaps even integrate Mewtwo's origin and subsequent Mega Evolutions into the main plot.  All speculation, but I do think the game coming next isn't exactly what we're expecting it to be."
pokemon,3dvm4g,FrannyC,7,Mon Jul 20 11:38:56 2015 UTC,(which I like to call the Z-quel).   This is confusing if you're Canadian or British.
pokemon,3dvm4g,PintSizedPinata,0,Mon Jul 20 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"Which is probably why they wont make Z, like how they didn't make Grey/Gray"
pokemon,3dvm4g,a_c_31,6,Mon Jul 20 07:29:14 2015 UTC,"Because this stopped Dragonball Z from being called DBZ, right?"
pokemon,3dvm4g,a_c_31,3,Mon Jul 20 10:26:03 2015 UTC,Should we rule out the idea of an updated downloadable Kanto port of an older generation of game? This would allow for The Z-quel(s) to exist with the current Bank gen 6 game limit of two and an anniversary game. The Kanto port could then send Pokemon and items back to other gen 6 games via the Pokemon link much like the Oras demo did.
pokemon,3dvm4g,Gotxiko,3,Mon Jul 20 03:41:47 2015 UTC,"Technically, Munchlax was playable on Gamecube's XD Gale Of Darkness before the DS release."

This remake might happen because it is the 20th anniversary and because that region is unplayable on the current system. Also my prediction for the NX is that it is a console like the wii U but the game pad would be a handheld too!"
pokemon,3dvm4g,genericthrowaway333,3,Mon Jul 20 11:56:11 2015 UTC,"So far we've had:  A tropical region (Hoenn)  A traditional region (Johto)  A ""large town"" region (Kanto)  A more modern ""big city"" region (Unova)  A temperate/cold region (Sinnoh)  And a more...err, beauty-oriented region (Kalos).  Considering the Hoopa movie, it would be interesting to see one that is set in the desert."
pokemon,3dvm4g,KDW3,2,Mon Jul 20 12:44:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe a more rural region? Johto had MooMoo Farms, but that's about it.  EDIT: Urban is very different from rural..."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Toasterfire,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:04 2015 UTC,"Ummm, I think you mean rural.  I think that would be amazing though, I'd love to imagine a whole cowboys/wild west kind of vibe with trainers riding their Rapidashes, wrangling in Tauros and Miltanks while their Growlithes herd Mareep.  With long, open routes with trading posts and watering holes dividing them.  This might even work with a desert theme, or even Latin American switching out the cowboys with gauchos.  Hordes of pokemon would even make more sense (in my mind at least), as these herds of wild Pokes run into you as they migrate the long distances from watering hole to watering hole."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Degwimpengwin,7,Tue Jul 21 05:41:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of these seem more like coincidences rather than actual rules that Nintendo is obligated to follow. Things that have just accidentally happened. For instance, the first next gen pokemon being revealed the year their system came out at the earliest. I doubt that there's an actual written rule hung anywhere in the headquarters of Nintendo saying this. I'll agree its likely, but I'm just trying to point out some of these things seem like coincidences rather than actual written rules.  With that aside, I actually think most of these hypothesis are spot on. There are a few games that I want to be made with at least one of the two remaining spots: An XD/Colosseum continuation or remake (not going to happen, it's been too long), an emerald remake (also not going to happen as we already have the delta episode), and a Kanto remake. I think a Kanto remake and a Z-quel (as you put it) are the most likely. If there is not a Kanto remake in this generation then it will most likely be in the next generation. I'd be surprised if there wasn't one in either.  I actually have two other theories that I'd like to add to yours, mostly centered around the strange souvenir, although both can be dispelled easily by just assuming that it won't be relevant until gen 7.   The first theory is that Nintendo could try to catch us off guard by using the last two games to introduce an entirely new pair of games, with a new region (but not necessarily new pokemon), it would be the opposite to Kalos in that it would be whatever region they opposed in the war 3 thousand years ago (in the games). I'd hypothesize that this region would probably be based on England (given their long struggles with France) and perhaps a town based on London would sit opposite to that of Lumiose. The strange Souvenir could be based on whatever pokemon form here and it wouldn't be any of the known regions. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to assume that Zygarde holds dominion here as it would be relatively close to Kalos, and I doubt that Legendary pokemon know any borders.  This second theory is to be honest more like wishful thinking. According to the background text regarding Hoopa in X and Y, it states that Hoopa hides it's horde in the desert, and even transports an organization to the desert. There is one region that is for the most part, entirely a desert... The Orre region from Colosseum and XD: Gale of darkness. This may even explain Hoopas cover pokemon level stats and it would be a region outside of the ones we know for the strange souvenir. The next two games would be a continuation of the Orre series, and Pokemon Z, with a Kanto remake coming in the next generation. That's about all I have to say on that. To be honest it is pretty much just wishful thinking so I don't put much stock into this theory. I really only think that Hoopa will be an event legendary, and not much more.   To be honest even with my two theories my bet still goes to a Z-quel, and a Kanto remake. These are just alternative thoughts."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Tropiux,3,Mon Jul 20 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely hope that the next games will reveal more about Hoopa, Diancie and the yet to be released Volcanion. The hints about how Hoopa was unbound during ORAS yet sealed away in XY intrigues me, as does its treasure base in the desert, but I get the feeling that game freak will choose to leave that unanswered like they did with mew :'(  As for your first idea, how about this? The games are set in Southern Kalos which used to be the other kingdom that Kalos fought against and defeated 3000 years ago. Then during the post game you can travel to the original Kalos of XY like in GS-HGSS"
pokemon,3dvm4g,rapedbyasicksonicfan,12,Mon Jul 20 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, some incredible stretches in there. And several incorrect facts.   A new Zygarde form exists   Not a fact. We don't know yet.   Space exists in the games' coding for two more Generation 6 games. This means 2 individual games, not 2 pairs.   It means up to two games. That's zero, one or two.   Nintendo has never released two home consoles without a handheld in between, meaning the NX will most likely be a handheld.   Actually it's much more likely at the moment that it's some kind of hybrid system.   The first next-gen Pokémon are officially revealed in the year their systems come out at the earliest. ... Gen 5 and 6 took longer to come out, but were still revealed during their respective systems' lifespans.   This whole point makes no sense. The first sentence is patently false since the 3DS was released in 2011 and Gen 6 wasn't even revealed until 2013. The last sentence is a complete non-sequitur - of course a 3DS game was revealed during the 3DS' lifetime!   This makes Kanto the only region unplayable on the current system, not counting HGSS.   So apart from the exceptions, X is true! Great logic.   Z-quel   Heh, I keep reading this as ""zed quel"".   There are 2 more Gen 6 games. This could mean either a pair or 2 standalone games.   False conclusion as explained above.   Gen 7 ... the region will be based off a place far from France. It can't be South Kalos, because that's still Kalos, and it can't be nearby.   Where the heck did this come from? I don't see how that's based on any of the ""facts"" you posted.    TL;DR there are no patterns in Pokemon, the next games will be whatever GF decide is interesting or fun."

pokemon,3dvm4g,guitarerdood,7,Mon Jul 20 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"Not a fact. We don't know yet.   It was in the trailer for the next movie.

Actually it's much more likely at the moment that it's some kind of hybrid system.   Again, good point. I actually think it'll be a hybrid, and if it is, it would probably still have Pokémon on it, as long as at least part of it is portable.   This whole point makes no sense.

The last sentence is a complete non-sequitur - of course a 3DS game was revealed during the 3DS' lifetime!   I don't know how to words. What I meant was, when those Pokémon were revealed, we already knew about the systems the games would be on. We don't know about the NX yet, so the Pokémon probably won't be officially revealed until we at least know what system the next Gen will be on.   So apart from the exceptions, X is true! Great logic.   Again, bad phrasing. I meant there weren't any games based around Kanto. Like, play as Red and fight Giovanni. I thought if I just said ""Kanto games"" people would think I meant exploring Kanto in general and point out HGSS.   Where the heck did this come from? I don't see how that's based on any of the ""facts"" you posted.   The item description for the Strange Souvenir says it's from a region far away from Kalos, and the guy who gives it to you says it's not from any of the current regions."

We don't know about the NX yet, so the Pokémon probably won't be officially revealed until we at least know what system the next Gen will be on.   This doesn't mean anything. As he said, of course they'd reveal the games when the console was out, that means next to nothing, especially since nobody has any idea what the NX is yet.    I thought if I just said ""Kanto games"" people would think I meant exploring Kanto in general and point out HGSS.   His point still stands. You can capture any Pokemon in HG/SS Kanto that you could in regular Kanto, even Mewtwo and the bird trio, so your point is moot.   The item description for the Strange Souvenir says it's from a region far away from Kalos, and the guy who gives it to you says it's not from any of the current regions.   There was a woman NPC who mentions her own home region in the game and her description also doesn't sound like any of the other regions we've been to. It could mean something, but it's not like it outright states it."
pokemon,3dvm4g,FyreFlu,0,Mon Jul 20 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"This doesn't mean anything. As he said, of course they'd reveal the games when the console was out, that means next to nothing, especially since nobody has any idea what the NX is yet.   What I'm saying is they won't reveal any new Pokémon at least until the NX is actually revealed. If it's a handheld or hybrid which can be portable,  then there'll be Pokémon on it, and they'll reveal the next games. But until then, we won't find out what the blob actually is if it's a Gen 7 Pokémon.   His point still stands. You can capture any Pokemon in HG/SS Kanto that you could in regular Kanto, even Mewtwo and the bird trio, so your point is moot.   Yeah, but you can't actually play through the ""original"" plot. It's GSC's plot with a slightly edited map and different encounters and Trainers. You don't play as Red and fight blue as the Champion and stuff."
pokemon,3dvm4g,FyreFlu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:56 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is they won't reveal any new Pokémon at least until the NX is actually revealed.    Okay, but you don't know that is what we are saying. You're stating this as though it's fact when you know as much as the rest of us. For all we know Volcanion may never even be revealed in Gen VI, the only reason anybody knows about it is through hacking, which is the same way everybody learned about AZ's Floette. Haven't gotten an even for THAT either.   Yeah, but you can't actually play through the ""original"" plot. It's GSC's plot with a slightly edited map and different encounters and Trainers. You don't play as Red and fight blue as the Champion and stuff.   Which means absolutely nothing. You can still capture all of the previous Pokemon. GF didn't remake Kanto for the story, they did it more so that players would be able to obtain Pokemon from them. While it is a pain in the ass to do, it's still possible to trade up Pokemon from Gen III to Gen VI."
pokemon,3dvm4g,AlfieCoates,0,Mon Jul 20 02:14:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, but you don't know that is what we are saying. You're stating this as though it's fact when you know as much as the rest of us.   Right, it's kind of assuming the Gen 7 will be released on the NX when it might not. They might pull a Gen 5 on us again and put it on the 3DS with only a couple games.   For all we know Volcanion may never even be revealed in Gen VI, the only reason anybody knows about it is through hacking, which is the same way everybody learned about AZ's Floette. Haven't gotten an even for THAT either.   We probably will see Volcanion though, maybe in movie 20. and AZ's Floette might be in the Z-quel. I don't think they've had any Pokémon/forms in the code before that went completely unused, besides the mess that was Gen 1's 39 scrapped Pokémon. Especially since they programmed in the moves and stuff, and AZ's Floette would kinda be obsolete plot-wise in Gen 7.  The whole Kanto stuff was just wishful thinking, though. They probably won't remake them, but it would be cool. I was kinda annoyed at my phrasing leading to confusion and stuff though."
pokemon,3dvm4g,FyreFlu,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:45 2015 UTC,People have to remember that X/Y was released worldwide on the same day. There's a good chance they may have just left some stuff in the coding they didn't have time to totally remove. The average person won't ever see these Pokemon because you need to actually search through the code and hack them in to do so.
pokemon,3dvm4g,xsamy,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"If Volcanion was just a leftover in XY, why did they give it Tutor moves in ORAS? I'm not sure about AZ's Floette though, maybe it'll appear in Z?"

But they've already revealed 2 new Pokemon/forms. So your conclusion should be that the next games will be 3DS (which is quite likely anyway, since we'll surely have a Pokemon game in 2016 and the NX won't be released until late 2016).   Yeah, but you can't actually play through the ""original"" plot.   This is true, but I don't see that it matters. I don't see them doing a Kanto remake, at least not in 3D. I wouldn't rule out some kind of rerelease of FR/LG on virtual console."
pokemon,3dvm4g,2chainzrules24,0,Mon Jul 20 10:49:26 2015 UTC,"To add to the games argument - There could also be four games, ten games, etc. - They can patch games, and even if they don't... So what if XY doesn't give them hexagons? By that point, XY AND OrAs will be obsolete for tournaments so it doesn't matter if Hexagons display on them or not"
pokemon,3dvm4g,Brackner,3,Mon Jul 20 02:10:20 2015 UTC,I think by hexagons he means like the ones that appear on zygarde

pokemon,3dvm4g,theman102,2,Mon Jul 20 02:45:43 2015 UTC,"I'd be really excited to see what a ""South Kalos"" would bring about. This ""new"" pokemon that's been getting talked about in the last couple days (see http://www.serebii.net/ if you still haven't heard yet) gives me the hunch that there will be new pokemon in the next game that comes out. Is it gen 7, is it South Kalos? I'm not sure, but it seems to me like something new and exciting is on the horizon!"
pokemon,3dvm4g,theman102,0,Mon Jul 20 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"I think the Z-quel is gonna have South Kalos, and Gen 7 will be a completely new region."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Porygon24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"So do you think we'd get a new pokedex for South Kalos? I sure do. If you think about it, there's only 71 Kalos pokemon so far, much less than we got in past generations (Kanto 151, Johto 100, Hoenn 135, Sinnoh 108, Unova 154). It makes sense to me that we may see 60-70 more new pokes. Hopefully this would bring about new gen 6 starters and mega stones for all six gen 6 starters!"
pokemon,3dvm4g,Lukethehedgehog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:37:26 2015 UTC,"Well, the Kalos pokedex is split up in coast, middle and mountain. They could add a south category with 30 new pokemon in the X2/Y2/Z-quel"
pokemon,3dvm4g,Serbaayuu,0,Mon Jul 20 10:49:03 2015 UTC,"There's gonna be 72 total Kalos Mons. They kept the roster short this time because of time constraints. Plus, if you count all the Megas/Primals, there's already 122.  (Also Sinnoh had 107 and Unova had 156)"
pokemon,3dvm4g,johnny_fap_fap,3,Mon Jul 20 02:39:55 2015 UTC,Then what would we get besides new gyms?
pokemon,3dvm4g,me131211,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:59:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe new megas? That and new forms of Zygarde, sort of like a B2/W2 kinda deal. Maybe we could get something like the PWT though, which would be cool."
pokemon,3dvm4g,jairom,0,Mon Jul 20 06:22:02 2015 UTC,"More places to explore, more plot, and new gyms as you said. Doubling the region size will probably be enough."
pokemon,3dvm4g,Gotxiko,2,Mon Jul 20 03:02:32 2015 UTC,I think they should do a Gold/Silver type game. 1st we go through the new region gyms and plot. Then go over to the main Kalos region and battle those gyms as well.
pokemon,3dvm4g,ShockerG52,2,Mon Jul 20 05:51:05 2015 UTC,Has the mega evo special with the two hoenn mascots been released in English yet out of interest?

pokemon,3dvm4g,tht1kd,2,Mon Jul 20 10:48:02 2015 UTC,"There are 2 more Gen 6  games.    Not necessarily. The 5th Gen also had coding for 6 games in that generation, but only 4 were used. So 6 is more of a maximum than a minimum."
pokemon,3dvm4g,PintSizedPinata,2,Mon Jul 20 12:21:31 2015 UTC,"Southern Kalos, so maybe a Spain-based region? Or at least part of Spain."
pokemon,3dvm4g,DigRatChild,2,Mon Jul 20 12:32:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly doubt we'll see a Kanto remake anytime soon. Why would they break the pattern they have going and not remake 4th gen? I'm guessing we'll see a pokemon ""Z"" next fall with another remake the year after that."
pokemon,3dvm4g,camrec12,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:44 2015 UTC,"They'll remake Gen 4 when its tech gets outdated enough, like on the next system. They didn't do Hoenn remakes in Gen 5 for the same reason. FRLG, however, is really outdated."
pokemon,3dvm4g,camrec12,2,Mon Jul 20 12:52:17 2015 UTC,Oh my god the hype for a Pokemon Yellow remake is real in my mind
pokemon,3dvm4g,BearticBeast,2,Mon Jul 20 13:07:28 2015 UTC,"A Yellow remake would be awesome, especially now since they know all the Gym Leader's anime teams and other events in the anime. Blue can have an Electivire in the post-game and his team can match his anime team. We can have Orange Islands in the postgame!"

pokemon,3dvm4g,henne-n,2,Mon Jul 20 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I actually kind of want to see a Pokemon Yellow remake, but one greatly scaled down from a normal game so it doesn't take as many resources or cost as much. Maybe just add the Orange Islands and new Pokemon, a bit of a graphical face-lift, but little else."
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheZett,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"I think that would be good enough. Johto Pokémon were in the Orange Islands anyway, so it would make sense. Maybe there could be a cameo from Alain?"
pokemon,3dvm4g,TheZett,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything here apart from the the one about the NX (which I may still be wrong about). It has been confirmed that AMD are going to be the ones creating the NX's APU, which is stated to be a change from the (long running?) tradition of home Nintendo consoles running on PowerPC CPUs. This means that IIRC that Nintendo say that the NX will run on AMD hardware rather than PowerPC (which again IIRC is exclusive to the home consoles, not handheld). To reinstate, if the APU in the NX is REPLACING the hardware in past HOME CONSOLES, then so is the rest of the system, most likely making it a home console. There are probably many flaws in this theory so please point them out if you can. I also apologise for the terrible grammar, it was just a quick thought and I am massively tired."
pokemon,3dvm4g,bwburke94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.

pokemon,3dvo72,_Aurora_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"Not really, Liberty victini can't can't have V-create, so it's semi-legit?"
pokemon,3dvo72,Kkalox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:12 2015 UTC,"correct. I have one and it can't be traded over gts, so there is that"
pokemon,3dvo72,Reubuxx-Inc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:59:04 2015 UTC,Well... it's not a Liberty Victini but a normal one that got de-ribboned? I'm still confused about how I ended up making that trade: extra Celebi for a Victini.
pokemon,3dvo72,_Aurora_,6,Tue Jul 21 10:36:11 2015 UTC,At least it's somewhat fair. Legend for a Legends. Unlike those other punks asking for a Mew in exchange for a Pidgey.

pokemon,3dvo72,Kkalox,4,Mon Jul 20 07:58:45 2015 UTC,"That's why you go on trading sub-reddits and try to trade there, unless Nintendo realises that the GTS needs a filter."
pokemon,3dvo72,LukeArio,3,Mon Jul 20 07:48:33 2015 UTC,"You can filter it, can't you? By selecting whether you want special Pokemon to be shown."
pokemon,3dvo72,Kkalox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:10:10 2015 UTC,"Not the filter that I had in-mind. More like a filter that removes retarded deposits, like a ziggzagoon for Hoopa etc. EDIT: Imo, it will discourage kiddies that ask for these things and deposit normal offers, If you use the in-game filter you will only find up to 6 offers of the pokemon you are looking for in my experience."
pokemon,3dvo72,sawada91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:48:27 2015 UTC,Kids will still offer a lv 1 zigzagoon for a lv 100 charizard
pokemon,3dvo72,_Aurora_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:44:46 2015 UTC,"I did this: except the Charizard was shiny and had really good IVs. The ""Zigzagoon"" was actually a level 100 Extreme-Killer Linoone."

pokemon,3dty9u,Mage_Dragon,33,Sun Jul 19 14:33:16 2015 UTC,care to elaborate?
pokemon,3dty9u,JCVols,175,Sun Jul 19 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"Gilgamesh is an ancient myth and legend. Basically he is a demi-god that became king and got a massive boner for having everything. However, what I believe yumirose is referencing is the Gilgamesh seen in Fate/Zero and Fate/StayNight. They are mangas visual novels and anime (as well as video games) that focus on a magical battle royal between heroes of myth and legend for the Holy Grail. Gilgamesh is one of the heroes, and he has the ability to open up gates to access his vast collection, which he uses to launch weapons and shit out of, like so. If you enjoy epic fight scenes and a little darkness in the main character, then Fate/Zero is an amazing anime to watch."
pokemon,3dty9u,omruler13,62,Sun Jul 19 18:51:43 2015 UTC,also hoopa unbound is basically gilgamesh from final fantasy.
pokemon,3dty9u,dialgalucario,15,Sun Jul 19 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Never played Final Fantasy but just checked him out, and ya, he is really similar to Hoopa Unbound."
pokemon,3dty9u,omruler13,13,Sun Jul 19 19:02:15 2015 UTC,thank you I was having a hard time figuring out how the epic of gilgamesh melded with hoopa.

pokemon,3dty9u,IamWilcox,8,Sun Jul 19 21:06:52 2015 UTC,Except Hoopa launches Legendary Pokemon instead of just weapons.

pokemon,3dty9u,Nexyna,7,Sun Jul 19 22:56:54 2015 UTC,"The Epic of Gilgamesh was one of the very first legends to be written and passed down. It's a great story, with lots of appearances in fantasy works."

pokemon,3dty9u,abutthole,3,Mon Jul 20 05:09:37 2015 UTC,"... Start with Fate/Zero, build the story and really unleash the epic battle scenes in Fate/StayNight - Unlimited Blade Works. Great break down and recommendation /u/omruler13.  For those headed off to watch this awesome series: /Zero /StayNight (movie) and /StayNight UBW are all on Hulu/Crunchyroll."
pokemon,3dty9u,OhNoah,2,Sun Jul 19 23:22:35 2015 UTC,"Would also like to say that although Fate/Zero is the prequel to Fate/Stay Night (even though ufotable remastered it), they are very different genres to them. Zero is a much more gritty, anti-hero-esque anime that has insane battles and drama. Stay Night features the same great battles, but is much lighter in tone, and follows the main characters in more of a slice-of-life style anime."
pokemon,3dty9u,omruler13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:27:37 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of the older Fate/Stay Night, the new one Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works 2014/2015 (not the movie) is made by ufotable, and is much better than the deen version."
pokemon,3dty9u,Laughing_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:54:50 2015 UTC,"No I'm talking about the current Stay Night. I've only seen the newest one, and it still felt a lot less intense than Zero. I rewatched Zero before watching all of Stay Night on crunchyroll as it came out. Zero had dark characters that had a lot of past that caught up to them. Stay Night featured younger main characters that were dealing with their daily life and finding themselves in this world. It was a different message and feel than the prequel. I still loved both, but I just want to point out the differences in the two for anyone looking to get into the series.  EDIT: rereading your comment again I may have missed what you meant to say, but meh, this is still a good elaboration on the series."
pokemon,3dty9u,omruler13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:06:53 2015 UTC,IMO you should watch stay night before zero

pokemon,3dty9u,tydestra,6,Sun Jul 19 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"He was most likely referring the Gilgamesh from the Fate series. If you're interested in anime or visual novels, then you would love the historical interaction between massive legends in a battle royal. Fate/Zero is my recommendation to watch."
pokemon,3dty9u,omruler13,5,Sun Jul 19 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"Fate/Zero was a light novel, so they don't even have to like Mangos or Visual Novels."

pokemon,3dty9u,Trollkitten,27,Sun Jul 19 17:32:43 2015 UTC,If Hoopa pops up in the main games a member of said organisation needs to appear as well.
pokemon,3dty9u,spectrosoldier,17,Sun Jul 19 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"A very, VERY ticked off member of said organization.  And now I have a mental image of the gif from the Hoopa movie in which a ring opens on Team Rocket and they get mobbed by Pikachu."
pokemon,3dty9u,Trollkitten,9,Sun Jul 19 19:19:07 2015 UTC,Did anyone else think it may have been the people from Colosseum?
pokemon,3dty9u,SuperiorBigfoot,10,Sun Jul 19 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"No, the people Hoopa messed with disbanded right after being dropped in the middle of the desert, so I doubt they were Team Snagem.  I'd like to have a look in Hoopa's hideout, though. I'm fine with it keeping all its stuff, but I wanna see the collection. I'll bet it has the ultimate Pokedex."
pokemon,3dty9u,Trollkitten,8,Sun Jul 19 20:31:19 2015 UTC,Perhaps Team Snagem was a team that happened across the abandoned base?  The place didn't look too well maintained.
pokemon,3dty9u,Garlien,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:21 2015 UTC,IIRC It was destroyed in the opening scene when you run away from their base. It's been a while though.

pokemon,3dty9u,xX_BL1ND_Xx,22,Sun Jul 19 18:55:14 2015 UTC,"I thought so, but every series has had a second game, (or set with BW2), so it's pretty likely there will be something. Maybe we'll get X and Y 2: Electric Boogaloo instead or Z or whatever. The way the sequels carried on and expanded Unova was interesting anyways, but I'd prefer one game instead of 2."
pokemon,3dty9u,jugol,10,Sun Jul 19 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"That's why I said ""or whatever is called"". At least I think there will be more of Kalos, because X and Y left a somewhat ""incomplete"" vibe."
pokemon,3dty9u,xX_BL1ND_Xx,4,Sun Jul 19 19:15:22 2015 UTC,Why do you think X and Y left things incomplete? I guess there wasn't much post Elite 4 content.
pokemon,3dty9u,bothanspy1337,11,Sun Jul 19 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"It didn't really expand on its own lore.  It introduced Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde, offering very little information aside from what characters alluded to and what the Pokedex said.  You can tell from playing the game that there's a lot of information that Game Freak has on the world, but for whatever reason, it isn't actually present.  There's tons of little areas and references that look like they lead somewhere, but never do."
pokemon,3dty9u,BearticBeast,12,Sun Jul 19 22:25:17 2015 UTC,"Im with you, although I hope Z still helps expand the world.  Maybe get a plot that involves Zygarde and these other ""unseen"" legendaries. That would pretty sick! Like a bunch of classic thieves, using their powers to make the world beautiful (i.e hoopa rearranges it, or like using Hoopa to off some people). After seeing this stuff about Hoopa being devious I just really want it in the main plot!"
pokemon,3dty9u,xX_BL1ND_Xx,8,Sun Jul 19 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"Zygarde for Z would actually make far too much sense... And it wouldn't involve making another event pokemon common either, kind of like Giratina in Platinum. Your idea for the plot could be really cool. Hoopa could definitely start a really awesome plot with all this lore for it."
pokemon,3dty9u,TheShaymin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:46 2015 UTC,"Well, it COULD just make Z the sequel. I mean X and Y weren't drastically different."
pokemon,3dty9u,bothanspy1337,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"It's very likely going to be another set of games of some kind.

It could be two singular games, but I highly doubt that considering it hasn't been done before and that gen VI will probably be wrapping up by 2017 (four years of development for a completely new game is probably more than enough time)."
pokemon,3dty9u,killereggs15,2,Sun Jul 19 22:29:03 2015 UTC,"I would imagine them putting two IDs to give them the option of having two games.

pokemon,3dty9u,chrisjax23,26,Mon Jul 20 02:06:53 2015 UTC,Its most likely to be the Mirage Tower in the desert in RSE or ORAS. Either way atleast we have conformation. I do wonder who the band of villans were though?
pokemon,3dty9u,dan0314,18,Sun Jul 19 18:05:03 2015 UTC,Why? It'd be silly not to put something like that in Gen 6's introductory region
pokemon,3dty9u,BearticBeast,27,Sun Jul 19 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Hoenn has all those Hoopa rings!"
pokemon,3dty9u,Icalasari,2,Sun Jul 19 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"Hoopa's design is more Aztec styled, and resembles the weather trio of Hoenn more than the mortality trio of Kalos  It seems to just fit better if its home is in Hoenn or Orre, the gen III regions"
pokemon,3dty9u,DarthMewtwo,3,Mon Jul 20 07:35:28 2015 UTC,Wasn't the Mirage Tower only in Emerald?

pokemon,3dty9u,TyagoHexagon,26,Sun Jul 19 17:48:13 2015 UTC,It would be kinda cool as some sort of special event... or even a plot with Cipher using a Shadow Hoopa as a means to travel between dimensions.

pokemon,3dty9u,AutumnSnow,67,Mon Jul 20 03:59:37 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does anyone else want to make Hoopa evil like the guy mentioned in the image?

pokemon,3dty9u,Kate925,64,Sun Jul 19 13:02:56 2015 UTC,wouldnt surprise me if they spent the time coding this into XY when not even planning to release hoopa till ORAS...so looks like we got a BF4 Megalodon size hunt going on...want me to check the desert in oras?
pokemon,3dty9u,CrapCakes99,18,Sun Jul 19 13:22:07 2015 UTC,I agree. Unless they were hinting to a new generation 6 game which may take place around the desert...?

pokemon,3dty9u,SalomonG18,28,Sun Jul 19 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"You know what,they just might. I mean, they did just make a remake of RS, so a second gen. 6 game could plausibly take place in a previous area. I actually like that idea!"
pokemon,3dty9u,omruler13,30,Sun Jul 19 14:52:34 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Orre revisited. Especially since I never played the Colosseum games.

pokemon,3dty9u,Infinitedaw,11,Sun Jul 19 14:39:39 2015 UTC,Several power plants that couldn't be accessed.  I'm holding out in hopes that they're a hint towards Pokemon Z.

pokemon,3dty9u,461weavile,3,Sun Jul 19 18:08:38 2015 UTC,¿Could be the inverse? The city named after the mentioned desert. After all the movie was released recently (How long took producing it?) and the games were released almost 2 years ago with these lines already programmed inside.

Here it is if you're interested."
pokemon,3dy07z,ElStrawFedora,4,Mon Jul 20 14:08:39 2015 UTC,Hey I've seen your work before! That's pretty cool what you're doing. What do you plan to do with the more outlandish Pokedex entries?
pokemon,3dy07z,ElStrawFedora,5,Mon Jul 20 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"It'd be on a case by case basis. So, like if you count my entry for Aron, some situations I would consider just a wrong place at the wrong time situation. Other times, it may be something else, like a story or a protagonist mishearing things. I'll try to do more outlandish ones soon to make sense of what I mean.   Glad you like my stuff though!"
pokemon,3dy07z,jamisonglory,4,Mon Jul 20 14:25:43 2015 UTC,The Aron entry certainly gave a sense into how certain possible explanations could be concocted. Good work!
pokemon,3dy07z,NonaSuomi282,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to look at poked ex entries because some which would seem strange end up being true ( arbok in Gen 1 said it had multiple patterns) What I also like to look at is the ghost Pokémon, they actually seem to be eXtra dimensional non physical beings or portals. I like looking at that because some people theorize (with new object based Pokémon ) that a proto Pokémon (similar to a ditto type mon) would adapt and emulate things it sees in our world, so  could such a proto Pokémon actually perceive souls and other metaphysical things?!?!"
pokemon,3dz4sw,Porkymon38,4,Mon Jul 20 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"We're in gen 6 :p  If you're looking for Fairy type coverage, then try to make the 6th member of your team something that resists Fairies or try to give some your team members super effective moves.  And you're abosolutely right: I am going to suggest /r/stunfisk! Also: Smogon and/or Nuggetbridge, depending on what format you want to play, will help."
pokemon,3dz4sw,dutchjojo,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider is your team also has a huge weakness to Ice, even more so than Fairy. Actually, if you can find a way to get Defog on Piplup, I kind of want to recommend Empoleon. Empoleon being Water/Steel resists Fairy and double resists Ice plus it satisfies your ""I'm old school and need a Water type"" problem. Something like Defog/Flash Cannon/Scald/move of your choice (I'm thinking Knock Off though, but it comes down to what your team needs). Empoleon has solid Defenses and decent Sp.Atk so I think it would help your team."
pokemon,3dz4sw,aaronfaren,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:17 2015 UTC,I was actually debating on empoleon. I completely forgot it was dual typed with steel. That helps out significantly. Thank you
pokemon,3dz4sw,K7avenged,3,Tue Jul 21 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"Well, you could use a Lucario/Mega Lucario that's focused on special attack. Mine has Flash Cannon, Aura Sphere, Dark Pulse, and Nasty Plot. I'd also go with a timid nature. While Lucario will be only neutral to fairies, he'll be able to deal with them pretty easily because of Flash Cannon, and if they actually let you get off a Nasty Plot, you'll just end up sweeping the team.  You could also go with Delphox as its part psychic, can burn your enemies with will-o-wisp, and resists fairy attacks thanks to being part fire type. Plus it's special defense isn't horrible so you might be able to take a hit on that front.  Another option might be to switch out one of your dragons with a Haxorus. Give him dragon dance, teach him poison tail, and then laugh at the fairies who dare try to stand before you. Give him earthquake too for those pesky steel/fairies just in case.  At any rate, I'd lean more towards one that didn't use physical damage, as you have plenty of that already."
pokemon,3dz4sw,K7avenged,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:03 2015 UTC,Awesome. I'll take that into account. I have a lot of research to do. Thank you!

pokemon,3dzr1y,DanDelta100,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"Either a new Kalos game (Z/X2Y2/whatever) that has a metric buttload of stuff crammed in (think B2W2 multiplied), or a brand new Kanto game are what I'm thinking. I'm tempted to say possibly Gen. VII, but I don't think it's likely, even with the stuff floating around about the new movie preview."
pokemon,3dzr1y,tale-wind,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like for 2016 they're going to celebrate it by releasing the Zygarde games, hint at Generation 7, and probably continuing on the figures of Kanto Gym Leaders or w/e.  I can't really see them changing Kanto's story especially because they didn't change Hoenn's, but they should at least do a huge timeskip if we do go back to Kanto? That'd be a much better option."
pokemon,3dzr1y,Tuoko197,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I'd feel about a Red and Blue/Green re-remake or sequel honestly, but in the past three years they have done quite a lot with Kanto related things like Pokemon Origins, the new Brock statue (they're doing the other gym leaders too with the next being Misty), and plenty of factors in X and Y. When you actually think about it there are quite a number of Kanto references in X and Y.    We got the ability to choose a Kanto starter from Sycamore and they even got Mega Evolutions. We had a lot of Kanto Pokemon we could catch in the wild and even had Pikachu get a new cry with saying its name. An NPC talks about Blue (Gary) being in Kalos and saying his signature ""Smell ya later"" while also learning French. You had a Snorlax blocking a Route and it could only be woken up by a PokeFlute. We had the ability to catch the Legendary Birds depending on our starter. Mewtwo could be encounterd after beating the League and it was even found inside a cave. The battle themes for Mewtwo and the Legendary Birds were remixes of their themes from Red and Blue/Green.   So honestly I have the feeling we already have gotten our Kanto game but not the way you'd think. Anyways that aside regarding the 20th anniversary, does it necessarily have to be about Kanto? Sure it's the anniversary of the Japanese release of Red and Green, but it's also the anniversary of the franchise as a whole, so why does it need to be something related solely to Kanto? I'm not saying anything like ""Put all regions in a single game"" because we all know that's not going to happen due to lack of space on the game card, but just something to celebrate the series all together."
pokemon,3dzr1y,Dark-Scar,3,Mon Jul 20 22:04:05 2015 UTC,"Well it is the thing that started it all, I wish they do something that can be accessable to all fans and not just , ""Oh heres a 20th anniversary of Pokemon 3ds, thers only 2000 so buy quick"" ya know. I wouldn't mind if they put red and Blue on virtual console, and maybe kind of tweek it abit, add some stuff to it, Like maybe I'm probably jumping the gun here, make red and Blue have accsess to Poke Bank, or Like being able to use all the pokemon (As in Gen 1-6) as there are fan games like this, where they  modded red and Blue to include every poke. I personally think that would be so cool, and easy for them to do."
pokemon,3dzr1y,DaBest13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"I would be all over this... basically everything on the surface would look like Red/Blue, but it would include all the core newer mechanics.. ie: new Pokemon/pokebank/breeding/megaevo/wondertrade/evs,ivs ... so cosmetically and story wise we get the nostalgia but it still works with the new games.."
pokemon,3dzr1y,aaronfaren,0,Tue Jul 21 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"Gen I has different methods in calculating stats than Gen VI such as IVs only being 0-15 and EVs being able to be maxed out in every stat. If they were to make it compatible with bank, they'd have to reprogram the game some. That's not in the realm of impossibility but I don't see them doing it at all. Besides, what would be the point of R/B on VC if they were going to change it? Might as well just release a new game."
pokemon,3dzr1y,TheSlimyDog,2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it was a LOONG shot, I know Evs and Ivs were all calc differently, but there have been Red Hack where they added Gen 5 pokemon into the, Idk, i thought it would have been cool."
pokemon,3dzr1y,Dark-Scar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like a game geared more towards the older audience (come-on. if you're making a remake of a game that most people will buy for nostalgia, then make it better) of Pokemon with a different story might just do it for me."
pokemon,3dzr1y,TheSlimyDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:42:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would enjoy a more mature Pokemon game too (not too mature of course, possibly something that could almost be T rated) but they would also need to make it so it's still child friendly theme wise since the target audience of Nintendo is children. If they can find a median between the two so they can balance each other out I'm sure it would be great."
pokemon,3dzr1y,Brodellsky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:02 2015 UTC,There are great ways to make a child friendly game appeal to older people. Just looks at Pixar. I love each of those movies and I don't think anyone can argue that they're for adults. It can be pulled off but I feel like Pokemon has some of the worst possible writers sometimes.
pokemon,3dzr1y,papa_smurphy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"The reason Kanto and Red and Blue/Green matter in this sense is twofold, one it's because that's where it all started.  Two, it is the only gen that cannot be played on the 3DS.  But who knows."
pokemon,3dzr1y,domeforaklondikebar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:24 2015 UTC,I think the next games (XZ and YZ or whatever) are gonna come out then. ORAS was announced 6 months before the game came out. 6 months before February is August. Worlds is in August. It lines up perfectly for them to announce the next game at Worlds.
pokemon,3dzr1y,T-151,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"That makes alot of sense, hope it true."
pokemon,3dzr1y,papa_smurphy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:09 2015 UTC,Grasping at straws. XY was announced 9 months before it's release.
pokemon,3dzr1y,Brodellsky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:29 2015 UTC,And OrAs 6 Months before... 9-6=3 so XZ and YZ will be announced in September with a release in December...
pokemon,3dzr1y,Ducie,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:22:00 2015 UTC,Because it was a brand new generation. New gens always get more time for hype than the later games do.
pokemon,3dzr1y,Hanimetion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:02 2015 UTC,"Pokemon Yellow remake, along with Pokemon ""Z"".  There's two more games yet to come for gen 6 according to the datamine, and this has been my prediction since I heard about the two games.  I'm sticking with it, because certainly Game Freak will something for the 20th anniversary, and a Yellow remake would make 3DS hardware sell like hotcakes."

pokemon,3dzbug,FlameMammoth,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"Dig twice, and then Earthquake? Not sure how that would work...  I think giving differently typed moves would be better for coverage. Vine Whip and Mega Drain aren't good moves, either."

I suggest Thunder Bolt instead of Thunder because Thunder has low accuracy unless it's raining.  Peck?  Onix has way too many weaknesses, and really low stats outside defense. Maybe go for a more defensive, stall-y set with stuff like Substitute and Protect or Toxic?  Horn Drill has super low accuracy. Like, 30%. Earthquake would be much better here for coverage.  Stupid Gen 1 and its low selection of moves >.<"

If you happen to have a spare too, I would be eternally grateful if you could give me one! Anyways, I'm guessing you will only be in Japan in August, and that is when 7/11's will be giving out codes for Latios and Latias (from the upcoming movie). They're giving out these codes from August 1st to August 16th.  If you're going to be in Japan at the end of July, they will be giving out Ash's Pikachu and Serenas Pancham until July 31st. So, you should easily be able to obtain a few of these codes if you're looking to get them, and once again, if you have a spare, I would be extremely grateful to get one if you can. I hope you can find a partner to go with! :) Let me know if you need any other information on the codes and whereabouts to go get them!"
pokemon,3dx4pj,Zappuel_LightninRod,8,Mon Jul 20 07:00:10 2015 UTC,I love this theory. The third team could be Team Snagem if you were saying it had to do with snagging
pokemon,3dx4pj,LivingForToday16,5,Mon Jul 20 07:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'd buy this theory.  Unless Gen 7 has a tie-in with the Hoopa lore, your explaination does make some sense."
pokemon,3dx4pj,Aninymouse3,3,Mon Jul 20 07:33:55 2015 UTC,This theory is the most credible one I've heard in a long time. Do you think Gen 7 will take place on that region before the events of ORAS (which we know happens before XY) and be part of the disbandment of the organization because we help Hoopa in that next game? Mmmm... The order of the games could be this: Gen7->ORAS->XY->Possible X2/Y2
pokemon,3dx4pj,Gotxiko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:54:23 2015 UTC,"What if Hoopa summoned the meteor in the first place? Maybe Hoopa can move into multiple realities at will.

pokemon,3dv6ui,mgs4manj,21,Mon Jul 20 02:33:07 2015 UTC,If this item works by my understanding you still have to defeat him it's just once he faints he will try to use the seed and then will probably have the same dialogue as Hippowdon does here.

pokemon,3dv6ui,shadow793,57,Mon Jul 20 06:59:48 2015 UTC,"An explanation (somewhat)....  Basically, Reviver Seeds are items in the game which restore you to full health when used. Also, in the game, sometimes you find lookalike items which have very similar names (Mainly to trick you) and often have adverse effects. So apparently the Reviser seed is one such lookalike item which literally revives you, and then makes you faint again after bursting out in laughter!! xD PMD Sky is really fun!! :)"

pokemon,3dskv9,Shardwing,41,Sun Jul 19 03:22:25 2015 UTC,Butterfree had me actually laughing out loud for a good minute.
pokemon,3dskv9,Jimtehjournalist,60,Sun Jul 19 04:59:49 2015 UTC,for the lazy
pokemon,3dskv9,JJWattGotSnubbed,7,Sun Jul 19 07:31:51 2015 UTC,srsly :D does butterfree have some meaning other than this? (not native here)
pokemon,3dskv9,Myngz,11,Sun Jul 19 07:46:12 2015 UTC,"Well free makes sense because wings and feeling of being free has been associated with american culture, i guess since the song FreeBird in the 70's, probably even before. That being said, the game originated from Japan, and I have no idea if the american names were made by americans, or perhaps roughly translated from Japanese.   edit: this is total and absolute bullshit, I was just high i guess."
pokemon,3dskv9,JJWattGotSnubbed,20,Sun Jul 19 07:51:26 2015 UTC,"You may be giving it to much thought (or I may be giving it too little), but considering like 90% of all English Pokémon names are just portmanteaus (two words put together to make one word with two meanings) I always just assumed that ""Butterfree"" was just a portmanteau of ""butterfly"" because of the design, and ""free"" because it can fly around freely (after being so trapped as a Metapod)."
pokemon,3dskv9,G-Man8776,13,Sun Jul 19 08:37:34 2015 UTC,"Ya, I think its safe to assume I gave it too much thought. Definitely Butterfly."
pokemon,3dskv9,JJWattGotSnubbed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yup, Bulbapedia says the same thing:   Butterfree is a combination of butterfly and free, possibly referring to its ability to fly after being grounded for two evolutionary stages. In Japanese, the name may also derive from the word 振る furu (to flap, as in wings)."
pokemon,3dskv9,Ruft,2,Mon Jul 20 10:28:10 2015 UTC,"I just realized it myself.  I actually know japanese but never watched pokemon in japanese.  So this is how THIS (Butterfree) happened:  1) Japanese people want to name it butterfly. Since they don't english well they pronounce it ""Butafuri"" (Katakana バタフリ).  2) English translator thinks its a Name for a Pokemon: ""hey if bees make honey, maybe butterflies make butter - Such a cool name! We should keep that!""   // or he was just lazy/high and kept it exactly how japanese pronounce butterfly - which is butterfree  I hate when this happens. And it happens a lot in video games too."
pokemon,3dskv9,Myngz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"But they are perfectly capable of saying something actually close to butterfly.... I'm too lazy to look up if that's the actual Japanese pokemon name for butterfree, but if they wanted to say butterfly, the wouldn't say ""butafuri"", aka ""boo-tah-foo-ri"", they'd say ""bah-tah-fu-rai"". Don't believe me? Think of the way they say yes, or 'hai'. Rhymes with fly, right? Rai works the same way."

pokemon,3dskv9,Jimtehjournalist,7,Sun Jul 19 05:01:06 2015 UTC,"In some languages both would have the soft g sound, and this would be even truer to little kids who never got to hear Lugia be pronounced the right way.

In Gen 3 you can trade freely between RSE and FRLG, indicating they happen around the same time. HGSS happens two years after FRLG (and by extension RSE/ORAS). DPPt starts with a news report on the Red Gyarados in HGSS, meaning they happen around the same time. Ergo, ORAS happens before DPPt and Looker doesn't remember what hasn't happened yet.

pokemon,3dw029,461weavile,4,Mon Jul 20 03:38:52 2015 UTC,The original intent was to have Celebi come out of the anime GS Ball. It would have been a multi-episode arc... but they decided to scrap the plan since Celebi was already featured in the movie.
pokemon,3dw029,menace64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it was because they turned the idea for the arch into a movie. It wasn't that they didn't want two Celebi stories, but that they changed their minds on how to present it."
pokemon,3dw029,TriggerSadGamer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:24:46 2015 UTC,Originally Nintendo thought the anime craze had died down and there wasn't going to be a fourth movie so the GS ball was intended to contain Celebi who would have an arc in the anime.   But when the third movie did better than expected they decided to make a fourth movie with Celebi as the star so the GS Ball was left with Kurt so people would forget about it.

pokemon,3dw9yc,skippingmud,14,Mon Jul 20 10:13:13 2015 UTC,"Ooh, interesting question. I pretty much agree with most of your choices, but I suggest a few changes:   Starter - but I do think it should be the starter that's the same type as yours, just so it represents that he is (or was) a player-character like us. This of course assumes that you battle him in a region where the starters aren't the Johto ones. Gyarados - Specifically, the Red Gyarados from the Lake of Rage. I think this could replace Scizor, although it does reduce the number of Johto Pokemon he has. Dragonite - Just want to put here that it should have Extremespeed! Haha.   Pretty much agree with your other choices. I like how Umbreon's a nice contrast to Red's Espeon in the original games."
pokemon,3dw9yc,ShortchangeParamecia,5,Mon Jul 20 02:10:32 2015 UTC,Can't believe I overlooked the red Gyarados. I like your view on the starter and also should've pointed out E-Speed Dragonite
pokemon,3dw9yc,skippingmud,3,Mon Jul 20 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'd certainly replace Sudowoodo with the Dragonite.  Red's team was comprised of the three starters from Yellow, Lapras from Silph Co., Eevee from Celadon, and one of the two Snorlax because he received no other Gift mons.  If we go specifically by Gift mons, Ethan would only have Togepi, Eevee, his starter, and the Dratini. So, we logically need to give him all three starters, Togepi, Eevee, and Dratini. Sudowoodo was like the Snorlax of Johto, sure, but it was also not important to Ethan. Togepi was given to him because he was seen as a kind soul to take care of it, his starter(s) were given to him when he began his journey and while on it, Eevee was given to him by Bill himself, and Dratini was given to him because he was seen as a worthy person to raise such a rare and powerful Pokemon."
pokemon,3dw9yc,ShortchangeParamecia,5,Mon Jul 20 03:41:41 2015 UTC,"He also gets a Tyrogue from the Karate King in Mt. Mortar, which is why OP put Hitmontop (most sensible choice for Johto representation). As for Sudowoodo, I do think that the Snorlax comparison holds up, and would be exactly the reason why he would use it. It might not be as definitive of Johto as Snorlax was, but it was definitely intended as the Snorlax of Johto. Whether or not that holds a lot of merit is debatable, but it's certainly something to consider.  That's also why I suggested the Red Gyarados as the final team member should Sudowoodo not be used (after starter, Togekiss, Eeveelution, Hitmontop, and Dragonite), since it's one of the definitive Pokemon of the Johto games even though it isn't from Johto, and one that is more than likely to be captured by Gold.   Of course, it does make sense to replace Gyarados and one other gift Pokemon (maybe Dragonite because it isn't from Johto?) with the other two starters to be more representative of Johto, but that's where the discussion becomes interesting, right?  EDIT: Wanted to point out that Red does get two more gift Pokemon: either Hitmonchan or Hitmonlee from the Karate King and either the Helix or Dome Fossil from Mt. Moon. I suspect the presence of a choice is what kept them from being part of his team, but it does support that his team consists of a Pokemon representative of his region and one he actually catches. (This also assumes that he was smart enough not to spend 500 Poke on the Magikarp Salesman.)  EDIT 2: Whoops, miscounted the members of his team. Edited accordingly."

pokemon,3dw9yc,barchambault51,2,Mon Jul 20 11:01:36 2015 UTC,"There are several factors to consider, but mostly I'm thinking about how Gold/Ethan is a successor to Red and that his team would be designed around that.  Remember, he fought Red, the very best, like no one ever was.  Win or lose, Gold/Ethan would have learned something and built a team around that encounter.   The real question is what is Gold/Ethan's signature pokemon?  That would determine who he leads with and is highest leveled.  The series and anime pushed Togepi and Marill as the newest pokemon of gen 2 before it's official release.  Likewise, in gen 4, the rival character has a Marill following them around.  I wouldn't say Ho-oh because even though it was released first in the anime, it didn't show up in every episode after that.  So we're down to Togekiss or Azumarill. Red didn't use anyone elses' signature pokemon, so I'd have to say Dragonite is out, as that honor clearly belongs to Lance. It seems obvious to me that he'd have all 3 Johto starters as a parallel to Red.  Gen II Gold had a better type spread with Espeon over Lapras, but even with Lapras team was still pretty diverse.  So Azumarill and probably red Gyrados are out thanks to him using Feraligatr. Now we've got Togekiss and the 3 starters. I'd say Sudowoodo are a parallel to Snorlax.  Both blocked the roads and have those parallels. The Tyrogue was only obtainable after visiting Kanto, and would reflect Gold/Ethan's 16 badges and journey across 2 regions.  Evolved into a Hitmontop and it'll offer another type to the team that reflects the Johto region.   So in conclusion, I think his team, in order, would be:   Togekiss - Fairy/Flying Hitmontop - Fighting Sudowoodo - Rock Meganium - Grass Typhlosion - Fire Feraligatr - Water"

Some are to frail to slam their body into something and others only have beaks to peck at you with.  You're right in that they're all essentially the same move but i guess I'm trying to say I get what they were going for.
pokemon,3dtxtf,bluejegus,40,Mon Jul 20 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"If you look at it from a game design perspective, it makes more sense.  Let's see you want to make every fully-evolved pokemon in the game competitively viable. As in people can actually choose their favorites and NOT get horribly slaughtered by people that choose what Smogon says.  Take a look at the problems you have to take care of:   Certain pokemon are dependent on their Ability to increase their stats (anything with Huge/Pure power, Fur coat) without it being an ephemeral stat boost (e.g. those gained via moves). This simplifies to having the pokemon with a really high stat and no ability. The pokemon should be rebalanced such that it has an ability with an actual ""interesting"" effect on battle and be given a stat increase. Then there are abilities that are just outright problematic: Truant, Defeatist, Slow Start, Zen Mode. They just place an extra burden on the player by being annoying. I don't even think Skill Swap is all that effective with them. Similarly to the first point, a lot of pokemon are dependent on Items to be good. Thick Club, Soul Dew, Eviolite... they boil down to the same problem: ""This pokemon's stats are bad. Let's have something that modifies those stats, at the cost of some feature every pokemon should have."" Mega Stones are iffy in regards to the above, but they've lead to a programming anti-pattern where you have a bunch of instances of an object that may as well all serve similar functionalities. All Mega Evolutions should be rebalanced and function stonelessly, like Rayquaza. Certain gimmicky outliers will prove EXTREMELY difficult to balance and will need to be saved for last: Smeargle, Mew, Shedinja, and Ditto.    Smeargle is ""Combinatorial Explosion: The pokemon."" With each new move added, it has to be tested in combination with EVERY OTHER MOVE to ensure Smeargle doesn't dominate the metagame with some freaky combo. He already has access to Transform, King's Shield, Spore, Shell Smash... just a few prominent moves of his. Mew is a slightly lesser problematic Smeargle, since it only learns every TM/HM. Shedinja, due to it's stupid gimmick, flips any attempts at normalizing stats on its head. Its stats need to be treated completely different from other pokemon since it only has an effective 161 BST. Why does it even have defensive stats  Ditto's ""Imposter"" ability should just be default; there's no reason for it to have anything else. Allow it to copy HP too; if all other pokemon's stats are balanced and Ditto copies stats, Ditto will also be balanced. Should Unown's only move be a move where the player doesn't even know what type it'd be? Shouldn't Unown at least have some type of ability that gets rid of immunities? Or high enough stats that it can do something other than let the player spell ""I AM DEAD""  There are still probably more issues, but once the above are resolved, stats should be less of an issue at least."

pokemon,3dtxtf,Deathfromabove123,18,Mon Jul 20 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Pokemon is due for some simplification and refactoring, I dont view like half of these examples as problems.   All Eviolite does is provide bonus to categorically noncompetitive (with few exceptions, such as Scyther?) pokemon that are otherwise directly outclassed by their evolutions. It is a key example of valuable player choice. Do you want to sacrifice general stat increases and a wider movepool and access to other items in exchange for a sizable defence boost? Becasue there isn't a ""right"" answer to the question, I think the challenge is to make eviolite-viable pokemon's evolutions more valuable/interesting (Chansey in particular outclasses Blissey; Blissey should get more toys to deal with to become more viable) Megas are pretty much the same boat. Rather than having a few universal interesting items, you now have two important factors to consider; Is the boost worth the cost of an item? (usually yes, not always) Is it the best Mega you can use, since you can only have one? This really lets Megas standout as sort of 'kingpin' team leaders but doesnt centralize behind one correct moveset. There are suddenly many more ways to use Gyrados 'optimally' than ever before I disagree with the mentality that every pokemon family should necessarily be competitively viable. Raticate will pretty much never be outside of NU, but it serves a specific purpose in the core game; a pokemon that level ups and reaches its maximum potential far faster than most pokemon, but will be outclassed by harder investment pokemon (ie, Gyrados or Alakazam). There are a lot of considerations for pokemon balance beyond ""level 100, max IVs/EVs""    where you have a bunch of instances of an object that may as well all serve similar functionalities   This I definitely agree with, and its been an issue with Pokemon in general (seriously, why do Dawn and Dusk stones exist when we already have Sun and Moon?) but thats something that can be adjusted; a generic ""keystone"" item that can be used on any mega-capable pokemon, and collectible 'signatures' (simple flags, not equippable item) that enable the usage of each particular Mega"
pokemon,3dtxtf,TheHeadlessOne,3,Sun Jul 19 20:38:25 2015 UTC,"The whole Dusk and Dawn stones being redundant thing is because Game Freak doesn't like having to retcon. So they can explain new evolutions appearing in a different Gen from the initial Pokemon by saying, ""Well, that stone/incense/evolution capability wasn't available before, and that's why you couldn't evolve it until now."" Instead of just saying ""We didn't create that Pokemon yet so you couldn't evolve it before, deal with it!"""

pokemon,3dtxtf,TheHeadlessOne,5,Sun Jul 19 22:26:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I'm talking about! Personally I'm not fond of all these trinkets you have to attach to a pokemon and trade them with to evolve them. Waiting for RNG to provide you with one of the evolution stones is annoying enough!  EDIT: Mostly.    Eviolite is stupid if the only pokemon that benefit are a handful of Stage 1 evolutions. Since its effectiveness is stat-dependent, the majority of pokemon don't get enough of a stat boost to outclass their evolution's defenses. If they did, it'd be a lot more acceptable. I still think all Mega Evolution should function Stonelessly. Everything was fine until ORAS's legendaries and their bullshit started breaking the rules, especially Ray. There's no problem with Raticate reaching its potential faster than a lot of pokemon, it's the fact that without time being a factor, there's no incentive to train it. Given all the time in the world, you're incentivized to invest it into difficult-to-raise pokemon. If there were a competition or something where you're given a short amount of time to raise a whole team from scratch, then that's where it'd really shine as something usable instead of Gyarados-food."
pokemon,3dtxtf,Muhznit,2,Sun Jul 19 22:15:43 2015 UTC,"I do think Pokemon would benefit greatly from Gamefreak stepping back and reanalyzing things. Like, why is Ground a type? why are normal types immune to ghost? Why can fighting chop through steel? not to mention everything wrong with poison. Do the same thought process for each pokemon, for every move, for every ability, for every mechanic (HMs, seriously) give them all purpose (in the case of the pokemon, not necessarily viability-because like i said, Raticate has an ingame utility that is worthwhile) and if they are nonessential, cut them.  EDIT: and the point of these examples isnt to say that any of those types are necessarily problematic, but it should re-examined and determined internally how valuable they really are as is or if they could be refactored to be made more balanced"
pokemon,3dtxtf,TheHeadlessOne,7,Sun Jul 19 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"The type chart is it's own completely separate Eldritch Abomination in terms of game balance since it affects every pokemon and every move simultaneously. The issues aren't even mnemonics of remembering what type does what, it's more of ""what are the general stats of of pokemon with this type"" and ""how strong/bulky the type should be in general should this type be""."
pokemon,3dtxtf,Muhznit,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:51 2015 UTC,"Types are definitely one of the most fundamentally 'unfixable' concepts in Pokebloat because everything inevitably comes back to them, and every new move, ability, or pokemon makes it that much harder to fix  I remember being so disappointed that gen's 2 and 3 didn't carry through, but what we have now are so many built up problems. The game is fundamentally the same as it was in Gen III, just more, but it means they have to maintain support for the last fifteen years. Its impressive what they've done, but it makes it so much harder to deal with the inevitable bloat"

Suddenly it occurs to me that Game Freak's attempt at preserving each and every player's save data through the years, each and every EV, IV, and moveset is actually the biggest issue with rebalancing.   Retcon shit and fans will be in uproar, continue as is and code bloat increases exponentially... dang, that must be tough."
pokemon,3dtxtf,Muhznit,10,Mon Jul 20 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of these problems can be solved by adding more - not taking anything away. If we consider ""competitively viable"" to mean ""viable in OU"", a solution would be to add more moves and abilities - to diverge the roles each Pokemon can fill rather than reducing them. A large portion of Pokemon in the lower tiers are there because their niche is taken up by either something that overshadows it, or by a large number of Pokemon that all fill the same role, so their usage is spread out rather than concentrated on one Pokemon. Simplifying the game exasperates this problem rather than fixing it. Look at Serperior. Before it got Contrary, it was a mediocre dual screener in PU. Now it's in OU, because it fills a role that didn't exist before. We need more of that - potentially one for every Pokemon.  As for gimmick Pokemon, most of them already are viable, but we'll just have to accept that they'll always have low usage. Using them is different to using a normal Pokemon, and they're less common because of that, but Ditto is exactly as viable in OU as he is in NU. Slacking, Archeops, and Regigigas all have sky-high base stats to compensate the player for working around their abilities, and Shedinja (my favourite Pokemon) is the very definition of high-risk, high-reward, and is perfectly capable of being used in any tier. I do agree, however, that Unown needs anything to make it less useless, and Smeargle almost certainly causes major problems for GF whenever they introduce new moves.  One thing I would change is entry hazards - specifically Stealth Rocks. It cripples entire types, relegating them to the bottom tiers unless they have something truly spectacular to offer. I feel like it's limiting certain Pokemon, and for some of them is the only thing preventing them from reaching the level of viability we both feel every Pokemon should have.  tl;dr If we want to be at the point where everyone's favourite Pokemon is viable, we need more variety, not less. Instead of having whole hosts of Pokemon competing to be ""the best revenge killer"" or ""the best mixed wall"", each Pokemon needs to gain its own individual niche."
pokemon,3dtxtf,ytpies,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"There are basically three alternatives to stealth rock-  Remove it entirely. Make its effects identical to Spikes. Boring, but it keeps it from being such a dominant, destructive force  Make tons of entry hazards. Like, Tar Pit that knocks down newcomers speed one stage or other elements, and you can only have a single one in play at a time. It has a bunch of  potential issues, but ideally the wide variety would keep any one from being a dominant force  Add new limitations to entry hazards. Limited number of triggers, smaller scale (rather than stack multiplicatively, stack additively, a slight boost for those 4x weak) turn limits, many more ways of removing them. They are very particular abilities with very particular counters, but they are far more ubiquitous and powerful than their counters are"
pokemon,3dtxtf,TheHeadlessOne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"I think the best way of doing it would be to treat it like Reflect and Light Screen. Have it last a limited number of turns, but also add a hold item (""Sneaky Pebble"" or something) to extend it. It keeps Stealth Rocks powerful enough that having something to set it up is a good idea, but stops it from condeming the entire Ice, Flying, and Bug types."
pokemon,3dtxtf,ytpies,0,Sun Jul 19 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"No, no no! They don't need to go adding more stuff all rampantly and willy-nilly, they need to fix what's here already and derive variety from that!  Adding more variety without some form of systematic computer-assisted balancing algorithms or something only adds to the problem. Examine Smeargle again. Each new move compounds with others in such a way that developers must be extremely meticulous in ensuring it doesn't create some super-broken combo. Because more time must be spent hand-balancing every little edge case that pops up, less time is available to ensure all the other kinks are worked out of the game. If the edge cases can be nullified, that streamlines the process of adding stuff to the game without worrying about any specific pokemon being overwhelmingly dominant in some role. The balance issues stem from the lack of scalability for the system as a whole.  Even after you fix the problems brought by the lack of scalability, the game retains its complexity because you wind up closing the gaps between OU, UU, NU, RU and whatever ""These guys are definitely not used"" tier Smogon comes up with. You now actually have variety in the form of the formerly never-acknowledged pokemon running around the tier. Why add new stuff when there are plenty of unloved pokemon around to buff? No need to contact the marketing team to come up with a design, no need for artists to render a new sprite/model, no need to add to the already-bloated pokedex, just programmers taking what they've currently got and tweaking them per-patch like any other competitive game. We have Unown, Mantine, Luvdisc, Lumineon, Delibird, Farfetch'd, Pelliper, Spinda, Kricketune, Klinklang, Lilligant, Flareon and more all itching for the spotlight without having to rely on heavy team support, but they keep getting shafted each generation."
pokemon,3dtxtf,Muhznit,4,Sun Jul 19 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand, that's exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not suggesting adding new Pokemon, instead I'm saying giving the ones in RU and below new toys to play with. Instead of having like 16 ""bulky rocks guys"", give some of them new abilities or moves to define them.   As an example, take Ludicolo. He's a pretty good Pokemon, but his main use is as a Rain Sweeper. As good as he is, he'll never see any use while Pokemon like Kingdra and Mega Swampert fulfill the same purpose. I'm proposing giving Ludicolo and others like him new toys, not to compete with the better rain sweepers, but to carve out their own niche in the metagame. Ideally, every Pokemon would be the best at something, whatever that might be."
pokemon,3dtxtf,ytpies,2,Sun Jul 19 22:32:23 2015 UTC,"Ah. My mistake. However I would like to contend that for a lot of pokemon, they don't need toys, they just need stat boosts.

Lilligant's overdue for a Special move that's not Dream Eater, Normal-type, or hidden power, though..."
pokemon,3dtxtf,Muhznit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:46 2015 UTC,"It's true that some Pokemon would need a stat boost, but I think it'd be better to keep it to a minimum. At this point, we already have Pokemon of most stat combinations, so boosting most Pokemon wouldn't solve the main problem. At best, it'd turn a bad Pokemon into a mediocre one, and at worst it'd usurp another Pokemon and we'd be back to the same problem, but now we also have to deal with power creep. I think stat boosts are better kept for Pokemon that already have all the tools they need to fulfill a unique role, but not the stats to make use of them. Castform is actually a good example of that. He has a cool gimmick, but otherwise sucks balls."

pokemon,3dtxtf,Classtoise,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with what you say about stats. All your abilities affecting stats arguments are only valid if abilities are not manipulatable, but they are through several other abilities and moves. Therefore having having huge power is not the same as having twice the attack and no ability since simple beam, pokemon with trace etc can mix around with it. It adds layers of depth to the game.   To have all pokemon be equally viable is not something i believe in. Firstly, it removes the flair from the pokemon world, some pokemon are meant to be stronger than others. Secondly, the two ways of balancing it are either making all pokemon more bland and similiar or going through tremendous lengths to balance. Games such as LoL which atempt to do this re-patch every other week/month because it is so difficult."
pokemon,3dtxtf,TheOceanPig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"Despite the abilities being mutable (FTFY), what I've described is the most common scenario, pure, with no extra assumptions. Huge/Pure Power isa silly, uncreative way of fixing a problem with a pokemon's stats in a way that only equally silly situational shenanigans will undo it.  Seriously, if you have a pokemon Tracing Pure/Huge power, you're being nothing BUT silly, considering the attack stats of those Tracers. There is never any reason to use Simple Beam on an opponent with a stat-boosting ability unless you're positive they're not carrying a stat-boosting move, and using it on an ally is shooting yourself in the foot.   There are dozens of abilities that would add more depth to the game than what Huge / Pure power do now. EVERY ability is mutable, so the amount of depth it adds is dependent upon how many interactions with other stuff it has. Huge Power only interacts with one stat. It doesn't affect your moves like Protean, it doesn't affect a list of abilities/moves like weather, it doesn't modify priorities like Prankster, and the stat boost is gives is not psyche-up-able, haze-able, or swappable like Intimidate. You can say it adds layers of depth to the game, but just pointing out generic interactions intrinsic to every ability does not help your case.  Second, if you concerned about world-building aspects in regards to modifying pokemon, then you should not get involved in competitive discussion. The entire single-player campaign can be scripted such that weird plot shit renders certain pokemon the ability to appear or be abnormally powerful, e.g. the Red Gyarados in GSC, uncatchable Black/White Kyurem in B2W2, or just the leveling system itself since competitive is supposed to put everything at the same level.  In regards to balancing methodologies, there is nothing lost in making stats work in a more consistent manner across pokemon. They still retain their typing and there are plenty of abilities that can still be a good fit in case I recommended getting rid of it. Uniqueness should center on the pokemon and how all of its components interact, not the extraneous stuff that can be skill-swapped, knocked off, or copied via transform. And to do that without wierd balancing side effects requires consistency and programmatic balancing."
pokemon,3dtxtf,Muhznit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"Nintendo and Pokemon have said they don't care about the tiers at all.  I agree though that they will seek to get rid of OP Pokemon builds to equalise the playing field a bit.  Also I think they will fix up the type charts to better reflect weaknesses/resistances because right now its a bit confusing for some types. E.g. Rock is super effective against bug but bug is not resisted by rock, and psychic is weak to bug but bug doesn't resist psychic. Fight resists bug but isn't super effective against it. Flying is weak to ice but ice doesn't resist flying.  My point is that sometimes the type chart can be very hard to remember to the point where I have to look up certain Pokes to make sure they're weakness/strengths are what I think they are."
pokemon,3dtxtf,ArimusPrime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:17:49 2015 UTC,"The problem with the type chart is that early on, it was generally used as a basic guideline for what a pokemon's stats will be like. Electric, Flying and Bug types were speedy, Rock and Steel types were defensive, Fighting and fire types were offensive, etc. As a result, if you start meddling with a type's strengths/weaknesses, you need to keep in mind how it tends to impact the average stats of that type."
pokemon,3dtxtf,Muhznit,29,Tue Jul 21 01:52:24 2015 UTC,"You're right, I forgot about that.  ''In the magazine “We Love Pokémon”, Game Freak's Ken Sugimori commented on the seventh generation of Pokémon.  When asked what the next generation of Pokémon games will be like if such a plan exists, Sugimori commented that they will not add more layers of complexity, but rather revert back to simplicity, in part by using elements found in Pokémon Red and Green. Therefore, there is now speculation that Game Freak may opt for this route in developing Generation VII.  As a side note, not only the number of games, but also the number of Pokémon, moves, abilities, items, etc. increase as each new generation is introduced, to such a degree that is difficult to remember all of them. It is impossible to decrease the amount of Pokémon, and such a move is assumed to be uncalled for, but some fans have claimed that it might be better to significantly organize/trim the moves, abilities, items, etc.''"
pokemon,3dtxtf,ShortchangeParamecia,17,Sun Jul 19 14:15:27 2015 UTC,How the hell do you trim/organize them? Without removing them that really doesn't make any sense.
pokemon,3dtxtf,r0cks0l1dd,23,Sun Jul 19 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"There's some moves/abilities that are a bit pointless really. For example, Huge Power and Pure Power were both introduced in Gen III and have the same effect. Bubble was buffed in Gen VI, making it a superior version of Water Gun in every way."

pokemon,3dtxtf,bowtochris,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:59 2015 UTC,"To tell you that he only promised to not remove any pokemon, Since you said ""Without removing them that really doesn't make any sense,"" I assumed you thought that he had promised not to remove anything."
pokemon,3dtxtf,ShortchangeParamecia,3,Sun Jul 19 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, removing TM'S and ABILITIES.  I don't see how you could trim down or organize moves and abilities unless you begin actually removing them. He used those phrases specifically, rather than outright saying so, even though that's virtually the only way to do it."
pokemon,3dtxtf,bowtochris,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:48 2015 UTC,He's saying that he's removing moves and abilities. It's pretty explicit.

pokemon,3dtxtf,jugol,9,Sun Jul 19 19:09:43 2015 UTC,Why people are trying to associate this thing to Zygarde? My first guess is just the basic/larva stage of gen 7's regional bug.
pokemon,3dtxtf,JavelinTF2,8,Sun Jul 19 21:26:13 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe that they would choose such an insignificant pokemon to reveal for this movie
pokemon,3dtxtf,jugol,6,Mon Jul 20 01:04:46 2015 UTC,"They did with a good bunch of non-relevant (for the games) Pokémon. Particularly Ledyba, a regional bug.  Just being the signature Pokémon for a certain anime character is enough excuse to give it some light."
pokemon,3dtxtf,cheekiestNandos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:53 2015 UTC,"I'd hardly call it insignificant at this point.

There have been numerous references to events thousands of years in the past, which could make enough material to make a game from. Its mostly fanciful thinking, but it would be pretty interesting to play during the Kalos War to better understand the Ultimate Weapon and AZ's backstory. (Possible Zygarde pre-evolution?)"
pokemon,3dtxtf,HumanAtlas,16,Mon Jul 20 05:06:17 2015 UTC,I'm still hoping for a Gen 6.5 but we'll see
pokemon,3dtxtf,Cheeseburguh,8,Sun Jul 19 15:52:44 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm pretty sure at one point it was said that we haven't seen all the Pokémon to come with Gen 6.
pokemon,3dtxtf,mudermarshmallows,8,Sun Jul 19 19:07:10 2015 UTC,I think that meant the hidden 3 legendaries.
pokemon,3dtxtf,helios_225,10,Sun Jul 19 19:39:42 2015 UTC,"Many have noted that the number of new pokémon in this generation was less than any other, and hoped that more would be released with the next gen 6 game. Since Zygarde was found, many have presumed that the next Kalos game will be Pokémon Z. The possible connection of the new thing in this post and the other monster thing possibly being a Zygarde form generates hype around that theory."
pokemon,3dtxtf,mudermarshmallows,13,Sun Jul 19 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"But we also got mega evolutions, which, while not full time pokemon, do take time to develop and plan, if we included them, we would be at 120. Zygarde being found has nothing to do with a Pokemon Z, it will happen in some form, either in Pokemon X2/Y2, or Z, but Zygarde will have the focus, no mascot legendary has had the 3rd member go unchecked.  Pokemon do not appear in a generation, for that is what makes a generation. New Pokemon. If we suddenly started making new pokemon with each game, that whole concept is void."
pokemon,3dtxtf,helios_225,5,Sun Jul 19 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"The technology exists now to retroactively update X/Y. If that means were used to add new species to those games, would that count as part of the same generation?  It's also possible that parts of the games haven't been hacked yet, and the hacks gave us first looks at numerous megas, Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion."
pokemon,3dtxtf,d4mation,8,Sun Jul 19 20:08:51 2015 UTC,"The technology exists, but GameFreak refuses to utilize it. X/Y never got ORAS' Megas or Primal Evolutions. (Latias and Latios were already a part of X/Y's game data before ORAS was released.)"
pokemon,3dtxtf,randomdice101,4,Sun Jul 19 21:52:42 2015 UTC,They can't add them because it would cause problems if you ran the game on a console without the update. The data would be unreadable or no model would show up/glitches would occur. This isn't game freak refusing to update the games.
pokemon,3dtxtf,d4mation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:32 2015 UTC,That's a really good point. I had never thought of that. Maybe have the Save file force an update if it Detects it is below a certain version?
pokemon,3dtxtf,GoldenScarab,2,Sun Jul 19 23:02:25 2015 UTC,That would require an internet connection to be able to play it though.
pokemon,3dtxtf,randomdice101,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:25 2015 UTC,Problem is that the 3ds isn't made to do that and if you happen to buy a game that had the update and your 3ds can't update (no space/no internet) the game is now unplayable. Don't think Nintendo wants to do that.
pokemon,3dtxtf,randomdice101,4,Mon Jul 20 15:20:56 2015 UTC,They can't add new Pokemon or items with an update because of you deleted the update (or moved the cart to a 3ds that didn't have the update) the data would probably be all corrupted because they would have no model or information. It's not because game freak doesn't want to add them in.
pokemon,3dtxtf,enragedmanatee,2,Sun Jul 19 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"I've always been happy about that. I'd rather have a small number of great Pokemon than a huge number of shit Pokemon.

Plus, the NX hasn't even released yet and probably won't until at least 2017, so Gen 7 would have to wait until at least then."
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,16,Sun Jul 19 19:43:01 2015 UTC,Why exactly would the NX need to be released before Gen 7 does?
pokemon,3dv08u,Dark-Scar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:04:34 2015 UTC,"Quick question, what's the NX?"
pokemon,3dv08u,AdvancedWin,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:37 2015 UTC,"Nintendo's next console, which is most likely a home console that's actually going to use current-gen tech. The Wii-U has sold horribly, in part because it's just now caught up with last gen 360 and PS3."
pokemon,3dv08u,ShortchangeParamecia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"I see, thanks, it would make sense considering the 3ds is still pretty new"
pokemon,3dv08u,AdvancedWin,0,Mon Jul 20 02:17:06 2015 UTC,"It's not. By 2017 which is probably the earliest the NX is coming out, is about a whole videogame gen."
pokemon,3dv08u,ArchAngelofSloths,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:08:19 2015 UTC,"Something being developed by Nintendo that was ""announced"" (all we got was the codename) last year, all we know about it currently is the codename which is NX. We have no idea if it will be a console, handheld, or some form of hybrid of the two but we do know that Nintendo plans to do some form of gimmick with it (I personally think it might be something related to mobile compatibility since Nintendo has been talking about wanting to get into the mobile gaming business as a sort of side project)."
pokemon,3dv08u,Dark-Scar,-16,Mon Jul 20 06:32:17 2015 UTC,Because Gen 7 is going to be on it...
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,15,Sun Jul 19 21:07:52 2015 UTC,No one at GameFreak said that.
pokemon,3dv08u,PSIRockin243,-14,Sun Jul 19 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"It's kind of obvious. NX will be released in a couple years, and there's still another Zygarde form that isn't even programmed into a game yet, which means there will be a Z-quel, and that'll be just enough time for the NX to be released with Gen 7 in 2-3 years."
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,11,Sun Jul 19 21:18:21 2015 UTC,We don't even know if the NX will be a console or a handheld or some form of hybrid between the two so how can you say Gen 7 will be on it when all we know is the codename?
pokemon,3dv08u,Dark-Scar,-7,Sun Jul 19 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"how can you say Gen 7 will be on it when all we know is the codename?   I know they can't announce a new Generation without its system even being announced. The next handheld, if it's not the NX, will most likely come a year or so after, as the 3DS would already be 6-7 years old by the time the NX releases. They wouldn't release Gen 7 on the 3DS unless it was super different and optimized like Gen 5 was, and there's not much to be optimized graphics-wise except for the ability to constantly have 3D turned on.  Basically, it can't be on the 3DS, and they can't announce a game before announcing its system first, so either this Pokémon can't be from Gen 7, or the next handheld will be announced before the new Pokémon is fully revealed."
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,6,Sun Jul 19 22:44:47 2015 UTC,I know they can't announce a new Generation without its system even being announced.    Gen IV and V came out on the DS so we already know this isn't the case
pokemon,3dv08u,zhurrick,-7,Sun Jul 19 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Gen 5 drastically improved basically everything visually. There's not much to change graphics-wise on the 3DS other than make 3D available everywhere and change the sprites up a bit."
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,2,Sun Jul 19 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"so either this Pokémon can't be from Gen 7, or the next handheld will be announced before the new Pokémon is fully revealed.   Well if that's the case with your logic then we will be seeing the next handheld announced next summer since more than likely this new Pokemon will be showcased in the new movie since often a Pokemon from the next Gen is shown off in the last movie of a generation (and since likely Volcanion will be included in this new movie too we could see the end of Gen 6)."
pokemon,3dv08u,Dark-Scar,-3,Sun Jul 19 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"The NX is likely either a handheld or a hybrid of handheld/console, as Nintendo always alternates between handheld and console, so it can't be a console. If it's either a handheld or a hybrid, which it most likely is, it'll have a new Pokémon gen on it. It's going to be officially announced next year, so that would line up."
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:11 2015 UTC,We don't even know what the hell the NX is yet. Too soon for any speculation.
pokemon,3dv08u,blweldon2,0,Mon Jul 20 00:28:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they can't announce a new Gen without us knowing anything about its system. And there's not much else they can do graphics-wise to put Gen 7 on the 3DS. They had an excuse to put Gen 5 on the DS because they made everything look so different.  What we kind of know is that it can't be a Wii U successor, because Nintendo alternates between console and handheld. It might be a handheld, it might be some sort of hybrid, or it might be a smartphone. We don't now what it is, but it'll most likely be something portable, and a portable system is a system that can play Pokémon."
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:35:53 2015 UTC,"They had an excuse to put Gen 5 on the DS because they made everything look so different.   Let me make some points here based on the Japanese dates.  Yellow came out in 1998, which was the same year as the Game Boy Color came out.  FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald all came out in 2004, the same year as the DS.  The DSi came out in 2008.  The list of games that came afterwards: HeartGold, SoulSilver, Black, White, Black 2, and White 2."
pokemon,3dv08u,SgvSth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yellow came out a month before the GBC and FRLG/E came out before the DS.  HGSS and Gen 5 stayed on the DS because the DSi wasn't really its own standalone handheld. It had a couple exclusive AR games nobody knew about, and the eShop. The only thing that made it different from the DS was built-in internet and a camera, which weren't needed that badly, so the DSi features just became optional in Gen 5 and they were released for the DS.  Basically, they didn't release Gen 5 on the DSi because not enough people would get one, especially with the 3DS coming up right after."
pokemon,3dv08u,joescool,58,Mon Jul 20 02:02:26 2015 UTC,Ho-oh was shown in the first episode of the anime. It was a part of Gen 2. This Pokemon can be a part of Gen 7. Just we may not actually see it ingame until after a Volcanion movie.
pokemon,3dv08u,Jps101,36,Sun Jul 19 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Then we had Togepi, and there was Donphan and Snubbull in the first movie."
pokemon,3dv08u,BlizzardFenrir,8,Sun Jul 19 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"True, but Mew was already revealed at that point. I think what OP is saying is that they won't start making official reveals for Gen 7 pokemon until they've finished revealing all the Gen 6 pokemon. It's normal for them to tease new pokemon before the next gen is released, but I don't know if they've ever done that before actually finishing everything in the current Gen."
pokemon,3dv08u,MisterParagon,4,Mon Jul 20 00:04:14 2015 UTC,And Marill.
pokemon,3dv08u,ShortchangeParamecia,6,Mon Jul 20 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"It may also be possible that Volcanion will be in the movie next year alongside Zygarde and this new Pokemon, considering the fact Diancie was in the same movie as Yveltal and Xerneas this could be the case."
pokemon,3dv08u,Dark-Scar,4,Sun Jul 19 19:31:26 2015 UTC,That's true...
pokemon,3dv08u,Zergonaplate,8,Sun Jul 19 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"I think that's a bit of an exception, since many gen 2 pokemon were created before gen 1 released, and were cut and put in gen 2."
pokemon,3dv08u,Jps101,9,Sun Jul 19 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"mjangelvortexMew also pointed out every other early shower though... This includes things like Lucario, Weavile, Zoroark, Gogoat and Noivern... It's not really an exception in that case :)"
pokemon,3dv08u,Zergonaplate,7,Sun Jul 19 20:55:48 2015 UTC,"I looked up a lot of these, and as far as I can tell they were shown a lot later. Blaziken was shown 2 years after Crystal had released, Munchlax was shown a couple of months before Emerald released (but long after it was announced), Lucario and Weavile were shown a year after Emerald released, Zoroark was shown a year after HGSS were released, and Gogoat, Noivern, and Helioptile were shown a year after B2W2 released.   My point is, they were all revealed (often years) after the last games in the previous generation were announced. Since we're still waiting for the last gen 6 games to be revealed, it's unlikely a gen 7 pokemon will be revealed yet (if you go by past patterns). Of course they might completely change it this time, but it's clear that Ho-oh was an exception."
pokemon,3dv08u,ShortchangeParamecia,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Ho-Oh as well as a few Johto Pokemon were created before Gen 1 even."
pokemon,3dv08u,Jps101,2,Mon Jul 20 02:04:39 2015 UTC,"For all we know, this new one was designed a while ago but they saved it for gen 7"
pokemon,3dv08u,MorallyIncorrect,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:51:54 2015 UTC,"I can't pull up a source right now, bit while a lot of 2nd gen was designed with the 1st gen pokemon, Ho-oh was never planned to be a gen 1 pokemon."
pokemon,3dv08u,mjangelvortex,9,Tue Jul 21 10:10:21 2015 UTC,"We got to see Pokemon in the anime and the movies a generation before they offically come out in the games like Ho-Oh, Togepi, Blaziken, Muchlax, Weavile, Lucario, Zoroark, and Gogoat. This could be an example like that. Only time will tell though."
pokemon,3dv08u,Jps101,6,Sun Jul 19 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Gogoat, Helioptile AND Noivern... However I can't remember if these episodes were out after X and Y were or before..."
pokemon,3dv08u,mjangelvortex,3,Sun Jul 19 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"Definately before. Alexa joined Ash, Iris, and Cilan during the end of the Decolora Islands arc. Speaking of filler arcs introducing new Pokemon Lugia and Slowking appeared in the second movie during the Orange Islands arc. Tracy had a Marill too but Marill also appeared in Pikachu's vacation beforehand too.  I think Donphan, Kecleon, and Mime Jr. appeared early in the anime as well."
pokemon,3dv08u,ShortchangeParamecia,5,Sun Jul 19 19:32:37 2015 UTC,Nobody ever remembers Keckleon being revealed in one episode halfway through Johto.
pokemon,3dv08u,NoxiousSludge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:29 2015 UTC,I do! Wasn't he used by that guy who beat Ash with a Blaziken during that Johto tournament?
pokemon,3dv08u,mjangelvortex,3,Mon Jul 20 04:49:00 2015 UTC,Nope. They were used by two women named Madison and Alexa.  One of them has a purple Kecleon (like how one of the Kecleon brothers in the Mystery Dungeon games are purple). That should have been Kecleon's real shiny. Instead we got this.
pokemon,3dv08u,NoxiousSludge,4,Mon Jul 20 05:09:23 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, the fact that you could never get a purple Kecleon in the games seriously disappointed me."
pokemon,3dv08u,ShortchangeParamecia,2,Mon Jul 20 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"Always wondered what was up with the purple keckleons. Like, did the anime just get incorrect info about its shiny, or just spitballed some alternate color schemes or something?"
pokemon,3dv08u,mjangelvortex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:08 2015 UTC,The anime has had its fair share of Pokemon with their own alternate colors and markings so it could have been that.   Or it could have been a developmental reference. Maybe Kecleon was originally going to be purple and they decided to have a purple one as a reference to that. Or maybe they were working on the first Mystery Dungeon games way back then since they also have a purple Kecleon in it.
pokemon,3dv08u,mjangelvortex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:17 2015 UTC,I brought up Kecleon in another one of my posts here actually.
pokemon,3dv08u,ShortchangeParamecia,3,Mon Jul 20 05:04:40 2015 UTC,I still remember trying to figure out where to find Keckleon in Crystal version for a couple days before I found out they weren't in Johto.
pokemon,3dv08u,tale-wind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:44 2015 UTC,SAME.
pokemon,3dv08u,EmeraldCobra,14,Tue Jul 21 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"Thats why i think gen 6 is split into two different regions, basically gen 6.5"
pokemon,3dv08u,domeforaklondikebar,18,Sun Jul 19 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"I would buy that if:  1) This gen wasn't even Gen which usually has less Pokemon, so far we got like 70+50 Megas, which is basically more than Sinnohs 90 new+20 older Pokemon evos.  2). Game Freak had given an ORAS compatibility update to XY, because if they decide to not give a compatibility update to XY and ORAS for the next game, which they probably won't, but if this next game somehow has 70 more Pokemon that won't be backwards compatible, it'd be a fucking rip off. Especially since XY was short and didnt have much to do."
pokemon,3dv08u,TheHeadlessOne,3,Sun Jul 19 20:13:46 2015 UTC,"1) I dont think Gamefreak willingly follows this sort of 'pattern'-I think they approach each game fresh, aside from archetypes like starters and legendary trios. They generally seem to be addressing issues of previous generations each time (Gen 2's pokemon never took the spotlight, Gen 3's often outclassed their Gen 1 counterparts, Gen 4 relied too heavily on old pokemon, Gen V just pumped as many new pokemon into the game as possible and hugely pushed the powercreep)  2) I'd argue that itd make more sense to have a ""6.5"" patch that brings up both XY and ORAS up to date than first an ORAS patch for XY then a ""6.5"" patch for both sets. I'm not even a believe in gen 6.5, but I do think the reason their wasnt a patch is because they dont want to have to go through all that again when they inevitably release Z (or X2Y2, or whatever)"
pokemon,3dv08u,gogogadgetgogoat,6,Sun Jul 19 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"But surely we would count that as gen 7 anyway? Even if only say 50 new pokemon are released, if it's in a different region I think I'd count that as a new gen."
pokemon,3dv08u,TheHeadlessOne,4,Sun Jul 19 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"It depends. If they release an update patch to make it fully compatible with XY, itd be more 6th gen"
pokemon,3dv08u,cephalopodAscendant,5,Sun Jul 19 22:49:04 2015 UTC,They didn't patch XY to be compatible with the new Mega Evolutions from ORAS. I don't think they're going to patch them for a whole new set of Pokémon.
pokemon,3dv08u,TheHeadlessOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"Again, I think itd make more sense to make a one-time patch to bring both ORAS and XY up to date than first a patch to bring XY up to ORAS and then a patch to bring ORAS and XY up to date"
pokemon,3dv08u,gogogadgetgogoat,2,Mon Jul 20 11:35:45 2015 UTC,"Ohh, I see what you're saying now. Fair enough, I'll go back to PU"
pokemon,3dv08u,YamadaDesigns,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"What are we guessing the giant silhouette, probably Legendary, Pokemon is?"
pokemon,3dv08u,YamadaDesigns,2,Mon Jul 20 03:22:44 2015 UTC,New form of Zygarde. It looks like it and someone who saw the movie said it went from the silhouette to a green flash.
pokemon,3dv08u,Goldrush453,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:46 2015 UTC,"wait, so is he not actually in this movie, is it a teaser for the next movie?"
pokemon,3dv08u,Sak_,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:44 2015 UTC,The silhouetted pokemon or the mystery pokemon? I believe they're both teasers for the next movie.
pokemon,3dv08u,volcarona6,2,Mon Jul 20 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"Let's not rule out that this little blobby guy coud be related to Zygarde. Zygarde is described to look after the ecosystem from well beneath the earth, and I can think of plenty of ways this little guy could be tied into that lore behind Zygarde."
pokemon,3dv08u,Sak_,0,Mon Jul 20 08:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's too early for generation 7 to start."
pokemon,3dv08u,volcarona6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:23:45 2015 UTC,I disagree with you on this. Gen V lasted 3 years and gen 6 is approaching it's 2 anniversary. The way Nintendo and Game Freak releases tidbits of information about the new generations lasts about a year. Gen 6 would have been as long as 5.
pokemon,3dv08u,Sak_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:59 2015 UTC,well if the new pokemon was gen 7 then it would be only 2 years.
pokemon,3dv08u,volcarona6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I don't see how you came to that conclusion. It will be two years in the fall. Pokemon usually officially announces the next gen right around that time and slowly leaks out information. It is around 9-12 months from official announcement to game release. That puts gen 6 at 3 years, the same as gen 5."
pokemon,3dv08u,Sak_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"No, if they showed us a gen 7 pokemon then they wouldn't just wait a year for no fucking reason and slowly stroll towards end of gen 6, if that blobby pokemon was actually gen 7 then next years game would also be gen 7 meaning that gen 6 would end after 2 years."
pokemon,3dv08u,volcarona6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"You have just agreed with me! If the game is released next year it would have been 3 years! Pokemon x has been out since October 12, 2013. Next year is 2016 and the games are released in the fall which is 3 years. I have no idea where this 2 years number you are saying is coming from, care to elaborate? Two years means it would be released in the next two months. I'm saying it is a teaser for the next gen to come out next fall which is 3 years since x and y."
pokemon,3dv08u,Sak_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"i said the exact opposite of that, I said if the new pokemon are gen 7 then gen 6 would be shortened to only 2 years."
pokemon,3dv08u,volcarona6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:32 2015 UTC,How would it be two years? If the game released next year which is what I said then the gen lasted 3 years.

pokemon,3e0aoz,zoso33,6,Mon Jul 20 23:39:27 2015 UTC,"If you look at the animation for Thousand Waves, it uses hexagons like those on Zygarde. It's almost certain that it'll be a signature move of Zygarde.  However, there's no evidence supporting a second alternate form/Mega Evolution of Zygarde. All we have so far is the 2 unused Ground moves, and the image from the 2016 movie trailer pointing towards one new form of Zygarde. There's no proof of a second one."
pokemon,3e0aoz,KaSlaps,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"It just seems unusual to give Zygarde two signature attacks and one altered form.  However, this is more my reasoning that I believe that the theory that the new Pokemon is Zygarde is true, and the two forms is more tinfoily."
pokemon,3e0aoz,KaSlaps,3,Mon Jul 20 23:58:10 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to assume a second form currently. We have got 2 signature moves, much like Kyurem had, as well as one that it gained by Level-up (Land's Wrath, again, like Kyurem's Glaciate).  I'm not sure what Zygarde's going to be doing in 2016, but we can't say for sure that it has 2 new forms of sorts to come. Either way I'm excited to see what happens, as I really like Zygarde's standard form."
pokemon,3e0aoz,papa_smurphy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"You just compared Zygarde to Kyurem with the fact that is has 2 unreleased signature moves, but yet you also claim there's no proof Zygarde will have two forms? That makes no sense. The two moves is exactly proof that Zygarde will get two forms. And just because only one was teased now doesnt mean we wont see the other. Look at Mega Mewtwo and Mega Charizard. One form revealed at first, and then the second one shown later."
pokemon,3e0aoz,KaSlaps,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:28 2015 UTC,"I compared them, but it's not a solid proof to say ""hey these two are the same therefore confirmed"". I'm just saying I acknowledge the similarity.  Again, multiple signature moves doesn't necessarily mean multiple forms. All we know so far is that there are unused moves in Thousand Arrows and Thousand Waves which are assumed to be Zygarde's, as well as a shadow of what is presumably a new form of Zygarde. We can currently only make a case for one new form of Zygarde, as that is all the information we have to look at so far.  If we see this new Zygarde form looking like a hybrid with Xerneas or Yveltal, then we can make a case for a second form, but we don't know anything about it yet."
pokemon,3e0aoz,papa_smurphy,3,Tue Jul 21 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"It would make no sense for one form to get two signature moves when the base form only has one. Every pokemon that has signature moves and alternate forms only has one per form. Rotom learns one new move with each of its forms, Kyurem has Glaciate as base form, Ice Burn as White Kyurem, and Freeze Shock as White Kyurem. Zygarde has Land's Wrath in base form, so it makes sense that it will get one form with Thousand Arrows and one form with Thousand Waves. Plus we know from data mining that 2 more versions are coming in gen 6. 2 moves + 2 versions = 2 Zygarde forms, one as a mascot for each version with each move."
pokemon,3e0aoz,KaSlaps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:35 2015 UTC,"Rotom's moves are not signature moves. And while we're on the topic of signature moves to forms ratio, Klefki and Vespiquen both have multiple signature moves (2 and 3 respectively) but no additional forms.  We know by data mining that there's space for 2 more games, but that doesn't necessarily mean there will be 2, or that both games, if there are indeed 2, will be Kalos based (there is still a possibility of a Kanto game in there).  There's no reason to assume that Zygarde will 100% have 2 different forms, just because last gen showed something. Previous gens didn't have anything similar, and there is currently no pattern."
pokemon,3e0aoz,papa_smurphy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:40 2015 UTC,"The point i made with Rotom is when you change Rotom's form, one move changes into another. Same thing with Kyurem. One move never chanfes to two moves because that would complicate things. Zygarde would have to forget a move in order to change form, and then it would be left with only 3 moves when it changed back. Plus, it is obvious that Land's Wrath and the 2 Thousand moves are 3 alternate versions of the same move. It makes no sense to have 3 alternate moves and only 2 alternate forms. The fact of the matter is there IS reason to assume Zygarde will 100% have 2 forms, and that we will get 2 more gen 6 games as paired games in Kalos. I dont know why you are in denial when there is sufficient proof."
pokemon,3e0aoz,KaSlaps,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not in denial. I've never once said that there will not be 2 games coming, I've just said there is no decisive proof to say there will in fact be 2. Stop putting words in my mouth.  Again, Kyurem is the only time so far that we have had 2 games based on the same Pokemon, with 2 alternate forms. There is currently no pattern to assume it'll happen again as there has only been one time that it has before."
pokemon,3e0aoz,papa_smurphy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"It doesnt matter if there's been no pattern. I'm not talking about patterns. I'm talking about the evidence i've already mentioned. That evidence is enough proof that there will be two new Zygarde forms and 2 new kalos games. Thats the obvious and most likely conclusion. And besides, why make a Pokemon Z and you can make 2 games and make even more profits?"
pokemon,3e0aoz,Dark-Scar,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"According to those that went to see the movie and saw the teaser, there were pulsating hexagons on the body of the new Pokemon which is further evidence it is related to Zygarde."

However, the background and frame are different, so perhaps just a fake? I don't know the TCG series, so it could just be that's the differences between the holo and non-holo as well.  Edit: There's a typo in the description of Restore. I'd count on just a fake."

pokemon,3dzbi1,Mockturne,3,Mon Jul 20 19:29:08 2015 UTC,I thought about it. But they're pretty pricy and my brother had Gold so I borrowed it from him.
pokemon,3dzbi1,Mockturne,2,Mon Jul 20 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"My original gold had the battery finally die last year, so now it can't save.  I don't know how yours is but I got mine when it first came out.  I've heard similar stories from others so just be aware they're starting to die off.  Red's still going strong, oddly enough.  Breeding and genders are new to that gen.  No abilities yet and while the dark and steel types are introduced to balance typing, there are still issues.  No fairy type, and the physical/special split for moves hadn't happened yet.  You should find it's the perfect sequel to gen 1, especially when you fight the final trainer at the end (who I won't mention in case you don't know who it is).  Arguably the best in the serious.  I'm jealous I can't go back and experience it for the first time, so enjoy!"

pokemon,3dzbi1,kongsnutz,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:02 2015 UTC,Honestly Gen 2 was my favourite (I love crystal)  I chose chikorita for the challenge since it is a tough starter to begin with but my favourite pokemon overall.  I used the cell phone as a gimmick (made a girlfriend and everything)   I invested my self as the character and enjoyed the game playing it through really making my team memorable. Playing through it rather than worrying about gen 6 qualities (breeding and iv's etc) is what will make it more fun
pokemon,3dzbi1,RavenMJ74,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"My only tip is, GOLD/SILVER/CRYSTAL  are probably the longest of the Pokemon games because once you finish the main story, there is Kanto region from RED/BLUE/YELLOW to finish. (Thanks Iwata R.I.P)   The game has 16 badges all up, so expect some time to be put in."

pokemon,3dvfug,howlinggladiator,2,Mon Jul 20 05:02:06 2015 UTC,It would be awesome but we have to remember Pokemon is a children's game (apparently even though I could swear the majority of the audience is over 18 at this point) so they wouldn't create a game that promotes negative attitudes.
pokemon,3dvfug,6poon_slayer9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Mokepon, though I haven't been keeping up with it lately."
pokemon,3dvfug,chatsubobar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:05 2015 UTC,"I'd like if there was something like this buy with more freedom of choice. The games always talk about how Pokemon develop according to their trainers, so you could play as a cruel person who raises vicious Pokemon."
pokemon,3dvfug,Jacksane,6,Sun Jul 19 22:33:43 2015 UTC,The problem with that is that the central theme of Pokemon is friendship. This would be going against that.

pokemon,3dtn5j,domeforaklondikebar,27,Sun Jul 19 10:43:34 2015 UTC,Not sure why nobody noted that during the previous showing.

pokemon,3dtn5j,skippingmud,22,Sun Jul 19 11:44:50 2015 UTC,It reminds us of something very familiar.
pokemon,3dtn5j,domeforaklondikebar,13,Sun Jul 19 11:52:12 2015 UTC,Zygarde.
pokemon,3dtn5j,skippingmud,22,Sun Jul 19 11:53:02 2015 UTC,"So according to Serebii's friend, the lil blob has a red belly."
pokemon,3dtn5j,Kitsune-Smirk,22,Sun Jul 19 10:33:09 2015 UTC,"That makes it much more different from Zygarde, so it could really be a brand new Pokemon!"
pokemon,3dtn5j,notwiththeflames,15,Sun Jul 19 10:38:23 2015 UTC,Indeed it could.
pokemon,3dtn5j,creyk,8,Sun Jul 19 10:47:44 2015 UTC,Part Ghost type?
pokemon,3dtn5j,Trainer_Kevin,15,Sun Jul 19 11:24:23 2015 UTC,"The little guy looks a lot cuter than it did in the previous sketches! Now that I think about it, this reminds me of when several Generation IV Pokémon were revealed around 2004, right in the middle of the gap between the two generations and being featured in a couple of the spinoffs and movies way earlier than they usually do for new-gen mons. Do you think they're doing something similar this time as well, teasing all sorts of Gen VII things long before its debut?"
pokemon,3dtn5j,InsaneZee,3,Sun Jul 19 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"I imagine so, it certainly ain't out of the question."

pokemon,3dtn5j,joescool,22,Sun Jul 19 14:26:16 2015 UTC,"Simple, he's not in the current games."
pokemon,3dtn5j,xayezi,-12,Sun Jul 19 14:27:11 2015 UTC,But he would be attainable in X/Y and OR/AS right? Isn't there a hidden database of all Pokemon that can exist in every game? I assumed hackers got the information from there.
pokemon,3dtn5j,ButtholeSmurfer,6,Sun Jul 19 15:05:04 2015 UTC,"Nope. Remember, Diancie and Hoopa's secondary forms and multiple Mega forms and Mega stones from ORAS are completely absent from XY. So this little green blob has no data in the current games."
pokemon,3dtn5j,10derek,6,Sun Jul 19 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"We don't know if he would be attainable in X/Y or not, but most probably not. He's probably a Pokémon from Generation 7, which explains why he isn't in the games"
pokemon,3dtn5j,Indigo-2184,2,Sun Jul 19 15:08:28 2015 UTC,"You can't send a gem 6 poke to a gen 5 game. Because this Pokemon was never in the files, that means that it's probably a gem 7 Pokemon. I am thinking a grass or water starter"
pokemon,3dtn5j,Mattarias,9,Sun Jul 19 15:38:18 2015 UTC,Is there nobody from Reddit that is going to theaters in Tokyo for watching the movie and that us can give more info?

pokemon,3du9em,volcarona6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:21:31 2015 UTC,What about Flare Blitz? That's a physical fire move that Flareon learns.

pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,6,Sun Jul 19 17:07:11 2015 UTC,The same reason I chose the name is the same reason they chose it: it's derpy and befitting.
pokemon,3du9em,greengardenskiddo,6,Sun Jul 19 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"It actually came to mind... and then of course thought of Raikou. I was trying to think of something that might fit in with the other priority moves of a similar kind (bullet punch, aqua jet, quick attack, mach punch, ice shard, etc.). Zap does seem to imply speed."

pokemon,3du9em,joescool,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea for the name. Strike, like the Zap suggestion above, implies speed."
pokemon,3du9em,ShortchangeParamecia,3,Sun Jul 19 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"Thunder Jolt? They use the name in SSB for a super quick attack, so it would fit."
pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,8,Sun Jul 19 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"Vandalize: One of the opponents stats randomly lowers harshly  So, it'd be like playing a game of chance, kinda like with Swagger. You might lower one of their main stats, but you may also lower something useless like the Spe. Attack stat on a very mainly Ph. Attacker.  Think it'd be a great Dark Type move."
pokemon,3du9em,Metalhead62,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"Make it something like the ability Moody. Drop a random stat 1 stage, raise another one 1stages. That way it won't be too broken."
pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,4,Sun Jul 19 19:11:53 2015 UTC,"Id say drop 2 stages raise 1 stage wouldn't be too bad. I doubt it would get much competitive use because of the luck factor, but yeah."

pokemon,3du9em,tensionSHEET,3,Sun Jul 19 16:28:35 2015 UTC,It probably should've read as Status moves as in stuff like Swagger and Leech Seed and Scary Face.

pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,8,Sun Jul 19 19:35:22 2015 UTC,Vaporize Fire Type -- BP 5 PP 30 ACC   Basically a fire-type OHKO move.
pokemon,3du9em,ShortchangeParamecia,12,Sun Jul 19 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"The name to me implies a Fire Type move powerful enough to be Super Effective against Water Types.  Maybe something more brutal, like Cremate."

pokemon,3du9em,sherekhantwait,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:55 2015 UTC,Not as brutal as Cremate which means to turn (usually dead bodies) into ash.
pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,4,Sun Jul 19 19:04:42 2015 UTC,And Vaporize still sounds better and makes more sense. You're not going to evaporate other pokemon
pokemon,3du9em,461weavile,3,Sun Jul 19 22:32:59 2015 UTC,Both have vapor in them insinuating effectiveness against water more than anything. Cremate makes the most sense turning everything to mere ashes.

pokemon,3du9em,461weavile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:09:42 2015 UTC,It's already a move that renders uneaten berries useless.

pokemon,3du9em,sweetcutie,0,Sun Jul 19 20:47:03 2015 UTC,Still obnoxiously unbalanced
pokemon,3du9em,tensionSHEET,7,Sun Jul 19 22:31:12 2015 UTC,wt happens to pokemon with both fire and ice weakness(grass)
pokemon,3du9em,Brandan182,13,Sun Jul 19 16:18:19 2015 UTC,then it's 4x super effective!
pokemon,3du9em,kotoandjuri,3,Sun Jul 19 16:27:22 2015 UTC,What if it's 4x weak to fire but immune to ice for whatever reason
pokemon,3du9em,050,7,Sun Jul 19 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"If you swapped the types you listed, you could have an actual example.  A Salamence that has been Skill Swapped Flash Fire would not take the damage, just as a Ghost/X will still gain immunity to Fighting/Normal."
pokemon,3du9em,xxthunder256xx,4,Sun Jul 19 17:43:17 2015 UTC,Then the move would do no damage
pokemon,3du9em,buchanandoug,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:42 2015 UTC,RIP in pieces

pokemon,3du9em,buchanandoug,10,Sun Jul 19 17:44:05 2015 UTC,A chance of flinching could work instead due to electric types being immune to paralysis.
pokemon,3du9em,kotoandjuri,7,Sun Jul 19 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"Because electric types can't be paralyzed. I actually thought that would be better, but since X and Y that is impossible."
pokemon,3du9em,buchanandoug,5,Sun Jul 19 18:22:30 2015 UTC,Got it. I thought they'd only gained an immunity to T-Wave and other electric based paralysis. Thanks for the correction.
pokemon,3du9em,Aw_,4,Sun Jul 19 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"I wish. If that were the case, paralysis would have easily been part of the move."

pokemon,3du9em,SgtPepper6,9,Sun Jul 19 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"If they made elemantal stealth-rocks, it should be set up so that if you set up one, another one would override it. So no stacking crazy shit like Ice and Rock and Fire stealth rocks."

pokemon,3du9em,GloboX38,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:32:07 2015 UTC,Nope I think every type should simply have an entry hazard. That way everyone has the potential to be screwed over.
pokemon,3du9em,The_BlazeMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:15 2015 UTC,"Stealth Ice and Stealth Rock would be enough to deal 100%, no need for Spikes and Gravity shenanigans."
pokemon,3du9em,GloboX38,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"Ice does 50% because Dragon/Flying are both weak to it (1/8*4 = 1/2).  Rock does 25% because Flying is weak to is (1/8*2 = 1/4).  Triple Spikes do 25% if the user is grounded, which adds up to 100%."
pokemon,3du9em,ShortchangeParamecia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"I think it would do 1/8 x 2 (=1/4) for Dragon's weakness to Ice, × 2 (=1/2) for Flying's weakness to Ice, and × 2 (=1) again for Flying's weakness to Rock, bringing it up to 100%."

pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"Well I was thinking it would be the other ""terrain"" moves. And yeah, extended to all Pokémon on the ground."
pokemon,3du9em,NinjaKnight92,2,Sun Jul 19 18:12:59 2015 UTC,But being entirely named similar to other moves is somewhat boring albeit the elemental fangs and punches would be hard to name otherwize. Neutral Ground sounds much better in terms of giving the pokemon equal footing.
pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,3,Sun Jul 19 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"Except steel and rock types are suddenly OP in this setting, as they resist all and have no weaknesses.

pokemon,3du9em,NinjaKnight92,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:26 2015 UTC,It would make it part of the strategy.
pokemon,3du9em,IggyKami,4,Sun Jul 19 18:47:36 2015 UTC,It would give flygon a small edge over garchomp I guess.
pokemon,3du9em,461weavile,2,Sun Jul 19 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"Use Neutral Ground, opponent switches to let's say Metagross, player switches in Magnezone with Magnet Pull, it then becomes a chip battle."

pokemon,3du9em,Proximal_Proximity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Considering the creator intends for it to be similar to the Terrain moves, Neutral Ground is perfect. Equalize assumes Flying pokemon are also affected while the Terrain moves only affect same type moves (aside from Misty Terrain halving damage of Dragon type moves) and pokemon on the ground."

pokemon,3du9em,aravar27,3,Sun Jul 19 17:20:47 2015 UTC,If it's an entry hazard it should cause the opponent to become instantly soaked and turned to Water type or something negative. Not a hazard if it's not damaging/disadvantaging others.

pokemon,3dzmac,KenTrole,6,Mon Jul 20 20:38:23 2015 UTC,It'd never live up to the expectations people have for it.
pokemon,3dzmac,MarcheM,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"1) Pokemon is set up a bit like a theme park MMO anyway. You go to different areas and build your strength based on what's offered up to that point, and then build on those things to achieve success. In WoW, that's gear you get from questing and monsters. In pokemon, it's the monsters.  2) ""Endgame"" is a big part of the modern MMO, and Pokemon arguably has some of the best PVP endgame out there. In games like World of Warcraft, you either go through enough PvP matches to accumulate better gear and then continue this process until you have the best gear possible, or go through PvE Raids to accumulate better gear for the task. Pokemon has great PvP endgame in its competitive scene, with breeding and item accumulation through PvE tournament battles.  However, Pokemon doesn't ""really"" have PvE endgame, and I can't really see how this would be at all possible. I can't conceive of a way to have a ""Raid"" in the same sense as other modern MMOs. You could go the Diablo route and make endgame PvE based off randomly generated dungeons, I suppose, but that'd be difficult to do with the puzzle-based dungeons that Pokemon traditionally relies on. There are solutions to the lack of PvE endgame, but I have difficulty coming up with one that retains the spirit of the game beyond the constant repetition of the ""Elite 4"" endgame in the earlier generations.  3) Balancing. The 6 v 6 single battle format is incredibly unbalanced. There are many strategies that someone can use to ""break"" the format, or at least make it so that the player's primary enemy is the mechanics of the game itself. Look up ""Funbro"", for instance. It's really easy to abuse the sleep mechanic as well, or to just use a team of pokemon that aren't considered legendaries, but still fundamentally decentralize certain parts of the game. This is why Smogon exists with its excess of rules to limit certain pokemon in the game itself. Nintendo does, to a degree, recognize the problems with this format and so it uses doubles as its official VGC tournament method. But this isn't the way that most players (Children and Casual gamers) traditionally think of the game being played. As a general rule, Nintendo tends to favor the casual gamers and the rest of the community is left to make what they can of whatever is left.  4) Format. Pokemon is, was, and has always intended to be for the handheld system. It's a children's game at its roots, and the intention was always to have children play the game on handheld consoles, bring them to school and their friend's houses to trade and battle. It's not designed for a PC, which isn't to say that it wouldn't work, but it's also one of the big names that they have attached to their handheld console releases. It's pretty hard to imagine a Nintendo handheld that doesn't have a native pokemon game on it, and it would be very difficult to justify a simultaneous release on both PC and console when you take that into consideration.  5) I will note that I can see a pokemon MMO being released with limited, if not all functionality. But not until the handheld gaming market and online gaming become tied so strongly that these functions become a given. If Nintendo's foray into the smartphone gaming market is successful, then I can definitely see this happening in the next decade or so. But until the gap is closed between what we consider PC online gaming and handheld gaming, then a licensed Pokemon MMO probably won't happen."

It would really be nice to just be told the IVs of your pokemon, and maybe have a way to raise/lower them by 1 for hidden powers. I am thinking of something like the ability capsules you get from the battle maison, or a berry that needs a lot of breeding and care.  EVa are fine now, I think, since hordes and super training have been introduced, but it would still be nice to be able to see the actual numbers in the EVs your Pokemon has.

The pokemon has its natural ability, moves, and stats. It is the same exact pokemon as if you bred one hundred eggs.

pokemon,3du4u7,Thotaz,4,Mon Jul 20 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"If I get a friend to rob a bank (hack the ditto), and have him give me the money (trade me the ditto), then the house I buy (the nice offspring) is obviously not something I deserved because I got it in a non legitimate way. Yes, some of the money may have been my own, but it doesn't change the fact that I wouldn't have gotten it without the bank robbing/cheating."
pokemon,3du4u7,volcarona6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"That analogy is completely unrelated. You are comparing apples to oranges. The problem with that analogy is that robbing the bank gives you the district advantage in having a lot of money quickly for little work (the advantage being buying nice things). The problem is, even if you worked hard you wouldn't make the same amount as  robbing a bank.   On the other hand there is pokemon. You could take two parents of the same species and breed them to get a flawless pokemon. You may get it on the first egg or the 5000. Now let's say you introduce a ditto in the equation. All you are doing is shortening the time. The ditto does not have absurd abilities or stats, and it does not give the offspring any advantage over other pokemon of the same nature and IV's. The pokemon is one hundred percent legal. It is very difficult to use a hacked pokemon in tournaments, and yet you can always use bred pokemon in tournaments.   I'm sorry I am not trying to be rude about it, but to put it plainly you are wrong. There is always room for people's opinions but in this case your argument is flawed and based around an unfair comparison. It is your choice whether or not to use the pokemon, but to stay out of competitive battling for this reason is ignorant in itself."
pokemon,3du4u7,volcarona6,0,Mon Jul 20 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"Something I forgot to add. If I showed you two flawless squirtles at the same level with the same EV's and nature, you wouldn't be able to tell any difference between the two. You could go into the games code, study them, level them up and would find no differences between the two. Both have the original trainer as you, both were received as an egg, both hatched whatever: there would be no difference. The only thing different would be something you couldn't tell at all, which would be the amount of time it took to get that squirtle. With a breeding ditto, you could have gotten the flawless squirtle in about half an hour. With two squirtle parents it could take you an absurd amount of time. I did this method before for a flawless hippodwon in soul silver. It took me about a month with me playing every day for two hours or so. Both squirtles are legit it's just one way was extremely time consuming and tedious and the other was efficient and effective."

If you'd like, I can also trade you some of my 3 IV Ditto caught in Omega Ruby using DexNav. It should make breeding a lot easier. I can also trade breedjects, but since some of those breedjects had parents from Pokemon Trades, they may have had 6IV Ditto parents originally, I don't know. PM me if you want to trade!"
pokemon,3du4u7,Benvironment,2,Tue Jul 21 07:38:56 2015 UTC,"If I was looking to simplify things, I'd keep IVs but make them a set total, with the IVs distributed semi-randomly. That way, every Pokémon is still different and the IVs can still be customized, but every Pokémon is at least theoretically as strong."
pokemon,3du4u7,neilarthurhotep,6,Sun Jul 19 19:09:14 2015 UTC,I feel like at that point it would be easier to remove IVs completely and do the customization aspect completely through EVs.
pokemon,3du4u7,Benvironment,0,Sun Jul 19 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree that it would be easier, I just think that keeping a semi-random total would be more in spirit with the ""each Pokémon is unique"" thing that the games do."
pokemon,3du4u7,Vladkar,2,Sun Jul 19 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think they could just combine IVs and EVs into something more intuitive.  I really don't think IVs add much to the game, besides creating a barrier to competitive play. It's not like breeding is challenging, it's just time consuming and tedious. Breeding a good pokemon is a chore, not an accomplishment. I'd rather spend my time battling and you know, having fun."
pokemon,3du4u7,MasterCheftheChief,83,Mon Jul 20 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"No more event legendaries.

pokemon,3du4u7,AtomicBlackJellyfish,30,Sun Jul 19 16:29:50 2015 UTC,Or at least limit it to one event per generation. The past three gens have had three or four each and it's just tedious at this point.
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon-Snake,15,Sun Jul 19 17:27:22 2015 UTC,"It's even more ridiculous with this Gen, because there's only 3 new regular legendaries but still 3 events, and there isn't even a minor legendary at all. That's never happened before."
pokemon,3du4u7,gregguy12,10,Sun Jul 19 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"In addition to no small legendary like you said, there's also no legendary trio. Seems like they were trying to mix the two with the event mons Edit: The minor legendary trio."
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon-Snake,13,Sun Jul 19 19:23:20 2015 UTC,Actually we do have one trio this gen- the XYZ Trio. The cover Pokemon always make a trio (since Gen III at least.)
pokemon,3du4u7,gregguy12,5,Sun Jul 19 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"I meant more the other trio. For instance, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. The beasts of Johto, The Regis of Hoenn, The pixies of Sinnoh and the Musketeers of Unova. They're mostly minor but still legendaries."
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon-Snake,3,Mon Jul 20 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"My bad, I didn't realize you were referring to the non-cover legends trio. In that case, I am also disappointed in the lack of more non-event legendaries. I guess it fits with introducing the smallest amount of new Pokemon ever."

pokemon,3du4u7,ShortchangeParamecia,4,Mon Jul 20 06:10:16 2015 UTC,Let's just hope they have great starters again. I mean they broke the starter tradition before it was even made by having Bulbasaur be part Poison (which I don't understand to this day.)

You can dump entire boxes into a game in less than a minute.  This is how GF makes money, they aren't going to just hand you every Pokemon in a single game. They already gave us X/Y and ORAS where we can capture every non-Dex-Diploma-required Pokemon-including legends-between the games.

pokemon,3du4u7,Faren107,4,Sun Jul 19 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you technically didn't catch them all, and while the game doesn't count them, it just feels more accomplishing to have them too."
pokemon,3du4u7,Hanta3,3,Sun Jul 19 19:03:54 2015 UTC,They don't care is my point. They've given you the mean to capture all of the ones that matter in regards to anything in-game.

pokemon,3du4u7,TheSlimyDog,21,Sun Jul 19 15:29:48 2015 UTC,Or at least make them useful. Strength could be a 100 BP move with a secondary effect for instance. Cut is also pretty sad..
pokemon,3du4u7,Lylat97,5,Sun Jul 19 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"Rock Smash could have a 100% chance of an effect similar to Brick Break or Power-Up Punch, Cut could have a high crit ratio and/or 60 BP (making it good on Technician Pokémon), and Strength could have a flinch chance or higher BP.

pokemon,3du4u7,timmy4513,6,Sun Jul 19 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"Strength should just be changed types.  It's strong enough, it's just useless as a normal move.  Rock would be best in regards to minimal changes, I feel."

pokemon,3du4u7,menace64,15,Sun Jul 19 19:34:05 2015 UTC,Moves like Cut and Rock Smash are sad because you get them at the beginning of a game almost always. They can't give you OP moves at the start. Maybe have HM's power depend on number of badges or something. That might help.
pokemon,3du4u7,sanicisbatman,4,Tue Jul 21 06:01:09 2015 UTC,"Just allow certain pokemon to perform corresponding HM moves by default. Any flying type can ""Fly"", any water type can ""Surf"", any pokemon with any sort of claws, ect can use ""Cut""...You get the idea."
pokemon,3du4u7,BaconIsntThatGood,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:00 2015 UTC,even better
pokemon,3du4u7,truedragonemperor,24,Mon Jul 20 02:14:29 2015 UTC,But then you'd be forced to have 3-5 HM slaves instead of just one which makes things worse. Maybe have a system where you can use a key item from your bag or something.
pokemon,3du4u7,MrDingusKhan,23,Tue Jul 21 06:02:59 2015 UTC,I think they might abolish HM's overall so the move deleter won't affect the player anymore. That would be a huge simplification.
pokemon,3du4u7,truedragonemperor,3,Sun Jul 19 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"Make them actual hidden moves. For crying out loud, Machamp doesn't need to be taught how to move a heavy boulder.  It's you the trainer who needs to become savvy enough to realize it can be done. Once you've collected 4 badges, you're wise enough to go, ""Oh hey, Machamp, remember that boulder on Route 6? You can lift that out of the way, right?""  And then any Pokemon with the Strength hidden move can be used to move boulders. BAM. No more hassle."
pokemon,3du4u7,MrDingusKhan,2,Sun Jul 19 20:01:52 2015 UTC,That would be an interesting concept but idk if gamefreak would try and stereotype it to a specific pokemon. Because the story would have to indicate that
pokemon,3du4u7,iPippy,13,Mon Jul 20 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"Why would gamefreak go through all that effort, just let the pokemon that can already learn those HMs do it."
pokemon,3du4u7,ShortchangeParamecia,7,Mon Jul 20 20:50:18 2015 UTC,How about make them deletable but STILL have them required to go through the world and obtain rare items through rock climb/waterfall.
pokemon,3du4u7,VeeNVeeN,12,Sun Jul 19 16:02:54 2015 UTC,Isn't the point of making then non-removable so that you don't get stuck somewhere?
pokemon,3du4u7,ShortchangeParamecia,6,Sun Jul 19 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"But if you're stuck just slap the HM on a Pokemon with a TM move, get out of there, then switch the moves back."
pokemon,3du4u7,BaconIsntThatGood,8,Sun Jul 19 16:09:23 2015 UTC,Good point. Since the TMs are reusable this would totally work.

This Doesn't heal pokemon, just let you rotate your party easily. That way we can have a ""hard"" mode of just using the same party or a casual in which you can rotate your party to the situation  It would also solve the HM issue by letting you switch party members on the fly. (Need to cut a tree? Better bring back out the old bidoof to handle it, then return it to the box).  It could ""lose"" reception deep in caves to not make it totally broken"
pokemon,3du4u7,sarinn13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS  Like, you can carry a total of 12 Pokémon around with you, but only 6 of them can be in your party at a time, and the other 6 are in a mini-PC you can always access that doesn't heal your Pokémon.  Maybe there can also be a key item called an Incubator that lets you carry eggs outside of your team, and automatically sends hatched eggs to the PC?"

pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,5,Sun Jul 19 18:24:51 2015 UTC,Woobat was fairly uncommon in BW and zubat was only found in one small cave in XY (where it wasn't even that common an encounter).  The mere fact that it's entirely possible to beat XY without seeing a wild zubat without using repels is kind of insane.
pokemon,3du4u7,VeeNVeeN,9,Tue Jul 21 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"Remove some of the moves that do the same thing. Like Play Nice and Growl are essentially the same thing, and Water gun is useless now because bubble is identical so cut one of those, also abilities that do the same thing, cut those.  Also maybe introducing a system where you can see the type of the Pokemon beside it's name. Personally It'd ruin the sense of discovery and guessing for new Pokemon but I think for new players it'd help a lot,"
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,3,Sun Jul 19 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"Some of those moves/abilities are kept for flavor, though. Like, it sounds better for Noctowl to have Insomnia than Vital Spirit, or for Exeggutor to have Barrage rather than Double Slap."
pokemon,3du4u7,VeeNVeeN,3,Sun Jul 19 20:53:24 2015 UTC,True but it is the best way I can think of to simplify the battle system and not ruin the game.
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,5,Sun Jul 19 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"Growl and Play nice are still pretty different though. Yeah they both reduce opponent's Attack by a stage, but:   Growl has 100% accuracy so it can miss, it's sound-based so it's blocked by Soundproof and bypasses Substitute, and it hits all adjacent enemies. Play Nice is -- accuracy so it cannot ever miss (except from Fly or similar moves or a Substitute) and can even hit through Protect, but it can only hit one opponent.   They aren't the same and neither is better than the other, they're ""sidegrades."" There are a lot of moves that look the same in a typical battle but actually function differently in certain scenarios."

pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,3,Sun Jul 19 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"This generation feels pretty simple as it is. Breeding for good Pokemon is easier, getting Battle Points (and items) is easier, moving Pokémon between games is easier thanks to the PokéBank, Secret Bases make leveling incredibly easy (though this is a community thing), and getting hidden ability Pokes is easy too (again, mostly due to community). ORAS even teleports the player past the annoying ""Go back to Petalburg, now back to Mauville"" part.  I guess they could give us Fly sooner to make traveling easier.  But I do want a certain amount of complexity, at least in the end game. That's why I liked Generation IV. The Battle Area had a bunch of places to explore and made you use your HM Pokémon. Assigning HMs more to the Bag would lighten this by a great deal, but they could still add more to the Battle Area-esque... area to make you want to go through everything. I don't really feel like Gens V and VI have very much end game content."
pokemon,3du4u7,BackSansCanon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:17 2015 UTC,Make Legendaries and Event Pokemon to have at least 5 perfect IVs instead of 3.
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,13,Tue Jul 21 08:15:44 2015 UTC,"That would make things SO much simpler. This way, you only have to SR like 6 times instead of like 5731894!"
pokemon,3du4u7,BackSansCanon,16,Tue Jul 21 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"Make all IVs 31. It's a legacy thing at this point and only hinders new players trying to get into competitive. Not to mention actually encourages hacking and cloning legendaries.  The only thing reliant on IVs in the current game structure is the personality values (likes to take siestas, quick to flee, etc) and the move Hidden Power. Personality values aren't needed at all. If they really want to keep them then just add another 0-31 random number to assign one of the traits that way. For Hidden Power it could easily be broken into a Move Tutor that teaches a different Hidden Power for each type. This would also allow Hidden Power Fairy to be integrated into the game.  To integrate it into new generations without breaking the old all that would be needed is to set every new Pokemon IV values from generation 7 forward to being 31 and transferred Pokemon get their Values bumped up to 31 and are assigned a new personality value. If need be you could either default the old generation Hidden Power to Normal type or force imported Pokemon to forget the move before moving forward.  EVs and Nature allow for plenty of Pokemon stat diversity. The only thing this really hinders is when special attackers set their Attack IVs to 0 or Trick Room users set their Speed to 0. But this is such a small subset that it would have basically no impact on the meta.  They've already been shown to pander to the competitive crowd by making breeding easier. But why not just take out all the needless complications that are the root of the problem? Now instead of resetting for days to get the right IVs, and Nature on that legendary you just need the nature. And a Synchronizer turns that into a 50/50 chance! That random Shiny you just caught but can't use because it wasn't super inbred to have 12 more Attack Points. You can use it now! How many times have you seen someone try to get into competitive but then they get swamped by guide after guide explaining that back in the day they decided each Pokemon had to be super duper unique and gave them 6 arbitrary random numbers and everything they've been using is basically obsolete? Well now it's a thing of the past!  Seriously GameFreak just do it."
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of reasons not to do that. Trick room teams run 0 speed IVs to get as slow as possible. And some people run 0 Attack IVs on special attackers to lower the damage taken by confusion. Other than that I can see your point. It would be a big hit to people who like breeding. I enjoy breeding for IVs personally. I get a sense of gratification from finally getting the one I want. I'd miss that part, but I can understand the idea of simplifying it for newcomers."
pokemon,3du4u7,EchoingSong,0,Sun Jul 19 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"You would still be able to breed for abilities, natures, and egg moves. While I like the idea of breeding it's become too separated from the competitive aspect of the game. Like I said the majority of Competitive Pokemon on cartridge are in some way hacked. 6 31 IV Ditto Parents, Cloned Legends, etc. It should not take more than an hour of grind work to produce a competitive level Pokemon. Let alone days or weeks of resetting a legend.  I also mentioned the 0 Speed and Attack IVs and the result is simple. The new lowest stat is a negative nature and 0 EVs. This would be a minimal impact on the competitive game while taking out a grind that a majority of players find a hassle and bridges the gap between casual and competitive."
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,6,Sun Jul 19 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"It would be a decent simplification. Just not overly necessary I think. Plus I would miss the grind, it's very nice to do when I need something to dull my mind to fall asleep."
pokemon,3du4u7,BackSansCanon,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:27 2015 UTC,If the end state is simplified game play then I think this is a necessary step.   And if you miss the grind you can always make your whole comp team shiny ;)
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,3,Sun Jul 19 21:34:06 2015 UTC,"If you want simplified gameplay, just don't concern yourself with competitive pokemon. The vast majority of players don't and have tons of fun with the game as is. Pokemon is as simple as you want it to be.  Simplifying competitive pokemon for the sake of simplification isn't doing anyone interested in competitive any real favors."
pokemon,3du4u7,EchoingSong,2,Sun Jul 19 21:46:44 2015 UTC,Simplifying competitive pokemon for the sake of simplification isn't doing anyone interested in competitive any real favors.   Yes it is.

pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,2,Sun Jul 19 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"There can be merit in simplifying aspects of the game, but I don't feel it is proper to do so if the only merit is simplification itself. Given a specific reason/goal for simplification? Sure, I'll bite.  Also, I'm aware of the point of this thread. The emphasis of my comment was on the ""for the sake of simplification"" aspect. The OP brings up simplifying IVs. In mentioning doing so in a fashion similar to Super Training, and making it easier to get good IVs, I can easily side with. In fact, steps have already been taken via a buffed Destiny Knot, DexNav, Legendaries, etc., and I wouldn't argue against a more explicit way of simplifying the system as EVs have been. With that in mind, outright elimination of IVs is something I'm inherently against."
pokemon,3du4u7,EchoingSong,6,Sun Jul 19 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"With that in mind, outright elimination of IVs is something I'm inherently against.   We'll have to agree to disagree there.   But if we had the ability to use a BP Capsule or ""IV Super Training"" that could change IVs then why bother in the first place?"
pokemon,3du4u7,brownsfan125,6,Sun Jul 19 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with this.   It's a legacy thing at this point and only hinders new players trying to get into competitive.    When I got into competitive pokemon way back (post-DPPt) it wasn't that hard. Each stat has a varied boost between 0-31 that can get randomly passed on via breeding? Got it. Hidden experience divisible by 4 for each stat, you can only get them from specific pokemon? Got it. Back then, competitive was mostly on simulators. Things like NetBattle, Shoddy Battle, etc. If you were really interested, you'd eventually find Smogon and be on your merry way.  I see you touch upon it later in your post, but it is incredibly simple now to breed perfect pokemon. ""Reject"" pokemon with 3, 4, sometimes 5 IVs are relatively common on WonderTrade, and introduce players to a variety of leeways into raising a strong pokemon that they wouldn't otherwise have access to or have considered. I've bred competitive pokemon simply because I got a cool looking one on WT and thought ""Hey, this guy was almost on to something! I wanna try that too.""   With simple access to WT, tools in the form of Destiny Knot and Everstone on top of this, the perfect area to do so in the form of the Battle Resort, as well as a new age of online interactivity, anyone who is interested in entering the world of pokemon breeding should find that IVs are the easiest part of competitive pokemon. The best part is that there are always people online and communities that are willing to help you out. I'd argue, if anything, the hardest thing to do is to get over biases towards your own favorite pokemon, as well as learning in-depth strategy that strongly differs from in-game.   Not to mention actually encourages hacking and cloning legendaries.   I imagine for most people interested in hacking, perfect stats are just a tacked on thing just because you can. In other words, those teams you see where it's all shiny legendaries with the best moves and stats? The stats were secondary to Timmy getting his ""holy shit badass"" team.   The only thing reliant on IVs in the current game structure is the personality values (likes to take siestas, quick to flee, etc) and the move Hidden Power. Personality values aren't needed at all   That's not what personality values are. What you're referring to is known as a characteristic, which is mostly flavorful, but can eliminate possible IVs for a given stat. Not as important for most as the stat judges in the various games.   If they really want to keep them then just add another 0-31 random number to assign one of the traits that way. For Hidden Power it could easily be broken into a Move Tutor that teaches a different Hidden Power for each type. This would also allow Hidden Power Fairy to be integrated into the game.   The point of Hidden Power is that it is different for each pokemon, inherently. If you could just teach every pokemon whatever type of Hidden Power you wanted, the ""lore"" of the move is rendered moot. I don't agree with an alternative being put in place for Hidden Power, but for the sake of discussion I'd propose that a Hidden Power based on personality value would be the better alternative, as that would still allow randomness, as well as HP Fairy.   To integrate it into new generations without breaking the old all that would be needed is to set every new Pokemon IV values from generation 7 forward to being 31 and transferred Pokemon get their Values bumped up to 31 and are assigned a new personality value. If need be you could either default the old generation Hidden Power to Normal type or force imported Pokemon to forget the move before moving forward.   That is a bigger issue than you may think, given various components of pokemon legality. In order to do this, you'd have to completely recreate the pokemon upon transfer, virtually rendering it a different pokemon. Also, not only can Hidden Power not be normal, but it'd be pointless to have a Normal Hidden Power. From a flavor/ standpoint, Hidden Power is meant to be a obscured element of the pokemon's inner being. With Normal typing being a neutral presence. A neutral ""core"" for a pokemon via Hidden Power doesn't fit at all what Hidden Power represents: variety.   EVs and Nature allow for plenty of Pokemon stat diversity. The only thing this really hinders is when special attackers set their Attack IVs to 0 or Trick Room users set their Speed to 0. But this is such a small subset that it would have basically no impact on the meta.   This ignores competitive pokemon who need to use a 29 HP IV in order to maximize their usage of Life Orb in conjunction of Hidden Power. The argument of disconnecting Hidden Power from IVs themselves naturally arises here, but the point stands that, as is, there is viable usage for IVs that are not 31, 30, 1, or 0.  This also wildly reduces diversity for casual players by a factor of over ONE BILLION. Instead of nearly countless stats for wild pokemon, ignoring level and ability we now see a total of 21 different stat layouts possible. There are 25 natures, but Hardy, Docile, Serious, Bashful, and Quirky are functionally identical. This makes wild pokemon feel much less ""naturally"" varied.  In regards to variance arising from EVs, yes, there is higher variance with that, standing at approx. 247 million combinations. That is, however, purely for randomly distributed and fully trained stats for a pokemon. Beyond that, the number goes over 6 billion.   With that said, the stats your own pokemon receive are not so randomized. For example, a casual player takes their Wartortle into Mt. Moon to train it a bit. The easiest route is to spam water gun on the incredibly common Geodude. This natural tendency in training early on will inherently encourage a boosted DEF stat compared to anything else. Other examples are easy to find in other areas of the game with common, easily KO'd pokemon.    They've already been shown to pander to the competitive crowd by making breeding easier.    I don't fully agree with this, or at the very least what I'm presuming to be your intent in saying this. By the nature of ""competitiveness"", anyone who is willing to take strives towards being the best and win as much as possible would be fully eager and willing to do whatever it takes to do so. There were dedicated breeders back in the day that would use multiple games and spend weeks breeding the perfect pokemon. Now, I can breed multiple perfect pokemon in a single afternoon, from scratch, and so can anyone else. I maybe poorly phrased that, but in short what I'm trying to say that it isn't so much that easier breeding is a pander to those who are already doing their darnedest to be the best they can, but rather it is a step towards accessibility for those who weren't initially interested in competitiveness to begin with.   But why not just take out all the needless complications that are the root of the problem?    This presumes that complication is a problem to begin with. The majority of players are not affected by this. Changes to inherent properties of a system that have been in place since Generation 3 will alienate hundreds of thousands of dedicated, possibly lifetime players, and all of their hard work. Taking THAT away from people to simplify an aspect of gameplay that the majority of players (keeping in mind the actual demographic of the game) do not actively concern themselves with isn't going to produce any positive changes.   Now instead of resetting for days to get the right IVs, and Nature on that legendary you just need the nature. And a Synchronizer turns that into a 50/50 chance!   The process is already simplified for legendary pokemon, with each of them as of Gen 6 having 3 perfect IVs guaranteed. Instead of billions of possibilities, getting a perfect 6IVs (ignoring that most will only need 5) is now nearly 33,000 times easier.   That random Shiny you just caught but can't use because it wasn't super inbred to have 12 more Attack Points. You can use it now!   Shininess has had nothing to do with how usable a pokemon has been since GSC. In terms of competitiveness and battle efficiency, a regular pokemon is just as usable as a shiny. If someone is truly interested in a pokemon's utility and how it can contribute to them winning, while a shiny is more than preferable,  they should realize it does nothing to increase their win percent. At the end of the day, it's still ""just"" another trophy.   How many times have you seen someone try to get into competitive but then they get swamped by guide after guide explaining that back in the day they decided each Pokemon had to be super duper unique and gave them 6 arbitrary random numbers and everything they've been using is basically obsolete? Well now it's a thing of the past!   It already is a thing of the past. For most players interested in EVs and IVs, the Super Training functions in Gen 6, the DexNav, the stat judge in the battle resort, along with the official website posting a very simple and easy to understand guide on how to train competitive pokemon, should easily suffice for entry level interest. For those more competitively minded, they can use their google-fu and learn where they can learn to swim in the deep end of the pool.    I said this at the beginning of the comment, but I'll repeat it for the sake of emphasis. I disagree entirely with your comment. If anything, with online communities, official competitions, resources in game, and new support from Nintendo and Gamefreak in the forms of improved breeding, super training, competitive coverage, and articles (just to name a few), I would assert that players nowadays have a easier time getting into competitive pokemon at ALL levels than ever before."
pokemon,3du4u7,EchoingSong,6,Sun Jul 19 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"aye yai yai  Alright this is gonna be a roller coaster but the tldr is that you're looking at it from a casual perspective where the whole point of my comment was from a competitive one.   it wasn't that hard. Each stat has a varied boost between 0-31 that can get randomly passed on via breeding? Got it.   Saying it's not that hard is not a good argument for why it's that way. Why not remove a step and make it easier?   ...entering the world of pokemon breeding should find that IVs are the easiest part of competitive pokemon.   That's baloney and you know it. Again, no reason for it being there. Just look at the noob questions thread. Every time there's someone asking what the heck IVs are. There's no reason for them.   I imagine for most people interested in hacking, perfect stats are just a tacked on thing just because you can. In other words, those teams you see where it's all shiny legendaries with the best moves and stats? The stats were secondary to Timmy getting his ""holy shit badass"" team.   A jaunt into VGC will show you the exact opposite. Basically every legendary is cloned because of the massive amount of resetting it takes.   Also, not only can Hidden Power not be normal, but it'd be pointless to have a Normal Hidden Power. From a flavor/ standpoint...   You got me there. Wasn't thinking about HP Normal not existing. But the flavor standpoint is irrelevant. My whole point is that this is a competitive breeding perspective. The variety argument is not a good one though. Hidden Power was just being gimmicky for the sake of making each Pokemon more unique. It's use is a decent Special Attack for something missing coverage. There's no need to make it so difficult to use.   That is a bigger issue than you may think, given various components of pokemon legality. In order to do this, you'd have to completely recreate the pokemon upon transfer, virtually rendering it a different pokemon.   That already happens. New data is added and old is subtracted. Besides, at the end of the day this is a video game we're talking about here. It's all 1s and 0s.   This ignores competitive pokemon who need to use a 29 HP IV in order to maximize their usage of Life Orb in conjunction of Hidden Power. The argument of disconnecting Hidden Power from IVs themselves naturally arises here, but the point stands that, as is, there is viable usage for IVs that are not 31, 30, 1, or 0.   Fair point. I didn't think to include that. Regardless, it's still simpler and would just result in very minute meta changes. A few things might shift around a bit but at the end of the day those won't matter. If you want an even or odd number for Life Orb then dedicate some EVs to HP instead of changing the IVs. instead of 4 possible viable IVs then we reduce it to 1 single one. Again that's the point of the thread, simplicity.   Instead of nearly countless stats for wild pokemon, ignoring level and ability we now see a total of 21 different stat layouts possible   That's plenty of differences. No problem there. Why have needless amounts of variations?   I don't fully agree with this,...I'm trying to say that it isn't so much that easier breeding is a pander to those who are already doing their darnedest to be the best they can, but rather it is a step towards accessibility for those who weren't initially interested in competitiveness to begin with.   That whole paragraph isn't adding anything. Just because competitive players can doesn't mean we want to, or that simpler isn't better. You're only appealing to tradition which is a pointless argument for progress.   This presumes that complication is a problem to begin with. The majority of players are not affected by this.

Bullshit. It wouldn't undermine anything. You yourself just used an example of people spending weeks on multiple systems and now you can do it in an afternoon. Are they undermined for their work? No. They'll move on and adapt just like we would now if it happened tomorrow.    The process is already simplified for legendary pokemon, with each of them as of Gen 6 having 3 perfect IVs guaranteed. Instead of billions of possibilities, getting a perfect 6IVs (ignoring that most will only need 5) is now nearly 33,000 times easier.   You're ok with that but not with making it another several thousand times easier?   Shininess has had nothing to do with how usable a pokemon has been since GSC. In terms of competitiveness and battle efficiency, a regular pokemon is just as usable as a shiny. If someone is truly interested in a pokemon's utility and how it can contribute to them winning, while a shiny is more than preferable, they should realize it does nothing to increase their win percent. At the end of the day, it's still ""just"" another trophy.   Didn't say it did add to how usable it is. But with the new system I'm proposing there are better chances for random encounters to be viable from a competitive standpoint. I don't see what you find wrong with that.   It already is a thing of the past. For most players interested in EVs and IVs, the Super Training functions in Gen 6, the DexNav, the stat judge in the battle resort, along with the official website posting a very simple and easy to understand guide on how to train competitive pokemon, should easily suffice for entry level interest. For those more competitively minded, they can use their google-fu and learn where they can learn to swim in the deep end of the pool.   Why should they have to google it? It could be so much easier if it was gotten rid of. You're missing the entire point of the thread and your entire argument is ""Why bother changing it it's already do-able with a bit of work"". Why not get rid of a large chunk of the work? That's mostly a grind?  You haven't touched any of the statements besides arguing for tradition and as far as I'm concerned all my points still stand."
pokemon,3du4u7,Dragon_Claw,4,Sun Jul 19 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to TL;DR /u/BackSansCanon's post in my interpretation.  You want the perfect Pokemon? You put the work in. The tools are available in-game, if you look.  Making it simpler is taking away the achievement of competitive breeding and training."
pokemon,3du4u7,EchoingSong,2,Sun Jul 19 23:31:04 2015 UTC,I know full well how competitive breeding and training works. But there is no denying that it's a system that is built off unneeded randomness. This is especially apparent when you see people spending days and weeks SRing for a Legend. Competitive breeding and training is a path not the end state. Making it easier only takes away a significantly unneeded grind.
pokemon,3du4u7,BackSansCanon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"Grind and randomness is part of pokemon's appeal in that regard. Just like with other RPGs you actually work for your success! I can agree with putting a system in place that can make the process easier, or maybe a bit less random, but not for elimination of the process altogether!  Replying to the lengthier reply shortly."
pokemon,3du4u7,BackSansCanon,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:58 2015 UTC,Already explained my view on that in this reply
pokemon,3du4u7,kononobunaga,3,Mon Jul 20 00:03:39 2015 UTC,"I'll argue that the grind is not unneeded. This is a JRPG series, grinding is involved.  If you want that perfect legend, SR for it. The randomness is there so that people who are willing to put the work in get rewarded."

The randomness is there so that people who are willing to put the work in get rewarded.   The randomness of that only deters people from that ridiculous level of grinding and either drives them away or makes them resort to hacking. The amount of people that would legitimately SR for all their legends is a tiny minority.  The post asked for how the next gen could be simplified. Removing IVs would vastly simplify the game, maintain the same levels of competitiveness, and make it much easier for anyone to get involved in the competitive scene."
pokemon,3du4u7,dada_,2,Mon Jul 20 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"It would seem that the amount of grinding that we're willing to put up with is different, and that's okay. Perhaps there does need to be an easier way to get perfect stats on a legendary. Is removing IVs the answer? I'd say no.  Absolutely nobody is going to argue with you that removing IVs would make the game simpler.  Is making it simpler in this regard a good thing, though? I'm arguing no because again, I feel that you get out what you put in."
pokemon,3du4u7,pikay93,5,Mon Jul 20 00:08:39 2015 UTC,"You could make IVs assignable attributes and what makes Pokémon different is how many IVs they have to be assigned.  If there isn't enough to make 5 stats perfect, soft reset."
pokemon,3du4u7,key_blader8,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like for Pokemon that can breed, IVs are fine the way they are.   There could possibly be a system for Legendaries where you are able to train their IVs, or by doing something beforehand you increase the number of perfect IVs on said Legend. As long as you still have to work for it."
pokemon,3du4u7,gocow125,3,Mon Jul 20 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"If the grind has a purpose I'm ok with it. EVs, Breeding for moves/abilites etc. There's an end state there. Grinding against an RNG for the sake of it being lolz randoms I just think is stupid. Personal opinion there.  As for the out vs in thing. If that's your thing then by all means. But I've seen the amount of hacking/cloning in competitive and can definitely say IV RNG is a deterrent for people getting into competitive and a driver for more people to hack. So I think it would be a good thing.  But yeah I can understand your viewpoint."
pokemon,3du4u7,SalaBenji,2,Mon Jul 20 00:28:50 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we've reached an understanding.  As I said, I understand the grind isn't for everyone. It's most likely the reason why Showdown and the like are so popular. If people need to clone or hack, so be it as long as the game thinks they're legit. I can't tell the difference, and the fight isn't suddenly unfair for them doing that. I just don't do it because I feel that it cheapens the experience for myself."
pokemon,3du4u7,BaconIsntThatGood,2,Mon Jul 20 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"Apologies if some of these points were touched upon already, but I'm responding to this comment string in the order I see it!   Grinding levels and EVs I'm fine with. Breeding for moves and abilites I'm fine with. What I'm not fine with is the fact that you're telling me the only way to get a competitively viable Legend without cheating is to start a match, catch the pokemon, check its IVs/nature, and reset the game potentially hundreds of times.   Touched upon it in other reply, but I honestly do not see any problem with having to SR a lot for a good legendary. It is intended to be a one of a kind encounter, and it's legendary status, stats, abilities, and so on already give it merit over a lot of pokemon, including perfect stat ones, by default. Wanting perfection from a one of a kind encounter should indeed warrant effort.  Not to sound like a broken record, but I gotta repeat this point I've been making: I'm okay with easier. I'm not okay with complete removal of difficulty.   The randomness of that only deters people from that ridiculous level of grinding and either drives them away or makes them resort to hacking. The amount of people that would legitimately SR for all their legends is a tiny minority.   Pokemon are hacked and cloned because they are valuable. Yes, decreasing incentive to hack and clone is a good thing... but it should be done in a manner that doesn't detract all value of the pokemon.   The post asked for how the next gen could be simplified. Removing IVs would vastly simplify the game, maintain the same levels of competitiveness, and make it much easier for anyone to get involved in the competitive scene.   Removing IVs would absolutely make things simple. No denying that.   But a large part of the game is being rewarded for your efforts. Taking away things you can put effort into detracts from the reward. Sure, streamline the process. Better educate people on the best way to be rewarded. Give them better tools up front so they don't have to rely on google or even cloning/hacking. Just don't take away the reward for the sake of making it easier in terms of effort."
pokemon,3du4u7,SmarfisLove,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"Saying it's not that hard is not a good argument for why it's that way. Why not remove a step and make it easier?   Likewise, I'd argue that saying it isn't outright blatant and the easiest thing to do isn't a reason for why it shouldn't be that way. There can be merit in difficulty/challenge/learning a process/etc. The only real issue I can see is a lack of in-game tools.   That's baloney and you know it. Again, no reason for it being there. Just look at the noob questions thread. Every time there's someone asking what the heck IVs are. There's no reason for them.   A large number of people wanting to understand something doesn't mean that it is difficult to understand. The only argument I see here would be a need for more explicit, in-game elaboration on what IVs are.   A jaunt into VGC will show you the exact opposite. Basically every legendary is cloned because of the massive amount of resetting it takes.   People would still clone shiny legendaries in and outside of VGC with or without IVs in place, I would only presume.   You got me there. Wasn't thinking about HP Normal not existing. But the flavor standpoint is irrelevant. My whole point is that this is a competitive breeding perspective. The variety argument is not a good one though. Hidden Power was just being gimmicky for the sake of making each Pokemon more unique. It's use is a decent Special Attack for something missing coverage. There's no need to make it so difficult to use.   Hidden Power is kinda special in regards to the fact that a pokemon can have access to a type it normal doesn't. If there were just multiple Hidden Powers a pokemon could have at once, it'd be kinda boring to see a pokemon just have ""Generic Fire Move"" and ""Generic Ice Move"" on its moveset.   That, and in-battle Hidden Power is supposed to be a mystery sometimes. There are obvious cases where if it hits Scizor, well it's definitely Hidden Power Fire. But let's say it manages to hit your Charizard? Well, shoot, it can be a whole lot of stuff. Do I send in Steelix to take the Rock type Hidden Power, but what if it was Water? The element of secrecy in that regard adds variety and fun to battles, if albeit situational.   That already happens. New data is added and old is subtracted. Besides, at the end of the day this is a video game we're talking about here. It's all 1s and 0s.   I know, I know, but it's more sentiment than anything. Seeing a perfect stat pokemon I bred nearly 10 years ago become more or less identical to others, and all that work thrown out? Kinda sucks, imo. Weak argument on my part I will openly admit.   Fair point. I didn't think to include that. Regardless, it's still simpler and would just result in very minute meta changes. A few things might shift around a bit but at the end of the day those won't matter. If you want an even or odd number for Life Orb then dedicate some EVs to HP instead of changing the IVs. instead of 4 possible viable IVs then we reduce it to 1 single one. Again that's the point of the thread, simplicity.   I wouldn't be a fan of that. Situational and minute? Of course. There's no denying that. But it introduces inefficiency. If I want my Latios to use Life Orb and Hidden Power Fire, it forces me to decrease my Special Attack from maximum. Then I don't want to use that set anymore. Other players follow accordingly, and some variance is lost in competitive battle. (Okay, maybe a bit of a slippery slope there, but you can see where I'm going).   That's plenty of differences. No problem there. Why have needless amounts of variations?   Just speaking personally here: Lower variance means higher predictability. More predictability means less surprise. Less surprise leads to less excitement. Less excitement means less fun.   That whole paragraph isn't adding anything. Just because competitive players can doesn't mean we want to, or that simpler isn't better. You're only appealing to tradition which is a pointless argument for progress.   I'll give that having a simpler process has made current competitive battling easier for those already invested into it. I suppose what I was trying to emphasize was that, in comparison, the bigger benefit has been for those that have a lesser barrier of entry.   Bullshit. It wouldn't undermine anything. You yourself just used an example of people spending weeks on multiple systems and now you can do it in an afternoon. Are they undermined for their work? No. They'll move on and adapt just like we would now if it happened tomorrow.    Their ""jobs"" became easier in Gen 6. That much can be appreciated. Let's say we migrate to Gen 7, and that work is all gone. Of course people are going to move on, it's pokemon for crying out loud! But you can't tell me that people wouldn't be bummed out over the hours of work, even this generation, becoming meaningless.  I feel that, if simplification of IVs were to occur, it should occur in manner that doesn't cause anyone to be disappointed by the end result. People were happy when they were given better tools to handle a complex system.   You're ok with that but not with making it another several thousand times easier?   If you want a perfect legendary, what can be considered the pinnacle of power, to me it makes sense that you'd have to work much harder for it than for regular pokemon.   Didn't say it did add to how usable it is. But with the new system I'm proposing there are better chances for random encounters to be viable from a competitive standpoint. I don't see what you find wrong with that.   There's nothing wrong with wanting a usable Shiny. I was ecstatic when I got a good Shiny Steelix to ""replace"" my regular one (well, the Shiny was Relaxed and the regular was Impish, so not completely replaceable). My mindset here though is making it more likely for shiny pokemon to be viable doesn't do anything to improve battles. If it doesn't actually improve anything, the change shouldn't be made (at least for that reason).   Why should they have to google it? It could be so much easier if it was gotten rid of. You're missing the entire point of the thread and your entire argument is ""Why bother changing it it's already do-able with a bit of work"". Why not get rid of a large chunk of the work? That's mostly a grind?   I can agree that having to google how a game works isn't the best solution. I was just intending to point out that things as they currently are aren't as bad as you are making them out to be!  With that said, I think it would be better if the game, somewhere, showed you ""Hey kids, here's a hidden mechanic for only the strongest of trainers!"" rather than eliminating it outright. They did it for EVs in a roundabout way, they can totally do it for IVs without eliminating them. I remember hearing that some fan games (Omicron, or something?) had a system in game for explaining IVs and such that worked pretty well. I think if fans can do it, Nintendo could do it too."
pokemon,3du4u7,bagofags,3,Mon Jul 20 00:44:48 2015 UTC,"Setting all IVs to 31 would detract from the spirit of the game. Pokémon are meant to be unique companions and friends. If they all have perfect IVs then every Pidgey is essentially the same as every other Pidgey. There is nothing to differentiate one pokémon from another of the same species. Yes, there could still be variations in EVs, natures, abilities, and movesets, but this leaves only a handful of different combinations. It's not realistic because no two individuals from any real life species are created equal like that. Further, it's what gives the games an element of complexity and keeps older players engaged. As a guy in his mid-twenties, this would severely limit the game's replay value for me.  Just my $0.02, but it would really turn me off the series if they did this. It feels like we would have a bunch of cookie-cutter 'mons. I really hope GF does not eliminate IVs in Gen VII."

I'm cool with that if it's just flavor text but the variety doesn't need to be random IVs that basically guarantee every wild encountered Pokemon is obsolete.    It's not realistic because no two individuals from any real life species are created equal like that.    It's a video game. Doesn't have to be realistic.   Further, it's what gives the games an element of complexity and keeps older players engaged.   You take a look at the EVs for VGC players? I've said it a few times before but there is a lot of complexity and diversity in teams and EV comps. Plenty to keep us 20 somethings interested."
pokemon,3du4u7,NinjaKnight92,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"I think what Sugimori was referring to was a simplification of the way you progress through the game. Red/Blue were a bit more open-world than recent games. And honestly, I'd like that. I think these games are far too restrictive in what you can do—it's not really about exploring the world on your own anymore."
pokemon,3du4u7,Sak_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"I'd like to repeat some of the ideas others have said and add my own ideas:   -at most 1 event legendary in the gen  -Make all pokemon catchable in-game. (have previous event pokemon be catchable post-game after sidequests).   -remove EVs & IVs completely (if possible)  -make level up, stones, and trading the only way to evolve pokemon.   -Have Wonder Guard also have Overcoat's effects built in.  -Have Dark super effective against Fairy (but keep fairy super effective against dark)  -Have fairy resist itself  -No event only moves and have existing event only moves be able to be learned by lvl up, tutor, or relearner.   -not requiring a move deleter for HMs  -allowing for pokemon to be nicknamed from the menu.   -Keep auto level for link battles. (and allow for 49 & under to still retain their level).  -Make all hidden abilities available in-game  -Have a ""current situation"" tab during battle that lists any modifiers, field effects, pkmn types, health %, turn count, etc)"
pokemon,3du4u7,Sak_,2,Mon Jul 20 08:39:37 2015 UTC,"Taking out IV & EV would male the game boring, especially at the competitive level. These two things are what make pokemon a great tactical game.  These things (especially EV training) are what make some seemingly unviable pokemon become viable. If these were taken out, there would be 0 incentive to use weak pokemon because who wants to use a base 70 speed pokemon when they always get out sped by anything above it?   Sure you can play the game normally like many people love, but even then this has problems because champions/Bosses that have high BST pokemon would crush kids using weak pokemon. The way the game gives you EV even through normal play throughs helps mitigate this possibility by having some random pokemon be specially bulky to take that dam Hydregion hits.  TL;DR: Taking out IV/EV would cripple the game."
pokemon,3du4u7,neilarthurhotep,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"Some people have suggested getting rid of IVs all together, which I'm not aga. Kids won't notice it's gone,  it'll make breeding quicker/easier, and moves like Hidden Power (remember we're not supposed to no how it works) can be determined by some other arbitrary numbers."
pokemon,3du4u7,Sak_,2,Mon Jul 20 12:50:50 2015 UTC,"i would like there to be an option to see your pokemons stats as if they were lvl 50, i don't like the fact that i sometimes have to look up on the internet which of my pokemon is faster at lvl 50"
pokemon,3du4u7,Bernden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:02 2015 UTC,Make it so HMs can be over-written instead of deleted.   Changing TMs to be unlimited use already rendered the reasoning obsolete.
pokemon,3du4u7,Jelmddddddddddddd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:23 2015 UTC,"Cut would be completely removed, Eon Flute would be a thing all flying pokemon could do without an item, Surf/Whirlpool/Waterfall/Dive would be one move (Same stats as surf), Waterfall would be a TM for the pokes that use it. There would only be 10 different IVs, which would be easily accessible to view. All previous IVs would round into whichever is closest.  Options to play with extra hints for new players, the normal amount of help now, or an option to have no guidance on things veterans would know. Also difficulties like B2W2 had.  And the thing I care most about. MAKE HIDDEN POWERS EASIER."
pokemon,3du4u7,Bernden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:35 2015 UTC,I think Eon Flute is just an ORAS thing. It'd be weird to have Lati@s in every game.
pokemon,3du4u7,HighQualityToaster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:33:54 2015 UTC,"In order to make EV/IV training easier, I woul like to see a Pokemon bootcamp that specifically trains ur pkmns stats. It would work like the daycare, but they wouldnt gain levels and you could select which stat you wanted to raise.  I also would like to see more simplified Pokemon designs. The first 150 were so unique yet simple. We still had inanimate objects, but they were as simple as a ball, a magnet, a pile of sludge, etc. I'd like to go back to that design idea where they have a lot of character but could still be mistaken or overlooked as just an object. No giant walking trash heaps, grinding gears, or floating ice creams. Also, more animal-based designs."
pokemon,3du4u7,CrapCakes99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about being able to be overlooked as just an object... they still need to be unique creatures. You like ""pile of sludge"" but not ""floating ice cream with a cool story and still unique look""?"
pokemon,3du4u7,Hanimetion,4,Mon Jul 20 10:57:10 2015 UTC,"Multiple save files, key items to replace HMs, and multiple difficulty settings."
pokemon,3du4u7,Bane_of_BILLEXE,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:38:26 2015 UTC,Multiple save files   I think they already said they wouldn't do this. It would be super easy to abuse this to get starters and other Pokémon you have to choose between.
pokemon,3du4u7,Iridium_Bastiodon,-16,Sun Jul 19 20:42:12 2015 UTC,There should be a super training like. Mini-game that allows you to giver permanent boosts to IV's but failing said mini game would reduce said ev.   I also think that only 4 moves known should be done away with. I feel that for gameplay purposes you should be able to roate the 4 out from any repertoire that the pokemon has ever been able to learn. And switch he. Out using the pokedex or something.

pokemon,3dsxmd,sherekhantwait,5,Sun Jul 19 22:38:33 2015 UTC,I agree with both of you - I loved some of the characters in this game... I'd also be willing to play Gates to Infinity blind again as well.
pokemon,3dsxmd,Tuoko197,-18,Sun Jul 19 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"Eh I didn't like it that much. iirc each level had like 50-70 floors and you couldn't even get your favorite Pokemon to join your team since there was like a 1/50 chance that a Pokemon would want to become your friend after you fought them.  The only reason I ended up beating this game was because of the ""skip floors cheat"" on my Action Replay."
pokemon,3dsxmd,AwesomeDattebayo,11,Sun Jul 19 11:15:36 2015 UTC,Only the post-game dungeons had anywhere near 50 floors.

pokemon,3dsxmd,TheSlimyDog,3,Sun Jul 19 15:13:43 2015 UTC,I'd say that even midway into the game where you actually find/battle Grovyle stealing a Time Gear is when it starts getting better.
pokemon,3dsxmd,Focie,4,Sun Jul 19 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"You didn't even say which game it was..  And I bought two mystery Dungeon games last week. Blue rescue team and Explorers of sky. This does not look like blue rescue team, so i can only hope it's Sky as that's the one I'm going to start playing tomorrow"
pokemon,3dsxmd,Focie,3,Sun Jul 19 19:55:21 2015 UTC,It is Explorers of Sky. Although Blue rescue team is also great
pokemon,3dsxmd,Focie,2,Sun Jul 19 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"It was pretty awesome actually, but playing through the entirety of Gates of infinity and Blue Rescue Team made me question why everyone thinks Infinity is so dumbed down?  Everybody said Blue was so much harder, and so much deeper, but I thought it was about the same, really.  Why does everybody hate it?"
pokemon,3dsxmd,Focie,2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:16 2015 UTC,"There were a few reasons I didn't really like Gates to Infinity:   No hunger Barely any pokemon Lower Camera Worse Dungeon Design   Let me explain the last two, as they are a bit more subjective. The camera in Infinity is at a pretty low angle, meaning you only see a small part of the room your in, and and everything just looks more zoomed in. Also, this may be just me, but the ratio of corridors to rooms in the dungeons seems way more skewed towards corridors in this game, meaning most the exploration is just through one-tile paths where your partners are all useless"
pokemon,3dsxmd,Boblers,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:32 2015 UTC,"No hunger? Maybe not, but the Hunger in blue rescue team was really just an annoyance than anything else. There were enough apples in the dungeons to never ever need to worry about even taking them with me.  Barely any pokemon? In Blue Rescue team, I only brought one single pokemon with me. My partner. That's because you couldn't recruit more if you had a full party. In GtI i could at least bring my friends and not worrying about gimping myself.   As for the lowered camera, I do get that very much. It ruins the overview. I was pretty much glued to map though, so it's not that big a deal for me.  Big one is the corridor ratio. I do remember getting a little more bored with the dungeons than I did in blue Rescue team. I did think that the characters were much better though. Take Blue again, since I just finished that... you get two pokemon with you in the story. Magnemite and Absol.. neither contribute to the story any more after you recruit them. In GtI you get a whole cast of pokemon that you can play with if you want, and they're still integral to the story.  Bottom line is... i think they both are great, and I feel GtI gets a bit more flak than it deserves.  (Now I hope sky blows me out of the water)"
pokemon,3dsxmd,Decky09,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:09:15 2015 UTC,"It absolutely will, Sky is an excellent game.  And I see your points about how the number of pokemon doesn't really affect the main gameplay too much, my favorite parts of the first mystery dungeon games were trying to recruit all of the pokemon."
pokemon,3dsxmd,MonochromeGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"I see. The good old collect them all-aspect of it?  I was actually going to try that in Blue, but I gave up on it since i felt a lot of soul disappeared when your partner wouldn't follow you anymore. Just became another NPC  Edit:  And.. thank you for not downvoting me for saying GtI is about as good as Blue Rescue team."
pokemon,3dsxmd,Angel_of_Chaos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:04 2015 UTC,"Another point of contention is the short postgame story. You only have to go through one dungeon, which pales in comparison to the postgame in both Red/Blue and Time/Darkness/Sky."

There are 3 ""groups"" of mystery dugeon games: Red and Blue rescue team, Explorers of Time, Darkness and Sky, and Gates to Infinity. You really only need to play one of either Red or Blue, and Sky.I honestly prefer Red and Blue a little, but that could just be nostalgia.  Tl;Dr either Red rescue team, Blue rescue team, or Explorers of Sky"
pokemon,3dsxmd,FieryCharizard7,3,Sun Jul 19 07:28:50 2015 UTC,"Red or Blue Rescue Team. I personally really loved both of them and their mechanics are a little less advanced than Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky, so it would be easier to play those games and then the newer ones than to play the newest and go backwards."
pokemon,3dsxmd,thatnerdguy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:09:39 2015 UTC,Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky are generally considered to be the best games. I'm not sure whether Red/Blue is better than Gate to Infinity or not.
pokemon,3dsxmd,JoJoX200,6,Sun Jul 19 08:21:41 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. I like to think they are on par, tough Gates of Infinity has a 'deeper' story in terms of character development.

pokemon,3dsxmd,TheRemainingFruitcup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:16:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is any ""minimum"" but Dialga is Lv48 if that helps. There's no such thing as grinding the challenge away in my opinion, the postgame is equally as hard haha. I'm not going to spoil anything but the first postgame boss has you fighting 8 Pokemon at once, with their leader being Lv50, two levels higher than Dialga."

pokemon,3drtgw,sherekhantwait,4,Sat Jul 18 21:51:53 2015 UTC,It looks like it resembles the letter X much like Xerneas rather than how it used to resemble the letter Z. Makes me believe there will be something along the lines of XZ and YZ rather than just a third version.

pokemon,3dv8ia,CucumberGod,2,Mon Jul 20 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"I'd have a gym based on classic tabletop rpg (D&D, ect.) tropes. The gym itself would be like a dungeon: ""traps"", secret doors, and representations of typical monsters. Raticate ""rats"" and Marowak ""skeletons"" at the start, with various ""drow"" (Absol, Bisharp) and ""elementals"" (rock-types, Magcargo, Cyrogonal) and so on later.  It would be long and grueling but doable, more along the lines of an enemy team hideout than a typical gym. At the end is a guy with a ""red dragon"" Charizard and a Spiritomb ""demilich""... but that's not me. I'm right after that with a team designed to look like a Dungeons & Dragons adventurer party.   Paladin- Aegislash. Classic sword-and-board. Rogue- Zoroark. What's yours is now mine.  Bard- Exploud. HEAR MY THUNDER. Warlock- Gardevoir. Terrifying fey powers. Druid- Trevnant. The Ents march to war. Ranger- Mega Gallade. A whirlwind of blades.   Edit: Fighter to Paladin. Thematically better, and the party needed healing power."

pokemon,3dq3rt,gamezoid123,10,Sat Jul 18 13:16:36 2015 UTC,There is a right way to use dunsparce?
pokemon,3dq3rt,no_good_comments,11,Sat Jul 18 14:21:00 2015 UTC,It's like a weaker version of togekiss. Serene Grace Bodyslam is just annoying. And I'm sure it can learn an attack to make the enemy flinch.
pokemon,3dq3rt,Droggelbecher,7,Sat Jul 18 14:34:03 2015 UTC,It learns a couple. It shows up in Randoms. With Serene Grace it can use Roost/Body Slam/Rock Slide/Crunch/Headbutt/Glare/Coil to be a passable staller.
pokemon,3dq3rt,BlueFireAt,3,Sat Jul 18 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it learns Roost, funnily enough. Probably because of its stupid little wings.  I was so close to recommending a sleeptalk set (without looking up) but a roost set is arguably better.  It still has mediocre stats."
pokemon,3dq3rt,Droggelbecher,4,Sat Jul 18 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"Stat wise, Dunsparce is weaker than Togekiss, but when it comes to weaknesses, Togekiss has 3, while Dunsparce only has 1. The situation really depends on what Pokemon is used, but Dunsparce has some pretty decent coverage."
pokemon,3dq3rt,Wildcard709,3,Sat Jul 18 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Togekiss has 4 weaknesses, but it also has 4 resistances and 2 immunities. Dunsparce has 1 weakness and 1 immunity, but it's weakness is also one of the most commonly used types."
pokemon,3dq3rt,Faren107,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"It does have a fairly good amount of HP, for leftovers stall and roost. Other than that, it's pretty garbage stats wise."
pokemon,3dq3rt,BlueFireAt,2,Sat Jul 18 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"I recently have added a Dunsparce to my team (I only do Triples) and Dunsparce is a beast. Since my strategy revolves around Trick Room while I set up +2 Speed, +4 Att/Special Attack, and +4 Def/Special Defense (it's possible to do within one Trick Room) and then Psych Up the boost onto my other Pokemon. Dusparce has several advantages that Togekiss does not -- most notable having access to Rock Slide, which has a 60% chance each of flinching the targets. It also has Glare, which is able to paralyze Ground types. It has access to Roost as well as only having one weakness, as opposed to Togekiss's several weaknesses. Sure, it's initial stats might not be great, but once it gets the boosts from Psych Up, its utility makes up for its lack of damage."
pokemon,3dq3rt,Snowballrox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"Headbuut, Zen Headbutt, Bite, and Rock Slide are in Dunsparce's movepool so it does have many different ways to flinch opponents."

Caught one in Black 2, he was a bro, but ultimately I got bored of using him because, well, there wasn't anything to really look forward to.  He also learns Rollout at, like...level 11 or some shit. Totally brokenly OP in early game. Basically any consecutive battle could be decided by just sending him out on one of the early Pokemon, killing it with two or three Rollouts, then watching as he one-shot whatever came next and after."

pokemon,3dq3rt,Alvalon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"What's with the uneven battle teams, though? One guy has all legendaries and the other has perfectly ordinary pokemon (although it seems that this is solely for the baton pass strategy, so it's probably a mock battle to show off the effects of a such buffed up pokemon).  For the most part, though, a full evasion buff is probably enough to take out the average team. Without a guaranteed hit move, you'd probably miss too much to be able to win.  As an aside, the regular games so need the display of stat modifiers. It's too easy to forget what you've changed."
pokemon,3dq3rt,the_omega99,2,Sat Jul 18 23:16:08 2015 UTC,Why no evolution dunsparce?!?
pokemon,3dq3rt,buhgzie,3,Sat Jul 18 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"WHAT!?  No, I...I can't accept those words.  I did a Nuzlocke on X about a year ago.  My fourth encounter was a Dunsparce.  Just like many of you guys, I didn't really expect much from Dunsparce when I first encountered it, until it started spamming Rollout which nearly killed my Pidgey and Spewpa.    When I caught it afterwards, I grew impressed by how much HP it had (nearly twice as much HP as everyone else on the team!), so I Super-Trained that sucker up and it ended up being the tankiest member of the team.  With its bulk, paired with Defense Curl and Rollout, Viola couldn't stand a chance as I flattened her team of mediocre, fragile insects.    From then on, Dunsparce (who I named Flomar--it was female) became a staple member of the team (which is unique because I don't usually keep normal types), but it wasn't until the Ice Gym that she stood out the most.  You see, sometime during the run, I had a Steelix I was planning to use, but I lost it in a Double Battle when a Nidoqueen demolished it using Earth Power.  I was stuck by then.    Most of my Pokemon weren't really great against Ice; Klefki didn't have a powerful enough Steel-type move, Rotom couldn't hit ice types hard, Lapras couldn't do jack, Vivillion would've died on the first turn, and Chesnaught couldn't knock out at least one of them without getting knocked to red health in a matter of seconds.  And then...there was Flomar, the Dunsparce.  I honestly didn't know how well she would do in an Ice Gym...  ...until I realized it could learn Flamethrower.  Needless to say, Flomar ended up soloing the rest of the Ice Gym after Chesnaught had to take a break.  We eventually got to the Gym Leader, and Flomar showed off her flashy Flamethrower skills and subsequently one-shotted his Avalugg.  That...was amazing.  After the Ice Gym victory, I used her more than ever.  Even though her stats got mostly outclassed by her teammates, I still kept her around to push boulders and take down anything the rest of my team couldn't handle.  Flomar made it all the way to the Elite Four, where she used her Flamethrower/Drill Run craze to singlehandedly take down the Steel-type guy's team and smelt it to bits.  She survived the Champion's battle, and took a place in the Hall of Fame.  Never have I been more proud of a Normal-type in my life.  So...I guess my point is even if something looks like crap, use it.  You never know what you might expect."
pokemon,3dq3rt,Roivas7,2,Sun Jul 19 00:12:14 2015 UTC,I sweeped through the first 3 gyms in Pokemon Y using Dunsparce because it had rollout.

When the Pokémon appeared, they struck terror in those who saw their rise. The three Pokémon, knowing their own power, fled, running like the wind off into the grassland.""

It will take place in Kalos but also include a post game in Hoenn, resolving a couple of details leftover from ORAS (especially the Battle Frontier).

pokemon,3dwqzn,pandajedi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"Delta Emerald is extremely unlikely, especially with the existence of thousand arrows and thousand waves.

pokemon,3dwqzn,papa_smurphy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"Did I say extra version, or did I say sequel? The point is, at this point they have a lot of options. A Kanto remake or sequel, whatever. The point is, one game being a se/prequel for both isn't ruled out."
pokemon,3dwqzn,Crobatman123,2,Mon Jul 20 23:29:39 2015 UTC,"They arent gonna do a Kanto re-remake, and they arent gonna do Delta Emerald. They might have Hoenn postgame in the next two Kalos games, but even that isnt too likely. I'm just connecting the dots. Thanks to the datamining of many, including those at Project Pokemon, we know a few things. We know Gen VI will have 2 more games (most likely paired versions because thats how Pokemon works) and we know of the moves Thousand Arrows and Thousand Waves. Both of those moves are identical to Land's Wrath in type, base power, accuracy, and PP. The only difference between the 3 moves are the extra effects. Given that, the simplest and most logical conclusion is that the last 2 games of this gen will be 2 paired versions set in Kalos, with Zygarde as the mascot for both versions. Zygarde will get two forms, one for eah version, like with Kyurem last gen. And like Kyurem, changing its form will change its signature move into one of the new moves."

pokemon,3dwjib,ButtholeSmurfer,6,Mon Jul 20 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"Be released in two versions, as BW2.  Why go back to one third version when they've already managed it successfully with two?    I agree with this.    If it was a straight-up redo of XY that just featured Zygarde a bit more prominently, it could have easily come out this year.  Having a more elaborate, ""true"" sequel might explain why they're taking a year off for the first time in a while.  If not that, then what?    I'll admit I'm not sure why they skipped this year when they actually managed to get a 13-month global release between XY and ORAS, though I do also hope we get a sequel. However, if you go by the Japanese release date (the one that actually matters), there's been gaps recently. BW came out there in September 2010, and BW2 came to them in June 2012, nearly two years later, so that does give some hope to sequels. And XY came out a year and four months after Black 2, so it really hasn't been a 12 month cycle, and we could get a surprise reveal for the first half of 2016.     XY's pokedex (as has been mentioned by others) is rather small.  There has to be more.  It's a devious way to get people to buy the game who would otherwise not bother if they'd normally only get a Zygarde mega stone.    There doesn't have to be. Yes, there's only 73 new Pokemon. But when you add in the Megas, its actually bigger than Sinnohs Pokedex, which features about 80 new Pokemon and 30 evolutions and preevolutions of existing Pokemon. Johto also only had 101 new Pokemon, with some being evolutions of old Pokemon. The Kalos dex really isn't that small.      If the green blob was from Gen VII's pokedex, why was it associated with a teaser for Zygarde?  In no world would Zygarde be a mascot for or even in Gen VII.  This suggests that, indeed, there are more Gen VI pokemon sitting around.    Munchlax was in Destiny Deoxys two years before Diamond and Pearl came out. Zoroarks movie came out a few months before Black and White, and this movie is coming out July 2016, pretty much a whole year away. Lucario got his movie a year before Diamond and Pearl came out. This could be another situation like that."
pokemon,3dwjib,domeforaklondikebar,4,Mon Jul 20 03:44:27 2015 UTC,"There is no ""second half"" of the Gen VI Pokédex. Game Freak has already shown they are unwilling to patch XY for the ORAS megas; if the Gen VI Pokédex has a second half, then XYORAS would have to be patched due to the way certain online functions work.  As for the other parts of your theory:   ""Be a third game in the Kalos/XY world"" - self-explanatory, this is what everyone is expecting after Rayquaza/Giratina/Kyurem. ""Be released in two versions, as BW2 was"" - BW2 was not a traditional third version in the vein of Crystal/Emerald/Platinum. It sold well enough to make this a reasonable possibility for later gens to do the same thing. ""Be called something along the lines of ZX/ZY"" - The common speculation for the titles are XZ/YZ, you inverted them so that XYZ would hold up better as an abbreviation. Makes sense. Zygardite ZX Dark-type / Zydardite ZY Fairy-type - This inverts the typing of the XY legendaries, similar to how B2/W2 had each other's legendaries. I see a straight ZX Fairy / ZY Dark as more reasonable. ""Come out next year"" - seems reasonable, if it were a 2015 release it would have been fully announced by now ""Feature a new storyline, much like BW2, using the Kalos region and its assets"" - I think you hit the nail on the head with this one.   As for your reasoning:   ""If straight-up redo, then they wouldn't have taken a year off"" makes a bit of sense as there was a year off between BW and B2W2, but there was also a year off between DP and Platinum which was a redo. ""After BW2, I can't see them going with a single game third version"" - we have in-game evidence that a six-game generation is possible, though you didn't cite it. ""If green blob from Gen VII, why Zygarde teaser?"" - See below. ""The shadow = Zygarde's alternate form"" - No proof against it, but it could be a fake out. ButtholeSmurfer flinched!   ZYGARDE TEASER + GREEN BLOB THEORY  This is Hoopa's movie, and Hoopa is the second-to-last event of the generation. Next-gen Pokémon usually don't show up in the anime until the time the last event gets its movie.   Gen II had Ho-Oh in episode 1 of the anime, but the first explicitly mentioned Gen II Pokémon was Togepi, which was less than a month before Mew's movie. Gen III had Kecleon's debut two days before Celebi's movie. Gen IV had Munchlax's debut in Deoxys's movie. Gen V is the major exception to the rule, as no one appeared in or near Arceus's movie. The first Gen V Pokémon were Zorua and Zoroark in their own movie. Gen VI had Gogoat's debut five days after Genesect's movie."
pokemon,3dwjib,bwburke94,6,Mon Jul 20 11:29:16 2015 UTC,"I dont think we are getting additional Gen VI Pokemon. I think the reason the new Pokemon in Gen VI is so small is because of Megas. The megas take time to conceive, design, and develop. The green blob is most likely our first Gen VII mon, just like how many other pokemon have been revealed in the past (Victini, weavile, munchlax, zoroark, and ho-oh to name a few)."

pokemon,3dssuy,CrapCakes99,15,Sun Jul 19 02:54:58 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to see if people liked it. I'm going to do the other two  stones fire and water, then I'll get them up on our Etsy"
pokemon,3dssuy,CrapCakes99,6,Sun Jul 19 03:01:05 2015 UTC,Wait... Holy shit. You made that? Fantastic work!
pokemon,3dssuy,Black_Belt_Troy,7,Sun Jul 19 03:05:03 2015 UTC,thank you so much! a few more tweaks to finalize the design and I'll do a full write up on my site. Is there anything you would like to see made?
pokemon,3dssuy,Construct_Master,2,Sun Jul 19 03:10:07 2015 UTC,Moon Stone!
pokemon,3dssuy,smittengoose,2,Sun Jul 19 04:11:02 2015 UTC,"A Mega Stone, if that sounds possible."
pokemon,3dssuy,TheQueenOfTopHats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:38 2015 UTC,They would look an awful lot like big marbles imo.
pokemon,3dssuy,LawrenceCatNeedsHelp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:57:08 2015 UTC,yea I want to make it but I don't think it would look cool enough so I'm going to try and make this orb and the effects link
pokemon,3dssuy,LawrenceCatNeedsHelp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:15:58 2015 UTC,what if I made this with like Blaziken coming out of the orb
pokemon,3dssuy,LawrenceCatNeedsHelp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:16:44 2015 UTC,A Sunstone would be awesome.
pokemon,3dssuy,TheDottyEffect,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:25:47 2015 UTC,"I really like it, but it needs to be a bit more green to look like the real thing. Take a look at this Bulbapedia article for reference.  I would love to buy one, so please don't feel discouraged, but it looks a little blue, and it should be green."
pokemon,3dssuy,Mattarias,2,Sun Jul 19 06:01:37 2015 UTC,I really appreciate the feedback! I was having trouble with the colors and tranparency but I will work until I cant grt it right. I love making astouding things people enjoy! Thanks again the next post will hopefully have more types of stone. Follow up question do you think the thunderbolt should be tranparent also? I can make one sk we can compaire.
pokemon,3dssuy,Quantummonkeys,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:10:33 2015 UTC,"The best way to go about making these stones is to stick to the in game version of the items or the anime version when in doubt. In both the game and the show, the thunderbolt is not transparent, but the greenish stone is."
pokemon,3dssuy,Mattarias,3,Sun Jul 19 06:16:08 2015 UTC,That is great advice thank you so much this is why I love reddit. Tomorror is green thunderstone day!
pokemon,3dssuy,FufuTheGargoyle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:23:01 2015 UTC,"You are welcome. If you make some more, I would love to buy one. I liked you Facebook page. As an added consideration, at the Pokemon Center store in   Tokyo, you can buy Evolution stone keychains that come with a Pokemon that can evolve using that stone.   I you sculpt or 3D print, you could consider selling a small figurine to go with the stone.   You could also put the evolution stones in the box that they typically are shown in within the anime. Definitely watch some of the anime episodes if you need references,  All you gotta do is find which episodes stones appear in. For thunderstones-Pika and Goliath! is the 74th Episode in the DP series of Pokemon. It features a thunderstone. Electric Shock Showdown, which is in the first season, also shows one. It's no surprise that most of the thunderstone episodes feature Pikachu, but there are also episodes that feature Eevee."
pokemon,3dssuy,Mattarias,5,Sun Jul 19 06:31:49 2015 UTC,Nice. Now make sure you keep it the hell away from Pikachu for absolutely no good reason whatsoever
pokemon,3dssuy,Quantummonkeys,-3,Sun Jul 19 03:24:31 2015 UTC,Because it didn't want to evolve? Because Pokemon are sapient beings with their own feelings and forcing evolution on them is horrid?

pokemon,3duoop,Atron24,10,Sun Jul 19 17:30:47 2015 UTC,Those are both cool ideas but I'd like to add that they should make future releases a less linear storyline.
pokemon,3duoop,TSwiv,3,Sun Jul 19 17:46:43 2015 UTC,Yes i was thinking of that aswell
pokemon,3duoop,Sitonsexyprinters,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like the linear-ness is kind of nostalgic at this point, obviously not for newcomers, and also I would hate to see the game branch off and because of it, you can never get to see some part of the game that's very integral in a different story line because you either get: Less quality per branch because where as before you had one part to flesh out you now have two different branches to flesh out   Or longer release times because there effectively more game then before   And to add to that the part of the game that is ""more game"" the other branch, you may never see it unless you play through the game again, which don't get me wrong, I would, but I just feel like Pokemon is a classic, and continues to be a modern classic because of its ritualistic story  Last point, I do think it would be awesome if they added in an entire post game where you have to go back to each towns gym leader and do quests of some sort and they would regularly generate more quests for you to go on and Pokemon would level to different levels based on what the quest level is, such as maybe flanery needs you to go to meteor falls and collect 5 sun stones but when you go there are level 70-80 and regardless of version you can find solrocks, they could gift you with quest points (basically battle points) or give you cash or hard to obtain items such as stones or vitamins or maybe even gift you a Pokemon, like maybe flanery would give you a torkoal after you do 10 quests for her"
pokemon,3duoop,SparklyVampireDust,8,Mon Jul 20 04:31:50 2015 UTC,"What I really want to see more than anything else is a ""difficult/hard"" mode. Keeping the current difficulty level is great for kids and people just getting into pokemon, but a lot of my friends who have been playing for a while would love to have more challenging play throughs!"
pokemon,3duoop,raoul_d,3,Sun Jul 19 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"The worst thing is, they had that in two or all of the Gen 5 games. You got the normal game, and then you had to beat the game. After beating the game, depending on your version, you unlock a key to make it either easier or harder"
pokemon,3duoop,Benvironment,3,Sun Jul 19 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"And then if you restarted the game, you'd lose the ability to use the unlocked difficulty."
pokemon,3duoop,EchoingSong,6,Sun Jul 19 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, the key had to be used on another cartridge that was starting a new game! GREAT IDEA GAME FREAK"

pokemon,3duoop,sarinn13,3,Sun Jul 19 21:14:41 2015 UTC,"I believe that the gotta catch them all theme of Pokemon is lost in the games   Fun fact: They stopped using that theme after Gen 2. They brought it back for XY (kinda) but it's rarely seen.  Anyways, the idea isn't bad, but I'd still just be happy if they added a difficulty mode."
pokemon,3duoop,461weavile,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"Why's that, because Ash was really bad at catching Pokemon?"
pokemon,3duoop,sarinn13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"No official statement was ever given, but there's a couple theories.  The most likely of which is that when Gen 3 was released, you couldn't trade between Gen 2 & 3 games. As such, it wasn't actually possible to catch them all at that point."

They haven't, they haven't, and they haven't and probably won't. There's a ""love interest"" though that will probably go no where though and will end with the next generation starts."
pokemon,3dw7su,domeforaklondikebar,4,Mon Jul 20 01:40:53 2015 UTC,Sinnoh is honestly my favorite region. Lots of character development with Ash and his Pokemon (infernape especially) and my favorite rival in Paul. Also Ash got the farthest.

pokemon,3dxzrx,xRiho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:44 2015 UTC,You know its not just one team working on a game... I heard something about passing the torch to another director for remixes and sequels

pokemon,3dxzrx,Swamp-Marsh-Mud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:42:15 2015 UTC,Especially in December... If they roll a commercial during starwars 7 then theyll make a ton
pokemon,3dxzrx,domeforaklondikebar,4,Mon Jul 20 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"I think if the new main Pokemon game(s) would come out this year, they would have get some info at Nintendo's E3, as that focused on (probably all) games that come out in 2015. That's why Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon also wasn't in the Digital Event as Europe doesn't get PSMD in 2015 but in 2016, therefore not everyone would have gotten it in 2015 therefore Nintendo left PSMD out.  A main game was never revealed at E3 ever, I know that. That's not what I'm saying. But look at these facts. XY was announced in January and ORAS in May. All those dates were BEFORE E3 so that E3 could have info on those games."
pokemon,3dxzrx,Nightynightynight,4,Mon Jul 20 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"So Ive been thinking about this for a while now and I beleive that the next pokemon games will come out... This Year.    Not showing they game off at E3 when everything else they had was weak is really damn stupid then.   Part 1: Pokemon X and Y released before the ""Main Movie"" Which involved Diancie and teased OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire. OrAs released before its ""Main Movie"" which involved Hoopa who will probaly have a part in the next games like how diancie did in OrAs... So the Next Games will probaly release before the next movie which will probaly tease G7 while showing off Volcanion (Like how they showed Genesect and teased X and Y)   If you look at release dates for all the movies, theirs a ton that came before their main movie. Not the best thing to base it on.   Part 2: Look at the release dates of past pokemon games...    How about we look at the Japanese release dates which actually matter more? They were 1 year earlier than in America for most games before Black and White 2.    Part 3: So if we are getting a game then why hasnt it been announced yet? Well lets compare the announcement and release dates of the last 2 games... X and Y was announced in January and released in October (10 Months) OrAs was announced in May and released in November (7 Months) January-May is 5 months so the next pokemon game could be announced in September with a release in December (4 Months) which means less corocoro therefore less spoilers    You're reaching half life 3 levels of pattern making.   X and Y was being worked on during when Black and White was released   That game was released in 2010, I would hope they worked on their next generation title for at least three years. That's also when they got the 3DS dev kit as they were one of the first ones to get them.   Also I remember reading an article where they where talking about releasing a pokemon game every year    Then hopefully they're dropping that bad habit.    how they get someone else to direct sequels and remixes so its very possible that OrAs was being worked on as another Director was working on XZ and YZ   Okay, look at Black 2 White2, the successor to Black and White. Black and White was being worked in while the remix team was making Heart Gold Soul Silver. I beleive the Black White team also made Black 2 White 2. Black 2 White 2 got a Japanese release nearly two years after Black White. Let's say the same team worked on it since it was such a different game, or lets say it was a different team but production didn't start until after Black and White since they needed a base game. That was nearly two years  for a DS game. They're probably going to need 2.5-3 years for the 3DS game."
pokemon,3dxzrx,Nightynightynight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:15 2015 UTC,The Japanese release dates dont matter anymore since the release dates are now following the worldwide release sceduele
pokemon,3dxzrx,raoul_d,2,Mon Jul 20 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's the other way around, the worldwide release schedule follows the Japanese release dates now, they're still the only dates that matter if you want to create a pattern based on past release dates. Western release dates are completely irrelevant in this. Speaking of dates, if you look at more than just the past two games' announcement dates, you'd see that there is just no real pattern as to when they announce and then release games. Trying to find something like that is pretty much pointless.  The only pattern in the release dates that I can tell you is that so far, GameFreak has never released games every year for more than three consecutive years. Sometimes they'd take a break after only one year, sometimes two or three but it's never been longer than that until there was a year without them releasing a game and I'm talking about GameFreak releasing the games, not how long it took the localisation teams to release the games in the west. So I would very much like to read that article that you mentioned about them wanting to release games every year."
pokemon,3dxzrx,Swamp-Marsh-Mud,0,Mon Jul 20 15:20:48 2015 UTC,The japanese games released in summer... Worldwide in fall and now japan releases there games at the same time
pokemon,3dxzrx,Swamp-Marsh-Mud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"Where exactly are you getting those dates from? BW2 is the only main game that has been released in summer in Japan and the only one in several years that we got in autumn. BW1 was released in September in Japan, just like HGSS, Platinum and DP. All those games we got in Spring but now since they've switched to a worldwide release, we got the past two games during autumn as well but for Japan, nothing has changed in that regard, they still get the games at around the same time as most previous ones."

Maybe that's why."

pokemon,3dxtn8,MasterTrelf,7,Mon Jul 20 12:38:42 2015 UTC,Uuuggggghhhhh Kanto is so overdone. It's been a playable region in eleven games. It's been featured in four remake titles alone. I'd rather they not.

pokemon,3dxtn8,Gotxiko,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will reboot Kanto to include them in the mega universe, they already did it with Pokémon Origins ""movie"".

I think they will remake DP some day, but not before doing a gen 7 game."

pokemon,3dxtn8,Crobatman123,3,Mon Jul 20 14:00:54 2015 UTC,"No. We don't need it. It's so old and tired now, I am sick of Kanto, the pokemon selection is shallow compared to what's available today and it would be super boring by now. The only way it could be good if it wasn't a remake, but a sequel/prequel with new areas, more pokemon, different story.  I don't see this obsession with Kanto, the other regions are much better. There is a reason this was the first one"
pokemon,3dxtn8,Dark-Scar,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"We need another Kanto. A Kanto with more pokemon, a Kanto with more items, a Kanto with a lot more ect. as well. And that could be achieved in a remake through Alternate Universe/Time Travel Business."
pokemon,3dxtn8,Plokster52,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of people didn't notice this but, I think we might have already gotten our ""Kanto"" game through X and Y. Now hear me out here this will make sense. The first things we notice in X and Y are that there are a lot of Kanto Pokemon in the tall grass, and the fact Pikachu has a new cry where it says its name (it's the mascot and it made its debut in RBGY). However there are other and bigger reasons behind this idea, for instance the fact we get to pick a Kanto starter, the Kanto starters all have Mega Evolutions, an NPC mentions Blue (Gary/Green) being in Kalos, there is a Snorlax blocking a route and we have to retrieve a PokeFlute, we can catch the legendary birds, and last of all the fact that we can encounter Mewtwo after we beat the league just like in RBGY/FRLG. If you want to bring up the anime too we do have Pokemon Origins which brought us the animated journey of Red which lead into the reveal of Mega Charizard X. These factors alone give us a clear image that X and Y did give us in some form or another a ""Kanto"" game."
pokemon,3dvjnb,acid-nz,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:05 2015 UTC,"I think this would be really cool! And since many Pokemon were sacrificed, it would be really hard to even find Pokemon in the wild and it would be even more difficult to find two of the same Pokemon! That way in game teams would be really unique to each person. It would also be kind of similar to a nuzlocke challenge because you kind of need to take what you get since Pokemon are so difficult to find. The story line would be very interesting; I wouldn't mind seeing this happen!   Another thing is how would the anime work with this? Very interesting idea you got there."
pokemon,3dvjnb,colber,2,Sun Jul 19 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea, but I think for consistency with PokeBank, the story would need to be in the present. It would be rad if there was time travel to experience the great weapon tho. I could see that being more plausible"

pokemon,3ds6dy,jongrand4321,2,Sun Jul 19 13:11:43 2015 UTC,"I think that Team Preview adds another layer of depth to the game. People can play mindgames with their opponent through team preview. One example is, in VGC, if someone puts a Whimsicott and a Terrakion next to each other in the team, but actually has no intent of using Beat Up.  Removing team preview would also force almost all matches to be best of three, as best of one matches without team preview would be very unfair."

pokemon,3ds6dy,wes2les,14,Sun Jul 19 20:56:11 2015 UTC,The biggest thing that comes to mind for me is making IVs easier to read. Possibly also make it so you can influence them as well.  At the very least for legendaries. It's not much fun to soft reset a gazillion times for the IVs you want (or the Hidden power you need.)

Would probably have to make a new one for him simply because there aren't that many good physical bug moves right now that it can learn.

This is such a braindead obvious one that I honestly can't believe it's not how the game works already, six generations in.    Also, there need to be custom pockets in the backpack. I hate scrolling through the first pocket to find my EV training items, or a specific Hold Item or something. There desperately needs to be pockets we can assign items to and/or make custom storing rulesets for. Also, what happened to being able to store items we don't need in the PC?"
pokemon,3ds6dy,DefNotNuz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:44:36 2015 UTC,You can't store items in the PC anymore because you now have a bigger bag than you could possibly need.

Why can't you change them on trade pokemon? It makes no sense in reality because a) You shouldn't need a person to give you authorization to change the name of your battle partner and b) How could said person possibly know if that pokemon was from a different original trainer? I suppose there could be some confusion on the pokemon's front as it is now being commanded under a different title but these are just pseudo-animals we're talking about. After a while the animal will submit to the new name and grow accustomed to it. Give us a few battle after the name change wherein the pokemon sometimes doesn't react to your commands because it can't understand who you're commanding.   This has been an issue since gen 1 and I feel that no ground is being won by keeping it in as a mechanic. It serves no purpose and it was a bad idea in the first place. Just let it go, Game Freak."
pokemon,3ds6dy,flyingvenusflytrap,12,Sun Jul 19 06:09:50 2015 UTC,"At the very least, I would like an option to return a nicknamed Pokémon to the default name. They already change Pokémon transferred from older gens to lower case names on evolution, but not all Pokémon evolve."

Not that ""Poopyhead"" can't be a term of affection or anything, but just because I call my dogs that doesn't mean everyone finds it acceptable."
pokemon,3ds6dy,KisaiSakurai,4,Sun Jul 19 13:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think a decent compromise would be allowing you to change the nickname one you max out its affection in Pokemon-amie.  It shows the pokemon you love and care for it, it holds on with 1 HP, it looks at you trustingly...surely it's bonded with you enough at that point to go by a new name."

pokemon,3ds6dy,aggron306,6,Mon Jul 20 01:12:18 2015 UTC,"It kinda annoyed me at first, but when I give Pokémon to people, I see it as sort of leaving a ""mark"" on your Pokémon. Like, your own personal little touch that can stay with the Pokémon. In that sense, I think it's kinda neat."

Gyms are supposed to be challenges to gauge whether a trainer is ready for the next step or not, and when a leader uses a full restore it feels gimmicky to me. Also goes for the trainers who revive their Pokemon over and over again, which imo shows that they're not ready for the ""next step."""
pokemon,3ds6dy,CiudadPlateada,12,Sun Jul 19 07:05:12 2015 UTC,Agreed on the full restores. Bosses who heal mid fight in order to add an extra level of difficulty instead of having good AI is one of the cheapest tricks in the book
pokemon,3ds6dy,carlo26,3,Sun Jul 19 12:52:52 2015 UTC,"There's nothing like an intense gym battle where your last Pokèmon needs one more hit, and then the leader full restores and faints you. Fuck that noise."
pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,9,Sun Jul 19 17:05:05 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a system where they are allowed to use the same items as you.  You use a full restore?  They're allowed to use one anytime.  You use spam Max Revives?  Claire's Kingdra keeps rising from the dead to to use dragonbreath on you.
pokemon,3ds6dy,carlo26,3,Sun Jul 19 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's how I usually do it in my playthroughs. Each potion a gym leader uses is a restore that I can now use for my own Pokèmon to balance the battle."
pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,2,Sun Jul 19 17:03:17 2015 UTC,And make it so you can't use more pokémon than what the leader has for that battle. 2 vs 6 is not a challenge.
pokemon,3ds6dy,TheSlimyDog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:02 2015 UTC,Or how about an acceptable level range for the different gyms? Something like level 10-15 Pokèmon allowed in this gym. Would be kind of hard to make work though.
pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,0,Sun Jul 19 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"Enemy trainers don't know how to use Revives, and no way GF would remove the player's ability to use them. That'd make the player actually have to level Pokemon properly which might make the game take two seconds longer, which according to GF is a bad thing.  I'd like some kind of challenge mode, though. IIRC there was one in B2 after you beat the game the first time that raised opponent levels and AI."
pokemon,3ds6dy,TheSlimyDog,2,Sun Jul 19 17:03:58 2015 UTC,That seems what we're getting at. A challenge mode implemented by GF that makes the game just a bit more difficult and structured. Don't know why that's so much to ask for.
pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,2,Sun Jul 19 17:09:48 2015 UTC,"Because kids, and GF thinks their consumer base-even young adults-of today can't even remotely pay attention long enough to even start up a game, let alone grind a teeny bit.  Basically we just gotta hope we get Romhacks that allow us to implement stuff like nuzlocking, no items, etc. Pokemon Zeta/Omicron style."
pokemon,3ds6dy,Shiny_Trevenant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love all these additions but the thing is that as a kid, I'd probably fail horribly at the game and quit if it had these features.

pokemon,3ds6dy,sickly_snake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:20 2015 UTC,What new gym rules? The games play virtually the same as they always have. I was talking about Romhacks.
pokemon,3ds6dy,Shiny_Trevenant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:40:59 2015 UTC,I meant that your suggestions were good but GF is right in not adding them because kids would never be able to get into the game if they did.

pokemon,3ds6dy,sickly_snake,14,Sun Jul 19 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really like that idea, since Pokémon's not really that linear. Sure, it'd be nice for people who don't care about doing any end-game stuff, and just go through the story, and that's it... But there's so many things to do. Catching all the Pokémon, filling up the boxes, getting all the items, winning all the mini-games (contests, movies, triathlons), getting all the trainer cards, ribbons, Battle Tower/Mason stuff, etc. etc. The way they build the game, it's sort of obvious the intent is for the game to be your own personal adventure and how much you can complete.  Not to mention, with all that stuff, multiple save files would be a nightmare to create. We'd probably have to sacrifice a lot of end-game stuff to have multiple save files. But then again, I don't think people who want multiple save files care about that stuff."
pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,9,Sun Jul 19 06:15:49 2015 UTC,Not to mention GameFreak would never do something like that which could potentially lower the number of sales for their games. Allowing players multiple saves would mean that you and your friends/siblings could simply swap off the same copy  whenever the other has something else to do.
pokemon,3ds6dy,silverwolf761,5,Sun Jul 19 07:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would prevent that. I mean, look at Animal Crossing. Sure, you can have multiple people playing the same game, but you can't play with each other at the same time. And battling is one of the biggest features of Pokémon."
pokemon,3ds6dy,PokemonFangirl1,3,Sun Jul 19 07:07:08 2015 UTC,"Animal Crossing, at least in New Leaf, doesn't allow the second player to be the mayor, though.  And both are such vastly different games that it really doesn't work to point to one and say what it does would work for another."
pokemon,3ds6dy,Dr3z93,-1,Sun Jul 19 07:28:50 2015 UTC,"Lots of other (equally large-scale) series do it just fine.  Shin Megami Tensei, Zelda, Monster Hunter, Skyrim.  Pokemon's one cartridge = one save is pretty shitty tbh."
pokemon,3ds6dy,catgotswag,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:40:07 2015 UTC,"Sales, it's all about sales.  Also, there's virtually nothing you can do in Pokemon that would cause something unchangeable in your game, save for somehow accidentally releasing something.  Not the case in games like SMT or Skyrim, where you'd need to live with consequences. Pokemon really doesn't have consequences, more like minor inconveniences.  The thing is you always have easy/the exact same access to all Pokemon at one point or another, if you want to train them then just train them, if you want to try out that Mankey instead of a Spearow just go back and catch one, if you don't like the Pidgey you raised and decided you do actually want to raise a Sandshrew instead just head to the route and grab a Sandshrew. With the advent of Pokebank the excuse of not wanting to erase a save file for a New Game is out the window, it's only $5, and if you don't have five bucks I dunno why you're playing a Pokemon game on a 3DS.  There's virtually no reason that the games need another save slot, because none of your choices in the game actually matter, you can do or use whatever you want whenever you want at the same time as you would on any other save file, and if you're gonna waste the time getting to the point where you can catch a specific Pokemon on another save file, you could've trained them at the EXACT same time on the first one and just saved yourself the trouble.  Even items like rare candies or master balls still aren't something unbelievable, all they are are quick level up items and a glorified ball, you can still level up crazy easy in the latest games and it's pretty simple to catch anything in Ultra Balls, especially with critical captures and O-powers now.  So, can you name an actual reason other than ""Because I want it"" that we'd need another save file? Because I'm pretty sure I've just covered any reason why it would be needed as opposed to people just wanting it because."
pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:04 2015 UTC,We'd probably have to sacrifice a lot of end-game stuff to have multiple save files   Why?

pokemon,3ds6dy,Maping,16,Sat Jul 18 23:49:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd have to agree with you. The first moment I heard of Mega Evolution I said to myself, ""This shit sounds like Digimon"". Now, Digimon isn't inherently a bad thing, but there's quite a noticeable difference between the two franchises, and I don't want them to mix.  It's only a matter of time before we get something totally ridiculous like Fusion Evolution. We've already got Black/White Kyurem, even though Reshi/Zek were a part of Kyurem in the first place.  Imagine shit like Fusion Mega Charizard Z (Fusiuon of X and Y), or what we all know GF wishes they could do,  Fusion Mega Pikazard.  Still...I'd find them tolerable if more than half of the ones that got megas actually NEEDED them."

But Charizard gets 2 megas while Venusaur and Blastoise get 1?  I'm Team Charizard and even I think it's shameless pandering.  Meanwhile, Mewtwo has 2 megas and Rayquaza doesn't even need to hold a mega stone to mega evolve.

Sableye couldn't have an evolution without becoming obnoxious with eviolite.  For the most part, though, the pokemon that could use them languish in negligence."
pokemon,3ds6dy,TheCracchen,5,Sun Jul 19 08:52:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. It was a pretty cool feature at first, but I think that they have it to too many Pokemon. To me, Mega Evolutions aren't even that special, I mean each Pokemon turns back to normal after fighting which is really lame. A lot of the Pokemon they gave the feature to to should have received regular evolutions as well.  I hope that Mega Evolutions won't be pushed into our throats like they were in gen 6 ever again. Regular evolutions are way more special."
pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,4,Sun Jul 19 11:24:38 2015 UTC,"The in-game lore behind megas contradicts everything about the gameplay.   Megas are supposed to be possible only when there's an intense bond between trainer and pokemon, yet I can grab my Mewtwonite Y off the floor as soon as I catch Mewtwo and immediately mega evolve the one pokemon that completely distrusts humans. It's supposed to only be used in battle, but in OR/AS you call a Lati, mega evolve it to fly around (even though you were flying on it just fine a second ago).  Is it holding the correct stone in the first place?  Can they mega evolve without it? Your pokemon can faint after mega evolving, but you can revive it back to its mega state in the same battle but if it wins, it reverts back to normal.  Meanwhile, if they've fainted, I can't evolve anyone else in my party during that battle.   And that's just what I remember right now.  I'm sure there are more storyline contradictions with it."

pokemon,3ds6dy,ShortchangeParamecia,3,Sun Jul 19 12:50:49 2015 UTC,I disagree
pokemon,3ds6dy,phi1997,12,Sun Jul 19 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"I can understand why they don't reorganize the National Dex, seeing as they would have to renumber a ton of Pokemon and that'd be a hassle, anyway, here are my ""fixes"".  Change Shelmet's typing from Bug to Bug/Steel. I mean Escavalier is Bug/Steel and that's the same armor from Shelmet.  Perhaps remove Eviolite, it's probably the reason why we won't get evolutions for Dunsparce, Klefki, and so on, but at the same time, I kinda want to keep it for NFE, so I'm not too sure on that."
pokemon,3ds6dy,TheCracchen,2,Sun Jul 19 00:27:11 2015 UTC,"Not a hassle at all. One person could easily do it all in less than a week if they've structured their code well. But this way, the Pokemon are organized according to generation which is good as well IMO. Don't fix it if it ain't broke."
pokemon,3ds6dy,KisaiSakurai,5,Sun Jul 19 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"For starters I think the range of IVs could be cut in half (31 to 15 or 16). Correct me if I'm wrong but this effectively keeps the battle mechanics the same while reducing the time sink of breeding. I believe the only thing it would actually effect would be hidden powers, but losing a negligible  ammount of stat points should be the trade off for getting a coverage move. Also this would make breeding for hidden powers much easier, so this helps to dissuade hacks.  I agree with the post about dropping stats for nuke moves like Draco or Overheat even when they miss, but I'd pump up the base power and adjust accuracy as needed for balance.  I also agree with revamping the orginazation of the national dex. The most practical way I can see this working is by keeping the current national dex as a ""legacy dex"" and creating a new national dex that reorganizes Pokémon families, fixes the nidoran issue, and moves legendaries into a separate section at the end.   Building off of this: adding baby or missing link Pokémon for Khangaskan, Tauros/Milktank, Rufflet/Vullaby, ect. will help cover logic holes breeding creates.   While spin blocking makes for an interesting meta, it doesn't make much sense that not hitting a ghost-type would prevent hazards from being spun away. Either change rapid spin's typing or allow it to clear hazards without connecting to targets. This will help address how OP stealth rocks are perceived. (Although I'd be totally behind a creative replacement for spinblockers under this change)  I think megastones hunting will get unruly at some point. A while back someone suggested cosolidating megastones into broader categories. IE: Fireite could be used to mega evolve the likes of Blaziken and Charizard Y, while Dracoite could mega Garchomp and Charizard X.   Adding alternatives to hyper voice and return for pixilate-esq abilities will help to give that mechanic some much needed variety.  And lastly, of course, better match making for 6v6 singles."
pokemon,3ds6dy,xpoz,15,Sun Jul 19 07:15:24 2015 UTC,"First off the story lines need to change. I can honestly after playing Pokemon for 15 years can essentially guess each line. A story line with choices like Mass Effect would be fun too. Maybe join team rocket if you wanted.   I'd also like a different type of battle system. If they could incorporate Pokken tournament into an rpg game I'd think that'd be fun. A faster style of battling. I understand the turn by turn is a classic but watching the tv series you can call out dodges and use the environment which would be a fun change strategy wise.   ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY ""CATCH THEM ALL"". I mean make the legendaries be difficult puzzles but make it at least accessible in game. I understand business wise, why they do it but I just want a Mew."
pokemon,3ds6dy,flyingvenusflytrap,12,Sun Jul 19 04:10:09 2015 UTC,"Thing is the games aren't made for you, each one is essentially made to pander far more to the newer fans who are coming in, and they won't know the stories yet.  Not like it's ever been difficult to guess what's coming anyway.  You set off from town with buddy/rival, you fight rival, you beat gyms, you fight Evil Organization a few times, you beat up their leader, you save the day just in time to fight the league and become Champion.  The only generation I'm aware of that was a bit more unique in that respect would be Black and White, but no, everybody was bitching about all the dialogue and actual character development, so instead we got Crazy Lysandre and his team of fashionistas trying to kill like 90% of the Earth's population with a giant laser.  Edit: ""Catch 'Em All"" has not been the series slogan for years. It's also why they began pushing the idea that your journey was whatever you made of it in X/Y."
pokemon,3ds6dy,xpoz,5,Sun Jul 19 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"actual character development, so instead we got Crazy Lysandre   yeah, that did seem like a huge drop in creativity. the selfishness/greed theme was great in the age of OWS and discussions about the income gap and corporate ethics but the story itself was bland. malva and xerosic should have had bigger roles. regular E4 members rarely get involved in the main story, especially not on the villain side, so an expansion of malva's character would've been cool to see.  lysandre would have been more interesting as a delusional patsy, or even an iron man 3-style mandarin character created by xerosic to be the face of team flare in exchange for wealth or something in the brave new world (a greedy desire which would contradict the purported reasoning of team flare and therefore be a cool twist)."
pokemon,3ds6dy,TheSlimyDog,3,Sun Jul 19 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"I personally liked Lysandre as the actual villain, mostly for the reasons a lot of characters hate him. People who have certain mental illnesses sometimes do things that seem absolutely crazy to the rest of us, and Lysandre's weird dissonance crying about Pokemon as he did what he did struck me as pretty authentic to both some of the narcissist behaviors I've seen from some of my family and the severe splitting I've seen from some of my friends.   As for Xerosic being a terrible person to Lysandre's crazy one, there is a lot of evidence that he and other admins corrupted Lysandre's vision quite a bit in its execution, and Lysandre was simply too deep in the mental health hole to catch on and stop it in time. Sometimes I wonder if his fascination with the PC and his creepy interest in Diantha wasn't a desperate plea to fix his org before he kills everyone outside it."
pokemon,3ds6dy,flyingvenusflytrap,3,Sun Jul 19 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"I almost felt like my goal was to punish the elite 4 and champion for not doing any-fucking-thing to help me against Team Flare. Shit, We only saw Diantha like...twice in the whole story before fighting her? And it was at unimportant times.   Alder was everywhere, watching you train, watching you grow, giving you advice so you'd become stronger, and what's more the E4 and gym leaders actually DID THINGS about the evil organization in Unova and GOT OUT of their gyms once in a while."

pokemon,3ds6dy,rondus18,9,Sun Jul 19 06:19:17 2015 UTC,"the RSE story was great when those games first came out but now every game since then (except FRLG and HGSS) has used the ""evil team seeks legendary to use for their own calamitous goals"" formula to some extent. i'm not sure how they would step away from that formula except maybe to go back to a simpler RBY-style journey in which the legendaries are things you just happen to come across (huh? what's this spiky bird doing in the power plant?) because you're such a great trainer. the HGSS approach of coincidentally becoming worthy of confronting legendaries because you've proven yourself throughout the game might be the way to go.  gen 5 was interesting because it asked powerful questions and got you invested in the characters around you. when N was talking about cheren and bianca and said this:   Poor Bianca has faced the sad truth that not everyone can become stronger.   oh, man. that hit me hard, and i'm a grown man (at least on paper)."
pokemon,3ds6dy,zaro27,5,Sun Jul 19 12:50:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think the story of the games works if it's just your success story in this competitive landscape. Even RBY had this battle against Team Rocket that you wandered into, and GSC kept that up. I like the teams from RSE beyond because they have goals and in some cases clear ideologies that parallel at real life groups to a certain extent. I think it would be cool to have a game without such a team, or where such a team is only a minor player, but there would need to be something else to give the story the kind of weight many of us have come to expect.  How about a game where a natural disaster, one not caused by humans, happens mid game and your gym run is derailed to try to salvage it? How about a game where your rise to power is driven by a goal that's at least partly financial, like raising money for something?  Maybe you're tasked with finding something particular in the region and earning badges and being more powerful is simply what you have to do to pass more dangerous terrain?   I know a lot of people would dig a straight up adventure game, but I'm here for the story. It doesn't have to be a story about an evil team, but it does have to be a little darker and more urgent than ""I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was."""
pokemon,3ds6dy,phi1997,3,Sun Jul 19 13:41:27 2015 UTC,"battle against Team Rocket   yeah, i meant in the context of defending the region from the enemy team and everything. team rocket didn't care about legendaries (odd, since they'd probably make a fortune on the black market), but by defeating them, you showed that making the world a better place doesn't always mean stopping an apocalyptic event. it's about doing the right thing because it's right, not because grownups are inexplicably putting the weight of the world on your shoulders   a natural disaster, one not caused by humans   it could be caused by the legendary box mascots, maybe based on gaia (ground, signature ability that works like gravity) and uranus (flying, maybe a signature ability that removes charge turns for flying moves), who are in conflict as foretold by an ancient regional prophecy. the enemy team is a cult that wants to exacerbate the conflict for some reason. maybe they're nihilists, and the theme of the game is to prove that life has meaning. the third legendary could be based on chaos (normal or dark) and be the nothingness from which arceus created everything. the base 600 legendary could be based on cupid and be a symbol of love being a big part of life or something."

pokemon,3ds6dy,KrishaCZ,2,Sun Jul 19 20:44:27 2015 UTC,Ash Gray is basically the first gen anime in a game. Much harder and really good battle AI for the Pokemon League and Elite Four. Some parts have extra battle rules (like no items allowed). It is pretty hard though so keep that in mind.  Snakewood is a game with an interesting story to say the least. You play in a post apocalyptic world and a lot of really random stuff happens. The map is basically Hoenn with a few modifications and the story gets weirder every second. I have a slight bias towards this one because it was my first ROM hack but it's not too long so you could probably have quite a bit of fun playing it.
pokemon,3ds6dy,flyingvenusflytrap,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:32:19 2015 UTC,"It's the exact same story.  ""You are a trainer who wants to become a pokemon master so you must gather 8 gym badges across the region. Meanwhile an evil organization wants to take over that region/do evil stuff.

Open up full breeding earlier instead of holding it back for end-game. Branching side quests and more quaint quests like the X&Y post-game. More mega evolutions for weaker/seldom used pokemon. Fewer mega evolutions for legendaries and sudo-legendaries. Introduce a way to breed pokemon to be in specific balls even if a mother cannot be caught in the desired ball/make all pokemon catch-able so you can get all starters and fossil pokemon in something other than a standard pokeball. Make hail not hurt some other types of pokemon like sandstorm so it can be more viable in weather battles. Give ice types a resistance to something else so they do not only resist just ice.

You can breed a Nidoran♂/Nidorino/Nidoking with a Nidoran♀ but not a Nidorina/Nidoqueen.  Those two can't even breed with a Ditto, so if you had a Nidorina/Nidoqueen and wanted either Nidoran, you'd be out of luck unless you put one of the males or a Nidoran♀ with the Ditto.

pokemon,3ds6dy,TheCracchen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:23:24 2015 UTC,"While breeding has made leaps and bounds since its introduction, there are still some ways in which it can be improved, feel like the next logical step, and fall in line with GameFreak's pattern of making the games easier to get into for new players. The first of these things that needs to be added is an item equivalent of the Ability Flame Body and let it stack with the Hatching O-Power and the ability it is based on. This is because of Pokemon like the pseudo-legends, Rotom, and Eevee that take quite a lot of step cycle to hatch. Either that, or make hatching time for pretty much all Pokemon uniform and have it not take as little time as breeding a Magikarp, but not as much as a Starter. The second is that the Ability Capsule not only should cost at maximum 36 BP, but that it should be able to change a Pokemon to its HA and vice versa. It takes less time to grind out another breedable with your desired specs than it is to get the item that was made specifically for the situation of you producing a breedable whose only flaw is its ability. Next is that Ditto should be able to breed with other Dittos. The fact that many competitive players need to obtain generated 5IV, 6IV, and optimal HP Dittos specifically for breeding should they want to do well competitively on cartridge is astounding. And finally, the thing they need to add the most is the ability to alter a Pokemon's IV's after its capture or generation as an egg through the use of in-game money. In-universe it would make sense, humans have made many artificial Pokemon and have successfully manipulated Pokemon DNA to extreme levels, so why not only alter it to make a Pokemon that is a little bit stronger? 23 of the 27 Shinies that I have bred using optimal or slightly suboptimal parents I can't use competitively due to this and the nearly useless Ability Capsule. Having an IV or two not be optimal, having the wrong ability, and having both be outside the player's power to rectify thereby rendering them helpless to change it through hard work is extremely frustrating. This would also solve soft-resetting for IV's on Legends that you can capture in-game, as well as event ones. Not only that, but it would make money actually worth something, because ever since Gen 4 (with the exclusion of ORAS), money has been pretty easy to grind, but once the postgame rolls around, goes largely unused, especially for casual players. I don't want breeding to be too easy, but it seems that I have biked along Kalos' Route 7 more than I have actually spent capturing, training, battling, and having fun on in-game and on WiFi. Breeding is important, but it's not gameplay, it's time inflation and most any reduction on that front is welcome in my book."
pokemon,3ds6dy,Ongorom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:40 2015 UTC,"For HMs, they should make it so when you teach the Pokemon a HM, it can learn it as just a technique or a battle move. If it learns if as just a technique then it doesn't take up one of its four slots and can be used outside of battle but not in battle; also, a Pokemon will be able to have as many HMs (or even regular moves that work outside of battle like Dig and Flash) as it can learn in its techniques list.   If it learns it as a move, it can use it both inside and outside of battle, but it takes up one of its move slots. HMs learned as moves should also be able to be deleted at any time."
pokemon,3ds6dy,joescool,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:56 2015 UTC,Maybe change breeding so that making a competitive team doesn't utterly consume your life unless you cheat. Maybe if they just shortened the hatch cycle or just gave us a way to guarentee we'll hatch specifically what we want without the RNG bullshit.  And I still can't believe that after all these years we still need to waste some of our limited move slots on HM moves.

pokemon,3ds6dy,Anonymous--Rex,0,Sun Jul 19 05:25:07 2015 UTC,"For a while I've been wanting them to reboot the series and start with generation one again. Then they could just slowly release each generation (And maybe just forget that some pokemon ever existed..). Lots of these are just my opinions but I think it would be a great way change the game up.   Some form of multiplayer that allowed players to enter other players world even if just 2-4 at a time. Exploring a Pokemon world with friends would be fantastic. New challenges could be introduced along with puzzles.  Uncatchable legendaries. I wish Legendaries were more of a challenge and required you to use multiple Pokemon to defeat. Maybe even other players. Better end games. Have other trainers with fully trained teams for some extra challenge at the end of the game. NO HMS. They suck seriously. If you have a water pokemon you should just be able to ride it same with flying. MAYBE they have to be a certain size but to modify their movies for it is just annoying especially when the game requires you to know so many. New rare Pokemon types. I always liked how certain Pokemon in the trading card game could be different types. These could be rare pokemon to catch in the game. Make DARK versions of pokemon, (Dark Squirtle, Dark Evee, Dark Nidoran) and have their sprites unique and movesets modified. There could also be even rarer types such as Water Charmander, Grass Squirtle, Fire Bulbasaur. Just 2 or 3 unique forms for each pokemon. Finally I wouldn't mind seeing an overhaul to the battle system. I'd love to see some more advanced ways to fight. Have the environment influence the fight more, Certain moves more advantageous in certain areas or not effective. Just something to change it up even the slightest."
pokemon,3ds6dy,Ongorom,3,Sun Jul 19 07:06:49 2015 UTC,"All this changes sounds really nice but not in a normal Pokémon game, this would be to much. But in a spinoff with all this things would be awesome and I would play the hell out of it."

pokemon,3ds6dy,Livingexistence,-3,Sun Jul 19 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of requests:  Heatran can be either gender. They should be able to breed.   Volbeat and Illumise can breed with each other, despite being different species, and the result is random between the two. So, why can't Latias and Latios breed for the same effect?  For both of these, just have the frequency of getting an egg be fixed to once a week or month. In my opinion, they are borderline legendary, so that excuse to justify the inability to breed seems weak to me.   HMs: everyone hates them. They're so annoying to keep on your team, and they're a pain in the ass to forget. So, why not have a ""5th"" move slot for a single HM that could only be used outside of battle?"
pokemon,3ds6dy,Ongorom,8,Sat Jul 18 23:55:45 2015 UTC,"I think the reason legendaries can't breed (hold on a second, let me just kick this Phione out of the way) is because that would nullify their specialness. They're supposed to be rare and one-of-a-kind (anime doesn't count, they've deviated from the games a LOT of times before), not something you can fill boxes with easily. Lati@s were given genders to be more like counterparts.  I agree about the HMs, though. They keep on screwing up my teams >.<"
pokemon,3ds6dy,flyingvenusflytrap,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:38 2015 UTC,"Again, one egg a week or month. I'm mainly coming from a competitive background, and soft resetting for Legendaries that are (lore-wise) not even unique and should by all rights be able to breed is frustrating at times.  In addition, this would create a sort of community amongst the players: ""Hey, I have an almost perfect Latios. Anyone out there have a similar Latias and would be willing to help each other out for the next couple of weeks?"" It'd definitely be interesting.  Besides, the randomness of inheriting IVs will ensure that a week long gate on the eggs is actually fair, and wouldn't flood the community with 5 IV OU legends."

If you don't want a (most likely) hacked Ditto then I recommend catching a bunch of Friend Safari Dittos. Pokémon from the Friend Safari are guaranteed two perfect IVs. From there, you can chain-breed the IVs unto your desired Pokémon using the Destiny Knot.   I definitely recommend visiting /r/breedingdittos for a flawless Ditto though, as it shortens the procces considerably, and also produces 100% legitimate offspring.   EDIT: there are two kinds of hacked Pokémon. Those that are legal and those that are not. Although you can make a Magikarp with 999 in every stat, it'll never be used in a Rating Battle."

First up, male combees are common enough on the GTS, and as people who breed a Vespiquen for stats tend to offer up those combees for trade (maybe they think it's less awful if they've got good stats?), it's not uncommon to get a 4 or 5-IV combee in wonder trade like it's nothing. I have one of these right now from Wonder Trade.  If you have a male combee with solid stats, there are a number of ways you can use them to deliver certain key egg moves. Want a Sweet Scent paras for hunting Hidden Abilities in hordes? Combee is your guy (with the added bonus of Bug Bite to hold you over until it gets key moves like Spore and X-Scissor). Final moveset is something like Sweet Scent/Spore/False Swipe/(random offensive attack of your choice).   Combee can also be used to deliver bug buzz."

Sure Grass Knot is really good, because most Rock/Ground types are really heavy anyway, but still, no coverage. Hidden Power isn't really a move to consider, it's boring. I'd like to see some Dazzling Gleams on them (Fairy Egg group after all), maybe give them Petal Dance, even though they don't have petals, they Dance and they are Cheerleaders so technically, PomPoms can works as petals."

pokemon,3drcn6,Sensei_Ochiba,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:59:13 2015 UTC,I was thinking some crazy gimmick ability like stance change that lets it alter the distribution of its base stats.  It could also get special moves while mega evolved - perhaps depending on its stance.  Maybe have it double hidden power's strength.  436 bst or so is just enough to do something like that without it being too overpowered.  336... probably not.

pokemon,3drcn6,IntensePancakes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:49 2015 UTC,"Cherrim isn't inherently bad in doubles, it's just that he has no optimal partner. You want to set up Sunny Day for the bonus, but there's no easy way to go about it. If you use Drought you can't take advantage of the attack bonus, unless you switch in the Cherrim which is really slow. There are very few physical fire types to take advantage of the huge boosts, and less that even need Cherrim. Etc. IMO Cherrim isn't bad though, it can be really useful unique situations, and if they make a pokemon that synergizes more it can be really strong. A Helping Hand Sunny Day 1.5*Atk isn't something to be ignored. I tend to just put it with Victreebell at the moment when I can (otherwise I just don't bring it in). It's a really aggro, 1 dimensional start, but it can be effective if ignored."

If so, it make Electrode the best user of the move, but it is still outclassed unfortunately on other aspect. Like you said, Explosion can be use for ""suicide"" option, but aftermath is more appropriate since it always deal 1/4 of damage and can be use along another move to ensure to deal more damage than an Explosion because honestly even with 250 base power, it doesn't get good attack or even STAB on it so..."
pokemon,3drcn6,Kevyaga13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Correct. Electro Ball is a special based attack that increases in power based upon how much faster the opponent is, maxing out at 150 Base Power if the opponent's speed is less than 25% of the users. Against a paralysed opponent, it is almost always stronger than Thunder. Electrode makes great use of it, but Electrode isn't the best user of it. Mega Manectric has slightly less speed than it, 135 vs 140, but has significantly more Special Attack meaning it'll do more damage per Electro Ball than Electrode.  Also, forgot about Aftermath, it does work better than Explosion."
pokemon,3drcn6,Woowchocolate,3,Sun Jul 19 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"It actually does fairly well if you give it HP Ice and Electro Ball, along with two other moves.  Maybe Twave like /u/Woowchocolate said.

pokemon,3drcn6,UnholyDemigod,3,Sun Jul 19 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"If you don't understand it, I'll try to put it in layman's terms: Linoone's damaging moves are Extreme Speed (outspeeds almost all attacks), Shadow Claw, and Seed Bomb, which cover 263 Pokemon for super effective damage, 509 Pokemon for regular damage, and 2 Pokemon for resisted damage (being Bisharp and Pawniard), according to pokemondb.net. That's a lot of Pokemon! So what about power? Linoone is, well.. weak. With a 70 Attack stat, it still won't be dealing very much damage, even if it's super-effective.  Enter Belly Drum.  With a sacrifice of one turn and the risk of dying to pretty much anything, Linoone's lackluster 262 Attack quadruples into the monstrous 1048 Attack, turning it into a ""glass cannon"". Now that is something to be proud of. ""Okay, so what?"" you may ask. ""Its Speed only sits at 100 Base, which isn't outspeeding much. Things that resist Extreme Speed and are faster than it will kind of kill it."" Well, my friend, Linoone can hold a Salac Berry, which increases its speed by 50% at half HP (you should be at half HP because of Belly Drum), thanks to Gluttony (usually it activates at quarter HP). That way, it will outspeed Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross, and be able to KO them easily without a hitch.  Well, there's one problem: Linoone cannot normally learn Extreme Speed. It has to come from a Korean event that... kinda ended a few months ago. So yeah. That's a preeetty big problem. Only people on Showdown can really use Extreme Speed Linoone, which is one of the biggest selling points of it.  Maybe you'll get it as an Egg Move from Arcanine some day, Linoone."

pokemon,3drcn6,Wildcard709,2,Sun Jul 19 00:08:54 2015 UTC,Volbeat is worthless. Its stats are shit and it's not even good enough to be an HM slave. I don't really hate any Pokemon but I make an exception for Volbeat.
pokemon,3drcn6,theguywhoismeh,9,Sun Jul 19 01:28:30 2015 UTC,Four words: Tail Glow Baton Pass.
pokemon,3drcn6,Ultimategrid,2,Sun Jul 19 02:07:01 2015 UTC,There are so many other Pokemon that can set up and Baton Pass out though. Also it's not going to be alive long enough to use that set haha.
pokemon,3drcn6,theguywhoismeh,2,Sun Jul 19 03:15:24 2015 UTC,But passing Tail glow is a unique niche. Although it does face competition from Smeargle.
pokemon,3drcn6,Ultimategrid,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:01 2015 UTC,I think its ability prankster can make it more viable.
pokemon,3drcn6,Sariel471,2,Sun Jul 19 07:34:06 2015 UTC,"Smeargle can run spore to give it a free turn of setup though.  I do agree however that Volbeat is better in this case. Still incrediably niche, but usable."
pokemon,3drcn6,Ultimategrid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:07:28 2015 UTC,"Spore is much less viable with grass types being immune to it now though. Imagine trying to spore only to have them switch in Breloom, or even Venusaur/Ferrothorn. It's not a pretty sight and as someone who loves grass types dearly, I can say I've ruined more than a few smeargles because of people not considering this.  Which is odd, because iirc Sap Sipper has also always worked to stop it."
pokemon,3drcn6,Sensei_Ochiba,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:12:31 2015 UTC,This is obviously something you have to take into consideration whilst using the strategy.
pokemon,3drcn6,Ultimategrid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:45:22 2015 UTC,"Just saying, it's not an issue for Volbeat, though the cost/benefit still doesn't exactly seem to even out."
pokemon,3drcn6,Sensei_Ochiba,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:17:59 2015 UTC,It shares a name with a pretty decent rock band. That's kind of cool.
pokemon,3drcn6,MirrorB,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:22:11 2015 UTC,"Volbeat is a good weather setter in PU metagame.It gets both sunny day and rain dance + prankster.  Also its low speed allows for slow u-turn, which safely brings ally pokemon after weather is set up.  It also can annoy opponent with prankster encore/T-wave or baton pass a tail glow."
pokemon,3drcn6,MrNiksor,0,Sun Jul 19 03:50:57 2015 UTC,Volbeat is awesome. I've made a team just for him.  Confuse Ray + Tail Glow + Substitute + Baton Pass with focus sash I've taken pokemon down with just confuse. It isn't the most efficient strategy but is fun.

I also bought Blue Mystery Dungeon for the DS back when that released, but have never made it far into the story, it takes much longer to level up and your character Pokemon don't evolve normally."

Not wanting to escape orb the fuck outta there and waste all my efforts, I decided to soldier on. After many tactical resets, we finally made it to Rayquaza at the top. ""Oh boy"" I thought to myself, ""the dungeon was hard, Rayquay here is probably gonna whup us to kingdom come, but let's see how we do"" Team Blitzhexen proceeded to win the final boss on the first shot."

Not to mention the seeds you can use. Blinker to make him constantly miss, violent to jack up your attack, stun for paralysis, sleep, and not to mention the hunger seed, which makes all his attacks do only 1 damage..."

Having to catch Pokemon in trainer battles makes them far more difficult, especially when every battle is doubles and you need to withstand two attacks per turn.

pokemon,3dozpx,spectrosoldier,46,Sat Jul 18 02:34:04 2015 UTC,"Damn, I guess it's time to resort to my backup theory.   If that Pokemon really is Zygarde it must have shed its reptilian form and grew arms just for the sake of getting ripped.   Just what the hell kind of steroids are in those Mega Stones anyways?    How much more swole can Pokemon get??"
pokemon,3dozpx,drkitteh,23,Sat Jul 18 03:23:49 2015 UTC,"Swampert isn't buff, he's filled with air"

pokemon,3dozpx,swirlythingy,6,Sat Jul 18 12:25:13 2015 UTC,So he basically has Anchor Arms?

pokemon,3dozpx,TheChurchofHelix,5,Sat Jul 18 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I certainly wasn't expecting to have the opportunity to say ""I told you so"" this early.  ""Diamond on the forehead"" my arse."
pokemon,3dozpx,iceytoa1,3,Sat Jul 18 10:40:47 2015 UTC,"The green blob(s), or what I call the Thousand Eyes, swarm together with Zygarde to create this new Zygarde forme :3"
pokemon,3dozpx,TheChurchofHelix,3,Sat Jul 18 16:06:57 2015 UTC,actually kinda makes me think that the blob could just be an extension of zygarde that  it uses to monitor the ecosystem.
pokemon,3dozpx,Creror,8,Sat Jul 18 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"Could it be...   A 3rd and ultimate fusion of Zygarde and Kyurem?  Or even...   A Primal Reversion of Zygarde? I mean, Kyogre becomes enormous when he revertsm"

pokemon,3dozpx,mjangelvortex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:41:34 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  It could be a pure Dragon type with stats something like 125/180/110/180/110/95 and an ability that gives a 50% bonus to Fire, Ice, and Electric type moves (as if it had STAB for each).  The key to its Primal Reversion could be the Dark & Light Stones that Zerkrom & Reshiram revert into to hibernate; Kyurem-Black would have to hold the Light Stone and Kyurem-White would hold the Dark Stone.  Its moveset would be limited by whichever fused Kyurem form used to initiate the Primal Reversion (as Kyurem itself can learn no Fire or Electric moves) but either way it would not be limited to only Physical or Special attacks, even if one of its offensive stats is completely uninvested.  I'm not holding my breath, but I definitely see this as a possibility in the future.  It's like the Pokemon Primal Reversion was made for."
pokemon,3dozpx,cooldeadpunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:06:12 2015 UTC,B-b-b-but Zygarde is green
pokemon,3dozpx,Stormageddon222,2,Sat Jul 18 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Which means the chances of it being Kyruem are low. A few days ago people were fighting over whether it was Zygarde or Kyruem (before it split into the three dragons). Since it's green, it's likely to be Zygarde."
pokemon,3dozpx,cooldeadpunk,23,Sat Jul 18 21:32:01 2015 UTC,I figured it would be Zygarde. It seemed very needed. It was very noticeable that he was significantly weaker than Xerneas and Yveltal as well.
pokemon,3dozpx,SaiyanMaster95,29,Sat Jul 18 03:02:49 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that the popular fan theory of Zygarde's new forme getting a new ability that essentially makes the battle an inverse battle is true. That way it can actually be more powerful than both Xerneas and Yveltal while still keeping its original typing (that and I think Inverse Battles are such a neat idea and want them to have more uses ingame).

Gamefreak should take their time to make the games as good as they can be, and I rather wait a year  then to rush out a game because people are impatient (no offense). I hope the Pokemon Company (and therefore Gamefreak) understand this.   This is coming from a European which won't even get Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon this year (but I'm already happy a new PMD is coming so it's no big deal)."
pokemon,3dozpx,Soapdropper,2,Sat Jul 18 13:03:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'd rather they worked on optimisation to work towards a stable 3D 30 FPS in large battles like hordes and triples.   And also, PMD isn't coming out this year for us? I hadn't followed it much and this saddens me :("

pokemon,3dozpx,iccirrus,10,Sat Jul 18 02:19:59 2015 UTC,It's still worth it to see the movie though.
pokemon,3dozpx,TheShaymin,6,Sat Jul 18 04:24:32 2015 UTC,So this is basically confirming a new Pokemon game with Zygarde as the main legendary in 2016.

pokemon,3dozpx,micmanguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:46:20 2015 UTC,What are the chances its an alt form for Volcanion?
pokemon,3dozpx,IrreductibleIslander,5,Sat Jul 18 07:46:20 2015 UTC,Very unlikely now we have a better quality image. It's 99% going to be Zygarde.
pokemon,3dozpx,grambolini,0,Sat Jul 18 09:14:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing it, the design looks to slick and the shoulder... things look like they could be a transformation of Volcanion's ring like adornment. That is unless I've missed a new screenshot but I'm still going by the very vague silhouette."
pokemon,3dozpx,spiderobert,4,Sat Jul 18 11:51:37 2015 UTC,"The head part. The fact that it's a crown of hexagonal shapes can only really point to Zygarde. The arm/shoulder parts look like flat, elongated hexagon shapes attached to another adjacent one, which is like the pattern on Zygarde's tail."

pokemon,3dsu13,WillExis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:22:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which is odd since they invented the move specially for pikachu"
pokemon,3dsu13,Stoner95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:31:31 2015 UTC,Probably got retconned because its actually an Egg Move for Pichu and can't even be learned by Pikachu no matter how much you grind. They probably realized that after giving Pikachu the move and then dropped it for Electro Ball without ever explaining what happened to Volt Tackle.
pokemon,3dsu13,Kira-the-Cat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:04:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt the writers reasoning for taking Pikachu's most powerful move was because ""Ya can't do that in game!"" I mean, this is the BW anime we're talking about. You know, the one where Type Advantages don't matter, Kyurem can change form on a dime, and somehow have pre-timeskip Bianca and post-timeskip Cheren at the same time,  But in all seriousness, it was most likely to give Pikachu a 5th Gen move for promotion's sake."
pokemon,3dsu13,WillExis,2,Tue Jul 21 09:09:48 2015 UTC,"Probably because Volt Tackle was harder and more costly to animate wheras with Electro Ball the BW animators can just do the ""replay this one clip over and over again"" thing that they were infamous for."
pokemon,3dsu13,mjangelvortex,6,Sun Jul 19 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"The anime, and the games aren't the same canon. At no point in the anime do they state that they're limited to only 4 moves.  4 move slots is just a game mechanic anyway. There's no lore reason for it in the first place."
pokemon,3dsu13,TyFIGHTER420,2,Sun Jul 19 03:12:06 2015 UTC,Agreed. The Pokemon in Pokemon Adventures aren't limited to 4 moves either. The reason we have it in the games is for balancing purposes. Imagine how broken some Pokemon would be if they could have more than 4 moves.
pokemon,3dsu13,mjangelvortex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:35:33 2015 UTC,The closest thing to evidence we have of there being a move limit on the show is team rocket's Meowth saying he can't learn more moves because he used up his move slots to learn to talk. Pretty weak if you ask me

You hardly see the same family twice, heck, you only see wild Fletchling, never Fletchinder, and only on the first route.  I think the xy dex should have been 250 members and spread out the families more (like have wild Fletchinder on that route you ride Rhyhorn, Diggarsby found in the Kalos badlands, wild Meowstic around the lost hotel, etc...)  Kalos does not have that regional feel that others have because there's too many Pokemon, you don't feel who lives where."

Kids fucking love Pokemon Trozei, Pokemon Dash, etc.   Too young to even play video games? They love the anime/movies too. Lots of animals and bright colors and all that."

This was in Crystal. He said you could kill a Pokemon by using an item that was a spear, which could be acquired in one of two ways. The first was, sometimes when you use cut on a rhyhorn, when the battle is over you get its horn, which can be used as the spear. The other way was to search trees, like the kind on the game borders. So I searched like every tree in Johto and Kanto looking for a spear.  Not because I really wanted to be bad and kill Pokemon, but because I wanted to experience such a big secret."

pokemon,3dmj3a,DamngedEllimist,19,Fri Jul 17 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"It has something to do with using growl on the Slowpoke a certain number of times (I think 6?) when you're fighting the trainer before activating the Mew glitch. That lowers the Mew to like level 1 or 2. Then, you go to a patch of grass, and you make Mew the first Pokémon you send out, then call out every other Pokémon in your party to effectively spread out the XP awarded to beating the Pokémon in the grass. If Mew gets less XP than is needed to level up to lvl 2, the game thinks that instead of getting say 60XP, it awards the Mew 600,000XP, effectively leveling it to level 99 in one battle.  There are detailed instructions online of how to do it but that's the general idea."

pokemon,3dmj3a,Juvination,81,Fri Jul 17 21:27:51 2015 UTC,"I found a really bad recording of that video. But do yourself a favour and watch this thing, it's absolute priceless. If nothing else watch it for the scene with Giovanni, it is literally 4Kids boasting because they KNEW how hard this shit was going to hit.   I swear that first song is part of the first movie's soundtrack. Also the woman who is Ash's ""aunt"" cannot pronounce Pokémon correctly. His fucking cousins as well. This entire family is hilarious."
pokemon,3dmj3a,aznrunnerman,30,Fri Jul 17 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"I have this VHS too. It actually was my first exposure to Pokemon, aside from the Japanese kid in my class whose parents bought him Green so he could practice his Japanese.  It's hilariously campy but 8 year old me seriously thought it was the greatest thing ever and got me so hyped about Pokemon. I'd watch it over and over. God knows what my parents were thinking."
pokemon,3dmj3a,LICKS_CAT_BUTTS,14,Fri Jul 17 16:36:27 2015 UTC,"As a hype video for a kid in the 90s? I would have been excited too at that age, man. But the bit with Giovani made obvious how fucking silly this video was."
pokemon,3dmj3a,tadashiryuu,10,Fri Jul 17 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"The kid inside me was still stoked to watch it and even boarded the hype train a bit.

pokemon,3dmj3a,CharlestonChewbacca,8,Fri Jul 17 18:08:10 2015 UTC,I feel betrayed that that lady had a Pikachu pedometer game (I forgot the name) before Red and Blue even came out! I don't think that was announced until yellow (with Gameboy Color) came out a year or so later!
pokemon,3dmj3a,journemin,6,Fri Jul 17 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought it was really odd how Pocket Pikachu showed up in this even though it didn't come out for a few years after this would've been sent out.   I remember seeing shelves in Woolworths that had Pokémon Yellow and Pocket Pikachu in a display, maybe they just delayed it for marketing reasons.   News of Pokémon Yellow's development must have reached them before they were due to release it and they just held off to sell more units."

pokemon,3dmj3a,QuallOfDuty809,11,Fri Jul 17 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"Actually she's pronouncing it right. Theres even an accent at the ""é"" in Pokémon, that makes the sound of the ""e"" more like in the word ""red"". But everybody started tossing around 'Pokimon'.  Edit: I don't know from where are you taking that she says ""Pokemin"" the first time she says it, it's clearly an ""o"" sound, and also, ""Poké"" comes from ""pocket"" (You know, pocket monsters). How do you pronounce that? ""Pockayt"", ""Pockeet""? I don't think so. It's clearly an straight flat (roman sounding) ""e""."

pokemon,3dmj3a,philabusterr,5,Fri Jul 17 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"No, that accent makes the e sound more like the ay sound in day. Also she's saying pokemin not pokemon, I think that's what he's referring to."

pokemon,3dmj3a,ElementalThreat,2,Fri Jul 17 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"Shit that was fun! I loved the early parts of pokemon so much.  That scene with Spearows still gets my heart racing. It is just done so well. The drama! The tension! That moment Pikachu jumps at Ash's shoulder! God!   Not to mention it wasn't strategy that Ash used against Pigeoto. It was stupidity. But back then that stupidity was fun. He wasn't supposed to know any better. And when he pulled the same shit in Black and White? Yeah, Iris called him ""such a kid."" Misty helped Ash! Iris just sucked and gloated!  But why were they saying 150 pokemon? Why not 151? Mew was part of the original so...  Honestly, who started singing at the end? Heck, who sung all the song?! Epicness I tell you. Nowadays, it's just CG battles with different kinds of ""Power Beam!"" attacks. It's all just rehashed battles from previous generations."

pokemon,3dmj3a,diditforda666,64,Fri Jul 17 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"I so wish Sugimori would go back to that style. The current one is so generic, but the watercolours have such charm."
pokemon,3dmj3a,trickstyle48,35,Fri Jul 17 17:09:35 2015 UTC,"I think most of the designs suffer from the reason there can't be watercolors: overdesigning. Most of the pokemon in Gens I and II were fairly simple, often times just an animal with a ""twist"", and their natural appearnces lent to the simple style associated with watercolors. So many Pokemon today look almost sci-fi and have bits and pieces everywhere. Painting them in watercolor today would look weird."
pokemon,3dmj3a,RenaKunisaki,58,Fri Jul 17 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, some of them look quite good.   Ex: Volcarona, Gen V starters, Gen 1 starters mega evos, Tyrantrum, Kyurem, Cofagrigus, Gen VI starters, Yveltal, Mega Manectric, Mewtwo Mega Evos, Metagross."

pokemon,3dmj3a,VanillaThunderbolt,8,Fri Jul 17 21:56:53 2015 UTC,That Cofagrigus looks like its about to get ready for some kinky fun.
pokemon,3dmj3a,Soperos,10,Fri Jul 17 21:57:51 2015 UTC,Came in here to say this. I love the look of the Gen 1 pokemon art. my cousin had the guide book too and i remember flipping through and loving all the pokemon as like an 8 year old kid. I think i still have the pokedex book for Gens 1 and 2 and its so awesome
pokemon,3dmj3a,GalacticNexus,78,Fri Jul 17 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Man this makes me feel so old... we must be around the same age because I remember all of this.    Btw I can't be the only one who loves these original illustrations, that Charizard on the front box art for the original Pokemon Red is still my favorite drawing of any Pokemon ever... and even that Mewtwo on the second-to-last image is so sick! Definitely my favorite depiction of him as well... it's crazy how there's a significant portion of this sub who was too young to remember all this!  edit: grammar... it's 1AM in Australia ha"

pokemon,3dmj3a,AyeBreBreloom,13,Fri Jul 17 15:55:14 2015 UTC,You are correct. The only reason why i included that was b/c just yesterday some made post of the Pokemon colosseum Jirachi disc asking what it was. So i figured post mine and include pics of the process of how you had to go about getting rare Pokemon. It was ridiculous..lol
pokemon,3dmj3a,AyeBreBreloom,8,Fri Jul 17 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"oh yeah! I remember that post yesterday, this is extremely helpful for that person. I actually remember the bonus disc QUITE well  Story time   So I was like 11 when that came out and my Mom drove me and my buddy to the movies (He was obsessed more so than I was about the games) and right next to the movie theater was a walmart. She gave both of us enough money for the movie and then dropped us off. So my buddy says he wants to go into Walmart and check something out. So I stayed in the theater and played in the arcade room. Then my buddy comes back with that damn gamecube disc and says he can't go to the movie because he bought that. As a worry wart little kid I was mortified! YOU HAVE TO GO PUT THAT BACK WE HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE, MY MOM DIDN'T GIVE YOU MONEY FOR THAT SHE GAVE IT TO YOU FOR THE SHOW! It was a really trifling time for a pre teen"

pokemon,3dmj3a,shadowdra126,23,Fri Jul 17 21:53:56 2015 UTC,This made me realize something really particular and unimportant. What happened with Mew's feet? They had little shoes of a darker color in original artwork (see OP and http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-129348013119471/pokemon-promo-card-mew-4.jpg) but now it isn't there. I wonder if later designers just forgot it was like that.
pokemon,3dmj3a,aidotato5,6,Fri Jul 17 15:54:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I bet they forgot.... probably no pictures used as a reference when they made the new version....
pokemon,3dmj3a,shadowdra126,5,Fri Jul 17 17:03:31 2015 UTC,There's a few examples of things like that in the earliest depictions of some pokemon.
pokemon,3dmj3a,aidotato5,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:50 2015 UTC,I miss when Mew looked less like a fetus.
pokemon,3dmj3a,shadowdra126,18,Fri Jul 17 23:27:32 2015 UTC,This takes me back.  Sticking the light into the cable port to play at night during a sleepover. Renting Pokémon Stadium and the adaptor from Blockbuster. Heading down to Blockbuster to print out my Pokémon Snap stickers. Getting the Pokémon TCG demo disk and realizing that only one of the decks could actually win.  It almost makes me want to go out and get a copy Blue version. Lost mine years ago. Maybe I'll clean up my GameBoy Color to get it in working order.
pokemon,3dmj3a,Archdragon1992,5,Fri Jul 17 17:01:28 2015 UTC,Wow...you have to be like..my brother from another mother. Everything you just explained is soo on point for how things where done with these games during that time.
pokemon,3dmj3a,PowerForward,10,Fri Jul 17 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"More like sister from another mister. And also probably adopted.  90's Pokémon was great! I'm not saying Pokémon now is at all worse (it isn't), but the nostalgia is real and powerful. There was also waiting for 10AM to roll around to watch the anime, going to the mall and finding the toys that were left over or imported from Japan, the struggle of trying to find somebody who didn't pick Kabuto (no longer a problem, praise Helix), collecting the Gym Leader cards for your favorite Gym Leader, and the plushies.  Oooooooh, I almost forgot about the plushies. My grandmother worked at KFC so I got all of those for Christmas. Still have them too. I'm considering getting a bunch of the Zubat one to put in every room of the house so visitors can never truly escape Zubat."
pokemon,3dmj3a,Jishkah,8,Fri Jul 17 17:31:28 2015 UTC,Oh..sorry about the sex screw up...but OH MAN! The KFC thing just reminded me that I have those gold 24K Burger King Pokemon stored somewhere!!!

pokemon,3dmj3a,Keranu,10,Fri Jul 17 15:01:28 2015 UTC,Your mew cards are nice but the Lilypad Mew (as it is called) is worth a pretty penny - around $130 on ebay as a PSA 9
pokemon,3dmj3a,AHarderStyle,6,Fri Jul 17 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like it was worth more than that back then..lol, but thanks!"
pokemon,3dmj3a,Theltcdanzer,9,Fri Jul 17 15:27:03 2015 UTC,"I will say that card prices fluctuate with the popularity of the franchise - so anytime a new main series game is released, prices tend to sky rocket, so as soon as Z (or whatever) comes out, it will most likely sell for more :) thanks for showing us your stuff!"

pokemon,3dmj3a,elgatomojado,8,Fri Jul 17 15:41:41 2015 UTC,There's a way to check the symbols and editions of the cards to determine rarity(?). http://m.wikihow.com/Value-Your-Pokemon-Cards This article can get you going in the right direction. Once you know what your looking for maybe browse eBay or any local card shops for the value. I hope that helps a bit!

pokemon,3dmj3a,GalacticNexus,9,Fri Jul 17 18:42:23 2015 UTC,"I remember, when I was eight years old (I'm 22 years old, now), having a Pokémon-themed birthday party. Pokémon tablecloths, Pokémon balloons, et cetera, et cetera. My parents even got me the ""Hey You, Pikachu!"" Nintendo 64 bundle! It was pretty rad. I also got Pokémon Stadium, too. I very, very strongly remember that birthday party.  Anyway, when I was 19 or 20 years old, I went over to a friend's house - and she had so many things hanging up on her wall. Drawings, paintings, streamers, you name it. One thing caught my eye, however - a Pokémon napkin. It was blue, featuring Ash, Brock, and Misty (I think), and it had a certain design/texture that screamed nostalgia to me - it was the same napkin design as the napkins that I had for my eighth birthday. Just... wham, bam, nostalgia. Memories.  Two years pass, and I purchase the napkins, outright, on Amazon. Here's a picture. I was actually surprised that Amazon was selling it, but I'm glad that I purchased it, even if it was a bit expensive for what it was."

pokemon,3dmj3a,bitch_im_a_lion,8,Fri Jul 17 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I was that kid who bought both versions. I was later justified in it since my sister loved to copy my hobbies and we would usually each get a different version. Having two gameboy systems at any given time was a blessing for a Pokemon fan like myself.  Those Pokemon cards may not be super valuable but the game does still seem profitable. I've still seen good cards sell for $20+, it's no Magic or Yugioh level profit, but it's still possible.  Pokemon was such an awesome marker in my childhood growing up. So many awesome memories and developments in technology. Pokemon is actually what taught me, and many others I'm sure, how to read."
pokemon,3dmj3a,rubyshade,5,Fri Jul 17 16:07:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for that nostalgia trip. Really took me back to when things were more simple, and there were no alternate forms and things like that, and Pikachu was kinda chubby and Nintendo Power. It was nice just going through that and bringing back some fond memories."

pokemon,3dmj3a,7thGRiM,5,Fri Jul 17 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"Oh man the Jirachi bonus disk! I have a story about that one.   Right around the time XD Gale of Darkness was released, I was big into my Sapphire game and was doing my best to catch em all without a Gameshark or E Reader or whatever it was called. I was missing the typical Pokemon, Mew, Celibi, Jirachi, Deoxys (I think?) and a couple other of that tier legendary.   This certain week I was at my cottage and my little bro and I were inside playing Pokemon and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals. Mom was tired of it being super nice outside and us being inside, so she said we were going to get ice cream at the closest town, which was a 20 minute drive away, but we couldn't bring our game boy advanceds. So, we reluctantly shut down Ruby and Sapphire and go to town. We get our ice cream and are browsing the stores when we see this tiny run down looking game rental store. Well, my brother and I waste no time running right to the GameCube section and going through the games. They had the usual selection of second hand games, but then HOLY SHIT I see the Pokemon Colosseum Jirachi bonus disk.   After begging my mom (who was not impressed we went into town to get away from video games only to want to rent video games) that we needed to rent this game, we ended up doing the 48 hour rental. Mom was actually pretty cool, I remember not wanting the store people to hear how important this game copy was, and mom understanding about the fact this was a once in a life time game opportunity. We were allowed to rent it as long as we did what we needed with the game then spent some family time with everyone.   We rushed back to the cottage and I get to work transferring Jirachi to my Emerald, Sapphire and my brothers Ruby games, while my brother went to tell the neighbours and all the kids on the lake that we have the Jirachi bonus disk. Half hour later there's a line of 5-16 year olds outside my cottage all waiting to get the Jirachi put onto their game.   I was the coolest kid on the lake that summer.   Man, now I want to transfer all my Pokemon from Pearl to Alpha Sapphire... I want my WSHMKR Jirachi in my current game!"

I played so many hours as a kid in the late 90s early 2000's  I remember when i was around 16 or 17 we found a box with all of my pokemon games in it and the books and all this stuff. We were having a garage sale and my mom made me sell it. I was pretty sad, but a few hours into the sale a young boy probably around 9 or 10 took a real big interest into the box full of all my pokemon things. His mom told him he knew they couldn't afford it, they were only going to these to look for clothes. I ended up giving him the entire box for free. I wonder if he still has it, he would have to be around 18 now maybe 19.  edit: changed 90's to late 90's and early 2000's."

pokemon,3ds6zh,timmy4513,2,Sun Jul 19 00:16:52 2015 UTC,"I've also been devastated with the lose of years of good Pokemon training. It has made me paranoid for it ever happening again. I don't have a solution for you problem, but I have advice for the future.    If you do not have a subscription to Pokemon Bank, its a good idea to keep one (It's only like $5 a year I believe) and have your ""Prized Pokemon/Shinies"" stored there. If you are using a cartridge versions of the games, try investing in a AR Powersaves Device. This backs your cartridge games up to your PC. (This method is not supported by Nintendo and may or may not mess with your games in other ways. It also allows for cheats to be applied into your games. Don't be a cheater!) If you are of the digital variety, you are going to want to use the 3DS's save data backup feature. Very simple, this feature is.  Back up your saves periodically. I like to backup on Saturday, and also all my other important games. (You can also copy the  SD card's contents to PC every so often, but it can take some time if you have a lot of digital software installed.) If and when you decide to upgrade 3DS hardware, when using System Transfer, ALWAYS USE ""PC TRANSFER."" (Its the safest and most convenient method)    I know its a little ""crazy"" but it is sad to see all the progress lost. I hope this helps a little and I'm sorry you had to experience this."
pokemon,3ds6zh,timoglor,3,Sun Jul 19 01:21:03 2015 UTC,The save data backup utility does not work with Pokemon because it could be used to duplicate Pokemon easily.
pokemon,3ds6zh,randomdice101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:03:54 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah you're right. This was more general advice and I didn't remember that detail. But since the digital versions of Pokemon and their saves are stored on the SD card, copying the SD card contents to a PC every so often should still work though. I will admit, I haven't actually had to restore data like this yet, so I guess if someone has tried this, they could let us know, but in theory it should work unless Nintendo really worked out having Pokemon not able to be backed up."
pokemon,3ds6zh,timoglor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:10:24 2015 UTC,I've never tried but also I haven't seen anyone making a guide to cloning Pokemon involving just copying your ad cards data so I don't think it will work that way. It's probably encrypted in some way
pokemon,3ds6zh,randomdice101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:30:18 2015 UTC,I did some looking into it and people report that it does save some data to the system itself to make sure it is the latest save. So Pokemon (as well as animal crossing) really aren't recoverable at all. Nintendo really don't want people duplicating Pokemon. Sucks really that this is the case. :I

Next year's movie will likely be the last Gen VI movie since the last Gen VI game comes out that year.  2017 will likely be the year of Gen VII's debut.  Meaning, this teaser is business as usual assuming Game Freak isn't throwing any curved balls.  EDIT:  Looks like I messed up my facts a bit.  The last movie of a generation usually comes out the year a new generation is released, usually featuring a new Pokemon.  However, the Advanced generation movies did have Lucario and Manaphy star in their own movies back to back, so something similar could be happening here as well."

pokemon,3dpnpi,COMELY_LIL_KNT_69x,41,Sun Jul 19 07:18:32 2015 UTC,I always kind of theorized that the lack of pokemon in gen 6 was because they were splitting the generation in half across two sets of games. This could be the second half.
pokemon,3dpnpi,Grayspence,30,Sat Jul 18 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory.  Although, Gen VI presumably ends next year, with VII debuting in 2017.  This could be the teaser Pokemon for that gen, like Lucario and Zoroark were in the final movies of those respective generations."
pokemon,3dpnpi,bothanspy1337,12,Sat Jul 18 06:22:54 2015 UTC,Don't forget Munchlax in the Gen 3 anime (both May's and the one in M07).
pokemon,3dpnpi,alexjuuhh,5,Sat Jul 18 06:40:53 2015 UTC,Munchlax and Bonsley also both appeared in Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness.

pokemon,3dpnpi,MolestTheStars,11,Sat Jul 18 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"Actually, the last movie of a generation usually comes out on the same year as the new generation starts in Japan.    For example, the Latias and Latios movie came out in 2002, same year as Ruby and Sapphire. The last gen 3 movie, the Manaphy one, came out in 2006, also the same year as the start of gen 4. Gen 4's last movie, the one that had Zoroark in it, was released in 2010, which is the same year as gen 5's release. And lastly the Genesect movie, which was the last gen 5 movie and had Mega Mewtwo Y in it, came out two years ago, just like XY.  So if we follow this pattern and this new Pokemon is really from gen 7 and next year is the last gen 6 movie, that would mean that gen 7 also starts next year and not 2017.  That said, I don't think that this Pokemon is from gen 7 but rather Zygarde related."

pokemon,3dpnpi,AmansRevenger,4,Sat Jul 18 11:06:27 2015 UTC,"A blue pentagon appears on a Pokemon's summary screen if it was obtained in gen VI.  When the ORAS demo was data mined, it was discovered that there are six games that will cause the blue pentagon to appear, each game having its own number: 24 and 25 (X and Y), 26 and 27 (OR and AS), and 28 and 29 (???).  Each game has its own ID number, which is assigned to a Pokemon when it is obtained so all current and future games know exactly where it came from.  And since we know Game Freak plans out their games on a pretty strict schedule, it's logical to assume that these are indeed the final two games of gen VI.  The question is what the games are.  Most suggestions are either X2 and Y2 or a Gen I remake to coincide with the 20th anniversary."

pokemon,3dpnpi,AmansRevenger,2,Sat Jul 18 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly, which is why I don't think that this Pokemon is from gen 7, at least if they continue that pattern with the movies. My guess is that the last gen 6 movie will be in 2017. I think this new Pokemon has something to do with that huge Silhouette that we've seen from CoroCoro which is most likely a new form of Zygarde.  It could be a similar case like Lucario and its movie which wasn't the last gen 3 movie even though it had a gen 4 Pokemon in it but I kind of doubt that."
pokemon,3dpnpi,Nightynightynight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"Lucario and Manaphy debuted back to back in their movies, so maybe they're doing that again?  I don't see a blob being some new form.  Like how would that relate to Zygarde?"
pokemon,3dpnpi,bothanspy1337,2,Sat Jul 18 11:16:38 2015 UTC,Munchlax and Togepi though.  Both were introduced years before their generations.  So long before that people often think they're Gen III and I respectively.

If something like this happens, then both forms can't be so vastly different from each other, they need to be complementary and similar (like White Kyurem and Black Kyurem or any other cover legendary up to date)"
pokemon,3dpnpi,gbanshee,8,Sat Jul 18 07:23:25 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't be vastly different from each other, mechanically at least.  There's no in-game reason why both forms can't have the same BST - I mean, if a blobby pink foetus could do it..."
pokemon,3dpnpi,swirlythingy,6,Sat Jul 18 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"Kyurem W is outright superior to Kyurem B.  Its moves better support its stats.  Plus, when they added Fairy type, it pretty much guaranteed that Reshiram would be better than Zekrom as well.  Let's be honest...it wasn't very balanced in B2W2...and with the 6th gen, the imbalance got even greater.  As for 6th gen, Xerneas has better typing, but Yveltal's signature move is way more usable (it doesn't need a dedicated strategy like geomancy does).  And, until ORAS, Kyogre was just plain better than Groudon because rain is just better than sun in most cases (plus, non-primal Groudon isn't even fire-type so no STAB stacking with the sun until now).  GF hasn't always been very good at balance."
pokemon,3dpnpi,cuddleskunk,4,Sat Jul 18 09:59:59 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about balanced stats, it doesn't matter that much for the vast majority of Pokemon players. 2 cover legendaries should never look so vastly different, it's simply a bad design choice. They should have some common elements, some shared concept. A green blob and a giant winged serpent? That's like slapping Giratina Origin Forme and Diglett as version mascots. Just slap the same stats on them and it's cool, I guess? No, it's not."

pokemon,3drzin,vpreon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:06:51 2015 UTC,I'll find the link but the theory is that shuppet is a form of ralts when it has low happiness. The similarities are the horn on their head. Shuppet uses its horn to feel and feed off of people negatives emotions and ralts uses its horn to feed on happy and uplifting emotions. There was even the thought that they were going to implement it in Ruby and sapphire because this was the first Gen with incense or herbs or whatever raised stats but lowered happiness. The thought was those were added and they wanted added pokemon to use low happiness but the idea was scrapped due to them not wanting people to intentionally make pokemon unhappy.

pokemon,3dnxdc,cyvaris,8,Sat Jul 18 00:46:49 2015 UTC,"Well inflation rounds it out to about $31 in 2015. Considering the game was selling out of stores easily back then, it's still a respectable deal tho"

pokemon,3dnxdc,RainbowSylveon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:44:45 2015 UTC,It'd be $31.99 in today's value marked down from $39.99 (Average 3DS Nintendo game).

pokemon,3dqixk,hellotanuki,10,Sat Jul 18 13:59:11 2015 UTC,What about the Missingno glitch? You do that on the coast of Cinnabar!
pokemon,3dqixk,_PlatinumWarrior_,10,Sat Jul 18 14:22:34 2015 UTC,I knew about THAT glitch! Hell that's probably why I believed there could be a magical Master Ball store in the middle of the ocean.
pokemon,3dqixk,karinasuperkul,7,Sat Jul 18 14:26:56 2015 UTC,Or he did the Missingno glitch that can infinitely duplicate any item in your bag. One of the steps is to surf of the coast of Cinnabar. No Gameshark needed.
pokemon,3dqixk,MountainDewde,6,Sat Jul 18 14:28:48 2015 UTC,Either way his intent was the same!
pokemon,3dqixk,MountainDewde,7,Sat Jul 18 14:29:35 2015 UTC,"Similar, more sinister story: Years ago, I had a friend who was a former (maybe on again/off again) enemy.  One time he 'accidentally' broke my Gameshark.  Thinking about it years later, I don't think it was an accident.  I'd be willing to bet he's also the one that stole my Blue version, which was all gamesharked up.  Last I heard, he's serving time for burglary."
pokemon,3dqixk,Meltian,7,Sat Jul 18 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, and also his older brother claimed that if you beat the Elite 4 a thousand times, you get to walk around in the Hall of Fame room, and there's a bathroom with two powerful trainers named Naked and Pojo."

Heh, yeah, the trip up was quite the tale. See, I thought I blocked enough time for the trip, and the first problem was I took way longer to get ready than I thought I would. Then we had to take some stops and.. oops. did not account for that. Aaand for the first half of the trip I was feeling sick and my friend thought we should go home, but we where already halfway and I didn't want the tickets to go to waste. So we kept going, and my dad suggested we play a CD. he plays Jethro Tull. and then I get all pumped up because I remembered how Tull was my first concert. x3   And so, we're just about to Vienna and we're about 15 mintues late. Okay, no big deal, right? Buuut then Vienna's a big place. next problem... didn't account for the in-city travel time to GET to the Filene Center. Oops. So we ended up being almost an entire hour late.  Still, we had a fun night. After the show, we met this couple, the guy was cosplaying as N, and the girl was.. the PCF of White. And after we parted, I dragged my friend into the autograph line. took a bit of arguing and a push from the security guy and ultimately, we got our posters signed.  It kinda sucked that we where late though, cuz by the time we got there, the plushies sold out! Oh well, my friend bought 2 wolf plushies in the Gift Shop and gave me one. x3"

pokemon,3dqpht,LightningLuxray,5,Sat Jul 18 22:43:27 2015 UTC,Surprising? Not in the least. I'd expect nothing less. Chatot is a threat.

pokemon,3dqpht,TyFIGHTER420,3,Sat Jul 18 17:51:12 2015 UTC,"No, you're right. Chatot is a low-tier pokemon. It's just one of my favorites, so I like to hype it up.  It can be effective in the right hands though. A lot of people underestimate it, and don't expect it to hit so hard. It does have the strongest Boomburst in the game, and Nasty Plot only pushes that farther. It can be a monster, if it wants to be.   Honestly, what does anyone have for a well played Chatot?"
pokemon,3dqpht,sable-king,2,Sat Jul 18 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"Based on my experience, Mandibuzz is a good counter. I swept 5 of a guy's entire team with Chatot after using Nasty Plot once, but then when Mandibuzz came out, not even Boomburst was able to KO it, and it hit back hard with Knock Off, taking advantage of Chatot's incredibly weak defenses."
pokemon,3dqpht,TyFIGHTER420,2,Sat Jul 18 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"Only the SpDef variants though, which I believe are less common. Any other variants have a chance to be OHKO'd at +2. If chatot has life orb it secures the KO on most variants, even ones with mild SpDef investment.  +2 252 SpA Life Orb Chatot Boomburst vs. 248 HP / 108 SpD Mandibuzz: 438-516 (103.5 - 121.9%) -- guaranteed OHKO  The only true Chatot counter is anything that has soundproof."

pokemon,3dqpht,mjangelvortex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:37:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think Chatter is banned from Smogon. The offical Pokemon games used to ban it but now in Gen VI it's not banned anymore. Currently as far as Smogon goes the only Confusion inducing move that's banned is Swagger (and even though Swagger is banned from Smogon singles, it might not be banned from their Doubles metagame). Things like Flatter, Chatter, and Confuse Ray are permitted since they don't raise the opponent's attack."
pokemon,3dqpht,Lukethehedgehog,-2,Sun Jul 19 10:05:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a shit-tier Pokémon. It's just that randbats make it so every Pokémon is at least viable by evening the levels (i.e. OU Pokémon are around Level 76 while shitmons such as Raticate are Level 99).  EDIT: Do people now downvote you for telling the truth? Chatot is a terrible mon competitively. It may have won this time, but, again, randbats makrs everything viable."

Eggs can't migrate at all, they must be hatched first.  If you are using an action replay or another cheating device then probably anything you use it for won't be able to migrate.

pokemon,3dpojv,mrsinger186,12,Sat Jul 18 06:35:22 2015 UTC,"This is true, especially since Charizard is like twice the height of Ash. You'd think there'd be a little relative consistency, like at least amongst the original 3. Flying creatures are always going to be less dense than most land mammals, and even more  so a turtle.  I did see they got a bit close with Torterra, who 683 pounds, but then forgot that again with Carracosta who's 4 feet tall and 180, yet a turtle covered in rocks of all things. So I know comparing different generations is probably a bad idea and it seems they did a little thinking. It's just seems like when they came up with weights for the orginal 3 they  were like ""DUH, turtle short, so he wieghs the least."""
pokemon,3dpojv,mrsinger186,14,Sat Jul 18 06:47:03 2015 UTC,"See, I feel like Torterra would be MASSIVE, like being able to actually carry a decent-sized ecosystem on it's back (so like 15-20 tons in weight, at least 15 or 20' around and 12' high, imagine a big elephant size-wise); for example. I know why it was so much smaller, just because all the other starters were small and they didn't want to make one so much bigger than the other. but in the original 3's position, it seems that that's how they decided weights."
pokemon,3dpojv,Bobita817,4,Sat Jul 18 06:55:24 2015 UTC,"Thinking of elephants, Mammoswine is 8' tall and under 650 pounds.

The worst offender has to be Wailord though. 47'07"" and 877.4 lbs. picture here  Yeah..... that weighs less than a small cow..... okay!

pokemon,3dpojv,ColonelKoopa,15,Sat Jul 18 07:25:51 2015 UTC,"No, Wailord is LITERALLY less dense than air. Somebody on here calculated it a while ago."
pokemon,3dpojv,KaSlaps,2,Sat Jul 18 13:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a go.  These are our formulas:   Density (∂) = mass (m) per volume (v)   ∂=m/v  Mass in kilograms (M) = Force in pounds or Weight (W) per Earth's gravity (g) [Newton's Second Law kinda]   m=W/g  Volume of a Cyllinder (V) = pi (π) times radius squared (r2) times height (h) [or in our case length (L)]    v=πr2L  Conversion feet to inches, inches to meter.   1 foot = 12 inches, 1 inch = 0.0254 meter    Our given constants are:   L = 47'07"" and W = 877.4 lbs., the picture of a Cylindrical body, and g=9.81m/s2    Let's start by converting our units   L = 47 feet * 12 inches + 7 inches = 571 inches * 0.0254 meter = 14.5034 meters   and find our mass   m= 877.4 lbs / (9.81 m/s2) = 89.4393 kg   Our volume gets tricky since we don't know the diameter or radius of Wailord but we can calculate by using proportions in the pictures. At first glance it seems it's 1:3 width/height to length ratio. I found this picture of a grid that confirms this 4:15 blocks approx., 5:15 would be 1:3 so it's close enough   V= π(14.5034/3 m )214.5034 m = 1,064.9196 m3   Thus:   ∂= 89.4393 kg / 1,064.9196 m 3 = 0.8399 kg/m3   According to: Source the density of air at sea level at 60°C (140°F), close to the hottest recorded on Earth 58°C (138°F), is 1.060 kg/m3.   Conclusion: Wailord is lighter than any air on the surface of Earth"

pokemon,3dpojv,metalflygon08,7,Sat Jul 18 11:58:59 2015 UTC,"Except in Wailord's case it makes a bit more sense since it's kind of based off a blimp too (kind of like how Wailer is also based off a beach ball). That's why it's the float whale Pokemon. This time it wasn't just them messing up the weight, Wailord being less dense than air was definately dilberate."
pokemon,3dpojv,mrsinger186,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"Manoswine SHOULD be the size of a mammoth, and Wailord SHOULD weigh as much as an irl whale, but that does not seem to be what Nintendo wants.   Edit: I think that part of it is the whole 'entered by a 10 year old' bit, but I think that after gen I, Nintendo had to go with what they set as canon for heights and weights and had to make every other Pokemon in the future around that weight set, because having gen I be super light compared to everything else would be weird."

pokemon,3dpojv,aurthurallan,4,Sat Jul 18 17:07:02 2015 UTC,I think they just need to balance out the game for weight based moves like grass knot.

pokemon,3dpyfe,ski61,6,Sat Jul 18 12:38:36 2015 UTC,This is something that worries me. Mega evolutions are cool and all but I don't like the idea of applying a mega evolution to everything rather than giving some Pokemon proper evolutions. Gen IV was the last game to do that iirc.
pokemon,3dpyfe,Spirst,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. Mr Mime and Jynx should follow suit with electibuzz and magmar where they get actual evolutions. I would hate to see this go away from the series and mega evolution take over
pokemon,3dpyfe,ski61,8,Sat Jul 18 19:11:06 2015 UTC,Jynx should have a regular evolution like Electabuzz and Magmar. Also I think Snorlax would be nice ( since you put Sudowoodo and they both block the roads ).
pokemon,3dpyfe,Dragon-Snake,7,Sat Jul 18 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"None. Give real evolutions to pokemon with no evolutions who desperately need stat boosts.

pokemon,3dpyfe,Irish_McJesus,3,Sat Jul 18 16:59:54 2015 UTC,I think they should take some of those bad megas and make them into regular evolutions.
pokemon,3dpyfe,DICKBUZZSAW,5,Sat Jul 18 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"Here's my list of what's likely to come:   Butterfree Slowking Froslass   Basically the uncompleted pairs from ORAS will be completed. Give Beedrill and buddies megas, sure, but don't leave their counterparts alone.   Dragonite Hydreigon   Both XY and ORAS had two pseudo-legendaries with megas so I expect the pattern to continue.   Milotic Flygon Luxray   Fan favourites for new megas.   Zygarde   Since we 95% chance will get XY continuation, Zygarde getting a mega/primal/whatever is essentially guaranteed. I wouldn't be surprised if Xerneas and Yveltal got some love.   Chesnaught, Delphox and Greninja   With a likely return to Kalos, surely the starters should get some extra love this time around instead of the Kanto ones. However, if Game Freak chooses not to give the Kalos starters megas, then some other starter set should get them, like the Johto starters.   Crobat or Malamar   I have a strong feeling that Xerosic will get a mega in the next game and these are the two pokémon he had. Of course, my bet is on Crobat.   Mightyena Liepard Bisharp Drapion Honchkrow Masqurain Jumpluff Magnezone Mr. Mime Sigilyph Cryogonal Mamoswine Chandelure Starmie Probopass Druddigon   These are various pokémon that appeared prominently in XY as pokémon used by gym leaders, E4, Flare admins and story. I focused on ones from gens 1-5 and tried to pick the most believable candidates. These won't ALL become megas but they are among the more likely to get so expect a few names on this list.   Volcanion   So far every event legendary seems to get something special so why not?"

pokemon,3dpyfe,AsherGray,3,Sat Jul 18 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"I'd personally agree with you, but considering Mega Aerodactyl is a thing, I think that primal forms are reserved for legendaries as a sort of raw, untempered version of the pokemon. It's less about the time period they were in, and more about the abilities they have over the world (rain, sun, time)."

pokemon,3dnwvy,GregoryPippenbottom,4,Sat Jul 18 09:21:30 2015 UTC,"Specifically, the skin tones looked washed out and seem like they're still greyscale.  It looks weird.  Koga, for instance, has this bold purple outfit, but his face is this pale granite.  Also, another reason they look weird is you have a strange usage of color.  You're not sticking to a palette size.  Each sprite should have either 8, 16, or  32 colors depending on what hardware you'd theoretically be using.  Characters who aren't using them all can have more colors devoted to shading, dithering and other details.  Characters who are violating the limit need to have colors substituted.  It'll make them look cohesive as a sprite verses this coloring book look you have."
pokemon,3dnwvy,doodypoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"Considering how small the sprites are, if say 16 or 32 colors would be too much. Usually my rule of thumb is 1-2 shades to compliment the original color, and one highlight if I need it."

I'm debating on whether I should release the final as is which'll be only a little better than this quality, or if I should take this back to the lab for a bit longer and put in some more work. There are things that I like in this vid, but  there are things I think that can be pushed one more level. What do you guys think? And how do you like it so far?"
pokemon,3dqvyw,mdjustin,3,Sat Jul 18 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"Animation Student here, (actually have a qualification already, getting some more). I feel like you need to refine the animation some more, There are a few errors with how you are making certain objects move, such as the poke ball for Charizard, I noticed it sliding some.  I also think you should add some more stiffness to the cloth, it's moving and folding like silk. And I also think your models for Gary and Ash need a tiny bit more work. The proportions seem off, but that might be due to the puffiness of the cloth. Overall it is a nice animation, (cut down on that sand though, holy dust, if it moves that easy it should be a sandstorm judging by the wind sound.). and after a little more work, It will be somehting special."
pokemon,3dqvyw,mdjustin,3,Sat Jul 18 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"The models for Ash and Gary is probably what stick out to me the most atm. They aren't quite right yet. And yeah, that pokeball actually does slide lol but that was more of an export error than an animation one (I've fixed it since though). And I probably should tone down the sand a bit haha. Thanks for the feedback!"
pokemon,3dosmr,daigonite,9,Sat Jul 18 00:50:06 2015 UTC,A project I've been working on for the last 2 years. It's made significant progress since my last update and I'd like to show off my work.
pokemon,3dosmr,MintyFreshNipples,5,Sat Jul 18 00:50:37 2015 UTC,This is actually really cool.  Well done OP!
pokemon,3dosmr,mjangelvortex,4,Sat Jul 18 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"This is a very great idea. I listened to it on headphones (I even closed my eyes at some parts to get a better feel for it) and I loved the soundwork so far.   One of the problems I had with it is that the text is being read so fast that it's kind of hard to keep up. Do you have a speed setting for the speech like how the offical games have a speed setting for the text?   EDIT: I also have a few other critques that could help make this game better. One of the suggestions is, I think it would be a good idea if the characters had different voices to help differentiate them (at the very least the more important characters should).   The second critique involves the Pokemon themselves. I love how the Pokedex gives a description of how the Pokemon looks like. However, when you first encounter the Pokemon for the first time, you don't get a description of them. Since this is the player's first encounter with them, I think a detailed description of the Pokemon would really help and should be implimented. Maybe have three different settings for this: the first setting describes what the Pokemon look like every time they battle, the second setting could only do it for the first encounters with a new species, and the third setting would be no descriptions except for the Dex (like what the video did)."
pokemon,3dosmr,mjangelvortex,5,Sat Jul 18 01:58:58 2015 UTC,You can use some keys (n and b) to change the text to speech speed. This can also be changed in computer settings.
pokemon,3dosmr,mjangelvortex,4,Sat Jul 18 02:12:20 2015 UTC,"Oh good. I'm glad that like the real games, the player has the choice to run things at the speed they want and are more comfortable with."
pokemon,3dosmr,DrShrunk,3,Sat Jul 18 02:28:10 2015 UTC,"To address your edits, I think it's important to state that the video doesn't show full functionality.  The game doesn't have different voices because it uses text to speech functionality available with the computer. While mixing between voices would be cool, at the same time, not every player will have multiple voices to choose from. In addition, it's difficult to determine which voices are available for the switching. For an aesthetic change this is a lot of work.  For the second critique, there is a key that describes the enemy Pokemon in battle once you reach the Battle menu. I didn't really show this off in the video."
pokemon,3dosmr,Nas160,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:13:32 2015 UTC,Oh okay. That's understandable as to why there was only one voice then. And I'm glad to know that you do have a feature that describes enemy Pokemon in the battle menu as well. Thank you for clearing that up and explaining this to me. You're doing a great job so far and I can't wait to see some updates of this from you in the future.
