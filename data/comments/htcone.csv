I ended up with InsertCoin (Sense rom) and nothing else. No Xposed, no mods. It's extremely reliable and battery life is insane. And when I say insane, I say 4 days out camping with very light use and still some battery left. It has the basic essential mods and that's it.

I had an issue where I just sounded a million miles away and cleaned out the mic holes and was good. It continued happening and I eventually broke 1 of my microphones unfortunately. So just be careful while cleaning.

htcone,3e24q4,happyslaughterhouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:20 2015 UTC,For a lot of users the consensus is that M8KK > M8Lollipop particularly when it comes to battery life since you brought up battery. The only real complaint I have with my year old M8 is the camera though its not that bad considering I came from a 4S. Overall solid phone and if you could easily swap the battery I'd probably end up using it for a few another year or two after my contract is up
htcone,3e24q4,forthelol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:23 2015 UTC,"Are you comfortable with root access and swapping out custom ROMs? The stock ROM is bad with lollipop upgrade. It ruined the awesome experience I had prior to upgrade in 4.4 kitkat stock. Battery charge does not hold, kwyboard is aometimes sluggish and the change was noticeable after upgrade. Lot of ppl report good experience with custom roms. I'd suggest that route if it's okay with you. I don't have enough patience to mess around and haven't tried it yet.   If you are using gun metal phone and want to go naked, disappointment again. The back of very slippery. I've applied a cheap protector film from xtremeguard and it works! No compromise on naked look and much needed extra grip. Coming from m7 to m8, my other problem would be more generic with most phones today :  one hand operation is not easy.   Otherwise it's a great phone to use."

Flash that. Flash the correct version of the framework. Install the latest apk. Done.  There's basically nothing that isn't working properly on Lollipop now
htcone,3dznys,Mixographer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:08 2015 UTC,Interesting. I thought some of the newer stuff was only for 5.1? Is there no cut off? And do you have any idea what arma stuff the M8 is? I'm pretty unfamiliar with most of it.
htcone,3dznys,Mixographer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:03 2015 UTC,So the project kind of split off recently. The actual developer of Xposed has concentrated on getting 5.0 as polished as he could while he allowed another guy to develop a 'Super Alpha' (which in this case means Unofficial) version for 5.1.x.  Both are really stable on the M8 and I've gone between the two while utilising nearly every Custom ROM. The M8 has with absolutely no problems running any module I care to use.  The correct filename for our phone on 5.0 is xposed-v65-sdk21-arm.zip

The T-Mobile model has UMTS/HSPA+ on Band 2, 4, and 5, and LTE on Band 4 and 13.  The AT&T model has UMTS/HSPA+ on Band 2 and 5, and LTE on Band 2, 4, and 13.  The AT&T model is a better fit, as there's more Band 2 LTE than there is Band 4 HSPA+ (without Band 2 HSPA+) on T-Mobile, but you'll have to find it unlocked.  And unless someone has figured out a way to convert to T-Mobile without losing LTE Band 2, you lose WiFi Calling."

htcone,3dvpou,stevierar,3,Sun Jul 19 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"As someone who works at Carphone Warehouse, the phones sold at Carphone Warehouse are all unlocked (just not the iPhone). The phone should work fine on the AT&T frequency band, usually GSM bands are the same around the world, (I may be wrong). EU phones should work fine on a GSM carrier as long as that phone supports the frequency. AFAIK if the phone is unlocked and the frequency band a network operators is supported by the phone then it should be fine.  Did a quick search and came across this;   AT&T uses different frequencies with different technologies. In some areas, they may not have a license to use both frequencies and use one exclusively.  For GSM, they use 850 MHz and 1900 MHz.  For HSPA+, they use 850 MHz (Band V) and 1900  MHz (Band II) For LTE, they use 700 MHz (Band XVII) and some 1700 MHz (Band IV)  source  also this might help GSM World Coverage Map and GSM Country List  hope this helps"

It looks like the GSM bands are not the same as the UK but that the phone does support them, unless I have some special European model. Seems that 3G and 4G could work though!  I think what I'll do is take the phone and try an AT&T sim without putting any or much money on it, if it doesn't work - I've discovered that my UK network has a data roaming policy ""bundle"" that would allow me basic use of banking apps, uber, etc without running up a huge bill.

I've tried half a dozen times this year to try to use CM, almost entirely because of the themes and the money I've put into them, and it's not worked out every time due to smoothness, heat, and battery issues.  Each time I'd fresh install it, I'd reinstall just apps that were in my GPE install, so as far as I know none of this was due to a rogue app and Wakelock detector didn't see one either. Everything would be fine on CM for a while. It's never been unstable or anything, but after a couple weeks it'd be a wakelock hell. My most recent experience right before switching back to GPE, actually just about three days ago, had the phone awake for five hours straight. Power Nap for Xposed cannot lock any of this down, it is seemingly nonfunctional. With the wakelocks would comes a bit of heat that never goes away, as it was never sleeping, and there would always be obvious but noncritical smoothness issues with frame drops everywhere.  In short, it's gotten stable in regards to functionality and there's not a crash to be found, but be cautious as it may halve your idle battery life if it happens like all of mine have."

htcone,3dvgft,YYCtoTLV,3,Sun Jul 19 21:25:56 2015 UTC,Need more info. Do you have a custom recovery? Phone unlocked? If the answers are yes than you need an RUU. Rom Update Utility. I am not from Canada but if you google M7 RUU with your carrier you should find one. The phone is soft bricked and should work once the RUU is used. The RUU will run on you computer with your phone hooked up in fastboot mode.
htcone,3dvgft,SucaMofo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:25:48 2015 UTC,How long does an RUU flash take? mines been going for like 30 minutes and only still on the sending phase (1/6)  Is it safe to stop it somehow? I'm really a noob who installed the wrong kernel but still... sorry to thread jack.

htcone,3dvff9,Fluffygsam,2,Sun Jul 19 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"You need to have s-off if you don't have the 5.1 firmware from your carrier yet. You'd have to flash the latest international firmware, change CID, then flash Venom 3.1. I'm pretty sure they dropped support for older firmware when the base went to 5.1 Android. Your best option for getting more detailed instructions and support would be to post this question in the XDA thread for ViperOne.

You need to flash this firmware on your phone before oyu use this. For this, you need S-Off (sunshine app).  Once you have S-Off Follow this guide to flash the 2.10.401.1 international firmware, use the Combined NoWipe ZIP for that firmware. You can get it from that guide's download section.

htcone,3dr1mk,Galax-e,4,Sat Jul 18 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"It's working for me.   What I did:  Use all download links provided in OP.    Made a backup using Android Studio (you'll want to do this so you can install TWRP later easily anyway). Factory Reset RUU (but this was completely useless IMO - I would try skipping this step if you can) Connected to wifi and turned on location (might be because of KingRoot, but idk) Allowed unknown sources (also, from here on out, accept all permission requests unless you know otherwise)  Installed KingRoot Opened and ran it. It failed and restarted my phone at 51%.  Opened it again, and ran it. It passed 51% and around 53% it asks to install KingUser - let it.  After this, it'll ask to install some Chinese(?) app that you need to allow.  If you get to this point, you should be rooted with KingRoot (this is a temporary root btw) After this, uninstall the shitty KingUser and chinese app.  I installed SU here, but I don't think it was necessary. Do it just to be sure though. (Turns out this step is necessary, so do it). SuperSU should crash if you launch it. Ignore. OPen Sunshine. Go through all the tests. IMPORTANT: IT WILL ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO INSTALL AND THE SCREEN GOES AWAY VERY QUICKLY. IF YOU DON'T GET IT THE FIRST TIME, RELAUNCH Sunshine AND TRY AGAIN Phone might reboot. Asks you to get fucked in the ass by paying $25. Accept.  Allow phone to reboot again. This is where things get weird and your mileage may vary: the guide tells you to retry KingRoot, which I did. This worked for me, but Sunshine also launched itself as soon as my phone rebooted and said I was ready for S-Off. I believe this is less of a hassle and would have worked, but I didn't do it. So, if you do relaunch KingRoot, do the same process as 6-10. After this, you relaunch Sunshine. Follow the OP here. Relaunch KingRoot and repeat 6-11.  Here, my phone shut itself down and DID NOT REBOOT. I rebooted it myself and found that Sunshine was gone (for a second I thought I got fucked out of $25). But, it did work, for some reason the app removed itself. If you've made it to here, you should be S-Off'ed. If not, retry everything above and maybe be a bit more careful.    From here, install TWRP per this guide: Fastboot install method (this is where it's handy to have Android Studio installed and the drivers verified).   TWRP usually automatically installs SU, which you then have to launch and have the GUI install - this will relaunch TWRP And reboot your phone. AT THIS POINT, you should have S-Off and BE ROOTED: PROOF."

Sure some of the graphics were kind of outdated, but it was the most fast-feeling computing device that I can remember using in years. Plus the camera, for my purposes was beyond superb. I could go from lock scream to hitting the shutter button at a rate of around 5 times per second in only about a second, all while having autofocus work properly. That, and I could go through a full day of moderate-heavy use and still have more than 25% battery at the end of the day. Now, I'm lucky if I make it to 5pm without having to recharge, just by listening to music through headphones on low volume at work."

htcone,3dfyx9,jtrachtenberg,3,Thu Jul 16 01:48:09 2015 UTC,Your best bet would be to use titanium backup for your apps. Also you can use TWRP to make a nand backup.

htcone,3dfyx9,xlln,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:10:39 2015 UTC,Are you rooted? If you are you can backup everything using Titanium Backup. I use a separate app to backup SMS and Call logs.   The only way I know of to backup everything is to preform a 'nandroid backup' using a custom recovery.  Once you have backed everything up I would recommend just going all the way and getting S-Off via Sunshine. It will allow you to experiment with all kinds of ROMs more easily.

htcone,3de3kt,abrammdawg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Is it relatively new or did it just start? I had an M8 that would randomly restart about twice a day starting about a week after I bought it. After doing everything HTC support suggested (safe mode, factory reset, install apps one at a time until it happens then try to isolate which app is causing it) and finding that it would still do it after a factory reset, they offered to replace it through the warranty. I wound up just exchanging it at the Sprint store since I was still within the 14-day return period.  If you've had the phone for a while, try uninstalling any apps you've installed recently. Then, if it doesn't reboot, reinstall them one by one (probably one per day or so) until it does and you can figure out which app is causing it. If you can't figure out which app it is, do a factory reset (you'll lose all your apps/data) and see if it will still reboot. If it does, time to get a new phone through the warranty."

It was seriously the biggest hassle ever.   Short version: They refused to believe it was a phone issue and tried to tell me it was an app/software thing but after a factor reset and it STILL did it (It even restarted itself while resetting. That was cool.), it still took me MONTHS to get them to send me a replacement.   Good luck. :/"

htcone,3dfmfd,SucaMofo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:29:51 2015 UTC,Alright I glanced at the tutorial you said you used so I am guessing you DID unlock your bootloader and flashed a custom recovery from the toolkit.  I am running Bad Boyz Rom but there are a ton of others. Some of the more popular are GPE (Google Play Edition) and ViperOne or Viper Rom. Head over to  http://www.xda-developers.com/ and take a look at some of the roms. In the top left of the site type in M8 and it will take you to thing for the M8  Once you have found a rom make a backup of your currant rom via the custom recovery you flashed. Download the Rom and put it on your sd card and install it via the recovery. If it does not work (it should) you can always go back to your stock rom via the back up.   Look up some YouTube videos on installing custom rom. Pretty easy stuff.

htcone,3d9mma,life_goes_by_in_20s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:12 2015 UTC,In for guide as well!
htcone,3d9mma,leadCactus,2,Tue Jul 14 21:34:11 2015 UTC,"First, you need to make sure you have all the tools at your disposal. Step one is going to be to get the Android SDK on your computer to be able to commute between your computer and your phone using adb commands. But the android SDK requires java to run, so download and install it here. You’ll want to click on the JDK download link.  Now, you’ll need some tools from the android sdk. Go here, scroll towards the bottom, and under “SDK Tools Only”, select and download the zip for Mac OS X. Rename the folder “androidSDK” and move it to your home directory for easy access later in terminal. Now, in androidSDK > tools, double click on “android”. This should start the Android SDK Manager. Sometimes java decides to be a bitch though and it is won’t recognize and will error out (something to do with it thinking it’s on OS X 10.1.x instead of 10.10.x). Follow the prompt which will take you to the java download page again, install again, and it should work. Once Android SDK Manager starts, it’s going to have check marks on a bunch of options for you to download and install. Uncheck all of these, the only things you need checked to download and install are “Android SDK Tools” and “Android SDK Platform-tools”.   Now, on your phone, navigate to your settings app. About > Software Information > More (that’s the location you need to be in for Sense 7 at least, not sure about others. You need to find “Build Number”.) Rapidly tap on “Build Number” seven times, until it tells you you are now a developer. Go back to your settings main page, and go to Developer Options. Under “Debugging”, check “USB Debugging.” Also, check to see if “OEM unlocking” is an option. If it is, make sure it’s checked.  Now we test out to see if the phone and computer can communicate. Hook up your phone to your USB to your computer, and open up Terminal. Enter command:  cd ./androidSDK/platform-tools  Now enter:  ./adb devices   If everything is set up correctly, you’ll get “List of Devices Attached” with a number identifying your phone below it.   I should mention here: what we’re about to do will completely wipe your phone, so prepare accordingly. I’d remove your microSD card too.  On your computer, go to HTC Dev and register an account. Go to the unlock bootloader page, and select “HTC ONE (M8)” from the drop down list and proceed.   Now, back in terminal, type the following command:  ./adb reboot bootloader  Your phone will reboot to the bootloader. Use your volume buttons to scroll up and down. Highlight Fastboot and select it by pushing the power button. Once in fastboot, enter the following command:  ./fastboot oem get_identifier_token  It will return a big block of token that you’ll need to extract from the terminal. Copy the whole block starting on the line including all the <<<<>>>> and ending on the line including <<<<>>>>. Paste this into the default TextEdit app on your mac. Remove all the “(bootloader)” entries and spaces until you only have the block of ID token left. Copy this block, and paste it into the HTC Dev website guide that we’re pseudo following.   I can’t view the rest of the directions from there, but follow what HTC Dev says to do, it’s fairly straight forward. I’d recommend moving the .bin file they email to you to your platform-tools folder so that you don’t have to change your directory.   Proceed to unlock your bootloader by following the directions on HTC Dev. This will wipe your phone. Let it reboot, then you’ll need to set it up enough to be able to get to the settings app. Follow the aforementioned method to “become a developer” and make sure USB Debugging is enabled. Type this command:  ./adb reboot bootloader  Highlight fastboot and enter it again. Now it’s time to flash a custom recovery. On your computer, go here and download the top link, twrp-2.8.7.0-m8.img. After it downloads, rename it to “twrp.img” (be sure you don’t accidentally rename it “twrp.img.img”) and move it to your platform-tools folder. Type this command in terminal:  ./fastboot flash recovery twrp.img  and then   ./fastboot reboot  Let your phone boot up, then command:  ./adb reboot bootloader  This time, select and enter Recovery. You are now in TWRP recovery. Select “backup” and check that Boot, System, and Data are all checked. Slide to back up.   In TWRP recovery, select Reboot > System. Now you need to get the supersu zip on your phone to flash in TWRP. Go here using your phone’s browser and download the zip. Using terminal:  ./adb reboot recovery  In TWRP, select Install. Select Download from the list. You should see the supersu zip here. Select it, and slide to flash. In TWRP, select Reboot > System.  Congrats, you are now rooted!"

htcone,3d17oi,Shadow_Death,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"The one thing you will love right out of the box is the fact that your hands will no longer have to assume the ""cup"" position when you go to watch videos.  The M8 should have much better battery life than the iPhone 4s could dream of but some people have had issues with worse battery life after updating to 5.X from 4.4.4.  So far the fix for this seems to be doing a factory reset after you update.  Another thing I'd do is check out this website if you haven't already: http://forum.xda-developers.com/htc-one-m8  If you were big into jailbreaking your iPhones then I'd also look into rooting your m8.  If you get your phone and it's still on 4.4.4 or older you can use sunshine which will cost 20ish USD and it automatically unlockes the bootloader, turns S-off, and roots your phone.  This will give you the option of flashing other roms to your phone if they are compatible with your carrier.  The dev community is pretty good.  If you don't plan on rooting your phone then I'd go ahead and update to 5.0.x and wait for that next update.  The m8 will be getting an official Sense 7 update within the next so many months and with it the ability to download themes as well as make your own to customize your phone's looks. (Note: the Sense launcher updates through the play store so you can download custom themes for that. However, until the full Sense 7 update pushes out it will only apply to the launcher.  Later it will also theme the messages, phone, etc).  Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHaLOUc0noM  This is the m9 but that update should hit the m8 as well.  Also... HTC has one thing that Apple doesn't.  HTC doesn't push out updates to change the UI very often.  They got past the OTA carrier update method by putting their HTC software in the Play store.  So the launcher, camera, gallery, etc all update from the play store instead of having to be pushed out over an OTA.  TLDR; it's going to be drastically different from the iPhone but in all the right ways."
htcone,3d17oi,Shadow_Death,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"Okay this has always confused me, I don't understand what exactly rooting does. People always say how customisable android is, so what does rooting do that makes it better? This is a genuine question! What is a ROM? Is it like a skin? Does it replace Sense 6/7?"
htcone,3d17oi,Shadow_Death,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"To start off, in iOS as you may know jailbreaking your phone allows you to install third party markets. This is not to be confused with rooting four device. In the Unix and Linux world root is the equivalent to having an administrator account in windows. Rooting your phone allows you to make changes to the /system partition. Programs like adaway use root to write adblock lists to your host file. This in turn blocks ads by making the program think that the server isn't there.  A rom is the OS itself. On iPhones you've been restricted to iOS and only iOS.  On Android phones there are so many different flavors of Android to choose from. On these phones you could install a custom version of HTC's sense based ROMs or... You could install basic AOSP (Android open source project).  Right now im running ADRENALINE 2.4. This particular rom is running Android 5.0.2 with Sense 7 ported from the HTC One M9 to the M8.  So in a way a rom is basically the entire OS that you can flash to a phone. What they do or contain depends on the developer. Because Android itself is opensource The developers can modify every aspect of the OS."

htcone,3d17oi,Nebucadnzerard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Some roms do add new features and some remove seemingly useless features.  The ROM I mentioned before shaved a huge chunk of bloat out of the stock HTC Sense rom. For example, the stock rooted OTA (over the air) rom that gets pushed out to Verizon M8's is 1.6GB in file size. ΠΣΘ's ADRENALINE-2.4 weigh's in at 662.7MB.  He shaved roughly 1GB off the rom's file size.  Now that's compressed data and not the final size of the OS once it's flashed.  The best way I can explain a rom is, think of all the files and folders on your c:\ drive of your computer (if you're running windows).  A rom is all of that compressed into a zip file with a script that tells recovery how to install it. Recovery then runs the script and extracts the content of the zip file to the proper locations in your phone's storage.  Where I say Android shines where apple doesn't is if you do get a hold of a modified apple iOS image you have to have your phone tethered to your computer to do it.  Android is all self contained.  Usually what I do when I root my devices is I will find the most up to date guide and see if it is relevant to my device's software, make sure the version numbers match as well as carrier information.  (I've never heard of carrier information making any difference but you never know).  After rooting my device I will install a custom recovery. (Most root methods guide you through this step as well.) I then do a complete ""nandroid"" backup. This is literally a full backup of the OS itself and all of your data.  This way if you mess something up, as we all do and always will, you will have an out. In the event of messing up on a rom flash you can reboot back into recovery then wipe system, data, and cache.  Then tell it that you want to restore from backup. All without having to be connected to your computer.  The best part is that forums link I gave you, people are constantly monitoring the Q&A section because other users have problems as well.  BTW Welcome to the dark side. :)  My sister and her husband were loyal iPhone users until they got their Galaxy S5's they haven't looked back since.  Oh yeah I completely forgot to mention.. the M8 has the ability to import from apple devices.  http://imgur.com/a/hOHWo"

Another tip is that if you got the GSM carrier version of the phone, and if you're not against rooting/modding. I could convert the phone to Developer rom, so you can by pass carriers during the phone update process."

Verizon has closed pretty much all known exploits and a bunch of us are waiting for the sunshine team to release a version of their tool that works with lollipop Verizon M8.  If you were s-off before the OTA you'd have been golden, but I made the same mistake; shiny new phone that offered to upgrade immediately; I accepted the upgrade to lollipop without doing my research first and can't s-off mine either.  The only way to s-off the phone is to find someone with a fairly expensive HTC java card; there are a few people over on xda-developers offering this service but you have to mail them your phone.

The strong 3G may actually be coming from a Verizon tower that your phone briefly roams on before finding the native Sprint signal, which always takes priority no matter how weak it is.  Another possibility is that the 3G network is overloaded (and that wouldn't be much of a surprise on Sprint) and they're offloading you to the less congested 1x."

htcone,3cf1jg,Alonehorizon,3,Tue Jul 7 12:12:52 2015 UTC,"Today I updated my phone to the latest firmware, which where I am is 1.40 something, and just plugged my phone in at 5% left and the estimated charge time is 13 hours http://imgur.com/pnY6TCk? I have never had a time this long shown before, max I have got is 8, even after running the phone dead..   Sounds like either it's not fully plugged in, or the estimate is not yet accurate (takes a couple minutes to get a decent number).   I know the latest update was supposed to decrease heating while charging, but it hasn't made charging slower has it??   That's 2.x (5.1), not 1.4 (5.0).  If you're S-Off, you can do a dev conversion if you'd like.  I recommend following this guide. You'll get an OTA immediately.  Specifically, here is what I did:   I followed this guide. It's pretty straight forward. Only issue was that I had to switch to Windows and install ADB on Windows (which had some issues) in order to use HTC_Fastboot.  The commands you'll need are (in order once you're plugged in, have htc_fastboot installed and are in download mode):   fastboot oem writemid 0PJA11000 fastboot oem writecid BS_US001 fastboot reboot-bootloader cd (whatever directory the RUU is in) htc_fastboot oem rebootRUU htc_fastboot flash zip (whatever you renamed the RUU.zip to). You may have to do that twice. htc_fastboot reboot (if it didn't reboot by itself)"

htcone,3cf1jg,jimbopouliot,2,Tue Jul 7 12:30:41 2015 UTC,Are you using a 3rd party charger? Or are you connected in a computer's USB port rather than a proper charger? Because that would explain it. Try the original charger or one you're sure would be of good quality.

I personally would recommend CM12.1 over GPE as you can keep S-ON (unlocked bootloader is all that's required) and root can be enabled and disabled via Developer settings as needed. Allthough I'm not 100% sure if your bank will see it if disabled so don't quote me on that.   If you're still S-ON, I'd say give CM12.1 a try since it's the free option and doesn't require playing around with the CID/MID and you can quickly check if the bank detects root (it's disabled by default, you need to enable in Dev and download SuperSU from Play Store)."

htcone,3cceyt,Towelbit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"Just to confirm, did you do a factory reset after getting the Lollipop upgrade?  On a lot of phones, that helps.  Lollipop was a big change and there may be a lot of KitKat stuff bogging down the works.  I had the M8 until recently and performance was fine on Lollipop for me.  I don't think I even factory reset it, but I knew if I did have problems that should be my first move.  Other than that I don't there is any way to unlock or downgrade on a Verizon M8 that has been updated to Lollipop."
htcone,3cceyt,InvaderDJ,3,Tue Jul 7 05:24:46 2015 UTC,"Yep I did factory reset it and it made it great for about a week. Then back to the same crap, and a slow phone. Guess I am stuck though. Never buying an HTC phone again."
htcone,3cceyt,InvaderDJ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:14:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting.  Could it be a misbehaving app?  I didn't have the M8 on Lollipop for a long time, but I think I had it for at least a few weeks and in that time I didn't notice it getting any slower.  HTC has IMO the most polished skin of the major manufacturers and feels faster with lesser hardware than something like Touchwiz on Samsung's phones.  I'm having issues with my Nexus 6 right now, I'm tempted to pull my M8 out of storage and to see if it really tanked."
htcone,3cceyt,InvaderDJ,2,Tue Jul 7 06:21:05 2015 UTC,I wish I could pinpoint it to an app but I am pretty sure it is something to do with the way HTC made this update for Verizon specifically.

When they started going wonky, i alternated between a few, trying to see if that was the issue.  I talked to HTC support and they said there was a known issue where if a battery completely drained it could somehow decide it was fully charged and refuse to take power from the outlet. They said their was an update going out on the 8th to fix the problem.  The newest one has started charging again though. Tried all those different steps to no effect, left it plugged in just in case, and then it just started charging on it's own again. Very strange but hopefully that's the end of it."

There are are a lot of xda threads with instructions on how to do this. These are the best I found with a quick search.
htcone,3cclsv,sportsdude814,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"What was said above. You need to know what you have done to your phone. If you put GPE on your phone then you should be unlocked and maybe S-Off.   Turn the phone off. Power all the way down. Then hold the volume down button, while hold the volume down button press and hold the power button. Hold both down at the same time.

I take my phone off the charger and end the day usually around midnight with about 25% left on average with fairly heavy use. I can sometimes make it in to the middle of a second day. When OP is saying ""overheating"" he means getting warm. Overheating would imply getting hot enough to cause issues. It gets warm (not hot, and not uncomfortable) when watching 1080p videos at full brightness for an extended period or playing a relatively intensive game. More noticeable when charging. Really a non issue in my book as it never gets anywhere near what I would consider ""hot"" and many other devices have been measured getting even hotter under load."

htcone,3c8j4z,wamowamo,2,Wed Jul 8 13:55:04 2015 UTC,If you still have your iPhone you can transfer all your contacts easily over bluetooth. In settings on the M9 tap 'get content from another phone' and follow the prompts.  Also don't forget to turn off iMessage on your iPhone and deauthorize your number with Apple or you won't get texts from iPhone users. It helps to send your contacts with iPhones a text so their phones don't try to keep sending you iMessages that you won't get.  Enjoy your new phone!  Edit: I like the Otterbox Commuter case. It provides great protection but it doesn't add significant bulk so the phone still slides easily in and out of your pocket. The Commuter comes with a plastic screen protector but I recommend forgoing that in favor of a nice tempered glass one. The Commuter does cover the nice brushed metal finish on the phone though so keep that it mind.

AFAIK the android 5.1 update for the M9 that is being released makes the camera a little bit better, a bit faster to open up the app and take a photo, and a lot more consistent in auto mode. If I remember correctly, there is still a bit of oversharpening, but that can be adjusted in the settings."

Many other people like the Spigen Neo Hybrid Case (if you're interested in the Neo Hybrid, I have an extra I can sell you at half price).   Nova Launcher Prime is probably the best launcher available to android. I really like the ClickUI icon pack.   Be sure you take all the updates you can before rooting (if you choose to do so), as rooting modifies your /system partition and you won't be able to take any more OTA updates without first flashing an RUU (which would require paying $25 for Sunshine to gain s-off).   I'd advise against converting your case to a Qi enabled case, as that would require always having a microUSB plugged in. So any time you actually wanted to wire up you'd have to remove the case."

That being said, for cases you can use the DotView case made by HTC. Pretty unique case and it's close to being naked. As for launchers, it comes stock with BlinkFeed, but I run Nova Launcher. I recommend you try many out, there's quite a few on the play store. You're in for a ride, Apple has nothing on Android when it comes to customization. As for CM, you'll have to unlock your boot loader before hand. HTC can run you thru the steps from their website, it's quite easy. CM is a pure AOSP Rom, so it's quite different from any Sense Rom. I assume you're new to Android, so just play with your phone a bit and get used to the basics before you start down the flashing path. It's addictive 😊"

I just like it because it doesn't feel bloated with stock software or custom features. Leaves it up to the user to decide what goes and what stays. Probably any major tweaks you want to add will be done via Xposed Framework."

Edit: make sure that you flash the stock firmware in the post first, then flash DHs GPE  Edit2: OP /u/TheSonicDoctor, here's the link for the RUU. I recommend going towards option 1. Even if you don't need it at the moment, I still recommend downloading it and leaving it in the root of your microSD, but rename it to 0P6BIMG.zip.bak or something, then when needed, rename it back to 0P6BIMG.zip. If you keep it in the .zip, whenever you attempt to load into your bootloader, it'll automatically start extracting it. Yes it's almost 2GB of your SD, but if you have a larger SD, if you're constantly flashing, or just want to have a safety net, I'd recommend just keeping it there in case you dun goofed and need to revert to stock but don't have access/cannot wait until you have access to a computer.

Not to mention, it seemed like they were racing. The more competent user is going to win this ""race"", it has nothing to do with the phone. The last statement too, the ""Samsung"" loads the apps each time while the ""HTC"" doesn't. What the hell are they talking about? It's just a pathetic test and horrible marketing.

I think the last statement is about them wanting consumers to be aware of the issue highlighted in this video. In it, the the S6 and Iphone 6 are initially very quick but the One then shows how optimized its ram management is. And even though all the people are clearly unaware of Android/HTC phones, which would mean these ads would have a hard time convincing me, an android enthusiast that is subscribed to a subreddit about it, they may affect the common consumer who are probably as (un)aware of HTC phones as the people in the video are.

htcone,3c4wck,ltdemon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"I have the android 5.0.2 version, htc sense 6.0, it's the HTC One M8S Gunmetal grey. When i go into camera and press the three dots, then switch the camera mode from normal into Fast HD it locks my recording resolution to 720p@60fps. I would could really use a fix to this because 1080p@60fps was one of the features that made me buy this phone in the first place."
htcone,3c4wck,ltdemon,2,Sun Jul 5 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"Well at the moment I have the Badboyz rom 5.0.1, sense 7 and the camera works like a charm. Try to play around in the settings (but I bet you already did that)"
htcone,3c4wck,ltdemon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:10:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i turned the options inside out looking for something. I just bought the phone, its brand new and i kinda want to keep it stock, dont want to change the rom or mod it in any way for now. It also says it has no updates to do for the android or the htc sense. I was thinking it could be the fact that i dont have a micro sd card, i only have the 16gb from the phone(6gb actually usable). Maybe it doesnt let me record 1080p60fps cause i dont have an sd card? It does record 1080p30fps for a maximum of 30 minutes with the phone memory empty"
htcone,3c4wck,ltdemon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:22:05 2015 UTC,Maybe. I`ve got the 32gb version. Try and get your hands on a 8 or 16gb sd card and check if that solves problem.

htcone,3c3l7g,geoox,7,Sat Jul 4 12:54:16 2015 UTC,"Not exactly GPE, but I use the latest CM12 nightly build and it's amazing! Battery life has been fantastic and it stays true to stock android while providing some extra features for more customization. Highly recommended cyanogenmod."
htcone,3c3l7g,Parkuman,4,Sat Jul 4 13:46:18 2015 UTC,I'm running skydragon. Works really well.
htcone,3c3l7g,fixinggenie,2,Sat Jul 4 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"+1   I've been using this ROM since I got the phone (last December). I'm S-ON, everything works smooth, no problems."
htcone,3c3l7g,OnionPow,2,Sat Jul 4 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"I recommend just S-Offing your phone, it makes flashing whatever you want much easier. Really opens up flashing on your M8 and let's you play around without fear of bricking. I thought $25 was a lot at first too but it's been worth it.   I've used a few GPE ROMs and found that the best for battery, stability and speed is actually just the stock RUU (specifically 5.1 LMY47O.H6, boring, I know haha) with stock firmware, kernel and ROM.  For whatever reason, being able to modify all the way down to the firmware has made the most difference.  Conversion thread on XDA"
htcone,3c3l7g,mrtoddles11,3,Sat Jul 4 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"I believe you have to be S-off to install any custom ROM. It does suck, but it's worth the $25 IMO. If you decide to go that route, I recommend the Digital High GPE ROM. It's been very clean and stable for me. I tried some of the nightlies for CM12.1 too, but I always had Bluetooth and GPS issues. Mayne those are fixed in the latest snapshot release though."
htcone,3c3l7g,DisregardWhatISay,3,Sat Jul 4 15:16:46 2015 UTC,You do not have to be s-off.  You just have to unlock the bootloader. And being rooted is something else highly recommended. I'm running the dirty unicorn rom version 9.4 but it's basically like any other AOSP ROM. Very Similar to cyanogenmod. This rom gets me about 8 hour screen on time  Edited battery life* to Screen on time*
htcone,3c3l7g,Dach0sen1,2,Sat Jul 4 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"So I was running DU for a long while but have recently changed to cm12 for the 5.0.x approach. Just out of curiosity what keeps you using the DU ROM after the dev explicitly said they weren't going to support the device anymore? Is it mainly the battery life you mentioned?  Also +1 to you not needing s-off to flash custom ROMs and only an unlocked bootloader. I, myself, am not s-off - although it would definitely help when it comes to troubleshooting some of my dumb mistakes. (flashing old xposed frameworks on my unsupporting device..)"
htcone,3c3l7g,icy_llama,3,Sun Jul 5 01:08:55 2015 UTC,"Haha It must have been picked up by a different dev because I'm running DU and it's based off android 5.1.1http://forum.xda-developers.com/htc-one-m8/orig-development/rom-dirty-unicorns-5-0-2-htc-one-m8-03-t3052466 but yes battery life is phenomenal. The lock screen can be a little laggy from time to time but that's the only issue I have with the phone. Like I said I'm on 9.4, so If you read the thread some of the issues are from 9.3."
htcone,3c3l7g,Dach0sen1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:20:42 2015 UTC,"Oh. My. God. You just made my night! This looks incredible! I always loved my DU One m8 but as I said I flashed to another as (I thought) it was unsupported.   A quick question though, when flashing this will I need to upgrade my firmware before doing so? I've had issues with other 5.x.x ROMs (wifi not working, bad signal) because of old firmware and being on the international version of this device (s-on) it's been hard to flash a working updated firmware.   P.S to anyone else on the International device having firmware issues, the CM12 snapshot required no firmware updates to have a fully working device on 5.x.x"
htcone,3c3l7g,icy_llama,2,Sun Jul 5 01:57:06 2015 UTC,"Haha Honestly I don't know, I was on t mobile 5.0.1 before I  unlocked and rooted. Idk if that thread or Google has any better answers"
htcone,3c3l7g,Dach0sen1,2,Sun Jul 5 02:16:44 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks anyway. I might even flash this updated DU ROM just because I liked my old 4.4.4 version so much. If it works It works but if not i'll just revert back I guess."
htcone,3c3l7g,icy_llama,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:28:23 2015 UTC,It kind of depends on what carrier you have. I have T-Mobile and I flashed Skydragon 5.1.1 GPE ROM with S-On
htcone,3c3l7g,trempulant,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:34:03 2015 UTC,Yep. I did this with a Rogers M8. S-On. No issues

htcone,3c4i2w,ncturnal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"No, you need to flash a stock ruu to be able to take the ota"
htcone,3c4i2w,leadCactus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:53:26 2015 UTC,But what if all you did was unlock the bootloader to gain root. I did not flash any other rom. I'm still on stock.
htcone,3c4i2w,BlackDave,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:05:26 2015 UTC,"Rooting modifies the /system partition. When doing an OTA, it checks if anything in /system has ever been modified. Usually this can be fixed easily by restoring a stock /system from a recovery backup, but right now TWRP for the M9 has a bug where you can't mount /system for a restore, so your only option is to run an RUU"

htcone,3c4i2w,entropism,0,Sat Jul 4 22:18:34 2015 UTC,Why?  Just use a custom rom or a rooted stock rom
htcone,3c4i2w,entropism,2,Sat Jul 4 22:43:02 2015 UTC,I'd still need to s-off it so I'd still need sunshine.
htcone,3c4i2w,leadCactus,0,Sat Jul 4 22:48:31 2015 UTC,Why would you need s-off to root and install a custom rom?  You only need s-off to change your CID. I was running venom rom without S-off just fine.
htcone,3c4i2w,Groumph09,5,Sat Jul 4 23:24:36 2015 UTC,Some ROMs require the latest firmware to work correctly. Firmware can only be taken via OTA or flashed when s-off.
htcone,3c3cq5,yoitsjustin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:46:51 2015 UTC,Did you flash the Dev Edition RUU?
htcone,3c3cq5,insanecellist,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:20:40 2015 UTC,Yep got it from this link: https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=95916177934551186  Beforehand I changed my CID and MID. Then I flashed this by putting it in my sd card and naming it 0PJAIMG (or whatever it was.) Then I flashed stock dev recovery and relocked my bootloader. Afterwards I tried to download and it doesn't apply the update because it gives me an error message along the lines of different variant or something.
htcone,3c3cq5,leadCactus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"You didn't need to flash the stock dev recovery. The RUU does that for you. Also, you didn't need to relock your bootloader. I don't think it's the problem, but I do know that dev edition phones come with their bootloader already unlocked.   I would unlock the bootloader again, flash the RUU again, and then (without doing anything else) boot up and (try) to take the OTA"
htcone,3c3cq5,leadCactus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"I did that now. Unlocked, flashed RUU, flashed dev stock recovery, and am now downloading the OTA."

htcone,3c189y,speeglevillean,6,Fri Jul 3 20:51:20 2015 UTC,I like it. It did get warm doing intensive tasks but I got a case and now don't notice it. Battery life is great after updates. Especially since I got on 5.1. I just wish the ROM I'm using supported AT&T's visual voicemail.   I was thinking about getting the S6/S6 Edge but they didn't support micro SD which was a deal breaker. It would of been nice if the M9 had a replaceable battery though. I'm really not sure what I'm going to do if/when my battery dies. I'm not into buying a new phone every 1-2 years like some people are.
htcone,3c189y,krp5150,4,Fri Jul 3 21:37:47 2015 UTC,I'm not into buying a new phone every year either. Another thing that factored into my decision to go with the M9 is the fact that the thing is built like a tank. There seems to still be a lot of M7 and M8 users out there which would suggest that HTC builds their phones to last. That's a huge plus for me.
htcone,3c189y,wamowamo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"I believe HTC will fix it the first time with the ""uh-oh"" deal."

htcone,3c189y,koolaidistheshit,2,Sat Jul 4 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you like it. I really like mine. The interface is very smooth, the screen is pretty good (could be better once I get the screen calibration tool in the 5.1 update), the speakers are amazing and the battery gets through the day (though that's rumored to be better too in the new update). Also, I love how customizable the theming engine is.   Only weak point is the camera, really. It doesn't have OIS so you have to be a little too careful with moving objects, but pictures usually come out pretty well regardless. And yes, the phone does get a little warm, but after the day 1 update I received, it's never gotten too hot to hold. I also like that the heat seems to dissipate more towards the edges than towards the back. With the curved back, it makes things more comfortable during the rare times that I put the phone under heavy load.   Watch out for /u/generalako who is no doubt typing up his anti-M9 thesis as we speak."

Trust me, I've  had no issues with my phone yet. So don't worry. You never know a phone until you actually use it.  3) If on a budget, Get an M8. You convert it to GPE and its ~$300 right now."
htcone,3bu3u4,matbcyka,4,Thu Jul 2 04:19:56 2015 UTC,Agree.  I went M8 because they are cheap and my give a fuck scale is tipped more toward the speakers than the camera.  GPE is fucking fantastic.  So clean.
htcone,3bu3u4,bilobaman,3,Thu Jul 2 08:48:44 2015 UTC,I totally agree on getting a M8 and converting it to GPE. Mine is so fast now and the battery life is ridiculous compared to sense. Plus they're super cheap.  I don't know about the S6 or G4 though. Those phones are getting a little old to be paying full price for them.

htcone,3bu3u4,StallisPalace,5,Thu Jul 2 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"The biggest negative on any M9 review is the camera.  It's a lot better after the update (just came out yesterday for Sprint, other US carriers coming soon).  It is still not as good as the G4 or S6, but it is now capable of taking good pictures without having to mess around with the settings constantly.  The overheating some reviewers mentioned was fixed with an almost immediate update after release.  My phone has never gotten substantially warmer than my M8 did.  Most of the other stuff I see reviewers harping on is personal preference.  A lot of them complained about the side buttons for example, but I have no issue.  I suspect they are used to button placement on the Samsung and Apple phones and that is why they had such a hard time.  It would be a tough call between the G4 and M9 if I were buying a phone today.  I did try the S6 Edge and it was an excellent device, but mine was also defective out of the box.  That's 2 for 2 Samsung phones I've had that were defective so I replaced it with an M9 instead.  Also, from my personal experience anyway, Samsung customer support is terrible compared to HTC.  Compared to the M7, the M9 has a better camera, better speakers, better screen, and better performance.  It is a big upgrade from the M7, although not so much from the M8."
htcone,3bu3u4,tsumeone,3,Thu Jul 2 06:34:27 2015 UTC,"The M8 should be pretty affordable as of now. This would keep the things you liked/loved about the M7 while not suffering from the chipset like the M9 does.  Since it's still in active software support, you also get 5.1."

It disappeared back in October 2014, lost amidst all my stuff.  Anyway, I'd just tried the new G4 and returned it because it didn't feel good in my hands and didn't flow right. Fortunately, I found my M7 a week ago, and damn if it doesn't still look new in its case and tempered glass. The only downside I'd say is when I took photos of an approaching storm, the M7's photos really looked awful compared to my Galaxy Note 2's pics. Still, it does feel good to have the One back in my hands again. If I can get 5.1 GPE running on it, I may finally use it as my daily driver."

If it's still usable, flash a decent custom rom and the externalX kernel to give you better battery performance and tap to wake features etc.  Then wait for the new Nexus or the OnePlus2 and hope one of them are better than the crop of meh that's available right now."
htcone,3bu3u4,uberneoconcert,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"I've been dealing with this exact conflict. My m7 is 2 years old now and my battery life has diminished a little, especially once I get around 20% and less. I've recently encountered an issue where my speaker phone mic is now broken I'm sire and my primary mic is intermittent with me sounding very far away. All while my wife's N4 is just taking a dump on a daily basis so I tell her just go buy a new one. I tell her to pick from the current flagship line up, and she decided on the G4. The phone is really, really nice. The camera is outstanding, along with its QHD screen it looks fantastic. I told myself prior that I will be getting the m9 after the m7, just because I've loved this phone and previous G2 and the G1. I've been in a serious conflict between sticking to what a love and going with the m9 despite some of the reviews, which I take with a gain of salt. Or go and get the G4 to switch it up. I like that the G4 has a removable back so you can swap batteries once it starts to fail, thus extending the phones lifetime, and the camera.. man it was incredibly good.   Then today, I read that HTC will be announcing their new flagship, HTC Areo this October. This alone solidified my decision to bring my m7 to semi proper functionality with the primary mic and wait it out. I was able to get the primary working for now, but unfortunately I think my secondary is totally gone. The only obstacle I have now is my battery which I think I'll try to replace myself.   All in all, I think if you're truly willing to veer away from HTC, the G4 is really nice, the only lacking aspect is it's speaker which is actually much louder then my m7's."

So far my experience with the data is that it has been more stable.  I took a drive on a route where I usually drop to 3G at least once (and in the process drop all my connections), and it did not do so after the update on the way there and back.  Streamed music the whole way without issue.  I notice at my house instead of constantly flipping between LTE and 3G, it stays on 3G now."

The HTC Transfer Tool works quite well especially with photos and music, it won't delete anything from your M7 so give it a go and see if you're missing anything.

Just make sure to grab the backups off the M7 first.
