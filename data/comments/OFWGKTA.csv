OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,SheZowRaisedByWolves,3,Fri Jul 17 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Show in Houston? I was there too, it was definately crazy. Don't be surprised about people smoking inside either, at Warehouse Live all you have to do to get your lighters inside is stick it in your shoe and you'll be fine. The securty there is always chill too. Only time I've seen any of them do anything is when someone jumped on stage during a set a few months ago. I was surprised at how long the line was too, me and my buddies thought if we came an hour before the doors opened we'd be good but when we got there we were back over by the stadium too. Definately a crazy show though and BSD was great as the first song.  ""By the way, we do punch bitches."""
OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,j0shp0int0h,2,Fri Jul 17 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"I was there too dude! I felt like the show seemed kind of short for what it was, and I don't remember if they started late or not but I feel like they did."
OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,LeonardMcWhoopass,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah it started late for sure. Taco didn't start his set until 9:45, Tyler came out around 10 and I was outside by 11:15. don't know how long his usual set is but that's pretty short for most concerts.  He didn't play Cherry Bomb either and I was kinda butt hurt about that too."
OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,j0shp0int0h,2,Sat Jul 18 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"Hooo Lee Shit, I was there too, and I was even more excited because he doesn't come to houston really often!! And that was my first time seeing them live as well. Although, there was this prissy ass chick in front of me pissing me off and telling me, ""Ewww, get off of me!"" while I was getting pushed into her. I didn't know if she knew that she was at an ODD FUTURE concert, but she should have known not to come in a dress and a ""cute"" hairdo. Nevertheless, I had a bomb ass time!! Now I can't wait for Earl and Mac Demarco to come!"
OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,MrMcMisdemeanor,2,Sun Jul 19 07:22:30 2015 UTC,"I had a slightly different first experience seeing someone from OF for the first time. I've been a fan of them for a little over 2 years now, so was pretty stoked to be seeing Earl last month. Wasn't quite sure what to expect, as his latest album is pretty mellow/dark, so I sorta expected a chill out gig to some extent.   I have a friend who said he'd seen Tyler perform with Earl and others a few years ago, and he said it was so incredibly bassy you could hardly even hear the songs or the rapping. I thought Earl might have changed that seeing as though it was his solo gig, but unfortunately he hadn't at all. I could only hear which song it was because of the first few bars introduction, and I actually ended up leaving a few songs before the end because it was so disappointing, something I didn't think I'd ever do.   I was curious whether anyone else had had a similar experience with seeing OF? Maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind for the gig. Despite that, it was still cool seeing Earl, and RATKING kicked ass before Earl's set, so it was worth seeing them.   Glad you had a good time seeing Tyler though OP, it sounds ace."
OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,ollismith,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"I also seen Earl last month. Maybe 100 or so of us in a tiny venue. Was for the most part exactly what you thought it'd be like. Really chilled out.   Only real issues I had was with a couple easter baskets in the crowd - think they were expecting it to be more like the old OF stuff. A few people were shoving during Grief. Some girl went up on stage during Quest/Power. Never had any of the issues you did, though."
OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,robbiemck,4,Fri Jul 17 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I guess it depends on the crowd/venue. At the gig I was at everyone seemed to be jumping/shoving in most songs, when I feel it could've been toned down for the more mellow stuff. Probably wouldn't pass up an opportunity to see Earl/any OF members though, was still a good experience for sure!"
OFWGKTA,3dmwa0,ollismith,0,Fri Jul 17 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"""Easter baskets"" come up with your own shit, and dont just quote earl's tweets."

I listened to it as if he was mocking it, which is no doubt what he was TRYING to do. Aside from the copied flow and bars... The lyrical content is pretty good. But before you judge Bolic off this track... Listen to his album stuff. He's pretty raw."

OFWGKTA,3cbfnp,OnlyKronix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:18:30 2015 UTC,It was hella awesome. I was like right up at the front and in the pit and shit haha. Wbu?
OFWGKTA,3cbfnp,OnlyKronix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:12:00 2015 UTC,"Me and three others queued for like four hours, but we ended up right up at the front against the barricade so it was totally worth it!"

OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,HowlingPantherWolf,19,Sun Jul 5 22:39:27 2015 UTC,Dontcha by The Internet.
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,antograb,26,Sun Jul 5 22:43:01 2015 UTC,Little known track called Drop by Earl. Really upbeat tempo and this is when Earl was younger so a lot more energy than anything from IDLSIDGO  Edit: Drop has almost a million views on YT it is apparently a lot more well known than I thought.
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,AZNman1111,5,Mon Jul 6 00:11:54 2015 UTC,The whole album that was from would be amazing. That was the first OF album I listened to and still my favorite by far.
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,FlarpyChemical,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:18:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if songs like Leather Head and Oblivion would be very good ""radio/party"" songs"
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,dusty_condom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:00:31 2015 UTC,Whoops. I forgot the question and got caught in the hype of talking about my favorite album. They could maybe work but I agree. Cheese Burger might not work either.
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,FlarpyChemical,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:16:19 2015 UTC,Gonna be honest the only songs I've listened to on that album are Drop and Orange Juice. What would you recommend off of it?
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,AZNman1111,4,Mon Jul 6 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"Orange juice was amazing. If you are into Tyler's darker stuff, splatter is for you no doubt. When I was a lot younger I was really obsessed with 'Swag me Out' my favorite off that album would probably be Blade by Earl Sweatshirt. My second favorite has to be Round and Round by hodgy, Mike g, and jasper. I would recommend blade and round and round most. :)"
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,FlarpyChemical,2,Mon Jul 6 03:53:35 2015 UTC,Darker as in stuff like Window? Yeah I actually prefer it to stuff like VCR. So I'll give them all a shot! Thanks!
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,AZNman1111,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:07:17 2015 UTC,I didn't enjoy window much. I was thinking tron cat when I typed that but yes! enjoy! VCR and french were amazing.
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,FlarpyChemical,2,Mon Jul 6 13:10:11 2015 UTC,"Probably Splatter, Blade, and Up. Honestly, just find some time to listen to the whole thing"
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,InanimateBellPepper,2,Mon Jul 6 03:49:42 2015 UTC,I'm big fan of sitting down and doing literally nothing else while listening to an album start to finish. I could give Radicals a shot sometime.
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,AZNman1111,12,Mon Jul 6 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"Oldie, Forest Green, DAM, Jamba"

OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,Koiq,2,Wed Jul 8 10:52:09 2015 UTC,Trashwang so people can go mad to the Spielman vocals

OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,flavorfaveeeeeee,7,Mon Jul 6 02:46:33 2015 UTC,Kinda heavy handed for the general public but goddammit if that isn't one of my favorite songs by OFWGKTA
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,AZNman1111,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:08:40 2015 UTC,Oh I completely agree I just love seeing random people's reactions to it. I think it is my favorite song by them. It's so vulgar yet so technical and they combine the two so well that reminded me of early Em. That was the song that made me fall in love with OF.
OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,flavorfaveeeeeee,3,Mon Jul 6 04:41:31 2015 UTC,Hahaha yeah if you want good reactions Earl (the song) is hilarious to watch.   Reincarnation of 98 eminem!

OFWGKTA,3c8m4j,bubbythewhale,4,Sun Jul 5 22:43:20 2015 UTC,"Earl has a good grimy beat and since it's old Earl he goes hard on it. Good at house parties I think, not sure about other settings though"
