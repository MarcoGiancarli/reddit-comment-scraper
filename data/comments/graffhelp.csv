graffhelp,3e3hk7,krauzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I see with this as of right now, is that it has such little flow, that it looks like it's an inconvenience to even write.

At the least you could try letting them smoosh together more, for instance having the right wing of the 't' protrude over the 'a'. The 'a' and 'k' definitely need a lot of work... the hook on the 'a' doesnt look good pointed, should be rounded out, and also extend the body of it back so the tail and neck aren't taking up all of it. The 'k' looks a lot like an 'h', its a hard letter to bubble anyways, but play with it some more. The 'e' is probably your strong point and honestly the face is a bit played out so I dont know mang. I would recommend making everything taller too, but thats personal preference."

graffhelp,3dityv,krauzz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:06:02 2015 UTC,Only bad habit I see here is you trying to push your ignorance onto someone else.  Graff is all about tight kerning and use of space. Often when you paint on a wall or freight there isn't enough room for your name to fit without squishing letters together. This is literally where style comes from. Any one who actually knows anything about graff can tell this is intended to be a freight piece.
graffhelp,3dityv,Christ_1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:35 2015 UTC,"Look up the definition of ignorant I don't think you understand what it means, I was being open minded and critical the whole time.  Infact I agree with what you have to say about style coming from the tight kerning of space. But that still provides no excuse for him cutting off the bottom of the letter, How is that stylish at all? If you were working on a freight and truly had no room then it'd be understandable but this is practice on paper so it makes absolutely no sense to sacrifice the style unless you're going to draw in a freight train back ground to accompany it? Anybody who knows anything about graff will tell you its all about painting and respect. Nothing more, nothing less. Stop trying to throw definitions on somethin that's supposed to be free.

graffhelp,3djruc,KayJayBee,2,Thu Jul 16 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"That's a T. The one in your original post has the top whipped around a lot more, leading it to look a lil like the dot of an I. My crits for that would be to try and get the vertical bar of the T the same(ish) height as the rest of the letters, it looks a little small compared to the rest."

graffhelp,3dj7i0,kory_dc,2,Thu Jul 16 18:30:01 2015 UTC,"You've definitely got some skill. Now you just need to hone it. Common things I see from this are;  1.Work on your 3D. Look at other's pieces and see how they do it (all going in the same direction or to a fading point).  2.In terms of letter shape, everything looks more or less the same and vanilla. Step out of your comfort some and try other things. Try to make your letters more in the graffiti style, ie. Using bars with varying weights and curves.  3.Don't go too crazy with your cracks and what not. They definitely look cool but it can take away from the focus of the piece, which should be letter shape. In graffiti they say less is more.  Also, that clown character is really cool, I hope it's not bitten. And the woodsy fill is awesome, however you could have outlined if with white for more contrast to show your letters. Other than that great job and keep working at it. I'd also like to see a solid tag from you."

graffhelp,3djl7o,Dubkipz666,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"I dont really see a problem with the D, youre right about the A being too far away. What you could try to do is make the top end of the D overflow a bit toward the A, to fill up the empty space.   Shadows are a bit of a pain if you dont know what youre doing. Try to imagine a copy of your letters in black floating slightly behind the letters. A good way to try this is by opening an image editor (paint, iunno) draw a letter, copy it with a different color and move it on top of the other letter to see how it looks."

graffhelp,3d9v4l,Hello_Im_Tiny_T,3,Tue Jul 14 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"there's not a lot of flow to the letters no real shared traits between the letters   your m has a huge block-y extension/serif while the other one is round  you have two distinctively different capital A's  There doesn't appear to be an reason why some bars are thinner than others. Imagine taking a chiseled point marker and holding it in place when you draw your letters. depending on the initial placement some parts of the letter will be thicker or thinner than others. Whats important is that this remains consistent    there is no established baseline for your letters (look how low the base of your E is compared to how high the base of your N is)  You took up all the negative space with 3-d. it spaces out your piece a lot and your 3-d takes up more space than your letters. I like to keep things basic with 3-d or drop shadows. I'll either have the bars straight down or directly to the right or left. Its a lot easier to stay consistent. If you choose an angle in between its a lot easier to just establish a vanishing point and draw lines to the point. It looks like you just eye balled it because the lines vary a bit.  I'll add: The plain white letters are almost boring, it looks unfinished. this isn't a throw up or something. you took the time sketch out something, added a background and 3-d. you dropped the ball on the most important part,  the letters! you can add highlights, low lights, blend colors. so much more could be done to add depth"

graffhelp,3d8bhq,SociAlexm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:07:55 2015 UTC,"A pet peeve of mine is when letters are butted up right against eachother. The back of the E is blocking  the 3-d of the U. also your E is getting into your R's personal space.  I dont think anyone can say ""oh do this to your M"" or your R, unless something is fundamentally flawed in the letter structure (there isn't really.... maybe some preference issues).  What I can suggest is working lightly in pencil and getting a black marker or a dark colored marker and going over your pencil. Keep at it, do a couple of these a day and you'll find yourself making small tweaks here and there. If you like the general idea of this drawing, don't give up on it keep trying more... each time it will look better."

graffhelp,3d67ag,Strobetrode,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:02:32 2015 UTC,I like it. Its very simple and I like the colors...A couple things though...The I is lacking some major attention. While the rest of the letters are more blocky the I contains a lor of round shapes and additions which make it looks really weird to me..not to mention the size of the I. Also on the D there are some weird kind of squiggly bits that make the D look very weird to me. Other than that I like the colors and the 3D is very nice. Maybe work on bar width consistency in making them more smooth and more consistent as in the round part on your W. Keep it up man!  EDIT: basically the whole width of the D is off because all the rest of your letters are basically straight letters...So your D shouldn't have such that wide width it needs to match the others!

graffhelp,3d4i7q,KayJayBee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:24:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the helpful crits...
graffhelp,3d4i7q,KayJayBee,2,Mon Jul 13 19:33:30 2015 UTC,youre right i just woke up and have been butt hurt about local buff aquad targeting me. Your line thickness and cuts are the problem. Try to keep the bars a more even or naturally bending. And by cuts I mean gaps in the letters. the bottom of the R should be cutting threw the outter leg better. The way you have it now is a B.
graffhelp,3d4i7q,REDDITFTW98,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"So I can tell that you're using bars (which is awesome), but don't do them with markers. Bars should be sketched with a pencil and then worked and twisted for a while. Once you have a solid looking letter you can erase what you don't need and then go over the outline in pen. Spend a long time working your bars before you settle on a design, the goal is to have letters that could stand on their own."

graffhelp,3d4ad0,FUBAR-DEVINE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"Loop of the K in the first one feels pretty unnatural to me, it think if you want a loop back, do a full circle loop instead of the hard corner, because it just feels like you're trying to put it there. (Subjective) I don't find the cracks really fit in this one. Also what's up with the bubble between the bottom of the E and the R?  The 2nd one is just really forced arrows to me. They're in places that kinda make sense, but they just aren't executed right. I find the style of the letters has a part to do with this. Some parts of the letter seems nice and aggressive but others seem more laid back, if that makes sense. Also the P is hella tiny. I find with pieces like this, the letters should generally make sense before adding the arrows. I'm also a little lost on whats going on for the spine of the R?"

I am new to this Reddit but I have been reading through it and there are some really cool people here so I decided to ask for some help.   Without giving out all my info about myself I live in a fairly small town, where Only me and one other person writes. I don't get much influence other than the internet so learning styles and getting ideas is very hard for me. I have been writing off and on for about 2 years now but very very low key because of where I live.(Get caught very easily, everyone knows each other and I used to do spray paint art for school activities so they know about me) I recently got into a sort of fight with a friend of mine and he might be a snitch so I decided to burn all of my old work with my old name that I had laying around (kept some hidden) and Now i'm changing names and staying low key for a while. I would like some tips and crit's on what you guys think.  Need help with some ideas on the N and S and also R.  Making it all flow and look nice together is hard because of the amount of round letters and then the square af N!  Thanks guys, and get used to seeing me around ;)"

graffhelp,3d3zwx,Pocmin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:22 2015 UTC,I like it because the N flows with the other round letters. maybe if i make the flat part of it shorter it would look better.
graffhelp,3d3zwx,Pocmin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:48:13 2015 UTC,yes I think that would help and maybe see if you can make the top arch of the S just a tad bit higher so it matches the height of the n's curve
graffhelp,3d3zwx,KayJayBee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:14:50 2015 UTC,Ill try it man. Does that N with the curve look like a H too much? I kind of like messing with it if I could match my S with it right.

There's more questions to ask, but we'll start with that.  Though I will offer some of my crits ahead of time.  I don't think the O should touch the M at all, other than where it crosses the M's leg. The serifs on the M are way too big. I think the M is too wide for the O. As it is right now, it's pretty empty, there isn't much to it. There's a few ways to fix that, but that all depends on how you want it to look."

graffhelp,3cmegr,ekvivokk,3,Thu Jul 9 01:11:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, sorry but since nearly the beginning of graffiti, a Toy is what you call a beginner. Thats just how it is. If you feel that something as basic as being refereed to as a toy is insulting, then you probably don't have a thick enough skin to survive in this game."
graffhelp,3cmegr,BizarTheStar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"I don't really care if I'm called toy or not, it's not that. It's more in the sense of driving people away from the graffiti scene, that if you haven't noticed is degrading."
graffhelp,3cmegr,BizarTheStar,2,Thu Jul 9 05:11:50 2015 UTC,"My statement is basically for anyone in general, if being called a toy drove you away from this, then you weren't cut out for this in the first place. As for  the state of the graffiti scene in general, that's up for debate, but it defiantly isn't the word ""toy"" that's killing it."
graffhelp,3cmegr,BizarTheStar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:24:31 2015 UTC,"Well beginners might view being called toy hostile, which drives them away. The reddit graff community isn't that bad regarding this, but a lot of other forums are toxic."
graffhelp,3cmegr,freezyyfree,3,Thu Jul 9 05:27:21 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from, but graffiti IS hostile. It is a culture based around destroying property, If you are a bomber then its you against the world when you paint, because anyone that you come across while painting is someone that is potentially ready to put you in prison, in the hospital, or in a morgue. This is were the basis of the Don't-Give-a-Shit attitude need to come in. If  being called a toy is what you find alienating, and that what keeps you away from participating, then that's by design because you already failed the barrier to entry."
graffhelp,3cmegr,freezyyfree,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:36:30 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, atleast in Norway, the graff community is pretty including, unless you're dissing someone's piece they're probably not gonna hurt you. Police is always a problem, but that's not something anyone can change, and you have to watch out for people, but it's not life or death."
graffhelp,3cmegr,freezyyfree,2,Thu Jul 9 05:46:01 2015 UTC,If you're bitch made graff isn't for you. If you're toy then you're toy. That's it.

graffhelp,3cmegr,krauzz,3,Thu Jul 9 01:24:50 2015 UTC,I guess I was tryin to say that even if you're a beginner you're a toy. Saying you're a beginner is just fluffing the word toy. You just gotta ball up and take it until you learn the game and master your graff. That's how it's always been.
graffhelp,3cmegr,KayJayBee,2,Thu Jul 9 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"Say that then, it's kinda the discussion I want to start.   What do you think makes someone a toy?"
graffhelp,3cmegr,KayJayBee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:55:03 2015 UTC,"I think you're a toy until your graff is really strong. You're a toy if you don't understand the rules to graff or if you don't know the history. You're a toy if you rock crowns or halos with only 5months practice put in. You're a toy if you go over anything better than yours. You're a toy if you only hit chill spots. Most importantly though if you arnt recognized and respected in the graff game you're still toy. Toy isn't a bad thing, I still consider myself toy honestly. But that's what drives me to go all city and up my graff game."
graffhelp,3cmegr,Juno-P,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:28:59 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with the part about ""chill spots"". I think it's the best possible way to get better and practice without having to worry about police/people. I know that there is a "" outlaw "" aspect to the graff game, but toys should take every chance to practice their stuff on spots where stress and risk are practically non-existent."

graffhelp,3chaeh,ekvivokk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"Get a canvas or another surface to practice on in your backyard, or another chill spot until pulling outlines becomes your second nature. Don't focus much on fillins, first outlines and throwup style scribble fillins will do. It's really stupid to waste a lot of money on cans for fillins if you're an absolute beginner.  Keep your letters on paper simple enough to transfer them easily on to a wall. Or just develop your letters on the surface you practice on.  If you come out with already decent stuff and have practice, and respect other peoples stuff, you'll be respected and get connected quickly with other writers. Otherwise, if you come out as a toy, it can happen that you'll never lose this kind of branding, or maybe even get beaten up."

You have to wear dark clothes but not black, Dust Masks are optional but make sure you dump it not in your bin, Use gloves and make sure you're in an area where no-one can see you. I'd recomend using stencils a few times just to get used to the ""heat"". Be Quiet and if possible use Can Silencers you ca get these from graff-city.com (i don't know if thats the link). Just Be Quiet, Shake you cans SO FRICKING hard before you leave and be ready to dump your paint if you get caught oh and if you have one bring a Bike, Scooter or Carfor a getaway.

graffhelp,3c5vm7,enochism,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"A and P are definitely the best letters, I'd say just really pay attention to your bar thickness. The arrow on the L is kinda confusing cause it could be mistaken for an actual part of the letter and not just an addition. For your handstyle your P is really solid and your E is close, but the A and L need some love (especially because they're your beginning and ending letters)."
graffhelp,3c6dr9,1halloweenguy,2,Sun Jul 5 07:01:15 2015 UTC,"Safe doesn't seem to have much structure. Same with immortal. Nitro uses bars correctly but the shape of the letters are so screwed(Particularly the I and R). My advice is you simple it down even more until you become a master of structure. That doesn't mean no extra stuff like connections, arrows, or whatever the hell you want to add. Just make your letters have structure. If you fixed the Gs, I dig the Gang piece."

graffhelp,3bl69m,spud-boy,3,Tue Jun 30 02:58:11 2015 UTC,"A tag is like a brand name/logo, you have to have something valuable behind it. This value, the ""products"" are your proper pieces, may they be refined legal works or hardcore illegal stuff. If there is this value, it almost doesn't matter how your tag looks like or what it is (obviously the looks will evolve over time), because people will associate it (both the style and the letters as letters) with your works, even if they see your tag somewhere all by itself. However if there isn't, it's very unlikely that you'll produce so dope tags that they would be valuable by themselves, and even then it's basically pointless.  Think of it like this: you see all the Coca Cola ads everywhere, you recognize the logo. And when you see them, you think of the drink they produce, that is supposed to be the value. If there were ads and logos without any product, it would make no sense.  (Also, if you just tag around your city with shitty - or even not shitty - tags everyone will hate you, trust me, you don't want that kind of ""fame"".)  Moreover, no matter what name you choose because it'll grow on you, after years it'll become one with you.  And quite possibly you'll ""grow out"" some tags as you progress, because a few times you'll want to close a part of your previous ""toy"" period, and start with a clean slate. Then if you don't give up and put all the energy and money and enthusiasm into graff for years, one day you will have a name that'll stick to you forever because people will widely respect you and know you (not necessarily personally) by it.  Graffiti is a wild ride, good luck :-D"

Not tryna put ya down man, you are just going wayyyyyyy ahead of yourself. It takes years on years of practice before you can even begin thinking about wildstyle. Stay up"
graffhelp,3b9g1a,freezyyfree,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"Define Basic letters please, and (IMO) the structure is fine, what would you change to it?"
graffhelp,3b9g1a,liquisedx,4,Sat Jun 27 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"What structure?  There is no structure. No steady bar with, bars going anywhere, nonsense amount of arrows going nowhere, bars overlaying and cringing. Like he said, look in the side bar, there are basic tutorials. What you drew is what anyone drew at their 1 time trying graffiti with about 12 years. Its a mess."
graffhelp,3b9g1a,Loctorak,4,Sat Jun 27 14:00:46 2015 UTC,"For starters look at the letters. The bars are shaky because the lines that define them are wobbly - like you've done this slowly but were also shaking a bit (like me lol). Try get those lines perfect. They can never be clean enough and it makes the difference between a weak sketch and a solid one (among other things).  Second - kill the arrows. Structurally they don't stand on their own and they don't add much to the piece, essentially throwing it off balance to the right. You balanced it with that polar bear thing, but it doesn't all really fit together.   Third - start with simples and make sure the underlying letters are all solid and would look good on their own. Once you achieve that, you can start sketching little details and fancy things but if you add those in at the same time as your letters they will suffer for it. Take your E, for example. It's not so much an E as a block and two pointless arrows arranged in the shape of one. There needs to be a letter structure first and then other stuff second. That's what they mean by ""lacks structure""."

graffhelp,3b7qs1,Dubkipz666,5,Fri Jun 26 17:25:23 2015 UTC,Exactly what you should be aiming for. Just needs some obvious work like cleaner lines (they're really squiggly) and work on the leg of the r. Straighten up those lines by working on moving the rest of your body with your can. (aka try not to move your arm and hand so much)
graffhelp,3b7qs1,ItsJarrit,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"alright cheers man, I'll give that a try. I have the same kinda problem sketching too"
graffhelp,3b7qs1,ItsJarrit,2,Fri Jun 26 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"In my opinion sketching is almost harder than painting. Firstly, because the motions are smaller and easier to mess up. Secondly because you have to create the concept. That being said, sketching is entirely necessary to become a great writer and shouldn't be overlooked. The best writers are even better at sketches."
graffhelp,3b7qs1,jibsand,2,Fri Jun 26 21:25:27 2015 UTC,Pretty good for a beginner
graffhelp,3b67cf,CaserAowImsc,3,Fri Jun 26 08:19:25 2015 UTC,You're kinda burning out the oneflows. You should try a complicator or something.
graffhelp,3b67cf,jibsand,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:22:15 2015 UTC,What do you mean burning out?? And whats a complicator??
graffhelp,3b67cf,jibsand,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:53:35 2015 UTC,"Like not even that you're doing them too much. Just like, you know, take a break homie.  A complicator is a pointlessly complex tag where letters often start and end with the same entry stroke. Think of each letter as a oneliner."
graffhelp,3b67cf,krauzz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:38:01 2015 UTC,"Going to need pics of complicators. And i dont really do the oneliners that much, and to be honest with you i dont do gabdstyles that much either."
graffhelp,3b67cf,krauzz,2,Sun Jun 28 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"The loop in that flourish is super awkward, I'd say just stick to the normal version of it.  But I don't really see what you've changed, maybe my memory is just bad. It's just the top of the 's' that's different, right? And the 'c' is flatter? It looks fine, it's just really bottom heavy."
graffhelp,3b67cf,Dubkipz666,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Check my posts to see the difference. I agree with you on the loop.

graffhelp,3b98ah,lostfingers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:30:39 2015 UTC,You wrote it in script. Let's take a step back and try to write it in all caps before you get fancy.
graffhelp,3b98ah,NinjaSupplyCompany,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"This guy is right ^ it's looking more like cursive, which is ok. Surly attribute those aspects into your graff but maybe cut that out for now. Do straight letters like off a keyboard, push em close! Keep uniformity. The difference is you wanna work towards a oneliner flow and less like a cursive flow."

I basically just mimiced the movements from graff videos, so my flow was pretty good, but I didn't bring the seperate caps I bought a long time ago, so I couldn't get thin lines with the basic caps that came on the cans, which was a little dissapointing :P  Other than the tens of tourists that wanted to take a picture and made me anxious as hell it was a pretty dope experience"

After you get your structure nailed down, you will be able to create your own style by adding bits and kinks, tilting letters, changing the width of bars. If you try to add style without structure it will look toy I promise."
graffhelp,3b4j2y,TheRealFlyingFuck,3,Thu Jun 25 22:20:23 2015 UTC,"Try to minimize the negative space. The A P don't really work for me, I think the leg bar on the A is too fat, and the P seems too skinny to really feel like it fits in wit the fat bold letters it's beside.  Also you should probably go a bit smaller with the tags on the side, it looks kinda bad. And tiny pet peeve, why did you do a legible tag beside a legible straight of the same name? Seems redundant.  Any way, pretty good work man."

graffhelp,3axacs,IWantAFuckingUsename,2,Wed Jun 24 06:51:21 2015 UTC,"Being older isn't going to help it, I seen a guy on this asking stuff for his 8 Year Old Daughter. I fail to see the point in being older then start doing it again. I think that you mean keep on trying for a while when you say give it a few years so i'll give you that."
graffhelp,3axacs,IWantAFuckingUsename,2,Wed Jun 24 06:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but she isn't out bombing in the street. This is a dad wanting to do art with his daughter in a legal space. I just think that you probably shouldn't be out doing stuff on the streets until you're a couple years older."

graffhelp,3axacs,ASKONER,3,Wed Jun 24 07:06:57 2015 UTC,Ah alright homie. Just cos you were talking about using a dust mask makes me think you were painting out in the world.
graffhelp,3axacs,jibsand,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:12:03 2015 UTC,Haha
graffhelp,3axacs,chromejunx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:21:49 2015 UTC,"I started writing when I was ten lol started painting at like 11,  with my shitty spray paint I made my parents buy me and the marker I ordered online. Good old days of going out at 7pm while keeping watch for my friend while he went behind a dumpster"
graffhelp,3axacs,chromejunx,3,Fri Jul 3 08:32:51 2015 UTC,Just catch outlines until you're really good. Most of them just get buffed anyways  I prefer a black fill with a fluorescent outline myself
graffhelp,3axacs,krauzz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:55:08 2015 UTC,Wait… are you really 12 y/o?

graffhelp,3aur15,PillowFist,2,Tue Jun 23 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"The question mark reminds me of, ""I'm Ron Burgundy?"" I don't know, take that as you will 😁"
graffhelp,3aur15,Chi84,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:12:39 2015 UTC,Idk i kinda like the arrow
graffhelp,3aur15,Yofoo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:23:48 2015 UTC,I feel like its missing personality. I assume thats why you added the arrow and question mark? I don't think they are helping...

graffhelp,3avdmq,chairleg1,9,Tue Jun 23 20:26:07 2015 UTC,"Bars, bars, bars. Check out the sidebar and read all the things about stuff."
graffhelp,3avdmq,IWantAFuckingUsename,3,Tue Jun 23 20:42:55 2015 UTC,"Read the sidebar, Learn your bars, Google up some throwie fonts and Study while posting on here."
graffhelp,3avdmq,enochism,4,Tue Jun 23 22:35:56 2015 UTC,"Ok i'm going to welcome you to something we call ""Constructive"" Critisism Here on /r/GraffHelp. This is Shit dude, I don't want you immediatly backing out now but go read the tutorials on the sidebar an shit. You didn't just ruin it on the second image you ruined it when you put that whacky ass ancher through it and the onion shaped thing at the back. Research your Shit, Study the Bars, Study Your Fonts. Be aware people can be alot meaner to you on this i've seen people literary screaming at people in comments about bars 'n shit. Get ready to enter a whole new world of insults. The Graffti Community will chew you up and spit you out while stomping on you with platform boots. Deal With It"
graffhelp,3avdmq,enochism,2,Tue Jun 23 22:41:01 2015 UTC,TL;DR Fuck you I'm nice!
graffhelp,3avdmq,Polarpanser716,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"This shows that no matter if you're 12 or 20 (or 30) when you start out, the product always looks the same. I honestly don't think there could be any constructive criticism on this because you need to exercise so much more before something even starts to shape out. (This is true for 90% of the sub) Note that as I just wrote it, it's not your fault. This thing is much harder than it looks like and you will have to put years into it to produce something acceptable.   That is if your goal is to actually make dope graffs.   If it is, don't settle for being better than your friends or someone in your town, aim high, keep the quality of the top artists' work in mind, and do not ever get satisfied with your work.   If you find out that graff isn't for you, which is okay, you have to try things to decide if they are for you or not, then just try to do as little damage as possible. Because the main problem isn't with the ones who get their adrenaline and excitement off of tagging and doing illegal stuff while developing, and eventually become incredible artists, the problem is with the many little kids who fuck up a city with shitty stuff and then stop graffiti, then all the damage was for no purpose. Don't be one of them, there's too many everywhere anyway."

graffhelp,3avdmq,JuvenileDelinquent,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:59:14 2015 UTC,Work on it man! Ahahaha. I haven't taken classes and I'm about your age
graffhelp,3asp4y,Valleyoan,3,Tue Jun 23 05:00:52 2015 UTC,Looks street to me. You plan on getting back into the game or just taking a stroll down memory lane?
graffhelp,3asp4y,jibsand,8,Tue Jun 23 06:47:08 2015 UTC,Yes.
graffhelp,3asp4y,jibsand,5,Tue Jun 23 08:05:54 2015 UTC,Good answer

graffhelp,3asp4y,RZRtv,2,Tue Jun 23 09:11:56 2015 UTC,"Still looks like you've got it. If there's anything I'd change a bit, it'd be the E. Round out the top portion a little better, and maybe have the bottom of it curl up and around to have nice symmetry with your A's left sweeping leg."
graffhelp,3asp4y,g0re,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:58:26 2015 UTC,"I dig it man, especially those hands. I write agore, and you've got some unique flairs on those letters."
graffhelp,3at21d,Macca78,2,Tue Jun 23 07:41:30 2015 UTC,is it meant to be done in one fluid motion?   Yes.  Learn your body's natural motions and develop that muscle memory. That's where your personal style comes from.
graffhelp,3at21d,jibsand,2,Tue Jun 23 08:13:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, so move my whole body not just arm?  And would you outline a letter in one motion? parts of it? or the whole piece?"
graffhelp,3at21d,jibsand,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:14:29 2015 UTC,"Just watch seen, his can control is top tier but it's a great look at the throw up process  https://youtu.be/jzDnuMLB5CU"

graffhelp,3at21d,jibsand,2,Tue Jun 23 12:29:52 2015 UTC,"Each line should be one motion yeah, that’s how you get them clean"
graffhelp,3at21d,MrRikka,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:49:32 2015 UTC,thanks for the reply...each line as in the whole letter or stop when you need to turn the can in a different direction?
graffhelp,3at21d,MrRikka,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:07:28 2015 UTC,as embarrassed as i am it'll probably help to see what i mean  Throwie Practice 1
graffhelp,3at21d,MrRikka,2,Tue Jun 23 08:11:45 2015 UTC,"These letters are really overcooked. Try using really REALLY simple letters and remember to keep your movements fluid and natural.  Otherwise this is surprisingly clean, give yourself a little more credit bruh."
