halifax,3dzr6r,Lord_Nuke,5,Mon Jul 20 21:12:36 2015 UTC,Friday listings won't be there till Wednesday. Theaters only show listings Thursday-Thursday as they might have to scale movies back if they bomb or keep them on screens if they pull good business.
halifax,3dzr6r,maximumice,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"Just to echo this. Here's a bit more info.   Sometimes (very rarely), the distributor will negotiate showtimes and screens with an exhibitor a week or more in advance to facilitate advance tickets. But it only happens for the biggest films and usually only for the first week.   Almost all other showtimes are negotiated (I kid you not) on a screen by screen basis between the individual distributor, say Warners and the exhibitor (in our case Cineplex). This is a complex process and begins on Monday mornings. That is when the weekend results are available and exhibitors can decide what should be sent packing (didn't do well) or remain on screen. Then the blank screens start getting filled in by new films and by Tuesday evening usually the showtimes are set. At least as of a few years ago it was still a very labour intensive process that involved heated negotiations.  Each major distributor will have somewhat of a traditional ""right"" to a screen at a theatre. So for example, at a 6 screen theatre, Fox would expect that at least one screen would always be showing a film of theirs, Warners the same etc. So even the biggest films will only hit a certain number of screens because the exhibitor can't simply not show any Fox films when Harry Potter (Warners) is released. To do so would ensure Fox was in a foul mood for negotiation when their next big blockbuster came out.   There are many factors that get negotiated - which screen (i.e. a big auditorium is more desirable, especially if it has extra features), how many showtimes will play, when the first showtime occurs (Disney for example used to enforce a rule where evening shows couldn't start before 7 pm) and of course what % of the box (sometimes 80%) the studio gets to keep.   And then on Monday - they start the negotiation all over again."
halifax,3dzr6r,gregpoirier,0,Wed Jul 22 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"The full schedule for Cineplex doesn't show up until the Tuesday night/Wednesday morning before the weekend. You shouldn't be able to see very much, if anything, for Friday dates at any theatre. And the theatre almost never closes."

This was sketchy from Day 1: ""Register and give us your money, and we promise we'll do it... at some point this summer...  somewhere in Halifax"".  It was clear they only announced it to see how much uptake they got before committing to actually doing it. The Citadel Hill people said nothing had been booked as of a few weeks ago.  Now they blame it on street conditions. If only we had a huge GRASS hill somewhere central to the city? Or even failing that, some bags of sand to fill in any problematic potholes.  If you search Google News, you'll see dozens of other cancellations being announced by them. Presumably for all the cities where citizens were not keen to shower them in registration dollars without a location being confirmed. https://www.google.ca/search?q=slide+the+city+cancelled&oq=slide+the+city+cancelled&aqs=chrome..69i57.3572j0j9&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=slide+the+city+cancelled&safe=off&tbm=nws"

halifax,3dw000,bigKaye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:34:25 2015 UTC,Well they were never ever going to set up on Citadel Hill. Too damn steep. If you look at their videos they set the slide up on a really small grade hill probably to ensure safety.

halifax,3dvg2m,bigKaye,9,Sun Jul 19 21:32:21 2015 UTC,"The OP said hardwired, meaning wiring it directly into the switched 12V power in the vehicle, not just plugging it into a cigarette lighter.   To the OP: The job is very very easy to do yourself and I strongly recommend you do so. There is a conductor in the passenger-side A-pillar that has +12V switched power on it that you can tap into. You'll need a plastic trim-removal tool to pop off the A-pillar cover. There are lots of threads on the Chargerforum(s/z) about hardwired dashcam installs. The hour or two of labour to have a shop do it will drive the price way through the not-worth-it barrier.  Don't cheap out on a dashcam, either. I'm running a SG9665GC and it's been excellent. It's a higher quality version of the generic A118."

You just put water in a box and it grows itself, but I can't find it anymore. You can still get those on ebay, but I could never make them green and fresh like those in the farmer's market. The farmers must have used some sort of green magic."

If so, probably the best public school High School is Auburn Drive. I believe Astral Drive Elementary / Astral Drive Jr. High are probably the best feeder schools for Auburn - but high school probably matters more than early education. Think about it a little.   Cole Harbour and environs is pretty solidly middle class, little poverty or other major problems. Portland Estates area is nice too but probably more expensive.  I'd heartily commend Cole Harbour for most people. It's a pretty quiet area.  I suggest you consider a few other things in terms of location as well, that might not be immediately obvious:   Will you be commuting into Halifax daily? Or to some other location? Check out the route, and try driving it a few times at rush hour.  Living on bus routes yields traffic, busses lumbering by loudly at 6:00+ in the morning. On the other hand, bus routes get priority in plowing out of snow and provide alternatives if your car breaks down or whatever. We can get a LOT of snow some winters - this past winter we got a ludicrous amount and had snow piled up higher than 6' on pretty much every curb, and had multiple 2+ feet snowfalls. Your job and and if you have the means to have multiple vehicles for your family makes the most difference here.   Good luck!"

Universities pay sessional instructors poverty level wages (but still charge students full tuition for the classes they're teaching). This means that they're often forced to work more than one job to support themselves while still being expected to research and publish. It's a system that seems designed to keep smart, talented, and educated people from rising in the world. Factoring in being a woman and being a visible minority would most likely make it even tougher. I hope she's able to make a success of her new position and finds things easier in Iowa."

halifax,3dnhsz,mathcow,7,Fri Jul 17 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"While a stadium would look nice in Shannon Park and that it's probably a really nice area to develop a stadium the question remains as to how does it make money. A CFL team would use it maybe 10 nights a year. What about the other nights? While stadiums are not used every night, I think that funds could be better spent on other needs at the moment.   In 10 years, when Halifax has added more population and has developed then we should think about maybe, maybe, adding a multi-purpose stadium. I really like the stadium that they have in Ottawa. It really ties in the area."
halifax,3dnhsz,lobbgop,5,Fri Jul 17 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a controversial issue no matter what and people will be upset. It's prime land that needs millions just to remove the derelict buildings on the site. I recommend anyone who has an opinion to visit the site, it's a real mess. This is not the popular opinion here but I would like a privately funded stadium on the site. Not 'world class', something reasonable for multiple uses such as concerts and community events, and yes sports. There seem to be private groups willing to fund it now, it seems like the most economical choice. I do not believe taxpayers should fund this."

halifax,3dnhsz,Whispertron,4,Sat Jul 18 11:03:04 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a stadium and CFL team in Halifax, but Shannon Park is absolutely the wrong place for it. Windmill Road cannot handle the amount of traffic that a stadium would entail; traffic jams would quickly bring the area to a standstill, similar to what happened with the recent road hockey tournament held in Shearwater.  IMO, the best place would be just on the other side of Dartmouth Crossing. There is plenty of room to build (an adjacent hotel would be an excellent idea); it's close to the airport for visiting teams and fans; and a dedicated exit could be constructed to avoid overstressing current infrastructure."
halifax,3dnhsz,JohnoTheFoolish,2,Sat Jul 18 11:18:18 2015 UTC,"I have no interest in a stadium, but I totally agree that if one was built Shannon Park is totally NOT the right place for one."

I'd really like that area to be developed into a large complex including an aquarium (which Halifax really really needs) and other outdoor and indoor sporting venues.

Despite being very progressive (many would label me a supporter of social justice causes) I've always cringed when she's weighed in on or been interviewed on a news issue. I can't quite put my finger on why...maybe I just find her to be overly dramatic or sensational?  I wish her all the best with her new position but I look forward to seeing less of her in our media.

I'm really frustrated with some of your comments in this thread and I wanted to explain why. I'm not sure if you'll understand where I'm coming from or not.  You seem very quick to dismiss anyone who doesn't agree with you as being racist, bigoted, sexist or a men's right activist. While it's easy to throw around labels like this as a way to belittle or dismiss the opinions of others it's a terrible way to open a dialog or have a discussion. All this does is furthers the narrative of an ""us vs. them"" mentality when the truth is often much more complex.  In this case we seem to share a lot of common ground; we both support many of the political views that El seems to be passionate about, although we differ on her tactics and the way she presents these topics in public.  I agree that a poet laureate should be a hell-raiser in many way and help to bring awareness to causes that they are passionate about or (especially) if they are typically overlooked or under reported on.   Rather than using our common ground as a basis to start an intelligent and interesting discussion on how best to go about raising awareness for this issues without intimidating or turning off Joe Public you've seen fit to shut down the discussion by labeling anyone who doesn't 100% agree with you with colorful terms which are non-starters.  We've got a great platform for debate, but the nature of typical online discourse limits our ability to use it, which makes me very sad."
halifax,3dm0jb,sleither,-8,Fri Jul 17 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"This is an incredibly insightful and well written comment.   I don't deny my tactics are ugly and probably ineffective, but that's because after months of trying it with the gloves on I've grown very angry, disillusioned, and more than a little cynical.   My problem is now -whether real or imagined- I see this shit everywhere. I see people criticizing one of the best creative and political minds in this province because she's not polite enough about being a radical... and it drives me crazy.  You could call this my own temper tantrum, I see a website and community I love being infused with the hatred and poison of brigading jerks and feel I've got nothing left but to just go around swinging with my words and flame it all wherever I can.   Your comment in and of itself is far from racist or sexist, but the reality is is provides a platform for all of those people to continue to easily dismiss El, and I'm tired of it.   When it was all early adopters here, reddit was a wondefully progressive and intellectually open place, but it's not that way anymore. I'm not afraid to admit that I'm wrong in my approach, I've just quite literally had it."

I try to go into things with an attitude of civil discourse with a goal of education, though the fact that I myself am a middle income white male does give me the freedom to disengage when I need to take a step back and recharge my batteries when I'm feeling burned out from some of the endless sea of crap that seems to flow online sometimes.  Nova Scotia does have a long way to go, and today we did lose a very prominent voice (whether we personally agree with that voice or not!). If we can't keep people who are passionate about our communities then we certainly do have a problem."

halifax,3dm0jb,sluggymutrat,-10,Fri Jul 17 16:19:45 2015 UTC,It has to do with the popular opinion on reddit that she's a problem because she's not the quiet thoughtful and demure little lady they want her to be... even though her opinions are deeply thoughtful and not illogical in any way.

So when a man has difficulty getting custody of his children? That discrimination comes from the patriarchy and the average belief that women are better at child rearing. That's not feminism that caused that, it's our male dominated society relegated females to child rearing long ago.  And when a strong woman gets labeled a bitch for taking a stand on something, it's exactly the same.   You have a child like understanding of feminism."

Feminism may argue that all gender roles  are faulty and damaging but they will only ever fight against female roles. Men have a hard time getting custody? Well that's because of patriarchy and that hurts men too! But feminists won't ever do jack shit about it. Because feminism is a very toxic and close minded philosophy.

If you don't see an end sign (i.e. only one arrow) or a green parking sign after it, you are to assume that the continuing sign applies to the end of the street.  The sign that had the street cleaning restriction also had the end sign and the green day allowance sign on it, so arguing that the sign was missing means you shouldn't have parked there at all.

There are quite a few festivals each year in the Maritimes and people would probably just opt for a different festival.

Anyone who goes to an outdoor concert knows how overpriced the water is (4-5$ a bottle). Dylan was known to smoke a little weed here and there. When he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest he suffered multiple seizures and strokes. After being unconscious for a few days, he was pronounced brain dead. His mother decided to donate his organs to those that need them.   Drugs or no drugs, bottom line is that a kid died here. A mother lost her son. Step siblings lost a brother. And we....

Sure drug testing works in a place where you have good educated drug aware people and it's legalized in many areas. Here though, not so much. I'm not saying your wrong, just that an over-night change in policy is far from the answer.  Blame: Still an event issue and obviously, heavily, personal responsibility; I touted that already though.

halifax,3di7ti,morguejuice,4,Thu Jul 16 18:28:35 2015 UTC,Ahhh the ol' Halifax Jizzfest. A proud part of our heritage.
halifax,3di7ti,Thordane,3,Fri Jul 17 01:35:51 2015 UTC,This is a horrifying picture
halifax,3di7ti,ross1550,4,Thu Jul 16 18:44:40 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who'd actually like to see this picture?
halifax,3di7ti,haligonianer,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:43:01 2015 UTC,"He became ill at the festival   He had pre-existing medical issues, as the family readily admits.   his death is definitely still linked to the festival, whether people like it or not   If I die on a plane, that doesn't mean it's linked to flying or the airline.  It could be a genuine coincidence.  Nobody will know well enough to say either way until the actual cause of death is determined.  It's irresponsible for the Herald to be publishing speculative pieces like these under the guise of journalism.  It isn't the first time they've done it, either.  They're flirting the line with sensationalism to move more papers; trying desperately to survive with a dying business model.  It's a shame that they're cashing in their integrity and dignity for such short-term gain."
halifax,3di7ti,Lusankya,7,Thu Jul 16 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"If you die on a plane and whether it is a coincidence or not I can guarantee you that the flight number and airline will be posted all over the media. We are sensationalists when it comes to airplanes and drugs.  It's sad that this individual died while attending the concert and it's sad that people will attribute a small sample of the culture of Evolve (drugs, which he was cleared of) to his untimely death.   He was participating in a fun weekend."
halifax,3di7ti,PaulsPizzaBurgers,13,Thu Jul 16 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"But they would still say something along the lines of ""person dies while flying on XXXX airline"""
halifax,3di7ti,bobmarlies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"I doubt they would unless it was extremely unusual. Like the person died because of an accident inside the plane or something the fault of the airline or because of a crime on board. But people die on planes all the time. Have a relative who works as a quarantine officer at a major Canadian airport. They are medical professionals who respond first to any medical issues aboard a plane once it lands and make decisions around what needs to be done. They have more powers than the police in that they can force a passenger to go to the hospital or even quarantine an entire plane. Health Canada is serious when it comes to boarder protection/air travel. The pilots/crew also have immediate and quick access to doctors via radio who help them make decisions about a passengers health of a medical emergency happens mid flight.   Sometimes cases of passenger death make the news, but not as many as there are do. Definitely not every time. Old people kick the bucket from strokes and heart attacks mid flight all the time. If the flight is diverted because of a medical emergency then that's a little more newsworthy.   My brother has also been on two flights where a person died. None made the news."
halifax,3di7ti,unicornusrex,0,Sat Jul 18 00:03:37 2015 UTC,"Some would, some would just say ""a flight from x to y"". If the flight was from LAX to JFK, you might never know, without some digging. If the flight was from Ottawa to Iqaluit, you might as well say which airline, 'cause there is only one."
halifax,3di7ti,RangerNS,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"You're right, but if you died on a plane heading to or from NS the Herald would write about it regardless of how or why you died."

halifax,3di7ti,Musekal,11,Thu Jul 16 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"It has to do with Evolve when the doctor on call during the event goes on CBC to tell-all on how horribly it's managed and how these kids (this individual included) took excessive amounts of drugs then go 4 days without water and food and no-oversight by the festival organizers. The drug testing idea was stupid too, it gives a false impression that this event would somehow be 'safe' by knowing you're consuming pure cocaine etc.; well isn't that great /s.   I believe the doctor who made a futile attempt trying to save this poor mans life over any journalist."
halifax,3di7ti,jeffaulburn,13,Thu Jul 16 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what the festival is supposed to do to make the event safer. Is there water? Shelter? Paramedics on site? Food available? You can't protect people from themselves, as we learned from Peggy's Cove. What needs to change?"
halifax,3di7ti,shipwrekkt,-2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's obvious.  Check bags and people for drugs really. You won't stop all use but you'll stop enough and maybe, maybe, prevent some deaths.  Also having a better organized system for the hired staff. The on-call doctor didn't seem to think the hired staff was doing a great job.   When her interview is on CBC's website it might be good to give her a listen for yourself."
halifax,3di7ti,jeffaulburn,9,Thu Jul 16 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I looked for it and it's not online yet. I honestly don't think there would be an Evolve Festival without the drugs - drugs are pretty central to what Evolve is. That's not to say that every single person there is on drugs, but I would say the vast majority of people are. Drugs, in an of themselves, are not bad. However it is important to use them safely, to be educated on dosage and purity, to get adequate food & water, to have a supportive group of friends who look out for each other. If it does in fact turn out that mushrooms was the only drug ingested in this case, then we should probably start considering previous medical issues in conjunction with sun, nutrition deficiency, and an altered state."
halifax,3di7ti,shipwrekkt,2,Thu Jul 16 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"no matter how pure your drugs are, if you take too much you're going to overdose."

halifax,3di7ti,shipwrekkt,3,Thu Jul 16 21:59:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, but some drugs are far easier to OD on. Some are downright impossible. Pot, for example."
halifax,3di7ti,Musekal,3,Thu Jul 16 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"What are you saying,..body frisk 5000+ people? FYI,...most all drugs are small and insanely easy to conceal.  I just don't see that as being feasible in any way.    I did hear the doctor on CBC (man o man,..hate to be her child) and i agree that more/better on-site medical staff would be good.  And i say that because i recognize that drug taking is going to happen whether or not people agree with it so we might work towards harm reduction rather than trying to stop something we can't possibly stop."
halifax,3di7ti,zeptepe,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"lol, yeah I guess that's not going to work is it. I don't know the answer though.  Yeah drug intake will happen, better education is the answer."
halifax,3di7ti,jeffaulburn,0,Thu Jul 16 17:42:07 2015 UTC,They do check bags. You obviously have never been there and are just talking out of your ass. There is a good security and first aid presence as well
halifax,3di7ti,Kris-tee-ana,0,Sat Jul 18 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Would it be as sensational and newsworthy if a ""Young man dies after going to Walmart'? It's fucking sensationalism at it's best and journalism at it's worst! This is not a story!"
halifax,3di7ti,Blitzman123,24,Thu Jul 16 15:35:03 2015 UTC,Some people get high on drugs and some get high on their own sense of moral superiority.
halifax,3di7ti,eddiedougie,23,Thu Jul 16 14:08:43 2015 UTC,An early autopsy revealed no trace of drugs in his blood.   Reading comprehension is key.
halifax,3di7ti,Trendiggity,7,Thu Jul 16 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"Actually the doctor speaking on CBC today indicated drugs ARE a factor among many (lack of food and water, by choice, for the individual). It's sad and it was completely avoidable. He had two heart attacks before leaving the venue with the paramedics. This was not due to pe-existing conditions. The drugs he did consume (reported by friends and witnesses) are just not easy to detect (according to the doctor speaking on CBC at noon today).  Perhaps, not jumping to conclusions unit the medical community speaks is more like it. This ""thatbullshiteh"" guy was right all along, personal responsibility was the issue."
halifax,3di7ti,jeffaulburn,2,Thu Jul 16 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the doctor speaking on the CBC today has nothing to do with the articles linked.   Reading said articles, the information provided is a) drugs were not detected and b) the doctor was basing her opinion that drugs (mushrooms) were present by what she was told second hand.  I'm almost 100% that drugs will be found to be a factor in this young man's death. But to just instantly assume it was drugs (when both articles would indicate there has been no proof found yet) is just jumping to conclusions. That's all. I know I was feeding the troll but meh."
halifax,3di7ti,Trendiggity,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"There is no audio link for the doctors comments yet, this was the only thing I could supply.   It was pretty easy to narrow down to three things though so far for her; drugs, no food, no water, no over-sight on the events part to stop drug use at all and how pointless drug testing would be (ie: great, so now pure drugs so I consume more.)  Regardless, what I said was basically what will appear online soon with her own words."
halifax,3di7ti,jeffaulburn,-9,Thu Jul 16 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"An early autopsy   What the fuck is an early autopsy? As opposed to a late autopsy?

halifax,3di7ti,Lusankya,7,Thu Jul 16 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like they did a pre-autopsy. The beginning of the article says that they haven't done an autopsy yest, so the ""early autopsy"" would be the drug testing and probably a few other peripheral/less invasive things to figure out if there's any obvious cause of death."
halifax,3di7ti,kinkakinka,3,Thu Jul 16 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, but they probably should have just called it a pre-autopsy.  I know I'm just splitting hairs on terminology, but ""early autopsy"" is (IMO) evoking an image of a vivisection."
halifax,3di7ti,Lusankya,17,Thu Jul 16 15:46:49 2015 UTC,The family doesn’t yet know the particulars of what happened to cause the medical distress but Champion has had seizures in the past and there is a family history of epilepsy. An early autopsy revealed no trace of drugs in his blood.   This is getting downvoted to oblivion because it's wrong and stupid.
halifax,3di7ti,dougieman6,12,Thu Jul 16 15:59:40 2015 UTC,Reading more than just the title of articles is a lovely and rare thing.   I'm wondering if it was heat stroke related. That's a common precaution among the Evolve-goers that I know.

You're bang on saying personal responsibility was the issue here. It's tragic and it sucks to everyone, especially his family, but kids do stupid things all the time.

All of their box springs are $30 and the mattresses are pretty cheap but good quality as well.  I got my bedroom set from Surplus Freight and I'll never purchase anything from them again...horrible service and overly pushy sales people.  Just my 2 cents.

I'd say the Sears Outlet Store is your best bet. But it would help you immensely if you know what you're looking for.

halifax,3dk5zr,flannellavallamp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:38:42 2015 UTC,It's basically as simple as asking if they can do eyed on the price. Say it's a little more than you were budgeting for.   Even better if you can say someone else will give you a better price. And even better still if someone actually will and you can demonstrate that. Just say you went to Sleep Country. They heavily discount like used car salesmen.

Your best bet is if you have the serial numbers to go to used stores, pawn stores etc and check to see if they've been turned in. There's also a bike place on Windsor street (in halifax)  that seems to house a shitload of used bikes. I'd check them out as well.  Check kijiji daily to see if any used bikes come up for sale. They seem to deal in a lot of used bikes so I wouldn't be surprised if thiefs go there as well.

If you want your kids to become socialized with dogs, maybe just ask a friend with a calm dog to be a test subject. Don't trust an entire park full of dogs in ""omg it's run around and be crazy time"" mode. That will make the fear just so much worse.

It certainly wasn't Halifax in March so we didn't give a shit.  The food was fine, there's a water park right next door so you can do the pool or beach or rad waterslides with no lines.

Calling back to Canada to sort that out once cost me over $30, toll free isn't always free.  See if your cell provider has packages, most resorts got WiFi (except Cuba which is $7/30 min dialup) I took with my phone but flipped the sim card around. Do note they may wish to electronically search this at the airport.  I always ask for non-ground level rooms, so people can't easily slide the broken patio door open and get in. Also helps with bugs/critters. I  also take with a literal length of clothes line and tie it across the balcony. Ground levels usually only got patio stone as well, nothing to tie it to. Great for drying clothing/swimwear.   Ram a towel under the door at night. Mosquito's know no bounds and the door sweeps generally are broken. Awakening to looking like you got the mumps sucks.   Take Thermos style mugs (bubba) if you want to adventure around but have drinks. The resort will only have 6-8oz flimsy cups. Terrible for walking with, much less a trek down the beach.

Whether you go with a company or a cash job make sure you get an HVAC tech doing the job.

I'm the guy you helped out with the cheap Senville heat pump I'd installed in my shed. I fought for a couple of months with them over the warranty on the thing... they were going to send me a compressor first, after that didn't show up in the mail I called them up - they claimed that compressors never fail and the 4 way valves sometimes do, and I'd have to buy and install a new 4-way valve before they'd honor the compressor warranty. I really didn't want to throw part after part at the thing, they compromised and gave me a deal on a new outdoor unit. Installed and working now, hopefully it lasts longer than the previous unit.  Overall I spent $1200 and taxes on the heat pump and hardware, and $500 on tools to install it. Then ~$200 on NewReddit_NS's time and R410A, and finally $400+taxes on the new outdoor unit. That cheap heat pump ended up being an expensive pain in the ass, and at the end of the day I've still got a cheap heat pump."

You'll see many homes have two separate pumps, that's why. (Unless you're only after one head, then disregard)  Lennox best bang for buck, Mitsubishi Mr slim best functionality.. Rest personal preference. Look for warranties and who actually services it. As for install, ask about support. Some offer one year, some two, some have deductibles, some vanish overnight.

I haven't heard anything about Lennox."
halifax,3dfko5,beaverbanker,5,Wed Jul 15 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"Mini-split is synonymous with ductless when it comes to heat pumps, regardless of the number of heads. Some brands denote systems with more than one head as ""Multi-split"".   Daikin, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and LG tend to be considered the top tier units, offering the highest efficiencies, and the longest warranties. I believe Daikin's is 12 years now. They're the only brand I'm really familiar with though, so I can't comment on the others.  Look at warranty, as well as efficiencies when comparing units. Most units are marketed based on SEER rating, but that's a cooling efficiency rating; compare the HSPF number to review heating performance (which is what most people in this climate are most concerned with). Sometimes a few extra dollars up front are easily recouped in operating and maintenance costs down the road."

halifax,3dfko5,k_anthony,2,Wed Jul 15 22:57:51 2015 UTC,We have two LG units and they have worked great both heating and cooling so far. Supplementing oil heat but we didn't need to use it this winter other than for hot water.  One thing I will suggest is that you try and remember where drifts were on your house this past winter and try not to put the units there or at least higher up. One of the units we installed is in a bad place for drifting snow and I spent a lot of time digging it out. Obviously this winter was a pretty bad case but just something to keep in mind as they can and will ice up if in a bad spot.
halifax,3dfko5,cfudge,2,Thu Jul 16 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Nova Scotia Power's heat pump contractor list is a great place to start as they pre-screen the contractors and have good requirements for them to be listed: http://heatpumpssetyoufree.ca/find-a-heat-pump-contractor/  Even if you don't use their ""finance on your power bill"" program they've done a lot of filtering work for you.   Also: Remember that even if the box for the outdoor unit and the box for the indoor unit says they are ""Energy Star"" it doesn't mean they have been tested to work properly together. Lots of the discount sellers are moving whatever indoor and outdoor units they can get cheapest, but haven't ever been proven to work properly together.   Last: If you haven't already, get a Home Energy Assessment through Efficiency Nova Scotia's program. They've got a $50 discount on for the summer, so $150 is going to teach you a ton about how your house performs but you can also get the real data on exactly what size heat pumps your home requires based on the blower door test data and modelling of your home instead of sales people making guesses based on square footage. Spend the $150 before you spend $5-$10K. http://www.efficiencyns.ca/energy-solutions/home-energy-assessment/  DM me if you'd like more detailed info!"

It will tell you how much heat a heat pump will put out at a given indoor and outdoor temperatures. Some manufacturers make this really hard to find, b/c if you look at these, it won't look good for them.    Ex.    Lenox rates their systems sat 15000 btu  @ 0 degrees,  but Fujitsu rates theirs at the lowest operating temperature.  Say 15000 btu @ -27.  At -27 the Lennox unit would have frozen up and would have stopped producing heat.  @ 0 degrees the Fujitsu was putting out more then 15000 btu.   Each model has a different table / curve. Single indoor have better efficiency and lower heat.    Fujitsu ' low temperature single head was the best option I could find last year, although there are changes I'm  tech each year.  Their cost was a bit more than a Lennox,  but for good reason.    Mitsubishi, LG and Daikin were close, but the guys I got quotes from didn't provide any curve data.  There is no way to compare what you are gettig without it.  Also Daikin and Lennox wanted to charge to $200 / year to come and ""inspect and maintain"" the unit.  Normally just to to hose off the outdoor unit if it gets build up on it.  No pressure washer, is what I've been told. Hope it helps."

I'm not saying just anyone can go install one of these systems, but if you're a DIY kinda person & take the time to do the research watch some YouTube videos and buy the needed equipment it's not rocket science.  Building a deck properly is more difficult than bending some copper pipe and drilling some holes....     I shipped mine up from Florida to Houlton and picked it up there last spring when the dollar was still decent. The company has been great and one of my blower fans was slightly off balance and they sent me a new one along with a new motor immediately.  My townhouse was heated by electric and this winter my power bills were cut in 1/2 and they are more efficient than the AC units I was using so I'm saving money year round and living more comfortably."

I have perfect vision, but at night in the rain I strain as hard as I can to see the road markers - and even in perfect daylight they are often completely gone. I see this as being broken into two problems:  1) Lane separators: this is the most dangerous problem, which will lead to a head-on collision. Try coming up from the rotary at night in rain - it's a game of ""I think my lane should be about here"". We badly need the reflective lane markers, even if they cost 15x more. Because clearly the city can't keep up with using the new water-based paint.  2) Turn indicators: I've come to a few intersections recently where I have no idea if a lane is a left-turn only, etc. Hanging lane marker signs would be a solution that works ear-round. I pity anyone driving here from out of town."

Left lane is for turning left, right lane is for turning right, when the traffic is flowing, right lane is for straight through, and when coming up to a red light, left lane is for straight through (so right turn on red people can turn right).  I don't know why that is confusing."
halifax,3ddci8,akaliant,12,Wed Jul 15 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"One that comes to mind is going east through Jubilee & Oxford. It's two lanes, but the right lane must exit.  However, without turn markings that's not obvious, especially how the intersection is aligned. So if you take away the turn arrows, it can be very confusing.

They are generally marked as left turn only with a painted arrow.   I don't know why that is confusing.   If lanes arbitrarily change depending on who has their car where, I don't know how it couldn't be confusing.   I was always told that in an unmarked intersection where two lanes turn into one, the lane closest to the center line continues through. If the most center lane is being used to turn left, you are permitted to go around them using the right hand lane. You are NOT permitted to use the right hand lane to pass, as technically that lane does not exist anymore on the other side of the intersection.  There are a couple of intersections like this on Almon street that are unmarked"

I was a founding member of the Halifax Makerspace. This is exactly what it was supposed to be. Then more people got involved. Then the overall vision changed.   Since a few of the directors had no car, it had to be on a bus route. That fucks all of the industrial areas. Then it had to be downtown because students. Well students don't have money, and there's no industrial spaces downtown. We had a small electronics workshop in the Roy for a few months then the building was torn down.  Then it became all about teaching and learning and someone literally said a 90 year old grandmother was the target market.  We partnered with NSCAD for space, got shafted (exactly as I predicted we would), so I left. Now they don't even have a space.   Last I heard they were working on the exact same deal with the exact same terms in T4G's office building on Kempt road.  It's really a chicken and egg problem. You need people to get the money to get the space. you need space to get the people.  Realistically it's ~$1000 a month for a good sized workshop. Split between 20 people and it's not really that bad. Most people with the skill or time or money to do such a thing lives in the burbs and has a garage. They don't want to travel to work on things. You just need the right 20 people.   The only way it's really going to happen is if someone wealthy were to bootstrap it by dropping $100k to fund a building and a FTE for a year. Then you have members right away and it's sustainable. As of last fall Volta was looking to do so in the old library. I've been out of the loop on that for a while."

halifax,3de6uc,bigKaye,-1,Thu Jul 16 10:51:53 2015 UTC,"If you're salary there's a chance your vacation pay was accounted for in your annual salary amount. If you receive the same amount every pay regardless of if you worked it or if you were on vacation you are likely getting your vacation pay in this manner, meaning you actually were already paid for your vacation time.   Some companies may offer to buyback unused vacation time (basically paying you for the work you did when you should have been on vacation), or allow you to carry unused time forward to be added to the next year. Both of these options are basically ways of them trying to cover their ass for not making you take your vacation like they're legally supposed to, but going to the labour board won't get you compensated if you only worked your normal scheduled hours in place of your vacation time. Your worked vacation hours won't add up to enough to require overtime pay when divvied over the year; the only thing that would happen is your employer would get a slap on the wrist, and your HR department / manager won't like you very much."
halifax,3de6uc,maximumice,0,Thu Jul 16 01:53:56 2015 UTC,This. Depends where you work. Some places will cut you a cheque. It's more common that they will force you to take the time off or lose it.
halifax,3de6uc,papercrane,2,Wed Jul 15 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"You should never lose vacation, really anywhere (very few exceptions). That's really illegal"

halifax,3de6uc,burn2down,3,Wed Jul 15 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"Standards are here  The abbreviated version that covers most full-time people:   Minimum of 2 weeks vacation per 12 months. Goes up to 3 weeks after 8 years. Employer decides when vacation is taken, minimum 1 week notice. You cannot lose this minimum by not taking it. Vacation must be taken, unless you work less then 90% of the regular working hours. In which case they must be paid out their vacation pay."

halifax,3de6uc,papercrane,2,Wed Jul 15 16:05:48 2015 UTC,"That's a question for your HR/boss people. Each company can be different.  Where I work, if you don't use your vacation, you can carry it forward to the next year. But there's a limit to how much you can carry forward. So if you take 0 vacation for a couple years, you're throwing away your vacation time.  There's other classes of employees that are on an hourly rate and they can choose to have it paid out in cash or time off."
halifax,3de6uc,Blitzman123,2,Wed Jul 15 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"Ours doesn't force you to take it, they also will not pay it out and if you don't take it by a specified time, you lose it. Big corporation that prides itself on taking care of it's people :/"
halifax,3de6uc,papercrane,7,Wed Jul 15 16:21:33 2015 UTC,Yeah that's illegal. By law you earn 4-6% of your gross wages as vacation pay. If they aren't paying that out then they are literally stealing from their employees.
halifax,3de6uc,Vanq86,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"I'm on salary and the reality is I wind up taking additional time that isn't ""booked"". No one is watching my time when i need to go to doctor's appointments or run errands, etc... It is a company policy for salaried employees though, that if you don't take your ""booked"" time you lose it. I use booked time for actual vacations when I leave town. There are days when I come in for a couple of hours and then fuck off the rest of the day. Of course there are days when I work more than the usual, so yea it balances in that regard."
halifax,3de6uc,papercrane,4,Wed Jul 15 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"Still illegal. Every employee (except for some exceptions, you don't work on a fishing boat do you?) earns vacation pay. This vacation pay must be paid to the employee. There are no exceptions for ""salaried"" employees and if an employer isn't doing this then they're in for a bad time if an employee ever decides to go the labour board."
halifax,3de6uc,Vanq86,2,Wed Jul 15 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"You are right that not paying an employee their vacation pay is illegal, however a salaried employee has their vacation pay included in their annual salary amount, which is why they receive the same pay amount for a period they worked and a period they spent on vacation.   If an employee does not use their vacation time they are essentially working unpaid overtime to the tune of their allotted number of vacation hours spread over the entire year (not enough to reach mandatory overtime pay, in other words). Some companies will be nice and do a vacation buyback or allow employees to carry over some of the unused hours, but in the eyes of the law the employees received their vacation pay and chose to work unpaid overtime - unless they were never given an opportunity to use their vacation by their employer: in that case compensation in the form of overtime pay / vacation buyback almost certainly applies.   Typically the one time a salaried employee will receive a separate, calculated vacation pay is if they were hired late in the fiscal year and didn't have the opportunity to use any vacation accrued to that point, or if an employee quits without using the vacation hours they'd accrued to that point in the year."
halifax,3de6uc,Nautigirl,3,Thu Jul 16 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"Vacation pay is accrued no matter what. It must be accounted for on your pay stub as either cash money clearly labeled as vacation pay or as vacation days earned. If they disappear the company is violating the law. It's also illegal not to have the time off. Payout is only allowed of the employee worked less than 90% of the regular hours. Being salaried or not doesn't come into it.  As an aside, unpaid overtime is also illegal."
halifax,3de6uc,kinkakinka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"My point was if the person you were replying to is salary it is likely they already received their vacation pay as it's been calculated into their weekly / biweekly pay. Being salary doesn't affect the accrual, however many people don't understand that even if they didn't take the time off they were still paid for it.   Unpaid overtime is illegal, however overtime doesn't really begin until you hit 48 hours per week. If you didn't use your vacation time of say 80 hours for the year but you received the pay for it as part of your salary, the 80 extra hours you worked split across a 52 week year doesn't put you over 48 for a given week, so technically you didn't actually work any overtime at all.  The only fault there is your employer didn't force you to stay home - going to the labour board for that will likely get their hands slapped, but if you had the opportunity to use your vacation time the odds of getting compensated for the 'overtime' aren't very good."

halifax,3ddnvk,Vanq86,3,Wed Jul 15 14:49:37 2015 UTC,"This x2. Get a second opinion on the MVI, and at least a second quote on the work. The price of an inspection is set by regulation, so it's not uncommon for places to overhype non-issues to try to drum up business. If somebody thinks you're a pushover they may try hitting you up for work that doesn't really need to be done, so never just agree to let a shop fix whatever they find without showing you the problem first, and tell them you want to get a second opinion on any problems they do find. If they say that the car isn't safe to drive to another shop, tell them to put it back in the parking lot and you'll have your certified mechanic friend who works for their competitor come over to look at it in place. Just the potential of getting caught in a scam can make a place change its tune.   You may be able to avoid this kind of scam up front by telling them you're just there for the sticker and you'll be taking your car to your mechanic friend or family member to get any problems fixed. If the shop knows before they start that there is 0 chance of getting extra money from you regardless of the outcome, they lose the incentive to exaggerate or invent problems, and will just do what you really are asking them to do, which is make sure your car is safe to drive."

Safety inspection is a freaking racket any way - doesn't actually check a lot of critical systems that could have an actual impact on safety, and instead look at things like body panel rust.

halifax,3dg05p,halifaxnewswatcher,3,Wed Jul 15 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"maybe they should look at it by industry instead of absolute values.   By saying 'women make less' like that they're assuming equal distribution of jobs and industry.   How many women welders, IT people, or garbage people do you know? How many male nurses, social workers, dance instructors, etc..?  It's a ridiculous comparison. Compare the difference by industry would make way more sense.   Don't hold that against a specific city. Don't even hold it against the industry. And it's not even that they're not willing to hire women developers.  It's why waterloo is the bottom. The ONLY industry in waterloo is Software. There just aren't many female developers. It's less than 10%. As a woman you're basically guaranteed a great job for the sake of quotas and equality.  There are a shit ton of programs and training for women only. And still women just don't choose 'poring code for 12h days' as a career.   Blame that on the fucking patriarchy or social justice or binary gender roles I don't care, it's still reality. No women in my family want to be developers, or welders, or garbagepeople and get really mad if anyone suggests they should go into a generically 'male' career for the sake of quotas and equality."

I just got back from Europe and I was surprised how common it was to see cars driving 150+. I had a tiny rental car (Opel Corsa) and drove 140 when I was on the highway just to keep up with the average flow of traffic. Even then, cars blew past me quite frequently.  I'm not saying it's always safe to drive those speeds... and I know it's always illegal in this country... but from a purely hypothetical standpoint, you have to take more into account than just speed before throwing out the term reckless endangerment.  Edit: Please don't think I'm defending Marchand. I'm a Canucks fan and am still simmering over 2011."
halifax,3db7sh,Grimpy,11,Wed Jul 15 01:39:02 2015 UTC,"Safe speed is relative to road conditions and traffic conditions.

All it takes is one driver swerving at the right moment to avoid a pothole and you're in their backseat / in oncoming traffic / off the road into the trees."

Generally speaking, if you stay within Halifax south end/north end/downtown, you are a walking distance from a lot of city related activities. Also the public transit runs better/more frequently there. I live in Bedford and I have a car. Sometimes I find it hard to gauge my opinion on Hfx transit just because STM was so good and it's unfair to make a comparison.  As far as I know, uber is not a thing here. Taxis are more expensive than Montreal but they aren't particularly outrageous if you needed to take one late at night or whatever. Public transit essentially will get you around HRM, but as I mentioned before it's not as accessible or as frequent as STM.  There has been some reddit activity here and there so I would at least give it a shot!  Never done the train so I can't help you there!

Other great breweries include Garrison, North Brewing, Good Robot, Propeller - and a few restaurants/pubs that also do their own beer like RockBottom.

I also have a moderate fear of flying (nothing that would ever get in the way of flying, but it lingers in the back of my head like some kind of irrational troll) so this also contributes to the already horrible conditions I have to endure on a plane. Whenever I have to goto Toronto, I'd rather opt for the 5 hour train ride instead of the 1 hour flight just because the train is immeasurably more comfortable for someone of my stature. There is far more leg room, far bigger windows, it's a lot easier to get up and move around. For me, airplanes are just awful.

Is this going to or from Halifax? Going to Halifax, it seems to make sense as most of the Quebec part is at night (it departs Montreal at 6:30pm I believe).  Do you reckon that it's louder than a jet or prop plane?"

Stick them into google maps. I grew up close to there. There should be some well worn paths.  It's a somewhat popular place. Mostly teenagers.  The jump is pretty high. Sounds like 70ft from the above website. The pools aren't super very big but deep where you jump in. It's safe for the most part.. People have been severely injured there from miscalculated jumps. I remember at least a couple deaths but can't seem to find anything on google.    As long as you're careful you'll have a great time. Take a picnic and make a day of it.   Edit: stuff

halifax,3dcq46,webguy1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:43:57 2015 UTC,I don't remember how long it is to walk to regular way.  We always parked here (switch to satellite view). It's a private road so I guess you take you chances with that but it cuts the walk down to like 10 minutes.
halifax,3dcq46,fortsackville,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"been there a couple times, there will be these giant, half buried pipes in the ground on your way and you'll pass what looks like a waterpower plant or soemthing. and like webguy1 be saying, the paths are very well worn.  the massive jump is up on the cliffs, i actually forget how to get up there (never did the jump myself). the pool with the massive jump also has a much more manageable jump off the waterfall, about 15 or so feet. very relaxing compared to a massive 70ft jump, but still loads of fun. the next pool down has (had?) a great rope swing as well."

The only computer repair place I've tried in Dartmouth was CCS and the service was awful. This was years ago though.

halifax,3d9ad5,halifaxnewswatcher,13,Tue Jul 14 14:35:34 2015 UTC,"Eastlink is a joke. Their packages are laughable compared to Bells.  I get 75 down...30 up for internet..unlimited bandwidth. They have upgraded my download speed TWICE int he past 6 months with no change in price...i have home phone and their tv package for 99.99 a month on a 2 year package. To even come close to that with Eastlink you're looking at double that price.  And then on top of it, they charge you a month in advance. They are charging you before you use the service, and if you pay that, there is no interest on it.  This one month upfront is a deposit, its all it is. A fancy policy for a deposit, without calling it what it truely is. A deposit is meant to be kept separate and incurring interest as its held. With Eastlink only they benefit from interest when you pay early.  Bandwidth caps is a form of theft. There is no limit to internet bandwidth there is no pool of bandwidth we all take from and someday it might run out. To have data caps, is just wrong and its just another sign of whats wrong with Eastlink.  Here is a copy of my speed test.

halifax,3d9ad5,sc2caedus,-8,Tue Jul 14 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"Bandwidth caps keep people from affecting the services of those around them. You're right to say that there isn't a pool of bandwidth that will run out, but you're wrong to think that everyone has equal access all the time. A few heavy users in one area definitely affect other people in the area. Have you never experienced your internet slow down around the time people get off work and go online etc? And as for paying in advance, that's like so many other things. You pay your rent in advance, you buy your groceries before you can take them home, you pay for your gas before you use it. I don't understand the rage I've heard from people over paying in advance. It's not a big deal."
halifax,3d9ad5,Lemoncholy,3,Tue Jul 14 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"When paying for groceries and gas, i dont just hand them money and walk away to have them delivered down the road in a months time. i take them as i walk away. Your comparison doesnt hold up :(  and with Bell fiber op no i do not notice a drop in any speed at any time. My services are perfect and spot on 99% of the time.  bandwidth caps do not help the peole who have them imposed on them in anyway. its simply just another way for a company to gouge their customers and come up with stupid ways to charge more money. The concern, not rage, comes from Eastlink being greedy. i dont get the passiveness you have to just lay down, let them gather interest on your paid in advance money provide you with sub par service compared to the competition and for ridiculously increased prices."
halifax,3d9ad5,sc2caedus,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think I would call it sub par. I've never had a problem with my service that wasn't easily fixed on my end. I've never had to have a technician come out, that's for sure. I understand what you're saying about paying in advance, but from a business standpoint it makes sense. It doesn't hurt customers, and if it helps the company make money, why not? I just find it strange how fired up some people get. I think for most people it's because they think of cable and internet the same way as power. I don't know, it just doesn't bother me. And the bandwidth cap on rural wireless does make sense, where people can have a significant affect on others when there's not a lot of infrastructure. The caps in general are only on the really fast services. I would assume this is more to keep people from pirating tons of stuff and less to protect other users. I mean, 250 GB is pretty high."

That’s with out taking into consideration netflix/youtube/twitch.tv uploading/downloading work which alone is in the 100gigs a month.  Eastlink being the multi billion dollar corporation it is is giving it’s heavy users the finger instead of upgrading their systems.

That is the exact opposite of what a company should be doing."

halifax,3d9ad5,Karai17,4,Tue Jul 14 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"Eastlink's biggest problem is Bell. They've lost so many customers to FibreOp already because they just couldn't compete so now their only recourse is to squeeze every dime from those customers they still have - and they only have most of those customers because the only alternative is DSL or no alternative at all.  Unless they make serious changes, I don't think they'll be in the ISP business much longer. And that's not a good thing, if only because it will be the end of what competition there is for FibreOp and Bell will be a monopoly.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a FibreOp subscriber and I love it, but I don't think it would take Bell too long to start doing some less than savoury things if there were no competition at all."

halifax,3d9ad5,yedirtyweebuggerye,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"I used to be so defensive over Eastlink. Before fibreop, they had the best deals and I didn't have many problems with them. Now I can't even stand them. I'm very happy with Bell's service and speeds. My speed has even increased without notice or any price increase. And now I've been hearing about more price hikes from Eastlink. Was paying almost $200 with eastlink to get not even half the speeds I'm getting now with Aliant. No thanks, Eastlink. You should really try harder.  The only thing Eastlink is really good for now is wireless."
halifax,3d9ad5,xScruffers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:30:27 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I heralded Eastlink with much fanfare over the years and would always laugh at Bell's awful attempts at gaining customers back. But Eastlink has stagnated and their prices were no longer that great. When they finally released their wireless service (several years later than anticipated) their revolutionary service was.... identical to everyone else. Their pricing was the same, their plans were the same... They brought NOTHING new to the table. That's really when my disappointment started to grow.  Bell came back heavy hitting with FibreOp and even the first couple years I ignored it, but last year a sales person came to our building and it's really hard to say no to triple speeds, no bandwidth cap all for the same price.  I bit the bullet and haven't looked back. My speeds have gone from 20/2 to 50/30 (then bumped to 75/30, and then again to 100/30!). The connexion is far more reliable. The price is the same.  Eastlink grew because everyone was sick of Aliant's bullshit. Now Eastlink has become the company they helped to change. Fuck them."

If you have issues where during certain times of day you only get say, 50% of your advertised speeds due to network congestion (or throttling), speed testing sites will still be reading close to what your maximum speed is supposed to be."
halifax,3d9ad5,jessicalifts,2,Tue Jul 14 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agreed. But still, they can't make the speed test site report a higher speed than the available bandwidth between you and the speed test site. So they are a useful test for:   establishing the actual service speed that has been provisioned validating that your physical connection is capable of actually delivering that speed validating that your router has the capacity to handle the amount of bandwidth you are paying your ISP for validating that your local network (wired or wireless) is capable of delivering that much bandwidth to your end device   So yes, I agree, seeing 148 Mbit/sec on a 150 Mbit/sec service in no way guarantees that you have that much bandwidth available from YouTube or for bittorrenting - but it does validate that the basic L1/L2/L3 service between you and the ISP is provisioned and working correctly."

You know who also doesn't understand the economic and technical challenges around providing high speed network access in sparsely-populated areas? Eastlink, apparently.

The winter is going to be cold and wet and make the inside of your nose hurt. Fall is gorgeous. I don't know how much scenery you will get to take in but by golly trees in autumn are like you've not seen. I find nova scotians to be friendlier and less uppity than the victim island folk. If you miss home too much I'd suggest a trip to cape Breton because it will feel more homey to you than Halifax. UM I don't know how Victoria treats their navy but you will be looked up to back home for sure. Navy boys are our fav ;) I hope you like Alexander keiths because it is a staple there.

The agent is unable to look up the Red Book value for your vehicle, and will trust the receipt for what you paid.  Later on, their computers run the number you paid against Red Book.  If the discrepancy is too great, a bill is sent for the difference, with an option to seek a professional appraisal to confirm the price you paid is fair.  You will then owe the difference between your receipt and either the Red Book amount or the appraisal.  It's supposed to be whichever is higher, but you'd be pretty cracked to send the appraisal results in if they were higher than what Access is asking for.  You have to pay for an appraisal out of pocket.  It usually works out to be cheaper to just pay the tax, unless it's pretty beat up (think cars bought for restoration).  I recently paid tax on a receipt for $2k, for a car that was at least $5k on Black Book.  I never received a letter.

halifax,3d5w0j,Canoo,7,Mon Jul 13 22:28:46 2015 UTC,$30 more for a 5 times faster connection. The upload is going to be substantially higher than Eastlink's too. I never used any cloud based storage services before I got FibreOp. Now I totally get it. 30M upload makes uploading stuff to your cloud storage super quick.

I'm probably not the average user. But since I have no cable and only use the internet for media consumption it's nice to have 1080p videos start instantly.
halifax,3d5w0j,jtothen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:52:03 2015 UTC,1080p on YouTube should have a max bitrate of like 10 Mbps give or take (and that's likely a bit generous) so you really shouldn't have any buffering issues on 20 down.

Yes, there are caps on standalone Internet and the Internet and phone bundle which sucks for cord cutters.   Bell (not Bell Aliant) had at one point a fair use clause that although they said unlimited it was roughly.... Wait for it.... 250 GB/mth (which is the same as Eastlink). At least Eastlink is upfront about it. Don't be surprised if that came into effect at some point down the road with the new CRTC ruling on pick and choose cable channels. Of more people become cord cutters both Eastlink and Bell will look to take advantage and manage bandwidth with increase costs / caps to make up for the decrease in cable subscribers.   EDIT: Down voting because I clarified when Eastlink has or doesn't have a cap? Or was it because I pointed out that both providers may increase cost / implement caps when the new CRTC regulations take effect? That's been documented quite often since the changes were announced and is not pro Bell or Eastlink."

halifax,3d5w0j,fadetowhite,2,Tue Jul 14 00:49:46 2015 UTC,Your upload is shit and you have to buy TV to be uncapped.   Overall a much worse deal than bell.
halifax,3d5w0j,JP4R,2,Tue Jul 14 01:48:16 2015 UTC,Not technically correct. You can pay like $35 for uncapped if 250GB is not sufficient. Also a high upload speed is insignificant to the average user as they are not doing cloud backup for large amounts of data or serving up large files for other users. If you are then Bell's service provides the best option but I don't believe that this benefits the average user let alone the majority.
halifax,3d5w0j,Bokrug,0,Tue Jul 14 02:01:01 2015 UTC,And that $35 makes it more than bell and wasn't an option when I left Eastlink.   Eastlink isnt even in the same ballpark. I don't get the mental gymnastics to justify it.
halifax,3d5w0j,Malarious,2,Tue Jul 14 11:38:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're trying to justify it, just clarifying that there are no caps in a bundle.   Many people get TV along with Internet, so they don't have a cap. And most people posting about FibreOp's advantages talk about no caps. So I think it's important to clarify that there aren't caps with Eastlink in a bundle.   That doesn't void any of the other downsides of Eastlink / pros of FibreOp or cause mental gymnastics."

halifax,3d5w0j,Rainbow-,2,Mon Jul 13 23:58:05 2015 UTC,Yeah you'd probably need a 802.11ac router and wireless card in your computer to take full advantage of that speed. The included wireless on those modem/router combo things is pretty shitty. I live in a 750 sqft condo and at the opposite end of my unit I don't even get full strength. My desktop is wired in though.
halifax,3d5w0j,Westify,9,Tue Jul 14 03:14:27 2015 UTC,"The major incentive of Fibre OP would be no data caps.  Eastlink has come under fire lately for their horrible 15gb rural data cap they've recently implemented.  While their 250gb city cap is fine for some people there's plenty of heavy users i know who would frequently go over that.  To factor the $35/month charge that Eastlink asks for unlimited is horrible value compared with Bell who honestly already beats them in price/speed before that comes into play.  I used to be all for Eastlink, but between the data caps, degrading of student plans and overall failure to offer competitive speeds with Bell there's really no reason to go with them for internet unless Fibre OP isn't available in your area."
halifax,3d5w0j,Rainbow-,4,Mon Jul 13 20:31:47 2015 UTC,The student plans with Eastlink don't have data caps.  And the base rate for residential customers also doesn't have a data cap.

I went to talk to someone in person and they changed it back right away, no hassle. I'm going to talk to someone today, but (I believe) you should be able to get out of the contract if you wanted.

Same internet package, but they jacked up the price - even past what it would normally be. So we argued the price, and told them that we hadn't received any notification of a change to our bill, like we were suppose to. They give us the student plan back, even though we're not students.   I expected to pay more once she graduated, but obviously not more than what the plan is listed as.   EDIT: Checked the plan names, fixed  EDIT 2: Just went down to the Eastlink building on Spring Garden. The guy told me that ""that's the student plan this year"" and that ""there's no way I had 100/10"" until I made him look at a past bill. He didn't speak perfect English so he was a little confusing, and was a little confused by me. Going to try calling customer service and try the Mic Mac store, I had luck there previously."

halifax,3d5w0j,scannalach,0,Tue Jul 14 00:09:48 2015 UTC,Oh so it's OK to set a ridiculously low bandwidth cap as long as there's no competition in the area?  Unless they're leasing the wifi from cell towers i see no good reason why it should be so low in 2015.
halifax,3d5w0j,hunkydorey_ca,2,Mon Jul 13 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"The service is only 46.95 monthly, with a maximum overage charge of $20 (which doesn't cut off your internet after you hit it). I looked into as I'm on Eastlink cable in a rural area and the news post I read seemed to indicate I'd have a super low cap and I was pissed. There is certainly competition in the areas it services, it's dial up or satellite internet. Satellite internet has a 5GB cap for their 44.95 pricing via Xplornet. Dial up is uncapped, but obviously extremely slow.  http://www.eastlink.ca/internet/internetoptions/otherinternetoptions.aspx  According to the sales rep I spoke to eastlink sets up Motorola Canopy towers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Canopy) for this service."

halifax,3d5w0j,hunkydorey_ca,2,Mon Jul 13 21:28:46 2015 UTC,Its worth it man and where your in an apartment building they will offer you a better deal if you can get the 40% they ask. Also about data caps and plans and stability I'll say this. I use 1.6tbs PLUS a month and have had no issues after replacing their Actiontec R1000H router with a Netgear R7000 router from staples. Its great I have 300/30 and half the time I get 350 download and sometimes I'll get 45 upload which is more then what I should have obviously. But make the switch and don't look back. Also the support at Bell Aliant is great and know what they are doing also the techs in the field are very well trained I should know as my friend who works for them installed my FibreOp and iv witnessed installs for many of my friends and seen the same quality that I got with my friend installing it.
halifax,3d5w0j,JP4R,2,Mon Jul 13 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, granted I live in Cape Breton it's the same speed offered in Halifax. Night and day difference to when I had East Link up there, or Seaside down here which is basically just our Cable Internet provider since East Link is more on the mainland."
halifax,3d5w0j,sonician,2,Mon Jul 13 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"I may not have the most popular opinion, but I regret switching.  I moved to my current apartment in February, and started with Eastlink. Shortly after the move, FibreOP became available. We jumped right on that train, but have regretted ever since. I'm not sure if it's the building fault or what. I can't get a decent connection in my bedroom from the living room (where the router is) and that is only about 40ft away. When I'm on my phone, I usually have to use my data because it's not able to connect to the internet. I've switched to Google DNS and it didn't make much of a difference. My boyfriend is going to call in the morning to see if there has been problems with the building, and if they're fixable. Otherwise, we may have to switch back.   If I were you, I'd check with other people in your area about the speeds, because I've had nothing but headaches since the switch."

With Eastlink, HD channels looked ok, but there was a lot of ""blocking"" in the image if there was a lot of motion on screen. Not the case with Bell."

Then a Bell offer came through my mailbox: try them for a year and get a free 42"" LCD TV. Well that's something tangible, plus they threw in free install and the first 6 months at a lower rate - and even the full price was slightly less than the same service with Eastlink. No brainer, right? Worth the try.  Well to my surprise, not only did I save a bunch of money and get a free TV, but the Internet is hands-down superior in every way. Massively faster download (I'm getting 132mbps even though they only advertise 100mbps), the upload speeds are vastly superior, and the reliability puts Eastlink to shame.  For me Bell has been so much better than I can't help but wonder how Eastlink managed to attract any customers at all. I'm sure there must be some cases where Eastlink is cheaper, but generally they are the same, even though Bell's service (FibreOp) simply blows Eastlink away. The only thing I miss about Eastlink is some of their local channels and the fact that I forever had their channel numbers memorized.  I hope Eastlink gets their shit together and can compete against FiberOp. IMO they presently don't have a chance unless they compete on price."

I work from home usually connecting to multiple remote desktops at a time without any hang ups or screen lag. I enjoy playing FPS games like BF4 on PC and I get similar pings to a friend I play with who is on FibreOP.   I'm only guessing here but I think we are mid-heavy users.

halifax,3d61ml,Arbys15,6,Mon Jul 13 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"For NSPI, being regulated, any capital expense (and possibly significant change in operational expenses) must be approved by the UARB. The limit is something like $500k before triggering a UARB hearing.  TL;dr mandate of UARB in evaluating proposals is ""good for customers (rates, reliability, safety, etc)"" and ""meets the legislated rate of return for the company (guaranteed profits)"". NS details are NS details, but this is common, globally, for ""regulated monopolies"".  Apparently it was better (given those two criteria) for NSPI to renovate a building for a new office.  Keep in mind two things:   One needs office space, and NSPI was otherwise renting space in Scotia Square. That site would have been worth less than nothing; its history in power generation going back 100+ years, once being a coal-gas production facility (i.e. it is an environmental disaster). $54 million over, say, 25 years at 5% is $94 million,... call it $4 mil/year, with maintenance. Based on a listed size of 18,000 m2 ,that is 193750 sqf, and about $21.65/sqf.... Which is below market rate for office space.   ~~~  The target users of the building across the road are for Emera employees and executives; Emera is not a regulated monopoly."
halifax,3d61ml,discowalrus,3,Mon Jul 13 23:24:44 2015 UTC,"This is all correct. It's also worth mentioning the UARB, in their ruling on the application to covert the power plant to office space, stated they saw the renovation as in the best interest of ratepayers compared to continuing to rent."
halifax,3d61ml,Arbys15,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"Ahh, ok, so that is to essentially approve the capital expense to count against revenue when determining the legislated rate of return."
halifax,3d61ml,discowalrus,2,Tue Jul 14 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"If $500k is the delta, good or bad if they change their budget by $500k, they need approval.  Buying cheaper coal would require approval. Demolishing an empty garage that will cost $501k to tear down and clean up (but will save $100k in heating/security a year) requires approval.  They don't just regulate things which are obviously bad; regulatory requests are not always about screwing ratepayers over."

halifax,3d61ml,bluenoser4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:36:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, then. That is the high end.  But more possible ""accounting trickery"" which changes my napkin analysis:    They could very well get better than 5% loans, if not pay for it out of general revenue; and its not all or nothing, $10, $20 mil in cash laying around would dramatically reduce cost-of-borrowing the remainder The principal part of a loan payment isn't an expense (it becomes an asset) A bunch of the $54 mill wouldn't have been ""build an office"" cost, but ""cleanup a shithole"". Cleaning up a shithole would have been necessary, regardless. NSP could very well be charging Emera rent, which gives cause for the good citizens of Bermuda or Bangor to be pissed, but if we are in conspiracy mode, is a net good conspiracy for the good people of Nova Scotia"
halifax,3d61ml,sc2caedus,-6,Tue Jul 14 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"""It will be an entirely Emera-funded project. Ratepayers in Nova Scotia will not be impacted,"" she said Monday.      I'm having a hard time actually believing this."
halifax,3d61ml,bluenoser4,5,Mon Jul 13 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"Well, accounting semantics. Or trickery, if you want to look at it that way.  NSPI, being a wholy owned subsuidary, already dumps its X% annual profits into Emera. X will not change.  But in any case, office workers need offices to work in. While it is generally true that if you aren't in the real estate business, you shouldn't be in the real estate business (that is, always rent offices), NSPI already is committed to owning a bazillion dollars worth of real estate, the delta effort on their on-staff real estate lawyers and facilities guys to manage a little office complex is (apparently) less then paying market rates for leased office space."

They change name every few years, their webdev ads have syntax errors for fucks sake..   You're almost better off just fucking around with photoshop for two years. You'll end up in marketing if you're taking graphic design.   Your first job will be entry level either way."
halifax,3d4i1o,p0psicle,14,Mon Jul 13 13:39:46 2015 UTC,"Coming from experience, while the BDES program at NSCAD is great - and you have a full on Bachelor's in design, which is always good on paper - the hiring environment in HRM/Nova Scotia GREATLY favours NSCC design grads over NSCAD. NSCC trains their students to be immediately job-ready after graduation. As far as I remember while attending NSCAD, you still had the option to do the vast majority of your work - yes, design work - without a computer. I know NSCAD grads who came out of their degree with a great appreciation for high-level, world-changing design theory but who couldn't tell you what a colour separation was or how colour modes work. Since entry-level design jobs are NEVER art direction or high-level creative thinking - they're usually production jobs like ad resizing or prepping files for print - you'll have a hard time finding an employer that is willing to look past any technical deficiencies. I've heard this from many sources, including workplaces that are associated with the arts community and NSCAD - so they are very hush-hush about it.  Experience: went to NSCAD for design, ended up switching to photography, then attended NSCC for the graphic design program, was SUPER impressed, found full-time salaried work within Halifax in under a year."

halifax,3d4i1o,Ceiling_Unlimited,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:17:46 2015 UTC,One thing that NSCC requires that (as far as I know) daVinci doesn't require is a portfolio of work... How can one be expected to have a portfolio of work if they have no experience in graphic design?   Will look into NSCAD.
halifax,3d4i1o,violetadventure,16,Mon Jul 13 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"How can one be expected to have a portfolio of work    Why are you going into graphic design if you've never drawn or created anything?   They're not looking for professional work, they're looking for something that shows you want it as a career not a job."
halifax,3d4i1o,Stryker88,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:07:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really draw.

halifax,3d4i1o,Stryker88,15,Mon Jul 13 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"""Sending your scribbles"" actually helps a lot when it comes to seeing how much you understand what you're doing and where you can improve. NSCAD actually has 'portfolio days' so you can bring in your work and get critiques from profs. It helps you to understand what the college requires from you and what sort of courses you might like to apply for. You WILL learn, but you have to show you at least have a grasp on understanding.  *edit...portfolios aren't meant to make your chances better to get in the program. They are meant to show the college what level you are art and where you can improve."

halifax,3d4i1o,RangerNS,3,Mon Jul 13 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but really almost all programs have some form of required prerequisites - I couldn't get into a science based program if I'd never taken high school sciences, even though the idea with applying would be that I want to learn now. But don't let that discourage you! It's easy to get frustrated with the ""hoops"" you're asked to jump, so to speak, and look for an easier way (ie this college that doesn't require a portfolio, but that may not provide you as solid a foundation for a future career as other schools).   If you decide on NSCC but can't get in because of the portfolio, maybe you could look at taking a couple of courses (there or elsewhere) individually, even part time, until you can build a beginning portfolio and then apply with that later. It's extra work and time, but personally, I'd highly recommend putting that in now and ensuring you get the best education and prospects available to you - it will be worth it in the long run."
halifax,3d4i1o,CuileannDhu,3,Mon Jul 13 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"I don't really draw.   Change that. You don't need formal instruction to take the first steps toward learning how to draw. All they are looking is evidence of effort and a drive towards learning what they teach. If you are unwilling to take a few hours out of the week to put a simple portfolio together, then you're going to have a hard time in the course at any school - let alone in the competitive job market."
halifax,3d4i1o,logic11,2,Mon Jul 13 16:31:44 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. I applied at NSCC back in Feb and didn't get the portfolio in by the deadline.

Instead, I think I will be going for something I love doing, which is recording arts. It's my money, my debt that I need to pay back, so I'm just going for it."

I would say focus as much as you can on typography and layout work in your portfolio, as this will help you stand out in the crowd (most submissions we saw were very illustration based).   Before you submit your portfolio I would recommend getting in touch with Rob Hansen or Crystal McManus. They run the design program and will give you more information on what they're looking for from you. Contact information should be available on the NSCC website, but if you can't find it PM me and I'll hook you up.   If you're worried that you're not up to snuff, I'm familiar with what Rob and Crystal look for, so you can send me your portfolio first and I'll give you some feedback. PM me, get a PDF done up and we can talk.   I'll mention that I've worked with some NSCAD instructors and alumni and the overall feeling is that NSCAD is no longer where they would like it to be in relation to teaching Design. It used to be run by oldschool German designers who were very strict but very good. These days it's still a fine school, but employers I've spoken with are hiring more NSCC students than NSCAD these days.   In fact, the CD at the company I'm working for right now agrees, and he's a NSCAD grad."

Seriously, I've heard that they make students sign something/promise to not speak ill of the school while they're enrolled. That should be enough of a red flag in and of itself, but there's more. The front entrance, where prospective students enter, is gorgeous and modern. The student entrance? Terrifying. And i've heard that this extends to the facilities themselves - outdated, stretched thin, with administration that refuses to spend money on upgrading.  I don't want to start too much shit-flinging, but do a google search on the above name. You'll also find a few threads on it in r/halifax - I don't comment much so you could use my comment/post history to find them, as I can never resist putting in a word or two on this institution.  Final verdict - you're always much, much MUCH better off avoiding for-profit institutions. NSCC is much cheaper, and in my experience with the waterfront campus, the program is great and the profs have lots of industry connections which is honestly the #1 reason why I went.  I could go on and on, but I'll stop now. If you have any questions about NSCC, NSCAD, ( i've graduated from both) or the hiring market for entry-level creatives in the city, give me a PM.

It's absolutely a plus to be able to draw/paint/illustrate/render, but a lot of my classmates were creative while lacking the ability to draw - hell, my Art Director can't draw! A lot of the graphic/visual stuff is freelanced out or purchased as stock in the real world, as investing your designers' time into illustrating as well is often much more expensive than outsourcing."
halifax,3d4i1o,logic11,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I was just kind of settling for graphic design partially to get parents off my back about continuing education, now 3 years after graduating high school, and also because it seems like there's a bit of demand for graphic designers (even freelance). Also, I applied for GD in Feb and missed the deadline to hand in the portfolio, so that says enough enough my enthusiasm for that course.   So, in the end, I think I have decided to go with something that I already have some experience in, and that's recording arts, regardless of what people say.

halifax,3d4612,jlmacdonald,15,Mon Jul 13 11:20:33 2015 UTC,"He's incredibly rude.   Does it matter then? I don't care what I am selling or how much it is for. if the person is rude, or unpleasant, I simply do not deal with them. I am here to sell stuff and make a buck, but I refuse to put up with peoples bad days on Kijiji. I am not someones free therapist."
halifax,3d4612,consequencegamer,3,Mon Jul 13 11:46:52 2015 UTC,Yep. That's pretty much where I'm at now with this guy.
halifax,3d4612,haligonianer,21,Mon Jul 13 12:01:28 2015 UTC,Ask if he'll consider trading for a gently used Dodge Neon...
halifax,3d4612,gingerhonkybites,17,Mon Jul 13 11:38:54 2015 UTC,It's worth at least 2.
halifax,3d4612,shelburne,8,Mon Jul 13 11:46:21 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to a friend of mine. It is a scam 100%. I can't remember how it works but there is no money.  My friend had a good bit of fun with them and said her ford focus was worth $56,000 and that it might be haunted."

halifax,3d4612,Malodrik,4,Mon Jul 13 15:16:49 2015 UTC,"If you don't trust the sketchy kijiji contact, don't sell."
halifax,3d4612,cinosa,5,Mon Jul 13 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"To me it seems fishy as well, I'd say reiterate your terms to him. If he can't deal with it, find someone else.  Never do e-transfers for anything kijiji related, always upfront, cash in hand. Always meet with the seller, never a proxy (depending on the item, obviously). If they offer you less than the agreed upon amount, walk away."
halifax,3d4612,DONOTGIVEAFUCK,9,Mon Jul 13 11:28:12 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with e-transfers. I've bought several vehicles using e-transfers, I just send them while I'm there looking at the vehicle and never leave until they accept them (only takes 30 minutes for me).  I'd rather not carry several thousand dollars in cash, when almost everyone has a smart phone and internet access. That's just asking to get robbed."
halifax,3d4612,DONOTGIVEAFUCK,7,Mon Jul 13 11:46:59 2015 UTC,"eTransfers are 100% the way to go. You can send the money to them as soon as you want (or receive it), and the person can see it was sent and ready in the email notification. If both parties are satisfied then just tell them the password. If anything it makes it harder to get away with a scam. Anyone who thinks it's sketchy is just behind in the times."
halifax,3d4612,haligonianer,8,Mon Jul 13 12:16:09 2015 UTC,Its more the complete refusal to meet in person that freaked me out.
halifax,3d4612,Malodrik,4,Mon Jul 13 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure. No argument there, that's shady as shit"
halifax,3d4612,gasfarmer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"That's the scam part. I was going to say when I sold my car I met the guy at my bank and we did the etransfer right there in person direct to my account. Super legit, safer than cash or cheque. But if he won't meet in person there is no way I'd sell him anything."
halifax,3d4612,Malodrik,3,Mon Jul 13 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it, that's all.  I prefer cash if I'm buying something over kijiji."
halifax,3d4612,Spatula000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:50:26 2015 UTC,"If they offer you less than the agreed upon amount, walk away.   Eh, I don't think that quite applies to cars.   You can spot lots of things that can eat into the price while looking at it."
halifax,3d4612,CatchHerInTheEye,2,Mon Jul 13 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"I've never dealt with a car before, I should've clarified.  Those are my general rules when using kijiji"
halifax,3d4612,CatchHerInTheEye,2,Mon Jul 13 16:46:54 2015 UTC,That guy is fairly well known actually he buys a pile of cars.
halifax,3d4612,akaliant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:29:49 2015 UTC,I think there are a few of them. He'd do more business if he was up front about his practices. But then it would sound like a long scammy story too.
halifax,3d4612,Blitzman123,2,Wed Jul 15 16:17:06 2015 UTC,Yep. 100 percent a scam. Stay away from this guy.
halifax,3d4612,Trendiggity,2,Mon Jul 13 14:27:53 2015 UTC,Have you had dealings with him?
halifax,3d4612,RandomCDN,3,Mon Jul 13 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"Nope. I haven't dealt with him before, but I have heard of these guys before. Some giveaways that it is a scam is that:   1) He is calling from a Manitoba number and claims to be buying the car for someone else. That is usually a warning sign when dealing with scam artists.  2) He doesn't care how much you want for the car...he just wants it. Most likely doesn't care about the price because its a scam.   3) He hasn't came to inspect the car. And doesn't want to show his face, i.e sending a tow truck driver.  4) And this is the most sketchy aspect, he wants to do an e-transfer. It'll most likely be a fraudulent transfer where you'll see the money for a bit, the bank realizes that it was fraudulent and removes the money from your account leaving you without a car, and the cash. For me, that is a dead giveaway that this guy is up to no good."
halifax,3d4612,Musekal,2,Mon Jul 13 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"I usually don't lust a phone number, just so I can pre-screen the people I don't want to deal with. Usually I can get a feel for how its going to go based in their message - then I can just ignore them if needed  edit: a word"
halifax,3d4612,jibjibman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:58 2015 UTC,"Don't matter who shows up with the cash or what their problem is. My rules for any Kijiji sales are simple. No holds, first person to show up and put the cash in my hand, signs the documents. DONE!  Simple as that. When someone calls me I tell them the truth if I have multiple people interested or not and that it is first come first serve, cash in hand!"
halifax,3d4612,Golfandrun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Sketchy as it is, if the tow truck guy shows up with cash (and it's not counterfeit) then the deal is done, as far as I'm concerned.   Maybe meeting him somewhere public (if the car is running) isn't a bad idea, so the sketchy tow truck driver doesn't know where you live..."
halifax,3d4612,AJGrayTay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:49:11 2015 UTC,So while this does sound like a scam because you never meet the buyer in person does anyone know how this would play out?  does the tow truck show up with no cash? does he ask for too much personal information for the E-transfer?

The cuts this government has made (without really looking into what they're doing) has affected a lot of people I know and I cannot wait to vote them out of existence.
