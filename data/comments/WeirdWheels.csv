Why did you chose that design for the ""forks"" instead of singular tubes?   Looks mostly.  I wanted to echo the shape of the Britten v1000 fork.  Bottpower did something similar, as does the new Bultaco's electric motorcycle..  Big triangles are good for making stiff parts, and I'm not an engineer, so I'm making everything big and stiff.   Edit: I just saw the shock linkage up front...you have to explain this design.   Its a linkage shock, just like the rear on a sports bike (came from a GSXR1000).  Pivot arm mounts to frame below engine, shock mounts to the end of pivot arm on bottom and frame on top, rods from linkage to lower A arm pull up on pivot arm and compress shock.   Also, if it's a Seca, where are you going to run the exhaust without heating your shock up?   Apparently shocks can take a fair bit of heat (have confirmed in various sources).  Claude Fior used essentially the same design for a 24 hour racer based on an XS1100 but maybe kept the shock cooler by virtue of never getting stuck at a stop light.  I'll be using pipe wrap; this will be one case where it's actually there for heat control, not purely aesthetic."

WeirdWheels,3bjgvb,DeadZeplin,3,Tue Jun 30 01:54:43 2015 UTC,I liked the look of those Pulsars back in the day. I only saw one that had the optional hatch though.
WeirdWheels,3bjgvb,SpartanMonkey,14,Tue Jun 30 03:41:54 2015 UTC,"I had one of these about 20 years ago.   In addition to being able to swap hatches, the was designed to be totally street legal with no hatch. There is a CHMSL that hangs down from the headliner in front of the hatch and each hatch had it's own CHMSL that would override the interior one when a hatch was closed.  The tool kit for removing/swapping the hatch was a single 14mm wrench. It was like a double ended box wrench that was not machined on one end. Like just a little metal disk. Odd.  The normal hatch (more sedan like than fastback) made the hatch area almost useless. There was a false floor above the spare tire that had enough room to store the t-tops above the spare and under the false floor. But that didn't leave enough height.above the false floor for a full paper grocery bag.  Also, both hatches were heavy as fuck. I would estimate at least 75lbs for the sedan style hatch and well over 100lbs for the Sportbak. So it wasn't something you'd just pop off on a whim.  The whole car was pretty heavy. Mine was a Pulsar NX SE that came with a CA18DE - dohc 1.8. But a 1.6 CRX or a 1.6 Miata would utterly embarass the car in a drag race to 30mph.  The base models had a smaller, less.sophisticated engine from a basemodel Sentra. I cannot imagine how gutless that one must have been. I imagine that Pulsar probably weighs a few hundred pounds more than a full dressed Sentra sedan.  I still loved the car. I'd pick up another one in a heartbeat. But they were far from perfectly executed. Reliable. Fun. Economical. But the sportiness was only skin deep and the swappable hatches was a gimmick. The wagon hatch should have been default because the sedan hatch killed the utility factor of the car, and once you and a couple of friends swapped the hatch, you'd have trouble getting volunteers to swap it back. I imagine more than a few people broke their fingers or dropped their hatches in the process."
WeirdWheels,3bjgvb,karmavorous,4,Tue Jun 30 05:07:45 2015 UTC,It seems like the canopy was a feature that probably could have had a little more engineering. Did it leak much in the rain?

WeirdWheels,3bjgvb,hovercraft_mechanic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always thought the sportbak needed a second hatch. There's a body line that runs vertically around the rear of the sportbak. It needed to open there rather than the whole thing lifting open... It was just too much weight for the struts to hold up. Even with the car just being 6 years old, the hatch came down on my head too many times.  Otherwise with the hatch closed, it was pretty much like any other breadvan style hatchback. Nothing leaked on mine. Neither the hatches or the T-tops, but I've heard other owner complain about t-top leaks."

But it was impossible at that time to find any info on how to do that swap. The only EXA forum at that time was in Australia, and the people doing swap there would just buy a wrecked Pulsar GTi (not NX, looks more like a Sentra) and they'd have all the parts right there to complete the swap.  Just ordering the engine the way I did, I didn't get a full harness or an ECU and once the engine arrived I started seeing a lot of things that were different. So I sold the engine to someone else."

WeirdWheels,3b8jeq,nill0c,5,Sat Jun 27 02:24:41 2015 UTC,Evidently Citroen made quite a few transporter DS cars.

Many American car makers used the same exact paint though it performed differently on plastic and metal, which led to a difference in appearance. Some manufacturers adjusted the paint color to compensate, which wasn't entirely perfect, but it was better. It wasn't until the '80s and' 90s (and even now) that paint technology for use on plastic has improved to the point where it can look identical on plastic, fiberglass, metal, etc."

WeirdWheels,39ws6g,8bitaficionado,13,Mon Jun 15 13:04:42 2015 UTC,"1960   1959 is the greatest cadillac ever made and i was really scared they might have ruined one for this, but its either from a 1960 or all custom."
WeirdWheels,39ws6g,showmeyourfartbox,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"1959's are, in my opinion, gaudy and hard to drive. I had a pair of 1960 Cadillac hearses which are mechanically the same, same dashboard, engine, drivetrain, etc, and they are indeed a nice driving car for such a huge heavy machine, but those giant fins are actually a massive blindspot. The 60 was bad enough but I know why the fins went away, they were horrible to see around.   It always looked to me like 1960 should have came first, the style is there but it's more subtle. The larger fins and huge ugly front bumper should have come after the smaller more sedate version the 60 had.   I think this thing would actually have been more outlandish as a 59. It's already over the top, the massive fins would have been better suited to its overall theme. It's not all that hard to find a 59 4 door, they made a lot of them."
WeirdWheels,39ws6g,showmeyourfartbox,2,Mon Jun 15 15:39:08 2015 UTC,Ive never had the pleasure of driving a 59. Hope to some day. Maybe a 2 door coupe.  I agree the 1960 seems before the 59. the 58 to 59 jump is odd.
WeirdWheels,39ws6g,gtr427,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:56:58 2015 UTC,They're a pretty floaty car in stock suspension. Bout the only thing I've owned that drove like it was my 69 galaxie 500 wagon. Probably about the same weight. I liked the thing quite a bit. Was sad to sell the two I had but at least one ended up in Hotrod Magazine after I sold it so that was kinda cool.

The 2003 and 2004 models used General Motors' Vortec 5300 engine, a 5.3 L 300 hp V8. Performance was 7.7 s to 60 mph (97 km/h) with a 15.9 s/86.4 mph quarter mile run. The 2005 SSR used the 390 hp (291 kW) LS2 V8 also found in the C6 Corvette and Pontiac GTO, and also offered a manual transmission (the six-speed Tremec) for the first time, as an option. For the 2006 model year, the LS2 engine featured minor modifications that boosted its output to 395 hp (automatic transmission) and 400 hp (manual transmission), respectively. In addition, GM badges were added to the vehicle.    Image i     Relevant: GMT360 | Lansing Craft Centre   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

In addition, the Viper V10 was installed in the Dodge Ram SRT-10, earning the truck the Guinness World Record for fastest production truck (later bettered by an Australian production car; the Holden HSV Maloo that uses the LS2 Corvette engine). The Dodge Tomahawk concept vehicle also uses this engine.  The V10 was also sold to British luxury car manufacturer Bristol Cars: the Bristol Fighter was powered by a modified version of the engine which produced 525 hp (391 kW), increasing to 550 hp (410 kW) at high speed due to the ram air effect.  In the more powerful Fighter S the engine was tuned to give 628 hp (660 hp at high speed). In the Fighter T, the V10 was further modified and turbocharged to produce 1,000 hp (755 kW) bhp at 5600 rpm, almost as the advertised 1,001 hp of the Bugatti Veyron.

WeirdWheels,390t4g,graneflatsis,3,Mon Jun 8 12:33:19 2015 UTC,"From Audi:  ""Dr. Rudolf Slaby built a small electrically propelled car for his personal use in 1919. The design aroused such interest that he decided, together with Hermann Beringer, to establish a company and begin volume production of the car.  An initial order for 100 cars was received from the Berlin-based company owned by Jörgen Skafte Rasmussen, the Zschopau industrialist and founder of the DKW company. Difficulties with companies supplying components and signs that inflation was about to devalue the currency made Rasmussen anxious that his high deposit payment could become worthless. He therefore decided to take a one-third interest in the car's manufacturer, SB–Automobilgesellschaft m.b.H.  257 single-seat electric cars were built in the first business year, from November 1, 1919 to October 31, 1920. Of these, Rasmussen took 64; the remaining 36 from his original order for 100 cars were repurchased by SB-Automobilgesellschaft. 80 of the cars were equipped with Levy motors; thereafter the SB-Automobilgesellschaft began to produce its own electric motors.  The electric car was initially equipped with a 12-cell, 24-Volt battery. From 1921 on, an order from Japan made it necessary to offer the car with a battery of larger capacity. The number of cells was therefore increased to 18. In addition to the 200 cars intended for Japan, which were paid for in ""hard"" currency by a London bank, the company sold a further 137 electrically powered single-seat cars and 77 sidecars with increased battery capacity on the domestic market.  Follow-up orders from Japan were as much as the manufacturer could handle. Midway through 1923, however, inflation reached such a level in the German Reich that deposit payments from foreign accounts were blocked. In July 1923 the company had no choice but to temporarily stop manufacturing the single-and two-seat versions of the electric car, despite ample stocks in hand and a full order book.  When a fresh start was made in the fall of 1923, the electric car was joined by an SB car with a DKW motorcycle engine.""

Their intention was to be able to handle logistics needs without being dependent on local road or rail systems, allowing them to operate in back-country areas. The US Army had three experimental units built, the largest reaching almost 600 feet (183 m) long, which holds the record for the longest offroad vehicle. Road trains are in use in certain roles today, but the US Army examples and a few derivatives appear to be the only offroad examples built.

The idea was to decrease the size and aerodynamic drag of the typical truck. This skatelike vehicle proved unpopular with drivers and suffered from handling problems, testing was stopped after 3000km.  Introduced at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show as the Supercargo 2040, it uses a Mercedes chassis, a 400hp Daimler-Benz engine, independent air suspension, limited slip diferential, anti-lock brakes, and climate control.  The story goes that it was turned into a TV car for the 1988 series ""The Highwaymen"". However it seems considerably smaller than the TV car. Another rumor says that it survives intact somewhere.

WeirdWheels,37zumt,bragis,3,Mon Jun 1 12:52:20 2015 UTC,The biggest improvement would be extra load space within the length limit for trucks.

Guys get off on us arguing if it works or not.  But look where it is.  In the middle of a lane.  Guy looking over his shoulder, it has a brake handle.  From this pic nobody can say if it does or doesn't run."

WeirdWheels,37kdr5,SpeciousArguments,-9,Tue Jun 9 08:34:23 2015 UTC,Yes that looks like it.  But like I said I wasn't sure at all.   Also like I said it could be done.
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,mynameisalso,4,Thu May 28 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"Yes.  If the V8 isn't real (it isn't), there is space inside.  That makes the internal space of this vehicle almost 100% larger."

WeirdWheels,37kdr5,DarkhorseV,-5,Thu May 28 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"It'd take more than 1-3 minutes and you have no idea the length people will go through to fool others.

WeirdWheels,37kdr5,mynameisalso,7,Thu May 28 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"It'd take more than 1-3 minutes    To discolor headers at a 90 degree bend RIGHT out of the head?  No, it wouldn't.  To go blue it might take 5-10, but headers discolor in no time at all.  They would start to melt the body about the time the starter disengaged.   I have seen people hide spark plug wires, fuel tanks, mags, brakes, even chains on motorcycles. Nobody can say anything for certain on this photo. Anyone who claims they can is full of shit.   All of those things are small components.  Hiding a transmission and hiding plug wires aren't exactly similar.    This could absolutely drive for 10-15 minutes. I blew a fan belt and made it 10 miles on a cold engine in a full sized pickup.    I don't think anyone disagreed that an engine can run for a short time without water.  Why are you so consumed with this fact?  Yes, it's possible, no, it's not realistic or practical for this application.   ...you have no idea the length people will go through to fool others.   Have you pondered that in this situation you may be the victim of this, rather than the enlightened one?"
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,DarkhorseV,-1,Thu May 28 16:17:11 2015 UTC,Practical? Practical!  Nothing about it is practical.  If he runs rich and for only a few minutes it will not blue.   Even my Toomey t5 pipes have instructions for show quads to prevent blueing.  I can easily find pics of show cars with pipes that aren't blue.  They can be ceramic coated on the inside.  It is called jet coat.  A minute after shutting the motor down you can touch the headers.  They never blue.   Tons of options.  Also he isn't going to be running 5k rpm with this.  Just putting around.  Jet coat would totally stop blueing.
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,mynameisalso,4,Thu May 28 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"Dude, I just upvoted you solely for your conviction.  It takes a special person to deny all the facts being thrown in his face and soldier on like that.  Have you considered a political career?"

WeirdWheels,37kdr5,mynameisalso,3,Fri May 29 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"Practical? Practical! Nothing about it is practical.    Yes, and only being able to run for a few minutes would make it all useless.   They can be ceramic coated on the inside. It is called jet coat. A minute after shutting the motor down you can touch the headers. They never blue.   I'm very familiar with ceramic coating headers (inside and out), that's what we always ran on our pavement cars.  I would LOVE to see you grab a hold of a set of headers a minute after shutting the engine off.  My wrists still have burn marks from cleaning injectors or checking plugs well after coming in off the track.  Would Jet coat keep fiberglass, paint, or plastic from melting up against headers as shown in the picture?  Also, ceramic coated headers can do a good chrome impression, but they're easy to tell from actual stainless or chrome.  The show cars (and bikes) you see usually polish the discoloring away, so I don't doubt you can find pictures of that."
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,DarkhorseV,-2,Thu May 28 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"This is a fake engine.  It was linked. This wouldn't be impossible to do though.  I said from the beginning I don't know for sure.  Buth this picture is from biker build off.  They have to drive a few hundred miles before the show http://i.imgur.com/nVQO1tw.png  My Toomey t5 pipes had instructions to stop bluing basically said to over jet to keep get the egt down.  Another way is dual layer pipes.  Have a pipe within a pipe.  Again I said you can't be sure and said I can't be sure it's just one photo. But it is a fake engine from a grill.   However the difference between this and a v8 barstool are small.   I also said this about a dozen times.  Derby cars run for twenty minutes with no radiator.  I made it ten miles on a cold day when I blew a fan belt.  If this was real it could easily get across the pits before getting warm.    I conceded many post ago that no cooling system would be an issue, but only for long drives."

But the tank hanging off the front means its gas powered.   after zooming in , you can look inside the window and see a red top in the back. It COULD be one of the red top batteries, but youd need 3 or 4 to run the electric motor, id wager its a briggs and stratton motor."
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,The0bviousNinja,2,Thu May 28 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"That could be.  I'm guessing the block is one of those plastic mock-up blocks that could easily be modified and hollowed out, idk, still looks cramped for space though.  Someone else suggested it was a grille, but judging by the beefy hand brake, I'd say it's powered one way or another."
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,DarkhorseV,3,Thu May 28 15:26:46 2015 UTC,Oh it definitely is powered. I've seen similar carts at car shows. Think barstool carts
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,The0bviousNinja,0,Thu May 28 15:48:14 2015 UTC,I think it has a 4 stroke mower motor running it. I seem to remember seeing a car show on TV with something similar running around sounding like a lawn mower.

WeirdWheels,37kdr5,majoroutage,-5,Thu May 28 15:30:31 2015 UTC,Chain drive hard angle. Don't downvote for this stuff
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,mynameisalso,1 point,Thu May 28 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"Start with the very basic. The plug leads aren't connected to anything on the block. There is no water pump and no provision for one, as the timing cover sits where one would partially go. The exhaust is touching directly onto fibreglass, it would burn through it in a second and there is no scorch marks on it. Then the common sense stuff, like, a chev weighs probably 300lbs or more, it would crush a frame like this, there no cooling at all on the engine, no fuel lines or linkages connected, plus obvious stuff like firstly, no gaskets are visible on the exhaust, because it's a one piece mould, the same as you can't see a gap between head and block, and a small block would make, as a minimum 200hp. It would snap the thing in half, as well as destroy any drivetrain it was connected to on that scale, and all it would do would be fry those tyres. It is absolutely, 100% a fake, non running fibreglass replica with a BBQ inside."
WeirdWheels,37kdr5,TheStig30,0,Fri May 29 12:27:17 2015 UTC,"let it go. I said a dozen times it is fake.  But it does have fuel lines.  You couldn't see the mini distributer if it had one, it doesn't need cooling like dragsters and demo cars with little weight you can go a few miles before the block gets hot.  Jet coat inside the exhaust or double layer exhaust like used on many show bikes would let exhaust touch fiberglass.  It is fake but it is also possible to build something that looks just like this.  The hoss v8 barstool is a good example of this.   One of my first post said no cooling would make this extremely limited.  But no so limited that it couldn't be driven across the pits."

WeirdWheels,37kdr5,fericyde,4,Thu May 28 18:20:18 2015 UTC,It can run for an entire five minutes before over heating.   On a serious note an old timer I know would run ford 351 engines in demo derbies.  They used a closed loop like this.  They figured radiators always popped.  Each engine would go for many derbies.  So they must be somewhat right.   They just ran a bigger loop.

I don't know why you think those things are missing   Funny you should bring that up - I raced Sprint Cars and Supermodifieds for about 7 years, and most people aren't familiar with them, or don't realize those components are absent.  Sprint Cars are direct drive though, and therefore need to be push started.  Push starting this scooter wouldn't be an option for multiple reasons though, and on top of that, this application would be useless if you couldn't stop with the engine running.  On top of THAT, you would need brakes that could overcome the power of an idling (at least) V8, which the hand lever couldn't do.  There are many more conflicts in the clutch/trans/rear end department, but I'll stop here.  Also, while sprint cars have tiny oil pans (as would be needed to make room for the steering here), they have a dry sump oil pump and an external reservoir.  Both are absent on this scooter.   Edit accidentally included fuel pump. They have fuel pumps. But I can't see if this thing does or doesn't. I don't know why you think it doesn't   I know it doesn't have a fuel pump because I can see that it doesn't have a mechanical pump on the engine, and there's no battery to run an electric fuel pump.  Another hint is that the ""carburetors"" have no fuel lines running to them.  If you need further proof, there are no ignition components aside from plugs and wires.  No distributor, coil, or (again) battery.  Now, you could skip the battery with a magneto, but there isn't one of those in the picture either.   Here is a link to v8 barstool very similar although this has a radiator. I just want you to see how compact the components can be   This isn't that similar.  It has all of the debated components from above included.  I am impressed with the compactness of the transmission - I'm guessing some kind of hydrostat?  Regardless, there is still nowhere near the room on the tri-five scooter as the V8 Barstool has for whatever method of power conversion they're using.  Edit:  Also, harmonic balancer.  There isn't one.  And the headers would melt the body (and the guy's shoes).  In short, I can tell it's not real by looking at it."

WeirdWheels,37cm1f,kippen,2,Tue May 26 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"With the Toronado's transaxle and front wheel drive, 2 complete drivetrains can be installed and run. The idea was to run one motor or the other or both at times. Here's another look at the Grant Olds. Here's the wiki on the later Hurst version."
WeirdWheels,37cm1f,graneflatsis,2,Tue May 26 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"Hurst Hairy Olds:       Hurst Hairy Olds is the name given to a pair of exhibition funny cars campaigned by Hurst Performance in 1966 and 1967.  Developed with help from General Motors engineer John Beltz, the Hurst Hairy Olds was built to be a showcase for the then-new chain-driven automatic transaxle of the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado as well as a rival to the Hurst Hemi Under Glass. There were doubts in the automotive press as to the strength of such a system; the Hairy Olds was designed to dispel these doubts.  The car debuted at a meet in Bakersfield, California on March 4, 1966. Driven by Joe Schubeck, the Hurst Hairy Olds began as a fully trimmed and later upholstered Oldsmobile 442 in body in white (BIW) form. Hurst installed not one but two 425 in³ (7 L) Oldsmobile engines and Toronado transaxles both front and rear; a pair of drag parachutes were mounted in the stock taillight positions and four-wheel disc brakes were fitted as well. Two engines meant two of virtually everything in the cockpit related to the operation of the car, including two cable-operated shifters, two tachometers, two sets of oil pressure and temperature gauges and even two accelerator pedals. Additional power was provided via a Cragar Equipment-modified 6-71 GMC supercharger atop each engine, each burning a blend of nitromethane and alcohol. Weight was reduced through the use of aluminum body components and Plexiglas windows. The result was a 2400-horsepower, four-wheel-drive exhibition drag racer which smoked its front and rear tires down the length of the race track with times in the eleven-second range.

The TE trim, standing for Top Executive, is essentially a limo. The TE trims were built in Sweden during the Cold War era and primarily sold to dignitaries in East Germany who didn't want to buy an executive car from the car manufacturers in West Germany. It hasn't been driven in ~5 years, and the factory motor is currently out of the car (needs a rebuild), but for a 30 year old car it is in great shape. It had a thick coating of dust on the exterior, which I cleaned off to take these pictures. The interior is in even better shape. When they bought it from a Volvo dealership that was closing down in CA back in 2001, they were also given a large roll of the OEM interior checkered carpeting material used on the assembly line for this car. This material was used to professionally redo the door cards, keeping it 100% OEM. It also has tons of extra random parts that they bought up from the Volvo dealership out in CA when they purchased the car. The car is 1 of ~300 Volvo 264 TEs produced, and probably 1 of something like 3 to 10 known to exist in the US today.""  It's not always the appearance that makes a car worthy of being here.

GM's first entry into that prestige niche, the Riviera was highly praised by automotive journalists upon its high-profile debut. While early models stayed close to the original form, subsequent generations varied substantially over the Riviera's thirty-year lifespan. In all, 1,127,261 were produced.  Unlike its contemporary GM E platform stablemates, the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado, the Riviera was only front wheel drive from 1979 to 1999.

Sixth generation (1967–1970) of article  Cadillac Eldorado:       The Eldorado was radically redesigned in 1967 to capitalize on the burgeoning era's personal luxury car market. Promoted as a ""personal"" Cadillac, it shared the E-body with the second-generation Buick Riviera and the Oldsmobile Toronado, which had been introduced the previous year. To enhance its distinctiveness, Cadillac adopted the Toronado's front-wheel drive Unified Powerplant Package, adapted to a standard Cadillac 429 V8 coupled to a Turbo-Hydramatic 425 automatic transmission. Based on the Turbo-Hydramatic 400, the THM425 placed the torque converter next to the planetary gearbox, which it drove through a metal chain. Disc brakes were optional, and new standard safety equipment included an energy absorbing steering column and generously padded instrument panel.  The Unified Powerplant Package was later shared with the GMC Motorhome starting in 1972.

It was the only complete motorhome built by a major auto/truck manufacturer producing what GMC hoped would be their ""halo"" vehicle. Part of the reason this vehicle is so different from other motor homes of the era is that it was not conceived as just a ""camper,"" but as a vehicle for comfortable travel as well. The design was radical for the day with front-wheel drive and a low profile, fully integrated body. At the time (as now), motorhomes were built by recreational vehicle manufacturers on bare frames and drivetrains supplied by a chassis manufacturer. GMC built the bodies and in most cases the interiors in-house, and designed the chassis and drivetrain to create a motorhome enclosure that could be adapted to a range of purposes. Empty shells were supplied to other RV manufacturers for upfitting the interiors and also to specialty manufacturers for a range of custom purposes ranging from mail delivery and mobile training facilities to people movers and ambulances. It was built in 23-and-26-foot (7.0 and 7.9 m) lengths.

WeirdWheels,366kia,YouMustChill,6,Sun May 17 03:43:46 2015 UTC,"Listing: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Volkswagen-Bus-Vanagon-Deluxe-Trim-/331445486850  Description:  ""For sale is the world’s only 1965 Volkswagen stretch microbus . . . with 33-windows and a ragtop sunroof.  This bus was built by a VW-only restoration shop in Southern California for use as a limousine on the island of Maui, Hawaii.  It can hold up to 12 passengers.  This one-of-a-kind masterpiece took two years to complete, and was finished less than three months ago.  It has approximately 1600 miles on the odometer.  It runs and drives perfectly…tracks down the road straight as an arrow.  And, best of all, this listing includes ownership of the fully-licensed limousine company that owns the bus, including State of Hawaii Public Utilities Commission licensing, company website, company logo, company telephone numbers, and embroidered Tommy Bahama drivers uniforms.  The company (Endless Summer Limousine) is a turn-key operation that is garnering a ton of interest in its first two months of operation, and already has bookings well into 2015.  In case you did not know, Maui is the number one destination wedding spot in the world, with over 7,000 weddings every year.  With its unique niche in the marketplace, this company has limitless potential.  Although it is a very difficult decision, sudden personal family issues are necessitating my relocation to the mainland and the sale of the company.     As stated, this stretch microbus was professionally built by a VW-only restoration shop in Southern California.  No expense was spared during its two-year rotisserie restoration.  Every single nut, bolt, and part is new...I mean absolutely everything.  And, the parts are not swap meet Chinese junk.  Only the highest quality parts that money could buy were used to build this vehicle (Wolfsburg West, Wolfgang International, Aircooled Accessories, etc.).   This bus is 100% rust-free, and the paint and body are incredible.  The PPG paint was sprayed in original colors from a 1957 Chevy...tropical turquoise and India ivory.  The entire bus, including the interior, frame, undercarriage, wheel wells, inside and bottom of doors, etc. was coated with POR15, a rust preventative.  I had anticipated it would spend its life in Maui, so every precaution was taken to prevent rust from ever forming on this beauty.  Wherever you live, rest assured this vehicle will remain in pristine condition despite the weather (or salt on the roads).    The bus was also covered throughout the interior with Fatmat sound deadening material…no excessive road noise to bother the passengers (or the driver).  The Fatmat also makes the high-end stereo system sound impeccable (Alpine head unit, Alpine amp, 6 JBL speakers).    The bus is powered by a VW 2074cc engine that is a bullet-proof torque monster, with dual port, single carburetor, and custom modified venture.  As part of the PUC licensing, the bus had to be weighed…it came in at just under 3900 lbs.  The custom engine moves this bus very effectively, even with a load of 12 passengers.  The bus was driven from San Diego to the port of Long Beach at 65mph and it had some pedal left (top speed here in Maui is only 55mph).  Here is a non-inclusive list of high-end parts:  Front Safari windows – stainless steel (from Wolfgang International) Rear Safari window – stainless steel (from Wolfgang International)  14 Side Pop-Out windows with Large Spoon Latches – chrome (from California Import Parts)  Chrome front door window frames (chrome-plated at California Plating in San Diego, CA) Polished deluxe trim on beltline and bumpers with black rubber inserts (from Aircooled Accessories in the UK) Front disc brakes (conversion from VW bay window bus so parts are readily available) Gene Berg performance shifter with reverse lock-out (added feature as a theft-deterrent)  LED headlights (from Truck-Lite) LED custom tail lights (fabricated to fit inside OEM housings)  LED third-brake lights/directional signals mounted in rear window Vintage Speed exhaust system Blaze-Cut automatic fire suppression system Viper alarm with custom sensors and remote notification Ultima Red Top battery (to run the bus) and Ultima Yellow Top battery (to run the electronics) RGBW LED light strips running the entire length of the interior of the bus on both sides (can be changed to ANY color)  Custom wood flooring and wood interior  American-style bumpers (powdercoated RAL9016 traffic white) 15"" VW original crows foot rims (powdercoated RAL9016 traffic white) Good-Year Custom Super Cushion 2-3/4"" whitewalls (205/75R15) German-quality VW stainless steel hubcaps Custom 17"" wood steering wheel  Restored speedometer Custom 2-tone brown interior with white piping and hidden pleats  Chrome door pull handles Chrome interior grab handle Chrome drink holder in front cab  Stainless steel drink holders in passenger area All new rubber and glass throughout entire vehicle  LCD screen with reverse back-up camera in license plate  Back up siren (120db)  Reverse back-up lights from 1960’s VW beetle mounted to rear bumper  Custom gauges (oil temp, cylinder head temp, and oil pressure) Gerson metal (green metal) used for all rust repairs  The list literally goes on and on and on...in all honesty, the only thing missing is a VW bus clock in the front cab…I have not found one in good enough condition to warrant installing it in this masterpiece.  Every single part on this vehicle is brand new, from engine lid hinges to wiring harness to complete brake system to mirrors and everything in between.  The engine, transmission, and gear reduction boxes were all completely disassembled and rebuilt using only new parts.  If you are a serious buyer, please contact me and I can send you a link to over 600 pictures of the build.  I also welcome any inspection and test drive.   Considering the costs of donor VW busses, the high-end parts installed on this masterpiece, and the two years of custom shop time during the restoration process, it would cost over $250,000 to recreate this vehicle.  Of course, that price does not include the time and money invested in getting the limousine licensing from the State of Hawaii, as well as other company assets.   The listing price for the company and the vehicle is $220,000.  I will also consider selling just the vehicle separate from the company if you are not interested in owning a fully-licensed limousine company in Maui.   To gauge your expenses, if you are interested in having the vehicle shipped, it will cost approximately $1,100 to ship it from Maui to the port of Long Beach, California via Matson Ocean Services.  Please feel free to email me (mark@endless-summer-limo.com) or call me with any questions on the company telephone.  808-See-Maui (808-733-6284).  The vehicle is located in Maui, registered in Maui until December 2015, and has a valid safety inspection in Maui until October 2015.  It also has a clear CA title in the name of the company.  Vehicle is sold as is with no warranties of any kind.   This vehicle is for sale locally, and I reserve the right to end the auction at any time.   Please ask any questions and have your funds secured before placing a bid.  A deposit of $5,000 is due via PayPal within 48 hours of the auction ending, with the remainder of the funds due within two weeks (or, as agreed to by buyer and seller).  I can also provide you with the contact information for the shop that created this masterpiece in case you have any technical questions beyond my knowledge.  Lastly, if you have serious interest in this vehicle and/or the company, feel free to call me to end the auction.  (808)733-6284.  I can guarantee you there will not be another VW bus like this for sale any time soon (if ever), so make it happen for yourself now. """

WeirdWheels,35z6cl,graneflatsis,3,Thu May 14 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"Info (Excerpt from ""100 Years of Design"" by Carol Gantz): http://www.industrialdesignhistory.com/book/export/html/154  ""At the Chicago Century of Progress Exhibition (1933-1934), Ford displayed a concept vehicle called the Briggs Dream Car, a rear-engine car with unitized body designed by John Tjaarda of Briggs Manufacturing Company, Ford's major body supplier. Tjaarda based his design on aero- dynamic monocoque designs and models he began working on in 1926, called the Sterkenberg Series, which he refined in 1930 while working for Harley Earl. In 1932, he was hired by Briggs as chief of body design in their new in-house design center. Briggs had just bought out LeBaron, Inc., and became Detroit's largest independent body producer. John Tjaarda (say ""charda""), 1897- 1962, was born in Holland of a titled family in the Sterkenberg area. He trained in aeronautical design in England and served as a Dutch Air Force pilot before emigrating to US in 1923. He worked first on custom bodies in Holly- wood, then pioneered in monocoque streamlined designs while working for Duesenberg and Harley Earl. Tjaarda and others were inspired toward aerodynamic car design by initial work started in 1921 by Austro-Hungarian engineer Paul Jaray, who began testing car models in aircraft wind tunnels. Jaray later used this data to design the streamlined 1933 Tatra 77 built in Czechoslovakia, which remained in production into the 1990s. The Tjaarda Dream Car bore an uncanny resemblence to the 1932 inexpensive rear-engine small car developed in Germany by Dr. Ferdinand Porsche for the NSU Company called the Type 32, or Kleinauto, which in 1933 was already on its way to becoming the Volkswagen Beetle. On the other hand, Porsche's design owes a lot to Tjaarda's Sterkenberg Series of the late 1920s. Chrysler picked up on aerodynamic research in 1927, prototyping a design in 1932 which resulted in their infamous Airflow design of 1934. Ford, in 1933, had begun annual styling changes (pioneered by Chevrolet in 1928 and causing the demise of Ford's Model T). Ford authorized development of the Briggs Dream Car to fill its need for a ""small"" Lincoln, and indeed, the design was patented in 1935 and became the prototype for the 1936 Lincoln Zephyr. The Zephyr was designed by John Tjaarda and Howard Bonbright, both of the Briggs Manufacturing Company, for Ford, under the supervision of Henry's son, Edsel, and Eugene T. (Bob) Gregorie (b. 1908), head of Ford's first internal styling department (which was initiated by Edsel in 1935). The Zephyr, however, looked quite different from the 1933 Dream Car because its engine was moved to the front and a ""prow"" added by Gregorie. The Museum of Modern Art later called the Zephyr the first success- ful ""streamlined"" car in the US. PS: John Tjaarda's son Tom (b.1934) re-located to Italy in 1959, where he worked as a car designer at Ghia, designing the DeTomaso Pantera and the Ford Fiesta (1977), and later at Pininfarina. He established his own small automotive design office, Dimensione Design, in 1984""  http://www.velocetoday.com/concept-cars-part-4-airflow  http://theoldmotor.com/?p=131195I   http://theoldmotor.com/?p=136605    Briggs Mfg.

There's really no reason to swap engines from Accord to Civic that early since it's basically the same engine, just 300cc bigger. Early Civics are also still quite popular and there's a huge amount of aftermarket parts and knowledge out there. I've also heard they can be much quicker than a 1G Accord when done right so there's no reason to swap.   Now a 1G Accord with a B16 or a K would be nuts. There's a lot of space in the engine bay."

Anyway, hunk of junk, but he never took care of it. I mainly remember that the carb would ice up as we went over passes. The pass is only 356 metres (1,156 ft) high, and even in summer the car would stall and we would have to pull over and wait for the ice to melt. WTF?"
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,SnowHawkMike,1 point,Wed May 13 13:05:58 2015 UTC,We just pulled over and blazed for a bit. Being Vancouver Island and all...
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,gtr427,2,Wed May 13 13:06:22 2015 UTC,Just an excellent design from 1989.

WeirdWheels,35s0hk,takeshita_kenji,2,Thu May 14 00:53:43 2015 UTC,If your vanity plate doesn't say 'Ka' you don't deserve to own this car.
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,candidly1,1 point,Wed May 13 03:24:51 2015 UTC,I don't get the reference. The Ford Ka is a different city car that started production in 1996.
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,candidly1,2,Wed May 13 03:40:10 2015 UTC,this is awesome!
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,Udeonbacher,2,Wed May 13 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Apparently this was designed with a retro style in mind, predating the current trend by over a decade.  Of course, there were other retro-styled cars before today's trend, but they weren't so prevalent."
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,Ontopourmama,2,Wed May 13 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of old East German cars. Having family in Weimar, I got a ride in a Trabby about 20 years ago. Good lord, what a piece of shit. Made of wood and plastic and newspaper."
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,Bamres,2,Wed May 13 07:36:58 2015 UTC,Let me guess:  900cc air-cooled three-banger?
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,bigBastardDude,3,Wed May 13 10:54:46 2015 UTC,Looks like 4 cylinders to me
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,laberge,3,Wed May 13 13:01:23 2015 UTC,"Man that little sucker is wedged in there, huh?"
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,CoSonfused,2,Wed May 13 12:51:06 2015 UTC,"On mobile read it as ""1989 Nissan Poo"""
WeirdWheels,35s0hk,scramtek,3,Wed May 13 12:56:33 2015 UTC,Some might agree
WeirdWheels,35sgkg,popcornfart,2,Wed May 13 03:10:04 2015 UTC,I got it one piece at a time  And it didn't cost me a dime  You'll know it's me when I come through your town  I'm gonna ride around in style  I'm gonna drive everybody wild  'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.
WeirdWheels,35sgkg,SaDoW4100,2,Wed May 13 04:58:10 2015 UTC,That definitely fits this dude. That is one creative ride. And he must have been a hell of an engineer to make the linkages for the front and rear wheels and all.
WeirdWheels,35sgkg,Hodaka,2,Wed May 13 04:59:43 2015 UTC,"That thing is hideous, although an interesting post OP."
