techsupportanimals,3bmkak,Draco1200,10,Tue Jun 30 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"Dealt with this the other day. We have backups that go to another site and have a 20Mbps connection to it. A guy that works on the database was complaining about how long it took compared to the local back up and complained about the 1-2MB transfer rate. I basically told him nicely, no shit it's going to be much slower.  Then my boss came in to talk to me about the speed. I said, I don't know what he expects, it's just a 20 meg pipe. My boss says, Well he should at least be getting 10 on the transfer (a number he obviously pulled out of his ass).  So I had to drop the knowledge bomb and explain that a 20Mbps connection will run at 2.5MBps at the max. He just looked at me dumb founded. . . . . ."
techsupportanimals,3bmkak,Draco1200,5,Tue Jun 30 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"The real question should be....  how come we are measuring data in bits in one place and bytes in another place.... why don't we use the same choice of unit for data being stored as data being transmitted; Bits on disk and bits on the wire;  it's all just binary data?  Ideally,  Windows explorer would be updated to stop referring to files in Kilobytes, and start quoting file sizes in Kilobits and Megabits.  It's a units issue....   The thermometer says it's a hundred degrees outside, and water boils at a hundred C,  so how come the water won't boil if a leave a glass on the hood of my car?"
techsupportanimals,3bmkak,SandovalCurse,4,Tue Jun 30 21:44:11 2015 UTC,"Probably marketing, especially as far as internet is concerned. 50mbps to the average consumer looks better than 6.25mBps, and for budget ones 10mbps looks better than 1.25mBps."
techsupportanimals,3bmkak,CBRjack,3,Tue Jun 30 23:43:02 2015 UTC,"I'm suggesting the 'bit' be the standard, not the byte.  This would also increase marketing numbers for hard drives.  Instead of a 4 Terabyte hard disk,   you now have a  32 Terabit hard disk!"
techsupportanimals,3bmkak,A0G,2,Wed Jul 1 00:23:37 2015 UTC,"Well...it's a bit more complex than that. Just look at the way data is transmitted vs. the way it's stored. When dealing with storage, we don't really care about the number, we care about the relative value. Bytes are easier to deal with because the number is smaller by a factor of eight - it's a reduction for the same reason we say ""fifty six k"" instead of ""fifty six thousand"", but segmented.  When it comes to data transfer speed, however, bits are much more important than bytes. Bytes is a static file size, a chunk, but data is not transmitted in chunks, it's transmitted in a stream of binary. The signal is either on or off, and this signal at any given time is a bit. Because of that, we don't give a crap if a connection can push an MP3 at streaming rates, we care what the theoretical maximum push of on/off pulses are so we can gauge whether we'd need 100Base-TX, 10GBase-T, etc. Network people aren't consumers, and when it comes to the Physical layer (with few exceptions), we don't give a shit what the use-case is (forgoing of course plenum-grade and EMF shielding), we care about how much binary is going to be pushed through. When things are squashed down to bits, it's all just numbers.  tl;dr - File size is important for the consumer and is compressed from large bit numbers to small byte numbers. Binary throughput per second is important for network admins, and ratings per second are typically small values, so bits are better to use."

techsupportanimals,3bmkak,SandovalCurse,7,Tue Jun 30 17:14:55 2015 UTC,"The two times that stick out in my mind..  At my old job, my network transfers were slow as shit because I was hooked up to an old 10mbps switch. I emailed the admin about it and they responded, ""But you're getting a 10 megaByte per second connection so maybe your computer is where the problem is."" After I bit my arm so I wouldn't scream, I pointed out that no, that is 1.25 megaBytes per second. Shortly after that they swapped it out and gave me a 100mbps switch.  Then the other day here I needed to transfer a 80 GB file over the network and the time estimate was over 2 hours (as opposed to 20 minutes or less under more ideal conditions.) After some discussion that went nowhere I decided to just cancel the file transfer, figuring that the slow speed had to do with the machine being heavily taxed at the time. Then later, one of the Admin guys came over and said that he figured out that the transfer speed should have been faster because it's not measured in megaBytes but GigaBytes per second. After I stopped my eye from twitching, I told him that by that logic, the file transfer should have occurred in under 3 minutes. I then mentioned that I cancelled the transfer anyways so it wasn't a big deal anymore."

techsupportanimals,35ztc6,mastachaos,4,Fri May 15 03:13:39 2015 UTC,security is always an issue
techsupportanimals,35ztc6,Draco1200,6,Fri May 15 09:58:44 2015 UTC,"security is always an issue   This is not true.   There are many use cases for file transfer where the transport security is not an issue, or the transfer speed is much more important.  Even if the data being transferred is   a  10 TB backup file of sensitive servers,  then transport can be secured by  virtue of the file being pre-encrypted before uploading,   Or through the use of a private point-to-point link for traffic isolation-based security,  such as a  FTP client and Server existing on a dedicated VLAN with their separate  IP space for the dedicated broadcast domain.  Sending the file with a SFTP stream would take about 500 times as long as a  FTP transfer accelerated using parallelism,   so there are situations where SFTP does not come close to meeting the functional requirements needed for file transfer but FTP does."
techsupportanimals,35ztc6,h0nest_Bender,6,Fri May 15 11:39:52 2015 UTC,"FTP/SFTP are still perfectly viable means of transferring files. It just depends on what you're trying to do.  File transfer to a server? Looks good.  Sharing files with people? Better tools exist (dropbox, for example)."

techsupportanimals,35ztc6,vanderpot,2,Fri May 15 03:08:55 2015 UTC,That's FTPS
techsupportanimals,35ztc6,Draco1200,7,Fri May 15 03:21:43 2015 UTC,"No....... it is FTP with RFC4217 extensions; which are generally supported by current FTP clients and servers.

As far as I am concerned, anything over port 21 that conforms to the FTP RFCs plus optional extensions (of which TLS is only one of many extensions) is still called FTP, not FTPS;  just like HTTP with negotiated TLS or other encryption over port 80 is still called HTTP and not HTTPS, and  Just like SMTP over port 25 when using TLS encryption is called SMTP with StartTLS.

techsupportanimals,35ztc6,Draco1200,1 point,Fri May 15 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"Please read the description of explicit FTPS   I think ""Explicit FTPS"" means adult content transmitted using the FTP protocol on port 990 with a SSL wrapper.  ""Explicit FTPS"" is a bit of an oxymoron.  Linguistically it doesn't even make sense;  it is just as nonsensical as saying ""Explicit FTP"" or  ""Explicit E-mail"".     There is no common convention in the English language that using the name ""Explicit"" in front of a word  refers to the last word of the acronym that follows.  The internet standards within the RFC series nor IANA refers to anything called Explicit FTPS; it is a technically incorrect shorthand for ""FTP using Explicitly negotiated TLS"".  I'll just acknowledge that there is some documentation  confusingly referring to FTP over TLS as ""Explicit FTPS"",  and the catchphrase has been repeated a few times evidently by a few authors.  That doesn't make the phrase technically correct,  or make it any less ambiguous, however.  I would suggest not attempting to just append 'S' to the name of the protocol to suggest the use of security features,  when by common convention it implies the use of a ""dumb"" SSL wrapper using a designated S port.  Just call it  ""SMTP"", ""FTP"",  when referring to both the standard version, and the standard version with extensions.  If within a context it is peculiarly important to assert up front that the encryption version is used then say ""SMTP with TLS"" or  ""FTP  with implicit SSL on control port 990"""

And then, yeah enter NAT, passive mode, SSL encapsulated ftp, ssh's take on ftp, and every other thing to 'save' ftp from being the POS it is ever since it was invented.  The bigger question is why are people still in 2015 so scared of HTTP file uploads?  Script-ability ease I guess."
techsupportanimals,35ztc6,Draco1200,4,Fri May 15 00:30:16 2015 UTC,"FTP can be faster and more efficient than HTTP,  since you can use one control channel and multiple parallel data connections.  HTTP was not originally designed for general file transfer, only transfer of small hypertext documents.    HTTP has had features bolted on over the years that help with the matter, but FTP was designed from the ground up for efficient large file transfer."

techsupportanimals,35ztc6,Draco1200,2,Fri May 15 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"the control channel turned into a fucking nightmare, and NAT soured the whole thing.   It sounds like you have deployment issues due to attempting to create FTP sessions over exotic equipment such as Firewalls or Network translation devices.  But FTP was extended to address NAT a long fscking time ago,  so there's really no excuse for not being familiar with Passive FTP.  Also,  FTP is basically the only game in town for large file uploads. There are many common original FTP use cases where HTTPS or SFTP-based transfers,  or my favorite file transfer tools...  Rsync, BTSync,  and Dropbox work just fine.  However, there are cases where they do not, and FTP still solves a problem.  FTP is most appropriate for accepting bulk uploads such as ISO files or large video files.  Also, if you want to transfer 10TB files around over the long fat pipe between datacenters, you should use  multi-stream FTP or UFTP,  as the performance of HTTP would be totally abysmal.  Using SFTP or HTTP protocol instead of an optimized FTP setup can mean the difference between getting a piss-poor 20 Megabyte/Second transfer rate  or getting the    950 Megabyte/Second transfer you actually need."

The product and service was developed by WebTV Networks, Inc., a company purchased by Microsoft Corporation and absorbed into MSN (the Microsoft Network). While most thin clients developed in the mid-1990s were positioned as diskless workstations for corporate intranets, WebTV was positioned as a consumer device for web access.  The WebTV product is an adapter that allows a television set to be connected to the Internet, primarily for web browsing and e-mail. The setup includes a web browser, a corded or wireless (e.g., bluetooth or IRDA) keyboard and a connection, using a modem, ADSL, cable Internet access, or power line communication.

techsupportanimals,32x42j,shameless_inc,7,Fri Apr 17 15:08:15 2015 UTC,the only app that has a large user base that is in java   ಠ_ಠ  I want a source for this claim.
techsupportanimals,32x42j,shameless_inc,-1,Fri Apr 17 17:40:06 2015 UTC,Can you think of any other program that even comes close? it's conjecture but it's a safe bet that there's no other java program within light years of minecraft.
techsupportanimals,32x42j,shameless_inc,15,Fri Apr 17 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"While I can't think of one program in particular, Java is still a very popular choice on Android, so Java's corpse for end-users is far from being dragged by Minecraft alone. When it comes to enterprise systems, Java is still doing amazingly well, it's just that end-users rarely interact with Java programs directly or when they do it's through some UI that doesn't look anything like you'd expect (eg, some ATM software)."
techsupportanimals,32x42j,Centropomus,4,Fri Apr 17 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"While I agree on the devices and enterprise part, I have to say that it's the Java Runtime Environment paired with the browser plugins which are causing the big trouble. Android just borrows the language and some libraries from Java, so it's actually not directly keeping that applet stuff going."
techsupportanimals,32x42j,tetroxid,-1,Fri Apr 17 21:49:52 2015 UTC,You're saying that Minecraft is keeping the Java applets alive?
techsupportanimals,32x42j,Centropomus,2,Fri Apr 17 22:17:54 2015 UTC,No. The point of my comment is that Android isn't.
techsupportanimals,32x42j,tetroxid,-1,Fri Apr 17 22:24:15 2015 UTC,"Well, then, whatever... I'm not going to argue about Java applets.

techsupportanimals,32x42j,toomuchnotime,2,Fri Apr 17 22:26:59 2015 UTC,That's okay and you're right.  I just wanted to say that Android mostly just users the language itself which is a different thing from using the normal runtime environment.
techsupportanimals,32x42j,HSChronic,3,Fri Apr 17 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"Most of Android is written in Java, and Android has an order of magnitude more users than minecraft. Eclipse probably has fewer users, but those users spend a lot more time in it than Minecraft users do, and the work they do is much more consequential.  In the server world, Java is the dominant language for new large applications."
techsupportanimals,32x42j,toomuchnotime,6,Fri Apr 17 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, most of Android (the operating system) is written in C++ and C. Most Android apps are written in Java."
techsupportanimals,32x42j,madasi,0,Sat Apr 18 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"For a minimal definition of what is Android, sure, but as it ships on every device I've ever seen, app code dwarfs the runtime and kernel out of the box, even without carrier bloatware."
techsupportanimals,32x42j,Centropomus,7,Sat Apr 18 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is true. I base my statement on the following thoughts:    Android is by definition an operating system An operating system roughly means a kernel, system services, libraries, runtime environments and tools Most of the code comprising the above is C and C++.   Of course there's much more Java code in the form of apps than there is C/C++ code in the operating system, you're correct."
techsupportanimals,32x42j,aidotato5,3,Sat Apr 18 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the businesses that still run old Cisco routers and ASA's. Can't run that ADSM without Java 1.6.  I did a server project for a place, put in a brand new 2012 R2 box...then they told me that they had to have ASDM for their staff to manage their ancient ASA. The weren't willing to use CLI, had to be ASDM. I actually installed Java 1.6 on a 2012 server and got ASDM working. I've never felt so ashamed."
techsupportanimals,32x42j,Centropomus,2,Fri Apr 17 15:18:49 2015 UTC,Yeah Brocade's SAN switches also require Java. Not only that but you have to change all the security settings in Java to get it to work.

This makes me sad, as it won't happen for a very long time and the browsers are now actively sabotaging my ability to bring a dead server back online.   And replacing Java with .Net is not the answer either, HP."

techsupportanimals,32x42j,doctorsound,3,Sat Apr 18 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"Probably a bit of both. The design of Java willingly accepted less efficient memory in exchange for giving developers more time to devote to things other than memory management. If your box was designed to be running optimized C code and a scripting language interpreter, and then they loaded a JVM and a bunch of Java apps, it'll be slower after adding the Java stuff, but that's more the fault of whoever decided to run more memory-hungry code on a cheap embedded chipset or SoC than it is the fault of Java."

techsupportanimals,2w6xmh,autowikibot,5,Tue Feb 17 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"Viola:       The viola (/viˈoʊlə/)  is a bowed string instrument. It is slightly larger than a violin in size and has a lower and deeper sound than a violin. Since the 18th century it has been the middle voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above it) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below it).   Music that is written for the viola differs from that of most other instruments, in that it primarily uses the alto clef, which is otherwise rarely used. Viola music employs the treble clef when there are substantial sections of music written in a higher register.  The viola occasionally has a major role in orchestral music. In the earlier part of the 20th century, more composers began to write for the viola, encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as Lionel Tertis. Englishmen Arthur Bliss, York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, and Ralph Vaughan Williams all wrote chamber and concert works for Tertis. William Walton, Bohuslav Martinů and Béla Bartók wrote well-known viola concertos. Paul Hindemith wrote a substantial amount of music for viola. In the latter part of the 20th century a substantial repertoire was produced for the viola.

techsupportanimals,2w6xmh,thedoginthewok,4,Tue Feb 17 15:41:51 2015 UTC,If the monitor was connected with an analog cable (vga) then interference through that would be possible.   I used to have a thin VGA cable for my second monitor at work and sometimes I had weird looking lines running through the screen. It turned out that the power supply for my laptop was sometimes to close to the VGA cable and caused it. I got my boss to order me a new VGA cable with better shielding and the issue was gone after that.
techsupportanimals,2w6xmh,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:13:24 2015 UTC,"VGA connector:       A Video Graphics Array (VGA) connector is a three-row 15-pin DE-15 connector. The 15-pin VGA connector is found on many video cards, computer monitors, and high definition television sets. On laptop computers or other small devices, a mini-VGA port is sometimes used in place of the full-sized VGA connector.  DE-15 is also conventionally called RGB connector, D-sub 15, mini sub D15, mini D15, DB-15, HDB-15, HD-15 or HD15 (High Density, to distinguish it from the older and less flexible DE-9 connector used on some older VGA cards, which has the same shell size but only two rows of pins).  VGA connectors and cables carry analog component RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical sync) video signals, and VESA Display Data Channel (VESA DDC) data. In the original version of DE-15 pinout, one pin was keyed by plugging the female connector hole; this prevented non-VGA 15 pin cables from being plugged into a VGA socket. Four pins carried Monitor ID bits which were rarely used; VESA DDC redefined some of these pins and replaced the key pin with +5 V DC power supply.

techsupportanimals,2tmd75,ajc1239,37,Sun Jan 25 15:57:46 2015 UTC,Possibly because your disk defragmenter automatically defrags your HDD but not your SSD because it doesn't need to be defragmented and it's also bad for the drive.
techsupportanimals,2tmd75,res13echo,20,Sun Jan 25 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"This will be exactly why. The only reason hard drives need defragmentation is to improve performance through lower seek times. SSDs have virtually zero seek time and therefor will have literally zero performance increase whether or not it's 0% or 100% fragmented. Plus it's very bad to defragment an SSD because the cells have a limited write/rewrite count, and moving files around in order to achieve peak defragmentation burns through a TON of cycles"
techsupportanimals,2tmd75,Obvious-Implyer,3,Sun Jan 25 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, since ssd's read off of multiple chips, the fragmentation can speed it up."
techsupportanimals,2tmd75,Haru24,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"I think most SSDs disguise the way data is written on the actual cells, so the fragmentation shown isn't necessarily indicative of how the data is stored on the drive. Fragmentation as it's widely understood doesn't really apply to media that doesn't suffer from a long and variable seek time. Fragmentation on a HDD is bad because the head has to jump around and wait for the platter to get into the right position before it can keep reading data. An SSD can read data from any location at a much faster and nearly constant delay, so it doesn't matter where the data is, it's all getting to the controller at about the same time regardless of where it is."

Windows 7, 8, and 8%1 of article  Solid-state drive:       Windows 7 has native support for SSDs,   with similar level of support in Windows 8 and 8.1. The operating system detects the presence of an SSD and optimizes operation accordingly. For SSD devices Windows disables defragmentation, SuperFetch and ReadyBoost, the latter two being boot-time and application prefetching operations. It also includes support for the TRIM command to reduce garbage collection for data which the operating system has already determined is no longer valid. Without support for TRIM, the SSD would be unaware of this data being invalid and would unnecessarily continue to rewrite it during garbage collection causing further wear on the SSD.

Sometimes they just blow up as a way to take out their frustration.  One of the docs does this to me all the time.  I still calmly walk him through the fix.  Normally it is just something minor and he is flustered by other issues. This doc normally will apologize the next day and this one has been cool and taken me out for a free meal and some drinks.   He does this quite often with his staff since he knows they put up with allot. They are still people and prone to stress and they deal with some major shit sometimes. I might have a higher tolerance for them since I used to work retail and at the very least I don't have to kiss ass or sell them anything. That's just the way it is.

techsupportanimals,2tcrz5,plasticsaint,6,Sun Feb 1 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"Former healthcare help desk rep.  There are quite a few doctors (and even nurses) I've encountered who look down on non-medical (and subordinate medical) staff, believing such positions to be less significant or important or prestigious than their own.  This was especially strong toward IT, in my experience, though perhaps I just noticed it more because I was on the receiving end.  However, there are also plenty of exceptions.  My experiences with friendly doctors v. unfriendly doctors tended to vary departmentally; one department would be really friendly and understanding while another would be constantly condescending and demanding.  It likely had a lot to do with departmental culture.  The doctors aren't who you have to worry about, though.  Nor are the nurses.  Nor are the support staff - the housekeeping/janitorial and dietary/cafeteria and engineering/maintenance departments.  Nor are the medical coders (usually, at least; they have a higher support cost, but they're usually somewhat technically capable, so they're a bit easier to work with if they're on-site).  It's the adminstrative staff you have to worry about.  Pretty much anyone with a desk job that doesn't involve constant data entry.  I'm not sure what it is about them, but working with such staff - especially such staff that's been around for awhile - can be maddening.  Granted, there are some exceptions here, too, but they're fewer and further between.  If you're going to work at a hospital, make sure your job is either:   As far away from human contact as possible (programmer, sysadmin, etc. - something abstracted away from the end-users via the help desk and/or field techs) With enough power to be able to tell the inflatedly-egotistical ones to go fuck themselves (IT director, CIO, some other supervisory and/or executive position)   That said, being on the front lines in that sort of environment definitely builds character.  It pretty much guarantees that whatever job you have after that will feel amazing.  I could be shoveling cow shit for a living right now and it would still feel like I'd been promoted (thankfully, I actually managed to move forward in an IT career; if I'd been there for much longer, I'd have probably set every electronic device I own afire before running off to the wilderness somewhere to live on rainwater and berries as a technophobic hermit)."

If their issue wasn't resolved in 30 minutes they'd call and complain.  Eventually the CIO just had the HD generate all Doctor calls as Priority ones (meaning an entire system was down and 100s of people were effected).  His 'explanation' (rationalization) was that one Doctor equaled 100 ""regular people"".   At the other end of the scale was the HMO I worked at where the Doctors would call the Help Desk and say if their issue wasn't fixed in one hour they were closing the clinic and sending everybody home.   The CEO found out about this and the very next Doctor that threatened to walk the CEO got the Docs Department VP and both went out to the Doctors office personally and told him he had two choices: he could retire or the CEO could fire him but both were effective immediately.

techsupportanimals,2t6a6x,h55genti,12,Wed Jan 21 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"I installed a new firewall on Monday, and got a call on Tuesday that Outlook 2013 would freeze when printing a particular email.  They told me that it was because of their new firewall, which I've been told many times and it never has been the case, especially with Office problems.    After trying Outlook in safe mode, removing add-ins, changing the default printer, restarting the printer spooler service, removing outlprnt from ""C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook\"", temporarily disabling antivirus, etc, I eventually figured out that it was freezing because it was waiting for an embedded image (logo) to load.  I tried going to the website where the logo is hosted, and it didn’t load either.  Other sites worked fine.  I couldn't reproduce the problem anywhere, until I came across the state's DMV (whose site wouldn't load).  Speedtest.net tested fine and I couldn't see problems with packet loss to our servers.  At this point I was thoroughly confused.  I poured through wireshark trying to figure out wtf was going on.  I tried adding exceptions for the sites in the firewall, in every area, even the ones that didn't make sense.  Eventually I came across someone that had a similar problem - with MTU.  I used ping to determine the maximum MTU for their connection, since 1500 was the SonicWall default (and is default for Ethernet connections, but they were using PPPoE!):  ping -f -l 1492 8.8.8.8  It returned an error that fragmentation was required, but the “-f” flag disables fragmentation.  Since the “-l” flag denotes the size, this told me that 1492 was too large for the MTU.  I subtracted 8 repeatedly until it succeeded, which ended up being 1462.  I set the MTU on their WAN connection (PPPoE) to 1462 and afterwards both website loaded, the embedded logo appeared, and the email printed correctly.  tl;dr client blamed their Outlook/printing problems on the firewall - it actually WAS the firewall's fault for once."

techsupportanimals,2rimcc,Aberu,8,Tue Jan 6 16:40:39 2015 UTC,That performance issue leads to a very good chance the array will fail before it finished rebuilding: https://www.reddit.com/r/storage/comments/1o2yns/i_want_to_build_a_hardware_raid_5_array_in_a_matx/ccofp6j?context=3

That post doesn't say how high the chances are upon rebuilding of another drive failing before rebuilding is complete.  I have a RAID5 (Raidz1 to be more accurate) array 9 tb in size which this post you linked seems to think it is still safe. That's why I was curious."

The chances are extremely low.  Since I have WD Reds, the error probability is actually higher (1per1015 bits, not 1014) so it's 100% for me. In fact 4x6tb is still 100% successful with that error probability so I still don't see the problem given your criteria.  Even more good reason to suggest the WD Reds for storage."

techsupportanimals,2rimcc,forgetfulcoder,2,Tue Jan 20 15:25:34 2015 UTC,"My topology recommendations are pretty unpopular here, but you're welcome to them: redundancy instead of parity.  In the conventional RAID world, that means RAID10.  In ZFS, that means a pool of mirrored vdevs.  In both cases, you have 50% storage efficiency, which is why most people don't like the recommendation - they want the absolute maximum storage they can get for the dollar they spend, and have difficulty seeing that the tradeoff is worth it.  So they go with parity, which gives higher storage efficiency (for example, 67% in the case of a six disk dual parity - aka RAID6 or RAIDZ2 - array, or 75% if it's an eight disk array) at the cost of lesser protection, lower IOPS, longer rebuilds, and far far worse performance when degraded or rebuilding, even above and beyond how much longer the rebuild itself takes."

I would assume that you have at least one magnitude lower just to be more realistic(Pessimistic, whatever.) If the drives are supposed to be 1015, I would calculate as 1014. Which is still very high 90's in your case."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,warlockwork,2,Tue Jan 6 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"Well it's 99.9% to be exact. Or 99.8% for 4x6tb.  Even then 4 drives is suboptimal performance upon rebuild for RAID5/RAIDz1 regardless (3/5/7 for RAID5, 4/6/8 for RAID6 is better performance) so it's not great, but it's what I did since my data isn't that crucial (just home media storage)."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,Aberu,3,Tue Jan 6 19:13:01 2015 UTC,RAID 6 FTW!
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,ataripixel,2,Tue Jan 6 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"This metaphor isn't completely accurate, but it explains the concept:  Imagine you have three drives (A, B, and C) that store just one number. Say drive A has a 1 and drive B has a 3. So if you were using addition as a parity method drive C would have a 4 on it. If you lose drive B you just take the number from drive C (your parity) and subtract the value of drive A, and you've got your number from drive B again. If you lose another drive though, your numbers are lost.  Raid 5 uses XOR instead of addition and subtraction, but that's the general idea. It doesn't have a copy of the data, but it can calculate it for you."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,borkedhelix,2,Tue Jan 6 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"raid5... redundant?  /notsureiftrollingorjustreallyignorant.png  edit: yes, RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks.  But that's not actually an accurate definition of the term as used.   RAID0 - no parity, no redundancy, no nothing.  Lose any disk, you lose the whole arrray. RAID1 - simple disk mirroring. lose a disk, keep on trucking, all data is still on the other disk(s). RAID5 - striping with (distributed) parity. write a parity block for each stripe. in the event of failure, you can reconstruct blocks from the missing disk by reverse-checksumming the remaining blocks with the parity block. this is a fault-tolerant array but not a redundant array. worth noting: every stripe read on a damaged RAID5 array requires two block reads on a single physical disk, severely impacting performance.  This gets even worse when actively rebuilding the array.   You can go way further down the rabbit hole from there, but the terms ""parity"" and ""redundancy"" are not synonyms, and the etymology of ""RAID"" is both irrelevant and inaccurate."

techsupportanimals,2rimcc,jofr0,2,Tue Jan 6 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"yeah, I know the acronym. but if you actually WORK with storage you refer to redundancy and parity as entirely separate things."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,mercenary_sysadmin,3,Tue Jan 6 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, RAID0 is still redundant, as it has multiple heads moving. This is a very different version of what redundancy does to keep storage people from getting fired."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,imawookie,-1,Tue Jan 6 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"um. no. that's not what ""redundant"" means, although it IS an excellent example of why you really shouldn't get too hung up on the etymology of the term ""RAID"".

techsupportanimals,2rimcc,mercenary_sysadmin,2,Tue Jan 6 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"that is exactly my point. it is part of the RAID spec, just because it has multiple parts, but in this case it is just multiple points of failure ( someone reduntantized the wrong thing! )"
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,imawookie,0,Tue Jan 6 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"But seriously, that's not what redundant means - in any sense of the word.  Nothing is ""redundantized""."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,mercenary_sysadmin,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, I agree with what you've been saying; however, given the lengthy discussion about the term Redundant in the ""RAID"" acronym, I feel this is relevant:  You said:   in any sense of the word. Nothing is ""redundantized"".       But the Google definition that you linked to, provides this as the ""engineering"" definition:   (of a component) not strictly necessary to functioning but included in case of failure in another component.   By that definition, none of the other drives in RAID 0, 1, or 5 are strictly necessary function, but in most RAID levels at least one of the other drives does serve the need of restoring function ""in case of failure in another component."" RAID 0 still doesn't really fit on its own though."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,TravisW85,2,Wed Jan 7 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"Officially RAID5 is redundant by spreading parity across the disks. Your definition of redundancy you are using here is different, that's referring to backups, redundant systems (like having multiple UPS in case one goes out, multiple power supplies in each server, etc...)...  I get what you mean, just officially a RAID is internally redundant in itself that's why it's called redundant, it's not true redundancy in the sense of proper administration of data, that's correct."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,Aberu,0,Tue Jan 6 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"No, actually, in data storage terms themselves parity and redundancy are different methods of achieving fault tolerance.  RAID5/6/7 use striping with parity to achieve fault tolerance by being able to rebuild lost blocks through stripe-wide calculations.  RAID1/10 use redundancy to achieve fault tolerance by having literal redundant disks - there is no reconstruction required in the event of a failure, a clean copy of all data is still present.  From there you can dive further down the rabbit hole into distributed redundancy, one example being btrfs-raid1.  In btrfs-raid1, you can for example have a five disk array - three 2TB disks, one 3TB disk, and one 1TB disk.  Despite the disks not being physical matches for one another, you still get the full 50% storage efficiency of RAID1 (5TB of the raw 10TB usable after redundancy), because the disks aren't mirrored, but any given block saved to the array is guaranteed to be saved to two separate physical disks.  And as /u/imawookie helpfully pointed out below, ""RAID0"" isn't redundant at all despite being referred to as ""RAID"".  Which demonstrates why you shouldn't get too worked up about the words that the acronym was originally formed from."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,mercenary_sysadmin,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"Inexpensive? The idea of using inexpensive disks seem pretty unsettling. I've always used ""redundant array of independent disks""  also, RAID10 is the new 5."
techsupportanimals,2rimcc,ensay,1 point,Wed Jan 7 08:26:03 2015 UTC,"As already stated above, the original meaning of the acronym is pretty irrelevant to modern use - but that is, in fact, what it meant.

I think I did screen over Christmas once, and this year my aim is to get comfortable with splitting windows/tabs/whatever-they're-called.  It's way easier to get it going if you start off with a .screenrc that gives you a bar somewhere telling you what's going on.  I've a simple one here that I used to use: http://avi.co/s/screenrc  Then there's a few commands to remember; ctrl-A gets you into 'command mode' so whatever you do next goes to screen.  Ctrl-A, <space> - next screen Ctrl-A <backspace> - previous screen Ctrl-A C - create a new screen Ctrl-A D - detach from screen (it stays running, so you do that then quit your terminal and next time you can come back and reattach).  From outside of screen, screen -dx will reattach to your previously detached screen.  There's loads more stuff you can do, but almost all the cheatsheets and guides I looked at initially didn't suggest a .screenrc that gave an idea of what was going on and I found it quite disorientating."

Just to go into detail, I didn't want to reinstall windows on this computer because I would need to inturupt the deployment process to install centurion smartshield and then install our University's antivirus program.

When I booted into Windows and began running updates only to get a This copy of windows is not genuine message.  Since our University uses a licensing server, I assumed it wasn't able to talk to it properly.  Turns out the date was a few days off and changing the date fixed it.

I usually do something like this:  iptables-restore /path/to/new/rules && sleep 20 && iptables-restore /path/to/old/rules   You can also do something like this to automate it further:  iptables-save ~/iptables-rules.bak && iptables-restore /path/to/new/rules && sleep 20 && iptables-restore ~/iptables-rules.bak   Or, if I'm writing the rules for the first time and don't have anything to fall back to:  iptables-restore /path/to/rules && sleep 20 && iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT && iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT && iptables -F   That way, if I screwed up and lose all connectivity, it'll automatically restore in 20 seconds.

techsupportanimals,2mk5od,picardo85,5,Mon Nov 17 17:01:40 2014 UTC,"You should probably get used to this. All mobile hardware, laptops included, are moving to monolithic/single board construction.  All mobile processors are moving to fully integrated system-on-a-chip designs that are more like mobile phone and tablet hardware. They've got a limited amount of pins and are less flexible for things like memory expansion.  The upside is these systems will be faster (Its much easier to get tighter timings) and a hell of a lot cheaper. Fewer parts, fewer chips, all that. They'll be a lot smaller and lighter too. Ex- Baytrail based tablets. Entire, full fat 64 bit PC on a single board the size of a credit card. Runs full windows 8.1 without a hitch and doesn't even need a cooling fan.  Downside is that they're not upgradable.   Lack of upgradability is unusual in expensive hardware like a macbook pro, but Apple is just ahead of the curve here."

Moreover, applications that you might not think are using IPv6—such as Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, and Windows Mail—could be.    from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/cc987595.aspx"

The title is a popular colloquialism for spies, and the series follows the work of a group of MI5 officers based at the service's Thames House headquarters, in a highly secure suite of offices known as The Grid. It is notable for both its high production value, and its use of popular guest actors. In the United States, the show is broadcast under the title MI-5. In Canada, the programme originally aired as MI5 but now airs on BBC Canada as Spooks.

Can I get the name of the school district you work for so I can talk to them about performing an audit of their infrastructure to ensure all parties, including the children, are secure. I would hate to think my child's information on your system would susceptible to a security breach because someone cannot figure out switchport security."
techsupportanimals,2ehkrf,_var_log_messages,8,Wed Aug 27 15:39:28 2014 UTC,"You should be less concerned with switch port security than other flaws in the chain. Network security is only as strong as its weakest link. Most network breaches aren't happening because hackers are bringing in computers from home and finding security flaws. They're happening as a result of social engineering, or because somebody peeked over the teacher's shoulder as they were typing in their password. We've even had cases where teachers were giving their password to students, including at least one case where the student was the teacher's child - caught because of active monitoring for breaches and unusual traffic.   I've had a management staff member receive an email purportedly from ""The Webmail Team"", including a "".in"" domain email address. The email asked them to confirm their username and password details, along with their full name, home address and date of birth. In spite of the fact that people have been told 100 times that they'll never be asked for their password and that they should never share it with anybody else, the only question they had about this clearly fake email was why I needed their DoB.  There is no audit that can address human trust, stupidity, or carelessness.   You can have all the locks and security you want on the door, but they're pretty useless if somebody just hands out the keys."

I installed testdisk, did a deep scan (took 2 hours, and I botched it the first time (accidentally hit ‘Q’), which is why it became a late-night fix and he went to sleep), then restored the Linux Mint partition he had deleted (because Windows had shown it as empty – Windows doesn’t recognize ext4). Of course I couldn’t test it, but this morning he told me it worked, and sent me this :)  EDIT: The GRUB2 modules were on that partition too, so he couldn’t get into windows either."

techsupportanimals,2co1i6,otakuman,6,Tue Aug 5 06:59:22 2014 UTC,"listen to me very carefully, been a contract programmer for years.  two points:  1 - if you don't know something, be up front about it. ""I have related experience in XYZ, I've never worked directly with ABC but am happy to figure it out.""  2 - never put yourself in the situation where you can be ""pushed"" like this. part of professionalism in coding is being able to push back. ""No, I'm sorry and I know you need this, but it's going to be another 6 weeks."" You are already working at 100%. I guarantee you your work has suffered by working too hard and too long. it is not possible to work at a level greater than 100%. If you put in more time, the work quality will suffer. Part of doing the job well is knowing when and how to push back. The customer generally doesn't know how to code. That's why they hired you. So part of your job is to educate them. And if something's going to take 10 weeks, don't promise it to them in 8, and don't let them come away thinking they can then push you into 5.

techsupportanimals,2co1i6,Chaseshaw,3,Tue Aug 5 18:30:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the company's been going downhill for quite a while. This was my first from scratch JSF project, and while I had already known enough to use it, the component convolution made it extremely hard to work with.  And you can't unit test JSF pages, so testing and debugging was horribly frustrating. Add to that my lack of hibernate experience, no coworkers to give me a hand, so I lost like a week debugging jpa queries.  But today I nearly finished it. Whether they fire me, I quit or stay, the knowledge I acquired has stayed with me. This has been a trial by fire, and I didn't break. Like Nietzsche, I can say this has made me stronger.  Also, fuck JSF. Next time I'll use Spring MVC + jquery.  I'll take your advice, and consider other choices."

Since the first day I've been at this company (three years ago) he's been saying ""we need to optimize this"" and ""optimize that"". And EVERYTHING needs to be a fucking project. If you spill a glass of water on the table, we need a project plan to clean that spill up, before anyone even thinks of solving the problem.  We're a small-ass software company and about 60% of the stuff we do, we do just for ourselves (internal projects). And yet I'm being accused of not doing enough ""paid work"" for customers. The thing is that I do not choose what I do, I get assigned to projects and it's not my fucking fault when I only get assigned to the metric shit-ton of internal projects we have.
