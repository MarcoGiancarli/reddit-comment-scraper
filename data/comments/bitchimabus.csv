bitchimabus,3dvt1t,Gh3rkinman,2,Mon Jul 20 09:33:38 2015 UTC,Sound that He got fired - either the tower gave him wrong directions or the plane was parked in a wrong spot - pushed back to early.   The only way he could loose his job over that would be if he took a wrong turn and ended up on a taxiway that was too small for the A380. Which happens - but it's a rare thing
bitchimabus,3dvt1t,Aberfrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:49 2015 UTC,Runway incursions are a pretty big deal and responsibility for mishaps usually falls on the pilot regardless of ATC / ground crew instructions. Think about it this way: you're backing into a tight spot in your car and a buddy is spotting you but he gets distracted and keeps telling you to back up until you hit another car.  Yeah you can be upset with your friend for giving you bad instructions but ultimately you're in the seat and you're responsible.  That's why it never hurts to be too careful as a pilot and always second guess what control is telling you.  99/100 times there's no issue but it only takes one mistake.  As we see here.
bitchimabus,3dvt1t,Gh3rkinman,3,Mon Jul 20 18:13:04 2015 UTC,Id like to know if you are a pilot or working anywhere on the airport (janitors and general workers not included).  Just asking if this is coming from a valid source or someone's asshole.

He lives off the kindness of others and eventually goes north to Alaska living off of nature. He lived in this bus which was left behind by construction workers for hunters for several months. He eventually ate some poisonous food and died from the cold.  I didn't know there were any photos of him in the bus. But how is it magic?

Personally, I'm for it, but a lot of the blackouts are over communication between you guys and the admins. If you guys have ever felt like the communication needs improvement or technology needs updating (or even if you're just against their firing process) then go for it!  Or maybe you guys could make a stickie post with like a petition or something for everyone to sign that you can send to admins as proof that everyone is wanting these improvements, not just the mods. If that trend caught on maybe that would help get a reaction out of the admins since it seems like they're mostly silent over the private subreddits.  Edit: Meant to add that if you did the stickie idea that you stop submissions. Kind of like going private, but you don't have you shut everything down."

The centripetal force combined with friction and forward acceleration (there would be no centripetal force or friction if it wasn't moving) help it stay upright, but as someone else said, it would stay upright at that angle if it was stationary too.  Edit: I meant that it helped it stay in the turn, not upright. I don't really know the precise physics behind it anyway as it turns out."

bitchimabus,3avp4d,Child-in-Time,-2,Wed Jun 24 12:10:15 2015 UTC,"Imagine a bus driving in a straight line, then approaches a banked curve similar to the OP. The bus wants to keep going straight, but the bank prevents this. The bus exerts a force upon the road, and the road exerts a normal force of equal strenght back upon the bus. However due to the difference in masses between the earth and the bus, the bus accelerates in a lateral direction, causing it to turn around the bank."

bitchimabus,3apmne,Timmyc62,3,Mon Jun 22 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"Cell phone cameras can stabilize the image via either of two ways: a physical optical stabilization device that physically shifts the lens to compensate for the shake, or a digital smoothening of the shake to make it seem like it wasn't shaking much. The first option is rare (available only in the iPhone6+, high-end Lumias, and a few flagship Droids), and the latter is an option that the user can toggle on or off."

bitchimabus,389aup,Azure_Providence,9,Fri Jun 12 19:09:45 2015 UTC,Whats the point in splitting or ejecting mass?
bitchimabus,389aup,Azure_Providence,20,Wed Jun 3 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"Bigger cells are slower.  Splitting pushes one of your cells forward in the direction of your cursor, allowing you to either engulf another cell ahead of you or to evade danger.  Ejecting mass makes you lighter and therefore faster.  You can use ejected mass to lure other cells closer to you or to increase the size of viruses (the spiky green circles).  Once you've put a certain amount of mass into a virus, it replicates in the direction you're adding mass, potentially lysing a cell on the other side.  So you can set traps using viruses to lyse other cells, then split to engulf the tiny daughter cells of the split cell."

bitchimabus,37b3hf,Deltigre,2,Tue May 26 14:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that they had low tire pressure and the tire caught fire.   Usually the whole bus burns out, but looks like this one was put out in time.  Supposedly you want to keep running on the burning tire until it runs out of rubber because the heat rising on a stopped coach will absolutely burn it to the ground."

The only reason I know this is my brother, who will be 40 this year has cerebral palsy and was shuttled via taxi to Frankfurt when we were in Germany. He and I both went to DoDs schools (dept of defense) when we were overseas, but the one where we were didn't have the facilities or teachers for him so he rode a taxi every day with an aide to and from housing to Frankfurt about 30 miles away at the expense of the government. The same laws about education apply to all school aged kids whether it's a federal school or a city or county I believe. From what I've learned growing up with him, the law states he had to attend a school that had facilities and trained teachers that could work with him. It's possible these vehicles that are seen with the 'school bus' signage are transporting children in the same way."

In my opinion, we should have never even been sent to an area that that could not support my brother in the first place.

No, that's not at all how he died.   After an initial autopsy on Mays's body on June 29, Vernard Adams, the Hillsborough County, Florida medical examiner, stated that Mays suffered from hypertensive heart disease and that heart disease was the likely cause of his death.

bitchimabus,33glaw,Stradocaster,17,Wed Apr 22 14:53:42 2015 UTC,Sensors that track the road and the car in front
bitchimabus,33glaw,Vertigo666,37,Wed Apr 22 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"More likely there's another set of tracks beneath with magnets for cars, and the busses, trucks, etc above are held to those magnets.  That's how I'd do it, anyway. Hell of a lot simpler easier and mechanically."
bitchimabus,33glaw,mikemol,16,Wed Apr 22 15:12:11 2015 UTC,"Could be, sure.  I recalled seeing a show about miniatures like these, maybe Modern Marvels, and the creator of one particularly impressive diorama had sensors on the cars, and a rather complicated computer system to track everything.  I think he even had an airport with planes taking off."
bitchimabus,33glaw,Vertigo666,9,Wed Apr 22 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"That's one way of doing it, but to have magnets actually hold on to the vehicles, you'd need very strong magnets, or have part of the vehicle dragging against the road.  In this case a small copper wire is embedded in the road about 1-2mm under the surface. The vehicle then uses magnets to track this wire. Each vehicle has a small chip inside and a central computer keeps track of all of them and tells them to stop when there's another vehicle in front, a stop sign, red light or in this case a train crossing. Also it's possible to have road crossing, roundels etc. and decide which route each vehicle should take."
bitchimabus,33glaw,FiskeFinne,2,Wed Apr 22 15:49:20 2015 UTC,"The stop and go stuff is easy, but steering?"
bitchimabus,33glaw,mikemol,3,Wed Apr 22 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it can only follow the wire, or in a crossing choose to turn 90 degrees left, right or go straight."
bitchimabus,33glaw,FiskeFinne,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"Still seems strangely complicated to me. I guess it's not so bad if you're not expecting it to use the visible set of wheels to steer. (I couldn't see the wheels on any of the vehicles turning in the gif, but the bus, especially, is obscured when it does its sharp turn.)"

bitchimabus,33glaw,BigBassBone,2,Wed Apr 22 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"If it's Miniatur Wonderland in Hamburg, there's a wire embedded in the road the cars follow."
bitchimabus,33glaw,kylegordon,7,Wed Apr 22 18:02:45 2015 UTC,"Generally this sort of gear is either the Faller Car System, or a derivative.  The little magnet follows a hidden wire, and the magnet turns the steering wheels appropriately. To make them stop and start, there's an electromagnet under stopping points that triggers an onboard reed switch.  To make them turn different ways at intersections there's coin like devices that rotate the embedded wire in different directions.  The Miniatur Wunderland has a phenomenally clever system, where the vehicles are controlled via IR transmitters in the room, and on their newer layouts there's cameras that can track the vehicles. When they need to charge the vehicle, it is driven to a charging station, and little clamps come into contact with the wing mirrors, where it then charges from.  Superbly clever stuff. Their channel is well worth following - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC99kO6xDZSh2UNA-jdpN7cA"

You can see the initial impact just sends everyone backwards.  Imagine running up and pushing a shopping cart really hard. It's probably going to deviate to the left or to the right, rather than go perfectly straight forward.

Edit: did my own Googling.    The term streetcar is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to horsecars drawn by draft horses. When electrification came, Americans began to speak of trolleycars or later, trolleys.   So I guess ""streetcar"" is not common?"
bitchimabus,2yspjt,skpkzk2,2,Thu Mar 12 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"it's an antiquated term, most Americans would call them trolleys or trams, but if you said streetcar to an american, they would immediately know what you mean."

bitchimabus,2yspjt,Khalexus,10,Thu Mar 12 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"Similar. Trams are light-rail and urban,generally run along streets, and are short-distance; whereas trains are heavy-rail and are generally long-distance with their own dedicated off-street passage. And trams are pretty much just people-carriers whereas trains can be used for freight etc.  But yeah, you're exactly right, they're not even cars, which is why ""streetcar"" seems like such a strange terminology!"
bitchimabus,2yspjt,MeEvilBob,2,Thu Mar 12 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"Don't forget though that even with the proper terminology, many trams are still referred to as ""trains"" on official maps and signs.  In the US (and likely elsewhere) the modern term is ""light rail"", and that makes sense since they could easily be confused with subways, which are standard trains but custom designed for a specific dedicated system."
bitchimabus,2yspjt,Khalexus,2,Fri Mar 13 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that ""light-rail"" was more dedicated tracks rather than tracks running through the street, and allowed for coupling - that there's a difference between ""light rail"" and ""tram"".   For what it's worth, in Melbourne, trams have never been referred to as trains, day-to-day or on maps/signs. But that's just within Melbourne, I don't know about elsewhere.  On that note though, we don't really have a ""subway"" as such, so our trams are quite a bit different from trains anyway. Might be less distinguishable elsewhere."

I've been searching around in Google Street View trying to find that building with the red stripe on it, and I can't find it.  It looks like it's a promotional image for the tram, so it's probably not even on the 96 route, but for the life of me I can't place the location.   EDIT: This is driving me nuts! Can't spot the location! I'm not even sure if it's in Melbourne, it's nowhere I recognise. I've asked my tram-enthusiast friend if he knows - he may very well know the photo itself and its origin."

But, to refuse to buy it simply because it's in early access is doing yourself a disservice if you think you'd like this style of game."

bitchimabus,2xuycl,intothelist,12,Thu Mar 5 02:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's a viable model for small developers to put out a game. Sure, sometimes early access games get abandoned or don't live up to the hype, but it's $7 and that's the gamble you take. Kerbal Space Program was an early access game that already has a subreddit of 100k people before the official 1.0 release. Minecraft was released the same way. I can tell you first hand that this one is worth the few dollars. If it gets developed further then I'll be first in line to play the new updates but if not, I spent a day and a drunk night making catapults and I'm happy with my purchase. If you only want to buy $60 games made by AAA studios, then go for it.  Unless you were being sarcastic, in which case, disregard this post."
bitchimabus,2xuycl,BordomBeThyName,4,Wed Mar 4 07:04:51 2015 UTC,When big companies do early access it is bad. But for small companies it's often the only way to get the game beyond alpha.
bitchimabus,2xuycl,modernbenoni,0,Wed Mar 4 12:29:24 2015 UTC,You shouldn't be against buying early access games. It's a good way to support the games you want to see go out of alpha.   You should be against people that complain that the alpha is lacking in content.
bitchimabus,2xuycl,Fartsival,0,Wed Mar 4 11:50:06 2015 UTC,If you're not going to buy it solely because it's in alpha then you're a moron.

The vehicle was first fielded by the United States Army's mechanized infantry units in Vietnam in April 1962.  The M113 was the most widely used armored vehicle of the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War, earning the nickname 'Green Dragon' by the Viet Cong as it was used to break through heavy thickets in the midst of the jungle to attack and overrun enemy positions, but largely known as an APC and ACAV (armored cavalry assault vehicle) by the allied forces.

We had this bus and it was clearly kind of old. So after getting about a half an hour out of Petra on the way back to Amman the bus was really struggling to make it over the hills. Someone saw that it was smoking from the back and flagged the driver. We all managed to get out just in time before the whole thing went up in flames.

bitchimabus,2uvnz5,mognut,1 point,Fri Feb 6 00:10:06 2015 UTC,"Water taxi:       A water taxi or a water bus, also known as a commuter boat, is a watercraft used to provide public or private transport, usually, but not always, in an urban environment. Service may be scheduled with multiple stops, operating in a similar manner to a bus, or on demand to many locations, operating in a similar manner to a taxi. A boat service shuttling between two points would normally be described as a ferry rather than a water bus or taxi.  The term water taxi is usually confined to a boat operating on demand, and water bus to a boat operating on a schedule. In North American usage, the terms are roughly synonymous.

bitchimabus,2u8wda,hagenbuch,-1,Sun Feb 1 03:13:24 2015 UTC,I'm completely fine with sharing the road. I know most cyclists obey the laws and ride defensively. But I've never seen one ride in the middle of the lane like that. That forces passing traffic to go almost completely into opposing traffic.  Not defending the driver at all. Just something that stood out to me.
bitchimabus,2u8wda,z57,3,Sat Jan 31 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"The other option is to let all passers crush you into the curb. I bet the cyclist has a long history of trying both... and here, the opposing traffic had a separate lane.."
bitchimabus,2u8wda,CarrotIronfounderson,2,Wed Feb 4 03:42:06 2015 UTC,"Generally it's more dangerous to ride in the right part of the lane because a driver will go around you half in your lane and half in the other, vs fully getting into the other lane. While that doesn't seem too bad, it increases the chance the driver won't get far enough over or turn back too soon and clip you with their mirror or with their rear fender. Also the side of the road is full of crap from and your chances of getting a flat increase substantially."
bitchimabus,2u8wda,zeusmeister,0,Wed Feb 4 07:15:13 2015 UTC,"""Forces passing traffic to go completely into opposing traffic.""  No. Motorists need to stop with that bullshit. Did the cyclist reach in and crank your steering wheel and stomp on the gas causing you to go into oncoming traffic?  I love how drivers somehow lose all sense of responsibility and sense if something outside the norm of ""car go in road, people go in car"" happens in their mundane lives. You have power over what you do. If you decide to swerve into oncoming traffic that's your own issue. Not to mention you also completely misread this completely easy traffic scenario, where there's a wall blocking opposing traffic, and those are two lanes of travel in one direction. Drivers, please remember guys on bikes are people too. If you see one taking the whole lane, that's their legal right 99.9% of the time, and it's really not going to affect your life much to sit behind them until you know it's clear to pass. However, trying to rush a pass becomes dangerous to everyone."

bitchimabus,2to4bk,No_Warhawkz,10,Mon Jan 26 04:01:34 2015 UTC,"If it is a law, i was not aware of it, nobody mentioned it at the crash, the police never mentioned it, and the ticket i received didn't say anything about it. The officer i spoke the most with told me to ""next time, go slower and stay in the right lane.""  The wreck was in Virginia, which has many places where, when the road goes up a steady incline for multiple miles, there are signs specifically stating that commercial vehicles can't be in the left lane when operating under the speed limit. to me, this implies that there isn't a law on the books that prohibits them from ever being in the left lane.  Tbh, if the same circumstances had happened in the right lane, it wouldn't have made any difference. there was so much traffic that if i had left any larger of a gap between me and the vehicle in front of me, it would have been immediately filled by somebody swapping lanes. then i would hang back and slow down until i had a large gap and somebody filled it again. this doesn't make the wreck any less my fault, but it is frustrating."

Sometimes four lane highways require that you stay out of the far two left lanes. The only time this becomes the exception is if you are within a mile of a left exit.   This UHaul is most likely over 10k GVW (what the vehicle weighs combined with how much weight you are carryinf, you're not supposed to exceed GVW. Example given. My truck weighs 17k lbs. Its GVW is 25,900 lbs. If I put a 10k lbs vehicle on it I have exceedes the GVW and am now driving illegally. The truck I drive can actually handle being loaded with more than 10k lbs, but it's still illegal. Even if I were licensed for driving such weights. The vehicle is only registered for 25,900 lbs."

I drive serviced/new trucks to dealers and stores and swap trucks due for service. As a transfer driver I can tell you yes they do have anti lock breaks. I've had to slam the breaks a few time and you can feel it especially on the newer trucks like this one. As for updating their fleet that's not true either. I rarely find a truck 200k and the pickups/vans go for  auction after a certain time not miles. As for training idk what they can do to improve this but it's nuts who they give the keys to and these things are beasts.

That locks up the wheels and thusly their steering so they just slam into what ever the truck was pointed at. At least with ABS you can steer.

bitchimabus,2therl,Reasonable-redditor,4,Sat Jan 24 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"Crash (1996 film):       Crash is a 1996 Canadian-British psychological thriller film written and directed by David Cronenberg based on J. G. Ballard's 1973 novel of the same name. It tells the story of a group of people who take sexual pleasure from car accidents, a notable form of paraphilia. The film stars James Spader, Deborah Kara Unger, Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Rosanna Arquette.  The film generated considerable controversy on its release and opened to mixed and highly divergent reactions from critics. While some praised the film for its daring premise and originality, others criticized its combination of graphic sexuality with violence. Although it was nominated for the Golden Palm at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, it instead won the Special Jury Prize.  The film's music score was composed by Howard Shore.

However, a bus loaded with passengers and luggage takes quite a bit of distance to stop. This is why breaking down on the highway is a really bad idea. Always clear to the shoulders and light some flares if you have them."

bitchimabus,2snq3o,TrotBot,2,Sat Jan 17 07:49:14 2015 UTC,"As the link says, there's a high pressure front ahead of the train due to compression.  Whereas fast moving air encases the entire body of the train (if it's going fast enough), and there's a vacuum behind the train.  The fast-moving air encasing the train is the same type of encasing as the one around a fast moving truck or plane (fast moving air has low pressure fyi). If your car gets too close to a fast moving truck on a highway, the high pressure on the opposite side of your car literally pushes you in towards the truck (you get the feeling that your car is being sucked into the truck's sides).  Similarly here, as the bus approached, he might have been slightly pushed out of the way, and then as it went by, he was probably pulled in slightly. It all depends on relative surface area and humans don't have much surface area for noticeable actions"

bitchimabus,2qsyfi,kumaku,2,Tue Dec 30 16:46:53 2014 UTC,"Twin steer axles. A lot of heavy vehicles do this, and it actually improves turn radius while minimizing wear on tires/roadway. With a typical coach the tag axle (which is only there for weight distribution) either steers a small amount, drags side to side, or can be lifted totally off the ground, with this setup it gives a single rear pivot point while keeping all wheels on the ground, especially important with the extra weight from the upper level."
bitchimabus,2qsyfi,unusualmusician,1 point,Wed Dec 31 00:25:37 2014 UTC,"I was always curious about the purpose of lifting the tag axle. One of the coaches I drive has twin rear axles, and I understand how lifting one of them would create a single pivot point around the still lowered axle, but how does lifting the tag axle change the pivot point on a single rear-axled vehicle?  EDIT: Sorry, I just realized this was from like a month ago."

Here are just my immediate concerns from reading this article. The strongest appear first.  Students were having sex on a bus and that didn't attract any bus driver or state trooper attention. The retaliation from being teased did, however.  Although vaginal flatulence is the official term, can we as a society agree that's just too disturbing and go back to queefing? If memory serves correctly, South Park made this one socially acceptable again.  The officer''s description makes a somewhat natural phenomenon sound like it should a deadly medical condition or a life threatening condition.

We waited at the front at the traffic lights and as they changed the coach shot off and swung right cutting off oncoming traffic, essentially bullying his way back onto the right road. The oncoming car let out a pathetic but long beep and as we rounded the corner the driver returned fire with a huge three tone honk that would have woken the dead.

bitchimabus,2pitar,RChickenMan,1 point,Wed Dec 17 03:12:46 2014 UTC,Cheaper and just as effective as any LRT.
bitchimabus,2pitar,zharguy,5,Wed Dec 17 04:09:13 2014 UTC,"I think it depends. BRT has certainly proven itself in the developing world. But in North America, at least, even just the psychological benefits of a fixed guideway (anything from modern streetcars to LRT to full-blown grade-separated rapid transit) seems to yield better ridership and further incentives transit-oriented development. But on the other hand we've never really seen a ""proper"" BRT implementation, so it's tough to really support that conclusion!  But I do agree that a vehicle of this scale definitely helps bridge the operating cost gap between BRT and LRT."

bitchimabus,2pitar,t_maia,1 point,Sun Dec 21 21:48:52 2014 UTC,"Which country is this? This is what accordions look like where I am and despite having ""more interior space than the older model"" it still feels cramped. This one is like a fucking train and the increased space of the third section should help because you can get some room to move if you decide to ride the trains that we have over here instead. But something I wonder is… do they (the transit company of my area) purposefully buy buses with only 2-sections to try and get people to ride the train? Because it seems people like the bus better due to it not having to run on a set path as it can go more places on the roads."

Hatenanny Records and the Hate Bus of article  George Lincoln Rockwell:       In the 1960s, Rockwell attempted to draw attention to his cause by starting a small record label, named Hatenanny Records. The name was based on the word ""hootenanny"", a term given to folk music performances. The label released several 45 RPM singles of music with openly racist lyrics, and were sold mostly through mail order and at party rallies. When the Freedom Riders drove their campaign to desegregate bus stations in the Deep South, Rockwell secured a Volkswagen van and decorated it with swastikas and white supremacist slogans, dubbing it the ""Hate Bus"" and personally driving it to speaking engagements and party rallies.    According to an FBI report on the American Nazi Party, the van was repossessed after a loan default.

So, one of our drivers (lucky bastard) just drove the car down to the garage via streets, you could hear it all through the campus, was glorious."

The castle is located on a high plain between the towns of Leonberg, Gerlingen and Stuttgart. The castle offers views to the north over Weilimdorf, Korntal and Ludwigsburg.
