HALP A SIMPLETON OUT?"
talkshows,3d8e5l,Grummond,2,Tue Jul 14 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"You're sort of asking two different questions there. This is a great example of Letterman letting his personality shine through but it's not exactly why he's considered a genius haha. The whole point of this clip is that there is no hidden meaning, it's just a monkey sneezing in a funny way that they managed to get on film. The fun comes from watching Dave take so much joy in building it up, giving it intro and outro theme music and playing it randomly during monologues and guest interviews during the weeks following. The point is that there is no point - a common trope now in late night but he was really the one who originated it.  That said, as far as why Dave is held in such high regard I'd suggest you read Conan's tribute in EW or maybe this blog post. They do a better job at explaining his legacy than I could do. But of course nothing beats just watching old episodes - keep an eye out for Letterman clips on this sub, especially ones from Late Night, and maybe one day you'll come around. Or not, which is fine too.  *Edit: I just hit Ctrl+F on the sub for ""Letterman"" and of course the page is just full of my user flair.

I just never understood why it's supposed to be brilliant, I always had the feeling there's an ""emperors new clothes"" thing going on, where everyone says he's a genius and brilliant, and the first person to say ""why exactly"" exposes himself as a total dumbass that doesn't understand brilliant comedy when he sees it.   And I've always had this feeling that there MUST be some hidden meaning behind his skits, it can't be that simple and still be called brilliant. Now Conan has a great sense of humor. Jimmy Fallon is an excellent entertainer. I could even see why some people found Jay Leno moderately bearable. But I never understood Dave. There had to be something I just didn't get about him.  I hope there is. He's a likeable character and I really WANTED to like him. Maybe that was the real reason people called him a genius? I hope I'm wrong, mostly because I want to be."

You have a monologue and about two sketches per show (probably with some form of subtle advertisement in them like Corden's Range Rover, and other more not-so-subtle types) and then you have the interviews which are advertising for the studio's other projects. So when they say they're ""exploring"" it just means that they're testing new ways of doing what they're already doing."

But seriously, 2 out of 12 people down voted this link so it's safe to say that this type of talk show is not for everyone.  It feels like he had free reign to do whatever he wanted on the show and it probably would have been more successful a show if he or vice tried to make the show less dark and more relatable.  But then again that's sort of what I appreciate about the show.  He made a show that he wanted to make without trying to please everyone.  I feel like that's what makes the show much more original and separates itself from all the other talk shows out there."

At least Larry David has been producing at a respectable rate.  I found his honesty in this interview refreshing--the bluntness was the joke.

I don't think that the Only in Monroe bit was a good indicator of what the show will be like -- probably just getting his chops back. I've always found him to be an extraordinary interviewer. He is able to poke fun of the guest in a way that simply highlights their attributes/career. I don't think he has to play the character 'Stephen Colbert' to pull off his ""elbow-nudging"" sarcasm."

talkshows,3c5o9p,classicbitch,27,Sun Jul 5 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"Well, Seth Meyers may not be for everyone and there is a prevailing opinion among many, but apparently not all, that he actually is funny and his SNL crew (Poehler, Samberg, Armisen, Wiig, Forte, Sudeikis) is one of the best ever. Certainly not the least funniest (1980 may take that one). He's very charming while also being very honest and self-aware. I find his monologue to be the smartest in late night television currently. He's also an excellent interviewer."
talkshows,3c5o9p,davemello84,7,Sun Jul 5 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard much about Seth, (compared to other late night talkshows) however i did find the remote he did with his brother where they got drunk pretty funny"

talkshows,3c5o9p,scuczu,4,Sun Jul 5 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"As with anything, all of this is going to come down to everyone's opinion. Some people like something, some people hate it.   Personally, I really like Seth Meyers and his style. To me, his comedy is very concise and on point with what a joke is trying to accomplish. His comedy is very writing driven, and not dependent on ""impromptu"" act outs or anything to sell a joke. His monologue is very rapid fire and, as far as comedy writing goes, his ""word economy"" is great. There is no fluff in any of his jokes, both monologue and his desk bits. Which I personally like.   When it comes to his show in general, it does need some work. I'll admit. While I love the style and direction of the comedy, the execution and content can be better. Mainly when it comes to his desk bits. Some are solid, like ""Ya Burnt"", but many fall flat.  While Corden came out the gate with a ""voice"" for his show, Seth is still trying to perfect a ""writing driven"" show. I think given enough time his show could be on par with the writing quality of Conan's Late Night. Which was a very writing dense show.   The show has made tremendous strides in its first year, and I like watching to see the quality increase. So I'll continue to watch. As of now his monologue is my favorite in late night, and he is my favorite interviewer since Craig Ferguson is gone.   Again, all this comes down to opinion. Different strokes. But I'm glad Seth is running late night and I look forward to see how his show grows."
talkshows,3c5o9p,TheFaceofRay,3,Sun Jul 5 06:25:59 2015 UTC,"He seems like a kind and likeable guy but I don't find him entertaining. He's so bland and vanilla in his delivery, it's too monotone. He doesn't have Leno's delivery or Ferguson's charm."
talkshows,3c5o9p,Riker_is_number_1,2,Sun Jul 5 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"I am not a loyal viewer of his show but I respect Seth. For one, there are few people I know who would agree with your statement on the SNL cast he originated from. Maybe you are older and more nostalgic for casts before his time? I don't know - but during that era of SNL most anyone who was still watching knew that even during the worst episodes, Weekend Update would be there to save the day because the writing would always be on point. Seth has brought that with him to late night and thus he has the smartest monologue of the network guys. Colbert will likely give him a run for his money but for now - seth's strength is most def in his monologue ."

I mean, the conservative angle is gone, but his persona is still pretty much the same as his character from the Report.

talkshows,3b3zju,akushdakyng,9,Thu Jun 25 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"In terms of innovation, Stewart is second behind Johnny Carson. Carson was the person who introduced us to the modern talk show concept. Stewart propelled the talk show format by introducing political and current affairs satire. They both had skits but Stewart was grounded in the absurdity and the reality of our times. His laughter comes from the catharsis of being here while Carson just joked for the sake of laughing.   When you watched Carson, it felt like he was bringing these celebrities into your house for tea and a conversation. Stewart's conversation with whoever was like a comedian taking control of NPR.   Jon Stewart's innovation was that his interviews and his own personality resounded loudly on the show. It was a pulpit at times when a crusade against the unjustified must happen. Most of the time, it's a court jester's stage where he tells people how stupid it is to eat pizza with a fork. He made his comedic personality and his own ideals be part of ours or, at the very least, be part of the larger worldly conversation. There isn't something in the world or at least in an American context that doesn't let us invoke Stewart's name in our daily conversations.  Carson left politics and world affairs out of his show. He was there for 47 minutes to 100 minutes to entertain. All Carson did was straighten his tie, read the cue cards, get Sinatra to come on, Rickles to insult him, have a band play, and cash in his check for the night. There wasn't a sense of seriousness. It was a simulacrum of what the world would be if your TV and your room was in Johnny's set.  If I had to create a ranking for Top 5 talk show hosts:   Johnny Carson Jon Stewart (TIED) Stephen Colbert/Conan O'Brien (TIED) Dave Letterman/Craig Ferguson"
talkshows,3b3zju,symphix,2,Fri Jun 26 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"Is that supposed to be an objective list or is it just your favorites? Because if that's in anyway supposed to be considering the most influential/important hosts, then it's really bad. To put Stewart ahead of Letterman is a big stretch, but Colbert and Conan above him and Ferguson on the same level is completely ludicrous.  I'm a big Jon Stewart fan, but you're overstating his importance. He didn't invent the political late night comedy show. He didn't even have the first one on Comedy Central. Bill Maher did it three years before him. Dennis Miller had a late show that had a tendency to get political for a brief period of time as well. There's probably others I'm forgetting, too. Regardless, even though Stewart did bring it to a whole new level, there were others before him that made their ""own ideals"" part of the show, and the hosts personality resounding loudly on the show certainly wasn't his innovation. He was the first person to make a political talk show into a late night staple. The Daily Show is going to continue through new hosts and generations alongside the Tonight Show and the Late Show. That's his innovation, not really anything new that he did as a host, just the quality of how he did it. And also, honestly, if Colbert decides to keep a political edge when he hosts the Late Show, he could end up surpassing Stewart as the most important political late night host."
talkshows,3b3zju,EdgarsTeethAreDry,2,Tue Jun 30 21:04:56 2015 UTC,Stewart's conversation with whoever was like a comedian taking control of NPR.   That's the best description of his style I've ever read.  Thank you.

talkshows,3b3zju,dddavid76,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty much in total agreement, even with your rankings.  Carson was the biggest innovator, and in many ways, he really set the standard.  And Jon Stewart -- despite what Colbert having done (within the 'Colbert' character) being a LOT more difficult to pull off than Stewart's Daily Show format -- really became the go-to host for an entire generation.  Nobody cut through the BS, and yet was funny as all get-out, like Stewart -- night after night, for nearly 2 decades.  He will be sorely missed, I think, WAY more than Letterman, or even (eventually) Conan or Fallon."
talkshows,3b3zju,Rooster_Ties,3,Fri Jun 26 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"Tied with Conan, right after Letterman and Colbert.  Stewart is at a disadvantage in that his show has a pretty set brief and doesn't allow for as much variety as some of the others, but he's built that thing into an institution and is, for my money, the best serious interviewer on television right now (not just late night)."

And Sarkeesian is a terrible example because people don't hate her for being a girl or talking out about sexism, she is just an asshole and just another anti-video game mom.

If you saw a dumbass play in the street and get run over, would you try to defend his stupid decision?"
talkshows,3as7sf,DeeBeeC,5,Tue Jun 23 08:23:13 2015 UTC,It is not legal to play in the street - it is legal to take photos of yourself for private use.  You play in the street and you could cause someone to crash - taking photos of yourself effects no one else. Telling women to just assume they will be robbed and have their private information released is like telling someone they should rip up their social security card because it is best to assume your identity will be stolen.  It is unique to crimes against women that people frequently find ways to fit in some blame for the victim.
talkshows,3as7sf,JIsrael180,-2,Tue Jun 23 08:39:31 2015 UTC,"Telling women to just assume they will be robbed and have their private information released is like telling someone they should rip up their social security card because it is best to assume your identity will be stolen.   If you are taking pictures of your social security card and sharing it with strangers, then you should be to blame for having your identity stolen"
talkshows,3as7sf,DeeBeeC,5,Tue Jun 23 11:26:40 2015 UTC,"In that story she wasn't sharing them with strangers. She shared the pictures with one person she trusted and then he shared them with the world. If I shared my Social Security number with a significant other and they pretended to be me and posted it online that's identity theft, which is essentially what happened here except with photos."
talkshows,3as7sf,Nanners4Days,-2,Tue Jun 23 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"I still don't see how anybody can feel sorry for her. She should've known better. I mean, she is a professor. Doesn't that job r require a bit of critical thinking?"
talkshows,3as7sf,DeeBeeC,2,Wed Jun 24 22:53:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think she really lacked critical thinking here. She trusted someone whom she had a serious romantic relationship with and they betrayed her trust and acted in a childish and hurtful way.   Sure hindsight is 20/20 and it's easy to say she shouldn't have trusted him now that we can look back, but at the time I don't think she, or most people for that matter, would assume someone they love would hurt them like this.   I have Ex-girlfriends who had knowledge of things about me that would be hurtful or embarrassing if they became public knowledge, but at a certain point in relationships you trust each other enough to let your guard down. If couples were always keeping their guard up in then it would be very hard to build intimacy with each other.  I'm fortunate enough to have dated women who, even after the relationship is over, are mature enough to act like a decent human being and not pull a stunt like this guy did. Likewise when I've been dumped in the past I did the decent human thing of deleting and/or not sharing personal stuff like that."
talkshows,3as7sf,Nanners4Days,0,Thu Jun 25 14:56:02 2015 UTC,How do you know she isn't a ho that burned some guy and he got revenge the only way he could? We don't know the full story
talkshows,3as7sf,DeeBeeC,2,Fri Jun 26 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"But why would you assume that? That's victim blaming 101. What he did was childish and wrong. It's not ok even if she did something to ""deserve it""  These people aren't middle schoolers. You can have a fight, break up, or even be cheated on without pulling something this immature and petty. Why not blame the person we know did the crime instead of assuming that the victim must have done something to deserve this.  But for the sake of argument let's assume she did hurt him somehow. The right thing to do is break up and move on. Emotionally stable adults don't act like this. I was cheated on once, it sucks. I was angry and depressed for a while, but I didn't try to get revenge or pull a dumb stunt like this because I'm an adult and I know how to act like one. Decent human beings don't try to destroy the lives of their ex's, even if they feel their ex's ""deserve it"""

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can really see how much Jimmy struggles at being funny in this segment because it relies on either Jimmy saying something funny when being asked a question (which didn't happen) or someone in the audience saying something unexpected and funny (which only happened with the chubby girl with the glasses)  Still love the show and have spent countless hours watching his segments."

So much for keeping the legacy around!  I get that they want to monetize it, and they should! But it'll be months before they have something available.

talkshows,39jhtn,ontos90,3,Fri Jun 12 04:02:19 2015 UTC,"'The Late Show With David Letterman' was/is owned by 'Worldwide Pants' not 'CBS Television Studios', this was part of the sweet deal Letterman got when he moved to CBS. This is unusual in Late Night as most other shows are owned by their networks.  So WP owns the digital distribution rights to all the footage, during the shows run they let CBS put them on Youtube for them (CBS runs that channel). Now that the show's not airing on CBS any more it's none of their business. WP will most likely set up their own site or channel to show the clips.    The volume and breadth of those clips will make the library valuable, Mr. Burnett said. It's not just Mr. Letterman riffing on current events, but years of stand-up and other cultural memorabilia. They have a future on YouTube or Yahoo, in documentaries and any number of other landing spots, he said."

talkshows,39jhtn,omarciddo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So the quote was part of a general interview during the show's closing week and not a response to ""why did you take down all the clips all of a sudden?"" Has anyone from WWP commented SINCE the clips were removed?"
talkshows,39jhtn,gigasteelbyter,0,Sat Jun 13 18:17:59 2015 UTC,I think CBS chose to take them down to direct people's attention to Colbert over the next few months. Maybe they feel that Colbert will have a better chance to come out strong if Letterman's shadow is as far removed as possible.
talkshows,39jhtn,demonkobra,3,Fri Jun 12 04:47:18 2015 UTC,I really doubt that's the case... if anything Letterman's legacy is a boost to Colbert. It's a big deal that Colbert gets to replace him and host The Late Show in the same theatre etc.  Also that doesn't fit with the explanation in the article.

He wants to visit other countries and just do a show of him interacting with other people. Now that sounds like a show netflix might do. I don't see Conan leaving TBS for other network, he already had his peak on the tonight show. Right now he is in the same boat where Letterman has been for the past 4-5 years, he just wants to come on TV and do his thing until he gets tired."

I'm drawing a blank as to other classic examples but I remember Artie Lange and Olivia Munn had a weird sort of chemistry going on on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon back in 2009. And Howard Stern stuck around for Rickles on Letterman last month which was entertaining if you don't mind just watching old guys riff.

Obviously he's not necessarily a ""conservative pundit"" anymore but the absurdity/naivety of that character has carried through into bits like the theme song writing thing he did the other day. Probably has a lot to do with the fact that he's kept most of the same writers from The Report.

That's probably true, but that's pretty much inevitable when you're dealing with an established genre of television/entertainment of any sort. Carson picked up the Tonight Show not that long after television itself was starting up, so anything he did that moved the genre beyond just sitting down and talking to people was considered creative and revolutionary, and set the standard. He also had thirty years to cover a lot of ground - now there's only so far you can deviate from what he did until it becomes a different type of show entirely."

He's right in saying that he'd put it on the record numerous times that he wasn't after Letterman's gig, but by all accounts the rider in his contract was real, and there was just something off about the lack of recognition he got (from Dave as well as the network) for the ten years he did on the Late Late Show. Not to mention having Leno on as his final guest."

If anything it's a clash of styles - Leno is quick with the one liners, CK is going for something more conceptual."
talkshows,38vwbq,xayzer,5,Sun Jun 7 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"Louis gets more points for style, definitely. He still got KO'd."
talkshows,38vwbq,ciberaj,9,Sun Jun 7 18:11:33 2015 UTC,I think the difference is that Louis probably thought of that joke before going to the show and Leno thought it out of the blue.
talkshows,38vwbq,demonkobra,0,Sun Jun 7 23:43:22 2015 UTC,nope. Leno throws down a constant stream of good insults but the fact of the matter is Jay Leno looks like a cartoon and theres no insult Leno can say to match that basic truth

talkshows,38k2f6,omarciddo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:12:04 2015 UTC,This makes all the sense in the world. Hip hop is Fallon's thing now (and you can't compete with The Roots in that respect) and it would have been near impossible to put together a big blues/rock band with anything like the credibility of Shaffer's crew. The only other genre which makes sense (that can handle the big marquee sound of an 11:30 talk show) is New Orleans jazz (of course I say that 100% based on hindsight). It also kind of fits with Colbert's character - I know South Carolina isn't quite Louisiana but the point is he's not just about New York.  I was holding out for Elvis Costello as a slim possibility but Jon Batiste is the next best thing. He and Colbert really hit it off when he performed on the Report.

talkshows,37lsnx,Sumthingorother,3,Thu May 28 16:04:35 2015 UTC,Part of the issue is that they decided to go with the same venue for the new show. It's a standalone theater. It's not like 30 Rock where there's likely a spare studio to set up shop while your predecessor is still on the air. So tearing down and installing the new set takes a fair amount of time.

And to Lena Dunham's suggestion of Retta hosting the late show...seriously--10,000 tweets? How about we compare Retta's 305k followers to Colbert's 7.89M if we're going to talk about Twitter. I know this isn't so much a discussion that Colbert shouldn't be hosting, but rather that a woman or minority should be, but it's impossible to look at those independently. I love the Colbert hire, and him being a white male...is the same hire every other network has been a part of for their late night lineup. Not just CBS"
talkshows,37ki8k,Frankie_Carbone,-1,Thu May 28 13:32:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's less that they had a problem with specific hiring choices (she called Colbert a genius) and more that when these jobs are continually filled by men the question has to continue to be asked. They're questioning it as a symptom, not so much the individual choices as causing the problem. It's a conversation that's been going on for a long time and nothing seems to be changing."
talkshows,37ki8k,elementalist467,4,Fri May 29 00:35:10 2015 UTC,Colbert had the notable advantage of coming from a show of similar format.  Letterman himself honed his hosting chops following up Carson.  Joan Rivers was given a shot going up against Carson and fell flat and seldom have chances like that been taken since.  This also ignores that Comedy Central has bucked the trend with Larry Wilmore in Colbert's old time slot and Trevor Noah's upcoming run at hosting The Daily Show.  TDS is Comedy Central's flagship program and they were willing to step outside the white male comfort zone.  You are more than likely going to have to see hosts succeed in other comparable venues before they are given a shot at the Tonight Show or the Late Show.  Stephen Colbert is 51 so he is likely looking at a 10 to 20 year run at the program if things go well.  Jimmy Fallon is 40 so he could do the job for 30 years if the network lets him.   The flagship late night shows are not likely to turn over anytime soon.
talkshows,37ki8k,elementalist467,2,Fri May 29 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"I agree - in each case I think the networks try to make the best choice they can for themselves (though we'll never know for sure what their reasoning is). I also agree that hosting a talk show is different from being on ""the comedy circuit"" overall. I think the point though is that it's a symptom of long-term sexism that there aren't that many women in comparable formats ready to feed in to the flagship programs (Joan Rivers was lucky enough to have guest-hosted Carson for a long time). These things take time, but what causes the change over time is people asking questions like this.  For what it's worth I think Ellen would make a great host of one of the flagships at some point down the track, though that ship might have sailed for a while now."
talkshows,37ki8k,Glsbnewt,5,Fri May 29 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"Ellen is a fun host, but her style is very much adapted to appeal to a daytime audience.

Are there women and people of color who are as qualified? I'd say so, but Colbert should be near the top of any shortlist for that kind of job.  However, when it comes to James Corden, that's not the same situation. That's a situation where he was put in a spot when there were countless women and people of color more qualified than him that were passed over."
talkshows,37ki8k,EdgarsTeethAreDry,1 point,Thu May 28 22:35:43 2015 UTC,Colbert basically stepped up to the big leagues after showing he could perform.

Prior to Kaufman, no-one else had ever gone on live television and made people (viewers, hosts, etc) question if what they'd just watched was scripted or not.

talkshows,37eff7,btcprox,2,Wed May 27 00:55:12 2015 UTC,I like to think of him as a nice inside joke to those who actually know his style of humour pre-LLS. Find it amusing how his absurdist humour can fly over the audience's heads :P

I thought it would be a great transition into Colbert and a good send off for Letterman if CBS aired the top Late Show's from Letterman's era. CBS is airing a lot of reruns this summer (except for their summer shows: Under the Dome, a new reality show, Big Brother and Extant mid to late summer). But again, what do I know?

As a kid I would do anything I could to be able to stay up to watch Late Night all through the 80's. I was supremely bummed when he didn't get the Tonight Show. Somehow David Letterman had created something new and original. For me and my friends having watched the night before we were all in on the new joke or funny thing/saying, it was like being part of a special club. Leno never was able to create that, sorry but it is true. Letterman somehow surfed the wave that was all of the jizz that was created by the comedy boom, all the musings of Mad magazine and the improv folks like Second City and the Groundlings, somehow David Letterman fit in there....... Jay Leno did not. Dave was our guy, Leno was a Doritos shilling sell out, a saccharine mouthpiece for the establishment."

There's a TV monitor on Letterman's desk, and an (ugly?) indent on the desk for the microphone.  Tiny chunk of the desk is missing. I wonder what happened.   Dave actually built this stupid box to hold his stupid phone. It has no drawers, no other functions, nothing.   Tons of microfibers to create light for cityscape. Jack Hannah forgot some of his birds  Guest entrance with full length mirror, some toy cars above it. Dave can easily see if they are ready. Not sure how a camel or some other big stuff fit thru here  Behold the several backdrops here. The other cityscape. Something velvet. Something ugly pink. Something green.   Secret doorway behind the band  This ladder actually leads to the sound guys' HUGE space on the 2nd floor; while these stairs are for all the lights. They are connected.  Downstairs viewers have at least 16 floor or ceiling mounted TVs; upstairs viewers have 2 TVs. I counted 2 applause signs downstairs and 3 upstairs.  Boards put up to make studio look less cramped. It's not aligned and perhaps intentionally look out of place.   This artwork at the outside hallway greats audience when they come in. Can be viewed as far from Dave's desk.   More easter eggs?"

talkshows,36rxo7,chathamhouserules,2,Thu May 21 17:16:00 2015 UTC,My favourite review so far - you can always tell when the writer knows what they're talking about.
talkshows,36sd2f,drumersrule,11,Thu May 21 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"Here's a copy-paste of a comment I left on /r/television (edit: not /r/letterman):   I recently saw it described by one of the people he influenced (I forget who) in the following way: Johnny Carson had the show. David Letterman created the anti-show.   That's what it's all about, really. Larry ""Bud"" Melman, the Monkey Cam, the stupid Top Ten lists (e.g. ""top ten words that almost rhyme with peas""), throwing shit from the top of a five-story tower, the numerous something-suits he wore... and on CBS Rupert Jee, Stephanie Birkitt, the fake Stump The Band, Will It Float, all that stuff, it was all the anti-show.  Dave's comedic sensibility was so popular exactly because he was a subversive force. He was extremely aware of the format's expectations and conventions, and he played with them. He was extremely aware of how stupid and unnecessary the whole idea of a talk show is, and he wasn't afraid to acknowledge that fact whenever possible and by the way, this ultra-awareness is exactly what Norm MacDonald brought to Weekend Update, and that's a big part of why people loved him so much.  The bits I mentioned above were funny, but the bits were not the innovation. Dave's real innovation was the subversive and cynical way he understood his own role as a host and the role of his show (and shows like his) in popular culture - and that is what people are talking about when they talk about Dave's legacy."
talkshows,36sd2f,ifauve,8,Thu May 21 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"Do you know how easy it is to find the answers to this question?  http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/01/exclusive-conan-obrien-david-letterman  http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/david-letterman-broke-latenight-tv-1201499877/  http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/david-letterman-year-one-20110929 (behind paywall)  https://www.yahoo.com/tv/david-letterman-late-show-legacy-review-119442825350.html  http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/david-lettermans-long-shadow/393707/  In addition to reading however much of that you need to, watch some old late night or almost any old TV. Notice the reverence and all the showbiz importance and compare that to now, where every TV personality is snarky and acting like they don't want to be there. Letterman has a hell of a lot to do with that. Watch his old shows and see how experimental and weird they still are (the monkey camera was just an example, it doesn't come down to putting a camera on a monkey, that wasn't the basis of Late Night). Watch him in any era and notice how much more real and honest he is (the Fergusons and the Conans who are also on the ""realer"" side will tell you how important Dave is). Dave changed how a host is supposed to act, and opened up late night to worlds of experimentation.   When a million comedians tell you they're influenced by a guy, they were. You don't have to doubt them just so you can have a hot take. There's a reason why Dave's retirement is being treated as way bigger than the Lenos and Regis' of the world."
talkshows,36sd2f,EdgarsTeethAreDry,2,Thu May 21 20:50:12 2015 UTC,Until this comment I didn't realize how much more talked about and important Dave's retirement was vs. Leno's.

He's pretty quick and his interviews are much more watchable than Fallon. Letterman was Kimmel's idol so I'm not surprised his show has that same feeling as the 80s Late Nights. He also likes to make non actors into regulars á la Rupert Jee or Biff Henderson.
talkshows,36q8z2,MsModernity,3,Thu May 21 07:57:54 2015 UTC,Yeah.  That's pretty much what one of Letterman's producers said in this article.  I'll probably give Kimmel a try.
talkshows,36q8z2,gigasteelbyter,3,Thu May 21 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"Conan and Kimmel are currently two of the only late night hosts I watch now that Dave is gone. Every now and then I tune into James Corden, when I have the time.  But I'm seriously excited for Colbert's Late Show. He may not be as classic as Dave, but he definitely is one of the very few people that can pull it off."
talkshows,36q8z2,chathamhouserules,2,Thu May 21 08:59:30 2015 UTC,"Right.  I used to like Conan when he was at NBC, but his show seems to have lost something since going to TBS.  His some of his remotes are still funny, but his guests and the overall show seemed to go downhill.  I'm also really excited for Colbert's show.  I have no idea what to expect."
talkshows,36q8z2,fintrabuji,2,Thu May 21 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"Easy does it - he's still airing on the West coast!  That said, this is a good question. Assuming we're ignoring timeslots, I'd say Conan's show is probably the most similar of the current bunch to what Dave's Late Night was like (weird to think Conan is old school now). Kimmel could be considered a good option too, for those who miss Dave's snark.  Personally, I can't wait till September for Colbert to move in to the Ed Sullivan Theatre - I think he has the potential to be the closest thing to a real successor in terms of pure comedic talent and also the ability to add a bit of gravitas to the mix."

He played that character in Spinal Tap as Artie Fufkin, he played that character on SNL as Don Kirshner, and I think when he got his camera time on Letterman, he resorted to that old show biz character with his, ""You're Fabulous,"" cool cat schtick. I'm sure some found that off putting.  I thought Paul was awesome myself. Amazing musician, funny guy, he had it all. He did an interview with Gilbert Gottfried on his podcast a month or so ago.

talkshows,36qgv0,sedgwickian,6,Thu May 21 15:48:18 2015 UTC,"/u/HeyMySock and /u/sedgwickian nailed it. He's first and foremost a musician and entertainer, whereas Andy Richter or Steve Higgins are comedians, so they support their respective hosts in a different fashion. People who ask ""what's funny"" about him seem to expect him to be doing material, which is just not what his persona is about.  As far as the interjections go, I can understand how they'd seem a bit weird to someone new to the show. All I know is once you watch enough Letterman you barely notice them any more (it's going to be a while till I can switch to past tense). They become part of the background noise, part of the rhythm of the joke. Listen to Dave do a monologue without Paul and you'll notice he has to play off the audience a lot more, which makes him either slow things to a halt or start to rush if things start to falter. After 33 years Paul just became part of his natural speaking pattern."
talkshows,36qgv0,chathamhouserules,6,Thu May 21 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"The monolog and the time just after when Dave is at his desk, especially when Dave is at his desk, have always seemed to be more a conversation between Dave and Paul more so than Dave and the audience. How many times has Paul got a laugh after a joke bombed with a well timed, ""Ha!"" Many many times.  Dave definitely bounces (bounced? I can't believe we speak of them in the past tense now) off of Paul. Those two are (were) a pair."
talkshows,36qgv0,HeyMySock,5,Thu May 21 16:51:34 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Paul and Dave had an amazing chemistry.  Both were amazing entertainers on their own, and when they click together, nobody is better.    I also think that the funniest moments that I've seen on Fallon's show have been when he and Higgins start improvising.  On the other hand, I always thought that Conan and Andy had a weird relationship, with Andy not really adding that much to the show.  Just my opinion."
talkshows,36qgv0,octogazelle,6,Thu May 21 18:03:45 2015 UTC,You're right. Only someone without a clue about the show's dynamics would think Paul talks too much. Its a running gag when Paul keeps talking about something and Dave starts to act like he wants Paul to shut up.

talkshows,366zxk,mcraamu,6,Sat May 16 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"Some favorites:  Letterman's last episode of ""Late Night"" is a pretty good representation of why that show was so good. Plus, Tom Hank's interview is classic. You can see it here.  Also, of course, the Madonna interview from 1994 is classic. It'll remind you how biting and sharp-witted Letterman once was in interviews.  There was also a few weeks one summer in the 1980s (1987?) where there was a writer's strike. So instead of having a monologue and comedy sketches, the monologue would be a single joke (written by Letterman himself) and then they would put a camera in a laundromat or some other place and Letterman would just talk to people. It was out of this that Rupert Gee and Mujibar and Sirajul were born, but the original summer of those was done out of desparation and they were oftentimes hilarious.  But really, the greatest episode of Letterman was the first episode back after 9/11. Nobody else on television, I don't think, really captured the thoughts and feelings of Americans at that time. Plus seeing Dan Rather just break down sobbing was really something else. I don't care if you are a big fan of him or not.   That was what has always made Letterman great. He knows how to talk to people. And for better or worse, he's always been honest with is audience. From the beginning, he was less a comedian, and more a guy who happened to tell jokes and talk about his life."

talkshows,35t4c6,chathamhouserules,3,Wed May 13 07:52:06 2015 UTC,"Letterman is a 100% professional entertainer. I remember an interview with Charlie Rose in the 90s where he said: These people come from all over the US (sometimes even from outside the US) into the Ed Sullivan theater so it is his duty to make them feel welcomed and very entertained - if didnt he achieve that, he failed his job as a show host.  You notice that for example during the monologe of Letterman, because he always looks at the audience and not so much into the camera. Also Letterman always incorporates a story from an audience member into the show (often even into the Top-10-List), that only the audience in the theater understands but not the viewer at home - and that is perfectly fine, because it adds to the athmosphere for the viewer at home.  One of the many reasons for Lettermans success is his deep respect for his audience. All the greats in broadcasting have this respect."

If ejaculation is onto the other person's face it can be called a facial. Such ejaculation can be done by mammary intercourse, or masturbation over the other person, or result from the withdrawal of the penis from a partner's mouth as he is ejaculating following fellatio, irrumatio, or intercourse.   The term pearl necklace is used by some because the drops of semen deposited by the man resemble a necklace of translucent white pearls.    Making a pearl necklace is one of the activities that sex workers use as safe sex alternatives for people who refuse to wear condoms.

talkshows,35ouyb,realStarPlayer,2,Tue May 12 08:27:35 2015 UTC,"1:53  There's our confirmation; no Jay.  Also, it really pleases me to hear Dave praise Andy Kaufman in this clip. Andy was one of my favorite performers of all time; I've made several references to him in this sub in the past month alone."

talkshows,35o1zo,chathamhouserules,2,Tue May 12 02:01:32 2015 UTC,I would love this.
talkshows,35m4e6,realStarPlayer,3,Mon May 11 17:07:03 2015 UTC,Chelsea has cited Russell Brand as her worst guest.
talkshows,35m4e6,2tonGordhead,3,Mon May 11 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"I kind of hate/like them both, so it was fun to watch them be assholes towards each other."
talkshows,35m4e6,emreka,2,Mon May 11 18:52:56 2015 UTC,Russel Brand is brilliant but I can only make out one third of what he says.

talkshows,35kzs1,yogurty,2,Mon May 11 10:35:57 2015 UTC,Great post. Very interesting to hear the submission guidelines for Colbert. And Kimmel sure is speaking a lot of sense these days.
talkshows,35l4pv,chathamhouserules,2,Mon May 11 11:47:16 2015 UTC,Now if only the uploader wasn't intent on bashing us over the head with his interpretation of what's going on this would be a pretty good clip.
talkshows,35jcez,redpayaso,11,Sun May 10 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"It's definitely more of a fault with James' interviewing skills rather than the multi-guest format. Graham Norton uses the same format to a much better degree, and everyone seems to love his show.  It seems to me that on Graham's show, the guests often interact with each other, whereas on The Late Late Show its almost as if each guest just sits there waiting for their turn to be asked something by James."
talkshows,35jcez,realStarPlayer,2,Sun May 10 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"I think it engenders a certain kind of conversation, though - there's a reason Norton's guests are always people in entertainment, where you don't really need to hone in on a topic for long before you move on. Norton is definitely better at getting that interaction between guests going but it's never the same type of conversation you'd have one-on-one.  As far as OP's question, Corden is the only one doing this in the States, and most people seem to like it, so I can't imagine he'll be switching it up any time soon. It does make me hopeful that the network is maybe giving Colbert some space to hold more serious conversations, but who knows?"
talkshows,35jcez,chathamhouserules,2,Mon May 11 01:58:29 2015 UTC,"You probably forget that little show called What What Happens Live which pride themselves for their very unique guests match-ups, and also real alcohol on set"
talkshows,35jcez,yogurty,1 point,Mon May 11 10:50:33 2015 UTC,"Andy Cohen, right? I've never actually seen it. But you did just remind me of a clip to post!"
talkshows,35jcez,chathamhouserules,1 point,Mon May 11 11:30:26 2015 UTC,"Well Graham gives his guests drinks and there really is no bars heald on his show, leaving the guests more relaxed and to feel like themselves.  However, with FCC censorship and guidelines it's against the rules for the consumption of real alcohol to be seen on camera and the obvious swearing.   In Britain in regards to censorship they're more relaxed with censorship."
talkshows,35jcez,TheKooze,4,Mon May 11 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that about the FCC guidelines. You mean to say that every time I've seen a late-night host/guest drink alcohol in recent years, it's been fake?"
talkshows,35jcez,realStarPlayer,2,Mon May 11 03:29:05 2015 UTC,"I know Dave, as a recovering alcoholic, replaces spirits with apple juice or something similar for bits which require him to drink, but I don't think there are any overarching regulations on the subject."
talkshows,35jcez,chathamhouserules,1 point,Mon May 11 09:10:54 2015 UTC,"More than likely, yes. In shows as well. Whiskey is like apple juice, wine/champagne sparkling juice, beer in bottles is most likely water...etc."
talkshows,35jcez,TheKooze,6,Mon May 11 05:28:53 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. If everyone is supposed to think it's alcohol, what does it matter if it is?"
talkshows,35jcez,jabask,1 point,Mon May 11 07:56:59 2015 UTC,I know that the justified cast said that the bourbon on the show was diet coke mixed with water.  Apparently it's a union thing.
talkshows,35jcez,atlatl1,3,Wed May 13 03:59:05 2015 UTC,Can confirm Today Show and Watch What Happens Live uses real alcohol.  For some shows it's customary to load up guests with alcohol in the green room before cameras.  Kelly Ripa always look wasted at 9am. Don't think it's coffee in that mug.
talkshows,35jcez,yogurty,2,Mon May 11 11:14:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't think this is true. There's a voluntary code of conduct that expired in 1983 that advises against showing ""drunkenness"", and some networks will avoid advertising alcohol as part of a general commitment to not advertise ""vice"" like gambling or tobacco, but there's no actual FCC regulations prohibiting it.  Watch the orgy of inebriation that is the fourth hour of the Today Show and tell me that's not real alcohol."
talkshows,35jcez,chathamhouserules,1 point,Mon May 11 09:07:38 2015 UTC,It's only against FCC regs to consume alcohol in a commercial.  Wanda Sykes used to serve real drinks.
talkshows,35jcez,StrangeCrimes,4,Mon May 11 11:54:36 2015 UTC,I actually like the change of format from the norm here in americas talk shows. I don't think he is the greatest interviewer so this kinda disguises that.
talkshows,35jcez,_TomEE_,2,Sun May 10 23:09:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I like James, more than the other hosts of late night, but Craig had the best interviews by far, so in some way I'm comparing James to Craig, and being a bit disappointed."
talkshows,35jcez,oldmanjoe,2,Mon May 11 19:04:57 2015 UTC,He sits too close to them In my opinion. Sounds silly I know but it really bothers me.
talkshows,35hefr,chathamhouserules,5,Sun May 10 11:36:12 2015 UTC,The comments on this article are terrifyingly stupid

talkshows,35ggly,realStarPlayer,3,Sun May 10 02:56:16 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. I had no clue. I knew Ray was a standup comedian, I just didn't know the details. At the time when ELR became a show, RR was a nobody (in my eye). So for that show to take off. I could hear it in Ray's voice. That was really touching."
talkshows,35ggly,jaxspider,2,Sun May 10 06:37:29 2015 UTC,How did Ray Romano get more attractive
talkshows,35fyin,realStarPlayer,2,Sat May 9 23:50:53 2015 UTC,A great 'Stump the Band' segment. Teri is a character and her husband is a great sport!
talkshows,35bspg,realStarPlayer,10,Fri May 8 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly if the real show was a little closer to this tone I personally would enjoy watching it. It's so relaxed, casual, less presentation oriented. Honestly it was funny too. Really funny."
talkshows,35bspg,TheFaceofRay,9,Fri May 8 23:44:06 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Craig Ferguson's show had that feel to it.
talkshows,35bspg,TheFaceofRay,8,Fri May 8 23:45:49 2015 UTC,"Craig's interviews were unmatched. So casual and natural. I loved Craig's show. It was relaxed in a way no other late night show was.  But this clip of Jimmy felt like I was hanging out with friends. Ragging on each other, running into the room to startle the writers, even the pace was so comfortable. I like Jimmy. His show is not for me, but I like him well enough. But if a late night show now managed to capture this vibe, almost the way Craig did, they would have me hooked."
