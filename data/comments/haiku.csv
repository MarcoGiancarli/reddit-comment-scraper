haiku,3dkjo1,acradianburn,3,Fri Jul 17 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"An impressive Haiku. Although it doesn't highlight the concrete imagery that can make Haiku so powerful, the syntax plays with the language in a delightful way, which makes your poem feel original! You did a great job of hiding the form: allowing the poem to express itself through haiku rather than haiku through form! Thank you for sharing!"
haiku,3dkjo1,spooks_apprentice,2,Fri Jul 17 02:08:21 2015 UTC,Agreed. I appreciated the metaphor though.

haiku,3dffxd,that_name_is_taken,2,Wed Jul 15 21:13:39 2015 UTC,Excellent. This one gave me a chill -- the good kind of chill. I have watched specks of dust floating and landing. Sometimes their slow aimlessness seems to taunt us. You've captured that. Thanks.
