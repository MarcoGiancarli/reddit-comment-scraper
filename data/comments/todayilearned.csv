todayilearned,3c9g98,mesostoney,first class kids are diffrent.
todayilearned,3c9g98,SheroQuinkan,"It's an unlimited first class ticket, the person they're kicking off is already in first class. They're not getting an upgrade, just bumped to a later flight. You might find someone who doesn't care, but I think the majority of the time, most first class people are going to be less than pleased."
todayilearned,3c9g98,NovaDeez,There are lots of times an employee of the airline is seated in first class flying non-revenue if not all the seats are claimed. They can be asked to move if a hotshot needs to make it on a plane. Source: Former AA employee who was relegated from first to coach on several flights.
todayilearned,3c9g98,HideousPride,"I've heard this too. I have a cousin who works as a stewardess and she says on big flights, a few seats are always reserved in first class for hotshots making emergency trips."
todayilearned,3c9g98,definitely-maeby,"They ask for volunteers and offer compensation. If no one takes them up on it, they have to pay the person who gets bumped $1,400 $1,300."
todayilearned,3c9g98,like_2_watch,Which is probably chump change to someone who flies first class regularly.
todayilearned,3c9g98,Komaeiki,"Usually they offer compensation on top of the ticket.  For economy they offer an upgraded ticket plus a couple hundred bucks with the airline, so for a first class bump they'd probably offer another first class ticket, free room if needed at the hotel and a grand or more of airline credit or a second first class ticket another time.  You'll generally find someone willing to take that deal."
todayilearned,3c9g98,corsairofdoom,"Exactly. When they overbooked the last leg of my flight home, they offered a seat on the next flight, a meal in the terminal, and an airfare voucher worth more than my entire trip. Total cost to me was a three hour delay in the terminal."
todayilearned,3c9g98,rivalarrival,Nobody who paid for a first class seat is being preempted. Every airline holds back some F inventory until the last minute that either goes to very expensive revenue tickets or elite upgrades.

todayilearned,3c9g98,Woodshadow,"I was once flying home from West Virginia and the flight attendants told me that the flight was ""overweight"".

This was maybe 2 weeks after Christmas."
todayilearned,3c9g98,PM_ME_UR_SIDEBOOOB,"I was traveling home from college so it was pretty heavy travel dates. Christmas, beginning of summer, etc. They just announce a travel voucher for taking a different flight and I would literally run to the booth for it. Usually Southwest Airlines."
todayilearned,3c9g98,Energy_Turtle,"Since the ticket is an 'unlimited first class ticket', wouldn't they have to remove someone from first class anyways?"
todayilearned,3c9g98,ShitGuysItsTheCops,Yes. People on reddit don't like to use their brains.
todayilearned,3c9g98,idwoof,"It's not like he'd just show up at the gate to a full airplane and throw someone off. It would happen the way it does a 1000 times a day already. \n\nThey announce that the plane is over sold and offer $XXX to step off the flight and take a later one. If no one takes that, they up the offer. If no one takes that, they may up the offer again. Usually then they just call out a name of the person with the lowest fare ticket, have them come to the podium and explain that they've been bumped. Then it depends a little on individual airlines' policies, but there are rights you have. \n\nMost of the time they give you a flight voucher equal to your flight. Then if things fall outside a certain window you get 200% the value and other things."
todayilearned,3c9g98,Shtruntz,I was on a flight a couple weeks ago that was overbooked and they ended up offering a $1000 voucher to anyone willing to take it. I was tempted if I wasn't flying to an airport 2 hours from where we were staying.

todayilearned,3c9g98,usernamesarethebane,"I don't think you understand how expensive private airplanes are, not only in initial purchase costs, but also in keeping it up and running.\n\nMy company has multiple airplanes. Our cheapest plane costs us $3500/hr to fly, and that jet alone was $19,000,000 or so. I don't know how much maintenance is, but I'm going to go with ""astronomically high"" just like everything else in the industry.\n\nSure, they could buy a cheaper airplane and fly it themselves, but let's be honest, that's not going to happen in 99% of cases where someone has a private plane. At least not for business aviation."
todayilearned,3c9g98,bg-j38,"I was recently getting a tour of a major airline's maintenance hub. They were working on an A320 and were ready to take it out to test it. I asked what the route they were going to fly was and they told me that for most things they don't actually fly. They take the plane out to a remote part of the airport, lock it down, and put the engines up to full thrust. But there's some things that require a quick flight to test. For a test flight that only lasts about 15 minutes it costs them about $35,000."
todayilearned,3c9g98,usernamesarethebane,"Yeah, I work in the business side -- the commercial side costs are mind-blowing to me.\n\nI don't know about their side, but I know on our side, planes don't just go down for a day for maintenance: they go down for a month when they go down. Can you imagine if your car was at the mechanic for a month? That would be incredibly expensive. Now imagine that you're paying that month-long maintenance bill on something like a Koenigsegg. Then multiply that by some number I don't even want to think of."
todayilearned,3c9g98,bg-j38,My friend who was showing me around told me that it depends on what they're doing to the aircraft. Can be anywhere from 5 days to a month. But yeah. There were a couple planes that were slated to be there for a long time. This was United's big maintenance facility at SFO btw. The scale of the operation was pretty mind blowing. And it's not just the planes they work on. He took me out to this lot and there were like a couple dozen engines waiting to be worked on. Just.. massive.
todayilearned,3c9g98,Rhawk187,"I got an advertisement from Delta for private flying and it was $6,000 an hour, so at that price you could get 500 hours of private flying and not have to worry about the insurance/upkeep/pilot of the plane."

todayilearned,3c9g98,itwasmeornot,a lot of wealthy people will share a private plane as its costly to keep one up yourself.

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness\n\n~Terry Pratchett"

todayilearned,3c9g98,darkangelazuarl,He booked flights under fake names such as “Bag Rothstein” if he didn’t know who his companion would be — a practice that the airline later used to accuse him of fraud.\n\n\nThis is the only mention the article has of fake names and it was for his companion pass if he didn't know who his companion would be.  This probably isn't the way to do it but AA doesn't just let you put To be determined as the name either.  It looks like AA was just looking for a reason to terminate his pass due to the expense they were incurring.
todayilearned,3c9g98,headzoo,"The marketing ploy turned out to be a major mistake for the airline. What went wrong?\n\nSimply put, several people who bought the “AAirpass” did exactly what we would have done with a “golden ticket” of unlimited lifetime travel: they went crazy.\n\n“They started flying everywhere, all the time. They’d pick random people out of the check-in line and give them free first-class upgrades,” writes Cory Doctorow Boing Boing.\n\n“They’d fly to Japan for lunch and back to the States that night. One of them was costing the airline more than $1,000,000 a year,” he adds.\n\nHow did the airline react to expensive “AAirpass” owners? The company got mean.\n\n“The airline decided to get rid of them. They put private eyes and internal investigators on them. They sued. They extorted passengers who’d flown on companion tickets for confessions that they’d paid for the ‘gift,’ and froze their frequent flier accounts, saying they’d only restore them once the passengers fessed up,” Doctorow writes.\n\nMen who were once treated like kings by the airline found themselves the target of investigations and lawsuits.\n\n\nAmerican Airlines Once Offered Unlimited First-Class Tickets for Life — and Then People Started Using Them…"

These people are taking a seat that often wasn't booked, or bumping an employee of the airline who was using that unbooked seat. Sure there will be some booked seats bumped, but those aren't terribly expensive to the airline to handle.\n\nAll of the costs in this article & OP's are more like 'lost revenue', but of course it wouldn't really be available to them if not for these tickets. I'll bet most of those lifetime ticket sales were profitable (but the revenue is up front, so of course the airlines will look to void them later on technicalities)."

todayilearned,3c9g98,PRNmeds,Exactly this! They allegedly wouldn't have cared if he brought a real person with a real name on every single flight. The cost would've been exactly the same. Total bullshit.
todayilearned,3c9g98,CIKAFIUMPH,The article says he often flew hopeless strangers home so it's not like they weren't always used.\n\nHe used the fake names because he had a companion pass and didn't know who he was going to bring.
todayilearned,3c9g98,quasifun,"One of the reasons that the airlines started cancelling these lifetime tickets is that some of the guys were using their companion pass to ferry people on transatlantic flights, first class, for hire.  So these guys would fly somebody with them on a companion pass, and then get right back on the same plane and fly back to the US."
todayilearned,3c9g98,PM_Me_Randomly,"Well, unless the ticket somehow forbid that, I don't see how it's a problem. I mean, maybe the whole idea was dumb to begin with, but once you've sold the service, you shouldn't be allowed to get out of just because you realised it was dumb."
todayilearned,3c9g98,adrianmonk,"unless the ticket somehow forbid that\n\n\nThis gets fairly involved, but an LA Times article has a ton of good info.\n\nIn particular, it links to a copy of the letter they gave Rothstein, which states that ""speculative bookings are considered invalid ... under Section 12 of the Agreement"". So according to the airline, this was forbidden in the contract.\n\nRead the text of the contract and decide for yourself.\n\nNote that Section 11 of the contract says ""such travel is is subject to American's Rules Tariff as in effect at the time of travel"", which presumably means he has to follow all the rules listed here. This rule in particular is probably what they were referring to:\n\nUNLESS PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS RECEIVED, AMERICAN\nAIRLINES PROHIBITS THE PRACTICE OF CONFIRMING\nRESERVATIONS AS FOLLOWS:\n(A)  FRAUDULENT, FICTITIOUS AND ABUSIVE\n     RESERVATIONS -\n     THESE TYPES OF RESERVATIONS ARE DEFINED AS\n     ANY RESERVATION MADE WITHOUT HAVING BEEN\n     REQUESTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE NAMED\n     PASSENGER.  ADDITIONALLY, CREATING\n     RESERVATIONS TO HOLD OR BLOCK SEATS FOR THE\n     PURPOSE OF OBTAINING LOWER FARES, AADVANTAGE\n     AWARD INVENTORY, OR UPGRADES THAT MAY NOT\n     OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE OR TO CIRCUMVENT ANY\n     OF AMERICAN AIRLINES' FARE RULES OR POLICIES\n     IS PROHIBITED.\n\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but making a reservation without having a specific person in mind (or in the name of a non-existent person) sounds like it would violate this rule."
todayilearned,3c9g98,hkbenlui,Exactly
todayilearned,3c9g98,random_bananas,"As far as I remember from the last time this popped up, nowhere in the contract did it say that they couldn't do what they were doing, so I don't see a problem with that, they payed a decent amount of money for their lifetime tickets (in 2014 Dollars: $512868 plus $307720 for his companion ticket)."
todayilearned,3c9g98,Destrina,"If it was in their contract not to do that, that's fine.  If there was nothing in the contract about not selling the service to a third party, then fuck the airlines."

todayilearned,3c7rh6,pissedoffnobody,"A lot of people don't know what Scientologists believe.  I will tell you.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard is the founder of Scientology.\n\nHubbard wrote fiction for many years, and published stories in some of the most popular magazines of the era. During that time, Hubbard began researching in psychology and psychiatry-like methods. He was playing mind games. He eventually wrote a book about it, called Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health\n\nDianetics is the name of the technique Hubbard gave his work. He was using ""Dianetics"" when he used these specific techniques to play with the human mind. Dianetics deals with the mind, and the mind is a physical thing. Some people began using Dianetics, and eventually became fanatics. After all, Dianetics was a best-seller at the time, and was one of the very first self-help books. These fanatic formed a religion around the works and writings of L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Scientology\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_in_the_United_States\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_in_Canada\n\nWhen Hubbard assumed that he was dealing with spiritual problems instead of purely mental ones, he realized that his self-help techniques were healing people of their spiritual ills. Thus, Scientology was born, given a new name to reflect a more accurate description of his work. He also wanted to scam the government for taxes, and since churches don't have to pay taxes he claimed that Scientology was a religion. Since it dealt with the spirit and not just the mind, Scientology was deemed a religion by a few of the world's governments, and in some countries they don't have to pay taxes.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_controversies\n\nHubbard was a wise con man, and he knew what he was doing. He kept writing more books and recording more incoherent lectures on cassette tapes. These were to be his teachings, and Scientology uses them like Bibles. The technique of Hubbard is sacred, and his writings are the teachings of his technique, etc etc.\n\nSo, what do they believe? Well... those spiritual problems I talked about are the very core of their beliefs. Also, memories.\n\nThey believe you have two parts to your mind. The Analytical Mind, the one that uses reasoning and works sort of like a computer, being logical. The other part is the Reactive Mind, where subconscious thoughts are stored and recorded, which can later be recalled through what Scientologists call ""auditing"", which means to listen. Talk therapy, essentially. Also considered spiritual counseling by Scientologists.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_mind\n\nAnyway, the brain can record negative thoughts in the Reactive Mind and have a negative impact on your life. What they don't tell the public, or the people who have not climbed the church's levels (by taking auditing courses), is that these memories are often implanted memories. Implanted by aliens in another life time, in another part of the galaxy. This is where the Xenu story you hear about comes into action. Xenu, who was an intergalactic ruler, killed many people by dropping atomic bombs in volcanoes. Then, the spirits of these alien beings, also called ""Thetans"" by Scientology, roam the earth. They can cling to your body, and those are called Body Thetans, or BTs in Scientology jargon. These BTs can cluster, and then you have many, many infected alien spirits trying to harm you or causing pain in your life. You can use auditing to rid yourself of these evil spirits, who are basically Scientology's version of demons.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditing_%28Scientology%29\n\nThey do this to become a state of ""clear"".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_%28Scientology%29\n\nScientology has formed many organizations and corporations. They are a big business, and not really a religion at all. Sure, they claim to deal with the spirit, but it is very obvious to anyone that L. Ron Hubbard made up stories about his work. He was a con man, and his friends were all on record saying that he was out to make money.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scientology_organizations\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Scientology_organizations\n\nMany people claim Dianetics and Scientology make them feel better. Maybe it does, but who cares? It's a crazy UFO cult disguising itself as a self-help cult.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera_in_Scientology"
todayilearned,3c7rh6,teklord,"The upsetting thing is right until it gets to the aliens and religious side of things, it seems like it might be helpful for some people. The self help aspect speaks to me. I've never read Dianetics, so I can't speak to the actual procedures, but I'll bet a lot of people who get into Scientology start off as people looking to better themselves, and then the steps along the way just become easier to justify. \n\nI'm not excusing the religion, I still think it's bonkers, but I feel like I have more insight as to what it's all about, and I get it."

Llywelyn later cited Lee's commitment to Scientology as the principal cause for their separation.[38][39] Llywelyn wrote that their relationship collapsed when she revealed to her talent manager and fellow Scientologist, Gay Ribisi, that she had read A Piece of Blue Sky, an anti-Scientology book. Two days after her conversation with Ribisi, Llywelyn subsequently received a one-paragraph ""disconnection letter"" from Lee and was labeled a Suppressive Person.[40]\n\n\nNote that the informer, Gay Ribisi, is the mother of Giovani Ribisi and Marissa Ribisi (who is married to Beck.)

But then they had me do a self test where it asked me a bunch of questions. Upon reading my results, this woman basically told me I was majorly depressed (not entirely false) but then tried to sell me a whole bunch of different books and DVDs and shit that she claimed were the only way for me to get better. These fucking things were like $50 a piece, and I kept trying to politely say no but she kept pushing it. Eventually I got her to let me go but not until agreeing to a follow up appointment the next day which obviously I wasn't going to. So I gave them the info of the upperclassman in my house who made me go to the stupid thing so he would get all their spam email and shit as my petty revenge.\n\nBut yeah my point is that Scientology is a business, nothing more, selling false hope of a better life.

todayilearned,3c7rh6,stansteamer,"The book is much richer and contains more new/exclusive information. He interviewed over 200 Scientologists for the book, from memory the movie only features 3. Highlights from the book include much more information about the week of Hubbard's death, the ongoing wait for Hubbard's reincarnation (complete with suites in various bases kept ready for him, full of his favourite clothes and foods, restocked and cleaned weekly), more stories about Tom Cruise and his benefiting from forced and unpaid labour at Gold Base, a much much larger section about Hubbard's Dianetics days and more analysis of his supposed injuries and medical assessments (Hubbard boasts that the Navy psychiatrist called him ""the most sane man I have ever met"", the Navy says there's zero record of him seeing a psychiatrist), more damning investigation of Hubbard's service record (he claims to have received medals during WW2 that did not exist at the time), more stories about people escaping from Scientology and the use of guns, guards, and pursuit vehicles in keeping members on-grounds, and detail about how the church attempted to interfere with the research.\n\nI really really recommend the book if you were even halfway interested in the documentary. The author is a Pulitzer-winning journalist with an incredible amount of skill; he did amazing amounts of research, conducting over 1500 hours of interviews, submitting hundreds of FOI requests, flying all over the world to dig through archives with legal orders, and he very elegantly and efficiently condenses it into 500 pages, arranging it into a narrative that makes it almost suspenseful without forcing it.\n\nOne of the big conversations I'm sad they left out of the film is Wright's meeting with Tommy Davis, one of the leaders of Sea Org and the Church's official media spokesman 2005-2011. Wright brings up the fact that several of L. Ron Hubbard's supposed war medals did not exist at the time he claimed to receive them, and that one is actually a medal of the British Royal Navy and not the American, and that furthermore, the Navy personnel record for Hubbard does not show him experiencing the injuries he claimed to receive (and heal with proto-Scientology techniques):\n\n\nHis voice filling with emotion, Davis said that if it was true that Hubbard had not been injured, then “the injuries that he handled by the use of Dianetics procedures were never handled, because they were injuries that never existed; therefore, Dianetics is based on a lie; therefore, Scientology is based on a lie.” He concluded: “The fact of the matter is that Mr. Hubbard was a war hero.”"
todayilearned,3c7rh6,MushroomShowroom,I actually think his phony war record was sufficiently covered. People can get copies of it and see what isn't true. I got the idea that basically he was lying every time he opened his mouth. You can't spend a whole movie covering all of those occurences.

The elimination of mosquitoes would have a large impact on many ecosystems around the world.  The article wikipedia references says that all in all, they do play important roles in the arctic.  It also says that quite a few small organisms would lose an important food source if they were eradicated.  It also says that they play a very large role in freshwater ecosystems, and that they pollinate thousands of plants.  However, what the article says about them is that another species would likely fill their nichet hat the plants they pollinate are not important crops, and that people would stand to gain greatly from not having to deal with dangerous diseases.  However, going back to the plants they pollinate, it seems farfetched that a plant species could adapt to losing an important pollinator ( I think it is a fair assumption that a significant number of those quoted thousands specifically require mosquitoes to pollinate them) in time to not go extinct.  Also, for animals that do use mosquitoes as an important food source, how could we be sure that something else would fill mosquitoes niche in time for them not to go extinct, or take a major hit to their population that might affect other species?\n\nIt's also important to note that of the roughly 3,500 mosquito species, only a few hundred bite humans and probably even less transmit dangerous diseases.  And as I said in my orginal comment, to destroy them would be expensive, and would likely cause a lot of collateral damage to non-taget species, considering that probably the easiest way to eliminate them would be to use large ammounts of pesticides.  \n\nAnd finally, wouldn't it be simpler to just try and make better treatments for the diseases that make us especially hate them?\n\nEdit2:  Also, I only know of one study done where mosquitoes are native (or anywhere for that matter) where mosquitoes were reduced and in a control environment,  they were not.  That study showed that birds feeding in the area that was sprayed to control mosquitoes were were able to raise only half as many chicks per nest than in the control.\n\nEdit3:  Spelling.  Also, the article says that mosquitoes in several species of pitcher plants have a symbiotic interaction where mosquito larvae live in the pitcher plant and help process food for them, while the baby mosquitoes have a place to grow up.  I suppose this could be more of a case against pitcher plants rather than for mosquitoes, but still, just another role mosquitoes have."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,RIPGeorgeHarrison,Mosquitos reproduce extremely fast and don't need much prey to continue reproducing. This makes them very hard to completely get rid of.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Telochi,I know that we could probably reduce the population massively on some types of mosquitoes through sterile breeding.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_insect_technique
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Mentally_ill_hippo,Yes they literally have mosquito factories in Brazil to create male mosquitoes that breed but won't produce young. They have actually killed a very large portion of the population. USA currently has a contract with the very same company

todayilearned,3c7fmt,ckingknowledge,"Well they're trying to take a serious chunk out of their numbers in Florida. I heard about the genetically modified males a little while ago but I was surprised to see they were going ahead with trying it so fast, seems like they'd take longer to try and predict the outcome before testing to me. IDK maybe that's just movie science affecting my understanding too much."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,ANGLVD3TH,They are trying to specifically remove a non-native disease vector in Florida.\n\nEdit:  it is always good to make sure a well intentioned plan doesn't have any malicious side effects though.\n\nEdit2: spelling
todayilearned,3c7fmt,RIPGeorgeHarrison,"Eradication of those species most dangerous to humans as a disease vector could be likely, but there's no way anyone could tackle eradicating every and all species of mosquitoes"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,LordOfLove,You don't need to spray. You can eradicate specifically a target species of mosquito by breeding and releasing males of that species that don't produce viable offspring.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Phocks7,"Well then, answer is simple. Breed a superior quality which doesn't feed on human blood. And eliminates other varieties."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,euphemism_illiterate,"A Florida lab is doing something similar; they're creating super attractive male mosquitoes whose offspring will be super weak and thus unlikely to survive. I think they're also looking into making the offspring infertile, like some GM crops."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,mozerdozer,"just to clarify ( as this was on a recent TIL post), it is being done specifically to kill a non-native disease vector species.  Also I think I heard somewhere that there is a species of mosquito that as an adult does not bite humans, but as a larvae eats other mosquito larva."

todayilearned,3c7fmt,lordeddardstark,Also we need something (other than ourselves) to help keep that human pop in check.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,A_Beatle,Patent trolls killed the automated laser turret that would be able to kill hundreds of mosquitos per minute. :/

todayilearned,3c7fmt,backwardsdipthong,the trolls were actually just the only ones to consider the laser-shielded mosquitos this would create by natural selection.\n\nhumanity doesn't stand a chance against the laser-skitos. not one chance.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,NessLeonhart,There was a Radio Lab episode where they talked about the scientists that bred mosquitoes with a special gene that would make any offspring they have die during the larval stage.\n\nListen to the whole story here:\nhttp://www.radiolab.org/story/kill-em-all/
todayilearned,3c7fmt,lead-holder,"They also say that something worse might fill the niche formally held by the mosquito. \n\n\n“They don’t occupy an unassailable niche in the environment,” says entomologist Joe Conlon, of the American Mosquito Control Association in Jacksonville, Florida. \n\n“If we eradicated them tomorrow, the ecosystems where they are active will hiccup and then get on with life.

todayilearned,3c7fmt,Nael5089,Aaaaaaaaaannd now I want to play Killer Instinct.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Hot_Fist,Who said something entirely new would have to evolve to take over? I was assuming an already-evolved species would fill in the gap and increase in number...
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Sheikh_Kristophe,Like horseflies?
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Evolutioneer,"Mosquitos are so so so much nicer than some of the alternatives. I grew up with Deer Flies (species that is in the horse fly family). Triangle buzzing annoyances that stalk you for hours before striking. And when they do, it hurts like hell. To quote wikipedia:\n\n\nWhen feeding, females use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision and then lap up the blood. Their bite can be extremely painful...\n\n\nTrust me, mosquitoes are far preferable to these beasts."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Sevlins,But a competing species would have to fill the gap. Not just an insect that also bites. Something that already exists in the same habitat but whose numbers are kept down by mosquitos.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,ToiletShoes,It'd actually be very important to quantify what is the niche mosquitos are filling. I frankly have no idea.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Sevlins,I always just figured it was bird feed.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,WickeDanneh,"The niche refers to what the animal is using to gain resources. So mosquito eating is a niche for birds, although ""flying insect eating"" is probably the actual niche.\n\nBut what is the limiting resource mosquitos compete for? Is it breeding space? Human blood? Plant pollen/nectar (males eat one of those, forget which)?"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Sevlins,"I find it hard to believe ""blood sucking insect"" is a niche that is actually competed over. There's plenty more blood to go around. The limiting niche for mosquitoes is probably in the larval stage where they have to eat stuff in the water."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,zzbzq,"Those things do suck, but at least they don't carry diseases like mosquitos can."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,blacknwhitelitebrite,Or crocodiles.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,GetsGold,I was just trying to be polite. This guy made it sound like he believes an entirely new species would have to evolve to fill in the gap...
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Sheikh_Kristophe,If horseflies feed the same organisms in their larval phase. It seems the concern is over them being a food source for other animals. It's not like they are competing for space on my body to bite.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,ToiletShoes,"Why would something increase in numbers though? Blood isn't really rare so theres not much competition, and I don't know what eats mosquitoes as their main source of food but if the mosquitoes' predator is the predator of these replacement pests then the replacement's numbers would go down."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,KevintheNoodly,"Actually this has already happened.  I live in northern Canada, one summer there was frost followed by heat was which delayed the mosquito season, anyway instead of swarms of mosquitoes there were swarms of large horse flies that would bite and make you bleed."

todayilearned,3c7fmt,Feral_Socks,What if hordes of horseflies rose to take their place?
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Smooth_McDouglette,Horseflies are genuine cunts and are far worse than mosquitoes. Bites hurt like an absolute bitch and they have some crazy flight manouevres so it's near impossible to whack them.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,tigranater,I once got bitten by one and blood ran from the wound immediately.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,dereddib,"Yeah it's because they actually bite your skin open, as opposed to mosquitos who make a very tiny puncture with their hypodermic mouth bit."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Smooth_McDouglette,Hypodermic Mouth Bit\n\nSolid band name.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,yab21,I think mosquitoes death count makes them much worse than the quick pinch of a horsefly. Unless horseflies carry diseases I am unaware of.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,turk4lyfe,They do
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Smooth_McDouglette,I'm not sure deaths from those diseases could ever rival mosquito related deaths though.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,turk4lyfe,"I know nothing about this subject really, but I would venture a guess that it might do if their population came anywhere near that of mosquitos."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Smooth_McDouglette,"We just keep eradicating until something more pleasant, like butterflies, fills the niche. :)"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Ruhtardedd,Maybe we could weaponize the butterflies and have them do the eradicating for us!

todayilearned,3c7fmt,PsychoNerd92,That's good!
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Smooth_McDouglette,A fucking horsefly bit me through a neoprene wetsuit and drew blood.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,NADSAQ_Trader,"I reckon we kill the horseflies too, along with the mosquitoes.   Keep killing til they stop biting back, the American way! :D"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,DualityOfLife,What if it were botflies
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Daahkness,Why would their numbers increase? Blood isn't rare and whatever eats both mosquitoes and horseflies as their main food would just eat more horseflies.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,KevintheNoodly,Flying leeches!
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Malakyr,"Nah, those would be way easier to spot before they latch on.  The shitty thing about mossies is that they can land on you, fuck your shit up, and then just bail without you even noticing."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Feral_Socks,"True, but a swarm of flying leeches would be fucking terrifying."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Malakyr,"Flying spiders! That would be terrifying. Fortunately, that's not a thing...I think."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,bullmoose_atx,The weird thing about that is that I feel like a flying spider would actually be less unnerving than a regular one.  I have absolutely no clue what sort of logic I have that would justify that opinion though.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Feral_Socks,You are more likely to see a flying spider. Regular spiders are sneaking around in the nooks and crannies on the ground.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,abdomino,"Yeah, that sounds pretty good.\n\nAnd if it's flying it's legs will just be hanging down below it and it would look lazy or bummed out."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Feral_Socks,Always depends on the size of the spider and whether it tries to generally avoid or attack humans . like mosquitos
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Dire87,http://prntscr.com/7p5w6h\n\nHe can smell your fear.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,naypalm,Spiders fly all the time. They deploy big web stringers and sail away into the sky in a windy day. They can also cross the oceans too.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,IAlmostDied,"black flies, horseflies, flying scorpions..."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,RampagingTortoise,better\n\n\nBioengineer a defacto mosquito breed that will take over and not like human blood.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,stereotypeless,"The thing about this is, it's just speculation. There is waaaaaaaaaaaay too much data to ever be %100 sure. If even ONE thing wasn't accounted for, that could have a cascade effect and have thousands of unintended effects. I've seen this argument before, and in reality it's super risky."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Ragman676,"Its really not though. They've already weighed up the risks of larval stage development loss and it's shown that in environments where they are present in high numbers, other laval phases can grow in proportion to fill the food chain. \n\nWe have huge amounts of data to process yes, but we also have huge data processing programmes such as vortex to help map these changes. It's not like we don't have statistical evidence to support this action"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,tomintheshire,"The ecosystem would be fine, yes, but would the changes work out in our favor? That's the question."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,MerryJobler,That would suck. \n\n\nI see what you did there ;)
todayilearned,3c7fmt,clumsybassdropper,Maybe flying Ticks?  That would be unfortunate.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,smowe,From the link it states\n\n\n...they form swarms thick enough to asphyxiate caribou in Alaska...\n\n\nDoes this actually happen? Gross
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Mahargi,But the galactic council would destroy Earth if it weren't for us being a nature preserve for the endangered mosquito.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,patentologist,"This comment is little and broken, but still good. Yeah, still good."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Skittlebrau46,"As much as i hate mosquitoes, there is always the law of unitended consequences. Like how wolf populations dwindled as hunters were allowed to conduct open season on what they thought of as pests killing all of the hunting game like deer and such. The low amount of wolves indirectly caused lush vegetation to be sparse due to the exceeding population of deer eating all of the vegetation which would promote growth of other animals and natural habitats making that ecosystem much more barren. I hope that getting rid of mosquitoes won't cause a huge backlash."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,thejiujitsupanda,Why didn't they relax game regulations so the hunters could kill the deer?
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Somnium_Ciceronis,"We do that in a lot of areas now. But I imagine the first time or two, it took a bit before we realized that it's a problem.\n\nWolf populations naturally decline as human development increases, which causes deer population booms, even where we don't allow open murder of wolves.  In most areas of the northeast at least, there are deer ""cullings"" pretty regularly, where hunters are provided additional permits each year to kill more deer to reduce the population to sustainable levels."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,issius,I can't help but think of Bill Burr's bit lol
todayilearned,3c7fmt,dardanmm,"I wish they would do this in Southeast Alabama. We have a ridiculous deer population, and we're always hearing about cars getting hit by deer. In fact, my cousin died after hitting a buck. The problem is, they are stupid animals and dash right into your car, almost as if they are trying to get hit."

todayilearned,3c7fmt,stouset,"Wolves aren't blood-sucking, disease-spreading little pieces shit from Hell"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Katculus,"The point is, what are the hidden and unknown consequences of eradicating mosquitoes? \n\nWe know some of the direct consequences - huge die off of mosquito eating bats, probably sever disruption for many dragonfly species (who's larva eat mosquito larva), possibly issues with pollination (male mosquitoes don't bite, they feed on nectar and pollinate some flowers).\n\nAny of these direct consequences will in and of themselves be very likely to cause other consequences. This is how you get cascading failures and start ecological collapse.\n\nWelcome to the 21st century!"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,f_leaver,"plus the predator-prey balance is proven beyond measure, there is no proven place for mosquitoes, we know mosquitoes do sere as food for many animals, but not all mosquitoes suck blood from humans."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Orc_,The original article explores this and it concluded that it won't be a big impact.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,ravenmeister,The entire point of the article is to discuss the unintended consequences and assert that they are most likely negligible in the case of eradicating mosquitos.

What if there is a super mosquito that was once defeated but not killed (it was fought because it kills people by draining all their blood and it need around two people to be fed every night) and needed to be fed by those little mosquitos and to recover but got lazy and just let the little ones feed hin until eternity. \n\nNow, if we kill all its minions, it gets really angry and goes on a rampage and kills most humans and destroys cities until it gets defeated and finally killed by humanity with one last final blow which will push us back to the stone age and humanity will habe to be rebuild by only a handful of people which are average Joe's that have to learn everything humanity has accomplished in all those years again. \n\nOr maybe it is all all in my head and it will be like heaven if we eradicate all of them. \n\nWho knows?

todayilearned,3c7fmt,masterofmeats,"I don't want to be debbie downer, and I can understand why people would want to prevent human deaths, but I feel like it's fairly well understood that people cause ""ecological consequences"", so if mosquitos kill at least 2 million people per year, we'll have at least 2 million more people per year.\n\n...how does that not have ecological consequences? \n\nI mean, maybe you could say it's worth the trade off to save lives or whatever, I'm not disagreeing with that. But saying it has no ecological consequences, I'm not sure that' entirely true :-/"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Hysterymystery,We can have more wars to even it out.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,TheyKeepOnRising,well then let's kill the people who were supposed to die!
todayilearned,3c7fmt,geemayn,Totally! We should actually give more people malaria to decrease ecological consequences.\n\n/s

todayilearned,3c7fmt,Barhoom91,"Not taking action to prevent deaths is unethical. Birth control and economic equality are a much better solution to population control. Impoverished nations are usually the victims of malaria. By not preventing these deaths, when we are capable of doing so, is essentially targeting the poor for population control."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Kazooguru,"Most of the deaths would be people in Africa and South America who don't have much of a carbon footprint anyways. Maybe if we released smallpox or something in America and Europe it would be more effective, but then you might actually be affected so I doubt you'd have the same feelings on the subject."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,Wallace_Grover,Except that there'll be more humans. We ruin everything
todayilearned,3c7fmt,macjulia,"This is fucking creepy. For a while now, the things I think of or research myself appear on reddit a couple of days later. Just yesterday I answered that queston on okcupid that asked whether I would kill all mosquitoes in the world if I could, and I answered yes and added an explanation that I think it would not have consequences for our ecosystem.

todayilearned,3c7fmt,DeadDrifter,But Dragonflies feed almost exclusively on mosquito larva.\n\nA large part of bats diets are mosquitos as well.\n\nMale mosquitos pollinate flowers.\n\nFocusing on a cure for the illnesses they spread is a better plan than wiping out a species.
todayilearned,3c7fmt,HeraldofUnicron,"Yes, I'm sure none of these scientists though to fucking wikipedia mosquitos to see things that eat them.\n\nThe point is that mosquitos aren't unique in basically any of their ecosystems.  You can kill them all and flies, or some other small flying insect will explode in population and get eaten, pollinate things, etc.\n\nI'm not saying there may not be unintended consequences, but its like you picked all of the obvious holes and just assumed maybe the scientists who came out with this never thought of googling ""mosquito""."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,issius,"Not trying to sound dark, but if there's one thing that mosquitos ecologically affect, its human population. Without mosquitos, would it result to an even worse case of global overpopulation?"
todayilearned,3c7fmt,kaptain_kush420,"Not necessarily, when there are more sources of unpredictable mortality, like malaria, people tend to have more kids to make sure they don't end up with too few. Remember, in much of the developing world children are your retirement plan.\nWhen stuff like malaria goes away people tend to have fewer kids and invest more resources in the ones they do."
todayilearned,3c7fmt,unrepentantpedant,No just in Africa.

todayilearned,3c86ib,laposte,"As a nurse working in Canada, they only tell you to ""Go see a doctor, just in case"" to cover their ass. That way if the person's condition worsened and they did not seek medical attention as per the nurse's advice, the nurse can't be blamed for negligence or held legally liable for what happened to that person."
todayilearned,3c86ib,Trisaratops69,"The Nurse's line is really useful for some things. For example, for work sometimes we have clients that turn up high on various illicit drugs and we often use the nurse's line to know if they can take their medication even though they have been using another substance. Another use that they are good for is when a person takes a certain amount of medication to try to overdose, you can call the nurse's line to get a good idea of the potential lethality/risk."

todayilearned,3c86ib,1-900-USA-NAILS,"Totally, but to hear them tell it, for every one informed person who comes in saying ""hey, I looked up my symptoms and I think I might have X,"" ten people come in convinced they're dying of stomach cancer or Celiac's disease or whatever when it's really just an upset tummy, and those are usually the people who don't want to listen when the Dr. tells them to simmer down."

todayilearned,3c86ib,tekdemon,"The problem is that while some well educated people will actually more or less make correct sense of their illness, even really intelligent people will be wrong about 95% of the time and manage to have concocted an entire alternate universe sort of explanation for what's going on based on a snowballing series of small misunderstandings.  If you're well educated and feel like you can interpret the studies, great, but don't be that tool who goes to the hospital and starts telling the doctor that you definitely know what's going on.  I've had intelligent patients who looked things up and have a decent understanding but realize the shortcomings in their understanding and ask me to help fill in the blanks which is great, but this ends up being the very rare exception.\n\nMost of the time doctors end up having conversations like this (an anonymized version of a real conversation I've had):\n\n\nMe: Sir, you have an infection in your [organ].  You're likely going to need surgery to address this, but we can try antibiotics first.\nPatient: I don't want surgery, have you heard of [naturopathic radio personality]?  They said that you should take these vitamins and to let your body heal itself.  They don't just make this up, they have research all over their website!\n\n\nThe number of patients who come in basically telling you that they know what's going on and are just horribly wrong about it, and how to treat it vastly outnumber the number of patients who read up and then ask you to help them correctly interpret the information they've gathered, or to double check that their understanding is correct and ask for some background information to make it all make more sense.  If you approach your doctor in a really antagonizing way and go in INSISTING that you know the answer they're much more likely to think that you're one of the numerous hopeless people they've been dealing with.  But if you go in and say that you think it's likely that you have this because of x, y and z and then actually listen to them about why they don't think it's those things and have an actual discussion about it then you're much more likely to get a good response.  Well, with some doctors anyway.  I've had doctors I've seen myself where they just insisted it was one diagnosis without any explanation as to why, which annoyed the hell out of me when I was a patient.  They were right, but they could have provided just a couple other pieces of information to ease my mind.  So I always to add some extra information when talking to people about why I think they have x, y, or z."

We all kinda understood that if it you couldn't get an appointment right away, go to the one hospital's ER, and you'd be taken care of. The other hospital's ER was reserved for dire emergencies, and if you went there with what was OK for the other ER, you'd be sitting for two hours before being sent to the Urgicenter.\n\nThen, the one hospital closed their ER. We had just the ""bad moon rising"" ER left. Now WTF do I do with a sprained ankle on Saturday afternoon?\n\nWell, now we have an ""Urgent Care Center"" ... So now there's four choices. With my health plan (that I very much like), they can all cost hundreds if I haven't met my ginormous deductible - but of course, it's not that simple. Waiting for my PCP costs me a visit ($100+), the Urgent Care Center costs me almost the same ($90).  But here's the bastard: Go to the ER and get admitted? Free. Sent to the Urgicenter? Whatever the bill is. \n\nI don't play that game and haven't been to a doc in years, save for a physical. But with USA's complicated as fuck insurance system, good luck on educating anyone to use it properly.\n\nMy favorite thing about my insurance is that I can go get a 30 minute massage, TENS, and a chiropractic adjustment for free, but if I wanna have a dermatologist determine AHEAD OF TIME if a mole should come off now before it gives me facial ass cancer, I have to pay hundreds."

todayilearned,3c86ib,gutsch,"This is actually just the page for Ontario's Telehealth service, and it would be technically incorrect to say ""Canada"" offers it because health care is governed by individual provinces, but all provinces seem to offer a similar service:\n\nhttp://www.canadianliving.com/health/prevention/how_to_get_medical_help_when_the_doctors_office_is_closed.php\n\nThe service has existed long before websites like WebMD, or even the internet, existed.  It helped many of my friends growing up in high school who had questions about confusing puberty changes or sex questions or questions relating to possible pregnancy, but couldn't find the answers on the internet and wanted to ask someone completely anonymously."
todayilearned,3c86ib,grimeyGR1,"In addition, HealthLink will provide real time wait times for emergency rooms across the province and forward your medical information to wherever you go if it is an emergency."
todayilearned,3c86ib,YungVenuz_,this happened to me once when I overdosed on lidocane and I thought I was a cylon! I called telehealth and rambled to her for a while about battlestar galactica and she was like uhh go to the hospital. \nso I went and they let me right through triage and I didn't even have to explain about fucking baltar. and I got my own room. it was sick.

todayilearned,3c86ib,flamingblur,"I found it very useful when I had my 1st child. She didn't have a bowel movement for 3 days and me and the wife were getting nervous. Called the healthline and they told us it's completely normal, go to the doctor if it reaches a week or something like that. But for new parents, it's an amazing service."
todayilearned,3c86ib,bulletcurtain,I can attest to this. Telehealth saved me numerous unnecessary trips to the ER for my first child.
todayilearned,3c86ib,Artvandelay1,"Well if you're calling about illness they probably will, but I've had friends in high school who called them about things like ""Can you use plastic wrap instead of a condom"" or ""can you get pregnant from oral sex"" or ""how do I get birth control without talking to my family doctor"" - they're super helpful for those kind of questions that one might think are probably stupid and embarrassing but just want to ask someone anonymously."

todayilearned,3c86ib,Redshift2k5,One of the most important thing Telehealth Ontario does is steer people away from the emergency room when it's not necessary.
todayilearned,3c86ib,thehollowman84,"In my own personal experience, she had no idea that I could go to urgent care to get stitches. She wanted me to go to the emergency room solely because she did not think urgent care could do stitches. I think we all could help out, though, by doing exactly what you're saying - be less of a burden on the system and go to urgent care when you can."
todayilearned,3c86ib,MetalMaiden420,"Well there's very little they can actually do for you over the phone except advice(such as which over the counter medications to take) and for many symptoms, signs, etc they only sensible advice is to see a doctor."
todayilearned,3c86ib,TheLetterFuck,"Yeah, liability means that if you give any symptom that is a symptom of anything they have to send you to a doctor.\n\nIt's mostly there for idiots. Sending someone to the doctor that doesn't need a doctor? that's not really that expensive. It's kinda what they're there for. Someone calling emergency because they have a cold? expensive and clogs up the emergency operators. Making an appointment with the doctor because you have sunburn? Wastes doctor time and money. \n\nBut yeah if you have a weird rash or a stomach ache for 3 days it might be something."
todayilearned,3c86ib,tnecniVVincent,"I also enjoy this service we have similar in Alberta, Healthlink. And they are amazing. They ask you questions and give you advice or tell you you should go to the ER right away. They'll even call and ambulance for you if you need it. Or they'll tell you to talk to your family doctor if things don't get better. They helped me a lot when I had to get my appendix removed."
todayilearned,3c86ib,horse__tornado,"Several years ago I had called this service after a slight sexual injury that left blood in the condom. After explaining to this very polite nurse what had happened the conversation went like this:\n\nNurse: Is there any pain when you urinate? \n\nMe: I'm not sure. This just happened. I haven't tried yet. \n\nNurse: Could you try now? \n\nMe: Sure.......[long pause]. Do I take you with me? \n\nNurse: No thank you, I'll hold."
todayilearned,3c86ib,novacham,My health insurance provider also does the same thing. I bet that most others also do because this would really help to cut costs.
todayilearned,3c86ib,masher70,"My insurance has the same thing but it is basically useless from my experience. No matter how trivial the advice is always ""go to a doctor or ER"". Maybe for very simple stuff like how to wrap a sprain or treat a minor burn it would be useful though"
todayilearned,3c86ib,cyberandroid,"Most of the ""go see a doctor"" is just for liability reasons. If someone were to call in and they didn't tell them to goto the doctor then later died, someone is going to sue."
todayilearned,3c86ib,dustballer,"I found the same thing.  They definitely want there to be no chance that they have told someone to stay home and not worry, only to have it be something serious."
todayilearned,3c86ib,coldandwet,"what telehealth ontario usually does is suggest whether to call an ambulance, go to emergency, see your doctor asap, see your doctor within a week typically."
todayilearned,3c86ib,The_Rogue_Penguin,I had one with the same option.
todayilearned,3c86ib,10207287,"Australia has that too. They will note it all down so that if you do need to go the see a doctor all that information about symptoms etc, is there before you get there. Mind you the advise is almost always, see a doctor."

todayilearned,3c86ib,necromundus,"A lot of people are saying that's it's just the ""go see a doctor"" line, but it's actually super useful if you have a small child. If they have a cold and your worried or think they have an ear infection or something they are good to ask and can give you tips for dealing with them. They can hear them cough over the phone and tell you if its anything to be worried about too. \n\nAll the nurses I've talked to have been really nice and helpful too."

todayilearned,3c86ib,book_smrt,"I renewed my medical card a bit late, so while I was waiting for my new one to come in while my old one was expired, I called them thinking I had some sort of blood clot in my head and I was on the verge of dying. I was willing to spend the money to spend the night in the hospital. She literally told me to shut up and take 1500mg of acetaminophen and go to sleep. I am so thankful for her because all WEBMD told me it was a clot but when I told her my symptoms she was like... ""chick you got a migraine, turn off all your electronics and put ice behind your neck. Goodnight "" I saved thousands of dollars."

todayilearned,3c86ib,Glitch_King,"In my house we call this ""1-800-gotothehospital"". EVERYTIME any of us have used this service we are told to either go to the ER or see our doctor. Their hands are so tied by their legal team that they almost never say that you should not seek treatment. Because every call is documented, if something happened after they told you that you are probably fine they would be screwed.  Its a lot worse now than when they first started too."
todayilearned,3c86ib,Sabreens,"In my experience they're very helpful- they tell people how urgent their issue is. They have told me I should see a doctor within 24 or 48 hours, they have told me to call an ambulance, they have told me to rush to the ER because an ambulance will take too long, and they have told me to see a doctor within a week. People with medical issues usually should see doctors, you know."
todayilearned,3c86ib,speakingofsegues,The Advocate system here in Chicago has the same thing. I was just praising it to a friend not 1 hour ago.
todayilearned,3c86ib,KissMyAspergers,Its a thing here in Denmark as well. I usually call Lægevagten if I have been sick for a few days without signs of it clearing up and I am not sure what I am down with. Its very helpful :)
todayilearned,3c86ib,catatronic,"Telehealth is free in Ontario and it is very helpful. One benefit is as a first time parent, you have a lot of questions and the nurses are extremely helpful. You can also be forwarded to a hospital pharmacist if you have questions about medicine, side affects, etc. Another thing that is helpful about telehealth is that if they tell you to go to emerg, they will collect all of your information and forward it to the nearest hospital to you. It eliminates a lot of wasted time answering questions you have already answered."
todayilearned,3c86ib,Lesook,"As a Canadian who's used this service, I feel compelled to note that while this is true, you can expect to wait on hold for a long time (I waited around 40 minutes), and when someone finally answers your call, they don't so much listen to you describe the problem as they literally walk through a checklist-style series of questions designed to roughly diagnose something based on a process of elimination. \n\nFor example, I had been drinking a lot and when I tried to sleep, the room was spinning and I was getting a headache. So I just wanted to see how safe it would be for me to take something considering I've heard those horror stories about not taking painkillers with alcohol. Call me stupid or paranoid, but I just wanted to make sure. After 40 minutes on hold, and the elimination checklist, the ""diagnosis"" the girl read to me suggested I see a doctor the next day. This, of course, was silly - I just wanted to know how long was a safe amount of time to wait between the two. \n\nSo, meh."

todayilearned,3c86ib,reverseskip,"I've used the BC line.  I called for heatstroke, which ended up making me sick for several days, but on the first day when I called, the nurse went through my symptoms with me, told me I didn't need to go to the ER/a doctor, and what to do to remedy the damage and take care of myself while I recovered.  I was very happy to have that line open to me, because at the time I called, I couldn't have safely driven myself to the hospital due to the extreme dizziness, and I'd have had to pay for an ambulance to get there - only to be told ""yeah it's heatstroke, go home and hydrate a lot.""\n\nI also called once to find out some information on vaccinations that I wasn't able to find definite answers for online.  Even only twice, both phone calls have provided me with a super valuable service."

Mexico has First Past the Post and their presidential elections have been three-way races for nearly 30 years and they just elected 10 parties to their Chamber of Deputies. Five different parties control state governments and the number of active parties is actually growing, with MORENA, the PES, and the Humanists coming onto the stage just this past (June 2015) election.\n\nElecting individuals on universal mandates to decide all possible issues is a broken system, but the voting system isn't the big issue."
todayilearned,3c8ial,DasND,Is Mexican electoral system exactly the same as US one? I mean it's really strange for First Past the Post two that many active parties.
todayilearned,3c8ial,SterlingBowman,"It has First Past the Post. It does not have an electoral college, so it's actually just whoever gets the most votes (often less than a majority). The congress now has some proportionate representation, but even without that, it would have many parties. The Mexican political character has always been diverse, since before the idea of ""Mexico"" really caught on. Even with all these parties, many feel unrepresented. Anarchism is more popular in the south of Mexico than nearly anywhere else (maybe Kurdistan surpasses them) and the EZLN has maintained an active rebellion for two decades.\n\nOther countries with parliamentary systems, like Canada, sustain more than two parties with FPTP. With the straight presidential system and FPTP, Chile saw the development of a third party and the rise of the Socialist president Allende (before the U.S. helped overthrow him) and Venezuela saw the two major parties eclipsed by a new movement to the point where they had to endorse the same candidate and still lost to Chavez (who the right, the U.S., and international business interests tried to overthrow unsuccessfully)."
todayilearned,3c8ial,Atworkwasalreadytake,Only in the First Past the Post system - not any system. Alternate vote or mixed member proportional representation definitely allows for multiple parties.
todayilearned,3c8ial,yakri,"I think you misunderstood. This applies to ""winner takes it all"" systems, where winner becomes the ruler and the failing parties have no power at all. In representative systems, seats are allocated to the proportion of the votes. Thus if Lion get's the most votes, and Gorilla get's the secon most votes, Lion has the majority and could rule alone (the Government is elected from the Parliament), but Gorilla can discuss with Monkey if the want to form a coalition. After they joined forces, they have the majority. These systems not only don't gravitate towards a 2-party-system, they gravitate to 100-party-systems. To prevent a parliament from being unable to act due to endless fighting between the hundred parties, a vote hurdle is used (e.g. minimum of 5% of votes neeeded) to ensure the parties in the parliament have a sufficient voter base. Additionally to the party votes, a number of seats is allocated directly to elected politicians. Thus, you can vote for Gorillas Party in general, yet give one vote to Jafarr Lion, because he's badass!"
todayilearned,3c8ial,MITT_ROMNEEY,"As a European, I'm going to have to disagree with this. Loads of European countries run on more than two parties. My own country, which is admittedly a bit of a specific case, has liberal parties, christian democrats, socialists, greens, and nationalists all of which have a representation in parliament and have been in government at some point."
todayilearned,3c8ial,aurelorba,"You missed the point of the video, not ""any"" system, just drive systems, in this case, first pass the post."
todayilearned,3c8ial,EendrachtMaaktMacht,"Just gonna go ahead and point out that that isn't really what the video explains, it's actually about the issues with essentially the system we have here in america and why it's a bit dated.

todayilearned,3c8ial,PokemasterTT,"Not necessarily true. It depends on the voting system. The voting system we use, first past the post trends towards two political parties. However, other voting methods don't. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI"
todayilearned,3c8ial,HunterAP,No they don't.
todayilearned,3c8ial,OllyforLordCommander,"I don't want to freak you out, but the Netherlands has 11 parties in the House of Representatives and senate (actually 6 more, 5 of which are separatists with nigh zero chance of not getting decimated in the next election and one who is senate-only with virtually no influence).\n\nGovernments are formed through different coalitions- there are historically dominant parties, generally centralist that will swing with the sways of the political landscape. (E.g. the Christian Democrats, who would go left if the Dutch went more towards Labour/Socialists/Greens and right in the case of the liberals/free-market/nationalists) Though they are currently in a bit of a slump and have had to take a back seat to the right wing liberals."
todayilearned,3c8ial,PeasantToPrince,"With First Past the Post yes, but my country has proportional(not perfect one, since the big parties made it better for themselves) and as result there are more parties in the parliament than 20 years. The top party got just 20% in the last election."
todayilearned,3c8ial,kleroj,"I absolutely get that.  (and did watch the video so that I could say that I did.  ;)  )  There are other possibilities, and those possibilities should be looked into.  I think that a weighted system would be applicable.  We live in a day and age where such a thing could be implemented.  200 years ago, it would have been unthinkable.\n\nUsing electronic voting, people could rate candidates, picking from best to worst.\n\nThe idea of picking, ""the best one,"" is a simple idea, and as the video shows, it doesn't best represent what people actually want.  Perhaps the people voting for Leopards would be cool with Tiger being elected also, but would absolutely not want snake elected.  So they would vote Leopard, Tiger, Snake.  In such a system, it could be possible for a candidate who is no one's favorite to win the election because they were everyone's 2nd favorite.\n\nWe could also use such a system to better choose vice presidents.  Runner up would be the vice, which is the way that it used to be, before the Civil War."
todayilearned,3c8ial,ModerateBias,"Because we have a first past the post voting system instead of preferential voting. \n\nImagine if you could list your choices in order of preference instead of casting a single vote? \n\nIf your 1st choice is a 3rd party candidate, and your 2nd is Democrat, then if your first choice doesn't get enough votes it goes to the second choice. \n\nIt prevents people from picking the lesser of two evils rather than who they actually support in fear that their first choice won't win."
todayilearned,3c8ial,ModerateBias,"This was Adams' argument, if I'm not mistaken, in Federalist no. 10. He basically said that having big parties prevented the worst parts of factions and that since factionalism is impossible to prevent, we should embrace it, but manage them.\n\nIf I'm wrong on this PLEASE correct me. Don't want people to be misinformed"
todayilearned,3c8ial,Bend_over_and_Smile,"Wow. Almost every word of your post is incorrect. You got the problem right, but not the proposed solution.\n\nMadison wrote #10, arguing for a large republic, because it would lead to smaller parties.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10\n\n\nFederalist No. 10 is an essay written by James Madison\n\nJurists have frequently read No. 10 to mean that the Founding Fathers did not intend the United States government to be partisan[citation needed].\n\nThe last argument Madison makes in favor of a large republic is that as, in a small republic, there will be a lower variety of interests and parties, a majority will more frequently be found. \n\n\n(Note: Madison thought of the ""majority"" as a tyrannical faction that looked after their own good instead of the common good. This is commonly misunderstood point: ""Majority rule"" is a tool of democracy, not the goal of democracy.  A good democracy is one in which the majority is formed by a broad coalition (or ""big tent""), not one faction.)"
todayilearned,3c8ial,DonTago,"madison...  and factions are better equated to special interests than parties.  I think one of the most common misreadings in the federalist papers is this.  Madison is pretty clear what he means by factions, but in an effort to force it into relevancy, many have done what you did, and read parties into it instead.  It's not your fault for repeating what you were probably taught by a professor or teacher, but as a political scientist myself, i get frustrated.\n\nHere is a quote from federalist 10 to back up my point\n\n\nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\n\n\nthat sounds a whole lot more like a special interest than a party to me.\n\nMost of the federalists papers were written by madison, hamilton, or Jay.  Not sure adams even wrote any."

todayilearned,3c8ial,R_O_F_L,"Let's talk about political parties in the French Revolution, then!\n\nIn much the same manner as early American politicians, the French republicans who toppled the Ancien Regime disapproved of formal political parties and what their introduction into government could induce.\n\nAnd yet, when a group of delegates all believe the same things, any rational person would try and coordinate with them-- and that's exactly what happened.  Because no formal parties were established, however, (unlike the American system eventually did), the factionalism in Revolutionary France was particularly intense.\n\nTransfers of power did not generally happen through elections, but instead via political trickery, mass defections, or other sudden swings.  And when a formally ruling group found themselves out of power, the first thing usually done was to arrest and try them as counterrevolutionaries.\n\nThis eventually culminated in the purging of the left wing Girondists and the rise of the ultra-left, fucking nuts, Mountain faction.  And that's when the Reign of Terror kicked into gear."

todayilearned,3c8ial,geekygay,"The Federalists being called a political party is a big stretch, if you compare it to the lockstep cronyism that we see today.\n\nThey were called Federalists because they advocated for a relatively strong central government (take in the irony there, when you remember how much conservatives both hate Federalism yet worship the founding fathers and originalism) whereas their opponents advocated for a more distributed system of governance, that could be characterized by the 'gentleman farmer's archetype, sort of an every man for himself mentality."

todayilearned,3c8ial,LunaticPict,"The Founding Fathers most certainly were pro-centralized government. They couldn't reasonably have advocated for a larger system because it didn't exist. \n\nA larger government with numerous federal agencies came about with the industrial revolution and the need for client agencies and public administrators that could work to provide oversight to corporations doing things like building railroads and also assisting special interests seeking assistance, lol the country's first farm groups. As technology increased production and progress, and the population rapidly increased, it became clear that a federal referee was necessary, so to speak.\n\nRecall that prior to the Civil War the federal government was basically the U.S. Postal Service. There were very, very few public agencies.\n\nThat doesn't mean they opposed public administration. In fact, they immediately realized the need for such assistance when they initially adopted the Articles of Confederation and there was only government by committee. At that point, with John Adams on 90 committees alone, the Founders began rethinking decentralized government after that first decade of America, scrapped the Articles and literally the Federalists invented how we operate now with the adoption of the Constitution."

Therefore, politicians with similar interests will start regularly working together, making agreements amongst each other before proposing bills, thereby ensuring a basic level of support. When elections come around, politicians want to keep their allies, so they will support each others' campaigns.

todayilearned,3c8ial,my_name_is_the_DUDE,"Washington was right. The balance of power in America's political system was supposed to be based on the isometric struggle between the Legislative branch, the Executive branch and the Judicial branch. When political parties come into the mix, that breaks down. The Congressmen of a particular political party, for instance, are eager and willing to siphon off power from the Legislative branch and give it to the Executive--so long as the President is from the same party.\n\nThat's NOT how the system is supposed to work.\n\n(But that's precisely how the President has accrued all these [largely un-Constitutional] powers to himself, and how he's poached in the dominion of Congress. Like the most recent outrage of claiming that the Chief Executive can ignore standing laws--rendering them void by fiat--and replacing them with his own executive orders . . . as if he has the power to legislate. Constitutionally, he has no such power. (According to the nation's guiding document, Congress writes the laws and the President must enforce those laws as written. Traditionally executive orders were written to explain how he intended to carry out those laws. Executive orders were NOT used to contradict standing law, or make the assertion that the President can ignore the law--as modern Presidents have started using them. For instance, when FDR wrote an executive order after Prohibition was enacted, he contained himself to saying, ""I intended to carry out this order by creating the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco."" He did NOT write, ""I disagree with this law, so I will not enforce it."" As Mr. Obama has done with immigration.) But allowing this abuse of executive orders, Congress is allowing the Chief Executive to essentially steal their power, and render them irrelevant, because Congressmen and Senators within the houses aren't loyal to their branch of government; they're loyal to their political party, and the Machine's party bosses.)\n\nWe saw it under Bush. And we saw it get even worse under Obama.\n\nAnd now with the Trans-Pacific Parthnership, they're taking even more power away from Congress and vesting it in the Presidency.\n\nBasically by this point, the US has ceased to be a functional republic, and has become a de facto autocracy (where all powers are vested in one man, and he rules not by law, but by whim. ""Doesn't like certain laws? Have them repealed? Nonsense! Just order them not to be enforced and refuse to prosecute people who break those laws."" If the law is a mere ""suggestion"" to the President, and he can unilaterally render it void and switch it out for an executive order of his own creation, then we're dealing with rule by whim.)\n\nIf we're ruled by whim and not by law, we're no longer a republic. If the president is not bound by statute and Constitutional limits, we're no longer dealing with a democratic system."

todayilearned,3c7nxi,Imissmyolduser_name,"Because then there the scientific classification would be worthless. The point of classifying different kinds of fruits (as berries, drupes, nuts, etc.) is to allow comparison between different species, as well as to aid identification.\n\nAnd the context will make it obvious whether someone is referring to a berry in the culinary sense vs the botanic sense."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,justrynahelp,"Context won't always make it obvious. It's kind of senselessly confusing for students to learn that the scientific definition of berry is the opposite of what it means in every day usage.\n\nWhy not just give ""berry"" to the culinary world and come up with a better scientific name? When the scientific definition for berry is basically ""all of the fruits except the ones actually called berries"" it pretty much means they're using literally the worst name possible. A string of random consonants would be a better choice."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,ExtremelyLongButtock,"It would be difficult to make the more specialized field adapt to all of those less specialized; scientific fields require their own nomenclature, it saves an immense amount of time whenever you want to make a very specific point about a very specific feature of anatomy, as opposed to re-explaining the exact physiological nature of a berry every time common parlance decides it means something slightly new."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,t_mo,"Yeah, but in this case, common parlance got there way before science did. Science took the name berry and decided to define it in a way that excluded its archetypal examples. They should just admit berry wasn't quite the word they were looking for."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,ExtremelyLongButtock,"The oldest usage of the proto-germanic 'berie' describes a grape, which is the type fruit for the botanical term 'berry'.\n\nSo really, common parlance just got way ahead of itself calling things berries, the botanical term holds to the etymological origins of the word."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,t_mo,"When the scientific definition for berry is basically ""all of the fruits except the ones actually called berries"" it pretty much means they're using literally the worst name possible.\n\n\nBlueberries and cranberries are berries by both definitions.

todayilearned,3c7nxi,Nutella_Sandwich,"That's neither a solution nor a valid point. Confusion happens in all walks of life. It's perfectly acceptable to be confused at first. It's also acceptable for your understanding of a concept to be completely unstable because of some minor confusion in its most basic stages. Like in math; if you never learn the proper way to long divide, (an inherently simple but confusing task) your entire foundation of understanding for algebra could be unstable or weak. \n\nIt's alright to be confused. If it wasn't, we'd still be laughing at each other for shitting ourselves when we were two years old. The point is, if a system causes an inordinate amount of confusion, then it is inherently worthless and deserves to be changed. Now I'm not saying that's entirely the case here, but you understand where I and my fellow commenters are coming from."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,nickgreen90,"What is the point of having the term ""berry"" if most of the things commonly called berries aren't berries? What is the purpose of the word at that point?"
todayilearned,3c7nxi,CQBPlayer,"It helps to describe very specific anatomical features. Blackberry fruits have fundamentally different features than grapes, for example the drupe of a blackberry has a layer called an endocarp surrounding the seed which the seeds of berries like grapes do not have; by calling a blackberry a drupe we describe all of those features at once and save a lot of time, and by maintaining historical nomenclature we avoid having to retrain every previous generation of scientists each time common languages spontaneously change the application of different terms.\n\nFeatures like the endocarp were discovered and named long after the adoption of the word berry, so it was the new discoveries which prompted the adoption of new nomenclature."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,t_mo,Roasted with facts.
todayilearned,3c7nxi,CQBPlayer,"Most things called Berries, are berries. It's just that Raspberries, Blackberries and Strawberries aren't.\n\nSo why not change those 3 into names that make sense as to what they are instead?"
todayilearned,3c7nxi,huntinglols001,Either would work.
todayilearned,3c7nxi,CQBPlayer,"Ok, sure, but why is there a botanic need for the classification of berries to be exactly the opposite of what we actually think it is? Why was this definition formed in such a way that it would be culinarily useless and botanically complex? Why couldn't we just swap the words and keep the definitions?"
todayilearned,3c7nxi,nickgreen90,"We can and do.  There are multiple ways of classifying things, and botanical classification is only one of them.  If you classify things by culinary terminology though, then strawberries, raspberries, etc. are all berries, tomatoes are vegetables, peanuts are nuts, etc."

todayilearned,3c7nxi,Stardrink3r,Why would you be against science redefining things after we're more  knowledgeable about them? It's not as though they are changing the name of them and it's not as though we knew more about those classifications in the past for them to be more correct.\n\nYou seriously value tradition over correctness?
todayilearned,3c7nxi,Anon_I_Commenteth,"There is no such thing as correctness when you are talking about an arbitrary definition; it's just a matter of usefulness. Tradition itself is not important, but proliferation of a definition correlates to usefulness. The longer a usage has been around, the more firmly established it is, and the more useful it is conversing with other people.\n\nWhy would I be against science redefining things after we're more knowledgeable about them? We can't become more knowledgeable about the definition of the word ""berry"" or about how biological species are classified. Why? Because it means whatever the hell we say it means. And they are classified however the hell we classify them. Can we learn more about plants and the way they reproduce and how they genetically relate to each other? We sure can. But we can't learn more about what a word means; we can only change the meaning over time. The question then becomes: what changes are good, and what changes are bad? Personally, I answer that question based on common usefulness, and how well established the usage is. If a definition enjoys use exclusively within an academically restricted echelon, it probably shouldn't spill over to common parlance.

todayilearned,3c7nxi,Stardrink3r,"We can't become more knowledgeable about the definition of the word ""berry"" or about how biological species are classified. Why? Because it means whatever the hell we say it means. And they are classified however the hell we classify them.\n\n\nYes we can. Scientists don't just pick these definitions randomly out of a hat. They just realised that trying to classify things based on looks alone, like how they were originally named, is not a very good way of classifying them. We don't classify your common household cat as a Canine simply because it has four legs, fur, a tail, and if-you-squint-it-can-sorta-look-like-a-dog.\n\n\nIf a definition enjoys use exclusively within an academically restricted echelon, it probably shouldn't spill over to common parlance. And further, if said definition directly contradicts common usage, it would be better to introduce a new word to replace it, because it's damn unnecessarily confusing!\n\n\nSo far your argument is ""That's what we've always called it (tradition) and it might be too hard to have another name for something"". I don't have too much faith in humanity, but I don't think it's too much of ordeal like you think it would be. Do you know how many different words they have for sex?\n\n\nSo while some term is needed to specify kinds of plants that bear ""fleshy fruit produced from a single flower and containing one ovary,"" that term sure as hell shouldn't be a common, every-day word that normal people have for centuries used plants that don't meat that description.\n\n\nThat's what they did, they're called things like botanical berries or drupes or aggregate fruits."
todayilearned,3c7nxi,Anon_I_Commenteth,"Oh god, are we going to start using the quote formatting on each other? fine. Fair warning: I will probably have to edit this to make sure I get the formatting right.\n\n\nScientists don't just pick these definitions randomly out of a hat.\n\n\nOf course not. Please don't create straw-man arguments by reducing my statements to inanities. I said they're arbitrary, as in having been arbitrated. Arbitration had damn well better include reasoning, when- and wherever employed. I say here only that I disagree--on linguistic bases rather than scientific--with the conclusion of said arbitration. My argument for such will follow in response to your statement:\n\n\nSo far your argument is ""That's what we've always called it (tradition) and it might be too hard to have another name for something"".\n\n\nQuite not. To digress a moment before correcting you about my argument, let me state my stance:  It is stupid to say (quoting the thread title): ""strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are not [berries]."" That's my stance. It's a reaction to the thread title. If this were casual conversation and someone had said that, I might respond: ""That's absurd! Of course strawberries, et al. are berries."" I really want to emphasize that I'm responding to the title here. As for my argument, tradition is irrelevant. It has nothing to do with the fact that ""we've always called"" certain things berries, or that ""it might be hard to have a different name for something."" It has everything to do with cost/benefit analysis. You vaguely hint at this yourself when you said ""They just [sic]realised that trying to classify things based on looks alone, like how they were originally named, is not a very good way of classifying them."" But what you miss is that the utility, or value, of the word ""berry"" does not lie in its ability to classify plants within a phylogenetic system; the utility of the word berry lies within the usage for which it was initially created, which is that the common person interacts with these superficially similar things in a similar way (i.e. they're all small, sweet edibles from plants and can be treated similarly in nutritional and culinary respects). There is a wealth of utility in calling those things berries, and there is a bankruptcy of utility in taking the scientific jargon term of ""berry"" and enforcing it in common usage. Which leads directly into your statement:\n\n\nThat's what they did, they're called things like botanical berries...\n\n\nNo, that is unequivocally not what happened right here. This isn't hypothetical; it's right there at the top of the page. All I have to do is point at the thread title. It doesn't say ""strawberries aren't botanical berries."" It says strawberries aren't berries.\n\nI say bullshit.\n\nEDIT: Formatting"

Black dude in early 1900's, how do you think it's gonna turn out?\n\n\nWhen Johnson and his fellow Hellfighters arrived home in February 1919, they were honored with a parade up New York’s Fifth Avenue. Thousands of spectators lined the route to watch Johnson lead nearly 3,000 troops in an open car towards Harlem, holding a bouquet of lilies. The celebration had a dark side, however: The 369th were given their own parade because they weren’t allowed to join the official victory parade alongside other returning U.S. troops.\n\n\nK. That's not that bad.\n\n\nJohnson’s discharge papers made no mention of his many wounds, and he received no disability pay after the war.\n\n\nOh.\n\n\nJohnson returned to Albany, and to his job as a railroad porter, but his injuries made it difficult for him to work, and he soon began to decline into alcoholism and poverty. His wife and children left him, and he died penniless in 1929 at the age of 32. As far as anyone in his family knew, he ended up in a pauper’s grave in Albany.\n\n\nDamn."

todayilearned,3c73ic,HighFlyerMN,I'm pretty sure that they didn't want any political factions to control the government like they do now.
todayilearned,3c73ic,jroddie4,"George Washington's farewell address was literally a warning against political parties, which were already beginning to form."
todayilearned,3c73ic,buildabeast,They formed immediately.
todayilearned,3c73ic,GaiusBaltar_,"I should rephrase, parties were beginning to form in a more modern sense. Where they were more centrally controlled, and were actual organizations rather than more loosely connected people."
todayilearned,3c73ic,buildabeast,"Just like Eisenhower's farewell address was about the ""rising power of the military industrial complex."" Then what happened? Kennedy briefly, then Johnson and Vietnam. (Pssst* it's because history repeats itself, those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Learn what? A lesson. How does one learn their lesson? Through repetition. Repeat what? History repeats itself.) Look for history's apples."
todayilearned,3c73ic,RadioHeadache0311,"I hate that BS of a saying ""those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it."" It implies that if you learn history, then somehow, you won't be doomed to repeat it.\n\nNewsflash: no matter what you do, the result will be something which resembles a historic event, because the whole thing is entirely subjective. A lot of people say ""Hitler didn't learn from History, because if he had then he would have known that Napoleon tried to invade Russia and that's why he lost."" Yeah, well Hitler did learn from History, it's just he thought World War I was more relevant to his situation. In World War I, Germany invaded Russia, and Russia collapsed, sued for peace, and signed over huge territories of land over to Germany. \n\nWhat's worse is that this is basically the only example people use for how people should learn from the past. Well, I agree that one can draw parallels between historic events, and sometimes useful information can be gained from it; sometimes you can even predict general trends, but I think the quotation (apparently by Joseph Anthony Wittreich) is very wise, \n\n""History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme."""
todayilearned,3c73ic,zecrissverbum,Bullshit Jefferson helped form a political party from the jump.
todayilearned,3c73ic,AlphaWookie,Jefferson was a member of a political party.
todayilearned,3c73ic,tallerthanunicorngod,"Interestingly, Thomas Jefferson actually founded the ""Republican Party"", albeit not the same party that exists today."
todayilearned,3c73ic,habit491,The Republican party was formed some 50 years after he died. You're thinking of the Democratic-Republican party which is the precursor to today's Democratic party.
todayilearned,3c73ic,drmctesticles,"It's difficult to ascribe the Democratic-Republicans as the precursors of either modern party. they were classical liberals, so would be more in line with modern libertarianism."
todayilearned,3c73ic,thebigstrongman2,Except they were against industry.
todayilearned,3c73ic,PleaseDontReply2Me,"shhhh everyone wants to claim Jefferson for themselves. In truth he doesn't really fit in anywhere on the modern political spectrum, at some point the issues just become too disparate. He had ideals that everyone likes and therefore a lot of people try and shoehorn him into a modern political views that only kind of match him."
todayilearned,3c73ic,buildabeast,"Meh, I think there's a case to be made for the libertarians to claim Jefferson. I'm a Socialist myself, and I have no interest in claiming him (though, I don't know how much I care for Hamilton either). The reason I think libertarians have a legit claim to him is because he was against a national bank, was against tariffs, and was generally for more states rights."
todayilearned,3c73ic,zecrissverbum,I believe they called themselves the Republican Party and the term democratic republican was created later but you are correct clarification appreciated
todayilearned,3c73ic,habit491,"The Democratic Republican Party was called the Republican Party during its time. Then it disappeared and the modern, unrelated Republican Party became prominent."
todayilearned,3c73ic,SpringenHans,The Democratic Republican party that preceded the modern Democratic party of today.\n\nThe modern day Republicans were born out of the civil war era.
todayilearned,3c73ic,PhilipGlover,The term democratic republican was created later to describe what was called the Republican Party! But you are correct the modern gop was created them completely separate from the remnants of Jeffersons party.
todayilearned,3c73ic,habit491,Noted :)
todayilearned,3c73ic,PhilipGlover,"So then he ""didnt"" form the republican party"
todayilearned,3c73ic,furiouslyfappin,that's some serious /r/lewronggeneration
todayilearned,3c73ic,RedAnarchist,You guys are ignorant if you think politics is significantly different today.
todayilearned,3c73ic,GaiusBaltar_,"When he was president, the people did not elect the president and most in the higher reaches of government advocated for a class of people who could vote and be elected, and the rest would not."
todayilearned,3c73ic,Iamswitters,That is why Jefferson left voting to the white male property owning class.
todayilearned,3c73ic,AlphaWookie,"he didn't see this country being run by the cast of idiocracy\n\n\nIt's funny because Thomas Jefferson believed negroes were inferior to whites, and when they were inevitably freed from slavery, he wanted them removed from America. The United States, he wrote, was to be “the nest from which all America, North and South, is to be peopled,” and the hemisphere was to be entirely European: “…nor can we contemplate with satisfaction either blot or mixture on that surface.”\n\nSource\n\nSo yes, when he wrote that he certainly didn't see this country being run by what he would consider idiots, as it is now. Well said."
todayilearned,3c73ic,DudleyDoorite,dwayne elizando herbert mountain-dew camacho for president!
todayilearned,3c73ic,gr00ve88,The constitution would need to be ratified as was the case originally. So it would have to be agreeable for all right?
todayilearned,3c73ic,chucicabra,The only thing that this country could get people to agree on in a 75% majority is that this country is filled with idiots.

todayilearned,3c73ic,theappendixofchrist,Who won the armchair academic. What else are you going to blast with your ding ding?
todayilearned,3c73ic,seriousllly,"Yea except you are looking at it from a modern-day political lens that assumes partisan politics. At the time the Constitution was being written, we didn't have an entrenched two-party system."
todayilearned,3c73ic,TellYouWhatitShwas,Actually you kind of did. Federalists and antifederalists appeared almost immediately.
todayilearned,3c73ic,GaiusBaltar_,But that happened as a response to the political system that the Constitution put in place. The framework set by the Founding Fathers is one of the most effective ways to put in place and enforce a two party system.
todayilearned,3c73ic,HobbitFoot,"Debatable, obviously politics were way different back then and there were not any true parties (as we think of them today), but there were clear divisions.  Particularly on the role of the federal government, which to this day is still a major divider of the parties."
todayilearned,3c73ic,skizo18,That's exactly what the top comment here said to which I agreed.
todayilearned,3c73ic,Roike,Which is the relevance of the top comment...you brought it full circle though it wasn't really needed.
todayilearned,3c73ic,protozoicstoic,"He didn't even say what OP claims. Read it. He says 19 years is the turnover rate of a population (generation) and so perpetual laws become laws of ""the dead and not the living"". He didn't say the constitution should be rewritten every 19 years..."
todayilearned,3c73ic,Kandidar,"Read further, the natural consequence of the generational turnover is that laws should expire with the generation which enacted them, otherwise the laws are being forced upon the next generation.\n\n""The constitution and the laws of their predecessors extinguished then in their natural course, with those who gave them being. This could preserve that being till it ceased to be itself, & no longer. Every constitution then, & every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, & not of right."""
todayilearned,3c73ic,DiogenesLied,"However, a perpetual Constitution is what enabled the rise of parties and their ability consolidate that kind of power."
todayilearned,3c73ic,ta5994,People with similar political ideas will always gather together and consolidate their power. A revolving constitution wouldn't prevent that.\n\nsee; every political party in every nation ever.
todayilearned,3c73ic,zyck_titan,"There were parties from the very beginning, even as the constitution was being written."
todayilearned,3c73ic,UncleMeat,"George Washington cautioned against political parties and faction, and John Adams went ""ooh, faction! what a great idea! we need some alien and sedition acts!"""

todayilearned,3c73ic,tallerthanunicorngod,What was that guy... Washington? He said something about this.

todayilearned,3c73ic,theappendixofchrist,"surely that should be the first rule of writing a new constitution, that it must be agreeable to all parties."

todayilearned,3c73ic,Andrea__Dworkin,"Just for fun, I'll use your own words to reply.\n\nSeriously, I think you've a drinking problem."
todayilearned,3c73ic,hadrianw,"He wrote that in 1789. It seems that he moderated his opinion later in his life: in 1816, he wrote:\n\n\n""I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times."
todayilearned,3c73ic,Aqquila89,"This makes sense to me as if you read the constitution without any of the amendments it doesn't really say much. But then we started tacking on finer points to keep it going and here we are! Good work, Jeffy."
todayilearned,3c73ic,TheLastHonestMan,"Never seen this quote before, excellent find! Jefferson's shift in views makes total sense, given that in 1789 he was still ambassador to France, while in 1816 he'd served as Vice President, and then President for 12 years."
todayilearned,3c73ic,HarbingerOfFun,If people had to contribute to a new constitution once in their lives would it have created a stronger culture of civic community? Where people actually give a shit about our civil institutions and peoples social responsibilities?

todayilearned,3c73ic,RevDrStrangelove,"Theoretically I see his point. Just look at what we've got now. Instead of starting from scratch every decade, we just call it a ""living document"" and let the lawyers argue which entirely contradictory point of view is supported. Things have crept into being legal or illegal because they weren't specifically addressed in it even though the spirit of the document should have been clear.\n\nThe trouble of course would be that rewriting would require a political system run by people who have the best interests of the people they represent at heart, not their own greed.

todayilearned,3c73ic,BrassBass,I would like to trick them into writing a new one just to see how fucked up they would make it on the people
todayilearned,3c73ic,RottMaster,Based in the idea that the dead have no right to the living. But seeing as how he didn't have prior knowledge of how clogged up the legislative branches are this isn't that unreasonable.

todayilearned,3c73ic,N8thanEL,"Read top comment now, apparently at the time It seemed like a good idea but he later re-stated quite the contrary."
todayilearned,3c73ic,imlucid,"I think 19 years is a bit too short a period of time, but I like the idea of doing something like this say every 50 years. It gives a chance to reflect on what parts work, what parts don't, redistribute certain responsibilities if they can be better handled at a different level of government, and incorporate things that weren't conceivable at previous revisions.\n\nIt could be a good way to bring a greater sense of engagement with civic society if done correctly, but my cynicism says that this wouldn't really be done properly in modern times."
todayilearned,3c73ic,esonlinji,"Disagree. Morals, ideals, societies evolve. It's a great idea each set ammount of years change things that don't work, and polish others. Well, assuming religious parties wouldn't hijack the document."

They did this on schedule a few times, then wrote that part out of the constitution. \n\nThe constitutional conventions involved elections of delegates, and there were twice as many delegates than legislators, so the ""con-con"" was a fairly big deal when it came along. I was kinda disappointed when they stopped doing it."
todayilearned,3c73ic,Nichijo,Everyone thinks Jefferson is all great but he's still the one who was against progress and wanted everyone to be a subsistence farmer. He was also one of the major opponents to outlawing slavery when the US was still in its infancy.
todayilearned,3c73ic,Makabeli,"At that time tackling slavery would have been a disaster. Yea it is cool to judge history by today's morals for Internet cool points but that issue would have distroyed any idea of a nation, and later on almost did."
todayilearned,3c73ic,__Titans__,"They aren't just today's morals. Many countries at the time of the US's conception and before had outlawed slavery and viewed it as being amoral and wrong. It's still undeniable that he was just a horrible person. He set the US back at its very start by opposing legislation instating things that would give a strong structure to a fledgling nation such as a national bank. He was just a horrible person with horrible ideals. Also: looking at historic events through any moral lens has value, especially a modern moral one."

Neither of those are particularly convincing. \n\nMake shit up and pretend we still follow the constitution but we don't (liberal justices)\n\nStick exactly to what was meant at the time, freezing the language in the 1700-1800s (conservative)\n\nAbove is very rough and wrong, but you get my meaning, judicial philosophies that try to deal with interpreting a piece of text.\n\nNeither of those are really very appealing. Constantly replacing the Constitution doesn't sound good to me, but it is fun to contemplate.\n\nI'm actually really glad a bunch of rich, white men wrote the Constitution undemocratically.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,JSStarr,"My first experiences with sushi are with the pre-packaged supermarket kind, that come with ginger, a dab of wasabi, and soy sauce. It only made sense to me to mix the three together and dip the sushi in with the provided chopsticks.\n\nAnother thing I learned later about sushi is to eat the thing in one bite. I used to (and sometimes still do) savor them in half bites."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Troppin,"It is not against the rules to eat sushi in 2 bites. It was ment as ""finger food"".\n\nOn that note, eat it how you want. It's your sushi. \n\nForks aren't for eating, they are for stabbing hands that get to near your sushi. Lol"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,symposes,"Well the idea is that the sushi chef should be tailoring the pieces to the customer. In theory someone with a smaller mouth should get smaller pieces (and probably more of them) than someone with a larger mouth.\n\nI think the take away from all of these sushi rules is that if you have a good Itamae then you probably should be following them fairly closely, as you're paying good money for the experience of having someone look after you and assumedly trying to impress you. In that situation you should be telling the Itamae what you like and dislike while you eat and the Itamae should be tailoring your meal to your tastes.\n\nIf you're sitting in a restaurant with a bunch of sushi ""chefs"" out back that you never see, or a horde of them behind a big glass shield that never interact directly with guests, then by all means do whatever you want with your food."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,brilliantjoe,Did you also know that you are supposed to eat sushi with your bare hands?

todayilearned,3c8hw3,Troppin,"The rules goes like this:cheap sushi, use chopsticks, experience some sushi, use your hands. One of the first things I learned in Japan."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Snuffsis,"I was told it depends on the type of roll. I dont know which goes with what method, but for instance, like a maki roll you would use your hands, and like sashimi you would use chops."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,crackeraddict,"""rolled rice with kappa"" \n\nFantastic."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,f3lbane,"Same. Got a confused, somewhat-horrified look on my face. Wouldn't that just completely drown out the actual flavor? I mean, eat it any way you want it ultimately, but it seems like a waste of the delicate flavours."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,angstycoder,TIL that it's not common knowledge what the ginger is for.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,dont_ban_me_please,"If there are any people like me, it's not common knowledge what sushi is even for."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Chastronaut,"I went to a buffet with a group of friends in high-school and it was apparently the first time of a friend of mine trying sushi. He took a bite and made a disgusted face, and spat it on a napkin. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he thought it was ""some kind of coconut dessert or something"" and was expecting it to be sweet. I couldn't help but laugh at his face, lol."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Lyude,Sushi is the rice.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,THANKS-FOR-THE-GOLD,Yep. Sushi is a special way of preparing rice. It's vinegar fermented rice if I recall correctly.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,LimesToLimes,"It could be offensive in the same way that someone using chopsticks to eat a burger would be offensive, more just funny in my opinion, I have been laughed at by friends for doing that at their house, just depends on the person.\n\nEdit: I was laughed at for using wasabi, not using chopsticks with a burger."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,MYTBUSTOR,"If you can eat a burger with chopsticks, you deserve to eat whatever however you like because those are some mad skills"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,workingal,I think it's offensive to the chef because you're butchering the dish that he's made an effort to prepare for you. Sushi is serious stuff in Japan and the chef will have spent years in training to make it perfect (wiki).
todayilearned,3c8hw3,sprkng,Sushi chefs might be offended to learn that I mostly use sushi as a vehicle and excuse to test my wasabi breaking point.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Opry,"You might be interested in getting real Japanese wasabi, instead of the green-colored horseradish that is usually seen internationally."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,Se7enLC,"Wasabi IS horseradish, right?"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,DuncanMonroe,"No, it's a different plant. Similar, though."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Se7enLC,I thought Japanese wasabi wasn't spicy
todayilearned,3c8hw3,MichiganMan12,It still is but in a different way. I find the horseradish type deeply unpleasant but actual wasabi is much smoother and more pleasant.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,essjay2009,"Agree. Fresh wasabi is, to me, smoother and milder. Instead of burning it actually has a real nice flavor."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,ktappe,"I love the ""fake"" wasabi because of the excellent flavor."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,ResonanceSD,If you can find them try wasabi peanuts. I used to eat lots of wasabi peas until I discovered the peanut alternative and they are so much tastier.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,magictravelblog,"It's definitely spicy, it's just spicy in a different way, because it's not horseradish."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,TheKharmeleon,"When you eat too much of it at one time, does it still send a skin crawling painful brain tickling sensation up your nose?"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,autmnleighhh,"I don't know, but whenever I got sushi in Japan, a small smear of wasabi was between the rice ball and the topping. I never got to self serve it and taste test."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,TheKharmeleon,I just dyed a little inside.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,doubleclapton,You should try Wasabi peas! Dried peas with a layer of Wasabi on them. So good.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,erikv55,"Most ""wasabi"" in Japan is also just horse radish with green food coloring.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,Shamwow22,"I've eaten both, and I honestly can't tell the difference besides the texture. Real wasabi is just a bit more burny in the nose."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,t0mbstone,"As a chef, it's because the real ground wasabi, even when you buy it frozen like the one in the picture looks, is super expensive. My boss isn't gonna pay for every single customer to have the better one."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,s3rk,"I can certainly appreciate the cost aspect. Pretty much every restaurant that had my favorite kind of fresh/pickled wasabi charged for it (like $2), and I was more than happy to pay it!"

todayilearned,3c8hw3,muffblumpkin,"Every place I've ever had it I had to ask for it and it cost more. Completely worth it though. Such a more enjoyable flavor, texture, and burning sensation."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,maninorbit,"Yeah. I've had both. Again, I cannot really tell the difference flavor-wise."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,DragonMeme,"Yeah, I can't tell that much difference between ""fake"" and ""real"" wasabi, especially not if I'm adding soy sauce or anything to it. I can definitely tell the difference between that type of wasabi and pickled/chopped ""Kizami"" wasabi, though!"

todayilearned,3c8hw3,t0mbstone,"Yeah... kind of. Those are not from the root part. It's pickled wasabi shoots/leaves.\n\nIt's a bit like saying you like carrots. But really talking about the carrot greens.. pickled. Technically part of the carrot, but certainly not the part typically associated with carrots. \n\nTecnically correct, though... I suppose."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,ITSigno,"Kizami Wasabi\n\nhttp://www.debragga.com/proddetail.asp?prod=chopped-wasabi\n\n\nWasabi is a rhizome (root vegetable) which naturally grows in clean swiftly running mountain streams or irrigated terraced fields. It has pungent spiciness. Widely marketed powdered or pasted wasabi is a mixture of Western horseradish and mustard. This is the real thing, frozen to retain its freshness.\n\nThis product uses chopped Japanese wasabi root and is a great condiment for both meat and seafood, most especially with the richness of wagyu. The texture and pungent spiciness is almost addictive."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,LOGIC_alien,"Offended?  Shit.  In Japan you can order a round of sushi wasabi-roulette style. (I didn't do the ordering, so I have no idea how to say it in Japanese.)  Beautiful tray of sushi... one of the pieces is a fucking wasabi bomb.  Dig In, and Good Luck!\n\n(OK - hardcore, serious sushi chefs probably don't do this, but regular sushi places aren't overly serious, and everyone enjoys seeing someone's eyes water up and get that pained expression as their sinuses ignite.  Even more so when everyone has had some sake and beer!)"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,tomdarch,I think the thing about sushi that a lot of people forget is that there are hugely varying levels of sushi dining experience. Anything from a casual to a semi-formal to an incredibly formal restaurant could be a sushi restaurant.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,DoogieHueserMD,The chef needs to calm his tits.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,kycube,I'm offended by that
todayilearned,3c8hw3,NIQuribe,My Japanese buddy told me to keep my mouth open when tasting wasabi so it won't be as spicy.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,SimplySabrina,"When I was a kid (7 or 8), the sushi place my family went to had menus that mentioned this same fact.  Unfortunately, I misread the directions as saying that the ginger is meant to ""cleanse your plate"" between different fish.  So, there I was using the little pieces of ginger to wipe down my geta (the wooden ""plate"") in between orders, looking like an idiot.  My older brother eventually set me straight after laughing at me for a while.\n\nAlso, just as a note.  Your title is slightly incorrect.  The ginger is meant to be a palate cleanser in between different types of fish, not in between every piece.  If you're eating more than one piece of salmon, you don't need palate cleansing.  It's only to go from one fish to a different one, where it's useful.  i.e. When changing from eating a piece of salmon to a piece of yellowtail (or any other fish that's not the same salmon), you use the ginger to ensure that you aren't getting flavor notes from the previous fish."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,deruch,"I just use hot sake between different fish. Ginger, for me, colors the whole thing way too much. Even water is better in my opinion for cleansing the palate."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,nutbastard,Who uses that as a topping? Fucking savages.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,Kaison58,"Holy fuck! You gotta take a class before ordering sushi in Japan. Before they even get to eating it, there's a whole lesson on how to sit down, how to pour beer and how to even order!"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Zupwat,"Beer is a popular drink item. The cap is removed for you but you must pour yourself. In groups of two or more, Japanese people pour the beer for each other. In the case of business colleagues, the lower ranking staff must pour for their superiors first.\n\n""Maa maa maa maa."" You must say this when pouring a drink. The person receiving the drink must say ""Oh toh toh toh.""\n\n\nWhat the fuck? Is this made up? This sounds made up."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,arcanition,"It was hard to tell at the start, felt like an idiot when I found out it wasn't serious, but if you don't have any experience it can be hard to judge, I remember when I was in Greece I was warned not to wave at people since that's insulting, how was I meant to know that."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,lally2k8,"Yes, you do pour for each other.  No, you don't chant sound effects while doing so."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,SirWinstonFurchill,"It's a mockumentary, the actors are comedians. It's fairly obvious if you watch the whole thing it's meant to be a joke.\n\nI mean, they even say the sushi is served on Japanese sandals called Geta which are sterilised before use. And then patrons wear them home... which is why Japanese feet smell of vinegar. LOL."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,zap283,"Well that explains it. Now I'm imagining 2 Americans going to Japan and pouring eachother beer while chanting ""maa maa maa"" and everyone in the restaurant just staring at them."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Zupwat,It's kind of subtle!  A lot of this is based on actual cultural things.  You totally do pour for each other in groups and the wooden things they server the sushi on really do look a lot like a traditional sandal called geta.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,zap283,Its the perfect mix of real and fake information
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Fadobo,"Thx for sharing the video. I'm an uncultured oaf, but I learned something new about a food I like. I do not know why people are getting mad about being told how to properly eat something. If I see you throwing ketchup on a taco I just made I'd be like , damn you, put some salsa on that you savage. You can eat a taco with ketchup but it's still wrong."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,ra1nb0w_da5h,That was cool.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,washjonessnz,Using it as a topping is the only way to make the grocery store stuff at all edible IMO.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,FUCKN_WAY_SHE_GOES,"I think you owe it to yourself to try foods the way they're ""supposed"" to be prepared or served, if you can at least once, or in the case of sushi, once or twice during a meal if you're having a lot of it.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, if you decide you want to go off on your own and do things your way, that's your prerogative, and I'm generally suspicious of supposed cultural guardians who get bent out of shape how other people eat food of cultures they aren't brought up in.  The point for me, they're trying new things and liking them at all.  One ""traditionalism"" for sushi I found quite liberating was when I stopped trying to eat it all with chopsticks - apparently it's finger food in Japan and chopsticks are just used to retrieve from a shared plate.\n\nAnother two examples I hear people bitch about lately for some reason is the supposed faux pas of asking for saurkraut on sausage even if you're in the ""wrong"" part of Germany, or in the US, putting ketchup on hot dogs.  I say this as someone who isn't terribly fond of ketchup (where one would normally use ketchup, I'm a bigger fan of barbeque sauce):  it's your fucking hot dog, enjoy it how you enjoy it.\n\nOr enjoying the ""wrong"" style of barbeque in a given region of the US.  That argument sure gets old."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Delusionn,I live in Germany and i never heard of this.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,gorbyyy,Try asking for a well done steak with ketchup to dip it in.\n\nYou'll see.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,NewTRX,"Right? Just eat it how you want, as long as you're not in Japan who cares?"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Nezzatic,"While I agree with the statement because it is your food that you paid for, there are high quality sushi restaurants even in the U.S. where following certain rules create the best taste experience.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,xdyana95,Who the fuck has been using that shit as a topping?  That'd be like setting off an airhorn while trying to listen to a symphony.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,GearBandit,the chefs will put what they think best compliments the fish and rice and then their customer comes along and drenches its with soy sauce and loses the experience the sushi chef was working towards. shit id be pissed too like im trying to create magic in your mouth and then you go and throw the flavors off.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,TheLittleBrownKid,People that eat sushi like that rarely eat sushi made by a chef. More likely sushi made at a grocery store or by a pantry cook at a low-end restaurant. I don't think they're offending anyone.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,BasicAverageQueer,I don't know if I would want to eat at a place where the chef is staring me down the entire meal
todayilearned,3c8hw3,opeth10657,"Nah, you're usually chatting with them and others at the bar. It's awesome, but they may become cold or at least a little dick-ish if you muck it about too much.

todayilearned,3c8hw3,SirWinstonFurchill,they dont like serving people who stare at them lol. most of them have some funny jokes and will have a conversation with you if you allow it.
todayilearned,3c8hw3,TheLittleBrownKid,"Ya, but not GearBandit's comment. I've never seen anyone eat sushi like that in a restaurant with a legitimate sushi chef."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,Swagan,"I, uh...might be guilty of that. At least I fully acknowledge that I eat sushi like a heathen. I'm sure the chef shakes his head every time he sees me scoop up a piece with my fork and dunk it in soy sauce, but damn if it doesn't taste good that way. (I've eaten sushi at several places where the chef is prepping rolls right there in the open and can definitely see my shitty sushi-eating skills, never had anyone comment on it.)"
todayilearned,3c8hw3,goodnightbird,"You should probably just each at a cheap sushi place if you're dunking your sushi in soy sauce. Don't take this comment the wrong way, I'm not judging you, you like what you like, but there's no sense in spending hard earned money on expensive sushi if you mostly enjoy the flavour of rice soaked with soy sauce. You can easily get that at a cheaper place."
todayilearned,3c8hw3,brilliantjoe,"I'm wary of really cheap sushi places, I don't want to get food poisoning. I think I probably eat at mid-level places and I order the sorts of things that would make pretentious eyes roll, so it's probably fine."

todayilearned,3c8hw3,TheLittleBrownKid,"Something to keep in mind- most people don't eat sushi at really nice restaurants. There is a sizable market for mid-range and cheap sushi. \n\nIt's like putting ice in a glass of wine at Olive Garden, or into your boxed wine.

In one version, that she marketed most heavily, was the story of the Benders and Pa. The researchers of the manuscript pointed out that the years simply do not match up. Laura did fictionalize and drop many points (her brother's birth and death, real motive for taking the teaching job at such a young age) but this has been proven as a completely fictionalize literary plot to spice up the book and make it more marketable in the Great Depression.

Room board and tuition was covered. \n\nThe books make it out that the motivation was to help Mary and while I am sure she helped pay for new fabric or toiletries, if Laura did not teach it didn't mean she wouldn't go to school.\n\nOne essay comes to the conclusion that this was a good motivator for Laura to leave home and fed into her family life goals. While in realty, rose wilder lane, Laura's daughter, was an early writer in the libertarianism movement (she's credited with being one of the leading forces in the early movement) and taking 'welfare' and free tuition from the state would paint the family as relying on the government instead of their literary plot of them vs the prairies and being a self sufficient family.\n\nDon't even get me started about the Long Winter!

A girl came up to me and said, ""you know your shirts not black right?"" I really couldn't even respond. I was torn between being exasperated at her ignorance and disgusted that she needed to try such a cheap tactic to tear someone down."

She looked at me and said ""Who's that?"".\n\nIf the girl was 20, that meant she was born probably around 1975."

todayilearned,3c7ue4,GiveMeYourMoneyPLS,Grunge is heavily influenced by punk and fecal matter was more of a punk than a grunge band. With them being heavily influenced by punk bands and grunge kind of being a development of punk and metal music I'd say as an avid punk listener you might've heard of nirvana.\nFact is the girl was wayyyy into rise against.

todayilearned,3c7ue4,thehighground,I really don't mind his acting. I thought he was great at Steve jobs. Seriously. How I read Steve job's biography matched with how Ashton portrayed him. IMO
todayilearned,3c7ue4,HOWARDSTERNSPEN15,yeah but thats actually a reflection on the poorly written biography. 'Jobs' was a fawning whitewash compared to what some other biographers have written on him.
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Shamwow22,"What's wrong? It's not like you need to act well to be in Twilight, anyway."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,CustosMentis,Because Courtney love is an attention whore
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Shamwow22,I rather would've interviewed that hot piece of ass than this washed up murderer
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Wildcat7878,"Well, to be fair: Glenn Danzig, the Metal singer, was offered the role of Wolverine, first, due to his likeness to the character. He turned it down, however, because he had no experience in acting and didn't want to give up his touring.\n\nRealistically, Frances Bean Cobain could have been liked by the casting director(s). She has name recognition, and she would have certainly attracted a wider demographic..people who have never seen the movie, otherwise. It does makes sense, from a certain point of view, but she would deserve a better movie than Twilight."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Shamwow22,"(A)  Danzig claims in that article that he was asked to audition for the role of Wolverine, which is a pretty from cry from being offered the role straight up, and \n\n(B)  Danzig claiming he was asked to audition is more or less the same situation we have here:  someone with an interest in self-aggrandizement claiming to have been approached by someone about a movie role.  I don't know anything about Danzig, I have no idea if he has a propensity to make shit up, but I'd trust this a lot more coming from a neutral party."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Wildcat7878,"IMDB:\n\n\nMusician Glenn Danzig, whose muscular physique and height (5'4"") almost perfectly matched the Wolverine character portrayed in the comic books, was interviewed for the role of Wolverine. A common myth has it that he was offered a part in the movie, but this confusion occurs largely because Danzig was actually offered the role some ten years earlier - when Carolco held the rights to an X-Men film and was considering a low-budget production. However, due to the high-budget and status of the 2000 production, as well as Danzig's age and relative lack of acting experience, and the requirement that the Wolverine actor be signed to a multi-picture deal spanning several years, it is highly unlikely that Danzig could have won the role in Bryan Singer's film. Regardless, a scheduling conflict prevented him from any subsequent pursuit of the role.\n\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/trivia\n\nI apologize for the confusion."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Isopbc,Is Wolverine really supposed to be that short?
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Wildcat7878,"Yup. He's short and heavy, so he can pounce like an animal and take down the big guys."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,flawlesslylogical,"Huh, I had no idea. I was never a comic guy so Hugh Jackman was always my comparison for what Wolverine is supposed to look like."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,g2f1g6n1,"You just hit on the main reason Jackman was a terrible cast for Wolverine... he's like 8 inches too tall. The interplay between him and Cyclops plays way better when Cyclops towers over him.\n\n-edit- I think he's pretty good as wolverine though, just an... interesting.. choice."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,rothael,"Holy cow, I read up on it and Wolverine is officially only 5'3"". Hugh Jackman is 6'2""! As much as I like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, now I kinda wish they had cast a shorter actor to play him. A guy Jackman's size already looks powerful; I think it would have made the character more interesting if they'd cast someone who, at first glance, you wouldn't expect that kind of power from."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,g2f1g6n1,"Also, nice to throw a bone to short guys. Hey, there's a short ugly superhero and he's awesome!"

todayilearned,3c7ue4,TimmyFTW,Oh well in that case I was offered the role of Billy Elliot but had to turn it down so I didn't have to give up Wednesday lunch in High School.
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Son_of_Streak,"He is is 5'4? This is a shock to me because I'm also 5'4 and I rarely see any guys as short as me, even women most of the time are an inch or two taller than me. I wish I had the confidence he has to do what he enjoys. Would be cool though for just one day to not have to look up to everyone, literally."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,BDB_JCD,"generally when casting directors specifically asks a person (especially a non-actor celebrity) to audition, it's mostly just a formality.\n\nThey probably couldn't just approach Danzig (or Francis either) and say ""hey we want you to play this part, just show up and we'll take it from there"" without any kind of backlash from industry unions. so they ask the person in question to show up for an ""audition"", where they're then brought to the casting director, director, and producers who let them know that it's all just a formality and they already have the part if they want to go from there."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,davewiz20,Do you seriously think a studio would put someone who has NEVER acted for a single second in either TV or film in the lead role of a fairly major movie franchise like Twilight? Also the Danzig one has been explained. He was offered a role in a backyard production of X-Men before the rights passed to a major studio.

todayilearned,3c7ue4,Tylandredis,"I'm pretty sure it's a prop - a real guitar, but inaudible in the mix and just there for the singer to look cool with.\n\nI've seen a few of their live things and on most songs you can't hear Love's guitar and she's only playing it half the time, it's dangling behind her the other half. She plays on a few tracks where the second guitar is actually doing something but mostly it's just somewhere for her to keep her hands."

todayilearned,3c7ue4,bunchajibbajabba,So apparently she is referencing the fact that the Twilight movie saga was written by a Mormon housewife https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenie_Meyer
todayilearned,3c7ue4,GiveMeYourMoneyPLS,Ah.
todayilearned,3c7ue4,trash_gordon,"Apparently, some kinds of religious bigotry are OK.  If she had claimed a part was refused on the ground the book was written by a Jew, what would have happened?\n\n(Answer: the right thing.)\n\nEdit:  if you think that evaluating books based on ""identity"" issues of the author might be OK based on what kind of identity you look at (religion, sexuality, ethnicity), find a sturdy vertical surface, like a concrete pillar, and pound your head against it until you are smarter."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,NewbornMuse,"I don't think she refused it because the person who wrote it was Mormon, more of the fact that a lot of traditional mormon ideals and gender roles she disagreed with are sprinkled through the books.\n\nQuite a few people believe that Meyer's religious beliefs influenced the books, in that Bella is quiet and meek, she is overly dependent on her first boyfriend whom she stays with despite his domineering actions, and older age; the fact that she cooks and cleans and adopts a traditional female role to her father, as well as the fact that she places the life of her unborn fetus (which at the time is only a few days old) over her own life. Most of these could just be chalked up to the personality of the character, but people are free to argue about it.\n\nI can see what you're saying though, she could have phrased it a great deal less offensively and made it clear that she disagreed with the ideals, not with the fact that Meyer is a mormon."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,EARTHWAKED,"Also, if I remember right, Bella's wedding (or prom, can't recall which) dress in one of the movies has cap sleeves, keeping with the Mormon code of modesty."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,redrecon,"Yeah, apparently. If this comment was made about christianity in general, someone would reply '3edgy5me' or something. There's just less people to take offense with mormonism rather than some branch of christianity."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,kzielinski,"Cause people don't identify ""Jew"" with the Jewish religion but the ethnicity."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Akintudne,So she's fighting sexism by refusing to support a female entrepreneur?
todayilearned,3c7ue4,Mr_CoolStrats,"Twilight has a lot of very conservative morals woven into it. The whole ""you had sex and now you're gonna die and it's all your fault"" thing as the most prominent example.\n\nFighting sexism is critically thinking about what each piece of art says. A woman can write a sexist book. Basing your decision of what to support on the author's gender alone only leads to trench warfare and is ultimately again sexism."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,magimon02,She's supporting feminism by not supporting a bored Mormon who tritely writes herself into an erotic Harry Potter fanfic where she gets fucked and treated like shit by a vampire. It's shite.
todayilearned,3c7ue4,extracc,"https://stoney321.livejournal.com/317176.html\n\nLong, but totally worth reading the whole thing twice.  Basically, Stephanie Meyer wrote Twilight as a Mormon fan fiction without even realizing it."
todayilearned,3c7ue4,kzielinski,"One of the criticisms made of The work is that Bella is in many ways the picture of a perfect Mormon daughter, extremely passive and with no aspirations other than to look after had father until she goes and gets married."

todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,Interlacing and progressive scan. Completely changes things.
todayilearned,3c771f,dasruckus,NES -> N64 all put out progressive signals over composite (240p). The only exception was a few expansion pack enhanced games on the 64 that supported 480i output. Interlaced signals out of consoles were not common until the 6th console generation.
todayilearned,3c771f,BabyPuncher5000,Where can I learn about what this post means?
todayilearned,3c771f,mbbird,http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/interlaced-vs-progressive-scanning-methods.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate
todayilearned,3c771f,NotJustAnyFish,"Interlaced scan: Traditional TV systems (such as NTSC, the standard TV system in the United States) use an interlaced scan, where half the picture appears on the screen at a time  \n\nProgressive scan: The entire picture is painted at once, which greatly reduces flickering."
todayilearned,3c771f,heilspawn,Also note: Progressive requires double the bandwidth that Interlaced  does.
todayilearned,3c771f,meltingdiamond,Not talking about interlaced.
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,My shoes are interlaced
todayilearned,3c771f,pitchingataint,"Oh, that's risky. I prefer mine to be intralaced so I don't trip."
todayilearned,3c771f,dman87,The screens refresh rate might be 60fps but the content going to it from a game console isn't always such. Even old school games lagged from time to time.
todayilearned,3c771f,dasruckus,"I'm aware slowdowns still happen, but it still runs at 50/60hz. The animations slow during a slowdown in old consoles, but not the framerate. They are locked for 50/60hz regardless. Completely different to these days.\n\nEDIT: There are multiple reasons for this: \n\n\nThe CPU always advances the frame at either 50/60hz depending on region - this is why a PAL game would run faster (not smoother, but the sprites, music, movement were all faster) on an NTSC machine. A fluctuation of the actual framerate would cause actual sync issues with the TV, or the game to glitch, as it is expected that both console and TV are in sync.\nHow many sprites you could have, parallax scrolling etc. were dictated directly by the hardware, meaning there was actual limitations in what you could and couldn't do. More importantly, these were done independently at different rates, meaning a slowdown won't slow down the overall framerate, only the parts that are affected. For example, slowdown of animation/sprite flicker would happen if there are too many sprites on the screen, but parallax scrolling will still be perfectly smooth. The game would simply take more time to do the action per frame, rather than skip/slow the framerate. This can be seen even in emulators, ie. turn off frame skipping.\nThey were programmed differently. The likes of SNES games for example were programmed in low-level assembly and were time critical, ie. done in so many cycles per second. This is why glitches could occur if you run a PAL game on an NTSC machine - some code will simply not run correctly as it expects an exact clockspeed."
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,"Lag aside, plenty of early 3D games had capped framerates. Ocarina of Time ran at 20fps (and then could occasionally lag worse.)"
todayilearned,3c771f,xiaorobear,"Early 3D consoles always suffered framerate issues, bar a few exceptions - the move to 3D most likely meant a move away from time critical programming, shift towards more generalised hardware etc. With the likes of the SNES, framerate was always consistent, even during slowdown."
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,"Same to ""HD"". It's not new. I could do 4000-something by 3000-something resolution on an ancient video card with a CRT."
todayilearned,3c771f,synthead,Go Matrox Go! Show me what you got in your lunchbox!
todayilearned,3c771f,BootstrapBuckaroo,"Why people think 60fps is somehow ""new"" or recent, I really don't know.\n\n\nYes you do :)\n\nIt was lost when consoles and pc in general started producing games heavier than the hardware, so nVidias and ATIs could produce premium gpus (like Titans).\nSuddenly, 30 fps were acceptable. Unless you played CS and then anything bellow 120 was unacceptable. sigh\n\nRegarding the Gameboy, the hardware outputed 60fps, and the LCD accepted them, but the individual cristals couldn't go GTG in 1/60, so ghosting was immense, i mean, really bad.\n\nRegarding 60+ fps @1600x1200, my old Voodoo3 could keep up with them in Q3 and UT99. I even remember 3Dfx having a demo showing the benefits of 60fps , with a bouncing ball and a rotating camera."
todayilearned,3c771f,daedric,"Regarding the Gameboy, the hardware outputed 60fps, and the LCD accepted them, but the individual cristals couldn't go GTG in 1/60, so ghosting was immense, i mean, really bad.\n\n\nThat's true, the LCD screen was terrible. It still ran at 60hz though.\n\n\nRegarding 60+ fps @1600x1200, my old Voodoo3 could keep up with them in Q3 and UT99. I even remember 3Dfx having a demo showing the benefits of 60fps , with a bouncing ball and a rotating camera.\n\n\nRemember playing Half Life 1 at 1024x768 on my first gaming PC, at 60fps or higher - Riva TNT 1, PII 350mhz etc."
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,"AAAhhh... HalfLife. My first pc capable of it was my P3 450 and Voodoo3. Seet memories.\n\nThe previous iterations was a P1 166 (non MMX), with a Cirrus whofuckincares PCI card, so it was Q2 in software at 320x240 or Q1 at same res. Carmageddon was sweat though :)"
todayilearned,3c771f,daedric,TNT 2 was my first video card. Memories.
todayilearned,3c771f,YourPassportNumber,Gameboy pocket and GBC at least seemed to improve the ghosting issue. I'm surprised it took them until the 2000s to add a backlight though.
todayilearned,3c771f,TrimPot,Except for the gameboy light in 98
todayilearned,3c771f,A_Blunt_Object,"Why people think 60fps is somehow ""new"" or recent, I really don't know.\n\n\nBecause The Xbox One and PS4 only run games at 20-30 fps..."
todayilearned,3c771f,skilliard4,"Well, technically the NTSC standard calls for a refresh rate of 59.94 hz.  The thing is though, the video is interlaced which means the actual ""frame rate"" is half of the refresh rate (so about 30 FPS)."
todayilearned,3c771f,ohmyfsm,"You forget that most consoles of the time output 240p rather than 480i, so yes, it was a full 60 fps."
todayilearned,3c771f,s_grimey,"This is not entirely accurat, there are still 60 unique fields per second. Lots of games on the PS2 and Xbox ran at 60 interlaced frames per second, and they were a lot smoother than your typical 30 FPS games. Frame interleaving doesn't mean your content has to be half the refresh rate of the signal."
todayilearned,3c771f,BabyPuncher5000,"Calling it 30fps is just wrong.\n\n480i are rendered at 60fps. It's just the method of transport layer that interlaces it down to 60i. You are just seeing half of the frame, but there are still 60 frames per second. \n\nIf a game were running at 30fps, you'd notice it immediately."
todayilearned,3c771f,ShortFuse,"Correct in a sense. However, things get interesting when dealing with the GBC (Gameboy Color).\n\nThe LCD alternates each frame between drawing odd scanlines slightly dark and even scanlines slightly light and vice versa.\n\nSo it transfers the even or odd rows at once, and then the other. This means it has 60/60/30 (60 fields per second, 60hz, and 30 frames per second), while the original Gameboy is true 60 across the board! This is because there's more data to transfer at once. The more you know!\n\nSource: I'm a Gameboy Developer. www.booyadev.com/nobody.html"
todayilearned,3c771f,Thinkingofsomethingg,"It is still showing 60 unique frames per second, it just interlaces them.\n\nLike, if you play a gamecube game that runs at 60fps like Metroid Prime or Timesplitters 2, if you have Component cables, you can opt to play in progressive scan or not.\n\nEither option feels the same motion wise (always running at 60 fps), but there is a drop in visual quality if you opt out of progressive scan."
todayilearned,3c771f,Tagrineth,"For broadcast and particular video inputs (RCA, S-Video etc), yes. Old consoles run at 50/60hz natively, with some having interlaced modes for higher resolution. The SNES for example ran at 256x224 in 50/60hz progressive or 512x448 with hardware limitations and in interlaced. You can also get progressive scan if your TV has component inputs.\n\nStill does not disprove that consoles did indeed run at 50/60hz.\n\nEDIT: For clarification."
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,Because the OP is 12yo.
todayilearned,3c771f,170lbsApe,Also they don't take into account slowdown. 60 cycles in this regard is always mistaken as framerate. Slowdown was very common on older systems and would bring things down to a measely single digits.
todayilearned,3c771f,strangerreality,The big thing about 60 is consoles rarely do it. Console makers make people think 30 is all the frame rate they need.
todayilearned,3c771f,Plzbanmebrony,"You're talking about recent gen consoles, ie. the PS3 upwards. Older, 2D consoles could do it just fine and pretty much all games output to the refresh rate of the TV (50/60hz). Here's some captures from the NES/SNES for example - no problem pulling off 60fps:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUNzCeesfgw&list=LLb2RNNanNW0wgPPPgaEQV1g&index=1\n\nWhile 60fps was fairly common on consoles like the PS2, early 3D consoles like the N64 or PS1 couldn't often do 60fps more due to the hardware, and 3D being a relatively new area for gaming at the time."
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,"60FPS wasn't even that common with the PS2. Framerate drops were pretty easily forgiven. Hell, one of the most popular series on the PS2, SOCOM, ran at sub 25 fps a lot of the time:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBVWLUXdH68\n\nPeople just didn't care much about FPS on console until a month before the PS4 launched when it was way too late for Sony or MS to do anything about their consoles' hardware specs. Those things were made for 30 fps and higher quality graphics, not for 60 fps and higher quality graphics."
todayilearned,3c771f,Piemonkey,Hell of a lot more common compared to later gen consoles. Same with the Dreamcast. Not sure about the original Xbox - never owned it.
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,"I'm pretty sure that at this point, the PS4 already has more 60fps game relative to its library size than any console since the SNES."
todayilearned,3c771f,Piemonkey,I know what this means.
todayilearned,3c771f,Elturiel,"Wrong. \n\nJust because the display CAN run at 50/60Hz, doesn't mean the graphics card is pumping out 50/60FPS."
todayilearned,3c771f,stromm,"Their CPUs are clocked differently for 50/60hz (hence why an NTSC console would run PAL games faster if able to). I already pointed out in another post that consoles like the SNES run at 50/60hz progressive at resolutions such as 256x224. You obviously have no clue how older consoles generate graphics either - they don't have ""graphics cards"" in the sense we know today.\n\nThe interlaced issue is more to do with the screens, not the consoles."
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,"Er, older consoles used dedicated sprite hardware that was guaranteed to run at the given framerate. It was literally impossible to render more and achieve slowdown - the only way to draw to the screen was through the sprites and layers provided to you (no framebuffer for arbitrary drawing), and if you needed more sprites you had to reuse an existing sprite by drawing each of them every other frame (causing flicker)."

todayilearned,3c771f,djlewt,"It's a really low refresh rate. It updates 60 times per second, but it takes a while for the pixels to fade out, so you get a smudge effect during fast motion.\n\nSome games exploited this by having an object flicker on/off each frame, giving it a transparency effect. An example is the credits in Link's Awakening. Unfortunately a lot of emulators don't bother to emulate this effect, so you just see rapid flickering instead and maybe have a seizure. If your Game Boy emulator has an option like ""frame blending"" or ""motion blur"" (or possibly even something silly like ""interlacing"", even though that's something different), turn it on to simulate the real Game Boy screen and have blur and transparency instead of ugly flickering."

todayilearned,3c771f,tkornfeld,Is that a lot or not very much?
todayilearned,3c771f,x-skeww,"Cinema uses 24 FPS. They use strong motion blur in general and additional blur to mask the painfully obvious stuttering during pans. ""High frame rate"" (HFR) movies like The Hobbit used 48.\n\nToday's console games often run at 30 FPS and only a few of them run at 60.\n\nPC games can run at 60 FPS if your hardware is good enough. Up to 144 FPS are possible with some monitors, but that's the exception. You usually don't reach that kind of frame rate with new games, even if you got high-end hardware.\n\nFor 2D games, 60 FPS is great. For fast-paced first person games, it's pretty good, but not perfect. For virtual reality, it's not enough and it will most likely make you sick.\n\nFor 2D/3D, 30 FPS is usable but it doesn't look smooth."
todayilearned,3c771f,tkornfeld,"""You usually don't reach that kind of framerate"" No. No. No. You can, as long as you have a fairly new GPU."

todayilearned,3c771f,kzielinski,HAHA
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,I've seen someone do this comparison before. It turns out that in a lot of ways the complexity and inefficiency in software has increased faster then the speed of hardware. The end result is that the current version of a lot of programs take longer to do the same thing that older versions did.  One point Personal Computers used to boot in under 10 seconds.
todayilearned,3c771f,kzielinski,They still do if you get an SSD.
todayilearned,3c771f,Shledge,Yes boot speed has become sufficently important that people started working on it. But in between we had a good 10 - 20 years when most PC's where taking minutes to boot.
todayilearned,3c771f,dosskat,PCs around Windows 95/98 didn't take more than a minute to boot.
todayilearned,3c771f,Darkromani,"Initially perhaps, assuming you had a brand new and clean install of Windows and nothing else. Give it a few months and install a few applications that you need, and boot speed tended to drag on longer and longer."
todayilearned,3c771f,molotoviphone,"Never lasted more than a minute - if it lasted longer then it's an indicator of something else ie. a resource intensive program on bootup, bad care of your PC etc. You're talking to someone who owned various PCs since the mid 90s."

todayilearned,3c771f,nmotsch789,I have a pc for that. I enjoy Wiiu games and the fact they run at a native 1080p and 60 fps is just icing on the cake.
todayilearned,3c771f,RobertAPetersen,No wii u game runs at 1080p native unless it's some indie game
todayilearned,3c771f,abczyx123,"Yeah, no. They're not Wii games running at native resolution. They're full fledged Wii U HD games."
todayilearned,3c771f,nickyzhere,"Why use a WiiU for games that don't take advantage of the gamepad and aren't exclusive? Even most mid-range prebuilt PCs could run the majority of games out there, why play them on a WiiU?"

todayilearned,3c771f,random_username_25,"I didn't think it refreshed the entire screen, just moving elements on it."
todayilearned,3c771f,Cohacq,Ya you move elements by drawing a new frame. The only way you change only certain elements of the display is if you make up the display with a bunch of smaller displays on their own clock. But that's pretty stupid.
todayilearned,3c771f,president_of_derp,Jesus fuck me for being curious

todayilearned,3c771f,president_of_derp,Yes it did. How did you think it worked?
todayilearned,3c771f,kukienboks,"I didn't know, thus the question mark. Fuck me I guess"
todayilearned,3c771f,justsomescrub,"Yes,  it had an LCD screen with a native refresh rate of 60Hz (updates per second) just like most screens today.  And just like today,  the game would need to  draw frames at the same rate to avoid dropped or repeated frames (judder)."
todayilearned,3c771f,president_of_derp,Thank you for being the first to actually answer my question

todayilearned,3c88o5,warnerrr,"From the Physical Attributes section\n\n\nIndurain had a physiology superior to fellow athletes, according to the Ferrara institute. His blood took seven litres of oxygen around his body per minute, compared to 3–4 litres for an ordinary person and 5–6 litres for fellow riders. His cardiac output was 50 litres a minute; a fit amateur cyclist's is about 25 litres. Indurain's lung capacity was 7.8 litres, compared to an average of 6 litres. His resting pulse was as low as 28 BPM, compared to an average 60–72 bpm, which meant his heart would be less strained in the tough mountain stages.\n\n\nThis guy was almost superhuman. I forgot to mention it in the title, but he won the Tour de France 5 times in a row."

todayilearned,3c88o5,subpargalois,"Sounds like blood doping. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I remember people saying similar things about Lance Armstrong."
todayilearned,3c88o5,tomdarch,"To operate at that level you need freak DNA and astounding training (and as it turns out, the best doping.)\n\nThat's the frustrating thing about these guys.

todayilearned,3c88o5,subpargalois,Another way of looking at that is that you are a pretty good distance runner and his heart is still a whooping 35% more efficient.
todayilearned,3c88o5,Element72,"It's also genetic. My father and brother have HR of 34 and 37. They are in pretty good shape, bicycles in amateur races and such. But my HR is 40 (womens are typically 10 beats higher, so for comparision it's like I was a male with HR of 30) and I do nothing but slowly commute 5 miles a day on bike."

todayilearned,3c88o5,historicusXIII,"No one really doubts he used blood doping (even though never proven), but this could be achieved with the right genetics plus excessive training. The doping came on top of that."
todayilearned,3c88o5,terribads,and lance WAS tested.. he was just clever enough to cheat the tests.
todayilearned,3c88o5,camsmith328,It should be known Michele Ferrari is a known doping expert and is basically the backbone to all doping in the professional cycling world. This rider was most definitely doping.
todayilearned,3c88o5,dgran73,"I've followed professional cycling for decades and I'm pretty familiar with the serial doping sagas, but I'm not aware of any definitive evidence that he doped.  The time when he was winning (1991-1995) his five Tour de France titles EPO was starting to emerge.\n\nMy understanding is that the routes of the Tour in those years were well suited to him.  He would win time trials with a margin of minutes on his rivals and them limit his losses in the mountains.  The modern grand tours seem to have shorter time trials and more mountain finishes which favors a different style of rider.  This reflects on the preference of fans but the courses suited his strength and he seemed to be quite in a separate league.\n\nI recall reading something a few years ago about Indurain took part in a study to observe how much form elite athletes could retain.  The guy was over 50 years old and after a few months of training he was still able to produce power that would be the envy of domestic professionals (if the term isn't familiar, think of this as minor league of pro cycling).  The dude was born to ride a bike."
todayilearned,3c88o5,camsmith328,"My bad, I was watching a documentary just last night following lances whole story and they talked about the widespread doping at the time. I'm willing to believe you however, you made a good point on the tour at the time suiting him."

todayilearned,3c88o5,PM_ME_UR_TROLLS,"Interestingly, having a resting heart rate this slow can be really detrimental to his future health. Hugely increases his risk of getting heart failure."
todayilearned,3c88o5,LothariosCat,"Are there any studies that support what you are suggesting for an athlete?\n\nLooking up ""slow heart rate"" the only real concern seems to be electrical problems or some other underlying issue which is a separate from the heart rate itself. So, again, this is regarding athletes specifically.\n\nI know its not popular here to say ""citation needed"", but I see way too many arm-chair experts to just accept this without some justification."
todayilearned,3c88o5,PM_ME_UR_TROLLS,"There are not many studies because people have only recently realised that over-training is bad. Furthermore, the wikipedia article about athletes hearts is just completely terrible. Here are a couple of studies that back up what I say though.\n\nAlso, what /u/GrayEidolon said is completely correct. No idea why they are getting downvoted."
todayilearned,3c88o5,GrayEidolon,A slow heart rate means the heart has to pump more blood per beat.  To pump more blood with each contraction the ventricles have to get stronger.  So they get thicker.  A thicker ventricle is a stiffer ventricle.  A stiffer ventricle is more prone to fail.
todayilearned,3c88o5,enterfunnynamehere,But there's a difference between ventricular hypertrophy cause by poor health (HTN especially) and hypertrophy caused by improved athleticism.  His heart doesn't have to beat 60-100 bpm because it is more efficient than a non-athletic heart.
todayilearned,3c88o5,GrayEidolon,Browsing PubMed the difference seems to be the how thick the wall actually is.  >15 mm is considered pathological.
todayilearned,3c88o5,ArcherSterling925,Tortoises have even lower resting rates and can usually live twice as long as a regular human being
todayilearned,3c88o5,PM_ME_UR_TROLLS,"Yes but a tortoise's heart is designed evolved to have a low resting heart rate. A human's heart did not. \n\nBasically, whenever your heart rate decreases it needs to pump more blood more forcefully around the body. This results in the wall of your heart getting thicker due to increased muscle in the wall of the heart. Up to a point this is quite good. However, if it your heart rate gets too slow and the wall of your heart gets too thick, this can result in your heart not pumping normally. Due to the increased distance that electrical impulses have to travel and the slower conductance speed due to increased resistance, one part of your heart will no longer beat in time with another part of your heart. This will lead to arrhythmias and potentially heart failure. It is one of the biggest reasons so many ageing athletes now require pacemakers for their heart to beat properly.\n\nEdit: A word.

todayilearned,3c88o5,kickintheteat,"Uh....50 litres per minute? That sounds like bullshit. Normal CO is 4-8 litres per minute. CO is cardiac output, SV is stroke volume (blood ejected from the heart every beat/contraction), HR is well...heart rate. CO is calculated as follows: \n\n\nCO = HR x SV\n\n\nIn order to put out 50 litres per minute at a heart rate of 28 bpm, that means his stroke volume was somewhere around 1785.7 ml per beat. I am not a cardiologist or anything, but nearly half a gallon of blood pumped per beat sounds like BULLSHIT. Now, if they're claiming the 50 litres per minute happens while riding/exercising, we can assume a high heart rate as around 160 bpm would give us a stroke volume of 312 milliliters. That's slightly more believable. Still, that's about a can of soda per beat. Hard to believe. If we assume a heart rate of 200 bpm, that gives us 250 ml per beat, still not very believable.\n\nIn this article: http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/39/4/190.full.pdf\nThe highest recorded stroke volume does not even hit 200ml per beat.

todayilearned,3c88o5,justrun21,"No. Saying that the average was 60 is very misleading. 60 is average for a moderate-high fitness level in a white adult male from the upper-middle class. That is where most of these ""averages"" for things like blood pressure, heart rate, etc. come from. That said, it is likely you are not moderately or highly fit. You might even be out of shape. Maybe your genes dictate a higher heart rate, too. But don't worry, you fall within the ""normal"" range."
todayilearned,3c88o5,giantnakedrei,"Measure your pulse immediately after waking up and before standing or sitting up.  Or go lay down for 5-10 minutes and measure your pulse before you get up - that's your resting heart rate, which is what is referenced here."
todayilearned,3c88o5,bssoup,Not at all. Avg is actually between 60-100. Try it at different times of the day at different levels of activity.
todayilearned,3c88o5,tehdang,Do more cardio and you'll be fine.
todayilearned,3c88o5,hyptos,"It's not that uncommon. A lot of young athletes that can get through have a really low BPM. For instance, when I was 18 I was usually less than 40 bpm. At the time, I went to a cardiologist to check if everything was in order because I scared my doctor.\n\nI admit 28 is really low but with some DNA + the training. It doesn't surprise me that much."

todayilearned,3c88o5,AtavistHermit,"... he said, intelligently pedaling himself away from confrontation and challenge."
todayilearned,3c88o5,justrun21,I think you have the idea of what it means to have a low heart rate backwards. That's a good thing. It means that the volume of blood his heart pumps with each beat is so great that it does not need to pump as quickly as someone else's to pump the same amount of blood around his body.
todayilearned,3c88o5,AtavistHermit,how much does he bench?
todayilearned,3c88o5,camsmith328,5 Tour de France wins is probably his pr.

This came as a surprise to Yasso considering this regime had actually criticized Yasso for questioning their nationalization of Iraqi schools. According to an interview Yasso gave in 2003 with the AP, Saddam Hussein was making donations to Chaldean churches across the world at that time, so giving money to his church wasn’t necessarily out of the ordinary for Iraq’s president. Plus, Detroit had the largest Chaldean population in the United States, who predominately supported the rise of Hussein in Iraq.\n\nYasso and Hussein kept in touch, and about a year later, in 1980, along with about twenty five people from the Detroit Chaldean community, he was a guest of the Iraqi government and arrived in Baghdad. Then, he was led into Saddam’s palace. In the same interview, Yasso states “We were received on the red carpet.” At some point during the celebration, Yasso presented Saddam Hussein a gift from then-mayor of Detroit, Coleman Young, a key to the city, which of course at this point in the practice of giving keys out didn’t unlock anything, but was merely a symbolic honor.""\n\nBack when Saddam was cool.

todayilearned,3c7cnk,SpringenHans,"You're bringing a modern viewpoint to a historical situation it simply can't explain, though.  First snd foremost, the Whiskey Rebellion was seen as a danger to the national unity of the US at one of its most critical points in its existence.\n\nWe had a massive debt crisis to tackle, and the government believed a temporary tax would seek to alleviate some of the burden that was voluntarily imposed upon the officials in government (as in the aristocracy footing most of the bill).  To create domestic upheaval in an already unstable state would've risked everything being undone, as in making us more weak to a revived British conquest.  They weren't fighting Napoleon then, mind you, so they might've stood a chance with the financial recovery period.\n\nI'm not saying Washington was tight by putting down the Whiskey Rebellion (and he regretted it in private correspondences), but he didn't really have a choice.  Furthermore,  he wasn't opposing whiskey; he was eliminating the seeds for turmoil that had the potential to undue the legacy left behind by himself and his soldiers, who shed blood that they might be free"

todayilearned,3c98z6,KynElwynn,Or the death of a pregnant woman by falling off a moving vehicle.

Their solution, add a 30 second slow motion zoomed in clip of a women in a bikini walking out of the ocean, for 25 seconds of the clip you can't even see her face.

todayilearned,3c7leq,nyctibius,The House Wren makes a rattlesnake-like sound as well. A few weeks ago I thought I'd passed a rattler.

todayilearned,3c7leq,ADDEDIT-R,Meanwhile the real rattlesnakes stop rattling because those that rattle get killed by people.

todayilearned,3c7lh5,PuddinPopped,"and it's under constant threat by it's neighbors who are threatening to ""wipe them out"" or ""push them into the sea""\n\nlol... gee wonder why so many of them moved to the US?"
todayilearned,3c7lh5,st1y_wan_kenobi,Or you know... they never lived in Israel to begin with.
todayilearned,3c7lh5,rhayward,...because their parents/grandparents immigrated from Israel... because of the shit i mentioned...
todayilearned,3c7lh5,st1y_wan_kenobi,"Their parents/grandparents could have lived anywhere. There were jews in Europe, Russia, Asia, Africa and in the Americas 100-150 years ago. But yes, that area of the Ottoman empire was very disputed, and still is to this day, despite not being part of an ""Empire"" anymore. My point was that Jews could have moved to the US from anywhere, not just Israel."
todayilearned,3c7lh5,rhayward,"Most of our ancestors lived in Europe, North Africa, Middle East, etc. then moved to America, then their descendants moved to Israel during its creation"
todayilearned,3c7lh5,ramen_poodle_soup,"AFAIK most of the Jews that live in Israel immigrated from Europe after the holocaust.\nThen a bunch of Jews from Russian joined (like myself, both parents are from Russia) and following this there was a big immigration wave from Africa and the Arabic states (those waves containing Jews that originated from there).\nThe Jews who lived in the US mostly stayed there, and, actually, after the holocaust lots of Jews decided to go to the US, and it has nothing to do with fearing extinction.."

todayilearned,3c7lh5,brs677,"Israel is actually a gorgeous country, with places like Tel Aviv serving as a world technological hub and world class universities like the Technion and Hebrew University, which have produced many Nobel laureates. In fact, many technologies you use every day were probably developed in Israel. Plus, with their innovations in irrigation and farming, they actually have water surpluses during droughts.

todayilearned,3c7lh5,ramen_poodle_soup,damn you're dumb.
todayilearned,3c7lh5,smocesumtin,Israel isn't really secular. While freedom of religion is guaranteed Israel's constitution declares it a Jewish state.
todayilearned,3c7lh5,blaknwhitejungl,"Israel isn't really secular. While freedom of religion is guaranteed Israel's constitution declares it a Jewish state.\n\n\nWould you say that the UK and denmark aren't secular?  The UK is an Anglican(-Christian) state and Denmark is a Christian state. Even Norway is an officially Christian nation.\n\nAnd all of those are State Religions, where Israel doesn't have an official State Religion, it just is a Jewish State. I'm not really sure how the difference works, but wikipedia goes over it a little bit: \n\n\nIsrael: Israel is defined in several of its laws as a ""Jewish and democratic state"" (medina yehudit ve-demokratit). However, the term ""Jewish"" is a polyseme that can describe the Jewish people as both an ethnic or a religious group. The debate about the meaning of the term ""Jewish"" and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals.\n\nThe State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly Orthodox Jewish ones, and recognizes the ""religious communities"" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate. These are: Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin [Catholic], Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian [Catholic], Chaldean [Uniate], Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community is a vestige of the Ottoman period[citation needed] during which Islam was the dominant religion and does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by the 2009 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law: the Druze (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and the Bahá'í.[40] These groups have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status matters (see millet system)."

todayilearned,3c9xyl,SoiledShip,"This may be a really stupid question, but quick internet research did not yield a good answer.\n\nIf the gravity is so low, and the atmosphere so extended, why is it not blown away by the solar wind, like Moon(0.55 x mass) or Mars (x4.8 mass)?\nBut then again Venus is just a bit smaller than Earth (1.2 x mass), and has an incredibly thick (90x earth) atmosphere.  \n\nWhat gives? Does gravity play a big role at all, or are other factors simply stronger?"
todayilearned,3c9xyl,i_drah_zua,"Titan's atmosphere is ""protected"" by Saturn's magnetosphere, that's why it doesn't get blown away. Venus has a strong magnetic field, too, Mars doesn't."

todayilearned,3c9xyl,Wizzle-Stick,"It wouldn't burn without oxygen.  You'd still have to watch out for it though, because it's, like, negative all of the degrees.  All of them.  And it's approximately as good as water for conducting heat away from you.  I mean, the atmosphere is probably equally as absurdly cold, but at least it's a dry cold.

todayilearned,3c8skx,tallerthanunicorngod,"I don't think there is a conspiracy not to find cures. Just to make it as expensive as possible. Money rules all business and health care is a big business. \n  I've had doctors prescribe multiple medications that didn't help my problem. After months of pills, sprays, and procedures I got no better. After one month with a personal trainer my problem was gone. I went back to the doctor for a follow up and told her I was better. She said what the trainer had me do was her last resort if all the medications didn't work. \n  My question was, why the hell would she give me 15 medications and 4 procedures (costing the tax payers tons of money) if she knew that simple lifestyle changes and exercises could fix it?\n  I know she could just be a bad doctor. I know she thought her meds and/or exercises would help. But she chose the one that would generate money. It's a corrupt system.  How corrupt is up for debate."
