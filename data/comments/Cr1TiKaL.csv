Cr1TiKaL,3e0uut,TheAdmiralCrunch,10,Tue Jul 21 21:06:57 2015 UTC,So...Cr1tikal confirmed for working for Valve back in 2005 i guess.
Cr1TiKaL,3e0uut,ThundercuntIII,13,Tue Jul 21 04:52:15 2015 UTC,Given that he was probably about 12 in 2005...
Cr1TiKaL,3e0uut,iCeCoCaCoLa64,10,Tue Jul 21 06:20:48 2015 UTC,He probably talked like this when he just came out of the uterus / was dropped on earth from a distant planet

I'd bet he does both and decides which one is funnier, then uploads, as some of his stuff seems like an immediate reaction. Either way, he's a genius and I can only wish that I had a fraction of his wordplay talent."

Moreover, the qualifying round took place in Universal Studio, which would probably be difficult to get into unless you planned it [disclaimer: I've never attended such an event]. The finals film schedule didn't specify the location further than ""Orlando,"" so it was probably somewhere more public, so it's more likely that he showed up on the second day."

Edit: Looking at the past 2 seasons as reference, the finals are aired in the same order as the qualifiers, and typically begin a week or two after the last qualifying round. According to this filming schedule, there are only 2 tryouts filmed (Pittsburgh/Swissvale, and Military/San Pedro). This suggests that ""Military"" will be the last qualifier to be aired, and then the finals will begin."

His old stuff and new stuff is equally as good in my opinion, we've all just gotten more used to his humour over the years, so it's not as hard-hitting to some of us now. I'm sure if you showed ten people who've never heard of cr1tikal before one of his old videos, and then showed ten other people one of his new videos, both groups would laugh just as hard."

From the two videos uploaded by TheNJG2001 on youtube I have concluded that Cr1tikal is not blue sweatshirt guy, but in fact the gray sweatshirt guy. TheNJG2001 missed something that might further back up my case. Since Cr1tikal said he followed the interviewers around i am thinking that the two people behind the boy scout, who look exactly like the people sitting in the stands, are Cr1tikal and his girlfriend.  this guy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaZKNhIPnqw  http://imgur.com/a/wH7Yw/titledesc  sources, courtesy of TheNJG2001:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIil-8xARf4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNTROfPP8fg"

Cr1TiKaL,37bdil,Spinetablet,13,Tue May 26 13:27:52 2015 UTC,in his story he mentions a point where the people wanted everyone to switch from a golf clap to a full-on clap and he took it as a cue to hang over the railing and do the airplane. this little clip reflects that to me   edit: look where the dude is in comparison with everyone sitting. that's a FULL-ON lean over the rail and the arms are almost completely spread out.

From the two videos uploaded by TheNJG2001 on youtube I have concluded that Cr1tikal is not blue sweatshirt guy, but in fact the gray sweatshirt guy. TheNJG2001 missed something that might further back up my case.  Since Cr1tikal said he followed the interviewers around i am thinking that the two people behind the boy scout, who look exactly like the people sitting in the stands, are Cr1tikal and his girlfriend.

Which would mean the patreon account is just a facade to fool us into giving more money to Cr1tikal, when in reality, he's doing just fine thanks to NBC's payout, and as a results, Cr1tikal sends the money from patreon straight to even more charities.   If this is true, it would only prove wholeheartedly that he is indeed a dystopian nipple machine: The savior our world not only needs, but deserves.

Also, around 2010-2011 he posted a donation link on his Youtube feed (not a video) for a surfer who had cancer and claimed he had donated himself. On the page it would list everyone who donated (First name, Last name, and where they were from). I found a Charlie White who was from Tampa, Florida on that list that only had about 100 people listed on it. Not 100%, but I'm pretty sure it's him considering he claimed he donated."
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,Smodoopa,15,Thu Apr 16 23:33:56 2015 UTC,Oh wow I'm from the Tampa Bay area. This makes my chances of somehow running into cr1tikal increase by 10 fold. That's pretty rad.
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,thegeekykid47,7,Fri Apr 17 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"Chances are that you won't recognize him. We know next to nothing about him, only his name, general area of where he lives and of course his interests in video games."
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,LexLugerChantSample,4,Sun Apr 19 18:59:34 2015 UTC,"well, someone has recognized him purely by voice, as he told in one of the latest videos"
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,nordmif,0,Wed Apr 29 08:01:15 2015 UTC,That was posted prior to that video.

Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,nordmif,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"Somebody uploaded a video to YouTube ~12 hours ago (was deleted after a few hours though) in which he found a Charlie White on Facebook, looked up who his girlfriend was, found her on Instagram, created a fake account and commented ""haha classic Cr1TiKaL"" one one of her photos. The girl replied with something like ""How do you know that?"" so it's safe to say at least the ~180 random people who saw the video know what he looks like.  I'm 2 months late to the discussion but I just wanted to share this."

Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,Smodoopa,7,Fri Apr 17 07:40:24 2015 UTC,Charlie White   How this might actually be him. He mentioned before (in one of his videos) that he wasn't that good at basketball.
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,Darth_Dio,3,Fri Apr 17 08:44:02 2015 UTC,I don't know. He did go 2 for 2 on his free throws.  :P
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,Captain_Blood,2,Sat Apr 18 02:53:54 2015 UTC,Probably was the only CHarlie in the credits.

Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,THEfogVAULT,5,Thu Apr 16 19:37:03 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the only hint towards his name at any time was a YouTube comment.   Not that a YouTube comment should ever be taken seriously.
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,Captain_Blood,6,Sat Apr 18 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"His name is Charlie, right?"
Cr1TiKaL,32u3ca,The-Archivists,6,Thu Apr 16 19:20:22 2015 UTC,How do you know?

Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,JoeDaEskimo,48,Wed Apr 15 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"I think after donating for so long he deserves to earn some YouTube money, there are far less deserving guys out there who probably don't donate anything.  Aside from that, he really seems to enjoy Bloodborne."
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,CracklyRabbit,23,Wed Apr 15 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with this. Hell with over a million subscribers and pretty consistent content it's crazy pretty wild that he makes no money.  There are people with far fewer subscribers that make enough to live comfortably, so I wouldn't even see this taking way too much away from the money going to charity"
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,dumppee,22,Thu Apr 16 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"Did a quick bit of maths on the total that he's donated and it's come to $78390 over the last 32 months. Pretty impressive, especially considering all that was mentioned in the video."
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,pnw0,19,Thu Apr 16 00:56:09 2015 UTC,If I had that much money with which to do whatever I want I can't say that I would be able to donate it all. Cr1TiKaL is a great man.
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,ShadowShine57,-1,Thu Apr 16 02:48:34 2015 UTC,wut.
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,SomeDrawing,22,Thu Apr 16 11:04:35 2015 UTC,I'm sad to hear the job market hasn't been favorable to Cr1tikal and have no problem with him taking a 50/50 split of money he rightfully earned. The fact that he still wants to donate 50% (that's 50% more than most every other Youtuber) despite economic hardships is just a testament to how great a person he is.  I am actually intrigued to contact him and provide him some lines for him to read for a new video of mine...
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,naynaythewonderhorse,17,Thu Apr 16 00:54:43 2015 UTC,CR1TIKAL is literally a saint. A foul mouthed titty-loving saint. He should do what he needs to to get by.
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,SurfeitOfLampreys,6,Thu Apr 16 05:25:19 2015 UTC,We condone it Cr1tikal.  Your job should be making us laugh.  Any thing else would be too great a waste of talent.
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,Anivia_Blackfrost,4,Thu Apr 16 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile in the comments....""Turning off adblock for you.""  Are you saying you'd turn off adblock for him.... but not for charity which is something he is very passionate about...? Wow...."
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,daesie,12,Thu Apr 16 07:49:14 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, I'm a pretty recent subscriber and wasn't aware that he's donated literally all of the money he's made from youtube."
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,kawzeg,10,Thu Apr 16 08:53:43 2015 UTC,"Tbh, the fact that he doesn't shove that fact in your face makes it even better"
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,daesie,3,Thu Apr 16 17:36:55 2015 UTC,Learning that he does this really raised my respect for him.
Cr1TiKaL,32qrn9,Starheaven07,4,Thu Apr 16 19:00:55 2015 UTC,he also tweets copies of the reciepts (with the sensitive info blacked out) whenever he donates the money.  He discloses all of it.
Cr1TiKaL,32d81n,C_born,14,Sun Apr 12 20:35:35 2015 UTC,I feel like I just heard Cr1TiKaL's real voice in 2:10.

For some reason my phone decided that that was a noble pursuit and so started notifying me whenever he has a new video. I didn't set it to do this and it doesn't happen for any of the other channels I'm subscribed to, so I'm genuinely mystified as to why it happens."

Cr1TiKaL,30le1u,LilJonWhatSample,2,Sat Mar 28 14:45:13 2015 UTC,Just said in a recent video that he was like a human studies major or something.

At worst you're helping people who'd want to doxx him, and at best you can say you know who he is on the off chance you meet him in-game, and at least when recording it's pretty clear he has no interest in engaging with people.

Like a lot of teens back in the day, I faked my account's age so I could truly watch anything on youtube. Cr1T could've done the same thing. Also, a guy in one of Cr1T's video comments claiming to have watched Cr1T's streams (7+ yrs ago) claimed to have heard the man himself say he's sixteen on stream, thus speculated he's in his early twenties today. That viewer could be wrong, but seeing how Cr1T acted in his very early videos, I won't dismiss his claims entirely.   And here's the biggest proof of his younger age, it's one of Cr1TiKal's old vids: http://youtu.be/2UWESF3MUhQ Midway through this video, Cr1TiKal is interrupted and resumes, mentioning that, within the hiatus, he whipped out his dong, showed his teachers, and got As in all his classes. He was either in high school or in college when he made this particular video."

Cr1TiKaL,2f7vhi,dmall2,7,Tue Sep 2 03:11:56 2014 UTC,I discovered him when a friend showed me his ski jumping pairs video. I think the was the hardest I had laughed at a YouTube video in a long time so I instantly started watching his other videos and soon subscribed to him.
Cr1TiKaL,2f7vhi,Hounds_of_war,7,Tue Sep 2 02:47:11 2014 UTC,"I discovered him this week. I don't even like gaming, and I watched 70% of his videos already, which is partly due to me having no life whatsoever. It's his quick observational wittiness and wordplay, combined with determination to play the most ricidulous games he sometimes doesn't even seem to like (like the horror games), and he just seems like a good guy. He's funnier than most sitcoms I watch.  Isn't this video pretty groundbreaking for him by the way? Talking about himself and shit. It seems like he opens up more, even if it's just for his fans. I just hope he keeps doing his thing, and I guess he will."
Cr1TiKaL,2f7vhi,ThundercuntIII,3,Tue Sep 2 11:20:04 2014 UTC,"that was my first video too! i looked up a guide to find some melee weapons cause thats what i wanted to do in new vegas and saw that and was laughing my ass off the entire time when all i wanted was a guide, and i watched a bunch of his videos and subbed immediately"

I loved cr1tikal since the first video I saw of him; I believe it was the Slender one at about 1 A.M. I never laughed that hard at a gameplay video ever on youtube. I ended up being awake until about 6 A.M. watching his videos, each one funnier and more original than the last. I could not think of a better person to have a million subscribers than him. He really does make a statement by making this heartfelt video of a million subscribers, whereas youtubers like Pewdiepie, Smosh, and others just make lame skits/ game commentaries to thank their viewers. Cr1tikal just seems to be a humble, likable guy who does videos for our enjoyment AND his, all while not making profit. Amazing."

He is an awesome guy, donates to charities, and isn't afraid to voice his opinions, however vulgar they may be. He deserves his subscribers more that any other youtuber I've seen(Especially Pewdiepie)."
Cr1TiKaL,2f7vhi,Wildfire63010,3,Thu Sep 4 12:31:29 2014 UTC,"I watched an old Battlefield video of his ages ago and he mentioned something about a heart condition of his, and I've been somewhat concerned over the last few years about this, thinking that he'd probably never breathe another word about it and then just drop dead suddenly one day. And as much as I've never met the guy, after watching his videos over the last few years, I probably prefer him as a person to most people I actually know. It's somewhat relieving to hear him call himself a hypochondriac because hopefully that's all that was."
Cr1TiKaL,2f7vhi,WildTurkey81,2,Wed Sep 3 03:42:08 2014 UTC,Shit nigga if I heard he died I'd probably cry.

Cr1TiKaL,22w3in,Radler13,6,Sun Apr 13 21:34:48 2014 UTC,"He said he was interested awhile back, and later on said that he didn't know if he would be able to, because he doesn't do a wide range of voices. But I believe he did say in that video that he was still actively looking for auditions and if anyone was working on a game or a project and needed a voice actor to send him a message on Youtube. This was a few months ago though, so I don't know if that has changed."

Cr1TiKaL,22qwcp,Radler13,12,Fri Apr 11 02:22:26 2014 UTC,"I like not knowing anything about him. I don't want to see his face. Not knowing much about him makes the dry comedy even better. In my opinion, it separates him from the infinite number of ""Let's Players"" seeking fame."
Cr1TiKaL,22qwcp,Weilooq,10,Fri Apr 11 02:46:20 2014 UTC,"I love that he's not just another facecam obsessed self proclaimed ""youtuber"". He's entertaining, he's down to earth, every penny he earns from youtube goes to charity (or the majority at least), and he just seems like an all round great guy with a permanent place in my sub box. Overall I like the anonymity, it just makes his videos funnier in my opinion!"
Cr1TiKaL,22qwcp,newdle2,7,Fri Apr 11 09:44:22 2014 UTC,"Anonymity is one of the features that makes him special. For now, to us, he is a sentient monotonous voice that has no face or being.   This kind of makes him easier to empathize with. Down to earth. He won't strike us as another guy who records his videos in an effort to try to get people to watch him. He's a guy we're playing with, like that friend you have who makes the most hilarious remarks when you're playing with him over at your house.   Sometimes, I want to know how he looks like, but I'm okay with him not showing us his face. He's made the point that he doesn't like talking about his private life and I'll respect him for that."

I was interested then because I really like Pokemon, but I sort of became less interested because I thought I wouldn't get a lot of his other videos, since I don't play a lot of video games. However, my boyfriend kept showing me new videos, and I realized that I didn't need to know a lot about video games to appreciate how hilarious Cr1TiKal is."
Cr1TiKaL,225zy1,ThadChat,3,Fri Apr 4 04:24:01 2014 UTC,My first was Facade. It continues to be one of my favorites. It was one of the funniest things I had seen up until then.

The consistent quality of cr1tikal's videos and his history with reddit shows that this sub could become something better than it is. Though with the nature of this subreddit being quite esoteric and offering little in the form of frequent news, it can only get so large.  I think with the right people and right promotion this place could be more interesting than it currently stands. The only thing that needs to happen is evangelization (and content creation), which isn't that hard since there is a huge gaming community here on reddit (along with artists and  other creative persons).  If I were a more talented mod I would be supporting this sub in whatever way I could. But since I am not, I really can't do anything; just sort of watching my adopted baby suffer from neglect."

I would love to contribute here, but unfortunately I have exactly zero creative bones in my body, and everyone I know that likes him is the same way. Though I have recruited a couple of people I know to subscribe.  It does make sense though, that this place is small. There's not a lot of discussion that can be had about someone who chooses to remain so anonymous. And while it's hilarious, the content of his videos usually doesn't include stuff that people could talk about in length. Aside from the importance of nipples I suppose, or the pain he suffered from the loss of his friend Avagantamose.  However, rest assured that you are not the only one that cares about turning this neglected child into a healthy, loved subreddit. However, I probably have little to no skills that would be helpful in doing that. So we'll just have to see."
