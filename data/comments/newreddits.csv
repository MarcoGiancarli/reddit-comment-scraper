newreddits,3e22sw,Toraden,4,Tue Jul 21 10:39:41 2015 UTC,Why not just got to /r/Blacksmith and /r/metalworking?
newreddits,3e22sw,ecclectic,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:58 2015 UTC,"I saw them when I was searching for similar subs (I was actually looking for subs where people have shown examples of some custom made jewelery) then I found /r/smithing and saw it was unused, I thought it could be used as an amalgamation sub, so you can post/ talk about anything from /r/blacksmith, /r/metalworking, /r/silvercasting as well as a few others in a similar vein and just talk to people with different backgrounds and experiences. I thought it would be a good place for people to talk about something they enjoy but with feedback from people with different disciplines and experiences!"
newreddits,3e22sw,NorseGod,5,Tue Jul 21 13:11:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as someone on /r/blacksmithing I never once thought ""man, there's so much content on here we really need to split it up."""
newreddits,3e22sw,NorseGod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:44 2015 UTC,"Well that's the idea, it isn't to split it up it's to bring together other metal working subs, so you could be talking to people who spend their time silver casting as well as those you normally talk to on /r/blacksmithing. I understand there are going to be overlaps in some areas and none in others, but I thought it would help inspire people or just give them something interesting to talk about that they maybe weren't used to or didn't think about.  You could just as easily ask why was /r/blacksmithing made when /r/blacksmith was around before hand, both are relatively thriving subs even though the other exists."
newreddits,3e22sw,NorseGod,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:00 2015 UTC,"And I wish the two of them would merge. No it's one more sub to follow, or not and miss out."

We didn't come very far, but I recently spiced up the subreddit with Naut, and made a complete idea for the subreddit.   There are subreddits very similiar, as /r/thisdreamihad and /r/dreams.  We want to narrow the subreddit down, so people can post their dream while it's fresh in the memory, as in right after they wake up, where the dream is most clear.  I'll be working on the CSS, general subreddit settings and so on, while going to promote is as good as I can."

newreddits,3cvw07,wheresmyhouse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:23:18 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be too bad. Mainly we just want to prevent people from getting downvoted into oblivion for having a different view than the majority in the thread. We're open to suggestions.
newreddits,3cvw07,Thunderous-Swami,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:15:50 2015 UTC,"My only suggestion is to not just shoot for a large subscriber base, but instead try to keep a small devoted community. Because like it or not, the community owns the subreddit, not you or the mod team. A smaller community will better understand what you're trying to accomplish and will respect your vision. If you don't know it, look up the term ""Eternal September."" Oftentimes a subreddit will get flooded with new users quickly and these new users will post poor content. In response, your original subscribers will get tired of the bad content and unsubscribe. After that, you'll have lost the subreddit that you originally envisioned to the whims of the community.  Sorry, didn't mean to sound like a downer."
