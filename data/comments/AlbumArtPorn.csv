Love it. There's a ton of references on the cover, too - Bradbury Towers, Aces High bar, and more.   It contains one of Iron Maiden's most accessible songs, Wasted Years, so if you haven't heard them (somehow) give that a listen. My favourite track is the closing one, Alexander the Great, one of Maiden's longer songs and a pretty epic finish to the album."

AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,angelfromthecoast,8,Sun Jul 12 04:00:58 2015 UTC,I wonder if she even knows what that word means
AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,abg123rocks,8,Sun Jul 12 09:41:06 2015 UTC,Well it's literally not that.
AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,angelfromthecoast,9,Sun Jul 12 09:44:14 2015 UTC,The gatefold album has extra art that's just as fun/macabre
AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,ElephantKilt,5,Sat Jul 11 22:26:27 2015 UTC,Is it this?
AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,SubHomesickAlien,8,Sat Jul 11 23:56:58 2015 UTC,I have a physical copy of the album.  This is what pops up (like a pop up book) when I open the case.
AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,snidelaughter,7,Sun Jul 12 02:24:53 2015 UTC,That's awesome.
AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,SubHomesickAlien,5,Sun Jul 12 02:29:13 2015 UTC,Here are some pics of the physical one I have.

AlbumArtPorn,3cy5gk,PhatsCadwalader,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:36:19 2015 UTC,What is up with the zodiac killer. I could never figure that one out.
AlbumArtPorn,3d1vpw,Grigglybear,2,Sun Jul 12 21:13:55 2015 UTC,"I love all of the OCS, The OhSees, and Thee Oh Sees covers."
AlbumArtPorn,3cyza5,JessyPengkman,2,Sun Jul 12 01:39:13 2015 UTC,Badass. Can you post a favorite song? And what would you call this art style?
AlbumArtPorn,3cyza5,BrotherThump,2,Sun Jul 12 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8azlP-FgHs theyre incredible, check this one. My favourite is probably 'The River' but its 11 minutes so i thought i would post this as a taster. As for style, it is kinda like Comic book Psychedelia. Reminds me a bit of Pond's 'Man It Feels Like Space Again'"
