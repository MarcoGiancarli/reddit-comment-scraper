In terms of EV training, there's a few training spots in Vesryn for you to use. And then in Aroma, once you reach your secret base, you can catch pokemon with a high EV yields, place them in your daycare, and repeatedly fight them.

pokemonzetaomicron,3dm87w,Streloks,3,Fri Jul 17 12:36:29 2015 UTC,"Try using rain dance. It cancels the harsh sunlight effect that's usually always active in the gym. This becomes very important when Charizard comes out, so he can't do a one turn solar beam on your water pokemon. Also keep in mind that you might need to try a few times to get lucky, and have your rival actually do helpful stuff. If you can get her Charizard confused, paralyzed, or whatever, that is very helpful. AoE attacks are usually worth it, even if they hurt your rival's pokemon as well, just try not to kill his guys in one hit, so they can still soak up an attack.   But TheoHooke is right as well, My guys were around level 65-70 when I managed to finish this gym."

pokemonzetaomicron,3dgfoc,ZeekDaGeek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:57:09 2015 UTC,"just to let you know, this game isn't actually being worked on anymore, so any suggested features are pretty much not going to be implemented into zeta/omicron. it's a bit of a bummer, but not the biggest of deals in the world.  if you wanna see what the devs are up to now, check out /r/pokemoninsurgence"
pokemonzetaomicron,3dgleh,Combat_Medic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:45:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's start with abilities, and then natures. Without those two, I can't say a single set.  Also, why have you been over using kingdra? You need an exp share for sure. I recommend you do some grinding in the secret base"
pokemonzetaomicron,3dgleh,realguy456,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"For one thing, a lot of your Pokemon have crazy mixed sets, like a special move on a physical attacker. Thunderbolt doesn't belong on Absol, and neither does Zombie Strike on Rotom-Mow. Same with Kingdra, why Outrage when everything else is special?  Then, EV train your Pokemon to what stats they will be using, whether it's SpAtk, Ark, or HP, etc.  Also Zebstrika being physical is fine (so Discharge... Maybe you'd want Wild Charge) but Rock Smash absolutely has to go. The move has 20 base power, surely you can find something better than that."
pokemonzetaomicron,3dgleh,Tjmachado,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the info. As it happens to be, I may have abused the lucky egg a little bit with Kingdra, but I'll be sure to switch the moves around. When I first posted this, I felt like a fool as I typed out Rock Smash, but I completely forgot to remove it since i got the pick."
pokemonzetaomicron,3dg9u9,zygrande,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"1: I think everything is based on gen 5 where applicable. Someone else should confirm, because I'm not 100% sure.   3: hm moves are still present, but you can find hm items that serve the purpose of the move outside battle, and a move deleter is found early on. For example, you can find a machete key item that can cut down trees just like hm cut can. It is usually only necessary to have one of your pokemon stuck with an hm for a little while.   4: There are still many glitches and minor annoyances, but nothing game breaking,and the storyline (both regions) is done.   5: Once you unlock the secret base, you can buy an upgrade for your pokegear that lets you evolve pokemon that normally require a trade to do so.   6: Not 100% sure, but I think ask stays are based on gen  5.  Would appreciate if someone can fill in the homes in my knowledge. Sorry for typos, on phone."

pokemonzetaomicron,3dg9u9,1ofthe4rocketbros,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"1) Gen 5, specifically B2/W2  2) I don't use these so I can't really comment on this one.  3) They pretty much act the same as in the original games, the game just also features items that you can use to avoid having to carry around unwanted moves on your Pokemon.  4) Right. Trading does also work when the server isn't down.  5) You can obtain trade evolutions by either trading the old fashioned way or purchasing a Secret Base upgrade that allows you to evolve them from your Pokegear. Magmortar and Kingdra evolve through level up.  6) The only Pokemon that had their stats altered were the Vesryn starters, as seen here: http://pokemonzetaomicron.wikia.com/wiki/Starter_Pok%C3%A9mon#Stat_Modifications  Some Pokemon that received stat changes in Gen 6 won't have them here."

The only things in 2d are fakemon, and the Z/O specific Mega evos/forms. It's usually not too bad, though for some of the 2d ones you can probably find at least a better 2d sprite somewhere.

pokemonzetaomicron,3dakbr,TheFearlessFrog,2,Wed Jul 15 10:39:30 2015 UTC,Dialgs catches almost every time in a quick ball. His catch rate is really high for a legendary. It's 45 I think and many legendary Pokemon are around 3.

pokemonzetaomicron,3d9tlh,Captain_Dickleg,2,Tue Jul 14 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"I agree Yveltal would still be a strong poke due to his raw Uber Legendary stats as well as decent typing. If it was a throwaway Ability that wasn't working, say Inner Focus not stopping flinches or pressure not causing extra PP loss, I wouldn't lose much sleep about it. But a 33.3% decrease in power to his dark moves is a pretty significant loss. Worse than that is the knowledge that he is stuck with a crippled wing that won't be getting fixed ever. Still I'll take your comment as encouragement to keep using him for now, since even flawed he is a valuable addition."
pokemonzetaomicron,3d9tlh,Captain_Dickleg,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"I love your passion for the game. I totally see your point though, it feels like a shame to lose that power."
pokemonzetaomicron,3da6jo,Creeque,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"First, EV train them, it doesn't take very long in the secret base and definitely pays off.   M-Aggron is almost too slow for CC. Because you lose out on the hold item, and he has mediocre special defense, and he has no priority moves, you are basically only able to bring him in on physical attackers and hope they don't have earthquake or fighting moves. This sheet can help you predict that a bit. He will still be helpless against special fire or water attackers as well. If you do want to keep using him, i would ditch brick break for low kick or superpower. I would put all your EV's in HP and Attack.  Greninja is a monster in the CC. EVs in Special Attack and Speed. Change its ability to Protean if you haven't already. Take out acrobatics since it loses power unless you go without a hold item. I would use extrasensory. For a hold item, focus sash is usually advised.  Arcanine need a bit different set up but could still do some damage. I would replace overheat with flare blitz if you want a lot of power, and then this would shift arcanine to a physical attacker. I would replace either dig or aerial ace with extreme speed. This gives priority and hits hard. EVs in attack and speed. Leftovers for the recoil moves.  Alternatives: Delta Aggron/another mega for M Aggron. Dragonite/Speed boost blaziken for Arcanine."
pokemonzetaomicron,3da6jo,GreenishThumbs,2,Tue Jul 14 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"For another mega in place of Aggron, would Garchomp work? If so, what moves? Also, how exactly do you EV train I'm the secret base? thanks for your help!"
pokemonzetaomicron,3da6jo,GreenishThumbs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"To EV train in the base, take a pokemon that gives a high EV yield in the stat you want  to train and deposit it in daycare. Then go into the daycare and battle it. Each time you beat it you raise your EVs in that stat. If you have pokerus and the EV items from blackfist, this will take about 10-15 battles max. Note that other pokemon in your party will also get these EVs with the exp share 2 on.  Garchomp is a decent mega, although nonmega with rough skin and rocky helmet is arguably better because of contact damage. A lot of people use the M-charizards for CC if you have that mega stone. This thread was helpful to me when I was starting out on it as far as picking team members."

pokemonzetaomicron,3d9i3l,RonaldinhoR10,2,Tue Jul 14 15:34:17 2015 UTC,"What version are you? You can catch a gabite on midnight way iirc on zeta. Also, jolteon is a good choice, but i wont pick it. You have exeggutor for water types. I would suggest a gengar. You can teach it tbolt and get rid of flying types. I personally dont like magmortar, so i would change it for example, for blaziken or infernape, but that's my opinion :)"
pokemonzetaomicron,3d9i3l,miguegm98,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:54 2015 UTC,That is actually an option. I was thinking to maybe get rid of gyarados and get myself a vaporeon which is more of a special attacker (+learns aurora beam early on). Because most ground/rock types will have a higher defence than special defence. That will make room for another physical attacker as well. I am also in doubt if i should evolve scyther or not. Think the bug/flying type will come in handy more than the steel type wouldn't it?
pokemonzetaomicron,3d9i3l,welcome2thejam,2,Tue Jul 14 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"You should probably evolve it. Steel's not a good attacking type compared to flying, especially with Z/O's lack of fairies, but Scizor makes up for it by having only one weakness as opposed to Scyther's five. Plus, with Technician, he can relearn Bullet Punch and get a 90 BP move with priority.  Do you have a Thick Club on your Cubone? He still isn't the best ground type pokemon with it, but having one on him definitely makes him a lot more effective. If you still want something else though and change out/evolve your flying types, I think you can find Gliscor in a later route (route 313, apparently). Ground and flying is a nice attacking combo, and he's got real good defense. You can also go back and get a Sandile or Rhyhorn, or you can grab a fighting type who can do ground moves, like Timburr or Scraggy.  Also, a warning that physical attacking water types are slightly more useful in Vesryn than special attacking ones. This is because the you can find Surf's HM item shortly after getting the move itself, but the HM items for Waterfall and Dive are much farther away from the point where you get it. In fact, you'll need both for Victory Road, and Gyarado's is a much better user of it. Not to say you should go Gyarados over Vaporeon just because of that, because both have their pros and cons, but it's something to keep in mind when choosing between the two."
pokemonzetaomicron,3d9i3l,welcome2thejam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help! Yes i am at the route with the gliscor at this point actually! I guess its nice he will have flying moves and is not weak to elektricity!  What about a golem for example? He also seems pretty powerfull. His 4x water weakness put aside.. Was thining about getting a golem and then a honchcrow as my 6th team member, since i have no darkmoves on my team either.."
pokemonzetaomicron,3d9i3l,realguy456,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:03:11 2015 UTC,"Golem's okay. Not the best by far, but on an in-game team, it'll pull his weight nicely. I will have to say say Rhyperior is a much stronger rock/ground type due to better stats and moveset. But if you're feeling a Golem on your team, it'll do fine.  Honchkrow's pretty good. Love the Moxie ability, especially in-game.  Remember that you can put Custom Move on one of your physical attackers to give you some extra coverage too."
pokemonzetaomicron,3d8r0l,meepo6,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:34:57 2015 UTC,"I would pick some grass or electric type, since you dont anything stab to kill water types. You can teach gengar tbolt and pick for example, ferrothorn"

pokemonzetaomicron,3cw7vy,Lightened,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:39:12 2015 UTC,Awesome. So does that mean you get to Stage 2 by buying the upgrades to get to this stage or is there some minigame sorta like the secret base flags that allow you to do this?

pokemonzetaomicron,3cpd80,Boodahz,2,Thu Jul 9 21:56:22 2015 UTC,"if you're looking for pokemon for your team, there are a few that are considered team staples, and more that are good to try out  Conkeldurr (fighting) - funny looking dude from gen 5, has super good attack and can take a hit too. evolves from Timburr and gurdurr, which can be found on route 307 if you have headbutt  Ferrothorn (grass/steel) - another from gen 5, it has a really unique typing and superb defensive stats, which make it hard to counter. Can be found at route 317, and evolves from ferroseed, which can be found at naragex forest with headbutt.  Blaziken (fire/fighting) - gen 3 fire starter. if you have the 'speed boost' ability then this guy is broken. evolves from torchic and combusken. you get to choose a gen 3 starter later in the game.  Aegislash (ghost/steel) - gen 6. this guy has the ability to change between having crazy high attack stats and having crazy high defense stats depending on the move you use. evolves from honedge and doublade, which you will encounter but won't be able to catch till later.  Metagross (psychic/steel) - gen 3. a pseudo-legendary much like dragonite and tyranitar, this guy has reaaly good physical attack and defense in exchange for low speed. evolves from beldum and metang, which can be found at mount press, specifically the exterior level 2.  Hydreigon (dark/dragon) gen 5. another pseudo legendary, it has heads for hands and has no real flaws other than a relatively low speed. evolves from deino and zweilous, which the latter can be found in victory road.  Garchomp (dragon/ground) - pseudo legendary pokemon from gen 4, has great typing and overall excellent stats. Can mega evolve, and evolves from gible and gabite, which can be found in midnight way, and at the 2nd safari zone.  Rotom (electric/whatever) - this guy technically isn't legendary, but he was introduced as on in diamond and pearl. normally an electric/ghost type, he has the ability to change form to become electric / fire, ice, water, grass, or flying type. you should get an opportunity to catch a rotom in onega town, but if you messed that up you can find another later in constance city. you can change rotom's form by interacting with the TV where you caught rotom while it's in the party. water type rotom is generally considered to be the strongest.  if you ever watch pokemon tournaments, chances are that you'll see these guys at some point or another. if you wanna check more pokemon out, smogon is a good tool. although it's based around competitive pokemon, they are generally good at saying if a pokemon is great or not."
pokemonzetaomicron,3cpd80,I_Am_A_Pumpkin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:02:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! I will look out for these."
pokemonzetaomicron,3cpd80,welcome2thejam,2,Thu Jul 9 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd definitely understand before playing if you haven't learned about it already is the physical/special attack split, which came in gen 4. Basically, in gens 1-3, whether a move used your attack stat or special attack stat was determined by its type. So for example, all rock and ground moves were physical and used the attack stat, while all water and fire attacks were special and used the special attack stat. Nowadays, every attacking move is designated either physical or special on its own, regardless of type. So Flamethrower is a special attack, as it used to be, but Fire Punch is now a physical attack. Thus, a pokemon with a higher attack would much prefer Fire Punch over Flamethrower, and vice versa for a special attacker.  It's definitely something to take into consideration when making your pokemon's movesets, as I've seen a lot of people post their teams on this subreddit asking for help, and so many times their movesets don't take the split into account, and they're stuck wondering why their team isn't doing good damage.  Oh, and also, the physical/special split matter for the defensive stats too. Physical attacks will target the defense stat, while special attacks target special defense.  There's also a new type, Fairy, but since Z/O doesn't retype old pokemon and has very few sixth gen pokemon, you won't see it that much.  In terms of useful post-gen 2 pokemon, I'd agree with just using the ones you think look good and fit well with your team. That said, a few early game pickups that could help and haven't been mentioned:  Absol, a third gen dark type available via trades with NPCs in Kariba and Kivu Town. A quite good physical attacker who excels in the first half of the game, with an advantage over two of the gyms. Though it does fall off in usefulness once you get farther in the game, Absol can still hold its own even up to the last battle should you choose to keep it.  Starly, a gen 4 normal/flying type found in the very first route in the game. Of all the first route birds - i.e. Pidgey, Taillow, etc. - this is generally considered the best one. With a great attack stat, two good abilities, and a useful movepool, it can take down a ton of opponents. Personally used this guy on my team during my Zeta run, and I still fondly remember it one shotting one of the toughest pokemon in this game.  Riolu, a fourth gen fighting type that evolves into the fighting/steel type Lucario. A pretty popular pokemon (I mean, it's in Super Smash Bros) that's bad in defenses, but fantastic in both attack stats and takes advantage of it with a very diverse movepool. Basically, it's popular for a reason. Found in the bottom of Wonder Cave and evolves via happiness.  Axew, a fifth gen dragon type found in the Midnight Way who eventually evolves into Haxorus. It's basically a poor man's (but IMO slightly cooler) Garchomp, but still a very capable member of any team. The main thing is the Midnight Way will only have one of those two dragon types depending on your game: Zeta gets Garchomp, while Omicron gets Axew.  Sandile, a gen five ground/dark type. You can get this guy in route 308.5, and aside from being one of the coolest pokemon, he's also pretty darn powerful. It's got two of the better abilities in the game - Intimidate, which lowers your opponent's attack upon entry, and Moxie, which boosts your attack every time you get a KO - and an attack stat that lets it hammer foes into submission.  Solosis, a five gen psychic type catchable in the aptly-named Psychic Temple. It eventually evolves into Reuniclus, a pokemon with high HP and special attack but very low speed. It's main draw, however, is its ability: Magic Guard, which prevents any indirect damage. This means it won't suffer things such as from HP loss from statuses such as burns or poison during battle, or sandstorm damage. Plus, later on, you can buy a Life Orb, an item which increases a move's damage but damages the user. However, if your Reuniclus has Magic Guard, it prevents the user damage of the Life Orb while retaining its power boost.  Hawlucha, who you can get via the Mystery Gift. It's one of the only gen six pokemon you'll see in Z/O. Being the only fighting/flying type in the game gives it five weaknesses, but also lets it do extra damage with two of the best attacking types in the game. It's especially useful, however, because it holds an amulet coin, which increases your winnings per battle. That's a godsend in the early game, where you're aching for money, and you won't get access to that item otherwise until the seventh gym."

Both fully evolved psychic types, and can learn a grass or electric type move (thunderbolt/grass knot for Gardevoir and Galle can relearn Leaf Blade). Helps since Gyarados and Dragonite aren't great Thunderbolt users and water types with an ice type move can take out half your team.  Gallade's good for you since fighting type moves are insanely useful for any team and can make for a great set up sweeper, but Gardevoir can get Moonblast and a late mega stone, and being a special attacker helps your team diversity."

Thank for the help btw!"
pokemonzetaomicron,3cjx07,welcome2thejam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"Gardevoir's more powerful, IMO. Slightly better stats and moveset, plus the mega stone. Doesn't mean you have to use it over Beheeyem though, who can still be useable in-game.  I'd say Brick Break on Dragonite since your team really needs a fighting type attack. Earthquake or Dragon Dance is nice on Gyarados, though you'll need Dive temporarily to get through some areas before you get the HM item.  Btw, I'd also put Earthquake on Haxorus over one of the dragon type moves, and probably Custom Move grass or ice over Tackle on your Luxray (and probably Thunder Wave later on over Discharge.)"

There are edited roms, so I added that last classification. Both stories of the regions in the game were amazing and have some references  to previous pokemon games.   There is a decent amount of events to do too. One particular event I did which I won't mention publicly had me grinding for hours and scratching my head at clues of what to do next.

pokemonzetaomicron,3calkm,AlejQueTriste,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:12:43 2015 UTC,Rocket boots give you fly without needing to have the skill learned. Other than that I don't think there's a different one. Nor do I see the necessity for a second fast travel system :p
pokemonzetaomicron,3calkm,Criously,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:29:18 2015 UTC,Alright since your here do you know what Wandering pokemon mean? like in the blackfist city safari its larvitar and gible does this mean I just see a Gible/larvitar model walking around or is it just a rare chance to obtain one there?
pokemonzetaomicron,3calkm,The_Pathogen,2,Mon Jul 6 13:05:03 2015 UTC,"A rare chance. You could also get a shiny Gible at the Blackfist Department Store, but there's really not much a difference between a shiny and normal if you have a bunch of IV Stones (you can get 1 or 2 of those from Wonder Cave (I think?), some from the Secret Base's Pokeball and after the final base upgrade)"
pokemonzetaomicron,3calkm,Favna,0,Mon Jul 6 13:33:30 2015 UTC,Perk of the market one is the shiny and the fact that if you have some time you can softreset for its nature (by saving before buying)

pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,AppellateNate,3,Sun Jul 5 12:27:17 2015 UTC,truth
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,nemarholvan,2,Sun Jul 5 12:28:54 2015 UTC,"Truth, but the reason is because the devs are working on a new game, Pokemon Insurgence, which already has online battling working."
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,AppellateNate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:33:25 2015 UTC,Too bad
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,Glitchy88,2,Mon Jul 6 00:46:20 2015 UTC,"can confirm, am an Insurgence dev. insurgence is much better than zo. its also rather likely that zo wont get updated anymore"
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,AppellateNate,4,Mon Jul 6 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"No offense but that's pretty stupid, if you start something you should finish it.  If omicron and zeta are just going to be never updated anymore I'd like it if thesuzerain would actually let people know and not leave us in the dark."
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,thesuzerain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:48:53 2015 UTC,zo is finished. the game was completed quite a while ago.
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,HeyShorty,2,Mon Jul 6 04:24:04 2015 UTC,But no online battling
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,Glitchy88,4,Mon Jul 6 05:47:27 2015 UTC,you say that like its some easy throwaway feature that we didnt include because we're lazy.  Battling in insurgence took weeks of effort and a dedicated server and its still barely functional.
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,thesuzerain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:10:18 2015 UTC,What about trading? Is it possible to trade in either game? And how exactly should one go about that?
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,Glitchy88,2,Tue Jul 7 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"But there are still things that need to be fixed, messed up sprites, some moves/abilities don't work right, if you guys have gotten so much better at doing thing with insurgence then why can't you apply some of that to omicron and zeta?"
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6gt5,AppellateNate,3,Mon Jul 6 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"Because ZO's time is done. If we updated ZO now, most people who played through it have already played through the game and any update is useless to them (because they're not going to play through it again). Sure, the update will improve the experience of the players who are playing/yet to play, but our time is better spent improving and finishing Insurgence (As you said, if you start something you should finish it) which people are interested in and still following.  Zeta/Omicron IS finished, aside from some minor bugs or problems. If a game is considered unfinished because it has those, then I'd be surprised if any significant amount of games are actually finished.  There may be an update for Zeta/Omicron. I originally planned to port back all the new megas from insurgence into the game, but its not a priority for me, at all. I'd rather work on the unfinished game than the finished one."

pokemonzetaomicron,3c5qoo,nemarholvan,2,Sun Jul 5 02:02:49 2015 UTC,could you be a little more specific its hard to see in this town
pokemonzetaomicron,3c5qoo,Tjmachado,2,Sun Jul 5 02:04:08 2015 UTC,"After you beat the gym (which is just Rock I believe), the top right corner leads to the Secret Base, the bottom left is an entrance to the next cave route.  Also, did you grab the GoGoggles on the route just before Agassiz? And regarding Secret Power I never got it to work, but once you buy all the Base Upgrades you can talk to the purple crystal and you'll get Level 2. In there is a Skeleton Key and that works if you talk to the pillars in the locations that you bought an entrance to from the top"
pokemonzetaomicron,3c5qoo,Tjmachado,2,Sun Jul 5 02:16:12 2015 UTC,Alright i found the base i cant seem to find the cave and what do I do with the gogoggles?
pokemonzetaomicron,3c5qoo,nemarholvan,2,Sun Jul 5 02:44:42 2015 UTC,"GoGoggles, you use like a Bicycle (can register to Q/W/E), and it removes the annoying sandstorm messing with the screen.  The cave... It should just be somewhere near the bottom of the left side, it's not hidden at all."

pokemonzetaomicron,3c6n79,ApolloStarIV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:54:44 2015 UTC,"It just means to organize the post so its easier to understand and read, so like:  Kabutops: Giga Drain (Grass); Earth Power (Rock); Blizzard (Ice); Surf (Water)  Scizor: X-Scissor (Bug); Fury Cutter (Bug); Flash Cannon (Steel); Wing Attact (Flying)  Charizard: Fly (Flying); Focus Punch (Fighting); Flare Blitz (Fire); Outrage (Dragon)  It just makes it more organized."

pokemonzetaomicron,3c6n79,Damonblood7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:12:42 2015 UTC,"It's not the team I would have picked, but there's nothing horribly wrong with it. Exeggutor is my favourite pokemon of all time, so I'll give you my favourite move set for him - Sunny Day, Solarbeam, Shadowball, Sleep Powder. Exeggutors hidden ability, chlorophyll,  doubles his speed in sunlight. He goes from a slow, but tanky special attacker to one of the fastest special attackers with a one turn solarbeam."
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6n79,Damonblood7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:35:06 2015 UTC,"Nice! I would like my Exeggutor to have a kick ass psychic move, so sleep powder, dream eater, sunny day and solarbeam? My Metagross has a shadow ball for psychic pokemon."
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6n79,Damonblood7,2,Tue Jul 7 04:38:03 2015 UTC,Special Kabutops seems an odd choice
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6n79,bobthedoozy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:10:45 2015 UTC,"It has classic rock and water which is why I wanted it, other than it looks kick ass, but the giga drain and blizzard give it a nice edge, keep it going and can take out grass pokemon with its nice-ice moves."
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6n79,nemarholvan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:59:01 2015 UTC,"I agree it's a very cool pokemon, though it should definitely be using a more Physical moveset, as its Sp.Atk is very bad.  My suggestion would be to either use a mixed set such as above, or use a mostly Physical set with Swords Dance, Stone Edge, Waterfall, and Superpower for coverage, or Aqua Jet for priority. Coming off his very low Sp.Atk, i doubt that Ice moves would be significantly better than Superpower against Grass types"
pokemonzetaomicron,3c6n79,Wulibo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:47:59 2015 UTC,how bout instead X-Scissor bug type? takes out the grass.

pokemonzetaomicron,3c5g6l,The_Pathogen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"Probably a bug, but you could fix that by going to the Graphics folder and downloading your own animation for King's Shield."
pokemonzetaomicron,3c5g6l,Sleepymon12,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"Does each move use it's own animation in the folder, or are there just a few that are distributed amongst all of the moves? If I can edit each one by itself then I'd go and fix Psystrike... Oh god I'll be here all day changing things.  Granted, the true bug is that I'm unsure if King's Shield actually reduces Attack on contact, that's more important for gameplay."
pokemonzetaomicron,3c4rwv,Ryscor,2,Sat Jul 4 19:53:15 2015 UTC,"For the first question, I believe it's because they didn't have follower sprites at the time, and the devs didn't want people constantly submitting that as a bug.  Most movesets are gen 5 (specifically B2W2 i think, not too sure). Some pokemon have altered movesets/their gen 6 ones for different reasons (mostly for mega evolution)"

I would recommend Lucario, you can make it a special or physical attacker, works with both. Lucario would also give you some a steel stab move. Good against Fairy types if Venasaur is down. Heracross might be a valid choice as well. Give you some bug type moves."

pokemonzetaomicron,3bhb8e,Tjmachado,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"Before you enter the battle, remember to save!  False Swipe (either on a Pokemon or as an Attack Box) to get the HP to exactly 1.  Paralyze increases the catch chance a bit, Sleep or Freeze are much harder to get but increase the chance by more.  After it gets really low, start throwing Ultra Balls (consistent), Dusk Balls (Night/Cave, better), or maybe a Heavy Ball (Groudon and a few other extreme heavies) until it works. Reset if you run out, and just try again. It still is ultimately a catch CHANCE you're working with."
pokemonzetaomicron,3bhb8e,aleks7234,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"Changing your PC clock and throwing Dusk Balls always worked well for me. Heavy Balls are usually good too. Also don't forget that as long as you are higher levelled than (x), Level Balls are always equal to or better than Ultra Balls, for much less price.   False Swipe/Status first of course (I usually go for Paralysis since it's reliable and there's a Thunder Wave AB, though Sleep increases the chance of catching a bit)"
pokemonzetaomicron,3bezo5,Fubberts,7,Sun Jun 28 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"After reading up on IV's DV's and EV's   I've never heard of DVs, except for when IVs are called DVs in german.  Anyway though, IVs are added in the calculation of stats, though it is just one factor of many, and it is relatively small at that.  The level is a really big factor in this as well, so you're correct in realizing that it is not an immediate raise but will show with level.  As for Missigno, it has a base defense stat of 0 which is... well you literally can't go any lower.  Even with a def+ nature, max IVs, max EVs and at level 120 it will always be severely capped. If I'm not mistaken the maximum defense Missigno can ever achieve under these circumstances is 130.  Further it's special defense also only has a basestat of 6. So that's not much better.  Further further... Missigno only has an HP basestat of 33.  So no matter how hard you want to try and from what angle you look... Missigno is just incredibly fragile.  And seeing how it got a pretty powerful ability in return it is intentional, it is meant as a ""throwaway"" Pokemon, something you switch in on to insta-kill an enemy Pokemon.  Though there is even a catch to that as its ability only triggers if the enemy makes a contact move, meaning it is useless against special attackers or enemies who use non-contact physical moves.  Missingno is really ""just"" a gimmick Pokemon, sure you can make it work, but you could also have something much more reliable.  But... if you really really want to use it to kill off 1-2 enemy Pokemon the absolute best thing you can do is to equip it with a focus sash. Any serious attack on Missingno will likely knock it out, but with the sash it is guranteed to at least survive one attack with 1 HP, meaning if it knocked out its attacker it can potentially knock out another one as well.   wondertomb   Dunno really what this is, but after searching it online I assume you mean a Spiritomb with the Wonder Guard ability. As far as I know there is no way to do this. Also Spiritomb can still be hit by fairy-type moves, though it would still be immune to direct attacks from all other types."

pokemonzetaomicron,3bezo5,Tjmachado,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:03:39 2015 UTC,"My set that I'm using on Missingno. basically forgoes any chance at Defense and just uses a Focus Sash to keep it alive for a few seconds longer. Also, if you have a Trick Room pokemon on your team (eventually I'll have Speed Swap with Mega Reuniclus) then he's effectively the fastest thing possible.  Missingno. @ Focus Sash 252 HP/252 Atk/4 Def  -TMTRAINER (Custom Move-Ice)  -Earthquake  -Fly  -Swords Dance  And that's the best you'll get, a fragile offensive threat that can maybe take an enemy physical attacker down with it."

My Aggron is Jolly because I use a Rock Polish set, which hits a very high speed stat and hits incredibly hard with Heavy Slam and Ice Shard.  Snorlax could take a more defensive approach and use Impish to raise its Defense, if you need a good tank.  Delta Houndoom would like Timid best, and Delta Zangoose/Pinsir appreciate Jolly most. Both of them need max Speed to function best, from my experience. Lastly, Delta Milotic would probably be best with Calm or Impish natures to be used as a good defense Fire type. Or modest. I don't like Delta Milotic because Heatran is so much better.  I would recommend something for Delta Chimecho, but I don't think he's good at all."

pokemonzetaomicron,3aoec9,The_Pathogen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:31:47 2015 UTC,"A water type would be good, Vaporeon since it's bulky. Garchomp would be an awesome pokemon for your team. Maybe a dark or ghost type as well, Gengar or Dusknoir might be good."
pokemonzetaomicron,3aoec9,Damonblood7,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:48:51 2015 UTC,"For bulk, he could use a Dusclops with Evolite. Or a Shuckle"
pokemonzetaomicron,3aoec9,skilletamy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:05:57 2015 UTC,"So many good water types to consider, Vaporeon for bulk or passing acid armor/aqua ring, Gyarados if you dont mind the 4x weakness, Feraligator is real tough and has a nice movepool(waterfall,ice fang, crunch, dragon claw, or DDance if you want), Mega Swampert is great(who can say no to STAB Earthquake?), especially with Sap Sipper, but even his regular ability is awesome if you can lay down some rain(doubled speed plus ice punch means you dont have to worry about most grass types). I dont know what Kingdras stats got changed to but hes also a great option with only one weakness and a good movepool if you go special.  Or if you wanna get real wild do a Leftovers Rain dish Ludicolo with Leach Seed, Toxic, Rain Dance and double team. Shits cash.  As for non water types Garchomp is always a great option, or perhaps Haxorus which is even easier to get and hits even harder.  6th spot could be a flying type. Everyone loses their shit over Staraptor, but as long as Honchkrow is available to me I'll never turn it down. Hits even harder, a bit bulkier and has a much much much better Special Attack(105 compared to an unusable 50) giving you the option to run Dark Pulse in case you run into a Physical wall that your other moves bounce off of. People always praise Honch for being one of the few who gets Sucker punch, but why would you want that when I'm pretty sure a Super Luck Honchkrow with Night Slash and that item that increases Crit Chance, has a 50% chance to crit each hit. 50%! Breed Drill peck on it if you want. Perhaps roost or toxic for its 4th move. Or Fly if you need the HM"
pokemonzetaomicron,3aoxzf,rkm143jpat,2,Mon Jun 22 08:54:21 2015 UTC,Just pick solo run and randomized as your challenge runs.

pokemonzetaomicron,3an6yi,Tjmachado,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:06:48 2015 UTC,"A lot of their IVs are pretty bad, maybe find some IV Stones and put it on their most important Attacking stat (like come on, poor 'Scavalier has a 3 Atk IV. At level 120 that's like 30 Atk off of when it's a 31)  Also I have no idea what Basculin is doing with his moveset, but apparently he was for HMs  Also worth nothing that I've never seen Thunderbird in my life and that's a possible candidate for picking a Pokemon for my possible LP of Zeta (currently casually playing Omicron)  Pretty good type coverage and physical/special split, not much else to say."
pokemonzetaomicron,3an6yi,mikesok988,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:36:13 2015 UTC,Thunderbird is the custom move. And can you explain EVs and IVs a bit more?
pokemonzetaomicron,3an6yi,welcome2thejam,3,Sun Jun 21 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"EV's ""effort values""  Each pkmn has a distinct value to itself that gives a unique type of experience per battle. This 'experience' (a number ranging from 1-3) is determined based on the type of pkmn you are battling. For example, Your active pkmn will earn 1 attack EV per victory over a machop (2 for a machoke, 3 for machamp) and that will very slowly affect your lead pkmn's attack stat. The more EV's a stat has, the higher it will be. You can get up to 252 EV's per stat.   IV's ""inherited/initial"" (??) values  These are what the pkmn is born with and range from 0-31. They affect each stat the same way EV's do, but they can't be changed. That's why people always ask for 5-6  31 IV pkmns, because they would result in having the highest possible stat pool across the board of their unique pkmn species.   For example, a spearow caught in the wild has 30 HP IVs, but only 3 speed IV's. This spearow, when leveled up, would be slower than most other spearows, but have a little larger health pool than a large majority.  Hope this helps!"
pokemonzetaomicron,3an6yi,Tjmachado,2,Mon Jun 22 00:47:03 2015 UTC,"You can actually get up to 255 EVs per stat in this game (it changed to 252 for sixth gen, but Zeta/Omicron is a fifth gen game). But 252 is the highest you should go, because every four EVs basically adds up to +1 in the stat. Thus, 252 is as high as you can go without wasting some.  Additionally, OP, you're limited to only 510 EVs overall."
pokemonzetaomicron,3ann3b,Tjmachado,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:06:42 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Magmortar have a better special attack overall? Unless he's got a bad nature for it, he might be better off as a mixed attacker with Thunderbolt as its electric move, Flamethrower, and probably Rock Slide since you don't have any rock-type moves. If your nature makes him better physical, you could go custom move electric, though I'm not sure why you wouldn't have access to Thunder Punch, isn't that gotten from the move relearner?  Have you gotten all the HM items? Because then you wouldn't need to keep Waterfall on Vaporeon (same for Tesseract on Mewtwo). I suppose Ice Beam would be best over Waterfall?  If Reuniclus has Magic Guard, drop a Life Orb on that guy pronto, and if he doesn't have it (and you haven't switched to its hidden ability), switch to it. It gives a 30% boost to its attacks while Magic Guard negates its health drop.  For running a Calm Mind set, Leftovers should be good for Lucario, even if it's not a really bulky pokemon. Calm Mind might be better as a Trick Room replacement for Reuniclus, who has the bulk to stay alive longer. Then you could go with Choice Specs, Life Orb, or an Expert Belt on Lucario.  Maybe Thunder Wave over Sky Attack? It makes setting up Swords Dance a lot easier. Or if you're not using it already, give it a custom move for type coverage."
pokemonzetaomicron,3ann3b,welcome2thejam,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:48:38 2015 UTC,"God damnit that's RIGHT ThunderPunch isn't just a Move Tutor move, Magmortar gets it at level 1!  Also didn't think about Magic Guard (which it does have) negating LO damage, thanks for that.  Lucario is going towards Specially bulky with CM over Nasty Plot and it'll have EVs in SpDef so Leftovers will actually help a lot.  Custom move sounds like a good idea for Missingno. as it really does need the type coverage and now I don't need it for Magmortar. Probably will replace Sky Attack as its charge turn still leave him vulnerable and there's like one situation with a perfect switch-in and Focus Sash that I can even live to get it off.  And didn't think about the Time Caller, forgot that now I can get it. Need to find the Jetpack somewhere on Mt Press too... That I can get on though.  Also Magmortar is Relaxed (+Def -Spd) so... well, it fit with Speed Swap, but my team really needs a physical attacker besides Missingno. and I really don't want it to be Lucario. EV Training will help I hope"
pokemonzetaomicron,3ann3b,bye_proxy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with welcome2thejam, but id keep mr.glitch's sky attack and probably ditch swords dance for a custom move (really all you have to do is switch in safely after reuniclus starts Trick Room, and you're set.  Also, idk if you realize this, but you won't be able to bring your Vesyrn pokemon over until after the story in Aroma is done  (I guess you can have someone trade your own pokemon back to aroma for you, but that kinda takes the fun away from things)"

pokemonzetaomicron,3akh3g,Phizy,6,Sun Jun 21 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would work. As it is there isn't officially a Linux version, and even if there was the Raspberry Pi has an ARM processor, meaning the program would have to be compiled specifically for ARM processors, and it looks like it's only available in x86.  The point about emulators running on the RPi doesn't matter, because this isn't a ROM hack, it's a standalone program. You could run Pokémon Emerald or Pokémon Quartz on an RPi, because even though the second one is fan made they're both ROMs, and there are GBA emulators for ARM processors that can interpret GBA ROMs. However, you couldn't run something like TF2 on an RPi, because there is no x86 emulator available.  TL;DR nope, probably never going to happen."

pokemonzetaomicron,3ah6s4,johnkannon2,4,Sat Jun 20 03:40:32 2015 UTC,this post reminds me of those reviews made by 6 year olds on app store games asking for new features

But i asked for some fixed in tutor moves and skill too, isnt it a bit uncomfortable when lot of good/usual skill dont have it scene and only have the same attack like other ( a same yellow spot hitting in your enemies bodies) ..."
pokemonzetaomicron,3ah6s4,bye_proxy,2,Sat Jun 20 04:19:51 2015 UTC,"Zeta/Omicron is pretty much done for the moment i think. The creator is working on a different game, and will probably come back to Z/O after thats done"

pokemonzetaomicron,3abav5,Foxknight,5,Thu Jun 18 21:57:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I got ... right after. Is there anything else to do after that? Aside from catching them all? I caught every single legendary now.
pokemonzetaomicron,3abav5,Foxknight,2,Thu Jun 18 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"nope, you have done everything z/o has to offer, now you can play pokemon insurgence ( if you havent yet). or play the other version of the game."
pokemonzetaomicron,3abav5,Foxknight,2,Thu Jun 18 22:17:33 2015 UTC,I think I'll complete the National Dex then play Omicron. I've already beaten Insurgence.

Hopefully someone that can solve your question comes along"
pokemonzetaomicron,39zthe,Creeque,9,Tue Jun 16 03:00:00 2015 UTC,Try giving it a soothe bell or something and walk around with it a lot. Make sure it doesn't faint either. Surprising it's gotten to such a high level without evolving.
pokemonzetaomicron,39zthe,Damonblood7,3,Tue Jun 16 03:18:56 2015 UTC,"Mine evolved at around 30 but it did die quite a few times so there's that. If he says that he loves nothing more than traveling with you you've reached the final stage of affection, after a short while he should evolve."
pokemonzetaomicron,39zthe,FitnesslovesAlcohol,3,Tue Jun 16 08:53:38 2015 UTC,"You could give it a soothe bell which enables happiness to increase faster. Walk around with it a lot, or win battles. IIRC loosing battles and using healing bitter items actually decrease happiness (not 100% sure about it)  You can also feed it EV reducing berries(which increase happiness while reducing evs) from blackfist dept store and then level up.  Levels of happiness can be determined by interacting with the pokemon when it's the 1st in your party  Less than 50 is ""hates travelling""  50-100 is ""undecided""  100-150 is ""is happy traveling""  150-200 is ""loves travelling""  200+ is ""loves nothing more than travelling""  Afaik, most pokemon that evolve through high friendship/happiness require 200+ to evolve."
pokemonzetaomicron,39zthe,Sleepymon12,2,Tue Jun 16 14:51:17 2015 UTC,Yea I evolved mine at the level I found him You literally just need to walk and get him to the max happiness and then level up in daytime

pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,FlatChestFTW,6,Sun Jun 14 13:03:54 2015 UTC,"Noivern failed me, I got Radio from the person as well. Just didn't learn any good moves for me and fell off really hard."
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,Damonblood7,4,Sun Jun 14 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"Once it evolves it gets pretty good though. Boomburst and Dragon Pulse can be ""remembered"" at any level and have enough power to make Noivern a good option. You can throw on Shadow Ball and Focus Blast for great coverage too."
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,Pegthaniel,2,Sun Jun 14 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was hoping it could learn some moves like that but it never did I think I had wing attack on it or something like that. I've used it before and had success but this time it just held me back."
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,Damonblood7,5,Sun Jun 14 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"For sure, Aroma starts really strong and you can't really have a weak link sucking up experience if you want to move forward without too much grinding. I was just really willing to grind it out so I could play with an ""ideal"" team."
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,Pegthaniel,3,Sun Jun 14 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm just a few towns into Aroma. Here's my suggestions.  It may be in your interest to cut down on Pokemon. Quality over quantity. It's harder to keep up in levels with a full team this early. I'm only using two Pokemon and so far I'm barely keeping up in levels.  Depending on how you spent your money, early game should actually be a piece of cake. You retain all of your TMs, HMs and items. Everything you've found and bought (Mostly from the wondrous department store of Blackfist) is still in your inventory. Make use of them. After my Mudkip evolved into Marshtomp, it had Waterfall, Earthquake, Brick Break and Rock Slide.   Your team itself does not look that bad, honestly. It's more likely you're underleveled."
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,WaruAthena,4,Sun Jun 14 14:04:20 2015 UTC,I find eviolite to be very helpful at this stage as well
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,beastiezzo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:16:20 2015 UTC,I agree on being under leveled I may put a few pokemon on the back burner for a bit.
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,WaruAthena,2,Sun Jun 14 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that passage between Veseryn and Aroma is free. If you missed anything or want to buy something back in Veseryn, you're always free to go back and forth."
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,tomackze,0,Sun Jun 14 14:19:47 2015 UTC,"Also I seriously suggest you put two Pokemon in the daycare so you can carry them over when you upgrade your base. Very helpful.  If you don't want to put main team from veseryn, choose Pokemon that were a bit weaker that you didn't get to use. I did that with my gardevoir"
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,newyorker9789,4,Thu Jun 25 18:13:54 2015 UTC,Radio and Louise will be a lot more help once evolved
pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,Theofratus,2,Sun Jun 14 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"Lol, I never name my pokemons but you seem to take pleasure in that, well done OP. Also, to answer your question, I usually do a basis of one Main Tank pokemon which ususally is the strongest in my team and only use it after my 2 less stronger pokemon that I train to become stronger die and take on any oppressors."

pokemonzetaomicron,39sv98,tomackze,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"In the next region you get new pokemon, you can always go back to the other region. Once you complete both regions everything is avaliable."

pokemonzetaomicron,39r2aa,Vetersova,2,Sun Jun 14 00:23:31 2015 UTC,"I usually put together a team filled with pokemon I haven't used in other games I've played. I make sure I have good type coverage then use unique pokemon. My team for this game is Magnezone, Rhydon, Seaking, Honchcrow, Wobbuffet and Magmortar. Wobbuffet is my favorite pokemon to play with, I can't believe I've never played with him before."

pokemonzetaomicron,39ofgg,urtlesquirt,7,Sat Jun 13 05:56:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I had an almost identical team and you have a lot of type coverage with it.
pokemonzetaomicron,39ofgg,Damonblood7,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:00:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I just realized that Rotom Wash can't learn surf, so I switched him out for a Marshtomp I got from my secret base. However, I will keep him leveled, as he could be very useful once I find the surf hm item due to the insane EVs I got on him and his awesome move pool."
pokemonzetaomicron,39ofgg,jazaniac,2,Sat Jun 13 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"Rotom-w also has one of the best typings, stats and movepools in the game."

While Swampert may not have the movepool of Rotom-W, it uses the water HM's extremely well, due to both high special and physical attack. Plus Swapert has tons of bulk. They are both great choices"
pokemonzetaomicron,39ofgg,spartan_626,3,Sat Jun 13 23:58:11 2015 UTC,Should be fine. Love the Hunter x Hunter names.
pokemonzetaomicron,39ofgg,spartan_626,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think most of them are very fitting too. Rest assured, if I ever get an electric type, it'll be named Killua. I also changed Cinder and Altia to Mustang and Olivier, to go along with Havoc."

pokemonzetaomicron,39ph20,dagabesta,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:06:05 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents.  I have always found weather skills to be less than useful (Except for exactly one situation later in the game) especially when it clashes with another teammate. Rain Dance to be precise, as it screws over Magmortar's fire moves. Magmortar has some very wide coverage by the way, so consider throwing Thunderbolt his way over Fire Punch and making him a special attacker.  If you're replacing both Hawlucha and Staraptor, you might consider Honchkrow, my personal favorite flying type. Sucker Punch is priority, he can learn Superpower, Brave Bird can be bred onto him and he has a usable Sp.Attack if you want to go that route. He also has a useful hidden ability in Moxie which counters Superpower's Attack drops or lets him sweep.  Other flying types to consider are Crobat, Gyarados and Aerodactyl.  Assuming you get rid of Hawlucha, Staraptor and Marowak, you will lack super effective moves against Normal, Flying, Electric, Water and Fairy types. Fairy types aren't seen that often but your other Pokemon might want to have some form of coverage against those types."
pokemonzetaomicron,39ph20,WaruAthena,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"The only reason I have Goodra with Rain Dance is because it has Hydration, so its status problems will be cured if it is raining. I like the idea of adding Honchkrow to the team, I think that's better than adding Braviary like I was considering."
pokemonzetaomicron,39ph20,WaruAthena,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Might as well make it worth it and put a Thunder user on your team. Or a water type, or something with Swift Swim. Since it's there, might as well make the most out of it.   You still have three extra Pokemon to choose, and you're not really lacking that much. Personally I like to use my favorites. You might as well do the same since you shouldn't have too much trouble."
pokemonzetaomicron,39ph20,WaruAthena,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"Came back here to tell how my team was going. I was having trouble with the 7th gym so I completely changed my team for the battle. It was:   Magmortar Jirachi Darkrai Duskinoir Honchkrow Chandelure   After that gym was over with, I changed my team back but kept a few of the new mons. My team for the 8th gym is now:   Goodra Magmortar Honchkrow (replaced Staraptor) Duskinoir (replaced Hawlucha) Marowak Jirachi   I may replace Marowak with Kabutops if I decide to train one, and may replace Duskinoir yet again. I also bought a Dream Stone for Honchkrow to change its ability to Moxie, and training it has been a breeze. I OHKO every one of Jonathan's Pokemon with Honchkrow's Fly in my secret base to train. Rain Dance actually worked out on my Goodra. Rain Dance + Mystic Water + Muddy Water OHKO's the 8th gym leader's Houndoom and Camerupt and takes out Emboar and Chandelure in two hits. If I did end up adding Kabutops to the team then it would gain the bonus from Swift Swim."
pokemonzetaomicron,39ph20,miguegm98,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"Ahaha, I'm not surprised Rain Dance worked out for you. The eighth gym is precisely what that one situation I talked about earlier was. Without Rain Dance I found it too difficult. Anyway, Dusknoir is decently bulky with a usable attack stat. Not bad, but in this situation he might be somewhat lacking. Honchkrow will cover any types Dusknoir has super effective STAB against while Jirachi will probably have the elemental punches along with Iron Head. In Z/O steel types retain their resistance against Ghost/Dark types, so don't worry about Jirachi's tankiness against those.   Your idea sounds good if you want to go with Rain Dance, though you don't have to force the synergy if you don't want to; it's just a suggestion.   Nothing in your team has any glaring flaws to me, I think you'll be fine."
pokemonzetaomicron,39ph20,bye_proxy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:31:37 2015 UTC,"I would replace Marowak for a sharpedo with Speed boost and staraptor for a ground type, like Nidoking or maybe Golurk"

pokemonzetaomicron,39mlfe,bye_proxy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:33:57 2015 UTC,"you might want to give your pokemon a more varied moveset. With wailord i would give it heavy slam when it reaches 70, and have it relearn bounce and maybe teach it ice beam  With Hariyama id change its ability to Guts if it isn't already, and give it a flame orb. reteach it fake out (get rid of surf) to make sure flame orb activates on the first turn (and maybe replace brick break for stone edge/rock slide/Custom Move?)  Give Absol Night Slash instead of bite  Get rid of cut and razor leaf on venusaur and give it sleep powder and growth. Unfortunately you don't get a good poison TM until later one. Maybe try considering replacing solarbeam with petal dance (both of them have drawbacks i suppose).  Rachiu is kinda like wailord because its special and physical attacking stats are the same. get rid of thundershock and give it grass knot, brick break, and custom move Ice if possible  Marowak is good, just give it bonemarang instead of bone club, double edge instead of earthquake, and make sure it has rock head for its ability (and that you have a thick club for it).  If you need to relearn any past moves, you can go to the move relearner in Treader Town+ steal heart scales from wild luvdisc in kivu town.

pokemonzetaomicron,39a71c,BlackCommandoXI,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:50:46 2015 UTC,recover makes up for it I guess.
pokemonzetaomicron,39a71c,Revengercm,4,Fri Jun 12 01:21:09 2015 UTC,"As Mongoose said, Magcargo can be difficult to run with its typing. If you have a connection to it you can manage, though it might be more difficult than other physically defensive pokemon.   I have doubts about taking Flygon over Garchomp. He is still most definitely strong though he is lacking in comparison. Garchomp has better bulk, higher stats, and as far as I remember a better move set. Again, flygon is definitely not a bad choice, though he might be slightly harder to run in comparison to Garchomp.  Also, I generally wouldn't lead with Gyarados. He tends to be better as a second or third switch in.   A few questions, what is your moveset on Gyarados, and who has your mega stone if have one at all?"
pokemonzetaomicron,39a71c,Damonblood7,2,Wed Jun 10 12:22:06 2015 UTC,"No megastone yet and my gyrados has dragon dance, Earthquake, Dive and giga impact."
pokemonzetaomicron,39a71c,Revengercm,4,Wed Jun 10 12:39:00 2015 UTC,"Ok. So with your gyarados dive is good for utility and damage however waterfall hits harder and has a small chance to flinch, and also can hit every turn. Earthquake, Dragon dance, and giga impact are all solid choices, however you may want to switch one, recommending giga impact personally, with ice fang to give you some offensive ice coverage as you don't have much. Which is really important for keeping dragon types under control.  Something to consider is adding rain in somewhere, gyarados and heliolisk are both good in rain. Heracross can set up rain dance if you have an available move slot and would make a decent lead. The only one it hinders at the moment is Magcargo with any offensive fire moves.   Heracross can also learn aerial ace which is a weird way to play him but nets you another way to deal with other fighting types which will hit Magcargo and Heliolisk hard.   Another nice thing about heliolisk is his access to eerie impulse which can turn him into a really good special wall after one cast. This goes well with the rain and his dryskin I mentioned earlier and can be run with toxic to turn him into a stalling play style. Again it is an odd form to play him in though it should work quite well. A sample move set could be Toxic, Thunder/Parabolic charge, eerie impulse and  thunder wave. I recommend some hp evs if you do though. He eeds a bit more bulk. Also gives you play style options as you may not have need for three special sweepers.    All in all you have a solid team. A few tweaks here and there can be considered in order to maximize your effectiveness in certain areas. I offered a few things I considered while looking at your team. In the end some of the things I have said aren't really relevant as much in the story at they would be in pvp battles should they ever be implemented."
pokemonzetaomicron,39a71c,Damonblood7,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:56:50 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for all the advice I will definitely look into a few of the things you mentioned. I actually was using waterfall but I had to swap for story mode getting around.

pokemonzetaomicron,39a71c,Revengercm,2,Fri Jun 12 00:23:27 2015 UTC,"Who cares about levitate? They're both dragons, Garchomp can out speed Flygon with a dragon type move and one shot it."

pokemonzetaomicron,39a71c,BlackCommandoXI,-3,Fri Jun 12 04:37:18 2015 UTC,Flygon still has reasons to be picked over Garchomp. I guess you're a noob who really doesn't know why I'm saying this.

pokemonzetaomicron,39013u,phantomholo,3,Mon Jun 8 06:50:44 2015 UTC,"You can't get a mega charizard until the Aroma region, so theres no real need to worry about it right now, but X is physical, whereas Y is special and sets up sunlight for your team. I'd say X is better for sweeping through the story and Y is stronger with a team revolving around sunlight. For now special Charizard doesn't have access to a few of his coverage moves so really you just want flamethrower and air slash (maybe fire blast for more dmg at the cost of acc) and perhaps sunny day with solar power. If u can spare a turn to setup sunlight then those flamethrowers will most likely be OHKOing anything that doesn't resist it. It would be a good idea to get a grass/electric type for Morgan and an ice type for Wilson."

The tip im gonna give is: Get Ice Beam via the game corner, no matter how much it costs, its essential to winning the fight with pokemon at that level.  Also, get either Milotic or Vaporeon, they are the only water pokemon capable of taking Energy Ball from Shaymin at levels 50-53, you need a water-type pokemon for shaymin(cause he will energy ball 100% on water-types), otherwise he is gonna air slash and ur gonna get flinched 24/7.  If you dont get Milotic of Vaporeon and teach Ice Beam to Samurott, you wont stand a chance cause Samurott isnt bulky enough to take Energy Ball."

pokemonzetaomicron,38n6gr,Nhadaly,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:17:57 2015 UTC,"Train up your Lucario, during leveling up your lucario, you should have had the option to learn Calm Mind and Aura Sphere, replace swords dance and force palm with those two, you dont need Dragon Pulse really with the coverage your other pokemon have and a power-up move is better for sweeping.  Same with Charizard, gotta have diversity, focus on Charizards special attacks, ev train your charizard at Special Attack and Speed, you should consider teaching it Solar Beam when you get your Charizardite mega stone, Will-o-wisp might also be good for those ultra powerful physical attackers(burn cuts atk in half), more options are always nice.  It seems like ur lacking 2 cores: a water type and a grass type, for your Water-type i recommend Milotic with this set: Scald, Ice Beam, Moonblast(should learn it during levelup like mine did), Recover. EV: 252 HP, 185 SPAtk, 72 SP Defence.  For your Grass Type, i recommend Roserade with: Giga Drain/Petal Dance(depending on what you want), Synthesis, Shadow Ball, Swagger. EV: 252 SPATK, 252 Speed.  You can view my two videos here as to how the Elite Four are, they are pretty easy to beat.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR-SLVEyDcQ  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkBArkl38zA  As for the champion, just put Choice Band on your Garchomp and spam Earthquake, you should be able to sweep her.  For Wilson, put choice scarf on your water-type and spam ice beam.  For Corlett, choice band Garchomp, spam earthquake, switch out of Garchomp when he puts in Eelektross and knock it out, switch back in to Garchomp and continue to earthquake your way to victory.  For Tobias, start with Lucario, start off with a Calm mind, then do an Aura Sphere, spam Aura Sphere until he swaps onto Hydreigon, then switch to your Milotic and use Moonblast, you can continue to use Moonblast to sweep the rest of the Team, swap to Milotic when he swaps in Honchkrow and use Icebeam, if he KOs Milotic, just switch to Lucario and use Aura Sphere, as a last pokemon, he will have a Misdreavus, but just use whatever move to beat it, its pretty weak.  As for Morgan, shes easy too as long as u carry an electric-type move and a grass-type move with you, Roserades gonna be a big contributor here, make sure to start with the pokemon that knows the electric type move first to beat swanna.  Overall pretty easy as long as u follow basic strategy and your pokemon are trained up to a respectable level."

pokemonzetaomicron,38efjw,bye_proxy,2,Wed Jun 3 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks! Honestly, it was a lot easier than I expected it to be. Granted, I made sure that the team was appropriately leveled (they all went in at ~71), but still. Honestly, Kangaskhan, Kingdra, and Sandslash were the real MVPs. While every member had a chance to shine, those three really pulled their weight.  Tobias wasn't so bad. Zoroark was a bit of a pain at first (nearly OHKO'd Sandslash -_-) but other than that complete pushover. Butterfree had a field day. 2 Quiver Dances + Bug Buzz = dead opponents.   Corlett was the easiest by far. Sandslash swept 4/6, Kanga cleaned up.  Morgan was annoying, but not too bad. Amoonguss just ate her for breakfast. Between Giga Drain Regenerator, and Amoonguss's giant HP, she really didn't have a chance.  Wilson was very, very annoying. I got lucky and got Flygon and his Mega out quickly, but a series of crits on his part knocked out half of the team. Thankfully, Rotom pulled it out with Parafusion hax and leftovers annoyance.  The last fight was painful, to say the least. Came down to Sandslash vs. the thunder-doge. Luckily, it was stupid enough to Calm Mind before attacking, allowing me to clench the win. Was really tense and fun.  Honestly, I've really come to love this team. They seem under-powered individually, but as a whole they have a good deal of synergy."
pokemonzetaomicron,38efjw,bye_proxy,2,Wed Jun 3 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"That does sound like it'd be pretty tense. Good luck on the sigil halls, and fighting ????"
pokemonzetaomicron,38efjw,bye_proxy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"For sake of completion:   Butterfree: Relaxed @ TwistedSpoon (Psychic, Quiver Dance, Bug Buzz, Sleep Powder)  Kingdra: Adamant @ Mystic Water (Waterfall, Dragon Dance, Outrage, FreezerBurn (Custom Move - Ice!)  Sandslash: Sassy @ Soft Sand (Earthquake, Brick Break, Swords Dance, Rock Slide)  Rotom-H: Docile @ Leftovers (Overheat, Thunderbolt, Confuse Ray, Shadow Ball)  Kangaskhan: Adamant @ Silk Scarf (Fake Out, Return, Crunch, Outrage)  Amoonguss: Sassy @ Miracle Seed (Giga Drain, Grass Knot, Spore, Acid)  Couple notes: First, the items are not nearly ideal, I know. I meant to go back and get a choice band and a life orb, but kind of forgot...so I just worked with what I had! Still worked out fine. I didn't worry about natures all that much, save for changing Kangaskhan's to adamant. Amoonguss's moveset is not ideal, but I didn't have access to Hidden Power or Sludge Bomb. I thought about changing Kanga's crunch to EQ or Brick Break, but forgot. Whoops! Sandslash originally had X-Scissor over Brick Break but I changed it temporarily and just never went back. At least for the E4, Brick Break had more utility."
pokemonzetaomicron,38d1h8,Vijij,2,Wed Jun 3 12:49:14 2015 UTC,"Grinding is a mostly unnecessary thing to do. You have several options - use the Pokemon you like, use Pokemon that will carry you through the game with fair ease (Good coverage, stats, nature, IV, EV, etc) or a mixture of both which is what I do. If you want to use Pokemon you like, disregard everything below and do as you deem fit. Here's what I think of your team.   Pidgeotto and Staravia do the same thing, only Staraptor is better later. Hawlucha and Machop also fulfill the same role, except Machamp is probably a better choice since you already have two other birds. Staraptor can learn Close Combat however which means it alone can cover the use of four Pokemon on your team. A Ghost type would render four of your Pokemon more or less useless since their STAB doesn't affect Ghost types. I don't find the their coverage to be particularly notable either..I guess Hawlucha makes a fairly good HM slave until later.  I highly suggest keeping Pokemon to a minimum unless you really like them/want them. If you're the kind that likes to keep 'mon levels equal it's not going to be easy doing that with 6 exp-hungry Pokemon so early in the game. No space for HM slaves either. You're not going to get an EXP share for a while either.  Water type Pokemon are a must. For HM later until the alternatives. Plus you're heavily reliant on offensive Pokemon that uses the Attack stat plus a Magmortar. May want other kinds of Pokemon.  Like I mentioned, it's possible to use Pokemon you like and still have good coverage for any situation. I like going fully offensive and have a Rotom-Frost, Kingdra, Mawile and Honchkrow with Poliwhirl and Hawlucha as HM slaves. I'll get a Leavanny (My favorite) and a Chandelure later. I like these Pokemon and I also have a wide array of moves. One for every type if I tried I think. So that's the way I play.   Whether your team is good or not is up to you. From a competitive standpoint, it's rather lacking. But if you love these Pokemon, then it's the best team in the world.  So about grinding, there's not really a good place to grind until much..much later. Feeding off wild Pokemon is slow and very, very boring. I suggest just cutting down on Pokemon if it's too slow."
pokemonzetaomicron,38d1h8,WaruAthena,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. The only Poke from that team I like is Staraptor. I was thinking if I should trade the Charmeleon I caught before Kivu town for an Absol. I also have 2 EXP shares (Secret Bases! :D) but I don't use them much, I think you are right, I should remove some of them, for now I am thinking of keeping: Magmar, Hawlucha, Staravia, Sandslash and probably Absol, so what about this team?   EDIT: It would be nice if you can trade a Pokemon. EDIT 2: I traded my Pidgeotto for Absol."
pokemonzetaomicron,38d1h8,WaruAthena,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:57:44 2015 UTC,"Magmortar has some truly stupid coverage, so it'll be able to make up for much of your lack later. Later in the game you'll have no way to do super effective damage to Ground and Dragon types, but I think only Dragon types should be worried about since you can just power through most Ground types anyway.  It's not bad, there aren't any particularly glaring weaknesses so you shouldn't do too badly. Be warned though, the game's difficulty doesn't go any lower. The opposite in fact."
pokemonzetaomicron,38d1h8,wheresbrazzers,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"On the topix of exp shares, you can also go into the cave in your secret base with the mining mini game and get a lucky egg or two, they give a big boost to xp gain and will help with keeping your pokemon leveled up without needing to grind."
pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Creeque,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:42:40 2015 UTC,"Personally I like Garchomp and would keep him for his high attack stats. I would choose to get rid of Hawlucha for something else like Charizard, then you can get something other than Magmortar. The team shouldn't matter too much untill very late game.  Also for gym 8, you're gonna want raindance or something. I recommend EQ spam with Garchomp, or setting up raindance for Kingdra to spam surf."

pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Revengercm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:01:22 2015 UTC,They changed it to balance it for Weepinbell I think. You're playing this game to know if megas were wrong to make? I don't understand.
pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Damonblood7,0,Tue Jun 9 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"No. To see if megas are broken. I probably will end up using one since I'm using alakazam and gengar. I never liked megas. It was a very wrong move. Now you have to use a mega and the things is. Every pokemon will end up with a mega and probably will permit 2-3 more megas each 2-3 games released since there will be more. Even no it's so stupid since primal kyogre, groudon and mega rayquaza/mewtwo makes the game look like a joke."
pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Revengercm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"When megas first came out I thought the same, but some megas bring new life to old unused pokemon like beedrill. I hadn't seen beedrill in forever and once he got a mega it was used more often. Mega banette on the other hand is pointless and just wastes the mega. It also adds a bit more strategy to battles. Also some pokemon's megas look badass so thats always a plus."
pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Damonblood7,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:09:18 2015 UTC,Well. Mega Tyranitar/Garchomp/Rayquaza make Mega Beedrill useless. Still have the same problem here.
pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Revengercm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"That's kind of irrelevant, a lot of pokemon make others useless."
pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Damonblood7,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:11:18 2015 UTC,It's irrelevant they made mega evolutions. The game is still so unbalanced lol.
pokemonzetaomicron,38bj4f,Revengercm,0,Tue Jun 9 21:50:43 2015 UTC,Just saw it lol. Pfff. Only -6. It still kicks ass. I hate mega evolutions but I guess that's why I'm playing this game to really know if megas were wrong to make.

pokemonzetaomicron,37y0sg,Megamean09,3,Sun May 31 10:14:58 2015 UTC,Switch-out moves seem to interact strangely with Pokemon. I think it has to do with the order things happen. I myself encountered a bug today that's somewhat related to yours.  I used U-Turn to K.O. an enemy Pokemon that did not faint until I switched into Honchkrow. Honchkrow's Moxie activated. The U-Turn Pokemon got the full EXP however.
pokemonzetaomicron,37y0sg,WaruAthena,1 point,Sun May 31 11:44:18 2015 UTC,"It's just an error in the way the game is coded. You may notice as well that leftovers, toxic orb, and other effects that happen at the same time happen slightly after when they should. It can sway a battle a little bit, but once you're used to it it's hard to even notice any more."

pokemonzetaomicron,37zugz,NicolasSn,1 point,Sun May 31 20:17:50 2015 UTC,Are you asking if one will come out? I don't think this game is under much development since the creators are most likely working on insurgence.

pokemonzetaomicron,37whx4,WaruAthena,1 point,Sun May 31 06:24:05 2015 UTC,Something defensive like Bronzong or supportive like Umbreon could work.  If you want to go fullyolooffensive something like Gengar could cover your remaining types.
pokemonzetaomicron,37whx4,Wulibo,2,Sun May 31 02:05:08 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll probably try to find an Aron somewhere to fill the defensive
pokemonzetaomicron,37whx4,WaruAthena,2,Sun May 31 04:19:46 2015 UTC,"I would recommend against a gengar, because that leaves three pokemon weak to psychic with nothing specially-tanky or resistant to psychic. For the same reason, Umbreon would be my pick.  For names, have you considered Chav?"
pokemonzetaomicron,37whx4,webobo,1 point,Sun May 31 23:12:26 2015 UTC,Exactly why that's the fullyolooffensive choice.  Another thing I'd like to add as an afterthought is filling out your team so early leaves you with no space for HM slaves (until the..alternatives) and being bogged down by the need to level everyone equally.   I highly suggest leaving that final space empty for the time being. From your levels it would seem you're still quite early in the game.
pokemonzetaomicron,37v0ub,et_kitten,1 point,Sat May 30 17:04:05 2015 UTC,Restart the game and try again?

You can already take out ground or water Pokemon with Swampert or Magnezone, just as long as the Pokemon isn't water AND ground. But you can teach Jirachi energy ball if you're that worried about that combo."
pokemonzetaomicron,37r7yw,DarrSwan,2,Fri May 29 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"Jirachi can have very strong type coverage and with a jolly nature + choice scarf will be able to outspeed most threats. iron head, ice punch, fire punch provide excellent coverage and strong synergy with serene grace. the last slot should have u-turn for a little more coverage and so that jirachi can act as a pivot and trade damage if you get a bad switch in"
pokemonzetaomicron,37r7yw,The-Gamble,2,Sat May 30 05:14:49 2015 UTC,Jirachi was very useful in my run. calm mind allows it to be very powerful.

pokemonzetaomicron,37s30p,Grabbioli,3,Fri May 29 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"when making a team, i always try to keep from having two of the same type in there. essentially, i think that one of the fighting types should be replaced. personally, i'm partial to blaziken. but that's your call. throw some electric in there! you got nothing to battle water with. to be completely honest, it doesnt look like a team that has a good coverage on fighting the various types.  either that, and i'm being overly judgmental. i dunno man."
pokemonzetaomicron,37s30p,ineptnorwegian,1 point,Fri May 29 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah the type coverage is lacking. If you're against a water type or a fast psychic type (unless Gengar is scarfed), it feels like you're going to be struggling. I'd switch out the staraptor for a honchkrow personally, but I ended up getting rid of mine even despite its usefulness. If you're close to rocket boots, staraptor for a tank that deals well with this type, such as Jellicent or Reuniclus, might be a better choice, since your team is a bit overly sweepy without much utility/wall factor. Even Rhyperior is a bit weak overall, the tradeoff of defenses for the weaknesses is thas are not worth it as your team's primary defensive pokemon. I do like a defensive ground type right now though, so idk."
pokemonzetaomicron,37s30p,Wulibo,1 point,Sat May 30 02:16:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd agree. I'd go with the lucario (is it special or phsyically oriented?), but if you've got speed boost on blaziken either one would be fine i suppose. Replacing one with a lapras or rotom might be a good idea  I would suggest giving your kingdra a custom move fighting if its physical, and megahorn on rhyperior."
pokemonzetaomicron,37s30p,bye_proxy,1 point,Fri May 29 23:26:39 2015 UTC,"In case you want to replace Lucario and Blaziken, Staraptor can use Close Combat. Of course there's a lack of STAB there, so it's up to you.   I'd use Lucario personally because of his fairly good coverage and good offensive stats. Keep in mind that both Lucario and Gengar can Mega Evolve, but only one of them can do so in a battle. And, well, Blaziken can as well."

Melanite on the other hand is created by another guy called raid12 smitty (thats all i know since i havent played melanite ) xD.

Insurgence is still developing and offers only 3 badges (around 20-30 hours depending on how fast you clear/play).. Its your decision though, so whatever you choose gl & hf :)"

pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,TheSalsage,8,Wed May 27 02:15:31 2015 UTC,Not really. The only new updates you would expect to see would be things like ORAS megas and it's highly likely that those aren't going to make an appearance until Insurgence is completed.

pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,Troop-the-Loop,-2,Wed May 27 02:38:50 2015 UTC,You can just type /r/PokemonInsurgence and it will link it for you....
pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,Clutz35,1 point,Wed May 27 09:13:10 2015 UTC,"He did do that, inside the link itself.  [Insurgence](/r/pokemoninsurgence)   If typing ""/r/PokemonInsurgence"" didn't auto-link to the subreddit, then of course his link wouldn't work as the way he typed it. Thus, he probably knew what he was doing. On the other hand, you assumed that he didn't know that would work, but didn't realize that maybe he just wanted it to look a certain way."
pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,featherfooted,-1,Wed May 27 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"But you can just type /r/PokemonInsurgence and it will link it for you. No need for brackets.

pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,Clutz35,3,Thu May 28 03:53:06 2015 UTC,"I'm saying there's no way he didn't know, given how he typed it into the link."
pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,featherfooted,-1,Thu May 28 04:07:18 2015 UTC,How? I used to not know that doing that would work but I knew how to link things through brackets. How are you assuming that he knows something when he might not know about it at all?
pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,Clutz35,2,Thu May 28 05:25:23 2015 UTC,"Because if he didn't, then the way he typed the link:  [Insurgence](/r/pokemoninsurgence)   would be literally impossible otherwise. Why would ""/r/pokemoninsurgence"" be a relevant thing to type into the parentheses if ""/r/pokemoninsurgence"" didn't automatically become /r/pokemoninsurgence?"
pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,featherfooted,-1,Thu May 28 05:33:19 2015 UTC,Your logic make no sense. Like I said before I knew how to link things in brackets before I knew that putting /r/ in front of the sub name automatically linked it
pokemonzetaomicron,37eq4b,Clutz35,2,Thu May 28 05:41:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you know how to link things in brackets. That requires that you know to put a URL into the parentheses of the href link, right?  If I try to create a link that doesn't go anywhere, such as:  [testing](testing)   We see that it doesn't create a link: [testing](testing)  On the other hand, if I create a relative path   [testing](/testing)   or a direct link  [testing](http://www.google.com/)   then either will work, as seen here and here.  What this implies is that if he was smart enough to type in ""/r/pokemoninsurgence"" into the parentheses link section of that Markdown, then I think it's safe to assume that he's smart enough to know that it will interpret that text as a relative link if it's not inside brackets. If he didn't know that putting ""/r/"" in front of some text would create a link to a subreddit, then how the fuck would he expect typing that into a bracket to work? It would be like the first example - a broken path that doesn't go anywhere."

His SP.A isn't that bad either. Personal preference, Mismagius because she's a cool witch. Gengar can Mega Evolve for even stupider offensive powers + Shadow Tag, while Cofagrigus is an excellent Pokemon that can wall enemies while doing damage at the same time.  If you want, you can breed Misdreavus and Ghastly to get that Modest on Ghastly. Misdreavus has to be male and carry an Everstone though."

pokemonzetaomicron,379nl8,Byakayu_Togami,1 point,Tue May 26 00:22:16 2015 UTC,"I can't say I'm an expert on this kind of situation, but I'll just drop my opinion in case it helps. Competitive battles are very different from the in-game ones.  Kingdra looks good. Magmortar has stupidly huge coverage with the SP.A to back it up. Let's say you put Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Focus Blast and Dark Pulse on it. You'll pretty much have perfect coverage. So I think an Expert Belt could work too. It's a little less powerful than Life Orb but..that's a lot of Life Orbs you got there. Sunny Day will clash with Kingdra's water moves if you need them for whatever reason. Plus it's somewhat unnecessary in random battles because you can just spend two turns crushing them instead. You don't have anyone else who can benefit off Sunny Day (Like Chlorophyll Whimsicott with Solar Beam).   Prankster users will find a lot more use in competitive battling than in the actual game. I think you should definitely store Whimsicott for someone else, because otherwise you're going to have to do a lot to make it work well. Encore, Taunt and such are options to consider on Prankster Whimsicott. Life Orb and Wide Lens aren't really a good idea because it's more of a support, not a fighter. Leftovers might be a better idea.  Absol looks good. Scope Lens might be a better choice because he's very frail.   Swoobat with Simple would be a lot easier to work with. If you really want a Psychic/Flying type, I suggest a Sigilyph. Sigilyph has a pretty good movepool, can use Fly and you can be really cheesy if you want. Get Sigilyph with Magic Guard and carry a Flame Orb, it won't take damage from the burn. Psycho Shift the burn to opposing physical Pokemon, set up with Cosmic Power, go nuts with Stored Power and heal with Roost. I think you have to do some breeding to do this though.   Offensive Crustle doesn't really need a Rocky Helmet. He's not going to last that long in the field to take advantage of the chip damage from Rocky Helmet after using Shell Smash anyway. Usually something like a White Herb used on him, but in random battles it'll get used up. Stealth Rock is Satan's creation in competitive battling but I'm not so sure it's as useful in random battles. Maybe specific gyms.   Just my two cents."

pokemonzetaomicron,377hh5,Shiny_SplaSh,4,Mon May 25 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"I just started playing Omicron yesterday, here's what I've found so far.  Talk to everyone. Everyone. Make an internal checklist when you enter a town. Have I entered this house? Have I talked to this guy? If not, do so.  Be a kleptomaniac. Check everything. Plates, televisions, dustbins..you'll never know what you'll find. I've yet to come across an Itemfinder, so you're just going to have to check anything you feel is suspicious.  Keep potion stocks on hand. Seriously. This game is not easy. Well, at least early to mid game. I dunno about the late game because I'm in the middle of the fifth gym at the moment. I don't find money to be an issue right now, so there's no need to be a scrooge.  Keep Pokeball stocks on hand. This one's..kind of a no-brainer though. Still, you want to make sure you have a comfortable amount. Some of the 'mons have satanic catch rates.   HM slaves are not mandatory this game. I'll let you figure this out yourself. Just keep in mind - exploring is your friend. Every time you achieve something, double back to check previously blocked roads.   Free items don't come by very often, so make sure you buy status items. Especially paralysis heals. So much paralysis heals.   The mechanics seem to follow Gen 5, yet there are some Gen 6 stuff in here too. Example, Steel types are still resistant to Ghost/Dark. However there are Fairy types too.   That's all I can think of for now."

The trainers tend to have really strong movesets and IVs/EVs to make up for their mediocre AI (not that it's the creator's fault, good AI is more trouble than it's worth). Once your movesets catch up it gets a lot easier.  It helps if you pursue things that a competitive player would find useful, IE good natures and good EVs.

They seem to appear in every area of the game, and either early game, late game, on the ocean, they WILL appear.   Probably the weirdest part; all they do is struggle. not a single move is used, and even though i know this guy is one of those new legendary pokemon which people dont know much about yet, i don't think you should be able to find it just everywhere.  It doesnt affect me that much, because as it is a nuzlocke i only catch the first pokemon in each area; and these hoopas havent appeared as first encounters ever. They do make up for some nice experience when im grinding, which is great, they are usually worth 3 kills, and all they do is struggle which ends up taking 1/4th of their HP. Great stuff, suze.  So the point of this post is just to let game developers know of this possible bug (not quite sure if its even a bug), and maybe get it ready for future patches."
pokemonzetaomicron,373278,1ofthe4rocketbros,3,Sun May 24 12:17:24 2015 UTC,Hoopa appearing anywhere isn't a bug since it's a roaming encounter that is unlocked after the Elite Four has been defeated. If it's captured once it will never appear again.  Struggling may be a bug if and only if it didn't use any moves at any point in history when you encountered it in the wild. I believe it saves the PP used after every encounter.

And it can learn Nasty Plot as a Riolu or get Swords Dance to boost either stat. I think people prefer it's physical set due to better move options, especially for fighting STAB, but in-game it's good in any way.  As for team recs, if you go with Deino, then a Torterra on Route 3X could be a good fit, or another grass type from there to deal with water types (electric types work too, but it'd give you a third team weakness to ground). And speaking of water types, I'd probably grab one of those for your last spot, or possibly a flying type."

pokemonzetaomicron,36bkpy,jtmiller2017,1 point,Mon May 18 01:31:26 2015 UTC,"Your team is quite solid, but I would use a physical attacker to compliment my two special attackers. As it is you have issues dealing with Pokémon with good special defenses. Good attackers include Gyrados, Scizor, Garchomp, Excadrill, etc. All three of your Pokémon are also kind of skimpy on the defensive capabilities too. I could see a team of normals with high HP being a problem, as they would probably survive your first strikes and hit back hard. If the other side got off a dragon dance they could wreck your whole line up with STAB moves, they wouldn't even need to be super effective. So you're looking at a bulky physical attacker being a solid bet. I would consider either Scizor or Gyrados. If you do Gyrados, send it out first so its water STAB isn't nerfed by the sun.  Just looking at your team as is, I question leading with Charzard. Drought nerfs Greninja's hydro pump. Charizard does have excellent coverage but dies instantly to pretty much any rock type move. I also question putting dragon pulse on Charizard. I get the need to hit dragons super effectively, but dragon pulse is kind of useless against everything else. I would consider using air slash as a more powerful move that would let you hit fighting types super effectively. It all depends on which type you find yourself having more problems with, though. Gengar could probably use focus blast over destiny bond. It gives you a way to hit normals super effectively and lets Gengar do something other than suicide against steel types. Hitting rock types is just a bonus.  Finally you have no defense against Mega-Reuniclus. I'm not sure there is a good defense against Mega-Reuniclus (which is one of the most broken Pokémon in the game), but still."

That said, OP can farm IV stones through the ""platform"" secret base upgrade (just save before you open the pokeball and reset until you get one) to help out. Only get one every day, so maybe not the most attractive option if you like to play in large chunks, but it's probably a lot easier than attempting to breed a great/perfect IV spread female Eevee."

pokemonzetaomicron,35tycl,phantomholo,1 point,Wed May 13 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"Frankly you have a ton of overlap with these three. All of them have earthquake, a fire move, and a dragon move, and on top of that each one shares a type with another. Not to mention, you're pretty much using them all as physical attackers. I would recommend ditching one of your dragons (probably Dragonite) and switch Charizard to a special attacker if possible. That stab eq from Garchomp will be invaluable against many elite four pokemon. Other than that the only concrete suggestion I have is pick up a Metagross, mine did most of the heavy lifting through my Vesyryn elite 4."
pokemonzetaomicron,35tycl,gburke,1 point,Wed May 13 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"Pokémon I have used that were good: Scizor, Magnezone, Porygon Z, Excadrill, Metagross, Salamence, Staraptor, and Gyrados.  As for your team, I agree with the other poster that you don't need two dragon types like this. It leaves your team too vulnerable to ice and dragon. Now you can correct that with the other Pokémon you add, but you will be starting with a disadvantage.  On to specifics. Garchomp would probably be better served by dragon claw instead of dragon rush. The accuracy loss can screw you at the worst times. Fire fang is also an iffy move as you have Charizard for that. Consider crunch or rock slide for coverage. Charizard needs to ditch dragon rage and probably dragon claw too, seeing as you have two dragons that get STAB and have better attack stats. Consider brick break, shadow claw, or rock slide, again for coverage. Dragonite could seriously use aqua tail or waterfall over fire punch. Outrage is risky too, dragon claw could be a safer option."

pokemonzetaomicron,35r2ba,finelbell,1 point,Tue May 12 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"Long answer: The late late game of Z/O is going to put ""competitively"" strong pokemon against you,. I swept the final boss with a team 20 levels lower then him, with no trouble, because my team was a competitive standard. If you don't know what that means, there's no reason, there's a website called smogon, where people who are WAAAAAAAAAAY into pokemon rank pokemon based on their battling prowess.   Now should this stop you from using the pokemon you want? Hell no, use your favorites! Game might be hard, but it's always more important to enjoy your team then for it to be powerful, but if you want power, look up some standard competitive team and pull the types you need from their list.  Now on a less ranty angle, you lack a way to deal with fire types, a common type in the game, so a ground type is advisable, I'd recommend Garchomp if you're playing Zeta, he's a powerhouse, and offers a powerful dragon type, even if you already have Kingdra. As for your last pokemon, if you want to swap blitzle out I highly recommend filing in another electric or ice type so you have a flying type counter, something you'd lack without it, Luxray is a favorite of mine, but galvantula is a worthy notice simply based on the bug typing and it's powerful ability, compoundeyes. You already have a steel type, but both Metagross and Magnezone deserve a mention as being awesome, and hugely powerful. Gengar is good if you decide to drop scyther and need a pokemon to deal with psychic/ghost types  TL;DR, Use what YOU like, Garchomp is awesome, galvantula/luxray can replace blitzle.  Sorry for ranting, but I didn't know what kind of team advice you wanted :D"
pokemonzetaomicron,35r2ba,dantraman,1 point,Wed May 13 02:17:08 2015 UTC,"Keep the Blitzle. Something fast to knock down flying types is really useful. I actually used a Kingdra and a houndoom all the way to the end of my play through, so I'd say you're on the right track there."

On charizard to replace fly I'd give him Eq as well just for coverage for the 8th gym. On staraptor I'd replace fly with maybe roost or u-turn?"
pokemonzetaomicron,35dj69,Collagekid1024,1 point,Sat May 9 11:12:33 2015 UTC,"Charizard needs more special moves. He is much better at special attacking than physical. Replace fly with air slash at the very least. I'd consider replacing hydro pump with surf while you're playing the campaign. Hydro pump just doesn't have the pp to handle multiple battles. Thunderbolt is probably a better choice over uproar too. Garchomp doesn't need dragon rush and dragon claw, the power difference isn't big enough to justify the accuracy loss. I'd consider crunch or ice fang. I prefer rock slide over stone edge because of accuracy and pp issues. Dark epitaph is not a very good move. All OHKO moves are pretty bad. Consider adding ice beam, thunderbolt, or psychic to Darkrai to add coverage. Will-o-wisp is also kinda bad against the computer as it doesn't really use strategy. It's better to knock out the opponent than to disable it. Consider double team for Staraptor."

I just didnt wanna lose risking the game just before second region.  here is my team after i finished the 3 final battles, http://prntscr.com/70bnfl  Gengar died because i needed a safe switch into odin's shaymin sky, an unfortunate event because of a bad switch :/  Just for curiosity here is the remaining pokemon i had in my box: http://prntscr.com/70boyo  All first encounters from certain routes/cities or special encounters.  Not really sure how to deal with safari pokemon because they always run, but i always caught the first one that would get in the pokeball, like staraptor. Not sure if cheating or not, but i didn't really use any safari pokemon except for girafarig.  Death box: http://prntscr.com/70bpw8  Some ridiculous deaths in there, including by 1HKO moves and i am almost positive a bug, after getting 4 cosmic powers up on my jirachi he gets killed by an EQ quagsire, im pretty sure that +4 defense was enough to stop it, but oh well. I also got hit by a dark type move with that dark fake pokemon similar to diavevus, for some reason i didnt assume it was indeed a darktype.  Hope next region is as cool as this one, really cool game, glad to see people working on making such awesome challenges and pokemon games"
pokemonzetaomicron,34j7eb,bye_proxy,2,Fri May 1 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"good job mate, ive been meaning to do the same.  About the jirachi btw, if the quagsire had unaware instead of water absorb or damp it would have ignored the stat changes and hit normally"

Tri Polar was replaced by Raikou after I beat Wilson.  Glitch was replaced after I decided it was time to add my favourite Pokemon (Dragonite) to my team.  Cpt Ginyu replaced Wings when I decided to complete the Shadow Pokemon storyline.  The Greninja I caught and purified happened to be timid so he made the cut.    Kaze, ZipZapCat, and Cpt Ginyu all have their dream world abilities making them extra awesome.  Volt Absorb Raikou's so cool.  I wish they'd release it in the actual games."

pokemonzetaomicron,34jb3q,Eddie_L,2,Fri May 1 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"Lugia (and this is unique to lugia) requires all 9 purification slots in the purifying chamber to have ""perfect circles"".  Then put Lugia in the centre of one of these circles and it'll be instantly purified.    This is a reference to Pokemon XD where the same bullshit has to be done because, in the story, it's said to be impossible to purify so they have to do a whole thing.    An example of a perfect circle would be Fire->Grass->Water->Rock.  Normal types are treated as super effective against each other so, if you're running low on pokemon to make perfect circles, catch a shit tonne of random normal types.  4 normal types per ring and you're good."

pokemonzetaomicron,34h2yf,realguy456,2,Fri May 1 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"Obviously consider leveling up. If you haven't spoiled yourself on the final battles (and I'm assuming you're in Aroma), the highest level opponents are in the mid-90s. Some have beaten the end section with a team around your levels, but it generally takes a great sweeper or a lot of item use.  I'd drop Iron Head off Gyarados since steel's a pretty bad attacking type, especially in the mostly fairyless Z/O. I'd say either Earthquake or relearn Ice Fang for the replacement. Leftovers is probably best if you're running a Dragon Dancer.  Maybe go with Nasty Plot over Shadow Force on Hoopa to really up your special attack stats. You might then switch out Toxic for one of its other special attacks (Thunderbolt, Energy Ball, Focus Blast, etc), or Thunder Wave might be better to give yourself possible time to set up.  I think Sceptile can learn Superpower off the move tutors in Z/O, so put that on over Detect."

pokemonzetaomicron,349cvr,phantomholo,2,Wed Apr 29 09:51:20 2015 UTC,"you would need a varied type team. Just for reference, my team consists of Garchomp, Lucario, Sceptile, Tyranitar, Kingdra, and Charizard.  First pick your water-type pokemon. There are a lot of good water type pokemon there, e.g. Gyarados, water starters, Lapras, Vaporeon, Walrein, etc Then pick the types to cover everything else. My suggestion would be Lucario, Lucario is Steel-Fighting, it's a good typing offensively and defensively Another suggestion is Garchomp, Garchomp is simply a beast! And considering how easy it is to get tm 26 earthquake here, Garchomp would be my primary choice  But really, you should choose what pokemon would you like to use first."

pokemonzetaomicron,349cvr,officer21,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:26:23 2015 UTC,"Lucario might run better with aura sphere and close combat as stabs, aura sphere is special which hits physical walls hard, stone edge or earthquake to deal with any fire types that come at you, and then the last move can be anything like iron tail, psychic, extremespeed, swords dance, or ice punch. If you are going to use both physical and special attacks, I would actually recommend naive nature, which increases speed an lowers special d, as most attacks that are super effective to him are physical. Naughty (+atk -spD) and Rash (+spA -spD) also work. If you want a physical attacker, adamant or jolly. Special attacker, go with modest or timid."

Wash is generally better, but you'll need another water type anyway since you'll need HMs to get around at first, and Wash can't learn Surf nor Waterfall.

Pretty much all of his best moves can be taught via tm later. Grind either with wild pokemon or the trainer at your secret base (expensive but a real time-saver) You'll need at least level 30ish. Don't be afraid to buy X Att, X Def, or whatever. They can really help if you have the turns to waste using them.

Because you can only mega evolve ONE Pokemon per battle, every other Pokemon that is holding a mega stone loses a slot for a different item. In more difficult games like Zeta/Omicron, using mega evolving Pokemon only can be a hinderance. But, if you like a challenge, then it should make the game more fun."

For example, having a pokemon faint in a double battle will require them to be replaced at the end of that move. This means they can still be targeted that turn. Also, if you choose to use Protect in double battles, be aware that the enemy pokemon will sometimes not be hit if you use a multi-opponent move (Earthquake, Surf, etc...)."

From a personal view as beginning programmer I wouldn't see myself rolling out a patch for a game as completed as ZO when I'm already working on the next for at least as long as the next isn't to the same extent completed.   That all said, I believe there was someone who posted his fixed sprites on the or the Insurgence subreddit, for example that in the original build (at the time) had Frogadier crying like Missingno. Ergo I would say, search that.   If that doesn't fix the problem, I'm sure that the cries must be available somewhere.

Life orb should really come down to whether you really need the extra power to 1HKO your enemies, and, if you're using quiver dance, you could probably manage without the extra power."
pokemonzetaomicron,333tsc,Revolutionaru,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:58:17 2015 UTC,The thing is that Volcarona rarely gets to quiver dance because of said frailty.

If you haven't had to build a competitive team or IV train before you'll have to now. I would recommend not training a full team of six for the first three of four towns so that trainers keep your levels up. There are two regions in this game and that means you will eventually build two teams. There are items that are replacements for HM moves. They really help, so pick them up when you can. They typically require the HM to get. Upgrade your secret base when you get it, it's incredibly useful. Your starter will evolve at level 38 on it's own, so don't worry about that. There is a lucky egg to be had within the first few towns, it really makes leveling easier. The Zangoose/Seviper guy gives the opposite of what you ask for. You only get one chance at a Ditto in the first half of the game, be ready when surrounded by Science. There is a Corsola with Pokerus that makes EV training much easier, but you'll need a mystery gift to get your one chance at it. Don't be too off put when things look difficult, and be sure to enjoy the plot and NPC dialogue (especially in Victory Road)."

Choice scarf/band garchomp does the same thing the mega does, but just harder/faster. Change protect to another coverage move, crunch/ custom move fire being a good bet  If you're going to use hypnosis, maybe use a zoom lens instead of black sludge, since Gengar doesnt really need the recovery outside of Dream Eater, and it shouldnt be taking any hits at all.

Unfortunately, you can't get Focus Blast in Vesryn, so Grass Knot or later Thunder Wave is a good replacement. As for Gyro Ball, as suggested earlier, Calm Mind is good, especially since you don't really have any other stat boosters.  For Hippowdon, steal a Heart Scale and relearn either Ice Fang or Fire Fang over Fissure.  As for your replacements, I'd say a good fit for your team would be Lucario. I know tons of people have him on their team, but for good reason. It's got so many great attacking options for both physical and special attacks, and your team could really use the fighting type. Unfortunately, it'll take a bit to get it up to speed, since it's only available as a low level Riolu found as a 5% chance in Wonder Cave's second floor. And it evolves through happiness, so definitely catch it in a Luxury/Friend Ball.  For your other pick, you could use another water type killer since you're getting rid of Eelektross. Ampharos could be a good choice, available as a Mareep egg in Blackfist Department Store. it's bulky with solid special attack options. Or you could get a physical attacker in Electivire, obtainable as an Elekid through a Secret Base trade. If grass types are more your speed though, Roserade (obtainable as a Roselia on Route 310) or Sceptile (as a Treecko through a starters Secret Base upgrade) are good special attackers, while Delta Snorlax on Route 310 is an interesting physical option. You could also combine the two by catching Rotom in Onega Town and using its Mow form.  Oh also, drop Air Slash off Pidgeot and give it U-Turn. If you're getting a grass or electric type you should probably change your Custom Move too."
pokemonzetaomicron,32naef,welcome2thejam,3,Wed Apr 15 05:45:25 2015 UTC,That was really in depth and really helpful! Thank you so much! I'm thinking about using a Roserade because I saw somebody else post it as an option for someone else's team. This is great thanks again!

His only real help to you is hopefully being a meatshield for the first few turns, so take advantage of that and set up stat boosts to help you sweep. Drop 1-3 X Attacks and X Speeds (especially the latter) on your Hippowdon, heal up, and drop Earthquakes and Rock Slides to hopefully destroy two Pokémon at once. Also helps if you have Sandstream and/or Sandstorm so you can mess up the sun.   Backup strategy would be your Kingdra. Boost up with Dragon Dance if it's a physical attacker, or for special attacking variations, use a choice specs/scarf plus an X item of the other stat and Surf's up."

The dialogue felt a bit unnatural at times, mostly in the opening speech, but it's obviously early in the development and can be improved. I know they're putting a very heavy focus on the story in Insurgence, so I'm hoping for good things.

Also, Poison Heal Gliscor is really nice to have, definitely evolve Gligar. I would also reconmend Lucario, because he destroys everything. As for training, the Trainer in your base gives great exp, use a lucky egg and remember you can get exp. shares from the pokeball in your base easily with some resetting, for the money needed to fight him, just farm trainers with an amulet coin or mine stuff and sell it. Also, ev training and good ivs and natures really help with those battles! Best of luck, and remember that a chimchar automaticaly lets you  win the game because it is so awesome."
pokemonzetaomicron,32cmme,HappyChimchar235,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"Your team has a massive ice type weakness. Ditch Maractus and Golurk at the very least. All of the above suggested pokemon are good special attackers to try. You can get a Garchomp to replace the Golurk for ground, or you can try to pick up an Excadrill. I personally prefer Gyrados to Kingdra and Tyranitar to Zoroark. You can catch Metang on Mt. Press, they're awesome once they evolve to Metagross. Scizor is also a solid pokemon worth trying.  As for leveling up, do you EV train your pokemon? EV training is a good way to increase a pokemon's strength without having to level up much. You may want to try the Simulator Depot in Fianga City. Upstairs you can challenge YOGSCAST Martyn. His pokemon are 69-73 but are mostly crappy, except for the Lucario. If you can beat him, and it's not all that hard to do, you'll get a ton of xp and a nice chunk of change. Repeat until you reach the level you need."
pokemonzetaomicron,32cmme,Collagekid1024,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:38:04 2015 UTC,"You can't access the Simulation Challenges until Blackfist Residential, and IDs can't be bought until Caspian City, and he's still at Mt. press, so that's not an option. For money, mining's a good way. With a decent ghost type, facing Devon in the secret base is a really great way to grind up money and experience too. Outside of his Conkeldurr, who knows Stone Edge, none of his pokemon have attacking moves that can affect you.  As for your team, Kingdra, Staraptor, and Gligar (if you evolve) are definitely useable. Zoroark is decent, though there's possibly better options: Houndoom, Gengar, Gardevoir, Alakazam, and possibly a mixed Spiritomb are strong special attacker replacements depending on what else you need. You can also catch a Magby in Fianga IIRC since you picked Horsea as your starter, though I still can't recall if he gets the starter moveset. If you're not attached, Maractus can go, and Golurk gives a ground type overlap.  I'd definitely grab a fighting type, or at least a type that uses fighting moves well. As for a water type killer, outside of what's been mentioned, Rotom-Mow, Venusaur, Roserade, Electivire, Breloom, and Ampharos (though only available post Mt. Press) are all good options."
pokemonzetaomicron,32cmme,welcome2thejam,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:12:15 2015 UTC,"Is Roserade a good Pokemon, in general? I've always wanted to use one but it seems a little lacking in some regards."
pokemonzetaomicron,32cmme,astrocartog,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think he's great. Really good special stats, capable of using both spike hazards, decent move set and typing.

It’s also hard to EV train when I don’t have EV reducing berries. Garchomp is even more weak to ice than Golurk, but I wouldn’t mind using it once I get to blackfist. Another problem is that Kingdra is one of my only special attackers, and Zoroark will be once I can easily access TMs. But if I do replace my team, which I might try, I will EV train."
pokemonzetaomicron,32d6h5,TrexTrash,2,Sun Apr 12 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"Neither Torterra or Claydol is the best at what they do. Torterra is really slow and lacks special defense, while Claydol just doesn't have enough strength to hurt the enemy. It sounds like you are looking for a solid ground type. If so, I'd recommend Excadrill. Its very fast and packs a hefty punch. Same goes for Garchomp. If you really want a psychic type I think you'd be better off with Alakazam, Gardevoir, Reuniclus, or Espeon. If I had to choose between Torterra and Claydol, I would use Torterra because of its greater power. Defenses don't mean as much in random trainer battles that you should be trying to end as quickly as possible."

Also I think you could buy a focus sash instead at this point in the game. It's one time use though so I'd recommend saving before the battle.

pokemonzetaomicron,326ag8,blindsyde84,12,Fri Apr 10 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, 17 ultra balls to catch a Klinglang isn't that unbelievable. In the pokémon games, each kind of pokémon has a ""Catch Rate"". Klinglang has a catch rate of 30, Jirachi has a catch rate of 3.   This means that, at full health and using a regular pokéball, Klinglang has a 4.9% chance of being caught, and Jirachi has a 0.4% chance of being caught.  Keep in mind some pokémon have much lower catch rate then others, for example most of the starter pokémon, some legendaries, and some last-evolution pokémon. This is because these pokémon were implemented to be obtained through other means, such as events or evolution, and so their catch rates weren't very important in the original games.  So, yeah, their catch rates are a little wonky; but there is a reason for it, and it's not big enough a deal to change the values, so they've been left the way they are."
pokemonzetaomicron,326ag8,winkwright,5,Fri Apr 10 23:33:16 2015 UTC,If hes telling the truth a level 47 klinklang at 1hp and paralyzed should have a 26% chance to be caught in the main series games. 40 tries is probably a little embelished but even anything about like 10 is insane.
pokemonzetaomicron,326ag8,GrassGenie,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:08:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, some advice:   Catching pokemon is done by a probability distribution. So even if it seems like the pokemon shouldn't put up a fight, you can't be certain. There is a randomizer mode in the game. I've caught arceus at level 4 or 5 by sheer luck. That said, there was some issues with some catch rates. I remember when I first got zeta it took me an unholy amount of attempts to catch a heliolisk, of all things. Save before battling legendaries. If possible try to have a master ball handy - you can get more from your secret base, so use it if the alternative is losing the pokemon. Similarly, you can get free ultra balls from your secret base (more common than master balls. Just save each day before you use the item ball and reload until you get something useful, it should only take a moment."

pokemonzetaomicron,326q5q,Flushay,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:27:26 2015 UTC,"You have a serious fighting weakness. Gyrados would be a nice way to offset this, but Greninja is pretty good too. Gyrados has superior bulk and power, but Greninja getting STAB all the time is good too. I would give the edge to Gyrados because its ability to change type upon mega evolving lends itself to lots of interesting possibilities.  I'm not a huge fan of Magmortar. I think Charizard is the better fire type in this game, partially due to Magmortar's nerf. You can catch Volcarona, who I think is the best fire type, but only just before the end, too late to really be useful.  Lucario is one to consider as a replacement for Gallade. It adds to your fighting weakness, but has better nonspecial bulk and speed. Blaziken is also a pretty awesome fighting type.  Dragonite and Ferrothorn are fine.  Garchomp is a better choice than Krookodile for the ground slot."
pokemonzetaomicron,326q5q,Collagekid1024,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:39:09 2015 UTC,Hmmm but surely if I add both charizard and gyarados that's 3 flying types and if I add garchomp that's another dragon type. Also do you know where to catch a riolu/lucario?

Two dragons on a team is not as much of an issue as you might think, their stats are generally high enough to offset the disadvantage. If I had to choose I would take Garchomp. Dragonite is bulkier but that doesn't matter as much when you are one-shotting just about everything. Plus you need a good earthquake user. An Excadrill could also be used to fill the slot but then you still have the fighting weakness issue."

You can use it right at the start of battle, then potentially once more once her Charizard comes out unless you think you can outspeed it.  Alternately, if your Gyarados has Moxie, I'd actually maybe hold off on mega evolving, since an Earthquake that takes out both of Miranda's onscreen pokemon and Jake's own pokemon should net you three attack boosts, enough to destroy anything. Add on maybe an X Speed use or two or Dragon Dance to start off so you can beat the Choice Scarf users.  Plus, if you have anything that can use Surf, Earthquake, or Rock Slide well, they're pretty useful since they hit at least two things at once.  How I personally did it was I sent out a Drizzle Politoed right at the start to kill the sun, then sent out Kingdra. Set up a few Dragon Dances, healed, and went to town with Waterfalls and Custom Move Rock."
pokemonzetaomicron,320na7,welcome2thejam,2,Thu Apr 9 18:21:51 2015 UTC,I gave rain dance to 2 of my pokemon. I still barely beat her. I hate that fucking Charizard.
pokemonzetaomicron,320na7,juliaworm,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:40:02 2015 UTC,I just trained an Excadrill with rock slide and earthquake. Once he was maybe 2 lvls higher than her pokemon he could outspeed them all.
pokemonzetaomicron,320na7,Blurkmasterjay,2,Fri Apr 10 10:17:38 2015 UTC,"Swords Dance and Dragons Dance are overpowered vs NPCs.  I remember my Blaziken with Speed Boost beating it pretty easily, do one or two Swords Dance and literally one shot everything with Earthquake (including Jake's Pokemon, which was even better)."
pokemonzetaomicron,320na7,PTJohe,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:40:08 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, I personally used a Haxorus that was around level 60 to beat it. Set up a dragon dance first turn then just kill everything with earthquake and rockslide. The dragon dance first turn allows you to outspeed her team and the attack boost (plus life orb) is enough for earthquake to one shot pretty much everything. If Haxorus dies first turn just reset."
pokemonzetaomicron,320na7,Renekton,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"Almost all of her pokemon know grass moves. Your best bet is to find a pokemon that's weak to neither fire nor grass, teach it a rock move and pray to fuck that you can sweep, because that mega charizard is going to whoop your ass.  Seriously, focus on her secondary typings, because you'll get nowhere trying to take advantage of the fire type."

Try putting your Togepi out front and talking to it. When it says it loves nothing more than being with you it should be very, very close to evolving.

Also of  you are playing zeta you can capture Darkrai after the story (before pokemon league) and in my opinion he is better than Zoroark, I have used them both."
pokemonzetaomicron,31yn62,Blurkmasterjay,1 point,Thu Apr 9 09:18:32 2015 UTC,I don’t believe you can get raquaza until the second region.
pokemonzetaomicron,31yn62,Gengar16,1 point,Thu Apr 9 10:37:44 2015 UTC,Ya I'm already done with the second region and am just looking for a solid team.
pokemonzetaomicron,31yn62,Collagekid1024,2,Thu Apr 9 14:47:53 2015 UTC,"If you are done with the second region than all that is left is the postgame. This team is just not powerful enough to deal with the postgame. Rayquaza is banned from most of the post game content. Forretress lacks any real offensive ability. Cloyster lacks speed and special defense, a good chunk of the time it will die before it can shell smash or set up entry hazards. Zoroark is an alright special attacker, but has issues with bulk and coverage. Snorlax also has issues with speed, defense, and coverage. It's bulky, but any physical attacker worth its salt will demolish with a fighting type move. Aggron has a debilitating 4x weakness to fighting, terrible speed, and crap special defense. Its mega evolution is an improvement, but it still has the same issues, minus the fighting weakness. The postgame for this game is chock full of trainers with level 120 pokemon fighting with competitive movesets. Without upgrading your pokemon you will struggle.  I'd recommend Gyrados over Cloyster. Gyrados hits a lot harder and has more coverage options. Plus he can mega evolve for the added oomph. If you want an ice type I'd look at Mamoswine. He hits pretty hard too, with ok bulk. If you want to keep Cloyster I would run icicle spear and shell smash if you aren't already.  Hydreigon is superior to Zoroark in just about every way except speed. If you want to keep Zoroark go with whatever you want, just be sure it has dark pulse.  There aren't all that many good normal type pokemon. Consider replacing it with something hard hitting like Excadrill, Volcarona, or Greninja. Mega Kangaskhan is a particularly powerful normal type that may be worth getting a look at once you unlock the ability to get it in the post game. For Snorlax itself just make sure it has crunch to hit ghost types.  Replace Rayquaza with either Salamence, Garchomp, or Dragonite. Garchomp is my favorite, but Salamence would work just fine too. They're all a step down from Rayquaza, but hey what can you do?  Walls are somewhat less effective in the post game as you typically only have three pokemon to work with. Keeping Forretress would mean a third of your team could barely deal any damage at all. I'd suggest either Scizor or Ferrothorn as replacements. Both are good defenders with solid attacking prowess too. Forretress is kind of useless because entry hazards mean nothing when the computer doesn't switch and rapid spinning means nothing when the computer doesn't lay down entry hazards.  Aggron just doesn't have the bulk or special defense to make good use of its attack and sky high defense. Metagross does. Metagross also takes neutral fighting damage, a common weakness for your team. Lucario is also a solid option that adds some fighting to a team that needs it. If you keep Aggron I'd definitely make it mega evolve. Losing the 4x fighting and 4x ground weakness is vital to Aggron's survival.  Other good pokemon to look at would be Aegislash, Porygon Z, Mega Gengar, Mega Gardevoir, Tyranitar, Magnezone, Mega Blaziken, Sylveon, or Jolteon. Typing wise you are weak to fighting with only one resist and one neutral. Everything else looks ok. The post game content is pretty brutal, much harder than the regular game. Don't be surprised if you have to train a whole new team for it."

pokemonzetaomicron,31o03m,GreenishThumbs,3,Mon Apr 6 20:48:43 2015 UTC,I caught it as a Poliwag on Route 306 at lvl 17. With the lucky egg and the secret base gym leaders it doesn't take long to level it up. That will also allow you to level up your main team. Your rival is purposely designed to be worthless in this battle so you face 2 to 1 odds. The good news is with rain dance if his kingdra does come out it may be useful.
pokemonzetaomicron,31o03m,Vwhdfd,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:06:30 2015 UTC,Where can i get a lucky egg? I've seen people talking about it but i have no idea what it is. What does it do?
pokemonzetaomicron,31o03m,GreenishThumbs,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:35:25 2015 UTC,You can get the lucky egg in the Kariba Town Pokecenter. It causes the pokemon holding it to gain 1.5 times the experience. This can stack with boosted exp on traded pokemon to level up extremely quickly.

pokemonzetaomicron,31m5v7,Collagekid1024,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:57:25 2015 UTC,Almost never. The match up needs to be ridiculously one sided (like a pokemon with only psychic moves against a dark type) before the most intelligent AIs will change pokemon. Since most of the time the advanced AI's pokemon will have options that do regular damage the AI will almost never switch out.

In place of Charizard I'd go ahead and level up the Kadabra and evolve it; if it doesn't have a -Speed nature then it could be a very useful asset for picking off some of the faster threats.  Lastly, level up that Ferroseed. Ferrothorn's stats as well as its ungodly type combination makes it ridiculously useful when it comes to buying time to heal up the rest of the party. The only downside is that it won't be able to KO as quickly and as easily as the rest of the party, but you can work around that by switching it in and out frequently or giving it an Exp. Share.

pokemonzetaomicron,313nes,MrArcanine,3,Wed Apr 1 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"The reason I don't use Gyarados is that I use Gyarados too much. Almost every time I play through a pokemon game, I use the sweepiest pokemon I can find. Gyarados can't be earthquaked, and runs a crazy dragon dance. Problem is, he's a bit tedious, since he has weaknesses your flying type also has, and he doesn't learn a water move until Waterfall or Surf. Plus, most of the game you want him to know surf, but that move does nothing for him. So, yes, he's invaluable at the elite 4, but carrying him there is pretty arduous, especially if you're doing a nuzlocke.  I can see that for this game, most of the problems I list are nearly nonexistant. However, that doesn't erase my previous trouble with the pokemon. It just isn't that much fun for me to run a Gyarados, even though I know it's stronger than the leftovers Empoleon I'm running instead. Switching Empoleon into someone she can resist and then being an unbreakable wall until I want something sweepier is something more novel for me as a player, and I think a lot of pokemon zeta players, like me, will be at a point in their experience with pokemon where the childish 6 sweep team has been most of their experience, and now they're looking at something new.  Is Gyarados a strong pokemon which is often worth running with the objective of winning? Yes. Is he fun to run? That's subjective, but for a lot of people, no."
pokemonzetaomicron,313nes,Wulibo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:46:56 2015 UTC,"I think most people like Gyarados for playing through the regular game, dude hits hard after a dragon dance. People just dont use one much competitively because there are some very popular pokemon that can counter the shit out of him. (Ferrothorn, Rotom, Thundurus, Galvantula, etc)  Although anything with Moxie is worth at least trying"
pokemonzetaomicron,313nes,BloodyToothBrush,2,Wed Apr 1 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in the usual game you pretty much just need a Gyarados and a pokemon that is stron against the types Gyarados is weak against.

There's not much you need to know other than dive right in! Keep a walkthrough up for your first run if you need (there's a wiki with a walkthrough) and I'd recommend doing a regular run on your first play - leave the nuzlocke/solorun/pp challenge/randomizer etc. for next time. Prepare to lose a few weeks of your time playing through!   Check out /r/pokemonZOTrades if you need a pokemon and want to trade with someone."

I still have yet to get to the third gym leader (just because I'm lazy) but I have enjoyed every second of it. Some things I like about it are that it is the only fan game that wasn't designed solely to be as challenging as fuck (looking at you Dark Rising) but was made for being fun. There are three slightly different starters: Magby, Horsea, and Bellsprout, and all three have had their stats slightly changed in order to be on more of the same level. There are Secret Bases, which pretty much allow you to do anything you could possibly desire, such as a person who you can keep battling who has Audino, or trading with yourself. You can go past level 100, you can catch almost any Pokemon you could ever want, you can change your Pokemon's IVs and EVs (I think), so pretty much everything I ever wanted from a Pokemon game. It's fucking amazing, you should definitely try it.  EDIT: There are some more new features listed on the wiki"

Like what if Prankster Meowstic was focused on either Reflect or Light Screen and used Thunder Wave or some sort of Substitute based moveset? Just ideas.   Also, maybe say what the ability does? Prankster is a pretty easy one because it's so powerful, but I had to look up Competitive.   Edit#2: Please keep doing this though, even if its just for me! It gets the Pokejuices flowing!"

By that point, I already had a large selection of Dark types to choose from, such as Zorua, Murkrow, and Houndour, and they come earlier iirc. Especially after doing a couple of hours of research on the wiki, I didn't want to spend more time with choosing Pokemon. Sure, there were some I left out that I like, including Absol, but I had to not include them, because on a quick analysis, other Dark type Pokemon are more convenient and useful to me imo. So sorry if I didn't get a Pokemon that you wanted on the list.  Also, Absol was a big part of my Ruby team, so it felt like cheating to put it on another team."

pokemonzetaomicron,30r8ci,aleks7234,2,Mon Mar 30 00:54:57 2015 UTC,Thank you.
pokemonzetaomicron,30r8ci,welcome2thejam,2,Mon Mar 30 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"You can get a Cyndaquil through a secret base upgrade (although if you already picked your gen 2 starter, I'm not sure if you get another chance in Aroma). It's pretty difficult to get the egg move pokemon though. You either have to breed a Shiftry or catch the only Vulpix available in the region. And even then, you need to make sure your Cyndaquil is a female, since its gen 5 breeding rules - that also means Meowstic can't pass it down. So it's possible, but much more difficult than breeding in Aroma.  That said, there is a way to bring Vesryn pokemon over to Aroma before post-game. Before you go through Magmax Cave (after the second gym leader, IIRC), travel to Vesryn and put in the two pokemon you want to bring into the day care. Head back to Aroma and continue the storyline. Once you reach the secret base, you can pick your pokemon up in the daycare. However, this only works once since the Vesryn daycare closes immediately, and I'd advise you not to place them back in the daycare since you potentially may be unable to get them back out."

pokemonzetaomicron,30ltgz,EagleEye_,5,Sat Mar 28 15:31:40 2015 UTC,"First of all if you're not doing something like a Nuzlocke, then by the nature of the game as long as your team has some semblance of balance and type coverage, and you have the patience to grind in certain areas, you should really pick the pokemon YOU think are the coolest.  My favourite tools for deciding if my team is balanced and whatnot are Marriland's team builder and Serebii's type coverage chart. There are some minor flaws in both, but they're good enough for this vaguely Gen V game (which is how I'd describe how pokemon learn moves; it's like MOSTLY gen V but like...).  As for my opinion on which of those pokemon are particularly strong or useful, Shroomish, Gible, Heracross, Ferrothorn, and Dusclops are 5 I notice right away that I would run competitively, but that's just my opinion. Also, Ferrothorn's earlier evolution is available through headbutt in the first forest, and works as a great tank early if you don't mind the lack of real offence."
pokemonzetaomicron,30ltgz,Wulibo,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"That first part might be a little hard to do, seeing as most of these Pokemon are Pokemon I like/want to use.

pokemonzetaomicron,30iane,xeoros,2,Fri Mar 27 16:48:31 2015 UTC,You really like dark and ground moves. I personally like having psychic or thunderbolt for magmortar because he is a special attack type. I would prob throw ice beam instead of revenge on Samurott. Idk if smack down is fighting or not but I would get a fight move if not. a poison or stell move would be good for fairy as well
pokemonzetaomicron,30iane,DoctorDickDelaware,2,Fri Mar 27 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"You may not want to keep dark epitaph, since as an OHKO move it has very low accuracy, and if you aren’t at the same level as your opponent or higher, it is a complete waste of a move slot. Also, I’m not sure why you have nightmare if your Darkrai doesn’t have dark void to put anything to sleep. Get a better dark type move (maybe special) over faint attack too, since faint attack at this stage of the game isn’t powerful enough."

Magmortar: Go special all the way (change Rock Slide for Thunderbolt) Torterra: just relearn Leech Seed instead of Giga Drain. Samurott: If you have the Instant Lapras, take out Surf. Give it Ice Beam. Garchomp: Dragon Claw out, Fire Fang in. (Relearner) Darkrai: No Dark Epitaph (accuracy-wise)"
pokemonzetaomicron,30iane,myriadofelephants,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:24:47 2015 UTC,"Dragon Claw out, fire fang in   lol what  yup, remove a 100% accuracy 80 power stab move for an extremely shitty move that already has good coverage (that has 15 less power and 5% less accuracy, and it isnt even stab)"
pokemonzetaomicron,30iane,NemesisHellstorm,0,Fri Mar 27 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"As Garchomp has a very good Attack Stat, it WILL do good damage to Ice types."
pokemonzetaomicron,30iane,featherfooted,2,Fri Mar 27 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"DIg, crunch, dragon rush, dragon claw   And you picked Dragon Claw to replace with Fire Fang? That's probably the best of the 4 moves he listed.  I'd replace the whole set with Earthquake + Outrage + Fire Fang + Dragon Claw.  Outrage for when you need a nuclear weapon OHKO, Dragon Claw for when you need to choose your move carefully. Choice Band or Choice Scarf, either works great.  Another Gen 5 favorite for Garchomp is to forget the Choice item and do Swords Dance + Dragon Claw / Outrage + Earthquake + Fire Blast / Aqua Tail.  Boost up and proceed to wreck."
pokemonzetaomicron,30iane,myriadofelephants,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:40:19 2015 UTC,but why remove dragon claw? its literally the best stab move for garchomp (except maybe earthquake). the only move you should even think about replacing is dragon rush.

Sadly, ZO doesn't have many options to tweak for performance, so you can't improve things there.  All I can suggest is that you try killing background programs if they're running, or maybe look into upgrading your computer or getting a newer one."

pokemonzetaomicron,30b6so,Gengar16,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"It's an entirely new, slightly shorter region with four gyms and its own storyline that needs new pokemon, mainly because your Vesryn team will likely be at or near the level cap by the time you're finished with it.  You won't be able to bring any pokemon over to Aroma (unless you use the daycare trick, which only allows you to bring over two). However, once you finish the Aroma region, your PC boxes merge and you'll be able to use any region's pokemon at any time.  There's a ""peak"" at the end of each region, I suppose, and also a Battle Frontier style city once you reach the postgame."

But, most trade evos have no difference in their level up moves. I personally wait until around like level 36-ish, just to kind of give the feel like they're not trade evo's and I like to keep my party kind of balanced.

pokemonzetaomicron,3074mc,KanjyoHyuga,2,Wed Mar 25 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"First, nice job with the gengar. Second, I would recommend either replacing swampert (Less desirable) or infernape (Better to switch, since swampert is awesome) with a special attacker, as gengar is currently your only special attacker.  You could even switch out both. There are plenty of good special water and fire types out there. You could also theoretically switch out garchomp or something for a special nidoking. And keep in mind that (unless you are in the second region) you aren’t getting anything out of your starter with this team.  Also, hooray for gengar fans!"

pokemonzetaomicron,3074mc,NemesisHellstorm,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:31:46 2015 UTC,Only one special attacker may be very bad if you manage to battle a special defensive pokemon not called Chansey/Blissey.  I'd say: Switch Infernape or Luxray for another (Sp. Attacking) pokemon.
pokemonzetaomicron,3074mc,Gengar16,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:47:10 2015 UTC,Why would you want more special attackers against a special wall?
pokemonzetaomicron,3074mc,NemesisHellstorm,0,Fri Mar 27 10:59:40 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily more sp. atackers, but maybe a Toxic/Leech seed user."
pokemonzetaomicron,3074mc,Gengar16,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"No, you should have more than 1 special attacker."
pokemonzetaomicron,3074mc,5horts,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of replacements I could see for your team, but only Staraptor and Luxray. I think both those pokemon are too weak for Zeta/Omicron.  I had a Staraptor in my party for the Elite four and I didnt even use him. (except when I was getting sweeped) Luxray is weak statted (besides attack) and is the first I'd replace. Maybe find that sp. atker that has been suggested. Jolteon, Galvantula, Magnezone, uhhh jeez I know there are definitely way more than that. I can't think of any good replacements for Staraptor off the top of my head, but it is probably important to have Flying type STAB.    Gengar, Garchomp, Infernape, and Swampert all excel/ are good at what they do with the stats to do them with.   Make sure to make use of Infernapes equal attack + sp. atk stats, it can come in handy!   Check out http://www.smogon.com/dex/bw/pokemon/ for more info on stats and movesets (remember they are competitive, so more just potential than actually required. Always remember to experiment/do what your party needs!)   Edit: I linked to the XY dex, I think the BW dex is more accurate to Zeta."

Ability capsule wont work if a pokemon has only one standard ability. It also cant be used to change a pokemon's ability to its hidden ability.  To make a pokemon have its hidden ability, you need to use have a dream stone(can be bought in blackfist dept. store) and talk with the dream duchess in the centaur town.

pokemonzetaomicron,2zztar,joey_sandwich277,3,Mon Mar 23 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"In addition to those, keep in mind that all 3 starters have had their base stats altered, so they will be different from the ones on Bulbapedia. Victreebel is buffed, Kingdra is nerfed (but not nearly enough to be noticable outside of the metagame), and Margmortar is also nerfed. All 3 have altered movesets more fitting of a starter, none of them require stones/trades/etc. to evolve, and Marmortar is now Fire/Dark typed. Finally, the Pokemon your starter is super-effective against will be available for you to catch fairly early in the game (i.e. if you pick Horsea, Magby will be encounterable at that location)."
pokemonzetaomicron,2zztar,Wulibo,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:44:54 2015 UTC,"Will the encounter-able Magby be altered in the same way the starter magby is? I'd love a buffed-up bellsprout, but I'm not interested in a normal one."
pokemonzetaomicron,2zztar,joey_sandwich277,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:46:45 2015 UTC,I believe so. I chose Bellsprout as a starter and I remember my Horsea still had the option to learn Draco Meteor down the road. It's been a while since I played that save file though.

I've completed the three gyms, and it's a challenge, but the final gym battle, I beat directly after the second one, within an hour, so it's not too challenging once you realize the skill cap with the first gym.

I really like that it forced you to use a wider array of pokemon than the standard OP guys/ over levelled starter.  My only issue was that if you play speeded up on reborn, it can be laggy in some areas. Also while Zeta is easily just as big, it comes in a lot smaller 150MB vs well over 500MB."

Obsidian has some great fakemon and custom tiles, and the developer is one of ghe biggest guys in the scene. Legends of the Arena is reallh lacking in custom art, but it's story is great, as are its maps and it is executed so, so well. Reborn is fun, although its story is a bit too big and it gets very clustered. The custom field effects can be great, or terrible, depending on how hard you like your pokemon games. Insurgence is great too. I'd say all of them are better than Z/O, so I think you'll enjoy them."

What jirachi does is give new coverage to your team, while also having good stats all around. Overall, it is much stronger than any other pokemon, but it isn’t particularly good at any one thing.  Also, gengar is a choice I would reccomend. I’ve seen a lot of people use the Darkrai you can catch in midnight Mansion, and if you don’t mind having two fire types, chandelure is a real power house."

Moxie Krookodile is good for the eighth gym and can be found as a krokorok in mount press. Excadrill may not be as helpful, but is really powerful to begin with, and if it can get sand stream, that would help the eighth gym a lot too."

If I had to pick one Pokemon to be a danger to my team, it would be an Ice/Fire Fang Sharpedo. Galvantula would be a good enough counter. I don't know if the in-game Sharpedo's run Fire Fang, I've only seen them use Ice Fang. This could be Galvantula's chance at redemption! Never been a big fan of Electivire, anyways.

pokemonzetaomicron,2zc3kc,5horts,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"For example i tried to catch a Donophan. Got it to red health bar, put him to sleep, threw like 4 ultraballs, all of them failed...."
pokemonzetaomicron,2zc3kc,featherfooted,1 point,Thu Mar 19 08:15:17 2015 UTC,"Four ultra balls is quite a small sample size there.  Let's be conservative and assume worst case scenarios:   You're capturing a Donphan (catch rate 60 = 7.8%) It's already asleep You're in Route 314 (it's level 30-34) Its health bar is red (between 1-25%) You're throwing ultra balls   A level 34 Donphan at 25% health which is asleep has a 78% chance of being captured by an Ultra Ball. That's a 22% chance of missing every time, and you attempted four times in a row.  You had a 1.06% chance of missing all four Ultra Balls.  That's really not that unheard of. You don't start hitting ""unlucky"" numbers til you hit sub-1% probabilities and the odds are worse than, say, 1 in 1000.   For example, let's say the Donphan was level 30 and had 1% health remaining. Now it has a 93% chance to be captured by an Ultra Ball, which works out to .002% chance of missing all four Ultra Balls. That's a roughly 1 in 40,000 chance, so it would be considerably unlucky."

Each are freaking awesome stats wise. Check the Wiki for more info, theres a lot of extra stuff in the game that is easy to miss.   Just go to the... 4th floor? of the Blackfist department store. One of the four vendors has Life Orbs. They increase your poke's damage by 30% at the cost of 10% life per hit (the idea here being the extra 30% will usually OHKO/2HKO, so the life lost is overall less then taking more hits)   And there are three choice items,   Band(atk), Scarf(spd), and Specs(sp. atk). Each increases your pokes stat by 50% but they can only use one move on each switch in."
pokemonzetaomicron,2z6duv,welcome2thejam,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:11:48 2015 UTC,"Okay,  I think I follow. So a pokemon with really only 1 purpose/attack would use the choice items where as multi-purpose ones would use the orbs. Ok! I'll also take a look over the wiki trying to find a replacement for the dead horse lol"
pokemonzetaomicron,2z6duv,Gengar16,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"So a pokemon with really only 1 purpose/attack would use the choice items where as multi-purpose ones would use the orbs.   You're right on the money about Life Orb - it gives you more oomph without taking your versatility away (you can select any move at any time).  The point of Choice isn't about only using ""1 purpose/attack"" though. Once you're Choice-locked, you can only use the same move over and over until you switch out. Every fresh appearance can select a difference Choice move.  So consider moves that make you want to switch out afterwards anyways (Outrage's confusion, Leaf Storm's offensive stat drop, Close Combat's defensive stat drop) or pack a whallop into something that's going to wreck house anyway (Brave Bird).  Another common strategy is to pair a Choice item with something that lets you get the hell out of dodge if the matchup is poor. U-Turn is a good example. Lead off with a Choice pokemon, if the matchup is good, kill your opponent. If it's not, U-Turn away (and the U-Turn gets boosted by Choice Band)."
pokemonzetaomicron,2z6duv,Toasterfire,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"Rapidash is okay, but outside of fire-type moves, it doesn't really do much that the rest of your team can't handle. For a replacement, a special attacker could work.  If you want another fire-type, your best options are probably Chandelure (catchable as a Lampent in Midnight Mansion) or Rotom-Oven. If you picked Magmortar as your starter, it'd work too (you can also catch it in Fianga IIRC if you picked Horsea).  Otherwise, you could grab a electric or grass type to better handle water types. You can get fire-type moves back on your team through either Custom Move Fire on a physical attacker, or Dragonite getting Fire Punch through the move relearner."

Scroll to the bottom of the list and find the game you opened.  Select the game (for zeta/omicron it will be ""Game.exe"" with the game's icon next to the name) and click open.  Now check the box labeled ""Enable speedhack"" on the right side of the cheat engine window and a box will open next to that indicating the game's current speed. You can simply click in the box and change the number to whatever you like, but I suggest a max of 5 times the original speed because any faster and the game becomes too difficult to navigate.   P.S.: Every time you close and reopen the game you have to re-select the game in cheat engine and turn on the speedhack. Hope this helps you with tedious grinding."

Also, when you grind, your pokemon should be one hitting/ two hitting its enemies with minimal damage to itself.

pokemonzetaomicron,2yce9m,AyPay,7,Tue Mar 24 01:56:41 2015 UTC,I've been playing pokemon dangerously close to a twenty year mark and have played every handheld version. (Except for the Red Gyrados) I've never encountered a shiny :(
pokemonzetaomicron,2yce9m,somekid2120,4,Sun Mar 8 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"ONCE.  I played pokemon emerald, sapphire, ruby, firered, and leafgreen for 6 years and never once found a shiny. I started a new emerald game last year, trying to get back into pokemon, and after 5 elite four runs, I find a shiny poocheyena. After that, I soft reset for a shiny Rayquaza, but that's practically cheating."
pokemonzetaomicron,2yce9m,AyPay,2,Sun Mar 8 19:24:08 2015 UTC,I've gotten a bunch of shiny pokemon but I've also got a lot of free time and a lot of horny pokemon. I also got pokerus once but I didn't know what it was until years later.

pokemonzetaomicron,2yed25,BryLock,0,Mon Mar 9 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. Assuming you're using a real phone (android) get the app Limelight, and connect it to your Steam installation. Steam will consider your device to be a Shield screen, and send your game display to the mobile screen. Use whatever controller you like, I recommend a PS3 paddle for ease of connecting to your phone, or use onscreen buttons - it is still just Pokemon, not any kind of twitch game. Finally, add Zeta/Omicron to your Steam list as a local game. Start Limelight, touch the new button for Z/O, and start playing.  And don't listen to the haters in the subreddit who refuse to believe that mobile Z/O is possible. They are many and misinformed."

pokemonzetaomicron,2ydov0,Viniter,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:32:47 2015 UTC,It's working fine for me. Do you have any hold items? Because I know that there's a hold item that makes your 2 turn moves attack on first move.

pokemonzetaomicron,2y61eh,Andrew13112001,2,Fri Mar 6 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like the difference in experience points could be because of the gen 5+ mechanics, where a lower leveled pokemon earns more exp. than higher leveled ones.  And honestly, there's not really any better method other than the gym leader/lvl. 90 Audino trainer cycle. You could do the Developer's Challenge or do some Simulation Battles in the Depot to mix it up a bit, and when you get to Aroma, there's a Secret Base upgrade where I think you can buy Rare Candies IIRC, but for now there's no real get rich quick scheme to it."
pokemonzetaomicron,2y61eh,welcome2thejam,2,Fri Mar 6 20:13:49 2015 UTC,and what's up with the lucky egg though? A bug? It's not normal to get LESS exp when you're holding it.
pokemonzetaomicron,2y61eh,welcome2thejam,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I tested it out using a lvl. 85 Victreebel against a lvl. 90 Audino trainer. The first time was with Leftovers, then I immediately reset and did it with the Lucky Egg to avoid the experience points changing due to the aforementioned gen 5 mechanics. Both times, I knocked out two Audinos, then leveled up, and knocked out another Audino, so three KOs altogether.  The first time, with Leftovers, Victreebel earned experience point totals of 7360, 7360, and 7262.  The second time, with Lucky Egg, it earned experience point totals  of 11040, 11040, and 10893.  Both had identical experience point decreases of around .0133% upon gaining a level.  So the Lucky Egg probably isn't bugged, it just that the level of the pokemon matters a lot more in the experience point calculation, leading to the huge gap. Can I ask if you remember what level your pokemon was when it got that much normally, and then what it was when you tried it with the Lucky Egg? Or if it was facing the same pokemon both times?"

If you want a good Electric type, I'd suggest the Magnetilo line. Ponyta: I'm honestly not a fan of that one either, It's stats aren't that overwhelming and I'm not too keen on physical Fire types to begin with. Stravia: Very good Pokemon, especially once it evolves it can carry your team quite some way. Only in the endgame I tend to replace it, but only because I like Dragonite a lot. Seadra: Very good Pokemon as well, can be either a physical attacker with Waterfall+Dragon Dance+Outrage or a special attacker with Surf, Ice Beam and stuff. I personally prefer a physical build, partially because the Waterfall item comes rather late. Venusaur: It's a starter, you can't generally go too wrong with those (exception being Mehganium). Can function in a whole lot of roles, like special attacker or status setter."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xvrwj,funkymunniez,1 point,Thu Mar 5 12:19:15 2015 UTC,Ditch minun.  Terrible stat base and will get wrecked in the later game.  You'd be better off with a pikachu or a shinx if you want a pokemon that's only electric type.
pokemonzetaomicron,2xu6m9,somanydamndecisions,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly IMO, the most important types for a team are fire, water, and grass/electric. Right now you don't have any of those, but if that is how you roll, then you have a pretty balanced team. If you find a strong water, fire, or grass/electric type, then I would recommend switching Larvitar out for him. Tyranitar is a very strong pokemon, but his sandstorm-summoning would hurt three of your pokemon when they're fully evolved. Good luck with your randomizer! :P"
pokemonzetaomicron,2xu6m9,interstellarllama,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"You will definitely need a water type at some point, if only to get around pre-HM items. Hydreigon and Larvitar are the best candidates for replacement, since their dark types will overlap soon. Can't really name a definite choice to switch in though, since it's on randomizer."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xu6m9,welcome2thejam,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:11:20 2015 UTC,"Here is my updated team, thoughts?:  Gardevoir, Gengar, Hydreigon, Staraptor, Blazekin, Swampert  Thinking of switching out Blazekin for a different fire type, and Swampert for a different water type."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xu6m9,BloodyToothBrush,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:17:57 2015 UTC,"Swampert for a different water type.   I've always liked Swampert; Earthquake, Waterfall, Stone Edge, and Avalanche/Ice Punch(move tutor only, not sure if he can learn it in Z/O) is a nice set, especially with a Choice Band. And only having to worry about grass is nice.  But if you started with Horsea, Kingdra isnt a bad alternative. Another good typing, Surf, Icebeam/Flashcannon, signal beam, Dragon pulse. None of its stats are extraordinary, but well rounded at least"

(There might be a few more pros)  Cons: it might save after you accidentally kill a special encounter pokemon like a legendary or rotom (which is encounterable only twice for the 1st region).  Rarely, it might save when you are stuck in some glitch or bug and thus you might loose some progress when you restore your save to a previous version.   Personally I prefer using quick save to auto save."

pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,Andrew13112001,37,Sat Feb 28 11:09:49 2015 UTC,"I think both of the games have the same scripts, so maybe the game changes the name? Also, someone named a pokemon either Zeus or Odin and it showed up as the other name."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,Gengar16,8,Sat Feb 28 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"Somebody should test it with both from each pair in each game.  Probably an active replacement script, which is really strange.  Not sure why it would be there."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,Sigma_J,16,Sat Feb 28 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Maxie is in Omicron, and Archie is in Zeta. The game just checks for the word Maxie in text and changes it to Archie to translate to Zeta. Same happens with Odin/Zeus."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,deukhoofd,11,Sat Feb 28 23:09:14 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it's probably a case of using find and replace to switch out their names based on which version you have. In this case someone went a little overboard.
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,jordan042,6,Sat Feb 28 14:01:12 2015 UTC,"Not to give too much away, but much later in the storyline, there is a reference to Maxie or Archie, depending on the game version. Thus, there's code somewhere that switches the name for the other version, and it must not have taken into consideration the possibility of a player nicknaming their pokemon Maxie or Archie."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,dawidowmaka,12,Sat Feb 28 21:23:43 2015 UTC,Probably not a bug. Probably a reference to Maxie and Archie in ruby/sapphire (and or/as)
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,BlackCatJoker,15,Sat Feb 28 11:19:46 2015 UTC,"So that was on purpose? If you have someone named Maxie, it will say Archie?"
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,BlackCatJoker,4,Sat Feb 28 11:22:01 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess? Yes. Someone will have to confirm, but I'd wager on it."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,Brandonspikes,14,Sat Feb 28 11:49:10 2015 UTC,"No, It's a bug in how the game engine works."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,qhea__,-12,Sat Feb 28 15:30:16 2015 UTC,If it's a consistent thing then it's definitely an easter egg and not a bug. That's WAY too much of a coincidence (even the fact that it's a sequence of letters that form a readable word is too much of a coincidence) to just be a bug.
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,Oxirane,27,Sat Feb 28 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"When we say ""bug"", we mean the program is probably not acting as the programmer intended.   In this case, it's probably something like  if (game.version == OMICRON)     text = text.replace(""Maxie"", ""Archie""); //Replace the word ""Maxie"" with ""Archie"" DisplayToPlayer(text);   which was intended to replace instances of the name Maxie with Archie in spoken text (to recycle the script). However, it's not checking when it's replacing the text- it's just always doing it.   Thus the bug OP posted.  Software bugs are usually consistent. If they aren't that means you have a really bad bug which likely involves playing with memory you aren't supposed to be playing with."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,qhea__,2,Sat Feb 28 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"I was unaware that Maxie and Archie were in the game at all, really. I haven't played all the way through it.   I just kind of assumed it was in there as a joke."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,ziberoo,7,Sat Feb 28 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"(even the fact that it's a sequence of letters that form a readable word is too much of a coincidence)   I don't think you understand how bugs occur in code. They don't just randomly happen, with random effects."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xgba6,qhea__,2,Sat Feb 28 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Didn't realize Maxie and Archie were in the game.   And yes I understand bugs, thanks for asking. I just didn't know there would be any reason to have code in there switching the two names."

The first time I finished the game I need to level up both the shiny Gible and Aerodactyl from level one to a reasonable level. The second time I beat Miranda I actually planned out team to take her down with 3 overleved pokes - Magmortar, Flygon, and Tyranitar. I could've gone with Kingdra, but my Flygon has 252 evs in attack, 31 ivs in attack, and had jolly."
pokemonzetaomicron,2xihmq,8luze,2,Sun Mar 1 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I had so many tries. My team was 64-69 during the whole thing, and still lost like 12 times. Camerupt? Pfff, that's probabily the weakest of her squad. That Chandelure on the other hand..... That damn Moonblast kept wrecking my Kingdra. I mean seriously, not even the Mega Charizard was that hard. I had to try and take out the Chandelure with some other pokemon, cause I knew that if I would send Kingdra in, it would just get one-shotted. Finally did it last night."

Pokemon was always a in the go thing when I was a kid. I have a job and responsibilities now. So playing Pokémon all day isn't the top of my list.   Is this game even feasible for someone who does t have much time. Im thinking my free time is better spent.
pokemonzetaomicron,2xcz30,Callmedodge,5,Fri Feb 27 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"The game's a lot of fun, but it will take longer than the real pokemon games, and those already take some time.

pokemonzetaomicron,2x8urp,Andrew13112001,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:30:18 2015 UTC,"There are 3 ways to level up quickly.   In Fianga City there is a battle depot, its the large building with an orange roof. If you go in and go upstairs you can battle trainers you have the ID of, and you can buy trainer IDs in Caspian City card building.  You can rebattle gym leaders as much as you want from your secret base after you upgrade your secret base to the second level. To this, you have to purchase all upgrades from the first level and go and touch the purple stone in your base. Once you upgrade, you'll be able to purchase the gym leaders for ~ 4,000 and rebattle them whenever you want. They will appear randomly so if you want to battle a certain one, just buy that gym leader only, otherwise you will need to exit/re-enter base until that gym leader appears if you bought all of them. There's a cool trainer in your secret base that uses audinos in the battle. It will cost you 3,000 per 10 levels to battle him so it is expensive, but that gives really good experience.    Also, don't forget to give your pokemon either a lucky egg or experience share item to hold so that it gains experience faster."
pokemonzetaomicron,2x8urp,Gustkraken,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"Can't remember exactly what it said, but I remember talking to the girls upstairs and they said I couldn't or something. Does that include all thoose city names? (what is that even doing?) Bonus Question: Is there a way to get back to my base without going all the way back to Agassiz Town? Is there a shortcut kinda like in Insurgece with the bookcases in the Pokemon Center?"
pokemonzetaomicron,2x8urp,Gustkraken,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:07:02 2015 UTC,"http://pokemonzetaomicron.wikia.com/wiki/HM_Items  Secret power is the TM that you need to use to access your secret base from any major city by interacting with the large stone/white towers that you see. Once you upgrade to level 2 you will be able to get the skeleton key which works like secret power so that you dont need to have a pokemon with secret power to access the secret base.  To battle in the simulation depot building you have to get IDs of other players first, you likely don't have any if they said you couldn't. You can buy IDs from the card building in Caspian City where the last gym is located once you reach it. Re-battling gym leaders however is likely easier, and the gym leaders will be using slightly higher lvl pokemon when you first fought them so you will get more experience."
pokemonzetaomicron,2x8urp,Gustkraken,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:16:08 2015 UTC,"I recently traded with someone, so I guess I have at least 1 ID right now. How much do they cost? Oh, that's fine, since I only have 4 pokemons so far(till I get the elite four), so I can easily get a Secret Power slave."
pokemonzetaomicron,2x8urp,Gustkraken,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"IDs are not other player IDs but NPC IDs, so computer trainers. The cost is anywhere between 1,000 to 10,000. All the gym leaders cost only 4,000 and you only need to pay once and you can battle them whenever."
pokemonzetaomicron,2x8urp,Gustkraken,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"Also, in order to level up to level 2 Secret-Base, do I have to buy literaly everything, or are thoose cities(which I don't know what they do) optional?"
pokemonzetaomicron,2x8urp,welcome2thejam,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"You have to buy everything that you can buy from the upgrade store. The cities are what allow you access your secret base from the rock/white stone towers in those cities. If you don't buy it you can't use secret power on the towers and enter your base. You also need to buy the upgrades to level up your base, and it will unlock new upgrades as well."

I would save before doing this so that you do not make the Rotom faint, I'm not sure if it will respawn or not if it does, but Rotom is by far a superior electric type to pikachu, raichu, and helioptile. As a side note, rotom will be at lvl 10 so you may need to get some weaker pokemon so you can lower its health without defeating it in the battle.   Edit: also in addition, once you capture rotom, if you put him as the lead of your party and go to interact with the same TV in that house, it will allow you change rotom's form to whichever one you want."

pokemonzetaomicron,2x4sjw,ShitsNGigglesdTB,5,Thu Feb 26 03:16:40 2015 UTC,"In competitive usually if one poke has slightly more bulk but less speed and offense power, the bulkier is usually not passed up. More specificly how the two fair against what you plan to use them against is important. Will you one shot a bulky gyarados? Can you one hundred percent two shot it? If you can two shot it with both, but not one shot, the extra attack power doesn't seem to help too much. If one can one shot and the other can't, why use the one who two shots? Sometimes you can one shot but can't strike first. In this case gyarados won't outspeed pikachu usually but what if u miss, or switch out or whatever. Can you survive gyarados using earthquake? A more speed and offense one can get you? Can a bulky one get you both one shot? If raichu can't survive then the extra bulk is useless.   But this is about what you consider it going against. Scizor has decent bulk from stats and steel typing, so even though it's primarily a sweeper that doesn't mean being able to stay alive isn't appreciated. Electric types have very few types that resist them and barely have any weaknesses, but earthquake is 100 power and 100 accuracy so anyone that uses physical attacks doesn't mind throwing earthquake into the mix. Because of this bulky electricity doesn't typically work."

Grinding against the gym leaders in the Secret Base is a great way to build up experience quick, and you can always purchase the trainer that uses a team of Audinos, though his battles are a tad on the expensive side (3k per 10 levels, yikes!)."

Press, the outside area immediately after the first nurse (the one after the waterfalls) has patches of grass with lvl. 40 Audinos. It'll take a bit longer to level than the secret base trainers obviously, but it's free and the nurse is available for quick healing.  Mount Press isn't exceptionally hard, although the major story battles may give you trouble.

pokemonzetaomicron,2wqjkl,gitts411,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:58:16 2015 UTC,"In theory, it should work, even with the funky mechanics. IIRC, technically it doesn't matter what pokemon you use to teach an egg move, provided they are in a compatible egg group with the mother. For example I got a Weavile with Ice Punch in Vesyrn by getting a Smeargle and having it sketch the move. Swampert could learn Avalanche via egg move in the past, the only problem was that the only pokemon who could breed with Swampert that knew Avalanche only learned it via the TM, which was later removed from the TM list. If you transferred over a pokemon from Gen IV in one of Swampert's egg groups that learned Avalance, you could breed it onto Mudkip.  So theoretically, if Avalugg is in the Monster egg group then it should be able to breed with Swmpert and therefore be able to pass on Avalanche via egg move. In this particular game, I don't know how the specifics of how the Gen VI pokemon were implemented, and how this impacts breeding."

As far as metagame analysis goes (IE which Pokemon are good in player vs player and more importantly why) there's a variety of options.   If you want to play in-game Single battles, you should use a combo of Smogon's builds and Nintendo's banlist (because it reflects the in game banlists), keeping in mind that you only pick 3. If you want to go to IRL Pokemon competitions sponsored by Nintendo, the standard ruleset is 4 Pokemon doubles, and I believe Nugget Bridge will have the most active community. And if you want to be able to play some now Smogon's online simulator, Pokemon Showdown, is your best option. Smogon has a bunch of formats (including weird ones based around hacks, like STABmons, where Pokemon have access to all of the moves from their types), but you can learn about most of them on Smogon itself."
pokemonzetaomicron,2wp3d1,Pegthaniel,1 point,Sun Feb 22 08:31:20 2015 UTC,I would say Gengar may be the better of the two although I think Alakazam's design may be a tad cooler.

But if you're not too attached to it, it's pretty replaceable. Outside of Ice Beam, the rest of your pokemon have things covered, and even then, there's ways to get ice attacks on your team (Custom Move Ice, Gyarados can relearn Ice Fang, etc.).  For the other open spots, Gardevoir's fine, it's definitely one of the top special attackers for Vesryn. Rotom's always a pretty good suggestion, probably either grass or fire form for this team. Houndoom also might work, although it's usefulness in Z/O peaked before the E4."

pokemonzetaomicron,2wm5sl,Gustkraken,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"If you want the water stab, that's probably the best way to go. Swampert is also slow which benefits avalanche which will double in power if user goes second. I personally never liked taking a water-type move on swampert mainly because my movepool on swampert is Earthquake (covers fire, rock), Avalanche (covers ground), and Hammer Arm (for more coverage). The last move is either for more type coverage or stat boosting move, mainly curse since it boosts atk and defense (similar to bulk up) and reduces speed. Since swampert has low speed anyway, the speed drop doesn't really matter. And if you look at the water-type moves, they are only super effective against Ground, Rock, and Fire types, all of which are covered by Earthquake and Avalanche alone.   Edit: I also noticed you don't have swords dance on your Hawlucha, it's very useful to set it up as a sweeper since Hawlucha has such high speed. Also you can consider taking Acrobatics. If you have it so Hawlucha is not holding any items, acrobatics will double in power to 110 and get the stab bonus too."

One thing I will say: why take low kick and flare blitz on Blaziken and not high jump kick and blaze kick? Flare blitz does recoil and Blaziken is already pretty fragile as it is. I would also consider using Greninja as scout/lead with U-turn instead of Magnezone with volt switch (if thats why you gave it volt switch) since Greninja has much better speed. Also, maybe consider a hone claws and dragon rush instead of draco meteor and fire blast on your Garchomp?"

pokemonzetaomicron,2wl1gi,Gengar16,2,Sat Feb 21 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"I would reccomend trading with someone to get the greninja, because it won’t be available until after the E4. You should definitely go with a physical set for garchomp, and replace draco meteor/fire blast with a stat boosting move, like swords dance/dragon claw, and a physical dragon type move.   For yanmega, I would aim for a speed boost one since tinted lens only  powers up ineffective moves, and, especially late game where you can’t really win through levels, you really need supereffective moves to win.   Like Gustkraken said, magnezone probably isn’t your best choice for a volt switcher, and sturdy might be a better ability (You can switch it with an ability capsule). Because it is slow, you want to get at least one attack in and be able to survive an earthquake. You could also give it an air balloon, but you don’t need to.  With blacken, take Gustkraken’s suggestions.  With greninja, that’s pretty good. You could try to use a ™ for a different move.  Gengar might benefit from a better move. Also, if you aren’t doing a nuxlocke, you will not be able to get sludge wave for a long time. It also might benefit from shadow ball instead of taunt, but I don’t really know."

They're literally like trainers from the official games, which is strange because every other trainer in the game is miles above the official ones. At least that's how it was for my first 30ish battles, I just stopped after that because it was no fun and I haven't lost or even come close once."

pokemonzetaomicron,2wh1wm,LimblessNick,0,Sun Feb 22 00:20:58 2015 UTC,That's too bad. I've noticed that the trainer AI is still pretty poor (how hard can it be to write?) and the levels are higher than in the official games but not high enough to really challenge me... and this is while using crap like Magby and Shroomish.

pokemonzetaomicron,2whrqc,Gustkraken,2,Fri Feb 20 02:55:29 2015 UTC,What colors are you thinking? I'd be fine with doing a couple versions so you can decide which one you like best
pokemonzetaomicron,2whrqc,Gustkraken,2,Fri Feb 20 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe a deep/dark purple color instead of the orange and a crimson red for the blue? Or a dark grey/black for the orange with crimson red for the blue. I think both of those would look pretty good together. The purple would have to be a sort of blue-purple kinda color than just pure purple, something like the underside of Braviary's wings maybe but a little darker.  Edit: Also, not sure if this has been done or not, but how about a chandelure theme for infernape? Similar kind of purplish flame and replacing the dull orange on body and the red eyebrows with a similar dull blue and perhaps a brighter/deeper blue for the eyebrows so there's some contrast between the flame and body color? That would pretty cool :)"

pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,callienoel7,5,Fri Feb 20 00:33:33 2015 UTC,"earthquake and surf are amazingly good for the 8th gym. teach earthquake to whoever can learn it (i think you can get it in the blackfist store, and in the secret base pokeball) and you should win. you should replace twister and aqua tail on dragonite (maybe with outrage and thunderpunch)"
pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,myriadofelephants,5,Fri Feb 20 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"I would change the Kingdra to a Gyarados since you should be able to pick up a mega stone for Gyarados with just surf and waterfall. It should be a big improvement over your Kingdra.  Your pokemon have a lot of moves with the same typing, you dont need flamethrower and inferno on Charizard, just 1 will do, flamethrower has better accuracy i believe. Replace the other for better coverage. Same thing with fly and wing attack, you don't need 2 flying-type moves. I would actually suggest getting air slash since it can cause flinching. Add an earthquake to your charizard if you have the TM, if not you should be able to find one in your secret base. Venusaur doesn't need 3 grass type moves, get rid of 2 of them, i would actually add sleep powder which is a good status move and will help you catch pokemon too. Also you dont need to give your pokemon HM moves, the game has HM items that you can use which function like HM moves, as an example theres a machete that does the same thing as cut, theres also a pick axe or something like that which does the same thing as rock smash. There are rocket boots so you can fly anywhere you need to and theres an instant lapras item that works as surf. Kadabra doesn't need psychic, psycho cut, psybeam, and psyshock. That is a horrible moveset since its only using one type, psychic. Just get one psychic type move and put something useful to cover other types of pokemon. Also you have no bulky pokemon on your team, i would actually suggest replacing your Kadabra for something more bulky since you already have a psychic type with Victini. For victini, use the move relearner (i believe he is in some house in Treader Town) and have it relearn Searing Shot instead of Inferno. Inferno is terrible with 50% accuracy, even with victory star ability, and Searing Shot is 100 power/100 accuracy. Also you dont need flame burst, only need 1 fire type move for stab, use other types of move for better ability/coverage, for example you could give it quick attack since it has priority and can take out pokemon that have only a sliver of health left. Or teach it thunderbolt to cover water types (Blackfist City has a lot of TMs you can buy in the department store) Again, you don't need 2 of the same type of moves. Why take Twister and Dragon Rush when both are dragon-type? Further more if you're using dragon dance, it will only boost your physical atk, not special atk so twister is rather useless. In addition, although dragon rush has 100 power, it has low accuracy, using dragon claw or outrage will add a lot more consistency. One of the cities, i forget which, has a person that can delete moves, you can use that to get rid of the HM moves since those are pretty useless in battles. Be sure to pick up the HM items first so you dont need to use the HM moves like surf/cut/rock smash, etc first."

pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,Gustkraken,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:16:59 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of Aegislash so i would always suggest having one on your team, again, wouldn't be of much use on this gym battle because Aegislash is weak to fire type moves, but Aegislash is one of the strongest pokemon you can get. Since omicron/zeta uses gen 5 mechanics, steel still resists dark/ghost so it only takes neutral damage from those types and has only 2 weaknesses, fire and ground. What you could really use however something like Skarmony with spikes + stealth rock, works great as a lead to set up stealth rock and spikes so all pokemon your opponent switches in take damage. Either of those would be great for your team.   As a side note, you cant get an aegislash until you reach the Aroma region unless you trade for one. I can breed you one if you'd like one, up to you though."
pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,Gustkraken,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:22:55 2015 UTC,i would be totally up for that. I really dont have anything nice to offer though.
pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,Gustkraken,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"I don't need anything, theres actually a ditto you can capture early in the game to help you breed pokemon. It is also in Fianga City at the labaratory in the north-west corner, if you go upstairs and talk to the scientist closest to the long tube like thing at the top of the screen he will ask if you want mew DNA and then it will escape and you will have a battle with ditto. I would save before doing this so you dont make it faint, and also may be a good idea to use a lead thats weak/not powerful so its easy to capture and wont do a lot of damage.   If you can get on the ##ZOtrades IRC channel, do that and i can trade you honedge, you can just give any random pokemon, doesn't matter to me. If you can't get on ##ZOtrades, you should be able to get on the general IRC channel for omicron/zeta. Let me know."

pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,Gustkraken,2,Fri Feb 20 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"You have a kingdra which fire only does 1/4 to. I'd suggest changing its moveset because three water moves is just too much for that one pokemon. But it should be a good tank.  Besides that, go to the general store and buy some items. Stone edge and dig can be helpful. If you don't have earthquake of course.  Also for kadabra to evolve, upgrade the pokegear and you can evolve him manually by clicking trade option on gear. It allows you to evolve pokemon that need to be traded just like that.  Also you're severely under leveled like some mentioned. Buy the gym leaders for your base and battle them to level up. It is best way and it is free, with over 5000 in prize money after each victory."

pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,Gustkraken,2,Fri Feb 20 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you've noticed, but you are vastly underleveled for the 8th gym. You're going to want all your pokemon around level 70, and in my opinion, the best place to train is against the gym leaders in your secret base. Once you buy them, you can battle them over and over for free, and if you give your pokemon the lucky egg they'll level up in no time.  As far as your team goes:   Charizard - normal chars are specially based, so try to give him some extra coverage in the special department with perhaps air slash. It can be relearned for a heart scale from the move relearner. Venusaur - I know you won't use him much in the gym battle, but a poison move would help his coverage. If you picked up the machete in the town with the rock gym you have no need for cut, so getting rid of it would be preferred. Kadabra - might want to set up a trade to evolve him, although I'm not sure it's possible early game. Go to Blackfist Mall and buy him some special tms: thunderbolt, shadow ball, grass knot, and dazzling gleam once you get it would be good for him. Get rid of psycho cut since it is physical. Kingdra - looks alright, but get rid of brine for rain dance, I'll explain later Victini - don't know much about this fella, sorry :P Dragonite - this guy should learn outrage id you level him to 67, replace twister with that, and replace dragon rush with earthquake if you got that tm from your secret base (soft reset if front of the pokeball once you buy it until you get it, it's worth it)   Sorry for the wall of text, I'll post gym battle strategy below.  EDIT (formatting)"
pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,Andarnio,2,Fri Feb 20 01:01:56 2015 UTC,"The sun is often what contributes to the difficulty of this gym, so start out with Kingdra and use rain dance (give him a damp rock if you have one to increase the number of turns rain is active) You'll have to reset the rain after Charizard-Y is sent out because of its drought ability.  I would then switch out to dragonite and start setting up dragon dance. Scratch what I said about outrage, and use another physical dragon move if you have one. After a few dances start earthquaking/aqua tailing/dragoning everything. Don't worry too much about Jake's pokemon, they're just fodder anyway. Send out kingdra if you get KOed early.  When Charizard-Y comes out switch back to Kingdra for the rain and try to take out the rest with him. I'm sure there are other good strategies for this gym, and I apologize if I missed anything."
pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,abruce123412,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"That's pretty good advice. I didn't really bother using rain dance since i had Gyarados which resisted fire moves anyway, but if you set up dragon dances you should be able to one hit KO all of the fire type pokemon. You actually don't need to switch in Kingdra for charizard-Y because with dragon dance you'll have the +atk and +spd stage boosts so all you need to do is use aqua tail and it is guaranteed to defeat charizard with one hit as long as you have 2-3 dragon dance set up."
pokemonzetaomicron,2whrtb,tomackze,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing with gyarados, but you're right about not switching out, I hadn't thought of that. I get too stuck on thinking weather is the bane of any move whose power is decreased by it."
pokemonzetaomicron,2whbl0,tomackze,4,Thu Feb 19 22:28:00 2015 UTC,"Lucario is honestly one of my favorite pokes, but if you have the patience Skarmory is great too. The only problem is its 2% encounter rate. Zoroark is also fun to use,but I'm not sure if Illusion has any affect on NPCs."

A lot of pokemon have a unique feel, whereas others have been a complete disappointment. I personally was surprised at some I fell for.  For example, when I was a kid it was rare candy plus charge moves and screw potions. Now, I like ones that are extremely unbalanced and require strategy. I'm a huge fan of delta snorlax, toxicroak, chandelure and walrein. a lot of it is based on balancing walls and sweepers. I dont like OP pokemon and much prefer to methodically tweak my time. I think the ganes capacity for tailoring abilities and really fine honing your team is what really turned me ob to the gane. TBH I made two teams- an alpha an beta with subs- before I took on the E4.  Aroma made it even more interesting because the less opportunistic exp and different selection made team building quite unique. Mega sceptile with contrary is a dream come true and mega steelix is fun with foundry. overall, I like testing the waters to tweak unique type combos."

You'd want something along the lines of Swords Dance, Flying Press, Acrobatics (if you don't give it an item to hold, power doubles to 110 and stab bonus), and perhaps a type coverage move, Custom Move Ghost would work well. The main idea is that swords dance sets Hawlucha up as a sweeper."

pokemonzetaomicron,2whbl0,Gengar16,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"I don't personally use him on my team, but he can be useful in main team if you do not have any other flying or fighting type pokemon. I like using gliscor more because he is a bit bulkier and can take more hits than hawlucha.  Edit: If you want to make Hawlucha more durable so it doesn't die as fast, I would suggest taking Drain Punch over Flying Press. The idea is that you get a 2 stage atk boost from swords dance and when you use drain punch, you also get stab bonus and will be able to recover your HP effectively as long as opponents pokemon is not resistant to fighting type moves. This works better than roost because roost essentially wastes a turn, so even if you heal all the damage you took from the previous turn, your opponent can still be attacking, so the net result ends up being more or less neutral. However, move tutors are only in the Aroma region so you won't be able to teach it drain punch until after the elite 4."

pokemonzetaomicron,2wgjuj,yoooyoooyooo,3,Thu Feb 19 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"You do not want any speed on Aegislash. The best Aegislash, in my opinion, is Brave nature for +atk -spd. The reason for this is that in its defense form it has 150/150 base defense/special defense. The benefit with having low speed is that you move after your opponent so when your opponent attacks, you have an incredibly huge bulk and will take very little damage, that way when you attack and switch to attack form, you'll get 150/150 base attack/special attack.  My suggestion is to EV train your Aegislash in HP and atk, so 252 HP and 252 atk if you're going with a physical moveset. Give it Swords Dance, King's Shield, Sacred Sword, and then either Shadow Claw or Shadow Sneak. Aegislash is so powerful that with leftovers you should be able to easily set up 3 swords dance for 6 stage attack boost and then proceed to sweeping your opponent."

With brave nature (+atk) and 252 EVs in atk, its atk goes to 438 in blade form as opposed to 336 without the EVs and +atk nature. These are some of the stats for Aegislash at level 100, but in Omicron/Zeta pokemon levels cap off at lvl 120. All those numbers also with 31 IVs in both atk and hp.  Edit: Misread the question, my Aegislash is lvl 75 with 227 HP."
pokemonzetaomicron,2wgjuj,kjata30,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly I like special attack Aegislash better. It has the stats to pull it off and Shadow Ball / Flash Cannon are two huge STAB moves.  Check out the Smogon build (I prefer Shadow Sneak over Sacred Sword, but whatever) http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/aegislash"
pokemonzetaomicron,2wgjuj,Gustkraken,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"The only reason special attack Aegislash is bad (in my opinion) is due to its lack of Nasty Plot or some other way to boost up its special attack stage. In addition, a fighting + ghost move type coverage hits for normal or super effective damage on all pokemon. Conversely, a steel + ghost combo will not. (Note in gen 6 theres only 15 pokemon that steel + ghost doesn't cover, but since Omicron/Zeta uses gen 5 mechanics, that number is likely higher and closer to/around 45 pokemon that you will hit for not very effective damage)."
pokemonzetaomicron,2wgjuj,kjata30,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"All valid points, but generally speaking you're going to have the best success with a Pokemon when you use it effectively in a way that is not expected in your current meta. Everyone uses physical Aegislash, so everyone will have some idea of what to expect from yours.  Obviously the more people take this advice the less effective it becomes, but for now special attack Aegislash is the way to go."
pokemonzetaomicron,2wgjuj,Gustkraken,1 point,Mon Feb 23 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree? Swords dance is too good to pass up on Aegislash. So what if people know you're using a physical moveset, 2 stage boost atk on Aegislash with 150 base atk while in sword form is not something that can be brushed aside, even by physical walls."

One thing you could try is to completely reinstall the game by deleting the folder containing the game files and extracting a new copy. You may need to also find the folder containing your save files, back up the save files, delete the folder, and when you launch the game again after reinstalling, a new save game folder should be generated and you can then place your saved game files in that folder and see if it connects you then."

pokemonzetaomicron,2wcfl0,Narutophanfan1,2,Wed Feb 18 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"Toughy. My advice would have been not to try, but I suppose all things are possible. You're going to need a lot of luck, effort and super potions.   Get him up to lvl 28 and teach him Thrash. By that stage he should be pretty powerful anyway. Go wild with Bite/Rock Slide and hope to get lots of flinching. Amp up his attack stat by any way possible and use Brick Break. Reconsider your solo run.   Honestly, the last option is probably the best. For a solo run you need speed and type advantages. Tyranitar is amazing in terms of bulk and raw power, but is way too slow to be a solo."
pokemonzetaomicron,2wcfl0,TheoHooke,2,Wed Feb 18 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"Well actually, with Aegislash you can pretty effectively do a solo run without any speed :P"
pokemonzetaomicron,2wcfl0,Gustkraken,2,Wed Feb 18 21:31:54 2015 UTC,"True, but Aegislash has the advantage of being essentially two pokemon with the same moveset. Additionally, he only has two weaknesses in Z/O, since Steel resists ghost and dark."

Here's the team I've had the most succes with:  Mega Typhlosion (Lead), Aegislash, Salamence I've also had great succes with Mega Feraligatr and Mega Bisharp, Salamence, Cloyster, Greninja and Volcarona as the leading Pokemon. However the slot for the leading Pokemon is very flexible. One thing you'll notice is that Aegislash is pretty much always in a team comp. And as for the third slot I recommend a Dragon such as Salamence (Moxie), Mega Garchomp or Dragonite. Make sure your Pokemon are EV trained. Having the right nature is an extra bonus. I suggest you try starting out with Metagross (Lead; Nature: Jolly; Ev's: 255 Attack, 255 Speed; Item: Life Orb; Moves: Agility, Meteor Mash, Earthquake, Zen Headbutt), Aegislash (see screenshot above), Dragonite (Nature: Adamant; EV's: 255 Attack, 255 Speed; Item: Lum Berry; Moves: Dragon Dance, Outrage, Extreme Speed, Earthquake) Have fun and good luck ;)"

Effort values are a way of getting extra stats in a certain stat. For every 4 Effort Points, or Effort Values (EV's), you will gain +1 in that particular stat.   IVs are values the pokemon are born with, but thankfully you don't need to worry too much about what it does, only that you want to get as many IV stones as possible, go to Superior City, and set your Pokemon's IV to 31"
pokemonzetaomicron,2vxnn3,h3LLf1ght3r,1 point,Mon Feb 16 03:29:30 2015 UTC,"Check this out: http://pokemonzetaomicron.wikia.com/wiki/EV_Training_Spots      Summary: Inside your Secret Base you can give certain Pokemon into the daycare and battle them. Defeating them yields a reward of 2 (4 if your Pokemon is holding the corresponding item from the Blackfist Department Store; or 12 if your Pokemon also has the PokeRus virus) Ev's to the Pokemon being first (or all Pokemon in your team if you enable Exp Share 2, which you can get in Phoenix Iota). The maximum amount of EV of a stat is 255. So before you start you need to make sure your Pokemon has 0 EV in the stats it doesnt need. This is also possible to do in the Secret Base. Unlock the EV-Resetter and she will be upstairs to resett EV's for free. Save beforehand so you don't resett the wrong EV. You can and must also raise your Pokemon IV's to 31. This is also done upstairs in the Secret Base by talking to a guy. He want's an IV Stone in return, which you can either buy for 10.000 Poké or win  in Phoenix Iota challenges (the easiest being your own Gym battles)."

pokemonzetaomicron,2vo45d,bitbytebeep,2,Thu Feb 12 19:10:52 2015 UTC,"Cater your pokemon to their strengths.   -Gyarados has a very high Attack stat and a low Special Attack stat. I'd lose Surf and Dive to replace with Rock Slide/Earthquake and Dragon Dance (if there's a tutor available, I haven't played past the opening)  -Darkrai: Low Attack, High SA. Lose Shadow Claw for something like Psychic, or another move that isn't Ghost or Dark.   -Gengar: Consider choosing between Gengar and Darkrai, because they both serve the same purpose and their typing is very similar. Try using a ""Stall"" type Pokemon, or get coverage on something like Grass, Fire, Fighting, or Flying.  -Landorus: Looks OK, but since you have Swords Dance you should really cater him more to Attack. Ditch Earth Power for a Flying move, or ditch Swords Dance for another Special Attack move.  -Ditto: This is your worst pick, IMO. Considering his level with the rest of your team, I'd seriously think about swapping him with someone else to get better coverage.   -Jirachi: Looks ok.  In general, you have a lot of mixed attackers that have the same role where you should try using different kinds of Pokemon that specialize at one thing. This is how competitive teams work and they typically wipe the floor with in game teams. Best of luck!"
pokemonzetaomicron,2vlwbv,shadowreper,9,Thu Feb 12 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"The man says one of four things, depending on the Pokémon you have in the Day-Care.   If they're the same species (a male Vaporeon and a female Vaporeon, for instance) with different original trainers (you got one of them in a trade), he'll say that they get along very well. Every 256 steps you take, there is a 70% chance that they'll produce an egg. If they're the same species with the same original trainer (you caught them both yourself), OR if they're different species (Vaporeon and Ditto) with different original trainers, the man will say they seem to get along. Every 256 steps, they'll have a 50% chance of producing an egg. If they're different species (Vaporeon and Ditto) with the same original trainer (you caught them both), he'll say they don't like each other much. Every 256 steps you take, they'll only have a 20% chance of producing an egg. If they can't produce eggs at all (one is a legendary or baby Pokémon, or they're the same gender, or they don't share an egg group), the man will say they prefer to play with other Pokémon rather than with each other.   TL;DR – You can't make them more friendly toward each other, but they will produce eggs eventually. Ride your bike around to get 256 steps as quickly as possible."

pokemonzetaomicron,2vopi0,bye_proxy,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:41:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say Garchomp, Scizor, Magmortar, Staraptor, and Darkrai are worth using. I'd add a Gyrados in for a water type. If you have time I'd replace the Magmortar with Blaziken from the secret base. Lucario could be subbed in for Scizor too, if you want. If you want to break the game's difficulty in half, do the police club missions and catch the legendary at the end of it. Swap it in for Darkrai and wreck some skulls.  Garchomp should swap fire fang for dragon rage. Scizor should dump false swipe for night slash and Staraptor should sub u-turn for giga impact. Magmortar needs to dump everything but dark pulse and pick up thunderbolt, flamethrower, and psychic. Lucario needs to decide if he's going to be special or physical. Special Lucario should pack aura sphere, calm mind, dragon pulse, and either shadow ball or psychic. Physical Lucario should run close combat, sword's dance, earthquake, and extremespeed."

But i should switch bone rush for earthquake, that just makes more sense.  I would rather not sub Magmortar (he is my starter after all), and not use legendary pokemon, if possible, but i will think about your advice.  I was already thinking about a replacement for dragon rage. Both you and /u/bye_proxy recommended going for different moves. I guess i have to think about what types will i be missing/weaker.  Your U-turn suggestion seems very good. Having him in front and switching him out if his type isn't ideal. Just one thing, can i choose the next pokemon, or a random one comes out?

You could give it a soothe bell which enables happiness to increase faster. Walk around with it a lot, or win battles. IIRC loosing battles and using healing bitter items actually decrease happiness (not 100% sure about it)  you can also feed it ev reducing berries(which increase happiness while reducing evs) from blackfist dept store iirc and then level up.  Levels of happiness can be determined by interacting with the pokemon when it's the 1st in your party  Less than 50 is ""hates travelling""  50-100 is ""undecided""  100-150 is ""is happy traveling""  150-200 is ""loves travelling""  200+ is ""loves nothing more than travelling""  afaik, most pokemon that level up through high friendship/happiness require 200+"

All of your pokemon are underleveled for this fight, level 70 is just about the bare minimum, given how worthless Jake is. A good place to level is the Simulation Depot, though you may have trouble at first, all the pokemon are fairly high level. Get the Gyradosite for Gyrados so you can mega evolve yourself. Waterfall is a better move for Gyrados than surf and it helps to keep Jake's pokemon alive as bait instead of knocking them out with collateral damage. A Salamence or Dragonite could be pretty useful as both resist fire and most of the other moves her team has. If so, watch out for Chandelure's moonblast. A solid rock type could help out too, like Tyranitar or Aerodactyl(mega).  I'd lead with Darkrai, put them to sleep with dark void, then rain dance. When Darkrai falls send in Gyrados, dragon dance and mega evolve. Try to kill as of her pokemon with waterfall as you can. When Jake's pokemon go down you can feel free to earthquake and surf at will. Watch out for her Charizard, it'll bring back the sun when it mega evolves. One of her pokemon is double weak to water and two are double weak to rock, so if you can teach a pokemon rock slide that could be useful (perhaps Magmortar if you don't want to raise a rock type)."

pokemonzetaomicron,2v4jbd,LockonZero,2,Sat Feb 7 21:04:29 2015 UTC,"Their stats are all equaled so ignore that aspect. IMO it's Bellsprout. It learns Spore and Leaf Blade by level and can learn Swords Dance by TM. Spore+ Swords Dance+Leaf Blade is very strong combo against any non-resistant pokemon. If you hate the typing though then I'd say Horsea is the best. Only weak to Dragon type moves and learns some very good moves with the altered learnset. I've never tried Magby, mostly because I'd rather use a Houndoom if I'm going to go with a Fire/Dark typing."

pokemonzetaomicron,2v4jbd,itsandrewinit,1 point,Sat Feb 7 22:46:29 2015 UTC,"Imo, Magmortar is the best."
pokemonzetaomicron,2v4jbd,welcome2thejam,1 point,Sat Feb 7 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"They all have their strengths and weaknesses.  Bellsprout has a poor offensive typing, but Spore makes it fearsome. You could make an easy switch to a teammate, or just destroy your opponents yourself, as Swords Dance/Growth allows it to easily set up some fearsome attack stats. Give it Leaf Blade and Custom Move Rock, and it can hit most everything except steel types, and even they might not like a +6 attack.  Horsea doesn't have a ton in its moveset, but it is equal in both attack stats, making it able to run either way. It also has the best typing, with only two weaknesses (and one barely represented in Z/O), and arguably the best offensive stat boosting move in Dragon Dance. Get one or two of those in, and Horsea's pretty much unstoppable, no matter what move you use.  Magby doesn't have any great boosting moves to boast of, but makes up for it in offensive coverage. In addition to its fire type moves, it can learn stuff like Earthquake, Psychic, Rock Slide, Brick Break, Thunderbolt, and Z/O exclusive Dark Pulse. Though it specializes in, well, special attack, it can do well as a mixed attacker and will patch up any holes in your team."
pokemonzetaomicron,2v4jbd,ShitsNGigglesdTB,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:03:00 2015 UTC,"Horsea, because Kingdra. There's two ways you can go about making it a beast. 1) Adamant Nature: Ddance, Outrage, Waterfall, filler move. 2) Calm (+Attack - SDefence): Ddance, Outrage, Waterfall, Draco Meteor. The first takes full advantage of his potential attack and nothing else. The only thing is the third physical move is hard to find because his move pool is low. After the first region the only attack I could find was Headbutt. On the other hand, the second set keeps a reasonable special stay for breaking out a Draco Meteor when you really need it. With his resistances you should be able to take most special hits anyways."
pokemonzetaomicron,2v4jbd,triggernometron,0,Sun Feb 22 01:37:14 2015 UTC,"In these games specifically? Probably Horsea (Great type combo, good moveset, high base stats). Out of all the games? Charmander (Great powerhouse, wide variety of moves allows for multiple strategies, 2 megaevolutions, oh my gods is shiny Charizard cool)."
pokemonzetaomicron,2v3cyn,itsandrewinit,2,Sat Feb 7 14:48:03 2015 UTC,You can basically solo the rest of the game with Garchomp if you give it swords dance. I do not really recommend that though as it makes it rather dull
pokemonzetaomicron,2v3cyn,LashBack16,2,Sat Feb 7 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"Having Tyranitar and a Walrein with rain dance isn't good synergy. If you are going to summon weather you should just summon one type and stick with it. Rain dance doesn't look like it helps your team anyways, I know Magmortar doesn't like it.  Lava plume is unnecessary on a Magmortar that knows flamethrower. I'd replace it with thunderbolt, as your team could use some electric moves.   Similarly rock slide makes stone edge obsolete on Tyranitar. I'd consider breeding dragon dance onto it or a physical move in a different type.   Garchomp doesn't need both dragon rush and dragon claw. Like with stone edge and rock slide, the extra power does not justify the lack of accuracy and lower pp. I'd consider breeding outrage onto it if you want a high risk high reward move. Otherwise go with fire fang to hit steel types with levitate or air balloons.   Breloom could stand to lose either brick break or sky uppercut, which one depends on whether you prefer raw power or the better accuracy and screen removal of brick break. In its place you need to teach it spore. It's the best status move in the game and lets you set up really well with sword's dance.   I'm not sure I would run sword's dance on a Skarmory, they just don't have much attack to be boosting in the first place. Roost may be a better option, as it lets Skarmory last a long time as a physical wall. Of course that would mean needing to switch to a stall moveset, which may be too much work. I would consider breeding brave bird onto Skarmory to replace fly though as brave bird hits much harder.   Ice beam should be Walrein's only ice move and surf should replace waterfall as its water move. Walrein has better special attack than attack, see. Rest can help Walrein last longer if used on a weaker foe and crunch is an option for coverage.  Ultimately Walrein and Magmortar may end up weighing your team down a bit. Neither pokemon is really all that strong in its own right. If you are looking for replacements, Gyrados is an excellent water type and Blaziken is a really good fire type. As far as beating the game goes your team is fine, but if you want an easier time then think about these suggestions. Definitely think about them for the post game because this game gets very difficult very quickly then."

pokemonzetaomicron,2v3cyn,bye_proxy,1 point,Sat Feb 7 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"No problem!  One other suggestion -- maybe teach Magmortar Thunderbolt instead of Lava Plume.  Usually the only time I keep two damaging moves of the same type is if one carries a different effect, such as Mach Punch and Close Combat.  Since Flamethrower is effectively just a beefed-up version of Lava Plume, it'd be nice to get some Electric coverage on your team, especially against any Water-types Magmortar's up against.

Just repeatedly tap the letter it's showing for a few seconds, and then it should let you backspace and type. If it starts doing it with a different letter after backspacing, just repeat the process and it should be done after a few different letters."

Then some person comes in, and the dude talks about the old days, and asks to fight him.  His wife is just calmly sitting across the table, and when the fight starts, this fucker pulls out the pokémon she has always wanted to return! And to top it off, she's a witness of Celebi getting beaten unconcious by this person, AND AFTER THAT HER SWINE OF A HUSBAND GIVES HIM/HER A GIFT.  They're divorced now by the way in your game."
pokemonzetaomicron,2upk6z,AgusMariss,12,Wed Feb 4 02:19:22 2015 UTC,"In terms of features, Insurgence is far ahead. It has character customization, Gen 6 mechanics, better secret bases, and much more. However, it is not finished and there is about 20-30 hours of playtime.  Zeta/Omicron are completed games with 2 full regions, but run on Gen 5 mechanics and are slightly easier. That is not to say that they have no features; they still have many things regular Pokemon games do not (visible IVs/EVs, etc).  I suggest starting with Zeta/Omicron while Insurgence is being developed, so as to avoid Insurgence's cliffhangers like the one in the current version."
pokemonzetaomicron,2upk6z,yadec,4,Wed Feb 4 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"Insurgence isn't a completed game, yet. It's just a demo while Suze finishes it. Zeta/Omicron, on the other hand, are two completed sister games with two full, distinct regions. I played Omicron before Insurgence came out, and absolutely loved it. If I were you, I'd choose your favorite between Zeta and Omicron, play it, then when you're done there's probably going to be a lot more progress made in Insurgence so you can swing over to /r/pokemoninsurgence and download the demo.  Play Z/O, then hit up Insurgence. I think you'll appreciate the games more if you see how it all started. Remember the wiki!  http://pokemonzetaomicron.wikia.com/wiki/Pokemon_Zeta_Omicron_Wiki  I would highly suggest bookmarking this link, the information here is extremely helpful.

pokemonzetaomicron,2uj4rr,Galalithial,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Pfft. I got Eevee as the ""best"" mon in the randomizer I just started. Who needs legendaries?"
pokemonzetaomicron,2uj4rr,Galalithial,-5,Mon Feb 2 22:22:52 2015 UTC,"So, I just looked it up, because this has been bugging me for a while. There are 721 pokemon, but I believe Zeta/Omicron only use 704, though I'll use 721 for math purposes. Out of that, there are 39 legendaries, and 12 pokemon considered to be mythical. that is 7.08% of all pokemon being of legendary rarity. So, with three starter balls, taking in the fact you can look in all three balls before choosing, guess what? That is still a 7.08% chance of a legendary. Because each pokeball is randomly pulling from the full set, not a combined set. I can still accept that, though, that is still a chance 240 times greater than it snowing where I live.   The real problem comes with my latest experience, highlighted in a post i made a couple days ago. Immediately after choosing my starter (Mew) I randomly encountered Rayquaza. Not long after that, Lugia. And I encountered three more after that before getting to the first town that wasn't the starting town. So, that's five legendaries, all at that 7.08% chance. But, the odds of encountering consecutively decrease with each encounter. With the first legendary, it's 7.08%, the second is 0.5%, by the fifth, the chances are 0.00018%.  Do those odds increase if you encounter pokemon inbetween that are normal? Yes! Substantially, up to a whopping 0.0079%(assuming an average of five encounters between each legendary)!  My point remains that the game seems weighted in favor of legendaries. If it's not, and we are all exceptionally lucky, cool! To be fair, I don't think we'll ever see someone excitedly post about getting their starting wynaut. It just seems wrong.  TL;DR: Math shows that a surplus of legendaries exist."
pokemonzetaomicron,2uj4rr,qhea__,9,Tue Feb 3 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're simply wrong. There's a 51/721 chance of getting a ""legendary"". The thing you have to calculate is the chance of NOT getting zero legendaries. (I don't know what told you you'd still get 7%, it's horrendously incorrect). So 721-51 is 670. You need to do (670/721)(669/720)(668/719). Those values go down because the size of the set shrinks. So that's 80.2% of not getting a legendary, which puts the chance of getting at least one legendary at 19.8%."

pokemonzetaomicron,2umi5w,EliteFlyingTaco,3,Sat Feb 7 03:25:14 2015 UTC,"Gengar is usually fun. Good speed and special attack, kills a lot of stuff with shadow ball.  Alakazam can be pretty sweet for pretty much the same reason as Gengar, though it is pretty frail.  Gyrados is an absolute beast, especially with his mega evolution. However he may be too strong to be fun.  Magnezone is a pretty sweet special attacker and has a good ability in sturdy. Even if it gets on the wrong side of a super effective move it is likely to survive long enough to thunder wave its opposition. Kind of clashes with Electvire, though.  Blaziken is a very good battler, though again it may not be fun. With speed boost and swords dance on one pokemon you can blaze through just about anything, so long as it survives the first hit anyway.  Machamp has access to no guard and dynamic punch. The combination is brutal. He also gets the elemental punches for more fun.  Porygon Z is a fantastic special attacker. Give him a pair of choice specs and tri attack and go to town.  Jolteon is a pretty good electric type too, with the opposite strategy as Magnezone. Jolteon outspeeds most targets and packs a hefty punch too, though outside of electric his attack choices are weak. Still, he does get volt switch to get himself out of trouble.  Arcanine can be another interesting fire type, with options in extremespeed, close combat, and morning sun if you feel like breeding.  Espeon is yet another worthwhile special attacker. Magic bounce is also a fun ability.  Scizor is a good attacker that suffers a little from not having moves that are worthy of his attack. Still is a great pokemon with good typing.  Heracross also has a good bit of power even if it is on the slow side. If you get its mega stone you get one heck of a power house.  Gardevoir is another solid special attacker, though it has more special defense than others. Getting its mega stone gives you one of the only fairy types in the game.  Staraptor is a surprisingly good pokemon. With both brave bird and close combat on one pokemon, combined with Staraptor's attack, is a very good thing.  Excadrill is just awesome. Its earthquake is a thing of beauty and it has the speed to outrun many opposing threats.  I haven't raised a Ferrothorn myself, but I have heard many good things about it. Its mostly defensive but apparently still packs a pretty good punch."
pokemonzetaomicron,2umi5w,Collagekid1024,2,Wed Feb 4 07:57:32 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Thorough and really good advice.  I love it.  I was tempted by a lot of these, particularly scizor.  I considered getting a ferrothorn and using the spiky ability and giving in a rocky helmet while EV training it in def and special defense.  Of course, any none physical would leave me vulnerable, but overall great.  i like these ideas. Thanks for taking the time!"
pokemonzetaomicron,2umi5w,Fecal_Shrapnel,3,Wed Feb 4 12:26:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a Huge Fan of Aegislash myself. Interesting typing and an insane hybrid moveset. King's Shield + Sword Dance and either Sacred Sword and a ghost type move or your choice of steel + ghost type moves. You get an insane wall or an unholy phys. attacker. He's really slow though (King's Shield is priority however) so gyro ball can work and I'm a big fan of zombie strike myself. Just a thought. Unfortunately I just remember he's an Aroma pkmn, but i already typed all this so there you go."
pokemonzetaomicron,2umi5w,bye_proxy,2,Thu Feb 5 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"Crobat is pretty fun to use, because he's got a lot of tools to play around with (that he can fire off first with his high speed) : Taunt, Tailwind, u-turn, super fang, acrobatics.  Lots of fun psychic types: Simple Swoobat (calm mind sweeper+stored power if you want breed it on one is a beast).   Reuniclus is a monster with a good defensive nature+ magic guard, and trick room would make it + walrein a pretty strong threat to any team.  Starmie is still a good idea to use on your team, because it's so versatile  Togekiss can be underwhelming at first, but where it shines is in making opponents paraflinch (thunderwave+air slash= never being hit again) and whatever you want in the last two slots because it can do ALOT)"

Just grind up SD against RizeFlygon, because he can't do any worse than normal damage against Garchomp, heal when needed, then unleash hell. Do Dragon Claw on Megasparce, Machamence, and Hydreigod. Do either Earthquake or Dragon Claw on RizeFlygon, and Earthquake against the rest.

pokemonzetaomicron,2uhgw4,Collagekid1024,1 point,Mon Feb 2 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"IVs are nice, but not super important unless you look into movies like Hidden Power. Effort Values (EVs) are points your Pokémon get a feel battling other Pokémon. Different Pokémon species give different Evs. The max you can get per stat is 252, I believe in total one Pokémon can have 510 or 508. The more EV points in one stat will make that stat higher. Having a Nature which makes that stat naturally higher pairs well too. So if you wanted super high attack, you might consider choosing an Adamant nature and 252 attack Evs.   Idk if this game changed how they work, but that's how normal Pokémon games go. IVs also raise your stats, but I'm not really versed in them, nor am I sure how to raise or lower them."

pokemonzetaomicron,2uer70,sacrifair,1 point,Sun Feb 1 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"Don't ever tell anyone I told you this, because if anyone else finds out I revealed this ancient and secret method, I'm as good as dead.  Dance naked about a campfire for three days and three nights whilst chanting a Native American tribal song. Then run to the nearest river and catch three level 14 Magikarp. They have to all be EXACTLY level 14, all one after the other. If this doesn't happen, you must start over from scratch. Then go to the PC and release all your Pokémon, except the three Magikarp, into the wild. At this point, you may want to teach them the Custom Move so they can fight. Then level them to Level 120, without evolving them. You can NEVER catch any wild Pokémon again, including shinies. I know, it hurts, but it must be done. Now go and fight Wilson with your little fish monsters. Keep in mind, the Custom Move when you fight Wilson MUST be either Fire, Water, Grass, or Electric. No other way. Once you've beaten him, he'll give you a top-secret dialogue, congratulating you on beating him with nothing but Magikarp that are weak against his Pokémon. He will then instruct you to Soft Reset and delete your save file. When you create a new game, it'll actually pick up pretty much where you left off, but now, if you go to your PC, the Memory Chamber will instantly purify any shadow you have. Good luck!     TL;DR-Just kidding, man. It works the same in these games as in the official ones. Have fun!"

pokemonzetaomicron,2uepu8,Zhen64,1 point,Sun Feb 1 14:26:56 2015 UTC,Depends on the nature and EV's. I'd also say that Fire Blast or Flamethrower could be dropped for coverage if possible.
pokemonzetaomicron,2uepu8,joey_sandwich277,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:09:58 2015 UTC,I think having flamethrower and fire blast together is a little redundant. Since all of your IVs are 31 it is your EVs that determine your stats. Check the window where you can see IVs and the first number is the EV total for that stat. For every four EVs the stat is increased by one. For Charizard I'd recommend putting all your EVs into speed and special attack. If you put EVs into wrong stats there is a guy you can get in the level three secret base who will reset your EVs. You can also buy berries in the Blackfist department store that will lower EVs in a certain stat. The wiki has a list of good places to grind EVs. Hope this helps.
pokemonzetaomicron,2uepu8,Collagekid1024,1 point,Sun Feb 1 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"Comparing it to the current Gen VI base stats chart, your Charizard has higher end numbers for every stat except defense which is about mid-line.   Now, note that this is compared to a lvl 100 Charizard, not a 120 like is possible in Z/O, so I'd say they're mostly decent. I don't know how the additional 20 levels changes the potential stat spread.   I got the current Gen VI stat chart information from bulbapedia, so I can't confirm how accurate it is."
pokemonzetaomicron,2ud4p3,abuchinoic,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"Your team is a bit unbalanced and will have major problems dealing with Wilson unless you level grind a bit. Morgan could be a problem too as she has quite a few ice type moves on her water type pokemon. I'd consider getting a solid steel type like Metagross or Magnezone. If you want to stick with the dragon motif I'd keep Hydreigon but see if you could breed it to teach it dark pulse, which is a solid STAB for it. Haxorus is not the best pokemon out there either, lots of power but can't take hits all that well. It also doesn't add anything to your coverage, being pure dragon type. I would consider getting a Salamence, they're awesome."
pokemonzetaomicron,2ud4p3,Collagekid1024,1 point,Sun Feb 1 06:26:15 2015 UTC,"I have lv50 tyrantrum and salamance in back up as well but idk how i feel about haxorus , i think he is a solid sweeper with double dance+ dragon claw+outrage/x-scissor(leftover) and he is with me for the longest time among all my pokemon.   So I will probably get a metagross for the team and start looking into breeding   Btw i know it's too much but can you compare the dragon in tao energy trio,weather trio and creation trio? I wish I have all of them in my team.  Thx u very much."
pokemonzetaomicron,2ud4p3,Collagekid1024,1 point,Sun Feb 1 09:24:26 2015 UTC,"Both Reshiram and Zekrom in the Tao trio are really good. They are very similar, the only difference being typing and that Reshiram is special while Zekrom is physical. Personally I'd say Reshiram is better overall because no pokemon is immune to fire, but Zekrom picks up fewer weaknesses with its second type. Both dragons are a little on the slow side, though. Kyurem is just not as good, as ice is a horrible defensive type and its attack stats are lower than the ones the others specialize in. Kyurem-Black and Kyurem-White are amazing, though, with a huge boost in power. The trouble is that in this game you can only catch either Reshiram or Zekrom and by the time you do so there is no one left to fight as postgame content doesn't allow the use of legendaries.  Rayquaza has a ton of power but lacks somewhat in the bulk department. His ability can shut down whole teams but is often useless. He also gets V-Create via move tutor, and unlike Victini has the stats to use it. He is also found pretty near the end of the game, though. You will get some chance to use him at least. If they ever patch the game so that he gets his mega evolution I would absolutely use him. Mega Rayquaza is the single most broken pokemon in the entire game.  Dialga and Palkia are also very similar, both being special attackers. Dialga has better defense and Palkia has better special defense. Palkia is only weak to dragon and the almost non-existent-in-this-game fairy, while Dialga is weak to both ground and fighting, two common types. Dialga has more resistances, though. Palkia's spatial rend is a pretty sweet STAB, Dialga has to make do with draco meteor or dragon pulse, which aren't as good. Water is also a better attacking type than steel, so I would say Palkia has the edge in usefulness. They're pretty much even with the Tao trio in terms of stat distribution, though I think I'd give Palkia the edge over everyone for not being weak to earthquake. Giratina is a very different sort of pokemon, emphasizing bulk over power. Origin form gives it some offensive ability, as well as an ability that is actually useful. Dragon and Ghost don't compliment each other too well, not like dragon and steel or dragon and water, so it's a good thing Giratina has its bulk. I personally think walls are pretty much wasted in the actual game, where you fight dozens of trainers on a route. Once again, though, Palkia and Dialga are version exclusive and all of them are caught at pretty much the end of the game with not much to use them on."

You buy the upgrade from the Poketech Designer, who's an unlockable asset after you've upgraded the Secret Base (buy all the upgrades when it's still a cave and interact with the purple gem). Once that's there, you can open it up from the pause menu and select the trade option.

pokemonzetaomicron,2ue70p,joey_sandwich277,2,Mon Feb 2 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"The only other mods are various custom graphics packs. Searching for graphics will give youquite a few graphics packs.   Online battling hasn't been implemented yet as the devs are mainly focusing on /r/pokemoninsurgence currently so it might take a while.   Trading requires both the people who are trading to be online at the same time to send(and accept) trace requests. Unfortunately the z/o servers have been shut down to work on some of the bugs (afaik) so trading in z/o cant be done right now.   And as for rare candies, those are scarce till you get to the final part of the game iirc but you could still over level your mons by grinding tediously. And I have no idea what shiny codes are."

I dont recall there being a way to choose the font that the game uses, but if you get a fresh download of the game and copy the files in the fonts folder into the windows fonts folder, then you can use the fonts that are used in the official pokemon games.  The fonts folder that comes with the game is just a folder that contains the fonts that you need to manually install, the game doesn't read from it at all.  Edit - actually now that I think about it, you might be able to get the custom fonts that you want and rename them to the same name as the ones that the game comes with, then install them manually like you would the original ones. Though I imagine there would be compatibility issues if you try that :/"

If you can find someone who'd teach it toxic, that'd be really prime. Smogon has a pretty good set for Porygon2 so I'd just follow that.   For Lucario, consider replacing Force Palm with custom move Fire for coverage, or Iron Tail if you have it. Replace Dragonite's Wing Attack with Fire Punch (tutor move). Consider switching out Landorus' Giga Impact for another move, although I'm not sure which one as I have little experience with him.

It may hit less often but it is guaranteed to incapacitate, while confusion is chancy. Sucker punch is another option if you want a priority move.  Aura sphere is a better special fighting move than force palm, but if you are running sword's dance you may be better off using a physical move like earthquake instead.  I actually think fly might be a better STAB flying move than wing attack. Wing attack is just too weak for my tastes.  Giga impact is just a bad move. I'd consider ditching it for hammer arm.  Gyrados is fine.  You need Porygon Z. I would consider getting it tri-attack for the normal STAB, possibly replacing signal beam.  All in all, though, you have a strong team. Best of luck."

Their defensive stats should also be brought to 31. Draco jet is probably unnecessary on Garchomp as it should outspeed most things and hit with outrage. I might consider stone edge for that slot. I'm not sure exactly why he's packing poison jab, to tell the truth. Charizard and Greninja can take most grass types and stone edge would hit bugs for super effective damage. There aren't enough fairy types to really justify it in my opinion.  All in all your team is varied enough to take on just about any challenger, but will have trouble dealing with some gimmicks. I could see Mega Reuniclus being a huge challenge. Other than that I think you're good to go."

I don't remember too many mega fairies, just Gardevoir and Mawile and Mawile is immune to poison. The only other fairy I remember encountering was Klefki, and it's also immune.

pokemonzetaomicron,2tn9x4,orbitalenigma,2,Mon Jan 26 00:05:37 2015 UTC,"Well not having access to Aroma is... pretty significant with regards to suggestions to make.  Same with wanting a pure fire type.  When you say you're about to fight Odin, do you mean the fifth sigil hall? If so... I'm not sure it's worth training up a brand new pokemon for that fight (especially since it would take a while to get a brand new one to an acceptable level). That said, a fire type is good against some of his pokemon.  Typhlosion is okay, but not exactly a powerhouse. Reasonably fast (though not really fast) and with a slightly above average special attack, he's not incapable offensively.  He doesn't have a very interesting movepool, but if you can get it off before taking a hit, Eruption is UBER strong. Other than that, unless you want to breed like Extrasensory on him he's really got nothing in his kit.  Darmanitan is still on the table as being wildly powerful and pure fire type.  Um... I suppose Ninetales is an option if you give it Drought Ability with a Dream Stone. It's not as strong as Typhlosion but since it brings sunlight with it... The problem is that you can't give him Solar Beam until you get the TM (much later) so he's also got a pretty gimped move pool.  Arcanine is a decent choice as well. Not as strong as Darmanitan physically but more durable as a trade off. Extreme Speed, Crunch, Flare Blitz, and Close Combat is also a fairly dirverse moveset."

pokemonzetaomicron,2ti2m6,juan-jdra,3,Sat Jan 24 21:36:57 2015 UTC,I always thought level did... So what does affect catch rate other than the known status effect an weakening the pokemon?
pokemonzetaomicron,2ti2m6,Tehbanananinja,2,Sat Jan 24 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"Hp and status effect increase the catch rate of a pokemon.  For example, Mesprit has a catch rate of 3 (as per pokemondb.net), which is a .4% chance at full hp with a pokeball. Different balls increase this chance (great ball x1.5, ultra ball x2, dusk ball at night x5). I'm not sure the exact difference that hp and status have on the chance."

pokemonzetaomicron,2tdv9e,gitts411,5,Fri Jan 23 07:59:43 2015 UTC,IV's add to your stats based on the level.  So no it won't make any difference if you do it at level 1 or later.
pokemonzetaomicron,2tdv9e,CrookedSnatch,2,Fri Jan 23 08:50:34 2015 UTC,"IVs and EVs work together to determine the stat.  Just like you can lower stats by using the EV-resetting berries in late game, the same is true if the IV would be changed.  Another way to put it is looking at the ""nature vs. nurture"" argument in developmental psychology, where IVs are ""nature"" and EVs are ""nurture"".  At low levels, IVs make a fairly minor impact (e.g., a lv.2 Pidgey with an Attack IV of 31 might only have 1 or 2 more Attack than a lv.2 Pidgey with a 0 Attack IV).  EVs are gained from defeating enemy Pokemon and complement the IV to raise the stat.    Whenever you see base stats on something like Bulbapedia or Serebii, there's always a range.  Take a look here.  You'll see that Houndoom's Special Attack stat can range from 202 to 350 at Level 100.  The 202 value is based off a Houndoom with a Sp.Atk. IV of 0, zero EVs, and a hindering nature, whereas the 350 is based off a Houndoom with a 31 IV and 252 EV.  As a result, changing the IV wouldn't have a different effect from level to level; the resulting stat is simply calculated using the IVs and EVs.  It just appears to have a greater effect at later levels because a high-level Pokemon will usually have a lot more EVs than a low-level Pokemon.  tl;dr IVs are the foundation of the stat, so changing them at later levels is no different than changing them at early levels.  EVs exaggerate the effect at higher levels, but their actual level has no effect."
pokemonzetaomicron,2tdv9e,lawre179,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:52:28 2015 UTC,"Cool, I thought it only gained stats based on these integers during level ups."
pokemonzetaomicron,2tegu2,aspernator,3,Fri Jan 23 13:36:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can get a dratini early game until you get a super rod  (or fish around in the Safari Zone in Onega Town), which is right before you do the Elite Four. Togepi i think you get as an egg right around the second or third gym. For further reference: http://pokemonzetaomicron.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon  I suppose the best advice i can give you is for your pokemon to have super effective moves for most types, and that (since 4th gen) physical or special moves aren't bound by type anymore (so have at least one physical and one special attacker).  You won't see this much, but fairy types are a new thing, and are immune to dragon types. Invest in a strong ground type user, they seem to come in handy.  Your starters have been buffed to match the strength of a normal starter, so don't drop horsea or magby if you happen to catch a charmander or squirtle along the way."

pokemonzetaomicron,2tegu2,AsuraVaruna,2,Sat Jan 24 05:39:35 2015 UTC,"Even without the use of healing items, for PvE you're usually best taking attacking movesets. Most fights don't even last long enough for it to be worth taking Setup moves either. Having a variety of pokemon with good speed and attacking stats will allow you to switch in whatever you need to deal with a threat (using battlestyle ""shift"") and usually OHKO it unless you're horribly underlevelled.   Swords dance/nasty plot are usually only worthwhile for Elite 4 fights and a few occasional leader fights when you're facing down 3+ pokemon you can't OHKO. More often than not, trying to use a setup move just gives your opponent a chance to status you or grind a bit of health off. In long caves you'll save yourself far more HP if just win fights without taking damage, rather than trying to make the PvP style tactical play.   Early in the game you have a limited choice in TMs and Pokemon, so pretty much just use whatever you can your hands on. Try to get some physical attackers and some special attackers and keep varied coverage on each. I quite like Gengar or Alakazam as my special attacks and Garchomp/Haxorus are by far and away the strongest physical attackers you can get your hands on. With HM items available you don't even really need HM slaves (which would normally limit your party of attacking pokemon to 4), so there's more room than ever to double up on some type coverage. For each main type try to have at least one physical attacker that's got a super effective move, and at least one special attacker. This allows you to get around more defensive pokemon like Golem/Tentacruel with a single hit, regardless of whether they have high defence or special defence.   Also, having an ice move is is 100% essential. I'd consider giving it to multiple pokemon when you get the Ice Beam TM. Also remember that many pokemon have a surprisingly large movepool that you might not expect for their type. Gengar for example works really well with a set along the lines of: Shadowball/Thunderbolt/Icebeam/Flamethrower which allows it to take on most threats with the speed and special attack to OHKO most PvE opponents of similar levels."
pokemonzetaomicron,2tegu2,bye_proxy,1 point,Wed Jan 28 14:47:35 2015 UTC,"I'm quite familiar with that playstyle, it's the one I used as a kid: fast, strong attackers with good coverage getting a free switch with the ""switch"" playstyle. This time I wanted to get a bit more tactical and get the most out of my Pokemon.  BTW, I have Zam, Gyarados and Gengar already. Their movepool is still shallow because I don't have many TMs, but they hit like a truck."

pokemonzetaomicron,2t3pgh,CrookedSnatch,3,Tue Jan 20 22:39:35 2015 UTC,Have you changed computers recently and moved the game files over? That'll be your issue if so. The save file is located in a different folder. Check to see if it's still there.  For PC:  C: -> Users -> YourComputerName -> Saved Games -> Pokemon Zeta/Pokemon Omicron
pokemonzetaomicron,2t3pgh,KimTheNukeJongUn,2,Tue Jan 20 23:15:57 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for responding.  I haven't changed anything.  Was playing earlier and got the script is hanging error and the game closed.  Walked away from the computer for a while and came back to finish it.  When I go to the saved games file it shows three Save_0_Backup_1.rxdata with 1-3 Backup files there.  I was playing on the first save file.  At this point is that normal and what do I do with it? Again thank you so much.
pokemonzetaomicron,2t3pgh,KimTheNukeJongUn,3,Tue Jan 20 23:23:51 2015 UTC,"The backup files there are for cases where you're stuck in a place and can't exit, so you can just replace the normal save file with one of the backups. They're created fairly frequently. I would say, if you're missing the normal Game.rxdata file, rename one of the backups to Game.rxdata and re-open the game to see if that's close to where you left off."

Once both are open, you want to open up the patches's folders, find out which folder it says to paste into on the game folder, and move them over.   Its pretty much just moving files from the patch folder into your game folder. The patch folder should tell you which folder to paste the new information into."

Secondly, while there's nothing particularly wrong with your logic with regards to continuity; I'll put for this rationale: The reason your pokemon stop following you when they faint is because precisely that; they've fainted and can't really follow you around. Gym leaders are, on the other hand, stationary so if their pokemon faints, it can just sit down and chill next to its trainer."

pokemonzetaomicron,2si5zc,AskReplyAnswer,3,Thu Jan 15 10:48:45 2015 UTC,Z/O is based on gen5 mechanics so females do not pass down egg moves. You'll have to resort to chain breeding. I think dwebble can learn both(one through level up and another through breeding). I'll  check it when I get back home
pokemonzetaomicron,2si5zc,Sleepymon12,2,Thu Jan 15 11:23:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight into this matter.  So what would be the steps involved in this chain breeding process? Also, I assume what can be done with a dwebble can also be done with a crustle"
pokemonzetaomicron,2si5zc,Sleepymon12,3,Thu Jan 15 11:47:44 2015 UTC,"Err, I made a mistake. It's for spikes/leechseed ferro, sorry :/  The only way I can see for you to breed stealth rock+leech seed would be to get a stealth rock turtwig line from someone(since you can't use the move tutors yourself) and then use that to breed your ferro, so basically you have to ask someone who got to the 2nd region to help you out"
pokemonzetaomicron,2si5zc,rnpg1014,2,Thu Jan 15 13:17:52 2015 UTC,"Your female Ferroseed will never be able to pass down stealth rock to its offspring, so you'd need to use a third pokemon that can learn both moves and pass it down to Ferroseed.  Unfortunately, Dwebble/Crustle cannot learn leech seed. Dwebble/Crustle was mostly used to get a Ferroseed that knows Spikes + Stealth Rocks.  It gets worse: the only way to get a Leech Seed/Stealth Rocks Ferroseed in Gen V (before BW2 added move tutors) was to use a Gen IV Torterra who was taught Stealth Rocks via TM.  TL;DR you can't do this without move tutoring."

(: As it turns out, Gible is in the Dragon and Monster egg groups, and Cyndaquil is in the Field egg group. They'd have to have at least one matching to breed together. Sorry, man.  EDIT: Tell you what, though. Go to the Friend Safari of username Dirk. Turn on Speedhack to about 4x, and start looking. I found a shiny Frogadier in my own base in about an hour that way.

Which consist of breeding your cyndaquill with any compatible pokemon of foreign origin or to have your led pokemon hold the""shiny charm"".  That said I don't know if the ""shiny charm"" exists in Z/O and as for the ""Matsuda method"" you'd need to find out if there are foreign builds of the game and if the programmer coded the ""Matsuda method"" into the game.

Now put that file on a flash drive or something of the sort that you can transfer onto your new computer.   On your new computer, make sure you have downloaded Omicron or Zeta and started a new file as this will create the saved games folder for it.   Once the flash drive is in the computer, copy the file. Replace it with the game.rxdata file that is on your new computer. Make sure you replace it, which means the one you just created with no data should be gone.

pokemonzetaomicron,2ru8d6,ddressler1,2,Fri Jan 9 08:17:38 2015 UTC,"A brief explanation of ivs and evs  IVs:  IVs are like the talent the pokemon are born with, and max value is 31. They affect the stats of a pokemon along with evs. In regular games, you'll have to breed for it but in Z/O, iv stones make the pokemon have perfect ivs so its kindof a moot point.  EVs:   while IVs are genetics, EVs are obtained through training. evs are like experience points, but instead of contributing to the pokemon's level, they contribute toward a pokemons stats. the max evs that a pokemon can have is 510 evs for all stats combined, and 255 evs for a single stat. However, 4 evs raise a stat by 1 point, so the optimal spread of evs usually used for competitive is 252/252/4 spread among 3 stats, while the remaining 2 ev points(510-508) are useless  • power items(found in blackfist) also help to ev train, they add 4 evs to the evs gained  • pokerus doubles the amount of evs you get from a battle  An example: if you battle a bulbasaur, you get 1 sp.atk ev, but if you battle an alakazam, you get 3 sp.atk evs. now if your mon holds a corresponding power item while fighting alakazam, it gets 7 evs (3+4). if it has pokerus as well, it gets 14 evs (7*2). if you want to train sp.atk evs to 252, you'll have to fight a poke that gives 3 sp.atk evs exactly 18 times, while having pokerus.  You horse battled with atmost 10 pokemon who yield speed evs and it has 10 evs and 8 iv in speed. Tbh, you don't need to bother about evs/ivs for the storyline.   As for your suggestion, suze and co are mostly focusing on their current project, /r/PokemonInsurgence, so it's doubtful that it'll get implemented"

There's a gym where you're forced into a double battle with your rival against the leader, and the rivals pokemon are straight up useless. There's another double battle near the end that was quite tough because of Gengar's typing.  In the main games, playing solo isn't too bad because by the time you reach the endgame, your pokemon is over-leveled enough to deal with the last handful of battles (I recently did an Emerald Solorun with a Zubat). In Z/O, by the time you reach the end of the Vesryn story arc, every pokemon you battle is near-max or max level as well.  It was fun though. I'd recommend it."

pokemonzetaomicron,2roeln,Clutz35,2,Thu Jan 8 03:50:06 2015 UTC,"Damn, I don't think I can go through all that trouble. Could you not have given her a focus sash to prevent that though?"
pokemonzetaomicron,2roeln,mtlyoshi9,2,Thu Jan 8 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"I wound up constantly switching hold-items, move-sets, and strats to get past different parts. Some of it just boils down to RNG. It's doable, but some parts are just frustrating."

pokemonzetaomicron,2roeln,BoundlessHorizons,3,Thu Jan 8 05:25:58 2015 UTC,Pick something with good type coverage and decent defensive typing (I'd def. avoid anything with a weakness to Dark type) and you'll be fine. Or just pick a pokemon you like and stick with it :)
pokemonzetaomicron,2roeln,BatMannequin,1 point,Thu Jan 8 05:29:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I might pick a dark type like Absol or something like that.
pokemonzetaomicron,2roeln,ZEB1138,1 point,Thu Jan 8 07:26:19 2015 UTC,I'd say anything from OU and learns powerful moves in later levels will probably serve you well.

pokemonzetaomicron,2rn89v,Solfee,5,Wed Jan 7 22:47:17 2015 UTC,Basically he restarted the game over and over until he encountered that shiny latios.
pokemonzetaomicron,2rn89v,LandKingdom,3,Wed Jan 7 22:59:36 2015 UTC,Hard reset: Fully closing the game window.  Whether you can soft reset or not and how to do so depends on the game but for this game(and also Insurgence) it is pressing F12 at any point you want which will take you to the intro screen where you can get to your last save point which is before engaging Latios in this instance.
pokemonzetaomicron,2rn89v,MaDNiaC007,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:59:51 2015 UTC,Don't you get one by just doing one of the challenge modes? I got one of the lats shiny that way.

pokemonzetaomicron,2rn89v,SwegFlash,0,Thu Jan 8 18:45:44 2015 UTC,You get a shiny latias for beating the pp challenge for the first region. Shiny Jirachi for beating the solo run.
pokemonzetaomicron,2rn89v,devondashla,0,Thu Jan 8 22:41:50 2015 UTC,What exactly is the value of a shiny in a Pokemon ROM?
pokemonzetaomicron,2rn89v,sharryhanker,4,Thu Jan 8 00:21:03 2015 UTC,The same value it is in any other Pokemon game.

Also, they have to be the same format, as RPG Maker (a modified version of which was seemingly used for ZO) supports multiple filetypes, and keeps them separate.  Except, you can't replace the RMXP RTP music (without hacking the game at least), since they are included in the program and it's games by default, i think. Unless they are in the folder..."

pokemonzetaomicron,2rmxos,krysztal,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, except that it doesn't need to be the same format, just one compatible format with same filename as original. This is how sound in Mac and Linux versions works, because those OS...s cannot play midi thru wine/wineskin without hacks, it's easier to replace them with ogg files."
pokemonzetaomicron,2rmxos,Holyrapid,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure if it can be any other format, but i'm fairly sure it has to be, as if RMXP detects a missing file, it will crash with an error that says ""missing file (folder)\filename.extension"".  I have dabbled with RMXP, VX and Ace for years so i'm fairly confident that you can't replace it with a file named the same but with a different extension, as the engine (RPG Maker XP in this case) differentiates the files by extension, even if it won't display it in the editor.  If you have RMXP, feel free to try importing a custom sound file, setting it to something like title music, and running the game from the exe after saving the changes. (i can't remember if test play [which allows for some minor debugging, like walking trough solid tiles while holding control] tolerates missing files without crashing. I'm sure it throws an error message, but it may continue to function without it, unlike the actual game)"
pokemonzetaomicron,2rmxos,krysztal,1 point,Wed Jan 7 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"As I said, this trick is actually used in official OS X release of the game. You can download core for zeta or omicron for OS X, then go to Pokemon Zeta-Omicron 1.4.app/Contents/Resources/drive_c/program files/Pokemon Zeta-Omicron 1.4(Win)/Audio/BGM/. All midi files are replaced by ogg files, and game still works and plays music. I think either Suze used some clever hack to do this, or engine used in this game looks for FileName rather than FileName.ext, and is set to play whatever type of file it got."
pokemonzetaomicron,2rmxos,hirmuolio,1 point,Wed Jan 7 21:30:37 2015 UTC,I can confirm that you can replace the midi with ogg and the game works with the new music.

Second:   PC: C:\Users(your name)\Saved Games\Pokemon Zeta (or whatever appropriate game you're playing) If you are on Windows XP and cannot locate the above folder, the folder should just be the folder with your Game.exe and the rest of the files.  Mac: Right click the app, Show Package Contents, drive_c, Program Files, Pokemon Zeta (or whatever appropriate game you're playing) In both cases, it is the Game.rxdata file.

pokemonzetaomicron,2roovn,Kyrios9,1 point,Sat Jan 10 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"I will try to explain. Don't have a mac, but I will give it my best shot.  Find the .app for the game. Right click it, then select ""Show package contents"", then go to ""drive_c"", then ""Program Files"", and then ""Pokémon [Whatever game you are playing]"".  Inside of that folder, there will be a file called Game.rxdata, which is your save file. Either put that file in a cloud service like Dropbox if you have it, or put it on a flash drive. Almost any flash drive will work. Then eject that flash drive and plug it in to the windows computer.  Once it has installed device drivers (automatically), you should be able to navigate to your save location by opening the start menu, clicking computer, and then going to Local Disk, then Users, then your name, and then Pokémon Zeta. Put the Game.rxdata into that folder.  When you load up the game, it should be automatically loaded. Just reply to this if you get stuck."

I had a gengar and Alakasam in my party which are really powerful heavy hitters but lack in bulk so be careful. You can look on the wiki to see where to catch these Pokemon and their un evolved forms. So do that to see where to catch some of the following powerful UU/NU Pokemon if you want. Here's acouple:   Porygon-Z or Porygon 2 Kingdra Metagross Honchkrow Galvantchula  Haxsorus  Espeon Chandelure   Good luck!

Hawlucha: Hi Jump Kick, Aerial Ace/Fly/Sky Attack/Flying Press (depending on how you feel about two turn moves), Hone Claws can help take away/minimize the downsides of Hi Jump Kick or Swords Dance for just maximum impact, and Rock Slide/X-scissor/U-Turn/some other coverage."
pokemonzetaomicron,2rf8w1,orbitalenigma,2,Mon Jan 5 23:16:01 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna have Thunder Wave/Will-o-Wisp on Rotom, consider getting Hex over Shadow Ball as it does twice as much damage when the foe has a status effect."

pokemonzetaomicron,2rgg5u,Baliskos,3,Tue Jan 6 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"A special attacker water type would be not unwelcome in your party.  Also though it pains me to say it, Breloom and Victreebel are pretty redundant together. I think Breloom is better but Victreebel is your starter and I'm the kind of person who sticks with his starter. But Breloom master race... hmm."
pokemonzetaomicron,2rgg5u,orbitalenigma,1 point,Tue Jan 6 00:22:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, and if I were to replace either Victreebell or breloom (I agree with you probably Victreebell, even though it'll be hard to see her go) which pokemon do you think I should replace them with?"
pokemonzetaomicron,2rgg5u,orbitalenigma,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:57:49 2015 UTC,"Well it sort of depends on who you're using as your sixth. If you get a good special attacking water type like, say, Omastar (trade for one or wait until Caspian), then you can get a solid Ice Beam user and don't need another anti-dragon type for if Garchomp bites it.  While the only gym of this type is long-past, one hole in your coverage right now is against Fighting types. A good Psychic or Flying type wouldn't be amiss."

I try to trade, both offer Pokemon but then a screen says ""Waiting..."" and it just sits like that.  It also doesn't let me move my cursor around, I had to put the Eevee and the dud Pokemon in the front of the party before I tried to trade just so I could select them."

pokemonzetaomicron,2r51az,tinytigress,9,Fri Jan 2 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"It looks like your pokemon's moves could use some diversity. Typhlosion has three fire moves and Serperior has three Grass moves. This makes them very narrow in battle, they can end up being useless realy easily.   Luxray is (unfortunately) a Pokemon with generally low defenses and speed; he can hit hard, but he's gonna have trouble taking any hits and he won't usually go first.   If you just caught Jirachi he's not going to have any EVs yet, so he'll be a bit weak for a level 50. Get him Iron Head if possible, it'll help.  Giving Lucario a Steel type attack might help too, just for the STAB.  Hope this helps a bit :)"

Mind seeing if there's any pokemon in my box I might be able to swap out for me? Or if there's something I should change? I plan on farming a bunch of iv stones too.   I have rapidash, venosaur, gible, toxicroak, pawniard, mudkip, hawlucha, starraptor, luxray, gardevoir, gallade, jirachi, serperior, mew, darkrai, chesnaught, infernape, maganium, delphox, torterra.   In my party now I have mewtwo, typhlosion, garchomp, thunderous, kingdra, and lucario.   A lot to ask I know. I just feel like honestly the only two doing work at ALL is lucario and kingdra. The other four feel absolutely useless. :("
pokemonzetaomicron,2r51az,thedark1owns,2,Sat Jan 3 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"Not a problem :-)  One of the most important things is diversity on your team. Your current line up looks pretty good, if it feels like lucario and kingdra are doing everything that might just be bad luck. It's a solid line up of strong pokemon and you've got a lot of variance.  Mewtwo is still one of the best pokemon there is, given the chance I think he could easily be a star on your team if you want. If you decide against him, gardevoir is another great psychic type.  Two really important things to remember are to keep your move types varied and to make sure you're giving them the right kind of moves. Mewtwo's attack is pretty bad, but his special attack is crazy high, so just be sure to give him special attacks.   Thundurus is kind of a weak addition to your team because you've got access to electric attacks through your other pokemon. Hawlucha is a personal favorite, but he'd be a little redundant when you've already got lucario. Since you don't seem to mind using legendaries, darkrai would be amazing. He gives you an easy answer to ghosts and psychics, while also having access to a REALLY good sleep move and also some electric attacks.

pokemonzetaomicron,2r51az,Depowered_on_M-Day,3,Fri Jan 2 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"No, sorry, that's my mistake.  I'm simply suggesting a stronger electric type, because Luxray doesn't rank very well at all. A Raichu might even be better."

pokemonzetaomicron,2r51az,mrsinger186,1 point,Fri Jan 2 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"More suggestions: Raichu, Jolteon, Ampharos, Dedenne (if available), Magneton/Magnezone, Electabuzz/Electivire  All of these are very hefty in Special Attack, and some are also very heavy in Defense or Speed. Dedenne has a helpful dual-type, but Magneton would suffer more from Ground attacks than any of them."

I'd get a ground type of your choice, just search and find the one you like the most.  ·Idk the moveset for porygon, but i'd put an psychic and a electric move on it, since porygon can learn those moves, for type coverage.  ·Also, since your seadra will eventually become Water/dragon kingdra, i'll get rid of Axew and introduce a fighting type, like scrafty, for type coverage.   Hope I helped!"

pokemonzetaomicron,2qxzzm,Qosole,4,Wed Dec 31 19:24:31 2014 UTC,"Deino/Hydreigon: I'd replace Roar with Flamethrower personally.  And Crunch (since you have/will have Dark Pulse) with whatever coverage you feel like you'd rather have from the following: Signal Beam, Earth Power, or Surf.  Excadrill: Replace Slash with your choice of: STAB Iron Head, Brick Break (coverage), X-Scissor, or Shadow Claw (or Zombie Strike if he can learn it).  Blaziken: Seems fine though if you want ULTIMATE POWER. Hi Jump Kick is a better (though more dangerous) option than Sky Uppercut. An alternative to either EQ or Brave Bird is protect to get a guaranteed Speed Boost, but that's of dubious worth for just storyline play.  Staraptor: This would be my choice to replace for Aegislash. Nonetheless: Close Combat and Brave Bird are great choices. I'd replace Quick Attack with Return or Double Edge if the recoil doesn't bother you as much. I'd replace Endeavor with another utility skill like, say, U-Turn or Roost.  Vaporeon: Seems fine. Shadow Ball might be replaceable with Hidden Power if you prefer the typing.  Metagross: Fine."
