What is your opinion on incorporating psychedelics into pain management?  I've been a long time sufferer of histamine headaches. I've tried everything from pure O2 to triptans and injections. I am lucky enough that my attacks only lasted 3-5 hours at their peaks. Usually always waking me up at 1-2am and finally subsiding when the sun would start to rise. It wasn't until my 30's that I finally gave P. Cubensis a try. It was a really bad attack, and my eyes were watering so hard I needed my wife to make the tea for me. After drinking the tea, the headache completely vanished. Normally, when the attacks subside I can feel a ""shadow"" headache that lingers in the background, not hurting just standing by waiting for the next attack. After cubensis the entire headache, shadow and everything, was completely gone. I've had 3 attacks since my first time using cubensis, and all 3 since had the same results. It has been 8 months since my last attack. I still try to keep just 1 dose of cubensis at a time on stand by. It scares me that the only thing that has stopped my suffering could put me in jail. I then think of all the severe attacks I had as a child, once breaking my nose from pushing my face into the cold wall too hard. The headaches are the most painful experiences I have endured."

wince,3a242q,IHaveStupidOpinions,5,Tue Jun 16 18:31:49 2015 UTC,I've known people to get mold/infections in between the nails
wince,3a242q,ColinOnReddit,3,Tue Jun 16 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"This is very true!   I used to wear fake nails while I waited tables and that was a bad combination. I washed my hands quite a bit during my shifts and after awhile moisture accumulated leading to fungal growth (I assume). While it wasn't just flat out smelly, discolored, and/or disgusting, my nails began to not properly adhere to the nail bed. I had to get them removed or risk losing my natural nails altogether.   It does take a long time to get natural nails looking nice, but I've discovered it's all about how you file and shape them even if they are really short. After a lot of practice over the years, now I take pride in my nail art. Lol I own way too much nail polish and accessories though (if that's possible)."

wince,3a242q,SienaBlaze,2,Wed Jun 17 04:51:33 2015 UTC,That really depends on how it happens.   When I was a kid I'd had a car door slam on my middle finger of my left hand and after some swelling and the nail turning black the nail fell off.   Came back just as good as new. 20+ years later you'd never know I'd lost a nail.

Not snapping as badly as this video though, sure, but I think I'll still refrain from it just in case haha.  EDIT: I found the video I was talking about (seriously fricken wince-worthy as well). To be fair, what I had forgotten about in this video was the fact that they were positioned really badly.

wince,34vr90,Chamomileable,12,Sat Jun 27 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"Synthol is so pathetic.  If you don't know, it's effectively an irritant that was supposed to be used as a topical oil for bodybuilding competitions. If you inject it into the muscles in small doses, however, it causes the muscles to swell and temporarily can make them much larger than normal. The cost of this, however, is that your body isn't effective at removing Synthol, meaning that it tends to build up with repeated use and eventually causes the muscles to turn hard like bone. If you notice, when this dude flexes, his muscles don't move at all. They're buried under gunked up Synthol, dead tissue, and inflammation."

I think he hit his butt or hamstring. There's no blood showing or aftermath so it's not that bad to watch just a really bad injury.

wince,2yqp0i,dedtigers,3,Thu Mar 12 01:05:39 2015 UTC,Still better to take it out the way it went in. The barb on the hook won't really do too much more damage. Better to have a friend with some repressed animosity towards you and you messing potentially messing up his fishing trip do it for you.
wince,2yqp0i,lonestarfisherman,3,Thu Mar 12 20:41:01 2015 UTC,Ouch. I would say push it through and use cutters to snip the hook but it doesn't look like it pierced the nail - he would have to force it through.  I'm sure he had a great time removing it. Fuck that.

wince,2y9h94,modernbenoni,5,Sun Mar 8 02:28:09 2015 UTC,This happened because she overextended her knees. This can happen to anybody at a mildly heavy weight with overextended knees. When you're standing it is way less likely to happen because your anterior chain is activated.

In pharmacies and nature shops, it is called ""Arabic gum"" (not to be confused with gum arabic) and ""Yemen gum"". In Greece, it is known as the ""tears of Chios,"" being traditionally produced on that Greek island, and, like other natural resins, is produced in ""tears"" or droplets.  Originally a liquid, mastic is sun-dried into drops of hard brittle translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright white and opaque gum. The flavor is bitter at first, but after some chewing, it releases a refreshing, slightly pine or cedar-like flavor.  The word mastic is derived from the Greek verb, μαστιχειν ""to gnash the teeth"", which is the source of the English word masticate.  The word mastic is a synonym for gum in many languages.

Hell your keyboard is covered in so many that it isnt even funny. There are probably trillions of bacteria alive on that wall. They get put on there from gum that was in peoples mouths (which contains billions of bacteria), and then survive and grow in the sugar nutrient rich mesh of the gums. As long as it is kept moist every now and then (it is seattle, and outside so that's a given), that wall is about the most disgusting thing you can touch. The main thing is it is almost entirely made from materials that come from humans mouths, and your mouth is probably the most disgusting cesspool of bacteria out there. That's why human bites are so much worse than like a dog bite or a cat bite and almost always get infected. The sugars in many gums help the bacteria have stuff to take in energy and reproduce. Similar to building plaque and rotting your teeth with a bunch of sugar in your mouth.  It's like you stuck a cake outside, in a wet climate, and over the course of months you have hundreds of people stop by and spit on the cake.

wince,2woj60,TtarIsMyBro,9,Sat Feb 21 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, you have to insert the en bloc clip (yes, it is a clip in this case, not a magazine) into the receiver. When the clip is fully loaded the bolt releases and shoots forward. You're supposed to hold the bolt back with the heel of your hand."
wince,2woj60,sp106,3,Sat Feb 21 21:18:38 2015 UTC,"The most common situation where this happens isn't when you properly load a clip but when you fail to pull the bolt handle back all the way.  If you pull it back just past the magazine follower on an empty rifle, it will hang on it and appear locked back to the uninitiated. As soon as you load a round or press on the follower, it will close the action as shown here.  When you're loading a clip, the action must be locked open (if it was as described above, you won't be able to see the slot for the clip itself) and you will have to be trying pretty hard to get your finger caught in there even though it will automatically chamber the first round when pushed fully in.   Also to improve the wince here, here's that clip in real time and the aftermath"

M. showed the doctor the fluid on the dressing. The doctor looked closely at the wound. She shined a light on it and in M.’s eyes. Then she walked out of the room and called an ambulance. Only in the Emergency Department at Massachusetts General Hospital, after the doctors started swarming, and one told her she needed surgery now, did M. learn what had happened.

A straight razor is a hollow ground blade that is sharper than pretty much anything else you would ever handle and is very delicate. It's literally meant to split hairs so they're made from a rather brittle but hard steel that takes a very good edge. Learn to use one properly and you'll have a better shave for waaay cheaper than store bought razors (over time at least, there's an initial investment.)"

wince,2rk5a9,wanderlustgizmo,4,Wed Jan 7 03:28:02 2015 UTC,"Fencing response:       The fencing response is a peculiar position of the arms following a concussion. Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as American football, hockey, rugby and martial arts. It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.     Image i - Schematic illustration of the fencing response during a knockout. A The individual receives a punch to the head. B After the traumatic blow to the head, the unconscious individual immediately exhibits arm extension on the same side of the body as the site that received the blow and arm flexion on the opposite side while falling to the ground. C During prostration, the rigidity of the extended and flexed arms is retained for several seconds as flaccidity gradually returns.

wince,2pmsaq,KateNoire,-4,Thu Dec 18 20:41:18 2014 UTC,It was boiling. We had turned off the heat about a minute before filling it into glasses so it creates a vacuum inside the class while cooling down. It must have been really hot.
wince,2pmsaq,thm2130,4,Thu Dec 18 20:44:55 2014 UTC,"ok, I understand how canning jars work. but it obviously wasn't that hot. go turn on one of your burners on the stove and put your hand on it. then try to ""walk off"" the blisters and pain and see how that goes"
wince,2pmsaq,NorthBlizzard,3,Thu Dec 18 21:10:31 2014 UTC,"In second grade i touched a stove grate before. Had a neat blister across all my fingers. The pain was awful, but I didn't suffer immediate skin peeling or anything."

wince,2pmsaq,KateNoire,1 point,Fri Dec 19 02:39:22 2014 UTC,Were you able to walk off the blisters?
wince,2pmsaq,thm2130,1 point,Fri Dec 19 01:34:10 2014 UTC,"Somewhat. I hid it at first, but i was 7, so I couldn't help whimpering, then my dad caught on and took care of it"
wince,2pmsaq,KateNoire,-6,Fri Dec 19 02:52:42 2014 UTC,"This wasn't the first time I burnt myself (or got burnt in this case) that's why I wonder why there wasn't more damage.  I accidentally touched the heating wire thingy inside my oven with the back of my hand, I still have a little scar. The skin got stuck right there and burnt off. It was gone. I know how it feels."

wince,2pmsaq,munchies1122,3,Thu Dec 18 21:38:21 2014 UTC,Was it such a good idea to put his burned hands into this water? I've heard burn wounds infect easily.
wince,2pmsaq,north7,3,Thu Dec 18 05:27:54 2014 UTC,"Even when the main source of the burn is gone, your flesh is still too hot and will continue to cook and damage that area more.   There's more ideal ways of cooling than others, but you do what you can."

wince,2oahjt,mrroboto43210,0,Fri May 1 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"because skaters are punks. they don't give a shit about others.  they are annoying and usually represent the lower class law breaking part of society. Also, they are fucking annoying with their noisy fucking boards banging and clacking on the pavement. They block stairways, infest quiet parks leaving empty beer cans all over and for some reason the obnoxious scent of weed always follow them.  FYI Charlie Mason was just having fun...why the hate? Kids that commit B&Es are just trying to have fun...why the hate? Punk teens that beat up old ladies for their purse are just trying to have a little fun...why the hate?"
wince,2oahjt,kbzero,1 point,Sat May 2 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"I used to skate when I was in high school. I would skate to and from school, and on empty basketball courts. I never bothered with rails and stairways because I was afraid of getting a broken bone. Are you putting me in that same category?"
wince,2oahjt,mrroboto43210,-1,Sat May 2 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"No..I use to skate too when I was a teen.  I used it mostly for transportation, but most of the other guys who skated were punk wannabe criminals.  That skipped school, did drugs, and were drunk whenever they could get some booze.  I also worked in teen corrections and everyone one of those punks skated religiously. So with any type of generalization, there are exceptions.  What I should have said was ""most"" are punks.  I know that people say that you can't judge a book by the cover and boys just wanna have fun, but I go with the saying, ""dress for success"". What that means is that you dress, act and pick a like style that you are comfortable with and usually one likes to let others know what their all about. So that they/we can bond with our own kind. So if it looks like shit, smells like shit, tastes like shit...then it is probably ""SHIT""! My S.O. got upset at me a couple of weeks back because I made the mistake of saying ""look at that fucking skater punk""while we were in the car going through a lower income area.  She is kind of naive and believes all people are good at heart. lol  I told her that Charlie Manson must be a good guy too then.  So anyway, I told her to look in the rear view mirror and there the skater punk was, beating on some passer by. The victim was a few years older but noticeably geeky.  We called the cops and they got there fast.  The punk was taken into custody. So a lot of people may say that skaters are cool and are not as bad as people make them out to be and that they are getting a bad rap, but I say that most are punks.  I'm very good at first impressions and have lived in very, very bad places.  A couple of them being ""Driftwood and Jane&Finch Toronto"" and I survived by being able to read people very quickly.  We all have our own opinions and I base mine on many years of personal and professional experience. So one skater teen or one grown up wannabe skater are not going to change my mind. I'm not trying to change yours either.  I'm just saying that when I see a reddit post of some skater punk damaging himself, then I feel joy.  That's just me and I'm not sorry for that, even though I'm Canadian."

Vitamin D3 is very important to supplement in colder seasons and environments when one is not exposed to sun nearly as much. Without it your body is not going to process the calcium.  Did you know D3 cannot penetrate glass OR sunscreen? Your skin must be directly exposed to the sun. And you will never get enough from your diet. Also if the sun is near the horizon you will not get D3. If you are someone who lives in a colder climate you're going to be covering up 90% of your body. It's safe to say you will not be getting enough D3 for months."

wince,2ny0az,MarkovManiac,23,Mon Dec 1 15:07:14 2014 UTC,"As a person who works with metal I can assure you, you don't want metal in your eye. It's easy to get shit in your eyes even with safety glasses on. I ALWAYS have mine on, I feel naked without em.   TL;DR: General experience with getting a piece of metal out of your eye and eyes heal fast.   When the doctor goes you remove a piece of metal, he literally has to scrape/ pull it to get the piece out. They get you you rest your head on a nice, comfortable, stand, lightly clamp it down and open your eyelid with a tool attached to stand. They then literally blind you with a light so you can't see the tool going towards your eye, unable to blink, you just sit still and trust your doctor. When Doc starts to scrape/ pull at it you don't feel it on your eye, because it's numb, but you feel the movements further back into the socket. It's very strange. At this point, the Doc should be able to get it out. The eyeball is the fastest healing organ, so it's fortunate for humans that such a sensitive area is actually quite resilient."

The rates of PCS vary, but most studies report that about 15% of individuals with a history of a single concussion develop persistent symptoms associated with the injury. A diagnosis may be made when symptoms resulting from concussion last for more than three months after the injury.

wince,2mvjs2,Usobigusolong,18,Thu Nov 20 14:03:54 2014 UTC,I was parting out a Nissan Patrol and 2 asian guys came to pick up the automatic gearbox (transfer case still attached). The gearbox was on a home made low profile plywood trolley about 400mm2 The 3 of us lifted the gearbox which weighed approx 120kg+  but one of the small build asians couldn't handle the load and gasped then dropped his end which hit the edge of the plywood and shot it up straight into my shin at the speed of light.  My mates eyes almost popped out of his head when i showed him after they left. Bit of ice helped in cooling down the beers which i then drank.
wince,2mvjs2,GoAwayIDontLoveU,5,Thu Nov 20 14:14:30 2014 UTC,What's a Nissan patrol? Plywood trolley? Gear box? Transfer case? How big is 400mm2? 120KG?
wince,2mvjs2,roltrap,2,Sun Nov 23 08:28:17 2014 UTC,Patrol  A trolley is a little cart to transport stuff on.  A gear box is a piece of a car engine that ables you to change from first to whatver gear you want. It can be either automatic or manual.  A transfer case is a particular piece of an engine that drives the 4 wheels of the 4x4. (correct me if I'm wrong)  For the 400mm² and 120kg: just feed it to Wolfram Alpha

My point is them being Asian has nothing to do with the story. The point of the story is the injury, and it doesn't need the extraneous information. If the story were to include that, you'd expect it to include other extraneous information, like someone's clothing or the music playing on the radio or something. It's just very strange for someone to specify someone is Asian when is has nothing to do with the story whatsoever."

wince,2menu9,kuroblac,1 point,Sun Nov 16 05:09:48 2014 UTC,As someone who didn't care about their teeth as a teenager and got bad plaque. Unhealthy gums give you a huge gap from the teeth and the gum. Healthy gums shouldn't stretch like that obviously (even unhealthy gums) but when it does make a gap that digs deeper.  Although I agree that's incredibly aggressive scraping.

wince,2k7k6l,erktheerk,2,Fri Oct 24 23:33:02 2014 UTC,"yeah. mine never really got this bad, but it was pretty bad at one point. still haven't gotten surgery or anything, I'm scared to. I just manage it, take care of it how I can. it doesn't puss very often. pic. it's obviously not very normal-looking after managing this for like 3 years now, but at least it's not infected...  BTW, OP, go do something about your toe."

I could feel the entire bulge of my knee on the right side of my leg, my ankle was all twisted way too far, they had to cut my pants because the were too tight at the knee.  EMT's were new and spent around 7-10 minutes trying to get an IV in, eventually skipped that and wrapped it with gauze (sports wrap?) tightly, took me to the hospital. Was set on the x-ray table, they told me about the tech coming in in a few and what they were going to do.  He unwrapped my leg and there was nothing wrong with it, called a nurse or a doctor back in, they laughed and seemed perplexed and said they'd take a few X-rays.

wince,2jtic6,fdisk2053,-1,Wed Oct 29 14:59:44 2014 UTC,"I suffered a similar injury in a skiing accident. While performing a hard right turn, my left ski hit a snowdrift and stopped dead. The binding (joining the boot to the ski) didn't release like it was supposed to and my body continued to twist and move forward. My knee joint turned through 90° sideways so my left foot was pointing towards my right one, and then I fell over. The fall twisted my knee back the other way again. It only took one second, but it resulted in the most agonising pain I have ever experienced. It felt like my knee joint had been smashed with a hammer.  I couldn't get up for several minutes, and some German skiiers came over to assist me as I lay gasping and crying on the snow. They didn't understand what had happend and thought I was just being a little bitch from the fall, and told me to get up. I tried to explain to them my knee was fucked and I couldn't stand.  Eventually they helped me to my feet, but I still had to get off the mountain. The only way was down, and I had to ski. Very slowly, and in excruciating pain, I slid my way down the slope for a kilometre or so to the next station where I popped my skis off and collapsed on a sofa. I cannot remember what happened then, but I was taken for an X-ray to determine I had not broken any bones, and I was on crutches for a month afterwards while the cartilage inflammation healed.  I do not ski any more, and even though years have now passed my knee still aches in cold weather."

wince,2iz308,Wiki121,-1,Sun Oct 12 15:43:06 2014 UTC,"He was only using one bicep, and if the dumbbell was filled with lead or similar, it would actually be rather heavy. To use your argument, the tear must've happened because he strained himself too much, so most probably the dumbbell's heavier than it may look."
wince,2iz308,kibblznbitz,1 point,Sun Oct 12 20:47:45 2014 UTC,"Well, subjectively, the dumbbell is not heavy to him because he performed 9 reps going on 10 with it, so obviously 50 lbs is nowhere near his max. But it seems as though he is not over-exerting himself more than he would see as wise (have you seen this guy's other videos?). And apparently I was wrong that muscle tears generally happen while overexerting yourself; they can happen doing light, everyday actions.   And we and he know exactly how much the dumbbell weighs: 50 lbs, it says it on the dumbbell.   Tl;dr knowing your limits might not prevent tears"

wince,2iyb4w,sqectre,8,Sun Oct 12 07:28:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah I just had this happen to me, and I had to pull the damaged nail off long before there was a shiny new clean nail beneath the old one.

There's already a partially formed nail and everything is so clean, as though he washed the nail and saved it."
wince,2iyb4w,CrayolaBrown,2,Sun Oct 12 08:07:57 2014 UTC,I kicked the couch the other week on accident and flip-topped my nail (think canadian from south park) and inevitably when it fell off it still had this hard layer at the bottom.

wince,2iyb4w,majoroutage,7,Sat Oct 11 18:12:37 2014 UTC,This one wasn't ripped off. If you look closely you can see the outline of the new nail in the old one. The injury probably happened weeks ago and it's just now letting go.
wince,2iyb4w,sqectre,2,Sat Oct 11 17:02:52 2014 UTC,"I just did, but had it come off well after a new nail already partially formed beneath the damaged nail (like in OPs picture) it would have hurt a hell of a lot less. Also, there's no dried blood or anything. It looks as though he injured his finger, the nail fell off, he cleaned it up and saved it to take a side by side picture several weeks later.  I have no idea why anyone would do this, so I doubt it's an accurate explanation, but there is something suspicious about this image. If that nail has just cleanly come off, there would be blood and wet tissue beneath the nail. Had a nail already had time to grow underneath an old one before it detached, then it seems completely painless."
wince,2iyb4w,fairies_wear_boots,2,Sat Oct 11 18:05:34 2014 UTC,"I left the nail on after breaking my finger (bottom of the nail) while the new one grew in,  eventually it came off on its own as a full nail and looked just like this..  It's just not at the time of the injury. It looks like it did happen then as the nail looks like it might be upside down.  Where the bulge in the nail looks like where the new nail grey under.  While it's not as wince worthy as if he showed up straight after the incident,  it bloody hurts when that flesh is first exposed to the air when the original nail first falls off."

If your patient has no patent airway and is suffocating, a paramedic can toss an intubation tube down their throat and assist with breathing, an EMT can't.  (as much as paragods would like to disagree with me) our job in the ambulance is not to treat a patient, our job is to stabilize a patient and get them to someone who can best handle the situation, be it a trauma center, a stroke center, a heart specialist, etc.    source:  I am an EMT in one of the largest/busiest cities in the US."

Scope of practice usually includes taking vital signs,  identifying the mechanism of injury, stabilization of the patient, and initial treatment of exterior wounds. The medication an EMT can administer vary state to state, but are usually limited to oxygen therapy, oral glucose, and assisting the patient with epipens, inhalers, and nitroglycerin. Paramedic = usually work on an ambulance in 911 response. Scope  of practice is same as EMT but they are able to administer medicine and treatments like IVs, pain meds, are able to intubate the patient (stick a breathing tube down their throat), use EKG machines.  At the end of the day the job of EMTs and paramedics is to keep the patient alive and get them to the hospital where the doctors will fix them, ie package and transport."

wince,2i5ng7,Fatyguy,1 point,Fri Oct 3 07:08:11 2014 UTC,"Deadly force:       Deadly force, as defined by the United States Armed Forces, is the force which a person uses, causing—or that a person knows, or should know, would create a substantial risk of causing—death, serious bodily harm or injury. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a last resort, when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.    Firearms, bladed weapons, explosives, and vehicles are among those weapons the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of nontraditional-weapons in an offensive manner, such as a baseball bat, sharp pencil, tire iron or other, may also be considered deadly force.   ""Use of deadly force"" is often granted to police officers when the person or persons in question are believed to be an immediate danger to people around them. For example, an armed man flaunting a firearm in a shopping mall without regard to the safety of those around him, and refusing or being unwilling to negotiate, would warrant usage of deadly force, as a means to protect others. The use of deadly force is also authorized when a person poses a significant threat to a law enforcement officer, usually when the officer is at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the United States, this is governed by Tennessee v. Garner, (U.S. Supreme Court 1985) which said that ""deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others."" This case abolished the Fleeing felon rule where a fleeing felon who posed no immediate threat to society (e.g., a burglar) could be shot if they refused to halt.

wince,2hgi9q,Beckneard,9,Thu Sep 25 21:29:42 2014 UTC,"Having done something very similar, all that is going through your head is how you're going to land your body while sustaining the least amount of injury.  My story: Sandy Valley MX, CA. Back before they reversed the track they had a 100 foot table top that had a 33ft ""easy"" landing zone and a 90ft ""you're fucked"" zone. You either hit it and landed at the 33 or you sacked up and went the full 100. 90 and you'd case and rebound, flying down the landing ramp probably upside down and promptly dying.  I did the 33 but was working my way around clearing every hit on the track like all the cool guys.  Prior to the 100 footer was a little 20ft step down double, I'd never had a problem with it until I went to hit the full 100. Somehow in landing the 20 I knocked my bike up a gear and it bogged the motor (2 strokes have all their power in the high rpms). I was going too fast to hit the brakes and bail, I'd have landed at about 70 or 80 and died. So I feathered the clutch, pumped the throttle and hoped for the best.  On the face of the take off I finally hit the power band. Hard. It was enough to clear the 100, but also torqued my bike into a backwards rotation. Flying through the air I played out every possible scenario for landing.  One would be grab tight, hit the brakes and try to nose it back down. If that failed I'd land with basically no rear suspension at that angle and then bounce into a front flip down the landing ramp and land on my head with my bike there to break my neck and spine.  I chose to fuck off and eject.  I kicked the bike as far away from me as I could and flailed a bit to get into a ""legs, ass, back, head"" landing procedure.   I don't remember anything after that until some nice dude grabbed me and told me to sit down because I was wandering the landing dazed looking for my bike. I sat down, he got my bike off the track, we loaded up and went home then my folks convinced/forced me to go to the ER. CTs, Xrays, all good barring a small concussion and gravel in my butt.  It might have been the morphine goggles but the nurse that scraped the rocks and dirt from my ass, leg and back was hot as fuck.  I also managed to get tangled up in the bike despite my efforts to get away. I had massive knobby tire bruises up my back for weeks and even managed to bend a thick steel cotter pin that holds the bolt on the rear axle, with my ass.  I think I got sucked into the area below the rear fender and above the tire.  My bike was fine, all in all it wasn't that bad. Definitely not scary at any point, you don't have time to feel fear.  This guy chose to do a front flip and land legs, ass, back, head too. A fine decision that certainly saved his spine. I'd bet he walked away from this sore but intact."

Imagine you're holding a garden hose. Bend it and the water flow stops, then when you let it go it bursts out, right? Now, imagine you bend it just a little bit, the flow weakens, but the pressure still builds up just as if it were bent completely. With this information, if he sits with his knees kinked, reaching a holding the towel on his ankle, he may stop the bleeding and it can coagulate faster. But when someone else arrives and he lays flat and relaxed where do you think that pressure and excess blood flows to? That my friend is how you get mass oxygen in the blood stream and beautiful blood clots.   Smarter to attend to the wound first, then call."
wince,2ha7uo,RockYourOwnium,1 point,Wed Sep 24 14:05:25 2014 UTC,"If there's no vessel injury (or at least a large vessel), the best thing to do is immobilize and splint in a position of comfort. Surprisingly, these types of injuries don't bleed as much as you'd expect them to. Of course, they can, in my experience they don't. I'd be more concerned about infection with an open fracture exposed to a surface as dirty as a trampoline.   Osteomyelitis (infection in the bone) is nasty. It's could easily be worse than the injury itself.  Edit: Also, remember when you bend your knee...you can impede venous blood return. It's like putting on a tourniquet for a blood draw or IV placement. Unless you have an obvious arterial bleed, bending the knee won't do much with bleeding control. Even then, arterial bleeds require lots of direct pressure and even tourniquets if it cannot be controlled."

wince,2ee3zq,ijflwe42,8,Sat Aug 23 22:57:10 2014 UTC,They were suffocating him to death.
wince,2ee3zq,worker32,7,Sun Aug 24 00:19:08 2014 UTC,I see now.  I would think they would just clamp down on his neck hard enough to kill him outright as opposed to suffocating him.  I guess that's why I'm not a lion.
wince,2ee3zq,Humankeg,2,Sun Aug 24 00:32:15 2014 UTC,"Not a biologist here!!  Lions can, with certain prey, break their necks outright and kill instantly.  With larger prey like buffalo, hippos, and even elephants lions do not have a way to kill them in a quick manner, and instead need to exhaust and suffocate them to death.    In most cases (when hunting in a pack) any lions not partaking in the immediate suffocation, will commence eating the the prey while it is still alive.  Bonus: for the most gory hunting videos of all, watch anything involving wild dogs of Africa hunting."

How can a padded object on your head be annoying   See above   Just tighten it to your liking.   That's the problem.

wince,2dvadx,the_clean_pinch,15,Mon Aug 18 09:35:56 2014 UTC,Thats why its not attached to a drill. The nail is very soft compared to the metal that bit is made to cut. So you just put pressure on it and spin it with your hand. Ive helped my cousin do it but we used a much smaller drill bit.

Urination is usually handled by a few drainage holes in the belt. When you urinate you have no control over the process and can feel the warm urine building up inside the belt. As the pressure increases the urine flows faster through the holes in the belt. When you stop you must remain seated and allow the belt to finish up draining the urine. You can never dry yourself completely and will dribble after you stand up. This is part of wearing the belt and you accept this."

wince,2cz8fs,Malfeasant,12,Sun Aug 10 09:22:12 2014 UTC,"Not a doctor but had plenty of knee injuries. If I'm correct that test is the posterior drawer test to check for damage to the PCL (posterior cruiciate ligament). The lower leg going back like that indicates a PCL tear. The opposite to that test is the anterior drawer test to check for damage to the ACL which is much more commonly injured. If in future you see an athlete down and a physio is pulling their leg back and fourth then those are the ligaments they're checking for damage to.  Interestingly, according to my surgeon, many mma and rugby players have torn PCL's and often don't know about it as if injured in isolation it is not as critical to knee stability as the acl and so they don't know they've injured it until they have their knees checked for another reason."

wince,2ctb0s,kittamiau,4,Thu Aug 7 03:05:22 2014 UTC,"Schmidt sting pain index:       The Schmidt sting pain index is a pain scale rating the relative pain caused by different hymenopteran stings. It is mainly the work of Justin O. Schmidt (born 1947), an entomologist at the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Arizona. Schmidt has published a number of papers on the subject, and claims to have been stung by the majority of stinging Hymenoptera.  His original paper in 1983 was an attempt to systematize and compare the hemolytic properties of insect venoms.  The index contained in the paper started from 0 for stings that are completely ineffective against humans, progressed through 2, a familiar pain such as a common bee or wasp sting and finished at 4 for the most painful stings. In the conclusion, some descriptions of the most painful examples were given, e.g.: ""Paraponera clavata stings induced immediate, excruciating pain and numbness to pencil-point pressure, as well as trembling in the form of a totally uncontrollable urge to shake the affected part.""  Subsequently, Schmidt has refined his scale, culminating in a paper published in 1990, which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera. Schmidt described some of the experiences in vivid detail.

wince,2c9o7z,RocketMan63,13,Fri Aug 1 00:04:23 2014 UTC,"Not fungus, that part on the outside of the finger is nail that is still connected. Clean-ish break but this is after she cleaned it and the bleeding stopped."

wince,29vil6,mideon2000,3,Mon Jul 7 00:06:26 2014 UTC,"Section 4. World Championship Wrestling (1991–1994) of article  Mick Foley:       On September 5, 1991, Cactus Jack debuted as a heel and attacked Sting.  After feuds with Van Hammer and Abdullah the Butcher, Cactus Jack faced Sting, then WCW champion, in a non-title Falls Count Anywhere match at Beach Blast in 1992, which Sting won.  For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked.   After spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW Champion Vader's team at a Clash of the Champions event. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at Superbrawl III. He then moved on to face Vader.  Cactus Jack wrestled Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot.  While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.  Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in Have a Nice Day that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.

That's when I would have to always wear my glasses.  I'm just near-sighted enough to make the letters blurry if I don't wear glasses.  At work, I'd also have headphones on a lot over my glasses which would push the arms of the glasses into my head often giving me a headache.  My vision hasn't really changed much in several years so I figured I'd just do it.  You can always go back for an adjustment if your eyes continue to change...as long as you have enough corneal tissue left.  The place I went to didn't fool around either.  I went for an initial consult where they use some cool tech to make a 3D CG model of your eye structure.  Took measurements of the eye, vision test, glaucoma, tear-production test, etc.  Then if you are still a candidate, you go back for a second consult where they run even more tests including drops that paralyze your focusing muscles.  They then run another vision test to see what your true vision is.  If still good, you schedule the procedure and on the day of, you have a quick exam, followed by the surgery and another exam before you leave.  Then a next day exam, a 10 day post-op exam, and a 30 day.  A good place will not fool around.  You definitely want to go somewhere that doesn't hesitate to turn people away if they are not good candidates, a place that uses the LATEST tech/equipment, and a place that takes the time to give you a thorough round of exams. Good luck!"

wince,28savd,_Draven_,0,Sun Jun 22 17:57:27 2014 UTC,"It's just the culture if you wear a helmet skateboarding people call you a pussy or a faggot. Even pro skateboarders don't wear helmets. i have never seen a helmet on the cover of transworld or thrasher unless they were doing vert. I don't know who started it, but it just became the norm. Probably because skateboarding is mainly a mode of transportation like a bike and helmets aren't worn when ur just going down the street skating. Also when you start skating you don't start doing dangerous stuff. you start doing stuff you don't need a helmet for. I have also never met anyone or heard of anyone who had a head injury from skating. Tons of other broken bones but no head issues. Not saying it doesn't happen I just think it must be rare cuz I have been skating forever and know tons of skaters and no one has ever mentioned a head issue"

Wasn't able to breath for the first 10 seconds or so which makes you panic a lot.

wince,26jhl4,buzzlightyear_,24,Mon May 26 19:27:34 2014 UTC,"A high quality airsoft sniper rifle can shoot a bb about 500 feet per second, which can sting quite a bit even from distance."
wince,26jhl4,Dax420,9,Mon May 26 19:30:19 2014 UTC,"So that's a no then. 500 fps is the same as the $40 bb guns at Walmart, and there is no way to stabilize a round projectile to make it accurate at long ranges."
wince,26jhl4,sp106,12,Tue May 27 01:22:27 2014 UTC,"Also those $40 bb guns at walmart are shooting a heavier (.34 grams vs .12-.25) and smaller projectile (.177 vs .23) which will be less affected by the wind and with a lower area that its force is spread across.  Airsoft guns are designed to shoot people without breaking skin, hence soft.   They do attempt to compensate for the lack of rifling in the barrels by imparting a back spin on the pellet using an uneven rubber gasket at the breach, but most bb guns have rifling and can fire minieball shaped pellets which are inherently more stable than a round projectile, especially with rifling added.  Airsoft sniper rifles are mostly a joke, they're only typically stronger because rules allow them to use heavier springs. The difference in the range of one of the fully automatic ones and a manual spring (with a much heavier spring and tighter/longer barrel) is very small when compared to the gap in the real rifle equivalents... then again the people in this video are mostly focusing on playing dress up, not min/maxing the game itself."
wince,26jhl4,Soupmaster44,4,Tue May 27 02:14:52 2014 UTC,Depends on the weight of the BB. A .12 BB will do nothing while a .2 or .25can be very accurate
wince,26jhl4,AncientBlonde,4,Tue May 27 01:52:23 2014 UTC,Ha! 500FPS from walmart? How about no. Unless its an actual BB gun.
wince,26jhl4,cobrareaper,1 point,Tue May 27 04:04:35 2014 UTC,"OP didn't explain well at all. FPS means almost nothing when it comes to range. Yes, you can make it shoot pretty fucking far for a small plastic projectile. Heavier weight BB's (.40s or so) plus some modifications to the hop-up (gives the BB backspin, which is where the range comes from) and the inner barrel can make it shoot accurately at longer ranges than most airsoft guns. However, to get an airsoft sniper rifle to shoot that far, you need to throw a couple hundred bucks into it."
wince,26jhl4,LaughingAtIdiots,1 point,Tue Jun 3 00:26:32 2014 UTC,"Yeahhh no.  The $40 bb guns at walmart at complete shit (Assuming you're talking about the airsoft guns, and not actual BB guns). They're completely inaccurate and will not shoot 500 fps. They MIGHT hit the low 200s.  The way they stabilize the shots is with a small rubber nib inside the assembly. It adds a back spin to the BBs which not only helps keep them from falling (adding distance) but helping make them more accurate too.  My VFC brand machined aluminum rifle shoots about 22 (.5mm .25g) BBs per second, at around 395 FPS, accurate to about 30-40 yards. (400 is the Ohio area's self-imposed limit for competition play)  For bolt action sniper rifles, the FPS limit is 500. It's accurate nearly 50-60 yards if not more for a good sniper. (assuming no wind)  So sure, they're not ""Long range"" but they're not a toy either. They're definitely not the same as those shitty walmart guns either though."

He removed 3 roots and couldn't see any more so assumed that was it. Patched me up, filled the cavity with cotton wool dipped in antiseptic to sterilise it all and told me to come back in 2 weeks to have it filled up.  Two weeks later I go back and he says the horrifying line ""Now since I've removed the nerves from your tooth you won't be able to feel anything so I don't need to numb you today.""  He drilled the temporary filling out without issue, then put the tweezers in to yank out the cotton wool... jet of blood and a feeling like someone stabbing an icicle up through the bottom of my jaw right into my brain. I made a noise like a puppy being trodden on and the dentist seemed shocked. ""You didn't feel that did you?  He'd missed the fourth nerve."

Is this the origination of ""I nearly shit my pants/peed myself""?    For the record, I've never actually shit my pants because I was scared or anticipated pain.

wince,233z6i,autowikibot,1 point,Wed May 21 05:00:17 2014 UTC,"Cnidocyte:       A cnidocyte (also known as a cnidoblast or nematocyte) is an explosive cell containing one giant secretory organelle or cnida (plural cnidae) that defines the phylum Cnidaria (corals, sea anemones, hydrae, jellyfish, etc.). Cnidae are used for prey capture and defense from predators. Despite being morphologically simple, lacking a skeleton and usually being sessile, cnidarians prey on fish and crustaceans. A cnidocyte fires a structure that contains the toxin, from a characteristic sub-cellular organelle called a cnidocyst (also known as a cnida or nematocyst). This is responsible for the stings delivered by jellyfish.    Image i - Nomarski micrograph of a Ruthenium-red stained nematocyst from Aiptasia pallida, the pale anemone. The red dye stains the polyanionic venom proteins found inside the capsule of this partially discharged nematocyst.

wince,233z6i,Erestyn,2,Sun Jul 20 03:08:22 2014 UTC,"I was stung by a (dead/dying) jellyfish last summer and it wasn't the most pleasant experience I've ever had. The best way to describe it is probably a medium burning sensation (imagine weak acid, I guess?). The interesting thing is when I first walked into the jelly, I thought it was just seaweed until the burning set in. After going a little further down the beach (and a lot closer in land - I was about 3/4 of a mile off shore at the time as it was spring tide) and splashing the area with seawater, it wasn't too bad.  The worst thing about it is that I was completely unaware that, after being stung, you have the stingers in your skin that have not gone off. So I put my jeans back on and went about my day. Later that night I got into bed - WITHOUT SHOWERING OR TREATING THE AREA - cue me being stung for the next 3 days. Yep."

And why would you approach the cow from the belly to inseminate it? Rather suspicious of insemination being done here.   I rule this was some stupid woman who's never been around cows, and put the gloves on to keep from getting dirty.   And for all you who say it wasn't that bad of a hit, you may be underestimating how hard a cow kicks. That hit could easily have fractured her jaw.

If there's a fight, they often help sort it out. But in rougher areas, the schools are obviously rougher so the role of the resource officer can change to an actual policing role. I remember when I was in high school, our resource officer was a really cool guy who'd organize (in conjunction with the administration) a lot of little get-togethers after football games at the school to ensure that kids didn't go out drinking. He even did an annual trip to a AA baseball game, but you had to have perfect attendance, at least a 3.0 and so on, but the local sheriff's office covered the cost of the trip for every student who got to go. It was pretty cool, especially for the younger kids."

Most of the time, they'd just walk around the halls during class times to make sure nobody was doing anything they weren't supposed to.  I guess it was in response to certain incidents where kids would sneak out during class and during lunch to smoke pot in the bathrooms.  Other than that, when the occasional fight broke out, the cops would respond and make things a hell of a lot more interesting.    I remember one incident where two boys got into a pretty intense fight.  The cops pulled them apart, and one of them had the bright idea to wrestle out of the cop's grasp and make a break for the school's exit.  The cop ran after him, tackled him hard, cuffed him on the spot, and dragged him to the cruiser in a headlock.  The kid didn't resist after that.  It was incredibly entertaining to watch."

Sure there are bad cops but it is also incredibly difficult to incrementally ration out force in a situation where in one second somebody can be injured or killed. Don't do stupid shit that will require someone to forcibly restrain you and you won't have to worry about them using excessive force."
wince,20xr04,somuchless,27,Thu Mar 20 22:56:43 2014 UTC,"I restrain individuals in similar or worse situations on a weekly basis (hospital security). I can tell you that a police officer would have the knowledge / training not to bend the individuals arm in that direction. He took control of the wrist and elbow which was enough; seeing as he only needed to control the one arm himself. Bending the arm in that direction you are knowingly going to do serious damage.  A less harmful technique would be to simply bend the individual’s wrist inwards; which is extremely painful and uncomfortable. This is easy to do while maintaining elbow (and thus arm) control of the individual.   I do understand where you are coming from when acting in the seconds you do have in these situations to gain control, but I can assure you anyone in law enforcement would have been trained on proper restraint and arrest techniques."
wince,20xr04,italianradio,5,Fri Mar 21 01:23:52 2014 UTC,"You are absolutely correct about the wrist and elbow but it looked like his next move with the arm (the one that snapped it) was affected by the woman attempting to restrain the boy, kinda forcing the policeman to move the arm up over the woman.

That being said, the guy was down and on his chest, the cop could've quite easily had the woman move over, allowing him to straddle him and proceed to handcuff him.

wince,1zrsgx,ASunCame,22,Fri Mar 7 01:46:15 2014 UTC,"Bullfighting is absolutely barbaric. Sadly the flames aren't all the have to endure:   The bull is not an aggressive animal, and the reason he is angry and attempts to charge at the matador whilst in the bullring is mainly because he has been horrendously abused for the previous two days. In fact, what spectators see is not a normal, healthy bull, but a weakened, half-blinded and mentally destroyed version, whose chances of harming his tormentors is virtually nil. The bull has wet newspapers stuffed into his ears; vaseline is rubbed into his eyes to blur his vision; cotton is stuffed up his nostrils to cut off his respiration and a needle is stuck into his genitals. Also, a strong caustic solution is rubbed onto his legs which throws him off balance. This also keeps him from lying down on the ground. In addition to this, drugs are administered to pep him up or slow him down, and strong laxatives are added to his feed to further incapacitate him. He is kept in a dark box for a couple of days before he faces the ring: the purpose of this is to disorientate him. When he is let out of the box, he runs desperately towards the light at the end of the tunnel. He thinks that at last his suffering is over and he is being set free — instead, he runs into the bullring to face his killers and a jeering mob.   .   They cut into his neck muscles with a pica. This is a weapon of about 6-8 inches long, and 2 inches thick. Once it is thrust into the bull it is twisted round and a large, gaping wound appears. The bull then starts bleeding to death."

wince,1zdp14,whootsley,3,Mon Mar 3 01:12:02 2014 UTC,"You've ruptured a vein in the facia of your hand.  Did you feel an.. odd... ache when it happened? Veins getting torn usually feel ""off"". Like a nerves version of ""fingernails on blackboards"".  It would bleed A LOT, but internally...   So the swelling isn't really a swelling as you normally consider one (damaged tissue triggering the swelling reaction, absorbing blood plasma etc....), but a build up of blood under the skin.  I don't think it'd need to get sucked out via a needle, your body will break down the blood and re-absorb it over time. (though it will damage tissue, just like a bruise will).  If the blood gets on joints internally, you'll find they stiffen too.  Lastly..... there could be a bone fracture in your hand....   So:  1: Possible ruptured veins. (accompanying hemorrhaging)  2: Broken/fractured bones.  3: Gross swelling.  4: Sprained tendons within the hand.  Can you report back from the docs?"

wince,1z36b6,sqectre,2,Thu Feb 27 16:04:20 2014 UTC,"I'll take a gander at this through my limited knowledge of medicine.  First thing, I would be extremely worried about the constriction of his airway. If the wax doesn't make it past the oropharynx before solidifying, and he keeps pouring it on there, you can quickly have an impeded airway and no amount of head-tilt chin-lift would clear it. Secondly, assuming he accidentally had breathed the wax into his trachea, he can then potentially clog his vocal cords, asphyxiation once more. Third, let's go really extreme with him breathing the wax and assume it makes it all the way down to the bronchial, or secondary bronchi and potentially even alveoli. We now would have lungs coated in wax and no means for gas diffusion from his lungs to the air.   I have no idea what chemicals are in candles, so I can't say whether or not he is going to be poisoned, but I'm assuming his stomach won't want the wax there anyway, and as such, he's going to have a bad day."
wince,1z36b6,Chinapig,3,Thu Feb 27 17:36:31 2014 UTC,"It doesn't look like he's swallowing. Just allowing it to partly solidify in his mouth. Still, fucking stupid. But I don't think he's swallowing. Kind of hoping he does the next time he tries it though."
wince,1z36b6,Veda_,2,Sun Mar 2 22:18:28 2014 UTC,"This reminded me of this one time, when I poured a cup of hot scented wax from a wax burner into a almost empty plastic water bottle that was laying around, my friend came and sat down right as I set the bottle down and turn around to set the wax burner down, and I guess he thought it was his water, so he grabs the water bottle as the wax was still wet and before I could turn around and tell him not to, he literally took all of the hot scented wax in his mouth in one big swig and swallowed before he realized what it was. His eyes immediately widened and he just stuck his tongue out and held it there, absolutely covered in a fresh smooth thick layer of wax, while panic moaning waving his arms in the air. I felt so bad, but it was easily one of the funniest things I've ever witnessed I was in tears. The best part was his breath smelled of pine trees for the rest of the night. He said it felt weird as fuck when it coated his throat on the way down."
wince,1z36b6,TheObviousChild,1 point,Fri Feb 28 08:06:28 2014 UTC,So you aren't supposed to pour candle wax down a sink drain because it will solidify and clog the pipe.    Drinking it is probably fine though!  /r/whatcouldgowrong

Groland (full name: Presipality of Groland, French : Présipauté du Groland) is a fictional country featured in various humorous programs on French television channel Canal+. It is a vague parody of France and of European microstates. The show associated with the country is Made in Groland, Also known, for the older version as : Groland Sat, 7 Jours au Groland (7 Days in Groland) Bienvenue au Groland. (Welcome in Groland) Groland Magzine, Groland.con.  The landlocked nation is described as a ‘presipality’ (a neologism made from ""principality"" and ""president""), and its main regions are: Upper Groland (le Groland-du-Haut), Side Groland (le Groland-de-Côté), Lower Groland (le Groland-du-bas), and Other Side Groland (Groland-de-l'Autre-Côté). The capital is Groville, the main river is the Gro, and the main prefectures are Grugny, Mufflins, Maroufle and Vichumes. The placenames, certain elements of Grolandais speech (e.g. the use of ""ch'"" instead of ""le"" or ""la""), and the generally crass and unintelligent character of the Grolandais themselves, reflect popular stereotypes about rural northern France. Groland has the distinction of having a border with every country in the world.  The motto of the country is Joie, hospitalité, lâcheté (""Joy, hospitality, cowardice""). The country remained neutral during World War I, and was famous for being a haven for soldiers on leave, with its cheap alcohol and prostitutes. During World War II, the country's leadership collaborated with the Nazi occupier; the government engaged in policies of persecution and deportation of Jews and homosexuals. After American troops liberated the country, a sudden change of mood happened, and alleged former collaborators were murdered.    Image i - Some French car owners show their devotion to the TV program by using this emblem as a rear car tag, as if their vehicle was registered in Groland.

Possible causes include cerebral ischemia, extreme hypoxia or even anoxia. Agonal breathing is an extremely serious medical sign requiring immediate medical attention, as the condition generally progresses to complete apnea and heralds death.  The term is sometimes (inaccurately) used to refer to labored, gasping breathing patterns accompanying organ failure (e.g. liver failure and renal failure), SIRS, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis (see Kussmaul breathing, or in general any labored breathing, including Biot's respirations and ataxic respirations). Correct usage would restrict the term to the last breaths before death.  Agonal respirations are also commonly seen in cases of cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest where agonal respirations may persist for several minutes after cessation of heartbeat. The presence of agonal respirations in these cases indicates a more favorable prognosis than in cases of cardiac arrest without agonal respirations.  In an unresponsive, pulseless patient in cardiac arrest, agonal gasps are not effective breaths.

Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as football, hockey, rugby and martial arts.

Forums have a specific set of jargon associated with them; e.g. a single conversation is called a ""thread"", or topic.  A discussion forum is hierarchical or tree-like in structure: a forum can contain a number of subforums, each of which may have several topics.

This is enough to kill a human being 24 times over.  That said, following this logic, a single shot of everclear (1.5oz = 44ml) would give you a BAC of 0.8%, which is also enough to kill someone.  A single shot of vokda or a single beer (18ml ethanol) would cause a BAC of 0.3, which causes ""unconsciousness and possibility of death"" according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content  OF COURSE chugging 750ml of everclear is enough to kill someone.  But chugging alcohol is safer than injecting it straight into your veins.  If you extrapolate the ""Approximate blood alcohol percentage (by vol.)"" table in the aforementioned wiki for shoenice's chug, he had 39.5 drinks, which would lead to a BAC of 0.16*39.5/10 =   0.632"

wince,1xdngg,210italian,2,Sun Feb 9 02:35:54 2014 UTC,"I really don't think this is physically possible. Someone mentioned PICA. Yeah - even if you have PICA and eat paint chips, it doesn't mean you don't get sick. Your body physically can't handle the stress.  If it is real - I really don't understand how it's possible for him to be alive. One of the things they do for a severe (toxic level) alcohol overdose in the hospital acute care setting is Fomepizole. We use this for methanol poisoning as well (anti-freeze) with kids or homeless people for example. It's preferred over putting the person through kidney dialysis. What it basically does, is blocks the conversion of the alcohol in the liver, because it's the metabolite later produced in the conversion which is the poison, and causes all the terrible affects. Once, it enters a specific part of the cell (called the mitochondria), it basically shuts down the cells and starts killing them.   For the people commenting on ""pumping of the stomach."" There is no such thing for alcohol. You physically cannot pump the stomach of alcohol. Alcohol diffuses into the blood and immediately makes its way into the liver. The only thing you can do is stabilize the patient. You intubate them (stick a tube down their trachea), and prevent the patient from choking on their vomit.  The only thing I can think of is he may have a genetic mutation in the enzyme that metabolizes the alcohol, which prevents him from poisoning himself. That enzyme specifically is very unique, and it varies from person to person. It's this enzyme that causes a gender/race/person variance in alcohol tolerance. For example, women or Asian people getting drunk faster. What this guy does, should put him into a casket. That amount of alcohol would immediately distress his respiratory system and cause him to stop breathing. He'd likely go to sleep and never wake up.   Edit I see this guy does this quite often. Yeah, he's on a fast track to cancer (esophageal, liver, etc), severe liver cirrhosis, death, etc."

wince,1xdngg,Cancani,2,Sun Feb 16 03:33:40 2014 UTC,"He could, but alcohol metabolism is pretty rapid. As a liquid, and the properties it contains - it's able to diffuse through your GI track epithelium fairly quickly, into your blood, and affect your central nervous system. There's a reason it doesn't even take a few seconds before you feel the effects of that 151 shot you took earlier."

There was a video on reddit a few weeks ago with this fighter training by kicking a telephone pole as hard as he could. It's supposed to cause little micro fractures in the bone, which then heal thicker, making the bone even stronger than it originally was. But it also runs the risk of cracking your bones so deeply that they become fragile until the have time to heal. I guess this is the result of that."

This won't prevent the impact, but it will minimize the chances of the deck snapping, which is what caused this kid's injury. If the board hadn't snapped, he'd more than likely have been fine.

wince,1txcbn,CreativeRedditName,2,Sun Dec 29 06:50:07 2013 UTC,"I can't tell what's more impressive, the kick or how strong his leg is to withstand the kick!"
wince,1txcbn,macro312,10,Sun Dec 29 07:32:49 2013 UTC,"Weidman turned his knee into the kick.  Now, that's not the best place to take a direct blow, but it's definitely the hardest, thickest, and not covered by as much muscle."
wince,1txcbn,CreativeRedditName,3,Sun Dec 29 07:35:26 2013 UTC,Just wondering......does this happen alot of you turn your knee to someone's kick or does shit happen?
wince,1txcbn,macro312,6,Mon Dec 30 00:19:55 2013 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I would say kicking into the knee is the easiest way to break your leg/foot simply because it's like kicking a rock.  But from a defensive point of view, you don't want to turn your knee into a kick for the same reason you don't lean into a punch.  It'll fuck you up worse.  In MMA, those kinds of side kicks to the side of the knee are meant to strain the ligaments that stabilize it. A good knee sweep will result in the ligaments being significantly weakened and you won't be able to put nearly as much weight on it. That's why fighters turn their knees inward to ""roll"" with the blow and also so the force makes the knee bend in the direction that it was naturally made to.  So yeah, you can turn your knee into a kick if you want to hurt both you and your opponent.  Chances are it'll hurt him worse in the short term, but if you're a professional fighter and rely on it constantly, it'll destroy your knees permanently in a matter of years.  Also, 99% of the time you're not gonna shatter your leg like Silva did.  The average person can't kick hard or well enough to do that.  His trainer said he likely fractured his leg earlier in the fight and that final kick was the breaking point."
