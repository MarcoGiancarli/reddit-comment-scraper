It means that 80% of iPhone users that listen to podcasts use the native app.. very different fact.

podcasts,3e2jru,mikedufty,8,Wed Jul 22 07:27:17 2015 UTC,"I would say that's a fault of information bias as 80% is such an extreme slant. I download the mp3 direct on Android instead of using a client that tracks the platform (because it's easy to play through a normal music player) but if android had a built in podcast service like iTunes everyone would use that for convenience.

Most consumers don't know how to use rss either.  Also consider that Google doesn't even offer podcasters a centralized platform to share their podcasts.  iTunes offers a platform where people upload their podcasts to, so that they are easily accessible for the users to stream or download without any extra steps just to be played right there in the same app/program.  Even if Android started a service like this with Google Play Music now, it would take forever for all the popular podcasts to catch up with their uploads to Google Play, but it is very necessary, imo."
podcasts,3e2jru,I_WantToBelieve,3,Tue Jul 21 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"Um - podcasts do not get uploaded to iTunes - it's just a directory.

We paid for a year of Soundcloud (split 3 ways it was about $45 each) for unlimited file hosting. Soundcloud also implemented their own RSS feed that you can push to iTunes very easily. So far our experience has been great.

podcasts,3dy1yn,dgerhardt,3,Mon Jul 20 13:52:36 2015 UTC,"I hope this works out for them but I won't be joining. I loved season 1 of Startup and kind of feel like the success of Serial overshadowed how groundbreaking Startup was for podcasting.   But I really couldn't get into Reply All. I know it's really popular but there's something off-putting to me about the hosts' voices. Maybe this is my own issue, but it sounds more like they're trying to emulate Alex Blumberg and TAL. It just feels off to me. Especially when Startup built up Gimlet as this groundbreaking company.   I had a similar reaction to Mystery Show. Alex introduced it and talked up the host as a voice unlike anything you've heard in podcasting. Then the entire episode felt like she was doing her best Sarah Koenig impression. Not necessarily in tone, but the pauses and way she led into topics and points felt very Serial-esque. Considering the episode was about a video store that ""mysteriously disappeared"" it felt like there was a lot of manufactured tension in it and it just really failed to engage me.   Even season 2 of Startup didn't do much for me. I still have about half the season's worth of episodes to get through. After a few episodes I had to ask someone in a thread on /r/gimlet what was so special about Dating Ring because I'd honestly completely forgotten what it was that separated it from other dating sites. Season 1 made me really excited about Gimlet but the first handful of episodes in season 2 just didn't put me into a position to really root for the company.  Hopefully whatever new shows Gimlet has in the works will be an improvement. But so far I'm not as into it as I thought I'd be."

The issue from there is that the way I've set it up at the moment it stores your subscriptions and now playing data as a Chrome Sync Storage object, so it's not writing it out to a file as such. So a one time import is totally something I can look at but ongoing cross platform sync is unlikely any time soon :/  Thanks for the interest!"

podcasts,3du326,kazaii64,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:35 2015 UTC,It doesn't do any kind of batch update or caching - it just updates each feed as you select it. Everything's done client side - there's no back end servers.

I.e. both the option to do batch or one by one. The problem gPodder has is that the two are basically the same thing and that the batch update just queues up all feeds to be checked one by one."
podcasts,3dvu0k,stechreddit,3,Sun Jul 19 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"One option - that's not the easiest, but is worth considering - is to use Libsyn or whoever as your media host, but build the RSS feeds separately on your own website. We use Libsyn to host our files, but the RSS feed is actually just a page on our Wordpress site using a custom template that I built. It means if we ever decide to leave Libsyn, we can just update the media locations in the posts, and we don't have to move the location of the RSS feed.  It's definitely not an option for the faint of heart - I'm a designer/developer professionally - but it should be on the list of options."

podcasts,3dvu0k,DanielJLewis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:22 2015 UTC,You can have one account with multiple shows on Libsyn. But you will still have to pay for each one. Just makes it simpler to log on once and manage all your shows.
podcasts,3dvu0k,dagreatdennis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:10:40 2015 UTC,"I have thought about that but the classic 50 will not be enough storage to handle a weekly show which then bumps me to two $15 plans. I also don't like that their advanced statistics feature doesn't start until you hit the $20 plan and I'm not doing enough shows to justify 400mb/month. Getting the geography stats is valuable to me. Many other hosting services offer that in all their tiered plans but not Libsyn.   Another shortfall IMO is the aesthetic look of the Libson pages. It looks like something from 15 years ago.  For example, this NPR SciFri podcast page is super basic as is the page each show links to. http://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/sciencefriday  This random show on Podbean looks great the way the details of each show are formatted on the same page. http://bigleaguestew.podbean.com/?source=pb  I know Libsyn has been around forever and is the most popular but they are really showing their age. Podbean and some others work well as a stand alone website page which is nice since I want to redirect my domains to each show separately. I know a lot of people just pull the feed from an app or iTunes these days but so many people want to see the look of a traditional webpage like what Podbean offers."

The real driving force (no pun intended..) that will break podcasting to the main stream will be when in-vehicle listening becomes easier. When listening to a podcast will be easy as pressing a button - people will have much less reason to listen to crappy FM shows.  From my experience, nobody has a dedicated radio in their home anymore: almost everybody listens to FM in their cars, or in the dedicated TV channels, etc. When internet radio becomes main-stream, FM doesn't stand a chance."

It's not a lack of quality discussion that has prevented podcasting from dominating radio. Plus, travelling distance also is a huge factor, are you going to listen to a 45 minute podcast on a 10 minute journey?  Still, you make some good points regarding dedicated radios."

Even music: spotify and co. are fantastic alternatives to the endless march of commercials on FM radio...  Also, I don't think that travelling distance is factor at all!

podcasts,3dtwrz,broomlad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"Decent article, but it's basically a rehash of the same issues from over the years. While there are a few podcasters (really publishers) that have become mainstream popular, the harsh reality is that the majority will never get there. I say that because most podcasters aren't investing into their brand.   It takes money to make money. In all the podcast communities I continuously see the ""What mic can I get? I have a $15 budget"". I am not knocking them, but more so pointing out that a lot of people creating podcast shows are not committing or funding their position. So of course a huge survey is going to be mad at lack of audience and funding. I review podcast shows every day and I can easily say for every 1 show I think is going to do well, there is 20 that I don't."

podcasts,3dsv43,mountainlion88,2,Sun Jul 19 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of podcasts in my que and these are the best of the best as far as movies and tv go. There's a lot of other shows that I can mention that are more comedy based if you're interested.  Movie Podcasts  We Hate Movies: Four guys from New York talk about bad movies every week. A pretty standard format but I think they do it better than anyone. They've done over 200 episodes so there's a huge back-catalogue. It's not all on Itunes but all the older ones are on their website. I really recommend to start with any movie you've seen. I loved the Crystal Skull episode, Phantom Menace, Batman Forever and the Ewok Adventures episodes. They even have their own subreddit that they go to frequently /r/WeHateMovies  How Did This Get Made: This one is pretty popular so you've probably already heard of it. Another bad movie podcast. This was one of the first shows I ever started listening to and it's great if you like repeated catchphrases and the personalities of the hosts. I haven't listened in a few months, but I'm sure it's still a solid show.  Plumbing The Death Star: A bunch of Australian 20-somethings (or maybe New Zealand, I still can't tell half the time) talk about the theory behind movie universes. Stuff like when a toy actually becomes sentient in Toy Story, what medichlorians actually are, or how Thor cuts his hair. All around, very silly and fun but they make a lot of interesting points that are fun to think about.  Modern Myth Media: Superhero movie news! They usually have episodes out a day or so after news breaks and they always have something interesting to say about it, with speculation from their vast comic knowledge. Not usually very funny but hugely informative.  The Canon: Devin Farraci and Amy Nicholson choose a movie every week and debate about whether it should be part of the canon of classic films. Really heavy on debate so you spend a lot of time listening to them argue but I think they're both film critics/writers so they know their stuff. If you're willing to accept that maybe Gone With The Wind or Shawshank Redemption isn't a classic, then give them a listen.  Worst Idea Of All Time: This show is the diamond in the rough and it's absolute insanity. Two guys from Australia watched Grown Ups 2 and talked about it every week for a year. And they hated this fucking movie. It's crazy how much pain they put themselves through for something with no monetary value or anything. Then they decided to do it again with Sex and the City 2. They're about 20 episodes into ""season 2"". It's madness.  TV Podcasts  Scarlett Velocity: I love the CW Flash show and I've been looking for a good podcast aftershow about it since the season started around 8 months ago. I kind of gave up until I found this one. If you love Flash and want to hear in-depth conversation about each episode, they're solid.  The X-Files Files: Kumail Nanjiani (Indoor Kids Podcast and HBO's Sillicon Valley) talks about every episode of X-Files with a weekly guest. Kumail is really funny and obviously loves the show so it's an interesting podcast to listen to.  Worst Episode Ever: Two Simpsons fans watch a random episode of the show that they may or may not have seen, then rank them on their list in an effort to find the worst episode ever.  Shows I host  I've been hosting podcasts since February and I would be an idiot not to mention them but I would feel kind of scummy not giving a disclaimer saying they were mine. I didn't write this excessively long write-up just to plug my own shows but they do fit what you were looking for so check them out if you're interested.  The Adam Sandcast: We talk about a different Adam Sandler movie every week, chronologically making our way through his catalogue. I had a cohost for awhile but now have weekly guests I meet on Reddit. I recommend Reign Over Me or Chuck and Larry.  Cynical Cartoons Podcast: We talked about Rick and Morty for all of season one and now we've moved on to BoJack Horseman! We're even doing commentary tracks!"

podcasts,3drna0,CircusMaximo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"The problem I get is I constantly ask myself ""who cares what you think?"" And I just get discouraged. I'm not in the gaming or tech industry, I am not as informed on things as I like and I don't have the time to get involved as much as I would like. I just feel unqualified to give my opinion on a lot of things because I know a little about a lot but not a lot on anything."
podcasts,3drna0,CircusMaximo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Well a driving force behind doing a podcast is thinking people will be interested in what you have to say. If you don't have that, then I don't know what to tell you. You just gotta go for it and find out. Either do a podcast or don't."
podcasts,3drna0,zuluthrone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"You can't allow yourself to think that way. If this is a calling for you, you have to put your voice forward. Your product is your perspective, so you have to be fearless or else you'll be nothing.  For your initial question, figure out what makes you tick, what's your ""golden calf"" or the motivation behind your perspective. For Marc Maron it's depression and drugs, so he humbles himself to other performers to bring out their own sense of darkeness and humor. Chris Hardwick is a superfan and expresses his nerdy love for everything. I'm not at those guys' levels yet, but I've always struggled with self worth issues, so my line of questions on Comcastro very often broaches on that moment where you get out of your own way and take charge of your life. Figure out what you stand for first, and then apply that perspective to any subject that interests you. News items, upcoming films and games, history, books, whatever, as a solo speaker your first challenge is knowing what you are. Until then, exact content takes a back seat."
podcasts,3drna0,wagnike2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your time of podcast, but I will say that what makes a one man podcast good is reliability/freedom. You only have one person who has to make decisions and this always you a ton of freedom to change things as you see fit. Yes, you'll be doing more work, but it's also more rewarding in some ways too. At least in my opinion."
podcasts,3drna0,SoylentGreyGoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"My favourite one person podcast is the Geologic Podcast by George Hrab. He's a musician and a skeptic and those things make up a lot of his content, but he also does random stories from his life, regular comedy segments with characters and voices that he performs, and occasional guests from his life (i.e. his mom). The editing is a lot of work (multiple segment theme songs, etc) but he does it all with Garage Band."
podcasts,3drna0,DanielJLewis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:57:08 2015 UTC,"Two things are the most important:   Content—if you don't have good content, it won't matter who you are or how you share the content. Presentation—you need to be good at communicating. Great content can be presented horribly. Ensure the presentation fits the content."
podcasts,3drna0,AMPodcastNetwork,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"I usually record solo tracks and the first 2 can be rough because you don't want to be judged. You will be anyways and there isn't anything you can do about it. Like /u/CircusMaximo mentions, Bill Burr is great at it. I am sure when he was just starting out he felt nervous, but he is a prime example if you like his comedy. You need to find your passion, and nail it down. You don't want to create a show that goes in all directions otherwise people will pass on listening.  Decide on subject (tech, entertainment, history...etc), and then own it. Start brainstorming and getting the show ideas down that you want to produce. Re-record episodes that you don't like, but don't be a perfectionist. Anyone that does that will never make it out of the gate. Probably the biggest thing getting comfortable in your own skin."
