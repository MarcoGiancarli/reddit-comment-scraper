botany,3dzkdi,shockyamoney,4,Mon Jul 20 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for,but plants produce a hormone called auxin.    Auxin plays a role in a variety of plant functions and growth, but in the case of plants growing in the direction of sunlight, the higher hormone concentration causes cellular elongation on the darker side of the plant.  This cellular elongation causes the plant to lean toward the direction facing the sun.    To be lazy and quote wikipedia: ""The uneven distribution of auxin, due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, auxin governs the form and shape of plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction."""
botany,3dz7xr,ladymayhem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"A 5cm pot should be ok for the length of the experiment, and since it was supplied by the teacher, that is what they want you to use.  The first week or two, nothing much is going to happen, while the seeds start germination.  At 2 weeks old, either species should only be a few inches tall.  If you were growing these for the garden, I'd recommend a larger pot or planting singly, but since these are guinea pigs, no worries, just sow your seeds to each side, with as much room between as you can manage. I would put your experiment pots in a shallow pan or tupperware.  Sow your seeds, give them a good watering and then put the pots in your pan and then cover the whole thing with a thin, clear bag (like a trash pail liner) and seal the bag.  Leave the bag sealed until you see germination, then open the bag a little, and a little more over the course of a few days so they can get used to the lower humidity in your room.  Just taking the bag off all at once can cause shock, and kill your plantlings. You always want to water seedlings from the bottom.  Just put the pots in a pan of water and leave them there for a few minutes while the absorb a bit of water.  This helps with preventing ""damp-off"", which will kill seedlings in a matter of days.  To determine if they even need watering, stick your finger into the pot (without disturbing the seedlings), up to the first knuckle, and if the tip of your finger feels damp, then it doesn't need water.  If it is dry, then water. And no, both Basil and Marigolds need light and are considered ""Full Sun"" plants, meaning they need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight to be happy and healthy.  But they could grow under florescent lighting, if the light is close to the plants (think a handspan or so from the plant).  You can pick up a cheap light fixture at any hardware or lighting store, a fixture that holds a pair of t12's would do you fine and you should be able to find for under $20...  Good luck with your experiment.  :)"

botany,3dw2ie,Notdrugs,2,Mon Jul 20 01:04:39 2015 UTC,lol i'd love to reply with a picture but i don't know how. what's the easiest way to post a pic? i have a few.
botany,3dw2ie,Notdrugs,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"If youre on mobile, download the imgur app. Its a fairly easy process from there, no account nessicary and you can link to the album with a comment."

botany,3dw2ie,ComedyShow,0,Mon Jul 20 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"Looks like a fungal disease. Id apply a fungicide to the whole plant and plants nearby and see if that helped. It won't clear up the diseased leaves, but should stop it from spreading to the fresh leaves."
botany,3dw2ie,SquirrelTactic,2,Mon Jul 20 09:58:25 2015 UTC,"It could be nitrogen deficiency. Yellowing in old leaves is a sign of this. Nitrogen is a mobile nutrient, so when it's limiting, the plant moves it from the old leaves to the new leaves. That would be why it's only on the bottom half. Though it's hard to tell by a description alone."
botany,3dw2ie,SweaterFish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:04 2015 UTC,"I grow quite a bit of mint and pretty much without fail this happens to them at some point.  They start growing like crazy, if I don't use it in time the lower leaves will die off and the upper half or so is left, then after a while longer the rest of the plant dies. Whether or not this is true, I've just come to accept that's what mint does. When i see it happening i pinch the tips of some shoots and stick it in the dirt so it will regrow. Odd thing is, my chocolate mint doesn't do it."

botany,3df4d4,mercfh85,2,Wed Jul 15 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"They will compete. Even multiple clones of the exact same plant will compete. If they're identical in appearance though, you won't really notice. In my rock garden, I have a section where the first three sedum varieties I added all grow in close proximity. There's one very clear ""winner"" even though the other two are holding their own small pockets. I do occasionally pull out some of the most successful variety though to make sure it doesn't completely take over.  Even if you start with a single small cutting, the large mats that form will almost certainly consist of multiple smaller plants. As the plants spread horizontally, they will occasionally put down more roots where they can touch soil and some of these sections will likely get broken off over time, so they're clones of the same plant, but also completely separate."
botany,3df4d4,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:50:25 2015 UTC,"So even though everything is competing, one plant winning isn't going to just wipe out every entity of the neighboring plant? (I guess it goes for all groundcovers).......although Im sure some groundcovers def. strangle out weeds"
botany,3dcxdo,supralibris,2,Wed Jul 15 07:57:59 2015 UTC,"In general they're siblings, not twins."
botany,3dcxdo,up-quark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:26:41 2015 UTC,That is also what i learned. But then i don't understand. Is there several fertilized eggs in a fruit?
botany,3dcxdo,c_albicans,2,Wed Jul 15 12:31:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, the fruit usually contains multiple ova (eggs) that are fertilized by multiple sperm."
botany,3dcxdo,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, each individual seed is the result of a a different fertilized ovum."
