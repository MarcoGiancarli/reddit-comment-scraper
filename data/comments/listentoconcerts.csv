My sister was in college and was home for the summer. She wanted to go too, and my mom said she could if she brought me along. I had been listening to mellon collie quite a bit around that time and this was such a great first show to experience."

Wish I could have gotten to this earlier as who was broadcasting earlier represented a veritable ""Who's Who"" of the best of the modern psych folk / folk rock scene: Steve Gunn Jessica Pratt Ryley Walker Natalie Prass Ryley Walker  CHVRCHES will be playing tonite before Wilco (9:20pm ET), and they're just great. Happy listening.  PS: Wilco dropped a bomb new album last night. Which you can listen to / download. Right now. For free."

They really pulled out the stops on this one, inviting every all-star that the festival had to offer (including the bountiful talents of Nels Cline, Bill Frisell, Glenn Kotche, Ryley Walker, and more).  Outstanding performance."
