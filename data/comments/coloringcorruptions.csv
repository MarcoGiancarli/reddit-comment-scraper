coloringcorruptions,31bhz2,DatBrony,0,Sat Apr 4 03:35:52 2015 UTC,It's been an 11 month hiatus since season 4. I first started watching the show just 4 months ago and I'll have watched the series 3 times through by the end of today. Step up your game son.
coloringcorruptions,31bhz2,TheTraegs,12,Sat Apr 4 06:02:29 2015 UTC,"Honest question. What's the appeal of this show to the older crowd? The ""bronies"", if you will.   I'm not hating or being sarcastic, I'm genuinely curious."
coloringcorruptions,31bhz2,joZeizzle,7,Sat Apr 4 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"It's just a fun and entertaining show, for me at least. I'm not a super hardcore fan or anything, more of a casual viewer, but I enjoy it a lot. It's well written, the voice acting's really good, and the animation is superb. It's surprisingly good, and I'm saying this as someone who's hated everything My Little Pony all his life."
coloringcorruptions,31bhz2,SupaKoopa714,6,Sat Apr 4 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"It's very well written. Each character has a unique personality, flaws included. It uses an adult vocabulary and is funny without being dumb like some other cartoons. There's plenty of pop culture references too, one of my favorites is seeing pony-ized versions of the characters from The Big Lebowski.  I never thought I would have enjoyed it until I started watching it myself. Before then I pretty much asked the same kind of questions that you're asking right now.  If you're interested in watching it, the 2 part finale of season 2 is often recommended as a good introduction to the show. It won't reflect the the show as a whole though, most of the mid season episodes are slice of life instead of action adventure."
coloringcorruptions,31bhz2,TheTraegs,4,Sat Apr 4 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"It makes me happy. There's not a whole bunch of high quality shows that stay light and happy without being purely comedic. What makes this stand out from the shit that is most kids programs is the high quality flash animation, awesome voice acting, and general care put into it. It feels really well made, and the lore is weirdly consistent, for a show about talking horses. It's not for everyone tho, and if you need high quality plots, or are embarrassed easily (hell, I still can't watch it with anyone else), I can see why you wouldn't like it. If you're a fan of adventure time or avatar, I'd certainly give it a shot."

coloringcorruptions,2xz6ta,Hawkings_WheelChair,15,Thu Mar 5 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"The ""sequals"" seem to be more like ""a second and third level.""  Are we so used to short content and DLC that this doesn't seem weird?"
coloringcorruptions,2xz6ta,frankxanders,14,Thu Mar 5 06:24:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the game mechanics have been varied enough and they're each reasonably priced (can buy all three on Steam for about $23 right now). Telltale Games follows the a similar model with that intention from the start and I have not seen nearly as many complaints about that. Ultimately, the time and enjoyment I've received from the games has been worth the cost.  That said, I understand it's not for everybody and it receives skepticism for its quick releases. Now that the story seems to be complete (for the most part) I don't imagine we'll be seeing more games in this franchise for a while, if at all. I believe Scott has said what he has wanted to say about the world he has created and wants to leave the rest for the fans to expand upon with their own fan games and creations."
coloringcorruptions,2xz6ta,waltonky,3,Thu Mar 5 10:03:17 2015 UTC,You can't really compare Telltale Games with Friday Night at Freddies...
coloringcorruptions,2xz6ta,MameFrame,10,Thu Mar 5 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's absolutely ridiculous that Telltale Games gets away with it given how much more has to go into programming and creating it. It's almost like they complete it and intentionally withhold their product, like a drug dealer stringing you along for the next hit just so they can take another $5 from you. /s  I think you missed my point though. I'm not comparing their substance. I'm comparing their release models. Of course Telltale Games has higher quality games, seeing as they have over 200 employees compared to the single developer behind Five Nights."

coloringcorruptions,2xz6ta,Ainrana,4,Thu Mar 5 05:38:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair, these games don't look like they take that long to program. It's all made by one guy only. Not to say that they don't take any time to make, but you get the idea."
coloringcorruptions,2xz6ta,waltonky,3,Thu Mar 5 05:51:06 2015 UTC,"In addition, I believe Scott stated that he got better at programming them as he went.

I'd grow all sorts of things, broccoli coli flower, e. coli, and various organs and glands and such. Fwufufufufufu, so one day, as i as watering my plants with a blood mixture (a tad thicker than hers. she seems to have a water based additive. Skank. Actually no she's not. I'd garden with her. It would feel very refreshing once more, like a renewed breath of air.), I came across this stem cells that had naturally formed between the soil and my plants, my bbs. I'm just like 'Yusss'.  Anyway, I take a same back to my room and use it as lubricant to jerk off to the best mental image of my knowledge the impersonation James Bond spittin his game as done by Scarlett Johansson. Shit's so money baby it's the shit its just so fucking money baby ya know? I nut hard. HARD. Fuck it felt like 2cumz all in the sheets. Hotels shure as shit aint cleaning this. But all in a split millisecond, I had an epiphany; I must bare a child in my life. Without a moments notice I throw my cum and stem cells in a test tube i have casually sitting around like it's no ones business.   Over time as the child developed, I learned a sooper fascinating fact: the test tube baby was a girl! I'm like 'Fuck I really wanted a som, But it's chill tho, I'll live.' This thing grew up into a young beautiful adult. Obviously fucking disobedient little fucking shit fuck. But sweet deep down. I know one thing though, she always enjojyed gardening with her father in her little white rag tied around her short, blonde locks. Just like her father."

When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.  Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee, Said tell me where your strength lies if you please. She spoke so kind and she talked so fair, Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.  You can shave my head, clean as my hand And my strength will become as natural as any old man.  If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way, I would tear this old building down.  You read about Samson, all from his works, He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth. One day when Samson was walking along, Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.  He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread, When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.  If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way, I would tear this old building down.  Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack, Samson he crawled up on the lion's back. You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws, But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.  He ripped the beast till he killed him dead. The bees made honey in the lion's head.  If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way, I would tear this old building down."

coloringcorruptions,2n8iec,VAPossum,4,Mon Nov 24 18:30:16 2014 UTC,Did you know that Shirley Temple was originally cast for the part of Dorothy. However the part was given to Judy Garland for various reasons.
coloringcorruptions,2n8iec,Reddit_Executive,9,Mon Nov 24 18:52:18 2014 UTC,"Because in her teens Shirley Temple was pretty much discarded by Hollywood. The execs felt that people wouldn't comprehend a Shirley Temple who wasn't a living baby doll with an adorable speech impediment. There was no history of movie star children growing up on screen as there is today. It's something of a shame, too, as Shirley grew up to be drop-dead gorgeous. I'll hunt up a photo for proof.  Edit: Here you go. It's not the best example I've seen, but it gives some idea of how pretty she was as a young adult."

Initially a utilitarian garment, it first grew a long partly decorative tail behind, and then developed into a complex, versatile and expensive headgear after what was originally the vertical opening for the face began to be used as a horizontal opening for the head. It was especially fashionable in mid-15th century Burgundy, before gradually falling out of fashion in the late 15th century and returning to its utilitarian status.

coloringcorruptions,2ar7u4,CrayonsForBrains,14,Tue Jul 15 12:04:00 2014 UTC,Your shading with crayons is astounding. I can never get my crayons to behave nicely when I'm trying to destroy cute little critters in generic coloring books. What's the secret? Do you have a built-in sharpener or something?!
coloringcorruptions,2ar7u4,sayfuzzypickles,9,Tue Jul 15 15:13:54 2014 UTC,"I'm not the person you asked, but I like to think I know my way around a crayon, so I'll give you my answer. First off, these are the crayons I usually use. When I shade a big light-medium value area I don't rotate the crayon at all, so a big flat side develops, with a nice sharp edge (the twist up crayons are great for developing the sharp edge without getting a round top). Then I go in for some harder pressure on what I want to be darkest, and as the sharp edge starts to flatten out the color fades, giving you a nice gradient.   Also, ideally I like about a quarter inch of paper behind the page Im coloring. Too much and you might not be able to get any sharp lines, but too little and your shading looks harsh."
coloringcorruptions,2ar7u4,Skim74,1 point,Wed Jul 16 00:12:25 2014 UTC,"Twisty crayons!! What will they think of next?! But yeah, both you and CrayonsForBrains both go with the flat edge method, which I have no idea why I never thought to do that. Thank you both!  And yes! I usually put a few sheets of paper behind whatever I'm coloring. It helps me keep an even tone. I'm going to give crayons another shot and see how it goes. Appreciate the input!"
coloringcorruptions,2ar7u4,sayfuzzypickles,6,Wed Jul 16 14:01:06 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the compliment! I actually just use regular old Crayola crayons, and sharpen them with this.   As Skim74 mentioned in their post, I tend to color so a flat side develops. But mainly I'd say the biggest issue most people have is they color entirely too hard with crayons. If you want to do shading, start by filling the area lightly, then press harder in the areas where you'd like to shade. Start at the edge you want darkest, then work you way in while letting off pressure to blend up to the lighter shade.   I think the next most important is to keep an even pressure while coloring. For me this means I lock my wrist when I color and use my forearm to move the crayon. This makes it easy to both color in one direction, and maintain an even pressure so you don't get stray dark marks.  Lastly, I don't find it's extremely important to always color in one direction. The benefit of coloring most parts lightly is you can change direction and it's not that noticeable.

Once signed in, upload your before and after images. Next touch the menu icon (three horizontal lines) and select Albums. There should be a + sign or button to add an album. Select that. Enter the title and description if you'd like one, then select the images you'd like to be in the album (your before and after picture). Then save.  You should be back on the albums screen, if not return to it using the method from before. Simply touch the album you want. When the album opens there should be a link at the top of the screen. Touch and hold the link to copy the address. Now go to our Reddit submit page and touch and hold in the link box. It should allow you to paste the link you just copied. Voila!  Hopefully that works for you =) Let me know if you need more help.  Edit: Just to clarify the app you want is called Imgur"
