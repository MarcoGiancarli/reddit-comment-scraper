thatHappened,3dyaj0,CanadianX_XBacon,87,Mon Jul 20 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"it's from the story that happened the most of any story ever told.    Does evil exist?   The university professor challenged his students with this question.     Did God create everything that exists?     A student bravely replied, ""Yes, he did!""   ""God created everything? The professor asked.   ""Yes sir"", the student replied.   The professor answered, ""If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil"". The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.   Another student raised his hand and said, ""Can I ask you a question professor?""   ""Of course"", replied the professor.   The student stood up and asked, ""Professor, does cold exist?""   ""What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?"" The students snickered at the young man's question.   The young man replied, ""In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.""   The student continued, ""Professor, does darkness exist?""   The professor responded, ""Of course it does.""   The student replied, ""Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.""   Finally the young man asked the professor, ""Sir, does evil exist?""   Now uncertain, the professor responded, ""Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.""   To this the student replied, ""Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.""   The professor sat down.   The young man's name — Albert Einstein"

Judging by the sheer amount of these despairing guys, I conclude that there is a significant amount of men out there who believe that women do actually want to date the arseholes, and that the best way to a woman's heart and/or pants is to be a colossal jerk.  The sad thing is that the question in itself is flawed, but none of these poor saps stop and think about it for a moment. Women don't ""want the jerkass guys."" Most women are, at some point in their lives, attracted to such a set of qualities in a man that it's quite likely that said man will be a jerk. But to claim that women actively seek out those jerks, that the jerkassery is the attractive part, is like saying that men chase after bras. Men don't want bras, they want what's in them. An immature kid can get really excited and rub one out at the sight of an empty bra, too. He usually grows out of it."
thatHappened,3dy34u,Cykuta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:59:36 2015 UTC,"redpillers would say women don't know what they want. And if they tell one thing, it is most likely the other way round. And if there is one thing that is true among all that TRP misogynistic bullshit they spout everyday, it is this.  Now, not to disregard your opinion, I think they just simplified it too much. I doubt anything is that simple in human's psychology, including sexual preferences. Assholes tend to show more domination and women love it, so they think they need to become assholes, instead of improving their own attitude towards themselves, not just women. Basically they are ""cheating"" their character. Instead of dominating women (or learning how to do it without being passive aggressive douche), they think shaming them and calling them names makes them alpha. But they are all just same old average chumps who just found out the truth that life isn't all like in books."

Their claim is that they are drawn to them and unaware of it.  There are women who are, but the redpillers generalize it to all women.  Truth is, women like that usually grow out of it, just like immature guys who seek vacuous hotties grow out of that as well. Neither of these behaviors are even immature, in general, for the age at which they do these things.  When you get older you get tired of both types of people and just want someone you have a lot in common with.

thatHappened,3dqgo3,Comicbook-girl,16,Sat Jul 18 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"This is baseball. A game historically derived from rounders and a bit similar to cricket.  This guy happens to be a man named Dan Majerle who is another professional athlete (basketball). At every team's stadium, there are different accommodations and seatings and features. This stadium belongs to the Arizona Diamondback team. At this stadium, in center field, there are pools. Check this out. This special area is probably rented out or reserved to big parties and people who want to host events. I assume Dan, or his friend or family, reserved that area for a game.   In the GIF, Dan happened to be watching the game and a baseball was hit into the centerfield area. The ball bounced on the grass and hopped over the fence and amazingly into Dan's hand which happened to be raised. It was completely unexpected and you can see the look of shock and surprise on this face.   This was suppose to be a play on OP's post where the tumblr poster wrote that a girl flew across the bus and was caught without thinking. I found this GIF to be a bit analogous to that post.  Let me know if you have any additional questions! You can reach me at 415-634-****   Edit: Here is the original clip"
thatHappened,3dqgo3,deadfermata,5,Sat Jul 18 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! I got your context for posting the gif, and yes, I laughed, but then when I kept watching I got more and more confused.  Brilliant explanation. Those pools man, you can pay a shit ton of money for prime seating at a UK football match and the most you get is a prawn sandwich (an old reference). Those pools are just...WOW.  (゜-゜)！"
thatHappened,3dqgo3,Comicbook-girl,5,Sat Jul 18 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"Football is crazy popular around the world. I bet it makes most sense to create as much seating potential for UK Football matches because it brings in more revenue. Pack more people into a game.   Baseball is less concerned about that. A stadium generally seats between 30-40,000 and not every game is sold out as there are more than 160 games in a season. In order to appeal to the crowd and get people to the game, teams may have different fun areas to make the experience more 'family oriented' rather than try and pack as many people into a given space!   (•∋•)"
thatHappened,3dqgo3,deadfermata,4,Sat Jul 18 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"Very cool, it does look fun. I used to be a steward a (small) football stadium and they say they are all about family these days but nothing, absolutely nothing, says ""family"" in those places. You had to turn sideways to use the ladies loo, like the toilet was an afterthought, no way you could change a baby's nappy in there.  Just dismal places. The only thing that made you smile would be the one old gran, there every week with her flask of tea, sitting contentedly and cheering like fuck at a goal: you know she'd been there for 20+ years and would be there still in 10. I loved those women. That's as family as it gets, small children just run around bored or stand with their ears covered because it's too noisey.   Not the best job in the world but it was cash monies so..."

Its meaning is accurate and fair, and it has all the correct historical and contextual associations.

But even if some ""modern"" definition allows simple violent destruction, that still doesn't apply to throwing trash at picnicking families.   OP's link does not paint a picture of ""mayhem"". It does paint a picture of ""mischief"". The words have phonetic similarities, but they don't mean the same thing."

thatHappened,3dkina,Vittali,45,Fri Jul 17 07:46:56 2015 UTC,"Found the text by googling some parts that were legible.  It's two separate stories from random posts on reddit.  The top part is:  One day in college, the teacher had stapled answer sheets to the back of every test by mistake. A few minutes after passing the tests around, his phone rang and he stepped out. Everyone had noticed the answer sheet, and we decided that we would all use it and tear it off after. Hopefully he would never notice. So I checked each of the answers and they were all correct except for the last one. We were to draw a flow chart for a process. I checked the answer sheet, ""answers will vary."" I drew my flow chart, tore off the answer sheet and walked to the front podium to turn the test in. When I got to the podium I had to know. I needed to see what everyone else had drawn for their flow chart. ""answers will vary."" Everyone had written that on their tests. I don't remember what the teacher did about it.  The bottom part:  Highschool, Jr. Year. First day of class. Teacher walks in, it's an older wrinkly guy with a stache. A little weird looking. His shirt is only tucked in on one side. Every one is just getting the wrong vibe from this guy. Like, he's not all there in the head. He's got a manic look in his eyes. He's creepy. He starts going through attendance, not looking up the whole time. Then he gets to my name. Starts to say it, then stops. Looks up, scans the room, looks directly at me. ""Ah, Mr. 102194, I'm glad you're here. How's your family? Is your little sister still playing the piano? Is that model ship still on your dresser? Is your room still blue?"" I'm shocked, mortified. I can't find the words to respond, this creeper has just described my family, and the fucking room I sleep in at night. ""Ah, of course it is, it's only been what? A week?"" Then he goes back to attendance. Panics were had that day. But anyway, the next day I find out the old crazy guy is my uncles best friend, and they and my dad decided to pull a prank on me for my first day. The teacher wasn't so crazy looking the rest of the year, he shaved the pedo stache (which he grew specifically for the prank, apparently), dressed better, stopped making his eye twitch, etc. I have to admit, it was a good prank, even if I was terrified of being murdered for a day or two."

I'm curious - clearly, you have a lot of personality types down to a science - do any of these trickle into your personal life? How do you maintain a normal life with probably many attached suitors?"
thatHappened,3dkina,VoilaVoilaWashington,4,Fri Jul 17 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"I started out looking for a sugar daddy to help me in grad school eventually and using a sugar site to do it, with the full intention of picking up fake sugar daddies (ie escort work) from the site until I got a real SD.   I learned a whole lot on my own through trial and error, and also talked at length with other workers.  I was always kinky and well-versed in BDSM and safety and whatnot, and many of my clients wanted kink, so I began finding safe ways to add that in.  Other clients wanted me to connect with them via cam, so I started doing that.   As far as personal life:  I was already polyamorous. When I started I was in a relationship with two other people and had their full support (we were all assigned female at birth, but we all identify as gender queer, but picture us as looking like lesbian archetypes. I was femmish, one was boyish, the other super butch). We all lived together and it was an open triad. But I left for totally unrelated reasons.   Now, back on the market, it's hard to find butch lesbian partners who meet all these criteria: 1. exist, because butch women are a dying breed, 2. not be whorephobic, 3. be poly friendly, 4. be kink friendly, 5. not be a femme hater.  So, while I really like butch women, my current lifestyle lends itself towards other people types. So it affected me in that way. But then it turned out not to matter. I have a really cool and supportive girlfriend-ish person, and she is feminine but the connection feels like the connection I usually have with masculine people. And she is nerdy and not high femme or anything. She is totally poly friendly. We spend hours and hours just talking and chatting. And while at first I thought I would really want a girlfriend to be butch, now I realize I don't care at all.   I also have a very close/almost romantic relationship with my ex husband. We love each other deeply and are best friends but are never, ever, ever getting back together or having sex again. We hang out as often as besties would. The relationship ended because of his addiction issues, but when he is sober we make each other extremely happy. He's been sober 6 months now. He is supportive but glad he's not actually married to an escort.   I'm also living rent-free in a house with a really awesome sugar daddy is who not deluded at all about the situation, has great boundaries, is interesting to talk to, and let's me have my own room plus a monthly stipend. And I'm using his truck for free right now, until I buy a new one after my last was totaled. It's easy to make time to work because we live together.   Beyond him I have a few regular escorting clients. They don't expect me to be a girlfriend at all to them. So time-wise it's just like having a coffee date with friends.   My least fav part of the job was screening new clients, so I'm super happy to not do that anymore. It could use up 40 hours in a week. Now I don't really have to work at that, so it gives me a lot of time for meeting with partners and clients. We will see what happens when grad school starts though. I may have to cut some clients out.   Basically I recommend it if you can do it but it's month of shitty, shitty work until you figure out how to do it right and protect your mental health."

Scene also takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War. This scene may be changed depending on the outcome of Captain America: Civil War.  The scene shows an overhead of New York City, Times Square. Its late night time, as a packed party at a club is taking place. Terrell is seen coming out of a rest room. Terrell then hears some chatter from a private room. A club guard blocking the door stops Terrell. Terrell then pulls out his SHIELD badge, he always carries with him, even though he’s no longer with SHIELD. The guard however doesn’t know this. The guard steps outside, and as the guard is turning his attention away from Terrell, Terrell knocks the guard out cold. Terrell then slowly creeps the door open.  Inside is a meeting between SHIELD and Hydra. There appears to be an individual who is part of neither party in  the meeting as well. It appears to be some type of black market meeting.  Individual: ::pulls out metal case:: In this case is an object of amazing power.  Hydra agent: Power that belongs to Hydra  SHIELD agent: another piece to SHIELD’s artillery  Terrell: (so they both want to use whatever is in that case as a weapon).  The unknown individual lays the metal case flat on a table, and then opens it.  SHIELD agent: what is it?  Hydra agent: what does it do?  Individual: This object can control time. It can speed up time, slow down time and even freeze time. It is called the Infinity Time Stone.  Hydra agent: can it reverse time?  SHIELD agent: Why so that Hydra can alter history?  Terrell: (if Hydra and SHIELD get their hands on that they will use it as a weapon) ::creeps his finger into room and turns out the lights::  Terrell then sneaks in the room, and closes the door behind him. Terrell then attacks the Hydra and SHIELD agents in the room. Terrell is also able to knock out the host of the black market in the process. Eventually the lights turn back on, and the SHIELD and Hydra agents, some unconscious, and some moaning in pain. The host of the event, his eyes blurry, as Terrell stands over him. Terrell then knocks the host of the event unconscious.  The scene then goes to Terrell feet as he starts walking. Terrell then stops walking and picks up an object off the floor. The camera follows Terrell as he stands up. Terrell then turns around towards the camera, puts his right index finger towards his lip, giving the audience a signal to shh.

thatHappened,3d8jrw,talienfey,36,Tue Jul 14 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"While I'll agree with you that choosing ""natural cures"" over real medical treatment isn't really smart, I think you've got some fairly unrealistic expectations from people making a very difficult emotional choice. While cancer treatments are improving at a pretty amazing rate, a lot of the time they're still very scary and have some pretty big side effects. It's not really a case of ""you're dying, take this medicine and you'll live"", it's more ""you're dying, take this medicine and hopefully we can protract it enough that it'll be worth the associated side effects"". Even when the treatments are comparatively mild, I think there's a lot of stigma (partially built up by how cancer survival stories always show how badly the subject withered under chemo or whatever) that makes it easy to assume the worst.  So on the one hand you've got a doctor who is honest and has realistic expectations telling you you're dying anyway, but his treatment will hopefully save you and almost certainly decrease your quality of life, possibly permanently, and there's a chance it may not work anyway. On the other hand, the homeopath who is being dishonest (probably with himself too, not just you) tells you that if you drink this special milkshake 3 times a day, you'll certainly be cured, and in fact you'll feel better than you did before, and it's Nature! which automatically makes it Better!  Obviously, one choice is more rational than the other, but don't forget this is a previously healthy person who's just found out that they're wasting away in their prime and the best they can do is mitigate it. I think in all of us there's that tiny part of our brain that eyes the lottery ticket machines on our way out of the gas station every day - usually our better judgement keeps that voice firmly in check, but when you're under enough pressure it can find the strength to take control and start making decisions that have nothing to do with reason and everything to do with hope."

thatHappened,3d4wqf,Toribor,9,Tue Jul 14 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"Just did some research. Ethanol freezes at -173°F (-78°C). Assuming that the vodka is a typical 80 proof that means it's 40% ABV. Minus the distilled flavors most of the remaining liquid is water. This means it would freeze at about -15.79°F (-26.55°C) according to the Molal Freezing Point Depression Constant.  Since most freezers should be set to 0°F (-18°C) it would need to be quite a bit colder to freeze the alcohol under ideal conditions, let alone the fact that any impurities (i.e. the flavors of the vodka) would actually lower the freezing point further. Alcohol thickens as it cools, but even if it were much closer to this temperature and it were a pure ethanol/water solution it would unlikely be in a solid form, more just a syrupy liquid. In other words this is bullshit."

According to Wikipedia New Orleans and the surrounding parish is 350 square miles and 80% of that was covered in water ranging between 3ft and 10ft deep.  Lets take the low end and say all of that 80% that was covered with water was covered in 3ft of water (280sq miles).  So covering 280sq miles with 36in of water  17.38mil x280 x36 = 175,190,400,000 gallons of water  175,190,400,000 x 16 = 2,803,046,400,000 cups of water  Converted back to where 1 cup = 100%  The Gods would've given you 280,304,640,000,000% or 280.3 trillion percent when they rained down and flooded with Katrina  Lets not even get into the rest of the Gulf Coast and the widespread flooding caused there. That adds a metric fuckton to our total. We are only talking about rainfall and flooding in New Orleans and surrounding parish.  I probably made a mistake somewhere along the line, oh well.  I think the water gods gave you way way more than you asked for  Edit: I quadrillioned when I should've trillioned"

Saying that men shouldn't hit on women at inappropriate times is fine.  Celebrating every instance where a women acts like a raging bitch to a man kinda isn't.  I've heard these same stories about men approaching women when both are customers, or at bars/clubs, bus stops, grocery stores, etc, etc, etc.  Even pointing out to him ""I don't think it's appropriate for you to hit on your customers"" would have been okay.  But, no, she's as bitchy as possible and everybody is supposed to lionize her for it.   3) It's ridiculous to expect a person to give you personal information just because you walked up and asked for it.   Hey remember that time you were too stupid to understand the difference between ""expecting a person to give you personal information just because you walked up and asked for it"" and ""expecting people not to be unnecessarily rude and abrasive""?  I do.   I think you'd be more careful about what you said to me if we were standing in the same room together.

That's a story for another day.  Anyway, I was given the last meal option while on death row. That's when I hatched a plan. I used my phone a friend option to make a secret call to John P Papa John. I told him I would be ordering from his store for a last meal. So I told him to sneak in a gun, a skeleton key for the whole prison, his corporate credit card, and a key to the Papa Johns helicopter in the calzone I was going to order.  When they gave me my meal, I looked at the guard, gave him a wry smile and said ""It's time to blow this popsicle stand"".  I punched a hole right in the calzone and grabbed the gun and shot the guard in the face. Well, stupid Papa John didn't put a silencer on the gun so all the guards heard it.   Long story short, there was an epic fire fight and without having to reload once I shot and killed all 42 guards with either a 360 no scope or a headshot.

thatHappened,3cp4vc,CirqueKid,6,Fri Jul 10 06:18:59 2015 UTC,"Hey gramps, school today isn't anything like it was back in the 60s.  Kids need to cram their heads full of standardized test information so that the school is funded well and the administrators can bring home bigger paychecks, there is a lot of shit on the line.  Then if there is any time left, they need to worry about preparing for college and learning real world skills.  Unfortunately, that less important stuff usually becomes the 3.5 hours of homework per night the average high school student has.  You really can't blame a kid for sneaking a nap in whenever he can, it's hard not to if you want to have things like a social life, or a part time job, or if you do athletics."
thatHappened,3cp4vc,il0vedrugs,8,Fri Jul 10 04:56:06 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting the 3.5 hours figure from? I took APUSH, AP Lang, and Physics this past semester and did not have nearly that much homework. A lot of the people that I know really do go to bed at an unreasonable time because they put off larger assignments until 9 or 10 o'clock the night before they're due. That, or they stay up til 2 or 3 on Reddit/Instagram/Twitter, which is my issue. It's not impossible to have a social life if all you have to worry about is school, but I see how that could be difficult if you had a job as well."
thatHappened,3cp4vc,BellyButtonBob,4,Fri Jul 10 05:35:18 2015 UTC,"Took it from a study I saw a couple years ago, I'd have to google it if you want a source.  I think regular level classes actually assign more homework.  I don't have any research to verify that, but I always took honors and AP classes when I was in high school.  My sister took regular classes and she always had much more homework than me.  It seemed like they assigned them a lot of simple, time consuming homework to drill the concepts into their heads.  Personally, I usually completed my homework really efficiently, but I also tried to work smarter rather than harder.  I would just skip assignments that I knew had a minimal impact on my grade if they were too inconvenient to complete.  I probably wouldn't have had to do that if I wasn't working 25 hours a week, but it didn't hurt my grades, so I can't complain.  I took a lot of naps during classes myself and it never affected my grades because I got my work done, although I'd occasionally get detention for it.  I never took three AP classes in one semester, though.  That sounds like a hell of a work load."

thatHappened,3cp4vc,BellyButtonBob,2,Fri Jul 10 06:10:38 2015 UTC,"What did you expect the teacher to do? Give you a complete outline of each midterm and final? The names of the tests themselves give you exactly what concepts could be on them. If you aren't prepared, it's your own fault."
thatHappened,3cp4vc,JonJonFTW,2,Fri Jul 10 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"There were 8 chapters on the midterm and 12-14 on the final. A study guide or any idea of what would be on the test would have been nice instead of having to guess which formulas and concepts would be on it.  Edit: the names of the tests were Physics Midterm and Physics Final, so the names of those tests didn't help"
thatHappened,3cp4vc,BellyButtonBob,3,Fri Jul 10 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"What I meant by that was, on a midterm you could be tested on anything from the first half of the course, and on a final you could be tested on anything from the entire course. That sounds obvious, but some people don't study for them effectively by keeping those in mind.  When studying for a final where you aren't given what concepts you'll be tested on, you have to learn how to figure out what was most important. This is essential in University or College (at least in my case). They won't give you an exam review that outlines it. Hell no. Profs don't give a shit. They expect you to look back at the course and study the harder calculation problems. I guarantee you,  every major concept covered before you write a midterm or final, will have at least one calculation-based problem, and it won't be one of the easier ones. All it comes down to is studying these problems. As much as people complain ""Wow, that one question came out of nowhere! We didn't learn that!"", it's never true.  As far as formulas go, I've never heard of a physics class where you aren't allowed a formula sheet. I guess the teacher expects you to memorize them. I don't think that's fair, but that's life, I guess. If you have a formula sheet, then more often than not you can assume what formula you need based on the values they give you. That should only be a last resort, though."

The universal applause was loud enough to snap me out of my drunken state, but also the fact that I pretty much sweat out any booze in me when the judge handed me a duffel bag full of $100% bills and bars made completely out of vibranium (the material Captain America's shield is made out of).   After stumbling out of the courtroom, duffel bag in tow I decided to call an Uber taxi home since I was still pretty buzzed and trying to take in what just happened. Well, after waiting an hour and getting pissed that my ride didn't show I realized I had dialed the wrong number. As soon as I was getting ready to toss my phone in rage the rushing gust of wind from a stealth aircraft whizzed by me and who else but Barack Obama backflips out and parachutes down with a grin on his face asking me ""you called for a ride home""?   Dumbfounded that I drunk dialed the president of all people in the world I hopped in and he took me back home and in his aircraft we had our own rec room with blackjack and hookers and everything! Let's just say I'm not a vigin anymore ;) Once he dropped me off he tossed the keys at me and said ""here, just make sure you take care of her"". My jaw dropped as I realized that a military stealth aircraft costing millions was just handed to me like pocket change! I thanked Obama with tears in my eyes as I asked how he'll be getting home without the aircraft. He just winked and smiled as he said ""I have my ways"", as proceeded to evaporate, turn into a cloud, and fly back to where I assume would be the White House. That had to be 2nd craziest thing that ever happened to me, right under discovering this subreddit."

What more likely happened:  1) a teacher caught him beating up the white kid.  2) he actually really hurt the white kid, like bad enough that they had to go get medical attention.

However, he really didn't say anything too outlandish, just that no one cared when he fought black kids, but they did when he fought a white kid.  It doesn't sound like this white kid wanted a fight, he just wanted to make fun of an asian, and in my experience people who don't want a fight are likely to tell a teacher or something.  He called his confrontations with the black kids, ""scraps,"" though, which would imply that it was a fight with mutual participation, so those kids won't snitch.  Therefore I agree with you, I have no reason to believe this story isn't true, other than the fact that it is a story on the internet with no evidence."

The average reader will infer every time then that you have meant to imply that they no longer play in the woods.  Further evidence is found later in your post when you mention "", things in the wilderness aren't clean,"" and ""Don't know why I'm still alive, some of the things I did as a kid.""  While, again, those statements in themselves aren't saying in black and white that children no longer play in the woods, they are offered in such a tone that the reader is to conclude that children no longer play in the woods, and that this may be for the best, considering how you 'almost died'.

Once the song was identified as “Black Dog,” he regurgitated his reply while picking at the acne scars on the tip of his nose.  Well, Mister Man. Let me tell you a thing or two. There was no way in hell I was gonna let some wet behind the ears punk try to shut me down by relying on his new fangled interweb phone thing-a-ma-jiggy.   I swiftly snatched his phone from his hand and asked him to identify the next song. He damn near shat his pants while struggling to formulate a response.   “Umm, is this “Beth” by KISS?” he sheepishly asked.  Pardon my language if there are any ladies reading this, but I went completely shithouse on this little prick wearing his Danzig shirt.  “Beth? For fuck’s sake! It’s the live version of “Rock & Roll All Night” from KISS “Alive;” track 15 from side four of their double album! They even say the words “Rock & Roll All Night” repeatedly throughout the entire song!”  At this point, all of the pissy old farts in the store had gathered around us and they started applauding.

thatHappened,3cgdn8,whollycoley,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"Episiotomy:       An episiotomy (/əˌpiːziːˈɒtəmiː/ or /ɛˌpəsaɪˈɒtəmiː/), also known as perineotomy, is a surgical incision of the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall generally done by a midwife or obstetrician during second stage of labor to quickly enlarge the opening for the baby to pass through. The incision, which can be done at a 90 degree angle from the vulva towards the anus or at an angle from the posterior end of the vulva (medio-lateral episiotomy), is performed under local anesthetic (pudendal anesthesia), and is sutured closed after delivery. It is one of the most common medical procedures performed on women, and although its routine use in childbirth has steadily declined in recent decades, it is still widely practiced in many parts of the world including Latin America, Poland, Bulgaria, India and Qatar.  Episiotomy can be avoided by 'birth canal widening' performed before the start of labour and achieving a 10 cm opening to the birth canal so the baby's head can pass through easily. This can be achieved safely and painlessly by antenatal perineal massage since 1984 which does not cause a wound which can become infected. Cochrane Collaborate Report  a report produced by the collaboration of specialists of 120 countries, have since 2006 advised that women should be informed about the benefits of Antenatal Perineal massage or Birth Canal Widening, as episiotomy can be avoided. The risk of losing greater than 1 liter of blood during childbirth, which is called Post Partum Haemorrhage (PPH), increases with all doctor induced intervention, including episiotomy, forceps and Caesarean section. So, by avoiding the surgeon's knife, the risk of death from PPH decreases.

I figured from meeting and talking to her straight away that it was about something vastly different than just being drawn to traditional soft womanly stuff or a desire for other people to see her as a lady, because a biological female who looked and dressed like my friend does would be mistaken for, and regarded as a guy, right? At first deep down in my head I was like ""well, why bother, you could be and do all that as a guy and not be cast out by your conservative family and spend a fortune on surgeries... How could it be worth that when you don't even get the fancy dresses and shit?"". (I realise that sounds naive and shallow, and it was).

The major difference between transgender and genderfluid is that transgender takes on both the physical and emotional components of a gender in a definite manner -- once you go trans, you don't go back. In terms of clothing, a trans person would go ""I used to wear baggy sweats when I was a man, but it's still perfectly fine with me wearing baggy sweats as a woman. There's nothing wrong with women wearing these kinds of clothes.""  Gender fluid on the other hand just cherry picks components it likes from different genders whenever it suits them. There's no commitment to other genders, so it's basically a fashion choice; ""Today I feel fat so I'm going to wear all baggy sweats like a dude"", or ""I'm wearing baggy sweats so I must be a dude today""."

So maybe gender fluid people can be a thing and are just still figuring things out? Although when I see posts like this it seems more like someone who wants attention.   The only thing from the episode that interesting was he took some IQ style tests,  some which women score better on and some that men score better on.

But even so, talking about things like this the way I see so many people doing (as in trashing it and making it sound like anyone who claims they're genderfluid or non-binary in any way is a terrible stupid person) is only going to make people figuring themselves out feel worse. Kids discovering themselves and deciding what gender they really are, they might go through ""phases"" like this, if you could call it that. Or some people do genuinely believe they are both genders, or neither, or fluctuating between them. Who are you to tell them who/what they are? We have no right to make others feel like shit about their gender identity. Even if some of them do fake it, you get fakers in any section of the LGBT community.

But the reason it happens is because you throw a 1000 punches over the course of a weekend and it causes chafing (I hate taping my hands, so I rarely do). This is also a picture taken 3-4 days after the tourney, so the swelling is completely gone.   It is next to impossible to have this happen from one punch, unless you punch someone right on the mouth and cut yourself on their teeth. That's not recommended though :p"

If you land a punch with all four knuckles it means your hand is tilted to the left/right, depending on which hand it is. If you punch like that you strain the bones connecting your ring finger and pinky to the wrist and with enough force, snap them in two. It's known as ""Boxer's Fracture"" or ""Boxer's Break""."

Best thing if you're fighting bareknuckle is to just run away unless you're angry enough to risk damaging yourself. If you are then go bananas, but avoid the teeth."
thatHappened,3c77yk,PeacefulSequoia,2,Sun Jul 5 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"No. A boxer can generate a lot more force through proper technique than a layman and thus put a lot more stress on the bones with an unpadded strike. Especially against something very hard, like a skull.  You hit a guy in the skull, without gloves and with full force, you're very likely to break/chip some of the bones in your hand.   Edit: yeah and whilst not punching like a dipshit works 100% of the time when you're sober and ""fighting"" a heavy bag, most street fights have alcohol involved, chaos and people moving much differently than in a ring or sparring session.

But I cracked the back two so I had to finish it. Lots of blood. Ring and pinky essentially unscathed.   It really bothers me that so many people like to pretend to fight, or do shit like this. The injuries from a real fight go beyond some unrealistically scraped knuckles. Even just sparring second degrees when going for mine black and blues, and apparently broke my nose a few times after that. You don't fight in real life until you truly have no other option.

Many people with these attractions in fact seek help and even those who do not seek help should be given some kind of help because it is not neccesairly their fault. However calling it creepy is perfectly reasonable because it is creepy and bare in mind many people whith attraction to children or teenagers who are underage can help it although I don't disagree that there are a significant number of people who can't help their attraction.

Well, that shit catches up with you. I'm 48 and I now work at my local Cold Stone Creamery. I spent so much time bullying that I never had time to study and get a real education.  Anyway, that lil orphan fuckface came to my store and saw me right as I was getting done scrubbing the toilet.   He had a hot 11/10 wife, well dressed, clearly rich. He said to me ""tsmith944? How've you been?""  I was surprised he even acknowledged me, let alone seem kind. I felt this wave of emotion because I have driven everyone away with my bullying and shitty attitude, and fuckface here was treating like a normal person.  I said ""You remember me?""  He replies ""Yea, I don't hold a grudge""  So I ask him what I can get for him to which he replies ""Oh, here's a dollar tip, don't you have to sing for me?""  Without missing a beat I grabbed the ice cream scoop and whipped myself over the counter and started beating him senseless. Fucking nerd.  Anyway, if someone bullied you in school, there's a good chance you'll get your ass beat with an ice cream scoop if you try and throw it back in their face years later."
