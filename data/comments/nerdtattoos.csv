I thought maybe you meant they didn't like it because it wasn't accurate to the movie or something, but no, there's actually people there equating it with a swastika as a symbol of hate and genocide. It's really hard for me to fathom the skewed perspective on the world you'd have to have to make that kind of comparison in good faith."
nerdtattoos,38ivtx,jepyang,3,Thu Jun 4 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm with you there. My villain tattoos represent the variety of evil in various fictional worlds, as reminders to me to stick to my own ethical framework.

I only have room for one more big peice left on the inner bicep, and the majority of what you can see that is left is going to be filler, we just havn't got around to cranking out those bits yet!  Banjo kazooie gets a gooden jiggy and note piece Pokemon gets a few pokeballs and maybe an 8 bit ash The chocobo will probably get an 8 bit white mage and cactuar Bomberman will get a few of his iconic powerup icons Zelda still needs a triforce Yoshi will have a frog coin from super mario rpg near the bombette  I wanted to do lucca from chronotrigger as my last big one but the artist said that theninage of her was to detailed to fit into the space i have left, needed more space.  I may find a simpler image of her to use yet, and i could easily get filler for that, failing that i might need a non HD image  of samus to stick on there, but those are also harder to find.   Still a toss up on that last big one though..."

Either your original artist was complete rubbish, or your 2nd doesn't understand how to do touch ups and cover-ups very well...  So dark with bad lines and ink bleed outs.

nerdtattoos,34dgge,Literally_Badass,19,Thu Apr 30 06:55:15 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I have one tattoo. It's from a fringe, cult favourite movie that most people haven't seen. It's been recognised ( that I've had people tell me, anyway) about five times in six years or more.   The thing is; it really means something to me. I wanted the design for ages (it is simple as hell and a direct copy of the source). It's not highly visible. I got it at a time I was sure i was ready and knew where I wanted it and what it would mean to me forever. Whenever someone has commented on it, we've had long conversations about the source material. Even strangers on a train.   We have these conversations because we have something in common. Something I love enough to have tattooed on me: something they've seen enough times to recognise.   Not because some comment on reddit in response to a question I asked made me think I would get the biggest response, at this moment, and wear inside and on my skin for the rest of my life."
nerdtattoos,34dgge,Yourwtfismyftw,3,Thu Apr 30 13:33:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say a majority of my tattoos are nerdy. Depends on how you choose to define that word and your relationship toward the things you love.   I have Sandman's and Lady Death's sigils tattooed on my big toes.   I have an albatross tattoo, because I'm a sailor and like the mythology/meaning that comes from Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner.   I plan on getting a raven with a piece of parchment tied around its foot. (dark wings, dark words)....   I have line drawing constellations for Taurus, Aquarius, and Libra, which are the zodiac symbols of my immediate family, but also a nod to celestial navigation, which I have been teaching myself over the years."

I tried to post this to /r/tattoos a couple times and was immediately downvoted to nothing each time, and when I first posted it here, the first 10 or so votes kept it at a score of about 0 to 3. I started getting paranoid that it was actually just a bad tattoo and I just couldn't see it.   Fun fact, my username came from a comment of a passerby who saw me getting this tattoo done. It was just after getting touch ups on it, and the mushroom looked to be crying tears of blood (which I just thought was so funny), a guy who came in with his friend says, ""DAAAMN DUDE! I mean no disrespect with this, but you nerd so hard. That's intense.""   It was done by Chris Provenzo at Rock N Tattoo and Piercing in North Versailles, PA (though I don't believe he works there anymore). It was about 8 separate hour/hour and a half long sessions to finish it."

After all the work on the teeth, my skin wouldn't take uv.   The bite is actually my wife's teeth. We took her retainer and traced it,  and adjusted it as needed.  The molars we adjusted so that they didn't break the skin.  Edit 1. This was the first she had dealt with UV ink. If it fades, i have no problem with having it touched up.   I've read articles on retention of UV and there is no set rule it seems.  Edit 2.  I actually did quite alot of research on it.  I decided on the UV veins about 2 years ago.   At first I was hesitant for the same reasons, but other than the concerns out there 2 years ago,  I couldn't find any concrete ""this will rot your flesh and land you in r/nsfl"" science articles.  I did talk through a 3rd party (my mother) who works with a man that had his skeleton tattooed in UV, and that was years ago when he had it done.  He has not had any adverse reactions to it. That being said, I personally had a very slight reaction on the main veins, but even then it was slight swelling that we couldn't pin down to the ink or my sensitive skin."

On the outside, I included animals from water, land, and air (fish, stag, and bird) along with my two favorite native plants in my area (the salal and rhododendron). On top, I have our Mother Earth with the Moon and the Milky Way behind them. I also included the spiritual base of life: the tree of life. It melds with the atom to show that science and spirituality don't have to be separate. The tree, the animals, and the plants are all in Celtic design in tribute to my Celtic ancestors.
