At some point my mother and I were able to split from the group and walk around just the two of us.  We decided to check out the pachyderm house, and that's where we saw it.  The hippo, fresh up from it's nap, yawns and backs up to the tile wall in it's enclosure. Then proceeds to whip around it's tail while spraying shit like some sort of demonic garden sprinkler.   After all was said and done, the hippo proudly prances through the gate to it's outdoor enclosure for a swim with what I swear was a smile on it's hippo face.  All in all, a great bonding experience for mother and son."

This guy (or girlie??) here came up to me to play while I was drifting motionless on the surface. Obviously, we both enjoyed it!"""

They're very, very explicit and strict about floating on the surface and only watching the manatees.  Apparently its against the law (if I recall correctly) to even reach out with both hands to the manatees, as that can come under 'harassment'.  Absolutely wonderful animals though, getting to observe them in the wild is an incredible experience."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3dquzv,MyLemonWaterPotato,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:30 2015 UTC,"I just recently got a giant cat tree for my cat too (about 2 weeks ago), and she did the same thing at first. She's never had an appropriate verticle space, so she just didn't really recognize it as furniture specifically for her. I stuck a few pices of kibble here and there on the tree, and she had a pretty good time finding them all. Try doing that a few times, but make it really random though--put the goodies in different spots, at different points in the day, and change up the treats too. My cat had a lot of fun ""hunting"" for treats on her new tower, which got her to explore it, and become confident with the height (the highest platform is 6ft up!).   My cat (and other cats I've met too!) goes through these phases where she has one favorite spot that she defaults to, and she changes that spot about once a month or every other month. Like now, if I can't find her, she's usually lounging under the bed. Last month, she was really into my bf's computer chair. The month before, she'd hang out on the welcome mat in the foyer. If your cat goes through phases like mine does, then I'm sure that at one point, the tree will be thrown into the rotation. Mine is already spending more and more of her time on the highest perch, so I think that's gonna be the next new place to chillax. :D"

I realized one day that it looks like he is jerking it and looking back at you like you just caught him. But he keeps eye contact and keeps going. I can't stop laughing every time that commercial comes on TV now.

Later that summer she nearly killed the neighbors cat (their big neutered male thought he would get territorial with her when he escaped his house one day.  her back claws caught his belly and ripped it).  same neighbor lost half a Doxin ear to her (one of her ears only has a small knick, the other got a piece taken out of it by something.  we presume from fighting neighboring cats)"

Vets recommend it because SD is like a pharma company and pays vets and gives them samples to distribute it.  Many of the varieties are only for certain health conditions that should be discontinued after the animal is healthy.  Anyway that's my rant about SD.  Take my word for it, switch to a food with real meat (not chicken or by-products) as the first ingredient, and that has few ingredients."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3d7z5h,cloudmerchant,10,Tue Jul 14 14:43:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. It stands to reason at the very least that they would be smart enough to recognize that these are kids and therefore not threatening and more playful than adults.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d7z5h,dude_omg_wtf,10,Tue Jul 14 14:08:48 2015 UTC,I definitely think animals recognize our young more than we think they do.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d7z5h,cloudmerchant,14,Tue Jul 14 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'm a horse trainer and I'd trust the animals around children before I trust them around their adult owners. They can sense that the kids are non-threatening and 90% of the animals absolutely fawn over young kids. Adults are bigger and tend to be more aggressive in their actions in general, not on purpose, and don't have that same unhinged love for animals most of the time."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3d7z5h,esquilax,3,Tue Jul 14 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"Shit... thanks for sharing this info. In my previous reply, I started to write that children might also be their most annoying visitors but deleted for brevity.   From the link:   An employee told me in confidence that they keep it a secret that the whale reaction is aggressive, because it can be interpreted as playful by someone who doesn’t know.”   and another:   Dr. Lori Marino of the Kimmela Center reports that “I found that these organizations misrepresented information about the welfare and intelligence of marine mammals with boldly inaccurate assertions and biased half-truths.”   Personally speaking, as an animal lover I find it interesting and saddening that most attempts at engaging the public with wild animals are often viewed in hindsight as sorely misguided at best, and most often outright exploitative. For an organization such as an aquarium or zoo, the benefit might be increased patronage and therefore funding, which in turn can be used to benefit the animals abstractly through research or awareness. Yet the downside is that those who are passionate enough to work in this field are in some ways egregiously harming the individual animals by making them captive in stressful conditions. There is massive outrage over an oil spill, yet I wonder if the negative effect on the animals is different enough to illicit such vastly contrasting public opinions."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,FoodBeerBikesMusic,14,Mon Jul 13 17:59:27 2015 UTC,So the dog is actually getting aggressive with its owner for getting close to its food.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,Cranberry_Lips,2,Mon Jul 13 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some dogs are like that, I'm not sure if it's in their nature or just bad training. My parents have a dog around that size and if he has a bone or something he'll growl if you want to take it. When I was a kid he stole a rotisserie chicken and dragged it under this desk/his hiding spot.   We could hear him devouring it, and if someone got close to the desk, you would hear him growling."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,Drudeboy,8,Tue Jul 14 04:53:51 2015 UTC,It's poor training.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,Cranberry_Lips,6,Tue Jul 14 16:54:55 2015 UTC,Poor training. The dog doesn't recognize the owners as its superiors in the hierarchy so it's protecting its food.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,Accountthree,14,Thu Jul 16 23:37:00 2015 UTC,So the little son of a bitch just wants to kill something?
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,One_Wheel_Drive,7,Mon Jul 13 13:31:32 2015 UTC,Pretty much. I wonder if this is a small dog thing or an all dog thing.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,cdrchandler,33,Mon Jul 13 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"I've heard that small dogs are aggressive because they are less likely to have their behaviour corrected if they act up than a big dog.   In other words, if a Rottweiler starts barking aggressively or jumps on someone, it's more likely to be immediately punished because people can see how much damage it can do.   But if a chihuahua does it, people just say it's cute and don't bother to punish it. In the dog's mind of course, it doesn't know that so it is never taught that this behaviour is wrong."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,One_Wheel_Drive,7,Mon Jul 13 14:19:58 2015 UTC,"That definitely makes sense.  I'm wondering, though, if all dogs who are in attack mode, regardless of size, will attack whatever is closest to them if they can't get to their target, or if it's just certain sizes/breeds, or even if it's just my dog and the one in this gif."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,cdrchandler,10,Mon Jul 13 14:25:34 2015 UTC,I come from a family who owned many big dogs over the years.    Not once has one of the larger breeds attacked anything but the intended target. Smaller dogs don't really have a clear mind when they get amped up.     I don't rightly trust them.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,Skudworth,4,Mon Jul 13 15:29:16 2015 UTC,That's called small dog syndrome
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,sch1z0,2,Mon Jul 13 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"I dunno, my chihuahua used to bite/growl and we corrected the shit out of it. They may not be life-threatening, but their aggression isn't  cute. Crushed fingernails aren't cute."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,Accountthree,2,Thu Jul 16 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"It's true that they're less likely to be trained and that's often the source of poor behaviors.  That being said, punishing a rottweiler (or any dog) for being aggressive is likely to just make them more aggressive."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,puterTDI,2,Mon Jul 13 16:03:34 2015 UTC,Poor choice of words on my part. I meant trained. I've never owned a dog so I wouldn't really know how to properly train one.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,One_Wheel_Drive,2,Mon Jul 13 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"fair enough.  Unfortunately, a lot of people think punishing a dog is how you train a dog.  What ends up happening is the dog does something bad, person punishes/hits them, dog has no idea what it did wrong just that it got hit.  Rinse and repeat over and over again until all the dog knows is that it's getting hit for no reason and starts to lash out to protect itself.  Too many people think that dogs understand them when they talk to them and then punish them for not understanding english."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,puterTDI,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:14:24 2015 UTC,Also think you didnt analyze his behavior correctly. His eyes do point towards the cabbage.  Dogs will often tilt their head away from what they are growling at when at close range.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d3gxl,znk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely possible. When the dog attacks, he's certainly looking at the cabbage, but it appears that when he's barking, he's looking straight ahead between the cabbage and the camera. My own dog has been on my lap barking at someone and turned completely around to bite me, so she couldn't have been looking at the target of her rage during the attack.  To me it seemed like he was trying to get at someone across the table, but since the woman was holding him back, he had to unleash his fury on something, and the cabbage was the closest target. However, upon viewing the full video, he was just mad someone was trying to steal his stolen noms."

Now say it with me,   This is my camera. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My camera is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My camera, without me, is useless. Without my camera, I am useless. I must film with my camera true. I must shoot more stable than my other networks who are trying to outshine me. I must film the shot before the subject shoots me. I will... My camera and I know that what counts in film is not the images we capture, the noise of our burst, nor the framing we make. We know that it is the subject captured that count. We will capture... My camera is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its lense. I will keep my camera clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will... Before God, I swear this creed. My camera and I are the defenders of my livelihood. We are the masters of our trade. We are the saviors of my life.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3d0gs1,Krizzle8,28,Mon Jul 13 09:31:37 2015 UTC,Sumo generally works better for people with shorter legs and a longer torso. Conventional for the opposite. Sumo also favors shorter arms.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3d0gs1,cryolithic,3,Mon Jul 13 00:15:19 2015 UTC,It's more about limb lengths and their proportions than it is about overall height. You're probably more set up for conventional deadlifts than sumo.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d0gs1,1__________,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:51:01 2015 UTC,Yep! Though I'm shorter leg than most people my height.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d0gs1,cryolithic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"You have long arms? You might be suited to a hybrid stance like Ed Coan, he always said he had short legs, long torso, and long arms. The benefit of sumo is by widening your stance you shorten the distance that the bar has to travel and with short legs it's just that much shorter, even if you don't go as wide as some people. That being said it really comes down to mobility and if you can get your hips opened comfortably. Even with optimal limb lengths mobility will decide the most comfortable way to deadlift for you."

Slowly getting back into it and my sumos going back up and hopefully I'll have 500 relatively soon, aiming for beginning of October hopefully sooner. My conventional is right around 395 and I don't like doing it 'cause I suck at it haha. Congrats on the new baby and keep pushing."

If I try to squat with my feet shoulder width, my form is horrendous. There's just not enough space to let my legs do what they need to do. Wide stance gives me the space I need to work."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3d0gs1,gaarasgourd,-62,Sun Jul 12 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"It never fails she is obviously doing weights she can maintain if she doing multiple reps.   Do you even lift? We only see her do 3 reps for sure. When I deadlift sets of 5 (which I'm guessing is what she's doing,) I only have enough control over the weight to pick it up and put it down back where it was in a controlled manner. You can't walk around while holding that much weight. You can't just toss it aside. You can't hold it for more than maybe 10 seconds before it starts rolling out of your hands, even if you're using alternating grip. Even if you could move it around to avoid killing your dog, you'd probably hurt yourself in the process.  If she was repping out 10+ reps, then I'd agree that it's not that dangerous, because you would have more control over it."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3d0gs1,mattsprofile,27,Sun Jul 12 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"No need to ""toss it aside"" to simply not crush your dog, just needs to be able to lower it slowly.

When I am going to pull I tell him to lay down in a certain spot. He never wanders and waits for me to release him. Very little risk and we enjoy the mutual play time.

I would never do deadlifts in particular around any animals or children that might wander into a dangerous area.  If you're deadlifting heavy, you don't have that much control on where the weight goes besides up and down. And once it is up you can't hold it up for very long just waiting for the dog to get out of the way so you don't smash it.  And even with other exercises where you have more control and are less likely to squish someone or something, you still can't be too sure that your dog isn't going to jump on you when it sees that you're struggling."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3cxmz8,Kiwilolo,46,Sat Jul 11 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, when an animal pulls on your clothes, they are trying to murder you, definitely. Just look at this wild beast on the hunt.  Foxes aren't pack hunters, you know, and afaik don't hunt prey that is even their size, let alone larger. Foxes are more famous for this rather charming hunting style.  Edit: However I should say that doesn't mean the fox isn't being aggressive; and at the least no one wants their clothes ripped. It's just probably not planning on killing you.  Also I just watched a youtube video of a hyena single-handedly pulling down a fairly large antelope just by holding onto it. Hyenas are boss as hell and I would not attempt to feed them like this, as much as I love them."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3cxmz8,goedegeit,73,Sun Jul 12 05:57:58 2015 UTC,Hyenas and foxes are very different. I don't really trust your teenage summer job as any sort of qualification resembling animal psychology.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3cxmz8,shizzelez,48,Sun Jul 12 01:59:59 2015 UTC,Hyena and Fox are pretty much same tbh.  Lets see:  Both have 4 legs.  2 eyes.  Mouth with teeth.  Fur.  Ears.  Tail.  So yeah basically same thing.

I live in the UK, and I know it will always get down-votes from people across the pond who put them on the same pedestal as domesticated dogs, but foxes are essentially vermin and very opportunistic with young children/babies."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3cxmz8,thesonofdarwin,2,Sun Jul 12 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"You offered a definitive explanation for the behavior without a credible source. You made the statement worse by applying behavior or hunting techniques from one species to another.   Don't believe all of your down votes came because people disagree with you about these animals not being domesticated, because it's obvious in the real sense of domestication they are not. Mine came because you made a claim without backing it, and in researching it myself could not find any credibility in your statements."

Here's my shorter reply: They have fun in the moment and regret it later, exactly like we do sometimes.  Using my dogs as examples:  One just loves ripping up tissues. Loves it! She knows it's bad but sometimes, she can't help herself. We get home and she's immediately creeping before we even see the tissue, because she knows she's in trouble because the bed is now covered in little bits of tissue. She never gets big trouble but still...  The other loves barking, it's like his favourite thing in the world, but he knows it's bad. I don't mind him barking a bit if there's a cat in the garden or something, but he just. won't. stop. when you shout him. Eventually, you have to go in the garden to get him and he creeps and as soon as you get near him, bolts past you into the house. He jumps up on the nearest person and acts like they'll protect him from a telling off (they won't)."

So they're happily tearing your wallet to shreds then later look at it and think ""Oh shit look at that, it's in pieces. Owner yells at me when stuff is in pieces.""   If you want to teach them not to do something you have to actually catch them in the act and stop them. Same thing goes with potty training. If you don't actually interrupt them when they start to go in the house and take them outside it's much harder for them to learn. The whole rubbing their nose in it thing doesn't actually do much."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3crump,TrubbleWithTribbles,3,Fri Jul 10 17:13:44 2015 UTC,"This was so true with my dog. She kept going down to the basement and pottying on the carpet. She had no idea what the problem was until I finally caught her squatting and scolded her and dragged her outside. After a few minutes she squatted outside and looked at me like ""are you gonna yell at me again?"" So I praised her and gave her some treats and that was the end of that. One time catching her in the act and she immediately understood. She is pretty smart but some things just don't click the same way with dogs."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3crump,katielady125,52,Sat Jul 11 01:16:29 2015 UTC,"Courtesy of /u/TrubbleWithTribbles I work in animal behavior. First, I'm not going to read down, because anyone flaming you about this situation will only upset me. So, just know, it was a mistake, and you're not only learning from it yourself, you're trying to help people understand the risk and teach others. It's all you can do today.  Dogs who are trained not to get into specific area, are often only trained to want to avoid them, especially when people are around. However, they are opportunistic - if certain factors come into play - a highly tempting chance and no one to deter it immediately, they will falter on that avoidance and go for it. At any time a temptation can override their having learned to want to avoid them, they haven't learned to not want to get into the garbage, they've only learned to avoid consequences of being caught having gone through it. If they've had a good time in there before, they'll be sure to at least want to try again, feeling conflicted.. wanting to, but not wanting to be scolded.  There is a machine, that is used to teach new to the home pets (who haven't learn scavenging patterns in a home yet) to not get into specific things or places - even when no one is around - which is a key lesson. When I taught puppy classes, we'd evaluate each dog for that machine was a good teacher for it. Some dogs are very sensitive, and that machine would cause it to be scared out of it's mind (it's never a good idea to try and trigger fear, or let fear linger, especially in the impressionable young!!) so they were advised absolutely don't use this machine, it will actually only cause problems for the pets and there's really better ways for that type to be taught. And the other extreme is, some dogs would be oblivious to the machine, they are the teflon brain types, very hard to be bothered by anything, some even tried to play with the machine. Most dogs however fell into the middle, where they'd be annoyed by the machine, and want to avoid it and the specific area it was in (like a garbage can, or a closet, a kitty litter box - when the cat was isolated somewhere else so it wouldn't be trained by the machine to avoid it's own box!). For those dogs, it was useful, but wouldn't traumatize them causing them to fear the whole room or house, and would be effective enough in deterring a behavior from being learned by the pet as rewarding. When taught preventatively:  ~ they never learn to think of counters, garbage cans etc as good things to sneak into in the first place, so your dog isn't fighting conflicted feelings of 'that one time it sure paid off', but...  ~they learn that even being curious around very specific areas in specific ways (head must enter waste basket for example) even with an array of temptations are involved (lots of different temptations are tested and proofed for), is no fun and no value to try or keep trying  ~ they learn this whether or not someone is around, through many carefully orchestrated exposures, it's like intentionally leaving an 'oops' kind of scenario, letting the machine teach it' not worth it'.  ~lives are saved this way.   When it comes down to brass tacks, young pets discover the world through scent and sight. They are learning about the world through cause and effect. They are curious. They stick their head into the bathroom trash and find used women's products, that behavior was rewarded by something they liked and found interesting - cause and effect means they'll try it again. Same for chewing on shoes in the closet, or eating Kitty Roca from the litter box, or food wrappers in waste baskets or on counters. They were rewarded, inadvertently, by the experience of it all, and therefor would gladly try to do it again - and some learn to be selective - don't get caught becomes their focus, not avoidance overall (they don't think of long term like evidence later, only in the moment)  Owners then try and deter that behavior from happening again, and it can be effective so long as owners are present. But as much as a 1.5 yr old human lacks some impulse control and long term outcome thinking, so do dogs. The opportunity arises, and they act on it when the chances of consequence aren't among the situation at the time.  It's a mistake nearly every single pet owner has made, every pet has made. The thing is, most dogs come out unscathed, many might have problems (food allergy, vomiting, diarrhea, needing something to be surgically removed even), and some die (eating lethal xylitol, chocolate, raisins or grapes, medicines, antifreeze, or asphyxiation, just a few examples). So every pet has gotten into something, most though survive their mistakes. They're dogs, designed by nature to hunt stuff down, scavenge, and be opportunistic (a bunny jumps from a bush, they don't ponder 'gee Frank, do you feel like chasing bunny today?' - they either flee or chase, adrenaline is proffered instantly). We are only human, fallible and we make mistakes. Combined, sad things happen, but majority wise, we all fumble through life together and have a lot of great times that way.  There is no perfect answer, or singular preventative measure with a lifetime guarantee. Training goes a long way, luck has something to do with it, and life is dynamic and risk can never be eliminated completely yet still have much of a quality of life. Thanks for speaking out and trying to teach yet another facet of risk, and options to deter. Lidded/sealing cans can help, baby gates or crates can help (when implemented properly). Having other desirable things to seek out and chew you approve of and provide is a definite help (keeping them busy - give them a hobby that they love and would prefer anyways to pass the time - a bored dog is a recipe for mischief - a tired and focused on provided toys and chews dog is a great dog.  Feel the hug, what you're experiencing is tough. There may be a grieving for pet support group in your area, check with an animal hospital in your area, they often run those, or some big counseling groups offer those specialized focus groups too. Forgive yourself your humanity, and forgive your dog it's impulse. I'm so sorry what happened, but it does happen and to live we all run a risk of danger, and there is no perfect, nothing even close and still have a full life. Top notch trainers and behaviorists can usually nurture skills sets that are comprehensive, help evaluate houseplant/yard/in home danger zones and implement training that prevents dogs learning ""this=good"" for unwanted behaviors before bad habits get started - using mostly games and toys and treats and very little, very minimal deterrents - when it's done right if deterrents are done at all, it would only need a few repetitions of something as mentally unpleasant as hearing fingernails go down a chalkboard and no physical harm - at all, no shocks or buzzes or anything.   Thanks for trying to help others avoid this, just know we're human and we leave things out and get distracted, and cutting bags only prevents a window of opportunistic and dangerous behaviors.   The best approach is to prevent dogs from learning getting into tabletops, counters, waste baskets, litter boxes, garage shelves with antifreeze bottles...... etc etc etc even when no one is around and regardless of the temptation type = NOT FUN might be a better, more encompassing lesson that treats a broader array of what if's. When you treat root issues that comprehensively, a lot more can be done with a lot more chances at variability, mistakes and such factoring in and still holding ground in treatment.  Tl;Dr: There's other, broader treatment ways to teach pets to avoid hazard areas. You trying to help people realize the risk is kind, and what happened was a honest mistake I hope you forgive yourself for soon.  Edit: forgot tldr, then corrected some vowel movements. I have a puppy, he's distracting, probably more errors but oh well."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3crump,under_psychoanalyzer,4,Fri Jul 10 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"I think associating a certain act with anything unpleasant is the basis for dog training (training collars, or pronged/choke collars as people call them is fundamentally this idea).

AnimalsBeingJerks,3crump,witeowl,3,Sat Jul 11 03:46:02 2015 UTC,"No, they know it. Growing up, we had outdoor cats and a dog. Our dog looooved the cat's food, and craved it something fierce. If we weren't paying attention and let him out before the cats had finished their food, he would inhale it.   But if we're not paying attention, you might ask, how do we know it was it was him eating the food and not the cats?  We knew because he would slink in, head and tail tucked in as far as possible, and immediately walk into his crate (where we punished him). 99% of the time when this would happen, we would have had no idea if he hadn't 'fessed up and punished himself.

If you walk outside, see something ripped up, get upset, the dog will be upset also.  A lot of this crap people say how their dog KNEW it was bad is nonsense.  It saw and felt your reaction.  Now the other posters talking about previous behavior etc may have some truth there but in most cases the dog is responding to it's owners reaction."

Wherever it is, it's far outside of this neighborhood so I guess he's never getting there.  He always heads in the same direction though, at full clip.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3clfeh,spasticjedi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"Cute post.  Most cats actually need to be harness trained before they can be leash trained.  A lot of people think they can throw a harness and leash on and just take their cat outside.  But you have to spend weeks putting that harness on for 10 minutes at a time and coaxing them with treats before they'll be willing to walk with it on.  Then you hope they don't get scared by the leash.  Then you hope they're not too scared to walk away from your door...  I'm a couple of months in, and I'm proud to report that I can get my cat about 10 yards away from my front door before something scares her and she sprints back.  :\"

Maybe I don't understand the whole karma thing, (i mean i have a basic enough understanding of real world karma) does karma mean he is liked? or the people who posted his content are liked? what even drives someone to filter through the internet and edit then repost something, does he think he is famous for doing this? does he just want attention? I clicked here because it was the third gallowbot thread i passed by and i accidently upvoted one of them, had to retract my vote and spread awareness!"

This happens in most of Gallowboob's posts, some dude posts about how he posts too much, and how he reposts (which he mostly doesn't).   The video of this did in fact hit front page, even though you said    It's actually still kicking around /r/videos , sad to see the author is not still on the front page   But people just plain like GIFs better. This post has more points than any on the front page of /r/videos, even though this sub has 3% of the subscribers of /r/videos. It belongs in this sub just like /r/videos, so why is it so bad to post here?  Also.... Why PM me? Other discussions are not filled by the poster, that gets filled when you use the same exact link someone else used.

It's amazing the things we do off handedly to our dogs and will get the response we don't expect..  My dog Sebastian got out one day, I found a hole in the fence and called him over to me. He already knew he was in trouble for digging, all I had done was stood where the hole was and called him as I would normally, he tip toed over, ears down, tail tucked, body low and sat. I asked him if this is what he had done, then asked him to show me how he got out.. and he did and then froze there long enough for me to get the photo. I called him back before he decided to crawl all the way under then he sat there on his tail all sad like. Dogs are just ridiculous some times"
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bxgb4,a_slinky,3,Fri Jul 3 10:38:05 2015 UTC,"Dogs are amazing. It wasn't pointing but I had a couple huskies I skijored (dogs in harness pulling a XC skier) with. I managed to teach them their left from their right. Come spring when the snow froze to a crust thick enough to support me we could wind our way through the woods off trail where ever I wanted.    It still trips me out that a dog can understand a word ""gee"" or ""haw"" means ""right"" or ""left""."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bxgb4,somajones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:22:37 2015 UTC,Dogs that are trained will respond to hand signals better than dogs that aren't. My dog is trained to point using her nose and to follow my fingers and the direction I look. Dogs are incredibly smart creatures once they've bonded with a person and that person has taught them.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3bxgb4,serpentjaguar,19,Fri Jul 3 05:42:23 2015 UTC,You're probably right but we need to cut the big guy a deal. The little one is the mastermind and the big one's just the lackey so we have bigger fish to try.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3buru5,adesimo1,3,Fri Jul 3 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"On the slim chance that this is actually real, the cat probably didn't last long. I'm pretty sure that a regular diet of the cat-equivalent of 750g of protein a day would cause protein toxicity and renal failure.  And that's before he added in all the other supplements. And it doesn't help that domestic cats are generally susceptible to renal problems under normal circumstances.  Unless this guy is a vet or regularly consulting with a vet  (which seems unlikely, because I can't imagine any ethical vet willingly doing something like this) that cat probably didn't have the longest or healthiest life.

I was suggesting that your own personal sense of morality should perhaps be at a higher standard than that of a fucking bird.   Edit: a wild bird, at that. Even trained birds know better than to retributively attack people."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3br1im,TeddyBearSuicide,4,Thu Jul 2 13:38:48 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree with it not being morally corrupt. I understand that every animal, including humans, have an innate instinct to protect their children. However, human beings have far superior intellect to pelicans and should reason that their child is not in real danger. There is a way to solve this problem without punting a pelican."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3br1im,AestheticDeficiency,0,Thu Jul 2 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"I doubt that we'll come to an agreement on this as I would bet the underlying worldviews we hold are much too different. However, I disagree that the child is not in danger in this situation. A bird that is willing to take something from your hand is not above a peck to the eye or wing to the face if the child responds by trying to take it back or any number of other reactions. My opinion is that a bird that is fearless enough to mess with one kid will do it to the next as well, and will get bolder over time which may result in tragedy if a parent isn't in reach. It needs to be put in it's place. I would have no remorse in doing so."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3br1im,nvaus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:16:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're correct that neither of us will change our opinion. However, I can understand why you believe that, and your instinct to protect children is admirable. Also, I wanted to say that I appreciate the civil disagreement. Too often I feel like reddit disagreements subvert to name calling or just downvoting people to oblivion. That said, I have you tagged as Pelican Puncher. :-)"

AnimalsBeingJerks,3blhev,SuperSwish,27,Tue Jun 30 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"I got a kitten once when I was a child, and loved the shit out of it. She would always climb up me to my head/shoulders and just chill with me. We became pretty close as we grew up.   By the time she was an adult cat, we were like best friends. She'd always greet my with her tail raised when I got off the bus, go with me on walks, etc. Sometimes I'd even go outside when I was upset, and she'd just like, lick my face.   Unfortunately, she also became pretty protective of me. No matter how much I tried to calm her down, she'd always hiss at people when they got near me.   Eventually, my parents decided this wasn't a good thing, and took her to the local fair grounds to hunt mice in the horse barns. It sucked :(  We had a few cats after that, but they weren't the same.   Tl;Dr: Cat's are total bros"

AnimalsBeingJerks,3blhev,megthegreatone,23,Tue Jun 30 13:56:18 2015 UTC,Why?  I've had lots of cats and have trained them all to stay off the kitchen counters and kitchen table.     It's not hard.  It takes like 3-7 days of conditioning and then it's fine.     The trick is to make sure they have a high place they are allowed to jump on that belongs to them.  That makes the other training go a lot smoother.     I don't even feed the cat in the kitchen or open it's food there.   They have their own spot and I keep their food stored near by.   Another mistake people make is storing the litter box in the laundry room or pantry in their kitchen.   BIG NO NO.   Then they wonder why their cat pisses on clean laundry.   BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE THE PLACE THEY ASSOCIATE WITH PISSING!  Derps.    My cats never have a reason to go in the kitchen.  They regard it as the place I force them to get wet when I bath them and thats it.   So they stay away.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3bb0hr,LifeWulf,74,Sat Jun 27 14:27:29 2015 UTC,The cat doing the chasing. He (and the other kitty) belong to a Japanese woman who made a blog/youtube channel/published books about him. This is probably his most famous video.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bb0hr,lovetoujours,25,Sat Jun 27 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"What a coincidence, Maru and I have the same technique for getting into boxes."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bb0hr,RedxEyez,11,Sat Jun 27 16:00:15 2015 UTC,It's surprisingly effective (affective? I always confuse those) isn't it?
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bb0hr,lovetoujours,11,Sat Jun 27 17:58:16 2015 UTC,Effective. Affective is affecting something. Maybe. I know it's effective tho
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bb0hr,SpandexTerry,3,Sat Jun 27 18:31:08 2015 UTC,Yes. Affective is the verb.  I know this rule and I still mess then up 95% of the time.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bb0hr,lovetoujours,2,Sat Jun 27 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"Effect usually refers to the consequence/result of something (""Traditional discipline has no effect on pet sugar gliders"" / ""The medication caused the undesired effect of weight gain""), but it is sometimes used as a verb meaning to cause something to come into being (""The fallout of the protest effected new legislation""). Affect is typically used as a verb meaning to cause a change in something (""The cheaper materials negatively affected the quality of the product"" / ""The noisy crowd affected the golfer's performance"" ), but it's occasionally used as an old poetic way of referring to feelings (""He is prone to the whims of the affects""). Effective is correct here because the intention is to emphasize the notable effect it has (""Charmander used Ember, it's super effective!""). Affective would be a used to emphasize how something influences feelings/emotions (""The dark winters of northern latitudes are dangerously affective"")."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3bb0hr,bge,10,Sat Jun 27 18:45:37 2015 UTC,The other kitty is named Hana.

If you're looking at it as if it were two people boxing: sure, the eagle got more licks in. But the stakes were much higher than that for the eagle and the cat; both of them were fighting for survival. Most likely the cat's face healed eventually and he lived, now wiser.   We don't know what eventually came of the eagle, but it's possible that meals in the wild were getting scarce enough for him that he resorted to hunting domesticated animals in residential areas. Regardless of whether this assumption is correct, where his next meal is coming from was very much in question following his battle with the cat.   Based on what we know from the story, I score it Cat-1, Eagle 0."

As such, especially with the 3rd dimensional escape vector of flight, if upon interaction, the owl reassessed the threat, it would try to fly the fuck away. The thread doesn't need to be something that can kill the owl, but just merely harm it enough, or portray the ability and threat to do so, to prevent it from hunting properly. A lot of apex hunters are very very specialised machines, like formula 1 cars, they are designed to do one thing, very well, but can also be very delicate."

Even a ten pound cat, which is on the small side, would outweigh all but your really big birds of prey, of which the great horned owl is not one. A really large house cat, say a Maine Coon tom, can easily top 20 lbs and would easily dismay all but the most determined owl. I don't say that a cat would win, just that your weight is way off and it's by no means a sure thing. If the Internet has taught us anything, it's that cats are capable of amazing feats.  Of course, the real point here is that they would never really fight at all, both of them being solitary hunters and accordingly very wary of unecessary combat by nature; an injury being potentially fatal and all."

The cat would only stand a chance if it got a good pounce off and didn't let go, which is unlikely. The most likely things to happen would be the owl scaring the cat away, wounding it severely and giving up, or killing it while sustaining minor injuries. Cats teeth and claws are tiny compared to the talons and beak of an owl like a great horned.  I've handled feral cats and great horned owls and the owls are scary, the cat's are more just annoying."

It can scratch it and it can bite it, but that owl's talons will cut through the cats flesh muscle and down to the bone with extreme ease, and it's beak is going to bite completely through bones like they aren't there.   The cat will have a much, much harder time putting the owl down. The owl only needs to land one good bite or one good rake of it's talons along the cats belly as it's jumping at it and the cat is done.   The cat will have to somehow get to the owls throat without getting bit by the beak that's going to be half an inch from the cats face.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,Ghost_Animator,558,Wed Jun 24 13:54:43 2015 UTC,"Unless it's a momma bear with cubs around, a black bear will back down from pretty much any sort of confrontation. That's why if you encounter one you're supposed to act big and yell at it until it goes away, as opposed to a grizzly where you're best bet is to back away slowly if you can or play dead and hope for the best if you can't. I'm on mobile and can't find it now, but I remember seeing a video of a house cat chasing a black bear up a tree. Edit: Apparently black bears fresh out of hibernation will occasionally wreck your shit then eat you."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,racast5,73,Wed Jun 24 15:30:34 2015 UTC,Bear spray works. Sometimes. More than a small caliber handgun at least when it comes to grizzlies. A grizzly with a bullet wound is angry. A grizzly with pepper spray in the face is confused and irritated and wants to get out of the damn burning.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,tughdffvdlfhegl,22,Wed Jun 24 17:43:30 2015 UTC,Yeah but they don't tell you that Bear Spray attracts bears after its used. So if your stuck in the middle of nowhere you just rang a dinner bell for more grizzlies.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,redditstealsfrom9gag,5,Wed Jun 24 20:00:41 2015 UTC,I wonder what ever happened to black bears and why they are so easily frightened. They shouldn't be.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,MKG32,8,Thu Jun 25 00:53:44 2015 UTC,They typically don't eat meat so they're much more docile. Unless you get between a mother and cub or its starving your usually pretty good because it's got berries to eat that won't fight back.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,bat_son,36,Wed Jun 24 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"I believe the rules for dealing with bears aren't really different.  If anything a Grizzly has a higher risk of predatory attack where you need to aggressively fight for your life, versus a defensive attack where you should play dead.  Nonetheless most attacks by any bear type are typically defensive attacks by the bear, where one should play dead if it escalates to actual contact.  But the rules depend on attack type, not bear type.  edit: gramma  edit2: Since downvoted, sources to look at below.    Parks Canada here US National Park Service here"
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,ChornWork2,35,Wed Jun 24 21:51:49 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it is almost impossible to fight or out run a grizzly bear. Knife, spears, rock, bats or other weapons of that type are essentially useless. You may be able to injure it but it won't stop it from killing you. Even small arms won't be much help unless you are at a distance.   For a good refrence of what fighting a grizzly bear would be like: Imagine getting in a fist fight with this guy, except he is nearly twice the size, has wolverine style claws, and can bite half your chest of with out any strain.  The purpose behind playing dead is that grizzly bears will not eat you unless they are starving, they don't typically prey on humans. Once the bear thinks you are dead it will no longer view you as a threat and may leave you alone. This still however only gives you a chance at surviving. The only way to guarantee it won't kill you is to not run into it in the first place."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,l-0_o-l,23,Wed Jun 24 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the guy's advice that I responded to was just flat out wrong.  I'm guessing you didn't go to the links.  Playing dead is the wrong course of action if its a predatory attack, with any bear.  Most attacks are defensive though, where playing dead is the recommended course of action.  But the tactics depend on the type of attack, not the type of bear.  EDIT: It's a fair comment to say that if a predatory Grizzly bear attacks you are almost certainly dead if you are not in at least a lightly armored vehicle, but playing dead is not going to help your cause so the advice might as well be to sing lullabies.  however on the off chance you're with your wife and kids, maybe you can save them.  Having you all play dead is having them all become dead in that situation."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,writers_block,18,Thu Jun 25 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"Who said I think there's anything but a remote chance?  If a bear is acting in a predatory manner and attacks you when you are without appropriate protections, you're fucked.  Your only chance is that it's a younger bear that you can dissuade by fighting or causing injury.  Playing dead is not going to stop the attack.  Don't believe me:   Parks Canada here US National Park Service here"
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,ChornWork2,17,Wed Jun 24 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"Prey drive is funny. If you don't act enough like prey, it pretty much just ebbs. You're advised to stand and ""fight"" the bear because the attempt will keep you alive and not looking so delicious, not because you would actually win the fight.  You're advised to play dead for fear aggression (""defensive"") because you are totally right: You have almost no chance if the bear fights back."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,SchwanzKafka,7,Wed Jun 24 15:57:04 2015 UTC,Still seems like your real best bet would be to pick up the biggest branch you can find and try to look like you suddenly just turned huge while shouting at the top of your lungs.  At the very least you go out like a Spartan.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,writers_block,10,Wed Jun 24 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"it's laughable that you think a person can aggressively fight off a grizzly with anything less than an elephant gun   The thing about predators is that, unless they are starving, they might not really have much invested in the fight. There is no pride at stake for the bear - you might only need to make it decide that there is probably a lower-effort meal elsewhere."

But it was time to go in and he never finished his hunt.  As we walked in I shut the door and he turned back and snarled at me and trotted off. When he got to the end of the hallway in front of the bedroom door he turned around and hissed at me.  So I did what any reasonable person would do and gave him the middle finger.    He took that as a challenge and ran after me, latched onto my ankle and kicked like a mule for a good 5 seconds.  I was only wearing shorts and sandals, so his sharp claws dug in and tore my shit up.   Some were just heavy scratches but a few were fairly deep.  I washed it off and poured peroxide on it and went to the ER to get a tetanus shot just to make sure I didn't get an infection.    He hid from me for a few days after that and we became cool again.  But I never fully trusted him since."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,KStreetFighter2,100,Wed Jun 24 15:07:56 2015 UTC,"You may be wondering how this happens - How does such a small animal scare such a bigger one - How do cats scare away alligators, bears, and all kinds of disproportionately-sized animals?  The short answer is, the larger animal isn't hungry, territorial or angry, merely curious (i.e. in a fight, the cat would be a light snack).  Why?   When animals are curious or not defensive, they don't tend to approach the situation in fight or flight. What they encounter is an animal more aggressive than they are, and so even symbolic resistance on the cat's part tends to change their thought process: ""Whoa, what's this? It looks angry! I'm not going to waste a lot of energy on a fight that isn't on my turf or necessary for survival.""   If the bear was hungry, protecting its young or feeling threatened, there's nothing the cat would be able to do.   It's a lot like those massive open-world role-playing games. You explore places and beat whatever's on or below your level, but as soon as you encounter something that looks way stronger than you, even if it's not in a fight mode, you immediately run the hell away as fast as you can, because you know you'll get hurt in a conflict.  tl;dr I need to play less Witcher 3."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,Draki1903,21,Wed Jun 24 14:59:14 2015 UTC,"I never thought of it like that, ""I don't wanna eat you because i'm not hungry enough. I'm just gonna run my ass away from you instead.""  Its both empowering and pathetic."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,ZEB1138,10,Wed Jun 24 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"There is also another factor - even if an animal is hungry/curious, it can get wounded in a fight. A solid scratch to the nose could render the bear unable to smell and unable to find food. Sometimes the pyrrhic victory is just not worth it."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,Jucoy,20,Wed Jun 24 16:53:21 2015 UTC,"Most people probably don't realize that aggressive animals generally don't fight each other in the wild, even when competing for food.  More often than not, one intimidates the other to give up rather than risk injury.  Knowing when to back down is vital for surviving in the wild.    That bear had nothing on the line so it had no reason not to retreat."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3aya7c,StopClockerman,9,Wed Jun 24 17:00:30 2015 UTC,The cat however is on its home turf and does feel threatened.

Anyway, we found a baby owl sitting on the ground in the grape vineyards. For some reason we decided it must be returned to the bird house my friend had that they said the owls liked. Somehow I got the duty of bringing the owl home, and climbed atop a 6-7 ft ladder to dump this baby owl through the hole. Now this bird house had a good 1 ft or more drop from the hole to the house floor, and baby dropped. But not much more than a few seconds later I, still standing on that damn ladder, was faced with a full grown owl who just had a baby fall on her from the heavens while asleep came fucking ""nope!"" out of there as I sprung backwards off the ladder trying to escape raptor talons. Surprisingly, I didn't suffer any injuries, though I should have."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,grimeMuted,91,Fri Jun 19 19:14:45 2015 UTC,Cats were never truly domesticated; they just want us to think they are.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,Urrrhn,61,Fri Jun 19 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"The actual truth of the matter is they haven't been domesticated for very long.  The process began (likely) in Egypt some 5000 years ago when the Egyptians noticed these animals hanging around their granaries and doing a superb job of keeping vermin out of the grain.   You can figure out the domestication vector from that little tidbit of information.  Canids have been domestic far longer. Possibly 13,000 and more years ago.  Another issue is temperament. Animals which live in hierarchical packs are far easier to domesticate as they see humans as the Alpha pack leader.  Cats are solitary. They will tolerate each other if you force them to, but forming a pack isn't in their nature."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,Choreboy,26,Sat Jun 20 02:28:30 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you about the last part.  Domestic cats, likely due to the domestication process, have become social animals even if they turn or are born feral.  Feral domestic cats behavior most closely resembles lion prides.   Like lions, they will frequently live in groups and the females are the more aggressive and successful hunters."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,mirtleturtle,2,Sat Jun 20 07:10:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree too. I have multiple cats as per finding a cat with kittens on the property, catching the cat and kittens, and liking the kittens too much to get rid of them. Our cats have a definite hierarchy, and the alpha male even has his own sub group of cats he hangs out with. It actually is fairly interesting to watch them and how they interact with each other."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,frostwolfeh,9,Sat Jun 20 04:02:57 2015 UTC,cats do form packs in nature. They are solitary in the sense that they'll hunt for themselves and they do no rely on the pack but they do form colonies.   Also cats haven't changed much since domestication because they already did the job we needed them to do. They hunted vermin for us and in return we didn't kill them and even started housing them.   Dogs have various breeds due to selective breeding because of niche jobs that we needed them to do.  There's a great documentary by David attenborough called Pussies in Rome about the feral cat colonies in the coliseum.   It is also believed that cats were actually domesticated in west Asia before they where Egypt.

The exact reason for it all is incase they acidentally pick up people's pets and spay/neuter them without permission.   cats are incredibly interesting because they're the only species I can think of that can blur the lines between domesticated and feral.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,roonie317,34,Fri Jun 19 21:16:04 2015 UTC,What's really mean is that the dog is chained. Chaining dogs for long periods of time is outlawed in some states.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,Littlemissfunshines,11,Fri Jun 19 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"Changing is illegal when you just have the chain around their neck, he has a soft collar on."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,XenoGalaxias,19,Fri Jun 19 19:21:20 2015 UTC,"Chaining dogs is illegal, where it's illegal, because living a life at the end of a chain makes dogs depressed and more likely to be vicious. It has nothing to do with the comfort of the chain around the neck."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3afb9j,Littlemissfunshines,10,Sat Jun 20 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"but is chaining your dog really that bad if you're also outside? Chaining your dog up so you can be doing yard work in the front yard with an eye on your dog, not having to worry about him running away, or going into the street? the dog also gets to see you, and be outside. Is that bad? I'm assuming the owner is near considering there is a video of it."

Why? Dogs are naturally comfortable with people, even those they don’t know. Cheetahs are quite a bit more cautious and wary of new situations; having a dog buddy to show them that everything is okay—and even fun—helps the cat feel comfortable and relaxed. The dog’s body language communicates that there’s nothing to fear, which relaxes and calms the cheetah’s flight tendencies. We introduce a puppy buddy when the cheetah is still a cub and naturally playful. By spending time together they get to know each other and become buddies.  You may see a buddy pair walking around Zoo grounds or playing in the Animal Ambassador Area."""

AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,EByrne,13,Thu Jun 18 05:37:32 2015 UTC,Cross-species social learning. That's awesome!
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,mordahl,6,Thu Jun 18 09:02:41 2015 UTC,"Social learning in animals:       Social learning involves the transfer of information from a more experienced individual to a naive one. A subset of social learning is observational learning in which a demonstrator influences the behavior of an observer such that the observer's behavior is altered in subsequent analogous situations.  Social learning has been observed in a variety of animal taxa, including fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals—especially primates.     Social learning is fundamentally different from individual learning, or asocial learning, which involves learning the appropriate responses to an environment through experience and trial and error.  Though asocial learning may result in the acquisition of reliable information, it is often costly for the individual to obtain.  Therefore, individuals that are able to capitalize on other individuals' self-acquired information may experience a fitness benefit.  However, because social learning relies on the actions of others rather than direct contact, it can be unreliable. This is especially true in variable environments, where appropriate behaviors may change frequently. Consequently, social learning is most beneficial in stable environments, in which predators, food, and other stimuli are not likely to change rapidly.   When social learning is actively facilitated by an experienced individual, it is classified as teaching. Mechanisms of inadvertent social learning relate primarily to psychological processes in the observer, whereas teaching processes relate specifically to activities of the demonstrator.   Studying the mechanisms of information transmission allows researchers to better understand how animals make decisions by observing others' behaviors and obtaining information.

It scared the hell out of me, but then it just bumbled into the loading dock like Hodor. Nicest dog  ever. Really stupid, but so sweet."

AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,MrSquigles,36,Thu Jun 18 00:09:40 2015 UTC,Maybe they're both jerks for refusing to share their... whatever it is?

AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,MrBogard,15,Thu Jun 18 02:59:02 2015 UTC,That's a small tiger.  Also if it grew up with the dogs. ..probably lost a few fights when it was a cub. ..

AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,3mpir3,-24,Thu Jun 18 02:22:57 2015 UTC,My UPS man swapped his route after he decided to stupidly deliver a package to the back door. Our Rottie wasn't having it busted out the door after him like a cliche 80s movie. Packages went flying and I'm pretty sure he pissed himself. He was shaking behind a tree by the time i caught up to them.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,memtiger,19,Thu Jun 18 02:50:21 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need to train your dogs better.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,BestPoopyBR,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:34:33 2015 UTC,No that's exactly what he trained the dog to do.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,Chiiwa,16,Thu Jun 18 16:45:46 2015 UTC,It's a shame that you've created a situation where your dog isn't trained to stop on command - and can get out of your house - so therefore you caused another person that much fear and anguish. :/
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,zipsgirl4life,-16,Thu Jun 18 04:22:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, spare me. My mom was trying to keep the door open so she could sign for the package while also keeping the door as closed as possible with her foot. Our Rottie ran between her legs.   There's no reason why a UPS man should be in our garage in our backyard (where the backdoor is). The dog was freaked out because it was not normal and knew we were a bit freaked out by someone knocking on that door. We were agitated so she was too.  Once she took off after him she stopped when i got outside and told her to heel. She wasn't going to attack. She was just barking trying to get him away. She always hated the delivery drivers for whatever reason. Couldn't care less about the neighbors."

Fuckers like you who can't train their animals are what make rotts have such a bad image."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,DatSergal,-11,Thu Jun 18 05:11:03 2015 UTC,"Dog did not attack a stranger. It was running toward him barking trying to get him to back away from ""the den"". That's not attacking.  Our dog saw my mom was freaked out. She was not talking to him normally. Our dog knew something was wrong. My mom still thinks to this day, the guy came to the back door to see if she was home alone to possibly take advantage of her. She was freaked.   The first command given to her was by me once i got outside. She stopped immediately.   You have no idea what you're talking about. You weren't there. You're talking or of your ass about a situation you know nothing about."
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,memtiger,8,Thu Jun 18 05:22:39 2015 UTC,Oh I'm sure your situation was completely unique and special! Just like everyone else! This clearly justifies it.

AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,memtiger,3,Thu Jun 18 05:30:52 2015 UTC,You have continually walked back from your original post.  Pretty soon we are going to find out your fully grown rottweiler is actually a chihuahua puppy and was just yipping out the window at a stranger wearing something similar to a mailman`s uniform.
AnimalsBeingJerks,3a7np5,CircularMatrix,2,Thu Jun 18 07:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, a dog running outside and scaring people is not acceptable. Especially a 100-200 pound Rottweiler who already has poor public image. It's people like you and stories about bad owners that keep the ""aggressive breeds"" unpopular."
