boating,3e31iy,ArcaneGlyph,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"First of all, Bayliner makes entry-level boats. They just aren't designed to last 25 years. As another poster posted, you may be better off with another boat.   I would guess that this is bad gauges, not the wiring. The gauges are exposed to the elements, and might not fare well over time, especially if the boat was left uncovered for a period of time. Milky oil (known as ""oil milkshake"") is the result of oil and water mixing. There is a leak in your sterndrive. It could have come from a bad seal, but if you see any cracks in your paint, it could also come from that. You'll need to have it inspected and rebuilt. You are doing the right thing by not using the boat until this is done - it will cause premature death of the sterndrive. If you can rebuild an engine, you can probably rebuild a sterndrive. They're nowhere near as complicated as a transmission. All the old boats I've seen have this problem. The battery switch is the way to go. In fact, I recommend dual batteries and a switch that lets you connect none, either one, or both. If you're ever listening to music while floating without the engine running, put it back to one battery so you can still start the boat with the other. The other option (also known as the ""right"" way) is to rewire the whole boat or test each wire with a multimeter to see which one is causing a draw. It sounds like you're missing an air filter. It may also be an engine compartment blower - many boats have a blower designed to remove fuel fumes from the engine compartment before starting the boat.    I'm also a bit curious what 120 hp boat would need 3 carbs. That doesn't seem right.  That's all I know without knowing what engine you have."

I've said it before on here and I'll say it again...repowering a boat does not mean that every cent spent putting that new engine in adds to the value of the boat, you are just returning it to the condition it was meant to be in. Now, that doesn't mean it shouldn't increase the value some amount, because you WOULD be paying for a better condition boat, but the value added is not 100% no matter what the current owner thinks. Compare it to the market...it's the only true way to gauge the value. Here in Maine I wouldn't pay a cent over $6k for that boat....and even then, I'd have to love it.

Here is some additional information I found on Wikipedia for those that may be interested:   A is powered by two MAN RK280 diesel engines providing approximately 9,000 kW (12,000 hp), sufficient to give the yacht a maximum speed of 23 knots (43 km/h; 26 mph).[4] At its cruising speed of 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph) it can cover 6,500 nautical miles (12,000 km; 7,500 mi) in under sixteen days before its 750,000 L (160,000 imp gal; 200,000 US gal) fuel tank is empty.[4]  Typically for a mega yacht, A is decorated, equipped, and staffed to an extremely opulent standard. There is almost 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) of interior space, including 2,500 square feet (230 m2) for the master suite.[14] Starck, known for his occasionally risqué design choices, also added a secret ""nookie room"" hidden behind mirrored panels.[14] Mirrored surfaces feature extensively throughout the interior, along with Baccarat crystal which is used not only for the glassware and tableware, but for the furniture too.[14] There are six guest suites, although they have moving walls and can be converted to four larger staterooms.[13] Much of the interior design was completed by Aleksandra Melnichenko who, as the owner's new wife, battled with designer Starck over features commissioned when her husband was still a bachelor.[13][26] The original discothèque was down-sized, while the suites' decor was toned down, although it still included leather or white stingray hides on the walls and ceilings, and crocodile-skinned furniture.[13][26] Above-deck there is a helipad and swimming pool forward of the superstructure and two more pools aft, one of which is glass-bottomed and can be viewed from the below-deck disco.[14][31]  37 staff are employed on the vessel, and there are living quarters for five more staff accompanying the owners or their guests.[1][14] Security is tightly controlled, with 44 mm (1.7 in)-thick bomb-proof glass in the windows, over 40 CCTV cameras, motion sensors, biometric fingerprint/keypad entry for restricted areas, and a rumoured escape pod in case of emergencies.[13][14]  Aside from the yacht itself, the two main tenders—one open and one covered—and a third sports tender have also been designed by Starck, and built by Vaudrey Miller of New Zealand.[32] They are all 10–11 metres (33–36 ft) long, and reputedly cost $1 million each.[33] The total cost of A has never been officially confirmed, but $300 million has been the most frequently cited estimate.[10][34][35][36]"

That fixes the speedometer and fuel level issues.   I really don't know much about the ski pole so can't offer advice on it.   Instead of buying a trailer can you put the boat in a marina or in a high and dry storage for the boating season?  I have found I used to spend the same amount on trailering as I would have storing the boat on the water when I had a boat that was on a trailer.   For the steering check under the wheel and make sure there isn't a thumb screw that you can loosen or tighten under there it may be all the way tight if that isn't the issue grease the steering cable and the tube it attaches to under the motor. If that doesn't work it may need a new steering cable.

boating,3dxljl,anonymous_reddituser,3,Mon Jul 20 11:37:42 2015 UTC,If you're going to run through a full tank of fuel every day or so then no it probably doesn't matter but if you're going to leave gas in the motor just sitting then over time the ethanol will dissolve any soft rubber parts like gaskets and the like. Non ethanol will do it too it just takes longer.
boating,3dxljl,anonymous_reddituser,2,Mon Jul 20 11:43:18 2015 UTC,So mix in some ethenol eater if it's going to sit?
boating,3dxljl,vikinghoney,2,Mon Jul 20 11:46:18 2015 UTC,Certainly better than nothing but most of those products are just modern day snake oil. Find a gas station in your area that sells non ethanol gas (pure-gas.org if you need to find one) and just pay the money for the right stuff. I'm lucky that there's two gas stations by me that sell it right at the dock but I use to fill 4 jerry cans and haul it back and forth to my boat. For what its worth I've never run ethanol gas in my mercruiser and the carb has never been cleaned in 25 years...still runs like a top.
boating,3dxljl,gnomeshell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:05:16 2015 UTC,"First, congratulations on the new boat!  Is there a difference between ethanol blend (regular gas) vs ethanol free, yes. Yes there really is. None of the comments thus far have discussed the most important consideration. Gasoline, all gasolines will go bad over time.  The primary issue with using Ethanol in gasoline is that Ethanol is a hydrophilic compound, that naturally attracts water. What this means is that over time, your gasoline will have more and more water in it. This process is commonly called phase separation. Google has a number of scholarly articles describing the process.  Boat US also has a great site explaining the issues and independent party test results  If you don't believe the pictures, you can easily recreate the experiment yourself, simply get 3 mason jars, put ethanol free gas in one, regular gas in the second and regular gas + stabilizer in the third. Wait about 6 months (i.e. over the winter) and you will see a surprising amount of water in regular gas.    The question to ask yourself, is when spring comes next year, how much water are you comfortable with running through your engine?"
boating,3dxljl,captdet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info will deff take your advice
boating,3dxljl,gnomeshell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"yes it matters. Unless you run the gas out of the motor every time.  I use ethanol free with sta-bil in my boat. Mostly because it will usually sit for at least a week, if not more in between runs. Granted its garage kept but my garage still gets hot in the summer.  Also its a good idea to keep the tank full at all times. Boats have open fuel systems (as opposed to a closed system like what is used in a car), so air can contact the gas, which is what causes it to denature. this happens to both ethanol based and ethanol free gasoline. So keeping the gas tank full while the boat sits, allows for a little less air in the tank, and thus less to react with the gas and denature it. I run my boat most weekends that I can you have to keep in mind. In the winter (when it sits) I run the gas out of the motor (pull the gas line and run the motor till it shuts off) and empty the gas tank and relegate what is in there to burn gas. (keep in mind I only keep a 6 gallon tank, I fish from a Carolina skiff, not a bass boat. And again my boat is garage kept so I don't need to winterize for freezing)  Other must haves for me fishing...  trolling motor and depth finder. Depth finder to mark things like hazards/stumps and hot spots, keep track of where you have been etc. Trolling motor allows you to manuerver the boat, with less noise, and hold a spot or adjust for better position.  I really don't even like fishing boats without a trolling motor these days.  Other things I keep on my boat.   anchor. Even though I rarely use it, if im ever in a position where im broken down, I don't want to be drifting.  throwable flotation device (requirement as per state regs).  life jacket for each person (requirement as per state regs).  flare gun and up to date flares (requirement as per state regs).  Whistle or horn (requirement as per state regs)  fire extinguisher ( requirement for a boat over 16 ft with enclosed gas tank as per state regs but a good idea regardless)  fenders for the few occaisons I may dock at a public place (ie to eat, get gas etc). Public docks aren't always soft wand cushy).  ropes for launching, in case someone needs a tow etc. I typically keep a 15 ft, and 25 ft dock line at least.  dry bag with towels, phone, first aid kit, fire starter, maybe even a handheld marine radio if going in the ocean. Its also yello and floaty. I like floaty things on boats. I also carry more water/drinks than I would ever need for that day.  Bag with spare prop, prop grease, 2x4 to change prop, and some basic tools like zip ties, screw drivers, sockets etc. Yes I have used them. I use an aluminum prop, and have had to change a prop in the field to get home. 2 aluminum props is still cheaper than a stainless one as well.  mask and fins. Again, see above, but there have been times I need to get in the water to check or fix something. Helps to be able to see and maneuver. Plus they are fun.  compass   I also usually carry some pliers, sunscreen, a knife or two, wear my watch etc.  I have been in some positions where all of this comes very handy. When you go out in nature, you have to accept that others may not be there to help, and your boat may sink or break down, leaving you to fend for yourself for a bit (and yes its happened to me)."

boating,3dz4cn,harshhobgoblin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:59 2015 UTC,So the first thing you do is you go buy a handheld laser temp gauge. should be at any hardware store for about 10-15bucks. Go out and run it on the water and while your going lift the hatch and temp the engine with it. should be at like 145degrees. After that you actually know what temp your engine is running at and can go from there after.
boating,3dz4cn,InvalidConflict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"145 degrees on the block or the exhaust? Once I find out it is/is not overheating, I still need to figure out the gauge issue.

boating,3duk0t,StuffaYouFace,4,Sun Jul 19 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"Here's an article with some common courtesies and what not for anchoring. http://cruising.coastalboating.net/Seamanship/Anchoring/Etiquette.html I will admit it was just a quick search online. I didn't read the full article so there may be things that aren't correct.   30 days is a long time to plan to be anchored in one spot. Generally if you're going to do something like that you're going to want to find a transient slip somewhere in my opinion. Or an open mooring location designated for such a thing. That may be harder to find than a transient slip though.   I would say bottom line is, don't anchor anywhere that you may pose a navigational hazard. For example, don't anchor in any harbors, channels, under bridges, if you aren't planning on running lights all night take that into account and make sure you're safely buried in a Harbor or Bay etc. I know it seems like common sense but people tend to forget common sense on the water.   If you find a spot that isn't seeing a lot of other boat traffic during the day indicating it's a popular hangout spot and you also aren't posing a navigational hazard as mentioned above, you could just drop anchor and see how it goes. If someone doesn't like you there they'll let you know either over the radio or by getting close enough to yell.   TL;DR: Use common sense. Also, you're safest and you keep others safe by being in a spot that's designed to accommodate boats over night/for extended periods of time even if that means you have to pay for it."
boating,3duk0t,Hurly26,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a free place to live on your boat permanently, good luck.  Anywhere that has any services (water, fuel, food, etc..) is eventually going to come and make you move.  I'm not sure on B.C. specific laws, but most cities have derelict vessel laws that allow them to impound a boat left unattended for too long.  If you are generally cruising and are just hoping to take a break and stay for a while, they will be much more welcoming.  B.C. obviously has thousands of bays and harbours where anchoring is legal and welcomed, but they are pretty far flung from civilization.  I like to tell people: if you're thinking of living on a boat because it is cheaper and/or you won't get hassled by the authorities....don't.  You are much better off finding some cabin in the middle of nowhere if that's what you want."

boating,3dsjhs,pokeyjones,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:18:42 2015 UTC,I agree.  How old are the plugs?  Changed within the last couple of years? Probably not if you have never seen plugs like this before.  Maybe the plugs are just bad now.  Put new ones in and see if it lights back up.  They do look pretty cruddy and if all the gas mixture is proper that's what I would try first.  I swap the plugs every fall when winterizing the motor.

boating,3drzex,Dendrimer14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:28 2015 UTC,Just FYI here is the unit I need  Thanks!
boating,3dqfzt,Stink_agian,2,Sat Jul 18 13:24:14 2015 UTC,Sounds about normal. Some Mercury motors have a thermostat that doesn't let water pee until it reaches operating temperature. My buddies 15hp merc does it and it freaks you out at first.  Muffs should provide plenty of water flow at idle and you should absolutely never rev an outboard on muffs or even in neutral. Outboards are designed for back end load and running in neutral/muffs has no load and motor can be damaged...the worst being it runs away and is basically a bomb. Put the outboard in a tank or just go put it in the water and feel the temp of the pee water. I bet it's pretty warm since is a big engine and engines need heat for compression. Everything you said sounds pretty normal and I'm sure you did a decent job putting the impeller in.
boating,3dqfzt,jacobirobinson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:51:37 2015 UTC,Thanks. That makes me feel better. I do rev it in neutral when starting. Should I not do that?  I had a mechanic that hod done it many times help me with the impeller so I'm pretty confident it's right.
boating,3dqfzt,billybishop4242,2,Sun Jul 19 01:58:11 2015 UTC,Yes. This. Doesn't pump til thermostat tells it it needs to. Then is hot for a bit while the water catches up with the heat.
boating,3dqfzt,billybishop4242,2,Wed Jul 22 06:31:33 2015 UTC,No you are doing fine. Motor is working perfectly.
boating,3dqfzt,billybishop4242,2,Wed Jul 22 06:37:51 2015 UTC,Had this exact motor in my family for 2 generations.   Always made us nervous waiting for it to start pissing out water from the tell tail. Never a problem with the motor in almost 20 years.   Is 100% normal for this model. Relax. But preventative maintenance is the only way to fly.
boating,3dqfzt,drewtam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:30:08 2015 UTC,Are you saying that your primary concern is during flushing? How are you flushing? Via the garden hose adapter or water muffs on the bottom inlets or some other method?
boating,3dqfzt,drewtam,2,Sat Jul 18 13:57:04 2015 UTC,I notice it while flushing. I use the muffs with the garden hose on the bottom inlets. I'm going out today and will check it while running in salt water then.
boating,3dqfzt,billybishop4242,3,Sat Jul 18 14:23:24 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that explains it. I think most of the water muffs on the market are notoriously bad about supplying insufficient water to engines. Garden hose flow rate is just too low, and if one tries to increase the flow with a pump then the seal around the lower unit is too  poor to put it adequately into the impeller. Finally, on most of the engines I've seen, they often have multiple inlet (front nose + side), and the muffs can only supply one of these. So the other lets the water flow out and suck in air.    My opinion is that these standard units should only be used for short periods of time at idle. Because of the problems with poor water supply and overheating, my coworker and I designed and built our own water muffs with better sealing and then attached a 1.5hp water pump and water reservoir to it, and we seal up the front nose inlet on the lower. That lets us do all kinds of loaded testing on the engine out of water without any air suction and over heating."
boating,3dqfzt,drewtam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:43:44 2015 UTC,No!!!  This is normal for this motor. It has a thermostat. Doesn't pump til it needs to.   Boot is fine. It only needs a little water.   He is only noticing it at home when his watching it. On the water he is looking the other way. It does the same thing in the water. He should be watching the tell tail on the water tho. That's where a stray piece of seaweed can ruin your day.   Plus this motor goes batshit when it actually overheats.
boating,3dqfzt,billybishop4242,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:35:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think I agree with almost anything you just said, I could be wrong on this particular model cause I am talking about experience on Yamaha 250s and Verados, but...    Generally the pump is directly driven off the crank, take off a lower unit and check yourself. It is splined to the engine output shaft and runs when the engine runs. The thermostats only recycle the water until it is hot on the discharge. On the engines I've seen, the tell tale bypasses the 'stats.    What I have noticed is that the tell tale is significantly colder than the hot main discharge at the lower unit and at hot the thermostats. The water at the discharge ports in the lower unit and out of the thermostats is ~80-90degC. But the tell tale is only a few degrees warmer than the supply (lake) water (~30-35degC)."

boating,3drb80,Sleepycarlstoes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"I'd check for any air leaks between the tank and filter. There is an O-ring in most hose fittings that attach to the tank that might be nicked or worn.

boating,3dqmsy,Sleepycarlstoes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"Does the engine have a carburetor? If so, it sounds like an air / fuel mixture issue to me.  If you have to give it a lot of throttle just to get it to turn over, it might be that the choke is open more than it should be. If that's the case, then it would be pretty hard to get it to idle, as it would require a lot of fuel to mix with the extra air being sucked in.   You might want to check the idle adjust screw that regulates the air / gas mixture going into the engine.   I have a 1966 Fiberform 19 with a OMC engine (based off a Buick 3.7L V6 'Oddfire' engine). It's taken a few months to get her dialed in, but now she fires right up and purrs like a kitten!

There's a hot air choke (that's what my buddy said it is who knows more than I) and when we opened it up by hand and the barrels opened more to allow more air she fired up in the water. Looks like the carb needs tuned. Might find someone who does it for a living to take care of that."

boating,3douf4,millelacsmojo,4,Sat Jul 18 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a pain in the ass when it comes to maintenance and like things to be done correctly. Typically for a situation involving rot you replace the entire transom but for your case I would get a rubber mallet with a smaller head (harbor freight has a nice selection) and give the transom a solid tap all around. If it does not extend too far you will be ok. It should feel similar to hitting concrete... If you feel any sign of softness I would go ahead and try to create either a perfect circle or square cut out of the damaged area. From there you can make a piece of marine plywood same thickness as transom core that fits nice and snug and coat it in west epoxy and pop it in there. From there I would sand fiberglass around the area a few inches back each direction and clean with acetone and tack clothe. Then coat in west epoxy, apply biaxial mat fiberglass, and completely coat in more epoxy. From there you can sand it down and paint.  Do not use 3M 5200 as any form for structural support. Do not use epoxy alone for structural support. Those are adhesives and sealers not structural supports. You can get fillers such as west 404 to mix with epoxy and it has structural properties but don't do epoxy alone.  I would definitely drill holes near the bottom center of the transom to see if it's holding water. You can drill them out then let it sit for a while to get any moisture out. After that sand surrounding area, clean with acetone and tack clothe then fill with epoxy mixed with filler.  Of course you can hit the hole with a heat gun and pack it with hardware store grade latex caulk but it won't last more than a year or 2."

boating,3donaz,sandman1969,2,Sat Jul 18 00:01:20 2015 UTC,"It should be fairly simple. I'm on mobile so this might be hard to explain. The should be a odd shaped piece that pushes the throttle linkage by the bottom carb. Connecting to the odd shaped piece is a small shaft with threads on both ends. Adjusting that shaft should open or close your carbs at WOT. Doing this will also increase your idle speed. So remember where that odd piece touches the throttle linkage? There should be a small flat headed bolt there,  this bolt is encentric so turning it one way or the other will increase or decrease the idle speed. You want to aim for 800-900 rpm while in forward in the water. Sorry if this sounds confusing. Make sure the check out the iboats.com forums, lots of good stuff there.

boating,3dmmb1,temple_noble,6,Fri Jul 17 14:31:27 2015 UTC,The last year that tracker made a 20' bass buggy was 1988. giving him the benefit of the doubt and saying both it and the motor are 88 models you are looking at a book value of around $3000 before the trailer. That trailer is definitely not worth $2k.  if you want to proceed regardless then get up under the deck with something pointy and look for soft spots in the floor. Raise the seats and do the same thing with the seat bases. If he won't splash the boat to at least get the motor up to temp it's a pass for sure.   35 hp might get you up to 15mph... might  trolling motor and livewell installation shouldn't be difficult. You are definitely talking about putting a separate battery on plus a water pump to aerate.   bottom line is that he's probably high on his price to start with. even if the boat is in top shape.

boating,3dmmb1,bilgewax,2,Fri Jul 17 16:15:55 2015 UTC,"Pontoons usually have a metal transom, and one of that particular era would most likely have an aluminum transom with a thick plywood sheet on there for reinforcement and for the engine clamps to have something to sink its teeth into. That is an easy fix, but will take a little bit of time to get the motor off and replace the wood IF IT NEEDS IT.   Structural stuff other than that, walk on the deck. Pontoons of that era will have a wood plywood deck. You will notice right away if any of the boards are rotten...just walk around. Next thing to check are the pontoons for rust, deep gashes (from a rock or similar), or holes. The pontoons being aluminum, should be solid.   That motor is quite old. A recent problem I ran into with a motor, was with a problem with seals. Depending on where you live, ethanol gas was introduced around 2006, and these motors were not built for ethanol...so if the owner was using regular gas (premium is typically ethanol free) then you might have some issues with seals or compression.  the next thing to check for motors, is the compression.   For a pontoon that old, I would say that it is fairly pricey. With an engine that old, you never really know what you are getting, and a new motor (or used) can cost almost as much as the entire pontoon.  livewell can be installed...all you need is a pump with a switch and a container for the water and fish. A trolling motor is probably a bad idea on a barge because of the height off of the water, and the size of the boat. Just use the normal motor..."

boating,3dlt1f,ilovebacondoyou,4,Fri Jul 17 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"Other than the gear that you're required to have by law, here's what I would think about...   Make sure the drain plug is in the back of the boat! Make sure your engines are ""peeing"", meaning cooling water is coming out of the top part of the engine somewhere. Make sure there's a decent flow and not just a dribble. Does the bilge pump work? I'd get some dock lines and a line long enough to tow or be towed with. Bring a basic tool kit, enough to change spark plugs and a shear pin. Do you have spare shear pins (or do your outboards use them)? This is the ""weak link"" in your transmission that is designed to break first if your prop hits something. They're usually pretty easy to replace. Figure out what fuses are on the boat and bring a few spares. There's usually one under the engine cowl as well.   If you have some time before you take it out, change both impellers since you have no idea of the history. You should also pull the props and grease the splines.  Good luck and fair sailing!"
boating,3dlt1f,Guygan,2,Fri Jul 17 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is exactly the kind of list I was looking for!  The drain plug is in and he has never taken it out, he just took out all the water/moisture with a sponge before winter he said?  The bilge pump is manual I think, if you mean the pump to get water out of the boat?  I got 2x5meter 10mm lines/rope today, might get another longer one for towing as you say, good point.  Tool kit is a good idea, will also look into this extra shear pin thing, I have extra spark plugs at least.. extra fuses I will also check!

boating,3diul9,67Mustang-Man,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i feel the article is trying to oversell motors.  There's nothing wrong with a bigger motor than you really need necessarily other than the expense and setup. However, expense is a big one because they can get pricey fast.  There isn't always a noticeable difference in a few more thrust pounds once you hit a certain minimum for your setup.  Matching a motor to a boat only does so much, you need the weight to be balanced to reduce drag properly. A properly balanced boat with a smaller motor will often perform as well or better than a larger motor on an improperly balanced boat."

boating,3devkb,NoeticIntelligence,8,Wed Jul 15 18:53:39 2015 UTC,"Get something on a trailer - even the smallest of cars should be able to pull a ~13' boat or so.  When you purchase a boat, you're going to have to register it (and probably the motor, and likely the trailer, depending on which state you live).  If you're out on the water, DNR (or whichever regulatory agency your state has) can and will stop you.  Frequently.  They're going to want to see life jackets, a throwable cushion, fire extinguisher, a whistle, possibly an oar and various other things - having a life jacket on a boat usually isn't an option.    Take your time, look around, ask lots of questions and look into a boater safety course.  See if you can find someone in your area that will take you out on the water - who knows, you may hate it.    In the event you do love it, start small.  Look into a little jon boat maybe.  They're lightweight, tough, can take lots of abuse and you can get around most coastal areas (when the weather cooperates).  You can always move up once you're comfortable - but buy too much of a boat and you're going to get in over your head and regret it.    Lastly, have fun - and be safe!"

Many people fish off of them but it is not practical but defiantly doable. Seems the standard engine size for these boats are 8-15 HP depending on the size, like with anything more horsepower more fun. You could leave the zodiac to go swim, many people use them as dive boats. Also since you have a station wagon, it would be best to tow a zodiac most come with a trailer if you are buying used since deflating and inflating constantly could cause creases that would be needed to get patched up."

Very easy to maintain, low cost, long lasting, highly customizable (based on your skill and willingness to do so), and work in so many applications from rivers to lakes and ponds and even some ocean with the right jon boat hull.      If you'll be on calm waters then a flat of modified-v would be fine, if you're going to the ocean, you want a v-hull, rides deeper in the water and can handle waves better than the other two I mentioned."
boating,3devkb,AndrewWaldron,3,Wed Jul 15 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"An inflatable boat seems like a good idea for what you want it for. You will find that using a small trailer will be a big convenience. A small outboard motor like a 3 or 4 hp will get you around in 3 person boat, but a 9.9 hp will get you zipping around. The capacity plate in the boat will give you the Max HP rating of a motor (and persons). You really don't have to worry too much about tipping it over while climbing in and out of it. They usually have at least 3 compartments, so they won't sink if one get's punctured, so the engine should not go under. Also, even if the thing filled up with water from say a large wave, it won't sink and the engine shouldn't get swamped. If the engine fell in salt water, all is not lost. A outboard motor shop could get it back running again, but it would be best to get it there pronto. Don't sweat the occasional fishing/fish hook thing. As stated, regulations require a life jacket.

boating,3d9hc9,EORA,2,Tue Jul 14 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"One thing on getting CT licensing is that it probably won't ""transfer"" if you go to FL or elsewhere. There is no nationally standardized recreational boating license/certification. Neighboring states will sometimes accept each other's, and plenty states only have an age requirement. I'm almost certain the Coast Guard licenses are all you need for smaller commercial operation anywhere in US waters.

boating,3d2yza,15dollarcat,2,Mon Jul 13 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"I had an old fuel line disintegrate on the inside. That put little black chunks into my fuel filter and pretty much starved the engine for fuel. I've also seen old fuel lines look 100% perfect on the outside but they've swelled up to a tiny interior diameter.   Some outboards use a mechanical fuel pump that's almost like a reed valve, using pulses from the combustion chamber to flap a reed as a one-way valve to push fuel into the carb. That could have a bunch of crap in it. Enough fuel gets by to feed it at low speeds but not enough to feed it when you want to go fast."
boating,3d2yza,Flowmaster44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:54:32 2015 UTC,Sorry for the late reply none of these comments popped up into my inbox. Fuel lines are brand new lines that I replaced 2 months ago. Fuel pump is a filter pump combo.  Non sure how to check to see if the pump is working properly as it runs of the crank case pressure for it to pump. I just checked the compression. Top is at 107 lbs and the bottom is 110 pounds which seems good to me. Spark I tried but I had no help and it would not a pear on my camera.

boating,3d0lt0,SabotPetals,4,Sun Jul 12 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"My family had a couple of pontoons on a lake when I was growing up. The decking material does like to rot out on pontoons because in most cases its just thick plywood. Rain just sits on the floor surface and they rot. The carpet could look great but you've got a mess beneath it.   The seats on older pontoon boats have wooden frames. Those like to rot out along the floor. The good part is the seats open up so you can store your gear (like life vests) inside them but that also gives you a good view of the interior of the seats so you can check out the seat frames.   On a lake you're not really dealing with current unless the water level is really high and you've water spilling over a dam. Some people get away with electric motors like those made by Ray but you're not going anywhere fast. And you have to contend with charging batteries and sometimes buying new ones. I've found its easier to dump gas into a tank and go out for some fun. No waiting for batteries to charge.   The boats my family had growing up both had 25hp outboards. One was a Yamaha and the other was a Mercury. Both were good engines. The Yamaha was on an ancient 26 foot pontoon boat. It'd move, but there's no way you were going to tow anyone behind it on a tube or water ski off of it. The boat had enough speed to go around a lake. You weren't going to get hurt too badly at those speeds unless you drove into someone's dock.   The other pontoon we had was a 21 foot Sylvan with a 25hp on it and that was a great mix for the lake. A shorter boat meant easier maneuverability at the docks and a 25hp on a shorter/lighter boat meant we had a bit more speed and power. That was a great boat.   I've seen boats out on lakes (decent size pontoon boats, like 24s or 25s) with 9.9 and 15 hp engines. Those pontoon boats were slow but people seemed to be out having fun on them anyway.   New engines are 4 stroke meaning the engine has separate gas and oil. Many older outboards are 2 strokes. Either you have to mix the oil in with the fuel when you're putting fuel in the tank or you have to keep filling up a small reservoir in the outboard. Oil injected 2 strokes are just fine, I have one currently. With a five thousand dollar budget you'll probably be looking at some older outboards.  Ask the sellers of these boats about service history and if there is any documentation as to when the water pump in the outboard was last replaced. The water pump circulates water from the lake through your engine keeping it cool. They're usually hard rubber and can get cracked and break if they haven't been replaced in a few years. That can lead to big problems like the engine overheating, cracking from the heat, or bits of the rubber pump impeller getting stuck inside the water passages of the engine, requiring a mechanic to take it all apart and get the pieces out.   Budget money for stuff your boat will need. Each passenger will need their own life jacket so if you ever plan on having like 8 people on the boat, you need to have 8 life jackets aboard. Some places require that the boater carry a paddle, a signaling device,a fire extinguisher, and maybe some other equipment.   If your boat comes with a trailer, make sure it has a title. For that matter, make sure the boat itself has a title too. Without a title, it may be hard or impossible to get a title for the boat in your name. That little piece of paper shows that the seller legally has ownership of the vessel/trailer and its probably not stolen. If someone on craigslist tries to sell you a boat really cheap with no title, be a little suspicious because that boat might be hot."
boating,3d0lt0,Flowmaster44,2,Sun Jul 12 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"Great write up, I'd like to emphasize the importance of a fire extinguisher.  My friends little old boat caught on fire last week, instinvtivly he started splashing water on it, but being a gas/oil fire, this only spread the flames.  Luckily  he had a fire extinguisher nearby so he was able to put it out using that."
boating,3d0lt0,A_Cave_Man,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"I have never had a pontoon,  but I have been around them enough to know a little.   $5k is going to get you a ~20 year old boat that may need work. If you push it to $10 - $15k, you are going to get someting in much better condition. Having said that, there is nothing wrong going with a $5k boat as starter. Just make sure the floor is solid. It is very common for pontoons to need new decking.   I wouldn't go under 40hp on the motor. Even 40hp will likely leave you desiring more power, especially if you want to tube. I would want to go at least 70hp. I boat on rivers and see 40hp motors, but they struggle against the current at times.   I know nothing about outboards, so have no advice for what to look for, but I am sure this sub is full of others who do."

boating,3d13za,I_have_teef,3,Sun Jul 12 17:26:53 2015 UTC,The water heater is probably 110 only so it will likely only work on shore power.  There should be a breaker for it somewhere.  The fresh water pump should pressurize the system then shut off.  If it isn't turning off either the pressure switch is bad or you have a leak somewhere.

It likely runs off the 12v system, not shore power. The Hot Water Heater is likely heated by shore power source and also possibly by a heat exchanger from the engine, so check for a hose from the engine to the heater tank. If away from shore power, run that engine to heat your water and charge your batteries if you don't have a genset."

A 350 can in some cases be approaching simply unacceptable for use in towing for water sports in a boat that size, though for just goofing around it's better.  The larger engine will have little or no economy penalty because you don't have to push a big engine as hard to go the same speed as the smaller one. This can benefit the larger engine in terms of wear and tear as well."
