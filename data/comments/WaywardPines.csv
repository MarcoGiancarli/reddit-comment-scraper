But seriously, the people in WP were never given a choice if they want to be part of this new society or not. That's the first and biggest mistake Pilcher made. Everything else, from surveillance to Reckonings, just made it worse. And Pilcher just sees it as colleteral damage, as his true focus are the children, who are supposed to worship him after they've gone through the indoctrination process. The ends don't always justify the means."

WaywardPines,3dxgjj,gothicm3rcy,7,Mon Jul 20 09:53:38 2015 UTC,"The hair thing's been discussed - it's likely a production error in that scene. Or (more inventively) someone pointed out that the long-hair flashbacks are from Pilcher's POV whereas the early episode flashbacks are not; perhaps that's how he always imagines himself when thinking back? ;-) But really, it's a production error and probably a result of shooting the pilot before the rest of it.  On the other stuff - according to the books supposedly all the resources they would need were sealed in evacuated storage rooms within a fully maintained environment. Animals were produced using a artificial womb technique, a technology developed in the final decades before the facility went into full hibernation.  Are we really at the state where people think time travel is a more likely explanation for things than the development of fairly mundane technology? Things such as long-term storage facilities and gene-based tech for food and animal growth are not really a stretch. Remember, Pilcher's business was based around exactly that.  Not explicitly showing something in the show =/= ridiculous plot hole:   If they'd spent two episodes listing how they did everything, it would have been pretty tedious, and a bit strange - not the sort of thing Ethan would be interested in. The fact of WP's existence means that those technologies must have been in place and that people didn't discover it.   Do you wake up every day finding plot holes in your life because you don't understand how the technology works in detail? No, you know it must work, even though so much of our world is incredibly unlikely when you ponder it, because it is there and you do exist! ;-)  Agreed about the ""older, balding"" hair error though - irritating. I understand they needed to show Pilcher+Hassler but he could have had a hat on or something at least.  Wayward Pines Timeline  The show is set in 4028 entirely. All the ""present day, 2014"" stuff is flashback. The true sequence of events is (some years approximate):  1990-2020: Pilcher, Pam, Pope have been setting up a project since the 1990s to gather people, hibernate them, wake them up after all the bad stuff has passed.  2014: Kate and the other guy go missing in Wayward Pines.  2014: Ethan goes to investigate and gets involved in an (arranged) car crash at Wayward Pines, is hibernated.  2014: Pilcher meets Adam Hassler and says it's already been done. (NOTE: A production error means Pilcher's hair is ""older, balder"" in this scene, which is confusing.)  2014: Theresa and Ben go looking for Ethan. Sheriff Pope arranges for a crash. They get hibernated.  2020: Pilcher, Pam, Pope, the whole team go into hibernation.  4014: Pilcher, Pam, Pope and the team get woken up. Start to fix up Wayward Pines, build the fence, etc. Group A gets woken up, it goes wrong. Group B gets woken.  4016: Kate gets woken.  4028: Ethan gets woken  4028: Events of the TV show begin. There are occasional flashbacks showing 2014."
WaywardPines,3dxgjj,TriumphantGeorge,-7,Mon Jul 20 12:34:19 2015 UTC,Are we really at the state where people think time travel is a more likely explanation for things than the development of fairly mundane technology?   I think time travel is more likely than cryogenic storage of live humans.
WaywardPines,3dxgjj,cimpire_enema,8,Mon Jul 20 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm. See, I can imagine ways in which cryosleep could be developed based on current scientific knowledge. I can't imagine how time travel could be, in the way it would need to to appear in this story.  Assuming we're sticking to scientific plausibility rather than ""movie-science"":  -- Suspended animation is a thing in science, hibernation is a thing in nature. Living beings have been put into a version of suspended animation; animals have gone into hibernation.  -- ""Time"", meanwhile, is an abstract concept. Nobody has ever travelled in time. Not even forwards. All there has been is the observation of change, and relative rates of change.  Maybe Pilcher's hair can be explained away by variable rates of change. He stopped using his Rogain in preparation for hibernation..."
WaywardPines,3dxgjj,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"Even assuming cryogenic preservation of live humans is possible given current technology, the amount of power necessary for that to happen on a large scale would be immense.  Envisioning a power plant (regardless of source) being able to operate even 5 decades without any sort of maintenance stretches belief.  The idea of a maintenance-free power source that could reliably preserve people in cold storage for 200 decades is just magical thinking.    Suspended animation may be a thing in science, but magic power sources are not.  Therefore, I maintain that time travel is more likely than cryogenic storage of live humans for 2000 years."
WaywardPines,3dxgjj,cimpire_enema,7,Mon Jul 20 17:06:38 2015 UTC,"if we're talking suspension of belief for a vaguely sci-fi TV show, I'm more inclined to go with a long-lasting, low-maintenance power source having been developed by 2030ish, rather than a time-travel machine...  But of course, sci-fi is not about explaining every last detail of a situation. It just has to be reasonably grounded, to form the background of the actual story - which is usually about people.  EDIT:   It's interesting this, though. Why would someone think that time travel was more likely than a long-lasting power source or a managed environment? I think it's because it's easier to imagine something happening if you don't go into the details - if you have less knowledge about it.   You can imagine the problems associated with a power source, because you know what ones exist and you can visualise the difficulties over time. You are actually dealing with the finer parts of the situation in your mind. For time-travel, you just imagine something like a machine that you get in and it shifts. It seems somehow less of a hurdle... because you're not actually trying to imagine how it works in exact terms, with components and so on.  We emphasise the difficulties of things we know something about, however vague, because we imagine them in finer detail; we under-emphasise the difficulties of things we are ignorant about because we imagine them in very broad terms.  This means our suspension of belief tends to be applied exactly the wrong way around."
WaywardPines,3dxgjj,TriumphantGeorge,3,Mon Jul 20 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"cimpire_enema said (and then deleted just before I hit save):   Time travel will likely never be a reality, but it will be invented long before a power plant that can last 2000+ years with no maintenance. The story is not reasonably grounded.   So, are you really saying that if it turned out to be time-travel, you would be happier with this series? ;-)  Let's be real: if we were going to base our suspension of disbelief on present power technology, most future sci-fi would be out the window. And I can happily enjoy Ex Machina and Humans despite there being no way technologically (we will absolutely never make a conscious machine), because the story isn't about that. I can even enjoy Interstellar despite the science being pretty much nonsense overall (because hey, it was about ""love"").  Sci-fi isn't really about technology or physics, it uses those ideas to pose ""what if"" scenarios which are otherwise not explorable. Those scenarios are usually about what it is to be a person in a situation.   Wayward Pines isn't about how to vac-pac cars or maintain an electrical supply or any of its technology. (As in all sci-fi, the technology is defined by its function, not by its fictional workings.) It's about truth vs comfort, surveillance and control, the freedom to choose, misguided morality, and more. Although mostly it's just about some guy ending up playing God...   Author Blake Crouch was inspired to write Pines following a visit to a high-altitude small town in Colorado. Anyone who has visited, say, Telluride, will be familiar with the setting – idyllic yet inaccessible, potentially inescapable, walled in on all sides by mountains and tall trees. “I got this creepy sense of what would happen if one guy owned every building, every house in this town? And what if I was stuck here and I couldn’t leave?”  -- The Guardian"

(I am not finished the books so can't spoil any endings!) Resource was held in huge warehouses where they created a vacuum - allowing minimal deterioration. They essentially started the creation of livestock through a scientifically created cow's womb. There are fruits and vegetables grown in the town.  I wonder if the Pilcher age thing was a big mistake on the creators parts, as that was in the pilot episode? But I have no idea.   I always think it's weird how in 2000 years, nobody discovered this huge superstructure with hundreds of people in suspended animation and tonnes of resource. The whole world is in ruins but their superstructure survived, wahoo!  I still love it all though."
WaywardPines,3duc32,oklahomarabbit,6,Sun Jul 19 15:37:24 2015 UTC,"So here’s my take on a pre-finale series wrap-up (if that makes any sense): I enjoyed WP by and large. It’s just that for every good thing I have to say about WP, there is always a “but”. I like the premise of WP, but I don’t like the execution. I like the general theme of free will vs dictatorship, but I don’t think they ever really elaborated on it much. I like Matt Dillon’s character, but I don’t think it’s as effective as it could be. In general, I think WP (the TV series) suffers from bad writing. This being a mini-series, you’d think the writers would be a bit more focused, working towards the endgame, making sure that the important aspects stand out, while adding some side-stories to flesh out the community of Wayward Pines. In my opinion, WP is about Pilcher’s idea of a “perfect” society, and the lengths he will go to to create it, versus Ethan’s idea of free will and people deciding for themselves how they want to live their lives.  Pilcher’s character is kind of a success as far as the writing goes. After revealing to Ethan how Wayward Pines came to be, and trying to make him look like the savior of humanity, he’s gradually exposing himself as the psycho he really is, that insecure, failed (in the eyes of his peers) scientist who sees his chance to start anew with people who will show him the respect that he thinks he deserves. All of this works really well not just for the character itself, but within the context of the show.  But one important part is missing, and that is a proper antagonist. Ethan’s character should’ve been it, but he’s all over the place – literally and figuratively. A lot of precious time is wasted on Kate and the resistance, whose only goal is to punch a hole in the fence surrounding Wayward Pines, and Ethan trying to convince them how wrong they are. When you only have 10 episodes to tell your story, surely there are better ways to weave this plot in without losing sight of what really matters?  Other examples are everything Theresa, everything Ben, everything Theresa-Ethan-Kate. I’m convinced that the series would’ve worked much better without adding Ethan’s family to the mix. Theresa’s whole story was setting up the revelation that there is evidence that the world as we know it does, indeed, not exist anymore. She found out about it by discovering an abandoned plot of land that was so obviously suspicious that you don’t have to work as a real estate agent to figure out there’s something wrong with it. Kate, or Ethan, or Kate working with Ethan, could’ve made the same discovery, thereby making Theresa’s character completely obsolete, and the story much more enjoyable. And the same goes for Ben, they didn’t have to use Ben as a plot device to show what was going on inside the school. Just tell the story from Principal Fisher’s point of view. And wouldn’t it have been nice to not have to watch the whole Ben & Amy thing? So much time was wasted overall, it baffles me that anyone would think this could actually work.  Having said that, I want to mention one other aspect that in my opinion contributed to WP not being the success it could’ve been: The decision to use different writers and director for (more or less) every episode. I don’t think that works well for a mini-series, unless the showrunners make sure everyone has the same vision and works towards the same goal. It feels to me that the tone, both overall and as far as specific characters go, changed a lot from episode to episode. And I’m not even counting in the pilot episode, because in hindsight, it seems like M Night was shooting a completely different series than anyone else, although to his defense, it was very effective in setting up this mysterious place. It’s just that this wasn’t the kind of series it turned out to be, the pilot made it look like Twin Peaks when it really was more like Lost (chance vs free will, isolation, time travel are some of the parallels that made me think of Lost pretty much the whole time I was watching WP).  In conclusion, WP is not a complete failure, but it’s deeply flawed, and it leaves me with the impression that I wasn’t watching the best possible version of this story, maybe not even a good version, more like a make-it-up-as-we-go-along-version (and depending on your personal preferences, you might see another parallel to Lost there)."
WaywardPines,3duc32,Rumorian,9,Mon Jul 20 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"From a show watcher, here are a few ways I think this might go down:  The justice boner ending:  It's revealed that Pilcher created the Abbies through his experiments. Many townfolk die during the Abbie attack, most notably hot teacher and Hitler youth boy. Pam helps Ethan, Teresa, and Kate rescue some of their buddies. The volunteers turn on Pilcher. They feed him to the Abbies either in one of those cells inside the mountain or by dropping him out of a helicopter and watching as the Abbies swarm him.  The M. Night Special ending:  Some of the above could still happen, but then it's revealed that Hessler is alive and behind this whole thing. The town has been one big simulation, ala Divergent or the Hunger Games. It was all a test to see who was strong enough to be a leader of the new world. It really is a post apocalyptic future, but maybe not with Abbies. Ethan has passed the test and takes his place alongside Hessler, maybe as Vice President or something. It all ties back in with one of the first shots of the entire series, when a doctor is asking Ethan about his hallucinations, etc. That was in the present, after the simulation is over, and Ethan is still having some PTSD from his experiences in Wayward Pines.  The Scooby Doo ending:  They pull off Pilcher's mask to reveal... That third agent dude that Ethan was looking for and thought was dead. He's alive! And he's behind the whole thing? Yeah, and he would've gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids!"

WaywardPines,3duc32,lewzerkid,6,Sun Jul 19 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"It was actually made two years ago, intended to be screened last year. All the actors options have now expired and they're involved in other things."
WaywardPines,3dtcen,SheWasEighteen,4,Sun Jul 19 06:51:09 2015 UTC,"he makes it seem like Pilcher is this terrible dictator that ruined everything and everyone.   Pilcher is not a good guy. He broke up a lot of families. He ruined a lot of peoples' lives. He basically kidnapped all the townies in WP. All the people working for Pilcher went willingly, but none of the townies had a choice in the matter. All the people that have died because of him would have most likely gone on to live happy, normal lives if they hadn't been taken.  In the books he goes so far as to kill his wife and daughter (which obviously aren't in the show.) His wife doesn't want to go to the future with him, and wants to keep their daughter with her, so he has Pope kill his wife and takes his daughter. Fast forward ~1800 years (book timeline, show is 2000 years) and after some time in WP his daughter decides he doesn't like what Pilcher is doing. She empathizes with the group that removes their microchips. Pilcher and Pam take her into the morgue and tie her to a table. Pilcher just keeps stabbing her over and over until she dies."
WaywardPines,3dtcen,Swtcherrypie,7,Mon Jul 20 02:33:54 2015 UTC,"Theresa getting into Plot 33 or whatever it was because the lady spilled her coffee   The lady did it on purpose. She obviously saw what was going on then spilled her coffee on purpose. Having second thoughts after Pilcher put one of their own to sleep, is the reason why.   Ethan arriving just in time to kill Jesse or whatever his name was and save Kate.    Why not? I actually thought he was going to come early on and save everyone. Cool that they didn't do that.   Then during the reckoning he makes it seem like Pilcher is this terrible dictator that ruined everything and everyone.   That's what Ethan personally feels about him. He even said so when he saw the little girl in suspended animation."
WaywardPines,3dtcen,Plot33,4,Sun Jul 19 07:19:11 2015 UTC,"I really feel like so many people are in such a panic to shit on this show that they're not even taking time to consider what's actually being presented to them. Is it a perfect show? No, but it's not the shitfest that so many of them seem desperate to make it out to be."
WaywardPines,3dtcen,DGer,8,Sun Jul 19 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's confusing. People (some people) don't seem to be actually watching the show. Every episode has raised questions that have then been answered.  It's as if the show is getting hit by some viewers for not telling the audience exactly what is happening, as it happens - or, that they're so keen to not be taken in by the show, to identify plot holes, that they're seeing a different story than the one actually bring presented - or, that they think the central characters should somehow always represent the opinion of the viewer (e.g. ""I think Pilcher is a saviour so Ethan should think that too, otherwise: bad writing"").  I can't believe how many times I've read the ""how does the time travel work?"" question, and posted my timeline. I'm sure it's not the show's fault."
WaywardPines,3dtcen,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"YES. This show is going to be full of twists, surprises, and unanswered questions. That's the point. It would suck if anything that didn't make sense was immediately explained - it's called suspense! I know that answers will come in time, just as new questions will be raised, that's part of the fun."
WaywardPines,3dtcen,BeefsteakChooly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"Suspense, yes, that's the word! Hmm.  I've been feeling lately that audiences have shifted to only allowing one type of suspense - the suspense of ""will the hero win now or later?""  The suspense of mystery, of not-understanding-yet, seems not to be allowed - as if programmes are under an obligation to make the viewer feel clever. The viewer demands a ""God's Eye View"" of the story, even when the POV characters don't have that knowledge!"
WaywardPines,3dtcen,TriumphantGeorge,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:00 2015 UTC,Thank you for writing a good response. You are right on all the points in my opinion
WaywardPines,3dtcen,Darth_Deckard,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:44 2015 UTC,"Pilcher is not a good guy.  And are we sure he saved humanity? Maybe he actually destroyed humanity. We know he kidnapped a bunch of people and froze them, without their consent, to wake them up 2000 year later and not tell them what was going on. We know that many, many of these people have died (all of the first bunch and everyone who has been ""reckoned"" in the second bunch) because he did this. Had he left them in their own time frame they would have lived out normal lives of their own making. We also saw him doing some gene splicing with trees and there is a theory out there that he might have caused the devolution that resulted in the current situation. So, I'm not ready to cut the guy any slack. I think Ethan is trying to make the best of a very bad situation by at least leveling with the people of WP and stopping the mind control, surveillance, reckonings and secrecy. In all of this, I see no bad writing or weak plotting."
WaywardPines,3dw65r,brettrosey,4,Mon Jul 20 01:08:38 2015 UTC,You can consider those flashbacks. We were lead to believe they were happening at the same time to add to the mystery.
WaywardPines,3dw65r,lewzerkid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"Are you sure?  I would have figured the flashbacks he'd have long hair and a slightly more youthful look like in the other flashbacks.   He looks exactly the same as he does in the ""present"" day though when he visits the agent."
WaywardPines,3dw65r,lewzerkid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:11 2015 UTC,So far we've chalked up his unfreezing with long hair as a production mistake unless the final episode proves us otherwise.   They Wayward Pine crew were still awake and kidnapping people after they captured Ethan which would be why Sheriff Pope was still around to catch Theresa and Ben and why Pilcher was still able to talk to the CIA boss. They just weren't frozen yet.
WaywardPines,3dw65r,rbruba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:15:26 2015 UTC,Best explanation seems to be that it was a production error.  Edit: I'd love for those that are downvoting me to come up with an explanation that makes sense other than a production error.
WaywardPines,3dw65r,stinkylittleone,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:46 2015 UTC,Disappointing.
WaywardPines,3dw65r,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:30 2015 UTC,"Someone else suggested (amusingly) that it might be because the early flashbacks aren't from anyone's POV, but the later ones are all from a character's POV.  So the flashbacks with the long hair are Pilcher remembering... and remembering himself looking young and dashing with long hair. In reality, we was always middle-aged-looking and balding..."
WaywardPines,3dw65r,ciambella,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:43:12 2015 UTC,"Man, that's some kind of massive mistake if that's really the case."
WaywardPines,3dw65r,KimJongsLicenseToIll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:54:15 2015 UTC,His longer hair was when he was first creating his suspended animation pods and when he wrote his book. Flashbacks but of different years.
WaywardPines,3dw65r,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:59:29 2015 UTC,"No I don't think so, because when it showed the flashback to the destruction of group A, he had long hair still."
WaywardPines,3dw65r,Swtcherrypie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and when they woke up from the pods, he had long hair there too."
WaywardPines,3dw65r,Swtcherrypie,4,Mon Jul 20 09:04:35 2015 UTC,"Here's a timeline I did for another reply. The Pilcher hair is a production error I think. Either they hadn't made the ""past=long hair"" decision yet when they did the pilot episode, or they realised there was no way to have Pilcher with long hair in that scene without giving the game away (making it obvious that the flashbacks weren't contemporaneous with the town scenes) and chose to hide it with the umbrella shadows, hoping that nobody would really notice and think about it later.  Wayward Pines Timeline  The show is set in 4028 entirely. All the ""present day, 2014"" stuff is flashback. The true sequence of events is (some years approximate):  1990-2020: Pilcher, Pam, Pope have been setting up a project since the 1990s to gather people, hibernate them, wake them up after all the bad stuff has passed.  2014: Kate and the other guy go missing in Wayward Pines.  2014: Ethan goes to investigate and gets involved in an (arranged) car crash at Wayward Pines, is hibernated.  2014: Pilcher meets Adam Hassler and says it's already been done. (NOTE: A production error means Pilcher's hair is ""older, balder"" in this scene, which is confusing.)  2014: Theresa and Ben go looking for Ethan. Sheriff Pope arranges for a crash. They get hibernated.  2020: Pilcher, Pam, Pope, the whole team go into hibernation.  4014: Pilcher, Pam, Pope and the team get woken up. Start to fix up Wayward Pines, build the fence, etc. Group A gets woken up, it goes wrong. Group B gets woken.  4016: Kate gets woken.  4028: Ethan gets woken  4028: Events of the TV show begin. There are occasional flashbacks showing 2014."

WaywardPines,3dqt9q,___ayylmao___,7,Sat Jul 18 19:08:59 2015 UTC,I get the feeling there is more to the story with Group A. Maybe they got crazy and killed each other and themselves not because of the truth but because Pilcher tried to control them all. It seems plausible since he shut off the power and everything! Haven't read the books but now I want to!
WaywardPines,3dqt9q,dfp430,2,Sat Jul 18 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"Do it. I read all 3 in less than 2 weeks. They're excellent, but there are some huge differences in the books vs the show.

If the author had his way and the show continued in the same universe, but with a different cast, I guess they could just make it a new show?  Calling them all ""Wayward Pines"" would be strange if it's only relevant to the first season  EDIT: Maybe it could be called something like ""Wayward Pines: Over the Fence"" or something to the same extent"
WaywardPines,3dmy5u,AstroTheStickman,3,Fri Jul 17 16:17:23 2015 UTC,Could you tell me what the entire book series is about? Does the first season only cover one book or all of them?
WaywardPines,3dmy5u,dragonslayer_perseus,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the books but the author has been open to the idea of a second season.

WaywardPines,3dmy5u,AstroTheStickman,3,Fri Jul 17 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"Good point.  There hasn't been any press release from Fox, or anyone directly involved with the show, regarding cancellation.

WaywardPines,3dmy5u,Dinosauringg,5,Sat Jul 18 01:24:32 2015 UTC,Well yes and no. They flipped back and forth between universes but the title sequence was red or blue depending on who was the focus of the episode
WaywardPines,3dmy5u,sillygirlsarah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't mean universes... The storyline each season was different from the last, including the season they were in an alternate future (iirc) and the final season with the observers"
WaywardPines,3dmy5u,Dinosauringg,2,Sat Jul 18 01:39:30 2015 UTC,"Well yes, the storyline changed, but the nature of the show was that there were to universes colliding and only one could survive but then both of them managed to survive and have the bridge. I still don't quite know what the deal was with the last season. I'm binging it again so I'll pay better attention. But the cast was roughly the same, hence they didn't do what horror story does.   Horror story does what they do so they can get out of the ""drama"" category at the emmies and gold globes and can dominate in a category that's usually FOR mini-series/limited run etc etc. Which I still rock my head and say bull shit. But it's their loophole - replace almost all the cast but Jessica Lange - to avoid competing against Game of thrones and other shows that would otherwise bury them."
WaywardPines,3dmy5u,sillygirlsarah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:18:15 2015 UTC,That's true. They do have most of the same cast from season to season though on AHS.

So, I really don't understand how the hell they qualify as a mini-series limited run. You have multiple seasons, you just switched up your cast and they have how many episodes? I really think it was a matter of finding a loophole to get out of competition with shows that eclipse them come award time.   Downton Abbey no longer seems to be in the miniseries section either yes?"

In the show they are weirdly trying to make her role be part pam/part pilcher's daughter which just isn't working IMO. P's daughter in the books was empathetic and loving and the opposite of everything Pam was written to be.  Matt Dillon and Toby were both 100% A+ casting.  Not sure why they went with Shannyn Sossamon when books: Theresa was written to be suburban blonde white mom  Carla has done a great job in her role. I do not like the way her plot has played out though. Books: She knew about the abbies but hosted a speakeasy with friends to talk about their past and have a good escape from the oppressive world they now lived in and had to deal with. She was never a terrorist in the books just disobeyed their rules in a very minor way to drink bathtub gin and have a good time now and then. The show makes her seem like a reckless/ignorant fool where in the books she wasn't portrayed that way."
WaywardPines,3do95j,bockstradamus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"Show Pam is lovable, though not right away. Book Pam is a psychotic bitch.  The books were amazing. I recommend everyone read them. They're really quick reads. I read all three in less than 2 weeks."
WaywardPines,3do95j,Swtcherrypie,2,Mon Jul 20 02:46:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I read the last two books in three days. Super fun reads!
WaywardPines,3do95j,bockstradamus,7,Mon Jul 20 02:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think Ethan's wife is drop dead gorgeous. I don't really notice her acting, just her sharp jaw line and black hair."
WaywardPines,3do95j,hypertown,2,Sat Jul 18 03:56:40 2015 UTC,I was mistaking her for Terri Hatcher for quite a while :)
WaywardPines,3do95j,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Jul 18 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"I really rate Toby Jones - his performances in Berberian Sound Studio and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy are amazing. He really manages to remain a consistent character, while also show the extreme sides to Jenkins/Pilcher. Another actor would have played them as, essentially, almost different people, making it overblown and cartoonish.  Agreed on Melissa Leo.   Everyone else is ""transparent"" - which means they are good at their lesser roles, being believable and not jarring. e.g. In the wrong hands, the Theresa Burke character could have come over as wimpy and annoying as written, but Shannyn Sossamon handles it very well."
WaywardPines,3do95j,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Jul 18 10:45:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm certainly not dissing any of the actors. And supporting players always add up to the whole, but some parts would just be ridiculous if the actor/actress went full thespian.     EDIT: Toby Jones ... I hope his character does not go full Hitler in the last episode, I really like how nuanced he is so far! I saw Berberian Sound Studio and he was great in it ... but the film overall was a bit self-indulgent, eh?"
WaywardPines,3do95j,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Jul 18 13:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do hope they keep that character in, um, character - paranoid, passive-aggressive, control freak is fine, pressing the ""burn"" button like (we suspect) he did with Group A - but not cartoon him.  BSS - Great performances all round. I really enjoyed it for that and the cinematography and the dreamlike aspects... but, yeah, the eventual Lynchian twisting was not fully earned I think."
WaywardPines,3do95j,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Jul 18 13:52:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He's a flawed man, but he's not Sinestro. I really don't need a lame plot twist where he orchestrated the abbies in some kind of power fantasy."
WaywardPines,3do95j,alexbu92,2,Sat Jul 18 13:56:50 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they won't, recalling the ""they don't see"" dialogue in the flashback scenes with him promoting his book and so on. He was portrayed as a sincere man but troubled, and perhaps struggling with the burden.  They underplayed Pope and they've been pretty good at having Pam be a fully developed character.   If there's a confrontation, it'll be of the ""tortured perfectionist doing what is best despite people who don't understand"" rather than actual power for its own sake nonsense, I reckon (no ""reckoning"")."
WaywardPines,3do95j,neu318,2,Sat Jul 18 14:02:17 2015 UTC,"However, those were his flashbacks, I guess they could be influenced by his perspective ..."
WaywardPines,3dmou9,OhanianIsACreep,13,Fri Jul 17 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. Best explanation I can gather is that a trick or something to try and help convince Ethen that he's losing it and having another one of his hallucinations, hence why the second time he went he was knocked out and sent back to the hospital for his ""operation"". I think later on some character explained to ethen that ""they"" try and break your mind to convince you the town was real, or something on those lines.  Of course it kind of leaves a gaping hole that had they succeeded in breaking ethen he would have eventually gone back to the bar where she would probably be working...."
WaywardPines,3dmou9,mallabywallaby,9,Fri Jul 17 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"I remember it as they're messing with his head, trying to make him think he's crazy so he'll agree to ""the operation"" (do we even know what that was supposed to do?). I think Ethan gets knocked out when confronting the bar owner, who talks to someone else on a phone or radio and says ""He's not buying it."""
WaywardPines,3dmou9,whytefox,3,Fri Jul 17 15:31:09 2015 UTC,"I think it was meant to be them gaslighting him on his grip on reality, making it more likely he would accept their deceptions as the truth."

I honestly believe WP would be better suited if we had 2-3 more episodes instead of just the one, or maybe an extended finale- it really just seems like a lot to cram into ~45 minutes."
WaywardPines,3dlyg2,jackshepardlives,2,Fri Jul 17 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"Judging by the preview, it does look like it may be the best one yet, at least in terms of action.  I'm in the opposite thinking, though, when it comes to extending the series finale.  The writers have already been provided with more than enough episodes to expound on the various characters, the Abbies, and the plot points.  If you were to give them more time, I'm afraid they'd just add more elements to the story that would still remain unexplained by series end.  As it is, if this last ep is filled with action and excitement, with a smaller amount of dialogue, I'll be left satisfied.  Bonus points if the Ben, Amy and the rest of the ""next generation"" get abbied :)"

WaywardPines,3dlyg2,logangrey123,2,Fri Jul 17 22:35:04 2015 UTC,Predictions: the whole town goes to shit then Pilcher starts Group C. I mean is there any other way it can happen?

WaywardPines,3dkp59,QueenOfPurple,3,Fri Jul 17 09:57:05 2015 UTC,She's just awful. I can't stand her either.
WaywardPines,3dkp59,jed27,3,Fri Jul 17 21:06:14 2015 UTC,She reminds me of Mrs. Carmody from The Mist.

I hate people who cry the whole 'well if you don't like it don't watch fuck off err!'. I am adult who has the capacity to continue to watch something, even if I'm not invested as I once was or enjoying it as much as I used to, I'm still contributing to the discussion and want to know what happens to the characters.

WaywardPines,3dkp59,dragonslayer_perseus,2,Fri Jul 17 03:54:52 2015 UTC,I mean seeing people being ripped apart by abbies you would think  people would take the easy way out
WaywardPines,3dkp59,chennel,3,Fri Jul 17 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"Pilcher explictly said that the first group were told exactly what is going on. Plus Pilcher does have a lot of followers in the group of volunteers who know the truth. The kids also know the truth. Pilcher doesnt seem to have problem sharing the truth with people he thinks can handle it. I know it is a show, but it makes no sense to keep part of the people in the dark for no reason. And all the volunteers must also be able to make sense of it, I doubt they would sit and watch how the population gets killed on purpose."
WaywardPines,3dkp59,lewzerkid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:38:51 2015 UTC,"I think the volunteers (while the name seems to make it obvious) chose to leave their old lives behind and be frozen, knowing the rough scenario they'd be in when they woke up.

WaywardPines,3dkp59,mehimagoat,7,Fri Jul 17 15:32:55 2015 UTC,It wasn't necessarily up a flashback. Just a visualization of the story Pilcher was telling.

For example, the plot of the wife going down there without being detected by Pilcher is a huge plot-hole. I mean, at the beginning of the show it seemed that you couldn't fart without Pilcher knowing . Now the woman smashes a camera where the biggest secret of the town is hidden and Pilcher doesn't notice it. It doesn't make any sense.  Nontheless is still a very entrataining show, but kinda disappointed on the  writing of the show, cause the first 4-5 episodes were really good."

WaywardPines,3dkp59,Sanlear,6,Fri Jul 17 03:07:21 2015 UTC,I feel like been treated like an idiot while watching the flashback.
WaywardPines,3dkp59,Jsmith0730,2,Fri Jul 17 12:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, that flashback was awful, there was no need at all for it. It was a real case of ""doing it for the audience"". He lied to Pilcher and got him onside, got access to the town, didn't do what he said, hardly a grand plan we can't understand. Pilcher's expression (betrayal!) was all that was required."

WaywardPines,3dkp59,TriumphantGeorge,10,Fri Jul 17 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"I was pretty disappointed that Plot 33 wasn't Pilcher's little experiment room. My first reaction was ""So it's a vault from Fallout? What?"""
WaywardPines,3dkp59,Blacramento,10,Fri Jul 17 01:54:15 2015 UTC,Awful reveal.  Why is there an underground bunker with one computer full of damming information right at the center of town?  If there isn't more to this like it's a deeper experiment testing people or something than there's a lot of silly stuff that's happened for the sake of keeping the plot mysterious.
WaywardPines,3dkp59,mehimagoat,2,Fri Jul 17 03:07:53 2015 UTC,I think the idea is that it's their initial control room / base for the town as they set it up (hence 4020 dating of Adam Hassler's report).
WaywardPines,3dkp59,pacotaco724,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"Right...but why after all this time is it left there? Every other morsel of information is kept in the main base, why is there one computer with this damming evidence in the center of town."

I mean, I could certainly explain it away (maintaining a control centre in town is a good idea; casual neglect is standard human behaviour; it has restricted access to there's no need to worry about, you wouldn't even think; the info is auto-transmitted to that place so they kept it, etc), but...  They would have done well to have at least one line which integrates that place a bit more.   Having said that, there's been no opportunity for that to happen: Pam gave her the card, then she and others go see the computer. There's been no chance for anyone to say ""we kept that bunker because..."""
WaywardPines,3dkp59,rumham1701,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"The scene could have been written as ""Pam takes Theresa to the bunker and explains why its there"". It would as a plus have served to show that Pam has turned some of the surveillance team against Pilcher. OR Theresa could have a throwaway line about how maybe they left it there so that if something ever happened to the staff in the mountain, people would have a record of how Wayward Pines came to be.. I mean there are lots of ways you could write that scene and have it make better scene. I really feel like the people that make that show have a very low opinion of their audience."
WaywardPines,3dkp59,NicKaTimE,2,Sat Jul 18 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm... To be honest, I think ""Pam takes her and explains"" is more of a dumbing down. Theresa doesn't yet know so can't have a throwaway line yet.  I think the show makers actually have a reasonably high expectation of the audience here. There are holes, but they're not of the underestimating-the-audience type. There's nothing I hate worse than scripts which constantly make it clear what is happening - giving the audience a God's Eye View - when the characters themselves don't know yet, or that show characters doing every little thing. ""Lack of exposition does not equal plot hole"" and all that.  If I was writing it, I'd be okay with it as it is right now (Pam tips Theresa off, trusts her to do the right thing, Pam keeps on Pilcher's good side, all characters are acting consistently within their personal situation), but I'd incorporate a line into the next episode. Even just the phrase ""original town communications coordination centre"" or ""the emergency bunker"" would help.  Suppose we have to remember that we're effectively picking holes in a ""movie"" that's 2 hours long and has still got 20 minutes to run.  So far the show has been pretty good at answering its questions - guess we'll see next week!"

WaywardPines,3dkp59,TheBigCon4800,9,Fri Jul 17 01:41:06 2015 UTC,I am confused who was the guy at the bay bridge?
WaywardPines,3dkp59,lewzerkid,16,Fri Jul 17 01:41:55 2015 UTC,Adam Hessler. The FBI agent who supervised Ethan and Kate.
WaywardPines,3dkp59,missamelia22,2,Fri Jul 17 02:47:36 2015 UTC,Was he taken unwilling or something? It seems like he should've known that the cities were destroyed if he knew what year it was.
WaywardPines,3dkp59,bicoolano,10,Fri Jul 17 01:49:00 2015 UTC,"I think he was on board with the whole plan.  When they went to cryo-sleep, Pilcher & Co. really had no idea what was in store for them in this future world.  Perhaps some pockets of human society were able to survive here and there.  After seeing what surrounded WP, Pilcher probably sent out explorers to scour the countryside  in search of whatever may be left of humanity."
WaywardPines,3dkp59,Goyims,2,Fri Jul 17 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"He was checking if they, by some virtue, survived."

If you were a local, you would know from its current problems that the Bay Bridge might not even survive a hundred years, never mind partially standing two millenia from now :)  Actually, no steel structure, especially one sitting in salt water, would last that many years."

WaywardPines,3dkp59,Sanlear,3,Fri Jul 17 15:56:21 2015 UTC,"Not really, this entire season is based off the trilogy of books which were already written. Author has no plans to continue the book series (though he's been wishy washy on a second season of the show).   The first 5 episodes were pretty much book 1, the next 4 episodes were pretty much book 2 and looks like they are cramming book 3 into episode 10.  If they continue the story, I really don't see where it would go. One idea that wasn't in the books was the possibility of other Wayward Pines, so perhaps they'd pick up the story in a new town.

So since they're 2000 years in the future, the environment is different and they may still evolve but differently.   Also I'm pretty sure Pilcher had something to do with genetically modifying the Abbies. I'm not sure how much of it was actually due to evolution. But that's just speculation."
WaywardPines,3dm2rs,Accio_Nimbus,2,Fri Jul 17 11:17:58 2015 UTC,Yep the fact evolution takes millions of years is completed left out of the story.
WaywardPines,3dm2rs,jimmyolsenblues,5,Fri Jul 17 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"We don't know if Pilcher had any involvement with the creation of the abbies, kind of like a guy who warns about forest fires but then turns out to be an arsonist."
WaywardPines,3dm2rs,JessumB,3,Fri Jul 17 16:03:41 2015 UTC,I got a very strong feeling pilcher gave it all away with the tree discussion about cross breeding.
WaywardPines,3dm2rs,jimmyolsenblues,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:09:10 2015 UTC,That's a really good point. The whole town and the gate would have deteriorated by the environment before everyone was waked up
WaywardPines,3dkr87,cdtoad,5,Fri Jul 17 01:47:08 2015 UTC,"Every time I see them, it feels like I'm watching an episode of the Strain."
WaywardPines,3dklq3,jimmyolsenblues,3,Fri Jul 17 00:58:07 2015 UTC,"It's because it was made on the cheap and FOX wasn't willing to put something like ""Masterchef"" on before ""Pines."" Of current FOX shows, ""Bones"" would be a better lead-in. Otherwise, ""Fringe"" would have been a perfect pairing for this show."
WaywardPines,3dklq3,emememaker73,5,Fri Jul 17 01:28:21 2015 UTC,Except Fringe was masterful and this show is playing out like even the writers are just putting a hodgepodge of ideas on paper.
WaywardPines,3dklq3,gr8ver,5,Fri Jul 17 14:17:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah the amount of massive plot holes, and convenient events is getting funny now."
WaywardPines,3dklq3,Merkarov,3,Fri Jul 17 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"At least Fringe could explain away things like that by being like ""OOPS FRINGE EVENTS""  That said, I'm enjoying the hell out of Wayward Pines, but as a wrestling fan I've become conditioned to mostly ignore things that straight don't make sense."
WaywardPines,3dklq3,Dinosauringg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"Hahah yeah I'm quite enjoying it too, but the in the last two episodes I'm finding it harder to suspend my disbelief."
WaywardPines,3dklq3,Merkarov,2,Sat Jul 18 13:33:03 2015 UTC,"It's so terrible. I usually value my time better than to watch this, but my wife and I have promised to see this train wreck through."
WaywardPines,3dklq3,DrSphincter,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:41 2015 UTC,It started off really promising but quickly has become directionless.
WaywardPines,3dklq3,gr8ver,2,Sat Jul 18 10:16:53 2015 UTC,Think of it as one of the things better left behind as there are no game shows in Wayward Pines.
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,Accio_Nimbus,13,Fri Jul 17 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"What I understood was:   Adam Hessler was the secret service friend at the beginning that was investigating Ethans dissapearance, and that we saw talking to pilchner. I assume he was one of the first people woken, Before Wayward Pines was built. His  job was to scout and discover what had happened to the world in 2000 years. The other groups were more scouting groups sent to explore more places. They found that everything was destroyed and that there were no survivors, only abbies. Thus, Wayward Pines was built as the last bastion of humanity."
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,GeneralLemon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"I got the same thing out of it.   He  and the rest were advance teams to explore the world, I'm guessing not a single one of them came back."
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,JessumB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:36:17 2015 UTC,"My understanding as well. Hesser was Burke's Secret Service supervisor who aided Piltcher in kidnapping Ethan and his family, albiet with reservations/guilt over it (show in the scene where he wishes to halt the process but Piltcher argues its too late).   And if you can imagine, despite Piltcher's organisation and preparation they still would have been awoken from cryo in a new, savage world with no civilisation. So he sent out parties in all directions to old world cities to check for survivors and remnants of humanity. Although one of his comments 'I'm going to try to make it to the other side to meet up with the others's' implies that there was either a surviving group or a Piltcher group in San Fran, which opens up future possibilities for the show for other groups outside Wayward Pines."
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,KaladinStormborn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:45:49 2015 UTC,"Thus, Wayward Pines was built as the last bastion of humanity.   I'm pretty sure they built Wayward Pines in the past, but it had gotten way overgrown in the 2000 years since. The volunteers had to clear it for a few years to make it livable.  Is there ever an explanation, in the books even, as to why there are no crickets? Did the Abbies eat them to extinction?"
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,NinjaKoala,5,Sun Jul 19 22:02:15 2015 UTC,Related question: Why was Adam's corpse tied up to the bed in the abandoned house at the beginning of the season?
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,cylonathena,7,Fri Jul 17 07:58:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure why corpse was tied up but that wasn't Adam, it was Bill Evans, another agent."
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,mcdonc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:00:25 2015 UTC,IMO the bed murder of Bill just had more to do with Sheriff Poe's tactics of fear to keep the residents in line.
WaywardPines,3dkx4r,Darth_Deckard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:00:55 2015 UTC,"His wife said he had ""killed himself"". I figured that meant he was reckoned like Beverly, not murdered in the bed.  Beverly was also found in the same room hung up, but had been killed elsewhere. But I guess that's plausible that they put the bodies in that house as a fear tactic?"
