BoomBeach,3e4adq,KillerKrew,0,Tue Jul 21 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"Seems like most of the leaderboard uses smokey hooka, or, as you mentioned, smokey warrior. No real way other than using smoke. Tanks have been rendered obsolete at the end game by protos and the Ice Age."
BoomBeach,3e4adq,LBrown96,0,Tue Jul 21 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"All of the popular YouTube folks have maxed or nearly maxed accounts, so yeah, there are quite a few videos available. Any defense can be successfully raided, often with quite a bit of room for error, so the question comes down to how long it will take to reinforce.  Offense is superior to an equivalent defense at every level. Maxed players generally have 75-150 GBE depending on statue situation and maxed arty does over 5k damage, just as an example of maxed offensive power.  Also keep in mind that you can have at most 2 blue MPs and prototypes.  Edit: yes, maxed smoky warriors can raid nearly any player base and yeah, it's a boring strategy. There's not really a good way to make it more interesting without seriously messing up warrior balance at low levels. Shock bombs actually used to increase in cost at half the current rate (up until about a year ago) so you can imagine how OP warriors used to be. Sometimes you'll see smoky zooka attacks at high levels but they're more common for task force OPs. Hooka stays relevant for some player bases throughout the game, as does TMed and later Scanks."
BoomBeach,3e4adq,smuttyinkspot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:02 2015 UTC,If warriors are the dominant offense play style then why do all the globally top ranked players have hooka loaded? You have to go down to number 10 to find anyone loading warriors.
BoomBeach,3e4adq,mwilkens,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"Primary reason: maxed players don't need resources for upgrades and so army retraining time is no longer the deciding factor in what composition they use.  Hooka at max level is more accurately described as ""smoky hooka"" and it's more of a less error-prone variant of smoky zooka than a traditional hooka strategy. It's very versatile and performs adequately against PvP, PvE, and OP bases.   When you don't need back to back resource raids, you're not inconvenienced by how long it takes to refill a maxed LC with zookas. At the same time, casualties are inevitable against maxed bases; you're going to need to reinforce while pushing the leaderboards, so you may as well reinforce with a versatile, heavy-hitter when time is not of the essence. Smoky warriors reinforce much faster so they're great for rapid PvP raids (especially against very icy bases where TMed can't steamroll), but they tend to be less useful for OP/Blackguard bases."
BoomBeach,3e549k,Meagleson,2,Wed Jul 22 00:57:40 2015 UTC,It works very well against tanks and warriors. And most the time grenaders. 9 out of 10 times I succeed.

I'll assume you are at the point in the game where wood is the resource your short on, so keeping that wood MP will be useful for levels to come! I suggest you switch the wood MP either when you no longer have a wood shortage or when you replaced both low % Gbe's and need room for a red or purple MP. Best of luck!"

BoomBeach,3e2852,greennick,2,Tue Jul 21 23:15:39 2015 UTC,44 as well...I'm rocking a 58% iron MP...so I might be a little insulated.
BoomBeach,3e2852,Smellivision,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"Last week I lumped out 1.8m iron for sculptor 7, immediately after completing HQ 18. That 1 day of iron production with 58% extra would have been an additional 90k in iron. I can get that raiding just one NPC base on my map with my boosted RR MP.  If you think a green MP is helping you, you're not very attacking. Much better off having a GBE or RR guardian."

I make 150k iron in day from my mine and resource bases (the resource I'm always short). I need 1.5m plus for an upgrade. That MP would give me 60k iron a day.  Or, I could raid Dr T and 7-10 bases and get 1m iron, with that RR guardian giving me 150k extra iron, plus bonus gold, wood and stone too. Extra resources are always good to have as they make you a target to help drop VP once you log off."

From what I understand, it happens when you train your troops, but the message doesn't get to the server due to a bad connection, and therefore when you exit and reload your troops won't have trained, and the only good thing is you won't have lost the gold either.

BoomBeach,3e3qrz,BroccoliManChild,5,Tue Jul 21 19:04:16 2015 UTC,I second this strategy.  As far as gold cost for troop upgrades it's always artillery < heavies < zookas < barrage.  If I can do barrage first then great.
BoomBeach,3e29zs,LiamAwesomeDude,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:56 2015 UTC,"I use Hooka and I find the boom cannons to be a much greater threat than rockets. The rockets tend to target the heavies and have poor DPS, so my Zookas are usually fine. I'd artillery the boom cannon and flamethrower, and then try to take out the other boom cannon. Be sure not to let your heavies attack the rockets, if you do they'll be in the blind spot and the rocket launcher will attack the zookas instead."

Don't fret over not conquering all resource bases on the map.  I'm level 35 and of the 14 resource bases on my map, there are 8 i own.  There are 3 that i rent.  Some times at an hourly occupancy.  Then the rest are owned by THE MAN.  I tend to wait for THE MAN to move on."
BoomBeach,3e0r9s,amhemel,17,Tue Jul 21 01:55:01 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what the other 2 posters are talking about. What this guy has done is completely ignored his his defenses and focused solely on offense. He's lvl 35 with lvl 15/16 landing crafts, if you look at his armory and gunboat they would be high level as well.  Playing this way means he can demolish people similar levels to him with his huge offensive advantage. In one play session, he can boost his statues, wipe up to levels 45 off his  map, get huge loot and start big upgrades, and then jump off."
BoomBeach,3e0r9s,Subzero221,7,Tue Jul 21 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"Thats what I figured. I guess I was just surprised that he hadnt even placed other defenses. So i guess as long as he has a huge offensive advantage, he can go up 2 VP at a time and drop down 1 VP at a time. Its just interesting to see all the variety in how you can play this."
BoomBeach,3e0r9s,greennick,5,Tue Jul 21 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"Also, his HQ is pretty much beached all the time with that set-up.  As people will sometimes scout him when he's holding resources, he'll still be a target, he won't need to hold many resources for some people to attack him as they know they won't lose any troops.  This helps with the dropping of VP.  So many people on here still don't get this game.  It is no problem being raided as long as you manage your resources.  In fact, it is often good.  You drop VP and can get intel/diamonds if you have just a rudimentary defence.    Just as I type this I log in and see that I've been raided, picked up 2 intel and 4 diamonds.  That's just in the past 2 hours from 1 raid.  The only resources I lost are resources I got from raiding NPC, which are VP neutral.  Over the past 24 hours I've been raided 4 times for 4 intel (got no intel once)."
BoomBeach,3e0r9s,Whitelighttwo,3,Tue Jul 21 07:04:23 2015 UTC,"Good point, I keep seeing tons of questions on this sub about ""Help, I keep getting raided!""    My response, ""Good!""  As long as you're spending your resources before you log off, getting raided is a good thing."
BoomBeach,3e0r9s,Whitelighttwo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:02:38 2015 UTC,"Its this interesting balance of having a good base, while having a base that attracts attacks. I used to stress over my base being too weak, but seeing this style, i nearly regret some of my upgrades :) Thanks for helping me to understand this!"
BoomBeach,3e0r9s,KamahlFoK,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"Glad this has helped.  In a nutshell, there are three strategies to base design:   Have a well defended, powerful base.  This is almost impossible to do, unless you do it at the expense of not properly upgrading your offense.  Since playing this game offensively gains resources MUCH more efficiently than defensively gaining them (waiting for your sawmill, quarry, etc), this strategy will result much slower progression through the game.  Some people don't mind that slow pace, but most people on the sub prefer the offensive and faster approach. Have a mediocre base.  This is actually kinda hard, but it's probably what most people try to do.  You want people to be able to attack you and beat you, but you want to kill as much of their forces as possible while they attack you.  This strategy gains you diamonds and intel and also lowers your VP.  The trick with this strategy is that if your base is too strong, people won't attack you and you won't get the diamonds, intel and lower VP.  In addition, if your base is too strong, you have probably been ineffective with spending your resources (see bullet #1, above).  However, if your base is too weak, then you will get steamrolled without collecting diamonds and intel.  So, in that case, you don't get the diamond and intel and you also lose resources.  But the real kicker is that you also don't lose much VP (at least not as much as Bullet #3, below).  Why? Because your base looks kinda hard, so not as many people will attack you as they would if you had a base like Bullet #3 below.  So, getting the right balance of being easy and enticing for attackers while also ensuring you can kill some of their troops takes some careful thought. Beach your base.  This means putting your HQ right on the beach with no defenses around.  If you haven't come across one of these yet, they're fairly rare.  The idea is that anyone can easily beat you without losing any troops.  Some people will pass on that, but a lot will take the bait.  You get no diamonds or intel from this, but it's the fastest way to drop VP (although it's still pretty slow to be honest)."

Meanwhile I have level 9 warriors, 15 capacity gunboats, 13 artillery, 5 Sculptor, and a level 13 Gunboat.

BoomBeach,3dz8xm,SiimL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"I've heard there is a cap on resources. The highest I've ever seen unboosted is about 400k gold. And although this is the most I've ever lost, I definitely have lost 8-900k a few times. On the plus side, I think there's a lower bound too as I often lose zero iron or gold but never see below 20k iron or 60k gold anymore."

BoomBeach,3dy47h,negtive82,3,Mon Jul 20 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"The only problem is this: it wouldn't really tell you how much of your resources are protected, quantitatively. If your vault protects 75 percent, a differently colored line (or whatever) would really just show you how big the line would be after you were raided.   I realize this is an awkward explanation, so try this: the different colors wouldn't be able to display actual numbers without looking clunky; you'd have to guess the value that it represents.

Fire a flare back to the left/middle of the beach, retreat awhile, then your troops should swing back and attack the machine guns on the right.

Drop a heavies at the blue 1,2, and 3, and zookas at the red 4, 5.  follow the black path using flares so your units walk around all of the front defense.   kill the second sniper, and then flare so your units get close to the motor.   after your units kill the motor they'll go down to take out the HQ, and should be out of the range of the cannon. worse case scenario it'll only be able to hit your heavies, and your zookas will kill the base."
BoomBeach,3dzgp9,likrem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:41 2015 UTC,"Some new person advice which doesn't address the question exactly but making sure you know.... first, if its tough just wait till it gets the yellow exclamation and find (""change"") new opponents. Good chance it may be easier with new person.   Also, do not get to wrapped up trying to capture resource bases. They start to become pretty pointless once you get in to your mid twenties to mid 30's as BG and player bases give much better rewards. In other words resource bases don't scale. And they raise VP which you don't want.   Lastly if there is ever question of spending gold on attacking a resource base or spending for an armory upgrade, always pick the armory upgrade. You shouldn't delay your attack upgrades, they are what really keep you in resources. Also, spending the gold on more map unlock is much better than using it to get resource bases. Good luck!"
BoomBeach,3dzgp9,pastarific,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"if its tough just wait till it gets the yellow exclamation and find (""change"") new opponents   Protip: rerolling resource bases opponents becomes a pretty bad idea later on.  If you're trading back and forth with someone roughly on your level (judging by the troops/levels used,) its usually better to just sit tight and try again in a week or three if you start having difficulty.  You the higher you get, the more likely you'll roll the resource base of a much-higher-than-you ""passive"" player.  You can be 40 and roll a ""60"" base under the effect of multiple permanent blue statues.  (60 in quotes as thats the highest the map ""level"" will go, even though more defenses will be added and defense levels raised on each successful attack.)"

BoomBeach,3dyrsd,Grazzert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"I understand the basics for dropping vp.   Beach the HQ, clear NPC bases since they're mostly vp neutral so that my resources are high enough people actually want to attack me. When I actually do clear my map, don't log off until you're done and you spend everything.  My only problem is that I can't afford to do that since I'm sitting at a medium range of resources such as stone and iron where if I get raided, I'll lose enough to really set my upgrade plans back. The only reason I want to drop vp is so I can find lower level bases that are easier to raid because I admit, my offence is under leveled for my HQ level (HQ 17, but only just got armory level 14 I think?) So its harder for me to gather to resources to upgrade my armory to bring my offence to a more respectable level for my HQ.   Thanks for helping, I appreciate it :)"

My actual base has hilariously low level defenses (Booms 1, RL's 1, Snipers 8, FT's 1, Mortars 5, MG's 6, cannons 3, and I'm at 256 VP) and I only aim to get intel when I'm raided, which happens 85% of the time."

BoomBeach,3ds4hv,Kyleclaarrk20,2,Tue Jul 21 12:18:26 2015 UTC,"I run Tmed (lvl 44, tanks lvl 9, meds level 4).  The first thing I look at is: does he have prototype weapons from the weapons lab.  If yes, 90% of the time, I'll pass (doesn't really matter what weapon you have, all are OP).  So, get the weapons lab.  Save up tons of easy bases, boost your statues and use some diamonds if you have to, but get that weapons lab.  The second thing I look at is:  how many of his boom cannons and regular cannons can I avoid (not have to engage in order to take out the HQ).  In your case, I can avoid three regular cannons and possibly one boom cannon by attacking from only one side and ignoring defenses on the other side.  Your base would be extremely easy for me to attack, but in all fairness, I'm clearly a higher level than you and I have around 390VP, versus your 280.  So, as you asked, if you want to stop more Tmed, get the weapons lab and move your cannons and boom cannons more centralized so they can't be ignored by someone attacking from one side or the other.  On the other hand, there's something to be said of the recommended strategy of NOT trying to stop attacks.  Doing so will allow you to keep your VP lower, which has benefits.  Cheers!"

BoomBeach,3dqxjk,Inventi,3,Sat Jul 18 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Smokey warriors is the best way, if you're warriors aren't the best I'd go rooka to the left, gbe the rockets to death, shock the machine gun and mortar, then shock the flamethrowers and machine guns.  That's not too bad a resource base, I'm exp 47 now and I don't really get new ones below 55-60."
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,etown361,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:31 2015 UTC,I'd barrage the two rocket launchers and just drop your heavies in a line everything else next and shock what hurts your team comp
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,bigbrad1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"EASY DUDE, use smokey warrior. im lvl47 able to take down lvl60 resource base"
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,DKPrince,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:27 2015 UTC,I'll be sure to upgrade my Warriors next! :)
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,monolese,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"If you don't have your warriors upgraded, you can still use hookas after destroying two rocket launchers"
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,lyyki,0,Mon Jul 20 19:13:17 2015 UTC,Grenadiers maybe if they can outrange sentry guns.
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,ktappe,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:48:11 2015 UTC,Don't? I'm level 33 and can't beat anything higher than level 25 or so. I thought that's how the game was designed.
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,IMASTRBATETOANYTHING,7,Sat Jul 18 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"Nah man, upgrade your offense."
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,cameronbrady,3,Sat Jul 18 20:57:02 2015 UTC,there's something wrong with your troop levels then. at level 33 you should have level 10+ heavies and level 10+ zookas if you use that strat.
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,Kyleclaarrk20,2,Sat Jul 18 21:04:55 2015 UTC,Yo I'm level 34 and I beat a level 40 today... Get level 12 lc's asap
BoomBeach,3dqxjk,110010101101000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:11 2015 UTC,I'm lvl 31 and can't beat 40's
BoomBeach,3dq9ys,BoomBeachTwitter,3,Sat Jul 18 12:02:05 2015 UTC,Of course it's a terrible combo. The idea with riflemen is to swarm a base and over power it with sheer numbers.
BoomBeach,3dq9ys,MixedWithFruit,3,Sat Jul 18 15:06:44 2015 UTC,It seems to work pretty fucking good for him
BoomBeach,3dq1ot,Jaygro01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:38:20 2015 UTC,I did that once on a lc 16 upgrade and didn't even realize until a few hours later. Worst thing ever.
BoomBeach,3dq1ot,mwilkens,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:31 2015 UTC,OUCH! Did you use the huge amount of resources to upgrade something else that costs a lot?
BoomBeach,3dq1ot,ballsofpeel,4,Sat Jul 18 09:48:50 2015 UTC,"Well since my storages were near maxxed at the time of canceling, the majority of my """"refund"""" just went to waste... So i just started the LC18 upgrade all over again -.-"
BoomBeach,3dq1ot,sevenpack,2,Sat Jul 18 10:12:55 2015 UTC,And all that effort for one effin slot on a landing craft.  Ouch.
BoomBeach,3dq1ot,Whitelighttwo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:57 2015 UTC,I did the same thing recently.  Ouch.  Really sucks.  Congrats on getting several LC's to lvl 18 though!
BoomBeach,3dq1ot,KatheyKane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:19:16 2015 UTC,Cheers ! Trogging along
BoomBeach,3dqrx9,oxosp,3,Sat Jul 18 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, how are you supposed to get 50 intel a week? I'm in a reddit TF with a requirement of 20 that I can just about manage, but after doing that for a couple of weeks my VP is so high that I struggle to beat anything and I'm constantly getting destroyed.  Surely by attacking enough to bring that much intel would just lead to you having far too much VP?"
BoomBeach,3dqrx9,jardantuan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"the game works differently according to your level. If you have a maxed troop you will never have a base in your map you can't defeat,  it's just a matter of how many casualities you will get and how many statues you have to boost.  Here's some tips to get intel without raising vp too much:  -Always clear NPC bases before PVP, the vp gain is very small.  -Don't bother attacking resource bases, leave them to your opponent, they give you vp but not intel.  -If you struggle with high vp start upgrading attacking buildings (armory, gunboat, landing crafts, sculptor) before defensive buildings. Will be easier to attack other bases and you will get raided a lot because you are an easy target."
BoomBeach,3dqrx9,greennick,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:34 2015 UTC,"The first point can't be emphasised enough. You should be clearing NPC bases multiple times a day, even if you have nothing to spend the resources on. The NPC bases will just come back anyway and by holding some resources you become a juicier target to get more intel and drop VP."
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,ninenines999999999,3,Sat Jul 18 06:43:51 2015 UTC,I agree or atleast a smarter route. Now I sometimes need to use flares to evacuate my costly troops...
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,Inventi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, and by that point I'm usually out of GBE. They could probably build it into the AI that they could recognize the path of least resistance back to the landing crafts."
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,greennick,3,Sun Jul 19 00:40:35 2015 UTC,Retreat? Who retreats?
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,JasonTheHero,3,Sun Jul 19 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"In ops, per say, when you lost all your troops but a couple medics. I love watching them get killed anyway trying to run through boom cannons. I'm not a sadist I swear"
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,greennick,4,Mon Jul 20 03:04:58 2015 UTC,"Just throw a spare artillery on them. They knew what they signed up for, there as never going to be any witnesses."
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,JasonTheHero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:08:39 2015 UTC,I like it. I'll try it next chance I get
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,cocaine_enema,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, is your TF full? Just looked through the official list of TFs and yours looks to be the one I'm not to high or low for. [does iOS vs droid matter like it does in somegames?  iPhone 5s]"
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,S1n3k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:02 2015 UTC,Nine.
BoomBeach,3dpqxq,ronnoc85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:22:06 2015 UTC,"Wow I literally just posted this question, didn't even see this haha. I completely agree man!"
BoomBeach,3drmfj,Inventi,2,Sat Jul 18 20:03:41 2015 UTC,This could be a balancing issue as to not make the medic too powerful. (Stacking damage Guardians with one strong damage Masterpiece)
BoomBeach,3drmfj,ichdurfte,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:31:21 2015 UTC,Tmed is good enough as it it.
BoomBeach,3drmfj,Kyleclaarrk20,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"How about just a whole new red statue, that improves med hp/p sec.  And since it then would be rather easy to stack those, make the hp/p sec really low, so maybe a max MP was 10 hp/p sec or something."
BoomBeach,3dt17s,Wannagetdirty69,2,Sun Jul 19 04:22:57 2015 UTC,All the time.  They work slower and slower as the game goes on...
BoomBeach,3dt17s,negtive82,2,Sun Jul 19 19:43:06 2015 UTC,They look drunk to me
BoomBeach,3dt17s,negtive82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:46 2015 UTC,And we can't even fire them and get new ones
BoomBeach,3dqo8f,mikeanderson401,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:57:13 2015 UTC,You can't type 9000s either
BoomBeach,3dqo8f,MatthewJordan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:27:29 2015 UTC,Really? I wonder why this is....
BoomBeach,3dsnim,Goodby39,4,Sun Jul 19 01:56:38 2015 UTC,If he's got level 15 warriors he probably can take down plenty of people your level. And he probably gets tons of loot for it. I bet he's perfectly happy with his vp
BoomBeach,3dsnim,etown361,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Matching 511 vp at level 41 seems very high, but not impossible. I have seen some players claim 500vp at level 40... So they have to be on someone's map"
BoomBeach,3dsnim,heinz_b,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:48:43 2015 UTC,I don't get it
BoomBeach,3dsnim,IMASTRBATETOANYTHING,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:44 2015 UTC,He's level 53 but the base he's looking at is only level 41.  The games matchmaking system is supposed to match you with players of roughly the same level.
BoomBeach,3dsnim,DEEGOBOOSTER,4,Sun Jul 19 03:18:59 2015 UTC,"Well the matchmaking system goes solely off vp, I'm not sure you're supposed to get matched with people of your level. I'm pretty much solely offensive and I'd hate to be matched with people only my level. I'd never get upgrades done."

BoomBeach,3dsnim,Kyleclaarrk20,3,Sun Jul 19 19:09:48 2015 UTC,Just to the tanks.
BoomBeach,3dr4tx,NardDogggg,2,Sat Jul 18 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"No, the people who show up on your map don't necessarily have you on their map"
BoomBeach,3dr4tx,Crazycoolcats,2,Sat Jul 18 17:49:36 2015 UTC,Ok. Thanks for replying.
BoomBeach,3dskoo,Natoplanes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"You can buy gems if you want to donate, I also think I read somewhere that they will not be putting in flying troops."
BoomBeach,3dskoo,TheYrahcaz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:43:55 2015 UTC,Aren't critters basically flying troops? Or at least paratroops.
BoomBeach,3dskoo,lyyki,3,Sun Jul 19 17:25:41 2015 UTC,Critters don't fly. Flight requires some sort of sustained aerial capacity. Critters fall with style.
