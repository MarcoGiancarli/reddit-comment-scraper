Ford,3dy7zy,elli0tt,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:05 2015 UTC,15 model year focus has some modifications to the interior that I wish my 14 had. The cupholders in the 14 and prior can't fit more than one cup with a wider top than the cup's base. There is also zero space to put an mp3 player or rest your phone. The 15 spread the cup holders out and added a nook in the center console for devices. They also made the grill the new Ford standard and in my opinion it looks way better.

Ford,3dskke,SEA_tide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"Most ex-police vehicles are sold at auction.  Check the local auction house near you and ask if they sell former government vehicles.  Ritchie Brothers is one of the largest auctioneers for commercial vehicles in the US and Canada and likely has a location near you.  Because police vehicles idle for a long time, the general rule is to multiple the stated mileage by 2.  A lot of people prefer buying the police chief/sheriff's actual vehicle because they generally have less wear and tear.  You can go into a Ford Dealer and purchase a new Explorer with the exact same engine and transmission specifications as the police versions and some will sell the police versions themselves.  Not all dealers sell to government agencies and thus many won't carry the police versions.  In Seattle, I know of one, possibly two dealers which bid on police contracts.  The Explorers are sitting right there on the lot for anyone to buy, though most of the salespeople will steer potential buyers towards other versions."

Haima (Hainan Mazda) builds facelifted old Mazdas, Beijing Jeep built the original good Cherokees until a few years ago when Fiat decided to pull the licenses from them and build Jeeps in their own Chinese factories. No surprise that this small company with a Ford partnership would continue to build a dated (but I've heard much stronger than Transit) van.

They're tougher than anything else that China builds, and look like gray imports versus locally made vehicles, standing out nicely on Chinese roads.  Other Chinese companies building old foreign cars:  On the other hand, many companies in China build shoddy versions of the 1989-2002 Toyota Hiace van.  Another company building old foreign cars in China is not a Chinese company, it's GM China! They made the Buick Century until 2008, and still make the 1995-2004 Buick minivan.

Ford,3dl534,toogaloon,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Dude awesome! Im adding fog lights to my ford explorer sport in the next week or so!

Ford,3dl534,jadengx,2,Fri Jul 17 05:16:35 2015 UTC,Oh really?? How exactly did you go through the firewall? Im going to be getting my wiring harness tomorrow and start working on how to set it up this weekend.
Ford,3dl534,vaporsilver,2,Fri Jul 17 05:20:20 2015 UTC,Right below the steering column is clear on both sides so you can drill right through. It's much easier to drill from inside the cab to the engine bay than it is from the engine bay to the cab. I assume it is the same or similar for the Explorer because the dash and engine bay are so similar.

Ford,3dndud,m4050m3,4,Fri Jul 17 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"2000-2004 models: auto trans can die @150k miles if fluid and filter not changed on schedule. Manual transmission is very strong. Single overhead cam motors have a crappy design, exhaust valve seats can fall out, destroying motor. Best to get a dual overhead cam zetec motor. Alternators can have issues, wiring harness plug can melt causing dead batteries. Easy fix, replacement plug is cheap. Idle speed control can malfunction causing driveability issues. EGR valve should be cleaned @100k. Numerous check engine codes can be traced to rusty wiring harness ground points, clean them up and issues should go away. Water pump, thermostat should be replaced with timing belt. Due to age, valve cover gasket should be replaced to keep oil leaks from occurring. Timing belt should be replaced @100k miles. 2005-2011 models: trans will last if maintained. Duratec motor has timing chain, should last life of car if oil changed regularly. The Duratec motors seem to be lasting, a version of this motor is used in the Ford Escape hybrid for Taxis in NYC, many of those are hitting 600,000 miles, very durable. Motor mounts get loose and floppy @ 100k miles, all 3 can be had for less than $100, replacing them fixes vibration issues and makes it feel like a new car. Exhaust flex pipes on all models wear out quickly if motor mounts are bad, mine sounded like a motorcycle before new flex pipe, quiet now. Rear upper control arm bushings wear out, causing vague handling and excessive rear negative tire camber that eats tires. Replacement upper arms are cheap and relatively easy to install, tightens up handling. Door handles get stiff if not lubricated, silicone spray works wonders. All models of Focus seem to wear out front wheel bearings @150k miles, I installed new wheel bearings, control arms and bushings, ball joints, steering tie rods and struts, brake pads and rotors for less than $300, night and day difference. Overall, the Focus is a great platform, they sold a ton of them in the last decade and replacement parts are cheap. With maintenance 200k miles is not excessive. Check underneath for excessive rust, in the northeast it seems if now,  previous owner took time to wash salt off the undercarraige rust won't take over. My partners 05 just hit 154,000 miles; over the past 6 years we've done $1200 in maintenance, still drives like new and cheaper than a car payment. My 01 has 230k miles and died, I'm swapping in a dohc motor and manual transmission right now, I have less than $2000 invested in the car."
Ford,3dndud,takeitapart4x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"Escorts are pretty reliable. Avoid pre-91 models, they had build quality issues. 91 and up used Mazda BG chassis, which gives it pretty good handling for a cheap econobox. 91-96 was second generation, and 98-03 was third and last generation. Automatic transmissions will hold up well as long as you don't beat on them. You might consider installing an auxiliary transmission cooler. Manuals are more durable, but still have weak differentials, so don't dump the clutch at every stoplight and you'll be fine.  Most second gens had the 88hp 1.9L Ford SOHC. Don't miss any oil changes and you will have a better chance at avoiding the valve-seat-dropping issue. Escort GT hatchback had the 127hp 1.8L Mazda DOHC.  Third gen had the 110hp 2.0L SOHC SPI engine in the four-door sedan. Has similar valve seat issues to the older 1.9L, but same maintenance rules apply. The 2-door ZX2 came standard with the 130hp 2.0L DOHC Zetec. It's a solid engine, but has some common problems like vacuum leaks in the PCV line.  All 91-03 escorts came with NON-interference engines. The Zetec for some reason was listed as an interference engine, so many people sell ZX2s cheap when the timing belt breaks because they believe the engine is ruined.  There is an aftermarket for Escorts, but it's pretty small, especially being out of production for 12 years now.  You should be able to find a decent condition escort for 1500, especially if you look at second gens. All of them are fun to drive. I had a 91 wagon, a 98 ZX2, and I now drive a 99 ZX2. Btw, the wagons aren't very ""cool"", but you can haul tons of crap in them."

Joking aside, this Mustang v. Fusion question tells me you are just shopping for a box with wheels, so why not just go with the less expensive of the two? You can keep the $2,400 for the baby room fund, because she sure as hell isn't going to let you blow it on a man cave or anything manly."

Then it was a tug of war because she wouldn't let me drive the goddamn car.   I was going to take exception on your weather comment re: Maryland, but our (DC metro, I'm in NOVA) problem isn't the shitty weather, it's the shitty drivers that can't grok driving on even a quarter inch of snow on a modern car with the correct tires and with traction control and ESC."

I find myself checking out mustangs a lot on the road though. But they're totally different cars, so you can't really compare them. I'd rather have my fully loaded fusion than a base model mustang though."
Ford,3djuwy,0651,2,Thu Jul 16 23:51:48 2015 UTC,"Tough call. Are you looking at the 2.0 ecoboost Fusion? Any weather reasons for having the front wheel Vs. Rear wheel drive in your area?

I went with the Mustang and love it, but sometimes I miss being able to survive off 20 dollars  worth of gas for several weeks instead of days.

Ford,3div27,geralddarden,5,Thu Jul 16 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"Well, they can't void the whole warranty first off. If it starts throwing codes for air/fuel ratio issues they might not cover that. If you sucked up some water or threw off the afr enough and blew the engine up that way they wouldn't cover the engine (assuming they could show that is what caused it). There's no way they would be able to tell you had one on there though if you wanted to swap it out before taking to dealer though.   I had one on my Speed 6 back in the day but just to play it safe, I went with the brand part that I bought from the dealer and had them installed after being scared from some of the stories of exploding engines from the forums. Just go talk to the service manager where you plan on taking the car, they can surprise you. Before I put an exhaust on my Mustang I checked and they confirmed unless there was some problem due to lack of backpressure that they didn't care.  Congrats on the new ride! How are you liking it?"

Ford,3div27,svtguy88,3,Thu Jul 16 23:51:05 2015 UTC,"Talk to your Ford service before installing. Some are pretty strict about aftermarket parts. However, my dealership said a CAI is fine, and most bolt on parts are fine as long as they use Ford sensors. When I took my car to get serviced I put stock parts back on just in case."
Ford,3div27,FabulousaurusRex,3,Thu Jul 16 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"I'm no Ford tech, but everyone I know that is still under a warranty just swaps their stock parts back when they are going to the dealer.  A CAI will not blow up your engine (unless you drive into a big puddle and suck up a bunch of water).  I don't know enough about the SHO to really comment, but I know for my car, a K&N panel filter flows just as well as a CAI, and you avoid the chances of hydrolock (and you also avoid sucking in hot air like a short-ram setup does).  Just food for thought."
Ford,3div27,takeitapart4x,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"We take on a cause and effect approach at my dealer.  If we can identify the cause of a failure to be an aftermarket add-on, we will not warranty it. Also, if you were to install a tuner then revert it back to stock, we can tell."
Ford,3div27,wackywabbit,2,Fri Jul 17 00:02:32 2015 UTC,Get a second opinion on the intake you plan to install. Many don't add useful horsepower and only increase noise and risk of hydrolock.
Ford,3div27,NIUent,2,Fri Jul 17 01:06:45 2015 UTC,It won't void your warranty. But if you get a cel and that is the cause you will pay the diag for it.   If it's the root cause of the problem.
Ford,3div27,sexandliquor,2,Fri Jul 17 12:41:25 2015 UTC,"The only benefit to a cold air intake on these cars is when they are paired to a custom tune for the highrr octane/shift points - that is the part that would void the warranty. If you are going with a no tune required cai with a venturi tube in it, expect 3-4rwhp increase. Not even worth the time kr hassle.  All the power comes from the tune. Have you researched any of the sct xcal stuff?  You can tell if the car has had its strategy code flashed."
Ford,3div27,technologiq,2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:58 2015 UTC,"You don't really want a CAI on your car anyway. It doesn't do anything, besides take some money outside your wallet."
Ford,3div27,rustyself,3,Thu Jul 16 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"This right here.  If CAI did what people think, manufacturers would be putting them on from the factory.      On 99.9% of vehicles, simply replace your standard air filter on a timely basis and you'll get the exact same performance gains as a K&N.  Plus you won't be allowing larger particles to enter your engine and you get the satisfaction of not throwing your money away."
Ford,3div27,MrZz108,2,Thu Jul 16 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being down voted for this. A PCM will maintain whatever the factory preset (like AFR) is no matter what mods are made, so it IS useless. The only way to take advantage of bolt ons like intakes is tuning the PCM to manage it."
Ford,3div27,rustyself,3,Thu Jul 16 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"Performance Engineer here.  They're not useless.  Many stock intakes are designed to be restrictive to reduce noise, so a CAI can help your engine breathe better.  Your PCM does not always maintain a perfect stoichiometric A/FR.  It will adjust based on driver demand, manifold pressure, unburned fuel, etc.   If you can supply your engine with more air, your PCM will compensate by supplying more fuel = stronger combustion = more torque.   Granted, the potential torque increase from stock to aftermarket is sometimes negligible, and tuning your car to be less ""emissions-conscious"" can improve your vehicle performance with any intake.  The point though is they aren't useless.  It really depends on what's under your hood."
Ford,3div27,MrZz108,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:22:55 2015 UTC,"I kinda see what you're saying, but the only time the pcm isn't trying for a stoichiometric afr is during wot, open loop commands. Just because there is more air available doesn't mean it will consume more air, especially when the vehicle is equipped with butterfly valves on the intake runners, right?"
Ford,3div27,rustyself,3,Thu Jul 16 23:32:05 2015 UTC,"There are more cases when you want something other than 14.7 A/F ratio than just WOT.  One example of when you'd want to run rich is in high gear, partially open throttle (POT) to help climb hills when your car hasn't hit the lugging limit to downshift.  Another is when you release the throttle and begin coasting (low driver demand) your engine will run lean to improve fuel economy.   And you're right.  Though the only exception is at WOT.  The air entering your engine isn't steady state, it is very transient and your performance at WOT is highly dependent on how quickly the pressure inside your intake manifold can stabilize.    Just to try to create an image in laymen's terms of how the air enters your engine: It is sucked in through each cylinder, will hit the valves when they close, and be sucked in again, hit the valves, and repeat.  The air will enter your manifold faster than it can enter the cylinders, so it will build pressure (still well below atmospheric) and eventually reach a steady state.  This pressure difference is needed for air to flow inside your engine.  But at WOT, the pressure difference is much smaller than at steady state (constant throttle) so the quicker you can get your manifold pressure to stabilize, the better.  If you have a restrictive intake, a CAI can help.  But if your manufacturer already has an open pipe to your manifold, a CAI is pretty much a waste of money."

Ford,3deobu,clipsound,5,Wed Jul 15 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"This new restyle definitely looks better than the outgoing model, but even that was such a huge step up from the old boxy Explorer.  I just wish that new vehicles didn't cost an arm and a leg with a side of kidney.  I would totally spring for a new Explorer Sport."
Ford,3deobu,jjohnston12385,3,Wed Jul 15 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Well if you're looking at a Sport of course it's costly. The Explorer can be had for a good price if you lower your trim standards! But I feel you, I want the Sport too. That 3.5TT is a stellar motor."
Ford,3deobu,BaconMaster64,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"If the 3.5 EcoBoost was an available option on the lower trim models they would sell like hotcakes, I guess Ford figures they make more forcing people to move up to the Sport to get it though"

Ford,3deobu,BaconMaster64,3,Thu Jul 16 18:13:19 2015 UTC,The sport trim levels that Ford offers are stunning. Someone near me just got a brand new Edge Sport that's in that sunset gold color....swoon. It's stunning to say the least.  edit: This is the one - http://fiestast.net/z-img/electric-spice-edge.jpg It would appear the color is called electric spice
Ford,3deobu,devildog25,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:52:22 2015 UTC,Yeah Sunset is the funky dark orange color. I do like that gold though.
Ford,3deobu,Sternreisender,2,Fri Jul 17 23:43:34 2015 UTC,I love it. I like that Ford has started offering cool colors for their SUVs since it seems like every other one is a boring black or silver

Ford,3dey6e,NoCold,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:11:56 2015 UTC,It looks like you bought the right part. Is it just the one wire or all the wires that have the terminal sticking out that far? You may be able to pull the wire back through the plastic connector a bit but be careful as you can pull the wire out of the terminal. I looked around and even the NGK wire set looks like the terminals stick out that far. Have you verified that the locking tabs on the could side are cliping into place?
Ford,3dey6e,gergorian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"The terminals seem to be pretty solid I don't think I can move them inside the plug, and the clips are snapped properly. Somehow the problem just solved itself so I'm going to just accept that and enjoy my truck running well lol."
Ford,3dey6e,Kodomachine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:13:28 2015 UTC,I order some stuff on amazon but car parts are super hit or miss. If you have to go online try Rockauto.com they have pictures and usually carry oem parts. If not call up and autoparts store see if they have the part go in and check it out. They're usually very cool with you comparing the old to the new and this will probably give the best answer without spending more cash. I would also have to assume there is a ranger forum full of good info. Typically you don't have to make an account and someone has probably into this problem before.
Ford,3dc8x2,okr4mmus,6,Wed Jul 15 03:33:26 2015 UTC,"Ranger is still produced, but I don't think ford sells it in America anymore as they are trying to protect their market for F-Trucks. We have the new ones here in Australia, pretty good all except the 6 speed Auto, its Bloody blismal."
Ford,3dc8x2,AussieGreaseMonkey,2,Wed Jul 15 08:02:20 2015 UTC,It can't be imported because of the Chicken Tax.
Ford,3dc8x2,IVIattEndureFort,4,Wed Jul 15 11:46:45 2015 UTC,"It wasn't selling.  For the last 7 or so years of its production in the US, they were selling fewer and fewer Rangers."
Ford,3dc8x2,based_honkey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:53:28 2015 UTC,"It makes sense, i mean how much cheaper can a ranger be than an f150? A new f150 sells for around 20k. Even if a new ranger sold for 15k, why not spend the extra cash and just get a full size truck? This might not be the reason for the decline in sales but its just my 2 cents"
Ford,3dc8x2,OldManPhill,4,Wed Jul 15 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"15k got you a top Ranger, 20k gets you a base F150"
Ford,3dc8x2,Bullets_TML,4,Wed Jul 15 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Ford stopped making the Ranger because it wasn't selling much. It cost only marginally less than a F150, got only marginally better fuel economy and was far less capable in terms of being a truck (towing/hauling).   Ford started making a new Ranger in 2011-12 and selling it pretty much everywhere but the US. The reason Ford doesn't sell it in the US is basically the same as stated above, plus it will potentially take market share away from the F150. There are conflicting reports on whether Ford will start selling it in the US again. A couple years ago, it was a very solid ""NO"" but lately it seems to be starting to lean more toward ""Maybe... but probably not."" If the Colorado/Canyon keep selling like they are, that ""Maybe..."" will probably become a ""Yes, before we lose more sales."" Within the next 5 years, there will probably be something in the works. Don't hold off for one any time soon though.  TL;DR: Can't get a Ranger in the US, don't expect one any time soon."

Ford,3dc8x2,manicjester3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:40:58 2015 UTC,What is it about the Tacoma that you like? Especially the 2016 model compared to earlier ones and the Colorado.
Ford,3dc8x2,Stevenmc1911,0,Wed Jul 15 20:10:31 2015 UTC,"The Colorado is a great little truck, but if you build one comparable to a F150/Silverado/Ram, it's only marginally cheaper. For a 4x4, 4 door with a few options it's like ~$36k for the Colorado vs like ~$40k for the F150/Silverado. For ~$4k more (<$100 a month) I would buy the full size version."
Ford,3dc8x2,Justice502,2,Wed Jul 15 12:44:12 2015 UTC,I was working at a dealership and from what I understand they're coming out with a new ranger and bronco in the next year or so

A family member is friends with a dealer tech and said that its possible we could see a new bronco. Ford has to do this right though. military alloy. Flat plane crank, upgraded 3.5l eco and diesel option. Led lights. I personally liked the idea of a bronco as its like an suv with more of the work being on cargo rather than passengers, but can still function as an suv"

As far as maintenance, spark plugs will be the biggest expense(suggested to be replaced at 100k) because they have a tendency to break off in the heads. Other than that, I only worry about oil changes every 4k miles. In my opinion, this is a very strong and reliable truck, and I absolutely love it.

Most cosmetic parts from the Bronco, F150, F250, F350 and F450 should all work.   This will open up your options for parts massively.

I pull into his driveway (probably three minutes after the steering message) and put it in park. My dash lights up like a Christmas tree, and the screen between the gauges goes black. I shift to drive and it won't move, but it'll rev. I turn off the car, and turn the key back to start, but nothing. No dinging, not cranking, no clicking. Unplugged the battery and plugged it back in. Car was able to start but there was a check engine light with code p2610 and u0073. Drive it home and it told me hill start assist was unavailable and that my handbrake was engaged while it wasnt. Took it to Ford and all they did was clear the codes. Im almost positive it's bigger than that. I'm actually kinda scared to drive it now.

By now I would imagine all dealers have dealt with one of these by now so best corse of action would just be to go in tell them what happened ie; went to take off, car lurched power train light is on (the gear not the engine).  Be polite, they probably won't offer the loan car off the bat but if you ask nicely they should do one for free as part of the customer satisfaction program.

Ford,3d53ji,Brooklyn8828,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"Retired police cars are fantastic! Most police agencies in my experience take very good care of their vehicles, while in service.   Other then that they are pretty bullet proof and reliable, and if it does need some repairs down the road almost all the parts are readily available and can be affordable, partly due to the vehicles success as a flagship fleet vehicle for a decade or more.  Things to watch out for would be stiffering steering, could be a steering shaft starting to seize. Electrical issues due to their haste to remove saftey lighting and equipment they can sometimes cut or chaff important wires.  Manifold leaks! The vehicles exhaust may seem louder with or with out a rattle. Due to the vehicles being in all types of weather their undersides can get quite rusty.   Their great cares go for it."
Ford,3d4btf,Jsinmyah,-1,Mon Jul 13 12:26:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if the dealership will do any warranty work if you didn't get it at a Ford dealership to start. Doesn't hurt to talk to a service adviser and see what they say about the issue. Does your car currently have said wrench light issue or is this more precautionary?
Ford,3d4btf,darkfaust,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:31 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too. The wrench is on. It cut the engine while I was driving down the freeway yeaterday. Of course it happened when no one was open. I was concerned about driving it so I left my vehicle in a parking lot under a police tower. The ford dealership opens in 15 minutes but carmax doesn't open for another 2 hours.
Ford,3d4btf,TritonM,0,Mon Jul 13 13:14:38 2015 UTC,"In most instances the warranty eligibility carries over to the new owner of the vehicle. Ford doesn't turn away a warranty repair because it was purchased somewhere other than a ford dealership.

Ford,3d3byj,divafeverjive,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:48:44 2015 UTC,I would say 66 xp or the earlier xm falcon. The two models are very similar in looks at the front. I doubt it's a fairlane as they are a bigger car compared to the falcon. I'm fairly sure as my dad owned an xp while I was growing and I eventually bought my own xp a couple of years back.
Ford,3d3byj,seizure--salad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:30:15 2015 UTC,"That's true that Fairlanes are a larger model than the Falcon.

Compare the grille, Ford emblem position, hood bulge, bumper bolts position, and license plate surround shape with the 1964 Fairlane in this photo and you'll see they all match.  http://assets.hemmings.com/story_image/226481-1000-0.jpg?rev=2"

Ford,3d28du,DR3GSZ,3,Sun Jul 12 22:55:35 2015 UTC,"Sync3 is said to be very nice.  Cosmetically, there won't be many changes and 2015s will still be produced at the same time as the early 2016s.  Ford might heavily incentivize the 2015s however.  2014s were a great deal at the end of last year, though they are the older generation.  It's amazing to me that F-150 crew cabs are considered replacements for minivans and older Explorers/Excursions.  If you live in an area with plenty of parking, they are an excellent choice.  Ford has been known to send $750-1000 discount vouchers for those who order brochures online (not at the dealer) and say they are going to purchase within the next 30 or possibly 60 days.  Know as well that you should always be able to get X-plan pricing or lower, plus incentives, unless it's a very specific specialty model. Compare dealers, especially larger dealers in rural areas or Texas which sell a lot of F150s.  Note that if you live in a state with high doc fees, X-Plan automatically reduces the doc fees to $100.  I haven't tried the I-4, but the EcoBoost engines are very nice and quiet.  Note that 4x4/AWD versions will be taller and might make setting up car seats more difficult."
Ford,3d28du,SEA_tide,3,Mon Jul 13 03:38:10 2015 UTC,"Since you won't be off-roading, you would be fine with 2wd, depending on if you get snow in your area.   For the motor, I would go with the 5.0, as the ecoboosts have been having some trouble with timing chain failure. That's mostly on older models, but it may be best to wait just a few years. The 5.0 is a simpler engine, and will get pretty decent mileage"
Ford,3d28du,fretsurfer12,2,Mon Jul 13 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like waiting for sync3 is more then worth it. There is no official release date yet but they are getting close.   I work for Ford, my company does support work for PA and PR events.   For example last month we had 50 different cars in an event. With the current sync it took over 25 minutes a car to input 5 different destinations in the navigation under ""favorites"". When using the few cars with Sync3 it literally to seconds for destination. It's intuitive and the voice recognition is SOOOO much better then trying to talk to regular sync.   There's no more pesky navigation SD cards to update. It updates itself remotely. It's faster and more precise."

Ford,3cxxf2,TheReal_Shah,2,Sat Jul 11 19:47:59 2015 UTC,"As others stated, there are ways to lift it. There are struts that you can buy that will lift it a bit. The front will need new UCAs though, the angle it puts the stock ball joint at is shit. If you wanna lift it, go for it. Have some fun and enjoy what you drive. I lifted the front of mine to level it to the back and put a bigger tire on. I love the hell out of mine and it gets me where I need it to. Though I'll admit it never sees serious off road since it couldn't really handle wheeling, but it makes it down some decently rough trails for camping. You can look into the Rancho Quick lift or look into strut spacers.  Edit: this album is a little old, I've update lights and crap since but you can see the tires and lift in the front. I used strut spacers for the front."
Ford,3cxxf2,tbare91,4,Sat Jul 11 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"Shocks won't lift it, you'll need coil overs as well.   Why do you want to lift it?

Ford,3cxxf2,BlackOxen,6,Sat Jul 11 20:31:44 2015 UTC,"Yes you can lift with just shocks and no they do not need to be coil overs.   I run Bilstein 5100 Series in my F150 and they're adjustable from 0"" to 2.75"" of lift."

Ford,3cxxf2,SeattleOverSF,3,Sun Jul 12 01:49:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The only real reason to lift is to offroad the vehicle, but to make an explorer a wheeling rig would cost thousands. Better to start with a better platform and not try to make the explorer something it's not."

My 0-60 time is probably right at 9 or little under. So basically you're getting the same kind of performance as a 2L I4 from an engine half the size and one less cylinder.   Yeah I knew that the automotive world regarded that engine very highly. Ford has been doing some pretty awesome things as of late."
Ford,3crvad,hvidgaard,2,Fri Jul 10 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to explain or measure it, but the low rpm torque is what surprised me the most when I got the car. It feels kinda like diesel power, but with gasoline acceleration. I only test drove a 1L 125 hp sport model when I ordered, no red edition had arrived in the country yet.  I've been fortunate to drive many Mercs and BMW on a daily basis, both sport and limosine class cars. Nothing has been as 'fun' as this Fiesta though. The Fiesta does by no means offer the same comfort, which will be missed on long distance trips, but I smile in every curve and roundabout."
Ford,3crvad,raptor2skooled,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:46:09 2015 UTC,Lucky. My powerband seems to be very limited in my Focus Sport. If you're below 3000rpm then you're gonna be a tad sluggish. Once you get above 3000 then it takes off and is super responsive.   I agree. I've driven two of my dream cars: Nissan GTR and Gallardo LP-560. I even took both of them on the track and hit speeds of 130+. But I had a lot more fun in an ST that I test drove. Why? I think it's because 1) I could bang out the gears using a proper stick (not a fan of the paddles) 2) you don't have to hit triple digits to have fun in a hot hatch. I remember the first time I took my Focus to the mountains after installing a CAI and short throw shifter.....I smiled like a kid on Christmas day.
Ford,3crvad,nikkistl,2,Fri Jul 10 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"The Fiesta EcoBoost has a slow boost response below 2.5k, but when boost is there it's solid from 1.5k and up really - the torque is amazing from such a small engine - only diesels give you the same experience."
Ford,3crvad,devildog25,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:12:42 2015 UTC,So jealous. I wish they would bring this over. All we get is the SFE model with the 1L. Although after test driving feels much better than the 1.6L NA.
Ford,3crvad,nikkistl,2,Fri Jul 10 16:36:07 2015 UTC,Nah - I've had the Focus ST and now have the Fiesta ST. Not everyone in the US wants to be forced to have the three door. I like the shorter doors - it makes it much easier in tight spots and I don't have to flip the seat forward to put my photography gear on the back seat like I do with my Mustang. :)  Having the option to do 3 or 5 like they did when I had my Focus SVT would be nice though for those that want the 3 doors.
Ford,3crvad,devildog25,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:45:32 2015 UTC,That's more or less what I meant. I'd rather have the option. I've seen the FiST and it looks good in 5 doors but seeing this made me want it in 3 doors. Just curious: why did you downgrade in terms of space if you knew you needed it? Is the FiST really that much more fun? I've heard it's better than the FoST.
Ford,3crvad,nikkistl,2,Fri Jul 10 22:40:54 2015 UTC,"Gotcha! I don't need tons of space, I just don't like seat flipping and not quite getting it to the same spot when I put it back like often happens when I drive the Mustang but I don't like throwing my photo gear in the trunk since I am often taking country roads to get to some of my favorite places to shoot. I buckle my gear bag in place so it isn't flying around and getting banged about.  I sometimes miss the extra power of the Focus, but the light weight of the Fiesta is more fun to throw around in the curves and the extra 5 mpg average I am holding over the time I have had the car (vs the Focus ST) is a nice touch as well.That being said, my lease is up next year and I will be happily moving on to the Focus RS (assuming it is all I think it will be). :)"

Ford,3ci36v,TheBanksLife,10,Wed Jul 8 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"There's something charming about a raw V8 and muscle enthusiasts will cradle romantic memories of them but the truth is that massive displacement is a primitive and vanishing powert concept in the automotive world.  Loads of vehicles of all varieties are moving away from 17-liter W16 engines to more modern turbo and hybrid systems.  This ranges from compact cars through muscle and sport to supercars. Even in motorsport there's a move towards more advanced, more modern, more efficient engines wherewith we replace the shit out of displacement.  F1 cars are a fantastic example of this, as they're producing power similar to NASCAR Sprint Cup cars but are doing it with 1.6-liter V6 engines.  If it wasn't for the enforced fuel flow limitation, those tiny 1.6-liter engines are capable of over 1,000 horsepower.  This is the direction we're going in and there's nothing anybody can do to change that."
Ford,3ci36v,IceMan_PJN,9,Wed Jul 8 03:16:34 2015 UTC,"It may be more efficient, and this isn't to say I'm against progress, but I'd say 75% of the reason I got a 15 GT instead of an EB was the sound. Like I said, I'm all for progress and you're absolutely right that we are effectively replacing displacement, but I really hope they don't do away with the V8 completely and give us the option. When the 435 hp V8 gets 21mpg avg for me, I see no reason to sacrifice power and sweet cylinder music for 4 or 5 mpg."

I was about to pull the trigger on an EB before I priced out what the GT would cost. Came out to 27 more a month. To me, there was no contest, had to be the GT."
Ford,3ci36v,WTFbeast,0,Wed Jul 8 23:58:35 2015 UTC,The difference was much more for me here in NC. The only GT's available where I went were the 5.0 and the 50th anniversary edition. Both significantly more expensive than the EB premium with a sticker price of around ~30k which got knocked down to around 25k after all was said and done.

And people will have to pay through the nose in the future for the pleasure of it.   I'd agree with your statement in the sense that, we're at a point in time where people no longer purchase V8 or large displacement engines strictly for power, but for capability which is a different story."

Both cars are good in my opinion but I prefer the stick and turbo in the ST.  Hers gets almost 40 mpg highway and has quite a few options for a cheap payment. We have had no problems with either of them and the build quality seems to be on par for the cost.  Are there other cars out there with higher quality,  more options, or better qualities? Sure, but for the price and what we wanted and what we needed (reliability,  comfort, economy)  it was hard to find anything better. Plus, we have a warranty through our loan and payments close to used cars."

Ford,3ci1gp,shotgun_willie_P,5,Wed Jul 8 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"I've had a 2013 Fiesta for a bit over a year now.  First off, I really enjoy driving the car.  It is an economy car and it shows on occasion but for the price it is definitely met all the expectations I had of it.  Even for a ""slow"" car it is fun to drive and I enjoy throw it around corners and have a bit of fun.  As far as ride quality; it's a ~11,000 car, so it ain't gonna ride like a rolls.  That being said, I've taken  mine on 4-5 hour trips and would do it again without hesitation.  I recently spent ~4 weeks in a focus and I would say the focus was no more comfortable than my Fiesta.  That was all the good stuff, and here is the bad: The car has not been as reliable as I would like it to be.  The clutch in my tranny has gone twice, and no one at ford is willing to say the fix is permanent.  Also, door latches were recalled so the other day the rear passenger door refused to close. Used bungee cords and made the ride home.  All these issues were covered by warranty and Ford has extended the warranty to 100,000 miles.  If you are the kind of person who will get rid of the car before the 100,000 mark then none of this should bother you but when I purchased this car I expected to drive it for 200,000 miles.  That is the longevity I expect from a car.  All the repairs in total would have cost around $7000 if not for the warranty.  TL;DR:  Fiesta is fun and comfortable.  I want to love it but I'm unsure about its long term reliability."
Ford,3ci1gp,shotgun_willie_P,5,Wed Jul 8 03:00:48 2015 UTC,"This is pretty helpful.. Luckily the group of dealerships that we'd be buying through (Whether I get a Fiesta, Sonic, or a Dodge Dart) will be covered with a lifetime warranty, so I won't have to worry about it. I'll be keeping it for at least 6 years, when I finish grad school."
Ford,3ci1gp,FabesE,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"Also, I have the 2013, and they have made some changes since then.  The 2014 was the first year to use the ecoboost engine (mine has the 1.6L N/A).  Ford has said they fixed the transmission issues in later models but I can't get a straight answer from the dealership.  I drove a Sonic and I did not like it as much as the Fiesta.  Ford did an excellent job making a slow car feel fun to drive.  I never test drove the Dart because it didn't come in a hatch (and I am not a Chrysler fan).  I think someone else said it also, go test drive the Mazda 2 and Mazda 3.  They're both good cars and the Mazda 2 is actually built on the same platform as the Fiesta."
Ford,3ci1gp,FabesE,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:19:02 2015 UTC,"I think that I only like the Sonic for the exterior appearance (in the Hatch, at least.) I prefer the interior of the Fiesta MUCH more, at least from pictures. We've been on vacation for two weeks, so I haven't been able to test drive either one yet, unfortunately.   I do really like the Mazda 2 and 3, but my parents are only buying from my local Ford, GM, and Chrysler dealers because they offer lifetime warranties on all of their new vehicles, so there's no point in test driving them just yet."
Ford,3ci1gp,FabesE,3,Wed Jul 8 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"I'd almost certainly only ever recommend a Fiesta or a Fit in this class of vehicle.  They consistently rank the highest on almost every reviewer list.    Chevy is starting to catch up with the rest of the world in terms of quality, but their entry model might be lagging in that.  (nothing bugs me more than the cheap composite shit they used on their dash and wheel in the 00s)  The Fiesta is fun.  It's considerably slower than my last car, but its way more fun.    Anyway, I love hatchbacks, I got it in lime squeeze green with a stick and every tech option that was available on it in 2012.  This car is pretty much perfect for me."
Ford,3ci1gp,Hopper1010,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:40:23 2015 UTC,"I'd hands-down pick a Fit if I wasn't limited to the Ford, Chevy, and Dodge dealerships near me. They include lifetime warranties with all of their new vehicles, and my parents are buying me this as a ""really early graduation present,"" so it's really up to them where we buy from.  I'd also be getting the Hatch in either the Fiesta or Sonic. The Fiesta sedan doesn't look proportional to me, the rear end is up too high in my eye. That, and the cargo space will be helpful, as I'm usually logging around photography equipment."
Ford,3ci1gp,Formber,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that the Fiesta sedan looks odd.  Honestly even the Focus sedan looks a bit off still to me.  With safety requirements though, most small sedans is going to have weird proportions...  Honestly, I would consider also looking at the new Chrysler 200s (won't get quite the same gas mileage, but they look sharp inside and out).  While I am not confident Chrysler has recovered from Daimler's bad management, they have been showing excellent steps in the right direction under new management.  But, they are too new for me to know much on their reliability.  I simply can't recommend any entry model Chevy though.  I worked as a valet for a while and Chevy interiors just don't hold up well, they also feel tacky to me... Some of that is subjective, but I digress..

They bought a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland back in January, and it's been nothing but trouble ever since, especially with the transmission.  We noticed that a new base Focus S is roughly the same price (5-600 dollar difference) as a SE Fiesta, however I'd rather have the extra ""luxuries"" instead of the space."

The suspension on the Fiesta is firm as it's been designed to be sporty - you'd be surprised what you can keep up with on a twisty road. The steering turn in is amazing and even in an automatic you can adjust the car mid corner like no FWD car should be able to.  We bought ours because of the styling, features and reassuring drive.

Ford,3ci1gp,IceMan_PJN,2,Wed Jul 8 10:26:01 2015 UTC,"So I've owned a 2011 Fiesta S and just bought a 2015 Fiesta ST. I daily drove and autocrossed both cars. Honestly the two, aside from appearance, are like two totally different cars to me. In any case they're a great bang for the buck and I'd obviously definitely recommend a Fiesta.   My 2011 lasted me 70k miles until I sold it and I had no problems at all with routine maintenance. I have no doubt it would have lasted twice as long with no hiccups. I got great gas mileage (averaged 38mpgs) and with an hour and a half commute when I had it, it was perfect. As you know the S is very cheap and I more than got my money's worth. I'd definitely go with a higher model if you can, the lack of power windows was pretty sucky. It's not a fast car...at all...but it's a reliable and overall cheap to own car. The S is manual transmission too so I didn't have the issues the automatic transmissions did.  I'd hope by now those issues would be fixed. As far as the Sonic I've only read or heard negative things but have no personal experience.   If you're looking at the STs, it's an absolutely incredible car and only compares the the S in terms of size and name. It feels entirely different to drive and is definitely more performance oriented. It's leagues ahead of any car in its class. However, the suspension is very stiff and it isn't the most comfortable ride so if you're just looking for something to take the family around in, I wouldn't recommend it. In any case I absolutely love my ST!   Let me know if you have any specific questions."

Also, I didn't know that the S only came in a manual, I could have sworn there was an Automatic S at my local dealer.. I'm kinda swaying away from the S because of the lack of power windows, and also the fact that I was able to pry the silver part covering the wheel off with my fingers, and I'm in no way strong.  Unfortunately I can't drive a manual, so that rules out the ST, and if there's an automatic, that's out of my parents' price range.

There is a sensor inbetween the filter and the engine called the Mass Air Flow sensor (MAF). a MAF sensor is just a piece of wire that is heated and senses the amount of air coming into the engine by reading the resistance of that heated wire. if ANYTHING gets on that wire (even a spider web piece) it will throw everything off and make the car run like crap, because it doesnt know how much air is being sucked into the engine.  I should of asked this first, is the check engine light on?"
Ford,3cic8a,bullzi91,2,Wed Jul 8 03:42:17 2015 UTC,Yeah has been on since that coil went bad and hasn't turned off since then.
Ford,3cic8a,bullzi91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:44:29 2015 UTC,"the computer learns and recognizes that the misfire (from the bad coil) is not there any more and will turn the CEL off after a few drive cycles of not having a misfire.  If the CEL is still on then there's another code in there for something, probably for the problem your having. I would go to advanced auto parts or autozone and get the code(s) that are turning your CEL on, that would make things much easier to diagnose; While your there pick up a can of MAF cleaner (pretty much the same as brake clean)"

Ford,3cic8a,bullzi91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:58:29 2015 UTC,Fuel vent system?
Ford,3cic8a,bullzi91,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"There is a vent tube on your filler neck (pipe going from fuel inlet to fuel tank) It sometimes can get clogged and not let fuel flow well.  Also the EVAP (evaporitive emissions) system opens and closes lines going to your fuel tank ment for fuel vapors, if those do not work correct pressure will build in the tank and stop the pump."

Ford,3cb75u,dmatt1024,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"Have you checked the alternator? Could probably just not be charging the battery. Is anything plugged into the truck that takes power, like a plow? Headlights are off? All the doors are closed so that the dome light doesn't stay on? There are a few things it could be. I know the dealership I work at has a Chevy 3500 that can't start on its own because the plow takes too much battery power. The headlights and stereo and heater just add to it and it can hardly keep running all of those things."
Ford,3cb75u,timberwolvesguy,2,Mon Jul 6 15:34:03 2015 UTC,We didn't check the alternator but it dies when it isn't running. Would that still be the alternator?
Ford,3cb75u,docterk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:36:01 2015 UTC,Dies when the alt is not running? If the alt isn't running then there's your problem no doubt.

Ford,3cb75u,docterk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"That would still make sense for it to be the alt, at idle the engine may not be making enough power for the salt to charge the battery."

Ford,3c9sgt,vssadmin,3,Mon Jul 6 05:29:12 2015 UTC,I'd be asking the dealer to throw in the admin key - it's kind of an essential feature of the car. Get Ford corporate involved if they don't play ball.
Ford,3c9sgt,thepaleblue,2,Mon Jul 6 12:31:34 2015 UTC,It's a used car they don't owe him/her anything unless it is in writing. Most reputable dealers will at least reprogram the key for OP but unless s/he got it in writing calling Ford corporate will do jack shit.
Ford,3c9sgt,3031983,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"So the dealer did offer to buy and program the key at their cost although it will be several days, several hours away, cause me to miss work etc. They acted like it was a huge favor, and while technically true I feel like it's poor customer service. They also wouldn't provide a missing floor mat (didn't notice because it was covered with paper) but not a huge deal. Still kind of caught me off guard, a little extra money and work would have left me with a great customer service experience and happy to go back....now I doubt I'd consider it.

Ford,3c258f,stctippr,2,Sat Jul 4 02:19:00 2015 UTC,And some guys are tuning their ecoboosts and getting an extra 30-40 horsepower from them. Thats puts its darn near the 400 mark. They'll blow the '83 GTs doors right off. I just got a 2015 GT but I have no hate for the eco's.

Ford,3c258f,SteveSharpe,3,Mon Jul 6 12:21:47 2015 UTC,"A mustang is a mustang is a mustang. Just because you buy a 2015 with a turbo 4 doesn't mean you don't have a mustang. Just because you have a 95 V6 doesn't mean you don't have a mustang. Just because you have an 83 GT doesn't mean you don't have a mustang.  The engine doesn't make the car. The car makes the car. Mustangs are about going fast and sounding awesome, and the 2015 stangs all do that, whichever engine.  A muscle car is not a V8. A muscle car is any of a group of American-made 2-door sports coupes with powerful engines designed for high-performance driving.   The 2015 mustangs make anywhere from 300 to 435 horsepower, stock. They all share the same chassis, the same IRS, the same high performance capabilities, with a unique American and unique mustang sensibility.   Who the fuck even says 'fuel mileage' is why people are buying these cars? You? Come on. Just because you can't understand why someone would want a car with... an engine, at all... in it, doesn't mean you have to hate on everyone who buys Turbo 4 mustangs."
Ford,3c258f,DaCrate,-1,Sat Jul 4 03:15:12 2015 UTC,that's not at all what I'm doing.  I'd kill to own a 2015 mustang (I drive an 04 Monte carlo) regardless of the engine in it.  it's a beautiful piece of engineering simple as that.  I didn't imply any hate on anyone any owner of a mustang is a part of the club whether it be a fox a sn95 a fastback or a coyote they're all welcome to me.

Ford,3busn2,BooyakashaRespek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"Seeing that it's competing with Golf R and STI I would say $30k entry, maybe $35k for decent options."
Ford,3busn2,jim_trout,2,Thu Jul 2 17:48:39 2015 UTC,"But isn't the Focus ST around $30k? I was thinking the RS would start around $35-36, and well over $40k for the fully equipped model."

They're hoping to get it out early next year so fingers crossed they start releasing allocations around November/December. Production volume is going to play the biggest factor.

Ford,3bxjpe,blackhillsgold,2,Thu Jul 2 23:51:00 2015 UTC,"I know how and that doesn't seem right. The first character should be a letter representing the decade. (C=60s, D=70s, etc). Then the year of the decade, so 6 in your case. Then a letter representing the line of car, A=Full Size Ford (Panther Platform). Then a letter representing the part of the car and it should be E for engine. After that there should be a dash, with the 4 digits which are the actual part number. 6015 sounds right for a 302 but I'm not sure because I'm on mobile right now and can't look it up easily. After the part number there is a dash for the revision letter.   EDIT: are you sure it's not a D? Because D6AE-6015 would make sense."

It's a great car, and a very easy car to work on (if that's your thing). Gas mileage isn't perfect, but it's still an older crossover so there's no surprise there. It's also pretty top heavy, but again, no surprise there.  Do you have a link to the listing? I'd love to see it! Here's a picture of me with mine when I first bought it.

In fact, I doubt someone could prove that anyone has ever wrecked a car and killed an innocent party due to excessive speed. Extra smart points for passing a tractor trailer in excess of 160 mph because if a single spot on public roads offers perfectly still and predictable air it's definitely found in areas around semi trucks. If another driver going the speed limit checks their rear view mirror and sees the GT500 over a mile away and begins to change lanes, shame on them for not knowing that the one mile gap would be closed in under 25 seconds."

Ford,3bfd2d,rodbuster90,11,Sun Jun 28 18:54:35 2015 UTC,"for the lemon of a trans   You said it yourself: what you are driving is a lemon, and this is not representative of every Focus or Fiesta. Do we really need posts like this?"
Ford,3bfd2d,neilalexanderr,-12,Sun Jun 28 20:25:39 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The ford dealership says they have a line out the door of bad cars. It would be irresponsible of me not to warn people about a shit product. Do you not agree?  Edit: Let me make this more specific for people. Every Focus is a Lemon. If you don't have issues now you will.
Ford,3bfd2d,b1ackcat,6,Sun Jun 28 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"If you had undeniable proof that the product itself was indeed ""shit"", then maybe I'd agree. But as you (and the other user) have called out yourself, you got a lemon. Unfortunate, but it happens.  Also, keep in mind that while you are going to a ""ford dealership"", dealerships are independently owned. If you're unhappy with a dealers service, there's no harm in getting a second opinion from another one. You shouldn't lump this single set of experiences with this single car as ""OMFG FORD CARZ SUXXX."
Ford,3bfd2d,devildog25,-11,Mon Jun 29 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"Okay let me clear this up for you Ma'am, the whole Focus line is a lemon. It is EVERY car. Everyone I know who has the piece of shit car has serious issues with it  What are you not understanding? I took it to GALPIN. This post was for the logical bunch out there and not for some Ford fan girl who sticks up for some crooked company selling broke and falty cars to people instead of the consumer. What is wrong with you? If you keep buying ford's your going to find out exactly what I'm talking about."
Ford,3bfd2d,desertwing,6,Mon Jun 29 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't want to tell you that you're flat out wrong....but you kind of are. The DCT's are what's giving people trouble. I bought a 2012 DCT and then gave it to my mom and she's having to get it fixed (not on her dime though). And I bought a '14 Sport with the 5 speed and mines been perfectly fine. I've got 25K on it now and I drive it pretty hard and I've had one issue: a rock got in my window. That's it. I wouldn't say ever Focus is a lemon, I would target the DCT. Which, lets be honest, pretty much the only cars with DCTs are high-end sports cars so this was Ford's first bout with this type of transmission. I think you're frustrated and you have every right to be, but not every Focus is junk."

Ford,3b9hsc,Shardrock,2,Sat Jun 27 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"Seems it is the standard top luxury tier for many Fords like the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, Escape and Transit Connect. Some are using Platinum for the luxury tier, for example the Explorer, Expedition and the F-150. You could argue that Ford sees the Edge as a car, not as a SUV, otherwise the top tier would had changed to Platinum instead of Titanium. What makes no sense is why the hell is the Transit using the Titanium name when it would make more sense for it to use Platinum.  I guess this is what happens when you leave Marketing unsupervised for too long."

Seems odd is all and I'm curious as to why."
Ford,3b9hsc,Pinbrawler,2,Sat Jun 27 02:44:57 2015 UTC,It has a model refresh which is the perfect time to change trim level names to match. I'm sure we will see all refreshes start using that. It's brand consistency.

Ford,3b0xer,Brendan_f18,5,Thu Jun 25 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"It looks like it was an exhaust hanger that rusted and fell off. chances are if the tech did spark plugs, you don't 'have"" to put it on a lift, probably didn't check underneath the car if you didn't say anything about it. If you can, try to pull it out of the rubber so it doesn't come off while driving. its big and weird looking but ford will put (things that look like that) to take some of the vibration out of the exhaust. its probably not a safety concern but I would say to get it checked out."
Ford,3b0xer,bullzi91,5,Thu Jun 25 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"I've got the '01 Escape, but it's basically the same and you're basically right, it's just another exhaust hanger. I had my mechanic take a look at it because I had the same problem when I bought the car. He said that as long as I didn't take it heavy off-roading (which, let's face it, isn't that easy for that car anyway) it shouldn't be a problem."
Ford,3b0xer,devont,3,Thu Jun 25 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it is an exhaust hanger but it isn't a normal hanger. The big cylindrical lump on it is a weight designed to dampen vibrations in the exhaust system and reduce the NVH ( Noise Vibration and Harshness) you can have a shop remove it and just put a regular hanger on there but you may notice some noises and vibrations if you don't have that weight on there. Hope that helps."

Ford,3b0xer,The_Finglonger,2,Thu Jun 25 03:42:24 2015 UTC,"That looks like an exhaust vibration damper.  It's essentially a big weighted piece of metal designed to absorb certain natural resonances in the exhaust system. It's not super critical to the operation of the car, but if it falls off you may damage the undercarriage as it tumbles around.  My suggestion is to find a muffler shop to replace or repair it(weld it back on correctly). There's a good chance most shops would just break it off the rest of the way and call it good. I would want it fixed, but I can be anal like that.   Good luck!"

My husband had to have his USB connector replaced by Ford because there was a crappy connection and it wouldn't see the USB stick until the car warmed up or he pulled it out and put it back in.

But I'd say you might want to have a professional do it.  Here's a video from Livernois motorsports on how to install their kit: https://youtu.be/YsoU2zEWTyE
Ford,3aycrv,bagofwisdom,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't done much mechanic work at all besides the basic stuff. Right now im weighing the options of doing it at all (160k on the truck), buying the kit and having it done at my local garage, or having it done at ford since my office shares a parking lot with a ford dealership.  I'm just curious as if its a day project or a weekend project."
Ford,3aycrv,mksmth,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:28:18 2015 UTC,not sure you can get the dealer to do this one.  It also requires you to install a custom tune. Ford will gladly change the phaser for you though.  About $800-$1000 per side locally is what I was told when I was shopping for a new truck.  an independent shop will be your best bet.

Ford,3aycrv,GuinnessTheDog,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:43:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I just did this kit on my 05 F-150.  Truck had 38K on it when I bought it this passed winter.  No phaser knock until I changed the oil (perhaps the dealer put in heavier oil to hide the knock??).  The repair from Livernois itself is super easy to do.  The hard part is getting the valve covers off, especially on the passenger side.  There is an AC line that runs tight to the valve cover.  My father-in-law and myself tackled the job about 2 weeks ago.  Took the better part of a day, but for a truck that now only has 41K on it, well worth it as I plan to keep it for a long time.  I also decided while it was apart to do the spark plugs, which on the 3V 5.4 is a wonderful design flaw!  I bought the extraction tool and luckily only broke two of the 8 plugs.  In all honesty, if you're comfortable with something like valve cover gaskets, and a consider yourself a little more than the weekend mechanic, the job should be certainly do-able.   Do some research on it.  F150 online is a good place to start.  I will say this, my truck now runs smoother and has way better throttle  response than it ever has in my short time owning it.  I hope this helps."

There was the PZ1F and the PZ14F.  I'm not sure of the difference, perhaps temp?  Also, it's a good idea to get some high temp never-seize and put it on that goofy shank that goes down into the combustion chamber.  Don't get any on the tip of the plug though.  This will help prevent them from getting stuck when doing them again comes around.  I then bought the lisle plug extractor from O'Reilly.  Was about $100.  All said and done, I put about $1000 into the truck, but it sure runs awesome now, and should last forever.  Also, my timing chains were still pretty snug when I got the motor torn down to the cam phasers, so I didn't do tensioners.  They should last as long as the cam phasers aren't failing."

That doesn't necessarily mean that all compact car A/C systems are garbage. I have a 2014 Focus and the A/C is plenty cold. If OP's A/C is blowing warm/hot air, that is clearly an issue.

Ford,3as1s8,i_poop_splinters,2,Sun Jun 28 06:29:27 2015 UTC,"From a technition standpoint they are hard to lift. Because of all the covers under the car (I call them diapers to catch the drips) you're left with only the pinch weld to lift on. Which in most circumstances is ok, except on this particular car I watch them bend a little more everytime. Curious which motor you're looking at buying. The 1.5L and 1.6L seem grossly underpowered. The 2.0L is quite peppy and the 2.5L non turbo is probably the most reliable. Make sure to check for open recalls. Some newer fusions were recalled for steering gear corrosion having the bolts brake and electric steering motor loosen. Another recall for fuel pump replacement. They are fairly comfortable. If you want to use sync and my ford touch try to have a smart phone. It struggles with older phones and/or Trac phones, slider or flip phones. Iphone does work with it but Ford recommends the phone be rebooted once a week. Check into tire prices we just had a customer pay $250 per tire. But I believe they were the 18"" rims."

Ford,3ard1f,Pinbrawler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:55:34 2015 UTC,"I just got a 2013 Focus SE with 60,000 miles for around the same price. When the car was bought, it showed no signs of transmission problems. Now that I've driven it 1,300 miles, the tranny sometimes makes a noise and a little jerky when shifting between gears 1 and 2. It's nothing insane, but it's mildy annoying. I'm thinking about taking it in to get the tranny updated, but at this point, it isn't really worth my time. I still have nearly 40,000 miles of warranty on the car, so I have a while before I have to worry about getting it fixed.  Anyway, my point is that the problems with the transmission is mostly an annoyance and not much more. The Focus is still a great car, and the only thing known to go wrong with it has a ridiculous warranty. I wouldn't let the possibility of being annoyed by the transmission turn you away."

Ford,3aec14,mphelp11,2,Fri Jun 19 12:51:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have suggestions for tires, but there's a couple things you should be aware of. If you go larger, you change how much tire travels each rotation, which makes your speedo and odo inaccurate.  Larger also takes up more room inside your wheel well, so you might scrub the top with suspension travel or inside when you turn. Especially if you make a big enough change to make a difference in going over stuff.   So while you can do what you're thinking, it's not without consequences if you make big enough changes.   Source: engineer at Ford. Anything I say is my opinion and in no way do I speak on behalf of my employer."
Ford,3aec14,see3po,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:21:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm aware it changes the travel, so I really don't want to get tires that are that much larger; just enough to increase the clearance slightly. Just curious, is there any way to compensate for the odometer difference after putting on larger diameter tires?"
Ford,3aec14,see3po,2,Fri Jun 19 13:33:31 2015 UTC,"I don't have a good answer for you there. The electronic modules are locked to prevent easy access especially when it has federal rules like speed and odo. Maybe a dealer, I really doubt end user can change it.  However, if you just want to know yourself,  figure out the percent change in the circumference (or radius). If your current wheel center to ground is 20"" (for example) and your new tire makes it 21"", then 1/20=5%."

Ford,3aec14,Shardrock,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"Sct tuners and I think livernois tuner can change the speedo for tire size changes.  So you should join, fordescape.org there are plenty of users with off-road same size and larger tired sizes. When you go larger you rub when you turn the wheel at full lock. Not to big a deal, but be aware.  I did extensive look into a lift kit. There is none available, only a spacer kit from Europe. Lifts the E 33mm-40 and costs around $500, from delta4x4. The issue I have with that is you are lifting the body up and now change the body roll and the height of center is up. I want a spring solution or full solution. Still waiting :/  If you want to see a sexy off road new gen look at the vacaar concept"
Ford,3aec14,droid6,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:32:54 2015 UTC,How much would changing tire size effect the speedo and Odo readings? As little as going from 60 to 55? Is there any way to compensate for this?  Edit: maybe I should read the whole conversation before asking questions lol

One thing I did notice, or maybe it's just because I was driving the sonic which is a low car, but I feel my headlight are emitting light much higher than I think it was before?  By higher I mean the actual light that's emitted in front of me when I drive, I don't recall it being that high up. I feel like it's blinding other drivers, I don't remember how it used to be but somethings telling me it's wrong.  Just to clarify because I can't find the proper wording, I'm not talking about the light brightness, but the actual lights height level.  Anyways I'm happy to have my car back."
Ford,3aa8h2,Sternreisender,2,Thu Jun 18 13:41:05 2015 UTC,I've put 40k each on a 13 and 14 Fusion and other drivers thought and think I'm using my high beams when I'm not. I've noticed Explorers are similarly bright when I'm facing them in oncoming traffic. Maybe it's something about the halogen glass bulb things.
Ford,3aa8h2,ridethe907,3,Thu Jun 18 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"It's because manufacturers are switching to projector lenses. This is because they give cleaner light output and because of the cut-off they aren't supposed to blind other drivers. However,  projectors are often more blinding than a standard reflector, especially over bumps, as that cut-off bounces in and out of people's eyes."
Ford,3aa8h2,Pinbrawler,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:59:21 2015 UTC,Maybe that. I only got to drive my edge 5 days before I returned it back to the dealer so I probably wasn't used to it.

If you notice any smell, demand new carpet and new jute (this the padding under the carpet). How much water was in the floorboard? There is alot of wiring under the carpet and if any connectors or splices were submerged, you're gonna get many electrical problems down the road with corrosion setting in. This water leak is a bigger problem than Ford is making it, the vehicles came off the line with no body sealer inside causing water to pour in from everywhere that wasn't sealed. The only reason we're pulling interiors out and drying them is to band aid a problem that Ford hasn't even figured out yet. Not trying to bash Ford but we're seeing more and more of these cover ups due to Ford trying to save face with customers that trusted them. It ticks me off because these vehicles could be great if the blue oval would just engineer new features and powertrain components more thoroughly i.e. Escape recalls and the clutch problems we've had. Anywho, I love Ford, it just sucks to see quality going downhill fast. If ya have any questions hit me up. Love the look of the new Edge btw"

The car does have a smell, with the new carpet. I'm not sure what the smell is? Not in my car so I can't really describe it. It's not a bad smell but it had a unique smell. Maybe it's fresh carpet smell?  As for corrosion with wiring, the car is a 2 year lease and I'm done with it. So I hope nothing happens in its lifetime with me."

Ford,3acder,EggsNbeans,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:11:50 2015 UTC,Ford vehicles are one of the safest. That's for sure.
Ford,3acder,rkhamilton91,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"You don't need power steering to drive any vehicle. Sure, it's nice and makes life easier, but it's not a necessity. Do you know anybody with an old car or truck that doesn't have power steering? Giving her some practice in a vehicle like that would help her react appropriately if her power steering goes out in her car."
Ford,3acder,EggsNbeans,3,Fri Jun 19 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"Serious question - Have you ever tried to drive a car that was built with power steering, that lost the power assist?   I'm no mechanic but I'm guessing that old cars with no power steering were built with some sort of mechanical advantage in the system to compensate, as well as the obviously much larger steering wheels.   I'm a fit 190lb male and had trouble turning the wheel on my truck to get it into a parking lot when it lost the power steering at 25mph. I was actually on the highway 5 mins prior, on my way to home depot, but bumper to bumper traffic and I turned around and went home. If this happened at 70mph I'm not sure I'd be here."
Ford,3acder,TJ_McHoonigan,3,Fri Jun 19 06:17:46 2015 UTC,"I have actually. My boss and I brought home the ugliest cab over semi you've ever seen, and it was fitted with a power steering pump that had been unhooked after it started leaking. It was very difficult to turn even with the larger steering wheel on semis, but we were able to get it home.   To your other point, even though you aren't a mechanic, you're correct. The worm gears in power steering pumps have a steeper pitch making them less prone to having the wheels turn the steering wheel. The old vehicles had bigger gears and a less steep pitch to make it easier to turn.   However, you're wrong that at 70 mph you'd be having issues. A parking lot is the hardest place to drive a vehicle without power steering, even the old ones. Since you would be trying to make tight turns very slowly, you would have to really fight with your steering wheel to get it to turn correctly. But, at 70 mph( anything faster than standing still really) you've already got your vehicle moving and it becomes significantly easier to turn your vehicle.   Hope that explains my first comment a little better."

Ford,3acder,EggsNbeans,2,Fri Jun 19 13:46:28 2015 UTC,Those vehicles also had larger steering wheels to give the driver more leverage.
Ford,3acder,ilikeme101,-1,Fri Jun 19 02:25:16 2015 UTC,"thats what I kind of thought, but from what she told me, its was like wrestling a bear to get the wheel to turn even an inch. Seems the way the steering assist is made its really required, and when it dropped out it as sudden with absolutely no warning. Turning the car off and then on again made the error go away and then it was ok again."

Ford,3a65kq,Dinahmoe,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:58:58 2015 UTC,How is it different? I'm just trying to figure out if my car was repainted or not.
Ford,3a65kq,Dinahmoe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"Good paint work should be hard to tell. Look at mask points, inside edges, peel up rubber. You are looking for overspray and hard or soft edges. The lincoln I just painted was painted at the factory twice for some reason, that happens. I've marked each layer from bare steel to top coat. I know it wasn't repainted after delivery because there are no signs of anything being removed, no tape lines or overspray, it was double painted at the factory.  The factory paint is not hardened and dries via baking in ovens at around 400 degrees, or did when my father painted, I don't know what is going on now, likely the same. The paint we use in repair dries via catalyzation, the paint is very expensive, this cost $120.  It is mixed 4 parts clear, one part hardener, one part reducer, so one gallon of clear makes 1.5 gallons of sprayable material. It can either air dry or can be forced dry in a booth at around 250 degrees."

Ford,3a6tlv,pvera,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:07:43 2015 UTC,"All car companies spend millions of dollars on market research and customer clinics. They are building what people want to buy. Most of the enthusiast models that you have available for purchase are out there because either:   The car company knows there's a demand, people want to buy them and they are willing to pay a premium for the performance. or The company feels that it is an educated bet to sell so many copies of that one model at a loss because the car will improve the public's perception of the brand and/or it can be used just to draw people into the dealership.    Some car companies do listen to their customers. Porsche customers kept bitching and moaning about how certain top models could only be purchased with PDK, so what did Porsche do? The Cayman GT4 broke the trend, and Porsche has hinted that it could happen again.  And Ford is bringing the RS to the states, a car people have demanded for years. They are not bringing it out of the goodness of their hearts, they are bringing it because they know they are going to make a killing.   BTW, if you are old enough, you may remember that the Mustang was almost murdered and replaced by what eventually became the Ford Probe. Guess who ""helped"" Ford change their minds about the move. It wasn't a spreadsheet..."

Ford,3a3ugq,bassmatty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:12:23 2015 UTC,+1 for the piano wire or fishing line.  Also using a hair dryer or heat gun help to soften the adhesive as well.  Don't hold it in the same spot for any length of time.  Move it around the area to warm up the 2 way tape/adhesive.  Get the line in behind it and keep it as taught as possible and try to pull towards yourself.  Reheat if necessary to keep adhesive soft.

Ford,39i2ar,GuinnessTheDog,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"I just performed the livernois cam phaser lockout kit on my 2005 F-150.  Some people on here say ignore it, but I personally don't think that's a good idea.  If the cam phaser fails, or doesn't return after being adjusted during normal engine running, it cam make your timing chain loose and potentially skip a tooth on the bottom timing gear.  This then causes one bank of the engine to be off time, and as you know, the 5.4 is an interference motor, thus, by by valves.  While its not a common failure, I did have it happen to a co-worker.  In the long run, $700 for the lockout kit is cheaper than a $2000 valve job.    On another note, the lockout kit does elminate the variable valve timing, but the livernois kit comes with a tuner to help remedy the potential loss in power.  Since installing the kit on my truck a month ago, I've notice better throttle response, and little to no loss in power and efficiency. Just my two cents!"

I agree that the Focus is sa lot more spacious and practical than the Fiesta, I just needed a second car to our focus as my wife and I work in different places and would have loved the the FiST if it were 5 door!"
Ford,39cuqq,user079,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:33:34 2015 UTC,"No pardon at all. Knowledge is shared! NA or naturally aspirated engines have intakes that draw natural atmosphere temperature and pressure into the intake manifold. The ST line of hatchbacks ford sells are turbocharged (at least here in the U.S.) which forces air into the intake, creating higher pressures in the engine, typically generating more torque and horsepower than na. In my opinion having 5 doors on a car so small is rather useless. I'm 5'8"" and can not fit in the rear of a fiesta. I just feel like a coupe would be more welcome. Just I would have bought the FiST had I had access to a coupe but that's just person opinion. Happy FiSTing!!!!  Edit: the fiesta ST is significantly less expensive than the focus ST, with a limited budget I chose the larger focus"

Ford,39fvfi,TypeK_414,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:04:56 2015 UTC,Thank you! Have you used the service Before? Is it worth it?
Ford,39fvfi,TypeK_414,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"I use it in my Focus. I think it's worth it because I can voice-activate the navigation instead of fumbling around on my phone, especially for unexpected closures and things like that. It relies on Bing Maps to look up businesses,  which sometimes has trouble finding obscure ones. However, you can speak to a live operator 10 times a year. I've done it once and they were polite and fast. If you have MyFord Touch,  you'll see a map on your screen. If you just have regular MyFord without a touchscreen, you'll see a directional arrow and street name when it's time to turn. Unlike regular GPS, if you deviate from the course, Sync will need to use your phone to dial Sync Services again to update your route. However, if you pull off the route and back onto it, such as for gas or food, you don't need to update the route. It will use your phone to dial a toll-free number to download your route. It takes about two minutes; it doesn't stay connected the entire time you drive.   Sync Services also includes voice-activated access to news, weather, and sports information. In my opinion, it's too cumbersome and gimmicky. I might use it if I travel out of state though.   Overall, I think it's worth the $60 for a year of navigation. When I was buying my Focus, I watched some YouTube videos demonstrating the features. I'd link you, but I'm on mobile in a quiet office."

In my case i had few issues i corrected such as: blown timing tensioner gaskets, broken timing chain guide and when i went to do the spark plugs i broke 3 (do research before you change plugs). It still has a tick but is still a strong running engine. Now one thing about the transmission, change the fluid and filter. Dont do that fluid exchange because its not worth it imo. I didnt bother clicking the link but i have 180k miles in my truck and i had a converter shudder. As soon as i replaced the filter and fluid it went away but not before the damage was done.

Ford,39c45z,I_CUM_BACON,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:35:33 2015 UTC,Alright.   What do you think of that particular truck? Does it look like a decent deal?
Ford,39c45z,djfatman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"Seems a bit overpriced given the age. Looks to be in good shape but you may be better off buying from a private party. If it were me, I might be willing to do 6-7k for it if there were no issues. Depending on your needs, you may want to check out Rangers as well."
Ford,39c45z,The_Big_Deal,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:50:04 2015 UTC,I was originally looking at the rangers but nothing decent in my price range came up.
Ford,39c45z,djfatman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:37:09 2015 UTC,Check craigslist. They'll have a ton of rangers and f150s for cheaper than a dealer. Be wary of the 3.0 V6 in the ranger. That's the one that tends to have problems. The 2.3 and 4.0 are pretty bullet proof.
Ford,39c45z,The_Big_Deal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:25:59 2015 UTC,Problem is I'm probably going to have to finance. I can't afford to buy outright.

Ford,39dbn7,Mickydub,2,Thu Jun 11 00:19:30 2015 UTC,In the US there are lemon laws that (varies by state) after so many attempts to fix (or time in shop) they have to buy it back. Do you have any attorney friends you could ask? Otherwise Google lemon laws for your area. Also ask to be put in touch with the regional manager next time you go to the dealer.

Ford,39dbn7,nikkistl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a bad CV joint. Take it to another mechanic shop, or buy the parts and fix it yourself over a few days and it shouldn't be too hard"

Ford,396ock,Spiech,2,Tue Jun 9 22:41:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, I didn't know about retrofitting at the time that I got them. They are projector lamps by Spyder Auto with HID bulbs swapped into them."

Ford,399i8p,elguapojefe,2,Wed Jun 10 05:47:25 2015 UTC,"Lean bank 1 bank 2 means thats it's either Maf, vacuum leak, VCT or not enough fuel. Ignition coils would only have helped if you had a misfire. I have never had any luck with super coil. I find they last about 6 months. But I understand trying to escape the price of the Ford parts. Need to have your mechanic check the maf barometer to make sure its within range for your altitude. If its a 4.6 I've seen cracked intake manifolds. Smoke test would prove this. Otherwise fuel pressure (filter change?), and check the maf. Also aftermarket intakes have thrown these codes. Not sure if aftermarket scanners have the ability to watch all of Ford's parameters.  Edit: P1000 just means the codes have been cleared recently."
Ford,399i8p,Crudezx2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:51:07 2015 UTC,I'm going to check the MAF tonight. It's the 5.4 so hopefully it its the intake manifold. Replaced the coils because I got 8 of them for $80 bucks and it was something to do. Aftermarket filter is a bit dirty I'll get in that.
Ford,399i8p,Crudezx2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"Aftermarket filter could also be the issue. If it has bends in the paper, sometimes looks like wavy paper that could be issue aswell. I've replace a dozen valvoline air filters throwing check engine lights because they bend open. Most ford filters now have a metal screen on the backside to prevent that. Although im not sure if the 5.4 has the metal."
Ford,399i8p,Crudezx2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:53:48 2015 UTC,Do not replace o2 sensors. If it was an o2 sensor it would only be lean or rich on one bank not both.
Ford,39bspj,TaylorBateman,6,Wed Jun 10 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"You could just be getting shafted by the dealership, not so much the company itself. I know you want to point an angry finger at a big company that is more likely to respond with PR than a small dealership that will fight back, but you need to list out everything you've had to replace, get the worksheets from the service department on everything, and call/email/Facebook/Twitter Ford until you get some answers.  They make millions of vehicles every year and there will be a bad egg or two in the group, that is always the case for every company and it always will be as long as it is designed by an imperfect human."
Ford,39bspj,nomosolo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:12:57 2015 UTC,"This is truth, depending on where you live they're may even be a way to get it bought back as a lemon. There is actual funding set up for people who get lemons."
Ford,39bspj,TheFailTech,8,Wed Jun 10 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"I understand that you're frustrated but it's a three year old vehicle that has been driven. Parts wear out and need to be replaced. That's how life works. No need to bastardize an entire company and all of its products because your vehicle required some inexpensive maintenance. I've owned Fords, Dodges, and Toyotas and the quality of Fords is the reason I only own Fords now."
Ford,39bspj,Bishop21,-6,Wed Jun 10 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"3 years old lmao, everything that needed to be replaced should be COMPLETELY covered if its 3 years old. My subaru WRX was almost 3 years old and never needed a single thing to be replaced. I would be pissed off if i had to pay more than $600 extra in 3 years of owning a car when it should all be warrantied."
Ford,39bspj,dylanisco0l,9,Wed Jun 10 18:36:57 2015 UTC,We don't the mileage We don't know the maintenance that has been performed on it.
Ford,39bspj,TheFailTech,5,Wed Jun 10 20:49:59 2015 UTC,"It’s even further insulting that I was originally quoted almost $400 for replacement and still had to pay $300 as a “deal”.   That's a 25% discount, I wouldn't call it insulting at all.   So it is very interesting that both parts controlled by the system computer have failed. It gives me extreme distrust in Ford’s competence at software programming for their cars. There is even a class action lawsuit regarding these transmissions that are on-going.   Hundreds of parts are controlled by computers on cars. It's probably less likely to have a part not controlled by a computer break.  It's a shame you had a poor experience, but if you've been a Ford family for this long and haven't had any problems, maybe it's an isolated incident or a rotten dealership. And it's not like Ford is the only car company with problems like this."
Ford,39bspj,DaRealHankHill,2,Wed Jun 10 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"That's such a bummer, sorry to hear. I've only owned ford's (not intentional, just how it ended up) I've had my 2nd Gen focus for 9 years and no issues. I hope get the issue taken care of."
Ford,39bspj,shreddievanwhalen,0,Wed Jun 10 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"I've never had any issues with any of the 3 focuses I've driven in past years. I currently drive a 1996 f150 with no issues beyond the normal wear items, and my parents have driven fords for the last 25 years, with my dad having 2 1979 trucks and a 1974 that still runs today. If you're going to steer all of your family and friends away from ford because you got a bad egg or did neglect something, then that seems pretty silly."

Ford,38vwht,elguapojefe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:22:43 2015 UTC,"85,300 miles. I bought it today for $13,490 ""as-is"" dealership.  Everything seems to have checked out. Since the dealership didn't do a vehicle inspection. I took it to a local tire shop to have them do a use car check. They suggested minor route work. Maybe a $500 bill. Sunroof is jacked. (Dealership will close it on Monday) I looked up the cost for the parts online 130 bucks.  Truck is chipped (no clue what that means) aftermarket air intake, bed spray, shell and exhaust.   What are you thoughts on the price and suggestions to make this a long lasting truck."
Ford,38vwht,Nero29gt,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:30:45 2015 UTC,"What I think? I think that the truck is nice, but you must have one leg much longer than the other to get so much lean in a photograph."

Ford,38qpgv,Awake00,2,Sat Jun 6 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"Nice looking ride!    Did you look at the FiST at all?  And if so, why'd you go with the FoST over the FiST?  Reason I ask is I need something that does better than the ≈10mpg I get in my Jeep.."
Ford,38qpgv,TexMarshfellow,2,Sat Jun 6 06:27:09 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I went with the Focus because the inside is not as cramped and the 2.0L sounds better and has an easier time making power.  If you're really focused on mpg, the FiST will definitely get better mileage. I drive mostly city (not shy about getting into boost) and I get a consistent 22.3 mpg with my Focus ST."
Ford,38qpgv,AvastYeUpboat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:17:29 2015 UTC,i wish my fist was as efficient as some of the people led me to believe. 25 mpg city and 29-31 highway (~75 mph)  ... too much fun has to be had with that engine note at high revs :)
Ford,38qpgv,BossPat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:43:58 2015 UTC,"To follow up the FiST actually drives a little better if you're into doing sportier driving; I had a customer from the Netherlands and he informed they actually mod and race them there!  But yes, the Focus definitely has more room."
Ford,38qpgv,slap_n_giggle,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks for the info.  I'm not super focused (lol) on mileage—both the FoST or FiST would be a huge improvement over what I drive now—I just need something that gets double digits on a regular basis.  I like the looks of the FiST a bit better (something about the FoST back end seems a little off to me), but I think coming from a lifted Jeep I'd be a bit uncomfortable in such a tiny car so low to the ground.  And I'd like to have some space inside as well as a usable backseat, so I think the Focus is probably a better choice for me."
Ford,38qpgv,TexMarshfellow,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:45:51 2015 UTC,That's what I kinda wanted at first but my girlfriend has a fiesta and I didn't want the same car as her. She just has a se though. Also the size was a little better and was way easier to locate this car.
Ford,38qpgv,TexMarshfellow,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:33:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input!  I do like the additional size of the Focus; the Fiesta seems so small.  Unfortunately, I've got the reverse situation—there are a few FiSTs in my area but no FoSTs unless I go all the way out to Houston."
Ford,38qpgv,TexMarshfellow,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:47:25 2015 UTC,No problem. And I saw you said the fiesta being low to the ground but in the car it feels kind of high. With the seat placement. But sit in the recaro seats if you can before you buy it. The seats in the fiesta are very tight my back didn't fit in them well.

Ford,38rlof,bshift1,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:24:57 2015 UTC,"The focus has a dry double clutch and acts a lot like a manual transmission. The noise you might be hearing is the gears going from the high to low in rapid secession as you coast to a stop. The noise isn't regular and can be hard to duplicate. A lot of people think there is something wrong but it is working just fine. There is a silent recall for people that are experiencing issues with there transmission that are out of spec. The recall changes some of the gearing, gaskets and shift points.   If you feel like it isn't operating properly set an appointment with your dealer."

Like you pointed out, the light outlets seem to be bolted to some sort of hitch/plate behind the bumper  I can't imagine why they'd have 2 identical connectors. I have 2 on my truck but one is a 4-pin and one is a 7-pin for different hookups (one for electric brakes, one without) those both look like 7 pin canisters, though I'm not even sure if they use the same connections over there"

Ford,38k522,EggsNbeans,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:21:24 2015 UTC,"A towbar is meant to be for hitching a trailer, yes, and for a lot of cars it's an aftermarket thing. In this case it could be broken or the view of the actual hitch could be obscured by those 2 outlets it has, hard to tell."
Ford,38k522,automv,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:25:14 2015 UTC,"I still don't know exactly what part you're referring to when you say 'towbar'  Normally, there is a hitch connected to the frame of the vehicle, with a receiver, the square female tube that would stick out under the bumper. Then you plug the draw bar into the receiver and the ball mounts on the draw bar.   Obviously what we see in the picture could not be used to latch a trailer tongue to, there's no ball (and there's no pintle hitch for that matter either, not that you'd see one on a car like this usually), whatever it is, isn't even centered.   Another idea I've had looking at it more, the bolts are actually not what is holding it to anything, the bolts are in the bracket itself, and the bracket containing these 2 things, is actually the draw bar itself and plugged into the receiver like one of these, irrelevant, but same idea.  But in that case, if this thing is occupying the receiver, it can't be used while towing, because then  there is no place for the draw bar and ball mount, I'm lost"

Ford,38cj9f,GryphonGuitar,3,Wed Jun 3 09:53:14 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. I got a hybrid because it felt really high-tech when I rented one; plus, I thought I'd reached an age where I didn't care about horsepower.

Ford,38cj9f,Upward_Spiral,5,Wed Jun 3 12:19:50 2015 UTC,"My best friend bought a hybrid and kept it for a year, but soon regretted his decision. He was enamored by the 40 mpg rating, but soon tired of the numb steering and the appliance look. He sold his Prius when gas prices were above $4 per gallon and got a good price for it. His Mustang gets like 17 mpg, but he is a happier guy for it."
Ford,38cj9f,Upward_Spiral,2,Wed Jun 3 12:54:42 2015 UTC,I bought mine when gas was above $4 per gallon. Then it dropped to half that. I don't completely regret the decision because I actually love the car. The Fusion is a great vehicle and it's a comfortable drive. It was the smarter decision.

Ford,38groy,AJRiddle,2,Thu Jun 4 02:40:39 2015 UTC,"That's normal. Under light/normal braking the actual brakes at the wheels aren't in use, and the electric motor is used to slow the vehicle down. Will be more noticeable with the windows down, or the heater/radio are off. It's coming from the engine bay so it may sound like it's behind the gauge cluster from the driver's seat."
Ford,38groy,TrikeKid,-1,Thu Jun 4 03:26:59 2015 UTC,If that is normal that is very embarrassing for ford. I've driven several hybrids from several makes and none of them make any noise while braking with the electrical motor.
Ford,38groy,TrikeKid,5,Thu Jun 4 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"It's their first hybrid, by far not their most polished examples. The mechanical noise in that model line as a whole are pretty pronounced. Almost every hybrid I've ever driven made some degree of electrical noise regardless of make though. The new Energi models are by far the most polished/quietest hybrid I've driven regardless of make.  That does of course assume that you're not simply hitting the pedal hard enough to begin to engage the actual service brakes that very well may need replacement on an 09, without hearing the noise first hand it's hard to tell but the hybrid system in the Escape isn't exactly silent."

I'm in FL so it's hot here. Dries quick.  Also, my manager took my advice on a more thorough approach that's performed by some other dealers which is to take it to a body shop.

Ford,383evl,nikkistl,3,Mon Jun 1 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"Would taking you key out of your picket fix this ""problem""  Being in Florida I'd love to have this feature in my 09 edge"
Ford,383evl,hatmantc,2,Mon Jun 1 16:36:06 2015 UTC,You can turn this feature off through your menu.  On my fusion at least.
Ford,383evl,OldSpaceChaos,2,Tue Jun 2 03:58:19 2015 UTC,guessing that cmax is the only current car you have ever driven. go drive any other modern or with in the last 3 year cars. they all almost do it.

He had a Lincoln MkX this year, that in the middle of the night, DURING A FUCKING BLIZZARD decided to roll its own windows down.  He was PISSED that the feature came pre-enabled from the factory."
Ford,383evl,biglightbt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:01:51 2015 UTC,You can open the windows by squeezing the keychain?
Ford,383evl,mmiller1188,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:26:56 2015 UTC,Pressing the unlock button once then holding it for about 10 seconds tells all of the windows to roll down at the same time. Super annoying and super pointless.
Ford,383evl,droid6,0,Mon Jun 1 19:40:33 2015 UTC,Don't leave the keys in your pocket.
Ford,383evl,L_C99,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:40:37 2015 UTC,That feature can be disabled but you may need to take it to the dealer to get it done.
Ford,383evl,TrikeKid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:22:15 2015 UTC,IIRC it can be done on the in-dash menu.
Ford,383evl,Solex159,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:57:51 2015 UTC,Haha I'm jealous. I'd like to able to roll my windows down from a distance. On my Vw I have to put the key in the door and turn it
