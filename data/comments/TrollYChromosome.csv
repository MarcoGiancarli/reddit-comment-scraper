TrollYChromosome,3e14zd,arcticsilence,5,Tue Jul 21 12:20:58 2015 UTC,Those posts are the equivalent of those old school chain emails where you have to scroll forever to get to the bottom and if you don't forward to all of your friends you've now doomed your mother for eternal damnation.
TrollYChromosome,3e14zd,zombreness,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:42 2015 UTC,"Rant time!  A lot of people don't realize that Facebook uses a fancy ass algorithm that is colloquially known as EdgeRank (rumor has it they haven't actually used this term for years and it's grown infinitely more complex but you get the idea.) And since your News Feed auto-defaults to ""Top Stories"" no matter how many times you change it to ""Most Recent"", chances are very good that your not going to see every post friends/pages make unless you are constantly adjusting how stories are displayed. This is also why your News Feed generally looks like why it was done by some kind of time traveller (4 minutes ago, 10 hours ago, Yesterday, 6 minutes ago, etc.)   So you might be asking yourself ""Well DumbApple, why do I keep seeing these stupid ass images?"" Well, it's because 1. it's usually done by Dear Aunt Sally, 2. it's been shared a bajillion times by people like Dear Aunt Sally (who you are likely to be friends with, like Dear Uncle Bob), 3. It's an image (which has a higher edge rank than plain text) 4. they usually say something sappy with it anyways, and probably half a dozen other 'mystery meat' that Facebook uses to decide what relevant to you. Also why you sometimes get shown things that a friend of yours was tagged in even though you don't actually know the person who posted it.   tl;dr - Sometimes you don't repost/comment/like something because you honestly didn't see it. Or because it was a shit post. Whichever. :P   P.S. Marketing people are constantly looking for ways to influence edge rank - posting just the right amount of content so Facebook doesn't think you're being 'spammy', using certain words/phrases or content types (videos > pictures > posts) and encourage people to interact with it (like, comment share)."

You shouldn't feel like you ""should"" or ""have"" to have sex a certain way. A lot of guys are very quiet and have a hard time making noise, it's super normal.

TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,25__,42,Mon Jul 20 19:38:32 2015 UTC,Yeah when a girl says that it really means she's just not ready for a relationship with you.
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,NorthtoYukon,32,Mon Jul 20 20:27:35 2015 UTC,I understand.  I wish she was more upfront about it.  I am sad.
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,the_girl,23,Mon Jul 20 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"honest question: what would you prefer she said?  I've said the ""not ready for a relationship"" line before, and it was because I simply wasn't attracted to the guy. He was kind and sweet and funny and good-looking, but I just wasn't sexually attracted to him. Should I have said that?"
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,Cyb3rSab3r,14,Mon Jul 20 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"Had a girl just say ""No but thank you"" once.  That's my favorite rejection.  Although it made me like her more it made it easier to accept it."

TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,hvelsveg_himins,6,Tue Jul 21 02:42:48 2015 UTC,I suppose I would have been angry if she said she wasn't attracted to me. But it would have been the truth. This is a good question.
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,katorulestheworld,23,Mon Jul 20 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"The fact that you went with ""angry"" when describing your potential reaction should tell you something about why people might choose the softer let-down.

TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,geekosopher,8,Tue Jul 21 08:28:44 2015 UTC,Yeah... I'm gonna go ahead and hope that just didn't come out right.
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,katorulestheworld,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:10:54 2015 UTC,"Just because you're angry doesn't mean you take it out on the other person. It's perfectly acceptable to be angry when rejected, however that rejection is performed, but it's never ok to take those feelings out on that person. You go do something furious away from the other person... like cry, exercise, masturbate, or binge drink. (Or all three at the same time). Last part is a joke, but I think this is what most people don't seem to get. You can't control your emotions, you can control how you react to them. If you try to not be angry or sad or embarrassed, you're just going to be frustrated at your inability to control your emotions and act out more, potentially doing even more harm."
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,geekosopher,5,Tue Jul 21 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"Its not a normal reaction at all. Anger at being rejected implies the person had no right to do so, they owed you, you earned it, you deserve it, how dare they.  Its okay to be disappointed, upset, rejected, hurt, lonely, unhappy. Anger is not okay. Anger is what leads to violence. Anger is why women dont feel they can tell the truth and have to say ""you're a nice but"". Anger is why they have to lie so you dont turn violent.  If you're angry someone doesnt fancy you, I suggest you need help."
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,katorulestheworld,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:16 2015 UTC,"Anger at being rejected implies the person had no right to do so, they owed you, you earned it, you deserve it, how dare they   You are making huge assumptions about what others' anger means. Not all anger is the same. Not all anger is deep bitter anger. Some of it is, and yes, that often does require some help. However, I get angry when I stub my toe... that doesn't mean I think the coffee table owes me something or any of that other stuff you are assuming about the angry person who was rejected. Sometimes anger is just a natural reaction to things not going your way. Still, again, the important part is that I don't throw the coffee table or tell off the girl, instead you deal with the anger in healthy ways removed from what caused the anger. (The drinking, etc. aren't healthy ways, just a joke)"
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,geekosopher,5,Tue Jul 21 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"Lol - for a child ""anger is just a natural reaction to things not going your way"" - for a adult its not.  If I turn a bloke down, and he gets angry - it is in my interest to assume the worst. He is 2 or 3 times the size and strength of me. I am at the mercy of his ability to control this ""anger"". So yeah, if I see him visibly get angry, start shouting, use aggressive mannerisms, scream at me for an explanation or punch a fucking wall - I am getting the fuck out of there.  And anyone, anyone who displays such a immature and selfish inability to control themselves is someone I will go out out of my way to avoid in future. Do you know why? because misinterpretating this guy's ""feels"" could be the fucking difference between life and death for me."
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,Queen_of_Reposts,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"Woah. I totally agree. I react that way too when people act that way. I think somehow we got confused. Let me try to explain more carefully. It's ok to have the emotion anger, just the emotion but not the reactions to it. ""visibly get angry, start shouting, use aggressive mannerisms, scream at me for an explanation or punch a fucking wall"" - None of that is even remotely acceptable as a reaction to your anger. Feeling anger, that feeling but not the reaction to it, is ok. See the difference?  The difference between a child and an adult isn't that the adult never gets angry, it's that the adult doesn't throw a tantrum when they get angry.   Let me give you an example. I ask a girl out on a third date after two pretty good (from my perspective) dates. She says, ""I'm sorry, you're a great guy, but I'm just not feeling it."" I feel frustration, sadness, and a little bit of anger. Feeling that anger, I know it's not a good idea to stick around. So I say, ""Oh, ok,"" and I leave. When I get home I sulk a little, take a shower, and cool off until that anger goes away. The depression and frustration might last a few days, but anger is an emotion that generally doesn't last very long. This is all I meant."
TrollYChromosome,3dzdt1,sassless,7,Tue Jul 21 14:44:30 2015 UTC,I would have been angry   Which is probably what she already knew and opted for being a liar instead of being sucker punched or worse on the spot.

If we don't, we become a slut/bitch/friend zoning lesbian, etc.   Its not ideal for anyone, that women can't be frank about lack of interest but its usually a defensive tactic. Some men will take offense to you directly saying you don't want them (not implying you would). That offense can lead to insults, or worse.   Of course the other end of not being direct turns us into lying harpies who lead men on. No one ""wins"".  Still, I'm sure you'll meet a girl who is interested in you, that you like as well :)"

I mean, you could say that, but I feel like that might blow your chance at banging.  I'm just confused as to how the process of flirting and getting a number works amongst gays.

Bisexuality classically referred to attraction to both sexes--and when trans awareness became a thing, pansexuality arose to combat the perceived binary language of Bisexual. (Bi meaning two and Pan meaning all.)  Now, many people who identify as bi will tell you that they're not excluding anyone in their attraction, and that despite what the word implies, that's not what it means.  Other bisexual folks will tell you that Bisexuality has always indicated attraction to your sex(/gender), as well as others, which is where the ""bi"" prefix comes from.  I identify as pansexual because I like the way it explicitly includes non-binary identities (and frankly androgyny is reeeeeeally hot, IMO).  I'm not going to argue against those who will say that Bisexuality is also explicitly inclusive (attraction to your sex and others)--I just know what I prefer and what makes me feel good.  And I've met a couple of those rare bi people who are NOT inclusive in their attraction.  Really, all of these versions of bi/pan identities make sense to me.  I just wish everyone would get along. =\"

TrollYChromosome,3drj2c,dumbpostthrowaway,86,Sat Jul 18 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"I'm married, but most of my friends have kids. I think it's similar.   For example I just remembered that my wife is going out for a girls' night. If I call my married friends they're gonna make me feel guilty for not telling them in advance (totally not their fault, I'll just feel bad when they say they can't come).  But my single bros... I know a couple of them that will be here in 20 minutes with a 6 pack and we're gonna play some vidya on my new TV.  Single bros out there, you're dope as shit and a critical part of married dudes' social lives. We love you."
TrollYChromosome,3drj2c,solidus-flux,75,Sat Jul 18 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's similar, but for a single guy it goes deeper than that.  When your friend gets into a serious relationship, then let's face it, in one way or another you're always kind of secondary. Their SO is now the most important person in their life. And that's fine! They're good friends, so I'm happy for them, and chances are I can be friends with their girlfriends/boyfriends as well.  But, I'm still secondary. We still hang out, but you notice that over time hanging out with them isn't the spontaneous and on-the-fly thing it used to be. Instead, you need to be worked into their life ahead of time.  It's not just about scheduling, though. Just like I am now not quite as much a part of their life, I have to scale down how much a part of my life they are. I need to lower my expectations of what I can get out of that friendship.  And when this seems to be happening with all your friends, well, it's exhausting. You risk becoming the secondary character in your own life, the best friend trope from every romcom. Maybe a friend wants to hang out spur of the moment, and I'll be ready to roll in minutes, but afterwards they'll go back home to someone and I'm stuck waiting in the wings."

So I ended up spending a lot of my time with this other guy who quickly became my best bud. But then, the first and second friend starting hanging out with each other, and because I couldn't bring myself to be around the first guy, I was automatically cut out of any social plans my new best friend made with him.   In my case I did it to myself, and I knew I was doing it to myself, but it still sucked to be excluded."

I met this girl in the lunch line and was immediately smitten. I was teasing her to aggravate a mutual friend and her response, to that friend, was, ""Can you please get this girl the fuck away from me?""  She dated a dude I knew, then fooled around with a girl we were friends with who ended up basically cheating on her. I was her best friend through all of it, and even when I announced my feelings we remained good friends.  We started dating my sophomore year and I was pretty clearly a rebound from the awful girl. I was fine with that as it was at least a chance.  Fast forward 5 year. We've been married for seven months and we are both college students doing well and we will be having our first baby within the next 18 months to 2 years.

Mr Noodle states to use 2 cups of water. 1 cup = 236.588ml therefore its requirement is 473.176ml of water.  What you really need to do it is run the tap for 473.176ml/166ml/s = 2.85 seconds.  Therefore the optimal length of time your tap should be on is approximately 2.85s.

TrollYChromosome,3dmgj9,Doublestack2376,13,Sat Jul 18 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"And how many liberal arts majors work as baristas?  I'm not arguing that the culinary industry is a very lucrative one for most workers, or that there aren't a lot of predatory culinary schools out there that aren't worth a shit. In fact a culinary degree is not in any way necessary to be successful, but it can be a great leg up, and fast forward your career if you put in the work.    The culinary industry is as close to a meritocracy as you are going to find, it's 90% effort and hard work.  Culinary school will give someone a very wide knowledge base about cooking methods, the chemistry of cooking, background of regional dishes around the world, and a bit about the administrative side of running a kitchen.   It all means dick when starting out in the industry without real experience.    So basically what I'm saying is just that it's not really fair for you to make that sweeping judgment from such a limited viewpoint.  Lazy burnouts are probably going to have menial jobs no matter what type of degree they are able to scrape by on."

TrollYChromosome,3dmgj9,Dildorthemagnificent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"Close. While I was pursuing my BA (on a scholarship) trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, I was cooking in restaurants. I realized I wanted to be a chef. So I dropped out and went to culinary school. 8 years later, I've traveled, I own my own home,  drive an early 80s Mercedes, get mad pussy and have ZERO debt.  And I've never set foot in a corporate kitchen, So...yeah I'm happy with the choices I've made.  Anything is possible if you want it bad enough. But you seem like an angry bitter little person. Truth is, you probably couldn't hack it in a kitchen."
TrollYChromosome,3dmgj9,UrbanToreador,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:30:45 2015 UTC,Nah man not bitter here's the deal. I don't know a single starry eyed kid who wasn't screwed by culinary. I have a buddy took out $50k in loans the school facilitated of course. He's so damn poor he hasn't paid a single dime back and hadn't gotten a tax return in 7 years. That's how they get their money when you default. He's so poor with two kids. He would be getting like $6500 back. He's getting zilch for probably ever.   There are no chef jobs. There just aren't. In the southeast there are $12-15 hour cook and cleaner jobs. Unless you own the restaurant or have a rich buddy opening a new restaurant then there are no chefs.   Even if a restaurant decided to call you chef they aren't paying you more than $15 an hour 35 hours a week.   $50k for a two year culinary degree is a ripoff and the courts agree.   http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/950107

TrollYChromosome,3dhtb9,Davillamaster,10,Thu Jul 16 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"No, that's not how toilets work. The exit end of a toilet is almost p/s-shaped. When a bit of water, piss, shit, whatever is added to the bowl, the water level rises and a bit of water trickles over the edge of the top of this pipe and makes it way out with the rest of the plumbing. When enough water is added quickly (a flush), the water quickly fills the entire pipe causing a syphon. This syphon takes everything with it until it pulls enough  air to break the syphon and the bowl fills back up again.   Pour water into your toilet a cup at a time until you're blue in the face, the water level will never reach the top."

And explain what the consequences will be if they don't improve. Then, most importantly, give them enough space to do it. People get nervous with the boss breathing down their neck, especially if they've just been told they're not up to snuff.   Nobody has to be a ""bad cop"" to get a message across.

In the real world it's the International Monetary Fund, an organization which has been lauded as an economic giant in the first world but has screwed over impoverished countries and supported dictatorships for years.  Most recently, they proposed an economic recovery plan for Greece which meant that all decisions made by the Greek federal government had to be approved by them before being enacted, essentially handing over all power to the IMF and nullifying Greece's democracy."

TrollYChromosome,3cyyyn,HardDifficulty,6,Sun Jul 12 07:16:02 2015 UTC,Streaming and downloading is the same thing from a technical standpoint. When streaming the movie is simply downloaded into your browsers cache (which resides on your hard disk) and will be deleted or not depending on your browser settings.  In the old ages when there were no addons or websites to rip youtube videos one would simply copy and rename the correct file from his browser cache to get the video.
TrollYChromosome,3cyyyn,Reddisaurusrekts,2,Sun Jul 12 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"IANAL...The trouble with Streaming is that it is rarely easy to determine (at least from a law standpoint) whether a piece of media was uploaded illegally or not. It turns out it's a really bad idea to start setting precedent against an end user. This is why torrents are different from streaming. The end user is also a supplier in these cases and fit in past caselaw.  On 5 June 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that streaming illegal content online is legal in Europe. [wiki]. As a base level report of the relevant case: [see here]"

It's almost worse than a drug, and it's always been like that. But I have friends that are they same way. And helps if you have other people to do your hobby with you. So I'd suggest seeing what some of your close friends do in their spare time. Maybe try some of those things."

I love tinkering with my computer, and some of the stuff I learn at work really helps with it.  If I could make the kind of money I'd like to make just taking computers apart and Frankensteining them together, that would be a pretty significant temptation.  But for you, I'd say to just try a bunch of things and feel them out, see how they resonate with you. Go to the shooting range. Take an art class. Go to the music store and have someone show you a few different instruments. Maybe sit down and try to write a short story. See what clicks."
TrollYChromosome,3cwwp5,BadReynolds,3,Sat Jul 11 15:24:10 2015 UTC,Buy a plant. Don't let that green fucker die.  It seriously starts as a challenge and then you you realize gardening is goddamn wonderful.

Try it out, see if you like it. If not, check it off your list and try something else. If you do, BOOM. New hobby."
TrollYChromosome,3cwwp5,Tresmil,2,Sat Jul 11 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"I have three main hobbies that I spend the most time thinking about and spend the most money on.  Video games, movies, and Legos. I've always played video games and continue to do so. I play for the stories of single player games and play multiplayer to keep in touch with my dad, brother, and friends I no longer live near. As far as movies, I enjoyed reading books about the making of movies growing up and really enjoy analyzing the technical side of film making and the meaning behind film. I love my Blu Ray collection and actively purchase versions such as the Criterion Collection which are known for their top quality transfers and special features.  However, I am definitely a consumer of these two hobbies, I have no interest in making my own film or game, I am content to consume this content and discuss it.   My main hobby is Lego, which is the one most people are surprised about. I played with them as a kid and stopped in high school and most of college. I always was aware of what was going on in the Lego world as far as new products. That changed when my girlfriend bought me an X Wing fighter for Christmas. After that I was hooked. I hunted down Craigslist lots, clearance deals, I followed expert builders online,I studied techniques, I bought books on architecture and vehicles for inspiration.  I've only now gotten to the point where I have enough pieces to start getting serious, but my desire to keep building better stuff has not diminished. I've rambled for a paragraph and I'm sure you'll find something that will get you just as excited.   In hindsight, all of these things are an evolution of something I enjoyed as a child. Sure there are other activities I like to do, but the time and money spent does not compare. What did you enjoy as a child? If it was running around outside and playing games, find a sports league. Cycling could be a hobby or it could sound like the worst thing on the planet. You may be into gardening or stargazing, you never know until you try it.  Just try things and see what you enjoy."
TrollYChromosome,3cwwp5,Brotein_Shake,2,Sat Jul 11 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"I like building Warhammer Warmahordes models (fuck Age of Sigmar, fuck GW), I like painting them, and I like building, upgrading and repairing my own computer.  I don't really know how I ""got into them"", per se. I just come across things that sound fun, and if I have the money and time, I do them. Those are the two that have stuck. Both of them let me be creative to some extent and work with my hands, so I guess that's the common factor, really. I just find things that look fun, require me to learn something new, and leave me with something cool when I'm done (a sweet gaming rig, or a fancy plastic army man)."
TrollYChromosome,3cwwp5,Yo-S-I,2,Sat Jul 11 23:45:02 2015 UTC,I make videos about videogames on Youtube.  I did it once because I thought it'd be fun.  It was way more fun than I thought it'd be.

Seeing then play that song just blew my mind. For lack of a better word it was just so fucking cool! The way they wear there guitars, how they move, there sound, all of it.   So for a year I begged for a guitar and on Christmas day 2005 I got it. Ten years later I've got a closet full of guitars and music equipment. I play something every day even if it's just strumming a few chords while lounging around watching t.v.  I taught my self how to play and even branched out to drums bass piano and other instrument. Music won't make me famous but it is about as important to me as food and water. All it takes is getting an instrument and having the drive to practice every day without fail."

TrollYChromosome,3cu0re,applesandcherry,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"Not a fun time. We just had to do a lot of talking. Ultimately, we still get on, it's just that extenuating circumstances mean that it just doesn't make sense to be dating at the moment. Maybe again in the future, but not right now.  In any case, the plan is to limit contact for a while. The break up was relatively recent and we both need some time to heal. But the key thing is we want to be buds again. So once enough time has passed and the hurt fades, we'll slowly start bringing back chatting and such.  Sadly, it isn't an easy fix. But it is a positive plan, which makes me happy. Even if it just means I don't spend 9 hours a day thinking about it all the time."

Being shown is a selection of some of the best sci-fi/action movies produced in the last 30 years (yes, it's really been that long) that also feature women as the main protagonist (or at least co protagonist).  As these are action movies they will include a fair amount of violence, quite graphic at times, and imagery some people may find disturbing.

Pao's history of frivolous lawsuits, her husband stealing pensions, Pao firing a man in the midst of chemotherapy, and her cultivating such a distance between volunteer moderators and official reddit employees that Victoria was gone before anyone knew what was happening.  I don't pretend to know how the tech industry works, but I honestly have no idea how she followed her career trajectory into the position of Reddit's CEO in the first place.  I'm very, very, very glad fathate is gone, but the inconsistent application of forced dispersal of subreddits makes it clear she didn't really understand much of Reddit beyond the surface (because according to her, SRS doesn't brigade?). While I admire her intent, intentions don't mean much if you don't realize them and completely shit the bed in the process."

But it hasn't been denied, and non-disclosure agreements are a thing, and the sudden dismissal of Victoria adds credence to it, in my opinion.  Furthermore, even if it is not WHY he was fired, is it morally okay to fire a man in that situation?"
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,scnavi,72,Wed Jul 8 21:43:36 2015 UTC,I always ask her to keep the tampon in until right before piv. Means I can eat in comfort which really helps with her period pains lol.

TrollYChromosome,3clo48,but_why_is_it_itchy,46,Thu Jul 9 10:54:11 2015 UTC,These things can happen suddenly and without warning. It's not like our uteri are on a schedule set in stone.
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,chocochips,-39,Thu Jul 9 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"It's not set in stone but you should have a general idea of when it will happen unless you have irregular periods frequently.  In which case you should probably see a doctor...    It's inconsiderate to know you might be on your period or its around that time and not let your partner know, thats basically what I'm getting at."
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,Kyuuma,31,Thu Jul 9 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"Hahaha you know what my doctor said? ""It doesn't seem harmful to your health and there's no obvious cause, so just keep an eye on it."" That was ten years ago. Now I'm 23 and am on birth control that eliminates periods, but I feel confident that I'd still be going months without and then getting gully rushers.   I can't warn you if I don't know, your highness."
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,unforgivablecursive,34,Thu Jul 9 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"Right, because if I'm expecting my period within the next 3-5 days, I should really stop in the middle of foreplay to warn him that my period is going to start this week, so be careful. If he's doing his job right, counting days from my last period is the last thing on my mind."
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,chocochips,-26,Thu Jul 9 05:09:22 2015 UTC,"No, you should say something before it gets that far, its your body not his.  My wife when we were dating would let me know if she thought her period was coming, its just being courteous.  Sure now I can tell, but I've been married to her for 16 years so I hope I know.   Just be a courteous human being, thats all anyone can ask for.  Don't assume anything and I can tell you right now if you expect him to count you're in for a rude awakening."
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,Kyuuma,23,Thu Jul 9 05:18:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, just to be clear, I do understand where you're coming from. If a woman is aware that her period is about to start, she should definitely tell her partner about it. However, it's not as though it's something that instantly comes to mind prior to sex if you're not expecting it for another few days. For example, if a woman's cycle is usually 29 days, and today is day 26, she won't be thinking about warning her partner because she's not expecting it quite yet. That being said, it could totally start on day 26 without the usual warning signs such as cramping."
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,chocochips,-21,Thu Jul 9 05:29:15 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying to be be considerate.. I understand it can be unpredictable, the human body is quite the complex machine, but a little courtesy can go a long way imo.    I totally get where you are coming from, there were plenty of times she thought it was clear and bam it appeared.. Our wedding day would be a great example of that heh."
TrollYChromosome,3clo48,Kyuuma,5,Thu Jul 9 05:32:41 2015 UTC,Oh noooooo! That is NOT the kind of surprise that one hopes for on their wedding day.

So maybe you're the type of person who demands a period schedule posted on the bedroom wall, but not every man is like that. Thank god."

The smell of a girl's vagina changes from day to day for reasons that aren't readily apparent to us, so when it smells ""not fresh"" one day we might not think too much of it.

The cathedral is a breathtaking piece of architecture and there's also a roman museum next to it I found quite interesting. If you're interested in outdoor activities you might wanna check out the Rennsteig, a hiking trail in Thuringia of 170km length.  Hamburg is a bit farther away, but you might still want to check it out for a weekend or so.

If you want to do something with your life, you need to start doing that before you're a dad for two reasons.  1: You'll attract a good partner by getting involved in things you're passionate about. Sharing a common passion is a great way to build and sustain relationships.  2: You'll develop yourself better as an individual and if you describe yourself a ""doing nothing with my life"" having something to do with your life will fix that. Having kids (for you) might eventually fill that even more and then you've got cool stories about things you did before them to share with them an inspire them.  Besides, Age is a terrible reason to have kids."

I've had depression since I was in 8th grade so about age 13ish. My parents kinda knew I wasn't completely ok but they had no idea the extent of it, hell I didn't really either. My main problem is I hate things like schoolwork because I'm just fucking lazy about things I hate, it's a poor excuse but it's how it went for me. My family and my teachers all say I'm a very bright but I don't believe them and shit like that. It's relevant because since I never do any of the school work my grades suffered horribly and it caused added stress from my parents because they thought I was just being lazy and didn't care which isn't totally wrong.  So new years morning something in my brain just finally broke right? Something finally hit me and I just wanted to kill my self, i really did. I went into my kitchen and it was like 2 in the morning and I grabbed the sharpest knife we had in the house. It was right next to my throat I could feel it. And I swear this is what happened but believe or don't it's whatever but my hand went numb and I couldn't feel the knife by my neck anymore, I open my eyes and the knife is on the ground. I go to my parents room and they are out cold and I just start crying so hard and I woke up my mom and she wondered what was going on and I explain everything that I've felt the past 5 years which was basically nothing but constant pain and agony for no reason.   So after that night a therapist is recommended to me, I start medication and it got better but worse eventually."

I could honestly tell from a mile away that the dude was a fuckbag, my friend knowing about my feelings thought I was just jealous which granted I was a bit but she's still my best friend so I want her to never get hurt( i know she's a person and has to learn yada yada but I'm protective ok?) We have this huge argument about her and her boyfriend and me. That was the day after the breakdown. So it compounded into just fuck all, I'm not a person who self harms mainly because if I was gonna do it I wouldn't be alive the next day so I avoided it and just punched very sturdy objects.   They continue dating for 6 or 7 months and in that span he cheated on her 3 times or so, one time she knew about the others she found out after they broke up. Like my thing is I feel very empathetic towards people, I can imagine how they feel, I mean I think everyone does tbh and people always ask me well how do you know how it feels when it's never happened to me. I just can feel it I guess, lame but true. So she's in agony basically, she loved this guy and he destroyed her but she still loves him and wants him back and it causes another fight between us.   I don't remember much from that after really its kind of a blur with her, but the girl that I was on off with had come back after disappearing on me for the 2nd time, she said she has cancer, bone cancer to be exact, and after that night she disappeared again and I thought she died, like I did love the girl and since my mind thinks about everything I thought she was lying at the same time to avoid me. Like I do feel like I'm a prisoner in my own mind sometimes due to the extensive thinking of every shitty outcome and I choose not to go through with things. I know I'm not the only person obviously but it doesn't make it such any less."
TrollYChromosome,3cl1tx,In_Medias_Res,3,Wed Jul 8 23:06:57 2015 UTC,Damn dude. That's rough; it's like you guide yourself by this empathy but everyone in your life is taking advantage of it.   It's interesting because you said you don't care about schoolwork but the stress of it lead to a breakdown. It's like you could feel how important it was to your parents/teachers but couldn't change yourself to line up with it.  So now you are at a place where the same force that makes you a considerate person is literally killing you and driving the people you love away.  I think you have a talent for storytelling though. Have you considered making a story out of it?

I mean, you never know if you like something til you try it, but if someone experimented a little bit before proper butt sex and they liked it I think that's a good indication that they'll like the real thing.  Of the women I've done butt stuff with, those who were into it knew they would be beforehand, even if they hadn't done it with a partner before, because they'd experimented with themselves. And those that were unsure but tried it anyway just weren't into it, and they'd either tried it and didn't like it or it was never something that occurred to them to want to do by themselves.

If it makes you unhappy you should tell her you love her but that the relationship isn't working for you and you have incompatible needs.    Just end it amicably.  Decide in advance if that's what you want and end it.   Don't let her be like ""NO Ok, fine I'll do it"" because then you're just accidentally blackmailing her and the problem will get worse over time even if you have sex.   Don't give her a choice or an ultimatim, she made her desires known and now you have to decide if you want the same thing.  If you want to have a girlfriend you have sex with then you should, and neither one of you is a bad person."

My SO is a little different from the women I’ve been with in the past. She’s not as open about her sexual life as I am almost to the point where I think she might be a virgin. Normally this wouldn’t be bad but I don’t find the whole “popping the cherry” very appealing and I wouldn’t want to take it. It just seems like too much for me, and idk I’m fucked up.  I’ve tried bringing up the past relationships to get an idea as to where she stood but that topic got changed because she didn’t really have much to offer. My SO is drop dead gorgeous and very upbeat and happy,   I’m a very lucky guy, but if a comparison would be made, I’d be a nympho and she’d be an innocent angel.

To me, sex is important in relationships because it’s a physical form of love, and I LOVE making my SO feel good and will ALWAYS put their own needs before my own. All I want to do for her is make her more body confident, but I know she’s not ready yet which kind of breaks my heart, She’s so gorgeous and doesn’t show it (by that I mean normal body confidence). I’m a man of incredible patience but I can’t wait forever. I just want her to feel good and proud and get her out of her shell but I just don’t think it’ll happen.  So this is where my problem is, last night while we were “hanging out” basically naked and well, things escalated (romantically). I was at second base making my way to third (my first attempt at it since we’ve started seeing eachother) when she took my hand and moved it elsewhere. This is a clear sign of “no go” which I immediately understood. Our intimacy slowly down afterwards and we just lay there, cuddling is utter silence for the next couple of minutes. It wasn’t awkward but I know her, she stresses over these things and I know she’ll be thinking about it for the next few days. I wish I had asked her what’s wrong but I just didn’t. I just laid there with an awkward boner and a bin full of questions I could have asked. We ended up passing out and she abruptly left later on in the morning, of course I saw her to the door and kissed her goodbye but I could immediately tell something was off.  Anyways, this is where I need your wisdom, what should I tell her? I want to tell her not to worry about it, and if she wants to wait that’s fine, but also I don’t want to sound like an ass. She is very dodgy about the whole topic of sex and I know I’ll have to bring it up in person. I already texted her this morning but no response. Ugggh, guuys I need heeelp."
TrollYChromosome,3ckj5r,punkerdante182,2,Wed Jul 8 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah I saw it afterwards and thought ""ahh fuck it.."". Much appreciated!"
TrollYChromosome,3ckj5r,girlfrodo,2,Wed Jul 8 17:52:11 2015 UTC,So if she's stressing about her sexuality and being intimate with you there might be some sexual abuse in her past. Not assuming just that's an indicator. Was/is she very religious? Is she very open about other topics? The choice is yours to wait or not but you have to walk that line of taking charge of your sexuality while not making her feel guilty about hers. Like someone else said she's not obligated to have sex with you but just as well you're not obligated to stay with her. There's nothing wrong with leaving an unsatisfactory relationship just do it maturely.
TrollYChromosome,3ckj5r,absentbird,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:08 2015 UTC,No nothing of that caliber. She comes from an insanely loving family however she is religious. I think she just simply doesn't feel the same way as I do about sex. Which is fine but it might be a difficult hurdle to overcome
TrollYChromosome,3ckj5r,absentbird,2,Wed Jul 8 19:34:36 2015 UTC,Eh good luck just don't forget you've only been dating 2 months. My brita filter is older than that so don't stress about it........wait should I change my brita filter?

That is significantly higher than I was aware of. Are you sure you aren't mixing numbers? I thought it was 1 in 4 for lifetime abuse and a lower figure for pre 18.

TrollYChromosome,3ckj5r,I_SPEAK_GEEK,2,Wed Jul 8 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"It seems like you are going out of your way to do what you think she wants. When you do this you aren't really in a relationship with her anymore, you are dating the person you think she is.  You should open up to her and let her help. Maybe she should be the one running the bases for a while. It generally feels safer to be the one setting the tempo.  EDIT: She might also just feel unsure of herself. Make sure you let her know what feels good and what you like."
TrollYChromosome,3ckj5r,absentbird,2,Wed Jul 8 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"alright. I'm a lady, but I'm weighing in asap. For the love of God, talk to her about what happened. Text her: ""Hey (insert name), I really want to talk about what happened the other night. I know it's a little uncomfortable, but I really want to make sure we're still okay.""  When you meet in person (DO NOT DO THIS OVER TEXT), start by apologizing for taking things farther than she was comfortable with. Tell her that you love her, that you love her body, and that you want her to feel comfortable and confident in all of your interactions, not just sex. Explain like you did to us that sex is an important part in relationships for you because it's an expression of physical love, and that you are ready to take that next step, BUT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IF SHE IS NOT.  Before you meet with her: determine how long you feel is a good time to wait for sex or if you want to have sex with this girl. If you are afraid of ""being her first"", you should end things because that's unfair to her, especially if she's trying to build up the confidence to have sex with you in the first place. In terms of you, if you don't want to wait X amount of time for sex, be prepared to end it. Furthermore, do not give her an ultimatum... that is not a sexually healthy relationship.  Lastly, make sure that in all of this, you tell her how much you love her and that you want your relationship to be open, honest, and healthy. Tell her that you know this is hard for her and that it's hard for you too. It might be helpful to explain your sexual past without expecting her's in return.   Best of luck!"

Once I was trimming up the hedges, and I still don't know how this happened, but a combination of January shrinkage and the most unfortunate distraction in the history of distractions conspired to cause me to, while lifting my dong out of the way to get underneath, lose grip and let it flop down on my body hair trimmer. Nicked my banjo string. Next thing I know the bathroom looks like a scene from American Psycho. I could swear I was going to bleed out then and there.   Now, because I'm an idiot, I think to myself Hey, I can't really put a bandaid on my frenulum, and in my panic to stop the trauma I reach into my drawer and pull out a styptic pencil. Now, if you've ever used one, you'll know they burn like the bottom ring of hell, and they're normally used to shore up nicks on your face and neck when you get sloppy shaving. I immediately wet it and slap it to my shaft, and then the screaming begins. Holy god, I thought I knew pain. Not like this. It was like being skewered by one of those marrow needles.

Cowboy Bebop: Also one of my firsts and I love every bit of it. May rewatch it when I get a chance. Trigun: Enjoyed it, but it didn't blow me away, especially watching it right after Bebop.  Avatar (Aang and Korra): Really really love. Childhood for Aang, tough grittiness with Korra. Attack on Titan: Almost forgot to include this one! Loved it. The mystery/action is amazing. FMA: Really enjoyed and seems like everything I've read digs it too. Except the movies, kinda meh. Deathnote: I thought it was okay. Nothing shocking or exciting, but I understand the appeal and thought it was clever.  Naruto: Couldn't get into it, I feel it suffers from being longwinded like DB/DBZ without huge character development. Elfen Lied: I thought it was fun, but man everyone hates it on Reddit. I enjoyed the powerset of the Diclonii. Thought Nyu was a slight cop out of some real interesting character interaction though. FLCL: Confusing, nonsensical, and loved every minute. Enjoyed reading some analysis about it. Sword Art Online: Currently watching, I'm really digging it, I'm halfway through episode 14 as I type this!   ...I think thats it"
TrollYChromosome,3chtks,ReferenceError,2,Wed Jul 8 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"Recommendations:  Gurren Lagann is probably up your alley. It's one of those shows that likes to consistently one up itself so it's pretty awesome by the end.  The first season of Psycho Pass is also really good - the second season is still on my watch list so I can't comment on where that goes.  Blood Lad is pretty good too, the manga is still going so hopefully there will be more seasons coming.  Bakemonotagari (along with the rest of them) is also totally worth watching. It can be heavy on the fan service, but they're a fun watch with good dialogue and interesting characters.    FLCL is great, it's one of the shows I use to introduce people to anime when they come looking for a suggestion. It's short, sweet, and eclectic as all hell so it usually seems to be a good one to draw people down the rabbit hole :).  I liked the first season of SAO, but the second season is pretty lame -- that's the fault of the source material though. I haven't watched GGO yet, but the LN telling of it was good. I was glad to see that they'll be making more seasons to follow the rest of the LNs since I read up through the beginning of 'alicization' which felt a whole lot more like the first arc.  Also, there's a new DBZ season that is just starting if you're not aware! I'm waiting for the dub on that one though - I can't stand the Japanese voice actor for Goku."
TrollYChromosome,3chtks,I_SPEAK_GEEK,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:46:30 2015 UTC,"GL/Psycho Pass: Most likely my next ventures, I've heard good things through the grapveine about them. Haven't heard the other two, but I saved your comment so I can remember.  Just finished second season of SAO and as I type this I realize how the writing veered off to the right. I definitely hate how they've declawed Asuna and tried to shoehorn in Sugu, but the action sequences (like the General fight and the ending in the parking lot) I thought were pretty in line with the first season. Too much ex machina than I'd like as well. Started the first episode of GGO last night, so I'll let you know what I think then.  And I know! Same here, I'm waiting for the dub version until I even touch the new DBZ, but I'm hyped for it."

When I was in third grade I had a horrible zipper accident... I was at a Catholic school at the time and I remember having to explain to my teacher why I had to the nurses office. I still very vividly remember a look of horror on her face when I got over being shy about it and just told her. I don't think the nurse really did anything to help though.  Anyways...it was RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF MY DICKHOLE. When it healed over the next few months the skin that healed actually would close off the entire hole itself. For a while there every time I peed, I had to piss through a thinly healed scabby layer of skin covering the entire hole itself. This was especially bad and painful in the morning.  I think this also may have prevented I from really healing and added to the problem because I remember this going on for some time and not being a once or twice deal...but I'm no doctor and I'm pulling that out of my ass.  Skip forward to now, half of my dick hole is covered with skin. Kind of like a half filled in circle, if you will. When I'm not erect or peeing or something it folds up and looks like a little mini vagina at the end of my dock and when I pee it says everywhere and often goes UP. The real issue is that it's hard to fully empty my penis of urine because a little bit gets trapped at the very tip, I'm sure...so I just hope I don't get a uti at some point.

After time passes, and when you are ready, you will find a new love. This might be a romantic love, friendship. passion, or a cause. This love will be different, feel different, but in time you may find that this love is better in some ways, or even every way!   Personal anecdote: Nothing compares to my roller coaster, up-and-down, wildly passionate first relationship. But that relationship almost destroyed me. The love I have now with my fiancé is very different, more like a wide swift running river than a tempestuous ocean. But this sustainable love means more to me.

I'm not saying that it's a pizza place trying to be religious to get around catering for gay weddings, but it's a religious place that wants to keep to their religion.

TrollYChromosome,3c8ka5,Seanzie82,8,Mon Jul 6 03:45:57 2015 UTC,"I assume it works similarly to that old check scam. Say you're selling a piece of furniture on Craigslist. Someone will email you saying they'll buy it but they're out of state, so they'll send you a check for the cost of the item plus shipping costs to send it on a truck to them. Presumably you'll handle all that business either on the same day or within a couple days. You deposit the check, set up the shipping, and when their check bounces, you're out the shipping cost, get nothing for the sale, and they get a free piece of furniture."
TrollYChromosome,3c8ka5,JEveryman,3,Mon Jul 6 04:12:45 2015 UTC,That's why if you accept checks as payment you tell them you will hold the order until the check clears.
TrollYChromosome,3c8ka5,Derigiberble,7,Mon Jul 6 12:21:19 2015 UTC,"The scammers are wise to that.   The check they use is normally a certified check so your bank is required to release the funds in a short amount of time.   It also has a routing number which will send it pinging back and forth all around the international check clearinghouse system for a week or more.   So two days after depositing you see the funds released and go ""oh it cleared!"" and ship the item and wire the remainder back.   Even if you wait for the amount of time the teller tells you it takes for a check to clear fully the routing number thing has ensured that the check actually hasn't cleared."

Learn how to find the g-spot (it's an area of ridged tissue similar to the top of your mouth), and how to finger it (make a 'come hither' motion). Find the clitoris. Seriously motherfucker, find the goddamn clitoris and work that shit. Suck, lick, circles, hard, light. Find out what she likes and do that. ""How do I find out what she likes?"" Listen to her. More animalistic grunts and groans the better. And, you know, ask her. Penetrate at an angle so that your dick is 'stretching' her vaginal opening, that way you're hitting as many of those nerves as possible. And aim for her g-spot as much as possible.  Apply and you'll be fine. Size doesn't matter, technique and confidence matters.  Also, people have fucked up ideas of what a 'normal' dick looks like. Average size for a man if ~5 inches.

When a woman is aroused, it increased to 4.25 inches to 4.75 inches.

Also it explains the movement Thor does to fly, he swings it then tosses it up all the while holding onto the strap so the hammer basically flies with that weight that's impossible to lift and negates Thor's ability to just wield it while in flight so as to not just drop from mid air."

Everyone is different and needs different things to get them through the lows of their depression. For me, I often find that just accepting the fact that ""okay, I am super depressed right now and I probably will be for a few days or so"" lets me take care of myself, instead of staying in denial and trying to force my way into a mental state that is not my reality. I just try to be a burrito and be alone and rest when I need it most, and then do the things as much as I can muster until I become drained enough that I have to be a burrito again."

Best part to me is that you can still eat however much you want, as long as you are hungry. I get terrible anxiety if I feel like I'm being denied food, but Whole 30 was great for me."

He wrote a letter and did a casual AMA on MTG, where he explained how he's trying to move on from his past, but there was some rhetorical phrasing that downplayed his actions.  The recent drama is because he got officially banned from MTG competitions until 2049 (?) and the community is in an uproar. Cue a lot of rape apology and threats to boycott wizards of the coast & hasbro.  TL;DR: A popular competitive player is a convicted rapist, current drama is MTG angry that he got banned from tournaments."

TrollYChromosome,3bvdpk,745631258978963214,8,Fri Jul 3 06:34:43 2015 UTC,"It's a question of semantics. For me, dating is that you meet someone who seems congenial and so you go out with them (visit a coffee shop, go to a movie, go bicycling, walk around town, see a show, etc.) a few times to see if you're compatible and attracted to each other. You might be seeing other people to see if they are compatible too (it was never my approach, but then I was never presented with that much choice at a time!)   Boy/girlfriend is the next step, and signifies exclusivity.  Mind you, back in my days and in my corner of the world, even dating was exclusive from the get-go, and you'd be viewed in a bad light if you went out with several people at the same time.   But that was three decades ago. Mores have changed. Expressions like ""friend with benefits"", ""fuck buddy"", polyamory etc. have entered our general vocabulary. Tindr and other ways of connecting online have had an impact on how people date. Why limit yourself to one person at a time (serial monogamy) when you can meet so many?    I do observe (from atop my middle-age, perhaps anecdotally) however, that having so much choice seems to make it harder to establish a solid relationship with one person. Again, committed relationships might not be what folks want nowadays; but it was what my guy wanted and what I wanted too. :-)"

Well, when I called him my ""backup date,"" my SO got his feathers ruffled till I explained that to me a ""date"" is just two people going out to have fun. I consider it a date when I go out with my girl friends too. The word is probably too ambiguous really.

It may seems overly optimistic, but I always lean towards the side of positivity.  That will never change.  I hope all of you glorious TrollY/Xers have a wonderful weekend. This ends my drunkish soap box rant of the night. Until we meet again (which will probably be tomorrow. Cause let's be honest, I love this ducking website)"
TrollYChromosome,3bydk8,Pentaghon,19,Fri Jul 3 04:21:29 2015 UTC,"So my wife used to say this a lot. It drove me crazy because it's a poorly communicated emotion that almost always precedes a fight. What ultimately stopped it was me finally saying (approximately):  ""When you say 'you're being distant' I don't know what that means. You need to tell me what behaviors I'm exhibiting so I can address them. When you tell me this and you're angry it makes me feel defensive because I don't know what to do and you're just getting angrier. I want to address/talk about the problem but you need to be specific.""  The combination of that and an Oprah article on good communication stopped the use of this phrase in our house for good. It's glorious."
TrollYChromosome,3bydk8,copymyjalopy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you found something that worked in your relationship, and that you asked for specificity when you needed that.   At the same time, i think it is perfectly okay for someone to talk about a feeling or vibe changing, not just a specific behavior. In my relationship, one or the other of us can say, ""You feel far away"". And sometimes who ever is far will realize they're not being present and get present, and sometimes it'll be a convo like, ""I'm stressed about x right now"" and so the other knows what's going on and we give each other space to be far for a while if they need it."
TrollYChromosome,3bydk8,hotheadnchickn,12,Mon Jul 6 04:01:40 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, this happened to me! Literally had no idea how to stop it because that's just my personality. I just interact well with the people I'm with and am awful at answering my phone.  It ended up causing a lot of mistrust and some ridiculous accusations. I think we weren't compatible in a lot of ways, but we ended up breaking up when we closed the distance.  Looking back, I wish I had made sure he fully understood that it really is just who I am. I probably should have made sure we were on the same page instead of just assuming he already knew I was a naturally aloof person.

The family has apparently been sitting on a small fortune since the 1910s when great-granddad made a drunken bet, and Gran has managed to keep everyone in the dark all these years."
TrollYChromosome,3bvkan,Kimmalah,12,Thu Jul 2 15:43:46 2015 UTC,I hope it works out OK in that case. I've heard so many stories of families turning on each other over stuff like this. :/ And yes if you're the one taking care of her (even in hospital) you deserve every bit of it! I know that's not easy.
TrollYChromosome,3bvkan,TheHundredSeas,15,Thu Jul 2 15:52:34 2015 UTC,"They're all pretty shit people so contact is rare. The last time I heard from my dad was when I accepted a job in the US and he called me asking if he could visit ""for a while"" but I don't think they'll be much of an issue. Their ability to contact me is limited to a throwaway email address and Gran has an amazing lawyer."
TrollYChromosome,3bvkan,TheHundredSeas,13,Thu Jul 2 16:09:50 2015 UTC,And you've earned it if you're visiting her because you love her and will miss her when she's gone. You are a good grandson and I'm sorry you're losing your gran. :(

I told her that I'll mourn whether she likes it or not, and she said, ""Well at least dry your tears with one of the fat rolls of cash I'm giving you, then.""  I'm going to miss her very much."
TrollYChromosome,3bvkan,robotshoelaces,8,Thu Jul 2 15:55:24 2015 UTC,That brought me both a tear and a chuckle. She sounds like a super cool gran and it's probably a great comfort to her that you turned out so well and that she can still take care of you even after she's gone.

TrollYChromosome,3buvrh,rabidhamster87,13,Thu Jul 2 22:23:56 2015 UTC,I had this moment a few months ago where my ex came up then I realized I wasn't in love with her any more. It took a very long time to get to that and was very painful all along the way. Seems that one day I just sort of forgot that she existed.
TrollYChromosome,3buvrh,asskilla,6,Thu Jul 2 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"I kind of had that moment last night!  We've been broken up for almost 3 years now and I've been with someone else, so I don't think I was still in love with him, but I did kind of view him as someone who was very special to me.  Last night though I saw a comment he made in relation to gay people and what he said was so narrow minded and judgemental.  It just made me realize I don't care what someone like that thinks of me.  It was like something clicked inside me and I suddenly had closure that I never had before."
TrollYChromosome,3buvrh,asskilla,3,Thu Jul 2 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"Good on ya! For you it was that FB comment, for me it was after a night of self loathing drinking and weed smoking.   But yes, that ""aha!"" moment when you realise ""Fuck this, why should I care about this person anymore"" was the most liberating thing I've felt in years. You take care fellow troll 🍻"

We sometimes see each other through our mutual friends and things will probably ok, but she expected me to treat her like she's still my girlfriend. She's friends with a lot of her exes, but now I see that those are pretty toxic relationships and I'm not going to stay there. Staying friends would mean for her that she did nothing wrong, but she hella did.   I'm glad you're doing well now. :)"
TrollYChromosome,3buvrh,asskilla,2,Thu Jul 2 15:17:50 2015 UTC,Yeah some people just like to feel the benefits of having you around without the actual commitment of having a relationship with you anymore.

Then again she left the relationship because she never saw me since I was a full time student with a full time job, she worked full time and our schedules never lined up. No bad blood.   I guess the point is there are circumstances for every break up and sometimes you need to get over yourself, not the ex. She's going to be a part of my life, so I'm glad that I can still call her a friend and not my bitch of an ex wife."

She left me for another guy (long story, it wasn't as bad as it may sound), and one evening she wrote out of the blue that she feels as miserable as I do, and the fact that she has a new guy only means that ""it's a bit nicer for her"" and some other things that was shitty then and bridge-burning fuel now. It was the evening that I was crying my eyes out, alone and miserable. Actually right now I don't fully understand why I wanted to stay friends."

I've only wanted to stay friends with an ex once before, and we managed it somewhat until he started dating the girl he'd always claimed just to be his best friend. Then I was mad. Then I figured out they were together while he and I still were together. Then I was out of this world heart broken."
TrollYChromosome,3buvrh,MyAssTakesMastercard,2,Thu Jul 2 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"That sucks man.   She told me she wasn't interested in this guy, but kept her phone away from me. Kept getting more distant, slipping away. Which was weird, but I didn't see them red flags waving in front of my face. After she broke up she admitted she was seeing that guy a few times before we broke up, but kept quiet because she felt guilty.   Looking back there were various other flags, but I was too blind to notice. My gut was saying somethings up but my heart and head was drunk, wasted on love. I hard a hard time trusting her after that, and those self doubts made me question all the things she said before.   Was she really in love with me? Was she sad we broke up? Or was she good at hiding it? Maybe she already mourned our relationship before we broke up? So much self doubt and questioning where I went wrong, but in the end I released myself from the burden by not caring about her at all. Just don't. Don't waste your brainpower and thoughts on what could have been, take them good memories and let go and be at peace."

I was hung up over my ex for 3 years, yes 3, after she left me after 7 years together. So much angst and self doubt, trying to win her back and tried to be friends with her, somehow hoping she would change her mind. I was really down in the dumps, while she was happily seeing other guys and not giving me even a sec of her time.   I tried to forget, to move on, but I can't. Many times I tried to cut her off but I failed. Then one day after months of smoking weed I woke up with an epiphany, why am I doing this to myself? I thought of all the times she cut me off, ignored me, went with other guys behind my back, not reciprocating the love, not putting in the effort between us.   Like you said, the most important person in this world, is your.fucking.self. If a person doesn't treat you well, why bother? To other bros out there in the same boat, do yourself a favour and move on. Distract yourself, hang out with those who do care, improve and make yourself happy. Never say you'll never find another one like her, because someone out there respects you more and you will find her.   Last time I saw/contacted her was in Jan. It was hard then, but now I rarely think about her. It gets better my dear bros. Take care my fellow trolls, 🍻 cheers!"

I used to be severely codependent until I learned how to be independent in relationships. However my dad is deeply codependent, and he is perfectly happy tied to his wife who is also incredibly codependent. It's hard to watch, but they're happy together. So I guess it's possible to do that, but I don't recommend it."

The same things that help with depression can help with codependence: get a hobby you can really enjoy, if you don't have a tight circle of friends, make getting some friends a priority until you do. Treat yourself weekly if you can by going alone to a place you enjoy like an arcade, the park, a nature hike, skating, the beach. I know it's more difficult than it sounds. The point is that you need to get comfortable in your own company without feeling lonely. I don't want to overstep by giving too much advice when maybe all you really wanted was a ""Hang in there guy, I believe in you,"" response, but if you wanna talk about it in more depth just send me a PM. But hang in there, and I do believe in you. :)"

Apparently at a show he talked about modern dating, and how guys are successful with picking up women. They went through a couple people's phones and had the audience judge which dude did the best ""pickup.""  I think the consensus was to get something started with a girl you should 1) Ask a question (starts the conversation), 2) Reference something you talked about before (shows you were paying attention), 3) Make definite plans (keeps things moving forward and makes your interest clear).

So my boyfriend gets out of bed to go out and buy me some nice breakfast while I meditate for a few minutes to calm myself down. Really made my morning a lot better.  Then when I get home, he buys me ice cream to celebrate me passing the test. And then he cooked me dinner tonight and we ate on the balcony.  I mean.. I don't expect this everyday but he just felt like being nice to me today because I was stressed out of my mind and he wanted to make my day better.

TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Otaylig,-6,Fri Jul 3 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"This is excellent advice, OP. Don't dwell on the pain and, thus, elongate it. And don't let her blame you for snooping her phone. It's only an invasion of privacy if you didn't find anything. (Disclamer: this is my opinion and subject to debate)"
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Otaylig,14,Thu Jul 2 07:29:32 2015 UTC,"UPDATE - After work, I ended up staying at my parents house for a day so I could clear my head, and figure out what I wanted to do. Then I made my decision & was ready to confront her about it, so I turned on my phone before heading back home. 38 missed calls, 17 texts, I don't have a voicemail setup. The texts mostly consisted of: ""Were you drunk last night?"" ""Where are you?"" ""Slavic what the fuck?"" pretty much up until the last message, which read ""I know you hate me, and I fucked up. I'm so sorry. Can we please talk?"" Great. I was emotional again.   So, I head back home, walk in the door, and she's sitting on the couch, watching TV, looking rough, but not as miserable as I was, that's for sure. Nothing was said. I didn't even look at her. I went to change into some new clothes since I was still wearing my work uniform. As soon as I come out of the bathroom door, she tries to hug me in tears. I pushed her away, and said ""I can't. What you did isn't right."" So, she cries even harder. At that point I felt like the bad guy. I asked her ""Why?"" and she told me, basically, ""I was drunk. You're always at work, or sleeping, and I'm always alone.""   Told her to pack her stuff and get out. She told me, crying, ""I have nowheres to go"". So I told her to call her mom. She refused. So I did it for her. Called her mom and said ""Look, your daughter has been unloyal to me, so I'm kicking her out. Can she stay with you? I can't handle her right now, and she can't stay here."" Her mother had no problem with it. She even drove here to pick her up. I helped pack her stuff up. But I still feel like shit. If there's one thing that gets to a guy, it's seeing someone you love, helplessly cry infront of you.   When her mother arrived, I helped my now ex pack her stuff into the car. Her mom was looking like something fierce, I thought she hated me. Nope. Right before they drove off I heard her mom say to her ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!?""   I still feel like shit about it. & I haven't heard anything from her yet. So, now, I'm just sitting here with some vodka, trying to drown out any feelings that I still have.   I want to thank everyone for their support, and responses. You have no idea how much you have helped me through this. I don't have many friends at all. Everytime I wanted to hang out with a friend, she would throw a hissy fit until I gave in and stayed at home with her."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Aksen,5,Sat Jul 4 02:44:10 2015 UTC,"Good on you, man. You did the hard thing, but you did the right thing. You're going to feel much better about this choice in the long run than if you had given in to the emotional manipulation she was throwing out there.  Also, that's a shit excuse for why. Yes, it's tough to be in a relationship when you don't get to see the other person all the time, but that's adulthood. If she was lonely, she should have gone and made some (platonic) friends, or gotten a hobby. Something. Sounds like she has some serious growing up to do, and she should do that a lot before you even begin entertaining the thought of getting back with her.  Do what you have to do to get back to a point of emotional equilibrium, and then get on with your life. There are other women out there who will treat you much better. Particularly, ones that understand that bills have to be paid, and that a healthy relationship is not one where they are the center of your universe. Take care, man."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,55easy,5,Sat Jul 4 06:20:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. I'm trying to do what's expected of me. I exercised today to the point where I couldn't anymore, and now I can't even bend my arms straight, or walk straight. Which is rare. I'm in pretty good shape, and I rarely get soreness. But, even still, my mind and thoughts keep going back to how great the relationship was, or atleast until I found out otherwise.   I'm not even sure how I'm going to be able to go to work today since my job requires active mobility, and I'm walking around like a t-rex.  You know, if she was lonely, I would've had no problem depriving my sleep schedule for a few hours just to be with her, but she never indicated otherwise. I thought, that, maybe, if I was providing everything, she would understand that I work for it, and work requires time, and time is money.   & As far as I'm concerned, I can't even consider any other woman at this point."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Dandy_Zmar,2,Sat Jul 4 06:35:37 2015 UTC,"Well, of course not. Like I said, do what you have to do getting back to where you feel okay with yourself. May take weeks, or months, but you'll get there.  Any reasonable adult would understand that someone has to be bringing in money. They would also understand that you would have other needs, outside of just being with them (sleep, friends, etc). Loneliness was no excuse for her behavior. She had many better options she didn't take."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Dandy_Zmar,12,Sat Jul 4 07:10:17 2015 UTC,"I'm so destroyed. I'm not even sure what to do, there's so many emotions running through me. God. what the fuck."

TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Maktube,4,Thu Jul 2 08:46:09 2015 UTC,Have you confronted her yet?
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Maktube,10,Thu Jul 2 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"No. It's 12:30AM. She's sleeping upstairs. I'm downstairs on the computer, crying, listening to music. I have to be at work miserable as fuck at 5AM, so I'm not going to confront her until I come home from work."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,JWNaaGB,10,Thu Jul 2 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry that you had to see that. I know how hard this is for you, and I and this sub will be here for you. Right now the most important thing is to keep yourself calm. If you have family in the area or a good friend to stay with for the night, then try that out. If you can't stay with anyone then try and call someone you're comfortable with to talk about the situation. I am completely open to talking about it with you if you would like to. Again, we'll all be here for you."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Maktube,9,Thu Jul 2 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I really appreciate that. I really do. I'm trying to be rational, but it's hard to when you're going through a million thoughts and emotions. I don't want to bother anyone right now, it's late, and I'm leaving for work in a few hours anyway. Do you think I should call up my family, and see if I can stay there, instead of coming back here and confronting her after work?"
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,JWNaaGB,11,Thu Jul 2 04:48:39 2015 UTC,"I 100% think you should do that. Once you remove yourself from the raw emotion you're experiencing right now and get another person's perspective, especially from someone who loves you like family does, it'll be much more clear. They'll guide you on the right path."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Otaylig,14,Thu Jul 2 04:54:35 2015 UTC,"I've been there. It's just going to suck worse than pretty much anything ever has, and it's going to keep doing that for a while. There's not really anything you can do about that, but it will get better eventually.  I agree with /u/Otaylig. Remember that no matter what, regardless of what reasons she may or may not have had, she's in the wrong. I also don't think she's necessarily a bad person, but I'll give you the same advice I got when this happened to me (I've learned the hard way that it's good advice):  When someone shows you who they are, believe them.  Edit: We're also totally here for you. You wanna talk about it or vent or whatever, just ask."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,bluefuzzyoctopus,5,Thu Jul 2 06:41:55 2015 UTC,How did you handle it when you knew she was cheating?
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,theg33k,8,Thu Jul 2 06:48:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the first thing I did was left the apartment, and slept in my office that night, because I felt like I needed some space. I spent some time talking to friends, and ultimately decided to give her a second chance, partly because it had happened a few years before I found out about it, and she seemed to genuinely regret it, and partly because I felt like it was the morally upstanding thing to do.   I did tell her that if we were going to make it work, we'd have to go to counseling, and we did, but ultimately it didn't work out.   I wish, in retrospect, that I had either just left, or told her ""You need to make this right. I don't really know what that will take, but this is your mess, and you need to clean it up"", and then left if she hadn't really put her heart into doing that. Instead, I ended up feeling like I was doing all the emotional heavy lifting, and we wound up focusing on her stuff."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,jintak3,5,Thu Jul 2 07:11:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. If she regrets her actions, I think I'll be doing just that. Once I get level-headed, and collect all of my thoughts. If not, then she has got to go, but even then, there's alot of ""Why's"" that I want answered."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,fate_mutineer,12,Thu Jul 2 07:23:23 2015 UTC,"I think that's wise. I'd caution you about the ""Why's"" though, and any other questions you might ask. Sometimes getting answers can help, but sometimes it just makes things worse. In my experience, if the reason you're asking a question is, deep down, because there's a specific answer that will make you feel better, think very, very carefully before you ask that question.  Also, if you're gonna give her another chance, I think it will help if you just accept from the get-go that it will almost certainly not work out. If it does, great. Just be careful about doing it just because you don't want to lose her, or lose what you thought you had.  It doesn't matter what she does or says, or whether it works out or not, in the end when the dust settles, you're going to be ok."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Skitspel,9,Thu Jul 2 07:52:50 2015 UTC,"At the risk of making OP feel worse, I have to say that taking a video of your affair seems worse than some out-of-the-blue one night stand that she regrets. If you regretted it, you'd delete the video, no?   Unless of course it was pre-OP."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,Krakenzmama,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for sure. In my case it really wasn't an out of the blue one night stand, it was definitely an affair that was planned out in advance and happened for a while, while we were engaged (and I was paying her rent). No one's ever in the same situation, and only the guy who's there can really make the decision."

TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,deadlast,3,Thu Jul 2 09:02:52 2015 UTC,"You're right on the money, on all points.   You can take any response to a why question from someone who just got caught cheating (or doing anything wrong) with a grain of salt. They're going to minimize. They're going to rationalize. They're going to deflect. It is the natural human response to being cornered like that.   The key in any relationship is trust, and it is near impossible to bring that back once it has been lost in this manner. Even if this girl does make good and do right by him, it leaves our boy in the unenviable position of feeling like he always has to watch his back with her. That's never a good place to be when in a relationship."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,aop42,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:42:48 2015 UTC,"Be careful with the ""whys"" and asking about specifics. If you just want to know so you know, or you want the comfort of a specific answer, then it's not worth the pain of hearing the real answer.   If there's some answer that will lead you to a different decision, then that could be important, but you need to be emotionally prepared to hear the ""wrong"" answer."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,_Bia,0,Thu Jul 2 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"If you're not married I would suggest ending it and avoid her like the plague for at least 6 months.  If you're truly meant to be together maybe you'll get back together a year or two down the road.  But you're not going to be in a place to think rationally about the situation for a while and she didn't just have a fling, she kept a video of it.  She clearly doesn't regret it.  Any regret she expresses when you confront her will be mostly regretting getting caught."
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,cabbagedeka,-2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"If she regrets her actions, I think I'll be doing just that.   dude ? You are still letting her take control of the situation.. Maup for once and have some self respect...Don;t follow her lead on what needs to be done.  What will you do  if she decide to work on it today but changes her mind tomorrow ? Or does not end the affair ?  Pretty sure she will be more careful next time"
TrollYChromosome,3bu3fx,stuffname,2,Thu Jul 2 10:30:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for you, this is just one of the worst things to experience. But even though it is a shitty thing to do by her that can't (and shouldn't be tried to) be justified, remember that people mostly just opt out the morals when doing such a thing. That sadly doesn't change the effect of her actions, but most likely it wasn't done to degrade you or something. And definitely, you shouldn't feel degraded because of her failure.   Unfortunately it's a very human thing, to have messed up desires that don't sum up to a good thing. I want to stress once more that this does neither justify her behaviour nor does it change the situation. But I hope it helps a bit to think about that, though you will have to deal with some shitty feelings for quite a while, these are things out of your control, that you aren't guilty or less of man for, bad things that happen, but that also will fade some day."

I don't know how to candy coat things, maybe I was from New York in a previous life, but I am saying this out of concern because I have experience with a cheating SO check my post history   I am concerned she took a movie and put it on her phone where it can be easily found >:( That's careless, stupid and possibly calculated -  in any way it hurt your feelings. She may have thought you wouldn't find it, she may have hoped you would.  I don't know how long you've been together. If it's been less than 2 years which haven't invested anything more than time -  no mortgage, no kids, no other financial reasons then may behoove you to end the relationship. Not out of principle but out of care and love for yourself and your future.   Here's the thing OP, if you have been together a long time - not talking months- I'm talking like 5 years or more. You bought a house, a car, had some kids.... Maybe things got stale or things have been distant or you have had a difficult stage in life (illness, layoff, death of a person close to you) that couldn't get by without some avenue of relief. I can see why a couple chooses to work on it;however, it will take effort on both your parts. If she's not into it, then you should work on getting okay with moving on and move on out."

TrollYChromosome,3bsqj4,absentbird,3,Thu Jul 2 20:23:43 2015 UTC,I mean that it sounds like you are projecting.  I can't understand why else you would feel so strongly.  It doesn't have to be about gender at all. Some people have a really hard time asking people out. It is possible that OPs coworker has been trying to work up the courage to be direct but keeps chickening out. At least she is making an active attempt to spend more time with him.  It is also possible that she doesn't know how she feels about OP yet. She could be trying to get to know him better before deciding whether she wants to date him or just be friends. Dating the wrong coworker can be a big mistake.  My point is that you seem like you are being overly harsh to OP's coworker when you know very little about the situation. It's almost like you are filling in details from a personal experience.
TrollYChromosome,3bsqj4,dontmindmeohno,2,Thu Jul 2 21:04:35 2015 UTC,"I guess I've come out more strongly than I feel about this.  OP's coworker may be scared, or she may not ask him out because she thinks it's his job. Some women wouldn't ask him out out of fear, but as things are, most would not do so because they see it as his responsibility (or worse, they think he wouldn't like to be asked out because he is a man, or that he'll say yes because ""men always say yes"").  Given that this particular girl has the guts to give him her number and do other things, I find it very unlikely that she is being held back by fear.   Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd be willing to bet that I'm not.  I've only had one bad experience with this. The girl wasn't shy at all, and gave lots of hints, so I asked her out. Turns out she was a sexist asshole, and making the first move wasn't the only responsibility I had in her eyes. So I don't waste my time with women who do this anymore, and I'd advice anyone to do the same. I think it's fair."

TrollYChromosome,3bqx87,Spokemaster_Flex,7,Wed Jul 1 13:16:11 2015 UTC,Right.  My fear is that multiple shelters told me flat out they wouldn't take her because they believe she'll be unadoptable.  She's going back to the shelter I got her from because they thankfully have a policy that they will ALWAYS take a pet back if they adopted the pet out.

TrollYChromosome,3bq142,Mr_Quackums,6,Thu Jul 2 00:50:25 2015 UTC,Hinge is a slightly more human dating app if it's in your city. The girls are all tired of tinder and more interested in dating than just fucking with people over text.
TrollYChromosome,3bq142,Badgerisbest,2,Wed Jul 1 14:33:40 2015 UTC,I don't have tinder but I tried OKC for a little while and it wasn't any better. If you still prefer the online thing over in-person then don't forget about /r/troll4troll. It's not specificaly for dating but you can easily meet lovely trollx ladies in your area. Just a thought. I know I would be thrilled to meet some some trolly-ers in Denver.

TrollYChromosome,3bq142,brightspace,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"yea, it's shit. You're basically advertising yourself through like 5 pics. If you've got your tinder-game together you'll get hundreds of matches, if you don't, you get like nothing. And even if you get a match you need to make some kind of remark that is interesting enough for the other person to engage or something, shit.   It's a very limited and restricted form of dating, I never got the hang of it. It's alot easier to walk up to someone in a pub or something and just have a conversation, where you've got so much more ways to express yourself with."
TrollYChromosome,3bq142,C0R4x,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:34:32 2015 UTC,It's not that bigga deal. Online dating - tinder not being an exception to this - has very poor statistics of any meaningful matchmaking.

Story time bros: I took a couple of years off college for financial reasons; I worked service for about two and half almost three years putting away every penny I could. After saving in the low 5 figures I went back to school, and with transferred credits had a very clear two year degree path. At the end of my last semester, after the semester was over, I received an email notifying me I was one credit shy of graduating. By the time I received this email, I had already accepted a job based on my diploma. I actually had to delay the start of my new, finally non-service job by a day to go and talk to my major's Department. OP - I did not schedule an appointment. I walked in with all the documentation from my last visit in hand and waited to see the next available counselor, who happened to be the person I had met with at the beginning of the semester. Soon enough the department head became aware of what was going on; they asked me to wait outside, but I could overhear their conversation, ""What did you do? How did you calculate this?"" ""I just followed the formulae- look!"" ... after about 20 minutes they informed me that they would take care of it. I received my diploma and am now now a manager at the company I first started working for. OP - tl;dr: please don't take this sitting down. Be polite, but be firm. If you have qualified for your degree, then go get it!"

TrollYChromosome,3bkbs8,PliskinSnake,4,Tue Jun 30 03:37:32 2015 UTC,That is why you always get renters insurance. Its so freaking cheap too and saves you so much headache.
TrollYChromosome,3bkbs8,ilikecamelsalot,2,Tue Jun 30 13:43:53 2015 UTC,"I had it but it was through my apartment complex. The people who robbed me managed to just yank the window up, which broke the ""lock"". It was a flimsy twist lock and it just fell off from what I could tell. My landlord said that because nothing was actually broken (like the window itself or the door or whatever) that they wouldn't cover it. And since I paid the tv off, they couldn't replace it. Just some bad luck all around I guess."

She'll definitely take you in while your place is cleaned and repaired. You'll bond through your mutual love of not being killed by psychopaths and eventually get married. On your wedding day, arrange for someone to destroy the bridal suite in a similar fashion to the way your apartment was destroyed.

Morning Wood when you really, really need to pee. And 2.) That at some point in the morning you will have to take a dump. See, the morning dump is often a powerful thing - so shooting to be at work when this takes place is an admirable goal. Why not be paid for my break to do something I would have already done at home... for free? The downside to this is that our bodies do not typically give us ""mid-sleep"" warnings that we have to go. Most mornings you wake up, do your thing, head to work and then at some point you need to go. For this post I woke up, got out of bed, and my guts were like: ""Bathroom. Now."" Hence taking up precious before work time."

On top of that the pants legs are so wide you can twirl and other things so it feels comfortable.  The only thing that is a bitch is tying them on.

TrollYChromosome,3bcx67,Punk_Trek,13,Sun Jun 28 09:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a short dude, and I'll explain it to you: gender norms. The gender norm is for men to be tall and women to be short. So women see short men as less manly than tall men and therefore are less attracted to them. You'll often hear women say they aren't attracted to short men because they feel less feminine around them. Well, that's because of gender norms. Even otherwise socially progressive, feminist women often feel this way. We fetishize the big, dominant man and the small, submissive woman.   It sucks, but all we as short guys can do is be ourselves and hope to meet someone--like you--who doesn't care or even likes our height, rare though you may sometimes seem!"

CS is getting better for women but not fast enough for either gender.   My recommendation? Do read on even though it's long, I've got good advice here:  Volunteer at like a hospital or some other position where you'll meet a lot of women in a professional ""not here to flirt"" setting so you don't feel any external pressure. I'd even take a class in a lady-dominated sphere like art or cooking or sewing (way more practical than you'd think) once you feel like you've got your sea legs. It can be good for your CV and yourself!  This is not so that you can meet a girlfriend or have women you meet set you up. This is so that you can spend time being around, doing stuff, getting to know, and hanging out with actual women so you know more about what women can be like-- they're mostly like guys but the differences can be a bit shocking if you're not experienced.   You'll also learn about how to interact with other guys while you're interacting with women-- it's always a nasty punch to the gut when you've got that acquaintance/co-worker/friend who is way more attractive than you dominate their attention and if you want a girlfriend/wife you'll have to learn to read people and deal with that because other attractive men don't disappear the second a girl agrees to date you.   Don't worry about age brackets either-- women in their 60s-30s were in their 20s and teens once and unless you've got hardcore mommy issues they can be super helpful in understanding where women your age might be headed, and women in their 20s and teens can be very overrated as friends because they're still as immature as you in ways you might not even realize.   Good luck fellow Troll."

TrollYChromosome,3b44rb,Bleatmop,2,Thu Jun 25 21:51:14 2015 UTC,Pressing the right arrow skips ahead 10 seconds. Just remember how many presses it takes to get through the credits and this is much less annoying.

Take some time off, blow off some steam and allow your body and mind to adjust to the fact you're no longer going to have her as a companion on your longest journey of life, it won't be too long until something comes along that lights a fire up your arse and helps you get up and do something, whether it is exercise or something creative that allows you to free your mind once more and allow you to follow your heart again.

I actually owe her a 'thanks' because I now have a lot of empathy for women who basically live with that nonsense all the time.

Second, if it's audible to other folks around, it's hella awkward, cause they always look at you with this different look after, like they expect you to walk over there and put some uber-suave man-action on that chick.

So when someone calls attention to them it is a personal acknowledgement.  Whereas when someone calls attention to a woman's body it is like they are publically marking her as a target.  It's the difference between someone saying ""I like your phone"" and ""Look at the expensive phone on that one. I would love to get my hands on that."" Edit: One is a little weird and the other is just creepy and there is no way to respond to it.  Edit 2: Another aspect is that it's part of toxic masculinity to intentionally make people feel uncomfortable. It's like a joke, a prank, joshing. So the fact that catcalls make women uncomfortable is exactly the type of thing that would cause that sort of guy to do it more."

TrollYChromosome,3az1b8,NiceyChappe,7,Wed Jun 24 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about the box...the box does not truly exist. Even gender expressions are a construct of our culture. You say you have ""feminine"" traits, but that's not really true. You have traits that our culture has told you are associated with ""femininity"", but the traits themselves are not inherently one thing or another.   The reason we have labels (like cis, trans, pan, etc.) is because different people do have different experiences, and they want those experiences to be recognized. A cisguy has a different experience than a trans man, and the latter doesn't want that experience to be downplayed or forgotten, although he wants to be identified as a man.   Humans are sorter. We like to sort things into categories; it's a trick that we use to reduce the cognitive load on our brains when we encounter something new. For example, a chair in a new place. You still know it's a chair, thus, you know what to do with the chair and how to react to it, even though you've never seen THAT chair before. So labels and categories are pretty deeply ingrained in us, as a species. it's just a matter of what we call the label, how we apply them, etc.   So, we all (societally, culturally, individually) try to walk the line between enough labels that everyone feels heard and acknowledges, and not so many that people get lost in the sheer number of things (and thus, the labels are useless). The problem is that we don't really have a common repository for those labels, so different things mean close to the same thing.   And our labels are fluid, fuzzy. Which is a good thing, I think. For example, you identify as a cis-male. But you have traits that you associate with women. And yet, that doesn't make you less of a cis-male, you still identify as a ""normal guy"". Even the labels fall on a gradient, making it harder to differentiate between where one ends and the next begins. So we have to be careful when we apply those labels, or have those labels applied to us, not to make too many assumptions about them (that goes for every kind of labeling, from race, to religion, to job title).   That got rambly, cause I wrote is over, like, 30 minutes, so hopefully it makes sense..."
TrollYChromosome,3az1b8,bluefuzzyoctopus,4,Wed Jun 24 21:02:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think the huge number of labels is very useful but it isn't like gender has the best track record of being useful in the first place.  From what I can tell the purpose of gender is to facilitate reproduction. If we were being utilitarian with it there would just be 'sperm provider' and 'fetus grower', everyone else would be genderless."
TrollYChromosome,3az1b8,absentbird,9,Wed Jun 24 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the only gender labels should be male, female, both, or neither.

If they want to create new terms to talk about that among themselves, that's great.  I'm totally supportive of their constructing and managing niche terminology for advanced identity theory.  There really isn't an issue until they try to impose those terms (or the use thereof) more broadly on others.  I think people should retain the right not to hyper-categorize themselves as well.  But I have no problem with the development of these lables in and of themselves.  I think of it as technical terminology for a specific mode of thought.  Like Latin names for plants."

TrollYChromosome,3atp71,jaxxly,27,Tue Jun 23 17:34:02 2015 UTC,It became a default sub. moment of silence
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,KipEnyan,-9,Tue Jun 23 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"default isn't a death sentence, quality is reduced but after a while, I see no reason subs can't be ""redeemed"" (First word I thought of) and quality will reach previous levels or at least close to once it is off of default"

I get why there could be a need for a default, wide-reaching, subreddit for women but if that's the level of quality it's at I'm not sure the default status is worth it."
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,jaxxly,-4,Tue Jun 23 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"I am sure if need be it will be deleted or renamed (new sub made). Perhaps I am a bit optimistic but with a sub like that, I doubt they would just let it go where it is going"
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,KipEnyan,-3,Tue Jun 23 18:11:14 2015 UTC,I don't know. I used to really like trollx but now it just reminds me too much of Facebook/tumblr.
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,jaxxly,5,Wed Jun 24 00:57:05 2015 UTC,"Their memes are Grade A Colombian, and they're socially progressive without being transspecies otherkin. So Facebook and tumblr are both out."
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,KipEnyan,0,Wed Jun 24 02:14:28 2015 UTC,What do you mean by Transspecies otherkin? I have seen a lot of screenshots that are literally from tumblr hit their front page lately.
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,c64glen,4,Wed Jun 24 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"Okay? Doesn't mean they're like tumblr. Tumblr is a platform. That's like saying ""I've literally been seeing stuff from reddit on their front page lately."" There's plenty of reasonable (and funny) folk over at tumblr too. IMHO, the worst of tumblr is the yin to the worst of reddit's yang. Reddit is constantly full of misogynistic garbage, tumblr takes it to the other extreme. I'm totes okay with them bringing some of the non-batshit crazy tumblr over here, give us a little bit of balance."
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,KipEnyan,0,Wed Jun 24 10:41:02 2015 UTC,"This is a lot of the reason I'm turned off to the trollx sub. I can't have the wrong opinion about content without getting downvoted or having someone respond to me in a condescending manner (when you said ""okay?"" it felt like you were invalidating my opinion ) . I definitely think there is great content on trollx but sometimes there are things voted to the front page that are juvenile. There has been batshit crazy extreme-feminist toned content on that sub in the past.  The example I'm thinking about is the photo of the girl holding a sign saying ""I need feminism because tampons shouldn't be taxed since they are a necessary item"". There were so many people that responded to that saying they should go bleed all over public property if they couldn't afford tampons. Yes, there is the male equivalent to that level of crazy on reddit but you can usually avoid it by unsubbing from some of the default subs. I never know if I'm going to be attacked for having a differing opinion in a trollx thread. It's always a gamble.   I guess what I'm trying to say is when I first found that sub I felt like I found a group of ladies that understood me and now I feel like I'm the odd one out because I disagree with some of the things that have been voted to their front page recently.   As a disclaimer, it's perfectly okay for you and I to disagree."
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,guy15s,2,Wed Jun 24 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"And disagree we do. If you think TrollX-ers are crazy, I suspect you and I would fail to see eye-to-eye on a great many things."
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,KipEnyan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:55:43 2015 UTC,I don't think trollxers are crazy. I never said they were crazy. I just think every now and then ridiculous stuff (like my example) and Facebook-esque posts (like e-cards) get upvoted to their front page. Im mildly annoyed by it but not so much that I dislike trollx overall. It's just something I noticed.
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,guy15s,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"The example you mentioned, I think the post itself was fine, and I think the comments you mentioned were fine. So still we disagree."

I retract my defense."
TrollYChromosome,3atp71,leoberto,10,Wed Jun 24 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"Idk, ""whiney special snowflake"" definitely sounds more like anti-feminist rhetoric than anti-front-page rhetoric."

TrollYChromosome,3aqhg7,squtternutbosh,11,Mon Jun 22 18:04:36 2015 UTC,What's a panic disorder?
TrollYChromosome,3aqhg7,PM_ME_YOUR_SAMOYED,37,Mon Jun 22 21:51:02 2015 UTC,"My favorite way of explaining how a panic disorder works is as follows:  Know how when you're driving and you look down for a sec? like to check the A/C or adjust the volume of your stereo. Then you look up and you've almost rear ended a guy?   That feeling you have. the one where you're scared shitless that you're about to get into an accident. That's an anxiety disorder. That feeling? that happens for about an hour instead of 3 minutes. Anxiety < Panic. A panic disorder is where you're definitely about to get into the accident and there's nothing you can do about it. You're holding on to dear life and theres no more control. you're about to crash. That ""oh shit"" moment.   Instead of being in a car-- You're hanging out with your friends. You're discussing brunch plans with a friend. you're scheduling a closing date on your home loan.   It happens anywhere. Its the worst thing a human can feel and it happens repeatedly. Sometimes dozens of times in a single day. It's hell. Its beyond hell. Because Hell is supposed to be a place where you go when you die but this time you're alive. This time every fear you had comes to fruition and there's nothing you can do about it. Sure, there's drugs, but they don't do anything but prevent the symptoms. Its still always there. Lurking underneath. Like cthulu's arms are pulling you down. You can't go back up to the surface. He's stronger and always going to pull you down.   The worst part is you get used to the darkness. You're used to being prodded and poked in the dark. You expect everything, you fear everything. You're always on edge. All it takes is that moment of clarity to bring some light. That's hope. Once you see that light, the prodding and poking feel worse. Its agony in its purest form.   The only thing you want to do is lay in your bed, heavily medicated (sometimes legally or illegally) and hope the tide rolls away and gives you a chance to walk upon land again.   edit I've been through no fewer than 2000 full-blown panic attacks. I naturally have anxiety but, that, I can handle. I've lost jobs, lost friends, lost lovers. All because of my panic disorder. It sucks. I wouldnt wish it upon my worst enemy."
TrollYChromosome,3aqhg7,msghmr,14,Mon Jun 22 22:39:16 2015 UTC,This whole description is why I sympathize deeply with anyone who suffers from panic attacks regardless of the severity of his or her disorder because the descriptions I've heard and read have been some of the most terrifying things I think a human can experience. I'm so sorry you have to go through this and I really hope you can find a treatment that works well for you. No one deserves to feel that way.
TrollYChromosome,3aqhg7,msghmr,12,Mon Jun 22 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"Hey Bro you got an upvote.   It's rough. The problem is there isn't a ""solid"" treatment. the meds destroyed my last relationship. -- How do you please a woman when you, yourself, cannot have an orgasm and cannot get aroused?  So for now, my treatment is as follows. -- To anyone else listening, don't do what I'm doing. Its all last-resort measures.   Onset of panic: Take a shot or two of vodka or tequila. -- Ativan, xanax an colonpin all work on the same level as alcohol. Unfortunately, alcohol hurts your liver more.  Once alcohol shots have been ingested i go to Flowy, a (android only?) game that helps you with breathing exercises After Flowy I ask my SO to leave me alone and I usually take a ridiculously hot shower. For some reason burning my skin feels better than the panic. --The same thing happened when my appendix ruptured. After a shower I put on my favorite show (bobs burgers) and lay naked in bed with the ceiling fan on full speed. This makes me feel cold. Still better feeling than anxiety. after drying off, if im still anxious I take an ativan. It is my last resort. I hate to use it. I hate to feel dull and muted. But its all that's left.   If im not cured by then.... It's about to get REALLY bad. All it takes is a heart palpitation or some pain in my chest to make me feel like im dying. Thats when everything I said above is for naught. You cannot fix me at this point. I am probably going to call 911. Im probably going to have to pay 1k in medical bills. That, or I'll have to pay 10k in medical bills because the police will drag me to a level 1 trauma center with a mental ward. (this has happened twice) because they dont know whats happening and think im suicidal.  Know how hard it is to kill yourself when all you fear is death?   I said this to the cops. They ignored me.   Mental disorders are hard to deal with. My mother has BPD. I now have OCPD and a PA. Im agrophobic, I'm anti social.... All of this because I'm afraid of one thing: Death.   Shit sucks, but I definitely feel better than i used to.  PS: Know what started this shit? Bad pot. It was dipped in PCP. That was my trigger."

I feel that talking is the best help but I know how crippling anxiety can be and I really feel for you.  It feels like you're not living life and you're not doing what you want to do. Even though when you do do what you want to do for some stupid reason anxiety changes it to something you don't want to do.   I feel like I'm not the same me- I was always out with friends drinking and having fun. I'm an extrovert at work but in the evenings I sit by myself watching TV.

I rarely drink now too and if I do I barely even get tipsy because I don't like the feeling of not being in control.  It's completely wrecked my social life, I don't go on nights out anymore and when I seldom do I don't drink.  I'm outgoing enough to have fun and not drink but it's definitely dented that.  I was invincible before I would do anything and everything and never even knew what depression and anxiety were.  I'm not depressed now.  I'm sad cause I'm not the same person but I try and see the benefits in it.   There's so many small things like even going on holiday that I think 'no I can't do that what if I had a panic attack' which is so shit. Even if I don't have a panic attack, which I haven't in a very long time, I still get nervous and I absolutely hate it.   Talking definitely helps but there's few people that can properly relate.

TrollYChromosome,3aqhg7,JWNaaGB,5,Tue Jun 23 11:35:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not a psychologist. My understanding (from wikipedia) is that a panic disorder is when someone suffers from recurring panic attacks and they cause severe anxiety during the attacks. Panic attacks are sudden episodes of extreme fear that can cause a myriad of symptoms, some of which include heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. I've heard them being described as feeling like you're dying (they happen very suddenly and are accompanied by severe anxiety and fear and can sometimes last for hours, though they are usually over in about 20ish minutes). This is just my understanding of them, and like I said, I'm not trained in psychology. I also do not have panic disorder or anxiety disorder so I have no clue what it feels like firsthand."

TrollYChromosome,3ansjc,mrjames5768,16,Mon Jun 22 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"Lady here.  I had a crush on this guy last summer, and while I sometimes make the first move, I hadn't in awhile and I was nervous. I asked him out and he politely declined.  Sucked. But, it made me kind of see things from guys' perspective and see how tough it can be to muster that courage when you're unsure of the outcome. I think women should ask men out more and level the playing field a bit. Not to sound too gendered, I know there are lots of women who make the first move. But historically it's been the guy's ""job"" and I think it's time to change that."

Anyway, whenever we hooked up, feelings would get complicated, we'd stop talking for a while and then make up later.

TrollYChromosome,3anqao,DeezNutz45,3,Mon Jun 22 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"Story time: Met this girl online after my GF and I broke up and I needed someone to talk to. She had just split with her BF and needed someone to talk to as well so we were partners in misery for a while. Gradually our convo's drifted from our SO's and to ourselves and got super flirty. I kept trying to get her to go to dinner with me, watch a movie, or something, but she would never actually meet up with me in person. I stopped texting her because I'm not one to be strung along, and just got a long message from her last night. Its either an attempt to pull me back in, or maybe she actually likes me. Unsure at this point."
TrollYChromosome,3anqao,rynadrk,8,Mon Jun 22 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"For flakes I usually just go, ""There is too much to go over in text so let's meet up for coffee and catch up.""  It usually leads to 1) them never responding (which is fine) or 2) actually meeting up and catching up.  One message and you're done."
TrollYChromosome,3anqao,Mr_Wiflbat,2,Mon Jun 22 19:18:34 2015 UTC,I had a similar thing happen to me except instead of her texting me we just ran into each other in real life on a movie set. We had only ever talked online so it was rather surprising.

TrollYChromosome,3ao24s,Mr_Spaz,2,Mon Jun 22 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"I am assuming you were going downhill and using your brakes alot which caused them to overheat or boil your brake fluid.   Next time use your transmission and engine to do the braking by leaving your throttle closed and downshifting into a lower gear. This will cause a vacuum in your engine combined with the lower gears of the transmission, increasing your drag and slowing your car without using your brakes."
TrollYChromosome,3ao24s,glitchvdub,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"I know about engine braking.  I have an automatic, and I can't shift into the lower gears unless the car is already moving slowly.  The mechanic who's looking at the car today said the issue was that one of the brake lines running to the rear wheels burst, and the fluid spilled out of there."
TrollYChromosome,3ao24s,glitchvdub,2,Mon Jun 22 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Since they are in there have them do a full exchange of your brake fluid, should be done every 4 or so years anyways."
