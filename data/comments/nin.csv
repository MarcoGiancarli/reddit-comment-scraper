It's the 21st century, why is lossless digital so hard to come by? And I don't just mean here, I mean in general.  Beatport is great, buy it's mostly electronic only, and you pay out the nose (for lossless). Amazon is determined to push mp3. Bandcamp is excellent (love them!), but it's mostly independent artists (nothing wrong with that, but I can't get most major artists there). And Apple is Apple: you do things their way, or fuck you.  I just don't get it. I just want drm free, lossless quality, or a cd to make lossless quality. Yes, vinyl may sound better in some circumstances, but I don't have a turntable, and I'm not rebuying my entire collection from the 90s+.  Sorry, I'm off the soapbox now...I just wish we were given options, instead of being forced into whatever format someone in marketing thinks is best."

Sound isn't really something I'm looking for when I collect unless it's been specifically remastered, remixed, and/or reformatted for the vinyl (In Utero, The Fragile, etc). What got me most excited about that statement is that if he's talking about a physical release for these Gone Girl sessions, then maybe those instrumentals from The Fragile will get the same treatment in the form of the super deluxe edition we've all been waiting for? haha.

Use Audacity (its available for Windows and Mac OS for free), find the segment you want, export it as a .wav, convert with iTunes to .m4a, then just rename the extension to .m4r (make extensions visible in folder option in control panel. Not too sure on how you'd do it on a Mac). Done. No freaky conversion software, no weird websites, and you get the exact portion you want. Ringtones cap out at 0:30, and I can only imagine why anyone would want something longer than a second or two for texts, but the same rule applies there."

You are absolutely on point with your analysis with TDS and Fight Club. I had reached a similar conclusion, then found Chuck was listening to TDS during his writing. I have thought they must be inspired by one another, playing off one another throughout their careers.  ""Copy of a Copy of a Copy"" is a line appearing in Invisible Monsters quite often, years later Trent makes a track on Hesitation marks mirroring the same ideas.

nin,3deuvy,WombatWithWings,8,Wed Jul 15 21:06:36 2015 UTC,"That song is a perfect! It can go up against Mr Self Destruct, Somewhat Damaged, and Head Like a Hole for best album opener if the second half was a separate album."

nin,3deuvy,Qaebuuz,5,Thu Jul 16 01:04:18 2015 UTC,IMO this song is literally perfect the way it is.
nin,3deuvy,kyleclements,4,Thu Jul 16 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"One of the bonus songs on Ghosts is actually an early version of ""demon seed"" from The Slip, and the difference between the two is amazing, and it makes me want to see some of those songs from Ghosts extended and worked into proper songs.  There is so much potential sitting in that album.  (not that it isn't great as-is...)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_sn9CwApbQ"
nin,3deuvy,WombatWithWings,4,Thu Jul 16 01:28:33 2015 UTC,I really dislike Starfuckers and No You Don't. They should be on Things Falling Apart instead of 10 Miles High and The Great Collapse.   Appendage and The March both NEED lyrics. It's so close you can almost taste it.
nin,3deuvy,Barringerlr,3,Thu Jul 16 13:01:56 2015 UTC,"TDS being my favorite album of all time, I dig the shit out of Heresy's instrumentals but cringe at the chorus every time."
nin,3deuvy,OSLIN,2,Wed Jul 15 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"The Downward Spiral (song) - keep the screaming, drop the vocals (blasphemer!), just as effective with that cymbal crash at the end.   34 Ghosts IV - I always imagined the plucked banjo being replaced by Trent's vocals would sound fantastic. Then as the piano kicks in, have a refrain kick in, then another layer of vocals with the plucked strings. Then when it drops to the drone sounds the vocals would stop. Then when you hear the distorted guitar kick in, I would love to hear some layered Trent screams under that.  Then once the piano at the end kicks back in some whispers. This song, plus 28 Ghosts IV and 33 Ghosts IV (Year Zero type lyrics) would be fantastic with vocals."
nin,3deuvy,SplatChrome,2,Thu Jul 16 01:26:00 2015 UTC,None.  His instrumentals in albums are key to the beauty of the album structures as a whole.  And I can't get enough of trents voice that I'd never take it away from the tracks that they exist in.
nin,3deuvy,RoSoDude,2,Fri Jul 17 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"I don't really feel any NIN instrumental needs vocals, as they usually don't seem built on the same sort of structure that vocal NIN songs have.  I've never really liked the singing on the Still version of The Day the World Went Away, unfortunately. It just sounds awkward and forced somehow. I'd prefer an instrumental version of that particular arrangement."
nin,3deuvy,Jewggerz,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"I love The Fragile, but there are multiple examples of both of these on that album.  Pilgrimage is great, but could maybe use a dictator talking over it with a rabid crowd."

nin,3dbx6j,kethinov,3,Wed Jul 15 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"The gist is basically this:   The vinyl version has longer versions of several songs. The vinyl version also includes some tracks that the other releases don't: 10 Miles High and The New Flesh. The CD version is generally better audio quality unless your vinyl rip is really good and possesses no flaws. Deep was recorded during The Fragile era and is speculated to be related somehow to Even Deeper. Placement is somewhat arbitrary, but it fits well in the flow of the album where I put it. The March, Can I Stay Here, and Hello Everything Is Not OK are only present on the Apple Music release. Appendage is only present on the cassette version. Ripe (With Decay) isn't present on the vinyl version.   This version combines all this, in context as much as possible."
nin,3dbx6j,Reinmann,4,Wed Jul 15 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"I tossed in The Great Collapse after The Wretched (due to the lyrical crossover) on my ultimate version. It's a cool track, and Trent has specifically said it's not a remix and that it stands as its own song."
nin,3dbx6j,beartheminus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:08:02 2015 UTC,"You're right, I forgot about that one. I once had it in the same position (after The Wretched) on a previous version of my personal ""director's cut"" but I think I removed it eventually because I didn't like how it has a small piece of ""Slipping Away"" at the very beginning. A minor nitpick though. I should add it back."
nin,3dbx6j,Reinmann,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:29:15 2015 UTC,I thought appendage was available on Apple Music. Why would you source the inferior quality cassette version?
nin,3dbx6j,beartheminus,2,Wed Jul 15 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"The cassette version has, among other things, vocals."
nin,3dbx6j,Reinmann,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:02:46 2015 UTC,are they similar other than that? I have a recording studio maybe I can spend a bit of time isolating the vocals in the cassette version and mixing it with the HQ apple music one.
nin,3dbx6j,ninger6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"The one from Apple Music has a lot of weird layered additions, and I believe it's like a minute longer. I personally prefer the layout and the cleanliness of the cassette version."
nin,3dbx6j,beartheminus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:19:07 2015 UTC,"Is there a decent rip of the track? The quality I have with mine is horrendous, I still need to hunt down a cassette copy."

nin,3d9y5j,teleekom,3,Tue Jul 14 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"Not quite. The Dust Brothers (US) responsible for the Fight Club soundtrack are not the same people as the UK Dust Brothers, who took the name in homage to the Dust Brothers (US). The UK Dust Brothers had to change their name due to the threat of a lawsuit, and became the Chemical Brothers.  The Chemical Brothers were not involved with the Fight Club soundtrack."

nin,3depys,JeanneDOrc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"I suppose that I should replace ""because demand is very high"" with ""because enough people are willing to pay high prices"" to reflect that this is essentially a luxury market rather than a supply-demand balanced market. For example, Rolex watches are not at all rare, but they are very expensive.  In any case, my point was that the fragile vinyl is not rare - it's just expensive. To contrast the 20+ copies of the fragile vinyl I could buy right now if I were so inclined, there are a number of nin media items that are so rare that I've never even seen one for sale despite years of searching."

Hesitation Marks cost me about $25 if I recall correctly. Most other artists are happy to repress their albums though, keeping them fairly low priced over time. Trent never seems to, so if you don't buy it when it comes out then the price skyrockets once they stop being pressed. The Downward Spiral, With Teeth, and Year Zero are going for $80, $125, and $150 respectively these days, but I didn't pay more than $30-$35 for the copies I bought when they first came out."

nin,3d10xw,thefirdblu,6,Sun Jul 12 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Well that's cool. The segment/routine it was used for was pretty appropriate (and that song got loud as fuck), but I know Trent has stated he didn't like it being used as a stripping song."
nin,3d10xw,masteroffm,5,Sun Jul 12 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe because it was for male stripping this time, and Trent probably found some amusement in that."

And luckily Greg [Jacobs, the director] helped us get this one — it was all him, actually. He is really good friends with the band's manager, and from what we heard, they were fans of Magic Mike and fans of [Steven] Soderbergh and totally cool with us using the song."

nin,3chnjj,nascentia,3,Wed Jul 8 09:58:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to all the albums yet, (don't rush me, still getting into NIN!) but,  PHM: Kinda I Want To. Weakest song on the album, not much more to it. Spiral: Big Man With A Gun. It reminds me of Six Shooter from QotSA's songs for the deaf. It's not a bad song and it has its place on the album, but it's just hard to care for. Fragile (L): No, You Don't. Again, it's not a bad song, I just think it sounds more like something from With Teeth as opposed to the Fragile) Fragile (R): This one's really tough. Starfuckers, Inc doesn't fit the album too well, but it's too good of a song to remove. Probably Complication, of all the amazing instrumentals on the Fragile, it's the least amazing. Awithateetha: Getting Smaller, I'm sure most can of us agree on this one. Year Zero: This one's really difficult. Probably Meet Your Master, just because I feel it's not as exciting as the others."
nin,3chnjj,frankieh,3,Wed Jul 8 12:17:21 2015 UTC,"I can agree with all of these, except No, You Don't. I really love that track, it's so fun to jam out too. You definitely picked some good candidates though"
nin,3chnjj,nascentia,2,Wed Jul 8 13:01:10 2015 UTC,"PHM - I dunno, the whole album is the only album Trent has made that just feels dated to me. It's good, it's AMAZING for its time, but it's just... not something I listen to very often. I guess maybe Kinda I Want to.  Broken - I love this whole album, from start to finish. That said, if I HAD to pick a least favorite, it would be Gave Up. But I'd be REALLY mad that I had to get rid of it.   TDS - UUUh, if you take any one song off of this album, it becomes... not The Downward Spiral. It's such a high concept album, I don't think it would work. So, I dunno. I guess my least favorite track is Hurt. It's a good song, but it's not something I listen to that much. But the album would make no sense without it. Big Man with a Big Gun, I guess.   The Fragile - Even Deeper. The 2nd half of the track kind of bores me. It's literally the only moment on the album I'm not fully engaged.   With Teeth - Beside You in Time.   Year Zero - The Beginning of the End. Meh, kind of a mediocre NIN song.   Ghosts - As I've said before, I don't really pay attention to the track names on this, when I listen to it.   The Slip - Discipline. Never liked it.   Hesitation Marks - Disappointed. But can I take off Satellite too?"
nin,3chnjj,jeffreyschon,2,Wed Jul 8 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"You killed me with Beside You In Time, and even more so with The Beginning of the End and Discipline. Those two are very, very high up on my list of favorite NIN tracks, with Discipline probably at number 1. Regardless, I agree with your other choices."
nin,3chnjj,GwenCS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:06:16 2015 UTC,"Beside You In Time is really great, but like, I thought about The Hand That Feeds, but, even though it's not even close to Trent's greatest... it's kind of a staple of that album. And I do like the lyrics. Then I thought about Getting Smaller, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't love that guitar on the chrous. Which brought me to Beside You In Time. It just seems less necessary within the context of the album. I'd miss it, but ultimately it's a track I could live without.   Discipline, I dunno, I just never really enjoyed that track. I don't really like 1,000,000 either. It's good live, but on the album it doesn't do much for me. I much prefer lights in the sky and the four of us are dying.   The Beginning of the End is just... I dunno... it never did much for me. I don't think the album really takes off till Survivalism kicks in."
nin,3chnjj,rd1994,2,Wed Jul 8 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"I understood it wrong thinking you meant take off as in ""take off to make a perfect album,"" rather that take off as in remove. I put too much thinking into it to not post it so here you go, my spin on your question.  PHM: Terrible Lie  This one's hard because, although it's not a common opinion, this is one of my favourite albums. I guess I'd have to pick Terrible lie because it gets me going like no other.   Broken: Wish  It's a really close call between Wish and Perfect Drug. I'd probably give the edge to Wish because it's more than likely going to be my pick for the heavy side of things and that'll even out my list haha. Also, there's nothing like being in a whole crowd yelling ""fist fuck!""  TDS: Piggy  When I have to define NIN to someone this album would be the sample I give them. This has always been my go to driving album because it is just perfect. I'll pick Piggy because it's so relaxing and energizing at the same time. (Those drums!) I love the feeling of, for lack of a better term, being overwhelmed with sound. The drum buildup gives me goosebumps every time.   The Fragile: We're In This Together  Another really hard one to pick, probably the hardest in my opinion. Even though this album never ends up standing out to me it's my all together favourite. We're In This Together will e my pick purely because I haven't listened to this album as a whole in a very long time and that's what's sticking out in my head which must mean something, right? It's all so damn good!  [Awitha Teetha]: Right Where It Belongs  First of all, ""Awitha Teetha,"" that's the hardest I have laughed in a long time. It's perfect. (Kind of reminds me of this classic.) I'm picking Right Where It Belongs because that song has stood the test of time as my favourite song. Every time it comes on it puts me into a trance.   Year Zero: Survivalism  I love this album but I don't give it enough love. I need to listen to it more to properly pick a favourite but Survivalism is a very very solid song to jam to so I'll pick that.  Ghosts I-IV: 4, 12, and 23  I'm really glad that Ghosts I-IV was included because this is often overlooked. I have spent a ridiculous amount of time with this album which makes it all the harder to pick. When it first came out a friend and I sat in his basement and listened to it and renamed every song by how they made us feel, what aurora they were giving off, not to sound like a pretentious hippie but I think everyone should analyze this album this way. It was an experience. That being said I cannot pick just one and even two is hard so I'll narrow it down to three: 4 Ghosts I (Despair), 12 Ghosts II (Happy Sadness), and 23 Ghosts III (Frenzy).   The Slip: Lights In The Sky  Another album that I don't give enough love to. This was an easy pick for me because Lights In The Sky is flawlessly interesting to me.   Hesitation Marks  I wasn't crazy about this album at first but it really grew on me and is now one of my favourites, which makes this extremely difficult. My pick is going to have to be Satellite. The thing that pushes it to the top for me is the light show that was happening when they played it live for the Tension 2013 tour. There was a cameraman on stage which had a live feed projecting behind the band that was very low-poly red and black image, which was awesome and the whistle noise had a beam of light accompanying it that I will never forget for some reason. I can never find a video to do it justice but here is a good one (and here is the one from the show I was at! Not that it makes a difference haha)  Holy shit, just got done typing all of that and I just realized that you meant ""take off"" as in remove, I took it as ""take off to make a perfect album."" Oh well, it stays."

nin,3cbwpz,nascentia,2,Tue Jul 7 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? Happiness in Slavery is honestly not just my favorite song on Broken but probably one of my favorite NiN songs. To me, very few NiN songs are the ""complete package,"" in the sense that they unite the lyrics and sonic elements together to create a unified message. He's always been better at just eliciting generalized feelings - for instance, I've always assumed that ""Gave Up"" was a break up song, and I listened to it quite often when I was going through my divorce - but if you pay close attention to the lyrics, it's hard to pin it down, aside from a generalized sense of anger toward someone and feelings of self-loathing. Lots of NiN songs are like that - they elicit feelings but not some sort of coherent message - which is part of why some of my favorite tracks don't even have lyrics (""Leaving Hope,"" ""Just Like You Imagined,"" ""Ghosts II-12,"" ""Warm Place,"" and so on). Many of the songs I fondly remember for neat little sonic moments (like the horns in ""Ruiner"" or the drum solo in ""Piggy"") and not anything in particular about the content.   But Happiness in Slavery is one of those few songs that just combine it together. The sonic aspects of the song help reinforce the message, with the alternating voice of the ""slave"" and the wisdom of the ""narrator"" issuing his warning about the dangers of freedom. It does such a good job of capturing that generalized angst with no real target that was so characteristic of my generation. (I wrote a whole philosophy paper about this one song as an undergraduate).  I just find this part of the song to be so brilliant:   https://youtu.be/Fdl70hZZZRc?t=2m56s  It's not perfect, and I think it drags out a little too long in the last half of the song (that probably could have been cut severely back). But it's definitely a great song that doesn't get enough love."
nin,3cbwpz,kennyminot,2,Tue Jul 7 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"You know what's really interesting in all of this, is almost every song you mention as being one of your favorites? Those are some of my favorites, too...I've always preferred the more layered instrumental songs, which is partly why I'm falling in love with The Fragile all over again now that he's put that out as an instrumental album.   Very interesting how two people can have so much in common taste wise, yet differ completely on one particular track.  I don't hate or even dislike Happiness in Slavery...I just think it's my least favorite on that album. I'm not sure there are any NIN tracks I actively dislike, though (not counting remixes...I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the stuff on Fixed.)"

I feel like the majority of Only remixes tend to change the song far too much.  They lose the melody and the original track a bit too much.  This was definitely an improvement over most, and it was pretty well done.  But I don't think the vocals went that well with the backing changes.  The altered melody really seemed odd when combined with the vocals.  The whole way through I felt confused about whether or not it was 'working'.  It sounded good overall, but it didn't feel like it belonged.  Edit:  Loving these other remixes though."

nin,3c3g57,beanmosheen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:04:17 2015 UTC,There are clearly visible actual keyboards. The DX7 stands out immediately. It's probably a mix of both.
nin,3c3g57,beartheminus,2,Mon Jul 6 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"They are cheaper keyboards like the dx7 but all running in midi controller mode. They don't actually use any of the soundbanks or outputs on them. They would never risk that. All actual synths/soundbanks/sequencers are safely backstage. Nothing on stage actually ever makes a noise. This also makes it easier to perform as you simply show up at a keyboard and the right synth is routed to it, all controlled by stage hands backstage. (I'm speaking only about the self destruct era, everything now is actual usb/midi controllers and apple mainstage and Alessandro does use some actual modular gear onstage now)"

If you don't want to pirate it, but can't obtain it legally for whatever reason, then pirate it anyway and find another way to support NIN directly. Trent Reznor has been pretty forward thinking in the past about just getting his music out there, I don't think it would be a big deal to obtain it by whatever means necessary. Trent knew it would be this way when he opted to have the Apple Music exclusive deal."

The extended riff on The Mark Has Been Made was cool as hell too, as well as the restructured Somewhat Damaged and the additional end elements added to The Big Come Down.

I heard a little bit of Josh Homme’s show the other day and I was thinking, “Man, I should’ve fuckin’ thought about this side of it.” I’ve been so busy thinking about keeping the cord plugged into the wall that I haven’t thought that much about it... I’m going to see what happens in the next couple months here.  TRENT RADIO SHOW HYPE!"

nin,3bsp3c,oblong_cheese,21,Thu Jul 2 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"I love everything Trent does but his affiliation with Apple, based (these days) purely on aesthetics is a little tiring.  As someone who has only owned a single Apple product my entire life (2006 iPod mini, back when iPods were actually great/unique products), why should I care about Apple Music?  It's downright irritating that the newly released instrumental albums are apparently exclusive to Apple Music. Trent ""fuck the record industry, no wait actually they're OK"" Reznor is essentially telling every non-Apple user to get fucked.  Well, at least we can we follow his advice from 2009 and ""steal"" the albums.  /rant"
nin,3bsp3c,tuddlemunce,6,Thu Jul 2 00:42:07 2015 UTC,"His affiliation with Apple wasn't necessarily his doing. He announced the concept of Daisy with Jimmy Iovine in January 2013. Daisy was going to be a streaming service created by Trent & Beats Audio blah blah blah.  Beats decides to make Daisy just Beats Music. It sucked.  Apple buys Beats.  Apple re-launches Beats Music as Apple Music.  I think Trent became involved in the first place because, in his own words, ""you don’t make a lot of money selling music these days."" He probably had the choice to stay or leave during the acquisition. Would YOU rather: 1. Work for Apple, make a bunch of money, and have an executive role in launching a serious contender in the music streaming marketplace, now the biggest content delivery system for music to consumers. You have to make a few ads for Apple Music and tell the ten people who don't have an iPhone to get one. OR 2. Not make any money, not have any influence in the music marketplace, hold your holy integrity as an Apple hater.  Full disclosure: I own a Macbook because I'm a graphic designer. I'd use a PC if I could, but I can't. So that's that. I still don't have an iPhone. Fuck iPhones.  TL;DR I think Trent chose his best option. Yeah, Apple sucks, but so do almost all music content providers."

Will these tracks be available everywhere else too?  Will I have to go to 3 different music services to hear them?  I'm never going to get Apple music, 3 months free or otherwise...  Exclusives translate to exclusions in my book.  I love TR and NIN but I have a hard time swallowing the Apple pill he likes to push."

nin,3br653,juskajo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:03:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that on an online forum somewhere a few months ago, and I've been looking for the ""March"" version since then (although I do love Skin of a Drum). So glad it's up in an easy to find place now"
nin,3bogu0,teleekom,12,Tue Jun 30 21:20:17 2015 UTC,Definitely shares elements with 10 Miles High. From the 3 minute mark it's unmistakeable as an alternate take on the same idea. The stereo popping out while obviously unintentional just adds to the effect imo.
nin,3bogu0,bajster,2,Tue Jun 30 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  And based on how the album was developed, they both probably started from the same place.  (From what I remember, development of the album was very organic... he and the musicians would try a bunch of things, mix together stuff they tried out, then use that for the basis of new things, and work from there. It's why there's a lot of self-similarity with a lot of the songs..)"
nin,3bogu0,yorgle,9,Wed Jul 1 14:04:54 2015 UTC,In this form it actually sounds like it'd fit in well on Mechanical Animals.
nin,3bogu0,PartiallyWindow,2,Tue Jun 30 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"Agree, first thought was Marilyn Manson AntiChirst Superstar or MA era with the drums reminding me of I'm Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally. I like this pretty cinematic and instrumental tune (with 10 miles high in it). The Starfuckers Inc. intro is at the end, so it came next in the tracklisting."

I fixed it by mirroring the left channel whenever the right channel would cut out. I also removed a small pop from the beginning of the track. No other filters or modifications have been applied.  Bonus: Seldom seen thumbnails from the NIN website during The Fragile Era in the video image!"

Or is it streaming only with no offline (I've not been following it)?    (I mean, I know the apple store music section was supposed to go DRM free years ago, but there's gotta be a catch here, right?)"
nin,3bmfrg,nascentia,3,Tue Jun 30 14:16:50 2015 UTC,"It looks like you can download it to your device, similarly to how Spotify makes things available offline. I'm streaming it now but set it to download. We'll see how it goes."
nin,3bmfrg,signofthenine,6,Tue Jun 30 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"Please let us know how it goes.  If I can download and move to the format of my choice, I might put away the pitchfork. But I'd be lying if I said I was happy with this turn of events. We've been waiting for a nice Fragile remaster/expanded edition for years, and tossing some of those potential tracks up in a streaming service (with no other option, currently) makes me cranky.  I swear, I'm trying not to sound like an entitled twat here."
nin,3bmfrg,dubsric,8,Tue Jun 30 20:39:55 2015 UTC,Trent also stated he will most likely add to this compilation as he unearths more tracks overtime

Very cool Starfuckers has the KISS live outro Complication is labelled Alt but aside from segues it's the same mix, even has vox layer ILFTJYF is the same mix but with full intro (vinyl) TBCD is the same mix. Doesn't have the distant vocal fade in though UIA is the same mix but has a longer intro. Includes the ""all I do/I can still feel you"" ending vox layer Ripe is quite the Alt mix.

I can't find it manually on the store.   Why can't I just place a CC order @ nin.com and have immediate access to downloads (with a cd in the mail)? Is that really so hard to do in 2015? Do ""fans"" (the people that want to actually PAY the artist, and not this .02 cents a stream bullshit) just not want that?  Frankly, I don't see why anyone would want to use this service. It makes no sense whatsoever.  edit: If this is like ""going to the record store"", it's the shittiest record store I've ever been in.

After is an area I've always felt a bit distant from, nothing has really lived up to what came before for me. That said, I did like HM a lot when it came out and still do but it still doesn't have the depth, it doesn't sound like it took years to make like some of his stuff does. I don't enjoy Everything though, not because it is poppy, I actually like the song itself, but because it is badly performed. He strains a lot on the vocals and doesn't quite reach where he needs to be in places and it grates. If it were recorded by someone else I'm sure the track would be great."

After about the 4th (or 5th!) minute they start to get kind of repetitive and lose some of their power. I feel like that's the composing and Atticus leaking into his editing choices. Not to criticize Atticus of course. But the album could have been tighter.
nin,3b70nr,CrackityJones42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:38:47 2015 UTC,I would definitely criticize Atticus. Dude is the entire reason Trent sucks now.

To me the album itself doesn't have the same cohesiveness of the other albums but I do enjoy listening to the songs individually when I play them on shuffle.

nin,3b70nr,htlr,7,Sat Jun 27 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"I like all of it, aside from basically the whole middle section. I don't like  Disappointed, Everything, and Satellite.   Really, I don't mind Everything, as a song, but I'm never in the mood for it, if that makes sense. Disappointed and Satellite I just outright don't like.   Beyond that I think it's a solid album. It's less moody than his earlier work, but more moody and interesting than The Slip.   I think it goes ahead of The Slip, PHM, and Ghosts. But After TDS, The Fragile, Year Zero, Broken, and Awithateetha. So I guess I'd say it's lower on the totem pole.. but lower on the totem pole for NIN to me still = WAY higher than most music that comes out.   I honestly dig the album, and even listen to it still. I think it was a lot better than what music publications gave it credit for when it first came out. It's a really cool, more mellow album, and it still has a ton of emotion and artistry."
nin,3b70nr,CDC_,5,Fri Jun 26 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's Trent's best work since The Fragile. I have love for all of NIN's albums, but HM hit me a certain way and it really resonates with me. I think it's absolutely brilliant and I listen to it very frequently (much to my wife's chagrin).   I also feel it's some of his darkest work, I read a lot of people's analysis of the songs and the result is that it's ""happy"" and there's elements of ""healing"" and leaving the pas behind, etc. I think the opposite. I think the past still very much haunts him, despite where he is in his life now. He's in a better place in many ways, but there's still that dark corner of his mind that nags at him. JMHO."

""radio-friendly"" tracks that can reach a much wider audience than other industrial songs. as a synth lover, i really enjoyed this album. All Time Low is one of my favourite NIN songs, and has one of my favourite outros. however, i dont view HM as an album; it's a collection of very good tracks."

nin,3b70nr,xole,3,Fri Jun 26 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"Here's how I rank the NIN discography:   The Fragile TDS With Teeth HM PHM The Slip Year Zero   [Ghosts not ranked because I feel it's too different to compare]  My taste disagrees a lot with the average user in this sub beyond the top two albums. I love With Teeth and HM, think PHM sounds hella dated but still has some pretty good tracks for what it is, and couldn't care less about Year Zero. So take what I say with a grain of salt I guess.  I agree with what everyone's been saying about the album being a fantastic collection of songs versus a great collective album, but I don't feel like we're giving it enough credit. HM may not be as aggressive or biting as his other works, but in my mind it's easily the album where Trent branches out the most. Usually NIN is thick and layered to the point you can't re-listen to it without picking up on something you've never heard before. This album was more about stripping it all back, going for a minimalistic feel that is entirely being as naked possible. This is especially apparent on ""While I'm Still Here."" And it feels so much more vulnerable, like a kid sitting down and making music with just one looping machine.  It's not at all what people look for in NIN, but if you go into it hoping for something more like Chvrches at NPR Tiny Desk concerts, you'll get a much better listen out of it."

I was actually pretty disappointed when first I heard it, but after giving it a few more tries as well as catching the live show (which was fucking amazing, one of the best NIN shows I've seen), I definitely appreciated the album much more.

nin,3b70nr,Tristessa27,2,Fri Jun 26 23:28:13 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of NIN but honestly... it's kind of awful. I much preferred With Teeth or any of the other less popular albums. It's just a bit lame. All the songs sound like they were written by an NIN cover band or something.

I'm probably a bit younger than most of the folks here (18), so a lot of the NIN I first got into was post-fragile stuff. Don't get me wrong I love PHM, TDS, and the Fragile, but I like the newer stuff better."
nin,3b70nr,ComradeTWS,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"I think of Hesitation marks as the aftermath of a great storm. The storm being Trent's addiction, depression and such. These being topics that all of his albums dive into with the exception of year zero.   ... With the last track hinting that the chaos is still somewhat there."
nin,3b70nr,ImKindaHighBut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:49:53 2015 UTC,"IMHO, There's three versions of NIN:  There's Pretty Hate Machine NIN.  There's Broken all the way up to The Slip NIN.  and then there's Hesitation Marks NIN.  There's a cohesive sound in the middle, and the bookends are total departures from the rest of the discography.  Ghosts I-IV is just a pre-film scoring anomaly that probably shouldn't have been released under the NIN moniker.  I listen to the middle chunk all the time. I rarely listen to PHM or HM."

I think a lot of fans don't realize that they (and people in general) were MUCH easier to impress twenty years ago. That was three presidents ago.  All that life experience, education, and responsibility skews your perception, not to mention the various ways entertainment has evolved in these two decades.   Like you, I thought TDS was the be-all/end-all of musical endeavors, but I was 14 and had only been exposed to whatever was in rotation on MTV at that time.  I also didn't have access to every musical recording ever at my fingertips via the Internet.  If I heard it today for the first time, I'd probably write it off as some goth kid trying too hard to be scary."
nin,3b70nr,juskajo,0,Sat Jun 27 23:05:54 2015 UTC,Hesitation Marks is just an album I enjoy listening to while high. It has a very tasty and colorful feel to it that makes it a nice summer good v i b e s sesh type listen.  With that said though I don't consider Hesitation Marks to be canon NIN and that it exists outside of the universe of Nine Inch Nails. It's something that Trent from an alternate reality created and decided to share with us.   It's like ... What if Nine Inch Nails began in 2013 with Hesitation Marks in an alternate reality opposed to Trent of this dimension having started in 1989 with Pretty Hate Machine.
nin,3b6cbv,teleekom,11,Fri Jun 26 09:34:36 2015 UTC,"I read, and I cannot remember where, that Trent ""lost"" many physical copies of Manson's early recordings. Apparently it may have been a malicious loss after a fight.   Obviously, this is only what I've read and I have no idea how to confirm or deny it."
nin,3b6cbv,PersistenceOfLoss,6,Fri Jun 26 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"This is what I've also heard, and I believe it came from Manson himself, though I could be wrong. I think it was an answer given in relation to a remastered version of Antichrist Superstar ever being released and if not, then why."

nin,3b6cbv,Decepitos,12,Fri Jun 26 12:41:43 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the exact issue but it was basically Trent was a big factor in MM's success and once he was a household name, It became a ego struggle of who was the best.  Just two big egos that were both way to volatile to be able to work together long term.  As for Starfuckers (which is mentioned in the comments of MM's AMA), yes it is about MM and how he became an diva (in Trent's opinion). MM did however end up being in the music video because afterwards they briefly kissed and made up and MM agreed to be in it, which is one of my favorite NIN music video tid bit."
nin,3b6cbv,jimmyonc,4,Fri Jun 26 13:19:20 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot that the song was about Courtney Love. I do think the line ""I bet you think this song is about you"" was about MM though."
nin,3b6cbv,HCPwny,7,Fri Jun 26 19:22:51 2015 UTC,"""You're so vain, I bet you think this song is about you"" is a straight reference to the song 'You're So Vain' by Carly Simon for which it is the chorus. I don't know if he had someone specific in mind when he used that particular reference or if it was targeting a specific kind of person that the song was supposed to be about, it seems like a bit of a leap in logic that he used someone else's lyrics to refer to a personal argument. Although if the whole song (Starfuckers) is actually about MM I guess it makes sense.     EDIT: Fun fact - MM himself and Queens of the Stone Age both adapted/covered the song as well."
nin,3b6cbv,UlquiorraSchiffer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:29:57 2015 UTC,"I always took that line to be the most ironic and telling of the whole song.   By quoting Carley Simons ""You're so vain"" lyrics, he's telling whoever he's singing to that they're not even worth his effort in creating new lyrics.   It would seem lazy and easy to resort to plagiarism, but that's the whole point. The real message, for me, was that they weren't even worth finishing the song for. That he couldn't be bothered to write a song against MM, and another about Courtney Love, but instead will write 80% of a song and make them both ""think this song is about [them]""   Just how I've always interpreted the use of those lyrics in that song..."
nin,3b6cbv,Black__lotus,3,Sat Jun 27 07:27:45 2015 UTC,Trent said the whole song is supposed to be ridiculous and not taken seriously.
nin,3b6cbv,whativebeenhiding,2,Sat Jun 27 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"You have a source on that?   ""You start out thinking you can change the world, but when cool people at clubs who wouldn't even talk to me were like, 'Whoah,he's got a platinum album, who's that guy?' It was strange. I realised that the guys who beat me up in high-school were now in my audience. Money, fame, power - things I'd never had - those things are recipies for massive personality distortion. In my life I was standing on the edge of a cliff about to jump off because my brain wasn't working. After 'The Downward Spiral' I felt like I had to make the best record in the world but my addictions meant my head was packed with cotton. 'Starfuckers, Inc.' doesn't fit in with the rest of that record, but it came from bits of lyrics I'd written over a long period and was focused at Marilyn Manson and Courtney Love. I'm not saying I haven't fallen prey to this at times, but I think in their environment your priorities can totally flip before you realise.""   Cause this seems to confirm that its focus is MM and CL, and he only says it ""doesn't fit in with the rest of that record""   Either way, my interpretation still stands up.  Edit: come to think of it, why would Trent write a song he thinks is ridiculous and not to be taken seriously, and include it on an album like the Fragile, if not to highlight his distaste for the songs subjects.   Basically he's saying ""my ode to you is shitty and plagiarized"" reinforcing the idea that they're not worth his effort."
nin,3b6cbv,Black__lotus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"From the Spin 99 album of the year article :  While Reznor is tight-lipped about their falling out, his fun, machine-driven version of John Lennon's McCartney kiss-off, ""How Can You Sleep,"" makes it pretty clear how he feels.   ""There was an element of thuggery that we wanted to keep in,"" Reznor says of the song. ""There was a sense of humor though the whole tying. We were laughing when we were doing it, like, this riff is totally ridiculous. We took the crowd noise from Frampton Comes Al�."" He laughs. ""Oh, I shouldn't say where we got that from.""   Not that it's not about those two clowns, and the state of music in the late nineties, just that it's not really as serious as some people like to imagine."
nin,3b6cbv,whativebeenhiding,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:42:08 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, you're only reinforcing my point. He's telling the two of them, my ode to you is shitty, ridiculous, and plagiarized. You're not even worth my full creative effort, is how I basically see the whole song.  It's pretty much always been my interpretation. Trent covers songs, such as dead souls, or metal, but actually ripping off other artists in his creative work struck me as odd. One could argue that the lyrics ""copy of a copy of a copy"" are ripped off from Chuck Palaniuck's Fight Club, but to me that seems more fitting and self referential, as Chuck had TDS on repeat the entire time he wrote that novel. I always took the USE of those lyrics alone to be an insult to the songs subject, in more ways then how Carley Simon sang it."

I'm always drawn in by strange songs like this only included on certain types of a release or in singles, in this case the cassette version of The Fragile. Appendage seems, to me at least, to be a much more fitting track than its host, Please. Please is one of my low-lights for the right side of The Fragile; it's straightforward and relatively shallow when compared to songs like The Big Come Down and Underneath It All. However, Appendage is much more characteristic of the album's darker half in its complexity and strangeness. It's brooding, harsh, and structured very interestingly. For the life of me I don't know why this wasn't included on every release of the album. I think the right side would do well to include Appendage, 10 Miles High, and The New Flesh.

I don't even think three political figures are part of the ""NIN community."" Maybe they really are huge fans. No idea if TR knows or cares and maybe he doesn't.  Given that a fan group on Facebook was contacted by TR's lawyers regarding trademark infringement over printing some t-shirts, I can't imagine those same lawyers wouldn't address this. Trademarks require defending: if you let others use them without actively and purposely telling them to stop, then you can lose the right to use the trademark.  Gary Talpas, if he still owns the copyright, also has a copyright claim. He might have sold it to Trent or Nothing or some other company owned by Trent, in which case, Trent has a copyright claim. He may not go after that, but the trademark claim is much more serious from a legal standpoint.  Can't understand at all that a mayor of a major world city thinking this was a good idea. Notley (Canadian Premier)  has done it before too - ""Notley Crue."""

Just hearing it reminds me of such an awesome time."
nin,3avx4k,Jonr1138,2,Wed Jun 24 18:42:10 2015 UTC,Best song from Hesitation Marks for sure and it was rightfully a staple in 13'/14' live shows and I think (if there ever will be) future shows will surely have this one as well.
nin,3avx4k,teleekom,2,Tue Jun 23 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"I listen to this song literally every day. There is so much layering in this song that every other week I swear hear something I hadn't heard before, or rotate focus on a different level of syncopation. I can feel this song in my fingers when I exercise. The live versions are so full of energy, and I love it's use as an opener and the visual/conceptual homage to 'Stop Making Sense'. It is by miles my favorite NIN song."
nin,3avx4k,Zaragoza09,4,Wed Jun 24 21:47:32 2015 UTC,Love it as an opener for their shows! Was really bummed when they opened with Somewhat Damaged in Tampa. Nothing comes close to Halloween in Orlando a few years back when I got to see them for the first time. 26 songs kicking off with this one made it one of the best shows I've ever seen. The effects for this song in particular are just phenomenal at introducing you to what type of concert you're about to see.

I remember seeing Trent onstage for the first time and being so blown away in the moment that it was really happening, haha.  I also saw the West Palm and Tampa shows last year and was thrilled to see Somewhat Damaged open the show but then again I'd just seen Copy of a open the night before."

nin,3aroao,DasQBert,6,Mon Jun 22 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of sounds that I think became common place or acceptable thanks to NIN that just wasn't common at all before. Even shitty pop music makes use of distortion elements now and pre-NIN who else that was even close to mainstream was really doing that a whole lot?  But beyond NIN's influence, which I think is much more influential in an approach to production and sound design which is harder to necessarily point a finger at direct influences and spot, but is arguably more important than just clear musical influence, I think Trent and Atticus' scoring has already had a huge impact on the film score scene.  Ever since TSN came out there's been a massive amount of film trailers and entire scores heavily emulating and attempting to recapture that Reznor/Ross magic. I remember a lot of people mentioning how elements of Captain America 2's music was very Trent-influenced to a fault almost. His work on film scoring has definitely altered that landscape and blown the doors open for less traditional approaches of scoring, with far more electronic and ambient film scores becoming commonplace ever since. The big orchestral score is still the main thing, for sure, and for good reason, but things are definitely much more experimental now.  Oh, and funny enough, before Trent had even been involved in film scoring, Akira Yamaoka, the amazing artist who produced the score to almost all the Silent Hill games and wrote some of my favorite pieces I've ever heard (Theme of Laura is beyond incredible) said from the start that NIN was probably the biggest influence on his approach to music and sound.  Trent's work has encouraged an experimental and much more daring approach to music since NIN started and while a lot of shit like Fred Durst got inspired by the more obvious elements of NIN, plenty of nuanced and incredible music has come out that's definitely been willing to play around with sound, dive in to deeper and stranger places, sample heavier, use distortion as a tool, and layer sound in a way that makes great headphones/speaker setups worth it. There's an ""all the way or not at all"" approach to Trent's music and production that has gone on to inspire a lot of work out there, and music is better for it."
nin,3aroao,kleiner352,6,Tue Jun 23 00:55:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this. The only thing I believe is the biggest downside to all this is that so many people don't recognize this, let alone know him.   Your average person may have heard Closer at some point, but not know who it's by. It's understandable, but it's kind of sad in regards to his influence."
nin,3aroao,thefirdblu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:12:41 2015 UTC,"Just a brief note here since I am on mobile, I think NIN definitely made the space for other artists to have a spot and a prime example would be Linkin Park. Their music isn't for me, I don't think it's terribly good, but it means a lot to their fans and I wouldn't want to take away anything from someone if it helps them.  Lots of kids, like my nephew, got into NIN because of LP. Like I said, I'm not a fan of their music, but people being able to find more of the music that helps them live is a good thing."
nin,3aroao,BrianEvol,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:59:18 2015 UTC,"In terms of the sole genre of industrial music, no one incredibly notable has been able to do what NIN did. I've heard so many copycat projects without any delivery as close to what NIN did. But NIN is still an influence to cross genres including some Technical Death Metal with industrial influences, and hip hop including Death Grips, Clipping and Kanye's Yeezus. Also I heard that The Weeknd and FKA Twigs are Reznor fans and I hear some industrial sounds in their music as well."
nin,3anhe1,SymmetryOfOrigin,12,Sun Jun 21 23:13:57 2015 UTC,Favorite song ever from NIN. It's so melancholy and powerful. Plus the way the lyrics are delivered is amazing.

nin,3anhe1,ChubbyKingOfNowhere,4,Mon Jun 22 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"To me, this song is the calm before the storm of ""Zero-Sum,"" when the Presence cracks open the sky and tears the earth apart - and nobody can do anything to stop it. An angry cry from someone that wishes things had gone differently."
nin,3anhe1,MrSelfDestruckt,3,Mon Jun 22 05:49:14 2015 UTC,Fantastic song. The emotion is just aching to break through every second of the song.   The version on the remixed album is even better imo. A little more surreal and tragic.
nin,3anhe1,fuzzbunny21,3,Mon Jun 22 01:04:23 2015 UTC,"This song is amazing.  It's so intense and is my holy grail of live NIN tracks now that I've heard Hurt/Burn/I'm Afraid of Americans (which I know wasn't a TR song, but c'mon that's a sweet song to hear live).   It's one of the first tracks of NIN that's hooked me from first listen and every damn time I hear it, it gets me. Definitely a top five track of all time which seems to be the prevailing opinion here."

If Netflix was free for 3 months would actors/directors/etc. be pissed about giving away free movies?  It's not like Apple is dropping every album in their library on everyone's iPhone to keep like they did with U2.  It's renting music.

nin,3anp3p,corney91,4,Mon Jun 22 02:16:15 2015 UTC,Apple wasn't going to pay the artists for the free months but would pay more once the trial's over. I'd guess Netflix pay for licensing regardless of whether a customer us using the free trial or is paying.

It's a bit more stripped down, until you hit the chorus, but that's not a bad thing.  Tracks 1-6 just really flow well from one to the next.  And appendage is awesome, and I wish it'd made the cd mix.  Guess I need to go find that hq vinyl rip everyone keep mentioning."

nin,3afg2m,illmatic2112,16,Sat Jun 20 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"NIN and QOTSA are two of my favorite music acts of all time. Queens have a signature style to them. Josh and Trent both take rock music to different levels, and I find that amazing. ...Like Clockwork is probably their best work. If it's second to anything, it would probably be Songs For The Deaf. That's not to say their other stuff isn't fantastic either. Era Vulgaris takes a lot of risks and dabbles in a grungey garage rock tone that has lyrical themes that satirize modern culture. Lullabies To Paralyze takes the form of a really weird dream with it's darker tone in contrast to other stuff. I'd say the Desert Sessions are worth a listen as well for anyone who wants to get into Josh's more desert rock oriented stuff.   TL;DR: Queens of the stone age kick ass"
nin,3afg2m,mcmahon212,7,Fri Jun 19 20:27:58 2015 UTC,"I saw NiN and QOTSA together in the same concert last year in Auckland. Fucking amazing show.

nin,3afg2m,NateCadmus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:11:36 2015 UTC,They are my 2 fav bands. I went to all 3 shows. NIN was better at all 3.
nin,3afg2m,fraktured,8,Wed Jul 1 04:39:22 2015 UTC,"Queens are pretty fantastic. Whilst they haven't spanned as many genre's as TR has, they've definitely constantly mixed up their style across every one of their releases, from psychedelic/desert rock, to much more harder sounding rock, to taking themes like witchcraft and demons, to going to a weird but catchy as hell caustic sound, and finally settling at the serene ...Like Clockwork. All the while though, you can still hear echoes of their past works in each of their newer releases, even dating back to Homme's work with The Desert Sessions (Helps that some QOTSA songs are rerecordings of songs from that era). Some people see some of their work as pretty ""radio rock"", which I can totally get given how accessible their work is, though I do think most of their songs really balance out that accessibility with a sense of actually complex instrumentation or emotion, No One Knows being a pretty prime example. Some of their deeper cuts get really crazy too, You Can't Quit Me, Baby, and Someone's In The Wolf being notable lengthy and enjoyable ballads. I got into them after exhausting the existing NIN catalogue, and gradually found myself becoming pleasantly surprised with what I found, and I recommend anyone interested in the band who hasn't given them a shot already to check out Songs For The Deaf and see what you think.

nin,3afg2m,comiclover1377,4,Sat Jun 20 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"Saw them open for NIN in 2005 (Oakland) and they put on a great show.  I had seen them before so not surprised, but the combination of QOTSA and NIN was both diverse while still ""fitting"" together musically.  One of my favorite bands."
nin,3afg2m,porradavfr,3,Fri Jun 19 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"I gotta thank NIN for touring with these dudes last year. First experience of QOTSA was live and that was almost too perfect. Quickly became one of my most favourite bands. Hearing The Vampyre of Time and Memory for the first time at the concert blew me away, and my dad happened to have all their albums (save ...Like Clockwork) so I just ripped all the CDs and listened to them on repeat until I figured out my favourite albums and all that.   Josh is a hell of a guy. Gotta love his work."
nin,3afg2m,ninger6,3,Sat Jun 20 07:25:05 2015 UTC,"Easily my favorite band of all time.   It's worth mentioning the QOTSA collaborations with Trent: Kalopsia (from ...Like Clockwork), and You Know What You Did (also known as Era Vulgaris, it was a b-side from the Era Vulgaris sessions). It's a funny thing, but both songs took me quite a while to recognize that they were actually duets between Josh and Trent. I really hope they do an entire project together some day."

Josh chastised a security guy for making a woman get off some guy's shoulders and they just kept playing. Massive animations and visuals projected on some big banners, the ""If I Had a Tail"" video played behind them as they played the song, it was brand new and instantly comfortable to me. No forced feelings at all.  I was really interested afterward. Still need to work through their discography."

I remember hearing broken (on cassette!) and being surprised how wildly different it was from PHM. And yet I couldn't put it down, either. The electronic was still there (maybe buried a bit), but in a much more sinister form. This guy was clearly going places! :)  Also, shout out to the movie The Cabin In The Woods, for using it over the closing credits.

nin,3aasfd,DasQBert,10,Thu Jun 18 16:17:56 2015 UTC,I saw NIN and Soundgarden 3 times on last summers tour. I think they put on a great act and IMO had a better set list for the tour than NIN did. They were touring for the 20th anniversary of Superunknown and TDS. There were too many new songs for NIN set list where as SG played mostly from Superunknown. Idk I felt that 4-5 new songs was a bit much for a nostalgia tour. Luckily the first of the 3 shows I saw them had this amazing set list. http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nine-inch-nails/2014/susquehanna-bank-center-camden-nj-63c14e93.html

nin,3aasfd,gobol,3,Thu Jun 18 21:19:49 2015 UTC,"I bought the first Audioslave album when I was in grade 10 because I loved Rage. I think its a pretty strong album, and I was amazed at Chris' vocal abilities. He really belts it on that album.  Then I saw some live recordings of them... and wow was he awful.   Then, I saw him perform with Soundgarden in 2014 with NIN, and he sounded amazing live.   I don't know what the hell is going on but I can't tell if Chris Cornell is actually a good singer or not.   It appears he sounds great on recording, great live, but anytime someone records a live performance it comes off as awful. He is like a vampire and mirrors, you just can't seem to capture his live form on film."
nin,3aasfd,beartheminus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"I've seen Cornell with Audioslave, solo electric (Projekt Revolution), solo acoustic (Hangout Festival 2012) and Soundgarden (NIN tour).  He's aged well, and while not a mesmerizing frontman, can still sing the songs with authority."
nin,3aasfd,aeo8712,4,Sat Jun 27 08:27:52 2015 UTC,"The new Soundgarden songs are .. weird. Modern production techniques mean perfect recordings - which is great for electronic music - but awful for many alt-rock bands. The 'raw' energy they had in old releases are frankly lost. ""Black Rain"" had some of that, I suppose, and I enjoyed it. But King Animal was a step in the wrong direction. Production makes or breaks songwriting.  Cornell's best work, IMO, was as a part of Temple of the Dog - beautiful and passionate album. It may be one of the best albums ever recorded by anyone, ever.  As a singer - I put him above Mercury and Plant. He may not have been as influential, but his range and belting is deadly.  And.. his solo career and Audioslave did nothing for me."
nin,3aasfd,Pinwurm,5,Thu Jun 18 18:34:40 2015 UTC,"I respect him as a singer.. but that's about it. His music do nothing for me really. There are some good Soundgarden songs, but the rest of it is so so unimaginative and uninteresting. It's like the typical radio friendly 90's rock song kind of music.   This acoustic grunge shit is good tho"
nin,3aasfd,teleekom,2,Thu Jun 18 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"Chris Cornell is my favorite singer of all time. I'll admit his voice is dying out. I saw him on the summer tour last year. For his age, I guess it's pretty good that he can't hit most of his stuff, but the way he comes off now is a little screechy but still sounds alright. At least he isn't like David Lee Roth who's off time and off key with everything. Cornell has a very distinct voice in rock music and will never be forgotten."

I Do Not Want This is The Downward Spiral's midpoint, and conceptually the final moment before the protagonist and the album descends into ultimate fury and rage in Big Man With a Gun before mellowing out. I Do Not Want This stands out to me with its pure, industrial percussion. The interplay between the shouted chorus and the cold, calculated talking always struck me as vaguely beautiful. It's a difficult song it to get into, that's for sure, but worthwhile. It's not my favorite track on the album, but it's also not my least favorite. It's solid and stands as a perfect miniature representation of The Downward Spiral as a whole."

It's still sort of low  on my list of favorite TDS songs, but the album wouldn't be the same without I Do Not Want This where it is."
nin,3a6ec6,DasQBert,16,Wed Jun 17 16:15:56 2015 UTC,"I realized a few year ago that NIN and Tool are the only two music acts that have survived the decades, where I was there from the start (in my mid-40's). I first saw NIN live a few months after the release of PHM opening for Jesus and Mary Chain. I was listening to PHM as I drove to the concert, but following their set I was instantly converted from casual to rabid fan. Same with Tool. I saw then open for Henry Rollins and was sold two songs in.   I offer that for perspective. I love Tool and they are, in my opinion, far superior to NIN as collective musicans. That being said, more over than loving NIN, I love Trent Reznor. He is a personal hero and one of my only true living idols. He puts his heart into his music, revealing fears and frailty so personal and real that it felt it was my life he sang about.     My thoughts on MJK is that he is a narcissistic prick, albeit one motherfucking brilliant genius of a narcissistic prick. Ultimately though I feel he's in it for him. He writes brilliant songs that provoke the mind and pushes one towards an examination of their place on this plane we call reality. But when I've been depressed, feeling like I don't want to exist at all, Tool was not where I turned to understand it all.   I met Trent once at an autograph signing for Natural Born Killers video release. I shook his hand and told him he'd saved my life. I could tell my sentiments meant something to him. I also met MJK at a Caduceus wine autograph signing. He was surrounded by security and preoccupied with his cell phone between fans.   As musicians they may be worthy of comparison, but as human beings Trent towers like a giant above MJK."
nin,3a6ec6,DisConform,11,Wed Jun 17 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right on narcissistic prick. I was at an APC show and the human water bed beside me had a camera. Maynard stopped the show pointed me out, and I got yanked off out to a staging area. As I was sitting there the camera went off again and it was proven it wasn't me. So I got to go back despite missing 2 songs."
nin,3a6ec6,anxdiety,5,Wed Jun 17 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"I would say I'm a fan of his work. Tool is just great, a very creative sort of metal. I love ""Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums"" by A Perfect Circle on an ungodly level, and ""The Humbling River"" by Puscifer is definitely one of my top favorite songs of all time, but there isn't much else by Puscifer that I enjoy."
nin,3a6ec6,SteppingSplash,5,Wed Jun 17 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"Tool remains my second favorite band, one space above Nine Inch Nails. It's a top tier metal band with sweeping tracks, unbeatable vitriol, and the best singing I'm aware of (both lyrically and vocally). Maynard is a master of his craft, perfectly bridging the gap between grounded, conventional singing and more emotional vocalizations. It's a fine line to tread on the edge of sounding whiny or childish, but Maynard achieves it perfectly. Not once does he topple over into the realm of shrill, yet his pitch is generally higher than the norm. It's a feat that he recreates live on a regular basis. The screaming and the melodies combine into an unbeatable storm of intriguing noises that mixes seamlessly with Danny's drumming, Adam's masterful guitar work, and Justin's interesting bass manipulations.  As far as his other projects go, A Perfect Circle has some good and some bad moments. Puscifer is very strange, but generally enjoyable."
nin,3a6ec6,Reinmann,3,Wed Jun 17 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"Undertow is just one awesome album, and probably the best display of his screaming/yelling. On Bottom, he's essentially yelling the whole time, it's insane, and he sounds perfect."

nin,3a5j89,Ludogsonthemoon,5,Wed Jun 17 12:05:35 2015 UTC,Yes.
nin,3a5j89,revglenn,5,Wed Jun 17 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"why? WHY? why does everyone keep harping on this? trent himself said that it just wasn't very good. a few other people did as well. and TR and MJK weren't even the main drivers behind the project. They just happen to be involved.  But seriously, the general consensous is that it never went anyware because it kind of sucked, so why do NIN fans keep harping on this shit SIXTEEN DAMN YEARS LATER?  seriously, i know MJK and TR are both amazing musicians in their own right, but that doesn't mean that they have chemistry as part of a team, especially when they're not the band leaders. Just because great musicians do something in a room together doesn't make the music automatically great.   GIVE IT UP GUYS! THE DREAM IS DEAD, AND IT WASN'T EVEN WORTH REMEMBERING!"
nin,3a5j89,totallywhatever,2,Wed Jun 17 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"Considering the only thing we heard from Tapeworm was ""Vacant"", I think it's safe to assume the rest was not spectacular."

nin,3a5j89,nascentia,8,Wed Jun 17 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear what would come of him working with John Murphy (he did the scores for Sunshine, 28 Days Later, and Armored, to name a few.) I think the two of them could make some bad-ass music together.  I wouldn't mind seeing Clint Mansell and Trent work together again, too. On a much more collaborative scale. I know they did some work on The Fragile together, but imagine the two of them as equals for an album. It would be fucking incredible."
nin,3a5j89,whativebeenhiding,2,Wed Jun 17 16:42:32 2015 UTC,What did Clint do on the Fragile? Dos Dedos is one of my favorite albums.
nin,3a5j89,teleekom,7,Sat Jun 20 13:00:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, I think it would challenge Trent to do something else musically. I do have a feeling that they kinda find their own sound and they are (maybe too much?) comfortable with it - Ghosts, HTDA, Hesitation Marks, Social Network, GWTDT, Gone Girl; I'm not saying these all sound the same, but they have the same feel and atmosphere. And Trent said many times he likes to challenge himself, I think this is one way how to do it.  As far as who, I have no idea. I was gonna say I wouldn't like someone like Rick Rubin, but he actually did With Teeth with Trent, so I don't know. James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem could be interesting combo"
nin,3a5j89,Zaragoza09,5,Wed Jun 17 12:21:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Live 2013 band would be great to work with if they actually came up with music together. Like seriously Trent, Alessandro, Josh, and Ilan could come up with a serious electronica mindfuck."

nin,3a5j89,MrCallahan,4,Wed Jun 17 14:41:18 2015 UTC,"There's a couple people I'd love to see him work with, two in particular that have a history with NIN.   Danny Lohner, and Clint Mansell.   Danny has produced some pretty good stuff over the years! And his remixes of others work usually ends up being better than the original. This might be a ship that's already sailed, since he's worked plenty with NIN already, but I would definitely welcome more colab work between these two.  Clint has grown into a score machine, his musical scores are amazing, would love to see how that would combine with some work with Trent in today's world."
nin,3a5j89,seven-ends,6,Wed Jun 17 17:24:56 2015 UTC,Clint Mansell is exactly of whom I was thinking. Think of the Fountain Soundtrack meets The Social Network Soundtrack. That would blow my mind.
nin,3a5j89,ninfan200,3,Wed Jun 17 18:59:05 2015 UTC,I wonder what lohner is up to these days
nin,3a5j89,theOPIATE,2,Wed Jun 17 17:47:59 2015 UTC,"Clint Mansell is also likely to bring at least one track with Kronos Quartet, so lets put that in the Strengths corner of the SWOT board."
nin,3a5j89,kyleclements,4,Wed Jun 17 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Trent and Alessandro work together on something.  Sonoio has released some awesome stuff, and I think those two would have a good working relationship, they both seem like huge gear nerds who can still see past the tech stuff, not get distracted by it, and give synthesizers a soul."
nin,3a5j89,htlr,3,Wed Jun 17 19:27:21 2015 UTC,"he could make some crazy good stuff with autechre or aphex twin. they could help him go even deeper into the idm-tinged style he's had since ghosts. also, he's had oneohtrix point never remix one of his tracks and it was stellar. would love to see more of him with trent."
nin,3a5j89,elementroejoy,3,Wed Jun 17 16:50:06 2015 UTC,I read that for Hesitation Marks he tried going outside of his usual collaborators. He didn't really dig it and reverted back. I think it's in the 'conversation with trent reznor' that was released with the iTunes version of HM

nin,3a5j89,sc0ttius,3,Wed Jun 17 13:28:06 2015 UTC,That would be pretty good. I'd like to see Trent work with some unique guitarists like Justin Beck from Glassjaw or Teppei Teranishi from Thrice. They both have a level of creativity and skill that would give Trent some interesting source material to work with outside what he's had in the past. He's not really worked with anyone that has emerged post-2000s other than Ilan Rubin (whose individual projects are decent but nothing compared to the calibre of the two I listed above).
nin,3a5j89,haatee,2,Wed Jun 17 15:14:44 2015 UTC,I would personally love to see Trent  and Alec Empire  team up for an album. Intelligence and Sacrifice is my favourite AE album and it would be awesome  to hear both of their many musical flavours combine into whatever the fuck it ends up sounding like!

I wish Trent would do lots of collaborations with different artists, even if just a song or two for a soundtrack or just releasing it as a single.  I was bummed when Eric Avery backed out of touring with NIN.  I was hoping that they would've collaborated on tour and come up with some cool stuff."

I'd be interested to see what Amon Tobin could do with Trent. That would be super cool."
nin,3a5j89,yorgle,2,Fri Jun 19 12:54:46 2015 UTC,Fred Durst.  It would be completely unexpected.

nin,3a3r3c,speedlimits65,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:19:03 2015 UTC,"One of the few NIN songs that doesn't sound good live. The repetitive nature of the song means only the clarity of the studio recording brings out the interesting subtle sounds that change it up, while they just sound weak in front of an audience. Doesn't help that the singing lacks intensity (not that it's a bad thing, as it fits the song). The track itself is great, fun and chill by NIN standards."
nin,3a3r3c,ChubbyKingOfNowhere,2,Wed Jun 17 04:37:09 2015 UTC,That's funny because the rehearsal version is the only version I'll listen to.

nin,3a1a55,atb77,3,Wed Jun 17 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yup- a testament to musical ingenuity. I didn't know that anything like that could exist in music. As the author points out, the relevance is still there. It stands up after all of this time. I became a musician because of NIN- and at my age I'm still finding my voice- and to look back and see that he was in his 20s when he made his first three records- it's dumbfounding."

nin,3a1a55,Neptulius,9,Tue Jun 16 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"I think when TDS came out, I was wayy too young, like 10. So it was very edgy and I was big into MTV so I was into the shock value. And then when I was like 18, in 2003 there was that big return to Rock music, so I was out of the loop with NIN. But sometime in college I got reacquainted and every time I give TDS a spin, I appreciate something different about it."

Certainly as someone who has also gotten older, not as angry as I was as a young man, and am now in a long term loving relationship... I understand and identify the musical transition he made to HTDA.  I know there are all types of NIN fans, but it's hard for me to imagine that someone that has followed Trent as long as we have doesn't ""get"" that HTDA is a reflection of how much he's healed as a person and an artist."

Right up at the top I said, ""I know there a lots of different types of NIN fans."" If HTDA is where you depart the Reznor train, I give zero fucks.  You have to understand I've been listening to so-called NIN fans bitch and moan about how Trent has ""changed"" and ""sold out"" since Pretty Hate Machine. PHM fans HATED Broken, becuase what they really wanted was more dark synth pop. Broken fans HATED Downward Spiral, because they wanted more screaming rage metal.

As far as his favorite work with NIN, it would definitely be You Know What You Are for me. Drumming in this song is just insane.   I was quite interested in Sonic Highways after Wasting Light, which was spectacular album, but SH was bit of a let down to be honest. The accompanying documentary was cool though.    On the other hand, I gotta say I'm having a feeling that music news are bit oversaturated with Dave Grohl news. And that's nothing against him personally, but this ""last true rockstar"" narrative I'm getting from entertainment outlets is getting tiring after a while. Yeah he's super nice and cool, but I really don't need to know absolutely everything this guy does and everything that he has to say.

Here's Dave doing QOTSA's Avon but his drum solo is much better than the album version (this I know, because I can actually do the album solo easily whereas I'd have to sit and really figure out how to nail his). Here is a quick jump to the solo and here is the original album one by a different drummer"
nin,3a1ym4,NateCadmus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"I love his charisma, and the sound city doco was awesome I really enjoyed watching that. I've never really been a fan or gotten into much at all of Foo Fighters but I won't hate it if someone puts it on.   But yeah I think he seems like an awesome dude and I thank him for his contribution on With Teeth and Songs For The Deaf, not to mention Mantra is a pretty decent song to chill out to."
nin,3a1ym4,chronicintel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"Grohl has laid down some of my favourite drum tracks in history. Everyday is Exactly the Same, New Fang, and In Bloom.  He's no John Bonham (of course, no one could ever be), but he's a fucking solid drummer, singer, and guitarist."
nin,39zm0n,SymmetryOfOrigin,7,Tue Jun 16 01:57:56 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite songs that I can belt out in the car while cruising.  Such a good one.  When I was younger and not really into NIN, I disliked the song cause I heard it on the radio all the time, but I never really paid attention to it, and I thought the sound wasn't that great.  Man was I ever wrong.  Now it's my 2nd favorite song after Where Is Everybody.  It is a quintessential NIN song simply because of the lyrics.  So many recurring themes appear in this song, and concepts that are core to everything that is NIN."
nin,39zm0n,HCPwny,3,Tue Jun 16 02:49:56 2015 UTC,"I used to love this song, but this purest feeling, it wasn't meant to last. I think it might suck."
nin,39zm0n,josethematador,3,Tue Jun 16 03:14:15 2015 UTC,"When I was younger   I got into NIN at the age of 13, and Only was the song that did it. This was about two months after With Teeth's release.  My older sister, who suggested it, then gave me their entire discography at that point and now we've seen NIN live twice.  Best decision she ever made."
nin,39zm0n,iamthehomunculus,3,Tue Jun 16 14:26:42 2015 UTC,It's one of those songs that has to hit you at the right point in your life. It was definitely on repeat at one point but now I hardly play it.
nin,39zm0n,MakesEthanol,2,Tue Jun 16 04:21:53 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, when I was younger it was my favourite song but I haven't even listened to With Teeth in ages at this point in time."

nin,39y9ze,HCPwny,6,Mon Jun 15 19:50:10 2015 UTC,OP everything you said is true for me and I don't know what I would have done if not for Trent. The Fragile has managed to talk me off the ledge twice. It means something to me in which not other album or work of art can. And coincidentally I was listening to The Way Out is Through as I read this. That song is pretty much a huge motivation for me to keep going through life's struggles.
nin,39y9ze,Stea1thFTW18,2,Mon Jun 15 20:41:41 2015 UTC,"I want to get a TWOIT tattoo of some kind eventually, as that song has been major motivation in my own life as well.  Not going to until I've got the perfect concept for it though.  Text is too simple, so I've got to think of a way to embody that song through imagery."
nin,39y9ze,thefirdblu,3,Wed Jun 17 03:29:09 2015 UTC,"I understand wholeheartedly what you mean. I agree, as well. But there are components of his musicality, lyricism, and character that I (honestly) believe would shine through even if he had died. And really, I think it boils down to how visceral, tight, and brutally open his writing is capable of being.   That's where NIN has always outshined other bands for me. Trent's been able to rip open scabs, sew them shut, and re-open them when the time was right; all so we could have some fun. Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, maybe I'm not. He isn't the best writer, but he is definitely one of, if not, the best at what he knows and does.  Some of the spirituality and morbid glimmer of hope would be gone, but had he given in, man would his music be so much darker."
nin,39y9ze,i_am_hathor,2,Mon Jun 15 20:06:04 2015 UTC,"Your note about how he's been able to rip open scabs, sew them shut, and re-open them, is totally accurate.  I've always felt that the point of NIN is that even when you tear yourself apart inside, you can always fix it.  You can always find a new reason to keep going, or a new perspective to keep you honest.  If he died, I feel like a lot of that meaning would be gone.  It would be about losing hope never to get it back, instead of moving past it and looking back on it in a way that makes you glad to not be in that place anymore, but still honest enough to realize that there were parts of it that you liked."
nin,39y9ze,Reinmann,4,Mon Jun 15 20:53:34 2015 UTC,hesitation marks helped me overcome suicidal feelings
nin,39y9ze,Tattered_Colours,6,Tue Jun 16 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"If Trent were to have killed himself or died tragically directly after The Fragile we would have another Nirvana situation on our hands. Sure, it's great and inspirational for fans that he has survived and sobered, but Nine Inch Nails would be exponentially more popular and well-known if he had died. There's no good way to say it, but tragedy thrills the populace. I have no doubt that Nine Inch Nails would have become one of the most talked about bands in history with such a perfect discography (PHM, Broken, TDS, and The Fragile) and with a violent endcap.  Don't get me wrong, I don't want this at all. It's just what I think would have happened given other examples."
nin,39y9ze,Reinmann,2,Mon Jun 15 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"Here's a thought: assuming Trent died after The Fragile, what would be different about the films he scored for Fincher? I mean, aside from the fact that the score would sound different. Would the films have a different feel to them? Would they even have done as well? Would Fincher be a less relevant film maker in modern cinema?"
nin,39y9ze,Tattered_Colours,2,Tue Jun 16 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think its far fetched to imagine that Fincher would have potentially made some very different films had Reznor not been around.  Reznor is incredibly influential to many artists.  Let's not forget the book Fight Club was written while listening to The Downward Spiral on repeat, so Fincher right away is being influenced by Trent Reznor in the making of the film adaptation of said book.  There's also probably a good reason why Fincher and Reznor work together on music videos and such.  To the poster below - Why do you think they would be the same?  Soundtracks are not an afterthought.  Soundtracks are very much a part of the integral formation of a movie.  While they may not have the exacts down at the start, soundtrack plays a huge role in every aspect of a film's creation.  In the case of Gone Girl, Reznor's soundtrack provided a brilliant accompaniment to the film.  It was so subtle and set the tone for the entire thing all the way through, in a way that was never distracting, never the focus of the scene, and never obnoxious.  Soundtracks can make or break a movie.  He's also been involved in some way in far more of Fincher's films than I realized.  http://popdust.com/2011/05/31/trent-reznor-and-david-fincher-16-years-of-weird-and-wonderful-collaboration/"
nin,39y9ze,Reinmann,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:10:42 2015 UTC,They would be exactly the same save for the soundtrack. Fincher is a great movie maker by himself and Trent has no experience in the field aside from music.

nin,39ygik,ninfan200,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:02:27 2015 UTC,"I did a poster for them years ago - at this point, they'd been around for several years and the singer had been replaced.   They were known for being insane live.   ""Meh. They'll probably be boring""  4 seconds into their set, I got punched in the throat by someone! That's how much carnal energy they incite. I was pretty far from the stage, but in their first notes, everyone's limbs just flailed immediately."
nin,39ygik,angryblue,4,Wed Jun 17 13:06:33 2015 UTC,I'd say if you are a general NIN fan then start with Ire Works. Very NIN inspired album with some tracks that sound so similar in style that I have to double check what I am listening to haha.
nin,39ygik,alaub1491,4,Mon Jun 15 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"DEP first came to my attention because they, along with Mike Patton, did an amazing cover of Aphex Twin's ""Come to Daddy."" I can honestly say that was about all my exposure to them. I did get to see them play with NiN at Bonnaroo and it was just amazing."
nin,39ygik,ShoegazingStardust,4,Mon Jun 15 23:07:01 2015 UTC,I wish I had seen them perform together live. I heard by the end of it all their instruments were somewhat damaged. In one of the videos Trent dove into the drums like he was lacking all discipline. I'm just glad nobody got hurt.

I'd would say start with Miss Machine and the go from there, but you really can't go wrong with any of the albums that Greg sings on. Not to take anything away Dimitri or the EP with Mike Patton, I just prefer Greg. Also if you can see them live I highly recommend it. Will say when I saw them open for NIN/Soundgarden I was one of the few people going nuts! People were looking at me like I was an idiot and I didn't care! It was awesome!"

I think the album is best listened from start to finish. It's really, really abrasive, and then opens up to very melodic, clean music, and goes back into face-punching assault again. It took me a few listens to really get it. The music is complex, almost to a fault, but where that pays off is when you see the live show, and they're hitting all those notes amidst the choas onstage."

nin,39ue8c,mcmahon212,9,Sun Jun 14 22:21:00 2015 UTC,This was my favorite track Hesitation Marks. It's actually probably my favorite track off of the last three albums. I'm pretty disappointed they didn't play it when I saw them perform during the Tension tour. Oh well.

I think it sounds exactly like I expect from NIN, in a good way.  What was your progression into NIN after listening to HM?"
nin,39u05h,DasQBert,12,Sun Jun 14 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"I absolutely LOVE David Bowie. Even before I fell in love with NIN, I have always had a thing for Bowie.

nin,39u05h,rhiannaB,9,Sun Jun 14 23:42:01 2015 UTC,"Conversely, I actually don't know a lot of his older stuff. I need to really explore his discography. But the man has tons of albums in a lot of genres, so there's a lot to go through. I absolutely love Outside and Earthling though, and the tour with NIN is what started that love. So incredible to see them on stage together, and Hearts A Filthy Lesson and I'm Afraid of Americans (which I had the pleasure of hearing NIN perform live in Atlanta a couple of years ago) are just the best."
nin,39u05h,ehrgeiz91,6,Sun Jun 14 20:25:31 2015 UTC,Can anyone recommend some nin-like singles from Bowie?
nin,39u05h,PersistenceOfLoss,8,Sun Jun 14 22:39:34 2015 UTC,"The song ""I'm Afraid of Americans"" featured NIN I think, and the melody to ""A Warm Place"" is based off the Bowie song ""Crystal Japan"". Most of his other work is significantly more poppier sounding, with the exception of the album Low (which you should definitely check out, it's one of Trent's favorite albums)."
nin,39u05h,Batberg,6,Sun Jun 14 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend the following songs: ""Hallo Spaceboy"", ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"", ""I'm Deranged"" (all three from the ""Outside"" album, contemporary with his NIN-co-touring days);  ""Little Wonder,"" ""Battle for Britain"", ""Telling Lies,"" and ""I'm Afraid of Americans"" (all from the ""Earthling"" album, around the same time, and with Trent contributing the version of ""I'm Afraid of Americans"" that Bowie later used on a best-of)  and from older albums (Bowie goes a lot, lot deeper than just the stuff that sounds vaguely NIN-ish), I'd listen to the whole ""Scary Monsters"" and ""Low"" albums, and then ""The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars"" -- my three personal favorites, and some of Trent's as well (from interviews I've read/seen).  There's no bad era of Bowie, but you'll quickly discover that he had a lot of different sounds at a lot of different moments -- and if you really look at where those fell in music history, it's completely fair to say that Bowie was almost always ahead of the curve, and probably helping create many of those sounds.  The man is a legend, as very very few artists are.  (I'm a bit biased, as you can probably hear.)"

Such an iconic cultural figure to say nothing of his musical genius. And I think each period of Bowie's music is unique and distinctive from every other period, not unlike Trent's work."
nin,39u05h,UlquiorraSchiffer,4,Mon Jun 15 00:18:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is interesting one for me.   I always feel like I should absolutely adore this guy and his music, but I never really couldn't get much into it. Not for the lack of trying, believe me, but I always feel as I only scratch on the surface; I love songs like Heroes, Space Oddity or Rebel Rebel. But I couldn't much further than that. And it really bums me out, I understand that Bowie is one of the most influential people in music pretty much ever, but when listening to his albums I become disinterested after a while.

Trent doing a full set, then doing about 4 tracks with Bowie, then Bowie did a full set. I was honestly surprised to see about 1/4 of the audience leave after Trent left stage.

If you remember any of my comments from the past year I have made a pretty big deal about this being one of my favourite tracks of all time. Mainly a huge nostalgia trip when I first got into NIN, Things Falling Apart was a very important release in my journey into getting into heaps of music.   Hey a side note, did anyone play Abe's Oddysee? Some of the effects in this track sound very similar, I was playing that game heavily around the same time I got into NIN, I still can't get over the coincidence."
nin,39q4rs,DasQBert,10,Sat Jun 13 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Ministry is, as far as I can tell, both the source and the pinnacle of industrial metal. It started as a vaguely Depeche Mode-esque synthpop band, but it turned into something much more. The Land of Rape and Honey is one of the essential industrial albums and it's perfect in nearly every way. The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste is also a quality release, but much more metal driven. Psalm 69 goes further down that route of metal, but it's still good. After that it drops off for me, but those three albums are fantastic.  Al Jourgensen is definitely an interesting figure. Insane, rude, and reduced to pretty much nothing now, but when he was prowling around the world with Skinny Puppy he was great. Al is not only a fantastic musician (was, rather) but also a great producer, except for his less-than-desirable influence on Skinny Puppy's album Rabies. Overall, I much prefer Skinny Puppy to Ministry, but there's no denying Ministry's value to both Nine Inch Nails and industrial music as a whole."

""Modern day, metal sounding, 3 million piercing Al"" I have no interest in. Frankly (and I don't mean this as an insult to anyone who's a fan, BUT) I can't help but think he's trying to appeal to the younger generation by any means he can. It seems kind of desperate.

With Sympathy (1983)-Synth Pop  Twitch (1986)-EBM with excellent programming (Adrian Sherwood worked on this album and Pretty Hate Machine)  The Land of Rape And Honey (1988)-Heavy Metal done purely on synthesizers..an essential album.

nin,39q4rs,rewddit,5,Sat Jun 13 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"Here's a comment I made a while back in /r/industrialmusic about starting to get into Ministry:  The Land of Rape and Honey is by far my favorite Ministry album, but The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste may be easier to enjoy at first. Those two albums are the heart of Ministry's industrial era. Twitch, their second album that precedes Land, has some industrial leanings, but it's still very much undeveloped and reminiscent of their Depeche Mode-esque debut album, With Sympathy. Psalm 69, which comes after Mind, is also a solid album, but it's much more metal-driven than industrial. And anything past that I personally don't enjoy.  And here are some highlight tracks:  Stigmata - 1988, The Land of Rape and Honey  Thieves - 1989, The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste  The Land of Rape and Honey - 1988, my personal favorite Ministry track and my 8th overall favorite industrial track"

nin,39nkuv,signofthenine,8,Sat Jun 13 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"In my experience Ringfinger is oftentimes overlooked when people evaluate Pretty Hate Machine. Like much of the album, it is undoubtedly locked to a distinct time period, but I wouldn't derogatorily call it dated. Of its own right it's a pretty solid track. A bit conventional for future Trent's taste, but it shows his early mastering of song structure and musicality.   However, all that doesn't mention the last minute of this song, which I hold to be the best single minute throughout all of Pretty Hate Machine. It's like a foretelling of what Trent will go on to make. It's industrial, harsh, spiked with alluring synth, and topped with a gradual decay that he is seemingly so fond of. The main low synth part is pretty reminiscent of Closer and the overall tone is just purely Nine Inch Nails."

People like him a lot of the time for the theatrics and the associated fringe style. Nine Inch Nails, however, is all about quality and music, not appearances.  By the way, I'm not saying theatrics are inherently bad, I just don't like Manson's particular brand of edginess. My favorite band, Skinny Puppy, puts on quite the live performance that includes a lot of stylish theatrics."

nin,39lokm,ninfan200,9,Fri Jun 12 17:22:16 2015 UTC,Yep. Everything Marilyn Manson did on stage during the mid 90s was a Skinny Puppy rip off. The two biggest things being self mutilation (although Ogre faked it) and the use of stilts to be all creepy like.

nin,39lokm,Reinmann,12,Fri Jun 12 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"*edit: forgot an album...  I still listen to him now and then. Often fun to listen to, the artwork, and the costumes are wonderful, but I can't argue with the fact that he hasn't done a whole lot to branch out and I haven't liked everything he's done. I love those interviews from the heyday of his popularity. Very well spoken.    Portrait of an American Family: A fun, angsty, look at the hypocrisy of the American Dream through a teenage lens. Misery Machine is my fucking driving song and Lunchbox is for when I feel like I'm going to lose my temper. Songs you can lose yourself in and pretend you're a kid thrashing against authority. Anti-Christ Superstar: Iconic, black magic genius. Excellent songwriting and superb sound. One of the defining albums of the 90s (along with The Downward Spiral, naturally, since they were practically made together) Mechanical Animals: Not my favorite, but it has it's moment. The pitch definitely went up a few octaves to a more ear-piercing level. It marked the height of Manson's level of weirdness (and fame) as seen by the public with his androgynous look. Lyrically, it's a look at the hypocrisy and fakeness of being famous and the death of authentic emotions. HolyWood: It's much more back to his roots of Portrait and Anti-Christ with the same focus on the hypocrisy of fame, nationalism, and American 'culture'. It's wonderfully angry compared to the much more pitiful Mechanical Animals. I listen to it when I'm pissed at the stupidity of people and society. Golden Age of Grotesque: Felt more like a homage to the pounding, self-important rap albums, oddly enough. Seems a commentary on the creative bankruptcy of modern art. The songwriting is generally clever and I enjoy most of the tracks.  Eat Me, Drink Me: I like a few of the tracks, but it's largely whiny, brooding, broken-heart songs. It's lonely vampire music as evidenced by the first track. The High End of the Low: Hard to say exactly... none of these tracks stand out to me. Not his best lyrics and clearly still whining about somebody. Feels like an extension of the last album; slow, brooding, and uninspired. Born Villian: Oddly, I love much of this album; it feels like he's found himself, regained his confidence again after this heartache bullshit. Hey, Cruel World... feels like first ""fuck you"" the previous crap albums. It's not a perfect album, but Pistol Whipped, Slo-mo-tion, and Children of Cain are my jams. Much better songwriting and it feels like he's having fun again making music.  Pale Emperor: I like the artwork, though that icon feels familiar, heh. Musically it feels almost like an unplugged, raw, emotional trip that is much more authentic than the albums like Eat Me and High End. The guy who made this album is much more comfortable in his own skin and made a pretty solid album."
nin,39lokm,SyntheticGod8,30,Sat Jun 13 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"AntiChrist Superstart is a legitimately terriffic album. So is Mechanical Animals.   Portrait is cool, and Holy wood is hit and miss.   Everything aside from that is pretty much unlistenable for me. I think The Pale Emperor is the first Manson album I have found interesting in the SLIGHTEST since Holy Wood. Eat Me Drink Me, Born Villian, Golden Age, all that shit was horrible.   My personal impression is, I think Manson would LIKE to be a lot deeper than he actually is."
nin,39lokm,CDC_,12,Fri Jun 12 18:46:23 2015 UTC,"You listed Eat Me, Drink Me as 'horrible'-- that's cool, I'll respect your taste. But then you say that Manson would like to be deeper than he actually is.   In Eat Me, Drink Me (song) Manson's lyrics draw from Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (1865), The Rape of the Lock (A satirical poem from 1719 by Alexander Pope), and vampire films like Nosferatu (1922). Allusions aside, the lyrics also tell a pretty cool story. By combining the vampire mythos (vampires draw blood to damn their victims) to the Christ mythos (who offers body and blood to save his followers), Manson talks about blood in two very different ways simultaneously. Manson's always about duplicity and contradiction, and Eat Me, Drink Me suggests that the way we look at Christ and Vampirism isn't really too different.   Say what you will about Manson's theatrics or music, but deriding his intelligence or saying that he's unsuccessful in his attempts to be thoughtful is simply wrong. He's extremely smart, he's eloquent, and he's VERY well-read."
nin,39lokm,PersistenceOfLoss,11,Fri Jun 12 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"Right, and I believe he's fairly smart, above average. I believe he's eloquent, and I believe he's very well read. But (and I haven't met the man, obviously) I get the vibes that he considers his work to be profound, genius, etc... and I don't get that from him at all. Sometimes he's right on point. But often I feel it falls very short.   I feel almost exactly the same about Rob Zombie. I remember seeing The Lords of Salem and being like ""well, Rob, you're not David Lynch, or Stanley Kubrick, but you'd sure like to be.""  Just one man's opinion, which is what OP asked for."
nin,39lokm,CDC_,5,Fri Jun 12 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"You consider vampirism as a metaphor for Christianity to be clever?  Because they both involve eating blood, is that it?  Because there are absolutely no other parallels that I can see.  Also, you consider Alice in Wonderland to be a deep, sophisticated piece of literature?  And Nosferatu references are deep?  Everyone's familiar with Nosferatu, it's just Dracula, there's nothing deep about referencing it."
nin,39lokm,Jewggerz,8,Fri Jun 12 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"1) If you don't take Alice in Wonderland to be incredibly intricate, complex, and sophisticated, then I'll assume you've never experienced it, rather than assuming you're just trolling. Lewis Carroll is an exceptionally complicated author, and one of my favorites from the Victorian period. I don't work on him academically because he's too consistently difficult for me.  2) Vampirism's relationship to Christianity is far more complex than metaphor. If there are no other parallels ""that you can see"", then the problem rests with you.   3) Considering Nosferatu is almost 100 years old, regardless of its pop-culture infamy it is of true cultural value."

He didn't finish a single song. Went on some crazy rant about his coat, stumbled about, fell off the stage a couple times, demanded someone come on and fix his makeup, then on The Beautiful People (probably song 3 or 4) he changed the lyrics to ""fuck you people"" and left without finishing his set.

Only thing that really tempted me was last year's, with Linkin Park doing the entire of Hybrid Theory. Would've been cool to see that just for the blast from the past.

nin,39lokm,ThoughtNinja,6,Fri Jun 12 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"I really liked him when I was younger, but I don't think he, or most of his music, has aged well at all.  Portrait of an American Family remains, in my opinion, a fantastic, fun, creepy album. The whole psychedelics meets punk rock meets willy wonka thing was pretty cool and actually unique back then. And daisy was a fantastic guitarist. It's still a fun listen now and then, but not very often.   Antichrist Superstar was great when it came out, but holy shit it hasn't aged well AT ALL. It sounds so dated and weak now. The lyrics are no longer relevant in any way and the sound smacks of that early 90s post industrial production. It was the best album for it's time and place, but the time and place were very specific.   Mechanical Animals, IMO is the best album and the only one from the early days that really aged well. It's more mature than any of his other albums, including the newer stuff and is still as listenable and enjoyable now as it was then.   Holy wood was, back then even, kind of lack luster. Not bad, but not remarkable. Golden Age finally brought some fun back to things, but it was kind of too little too late. When it came out I used to say it was his best album.... but it also was the one I forgot about quickest, so I guess it didn't actually leave the impression I thought it would.   After that all of his albums seem to just get more and more generic and unremarkable. Simultaneously, though, it seems like he's trying too hard on them. It almost seems like these days he tries so hard to recapture that shocking value that he naturally had back in the day, and in deliberately calculating what he's doing and writing he just ends up making mediocre albums now. I've given each album since golden age a few listens, but they've ranged from forgettable to pathetic in their desperate attempts to maintain some kind of relevance and shock value. I do think the song they used in John Wick is excellent though, so I have some hope that he might do something worth while again though.   Overall, I'd credit him with a lot, and I think his impact on music from the 90s on is undeniable. But while it may have helped advance what is ok for a lot of artists to do and say, it also helped pave the way for a whole generation of complaint-rock. so, he had both a very positive and negative impact at the same time, which pretty much fits in with the massive contradiction that has been his entire career."
nin,39lokm,revglenn,2,Fri Jun 12 18:36:51 2015 UTC,Why was Eat Me Drink Me so good in your opinion? I personally found it to be kind of generic musically and thematically a bit too emo.

nin,39lokm,whativebeenhiding,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Portrait of an American Family remains, in my opinion, a fantastic, fun, creepy album. The whole psychedelics meets punk rock meets willy wonka thing was pretty cool and actually unique back then. And daisy was a fantastic guitarist. It's still a fun listen now and then, but not very often.    For fuck sake, THANK YOU.  I don't think enough people recognize this.  IMHO Portrait is one of Manson's best, if not The Best album. They style was so goddamned unique and interesting at that point. I still remember exactly where I was when I first heard ""Get Your Gunn,"" back in 1994. My mind was blown. I ran out to buy the album as fast as I could, but it hadn't been released yet, so I bought the Gunn single and spun it to death, until I could get my hands on Portrait, then I did the same thing with that one.   I think a very large reason I liked early manson more than later manson was the guitar work of Daisy Berkowitz, aka Scott Putesky.  Daisy had a really amazing guitar sound. You can hear a little bit of his influence on some AC Superstar tracks, but then it's gone...  (Though he certainly wasn't the only reason Portrait was so amazing. It featured some of Manson's best lyrics, chock full of clever puns, brilliant use of sampling, much lighter tone.... walking that line between dark and playful... which just about none of the other music has.)  Though I disagree with you about Superstar. I don't really think it sounds dated, and I still think that's one of his better albums."
nin,39lokm,willreignsomnipotent,3,Sat Jun 13 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"At the moment his live shows are hit or miss.   Some shows he's a mumbling old wreck, but recently he's been doing some of his best performances in many years.  If I didn't listen to Marilyn Manson, I wouldn't be a fan of Nine Inch Nails or a lot of other Industrial artists that I love now.  So I fucking love him and his music.  Although the biggest criticism I have of him is that he really treats a lot of his ex band members like shit."

Went on some crazy rant about his coat, stumbled about, fell off the stage (and pulled some lighting down) and then on The Beautiful People he changed the lyrics to ""fuck you people"" and left. Was really disappointing considering he was one of the main reasons we went to Download in the first place."

To me it sounded like outtakes from both Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals. Definitely not of the same quality though. I don't like The Golden Age of Grotesque at all. It gives me headache listening to it...every single song has the same tone and vibe (well except for the title, intro and outr tracks). It's just too much to stomach in one sitting.  The rest of the albums are hit and miss. His newest one is good, but doesn't come close to the 90s stuff.   Him as a person? I could care less. I just dig his music."

The early records when they were a band are awesome. Mechanical Animals is the most listenable to me now and Antichrist Superstar is still awesome.  We used to see them out in New Orleans all the time when they were at nothing studios recording it.

nin,39lokm,auntiewarhol,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:02:44 2015 UTC,Antichrist and Omega were his best records by far.  I would even go as far to say that Omega was probably one of the better records of the 90's.

It doesn't matter who you are - you've heard of him, seen parodies of him, and probably have an opinion of him. That's what makes Manson huge - even in his old age.   He doesn't care what you think of his music. He's saying it all, and doing it all for himself."

nin,39lokm,HCPwny,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"I'm glad Manson exists.  I'm glad he filled a niche that needed to be filled.  The very existence of him and his music introduces dissent into a populace, and I agree with a lot of his messages.  But I honestly can't stand what he's become.  As some others here mentioned, it really seems to be more about image and not about the music after a certain point.  I'm not even going to claim that I've listened to all his albums, because I haven't.  I just can't relate to most of the feelings he evokes in his music.  He touches on many of the same subjects as NIN, but in a totally different way.  I kind of feel as if his lyrics are very unevolved.  While he does 'hide' a lot of meaning in his lyrics, the most basic of functions is the feeling music is supposed to evoke.  And while, when I was younger, I might have latched onto those feelings and felt like I ""got"" Manson, nowadays, I don't really get it anymore.  I don't like the simplicity of the emotions he's trying to evoke.  There doesn't seem to be much of a grey area.  It all seems to be very self evident and self-appreciating."
nin,39lokm,rewddit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"I think Manson was a force of energy that Reznor helped to focus to something better. With the exception of ""Mechanical Animals,"" any of his albums that didn't have Reznor's influence just came off as boring.  I want to say that I like ""Pale Emperor,"" but I think it's just because it's the first album of his I've been able to listen to all the way through in almost twenty years.  That probably reads as being scathing, but I still consider myself a huge fan of his older stuff. ""Antichrist Superstar"" remains an incredible album."

nin,39lokm,senseideal,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"I've always been a huge fan of Marilyn Manson.  To me, his albums have either been amazing or really dull; nothing in the middle.  Antichrist Superstar is a huge favorite of mine (being half written by Trent Reznor, it can't be too shocking that it's a favorite.  Manson had a great run with Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals, and Holy Wood.  Golden Age of Grotesque was a cool deep gothic hard-rock album too.  He lost his way for a few years, and he is definitely back with The Pale Emperor.   He is clearly aging and it is taking a toll on him as a writer and person, but most of his ""maturity"" is coming from his family situation.  The Pale Emperor, specifically the song Odds of Even, is dedicated to his mother who passed away.  I saw him live twice in the last two years, once before and once after The Pale Emperor came out.  The first show was typical Marilyn Manson, lots of stage props, costume changes, and all of that gimmicky stuff.  His performance post The Pale Emperor was so stripped down and simple.  He clearly went through a major change in his life and it's less of a shock rock performance now and more of an emotional and intimate show.  He's much more serious and has calmed down a lot."
nin,39lokm,htlr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"i really dislike him. i'm an younger nin fan so i didn't grow up listening to them when they were more active as artists, but from what i can see, manson seems like an old man who needs to stop making angsty music and actually DO something. reznor has been everywhere - scoring films, working with apple, pushing visual boundaries on his tour, and he LOOKS good while he's at it! manson seems to be on the other end of the spectrum. he was less of an innovator and more of a typical edgy pop star. of course, both musicians had their heyday, but manson's childish and contrived shock rock will never compare to the dizzying, violent, and depressing fiasco that is early nine inch nails. manson just needs to quit."

They're not too big right now though, which I thought is kind of weird because I've thought they should at least be headlining but they've been either headlining small gigs or are the opener for equally not-so-big shows. I guess they've lost more popularity since the 90s than I thought they did."
nin,39eh1a,powermad47,3,Thu Jun 11 12:59:17 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with everyone's assessment. While traveling down memory lane a few weeks ago, I revisited some of their hit singles, and I just found them to all be somewhat dull. None of them are particularly bad, but none of them are particularly good. In my opinion, Stabbing Westward is a far more interesting NIN-wannabe band - in the very least, they understood how to put together a pop hook.   Trip Like I Do is a solid song, but their contribution is almost the worst part. The lyrics are completely absurd. Still fun to listen to when nostalgia strikes."
nin,39eh1a,kennyminot,2,Thu Jun 11 15:29:22 2015 UTC,Stabbing westward is much better than filter.
nin,39eh1a,wingzero55,3,Sun Jun 14 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"Great - love them. Was into them before I really discovered Nine Inch Nails. The first 3 albums are core, excellent albums. The remainder are mostly forgettable.  I personally feel very strongly that if Richard Patrick had stayed with NIN and Trent had given him some creative lee-way, they could have come up with some pretty brilliant stuff. The style in Broken was in part inspired by Richard Patrick whispering in his ear to 'keep it heavy'."
nin,39eh1a,Zaragoza09,2,Thu Jun 11 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"I think Title of Record is a pretty good record for what it is. It isn't particularly edgy or anything, but it has enjoyable enough songs like ""Welcome to the Fold"" and  ""Cancer"". There are some other good tunes on there that the titles escape me right now. And ""Take A Picture"", while being a rather generic sounding, mainstream song gets a few bonus points in my book simply because it got the masses to unknowingly sing about getting drunk and stripping naked on an airplane.   Overall Filter is alright. I haven't really listened to them since The Amalgamate came out in the early 2000s. I might stream their recent efforts if I ever happen to think about it."

""HEY DAD WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR SON NOW?"" was pretty cringetastic, even though that was a catchy song. ""Hey Man, Nice Shot"" - awesome riff."
nin,39dkiv,SymmetryOfOrigin,11,Thu Jun 11 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"It's a little silly. It's a little hokey. Do I think it deserves to be a single more than Meet Your Master, My Violent Heart, or The Warning? No.   However, this is a genuinely good track. Some will argue that it sounds like a leftover from With Teeth's poppy side, but Capital G is very much infused with Year Zero's signature sound-- a sound that I have yet to see recreated anywhere to even a fraction of the album's success. This unique sonic landscape is immediately recognizable and, for me, immediately enjoyable. Capital G is unflinchingly electronic and, despite its danceable tone and singable chorus, still an integral part of Year Zero."
nin,39dkiv,Reinmann,3,Thu Jun 11 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with your initial description:  a little hokey, but still solid.  It is certainly a Year Zero-sounding track, and goes well with the album, but is kind of the poppiest track of the album.  I always thought the beginning beat, before the vocals, sounds like it could be an early Madonna track!  Not unlike a few bits of Maybe Just Once.  But you know, on Year Zero.  edit:  added the word ""thought"" that I left out."

Who is he referring to? God? George Bush? (it was 2007) Greed? Government? Perhaps all of them."

nin,39dkiv,GetReady72,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:32:06 2015 UTC,I think it's about man's modern religion: money. Both capital and G are monetary terms and it's referring to society giving up God for money.

nin,39dkiv,dubsric,6,Thu Jun 11 02:18:12 2015 UTC,"It's always good to have dissent in these discussions. Capital G is a little shallow, but I always viewed that as a sort of sardonic thing on Trent's part. It's not quite a joke, but it's sarcastic. The fantastic production and the Year Zero qualities salvage it as a song that I enjoy."

nin,39dkiv,signofthenine,3,Thu Jun 11 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"HUH! HUH! :)  Thought it was one of the more likeable tracks on the album. At the time, there were rumors it was a swipe at the then president, which, when combined with The Good Soldier, My Violent Heart, and God Given, would imply a more political stance than previously seen in TR's work. The other explanation would just imply ""Greed"". Personally, I think it's of the former (with more Gulf War madness happening at the time) and not the latter. But that's just me (I don't mean to politicize but between the various tracks on the album, it seems hard to ignore) .  TR rapping, from Down In It to this track, is always entertaining. He's both funky and awkward, at the same time."

And yeah, us collectors are a dying breed.   In the case of TR, I suspect it's more of a time deal. He's got two different bands, movie scores, a nice family, various small projects...maybe even a film festival and a live disc, who knows (fragilereissuefragilereissuefragilereissue)?  There's only so many hours in the day.  He also made a comment a few years ago about (loosely paraphrasing, as I don't have it in front of me) that (with technology) anyone can make a quality remix and publish it, so the idea of (him) approaching (paid) remixers for a project seemed kind of moot."
nin,39b6o4,signofthenine,3,Wed Jun 10 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"Trent is a progressive guy, he follows the bleeding edge of technology and efficiency when it comes to music production. I'm sure he recognizes that the route of physical releases is dying out and becoming cost prohibitive. It makes me sad since I love to collect said releases, but you have to respect his pragmatism."

nin,396e7c,hitmewithmuzak,2,Tue Jun 9 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"My desktop PC has analog 5.1 out of the motherboard. I also have a USB headset that supports surround sound. I know there's a bit of debate about the quality of surround sound through headsets, but I think mine sounds pretty good, and different channels can be distinguished (maybe it's just in my head, although I can definitely hear a difference when switching games between stereo and surround).  I don't mind downloading a torrent, I just haven't done so in a while, and at this point I don't even know which site to use (are there still variants of TPB up? my old go to was Demonoid, but I know that's been down for a while). I was also hoping to get ""official"" tracks directly from a NIN source, if possible, which is why I wouldn't mind purchasing. I'm honestly a little surprised that Trent hasn't made them available through any of the regular NIN channels. From what I've been reading, SACD was always a bit of a niche market, and the disks were specifically designed around making ripping very difficult. I'm almost positive that when The Fragile re-release comes around (if it ever does...) there will be a high quality digital format."

I don't think anywhere sells the files online just because there's so little market for the files without the disk, everybody I know who is interested in that just gets an SACD player, even the most basic blu-ray players from Sony play them these days.  The Slip was released in high quality 24bit/96khz (legally free at Internet Archive), and Hesitation Marks is available in 24 bit/48khz at HDTracks for $18, but nothing else is easily commercially available at higher than 16/44 on a CD.   TDS and With Teeth both have DualDiscs readily available that are regular CD on one side and SACD 5.1 on the other, but hard to rip, and Ghosts was available in 24/96 from the blu-ray disc in the deluxe crazy expensive version."

nin,3938nb,SymmetryOfOrigin,14,Mon Jun 8 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno if this is a commonly held sentiment, but I think this track contains within it Trent's best lyrics. The phrases are simple, but surprisingly powerful. As far as musicality goes, it's a pretty straightforward intro to a fantastic album. It's a sort of misleading intro, though. Mr. Self Destruct could very well be from Broken, and it automatically portrays its host album in a similarly metal-driven light, but there's much more to The Downward Spiral than that, as seen in the next track from Piggy and its demon jazziness. Mr. Self Destruct on its own rights is a nice setting of the mood, harsh and driving. Plus, Belew's weird guitar noises at the end are really cool.  Also, there's something refreshingly sardonic about the name 'Mr. Self Destruct' and the way its shouted in the chorus along with the jingle-esque vocal 'woos' that helps build the already extremely dark album up as something that doesn't take itself too seriously."
nin,3938nb,Reinmann,5,Mon Jun 8 23:19:37 2015 UTC,"Mr. Self Destruct could very well be from Broken   I've always liked how ""Somewhat Damaged"" sounds like it could be a part of ""The Downward Spiral"".  The Fragile had beautiful organic textures, and mostly programmed drum beats.  Then, [With_Teeth], which has a strong 'live' sound to it, opens with programmed drums slowly being overpowered by live drums.  To me, this kinda brought the recordings together, as if they are all chapters of a single, larger story. (which year zero and ghosts were  a clean break from)"
nin,3938nb,kyleclements,4,Tue Jun 9 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. And just as a fun thing to think about, The Slip starts with the track 999,999 that sounds like a Ghosts I - IV song. I like to imagine that once the ghosts reach 1,000,000 (like with the song on The Slip) they break out of ambiance and shift back to the norm, implying that between Ghosts I - IV and The Slip there's tons of dark, soundtracky stuff and that the two releases are connected.

The music is obviously very cool, it's kinda the final song of the Broken era (although I do feel Burn could have been on Broken if it was written earlier), with the fast and heavy style.

So I decided to try out the downward spiral and the first song that came up was obviously Mr. Self Destruct. I couldn't understand what he was saying and I wasn't huge into the screamo influence on the song. Then I listened to it again and realized how deep the lyrics were and I found out that the rest of the album told a story, so I was immediately hooked. Now Mr. Self Destruct is one of my favorites from TDS (along with Closer and Heresy)."

That's how I heard about it and never looked back, it's awesome. I guess his beef is something to do with the artists not making enough money? And indie artists maybe not getting any pay until they hit a certain number of plays (i'm guessing)"

nin,392llh,totallywhatever,2,Wed Jun 10 18:32:47 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about Apple's marketing machine - This is just the sort of thing Trent has been saying since he first revealed he was working on the project - about how they're going to create something different that pushes the delivery medium forward in unexpected ways. I see none of that in this service as it has been presented.
nin,392llh,Comicsastonish,0,Wed Jun 10 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, it's not so much the products they're offering as much as the philosophy behind them. They're arguing that music needs to have a human connection. Basically all other music services rely upon an algorithm to deliver or suggest music to you, but relying upon that takes away from the magic and experience with sharing music.   Now is it possible that you might end up with the same set of songs from an algorithm as an Apple curator? Maybe. We'll know for sure in a few weeks, but Apple is investing in the purpose as opposed to the tools."

nin,38xiym,The_Prospektor,7,Sun Jun 7 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"Nine Inch Nails' greatest song? Eh... I dunno. It's barely even a song at that, it's more of an intro to give an excuse to not immediately launch into Terrible Lie's harsh drum pounding without preamble. It's not bad, but I can't help but think there's very little to it. It's a necessity more than anything, and Trent's never displayed interest in releasing a studio version because of this, I think.  As for its lyrics, it appears to me to be just a summation of Pretty Hate Machine's imagery and themes in a small package. I don't think it's him being prophetic or anything."
nin,38xiym,Reinmann,7,Sun Jun 7 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""greatest"" is probably a bit of a stretch. As far as other songs referenced beyond PHM, there is:   March of the Pigs (""smashed myself to pieces"") Burn (""sifting through the ashes"")  Hurt (""What have I become"")  The album The Slip (""I let it slip away"") In Two (""break myself in two"") Wave Goodbye tour (""wave, wave, wave, wave goodbye"")   Of course some of those might be relatively weak points, but just the fact that there were so many potential links surprised me."
nin,38xiym,Reinmann,6,Sun Jun 7 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"Well, Now I'm Nothing was first played in 1991, so these definitely aren't distinct references. Trent uses certain terms and phrases constantly throughout his work. These are evocative words that he's particularly fond of. I don't think it's a conscious thing, he's just thematically consistent.   But, these points are interesting nonetheless. The one I think is most actively perpetrated by Trent is Wave Goodbye."

I've replaced it with the EI-P remix from Halo 21. The music video fellates Apple. Sorry. *Hesitation Marks is pretty weak. I like a few tracks and I love the artwork, which feels very Downward Spiral era. NIN hasn't done a proper music video since The Perfect Drug. Fragile-era had a few that were likeable in an art-house way. Since then it's just been watching them play in studio. While I love many of them (the ones from The Slip come to mind), I can't call them music videos in the traditional sense and slapping a couple of camera filters on them doesn't change it. On the other hand, I love the video to HTDA The Space in Between and I know that there are several videos from TDS and Broken that are essentially filmed in studio, so maybe I'm just bitching. I don't really like his movie soundtrack stuff; I mean, they fit the movie, but they're overall forgettable. I didn't leave The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo or Gone Girl thinking about how great the music was. I'd never buy the soundtracks just to have another listen. As a contrast, I do own The Lost Highway and Natural Born Killers soundtracks, if not the movies.

Everyday is Exactly the Same is supremely overplayed, and I really don't like it (Hand That Feeds is awesome)  Only is good in a weird kind of way, and so is With Teeth (the song, Awitha Ateetha!)

I used to love The Fragile, but now I see it as a largely disconnected mess of overly unique songs built on quirks instead of quality. but its still really good dont get me wrong"
nin,38vbbv,Reinmann,7,Sun Jun 7 11:32:22 2015 UTC,"I'll give you 3 out of 4.  The Fragile [left], I think is an excellent, cohesive record (Pilgrimage, notwithstanding.  I'm still not entirely clear on what's going on there).  If it were released on its own, it would contend with TDS as my favorite NIN record.  If you said that just about The Fragile [right], I'm right behind you."
nin,38vbbv,imatt,4,Sun Jun 7 14:12:45 2015 UTC,"The left side definitely is the pinnacle of the album's coherency. It's a logical progression, a relatively fully formed album of its own right. The right side is just so strange. It's great, unique, and innovative, but it's messy and (I hate to say it) seemingly underdeveloped. That's not to say it's without layering and complexity, it just isn't blended to makes sense with the overall structure.   Also, as a sidenote, I love Pilgrimage. It seems like everyone loves the left side but chooses one song that doesn't appeal to them, and it's rarely the same as another's choice. Pretty interesting."

nin,38vbbv,dubsric,7,Sun Jun 7 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"Have you ever been to a NIN show?  The quality is immense in person.  Recorded audio just doesn't speak to the quality of the performance in person.  Went to a show during the Tension tour, and was blown away by everything.  The sound, the visuals, the musicianship.  Legitimately the best show I've ever been to.  And Terrible Lie was when the crowd really picked up and got into it.  Being in a crowd during this song is one of the most surreal and powerful experiences I've had.  Really, for the whole show, but this song especially was an intense experience."

It was so amazing, I was 18, I arrived at the venue really early in the day, I was one of the first 10 or so people there so I was right up against the metal barrier in front of the stage. It was intense. An amazing experience at a young age. I was visiting San Francisco then, now I live in the Bay Area. I like thinking back to that time.

Just because it was an 'edgy' and popular single at the time it came out, doesn't mean it's the best song NIN has ever made.  Half the people who like the song don't even know what it's about."
nin,38u2pc,HCPwny,11,Sun Jun 7 00:42:43 2015 UTC,"I'll have to politely disagree. It's easy to become desensitized to more popular mainstream songs when you hear the general populace talking about them, but we can't forget their actual value. Closer is at its core a very, very good industrial, synth-based track. It's the most coherent The Downward Spiral becomes, and it's a nice division. I wouldn't put it in my personal top ten, but definitely top fifteen.   But yes, overall I don't like the list."

nin,38a7w3,Baegus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:25:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. You should definitely start from the beginning and see how Trent evolved and mastered his art. The man is a fucking genius... But as u/teleekom said, there are many different styles...a little bit to appeal to everyone's tastes!  Edit: spelled username wrong"
nin,38a7w3,dominax1020,11,Wed Jun 3 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"The Downward Spiral is the best Nine Inch Nails album, but it's brutal and difficult to get into. However, completely worth it. You'll find unparalleled depth and quality here. This album is as close as industrial music gets to accessible and mainstream. Some will say it's the best industrial release out there, and they might be right, but I'd give that award to either VIVIsectVI or Too Dark Park by Skinny Puppy. That's aside from the point, though.  The Fragile is generally the fan favorite Nine Inch Nails album, but it's even harder to get into, although you might like its more symphonic and quiet aspects.  Still is an EP that takes a few old nin songs and makes them toned-down, quiet pieces. It also delivers a handful of new tracks that you might like. It's the softest nin gets.  Pretty Hate Machine is a charming swarm of 80s noises with undercurrents of industrial majesty, but it doesn't necessarily fall in line with Trent's modern film soundtrack style.  Ghosts I - IV is a good choice, but it isn't necessarily Trent's pinnacle or representative of his body of work. However, it's as close to those soundtracks as he gets within the nin catalog.  With Teeth is alt-rock, poppish stuff. I don't really like it. Some people love it, but I think it's better to start with a more critically acclaimed and representative release.  Similarly, Hesitation Marks is a disappointment for me personally.  The Slip is interesting and cool, but it's definitely not a good place to start.  Broken is instrumentally the harshest Nine Inch Nails ever gets, and it's fantastic. Underappreciated due to its status as an EP, but not underrated. But if you don't like metal, you'll probably want to start elsewhere.   Year Zero is a great album, my favorite of the post-Fragile nin stuff. It's electronic and pretty fantastic. However, some hate it. It's analogous to With Teeth in this, I think. Some people love one and hate the other, and vice versa.  As far as songs go, here are my highlights from each album:  Terrible Lie 1989, Pretty Hate Machine  Wish 1992, Broken  Last 1992, Broken  Ruiner 1994, The Downward Spiral  Reptile 1994, The Downward Spiral (my overall favorite nin track)  The Wretched 1999, The Fragile Left  The Big Come Down 1999, The Fragile Right  And All That Could Have Been 2002, Still  Only 2005, With Teeth  Meet Your Master 2007, Year Zero  Survivalism 2007, Year Zero  Ghosts III - 19 2008, Ghosts I - IV  Ghosts IV - 31 2008, Ghosts I - IV  Discipline 2008, The Slip  In Two 2013, Hesitation Marks  tl;dr - All that being said, I'd start with The Downward Spiral or Year Zero. Keep in mind this is all my opinion, but I try to represent the general fanbase consensus on most things."
nin,38a7w3,Reinmann,2,Tue Jun 2 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"This is pretty comprehensive, but I disagree on a couple of points. With Teeth is really accessible, and there are a bunch of songs I'd show to someone looking to get into NIN.  And the Wretched is the worst song on all of the Fragile, Left or Right, for me. Even Deeper is a good one off Left, I'd say"
nin,38a7w3,Qaebuuz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:43:43 2015 UTC,"With Teeth is definitely accessible, but I think it's shallow and ultimately not as good as Trent's other releases. That being said, I'm sure it's not the worst place to start, I just don't like it.  As for The Wretched, that's fine. To each their own. I think the Left is a largely perfect chunk of music with a number of highlights, but The Wretched has always stood out to me due to its foreboding menace."
nin,38a7w3,Reinmann,7,Wed Jun 3 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"If you are enjoying Trent's soundtracks you should check out Ghosts 1-4, it is basically a precursor to what Trent later did in his movie works. Some of my favorites are 38 and 4.  Also Trent's side project How To Destroy Angels could be similar in sound to those soundtracks - The Loop Closes could be an example.  If you want to get into NIN in general, that another thing. Depends what kind of music do you enjoy. Electronic? Go for Year Zero. Heavy guitar? Go for Broken. Complex layered masterpieces? Go for Fragile. There is something for everybody in NIN's music"

nin,38a7w3,abxc,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:20:18 2015 UTC,"Coming from his scores - I would start with Still - not as much screaming, angry guitars, and industrial noise. If you still dig NIN, move to The Fragile (in its entirety, no cherry picking songs!). If you dig that, The Downward Spiral (my personal favorite album). His newer stuff (Year Zero, The Slip, Hesitation Marks) and older stuff (Pretty Hate Machine, Broken) are all great in their own right, but you have to pick an order, so the above is what I would suggest."
nin,38a7w3,Gymrat777,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"Start with With Teeth. it's by far and away the most accessible. I'd reccomend then watching beside you in time, as you will get a 'modern' performance of a set of songs through the history of the band.  Would probably then go to The Slip, then The Fragile, then TDS, then PHM, then Broken. Personally, anyway."
nin,38a7w3,grodecki,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"If you haven't yet, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is incredible and will fall right in line with his other scores.   As far as NIN, I would say check out the songs ""And All That Could Have Been"", ""The Great Below"", and ""Lights in The Sky"".

I will still argue that Woodstock 94 was their best show ever.  On the flip side, I can't argue that the way how Trent's aged (unlike most artists from his time, and especially Manson, he's gotten BETTER with age) and the fact that he's now a successful business owner/manager, married, has kids of his own, and has had critical acclaim for work past NIN, the man has never left his prime because he keeps rising up. Seriously, for all what can be said about TDS, Fragile, and Broken this last decade has really let him show his intellect in ways never before."

In the Fragile image, it looks pretty straight'ish compared to other waterfalls. It's also one of the only pics that has the same angle that I could make out.

Tapeworm never released any recordings, but was frequently referenced in interviews.

Through the years the group expanded and evolved numerous times to include artists such as Maynard James Keenan, Atticus Ross, and Alan Moulder, effectively turning the project into a supergroup. After many years of rumors and expected release dates, Reznor announced the end of the project in 2004.

Literally there was less than ten people there, so its not like he was being mobbed.  As a musician, yeah, he's had quite the career.

Rather than saying these things and assigning release dates, I wish he would just mention what he's currently working on with the stipulation that it may or may not ever see the light of day (which we would be wise to understand by now). That would make me much happier. I'd rather know what he's working on so I can judge for myself the likeliness of its completion and have hopes based on actual effort put in.

I think I have given out enough solid info over the years for you to trust me so here it is.... it's being Trent'd. Whats that mean? The same thing it always does - hes very busy  with all of his endeavors but wants to cram as much content and features in it that he possibly can so while the release date is laughable, remember that its always worth it in the end. Also, before we even knew the Tension DVD was a thing, we all woke up to find 1 hour of footage from 1 show in HD for free on YouTube.... so I think that more than buys him as much time as he wants to release the full version. And yes I know, The Fragile release has been a myth in the NIN community for years but when that surfaces, Im sure it will be worth every delay. I mean up until recently he said he found some demos and unreleased tracks that he would love to include as a bonus."

He's done so many things, and learned quite a bit, both as a person and a lyricist. It's almost as if, with Hesitation Marks, he harkens back to his early work, while at the same time, keeping things fresh and innovative, in ways I feel he hadn't reached before. Personally, my favorite tracks off HM are Various Methods, Find My Way, and most of all While I'm Still Here. I could say so many things about that song."
nin,37bdot,Caseman984,3,Sun May 31 04:28:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. While I'm Still Here is definitely a good song. Hesitation Marks is a very... matured album for Reznor. I like HM, it's too bad it doesn't get talked about more. There is a lot to be said about the album. I don't know about other people, but I wasn't immediately enthralled by it. It took a couple play-throughs before it really set in for me."

nin,37bdot,explohd,2,Tue May 26 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"I mean...as far as NIN lyrics go, Pretty Hate Machine is the best example of the bedroom confessional-style lyrics that NIN typically has. I think it's fair to compare a band's lyrics to their own lyrics for a comparison like this, since there's no other band that is Nine Inch Nails.  Overall, I'd say that Year Zero's lyrics are separate from everything else NIN has done. NIN lyrics are typically introspective to the point of being insular, but on this album, the subject matter is obviously different. Saul Williams' assistance in writing lyrics is apparent, as the lyrics are more abstract, more surreal, and have a level of nuance and flavor that Trent simply does not have. In my opinion, it is one of the reasons that the album didn't do as well, despite being fantastic. NIN is typically raw emotion on the lyricism side, and immaculate production on the music side."

For that he always reign supreme, but I think he contributes the same energy he did then as he does now, and is a big part of the modern NIN live experience.

nin,3774rc,nrtphotos,3,Tue May 26 00:53:40 2015 UTC,"Robin Finck is the guitarist for NIN, especially live. Theres a reason Axl Rose wanted him and buckethead for chinese democracy (im not talking that album up, just sayin). Watch the woodstock 94 (?) NIN show and see the aggression and awesomeness that is Robin Finck playing the guitar. As further evidence is his awesomeness: ""i know now that when i dig in the mud, i'm gonna get dirty as hell and wish for a swim. then when wrapped in white linen, i'll secretlt start to sweat and stink. and so it is. by these years - i'll suppose you're suggesting in the flesh and on the planet. what comes up for me now is consistent. the more i learn, and the greater i attune my attention with something beyond this little life of mine and yours, the more simply my way unfolds. i'm much more consciously aware of how my thoughts and actions bring immediate situation and circumstance to my life. and that's hard to unlearn. try as i might. isee the me-to-be bathed in an obvious colour and dancing wild desire out loud on your lawn. a posture preluding silence."""
nin,3774rc,WretchedMonkey,5,Tue May 26 01:33:18 2015 UTC,I got to see him play the solo to We're In This Together Now right in front of my face. Melted it right off.   And when he used to tweet he tweeted some weird ass shit that didn't make sense.   He's a cool dude.

nin,3774rc,PSININ,2,Tue May 26 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"I've always considered Finck to be the #2 guy in NIN. I know Alessandro Cortini has had a great amount of influence in NIN albums in recent years, but Finck is one of the longest-lasting touring members. To me his style and more importantly his tone is perfect for NIN.  Personally I felt like Aaron North went against what I think Reznor stands for musically. Yes, North had the energy and chaotic stage presence, but I imagine Reznor demands some standard of performing. I really couldn't stand watching North sling his guitar around and sometimes not even play the part.   I kinda get why some people prefer North sometimes - and again this is just my preference - but I believe Robin Finck is the best guitarist to have ever played with NIN."

nin,36t6fq,kyleclements,6,Fri May 22 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a custom framing shop, and paintings in this style were very common.  Generally, commercial painters will take inspiration from Hans Hoffman (squares of different colours and textures) and rather than explore optical space, they use trendy colours to make bland,  inoffensive art to sell to people.  To find out what the trendy colours are: take a Sears catalog, look at the curtains and towels, and match the colours.  If the painting doesn't sell, some squares will be over painted with updated colours, to match the next season.  This looks a lot better than the ones I handled."
nin,36t6fq,farfigneugan,2,Fri May 22 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"In your opinion, would you call this painting's resemblance a happy coincidence?"
nin,36t6fq,kyleclements,1 point,Fri May 22 06:28:37 2015 UTC,"Beige and grey is a very common colour scheme, so I'd say it's very possible this is just a coincidence.  Saying that, the paintings I described tend to be a lot thicker.  This looks like something that a little more care went into than an average frame shop square painting, so it very well could be a nin fan, TDS inspired work, but based on the shear number of similar paintings I've seen, I'm more 80/20 than 50/50 on this one."

His videos/photos are hilarious.    I maybe be wrong about this, but I think he's the pioneer of the orgasmic double bass at the end ""Wish"" live. Go to the 3:50 mark of this video to hear what I'm talking about. I never heard the double bass till Freese started playing it, and I know Ilan does it as well."

Like everyone else that TR puts his faith in, he has an unbelievable ability to execute his craft without fail, night after night. My drummer buddy (who also loves NIN), has told me, however, that while Freese is a fantastic studio drummer, he doesn't do much new and interesting with his craft. I have no idea if this is true or an appropriate criticism, but I thought I'd mention it to see what other, more knowledgeable people might say."
nin,36rdgj,Gymrat777,4,Thu May 21 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"He's considered to be one of the greatest studio drummers not just of his era but ever.  That being said he's never gonna show you a lot of flash.  He's never gonna completely amaze your average casual music fan.  He's just one incredibly solid drummer.  You can always expect him to show up and do his job better than anyone else is capable of doing it.  I'm not sure if that qualifies as a criticism.    On the other hand, here's a video of him challenging another drummer (who is considered to be an innovator in most circles) to a drum off, and completely blowing him out of the water."

Not only is he incredibly talented, he is also such a showman. I can't help but focus on him during performances. The way he swings his arms up into the air makes his drumming look effortless. The Line Begins to Blur is one of my favorite examples. Along with Head Down and In This Twilight.  Bottom line, he kicks ass, and he's got a great sense of humor."

Neat to see, but yeah...it feels a little shoehorned. But...like that Walking Dead episode awhile back - if it gets curious people to check out The Fragile? I have a hard time thinking that's wrong.

Sure, Trent had the logo, but it seems that everything before he brought Rob on-board was just contract work to whoever. Afterward, it's been very consistent and, at that, consistently beautiful. Dude is a catch."
nin,36gv2c,NtheLegend,11,Tue May 19 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"I really like the glitch art aesthetic he brought to Nine Inch Nails. I don't know much about art, but it feels as though he could be one of the people who really popularized this art direction in the mainstream."

I was checking out his site and was very interesting in purchasing a copy of ""Troublemaker"" but it was out of stock.  I figured I had nothing to lose so I emailed Rob to see if he would ever release more.  Within a day, I received a reply thanking me for my interest and letting me know that he might do others in the future with the ""Troublemaker"" in a different color.  I thought it was really cool that he replied to me personally when I really didn't expect any answer.  Fast forward several years and I was at a NIN concert.  We had floor tickets but were standing in front of the mixing board so we could take in the whole visual experience.  I happened to look back and holy crap..there was Rob Sheridan.  I guess he had been wandering the arena and taking pictures.  I got his attention, said I realize he was busy but just wanted to say hello and say that I was a fan of his art.  Once again he was very cordial and seemed genuinely appreciative of a fan.  He just seems like a down to earth, talented guy that has one of the most awesome jobs on the planet."

nin,35xu6v,kleiner352,7,Fri May 15 04:01:34 2015 UTC,"nascentia has given an excellent list. A lot of the stuff he mentions is on the heavier Industrial-Metal side, particularly Ministry and KMFDM. Along those lines you won't do much better than Killing Joke, especially anything after 1990's 'Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions' (their earlier stuff is excellent as well, but more post-punk than Industrial). Also, Excessive Force (a KMFDM side-project), MDFMK (another KMFDM side-project), Schwein (a <PIG> side-project), Lard (a Ministry/Foetus mini-supergroup), ohGr (from Skinny Puppy)'s solo albums, Machines Of Living Grace, Shotgun Messiah's 'Violent New Breed' (the lead singer joined KMFDM right after this album came out and has a great solo album as SKOLD) and Iron Lung Corporation. If you can get your hands on anything by the one-man-band Prick it's some of the best Industrial you've ever heard. The one man is Kevin McMahon, the guy who gave Trent his first break as a musician.  For more 'pure' industrial, try Front 242, Foetus, Pigface (a supergroup Trent was a member of at one point), Young Gods, Laibach, Revolting Cocks, Einsturzende Neubauten. Cubanate is excellent, and just released an amazing EP with <PIG>. Primitive Race is a new supergroup just about to release their first EP in a couple of weeks, with a full album to follow later this summer. It's shaping up to be one of the best Industrial releases in years. Peter Murphy (from Bauhaus)'s last album is produced by one of the guys from Killing Joke and it is fierce.  For more electronic stuff, but still heavy, Nitzer Ebb, Acumen Nation and :Wumpscut: are great (although :W: gets very repetitive after a few albums). Also, Evil Mothers, Circle Of Dust, Controlled Bleeding, Click Click, YouthCode and some of the EBM bands like VNV Nation.  For the poppy-but-heavy elements, Carpark North is a great virtually-unknown group that really deserves more attention. Not Industrial really, but I've found fans of NIN to dig Carpark North as well. Along those lines, but even more poppy and with a female singer, Republica.  For female-led projects, Jane Jensen can be totally awesome and Diamanda Galas is just fucking weird. Kidneythieves are not the most original Industrial band you've ever heard, but they do what they do really fucking well.  Paul Cusick is a great Industrial/Prog artist with a couple of really solid albums.  For moody stuff, Congo Norvell is awesome. For '80s-esque awesomeness, Love & Rockets. You should also check out Nick Cave just because he's fucking brilliant."
nin,35xu6v,half-bitch-half-fish,4,Thu May 14 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"kleiner352 mentioned David Bowie, I'm going to say something separately here. By himself taken at face value Bowie's a bad example, because he's covered so many genres. His album Outside is the most like NIN, on account of it actually being an Industrial. Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), Low, Heathen & Earthling are all fairly NIN-y, but in different ways (Scary Monsters in terms of lyric content, the rest in terms of music style). And I'm pretty sure The Man Who Sold The World was one of Reznor's influences as a child.  P.S. A Warm Place from The Downward Spiral is a song Reznor wrote that turned out to sound incredibly like Bowie's Crystal Japan"
nin,35xu6v,octopus_enormous,2,Fri May 15 05:28:56 2015 UTC,"There are already some fantastic recommendations here. I just want to repeat one though which is Alessandro Cortini's solo projects. SONOIO's Blue and Red albums are fantastic, as well as all related releases/material, and his various other projects are all great. He's been such a big part of NIN for ten years now and his solo work is wonderful. If you like Year Zero-style NIN, you'll love SONOIO stuff.  Things I don't see mentioned yet I'd offer:  Smashing Pumpkins, seriously. Stylistically very different but similar era/hey-day and timeline and another 90's band featuring distortion, abrasiveness, stylistic changes album to album, big risks at points, a core member who is the lead singer/songwriter and performer in studio who has carried the band name and some incredible music. The best albums to check out if you're interested are Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and Adore or Machina (Machina has a lot more of the fuzz/distortion and loudness you might be looking for and I'd strongly recommend it, as well as Machina II but that's something that if you're unfamiliar with the band, don't worry about, there's plenty of fans who don't even know it's a thing). Also shoutout to the SP sub I help mod /r/spcommunity which I'd obviously recommend. There's a whole lot of darkness to Smashing Pumpkins in a lot of ways; themes of child abuse, divorce, relationship struggles, depression and pressure from success and pressure from yourself fill so much of Billy Corgan's lyrics. He taps into a lot of similar subject matter as Trent. Adore is something Corgan at one point criticized retrospectively as being too much of a ""death march,"" with it being created right after the loss of his mother, the firing of their long-time drummer and his divorce from his wife. The history of the band itself is so tumultuous to look at and fascinating in its own right. Trent also featured a song of theirs on the Lost Highway soundtrack.  Depeche Mode. Completely and totally, Depeche Mode. Specifically for stuff that may remind you of NIN, I'd recommend their albums Violator, Ultra, Playing the Angel and Sounds of the Universe. Amazing, important, wildly influential band. Flood, a producer who helped produce about half of Pretty Hate Machine and then produced The Downward Spiral, worked really closely for years with Depeche Mode. You'll find a lot of that overlap in the sonic approach to stuff. Oh, Flood also helped produce several Smashing Pumpkins records, and SP covered a Depeche Mode song, so it connects well I suppose.  I'd recommend Tim Skold's solo album Anomie quite a bit for some great industrial-tinged louder material. He was a member of KMFDM and Marilyn Manson for quite a while.  And speaking of Marilyn Manson, check out Marilyn Manson. There's a lot of old drama amongst MM and NIN fans and it's largely stupid at this point but oh well. Regardless of what you think of his work later on, the band's first two records were produced by Trent Reznor himself (Portrait of an American Family and Antichrist Superstar). Antichrist Superstar is an absolute masterpiece of a concept album and a lot of people have described it as The Downward Spiral if it were about the apocalypse. It's loud, it's abrasive, it's beautiful, it's grotesque, it's a great album and Trent's constant influence is beyond noticeable. Seriously, a lot of it feels so much like NIN material.  Rammstein is a great way to scratch your more metal itch. Trent was/is a fan of them. Their most loved album is almost certainly Sehnsucht and definitely fits what you're looking for. From there Herzeleid is a great step back to their first album, which is great, to the follow up Mutter, which shows a real shift from their first two albums into what would then become the second half of their discography stylistically. Definitely worth checking out.  Atari Teenage Riot is another act Trent's a fan of and I'd recommend them. Very noisey, very electronic, all around great as well.  David Bowie is pretty much essential listening for anyone who loves music but also with NIN, Trent's an incredibly vocal Bowie fan and has cited Low as the single biggest influence on The Downward Spiral. He's mentioned Scary Monsters as a big influence as well, and A Warm Place actually has an incredibly similar melody as a David Bowie instrumental. His constant reinvention of image and style over the years is very famous and there's certain to be an era or album you'll fall in love with.  Soft Cell was a big influence on early NIN. The Closer to God single has a cover of their incredibly weird song Memorabilia, and they had laid bass tracking with Danny Lohner for a scrapped in studio cover of Sex Dwarf, a song Trent had covered in the earliest live NIN shows before the band was anything but him, a mic, guitar and bunch of loops for him to trigger while opening for Skinny Puppy and the like. Their album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is a fantastic album and you can so hear the influence it then had on shaping what NIN sounded like in the early days.  This is a very oddball recommendation and one you may not actually enjoy, who knows, but Kanye West's Yeezus is very much inspired by NIN and has a lot of flirting with industrial sound and production. Personally it's one of my favorite albums of the decade so far, and I'm a big Kanye fan, but I get that it's not for everyone. Regardless, it's worth giving a fair shot, as a ton of people including Lou Reed acclaimed it. I've said a lot about it and could say a lot more about it here and there in different places and talking to people in person and I think it's just an amazing, fascinating album. The Yeezus tour itself is worth seeing footage from and reminds me a lot of a NIN-level live show and production.   Radiohead/Thom Yorke's solo work might gel well with you. Check out the Radiohead albums Kid A/Amnesiac and Thom Yorke's Eraser. Dark, experimental, electronic; Kid A helped define the time it was released. Trent actually has said their release of Kid A/Amnesiac as two separate albums made from the same sessions made him question if he shouldn't have done the same for The Fragile. I remember being very surprised at my first NIN show while we waited for NIN to come onstage, either Robin or a stagehand behind the curtain tested a guitar by playing the opening notes of Radiohead's Airbag. It was such a surreal moment.  If you have any questions or want to know anything, or just discuss music in general, feel free to message me. I really hope there's something here that fits what you're looking for!"

But definitely not Trent at his absolute best. Various Methods of Escape, I think is fucking epic.   And I think its lyrics are just vague enough to really hit home for a lot of people and have that universal appeal. Again, not a music marketing guy or anything, but I could see a lot of people digging that track."
nin,35egi8,CDC_,2,Sun May 10 00:31:47 2015 UTC,"Came Back Haunted is just a poorly executed single. The song is average and fairly generic - plus, the video is just terrible, regardless of who directed it.   NiN has a whole history of badly executed singles, like Starfuckers (terrible video) and We're in this Together Now (great song, bad video . . . and why did he play ""The Fragile"" at the VMAs)? Survivalism is definitely not the best (nor catchiest) song on Year Zero. And so on."

nin,35egi8,michaelmourn,1 point,Sat May 9 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"I always thought No, You Don't and Starfuckers, Inc were basically one in the same. Kind of wish Starfuckers was just a b-side on a Fragile single. It's a decent song just kind of takes me out of the album a little, plus it's a little redundant after hearing No, You Don't on the left side."
nin,35egi8,OSLIN,3,Sun May 10 00:15:31 2015 UTC,I've always wondered how Starfuckers made the cut but not 10 Miles High (aside from the vinyl). It just doesn't fit in with the rest of the album for me.  It actually was a b-side on the CD single of The Day the World Went Away.
nin,35egi8,ruuurbag,0,Sun May 10 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"True, I think adding Appendage on the Right, plus either 10 miles high or The new Flesh would have def made it more cohesive. I knew it was a b-side on TDTWWA, I just think that's all it should have been."
nin,35egi8,OSLIN,1 point,Sun May 10 01:23:18 2015 UTC,"I've always thought The Fragile would have been a better record if he had decided to condense it to a single album. As much as I like some of the tracks on the second disc (""The Big Come Down"" might be my favorite track on the whole record), it just doesn't feel as artistically satisfying. Pretty much every song on the first disc - aside from maybe ""No, You Don't"" - is perfect, while the second one has some that seem like they would have been better as B-sides or on a companion album (like ""Underneath it All""). I'm not saying the second disc is bad. I'm just saying it doesn't feel as coherent as the first disc."

nin,35ddq5,ShoegazingStardust,2,Sat May 9 06:46:43 2015 UTC,"This Koolhaus show was my first NIN show. Various things had come up time and time again between the 1994 Barrie show with Soundgarden and later the Toronto MLG show,  1995  with Bowie and then again the Fragility tour in 2000. I was determined that I would see these shows. Craigslist wasn't a thing for me yet and I didn't know about the forums so I went on ebay for tickets cuz Ticketbastard had sold out in seconds (no surprise). I got a single ticket for $150 (face was $45 IIRC). Inside the show I started talking to some people around me. It seemed nobody had actually bought their ticket through ticketbastard. Everyone seemed to know someone who knew someone or they paid scalpers same as me.  Dresden Dolls were the opener and they had the crowd on their side quickly. They kicked ass and set the mood that this was going to be a great show. Pinion started NIN's set. When Trent came out people went nuts but were equally shocked by how good he looked (or big if you will).  It was followed by You Know What You Are. With Teeth had come out just a week before so not everyone was singing along completely but everyone knew the ""DON'T YOU FUCKING KNOW WHAT YOU ARE??!!"" part. It was amazing. Otherwise everyone seemed to know every song and was singing along. I think I pushed myself too hard to get to the front cuz I was feeling super hot after March of the Pigs. The crowd was pushing forward so much that if you jumped in the air, you stayed there. Something I Can Never Have apparently wasn't long enough of a cool down period because as soon as The Hand That Feeds started, with the throbbing bass sound in the intro, I started to feel sick and had to get out. I pushed my way backwards through the crowd and got some air by the open back doors. A first aid person saw my dry heaves and was trying to get me out of the show for the night. I protested, through dry heaves, that if he tried he'd have to pull me out lifeless cuz I'd waited too long to see this show. He relented and gave me a bottle of water and let me go after a minute. Back in the pit, I heard Home and Burn for the first time. Burn completely blew my mind and later sent me on a days long Limewire search (I should've asked someone at the show). I stayed in the pit the rest of the show. What I remember most distinctly about this show is during Hurt I was getting dripped on. The crowd had been so awesome that the ceiling was now sweating on us. It was both cool and disgusting. I seem to remember a little bit of stage trashing after Head Like A Hole but that could just be a memory I've wishfully created. If anyone can confirm or deny for me that would be great but I have enough great memories from this show.  Sorry for the wall"

Then I discovered his work in The New Regime, and realized that he is, much like TR, an extremely talented multi-instrumentalist and songwriter (not just a drummer). Then, on top of that he co-owns and actively works with Q Drum Co, which makes some incredibly beautiful looking and sounding drums that are works of art in their own right. He also seems to be, from all accounts, a really humble guy, which to me is as important as the quality of work you deliver.  At this point, Ilan and TR are very close to the same level of inspirations to me. I can't help but admire both of their work (and their work ethic) a great deal."

Wish Squarepusher's was a bit more mindblowing than it was.  I have listened to The Prodigy's quite a bit so that's a sign I've somewhat enjoyed it.  Everything I'm really excited for hasn't come out yet (that's an album), I've picked up a few 12"" and 1 7"" EPs from hip hop artists over here in Aus. ""Idol Hands"" by Dyl Thomas & Flu is pretty great, nothing like last year's RSD drop from the same label though, its real good though.   I'm waiting for something to blow my mind, nothin's topped last year for me at the moment. There was too much. (I'm saying this because a lot of my favourite albums in the past I wasn't aware they came out until well after, like QOTSA in 2013, I first listened to it last year).   I'm counting of Chemical Brothers, J.Viewz, Seth Sentry and Vents to bring some great stuff. And possibly Tool. I heard Puscifer might be dropping something too. shrugs I might be missing a few releases this year, it's been a jumble because I listen to too much to keep track of."

Letting You * 4. Discipline * 5. Echoplex * 6. HTDA - BBB (seamlessly transitions to Head Down) * 7. Head Down * 8.  Lights in the Sky * 9.  Corona Radiata * 10. HTDA - Space in Between (I never liked the fact that there were two instrumentals together on the album and feel that this really helps to keep The Slip from dragging out towards the end. It also is a very good transition both in the beginning and end) * 11. The Four of Us Are Dying * 12. HTDA - Parasite (I just think this sets up Demon Seed better and again keeps the pace up for the 2nd half of the album) * 13. Demon Seed    Try this order out and see what you think.

I still remember working as a projectionist when Book of Eli was playing, I used to frequently go into the theater during the credits and listened to the track that played..   What I love about AR and TR working together is the dynamic that they bring to each other, like listening to each track, you can easily figure out who was dominate in the production for each track. For instance, listen to Sugar Storm - Gone Girl, I feel like Atticus had the most influence on this track. As oppose to something like What If we Could - TGWTDT, sounds highly Trent influenced.   Then together, they create beautiful tracks like Technically Missing - Gone Girl. Atticus playing the slow melody of synths and drones, and the Trent comes in with the keys and guitar at the 1:30 minute mark. Then erupting into a melodic chaos.   Hate me for saying this, but when I seen HTDA live in Chicago, Trent for sure took the show. But I was more excited to see Atticus up on the stage."

It's not exactly clear to me what is his part in the group, how much he is involved in the writing process and how much does he have to say in the sound of all those records. But he has hand in everything Trent has done in the last 10 years. That's a lot.  It makes me wonder how much would Trent's sound change if he tried to work with somebody else. I think Trent tried working with Markus Dravs (Arcade Fire, Coldplay,..) for Hesitation Marks but it didn't work out for some reason. So there must be some kind of chemistry between Trent and Atticus that allows them to cooperate for so many years."

I was so pumped for the album.  I remember the first time I heard ""The Hand That Feeds"" on the radio. I had just got out of college for the day and got into my car and the first words I heard was ""new Nine Inch Nails."" I momentarily freaked out and just sat in the parking lot listening.  This album also led to the first time I heard of MySpace. About a week before it came out they put the whole thing up for streaming on the band's MySpace page. I think I finished ""All the Love in the World"" before I stopped listening. I was on dial up and the stream had to buffer every 15 seconds or so. Not ideal listening conditions.  Then the album came out and I had a long, long day. I had college that morning and had to be their before stores opened. After that I had to pick up my fiance because we had to meat with some people about an apartment we were trying to get. I convinced her to let me stop off at Best Buy to get the album since it was on the way. Got to listen to a bit on the way to the apartment and leaving the apartment. We went back to her parents house and her little sister talked us into going to see Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Internally I was just screaming ""I just want to put headphones on and listen to With Teeth!"" I didn't get home until about 9 that night and then I finally got to listen to the album. Good times.

nin,34pt9p,courteous_coitus,2,Sun May 3 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"With Teeth is easily my least favourite NIN album, but I think it's significant for how much of a break it is from Trent's older work.    His vocals really seemed to be kicked up a notch, and it sounded like for the first time, Trent wasn't hiding behind anything, he was just putting it all out there as straightforwardly and directly as possible.  Beside You In Time live, with the light show and the shattering at the ending is one of the greatest live music moments ever."
nin,34pt9p,teleekom,2,Mon May 4 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that its probably my least favorite album but I often play the album because its not a depressing ride like TDS or The Fragile. Year Zero isn't as rocky, and The Slip feels short. But overall it has my least favourite songs.   However when I make a nin mix, With Teeth and The Line Begins to Blur always makes the list. I love those songs. And live it sounds so good."

nin,34qi9r,HeartShapedNutshell,14,Sun May 3 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"Someone will come along and call me a monster of a fan boy for sure, but The Downward Spiral is one of those albums that, imo, has no companion.  It is just so perfect, and I've never seen it matched by another band/artist."
nin,34qi9r,ScarletSpider0725,5,Sun May 3 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"No, it's true.  The thing about NIN is that there's really nothing else like NIN.  I mean, in the most literal sense, TR designs so many of his own sounds, and while it's not technically impossible to recreate, no one really has, to my knowledge.    You can find similar stuff in any of the major industrial projects (Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, etc), but there's a marked difference between NIN and industrial, which was why he was able to breakthrough to the mainstream instead of being relegated to goth clubs."
nin,34qi9r,Mentalpopcorn,2,Sun May 3 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily talking about the genre though, more or less the emotion or feeling that comes across in the album, The Downward Spiral and In Utero are both sound-wise harsh and abrasive albums with few periods of calm that focus on nihilistic and depressing themes and topics ranging anywhere from abusive relationships, rape, drug abuse, politics, existentialism and suicide. They both feature self-destructive vocalists (Trent Reznor and Kurt Cobain) who use contrast in their works; for example, singing quietly and melodically before screaming out the next verse or chorus. The two albums have very strong use of visual textures that can be felt through the music and an all-around feeling that just can't be described."
nin,34qi9r,Mentalpopcorn,2,Sun May 3 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm fair.  Bit of a long shot but you might like Riverside's Anno Domini album.  Not quite as depressive or abrasive but at least subjectively I get a similar feeling of epicness as I do from TDF and say, Tool's 10,000 Days.   Have you gotten into Type O Negative at all?  There's a lot of depressing themes in that along with alternating between singing/screaming, but it's a bit slower.  Check out World Coming Down."
nin,34qi9r,teleekom,1 point,Sun May 3 23:24:07 2015 UTC,Love me some Riverside. Definitely didn't expect to see this band here.   When we are on the topic of prog rock I think maybe In Absentia or Deadwing from Porcupine Tree convey similar emotion to Downward Spiral. Steven Wilson doesn't really write very happy songs I think his music can be similar in lot of ways to Trent's

nin,34qi9r,MRicci,1 point,Mon May 4 01:20:52 2015 UTC,Yes. Antichrist superstar because Trent worked on it around the same time he did TDS and you can completely hear his influence in it. He also plays a few instruments on it.

nin,34m5aq,bogart24,7,Sat May 2 12:23:08 2015 UTC,"these are the main differences   ""The Day the World Went Away"" has a longer guitar intro ""The Wretched"" has an extended outro ""Even Deeper"" features an elongated middle section ""La Mer"" has a longer intro and an extended ending with more speech samples ""Pilgrimage"" does not fade in, but rather begins building without any volume adjusting ""The Mark Has Been Made"" does not feature the introduction of ""10 Miles High"" fading in at the end (the hidden bit of music in the pre-gap of ""Please"" on the CD version) ""I'm Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally"" begins with the full strings sample ""Ripe"" does not include the ""With Decay"" ending section, but rather fades out as the slinking guitars play the main riff ""The Wretched,"" ""We're in This Together,"" ""Even Deeper,"" ""Pilgrimage,"" ""The Mark Has Been Made,"" ""10 Miles High,"" ""The New Flesh"" and ""I'm Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally"" all do not crossfade as on the CD version, because these songs either end or begin their respective sides   also do me a favor and stay away form the red version"
nin,34m5aq,rd1994,4,Sat May 2 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"If you're wondering why it's so expensive, it was only printed during its original release back in 1999, and so there are a limited number of copies available."
nin,34m5aq,jagrove425,2,Sat May 2 13:31:27 2015 UTC,"I bought a copy when it was first released, along with the CD version. The vinyl version is my favorite edition, mostly because I like the way 10 Miles High and The New Flesh fit with the other tracks. A few of the other songs are slightly different versions as well. Ripe is a bit shorter (the title doesn't have ""With Decay""), and there are extended versions of a few tracks (The Day the World Went Away, Even Deeper and La Mer, if I remember correctly). Having said all of that, it's not fundamentally different from the CD version. If you have the the two extra songs somewhere else, you probably don't need it. But for a collector, it's different enough from the other versions that it's significant and highly sought after. Also, having the vinyl sized linear notes with a few additional images is cool.   I don't know anything about a red disc version though."
nin,34m5aq,bluecalx2,2,Sat May 2 12:19:14 2015 UTC,"I owned it until recently. The packaging is beautiful and all. I just sold it because I felt bad that I dropped so much cash on it and also I'm patiently awaiting Trent's remastered edition. Compared to the other NIN records I own, this is by far the best sounding one there is (especially compared to the ""Null"" era albums). I was truly impressed by the depth and dynamics of the record. It was even hard to believe at times that I was listening to what is technically an inferior and outdated format.   If you feel you really need this in your collection and want to experience it in a whole different way, then dropping cash on this is worth it as long as you can find a copy in good, clean condition. There's some nice high quality rips of this floating around on the web if you want to hear the differences without having to hunt one down and spend that much cash.  Also as others have said, the red is a bootleg, so beware. I believe there is also a black version that is a bootleg. There is a sticker either on the front or back cover attached directly to the jacket (whereas the original only had a sticker on the shrinkwrap). I'd say a majority of the copies floating around are legit though, so while it's good to keep an eye out for boots I wouldn't stress too much about it. Look around on Discogs and NINCatalog and you'll get more info on the several variations of both the official and unofficial releases."

No vocals and stretched instrumentals, electronics, etc.  The 2013/14 Sanctified is probably the most immediate to come to mind but it's been linked and is definitely the more obvious answer. Still a totally incredible take on the song though.  March of the Pigs live has almost always been a blend of the studio version and the remix All the Pigs, All Lined Up. Oddly enough they did the studio version with no added reprise at the end in Australia last year at least once. I think it's become such a common thing that none of us really even think about it but it's definitely unique that they play it the way they do.  Only on the LITS tour had that really interesting guitar intro from Robin IIRC.  Trent doing the lyrics from Closer during All Time Low was a neat twist and definitely unexpected but I don't know if I'd call it a big difference or going off the script too much so to speak."

nin,340yvc,rd1994,3,Mon Apr 27 17:32:09 2015 UTC,"a little more backstory Quote: Hello everybody. I've been doing a lot of European press lately and they've been mentioning the various configurations of 'the fragile' and wondering if there was a reason (other than to make the hard-core fan buy them all) to have some different tracks on them.  If you're curious, here's why. We agonized over the sequencing of the record and focused solely on the CD config. as the definitive one. After the decision was made to move to two CDs the problem then became removing tracks to get the right feel and flow.  Taking the new flesh' off the CD was a tough call because Alan and myself really like the track, but it destroyed the balance and it just didn't fit.  When we assembled the cassette, we now had four beginnings and endings to contend with instead of two of each (for the CD) follow? It worked out pretty well just dividing the songs up, but we wanted the A sides of the cassettes to be slightly longer than the B sides (so that when the tape flips over you are not in the middle of the first song on that side). We added the 'appendage' to 'please' to make that work.  For the vinyl, the decision to move to three discs was based on fidelity. (you can only fit so many minutes on a side of vinyl before it degrades the sound)  So now we are faced with SIX beginnings and endings. Simply splitting the sides up didn't work as well this time so we decided to include the other two tracks we had been considering ('10 miles high' and 'the new flesh') as well as use the full unedited versions of all the other songs on the record. The vinyl sequencing has actually grown on me lately as a viable alternate! -just thought you might want to know"

Apart from simply the brilliant title of the piece, to me, this song is equally as, if not a bit more poignant and beautiful than Leaving Hope, in the same simple yet gradually accumulating way that reaches something of a breathtaking crescendo. Maybe The Persistence of Loss is considered uncharacteristic of NIN, but it is a song of which I believe anyone who really appreciates music (not to sound elitist, just to say that I think it's quite accessible), even if they don't like Trent's other work, would be unable to deny the power."

Something about it just makes me get the anger out, even though its not too angry of a song, other times I just sit back and relax with its soundscapes. Plus its cool hearing the strange mix of re-used sounds from the other tracks.  Another one for me has to be And All That Could Have Been.  It's clearly a Fragile B-side that has all the trademarks of a classic. It just didn't fit the flow of the album. Makes you wonder about the other B-sides that didn't make it."

A reviewer cannot be wrong about art, because they are stating their own opinion. The only purpose they serve is for people  who feel similarly about albums/games/TV shows/books they have reviewed and trust whether something new is likely, or not likely to match up to their likes or dislikes.

nin,33yur6,Leviathant,5,Sun Apr 26 23:43:49 2015 UTC,"""Due to the more dynamic mastering"" is misleading. The EQ might be different in a way that you find more pleasing, but the CD definitely has better dynamic range than the vinyl. You can't reproduce the Even Deeper kick on vinyl the way it's done on the CD because your needle will skip. How does a mastering engineer deal with that? Compression.  Tom Baker mastered The Fragile, and has spoken in interviews about how when CDs first came out, mastering engineers all around were relieved that consumers could finally hear what it sounded like in the studio. With vinyl, you literally carve out a chunk of the audio, then re-introduce it with your stereo's equalizer. With the CD, you're preserving the signal chain, and with a higher available dynamic range (and stereo separation) than is physically possible with vinyl.  Saying nothing of the sequencing and the extended mixes, the audio you hear on the CD is closer to the audio you hear in the studio especially in the case of Nine Inch Nails, because Trent's been working off Pro Tools since before it was called Pro Tools. All the work is done in the digital domain. The vinyl releases are more about packaging, presentation, and interaction, and less about fidelity.  Having said all that - yeah, if you haven't heard the vinyl version of the album, it's a real treat. Getting that on Blu Ray (or the equivalent) is really one of the main reasons I want to see the release of a Fragile deluxe edition."

While they are a guitar-heavy band (moreso in the 90s), the guitar sounds are often so altered that it's difficult to even hear what they are playing, let alone play along.  It's one of the things I love about them. I sit there going ""WOAH what did they do to that guitar...? Is that even a guitar?"" Then I put the guitar down and just start enjoying the song. Or play along to Queen."

nin,33qgof,zachwho,14,Fri Apr 24 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"He didn't though. Yes, there are some similarities and we all know Trent loves Apple, but this would be beneath him. Even if he was willing to do it, it wouldn't make sense for Apple to hire Trent Reznor as an uncredited composer. His status makes him way more expensive than the hundreds of composers who are able to pull off the same thing for a fraction of the cost, so they definitely would've dropped his name for extra hype if they did use his music."
nin,33qgof,bandlek,11,Fri Apr 24 21:38:48 2015 UTC,I agree with all points said here.  I think a lot of people in this sub need to listen to more ambient electronic music.
nin,33qgof,HogwildMcgee9000,2,Fri Apr 24 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure about that. I'm not saying he composed any of it, but I wouldn't see why he wouldn't do it. He's always been fairly comfortable with anonymity, and if it wasn't part of an NIN work or part of his own body of work/art, I'd think he would be fine with it going un-credited.. especially when it's an advertisement. Let's be honest. Trent has a loyal fanbase, but he isn't among the worlds most popular or familiar artists, and he likes it that way. Many consumers forking out their $ for i-Crap wouldn't even know who he is. Plus, he seems more interested in 'working', and working hard, these days.. he's never been into over-promoting his own name."
nin,33qgof,-euphoriac-,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:55:46 2015 UTC,He did the beats commercial.
nin,33qgof,Hyemp,3,Sat Apr 25 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"You mean this? That's not uncredited though. He's one of the big names attached to Beats. They give him credit on the video and he's even narrating it, so that's hardly the same thing. Also, they used a track from Ghosts rather than have him make custom music for the commercial, which is not that different from using NIN music in movie trailers, which happens all the time."
nin,33qgof,bandlek,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:41:12 2015 UTC,"He does technically work for Apple now, since they purchased Beats.  So if he was to do a commercial, it would probably make sense he'd do it for the company he worked for. But this sounds sort of like Trent, but it could have easily been someone else."
nin,33qgof,GetReady72,5,Mon Apr 27 17:27:26 2015 UTC,Agreed - it's a little too upbeat sounding for his usual sound.  Even Ghosts material just has a darker undercurrent to the tracks.

nin,33fsvx,BeefAngus,6,Wed Apr 22 04:08:03 2015 UTC,"Well there's the infamous 2/10 pitchfork review.  Also from what I understand it was controversial release from the fans perspective, because it was vastly different from anything Trent has done up to that point. People learned to appreciate it over time. I wouldn't say it was commercial or critical flop, but it wasn't as of a success as Downward Spiral was. Even now, when articles are going with one album that defines NIN, they go with Downward Spiral, even though I think objectively Fragile is more complex, and subjectively better work.   It was definitely underappreciated at the time of the release. Maybe it still is"
nin,33fsvx,teleekom,15,Wed Apr 22 06:02:05 2015 UTC,I believe the review says more about Pitchfork than The Fragile.
nin,33fsvx,noise-nut,3,Wed Apr 22 20:11:58 2015 UTC,"did that guy have the balls to take it back or did he stick to his guns?  To be honest, it was very difficult for me to get into it, but once you insist and really start listening, it turns out to be a masterpiece."
nin,33fsvx,DannieBGoode,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:48:17 2015 UTC,"Pitchfork was the outlier. I remember the reviews as being overwhelmingly glowing. There's even a one-sheet that Nothing Records put out, with Fragile artwork, and quotes from Rolling Stone, Spin, and a few other magazines. Despite all the press support, it crashed really hard in the charts - The Fragile is not an album that you can absorb in a week. After that crash, all label support dried up. Because of that, and because of creative accounting by Trent's manager at the time, the US Fragility tour was co-sponsored by MTV2. The tour (with A Perfect Circle as an opening band, prior to releasing their debut album) was well received, selling out a great number of shows.  The first single, The Day The World Went Away, was super weird because it had no drums... but it got a tun of airplay. Some stations also played a version of Starfuckers that they'd self-censored, much to the label's chagrin. We're In This Together was pretty huge, at least on rock radio in central PA."
nin,33fsvx,Leviathant,3,Mon Apr 27 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"When it first came out, I honestly wasn't that big of a fan. I was still blasting songs like Wish and Ruiner through my stereo with pride. After a time though, I started to notice all the little sounds and textures that is on the album. It didn't take long for Ruiner to be replaced with Somewhat Damaged as one of my most played tracks.  I was the self proclaimed biggest NIN fan among my friends, so their reception to the album was pretty lackluster.  Today, I love The Fragile. I believe it to be the panicle of Trent's career.  But, seeing NIN perform the song The Fragile on MTV about the time of the albums release, did make me a bit sad.   35/M for reference."

If you were fortunate enough to be online and in the right circles there was a ton of hype and intrigue as nin.com itself morphed on a daily basis.   Tidbits of songs were leaked with the earliest being clips of Metal, which didn't make it onto the album. Napster was still in its infancy and hadn't taken off yet and thus IRC was the place. #nin99 was the channel that launched theninhotline.   The tour that followed was part of the evolution of the band. It was like a cross between the earlier tours with production similar to what we see today. Trent hadn't adopted some of his ticks he now has while singing but was a hell of a lot more primal."
nin,33fsvx,imatt,5,Wed Apr 22 12:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm 34. I shoplifted my copy of Pretty Hate Machine from the local Wal-Mart in the podunk Louisiana town I lived in at the time.   I had a Harley Davidson wallet/chain that I'd carved the logo into the back of.

nin,33fsvx,juskajo,2,Wed Apr 22 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"I hated it. Stood over it with a hammer. Where was the grit? The catchy hard driving guitars? The wailing synths and goth organs? I wanted an angry album.   I grew out of that initial reaction and consider it now a masterpiece. It's still not my favorite NIN album, but it may be his most creative work. 23 songs, and no two are alike. Production is mindblowing. The thought and care put into it borders on overthinking, but is reigned in just at the brink.  A bit self indulgent, but shouldnt something you're passionate about be a bit obsessed over?"
nin,33fsvx,bluecalx2,2,Wed Apr 22 11:34:31 2015 UTC,"There were a very small handful of ""meh"" songs that took me a while to appreciate (The Mark has Been Made, I'm Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally), but as a whole, loved it.  It was personal.  It was ambitious.  It was self-indulgent, lacked editing, yet somehow was insecure at the same time.  And the reinterpretation of songs during the tour just added to it.  TDS is still my favorite (I was 14 in '94.  Whaddya gonna do), but The Fragile is a masterpiece. I feel lucky to have recognized it at the beginning."
nin,33fsvx,Raidernationprez,2,Thu Apr 23 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"I was in high school.  The die-hard fans all bought and loved it the day of it's release, but nobody else really cared.  There were no solid radio hits on that album, and it didn't really fit the nu-metal scene of that time.  There are so many esoteric hooks/moments that can only be appreciated if you'd listened to/studied every other record over and over.  He performed a song at the VMAs that month, with this new GQ catalogue haircut, and my friends were all 'meh.'  I don't think it was marketed very well at all.  Releasing a double-album after a long hiatus was probably a mistake; there were probably a lot of casual fans who would've bought it, then saw the price tag and thought ""$25??  Fuck that."""
nin,33fsvx,cheeky_fellow,2,Wed Apr 29 11:42:07 2015 UTC,"Very late to this party, but I was in high school and working at record store at the time. To me, it was the most incredible album I had ever heard up to that point (still in my top 10). I think it came out at just the right time when I wanted to hear something complex and layered and covering a wide variety of styles.   But I remember a lot of people returning their copies in the first few weeks. I once tried to talk a guy out of it, saying that he should give it another chance. He was very pissed off and shouted something like, ""Here, you take it then!"" As others have said, it dropped down the charts very, very fast, but we'd still get some NIN fanatics coming in and raving about it. So yes, very divisive."
nin,33fsvx,signofthenine,1 point,Sat May 2 12:39:15 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine swore on it. Up and down. Let and right. I remember really digging the softer songs like The Fragile, The Great Below and the Frail, but really digging Somewhat Damaged. I was 14 at the time, and was not into industrial at the time. The more I listened to it the more I fell in love WITT. I never really listened to it front to back and skipped around alot.   Then I kinda just got bored of it.  16 years later it is one of my favorite albums EVER. The album has taken on much more personal meaning than when I was 14.   I know Maynard from TOOL once said something along the lines of ""it's a fantastic record, but it will take a long time for people to get this/understand it."" which I totally agree with."

"" ""During this period, I decided that the multiple versions of each release were insane and I lost the desire to be a completest fan as I felt taken advantage of. ""  I'm an enormous fan of Nine Inch Nails. And I love vinyl very much. I own little Nine Inch Nails on vinyl, because of the price of the records whenever I've come across them.   The fact of the matter is no one is forcing you to buy records. Record companies are not milking fans for money. They put out a few different versions and options, and maybe you're lucky to get one of them. Or if you consider yourself a die-hard collector, then you hopefully find them all. However, that's the name of the game when it comes to being a hardcore vinyl collector of one specific band. It's always going to be very expensive. I agree that it's a bummer that you can't find The Fragile easily for a reasonable price. But it's going to inevitably be re-released and it will be then.   I used to want to collect the rare stuff when I was younger. But I find as time goes by, I just want to collect great music. So I've got choices. Do I want The Fragile, or do I want to buy 10-15 brand new records... or upwards of 100 used records? I look at that math and just say, sorry NIN, I love you, but I'll wait till you're reasonably priced.   It just makes way more sense to me. That red White Pony is pretty fucking awesome though. I want that."

Yeah I'm one customer, but I wonder how long this lasts with vinyl and when they will go back to being niche with people wondering why the hell they wasted money on multiple versions of the same album with very little real difference. That day will happen, it's when not if."
nin,3398vp,Chaka015,2,Tue Apr 21 05:10:56 2015 UTC,The vast majority of people aren't collecting multiple copies of the same album because one is pink and one is orange. Those are collectors. Those people are niche. And those people will never go away.
nin,3398vp,saratogacv60,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"Collectors are a unique market that is distinct from the larger vinyl market. Putting out different colored albums or other collector geared releases does not negatively affect mainstream vinyl consumers. Another way to look at it is a vintage style mitchell and ness Jersey retails for over $200 but it doesn't affect the price of regular jerseys. The urge for completeness is a self driven desire, that in my opinion is so divorced from the quality of the music that I don't sympathize with this frustration. If collectors what to pay exorbitantly for ""rare"" releases that is on them, as part of their desire is the belief that the album will increase in value. So they think they are getting very out of it."
nin,3398vp,call_me_canvas,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:56:49 2015 UTC,"Nice post, I have similar feelings about records nowadays. I'm probably going to come across sounding like a huge 'it was better before it was cool' hipster or something but whatever. I haven't been buying records as long as you, I think I started about 2007, and the thing that really appealed to me was the rarity of them. There was a part of me that felt if I had say, every NIN halo available on vinyl, then that would be something really impressive to another fan. Now that so many albums are re-released there's nothing impressive about having them because anyone can get them all in a day from a shop. Then as you say, for hardcore collectors it would be a nightmare to track down all the different versions. I know it might seem like a silly thing to worry about, but it has seriously taken away from my interest in buying vinyl. To me they're not really different to CDs now, other than being double the price."

WT has finally grown a bit on me but the Fragile and TDS are absolute masterpieces. Writing in the studio just makes so much sense, rather than ignoring inspiration simply because it's not the right phase of the project...

People who frequent here are mostly die hard NIN fans who own all these recordings already, and as such, I thought it won't be a problem to include download link to this. This has nothing to do with Trent stance on sharing music, it is about a fan community which settled on some sort of a best off album.

nin,31iaft,ricosuave3355,8,Sun Apr 5 09:56:06 2015 UTC,Satellite and Various Methods of Escape both fit lyrically. Satellite also sounds a lot more like a Year Zero track as it has more electronic elements to it.
nin,31iaft,maxx_nitro,3,Sun Apr 5 11:33:45 2015 UTC,"Nice idea, yeah after a listen I think Satellite does fit in nicely with the lyrics and electronics.

nin,31iaft,too_long_didn_t_read,6,Sun Apr 5 12:03:37 2015 UTC,"""Letting You"" from The Slip. Not only do the lyrics sync up, but the official artwork for the song included with the album is the logo for The Resistance. Unlike other songs recommended here, Letting You is ACTUALLY connected."
nin,31iaft,PigLipsDeluxe,2,Sun Apr 5 15:42:23 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, Letting You was actually one of the songs that made me start thinking about this.  it very much fits in the flow of the resistance movement and becoming pawns of the government style themes of Year Zero's storyline.  Reminds me of My Violent Heart and Meet Your Master.  I really like the ""our destiny's been sold"" and ""for us its far too late"" lines, kind of ties in with Zero Sum in that we are simply carrying out our destiny for destruction and could have changed our ways but decided not to, and even comparing the lines ""we are letting you get away with it"" to the ""and you never get away.."" from the consequences of our actions theme in the albums finale. Thanks for the reply!"

nin,31iaft,OSLIN,3,Sun Apr 5 18:50:52 2015 UTC,I always made that connection too when I hear that song. Beautiful line.
nin,31iaft,too_long_didn_t_read,3,Tue Apr 7 04:56:42 2015 UTC,"The song is made so much better considering the context of Year Zero; not just that one line, but all of the lyrics seem to scream of the central theme of Year Zero.   For instance, the opening lyrics, ""Just a reflection. Its just a glimpse, just a little reminder of all the what abouts, and all the might have, could have beens."" I view ""the wretched"" as citizens of the Year Zero society.   Trent had an idea that became a song in 1999, but eight years later the ""reflection"" and ""glimpse"" of that idea was stretched into an entire album (and one of his best albums, in my view)."
nin,31iaft,goldenrule117,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:24:17 2015 UTC,"This lyric from the Wretched is reminiscent of a lyric from David Bowie's, ""Oh!

However just like you said I don't think musically it fits very well.  When fiddling around with trying to make the expanded YZ playlist I tried to cram Lights in the Sky in there somewhere but it just didn't feel right or flow correctly.

Also it has that YZ-esque electronic sound."
nin,31iaft,Ace3000,2,Wed Apr 8 13:33:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure I will list my YZ Expansion playlist on the subreddit and my explanations as to what songs make the cut and how I feel they fit into the Year Zero story once I think I've nailed it.  I'm about 80-90% happy with what I have so far, just tinkering song placement and still on the fence about a few songs I either want to add to YZ or songs on the album to remove. I'm also checking out songs people on here have recommended that I hadn't considered before.    Thanks for your input, I like The Great Collapse. I hadn't thought of that many remixes but I'm liking a few that people have told me about. As for The Line Begins to Blur as of right now it is definitely on there.  In my mind I kind of think it to be a sequel to The Good Soldier. Where in the beginning someone who is a 'good soldier' is doing whatever he is told or commanded while trying to convince himself he is righteous and true even if he's doing horrible things, before eventually starting to see that he is becoming something he never thought possible and now not truly knowing whether is on the right or wrong side.  Anyways won't go into too much depth (I could spout about YZ theories/story lines all day) but I will by happy to throw my finished playlist on here so people can can check it out and listen/critique it once I finish with it!"
nin,31iaft,Ace3000,3,Wed Apr 8 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Isn't there something about solidiers being given drugs in the Year Zero timeline? If so, I really think ""Last"" could fit well into your project, as a glimpse of an amped up soldier in the battlefield, losing his mind more and more with each dose.   Also, I didn't mention this in my other comment, but I have done something similar to what you're planning. I rearranged the Year Zero tracklist and added four or five tracks from Ghosts to give it more room to breathe. I split the instrumental ""Another Version of The Truth"" in two. Part 1 starts the arrangement and part 2 ends it. I called it Another Version of Year Zero and if you get the chance to listen, I'd love to hear what you think.  Looking forward to hearing what you do."
nin,31iaft,treesclrswzrds,2,Wed Apr 8 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man.. just when I think I've finally got the exact songs I want someone mentions another I overlooked. I really like Last lyrically, I agree I can see it as a psychotic doped up soldier/rebel/""angry sniper"" of sorts.  It could serve as a sort of follow up to Vessel in the people being filled up with some kind of drug theme.   I'll work with it a bit and see if I can find a spot for it in my playlist, it's a little tougher to try and fit in older songs so they don't clash sound wise!  Listening to your AVoYZ now, I love it! Glad I'm not the only person who is trying to make their own versions of Year Zero. Pretty cool rearrangements and use of Ghosts tracks, gives the album a fresh feel. The split of Another Version is a good way to bookend the playlist.  I'll give it a few listens for some inspiration. I like how you started of with The Warning, never thought of that.  Currently in my playlist it serves as the middle divider between the build up of the new world order and shit hitting the fan, where humanity is giving one last warning to change its ways or be wiped clean. Obviously and unfortunately mankind doesn't clean up its act in time though and our dirty little hearts get what we deserve!"
nin,31iaft,too_long_didn_t_read,2,Wed Apr 8 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"Glad you're enjoying it! Like I said, I'm definitely interested in hearing your take. What inspired my arrangement was the commercial for Year Zero with the beginning of Another Version of The Truth playing in the background, which shows The Presence. The Warning is all about The Presence and seemed like a good way to kick off the story.   Edit: the more I think about it, the more Last and The Good Soldier work. The chorus of TGS is ""I am trying to believe"" and Last starts with ""Gave up trying to figure it out"". I understand there is a stark difference in style between the songs but I hope you can make it work!"
nin,31iaft,OSLIN,2,Wed Apr 8 22:57:17 2015 UTC,"Year Zero is my favorite NIN album, I can listen to it at any time. Though I think The Downward Spiral and Fragile are better ""quality"" albums, YZ always has a special place in my heart. I didnt become a fan till after With Teeth so YZ was the first album I was impatiently waiting for to come out and was following the ARG closely.  It combines three things I love: NIN, concept albums, and apocalyptic settings!    The Warning might be my favorite track. I love the questions that rises about who are what is giving the warning message to those who feel it, and just what the hell ""the presence"" really is.  The thought that there could be some supernatural or extraterrestrial being that is watching and judging humanity brings the YZ story to another level.    I'll give my playlists a few more listens tomorrow and see if I can get Last in there, or some remix version of it. I can see it fitting in lyrically with a few songs from YZ, just gotta found the right spot for it! The more I listen and study the lyrics the more I want it in there somewhere. I do like the Good Soldier connection, I can definitely see it as an drug addled ex-soldier who has lost his faith and is now just a empty shell of a man. I actually previously made a mini playlist of NIN songs with a friend that told the story of the ""Good Soldier"" and his loss of humanity and becoming the disillusioned Angry Sniper from the ARG, wish I still had it.  Thanks for giving me your input, its awesome hearing another point of view as to what songs connect with the YZ universe!"
nin,31iaft,too_long_didn_t_read,2,Thu Apr 9 00:10:58 2015 UTC,"I feel that the supernatural element is central to both Year Zero, and the entire NIN catalog to some degree. Trent Reznor's issues with God form a path of sorts throughout his discography, from questioning to rebellion to reconsideration. Trent Reznor has admitted that he believes in God, but that is a little known fact among his primarily atheist fan-base. My own faith makes me an anomaly among fans, but I don't care because the music is amazing one way or another. The ""watching you with all of our eyes"" line from The Warning has always been, for me, a reference to biblical angels being described as ""covered in eyes"".    And regarding apocalyptic settings, that was a consuming obsession of mine when Year Zero was released, and I will always love the music and ideas of that album so much because of the relevance it had to me in my own journey at the time it came out."
nin,31iaft,zaprutertape,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:56:51 2015 UTC,"Good insight about Trent, just by listening to his old lyrics I never got the feeling he didn't believe, more so with the direct anger, blame, and questioning about God I always got the feeling he believed in God somehow or at least used to.  When I first got into NIN about a decade ago as a younger person with faith and a pretty easy life I could never really connect personally to songs like Terrible Lie, but I still loved the music aspect of them.    So you believe the Presence to be angelic or some kind of Heavenly force? I can never make my mind up, I bounce between it being God( or angels), Aliens or some other kind of outside supernatural beings watching in judgement, the Earth/'mother nature' trying to course correct its most advanced lifeforms, or just a massive case of hallucinations (that ones not as fun though!) The ""watching you with all our eyes"" along with ""We heard her cry, weve come to intervene"" are two of the coolest lines off the album in my opinion."
nin,31bj83,joymode,-3,Fri Apr 3 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't get all that. How the fuck are those ""instruments""?? A thousand plus buttons, knobs, switches. levers, ect - it just seems ridiculously excessive. Theres no way users of it completely understand how every knob affects the sound and how to blend the thousand knobs just right to create their perfect sound. Its just madness. Though I must give my respect to anyone with the balls to undertake such an absurdly convoluted yet precise instrument. It would just be infinitely easier to put your finger on fret 4, string 3 and hit the string to play a melody.   Next time I listen to NIN (which is practically all the time), I'm going to pay extra close attention to synths, especially backgrond synths. No doubt Trent is also a certified master of the synth. Might not have as much equipment as Cortini but he definitely knows how to work it. Hell, he may very well have even more equip than Cortini, I know he likes to collect them.   Anyway - the only thing more impressive about the set up is that he knows what the hell to do with it"
nin,31bj83,balfazahr,3,Fri Apr 3 22:21:54 2015 UTC,"If you want to hear all those synths in action, I recommend to chceck out his solo stuff, like http://www.sonoio.org/ for more accesible style of music, or https://soundcloud.com/alessandrocortini for his more experimental pieces."

nin,31bj83,balfazahr,2,Sun Apr 5 09:39:18 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but have you ever actually listened to NIN? :) The ratio of synthesis vs. guitars is usually heavily in favor of the synths. It's kind of hard not to notice that.  I'm not trying to be a dick but writing something like this in a NIN subreddit is like coming to a skiing subreddit and saying how cars are infinitely easier to control.
nin,31bj83,TheKiw,2,Sun Apr 5 10:49:09 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly when reading his comment ha. I have always loved Trent's sounds with synth/keys/piano stuff a bit more than his guitar work.  Without the use of those ""buttons, knobs, switches. levers, ect"" it just wouldn't be NIN!"

I had never made the connection to TGD and dubstep before, but the early stuff was basically 2-step with more vocal samples and heavier bass. TGD is one of the first songs I heard with the very glitchy/heavy/crazy noise drop or whatever, which has since became popular in dubstep, but definitely wasn't around in the 90s"
nin,31b634,apocalyptan,0,Fri Apr 3 15:34:15 2015 UTC,"I think the point he was making was that TGD was responsible for making it popular, and similar sounds were previously ""underground"" and not ""mainstream"" or whatever. But I still think it's bs either way."

I have been recently tapping into a degree of ambition and hope in life that had been allowed to atrophy for various (mostly selfish and stupid) reasons. I've been engaging myself more in working out, eating better (and less), putting effort into various dreams and projects; all in all, trying in life.   'Gave Up' was an anthem for me for awhile, but in recent times I have seen more clearly how fundamentally flawed that perspective was, and I have declared war against it (but I'm keeping my flair here).  Anyway, I am very curious about what kind of music you are working on. Recently I asked this sub what the musicians of r/nin were working on, and got some great feedback. I write music, but am still very amateur in my execution. Inspiration comes and goes, but the process is a lot of fun in the long run. But I'm very curious to hear if you have a soundcloud or something you might share.    Also, I'm sorry for your recent losses. Life can be a real motherfucker sometimes (I know what you're going through). Keep at the inspired direction you are heading in, and thanks for all the work you have done here."
nin,312ma5,Reznorfan,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:40:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I feel like I've come out on top of everything for the first time in awhile and it feels great. I'm glad to hear you're doing better too!   Music wise I've done a good bit of stuff over the years but it never goes far so I don't have an recordings sorry :(. But I play bass (upright and bass guitar), sing, and play a bit of guitar, harmonicas, and piano. Jazz is my favorite genre and I play it the most but I don't really have any specific jazz projects I take part in. My first real project was when I formed a punk rock duo with my friend in high school. That expanded into a blues punk band and eventually into an alt rock band. But that stopped so I started playing folk rock with some guys. That dissolved so I started playing with the guys from the alt rock band again which is what in doing now. We're in the very early process of writing psychedelic/groove rock with some electronic rock elements. We have a drummer, me on bass, a guitar player, and a front man who plays guitar, sings, and does some keyboards/synths. We're still looking for a dedicated synth player and acquiring gear to get ""that""  sound though but it seems prosperous.   Other than that I'm saving for a synth and some new pedals to go with it so I can play it in the band and finally make my debut into electronic music because it's a very dear genre to me. I also play in local musicals.   Once again, thank you for your condolences :)"
nin,312ma5,signofthenine,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"Too bad you don't have anything online, but I appreciate the background of your musical journey. Here in this anonymous forum, it can be difficult to see usernames as fleshed out people sometimes. The internet is a cold place.  My own musical journey includes high school musical theater, and one meager attempt at singing in a rock band over ten years ago. There was a time when I had dreams of producing music on a commercial level, but to be honest when I had the youth, I lacked the understanding and clarity of vision to say anything truly relevant or meaningful.   Now that I have a message to share, music has faded in the background as far as vehicles of expression go. I still write music (more so than when I was in a band), but no longer have ambitions of ""making it"".   I've got a soundcloud of sometimes painful sounding demos, if you want to check it out my username is ""seed of the earth"". Most of it is keyboard-based instrumentals, but I also sing and play guitar, as in ""Song of the Phoenix"" which was written and recorded for a documentary based on a friend, who is a bi-polar artist, called ""A Moment of Clarity"".  Music is a soothing force for both listener and creator. I hope your musical interests help to preserve and propel you towards whatever challenges and chances are coming up ahead in your life.   Is there a chance of online posting of music some time soon?  If you ever want to talk about writing synth-based music, let me know. And if you happen to be in North Carolina hit me up, maybe I could join your band!"

nin,30ok4d,signofthenine,8,Sun Mar 29 07:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the songs on Hesitation Marks have an overall pop sensibility to them - my fiance, for instance, never really liked NIN before she heard that album and she mostly listens to poppy/dancy sort of artists.  For the longest time, With Teeth was my favorite NIN album (the Fragile is now), which always got some raised eyebrows. I think it may have something to do with the blended tone of the album - it was pitch perfect for me at that point in my life."

Lyrically ""Everything"" fits right in with NIN's songs even moreso than others."
nin,30ok4d,bajster,8,Sun Mar 29 07:51:06 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love ""All the Love"" and I was front row for the first time it was played live in San Antonio back in 2013 (you can probably hear me going crazy on a youtube video of it even though I had the start of the flu that night haha)  I'm not sure why I didn't like it at first or why it hasn't really grown on me with time. I grew up in the 80's/90's with a love of pop music (my favorite band as a kid was Huey Lewis & the News) so it struck me as odd that the song was so off-putting for me from the start. I think I need to keep listening to it, and focus on the lyrics. I really don't understand the argument that it goes against the NIN sound however because Trent has always had the music evolving and it definitely has that distinct flavor to it."
nin,30ok4d,kyleclements,11,Sun Mar 29 08:00:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in this thread are comparing Everything to a ton of other NIN songs... The big difference between the songs everyone has listed and Everything is the fact that Everything is in a very obvious major key as opposed to a minor one. As poppy as Satellite and Down In It and whatever else may be, they all have an eerie NIN vibe to them. Discipline rocked a piano that would've fit well somewhere on With Teeth and had a moody breakdown midway that helped create some tension. All The Love doesn't really break into pop mode until the last minute or so, and is probably the closest thing to Everything in terms of tone and mood, but even that's a stretch imo.   Then again, the term ""pop"" is very broad. It's easy to argue that a song like Closer is pop because of its dancey beat and catchy lyrics...   As far as the song goes, I'm still not a big fan. It's down there with a-Withuhh Teethuhh and Disappointed for me as one of my least favorites, but I still appreciate it as a piece of Trent's discography."
nin,30ok4d,kyleclements,2,Sun Mar 29 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"With Teeth and Disappointed are probably two of my least favorite NIN songs as well.  The term ""pop"" is a very broad term. If it really just means popular music, we would have to slide Head Like A Hole, Hurt, and Closer into that genre. But I think you are right about the major key because it seems like it's like the argument is ""well it has this particular vibe"" to it which can be a bit jarring in the context of your typical NIN album but I can't imagine where else in the catalogue could possibly fit?"
nin,30ok4d,Cancerslug,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:07:39 2015 UTC,"Can you really be disappointed with a song that includes the lyrics, ""so disappointed with what you get""?  They way I see it, Trent, in his infinite wisdom, saw your rejection of that particular song, and included that lyric just for you...  Seriously though, I always did interpret that song as Trent's way of saying, ""I'm a very different person now, writing some very different music, and if you want an angsty screamy teenager kinda music, you are going to be disappointed with what I have to offer from now on."""
nin,30ok4d,Mopviv,3,Mon Mar 30 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not judging the song or his tonal shift and I'm not really disappointed either - the music of the song just doesn't really grab me in the way that music that I like does? It's like, I don't really care for the taste of brussel sprouts and I can't really put into words or understand why that is, but that just happens to be my truth.  I am actually more excited to see where he goes with the music now that he is in a different place. I don't need a revisitation to the dark places he once was at - as an adult in my 30's, I don't visit those places even remotely as often as I did 5 or 10 years ago, so I would not be able to relate to that music. But I think a lot of what he still writes about applies to maturity - there is still alienation and trying to adjust to your place in the world, how relationships and ghosts affect things going forward, ect.  And all that great stuff from the past is still there to go back and listen to whenever the need arises."
nin,30ok4d,inversephase,4,Mon Mar 30 05:25:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply ""you specifically"" in that comment, more of me interpreting that song as being for NIN fans in general.  Due to how repetitive the music and the lyrics sound, ""Disappointed"" and ""Find my Way"" seem more like instrumentals to me; quiet background songs.  I don't see them as sticking out or not belonging on the album.  Everything Sticks out.  I love how Trent's music has been evolving.  I feel like I discovered NIN at the perfect time in my life, and Trent's music has matured just as I have, perfectly in step, and whatever he puts out seems to be speaking to exactly where I'm at in my own life.  Even ""Ghosts"" came out when I was living abroad and going for daily walks through eerie, foggy mountains and forests, and that music set the tone for those landscapes just perfectly."

I feel like I discovered NIN at the perfect time in my life, and Trent's music has matured just as I have, perfectly in step, and whatever he puts out seems to be speaking to exactly where I'm at in my own life.""  I feel the same way. Since I discovered NIN when I got Quake the day it came out, I've been a fan. I was around 11 at the time. Got my first and only tattoo, the downward spiral cd art with NIN in it at 21. It's the only real constant in my life. I don't listen to NIN as much anymore, but it's still my fav and my go to."
nin,30ok4d,HumanistGeek,2,Wed Apr 1 07:08:29 2015 UTC,"I love how is his music can impact people in such powerful and different ways: for me, I like listening to ""Ghosts"" while I watch anime. I'm hearing impaired so I need to use headphones a lot when I don't have the sound system blasting (i.e. the lady of the house is sleeping) and I discovered that the album goes well during Attack on Titan."
nin,30ok4d,kyleclements,6,Fri Apr 3 02:50:40 2015 UTC,"When it came out and people were down on it I didn't get the hate; I was like ""NIN always do new things, this sounds great and experimenting and pushing into the new is what makes Trent Trent!"" so I loved 'Everything'. But I've got to be honest now if I put on my sexy vinyl edition of HM, it just doesn't seem to fit. I don't think it's bad, it's catchy and well-built as a pop song, but it's like a block of chocolate on the plate with your roast dinner; nice as it is, it just doesn't feel like it should be sat on the same album as 'All Time Low' or 'Various Methods of Escape', you know?"
nin,30ok4d,TheKiw,7,Sun Mar 29 12:32:18 2015 UTC,"Generally, I feel the same as when the track dropped. But I'll say what I said when it came out...  First of all, someone somewhere mentioned HM being ""The Upward Spiral"". Given that, it's pretty much mostly the explanation you need. Also, /u/HumanistGeek points out it tells a story and /u/Gamer_152 mentions it is powerful. I agree with both of these things being important.  If you can put yourself in Trent's shoes (or anyone that's been through some shit) and go through the catalog, then suddenly you end up at Everything, it's super powerful. It's a cry of victory and success. I know this is more about ""how do you feel about the song"", but I respectfully posit that the entire point is that the song is specifically designed to make the listener sit up and take notice. Honestly, I think that's the point of lots of NIN songs, so it's similar in that regard.  The changeup is definitely also jolting, which honestly I sort of expected. It paints a picture of back-and-forth going on in your head. Makes sense to me.  Is it my favorite track? No. That said, I'm not here to play favorites, and I do think it absolutely deserves your time and attention if you want to understand Trent's feelings while working on the album. I would say it is a necessary piece in that regard."
nin,30ok4d,Sirusavath,1 point,Wed Apr 1 07:59:54 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely appreciate the direction and tone that he was achieving with the track. I happen to love a lot of ""pop"" music, especially stuff from the 80's/90's/early 00's and after a few more listens, it feels like a pop song but almost in a bizarro world? I don't think that I will ever like it as a song itself, even if it does seem to be nestling like a worm in my ear of late, but I can certainly appreciate the song itself."

nin,30ok4d,elementroejoy,8,Fri Apr 3 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"I interpret Hesitation Marks as a story of recovery and healing. ""Everything"" is the album's essence.   ""[The] Downward Spiral was about peeling off layers and arriving at a naked, ugly end. [The Fragile] starts at the end, then attempts to create order from chaos, but never reaches the goal.""   Secondary source   ""For some reason, when I started working more on Hesitation Marks, I started thinking back romantically about who I was when I was writing The Downward Spiral. I was looking back on who I was then and who I am now and how things have turned out, for better or worse. That was the air the new record was born in.""      ""I felt very aware that it's 20 years later, and I'm still that guy. I know that guy, and I feel for him. I don't resent him, I don't miss him. But how would things feel on the other side of that now, in a much more stable life place, mentally and physically, and with a new family? The incentive has changed. It's not about, 'I'm going to kill myself if I don't get this out of my head.' But the excavation and the architecture behind it, the motivation behind it, is similar.""   Find My Way:     I have made a great mistake I'm just trying to find my way   All Time Low:     See this is where the fun begins You've barely even pierced the skin Just wait till you see what is coming      Been down this road before We're coming back for more   Afterwards, he asks   What did you expect? So disappointed [....]   In ""Everything,"" he refers to withdrawal symptoms: ""your hands begin to shake, shake, shake."" But, things are looking up. He's happy.     I survived"
nin,30ok4d,idioma,10,Sun Mar 29 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"In this song, I think most hear sincerity where Trent intended sarcasm."

I do like that it sits right in the center of album, like it is a peak, in its own way."
nin,30ok4d,Cancerslug,1 point,Sun Mar 29 08:02:33 2015 UTC,"Trent himself said that the song is supposed to represent overconfidence etc. - that's imho why his voice cracks a little bit in the verses.

nin,30ok4d,Hands,6,Sun Apr 5 11:06:06 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed it pretty much since the shock of the tune wore off. The first few listens where most certainly ""What the hell am I listening to?"" moments. But by the time the album actually came out the song had grown on me and I enjoy it. It isn't your normal Nine Inch Nails, but that doesn't mean it is bad."

nin,30ok4d,Gamer_152,4,Mon Mar 30 01:01:09 2015 UTC,I liked it when it first came out because it was kind of catchy and made my move a little and I still like it. Of course my guilty pleasure is watching this video which has it in it.
nin,30ok4d,andersonenvy,3,Sun Mar 29 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"After the initial ""shock"" of hearing such a different NIN sound, I grew to like it. However, it does NOT fit well on Hesitation Marks at all. It throws the whole album all off. Satellite for that matter too. Both, which were intended as Greatest Hits compilation songs, should have stayed that way."
nin,30ok4d,CDC_,3,Sun Mar 29 15:25:51 2015 UTC,"I still find the song to be lazy in terms of production, and far less compelling than virtually everything else in the NIN catalog. That said, ""Everything"" is hardly the only ""NIN-pop"" song. Going all the way back to ""Down in it"", Trent has always flirted with pop sounds throughout his career.  NIN-Pop list:  Purist Feeling   Kinda I Want To Purest Feeling Ringfinger   Pretty Hate Machine   Down in it   The Perfect Drug (single)  With Teeth   All The Love in the World   Year Zero   Capital G God Given   The Slip   Discipline   Hesitation Marks   Everything   I'd even go as far as to argue that major release albums usually have at least one ""pop"" song, and the exceptions are The Downward Spiral and The Fragile."

nin,30ok4d,worthlessfucksunited,3,Sun Mar 29 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"I love it. To me it's about a man trying to deny the ugly truth of it all. Trying to hide in his own world. Like a lot of people. It's a sad sarcastic song.  ""I am whole. I believe I am whole. I am free. I am whole. I can see. Always here. Finally. I am whole. I believe I am whole. I am free."" Sounds like a meditative chant. Trying to calm down. Trying to ignore the reality that everything is shit.   But that's just me."
nin,30ok4d,Ivashkin,3,Wed Apr 1 07:02:00 2015 UTC,"That would certainly fit with the atmosphere of the record - I just learned recently that Hesitation Marks are the scars from failed suicide attempts? And that speaks massive volumes about why I love the album as a whole because it does feel like the album of someone who has dealt with some of the darkest places our minds will allow us to inhabit, but also has someone with the maturity to recognize that your life will always remain stuck in the syrupy madness of depression unless you at least try to look past it.  I echoes a bit of the sentimentality of one of my favorite lyrics from the Good Soldier - ""I am trying to believe."""
nin,30ok4d,Airbornefeline_,2,Fri Apr 3 03:26:53 2015 UTC,"I like it, major chords and elements of pop are nothing new as others have pointed out, particularly when it comes to ""modern"" NIN.  It's not one of my favorite songs on the album but it's good on its own merits.  If I were going to pick a least favorite NIN song it wouldn't even be in the running.  I have to say now that some time has passed I think Hesitation Marks is one hell of an album.  I wasn't as into The Slip or Year Zero as I was earlier stuff (and even With Teeth I felt paled in comparison to 90s NIN) but HM might well be one of my favorite albums if you weight it a bit to make up for the overwhelming sentimental attachment I have to some of the older albums."
nin,30ok4d,grodecki,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"I like bits and pieces of Year Zero and the Slip but they are not like all of the other albums which I can put on and enjoy from start to finish. The standout tracks are the Good Soldier and 1,000,000 (which is one of my favorite songs), with a couple of other good tunes, but a lot of stuff that just doesn't move me all that much.  I still really enjoy With Teeth (other than the title track, which echoes my personal dislike for Everything) and I think it is a good bridge album from the darker tones of the earlier work to the melodic ""pop""ish soundscapes of Hesitation Marks."
nin,30ok4d,PersistenceOfLoss,2,Mon Mar 30 00:51:13 2015 UTC,"I like it. It's the one truly Belew piece on that album. Seriously reminds me of The Bears, a pop band Belew was in during the late 90s and early 2000s.  See: Adrian Belew - Everything"
nin,30ok4d,Reinmann,2,Sun Mar 29 17:21:03 2015 UTC,"I understand where a lot of peoples' dislike for the track comes from. I actually like it quite a lot, but I do have one big criticism. One of NIN's biggest strengths is putting together albums where the tracks compliment each other really well. The Downward Spiral and even the rest of this album, Hesitation Marks, take you on a wonderful journey from track to track. Arguably Everything is nested in the most appropriate part of the album possible, but even then it still feels like it doesn't really suit the surrounding music and that Trent just had to find some point at which to plonk it in regardless.  However, like a fair number of other people I love the experimental nature of it. I mean considering the music that Trent usually makes, what could be more subversive than actually taking an empowering, happy look at his life experiences? Like a lot of other NIN tracks I think it's also coloured by that larger context built up by other tracks and by Trent's life experience. Knowing the depths he has gone too and the crushing depression, isolation, and pain you can hear in his songs, hearing this upbeat, powerful declaration that he has managed to come out of it free, and clear-sighted, and alive is so uplifting, and it's just a great pop rock piece."
nin,30ok4d,NotoriousBIC,2,Tue Mar 31 07:51:16 2015 UTC,My first reaction was negative but it grew on me over time ...  I especially like the song's satirical ending - starting at 2:40 - as the familiar haunting ambient background sounds come in behind the major-key 'poppy' riff.   Cheerful and creepy at the same time.

nin,30e4pk,iaro,2,Fri Mar 27 00:14:44 2015 UTC,"I think Death Grips are absolutely brilliant. They are doing something with punk / electronic hip hop that has never been done before... There's a HUGE industrial feel on their new album. In fact, a lot of the noisy / chaotic production reminds me of what a modern day ""Broken"" would be like. Chaos, confusion, fear maybe... Deep rooted lyrics that get as serious as suicide, contrasted by goofy, tongue and cheek lyrics keep your mind dancing.  It's hard to get at first- I know - but a lot of people could say the same thing about Dillinger who ultimately replaced DG on the 2013 tour. Some of the best music is the stuff that you have to listen to more than once to make ""click""... In fact, that's one of the reasons I started to like NIN in the first place.  I don't get the automatic hate-on for a band just because they pissed Trent off. A lot of people piss Trent off."

Around the time the Beats deal was announced, I was sitting with a coworker at the outdoor RW11 cafeteria eating lunch, and Trent Reznor walked right past us with one of the senior iTunes people, apparently getting a tour of the building. I don't think anybody recognized him. Before it even dawned on me what had happened, he was gone.  I realize I have no way to prove this to you, but it absolutely happened. Ever since that day I've wondered what his role would be at Apple and, honestly, that makes a lot of sense given Apple's apparent motivation to buy Beats."

We then looked for Trent Reznor and he wasn't, so that got us whispering amongst ourselves, which is why it was a bit of a surprise to see him. Maybe he was a later addition or something.

Now though, it's my favorite album of all time."

nin,30ajdv,t0xicd0g,9,Wed Mar 25 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"Downward Spiral is a story. It's the story of a character so consumed with rage after a heartbreak that he systematically begins destroying his own psyche in order to never be hurt again. For that reason, much of the album uses abrasive sounds, noisy texturing and many other devices to elicit an uncomfortable, broken feeling. The more melodic tracks and quieter passages thus stand out starkly against this backdrop and represent moments of self reflection in the character's life.   Once you penetrate the layers of noise, the tracks have a wonderful set of melodies; March of the Pigs has layers of distorted guitars playing contrasting riffs, Ruiner has so much going on under the distortion, and in Mr Self Destruct the distortion itself is part of the track's dynamic, dropping away hard in that middle section to expose a fragile bassline and whispered loops.   Not everyone likes hard industrial music, and that's fine. TDS is Trent's hardest album, even more so than Broken imo. It is a classic, but then so is a lot of the Stones' stuff and I really don't like the Stones."
nin,30ajdv,Eponymous1990,4,Thu Mar 26 09:00:46 2015 UTC,"You really have to be in the mood for it, Trent was going through some hard times during that era and you'd mirror his feelings if you were going through similar pain. If you're just an upbeat yuppie looking to hear some music then of course you wouldn't understand it."
nin,30ajdv,Hugh_Jampton,2,Thu Mar 26 06:45:55 2015 UTC,"It works better as a whole piece and is super layered.  Listen to the instrumental version, see if that helps. Streaming on youtube  Also, it starts real heavy but takes different directions after"
nin,30ajdv,inversephase,2,Wed Mar 25 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"If you're an audio nerd (and really even if you're not, but especially if you are), one thing that might help you appreciate it is how the mixing and mastering kinda breaks down over the course of the album. I don't see this mentioned in many places but it makes perfect sense that the story is about someone slowly going insane, and the character breaks down track by track. This doesn't just happen in lyrical form but in a lot of other ways as well, and I'm pretty sure most of it is intentional. Eventually you end up at Hurt, where ""everything just falls apart"".   Anyway, maybe another perspective to approach from.  Also, side question, have you enjoyed Further Down The Spiral, or are you having trouble with that one too? That could be another gateway drug for you."

Try some live recordings maybe, lot of early NIN songs sounds better live in my opinion.   Also listening on some nice pair of headphones really helps to appreciate the production"
nin,30ajdv,Tylertheguitarist,2,Wed Mar 25 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"The Fragile is even more difficult to ""get"" because there isn't a very structured story, that is more of an emotional sense. TDS is a narrative."

TDS was just so.. it spoke to teen me, hell it still does in my 30's. All the negativity and sadness and darkness and anger and hatred for everyone and everything including myself was pretty much echoed there via great song writing and an industrial sound that couldn't be found anywhere else.  It was a soundtrack for my self destructive nature that seemed to understand me and how I felt better than I understood myself. I guess for me it was because The Downward Spiral ""got"" me."

In hindsight, the opening ten minute blend of the Self Destruct remixes may have been a bit much. I did that to hear a version of part 1 without that horrible screeching horn-of-satan sounding synth, that led to a blend of all three parts (although I think there may be a 4th part only available on FDTS version 2). Once that project was complete, the next idea was to follow Mr. Self Destruct with the Piggy remix then Heresy and so forth.  Anyway, it wasn't that well received. You live and learn.

Not that it's a bad song, it's just a ""typical"" nin ""screaming"" song.  And, if I'm recommending The Fragile to someone (which I certainly would!), it's because it covers the bases of pop/rock/rap/ambient/industrial/instrumental, all in one album. There's SO much more to it than the typical nin sound, and I'd hate for someone to get turned off/give up on it just on the opening track (""it's just a guy screaming with guitars, what's the big deal? Everyone does that."").     Same thing with March of the Pigs being the first single from TDS.  It's not a bad sound at all, but it's similar to the previous album (Broken).  And I love it when TR goes in a new, unexpected direction (Ghosts being a great example) instead of what people expect. It broadens the fans horizons. And that's awesome."
nin,303bq3,TyrannosaurusHives,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:08:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with what youre saying about Somewhat Damaged. I used to love it, used to scribble the lyrics all over my folders in high school back when I was an angsty, angery teenager. But Ive mellowed out a lot since then and it just doesnt resonate with me anymore.   No disrespect to the song or its fans, I know its a fairly popular one, but the instrumentals are just about as bland as can be to me. The drum lines are steady, but slow and without much gusto. The guitar riff is probably my least favorite NIN riff ever. In a plain jane 4/4 signature, the riff goes 1/2/3/4, 1/2/3/4, 1/2/3/4. I mean - just so lacking in power or fervor, making it totally incongruent with the vocals, which are, imo, excellent for what theyre meant to be. The desperation, anger, and anxiety are positively palpable in Trents voice. Now, mind you, it is not at all my favorite style of Trents vocals, but I will attest that, for what he was driving at, he nailed it. I dont have many qualms with the lyrics either, just very very quintessential NIN.   But ya, like you were saying about new NIN listeners getting turned off by that song, I really wish they wouldve chosen more unique song for that spot in The Walking Dead. I can name 20 songs that wouldve jives better with what the director seemed to have been trying to convey, ones that would put NIN in a more intrguing light too. But oh wel. Is what it is"

Honestly, I don't really feel a TDS vibe on Jenny Death, and no one on /r /deathgrips has mentioned this. However, many DG fans say that certain songs sound influenced by NIN, albeit slightly. Culture Shock is often brought up as the most NIN-ish song, the electronic beat sounds like a number of songs from Year Zero. Meet Your Master and Vessel come to mind. Jenny Death uses a wide array of guitars on a level previously unseen on any DG album. The guitars are mostly more psychedelic in nature than industrial, and seem to have more Jimi Hendrix esque sound than NIN."

It sounded pretty interesting and unlike much that I had ever heard. I can sort of see how you could compare the sound of The Downward Spiral to the work of Death Grips. I think the connection comes from the grittiness. It sounds raw. There's also the use of sampling in some songs so that's a similarity.  To be honest I was a little surprised by how unappealing Death Grips seemed to be to most fans here. Again, I'm not a ""fan"" (in that I don't own all of their work and I probably couldn't listen to them all the time), but I was actually impressed by them simply because it was unique.   Edit: I haven't actually listened to the track you linked, but I am taking examples from my listening of Ex-Military by DG."

Then live albums (halos 12,17, and 22 - note that halo 12 is available for free straight from TR via torrent [seed0] - as well as the semi-official Another Version of the Truth from thisoneisonus).  Then, if you are so inclined, remix albums and singles.  For a beginning collector, ninwiki is the resource I recommend for research. For a more advanced collector, the nincatalog. Join echoingthesound and peruse the marketplace forums for invaluable info from other collectors.   Don't waste your money on bootlegs. Every live NIN performance that has ever been bootlegged (and countless more that have not) is available for free at reflectinginthechrome,  Collecting NIN vinyl can become very expensive very fast.

The chord progression behind the ""And I descend from grace"" segment is the chorus of AATCHB, and the line itself is derived from the line in TGB ""for all we could have done, and all that could have been"".   That's part of why TGB and AATCHB are two of my favorite, if not my two favorite, NIN songs. They're just so depressingly beautiful."

I asked the barista what it was and he told me it was Radiohead and then the name of the song.  I hadn't listened to Radiohead before and for the life of me I could not remember the title he told me.  So I went and bought their entire catalogue and listened to the whole thing.  Never found the song and the barista could not remember what it was when I asked him next.  I wish you luck OP, I've never forgotten that song, just everything about it."

I never really noticed the ageing in his voice, but this makes it really apparent (that and basically playing the CD version of the song).  Now I need to go listen to early NIN.  Thanks! ;)"

They put one USB port on their new MacBook just so they can charge you 80$ for USB adapter and I'm not even mentioning that the new MacBook have less performance than the old one and yet it costs more.   I don't know, this just seems really shady to me"
nin,2yglk9,teleekom,3,Mon Mar 9 19:50:56 2015 UTC,they didn't put one USB port on their new MacBook just so they can charge you 80$ for USB adapter. They put it on there becaus ethye care more about their industrial design egos than the consumers experience.
nin,2yglk9,otterquestions,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:33:13 2015 UTC,"the new MacBook have less performance than the old one and yet it costs more   It's not replacing any current models, it's a revival of an old product line. The MacBook Airs still perform better than this new MacBook. The price of the unit comes from the engineering required to make it as thin and as light as it is. The MacBook Air was around AU$4000 when it was first released, now they're just bouncing off the $1k mark."

I did not see a whole new product line coming, and don't know how I feel about the new model yet. Say what you will, Apple sticks closely their goal of ""thinner, sexier, wireless"" over what other PC manufacturers do with constant upgrades to performance but not a lot of innovation or risk-taking. Looking at Apple's incredible profit on laptops compared to the performance of their competitors, they can afford to do things like remove all the standard plugs people have been using for a decade."

I would expect something like this from shady retailer on some corner street, not from multi billionaire company"
nin,2yglk9,teleekom,0,Mon Mar 9 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this is at all ""shady"" or ""questionable"" at all, they aren't hiding anything at all from anyone. In fact they are trumpeting the lack of ports. Many people willingly buying Apple devices because of the style and experience. Most people don't give a damn about which CPU their laptop has and have no interest in learning about specifications either. Also, I expect a whole ecosystem of competing next-gen USB devices will explode because they are forcing the industry in that direction. Remember when they took all the optical drives out of Macs? People had the same reaction at first, but in the end people got used to streaming media and wireless file transfer/backup and so the technology advanced."
nin,2yglk9,anon1984,7,Mon Mar 9 20:16:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that you could say that MacBook's ditching optical drives is the reason why streaming or cloud got so popular but even if it was, this isn't the same thing. You always need ways for connecting your peripherals to your computer - mouse, printers, external drives, your phone, etc. Plus Apple isn't pushing any new technology here, you still have to rely on USB ports, you just have only one from the start and if you want more, you need to pay up 80 bucks. That's like selling a car with one headlight and acting like it's normal to charge you extra for the other"
nin,2yglk9,teleekom,-2,Mon Mar 9 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"Apple tends to look where technology is going in a few years and take early risks, which is why they are now industry leaders. You don't need wires for any of the computer peripherals you mentioned, just for providing power. This is a new standard so there will be a lot of devices and accessories from hundreds of companies. I don't know where you got the $80 number from, but there will be expensive Apple accessories and cheap 3rd party ones just like with Lightning and Thunderbolt connectors."

nin,2yeyw8,glistening_icicles,42,Mon Mar 9 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"Your son appears to be using NIN to relate to a world that he finds somewhat overwhelming. If he is exhibiting isolative tendencies, and he has found a way to deal with them AND derive enjoyment at the same time, then the music is a constructive tool for his development. If he were to have a void in the place of the music, where would he focus those negative attentions? Probably himself. Let him listen, encourage him to listen. When you're depressed it is better to focus on things external to yourself-- things get nasty when there is no outlet and you withdraw into internality.   Coincidentally, a lot of this (both what you're saying AND what I am saying) is pertinent to the theme of The Downward Spiral. You should give it a listen-through, in order, and try to sort out the themes and narrative in the album. He's hooked on it for a good reason: it is the seminal concept-album of the 90s.    Every song (even Big Man With a Gun) has its place in the story that is told. In my mind, the album ends with a redemption (after the suicide)-- Hurt is a lamentation over the protagonist's lost life: ""if I could start again / a million miles away / I would keep myself / I would find a way"". The Downward Spiral tells the story of suicide before ultimately warning the listener to never go down that path. It goes to the darkest part of the psyche (and things do get VERY dark) in order to reaffirm the importance and beauty in life.   EDIT: The Downward Spiral has helped me get through the worst things I've ever experienced. I see it as one of the most important benevolent influences on my life."
nin,2yeyw8,PersistenceOfLoss,14,Mon Mar 9 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"Now, instead of writing a long post, I can just say: Yup. Same for me, started with NIN at around the same age for the same reasons and still love it today. NIN has helped me great deal to cope with everything and it sound nice, too."
nin,2yeyw8,audaxxx,25,Mon Mar 9 06:32:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats on being an awesome parent :)  When I was a teenager (now 25) some of the very things that worry you about some of the lyrics in The Downward Spiral were what drew me to NIN in the first place.  It provided a sort of emotional resonance for all of the complicated emotions and angst I was feeling as a teenager.  The darker sides of NIN - the anger, metaphorical violence, pain and so forth - gave some kind of refuge from my own confusion or difficulties.  Just as the often more reflective or hopeful sides found in The Fragile did.  The emotional turmoil and depth of the music and its texture gave me something that I could identify with in what turned out to be an entirely positive and constructive way.  I can also say that as a 14 or 15 year old the inherent offensiveness of some of TDS's more controversial lyrics (Heresy, Closer, Big Man With A Gun and so forth) also appealed to me in the sense that I appreciated that it was primarily a culturally subversive rather than emotionally violent expression.  Also, pretty much every NIN fan loves Hurt to death, it's the encore at EVERY NIN show, lighters in the air and stuff.  If he didn't like Hurt he would be an atypical fan.  There is a reason that Nine Inch Nails became superfamous with the release of The Downward Spiral - Trent's music and lyrics resonate with a lot of people with depression or who simply feel out of place or at odds with aspects of the world.  I have never seen this as anything but a positive thing - a sort of emotional outlet, and even just the comfort of knowing someone else can relate - in anybody I know personally who grew up listening to NIN, including friends with depression, Aspergers, etc.  I would say don't worry too much.  In 2015 there is a LOT of dark, disturbing, angry and generally provocative material and media available to anyone with an internet connection and the will to find it that makes NIN look like Sesame Street.  If your son were to begin obsessing over some of the darker concepts present in Nine Inch Nails there would be plenty of other signs - and far, far worse music - to go with it.  Let him have his Trent :)"

nin,2yeyw8,PersistenceOfLoss,13,Mon Mar 9 06:52:04 2015 UTC,"You seem like a very thoughtful parent.  Let me see if I can write some thoughts on this without rambling.  (For some background, I'm 28 and have been listening to NIN since 1998 when I was 11 (in 6th grade).)  As a child, I never much cared for music.  I also constantly felt that my thoughts were abnormal and was paranoid that I would say something other people wouldn't understand and would inadvertently ostracize myself.    I first heard Closer on the radio in my brother's car one night, and something clicked.  At that point, it was just beautiful noise, the kind I hadn't heard before.  This kind of music just wasn't in the mainstream in the 90s (and largely still isn't).  As a child who hadn't even hit puberty yet, I didn't really relate to Closer.  Obviously I understood the lyrics and tone of the song, but power and lust were basically alien to me, a subdued, suburban kid.    Anyway, after hearing that, I asked for The Downward Spiral for Christmas and listened to it front to back, and suddenly I felt like I wasn't alone in the world anymore.  This was the first time I had heard genuine mania and depression distilled into music.  I can't speak to your son's experience, as I'm not autistic or diagnosed with any type of depression (I wouldn't be surprised if I am, but let's not go into that).  For me, I was lucky that my parents just accepted that I had weird taste in music and didn't attempt to look into it too much more than that.  I went from being a melancholy kid to being a melancholy kid who could better contextualize the world around him, and that was probably enough for them.  These days, I don't listen to NIN that much more, and I listen to a lot of other (mostly electronic) music.  I still relate to Trent's music, and I doubt that will ever change.  Part of me is just dark and always will be.  I suspect that your son may be the same.  A lot of Trent's music since those days (1994 when The Downward Spiral came out, and 1999 when The Fragile came out) has been less outwardly manic and violent, and more reflective on society and generally tonally dark.  All of the songs you mentioned were from The Downward Spiral.  Have you listened to Hesitation Marks (2013)? It's widely seen as the unofficial ""sequel"" to The Downward Spiral, kind of a mirror image/reflection of where Trent is at right now.  It's much more subdued, but still melancholy.  There's still a bit of violence there, but everything doesn't seem so hopeless. Also, (as you'll see below) NIN is often even better live than in studio.  Trent is extremely meticulous about his stage performances, and they're a spectacle to behold.  Trent's musical range is wide and vast.  Let me link you to some songs that are more melancholy/reflective/just kickass tonally, instead of violent and angry.  Maybe you can point your son to this stuff, or just bond with him over it if you like it:   All the Love in the World In This Twilight (Live) Lights in the Sky The Good Soldier Leaving Hope While I'm Still Here/Black Noise (Live)   From Trent's side-project How To Destroy Angels, which also contains his wife, Mariqueen Maandig Reznor, on vocals:   Strings and Attractors Ice Age   (Also, while I'm spamming songs, Alesandro Cortini, one of Trent's touring buddies and a great musician in his own right, has some really great music out there too. I suspect that your son might relate to this song a lot:)   Modwheelmood - Scared of Everyone   Obviously I don't know you aside from this blurb you wrote, so this might ring hollow, but you seem like an awesome person and I bet you're doing an awesome job at raising your kid.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.  And sorry for the rambling. :)  Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions or whatever."

nin,2yeyw8,ThaRealDiablo,9,Mon Mar 9 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"Whether he's depressed, anxious, or has some other mental issue, listening to music is a POSITIVE outlet for such afflictions. It provides a feeling of connection and inspires creativity. Listening to music as a means of dealing with the world you live in can ONLY push someone in a positive direction. I'm not saying that listening to the music will keep this person on the fast track to success.. I'm not saying that at all... I'm just saying Nine Inch Nails... Marilyn Manson... Deftones... Dillenger Escape Plan... Notorious B.I.G.... Korn.. Eminem... Death Grips... whatever... listening to (and identifying with) this type of angsty music in and of itself is nothing more than a healthy manifestation of feeling somewhat alienated.   I can pretty much assure you that the music itself is a kind of harmless, yet effective release. If your kid isn't doing drugs, cutting, starting fights, getting in trouble with the law, etc... you're good to go.   Also... TIL high school kids still listen to NIN. Awesome."
nin,2yeyw8,CDC_,8,Mon Mar 9 07:19:25 2015 UTC,"I think that kids use music to explore emotions that they may be experiencing for the first time or perhaps just dealing with. I think music can help them explore those emotions, and to deny them the exploration of these emotions will leave them ill prepared for real life. Music is a great and productive way to explore these emotions and a better way of dealing with things than other methods.  Remember, they're just words, and by letting him listen you are saying that you trust his ability to discern lyrics from an instruction and trust him to be able to explore the world while making his own judgments."

They are just words, an outlet, a way of finding expression when you don't know how. In my opinion its kind of like curse words they are only bad if you give them the power of being bad.   Will your son grow in a sex fueled maniac after listening to closer or want to kill himself after listening to The Downward Spiral? Probably not.  What will happen though is he could grow an appreciation for (IMO) good music, and not he same shit they play on the radio day in and day out.   Ultimately though, He is your son and if you are not comfortable with what he is listening to, then you should sit down and make sure he is okay and talk to him about it. I would encourage you to listen to more of the NIN catalogue though, I would say The Fragile is definitely required listening, followed by (again, my opinion as many others here will feel differently) to Hesitation Marks its not the best album but it shows a lighter side to Trent's work.  Best of luck with everything."

My opinion is that, in the end, what we like depend on who we are, how we feel, etc ... It might not be far to being random at some point I guess even though everyone can find reasons for what they like, myself included :).   From my personal point of view, I hate joyful music (most of the time), I don't feel anything listening to most of nowadays pop music. I seek emotions, sensations, stories, feeling, dreams, something to fill my imagination, when I listen to music.  I won't describe how I got into this kind of music but I can say that I'm 30 and feel like a very normal person :)  Also, you mentioned that your son plays music too, that is, I think, a good way of getting things out of his mind, and also a way to feel creative, being able to create the sounds that you like, not being useless in a sense.  That said, if you feel your son needs help, you can try to talk to him, you seem open-minded enough for that. But maybe he will prefer to deal with it his own way, just make sure he knows you're there if he needs it"
nin,2yeyw8,Flonou,5,Mon Mar 9 10:45:39 2015 UTC,"Personally trents music is very cathartic, when I was a teen (23 now) it allowed me to experience an emotion externally, from a different perspective.  I was dealing with my personal faith, so I connected with the themes in heresy.  I felt a lot of self loathing, so I connected to songs like mr. self destruct.  And while I didn't connect with the emotions in big man with a gun,  it allowed me to experience the mindset and its outward aggression.   While I'm not the biggest fan of closer (I think its due to its high radio airplay) I can understand how one would be able to connect to it.  And of course hurt is the quintessential downward spiral era song. So many people connect with that song."

He took the his generations instruments (synths sequencers and dum machines) and made art that is not only amazingly varied and powerful, but that means so much to so many people. NIN fans are rabid. Because his music takes objectivity and intelligence to understand. This certainly isn't the newest Nickleback clone the radio is pumpin.   I have 4 years clean from a very serious heroin addiction. And to be frank, it's guys like Trent you want your son to idealize. Yeah, he used to be an angry, angst filled drug addict. But every young man is angry. But eventually we sort shit out, chill the fuck out, and have kids and the picket fence. Just like Trent is now. And it has to be mentioned: TR is blazingly intelligent.  A critical thinker. And an amazing musican. Perfect idol qualities.   Besides, if your son s as intelligent as he sounds, no song or video game is going to have him shootng up schools. This is the media fear machine thinking for you. Good people are good people, regardless f the song they heard the radio that day.   And sometimes life fucking blows. Good art reflects this in a constructive and I sightful way. I listened to music growing up because knowing others went through the low times like I did made me feel better about shit.

Not only have these responses provided many comforting possible justifications as to why this music resonates with my son so much (particularly that this music is a relatively very constructive, healthy way to cope in a world which he finds confusing and imposing at such a pivotal stage in his development, that The Downward Spiral is ultimately a cautionary tale about going down the path of self-destructive behavior, and that the more controversial aspects of the music are appealing not due to actually being something to directly identify with in all cases but sometimes simply due to the fact that it's so different/transgressive), but it's also been helpful and interesting to see all of the personal stories that have been shared; congratulations to all of you for having gotten to where you are today, and I'm glad that this one-of-a-kind music has helped you as much as it seems to be helping my son.

You don't seem all that surprised, so I guess not much   Should I maybe ask him what he finds so appealing about NIN's music, what part(s) of it speak(s) to him the most?   YES! You seem to quite appreciate NIN and also be a kind, empathetic father. You and your son might really find this a great bonding experience, and a passion that you share. Don't force it though, I guess  DISCLAIMER - late teenager who came to NIN in his late teens. It blows your mind open, with so much new to appreciate. I have a slight tendency towards depression, and initially I listened whilst I was at my most reclusive and upset. It helped enormously, but months later I would come back to NIN (though different albums/songs) and really love it. But I would reach a point where it was all I listened to, to the extent that I found non-dark, non-angsty stuff really boring, despite being relatively happy. It gradually brings me down, as it did last month too, and so now I'm trying hard to stay away.   tl;dr NIN is great and probably not that harmful. But don't let someone you care about listen to only NIN all the time. It eventually becomes a concern musically, emotionally and socially."

nin,2yeyw8,Pinwurm,6,Mon Mar 9 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this helps, but I started listening to NIN around the age of 13. (I remember the moment, too - I was on a camping trip and my older brother's friend brought some CDs along.)  I was really angsty in those early years through High School. I was bullied, I had lost a parent, I had trouble making friends, I had problems getting girls, etc. I was depressed, anxious.    Regardless of the questionable lyrical content - the music helped me make sense of things, helped me feel less lonely, and it became a backdrop to my artistic outlets later on.  And 13 years later - I've become a healthy & successful adult. I got my degree, I've traveled the world, I work in finance in a large city, I'm independent, happy, creative, I don't have trouble getting girls, or making new friends. Best of all, I still love the music!  Actually, I'm not sure if I'd be here if it wasn't for those songs. Music is a deeply personal and therapeutic experience. It's amazing that you're taking an interest into your son's life.   You should encourage and foster his taste. He plays instruments - maybe you can connect with him better by extending an olive branch and getting him a little synth or guitar pedal that Reznor may have used - maybe ask your son what those songs mean to him. Maybe he doesn't want to talk about it, maybe you won't understand, maybe he's embarrassed to talk to you about it - and that's OKAY. He's growing up and he's learning to how to handle his stress and feelings in his own way.   Just don't trample on it and don't be concerned. Your kid'll turn out alright! :)"

Me: ""you didn't find any pictures of the band, do you?"" ""No."" ""But you read the lyrics, didn't you?"" ""Yes.""  ""If you see me get into the wrong crowds or get in trouble, you have my permission to take my music away from me.  In he meantime, just let me have this.  I need this.""   We never talked about it again, and a few months later she proceeded to wait on the phone for an hour and fifteen minutes for NIN tickets.  That was my very first show without supervision.  I'll never forget it. January 5th, 1995. Rosemont Horizon.   It changed my life.   Now I'm 36, a 9 year veteran of the Navy, and am currently teaching my first year of music in an elementary school.     Your child is going to be just fine.  Your handling this entire thing exactly the way I would hope any of my students' parents would treat it.  Music is important, and for some of us, it's vital.   Hell, have an honest, unbiased talk with him.  I would have loved for my mom to have approached me with curiosity instead of resistance."
nin,2yeyw8,mkcawcutt,3,Mon Mar 9 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"Let me share a different context than some of the previous posts (thanks to those who have already contributed) and kudos to you for seeking this sub-reddit out.  It's 1994 and I'm 13. I'm a Christian (still am) who's playing drums for my youth-group worship team. Not saying a Christian can't listen to NIN - just providing context.  At the time I wasn't depressed, mad at the world or hating life. I listened to NIN and continue to do so today simply for the music.  Downward Spiral gave birth to my favorite NIN song of all-time / March of the Pigs. With an unusual time signature of 29/8 (alternating three bars of 7/8 time with one bar of 4/4 time) it was  music overload to my ears.  Setting Trent's lyrics aside I have a different appreciation for NIN music as I treat all lyrics as music. To me they're another vehicle to deliver tone, rhythm and melody.  To this day my wife and others ask me why I listen to some of the music I do given the ""subject matter"". In all honestly I hardly ever listen to the words or lyrics. I don't feel this is a slight to the artist as I'm interpreting this music in my own way.  So as a longtime NIN lover and musician (such as your boy) perhaps he loves NIN as I did - for the music. As a parent myself, I now know I tend to look at things differently or read them further than what they might appear. In your case: Does my son listening to NIN mean something?  Absolutely not."

I know you were probably aiming more for his personal traits, but what he accomplished in his life is unbelievable. He made NIN out of nothing and he did it basically by himself. He almost killed himself in the process, but he managed to came back and completely changed his life around while still being the same artist. It didn't take away anything from him musically, he was just happier person without drugs. And to think that in 10 years he managed to transform himself from depressed junkie to Oscar winning composer with wife and kids is just incredible. You ought to be very dedicated and ambitious person to manage something like this, so I guess I could say that my favourite thing about him would be his ambitiousness. He pushes himself constantly, he don't want to spend time in his comfort zone, that's just something you gotta respect."

Seeing him happy. It actually makes me smile.  By extension, it makes me really like Mariqueen as well. Truly I can't say I know much about her besides her involvement in HTDA, but anyone who makes Trent happy is good in my book. I like her posts, too :p  Trent is a guy that I respect so much, from his struggle to his masterful art, his creative mind, and his humbleness, it warms my heart to see him in a place where he is content."

I have always admired that aspect of him as an artist, and a human being, and I think it was this that made him my ultimate role model. Being prone to depression myself, his music and persistence makes me feel a lot brighter and lets me know that it can get better when things are tough, and that it is possible to move forward. It is my biggest dream to meet him and let him know how much of an impact his music has had on keeping me going when all else seems lost. Thanks, Trent."

Many bands can't pull half the stuff he can on his own, and that he never wanted to be an attention whore (which is a big reason I can't stand Manson) and let the music speak for itself and how even almost 30 years later he's still very relevant in music and still can put on a show that can blow your mind.

I was there once when he talked a little about how he was when The Wretched was written and I almost fell over.   I love that he has a family now too.

Richard, while great and helped lay the foundation of the group, is too far removed from the later end of NIN for me to consider him a contender.

He's got such a strong stage presence, such energy around him.. and don't get me wrong, I respect Robin immensely, he might even be better technical player, but watching Aaron tear shit up while doing some crazy glitch solo with guitar between his legs is just so much fun. He was exciting to watch.   And it's just sad how he ended up. Mental illnesses are no joke, I'm still hoping that he gets better sometimes and maybe do some more music in the future"

I was detached, but not in a bad way.  It was like despite the hurt, I was apart from it.  Very very weird and cool.  That's when Something I Can Never Have become my favourite song.  There's something about that time and emotion that came with it that will forever cement it in my mind.  I'm not sure I would want to feel that raw feeling with life all the time (due to the heartache that helped cause it), but I'm very happy it happened.

nin,2y508s,Reinmann,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"Driver Down is technically by Trent Reznor and not Nine Inch Nails. Regardless, the song is brilliant, and certainly underrated.   It's also the reason I first watched Lost Highway and the reason why I'm now a huge fan of David Lynch."

I remember a lot of people complaining when it became regular in 2014 sets for a bit. If In This Twilight wasn't so beautiful it would be my firm #1 from Year Zero. Atmospheric, lyrically vague enough to feel open ended but definitely fits into the concept and mystique of the album, unique in general and just a very atmospheric song that sucks you in. I actually feel like I'm lost in that dystopic world for a bit when I hear it. It just has this strong, dark, alien sound that fits so well, and Trent's vocal delivery is like hearing someone battle with different personalities.   I think it's hard to say anything on The Fragile is underrated considering it's a major fan favorite, but if anything on it has been overlooked it's Underneath It All, a song that stopped me in my tracks the first time I heard it and has been an amazing anomaly for me ever since. It has the disadvantage of being after The Big Come Down and the second to last song on a very long double album, so I guess by the time many listeners reach it, they're either worn out or just not paying as much attention."

When it comes to the softer side of NIN, I think people tend to overlook everything after The Fragile (other than ghosts and Still).

It's a good song, very energetic, and probably the most upbeat NIN song ever written. (And reminds me vaguely of a Cure song, for some reason.) Trent took a chance on something different, and I loved the result, and it kinda pisses me off to think that he might be reluctant to do so in the future, because a certain sub-set of vocal fans seem to think he's morally obligated to scowl and scream 24/7.   It's not my favorite NIN song (though it is one of my favorites on that album) but it's certainly one of their most under-rated."
nin,2y508s,5strings,1 point,Fri Mar 6 23:19:05 2015 UTC,I get huge Cure vibes from it too. Something in the sound of the guitar perhaps? I definitely agree that it is HUGELY underrated. It's probably my most listened to track on HM.

I love the build up, I love the range of it. The beginning is very FF, the short bridge is very QOTSA, and the outro is very NIN. You can hear the influence of each individual artist and I love that. I'd love to hear a Grohl, Homme, Reznor super group.   Often times the largest criticism surrounding Mantra is the lyrics and vocal delivery. Maybe I'm reading into it, but it honestly sounds like three men singing an ode to their children and the inevitability of them eventually growing up. It's incredibly well thought out.   tl;dr: It's an amazing song by three amazing artists. A strong finish to a great album."

I did quite enjoy it, I wished Trent sang more but his input was very Reznor like so I was totally ok with that.   It must have been almost a year later when I finally started listening to QOTSA, became obsessed, and now Mantra is a song with TWO of my favourite artists, and another great guy who helped out with their music at song stage or another.

I wouldn't be too happy seeing people taking high quality photos of my work and putting it online for people to print when I want to sell editions of prints that I make of my work.   But seeing that you're not doing it to make money, it's not so bad. Just irks me is all.   Russell might think differently about it."

I had some nice sales around the holidays but it's so crappy here (near Chicago) nobody is really getting out much. I hope for it to pick up more in the spring. I've made my way on to the local Arts and Cukture committee for our Art District / Main Street Association and we have an Art Space moving in so I'm hoping to push my work more soon. But it takes a lot of time and effort and money to hone a craft and make pieces available. Even those who've 'made it' spent their life trying to do so. If everyone just ripped their work and printed it at Kinkos, well...there would be much less art to steal."

When I became fully aware of my surroundings again, I looked over to see my turtles with this excoriating look of uncharitable judgement towards me.   Sort of a ""what fucking exactly is it you think you're doing"" and ""why don't you make yourself useful and get us a shrimp cube?"" kind of expression.

Trent had been teasing with his usual ""soon"" updates and TONS of photos from the recording sessions. People were getting really antsy because the photos had tons of session musicians and crazy instruments and setups.  I think a lot of people(on ETS at the time) were expecting a more traditional rock album, but something more layered and textured given the Adrian Belew and Allessandro collabs.  I was at work at a call center and I was refreshing the website every few minutes. Eventually it came up and I immediately tried ordering but the site was really glitchy. The first part was streaming for free but it was also bogged down and glitchy because of the proxy I used at work to get around web filters.  It was so overwhelming. There were so many different ways to buy it. I still have my deluxe edition, which is a little dusty now but looks really badass. Trent knows how to do physical packaging.  I'm still hoping for a new chapter of Ghosts some day."

Their first album is just full of track after track of interesting music that went on to inspire things like Nine Inch Nails, Tool, and even Metallica. Even if it was unintentional, they're definitely forerunners of the heavy metal and industrial scenes. As for this Democracy remix, it's really different from the original and I prefer it by far. It highlights Trent's distinct transitional period sound from The Downward Spiral to The Fragile. Like the Perfect Drug, the primary example of that era, it's fast paced and seemingly anomalous as far as nin stylization goes. But, it's good and I like it. Plus, around 2:20 there are some nice synth blips that remind me a lot of Nothing Stays by Cyberaktif."

I played Doom when it was new, and got it as soon as I could when I got my first PC. So I was very eager to get Quake when it came out. I had my grandfather take me to Target and I got the demo/shareware Quake disc. I popped it in, installed, loaded it up, and was blown away. The sounds, the look... the music... This is what you get when you first start it up. It was so dark and scary and new to me. I absolutely loved it.   Growing up I would play the soundtrack all the time, it was one of my favorite cds. I'd also play it on Halloween when I gave out candy. This made little kids cry as they left with their candy. You could hear it a block away.  It's still one of my favorites."

To be fair though, my overall point had more to with the actual joy stemming from listening to it (and I did say it was useful for editing). If you're interested in archiving music or editing the tracks, it's an important release, but if we're just talking about a release worth buying for the pleasure of it, general NIN fans need only worry about grabbing The Downward Spiral and With Teeth as far as novelty audio editions go (and I'm not using ""novelty"" in a derisive way either, I think 5.1 is the ideal way to listen to these albums)."

It was the most paradigm shifting aural experience I have ever had. The familiar songs that had been apart of my life for the past decade didn't just sound good...they sounded ALIVE.

Ruiner in particular had me air guitaring like a madman, and the Chorus is much clearer through a seperate channel - some may have liked the cluttered feeling of it where it could be hard to make out exactly what trent was saying, but as it's in my opinion one of his best songs I am glad to hear it clearly - especially when the other elements are not diminished.  So happy. Thank you."

The ""Fat Back Dub Mix"" is good but it doesn't retain that strong emphasis on the guitar that their early-mid albums had (Light, certain songs on Nihil, and definitely in XTORT).  It certainly has the awesome guitar riffs from Light, but I was hoping that Trent would have expanded on or added to them instead of focusing on the synth/bassy/beats.  Broken only came out a year before that which has some godlike guitar riffs, textures, melodies, etc. so I don't think it's too excessive to expect some of that in the remix.  If I didn't know it was Nine Inch Nails I probably would've listened to it once or twice. But I really like the beginning of it. Similar to Trent's cover of Memorabilia until 30 seconds in.  I think the Die Warzau ""Rubber Gloves Dub"" and the Vince Lawrence ""Lighthouse"" remixes are a little more imaginative and expand more on the original.  I want NIN to do more covers :("

In 2011, Buckingham was ranked 100th in Rolling Stone magazine's 2011 list of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"".  In Fleetwood Mac's heyday, Buckingham was known for his fingerpicking guitar style and wide vocal range as well as the sometimes tense chemistry between himself and former girlfriend and member Stevie Nicks.

nin,2wzp9i,WombatWithWings,5,Tue Feb 24 14:30:31 2015 UTC,I've been wandering about this as well.  My only guess is the original master tapes had some issues that prevented getting a clear instrumental cut.
nin,2wzp9i,senateguard33,2,Tue Feb 24 17:36:32 2015 UTC,Could it possibly have to do with the copyright of the samples used? I've wondered myself why Ruiner in particular isn't on there.

nin,2wrzwu,teleekom,10,Sun Feb 22 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"What a superficially strange, yet incredibly successful collaboration. This is a great song that fuses the best of Bowie and the more distinct parts of Trent's instrumentalization. In the last ten or so seconds a very Downward Spiral-esque synth riff kicks in, which is simply fantastic. The lyrics are solid, simple, and powerful. The video is entertaining and intriguing. Overall, a fantastic effort from both artists."
nin,2wrzwu,Reinmann,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"It isn't so strange, though. David Bowie is amazing not just because of his talent, but his ability to spot talent, and to capitalize on new artforms by managing to incorporate the most salient bits from those talented individuals before they become mainstream. He usually picks stuff from the fringes, and brings it into the mainstream. Glam, Outsider art, Philly Soul, and countless other instances come to mind. He was kind of behind the curve on this, but he definitely did choose an amazing talent. Trent is kinda like him, but we can see how the musical landscape has shifted to the point where now, if you want to do anything interesting at all, you should pretty much forget about mainstream success. This makes for the very stagnant mainstream we have now, as it is difficult to commercialize new ideas and keep these ridiculous profit margins going, and those ideas are what keeps music fresh. Trent really rose to popularity when things were still at a sort of midway point. Still, he got pigeonholed, in my opinion. He maybe could have been something like Bowie, had things been more open. The gothy thing just got stuck on him, but I think they are both genuine artists' artists.  I found it strange that the tour was called the Oddball Couple tour, because they really seemed a perfect fit to me, in many ways."

It would be great to have it split into tracks instead of 1 or 2 long ones (not sure if that was already your plan).  As far as hosting, I'm not sure what the mods have to say, but whatever works. There are free hosting sites and even a Dropbox link to a zip might work for the size of this sub? Eventually it'll end up on torrents anyway if it's good. Not to be a jerk but adding it to a big torrent site and just posting the file name would get us there without actually linking it if there is indeed a mod problem. I'm eager to listen to it!

nin,2wloef,Metalcentraldialog,3,Fri Feb 20 23:46:28 2015 UTC,Impressive collection.  I basically own all the studio halos except for Hesitation Marks.
nin,2wloef,ninfan200,2,Sat Feb 21 00:33:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I bought HM digitally. I love NIN, my favorite band, but HM will never be a part of me like the rest of it. The remix albums are good, though. Wish I could find my old UK versions of Closer."
nin,2wloef,Metalcentraldialog,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:30:28 2015 UTC,I can relate. I love NIN and think every album done by Trent is glorious...but Hesitation Marks didn't feel like his strongest. I only enjoyed the first 5 songs off of it.

nin,2wgrh8,teleekom,8,Thu Feb 19 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"I know there's a lack of real evidence of where Trent is on this but I'll say that in general Like Clockwork is phenomenal. Definitely my favorite album of 2013, and that's saying something; 2013 was a stacked year music-wise.  Elton John brings a great style to this (I'm seeing him live in a few weeks and am very excited for it) and as a whole it's a really great track. A lot of songs on this album build and explode and this is another one that follows that formula, it really works."

nin,2wgrh8,illmatic2112,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:09:11 2015 UTC,I hear you.... I've gotta say Like Clockwork is a much better album than Era Vulgaris in terms of recent albums from QOTSA and it feels like Josh experimented a little more vocally on Like Clockwork...   Still miss Oliveri in the mix though... the dude is smooth and edgy at the same time...
nin,2wgrh8,listofdemands,7,Sun Feb 22 22:48:21 2015 UTC,"From what source? I remember watching Anthony Fantano do a review on the album and believing he was incorrect because Trent was on Kalopsia but I wasn't sure if he was on any others that were confirmed.   Other than that, it's a fantastic song once I figured out all the lyrics, and Elton John. Wow. Pretty epic huh?"

Now that I'm older, it's a lot easier to build muscle and also a little too easy to put on fat.  Obviously, he's put a lot of work into his physique, but getting older and a slowing metabolism helps hold on to those gains. Notice how he gradually bulked up after 30? I think this is the age it usually starts."

nin,2w14o0,PersistenceOfLoss,3,Mon Feb 16 02:44:25 2015 UTC,"Both the film and soundtrack are so dark and brooding, it kind of turns me off.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but man...have to be in the mood to listen to it. This sense of dread and disgust just oozes from it.  Almost like he did his job TOO well.  I don't expect him to do comedies or anything, but I liked that The Social Network allowed the electronic to sort of bubble out, in a pleasing way (Intriguing Possibilities, Carbon Prevails, etc).   But it's all good, and if he did nothing but movies scores from now on, I'd still pick up every one."
nin,2w14o0,signofthenine,3,Mon Feb 16 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"Still one of the best sountracks i've heard, it's such a beautiful palette of cold, complex and tortured melodies. It's a great representation of a hostile winter and it fits so well with the atmosphere of the movie (even though I feel that some tracks were kinda squizzed into the movie). I was tempted many times to but the vinyl deluxe box but 300$ is waaaaay top high.  While Waiting is for me one of the best tracks on this."
nin,2w14o0,Space_Haiku,2,Mon Feb 16 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"Hands down. Its a great album. Even though its a 3 disc album and falling short about a minute of an exact 3 hour duration..its like the fragile an album that you can't condense. Sure you can make a sampler but...you can't say ""take this track out so its shorter"" every song is that good. My three favorite songs are the main theme (forgot the title of it right now), Oraculum and A Thousand Details (too bad the latter two are not in the movie)  Also...soemthing I like genreally about the Trent Reznor soundtracks is that you can listen to it without the context of the movie."

I was against the remake, feeling that Noomi Rapace's performance was SO masterful and heart wrenching, until I found out Trent was doing the score... And then I had to be there on opening night."
nin,2w14o0,qyasogk,3,Mon Feb 16 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how did you end up feeling about the film? I personally thoroughly enjoyed it and found it to be a great adaptation of the novel."
nin,2w14o0,kleiner352,4,Mon Feb 16 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"Again, I was predisposed towards not liking the film, because the original was so amazing. If it hadn't been Fincher directing and Trent scoring, I would not have even seen it. That said, I was astounded at how good the movie was. Fincher managed to make his own film, without totally Americanizing the whole thing, and still managed to preserve the major story points.  Honestly, he pulled off a minor miracle in making the film as good as it was.  Rooney Mara performed magically as well, and she had very large shoes to fill to even come close to Noomi Rapace's performance."
nin,2w14o0,qyasogk,1 point,Mon Feb 16 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"TGWTDT was a very good soundtrack, though I find The Social Network soundtrack more gripping.  I have not listened to Gone Girl, so I cannot comment.  I think that each soundtrack was perfect for the movie.    The Social Network being obviously more approachable could be the reason it gets much more praise.  TGWTDT has piercing songs that bring the album alive, especially in the dark world of that movie.  I keep the album in my car, because I find the ambient score to be settling on rather stressful days."

It's perfect to me, great as a standalone and yet the film's atmosphere would not have worked without it.

There's no subreddit flair for it though, which saddens me."

nin,2vz50c,FoleyStudios,3,Sun Feb 15 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"That interrogation scene in the beginning was really well done, you really managed to capture the suspense of that moment, the actor did a great job here and I think the choice of music in this was very good as well. Camera work was really good at places, not much fan of shaky cam/hand held, but I understand it is probably more convenient and easier to use hand held in those scenes. I really admire your dedication, lot of work was obviously put into this project. I would probably go with less blending transitions, it just always seemed a bit cheep looking to me. That police raid scene was kinda funny due to CGI, but I don't expect Hollywood grade effects from YouTube show. So, once again, thank you for doing this"
nin,2vz50c,teleekom,2,Sun Feb 15 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! We need your support! We're not professionists, so we try to do our best with the CGI when necessary."

nin,2vzg0n,teleekom,2,Sun Feb 15 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing this waay back when it was released. its a pretty stellar remix and you can really hear where the three all lent their hands, particularly Cortini's analogue electronics. If im not mistaken Alessandro was in the studio to work with tr and atticus on htda, and this was a side project.  telepathe are also a pretty neat band to look into if synthpop is your thing."

nin,2vvt3k,teleekom,2,Sat Feb 14 16:33:20 2015 UTC,"I found this song underwhelming from both artists. Zachs flow here is unimpressive and the music is kinda boring too. Trent said there was a lot of issues with Zach not showing up and general lack of interest in the project. The work between Zach and DJ Shadow is a much better effort, although I'm willing to bet from the way the lyrics are chopped up and processed in the DJ shadow song that it was more of a ""here's a tape of some latest lyrics"" and shadow pretty much made the track entirely."

nin,2vryf1,teleekom,13,Fri Feb 13 16:08:56 2015 UTC,"I def hear the Reznor influence in this song. Reznor's best album produced outside of NIN.  I really think The Reflecting God might be the most Reznor influenced track on ACS. He also contributed Rhodes piano to that. Love it! It's really a shame that Reznor and Manson had a falling out, because musically they melded very well."
nin,2vryf1,OSLIN,10,Fri Feb 13 16:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sort of related, have you heard Manson's new album?  It's really solid.  Not something I'd expect to enjoy in 2015.    Thanks for this.  I need to go revisit Antichrist Superstar now."
nin,2vryf1,GetReady72,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:05:11 2015 UTC,I gotta agree that Deep Six video was really retarded. It reminiscent of that stupid Walking Dead meme with Carl. And Manson's voice on live shows lately.. not really great to be honest.

I sort of stopped paying attention to his records after Holy Wood and I had absolutely zero expectation for Pale Emperor, but it is really good. I would even go that far that it was one of my favourite records of 2014 (considering the very early leak)"
nin,2vryf1,Protonbeamface,2,Sun Feb 15 04:15:53 2015 UTC,"If you haven't heard it I cannot recommend the instrumental versions of EMDM enough, Skold wrote some gorgeous songs for it and there's an entire outro for Evidence that was cut for the final album version."
nin,2vryf1,Soulstem,3,Fri Feb 13 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite MM tracks and that knowledge escaped my attention. There's so many layers of guitar and vocal, I can't tell which parts are by TR. But the 'wall of sound' in the chorus is reminiscent of some parts of Broken and Fixed.  'Mister Superstar' to me feels deliberately more raw and less polished than the rest of AS. It almost feels like it would have fit into Portrait of an American Family. I think MM was kind of nodding to the themes of that album."
nin,2vryf1,outcidermouth19,3,Fri Feb 13 20:15:41 2015 UTC,This a a bit off topic but does anyone know specifically WHY Manson and Trent had a falling out?

As far as Passive go, it's not exactly clear how was Trent involved in it, although you probably could say that's another song of theirs. Is Trent credited for Passive though?"

I don’t like to shut doors. I love what he does and I’m very impressed with the sounds he makes and the way he produces things… There probably will be another time for us to do something, but as you can tell I’m deeply busy (laughs)…”   Well, good!

nin,2vmz7g,signofthenine,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:12:56 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what happened between Trent and Adrian? Did they have a major falling out during the recording of HM or what?
nin,2vmz7g,EvenDeeper,2,Thu Feb 12 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"(Paraphrasing, as I don't have a link in front of me, and I'm at work:) He was going to be on the HM tour (and was announced as included in the live lineup, I'm pretty sure). Based on his comments, he was under the impression they were going to reinvent the way certain songs sounded.  But when it came to rehearsals, it was basically the same way they'd been done before, with nothing really new added to the mix.  So he politely bowed out.  TR, while a perfectionist (esp how things are supposed to look/sound live), seems a bit more laid back these days, so I would hope he didn't hold it against Adrian."
nin,2vjsvn,teleekom,10,Wed Feb 11 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"First time I heard this song I thought to myself, ""Wow, Saul Williams sounds a lot like Trent in the beginning."" I am an idiot.  I definitely think you should do other songs from this album. Definitely my favorite collaboration and I don't think enough people know about it."
nin,2vjsvn,MrSmith_goes_to_bed,8,Wed Feb 11 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"I don't remember where I read it, but didn't Trent say that a lot of unused stems from the fragile were kinda loaned out to Saul for the purposes of the album?  You can definitely hear NIN type bass sounds in a few songs. Most notably WTF!, Break, and Banged and Blown Through."
nin,2vjsvn,Oscill,4,Wed Feb 11 16:53:59 2015 UTC,What's a stem?
nin,2vjsvn,MDef255,15,Wed Feb 11 18:14:40 2015 UTC,"A stem in this context is a basic sound file intended for use in a music work, or as a sound effect in a film. For The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, Trent made extensive use of a lot of non-instrument sounds like doors slamming, objects being scraped on other objects and a ton of other 'source material', which were recorded as ""stems"" and then manipulated, processed, looped, stretched, compressed and otherwise tweaked until he came up with the actual sounds you hear on the album. Those stems are just simple digital files that can be transferred to anyone. Trent himself has made them available to the public for non-commercial use. He has invited fans to remix his songs and given them the original elements to do so. Trent knows what he would want as a fan, and is more than happy to give it to the folks who have made him a millionaire."
nin,2vjsvn,TheCheshireCody,5,Wed Feb 11 19:30:00 2015 UTC,"Just to expand slightly on what you've already stated: a stem can also be a completed audio track pre-mixdown. So let's say I have all of the bass guitar + effects all in a single track, if I were to export just that track instead of mixing down the master bus, I'd have a bass guitar stem."
nin,2vjsvn,Oscill,5,Wed Feb 11 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Good expansion. It can really be any element that gets put into a project, from a single click to a full drum or vocal track, or any combination of tracks that you'd want to manipulate."
nin,2vjsvn,TheCheshireCody,6,Wed Feb 11 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"more accurately, a ""stem"" is just a ""track"" in music: a drum track, a bass track, a guitar part, etc."
nin,2vjsvn,tricil,2,Wed Feb 11 19:41:50 2015 UTC,"Trent produced the album, so more than just ""loaning"" the stems out, he really just brought them with him."
nin,2vjsvn,TheCheshireCody,6,Wed Feb 11 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"I really wish Saul and Trent would work together again. As much as Saul's last album grew on me, it was nowhere near as good as Niggy."

I think last I heard with Saul, he was on The Colbert Report doing beat poetry to promote a Broadway show he was in (about Tupac).  I think that closed, and Trent's free now.  A man can dream!"
nin,2vjsvn,Latch,3,Wed Feb 11 23:04:17 2015 UTC,WTF is one of my favourite tracks from that album.  The Year Zero / Niggy Stardust albums sound like an entirely new genre of music that I need to hear more of!

nin,2vfl8p,ninger6,4,Wed Feb 11 04:21:56 2015 UTC,"Even though Trent was a little more involved with Kalopsia, his vocals on this song still add a solid atmosphere to it. I was disappointed that this track didn't make it onto the Era Vulgaris album. Some of the B-sides (including this one) ended up better than a lot of the songs that did make it on. I recommend a listen to the song ""The Fun Machine Took A Shit! And Died"" along with this track."

nin,2varfx,timrbrady,4,Mon Feb 9 23:22:57 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with the nature of modern vinyl releases. It's difficult/expensive to buy albums on vinyl from most artists that are a few years old. Basically, if you're into vinyl and want an album, buy it on release or expect to pay a lot more for it later. Add to that NIN fans are big collectors of the physical catalog and you have yourself a perfect storm for scarcity."
nin,2varfx,timrbrady,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:30:47 2015 UTC,"But your last point should make it easier for the label to keep the records in print. Lots of classic popular stuff, like the albums by Joy Division, you can still buy wherever records are sold. Pretty Hate Machine is still in print on vinyl, isn't it?  So if they can sell that one, why not the others?"

nin,2varfx,timrbrady,4,Mon Feb 9 14:44:26 2015 UTC,"PHM was re-released twice within the last few years. A re-press of the original album and a remaster with the revamped packaging and all. TDS was re-pressed somewhere in the late '00s as well. Being ""in-print"" means they're currently in production, which I don't think is the case. The two of which are the more easily, and cheaply, found of the the older Halos on wax.  The fact that there are still ""new"" copies of With Teeth and later albums available on vinyl, at a high price, means there's no reason for the labels, or Trent, to look into pressing new ones. The amount they'd have to produce just wouldn't be financially feasible for the amount of people who want them. The higher price for the remaining unpurchased copies is justified by their now scarcity. When it comes to The Fragile, which hasn't been in print for more than a decade, our best bet is that long awaited re-release that was said to be in production around it's 10th anniversary. Still waiting on that one.  Interestingly, while searching Amazon for examples on this I found that the copy of Hesitation Marks I bought upon release has gone down by almost half and the copy of With Teeth I bought on release has gone up almost 1000%."

The >amount they'd have to produce just wouldn't be financially feasible >for the amount of people who want them.    By that logic, nothing would ever get repressed, yet the market for vinyl reissues is huge. Vinyl pressings can be pretty small, some smaller labels might only do a few hundred copies of a record.  Do you really think there aren't 500 or 1000 collectors who would pay $30 for a new vinyl copy of With Teeth, but wouldn't pay $300 (about what they cost on Discogs)? Interscope or Trent or whoever shouldn't care about protecting the scarcity of the copies already out there, because they aren't the ones profiting from them.   Just out of curiosity, I checked the last pressing of each halo on Discogs. You're right that almost none of them have been repressed since their original releases, which mostly occurred in the ""dark ages"" of vinyl.  01 - 1990 (reissue)  02 - 2011 (reissue)  03 - 1991 (reissue)  04 - 1991 (reissue)  05 - 1992 (original)  06 - 1992 (original)  07 - 1994 (original)  08 - 2010 (reissue)  09 - 1994 (original)  10 - Never  11 - 1997 (promo only)  12 - N/A (video)  13 - 1999 (original)  14 - 1999 (original)  15 - Unknown (promo? bootleg?)  16 - 2000 (original)  17 - Never  18 - 2005 (original)  19 - 2005 (original)  20 - 2005 (original)   21 - 2006 (promo only)  22 - N/A (video)  23 - 2007 (original)  24 - 2007 (original)   25 - 2007 (original)  26 - 2008 (original)  27 - 2008 (original)  28 - 2013 (original)"
nin,2varfx,senateguard33,2,Mon Feb 9 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"If record labels were logical, they would pay their musicians and do their best to avoid insane price gouging from 3rd party sellers. Unfortunately, record labels have no idea what logic is anymore.   As far as repressings go, there's a few factors at play.   First, I highly highly doubt Trent has any say whatsoever on reissues. He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the TDS and PHM repressings that came out a couple years ago, and if Trent had any say, I'm sure The Fragile wouldn't be a white whale for all of us record collectors.   Second, it's extremely rare (if it even happens at all) for an artist as big as Nine Inch Nails to do a limited run of 100/500/1,000+ copies because the fan base is WAY too big for 100 copies to be fair, and it's practically guaranteed that 50%+ would end up on discogs with triple digit price tags. As an example, another band I listen to called Periphery just released a new album that they did a limited 100 copy release for in Europe. Their fanbase (I'm using facebook as a reference point) is approximately 1/10th of NIN's, and their new album (which is only two weeks old) is already going for $100+ on discogs, and they've only been around a couple of years. So right away, you're dealing with a situation where a 1,000 copy pressing of a NIN album would probably result in the same kind of situation, if not worse.   Next is the cost of vinyl production. I just did a quick google search for production costs, and to press 5,000 copies of an album on 1 180g LP with the most basic artwork possible is already over $20,000. We all know Trent likes some sweet ass packaging for his stuff, and The Fragile is a 3xLP, so you're looking at $60,000+ for 5,000 copies of The Fragile with basic, basic artwork. 10,000 copies will be well over $100,000, plus another $15-25k for artwork and the custom triple gatefold packaging, etc. Will 10,000 copies sell? It's anyone's guess. But if I had to guess, I'd say it's too great an investment for them to make, even with the popularity NIN has."
nin,2varfx,senateguard33,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:26:16 2015 UTC,Never for 15. There was a test pressing on discogs with a real odd font choice but no official WITT vinyl pressing.
nin,2varfx,senateguard33,2,Mon Feb 9 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"It's all about supply and demand. Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral are NIN's best selling albums, and usually the ""go tos"" for new and casual fans. Therefore, these ones will get re-pressed and remain easy to find.  While vinyl sales have gone up, they're not outselling mp3 or CD by any means.  The Fragile, With Teeth and Year Zero are not hard to find second hand.  I'm a regular on the NIN collecting online forums, and I can tell you most are compulsive/competitive and willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a single item.  Online sellers can see what things have sold for, so that's how they base their pricing."
nin,2varfx,tricil,4,Mon Feb 9 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"More people would collect NIN records if they didn't cost hundreds of dollars each.  A few months ago Skinny Puppy reissued their Mythmaker LP on Metropolis Records.  That's an album that was previously available on vinyl when SPV released it in 2007. It's not a ""go to"" album for casual fans- in fact, it's quite a deviation from their classic era style, and a lot of people didn't like it. How is there more demand for an unpopular Skinny Puppy album that was unavailable for maybe 6 years, than a popular NIN album like Broken that's been unavailable for 20?"
nin,2varfx,tricil,2,Mon Feb 9 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"Some very valid points.  Metropolis records is the main label for the industrial/ebm scene. Bands like Skinny Puppy and Front Line Assembly are keeping them in business.   Interscope can't be bothered with something if it will sell less than 20,000 copies, but they don't want to let go of their rights either."
nin,2varfx,Ivashkin,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"Metropolis licenses out some of their releases for the vinyl version:  They do the Skinny Puppy and KMFDM themselves, but the new Front Line Assembly and Download vinyl actually comes out on a smaller Canadian label called Artoffact.  So I wonder if Interscope ""can't be bothered"" to repress NIN vinyl, could they find someone else to do it while retaining the rights?"

Overall, Year Zero is such an interesting release that it simply needs more video content than just Survivalism. I think this track would be a good, danceable step toward that.

The Becoming (other than the ""unplugged"" Still version. Not that it was bad, but it was just a performance video.)  The Great Below  Somewhat Damaged   Where is Everybody?

Most of this effort has been a means to learn the ins and outs of music engineering, but I like it, and everyone has to start somewhere. The recent spat of NIN mixes that I've shared this month through mixcloud are another facet of learning the tools of the trade. I am constantly working to improve the craft, and this is more-or-less the best I have to offer thus far. I am trying to get beyond shyness and self-doubt, since these traits have been unhelpful and outright debilitating so far.   What about you? What music are you making? I'm frankly surprised that more people don't share their work here, although I am well aware of the reddit music-making community that exists already and the plights of shyness, or aversion to coming across as a shameless self-promoter.

I think your pacing and cadence really resonates with the overall groove. I don't listen to rap that often, but 2 tracks in and the hook is set. I'm looking forward to hearing the rest. Nice blend of serious contemplation and playfulness so far. Politically, I think we might get along well.   Quick question: did you write the beats too, or collaborate with someone else? Would you mind sharing a bit about your creative process and background?  Edit: had to stop at ""Dementor"". Your music is great! This one lyric ""I'm a product of the 90's, the fault lies therein. I was taught to be myself but not to win"" struck a serious chord with me. I'm in my early 30's, and have recently began formulating a theory about the traumatic effects of being raised in a pre-9/11 world only to come of age in a world of twisted terrorism, reform, and deception. I wrote a song about that issue, but don't have a recording yet. Thank you for sharing these tracks! Please let us know when your new project is live. And by the way, we're neighbors!

If you know Trent's music, you can definitely hear that there's a deep influence in the music I'm working on, but I've definitely tried to make it my own. I think (hope) I've succeeded.  In true TR fashion, I've decided to challenge myself by making the entire album and all its parts by myself. It's been super tough, but I'm very, very proud of it so far.  It's a bit of a concept album, and I started writing it as a prequel to another album I've been working on. It's turning out way better than I thought it would.

nin,2uindl,timrbrady,1 point,Mon Feb 2 15:32:07 2015 UTC,Aaron North was my personal favorite guitarist.  He's just... Something very special.
nin,2uindl,parkman47,8,Sat Feb 7 08:32:51 2015 UTC,This would have been when Josh Freese and Jeordie White were in the touring band. Borland as part of that would have been great.
nin,2uindl,Sirusavath,4,Mon Feb 2 16:04:39 2015 UTC,APC at one point had Josh and Jordie touring with them as well...would certainly have been interesting to see Wes play with APC rather than James Iha
nin,2uindl,Raidernationprez,7,Mon Feb 2 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of Bizkit, but I can respect Wes Borland, he is a very competent musician. But I would take Aaron North over him any second, he's still my favourite NIN guitarist, he was just absolute beast on WT tour and it's really shame how he ended up.  This thread made me listen to Cruel Melody from Black Light Burns though, which I really enjoy and that album is just great. I probably dig this album more than anything Bizkit ever done"

nin,2txof9,mynameistrain,8,Wed Jan 28 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"I hate to call the studio version's muffling of the guitar a missed opportunity because I still really like the track and think it helps build up the album's overall slide into decay, but hearing this riff in its unmitigated glory is fantastic. I definitely think it's the strongest riff of Trent's whole catalog."

Year Zero is certainly Amazing, but for me, it's probably tied for second place with ""The Downward Spiral"".  Despite being tied for second place, I do listen to Year Zero way more often than any other NIN album.  The Fragile needs a dark, quiet place and amazing headphones and active, intentional listening, while Year Zero is perfect for listening to on cheap cans on the subway or out for a walk, or while out for a drive, or on the awesome headphones..."
nin,2tkb76,kyleclements,5,Sun Jan 25 01:21:40 2015 UTC,"I'm the exact same way. The Fragile is my favorite and Year Zero is tied with The Downward Spiral for second.  Although I do listen to some songs off The Fragile in my car, like Into The Void and The Fragile."
nin,2tkb76,greeniguana6,19,Mon Jan 26 23:07:07 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, in that I think the album is very under appreciated among NIN fans. The album stands out as different from the rest of the NIN catalog. Not necessarily in a better or worse way, but just different. Sometimes I even think of Year Zero as a side project of Trent's. He just did something so different from all the other NIN albums. And it's incredibly successful at doing what it intended to do. I put it among my favorite albums of all time, but not necessarily my favorite NIN album."
nin,2tkb76,moskie,5,Sun Jan 25 00:15:19 2015 UTC,"Seconding the side project statement. I think its awesome music but it doesn't sound like NIN to me. I would still rank it second or third NIN albums officially, but I feel TDS will always be what I associate NIN with personally."
nin,2tkb76,13isaacz1,10,Sun Jan 25 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like NIN?  I never understood this thought, though I've heard it from a lot of people.  I've never once felt like this wasn't very distinctly a NIN album.  Sure, it's a bit more glitchy and electronic sounding, but so what?  The structure, the melodies, the lyrics, are all VERY much NIN.  It still borrows sound directly from the rest of his library.  It still has a very distinctly industrial sound.  The drum beats in particular are every single bit of Nine Inch Nails.  The sounds the guitars make are very much Nine Inch Nails.  It's not like NIN's library is a stranger to glitchy electronic noises, considering what Trent uses to compose a lot of these sounds.  He just utilizes them more than usual in Year Zero.  Associating a single album with what you feel is NIN's definitive sound just seems foolhardy and pointless, IMO.  Saying ""TDS is NIN"" just doesn't make sense when there is such an absurdly large library of not only official releases, but also a slew of unofficial releases.  There is a very obvious progression of style in the library, and to say that any single album defines the band or defines Trent Reznor is just far too simplistic.  NIN has a very distinct sound through ALL of his work, that has never gone away, and that's why I love the band.  It's so different in every iteration, but is still very distinctly NIN.  Yet every single album brings something different to the table.  So to say that a single album defines the band, when there is so much content, and when it all manages to retain a trademark sound... that just doesn't compute.  The PROGRESSION is what defines NIN.  The idea that every single album can reflect the band's sound, yet still have its own point and its own hook, and manage to stand alone as its own unique take on NIN.  That defines NIN to me more than any single album."
nin,2tkb76,HCPwny,5,Sun Jan 25 21:12:14 2015 UTC,"I rethought my statement after reading your comment. I think you're right especially about the actual sounds/musical features. I think the reason it stands apart to me (not in a good or bad way), is how specific the songs are and how the album concept is very much defined and telling this story with clear character roles. TDS is very ambiguous as far as the story goes, we get the highs and lows and can track certain things happening but the main character is unnamed and things are left open to interpretation. Meanwhile Year Zero has this story with characters, settings, ideologies etc. that is very much specific. I think that may be the main reason I said what I said. I feel if Year Zero had no lyrics or just different lyrics I would accept it as part of the NIN discography with less hesitation.   Anyway regardless of the differences I love it but just personally associate NIN's with TDS because it was the first album I heard and I am by no means as serious a fan as many people on this sub so take everything I said as just my personal opinions.   Just felt like adding that while progression may be what defines NIN's I think work both before and after Year Zero were more similar to each other than Year Zero so it would be a bit of an anomaly I suppose, again not at all a bad thing, just different in my opinion."
nin,2tkb76,13isaacz1,17,Mon Jan 26 06:50:41 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're not alone. Year Zero used to be my favorite, but now it's holding strong in third place under The Fragile and The Downward Spiral. I definitely see Year Zero as the pinnacle of Trent's post-fragile career. It's his least personal album and his most effective. If Year Zero didn't exist, I may be able to understand some old fans and their reservation about anything after The Fragile. And as far as comparing it to With Teeth, I personally see no competition between the two whatsoever."
nin,2tkb76,Reinmann,-1,Sun Jan 25 00:10:40 2015 UTC,Comparing With Teeth with The Fragile is like comparing 1 with 10 on a scale from 1 to 10...
nin,2tkb76,kyleclements,6,Thu Jan 29 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"No brother. Its also my favourite NIN album for a number of reasons. Its easily Trent's most ambitious effort and it stands out from the usual Trent's introspective singing and instead with focus externally about the dystopian future in the Year Zero universe. I prefer Year Zero over With Teeth but still love With Teeth with a passion.   Songs like Capital G, The Great Destroyer and Zero-Sum certainly go in my top 10 NIN songs.   I still love most of the other albums. Choosing Year Zero over my 2nd favourite The Fragile is a very tough choice. I only chose Year Zero as my favourite a couple of months ago which I still stand by. That may very well change but for now I feel more immersed into Year Zero that any other NIN album."
nin,2tkb76,Flimflamification,4,Sun Jan 25 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"Easily Trent's most ambitious effort   Whoa whoa whoa.  I just don't know about that.  I think TDS took more balls.    I think a certain type of nin fan sees everything after The Fragile as a very different nin that they are no where near as into.  If I go back and listen to TDS and PHM I have such an intense emotional response.  I feel like Trent used to pour a very private part of himself into his music and he doesn't necessarily do that anymore.  I'm not saying that any of this is good or bad, just different.  He has obviously been through a shit ton and dealt with addiction.  He made it through and that's awesome.  It's interesting that Hesitation Marks has been compared to older nin material and also was pretty widely seen as a really good nin album.  I think I'm more excited to see what Trent does with nin now than I have been since the fragile was about to come out."
nin,2tkb76,mdwvt,3,Sun Jan 25 05:30:50 2015 UTC,"The thing about Year Zero having balls is that Trent knew it would never achieve mainstream success upon its release.  It was too different, it contained sentiments which were unpopular at the time, and it challenged the status quo a little too much.  Its sound was entirely unfriendly to radio audiences.  TDS on the other hand, reflected the sentiment of that crowd at the time of its release.  It was ballsy and angry sure, and it definitely defined an era, but the music scene was READY for it.  Year Zero on the other hand... Well, let's just say the music scene STILL isn't ready for it."
nin,2tkb76,HCPwny,3,Sun Jan 25 21:23:42 2015 UTC,I've noticed that it took about 10-15 years for The Fragile to really sink into popular culture.  Now songs from that album grace the trailers of countless movies.  I bet Year Zero will be all over other media in 2020.
nin,2tkb76,kyleclements,5,Thu Jan 29 06:13:09 2015 UTC,"Zero-Sum is one of the most beautiful songs Trent has ever written.  It is a masterpiece in and of itself.  As for the rest of the album, it is my favorite every time I come back to it.  I was first introduced to it before I was really a big NIN fan, and the friend who introduced it to me was very anti-Year Zero but was a NIN fan otherwise.  And it just sounded weird to me at the time, so I didn't really give it a chance until I had already experienced most of NIN's other albums.  Then I gave it a shot, and fell in love with it.  It is arguably Trent's best album, and as someone else here said, it was his least personal album, and I think it required that he separate himself personally from the subject matter and address much wider topics than any one person's feelings.  The story it tells, and the way it tells it, is so relatable to so many people.  From a technical standpoint and a design standpoint, it's just brilliant.  He really did something unique that will probably never be replicated by anyone else in such a way.  It is a timeless album.. sort of... from the moment it released, and on into future society, it will be a warning.  It's a cry for help from society.  It's a description of events that have happened and will happen again, and some that could be changed if we don't wait until it's too late."
nin,2tkb76,HCPwny,5,Sun Jan 25 07:06:25 2015 UTC,The Downward Spiral will always hold top spot for me because of personal reasons but Year Zero was a solid listen. Off the top of my head I can't think of any NIN  songs I don't care for.  The thing about YZ  is that I can't remember any specific tracks  that jump out at me but it's been awhile since I've heard it.  What's your favorite song from the album?
nin,2tkb76,diewrecked,9,Sun Jan 25 03:10:38 2015 UTC,Best song on Year Zero is Zero Sum. What an excellent piece of work.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gh2atRW2Qg
nin,2tkb76,ExtraNoise,6,Sun Jan 25 04:00:41 2015 UTC,"I was literally just sitting in my car in my driveway listening to this song with my eyes closed, and I've come to the conclusion that Zero-Sum is the most beautiful song Trent Reznor has ever written."
nin,2tkb76,HCPwny,5,Sun Jan 25 06:41:45 2015 UTC,"Downwards spiral is The Ok Computer. Yes, there are other amazing albums, but we wouldn't be talking about this if they had only recorded Pablo honey"
nin,2tkb76,elg0nz,4,Sun Jan 25 07:44:40 2015 UTC,I think Year Zero is definitely the most creative and exciting NIN album since The Fragile. I wish he had done more albums in this style instead of The Slip and Hesitation Marks.
nin,2tkb76,Airbornefeline_,5,Sun Jan 25 04:36:22 2015 UTC,"I've said this countless times before, but I'll say it again, I prefer Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D to Year Zero.   Please don't hit me."
nin,2tkb76,SteppingSplash,4,Sun Jan 25 12:40:09 2015 UTC,"It's not my favorite album, but it's not at the bottom of my list. See, unlike some fans who felt The Fragile was the quintessential NIN album, it took me a few years of maturing to fully appreciate it. Personally, I like the direction Trent took things with With Teeth, and subsequently Year Zero. When Hesitation Marks came out, I won't lie, I didn't much care for it. But after people kept bringing up the ""return to The Fragile,"" it dawned on me why it didn't do it for me. I've since come to appreciate it - and eventually like it - of course.  So, yeah, sorry for the ramble, but Year Zero is definitely a solid album."
nin,2tkb76,snakepaws,4,Sun Jan 25 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"It's my third fave after The Fragile and The Downward Spiral. My flair's a terrible lie, sorry."
nin,2tkb76,XDDDSOFUNNEH,5,Sun Jan 25 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"Year Zero is amazing. When I first heard it, I immediately thought it gave off a dystopian vibe and i was surprised to learn that's exactly what the album was trying to get at.   While it isn't my favorite album, it's probably my second favorite. The ARG is what impressed me the most and im still in shock as to how well thought out everything was.   I don't know if Trent can ever top the promotion and storyline he put into this album."
nin,2tkb76,jadesaddiction,4,Sun Jan 25 06:33:33 2015 UTC,"I like it so much that I spent 4 and 1/2 years remixing it into an alternative version!

For some odd reason I still remember the order in which I bought the main albums. :D  EDIT: its also sad to see that there are no ""nine inch nails"" remixes since Things Falling Apart. sure YZR had a fan remix (my favorite of that CD. Actually the CD only had 2 good remixes) sad it went that way."

nin,2tkb76,scorpiusdiamond,2,Wed Jan 28 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"I know. I even mentioned it. I meant it like a ""NIN by NIN"" remix type of thing like further down the spiral which had some remixes trent worked on too and the tracks where made by other members or NIN. I didn't like the way Year Zero was pulled of where (with the exception of the fan remix) others were pretty much ""famous"" electro artists."
nin,2tkb76,rd1994,5,Wed Jan 28 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"Year Zero is the closest thing to a ""Perfect Album"" that NIN has ever released. Even TDS has a filler track ""Big Man With A Gun"" on it. I challenge you to find the filler track on Year Zero."
nin,2tkb76,dillholio,3,Sun Jan 25 22:01:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, I've gotta disagree about big man with a gun being filler. From a narrative standpoint it reveals a certain side of the central character that wouldn't come forward as much otherwise. Also, that transition from absolute chaos at the end of the song into A Warm Place...... shudders"
nin,2tkb76,StoneyBill,2,Mon Jan 26 06:05:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, for me there's like six songs in a row that feel filler to me on Year Zero."

nin,2tkb76,_let_the_monkey_go_,2,Sun Jan 25 04:45:44 2015 UTC,"Although not my favourite, I do feel that most fans massively undervalue you it. Its influence on music at the time was huge. Listen to some of the more experimental songs and tell me they don't lead directly to dubstep (which came a couple of years later)! Yes, dubstep had its roots in UK garage and drum & bass, but songs like ""the great destroyer"" take those sounds to an almost (but not quite) new genre.  Plus, it tells a fantastic story! A fantastic album, very different from other NIN stuff, but in a surprisingly good way. It's not every day Trent Reznor decides to make an epic sci-fi concept album with themes reaching from personal feelings through to the end of the world!"

I hadn't really listened to the album, and took him for a fool.  In those 7 years from then to now, I've probably listened to this album front to back at least 300 times.  What does it for me is the atmosphere of the album - its much more consistent front to back than any other NIN album I can think of."
nin,2tkb76,Tr1pkt12,3,Fri Jan 30 01:57:43 2015 UTC,"Halo 24 is one of my favourite albums of all time, depending on my mood Halo 14 or 24 are my favourites of NIN but I honestly think of leaning towards Year Zero most of the time because of my obsession of concept albums especially with dark political content and this one really takes the cake for me."

nin,2t9g43,TheCheshireCody,5,Fri Jan 23 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"First, let me say I like your taste in music. We'd probably be great concert-buddies. Prick, DB's Earthling, VAST are all among my all-time favorite albums. For more Prick excellence, you should be aware that Kevin released a second Prick album (The Wreckard) which is as solid as the first. You likely already know that, but do you know about his other projects, Lucky Pierre, sic, and Fear of Blue? They're available through his website, but you have to email a woman whose email is in the PDF on the main page - the webstore no longer works. I bought the five-disc set which includes the live album, and it's all great although some of it is very different from the Prick ""standard"".  Other albums that are a significant in my life as Pretty Hate Machine, in no particular order:   Skinny Puppy: Rabies Skinny Puppy: Mind- The Perpetual Intercourse The Cult: Sonic Temple The Cult: Love Funkadelic: Maggot Brain Parliament: Mothership Connection <PIG>: Sinsation <PIG>: Wrecked King Crimson: Discipline John Corigliano: The Red Violin soundtrack Sisters Of Mercy: Floodland Sting: The Soul Cages Jethro Tull: A Passion Play U2: Achtung, Baby!

nin,2t9g43,Zaragoza09,3,Thu Jan 22 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Fuck man, Peter Gabriel's 'Us' is the soundtrack of my childhood. My dad listened to it a lot around the time it was released which I was probably 18 months old. For him as a young father, the album got him through some really trying times. Now that I am more of an adult, I understand. I can't listen to half the songs on that album without crying."
nin,2t9g43,TheCheshireCody,2,Thu Jan 22 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"Nice! Yup I'm aware of all of Kevin's work. Somehow I didn't get into the Wreckard when it came out so I've since transferred it to my phone for a rainy day. I was instructed just a couple weeks ago that it is indeed a solid album! Pig, KMFDM, Skinny Puppy, Floyd, Ministry, more favs of mine. Thanks for such a solid list. I'm dumping all the suggestions here into a playlist and I'm going to weed through it to add into my regular rotation! As a (closet) musician I love jazz and classical but find jazz difficult to discover artists in, and classical often hard for me to stay interested in while listening to. If you've got the time I'd love some jazz suggestions!"
nin,2t9g43,Not_Buying,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:54:12 2015 UTC,"Happy to! For instrumental Jazz you won't find a better starting point than Miles Davis' Kind Of Blue. I'm also an enormous John Coltrane fan, but his stuff gets a bit out-there. Giant Steps and Love Supreme are great. For vocal Jazz, Billie Holiday is my absolute fave, but Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone are also absolutely tops in three completely different ways. As an Industrial fan, you might actually appreciate the rawness and emotionality of Nina the most.  For Classical, a good way to approach it is to start with some of the great Classical-influenced film scores - Star Wars, Star Trek, Pirates of the Caribbean, Avatar (I could list dozens, but that's a decent list to start) and then listen to some intense Classical - Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart's Requiem and Mass in C Major - and imagine what the movie might be if that were a film score. Kinda like what Disney's Fantasia did.  The more I think about this list, the more I realize I left out. Peter Murphy's Deep, Jane's Addiction's first two albums, The frickin' Beatles and Doors, Love & Rockets, Bauhaus' entire original catalog. David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (put that at the top of your list, it is one of the greatest albums of all time), Poe's Haunted, Prince's Purple Rain, Talking Heads - well, everything, the scores to 25th Hour by Terence Blanchard, Moon by Clint Mansell, Star Trek II and III by James Horner, Star Trek VI by Cliff Eidelman, Logan's Run by Jerry Goldsmith...."

In addition, Pink Floyd's Wish You Were here provided me a soundtrack for me emerging from the uncertainty of graduating high school, learning to drive, starting college, and getting my driver's licence. These albums provided me with a new (To me) sonic landscape and provided a score while I did these things. The pioneering spirit of Zooropa somewhat reflected what I was going through. Same with the lyrics of Zoo Station, the first track off of Achtung Baby, which Reznor later covered. Wish You Were Here was my soundtrack for the final days of high school for me. Listening to it on loop off of YouTube was what I did. It was the end of an era. 12 years of school done, god knows how much longer to go. I had arrived at the end.

nin,2ta6k2,AboveYou5280,3,Thu Jan 22 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"Not yet as I still need an interface and a good microphone. I have everything else. I could record off of Audacity like I did here on two separate tracks to send to you. However this is a demo, that's supposed to be raw and industrial sounding. When I get more equipment and learn how to master better in my Music Production course I will make certain songs well polished in sound."
nin,2ta6k2,too_long_didn_t_read,2,Thu Jan 22 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"Hey man, just saw/heard your demo. Don't be too discouraged by the feedback. If you are serious about making music you have to accept that it takes practice to get anywhere and practice is a nice way of phrasing a slew of mistakes and output that a later version of yourself will view as inferior. The raw ideas are mostly good in this track, but if you want to really make this sound like NIN, you'll need more layers of background sound. To be industrial you cant just sing with a sad piano background. That's not how any of this works.   I write music too & about a month ago I shared a song I wrote a few years back that was NIN inspired, and got nothing but downvotes and silence in return. I removed the song from my soundcloud and deleted the post as a result. I took the cowards way out. It takes courage to bring your creativity under the critical microscope. Keep writing music, and let criticism teach you, rather than destroy you.   Here is an inspirational, piano based song I wrote, called Moving with Purpose."
nin,2ta6k2,13isaacz1,0,Sat Jan 24 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, personally, I made this a while back and think it's not the best, after all it's my demo, my rawest sound.

The last thing to come in was the Only single today, and it was just so satisfying to have. Not because of the single itself, but because it felt like I finally had a ""complete"" collection in a way. I'm planning on collecting far further, but this just gives me a peace of mind in a way.  Not pictured are several vinyl releases, and a ton of shirts, a signed NIN/QOTSA poster that I've posted here before and a few other posters. I really want a full vinyl collection, but the pricetag on The Fragile is just offensive to my bank account for the time-being.

nin,2t2r0c,funkbum,2,Tue Jan 20 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"On the left is Ghosts I-IV. To the right is Another Version of the Truth, a 3 DVD set. In 2008 NIN filmed one of the final shows on the Lights In the Sky tour with the intent of a blu-ray and DVD release and were even pushing for a 3D theatre showing of it, but Interscope refused to cooperate and allow it. Because of that, Trent and the NIN camp released all the raw pro-shot footage and audio online for free and told fans to do whatever they wanted with it. Well, they did, and it resulted in Another Version of the Truth, with one disc the entire pro-shot concert edited by fans, another disc including the final show of the LITS tour made out of fan footage and a bonus disc full of behind the scenes footage and interviews as well as fan footage of some of the rarer songs and lighting setups from the tour, including the original visuals for The Hand That Feeds that were only used at the first rehearsal show, the Big Come Down visuals where dangling lights were bashed against the band, Reptile during the Latin America tour which had the most unique visuals for it ever, Piggy done without the Ghosts element, and a performance of THTF that had the footage of George Bush morphing into John McCain that was turned down by MTV when they were asked to peform at their award ceremony.  Trent openly endorses it and it has a quote from him calling NIN fans kickass on the box. It's absolutely wonderful and in my opinion a better release than Beside You In Time. There's a blu-ray version of the pro-shot show available (the other stuff isn't because it wouldn't make a difference, as much of the fan-footage is low quality), and I'm planning on ordering it eventually."

It's worth pointing out that while the line I mentioned is not metaphorical, other lines like ""Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! I'm gonna come all over you"" pretty clearly illustrate the comparison between the penis and the gun."

It's not something either of us is ever likely to budge on, but as long as you promise not to shoot me, I promise not to shoot you.  I'm really still trying to figure out why you care what some random person chooses to do with regards to carrying a gun. Since you already carry, and you admit you expect that nobody else is going to come to your aid should you become unable to defend yourself, what does anyone else's decision mean to you?"

I remember one night, in the middle of winter, we smoked a little pot in my nice warm car, turned on the brights while it was snowing hard, and just got stoned and watched that vortex of snow whirl around. Lovely night.  Anyway, what lyric really really gets me is:  *As I descend from Grace  In arms of undertow  I will take my place  In the Great Below*  Her name happened to be Grace. Ugh. That makes it sting so much more. All the lyrics to that song do, but that really drives it home. Or drove, I should say. It's been years and I've moved passed it.

When I was young and stupid and fresh out of high school, I met a nice girl, who I spent a few years with. We both had full time jobs and not a lot of financial responsibilities, meaning money flowed freely towards anything we wanted, including things for each other.  At the same time, I was (and still am) a huge Pet Shop Boys fan. I got her hooked as well, and there was one particular song, called Rent.  It's about not worrying about money, ans spoiling the hell of someone you love, and it fit us so well.  To this day, something like 16 years after she left me, it's still ""our song"" in my mind, and makes me both nostalgic and sad when I hear it."

I didn't hear that song live but when I realised I enjoyed their music I listened to the album ...Like Clockwork the day after.  Halfway through listening to this song for probably the second time the lyrics finally became more audible for me and it fucking hit me so hard I couldn't handle it. I just sat there falling apart. Especially the end.  The whole album helped me recover eventually but it really hurt as well.   I'd mention NIN songs but they hit me more personally than actually remind me of anyone, it was more hitting the whole mass depression state I was in than anything.

The artwork and videos of the man wrapped in bandages presented as being undead is pretty much him. He went into a coma afterward and when he woke up said he couldn't hear the music in his head anymore and was suffering from deep bouts of depression, as well as being physically weak, because I guess dying really takes a lot out of your body.

I'll have to cut this down.  PHM; That's What I Get. It's fairly obvious but has been kind of neutralising whenever a shit relationship was ended, which I tried and seen the possibility of being hurt regardless.  TDS; Piggy. This song is really personal as it played through me for months, really feeling nothing could stop me because after I hit my lowest point and got over someone in which everything about my history between that person was destroyed by others in spite, after that my mind built a denfense mechanism, or to make it more blunt, I grew a pair. Since then my life has had barely anything shit about it.  The Fragile; Even Deeper. When I was going through depression and Social Anxiety Disorder, this song got me, particularly the second verse because there were times I felt I was only having moments of synthetic perfection in my life and everything would sink in even deeper than before.  Non-NIN; Peter Ivers - In Heaven (such by Laurel Near in Eraserhead). This song changes my mood no matter what, although I'm atheist, the song practically sums up bliss in a psychedelic way to me personally. Everything feels like it has stopped except for the song."

nin,2sjxqv,njackso2,6,Thu Jan 15 20:46:22 2015 UTC,Not sure if this is what you are looking for exactly but I've been a NIN fanatic since the first moment I heard PHM in 1989. I just found out last week that Trent appeared in the movie Light of Day as part of a band called The Problems. I'm not sure if that is the name of the band in the movie or real life and I haven't gone back to watch the movie again yet but I was surprised I had never come across this before.
nin,2sjxqv,flimflammed,3,Thu Jan 15 21:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yep. you can see him backup singing in the background for one quick shot, then packing up his gear in another shot.  Option 30 is probably well known by now, but if you're into 80s synthpop, it's a fun one to get.  It's always fun to hear Trent singing Falco's ""Der Kommisar"" and Thompson Twin's ""Lies""  I keep meaning to get Exotic Birds' ""L'oiseau"" album too.  And if you can find his Tapeworm stuff, that's gold there."

Most of the tracks that made the rounds on peer-to-peer file sharing programs were bullshit, but I've heard talk of a couple legit ones.  Here's a fun bit of tapeworm trivia: The song ""Passive,"" by A Perfect Circle was originally written for the Tapeworm project. So there is one song that has made it to release... though not as originally intended.  Its original title was ""Vacant,"" and had slightly different lyrics. I found a live version of ""Vacant"" being performed (presumably by APC) a while back. Not the greatest quality recording , but interesting to hear.

He did get me backstage for a NIN show a few years back, with Street Sweeper Social Club and Jane's Addiction, so I'm not complaining. ;)  We had dinner with Robin and Boots Riley.  Very nice guys.  Hanging out on stage for the shows was amazing.  The energy that was just pouring up onto the stage from the audience when Tom Morello was playing was indescribable.  It was also pretty surreal to walk past dressing rooms for the bands, and passing by one seeing Boots and Tom hanging out with their bands, eating pizza and playing cards... hehe.  Oh, and I should note that Dave Navarro is a really nice guy too.  And Jerome, the stage manager was really amazing to watch in action... all of the backstage crew were amazing to watch...

There was a really crappy rip of it that eventually surfaced, and I later found out that a Shinya Tsukamoto Laserdisc boxed set had the clip in all its glory.   After much hemming and hawing, I paid a lot of money to someone on eBay Japan so I could rip and post this.  The Trent's secret band thing may be an interpretation of what happened when recording Broken. This was being done without permission or knowledge of the record label that he was under contract to, so when they booked studio time, it was booked under false band names. I don't know what any of those false band names were."

There are some pretty deep songs (sonically) I feel if you give them several listens, on flac especially. It's really crisp (if I can use that word) sounding album.   TR and Atticus are at their peak right now in terms of quality of their sound. Especially because they use all these cool sounds I've never heard before in their music.
