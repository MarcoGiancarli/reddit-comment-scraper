metalgearsolid,3e2hgk,Necrojection,78,Tue Jul 21 13:22:49 2015 UTC,I imagine it's a lot easier to disarm a knife when your hand is metal.
metalgearsolid,3e2hgk,vamplosion,13,Tue Jul 21 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd be worried about getting a nice painful slash right across the tender part of my palm."

metalgearsolid,3e2hgk,EarthDragonComatus,4,Tue Jul 21 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"Nah,this is a common disarm in Goju Ryu and Jiu Jitsu. You grab their forearm and twist their wrist until they drop it,then push them backwards.   BB seems to want to catch it while its falling rather than let it fall though,which is where his 360 turning wrist and danger of a slash come in."

It's supposed to be Boss spinning his hand at the wrist, right?  But if you watch his fingers you see that his hand is motionless and the knife kind of floats around on its own.  If that is what's going on, it'll probably be sorted before release - hell, probably fixed already.  Or I might be wrong, and it's just that he strips the knife from Quiet's hand, and the knife is spinning in the air and falling to the ground.

metalgearsolid,3e2658,everydamnnametaken,3,Tue Jul 21 18:34:16 2015 UTC,I am at 92%.  Only missions I have left to S-Rank are the annoying long ones.
metalgearsolid,3e2658,titanhermant,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:13 2015 UTC,"If you look up some videos each mission can be completely fairly quickly. The glaz and palitz one takes under 5 minutes if you grab that sniper. acquiring the Intel just requires you to stay in the back of the truck until you get in the base, grabbing the cassette in the tower, and dropping down to the truck again. Not much you can do about the kojima mission but if you just use the stun pistol and make sure not to hit anyone with the rocket launcher when taking out the tank it's an easy s rank. For deja vu just cut up the right side hitting each event as you go, go back outside for the Jeep after everyone's asleep, then go back inside and crawl to complete it. For jamais vu make sure to knock out the human soldiers and when you're defending the chopper just use the rocket, two guys will come up with rockets you can take out and get additional ammo from"
metalgearsolid,3e2658,Nlz90,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:54 2015 UTC,I'm at 99%. do you have to complete all trials on every level or is it enough to complete just the normal trials(if so i just have one left)?
metalgearsolid,3e2658,ShugoTakahashi,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"The only trial you need to complete for 100% is marking all enemies on Normal (for every mission except the rescue mission). The only other trial-related thing you need to so is unlock every trial, which requires beating every mission on normal once, mark all enemies on normal, then beat hard twice (doesn't matter how well you do, just beat it). You have to do this for every mission.  You'll know if you still have trials to unlock if you go into the trials menu and see any ""???"" trials."

metalgearsolid,3e2658,justeducation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:04 2015 UTC,This is somewhat embarrassing. The first one. I entered the compound stealthily and turned left. Eliminated the guards there then went towards the right side then got spotted and everything went haywire after that.
metalgearsolid,3e2658,NBegovich,2,Tue Jul 21 12:09:54 2015 UTC,"In order to complete it at 100% , you need to acquire all tapes , achieve all missions with S-Rank both in Normal and Hard difficulty (including the Deja-Vu and Jamais-Vu missions) , you have to do a few trials like Fastest Marking of all enemies . For the Ground Zeroes main mission , play it as much times as you can in order to get familiar with enemies locations and search lights for example , once you're ready , go for a no kill no alert run and try to complete the mission as fast as you can . And there are also a few videos on YouTube which can help you by the way ;)"
metalgearsolid,3e2658,justeducation,2,Tue Jul 21 12:19:40 2015 UTC,"I watched several of those YouTube videos and they make it look so easy. When I try to do it, end up getting spotted. Is the right sequence to go left,  clear out the area before attempting to go right side for Chico then drop him off at the starting point before going back for Paz? I had watched so many different videos that I am a little confused now.   How do you approach the first mission?"
metalgearsolid,3e2658,justeducation,3,Tue Jul 21 12:24:52 2015 UTC,"You don't need to go left but there is a prisoner hiding out over there in a shack near the guard tower. If I don't extract him (via helicopter from the start point) I usually just creep around the south perimeter, neutralizing guards until I'm at the eastern prison compound, extract all of those prisoners (carry them over to the cliff cave one by one and them put them all on the chopper at the same time) and then I head up the road into the admin compound. You just have to move carefully, stay low and neutralize everyone you come near. It's hard, but you can get Paz out without being spotted, but you have to think ahead and give yourself a path to either the cliff cave or the entry point at the south cliff. In fact, if you just leave that first prisoner on the southern cliff (forty minutes in the pouring rain will seem like nothing once he's safe inside Mother Base dead in a helicopter crash) you can get Paz back there by sneaking down the west side of the camp and get them both out at the same time, minimizing alerts since the guards will spot Morpho leaving that extraction point since he always flies east, over the camp once he's picked up his target. (Idiot pilot.)    So that's one basic path; the hard part is clearing everyone out as you move along."
metalgearsolid,3e2658,drweavil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:08 2015 UTC,I will try that. Thanks.
metalgearsolid,3e2658,justeducation,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"I usually first go for Paz then for prisoners and finally got Chico . But you can handle this mission the way you want to . For example , you can start the mission by climbing first on the rocks near the search-light then head for Chico , take out the guards with you tranquilizer , request a chopper and evacuate Chico . Then , a truck will be placed near the prison camp , hide in the back of that truck and go rescue Paz"
metalgearsolid,3e2658,NBegovich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:29:40 2015 UTC,What is the easiest approach? I am not going for any achievements or not spotted runs here. I just want to at least complete it once before The Phantom Pain comes out for download.
metalgearsolid,3e2658,R1SENtheSmurf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"(Assuming you're talking about S rank here..)It's not really about how you do it, it's about how you execute it. Rescue all the prisoners, they give sweet extra score. Do not get caught. Do not even trigger a reflex mode. You don't have to be super quick about it, just make sure you do these things."
metalgearsolid,3e2658,R1SENtheSmurf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:45 2015 UTC,I am just trying to complete the mission at any rank currently. The easiest way to complete it. I will think about S rank only after I have done that.
metalgearsolid,3e2658,justeducation,3,Tue Jul 21 13:51:28 2015 UTC,"Just move slowly and tranquilize every poor sucker who gets in your way. Tower guards are easy because you can just pop them and leave them there and nobody will come asking questions. When it comes to extracting Chico, know that if you take a minute to grab the other prisoners and run then over to the eastern extraction point one by one before getting Chico, you can get a ton of extra points very easily. Just take out the two guards down there and keep an eye out for that jeep patrol. If you sprint (click the left stick once while moving) and take the cliffside path (there is a path running just below and alongside the visible cliff edge; taking it will keep you out of sight if the guards, but be aware that there is usually one posted overlooking the extraction point, so tag him, too, and leave his ass out in the rain lol) then it's actually pretty easy. Be sure put them all on the helicopter before you load Chico, since handing him over to Morpho triggers Morpho to leave. That's an easy way to boost your score without wasting a ton of time. Bonus: those prisoners will all show up in Mother Base for you in The Phantom Pain apparently so it's worth grabbing them on at least one playthrough."
metalgearsolid,3e2658,justeducation,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if you just want to complete it, ignore the videos. Make sure reflex mode is on in game options. Mark every guard you can see. Try to tranquilize them. Stay low, crawling or couch walking. Go slowly. From your start point, go to the right side of the watch tower, climb up the cliff to go around the guards. Turn right towards prison camp with Chico in. Move slowly and tranquilize the guard in the second watch tower. Stay low and tranquilize the three guards near Chico. Get him out and extract him via chopper at the nearest landing zone. The game saves when you go near certain areas - don't be afraid to restart a checkpoint.   Exit the prison area by the other entrance, head towards the main building - skirt around the edge of the map. More tranqs. Go inside to the right of the area. Downstairs, take Paz. Go out the opposite side of the compound, and head back to where you started. If you've run out of tranq rounds, the armoury inside the compound has a silenced lethal weapon you can hold in one hand while carrying paz"

metalgearsolid,3dycxw,everydamnnametaken,5,Mon Jul 20 17:54:24 2015 UTC,I was actually just trying Snake Eater emulation.  It's extremely difficult to run at 60fps and a lot of times the game refuses to achieve those frames causing you to literally slow down.
metalgearsolid,3dycxw,Noctis_Fox,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:36 2015 UTC,I had 50 fps for 90% of the gameplay section(seems to be capped on 50)and 20-25 fps on cutscenes which really annoyed me but its just cutscenes
metalgearsolid,3dycxw,khazixtoostronk,6,Mon Jul 20 18:32:36 2015 UTC,50?  PAL version by any chance?  PAL caps at 50 while NTSC caps at 60.

metalgearsolid,3dycxw,Noctis_Fox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:05 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, my CPU is overclocked to 4.4 GHz, so my guess would be that you are CPU limited (as is usually the case with emulators). You may also want to play around with some of the speed hacks in PCSX2 (if you haven't already) to see if they can improve performance. Of course smooth gameplay is what matters the most."

metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,Akasen,42,Tue Jul 21 05:57:30 2015 UTC,"In a way, despite rampant popularity, the man very much despises his fans on some level   I don't feel this is true at all.  Yes, MGS4 (and 2) was confrontational, but it wasn't malicious.  It was far more about 'be careful what you wish for' than it was 'fuck you'.  It was more about 'these are the consequences of not paying attention, of consuming by habit' than it was 'look what you made me do'.  MGS often uses itself as a case study or example of a videogame, and uses videogames as a case study or example of larger ideas about systems.  That's why MGS4 comes across the way it does.  It's provocative, not condemning.   If that is the case, and we truly are looking at the last Metal Gear Solid title from the man, what greater disappointment would there be if not for him to watch once more as his fanbase completely misses his intentions?   That's not entirely true.  It's never going to be the mainstream, but there's a wealth of critical writing and interpretation out there about MGS and there is always more being made."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,flashmedallion,13,Tue Jul 21 06:07:18 2015 UTC,"I've always seen the challenging/confrontational nature of these games as more of a sign of hopeful respect rather than disdain or disappointment. The fact that Kojima would even attempt to tell a story like MGS2, which intentionally frustrates players at every turn in the hopes of leading them to a valuable and unspeakable truth, would be pointless if he did not believe that at least some of the fans of the series would be able to see through their own petty frustrations and take away something deeper from the experience. In an important way, it's much kinder and more respectful of the audience than your typical mindless, cynical, yearly-edition run-n-gun action game cash-grab."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,NakedSnack,7,Tue Jul 21 06:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he doesn't treat his audience like they're stupid, which deserves a lot of credit in a business where I'd say 90 percent of the mainstream does just expect you to buy a game, sit down, play it, turn it off, and not give anything in it a second thought afterwards."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,acethesnake,6,Tue Jul 21 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"i think you're right. i've read terry wolfe's articles myself, and while they're very well written, they do kinda portray kojima in a more malicious light. he may be disappointed when fans miss his intentions, but he doesn't hate them for it. he could've been free from MGS after 4, but he instead decided to come back and make PW and V for the fans of his own volition. i highly doubt he despises his fans at all"
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,cheez124,2,Tue Jul 21 06:33:49 2015 UTC,"That's my issue as well here. Terry paints the intentions of Kojima maliciously, and the only real clue as to why would be the death threats. If the only reason he was working on the project was that, then I'd probably be angry as well.  But I've also heard that Kojima was forced on some level to make 3, and that wasn't malicious.  So if not malicious, maybe it's intention really was to be provocative, to not think or care too deeply about the facts and how they connect."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,asukashikinami,2,Tue Jul 21 06:55:14 2015 UTC,"On that note, here is one analysis of MGS2 I read awhile back that made me appreciate MGS2 more - I was rather disgruntled my first time playing through the game.  Driving Off the Map: A Formal Analysis of Metal Gear Solid 2"
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,flashmedallion,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:52 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of James Howell.  His essay on MGS4 is just as good.
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,KooKluxCocoPuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:08 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,flashmedallion,0,Tue Jul 21 07:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see that as well. My opinion, colored by a probably wrong interpretation of the material I read, still remains though that MGS4 is where Kojima just said ""Whatever"". Not ""Fuck you"" I guess, but just ""I don't care, let's try to please someone somehow"".  Though, I don't think MGS4 was actually meant to be provocative even still. Part of me feels that if there's any nice way of saying it, Kojima wanted the fourth game to be this dirty form of fan service to the players. Dirty in that he is giving them what they want, but dirty in that everything he is touching on is destroying their expectations.  On that last point, I guess what I mean is that Kojima really wanted either everyone to say ""Oh, I understood all of this and appreciate what I played"" rather than ""I don't get it"" or ""I get it, but why?"" or so on. But then, how much critical writing and discussion did he expect? I don't know to be honest. I'm really trying to fathom what he wanted fans to get out of something like 2 and 3."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,flashmedallion,10,Tue Jul 21 06:48:25 2015 UTC,"MGS4 comments on creative stagnation and apathy but that game is meticulously made. I can't play through Act 4,  or even Act 1, and think ""this guy has stopped caring"". Even the widely maligned Act 3 is beautifully crafted and realized despite the fact that most players never even see half of it.  The Rex vs Ray fight, or Solid vs Liquid, or the microwave scene are not the output of an indifferent man.   There is way too much love and emotion buried under the rubble and decayed ruins to say that Kojima hates his fans, or that he's stopped caring. He just wants us to consider the rubble and decay instead of ignoring it in search of treasure."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,acethesnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:33 2015 UTC,"To look at it that way does make it seem far less malicious. But then I ask, what was he feeling? What emotions did he bring into MGS4? If not any particular negativity towards his fans, then what? Could it be some sort of midlife crisis? What do you think Flash?"
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,acethesnake,8,Tue Jul 21 07:24:03 2015 UTC,"I think I've already described it?    I agree that there's a heavy undercurrent of decay and stagnation running throughout MGS4 - thematically, narratively, and emotionally - and that is definitely something of a personal statement from Kojima.  All that stuff will definitely be influenced and informed by his experiences, growing old, that sort of thing.  The conversation in Otacons old lab between him and Snake about getting old are one of the points in the whole series when the thematic ideas come closest to the narrative surface.  I love how they take a moment of respite there to just stop and chat frankly about how close they are to the end; literally and figuratively.  But it feels to me like Kojima uses these emotions and feelings as a launching point to create new art.  He takes the feelings of endless iteration and creative/human decay and then uses the Metal Gear Solid universe to discuss them, through a self-reflexive cascade of examples in a hierachy:   The creative stagnation of the artist forced to produce serial work. The stagnation of a serialized work that cannot definitely end. You have to come up with excuses for new conflict in order to bring the characters back again, which can compromise artistic statements.  This is then expressed narratively with the characters resolution being undone - Raiden is returned to the battlefield and recycled into a new role, Naomi and Vamp come back, Mei Ling shows up etc. The stagnation of the not-too-distant-future of Metal Gear Solid. This 'new game for the sake of keeping the series going and making money' is then used as an example of an economic stagnation and is reflected in the War Economy, where the Patriots create excuses for new wars in order to keep things going.  MSG4 is just the latest excuse/conflict/whatever. The stagnation of economy as a power system We move up another step and the game examines this same stagnation in power structures and how it could apply to our real world.  Despite MGS3 warning us about the danger of relying on the past, it's not the whole picture and we can't blindly march forward into the future.  Unchecked ""progress"" will lead to an endless hollow status-quo.  We need to keep our senses about us when it comes to our habits and routines lest we start doing things for the sake of doing them.   MGS4 uses itself as an example of the nth iteration in a series discuss stagnation.  It sets examples by showing us consequences of stagnation (and by making us experience them) but it's creation itself isn't an example of that - it's a reflection on it."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,acethesnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:58 2015 UTC,This seems very profound to me and something I really never considered throughout the years of contemplating MGS4. I think I really do need to play through the whole of the series again.

metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,tiger66261,3,Tue Jul 21 08:05:21 2015 UTC,"Something like ""...don't obsess over words so much. Find the meaning behind the words, then decide..."" right?  Maybe I should go through a big replay of the franchise then before MGS5. It's been a real long while since I really played any of these games."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,acethesnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:43:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I'm doing a play through of the series too.  Playing MGS1 again, and I still feel like I see things a different way every time I play it, you grow and change as you get older, and the great thing is, the games evolve with you, and the games have endless meanings that you can apply to nearly any conversation in them.  A military veteran might get a completely different meaning out of some scenes than a philosophy major, and they're both right :D"
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,The_Axem_Ranger,9,Tue Jul 21 08:49:38 2015 UTC,"As /u/flashmedallion said, I don't think he hates his fans, I think MGS4 was meant to be an answer to any and every question as a way of saying, this is what you'll get with sequels if you ask for too many, and nano machines were meant to be a disappointment hehe  But I think, instead of hating his fans, he chuckles thinking about all the people who were disappointed with MGS4 after getting what they all thought they wanted, answers to EVERY SINGLE QUESTION IMAGINABLE  Edit: I wish more fans could look past the surface too. Saw a post about MGS2 today that was asking, was Manhattan real, and how did Snake meet Raiden at the end? And I was thinking, does it matter if Manhattan was real or not?"
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,findthepinis,4,Tue Jul 21 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"Well...  Tanker incident. Outside the coast of manhattan. Tanker sunk, Big Shell was built where it sank, Big Shell is front for Arsenal Gear. Arsenal gear crashed into Manhattan.  Snake followed Ocelot, lost him, probably saw Arsenal crashing into Manhattan because, how could he not? Came to find and check on Raiden.  I don't see the confusion about this at all. Almost everything in the series has been explained. I think people just aren't paying attention. Or maybe they're paying too much attention, and they're just nitpicking the hell out of it.  Stop fucking nitpicking!"
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,kyle2086,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:03:47 2015 UTC,"Please. I feel like some apologists rely on the ""You didn't like it? Well that's exactly what Kojima intended, so the joke's on you!"" excuse too much. If I set a building on fire knowing full well what the reaction is going to be, that doesn't exonerate me or push the people who reacted negatively down to a lower level.     he chuckles thinking about all the people who were disappointed with MGS4 after getting what they all thought they wanted, answers to EVERY SINGLE QUESTION IMAGINABLE   I'm pretty sure fans who wanted MGS4 to clean up the canon and explain stuff meant it in a different way. Like a calling for Kojima to change the way he executes storytelling without relying on huge talking exposition after huge talking exposition. Without being overly ambitious and convoluted. MGS4 just took those elements and amped them all up to 11."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,Bsharpmajorgeneral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have to agree or like the stories, but I think, at least with MGS2 and 4, his basic intentions for a lot of the games story were pretty clear. I think when people get into these kinds of talks with MGS3 or PW it becomes more vague, though, and it's more your own interpretation. I just think it was pretty obvious what he was trying to go for in 4."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,scopelessjay,5,Tue Jul 21 17:45:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think any artist or creator has his/her product be received the way they originally intend it to go over. I have no doubt Hideo might have been frustrated or annoyed at points. 2 was supposed to be the end but people kept pushing for more. Even 4 was supposed to have a very different ending. But he keeps doing his best to make games that are unlike any other series I've ever played (Which is why I'm loyal fan). Like any good creator he has a vision and plays it out, and along the way course corrections are made due to problems, revisions, what ever.   I couldn't tell you about Strangelove because I never focused much on PW.   Hideo always likes to spell stuff out at the end of his games incase you missed what's been going on. Talking about the amount of nukes still active today, how building the future and keeping the past alive are one in the same, etc. But to quote Solid Snake from MGS2 and possibly the most important line (To me) ""Don't obsess over words so much. Find the meaning for yourself first and then go from there.""   He realizes everyone is an individual, with their own view on the same situation. Zero and Big Boss. It's why in 4, Big Boss talks about how so many characters in the series fought for their version of Liberty. Liquid, Solid, Solidus, Volgin, Zero, etc. As to say who's right and wrong? Well that's up to you to decide.   Clearly Hideo has an open mind about a lot of things. But in general he's got a very anti war attitude. Even since MSX the point of the game was to avoid conflict not jump in it (Contra). Appreciate each game and come up with your own views."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,Koog330,2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:29 2015 UTC,I like when i have a lot to say but somone says it first. I totally agree with you in everything and we should marry.
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,Clone95,4,Tue Jul 21 13:17:16 2015 UTC,"4 was by far my least favorite mgs game, and hasn't aged as well as sons of liberty, which took me a while to appreciate, but I disagree that kojima just didn't care, I think the pressure of developing for that console combined with delivering something for the fans was just too much for him."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,solidmixer,3,Tue Jul 21 06:02:05 2015 UTC,"Well, we can't be mind-readers or Psycho Mantis, for goodness' sake!  I always thought the fun of Metal Gear in general was making theories and talking about the games with other fans. Nothing too serious, just enjoying a game series with other people. Like my favorite English Lit classes, but with a game series instead of literary canon.  But if he really wanted to say ""Fuck you"" to us, he could have just stopped at MGS 2."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,TadeusPadron,3,Tue Jul 21 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"I find your post absolutely fascinating. It's almost like you're saying Kojima is The Boss and that a lot of fans misunderstand his desired legacy.  However, you'll find across nearly all entertainment media that the most popular works are ones which can be interpreted widely by the people that watch, read or play them.  The Simpsons is a good example: it's a cartoon that kids enjoy, but has a lot of adult points of reference too. And then on yet another level it can be looked at from the point of view of economics and social commentary.  Whatever Kojima's intended themes are in Metal Gear, there's always gonna be people who don't get it. There's gonna be people in the middle who get most of it and are fine with that. Then there's the obsessive fans such as ourselves that can sometimes attribute meaning without there actually being any.  So I disagree. I think there can be as many different interpretations of art as there are members in the 'audience', and when it comes to MGS4 I think Kojima made a sincere but not as well executed effort to respond to the questions his fans had."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,ZillionJape,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. No artist in any field creates a piece to be interpreted ONE way. Everyone knows the themes of Metal Gear Solid - stealth, politics, anti-war messages and trust. Each game has its own splinters branching off from these but the core values stay the same.  Not everyone is going to see the same thing in the games though. For instance, let's say I paint a picture of white flowers over a grave. Some will say the white represents innocence in the face of death. Others will say the flowers represent love lasting after death.  And some will just see flowers on a grave.  Does that give me the right to express frustration with those who appreciate the painting but don't get the message? No. I created it as an expression of myself, not a lesson to others."
metalgearsolid,3e1hf1,aquamah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"See, here's my problem with this analysis - the Author's intent means absolutely nothing in the context of written and displayed fiction. Death to the Authors.   All fictional works are subjective experiences based on the individuals who view them. Kojima can't expect a mass-consumption audience to be obsessed with his artistic themes - because not even the most hardcore fans are.  Themes certainly help drive writing a story - but people come for the prose, not the poetry. I read Game of Thrones for the amazing stories and character drama, not the thematic duality of Ice and Fire, or the parallels to the Wars of the Roses.  These are chaff the writer uses to drive himself to the conclusion, not the actual experience we as gamers feel while playing."

So I find out that it's on Netflix and when I watch it, I see that Kiefer Sutherland's father plays one of the main characters.   What?   Also Kiefer's lines in the game are distorted to sound more like Raiden's cyborg voice.    What?   It's all connected which is kinda freaky.   What?  4 sentences. Your post is 4 sentences, and every single one of those sentences, makes me confused."
metalgearsolid,3e2nyw,LittleRecordings,8,Tue Jul 21 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"i dont see how you are confused, he watched Invasion of Body Snatchers, saw Kiefers father in it, Kiefer has a distorted voice in the game, he made a connections to Ground Zeroes Jamais Vu mission...simple.  Although its pointless, has absolutely nothing to do with MGSV really just some very minor coincidence."

Donald Sutherland is in the movie. And OP didn't say anything about a voice in the movie being distorted, just that Raiden's voice in the game is re-used Kiefer lines distorted."

metalgearsolid,3e1e48,cheez124,2,Tue Jul 21 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"Well, Naked Snake goes out of his way to show up Ocelot by not killing his men in that early Snake Eater cutscene. I think between things like that and the fact that you have to kill as few people as possible to get the best rank, it is implied that Snake does not like to kill. (Well, I think Big Boss doesn't like to kill: Solid Snake was raised differently and for different purposes and we see him fuck a lot of people up in MGS2.)"
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,NBegovich,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"naked snake canonically only had his tranquilizer gun at that point. sure, you can find other weapons during the virtuous mission, but i consider that a case of gameplay and story segregation. they probably put them there to trick players into thinking they were playing the actual story, and not just a prologue. once snake actually canonically gets both an m1911 and a tranquilizer gun in operation snake eater, he's shown using the m1911 in almost every cutscene."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,cheez124,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"Shit, you're right. Still, the fact that he can non-lethally take down like seven supercommandos in a few seconds is pretty impressive. My main argument, however, is that the game's scoring system penalizes kills, not to mention the fact that leaving a body behind does actually go against the idea of a no-traces-left-behind ""sneaking mission"". I think about it this way: if Snake were going on a sneaking mission in which everything didn't go to hell and resulted in him loudly and explosively saving the world, he would be creeping around, making no noise and leaving no bodies. Any guards ""canon"" Snake would come across in that scenario wake up with a serious headache after Snake has already absconded with the plans/weapons/hostages."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,NBegovich,19,Tue Jul 21 17:00:56 2015 UTC,"If you look at something like Peace Walker, the ranking conditions are designed to get you to play the way BB ""historically"" did.  That's what earns Heroism.  We know that BB's legend and his charisma is what drew troops to his army.  We also know that Zero didn't make his plans known to Big Boss until Motherbase was basically at max level, so this development was 'canon' in a sense.  Historically, BB did his missions in Peace Walker with high ""heroism"".  So I think it's a fair assumption that yeah, he was S-Ranking shit all over the place."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,flashmedallion,34,Tue Jul 21 05:40:07 2015 UTC,Big Boss grinded LAV battles. It's canon.
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,A_True_Patriot,2,Tue Jul 21 05:55:38 2015 UTC,"I totally disagree. The idea of a videogame is that you are the character, all of your actions, whatever you did yourself, are canon. Which games you played are your story. You can generate your own narrative around why Big Boss looked at all the gear in Mother Base and chose to take his shirt off and hold a banana. Or why he chose a battle uniform on a sneaking mission and killed everyone. There is no canon, it's an interactive medium."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,Jiko27,11,Tue Jul 21 09:30:31 2015 UTC,"The idea of a videogame is that you are the character   This doesn't apply to every single videogame, nor should it.  There have been dozens of different ways of dealing with this kind of question but MGS is not a Role-Playing-Game in the colloquial sense.  Besides, I just pointed out exactly how MGS motivates you to play the way that Big Boss ""historically"" behaved.  Mechanically the games rules and rewards can be use to support this, along with the fact that that Big Boss's 'story' doesn't advance until you have met certain criteria.  Even if you disregard all of that, 'you' are not the character of Big Boss.  You can't do what you would do, you can't decide to take your army into Costa Rica with you or choose to disband MSF immediately, or whatever.  You are in his shoes - that's a very different thing.  You can only do what is within the bounds of his character."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,flashmedallion,3,Tue Jul 21 09:35:28 2015 UTC,"There's obviously an outline, but Metal Gear goes out of its way to reference player action. If you allow yourself to be pissed on, the game references it. If you punch a hostage, Raiden denies any hostages are harmed. If you use VR, Snake will say he did it on the Discovery. If you play the Tanker Chapter, Raiden will reference it. If you punch Eva, you will be told off. Animal mutilation was condemned until MGS3. The Sorrow's river. The End dying early is a potential method of victory that is talked about. The only way you can say which version is ""Canon"" is which version you prefer -- you're denying your own small lee-ways of story in the games by trying to generate a static narrative that videogames simply don't have.  The open nature of MGSV certainly won't have a ""canon"" method, will it?"
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,Jiko27,3,Tue Jul 21 09:41:46 2015 UTC,"Acknowledging variation in play isn't the same thing as laying down 'canon'.  Besides that, canon is a terrible term to be using here.  None of this is really relevant to the fact that PW encourage you to play in a certain way and doesn't resolve it's scenario until you have.  It uses game design to motivate you into recreating the historical situation as defined in the narrative.    Whether BB fultoned guard A and killed guard B or the other way around isn't relevant, and ultimately the game uses mechanical design to make a thematic point by drawing an association between the interactivity and the narrative.  None of the examples you listed fall under any definition or metric of 'successful play'.  There's no macro-level reward or progression for perving on a hostage.  The game just acknowledge your variation of the character's range of mechanical expression.  The pissing thing is more directly related to the players control over Raiden and his dignity.  Peace Walker does have macro-level progression and this is tied loudly and directly to actions like kills or alerts.  Since this overall system has 'success' conditions and more importantly the story will not progress without sustained effort of meeting these conditions, it's making a mechanical argument that those conditions were causative of the 'historical' outcome.  Big Boss kills The Boss no matter how many ghosts are in The Sorrow's river, but Paz will not hijack ZEKE until it and MSF are complete to Zeros specifications, and that won't happen until you've built them to those specs, and you can't do that without a skilled enough army, and you can't get that army without raising your Heroism, and your Heroism suffers unless you perform optimally according to the system."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,flashmedallion,3,Tue Jul 21 09:55:10 2015 UTC,"Big Boss kills The Boss no matter how many ghosts are in The Sorrow's river, but Paz will not hijack ZEKE until it and MSF are complete to Zeros specifications...   We're saying the same thing, I'm just saying there's no point in discerning what rank Snake got in a mission in canonical context as much as there is a point in discerning how many ghosts were in The Sorrow's river. Your journey is yours.  Within a game's laws there is an optimal method, but heroism can be bought through replaying the AI missions a million times and doing the Wi-Fi soldier recruitments, which would even out an all-kill, no stealth, massacre run. What of your heroism then? What are canon S-ranks in that context? Where is your historical accuracy? The only excuse is that ""That's not the intended method,"" but it still gets the story moving. You can't say anything that is within direct or indirect control of the player can ever be considered canonical, if you're paying attention to a canon at this point."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,Jiko27,2,Tue Jul 21 10:14:43 2015 UTC,"but heroism can be bought through replaying   Most systems can be broken, but a cursory investigation of the design makes its intent clear.    If you're arguing that I can't technically prove the game is designed in a certain way... well that's art for you.    The issue for me is that you're drawing a false equivalence between other games acknowledging variation in behaviour and PW actually motivating and influencing it through it's design.  This motivation and influence is additionally combined with a narrative equivalent to paint a picture of a character, not a picture of you through an avatar."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,flashmedallion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:30:54 2015 UTC,"I accept the intended path is the one where you replay all missions until you S-rank, and that you should never just shoot your way through, but what I'm saying is that if that's what you did, that's your idea of Snake. Those guys who play the game with torches and monkey masks, that's their idea of snake. Snake is mostly characterless other than the story intent so that you can project yourself into his shoes, and your role playing (not an RPG, just accepting the role of Snake) generates an idea of Snake.  Shadow of the Colossus is a good game to prove the concept, with its skeletal story. In your role as wander, you generate a story in your own head based on his actions under your hands. And that story can be completely dependent on how the player feels.  To deny agency by drawing arbitrary canon lines is to deny the player in games already cutscene heavy."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,Jiko27,6,Tue Jul 21 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"Well Naked Snake fucked up the Virtuous Mission pretty hard, doubt he got S rank for that."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,TheJackFroster,5,Tue Jul 21 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of this plays on the player and what he or she would want to happen.  I personally don't enjoy the speedruns because I think they're unrealistic....  Like how the hell does big boss know where all the guards are?  I personally try to go for no kills, no alerts and I try to make it as believable as possible for my standards.  This usually leaves me with a couple c's a couples S's and a bunch of A's and to me that's quite fitting."

metalgearsolid,3e1e48,CptLande,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:19 2015 UTC,I think S-Ranking every mission is more likely than the Big Boss rankings of the previous games. How could Solid Snake or Big Boss complete their missions in under five hours when they spend five hours talking every game? How Kojima? HOW?!
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,Gerry-Mandarin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"I have this theory that yes, Snake always attains at least a Snake rating in every mission (but more likely Big Boss or FOXHOUND considering that's what it would take to kill Big Boss or The Boss or Solidus or Liquid). Snake to me is always the game's secret boss character. You have all of these guys who can do insane shit like move things with their minds or blow your knees off from half a mile away, and then there's this bigger, badder motherfucker who kills them one by one. To them, to all of the your enemies in these games, Snake appears to pop up completely out of nowhere and then choose not to kill most of the people he encounters. He is absolutely unstoppable. He is a boss character. If he's Naked Snake, he's the Big Boss.    By including the ranking system, Kojima is encouraging us to continue playing until we've mastered the game, thus becoming the protagonist. In order for Snake to do any of the things we see him do in cutscenes, be has to be the kind of person who can get through the mission in a timely fashion, without getting shot, without being seen and, to top it all off, not killing anyone (he has respect for other soldiers). This makes sense to me as a kind of storytelling via game mechanics: once you've earned that Big Boss, ranking, all of the insane shit you see Snake do in the cutscenes feels like something the player could do since the player just handed the game its own ass. That's why Snake is a legend."

metalgearsolid,3e1e48,NBegovich,3,Tue Jul 21 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"Well, since BB didn't know he was going to get his shit wrecked, killing any of the marines and rescuing Chico would lead the US govt right to him. Really, it's a pretty bad idea to free Chico in the first place, but since Skull Face was behind it, I can see BB getting away with it."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,HinkMyDinkD00d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"I think for the Assassin's Creed games, since most of the exploits of the main characters have historically happened, they do instill the play style that was most similar to how it ""actually"" happened by means of a synchronization rating. This started in AC: Brotherhood I believe, and I hated it. Yes, you can play however you want, but at the end of a mission its tell you how many tasks you fulfilled correctly and it is somewhat punishing when giant X show up telling you you didn't do it right because you killed a target with a poison dart as opposed to an air assassination."
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,Snakedotes,0,Tue Jul 21 17:34:48 2015 UTC,there should be a rank for ghost runs   obtaining S rank in GZ is quite easy (a lot of prisoners)
metalgearsolid,3e1e48,Damnfiddles,4,Tue Jul 21 08:11:50 2015 UTC,I think that's part of the 'beauty' of the point system: it rewards you for different play styles. It doesn't confine you into playing a certain way. Now you can get S ranks even with kills.

For example, the JPN version comes with different stuff, so I think those codes might be region locked, but the rest of the world is getting the same exact CE, so why would they region lock codes that do the same thing from box to box, sounds like a lot of work.  Also, an easy work around is you can create a PSN account for whatever region you bought the game from and the content will be unlocked for every account in your PS4. But I don't believe this will be an issue."

metalgearsolid,3dz06q,SirSaif,3,Tue Jul 21 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine an open world game without BB's motorcycles. To the uninitiated, the motorcycles used in the Metal Gear series may seem generic. However, time and again Kojima has given Big Boss and company VERY tasteful bikes to ride;  Ural M-72, ridden by EVA in MGS3. is a Russian clone of German BMW airheads. which are beloved worldwide. Ural is generally known for their sidecar configured motorcycles (and quite honestly, shoddy build quality despite their prestigious ancestry).  Triumph Bonneville T100: My god. EVA rode it in MGS3 towards the end, Big Boss rides one in Peace Walker, again in MGSV, and EVA rides it yet again in MGS4. This bike is legendary. Triumph has had a rich history spanning over a century, with the Bonnies right at the forefront of it all. I loved seeing it crop up all over this series, and the one off custom Venom that Triumph produced to promote MGSV was absolutely gorgeous.  Triumph Speed Triples also appeared in MGS4, again during the same motorcycle chase scene you see EVA riding the Bonneville in.  Then Revengeance came along. And put Raiden on a god damn Harley. Why Platinum, why. Why the hell would you do this?  That transgression aside, I'd love to see more classic bikes in there, Norton, BSA, or Triumph. Hell in 1981 we saw the Japanese coming off the peak of the UJM trend, which gave it the classic greats such as the Honda CB750, Yamaha SR400/500, XT, XS, and Suzuki's GS series."

metalgearsolid,3e3mqy,Mr-Atherton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"Porting consumes lots of time and resources, saying it's ""easy money"" isn't quite on the mark.  Given that they've already released the HD Collection and Legacy Collection, sales for a new compilation couldn't be all that great, could they?  In particular, porting MGS4 to either PS4 or Xbone would be a significant challenge.  Even in the currently available collections, MGS1 isn't available as a native PS3 app, but as a straight PS1 disc or download.  Don't get me wrong, I think it would be amazing to be able to play the entire MGS saga natively on the PS4, it's just not very likely to happen any time soon."
metalgearsolid,3e3mqy,zer0vital,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"It probably won't happen, but it is possible. People always cite the Cell processor as the reason MGS4 was never ported out of PS3, but in reality Kojima himself has said that MGS4 was never ported because it's a huge game that requires a BD, which like you said Xbox One now has. It really wouldn't be that big of a financial drain either, since they could simply employ third parties to do most of the legwork just like they already did with HD Collection.  To me, the biggest problem is still MGS1. It technically never left the PSX/PC. It's only technically even a part of Legacy Collection. That game really needs to be ported over to something else already or at the very least run in a new emulator outside of the PSOne Classics, so it can be put on Xbox consoles.  I would really like to see MGS4 in 1080p/60. Did you know that it actually runs at 1024x768 stretched? It's never been an actual HD game."

Also, while I'm happy to suspend my disbelief, I thought it was strange for Kojima to go all-in on the Fulton mechanic without ever explaining how that would work with helicopters. It just makes sense from a few different angles to include at least one cargo plane as an asset for Big Boss' mercenary force, and I agree with you 100%.

And I stopped exactly for that reason, since at some point I ended up in that spiral of ""this is shit, I need t redo this"", and that spiraled out of controlled and resulted in me eventually going ""nothing I do is good enough, fuck it!"". Looking back at it, it was not a smart move.  So, dont be me!

metalgearsolid,3e0stl,TheTripleH,4,Tue Jul 21 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"---------UPDATE----------  Alright boys.  Opening: As mentioned, we have a little bit of info to share on MGO tonight, many of you have had questions about the gear customization........ The game allows players to access different gear types, and one nice feature is the ability to change color, or even patterns on most gear.....  To demonstrate this, here is a shot of two identical pieces of gear, modified in color and pattern .....  http://i.imgur.com/C3WEfYV.jpg   On launch there should be plenty of ways for players to modify their gear and take on a unique persona on the battlefield  Q: question is though, what if I want a different shirt or jacket to go with that, can I do it? Or are they all presets...  A: they are not all presets, no  Q: can camo patterns and weapons/equipment be colored as well?  A: patterns cannot be customized by themselves, but there are a variety of examples to choose from  Q:this is stupid, but MGO3 is coming on last gen too right? i still don't have a ps4 lol  A: Yes.  Q: ** So there will be different categories to choose per se like mgo 2? Head, upper body, lower body, hands, feet, waist etc.?**  A:there will be different categories, but not the same ones  Q: Will MGO3 have classes?  A: Yes  Q:It will be possible to transfer my saved data (multi-player data included ) from PS3 <>PS4 ?  A: No, it is not possible.  Q:THIS, IS IT IN THE GAYME?? --Picture of a Frog--  A: No, MGS4 gear is not in the game.   Q:Can we mix and match gear/clothes or are some things exclusive to certain classes?  A: Some gear options are class specific  Q:can the gloves and shoes be changed, or do you have to keep this overall look of your class.  A:different parts of the outfit can be changed, gear can be minimized or maximized within classes but each one has a look  Q:Will we even be able to headshot the players wearing those Juggernaut outfits with metal helmets?  A: Yes, though it'll be hard  Q:will we be able to use stuff we unlock in single player or will everything be locked behind XP grinding...... cause if weapons, weapon parts are locked behind XP walls then XP boosts give you an unfair advantage... If just cosmetics, eh whatever....  A: It can be fun to gear up in different ways Vague, which worries me.... Single player does not unlock gear.  Q: Are there only plain colors, or more bright and vibrant colors/patterns?  A: Yes, a few dozen or more.  Q:is there's any realistic gear in mgo3 ? because the gear we saw in the trailer because looked more sci-fi .  A:there is gear similar to the soldiers in game and MGO unique pieces as well  Q: Will we be able to change between our saved outfits\loadouts in-game or will we have to wait until a pre-game screen?  A: In-game yes, during matches no. (???)  Q: What button on the Dualshock 4 brings up the command list for buddies, regarding Snake?  A: L1  Q: also im pretty sure you cant answer this but... will there be open world online (at least for two players?)  A: no, there is no open world online coop  TL;DR This Q&A mainly answered questions regarding cosmetic options during online play, with some misc. questions as well.   There are a variety of clothing and gear options one could choose to customize/wear in MGO3   *There are classes, with some gear being tied to specific classes.  *Can color/pattern each piece of equipment with any pattern  *Said patterns are limited; however; you can't create your own.  *There are a 'few dozen' patterns.  *MGO3 is coming to last gen systems  *NO save data transfer between PS3/4 and Xbox360/One.  *NO open world Co-op/Online  *MGO3 has MGO3 specific equipment/gear  *L1 on the PS4 controller to command buddies in game  *Single Player does not progress/unlock things in multiplayer. However, microtransactions aren't denied.  *Change saved outfits/loadouts in game, but not during matches (??)  And that's it. A short Q&A, but still nice eh?"

Also the new costume you got, coupled with the atmosphere made it feel like I was an old under cover cop.

I enjoyed the game for sure, but it wasn't as ahead of the rest of the gaming industry like the other Metal Gears are.  And as far as people bashing MGS4... when you are actually playing the game, I think they have some of the best gameplay segments in the franchise. The shooting and movement just feel so damn good, and Octocamo... oh god I love that shit. It's so good man. Seriously, if MGS4 had more traditional facility infiltration type gameplay segments and had bosses with slightly more or less backstory (no backstory = elite enemies, more backstory = interesting boss characters, but the ground they found themselves in was that awkward middle where their stories aren't deep enough to be interesting but still gets in the way).  Off-topic, I only wish that the MGSV tranq pistol was as awesome as the MGS4 tranq pistol. No bullet drop, a balanced fire-rate, a laser sight, and good iron sights made it such a high quality main weapon for doing Big Boss emblem run. Getting S-rank in MGSV: GZ is kind of a pain in the ass comparatively speaking - I guess the nerfed tranq pistol makes holding up enemies and CQC a bit more relevant, but its still kind of a crappy situation to be in since it is harder to close the distance without Octocamo."

The sneaking missions were too short and the Boss fights lackluster (in comparison).  In Peace Walker the missions broke everything up too fine and every tank/armored vehicle fights made me want to quit.  In 4 the traditional sneaking only happened in the beginning, which would be  fine if the rest of the game made up for it. Some of the added material was great (see piloting the Metal Gear), others not so much (see the entirety of Eastern Europe).

Several sections that are just endless waves of enemies.  Cutscenes doing all of the explaining compared to codecs while exploring.  Non-special bosses, in my opinion.  An ending that feels wrong, in my opinion.  Too many action scenes that unlike the other games have no place in this one.  A lack of big and adventurous stages. Outer Haven was a dissapointment in size. Shadow Moses had too many areas cut off.  An overall forced feel, in my opinion.  Still a great game. It is just lacking in the MGS style."

I loved every second, and really couldn't ask for a better ending. My biggest complaint would be the underplayed codec but it's nitpicky. The variety of weapons/items and replayability of Acts 1 and 2 are huge pluses. The plot did a great job at bringing in elements from its predecessors. Mechanics wise, I can't think of a single technical flaw (other than I wish I could listen to ipod AND use solid eye lol). I can't say that about any other game ever, really.  It seems like every entry in the series sans the first has been described as ""not feeling like MGS."" They each seem to focus on various aspects of the stealth genre fans may either like or dislike."
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,Map42892,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:50 2015 UTC,I agree with all your points.   Can i also add that the new characters fucking suck.   The cutscenes are terrible. I loved the long scenes of past MGS games. But the scene where you first meet Drebin is an example of how shit 4 was. Nothing happened and the scene didnt need to be as long as it was.   Also shoehorning every character into the lore of the series. Sigint being the Darpa chief...what a pointless call.
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,LIFTSHIT,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:59 2015 UTC,"In terms of gameplay: MGS3 (I still love it, but I always found its gameplay the clunkiest in the series). In terms of story.... I really don't know, I guess Ground Zeroes if that counts? Nah it probably doesn't, I love all the stories."
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,WindowsApples,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"(I still love it, but I always found its gameplay the clunkiest in the series).    Yeah... no solton in a game with a locked camera in the original version, then tack on the survival viewer with all it's nonsense such as needing to eat, patch yourself up, etc? Yeah, I can dig this comment. Great game, but definitely the clunkiest. At least the game got an improved camera after-the-fact in re-releases though."

metalgearsolid,3e05w8,TadeusPadron,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:02 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Peace Walker  Reason:  Most content.  Amazing story.  Build a Metal Gear.  So many missions.      Least Favorite: Guns of the Patriots  Reasons:  Nanumusheens.  Raiden's garbage transformation.  Minimal gameplay.  Unlimited P-90's, without a bandana!  Worst boss fights out of all the canon and non-canon games.  Act 3 (ResidentSleeper).  The game was fan-service and nothing more."
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,Noctis_Fox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:50:06 2015 UTC,I believe you are confusing filler for content. Content has substance.
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,protocultured,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:38 2015 UTC,I would hardly call it filler.  Fun missions that help add your R&D and Mother Base?
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,Noctis_Fox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Filler is exactly what motherbase was.. I've commented on it elsewhere in thread if you care to check my reasoning, otherwise, we'll have to accept that our definitions of fun are a bit different in the context of MG."
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,protocultured,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Peace Walker. I'm constantly getting slammed for hating on PW in this sub, but I'm incapable of enjoying it in the same way everyone else seems to be able to.  Firstly, let me state that I think as a portable Metal Gear title I don't mind it. The portable games have traditionally been non-canon, and experiment with different gameplay styles and storytelling elements, however for some reason PW ended up being included as a core title and has largely influenced the development of TPP.  The story was lazy, the characters lack personality, the boss fights were two dimensional, the art work in the 'cut scenes' is uninspired, and the mechanics are frustrating and arcadey.  I hate fulton recovery and motherbase. I get crushed under downvotes for publicly criticising these elements but I genuinely think they add nothing to the core franchise. I can respect peoples enjoyment of arcadey catch'em'all mechanics, and the completionist base building, but not in a core title of a series that is trying to merge cinema and gameplay to immerse the player in a complex story.  Everything about the aesthetic and mechanical design of PW seems to be to accommodate the limitations of Sony's portable hardware, which is fine, but people ate it up so badly that now these elements are being carried into the larger scale games and it takes the series to a place that seems to value these arcade style elements over the greater narrative experience."
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,protocultured,2,Tue Jul 21 06:10:01 2015 UTC,I agree - I also receive down votes for saying the same.
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,CylonSurfer,0,Tue Jul 21 10:45:18 2015 UTC,"arcadey   You know this is Metal Gear, right?"
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,PerfectlyHonest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:10:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I know what series this is thanks. You don't consider it arcade style gameplay when the focus shifts away from a single advancing mission to a series of disjointed stages, barely tethered together by a story, punctuated by vehicle and AI battles? Can you even remember fighting a human being that wasn't a masked goon in PW? I sure can't.  Fillerbase and balloon kidnap simulator exist solely to pad the game out. You are essentially filling out a spreadsheet with values to fufill some arbitrary completionist nightmare. You are forced to replay missions over and over to get better ranks and unlock unnecessary junk gear with % chances to unlock things, like drops in an MMO to further pad the amount of overall playtime and distract you from the fact that there was no actual story or worthwhile characters. Don't get me started on the 'true' ending. The whole motherbase concept doesn't even make sense.. You kidnap and indoctrinate an entire army by attaching balloons to them and steal them away to some oil rig, where you somehow casually talk them into giving up their lives to serve in your balaclava clad death machine?  I find it really hard to like PW as a Metal Gear game. I think it would have stood up better as a first entry in a new series. Some sort of robot fighting, balloon kidnapping, 100% success rate brain washing, army sim game.  Again, to clarify, despite all the hate I'm slinging, it holds up as a portable Metal Gear game. I just wish it hadn't been a core title, or that its lazy design elements hadn't infected TPP."

I fell in love with mgs the first time I heard the colonel tell you that the codec stimulates the small bones in your ear.  It's still a fantastic game, but it just clicked with me a little less than the others.  It introduced the weird deterioration of suppressors, gadgets having battery life, and the villain is just a tall sadist..."
metalgearsolid,3e05w8,LordHoagie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:59 2015 UTC,"Either PW or the original MGS, probably PW for the constant tank battles and drawn cutscenes. Still enjoyed base building though.  I think years from now MGS4 will be more revered than it is now. IMO it really deserves being the second most critically acclaimed of the series; technically, it does everything right.  Mark my words: many fans will be disappointed by MGSV. These games are notorious for turning expectations around completely, and people will inevitably say that it doesn't ""feel"" like MGS; even though every numbered game played more smoothly than the one before it. It's happened every time."

If Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake was the best that era had to offer, even though it had some old school game mechanics, it still already took steps into the right direction  Metal Gear 1 though is everything I hate about old-school gaming, ie ""figure out that you have to punch  a random wall, in order for it fall apart"":  Playing MG1, always reminds me, that with all the modern day problems of handholding the player, at the same time, at least most of it is intuitive, and aspects such as level design, points of interest and attention are taken much more seriously and are carefully considered.

I don't like the manga cutscenes, the missions were too short and the AI bosses were ridiculous, even for Metal Gear. Every boss fight was:   Shoot until you run out of ammo Call for a supply drop Repeat   The vibe of the game was just too happy as well. I like the grittiness of GZ."

Lack of crawling killed me, but it was still a great game and I got addicted to it a few weeks ago and beat it. Also lack of motion captured cutscenes bothered me, not saying they were bad, they looked really good, but I probably had a closer connection with all the characters if I could see how they moved and stuff (ex. I hated Volgin in MGS3 because I got to see how he acted towards everyone, while Strangelove and Colman felt overly generic)"
