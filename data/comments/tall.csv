tall,3e2mo6,Flyingflamethrower,6,Tue Jul 21 17:46:37 2015 UTC,Yes! I was taking a couple's engagement photos a while back and he asked why I was dragging a step ladder around; angle of the photo is everything. I was really lucky and the future bride was about 6ft to his 6'4 so it wasn't a huge height difference to work around for pictures.   I'm in a wedding in November and the bridesmaid I'm paired with (because there are more bridesmaids than groomsmen) is 4'11... I don't envy the wedding photographer.

For the longest time I thought that what I was seeing in my mirror was some kind of delusion because I look so different. I finally realized its because pictures were being taken of me from the absolute worst angle to take a picture of someone at which is a low angle.

Telling someone your actual height when almost everyone on the shorter half of the curve fudges their height makes you seem even shorter than you actually are.

Specifically, even though she was thin she was still about 170 lbs, it wasn't easy holding up that much woman against the wall, although that's not something that's an issue because of her leg length. There were some positions that were hard to pull off because of her legs, but overall I felt they were a non-issue.

What that means is different for each person.  Sure, if a guy is a boob man and it's clear that he has a one track mind and while he's talking to the girl he's just staring at her chest, at some point the desire for that one trait becomes so strong it's off-putting. But I think many, many, MANY people have strong physical likes and both sides realize this.  It would seem that after dating Kim Kardashian and then marrying another Armenian woman, Reggie Bush has a thing for Armenian women. Should Lilit be upset that she's a Kim K. replacement, so to speak? At the end of the day, if someone is making you happy I don't see the issue that, for example, some guys like blondes."

Us tall women aren't entitled to have a tall partner and tall guys owe us no obligation to only date us. You're a tall guy with a thing for short girls? Good for you, I hope you find a nice girl who treats you well and you treat well in return.

I also just cannot understand how people can function as a couple with huge height differences like that.

I never singled him out because he was tall.  I did, however, single him out because he has great hair.

tall,3dwimi,GrandBuba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"Being tall is definitely not inferior genetic material for either men or women. If you even have a daughter, her expected height is going to be less than yours due to mean reversion, but it's still going to be above average.  Considering height tends to be related with salary and so on, at least for most heights, I'd say it's superior genetic material. Maybe you're too tall to get to enjoy this effect (the studies don't examine very unusual heights), but at least your children will with high probability benefit a lot. As long as society keeps ""rewarding"" being above average height that is. Maybe sounds a bit callous but you're the one who brought up genetic material."

Taller men for women will always be appealing (its human nature unfortunately), and unfortunately for taller women, that is not the same, and combine that with not actually giving a guy that may be shorter significantly reduces the chance of actually finding that person.

A wild guess might be that since tall people have been shown in media to get paid more, be successful, etc, maybe that puts pressure on kids (and influences other's perception of them) to be better than average. Since height doesn't mean that you're actually better or smarter, maybe young tall kids don't feel like they're meeting society's expectations, leading to insecurity.   Like I said, that's a wild guess without knowing if tall people tend to be shy.   Edit: http://www.psychcentral.com/library/shyness.htm says that 40% say they're shy, so it may be common enough that there really isn't a correlation."

He was relying on a cane to stand and I was terrified that I would end up like that I still see him in my sleep. Today I am getting heavier 230 lb and have a bad back from acting like a teenager for 35 years. This old tall man haunts me in my dreams.

tall,3dxb7v,underthebug,5,Mon Jul 20 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"My grandfather was born in 1912, he made it to 97 and he was 6'6 for most of that time. After 90 he became a bit more hunched and got slightly gaunt, he stopped taking as much care of himself after his wife died (he was about 90 then). He didn't move fast, but he still walked himself to the shops to pick up the odd thing, like a tortoise he just kept on going. He didn't look quite so tall, but that's because he spent most of his day sat in a chair and napping. When he was finally admitted to hospital for an infection, the nurses had a hell of a job moving him, they didn't realise his true size and he was still a strong man. He never used a cane and never had a fall. There was a time when I thought that man would live forever.  No age is too old to get a bit more active, and it's especially important for us talls.

Rides i should note Disneyland,ca  big thunder mountain railroad do not sit on the right side of the ride had my hair graze the side of the clift.unless you want to play catus bowling with your head of course.the scream at six flags,ca went on the ride and after take off i realize my feet could touch the track.Luckeyly i picked the seat with the rubber bumper in front  or else most likely might have lost something.p.s not due to height but if you ever get stuck on its a smallworld afterall and they tell you to stay inside  the boat because the water is made out of foam do your self a favor and jump out anyways you couldnt even imagine being stuck in the dark with a bunch of dolls with glowing eyes singing its a small world while turning their heads."

Usually until the end of that season.  It's like getting a car. A 10 day contract is like taking the car on a test drive, the dealer letting you take the car home for a day or two if you're a serious buyer is like signing the player from a 10 day to one that lasts until the end of a season, and buying the car is like signing a multi year contract.

For us, we have gone from having a choice of a barely fit-able seat and an exit row, to the present choice of a completely un-fitable seat and a $60 stretch seat.

tall,3dtq91,Tall_and_Ugly,4,Sun Jul 19 10:59:46 2015 UTC,"Nobody here can tell you how tall you are going to be, because all of us grew differently. Some had growth spurs some grew steadily. I was always among taller kids but was not the tallest until your age. Then I had a growth spurt (stretchmarks since 13, woo-hoo) and didn't grow that much after. Granted I always knew I was going to be tall, so I didn't pay much attention to my actual height.  As far as the rest goes, I haven't met a 13 year old girl that is not worried about her looks (sad, but true). And I know exactly how you feel - most tall women do. All I can tell you is that you should not focus on the things you can't change, don't compare yourself to your sister - instead look at all the tall women who are rocking their height (there is quite a few on this subreddit) and if you have to look up to someone look up to those kind of women. There is a few interesting thing about being tall - you can wear a lot of patterns and colorful clothes because you have the height for it, guys will have to see you because you simply stand out (you don't have to do any stupid stuff to grab their attention), the view at concerts is better and helping people reach stuff is actually satisfying.   As far as men go, I always looked at it this way - I don't need hundreds of man thinking me beautiful, in the end all you need is one. And there are quite few of them who like tall girls. And there are even more guys who in the end don't even care about girl's height.  Being comfortable in your body and loving yourself is not an easy or quick journey, but it is worth it. Just try to straighten your shoulders, look in the mirror and say sth nice to yourself. Good luck :D"
tall,3dtq91,vanwe_rana,3,Sun Jul 19 12:26:21 2015 UTC,Girls typically stop growing two years after they start their periods. No one anywhere will be able to tell you at what rate you'll grow during that time though. Just wait and see what genetic cards you were dealt.

tall,3dle2k,IAmTheWalkingDead,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"You see a hot girl in public, what are you supposed to do, just walk up and say 'hi ur hot'? Total creep move.   Well, realistically, you could open with something more tame like ""Hello"" and introduce yourself or ask her if it's her first time seeing the band or something. You don't necessarily need to hit on her or have a cheesy pick up line or comment about her looks right off the bat.  But you kind-of have a point about ""total creep move"" in a way. It largely plays into the two rules: #1 Be attractive; #2 Don't be unattractive. I'm not saying it's a hard rule, but if, say, you're Jon Hamm, you can probably approach a woman and tell her she looks great and there's a really really good chance she will be receptive of that because you look like Jon Hamm - though there will be women put off by the boldness of that move or the focus on appearances or maybe they're more into Benedict Cumberbatch or Chris Hemsworth or Brad Pitt types instead of Jon Hamm. Likewise, if you're a 500 lbs. Shrek looking ogre, then chances are saying the exact same thing Jon Hamm said in the above example has a really good chance of getting you labeled as a creep, though there is the off chance some women will respect the compliment or admire your confidence despite your looks or actually be into your looks.  So in the end, if she finds you attractive, she probably won't have a problem with you approaching her provided you don't turn it into a creepy interaction. If she finds you unattractive... good luck with that."
tall,3dle2k,CaptnYossarian,3,Fri Jul 17 16:32:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but this is for the 99% who don't look like Jon Hamm. Cold approaching is seen as creepy. They instantly suspect your motives. Schrödingers Rapist, etc."

tall,3dlumq,talldane1,2,Fri Jul 17 12:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that's the case for most really tall people, since pretty much everyone is shorter than them, and for most short people, for the same reasons (everybody is taller). It's standard for us..  But for a lot of average people, being confronted with a 'big man' will trigger the 'this guy knows what he is doing' reflex, and they'll defer more easily. They see a short guy in a suit, and they'll ask for the manager nonetheless..  For some, that's a really shitty thing, if they don't like to be put in that situation (not everyone IS a leader..).  For others, who are born leaders (but short), it's another hurdle to take.."
tall,3dlumq,GrandBuba,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"I see how it can be good thing, but I can't figure out how to make it work when I'm in a job that isn't a leadership role, and I have a lot of work that I'm expected to get done, but I end up being the one who deals with a lot of the random needs that people have. It's at least partly because my personality leads me to help people when they ask. But the default placement of authority on me as a tall person is also a big part of it. And those two things feed into each other."

tall,3dkrkj,lastplaceSal,2,Fri Jul 17 04:18:01 2015 UTC,"I have a few strategies for this. One is I'll buy shirts with sleeves that are too short but otherwise fit and then roll up the sleeves. For me I can find shirts with sleeves long enough but too big in the torso so I take them to a tailor and get them taken in for about $12 a shirt. It costs a bit but it's worth it. I used to buy cheap shirts that didn't fit, but I find it much better to spend more on each shirt and buy less of them. You're better off wearing the same shirt every day if it fits right rather than having 5 different shirts that don't fit.   jcrew and Banana Republic have tall sizes."

Also, the armrests are longer, so you have a comfortable place for your left arm, instead of a B-pillar.

Probably worth checking that the trim level includes height and reach adjustable steering wheel. That seems to make all the difference.   If they're too big, I looked at a Clio Mk3 (2005–2014) too, plenty of room in there. Again lifting and pulling out the steering wheel helps.   If you're after super cheap, I drove a 1.0 Micra K11 (1992-1997) in surprising comfort for a few years. The base 'L' model has no extras inside and super skinny doors so there's loads of room.  Last of all, the other half currently drives a Nissan Note. Not great in the front (high roof with low windscreen), but crazy legroom in the back if you carry passengers regularly.  HTH"

I know I just need to make up the calories I couldn't easy when I get these episodes, you know calories in vs calories out, but its hard to makeup a day or two worth of them.

tall,3dedgu,backup_username,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"You know, you're right about those kind of comments about people needing to gain weight. I think there's intended to be a difference between ""Hey you should have a cheeseburger dude!"" and ""You're anorexic"" but the message is the same either way and it's shitty.  For whatever it's worth, I will always remember you for your outstanding Black Widow cosplay pictures you posted a while back and I thought you not only nailed it but looked absolutely stunning while doing so. I would not have guessed your weight to be what you're suggesting in your above post (frankly I wouldn't have guessed your weight at all because that's a shitty thing to do) but from those pictures and others I remember you posting, anorexic is not a word that comes to mind.  Weight can be really tricky because of how people carry it and their frames and everything, like for me - I'm five inches shorter than OP and still cutting, I don't know exactly where I'm going to land at in terms of weight because I'm more concerned about body comp but I'd wager I'm going to have 75 pounds on him at a minimum when I hit that 15% BF mark I'm gunning for because that's what my frame is going to require.

tall,3dedgu,Mediddly,0,Thu Jul 16 00:51:28 2015 UTC,"So I've put a lot of thought into this and I think the dangers of being underweight are overstated. As long as he has a healthy relationship with food, a balanced diet, a healthy body image, and his weight doesn't interfere with him doing what he wants to do, what's the problem? If his body fat were the same but you added 50lbs of muscle, no one would think twice about his health but all that would change would that he'd be stronger (which, granted, has some indirect benefits but isn't necessary for general health). The only actual health risk I can think of is that he'd be less equipped to handle a major illness or injury that interfered with his appetite because he has fewer fat stores to pull from.   If I'm missing something, let me know, because as far as I can tell this insistence that being moderately underweight is unhealthy mostly comes from its association with eating disorders."
tall,3dedgu,DeadlySight,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"The issue is you believe 150lb at 6'9"" is moderately underweight. The ideal weight for that height is 205lbs and that's before the updated modern scaled which go higher based on height. Being over 50lbs underweight isn't moderate in any sense of the word. The main issues are a weakened immune system, less strength, and reduced nutrient absorption."
tall,3dedgu,Mediddly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:49 2015 UTC,"The guy is 6'9, 50lbs isn't the same to him as it is someone a foot or foot and a half shorter, that's just sensationalism. His BMI is 16.1. Low, no doubt, but so what? You don't have to be strong to be healthy. His immune system may be compromised, I'll have to look into that, but can't say I've heard any negatives about nutrient absorption."

I think you're right to scale the stone up, assuming that the size of a stone is important to her. Is she set on a diamond?

tall,3dfx5v,DondeT,2,Thu Jul 16 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"My ring finger is an N, which Google tells me is a U.S. size 7. That sounds kinda smaller than your SO's but I still have big hands.    Firstly, an engagement ring should never be based on what your friends have. It's a personal thing between the two of you and at the end of the day it's just a symbol. It's often a big investment and there's nothing wrong with discussing what she wants ahead of time. Me and my SO talked about it a lot quite a long time before we got engaged, so it wasn't subtle hints on the approach to the big question but this might not be possible for you.   I think my stone is only about 0.5 ct but it's amazingly sparkly and I love it. My SO was looking for 1 ct but because I like the solitaire style the bigger stones stick up more and basically just get in the way. Some women don't wear their engagement rings the whole time and do want something bigger to show off when they do - there are quite a lot of variables to consider but I'd really recommend talking to her if it's not a surprise thing.   If you want a big ring and she likes the vintage styles there are a lot of options out there for a central stone and then a boarder of smaller stones. I have a few friends with rings like this and they love them - most have a coloured stone in the middle and diamonds around the outside, but be aware that you'll need to get a wedding band made to fit with it, because standard ones available won't rest up against it properly.   Basically decide on your budget and go from there, if she just wants a big diamond then cost can very a huge amount from the quality of the stone, not just the size. Metal is also another variable, platinum is more expensive than gold, it's harder which also means it costs more to work which includes any size adjustments you might need in the future or engraving costs."
tall,3dfx5v,Salaciouslysera,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:59:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think I am going to do a halo setting which also makes the center stone seem larger. I have also read in many places to always go platinum, even though it is pricier it is worth it."

I expected to have some pains the first few months on my bike and stuff so I ignored it mostly since the wound was still fresh inside.   The full healing process was 6 months to a year.   Until a few years ago, I didn't really had any problems whatsoever. I always think before I lift something heavy and that kind of stuff.   Basically what any person should do. Listen to your body and adapt :)  Recently it was quite bad. See I drum as a hobby and I play metal and thus a lot of double bass.  I noticed more pains after playing long sessions and after some research I found out that my drumstool was too low.   It's better now. Don't get me wrong, I would do it again in an instant.

I am 6'6"" and a little over 300 lbs One of my friends worked at a costume shop and found me a really cool looking cane that was basically a steel rod with a skeleton hand on top. It looked awesome and was tall and strong enough but was uncomfortable to hold. My dad surprised me one day with a cane he had made from a stair spindle. He has a wood lathe at home and was originally going to just make it from scratch but he started looking around and found out that you can buy them in different lengths. I added a rubber tip and it worked great.   Bonus- Peter Meyhew (Chewbacca) has an awesome light-saber cane."

It's why some people take HGH supplements.   Unfortunately, as far as predicting your height, we can't really help. A lot of doctors can't predict height, so we're even more in the dark.   Only thing you can do is wait.   Also, I don't think losing some sleep will hurt your growth in the long run.   So relax and take it easy."

tall,3d8xzs,Rhinowarlord,6,Tue Jul 14 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'm about 90% sure that being tall doesn't actually give that much of a ""leverage"" advantage, it's just how the volume of cylinders work. Having a 7 inch long bicep means that its total volume is going to be higher (more muscle, so you're stronger), despite being the same thickness as a 6 inch bicep on a shorter person. People usually judge strength based on thickness of muscle, rather than volume, because volume is far more difficult to estimate than circumference, so a tall person might look like a twig, but have more muscle mass than someone a foot shorter who looks huge.  This also means that tall people can pack on way, way more muscle (or fat) because there's more room.  tl;dr tall people are deceptively strong."

One thing I've learned in the past few years of lifting weights: Being big and strong is relatively straight-forward (eat big, lift big). Being lean is relatively straight forward (calories in < calories burned). But being big, strong, and lean is really, frickin' hard (without supplements)."
tall,3d8xzs,ImRonSwansonBurgundy,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but of course being big, strong, and lean is really hard, because big and lean are kind of differing ideologies. My initial recommendation, though, would be to eat big but make sure it's healthy stuff. Tons of protein, tons of dark green vegetables, stuff like that. And drink more water - my one bodybuilder friend has a gallon with him literally at all times.  Big, strong and lean is probably the hardest goal of anyone who's into fitness, as I'm sure you're aware of. I'm guessing you already have, as well, but check out r/fitness for more info on getting big and staying lean at the same time."

I was a competitive swimmer through college and switched to running and lifting and the problem went away. Although now instead of just having shirts that are hard to fit (wide shoulders and long torso) its hard to fit into pants. My wife says I have speed skater thighs. Now I don't work out at all...so I've got other problems. But running seemed to help the calves.

Do 3x20 taking 2 seconds on the way up and 2 seconds on the way down. Pause for one second at the top and bottom so you aren't using any bounce. Give them lots of volume and they will grow."

I hate calf raises they make my calves cramp very bad. I used to drive my Rx8 (6'2 and had just enough room) that was manual transmission.

tall,3d9d4q,phase_deux,6,Tue Jul 14 15:44:35 2015 UTC,"Bicycle with fixed gear ratio (i.e. one cogwheel on the pedal end, one cogwheel on the rear wheel).  Good for certain types of racing, murder if the ground goes even slightly uphill."
tall,3d9d4q,limeybastard,10,Tue Jul 14 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"Close, but not quite.   ""Fixie"" = bike with a single gear and the rear hub is fixed.    Contrast to ""single speed"", which is also a bike with a single gear, but where the rear hub has a freewheel (like most bikes).  A Single speed bike lets you coast.  A fixie bike requires your feet to be moving if the bike is moving.  (Also, the gear ratio doesn't mandate hills be hard.  It's just a tradeoff: Do you wanna climb or do you wanna be able to go fast?  Pick one.)"
tall,3d9d4q,the_arcatan,3,Tue Jul 14 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, my mistake.  Fixed rear hub sounds horrible."
tall,3d9d4q,limeybastard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:55:25 2015 UTC,I've only met people that love it or hate it. Haven't found that middle ground yet. As for the fixed rear there's a very natural connection that forms when your legs and cranks work as a single unit. Try it out. It doesn't replace other riding styles but it's unique.
tall,3d9d4q,Vennell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"I'm certain I would fall off repeatedly.  I do so much coasting, I'm so used to it, that I'd have to unlearn things first, and in the meantime it would cause problems.  Also, with my bad knees (tall problems! woo!), I really really like the option of a lower gear for starting off."
tall,3d9d4q,CorruptedCopper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"Funniest thing I saw was a guy who took his fixie to a bunch ride. Went up some good hills, fun started when we went down.

In my case, he implanted the lowest my doctor has ever seen and he naturally grew head down and never flipped or anything. During one of my first check ups the doc couldn't find the heart beat and immediately sent me for an ultra sound. That's when they realized how low he was. His head was pretty much at my pubic bone and we could never really get a good view of his face during the sonograms either. It's crazy how different pregnancy can be from one person to another.

My doctor was ancient and wasn't phased by much anymore (which I loved, because his ""been there, done that"" attitude kept my own irrational fears in check) and most of my friends assumed we had huge babies because we were huge people (although I don't think parental height actually has that much correlation to the size of the baby)."

UK here though so we may do things differently such as having our bumps measured!  Don't smoke, eat really well, was active throughout pregnancy so popping out good healthy sizes took everyone by surprise. I did get a lot of ""where on earth did you hide her??!"" 8lb9 in the UK isn't that much over average though. Husband is 6'3"" ish so my girls came out very leggy!"

tall,3d50ph,KommandCBZhi,21,Mon Jul 13 16:02:15 2015 UTC,Any idea how much he weighs? Couldn't find the information.
tall,3d50ph,Voljjin,14,Mon Jul 13 16:24:36 2015 UTC,I would estimate conservatively that he weighs over five hundred pounds.
tall,3d50ph,Mattpilf,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:16 2015 UTC,I think that's a bit high for a conservative guess.  At 500 pounds you are saying he's built like a 222 pound man at 5' 10“ and that assuming proportional scaling(which tends not to be true).  I think the answer is closer to 400 than 500 I think honestly.
tall,3d50ph,bishslap,21,Mon Jul 13 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"Remember the rule of 'cubes'. If he is a bit taller than average, and a bit wider and a bit the 'third' dimension then his weight is much more than just the same percentage. 500lb would probably be a pretty good guess.   TLDR Somebody 25% taller than average is probably nearly 100% heavier."
tall,3d50ph,Mattpilf,8,Mon Jul 13 17:55:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm aware of the math,  (94""/70"")3  =2.25.  At 190 for a 5' 10"" guy would be 425 for him,  on top of that,  people don't scale proportionally.  The number is closer to 2.5 not 3."
tall,3d50ph,JamesBarnes007,4,Mon Jul 13 18:08:17 2015 UTC,Not scaling proportionally is an important consideration.
tall,3d50ph,Mattpilf,2,Mon Jul 13 19:58:14 2015 UTC,"Well a proportional scaling would be cubing it,  that's a very non conservative estimate, since it's often less than cubing. That's why more accurate ""bmi""   measuments use 2.5 instead of the old 2 and proportional 3. Even with proportional scaling 500 pounds at 7' 8"" is 222 pounds at 5'10"". Which is significantly obese. If I saw a man at that mode far and average height,  I'd assume he was 190 pounds or so maybe even 200.  200 at proportional size increase would be only 450. A more conservative and likely proportion is a facror 2.5,  which would make it more 340. Igor  is lijely over 300,  but probably only slightly  above 400 if that all,  let alone 500."
tall,3d50ph,JamesBarnes007,0,Mon Jul 13 20:16:37 2015 UTC,Hmm yes BMI would be a good way of working it out. Just based on appearence I would guess around 180kgs or so.

tall,3d50ph,bishslap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"I'm just guessing of course, but to put in a bit of perspective, Robert Wadlow (tallest ever) was just shy of 500lb. He was only about 1 foot taller, but was very lean and lanky. Igor is pretty solid and only a foot shorter."
tall,3d50ph,Mattpilf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:03:30 2015 UTC,"Robert Wadlow   Well he was 440 at his death. Higher number claims are very suspect to begin with, as things like these are routinely exaggerated. Anyways if we scaled Robert Wadlow down to Igor heigh he'd be  300 pound. Also Robert did have a fair gut. His arms were thin, but the waist and legs weren't as thin.  Yeah Igor is heftier, and proportionally I could see him being pounds more of fat and muscle. I'd say it's reasonable to believe that he has about 110 pound on top of what he would be to be as lean as Robert. Maybe he's a bit more, but I'd still think it's probably(more than 50%  chance) that he's less than 450, and likely less than 500."

Even now at 308 people just refuse to believe it. Maybe there is such a thing as big boned, or higher density bones or something. I know muscle weighs more than fat, but that's not an excuse I can use.   For further frame of reference, I have a 50"" chest, 52"" waist, 50"" hips.

tall,3d6zc2,Gargnel,3,Tue Jul 14 02:45:05 2015 UTC,"Last year I was misdiagnosed with Osgood. I was suffering with pain in my kneees which ended up being splint fractures. During which, my growth rate went upto 1cm/2 weeks for a couple months, an all time high."
tall,3d6zc2,Deadlytower,2,Tue Jul 14 12:58:23 2015 UTC,"First of all I'd recommend a visit to the doctor, x-rays and ultrasonic to see the condition of your knees. ( bone , cartilage , joints)  In my situation at about your age I had nothing wrong ( as per the doctors)  and still have knee pain for no apparent reason. So if you go get yourself checked and everything is ok the only thing you can do is training ( squats, running, possible weightlifting when squats are no longer effective ) to increase your leg strength and maybe some calcium / vitamin supplements ( although I'd ask a doctor about these first not just blindly take them). At your age i'd say that due to very fast growth in the last year or so you probably have some calcium / mineral deficiency coupled with lack of muscle mass to support your new found ""tallness"". L.E.   You would be surprised how much 20 squats 3-4 series  and around 10-15 pushups 3-4 series every morning would help.          Also lack of any exercise coupled with your future probable growth will only make things worse."
tall,3d6zc2,BirdSlingerJohnson,2,Tue Jul 14 06:04:47 2015 UTC,"I exercise and such, plus I drink a crapton of milk, like 10 glasses everyday. I think most of the pain comes from rapid growth, because I was like 5'9 until last year."
tall,3d6zc2,spoonracings2k,3,Tue Jul 14 06:30:39 2015 UTC,I had knee pains my entire summer before my freshman year of college and a little bit into it. I thought it was growing pains but when one knee was way swollen I got it checked out and it was a torn meniscus. My knee still clicks a lot but for general aching pains I would suggest some good ole' fashion ice. If you exercise or run a lot be wary of your form.
tall,3d6zc2,callmeRichard,2,Tue Jul 14 02:39:52 2015 UTC,"Proper stretching before physical activity, and hitting the weight room. I tore my acl 4 months ago, and it's been squats and leg presses all day in physical therapy."

tall,3d6zc2,Logan_Gibson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:05:05 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a really good pair of orthotic insoles for your shoes.  The following is going to sound like a commercial, but I swear it is true.  I work in a job where I am on my feet for 8-10 hours and I used to have really bad pains in my feet, knees, and lower back. However, after getting a set of really good insoles (mine cost about $50) all of those problems went away.  If you are in the US you can visit a Walmart, they have a machine by Dr. Scholls that you stand on and it measures you foot, balance, and pressure points. Then it tells you exactly which of the insoles you need. I know the $50 is a little high for something that goes in your shoes, but I promise it is TOTALLY worth it."
tall,3d6zc2,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:40:24 2015 UTC,"I had big knee problems between 14-17 because my legs were growing too fast and the cartilage couldn't cope with it so bone was rubbing on bone (as you can tell i am no doctor but this is how it was explained to me), i think it was call and Osteochondral defect but I'm not 100%.  The good news is now I'm nearly 22 and i haven't had any knee problems for a few years and I play a lot of sport.  Hopefully any knee problems you are having are also just due to growing quickly and it might just be something you have to live with for a few years."

Whey protein is going to help you build fatty muscle (more or less muscle that holds lipids and water really well).

tall,3d63u7,sixonedude,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"I'm bi and at least kinda curious about hooking up with someone around my height or even taller. Sites like Gaydar allow you to use height in your search criteria but searching for bi/gay guys over 6'6"" in the UK will probably show you what feels a disappointingly low number of guys. Just like /u/A_nameless_ghost points out, we're a subset of a subset.    I'm not exactly complaining though; I'm sure the rarity of my height plays a part in the number of offers I get from guys and being bi means I'm used to my partners being so much smaller anyway. It probably helps that I'm comfortable with the pre-conceived notions that many guys have about guys my size too."

Thankfully for me it's just curiosity right now, since it's quite common to hear guys say how great it is when a partner is around the same size, so I'd like to experience it at some point.    On the main site/app I've been using I've yet to see a taller guy (no height search though) but being the tallest guy around on a bi/gay hookup site is definitely not a bad position to be in... it can lead to a few awkward positions though, like on Sunday with a 5'4"" guy ;)"

tall,3d2iul,GrandBuba,2,Mon Jul 13 03:12:10 2015 UTC,"This goes for every height. People tend to stop at a 90° angle (where the forces on the knee are at 100%), and 'bounce' from there.  It's a lot better to go fully 'bent', rest in the relative safety of a full squat (hence the name), and start from there with relative momentum. Makes for strong hip flexors (keeping you upright when leaning backwards into the squat), works the glutes a lot more, but needs some flexibility in achilles tendons.  I know quite a few guys who can do 200 kg+ squats, and almost none of them have the actual leg 'power' to do one single-leg (pistol) squat because they only train the upper side of the movement, whereas the lower part is a lot more functional. They can get 200kg from a 'just below parallel' to full extension without problems, but once they go lower than that, the weight goes down considerably, and the hide behind the 'knees' rule."

You DO need a hell of a lot of leg power to squat 200kg.    they only train the upper side of the movement, whereas the lower part is a lot more functional.    The lower part is more functional? For what? How often do you drop your ass against your calves and then drive up huge amounts of weight? Whereas for instance how often do you bend your knees slightly to moderately to then move huge amounts of weight? Think about sports - you never get in the position you are saying is more functional, but say you're a football player blocking you will be in the position much more similar to a regular back squat."
tall,3d2iul,GrandBuba,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"We are both correct,but because we have different definitions of 'power'.   To you (and 'old me'), power is equal to displacement of weight. Like benching a big bar. To me, power is equal to ability, and that should be trained by using the full range of your movement, and using every stabiliser out there. Like doing planche pushups. It's a different approach to ""strength"".  I'm not saying that squatting heavy is bad (quite the contrary, I've always pushed for 2xBW minimum in our group, it's a staple exercise), I'm saying that it needs to be complemented with balance/flexibility/control exercises such as pistol squats/single leg high box squats etc in order to give access to this 'power' over a full range of movement, and lessen the possibility for injuries when going beyond the trained ranges (by accident).   Think about sports - you never get in the position you are saying is more functional, but say you're a football player blocking you will be in the position much more similar to a regular back squat.   That's the difference again. You're thinking about sports like football, whereas I'm not a sports man, but a BJJ man. I very often find myself on my ass with a big weight on top of me, I quite often need to be able to open my hips beyond what average (stiff) flexors/adductors will allow, and I quite often needs to develop a tremendous pushing power from maximum open angles.   I see a lot of F1 cars in the gym: tremendous power at high revs, but unable to get going without stalling.. :-)"

I think I'm naturally strong enough where I can do regular lifting things in the world that people call on ""strong people"" to do, but when it comes to the gym, I can't bench press worth shit or do stuff with heavy free weights. I really hate the bench press. Especially with long arms."

tall,3d2iul,Swiftzor,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:32:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you're over like 6'2"" and squatting you're in for some serious medical concerns.  Instead focus on a linear leg press, it works almost the same muscles and is waaaaaayyyyyy safer to do if you're taller."
tall,3d2iul,teh_jolly_giant,2,Mon Jul 13 22:52:35 2015 UTC,As someone about to seriously get into weight lifting I have to ask you to explain that.
tall,3d2iul,Emotional_Masochist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"It all has to deal with stress on the joints.  More or less think of the body as a mechanical system. Now the more a moving part on a mechanical system has to move, the more stress it undergoes, the more stress it undergoes, the more quickly it fails.  Since a squat applies force on both the knees and the back, it can be very damaging for both the knees and back if done improperly or too much.  In addition since as tall people we have a greater distance to cover we put more stress on those parts of the body due to distance traveled.  Your doctor can tell you way more than I could, but that's the basics of it."

tall,3cx2m4,Angle_Theta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:42:13 2015 UTC,I turned 22 a month ago and I grew almost an inch in the past year. I still get growing pains now and then so it looks like I am still growing. You should have at least another year or two. You won't grow a lot but you might be able to add an inch or two.
tall,3cx2m4,biggred11,2,Sat Jul 11 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this.  Between the time I was 19-22ish, I put on around 2 inches.  While not much compared to the rest of my growth, it's still something.  I'd expect to see at least another inch before /u/yukariyasha quits growing.  As far as making yourself seem taller, how is your posture? As someone who sat at a computer playing games most of my early life, and now sits at a computer making software for my adult life, my posture can be imperfect at times, which probably takes me down an inch or so."

tall,3cx2m4,Magnopherum,8,Sat Jul 11 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"I've always thought 6'0 is a nice round height. It depends how much you want to grow. You may grow another 1-2 inches naturally, and if your posture is bad, stretching can add on a few inches. Other than that, there's not much you can do besides eat a raw potato ev- no, sorry. Not sure where that came from."

tall,3cx2m4,AlexMcEjik,6,Sat Jul 11 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing to be focusing on right now is being confident and owning how tall you are. Not a lot of people even reach 6'0 and a lot of people are envious to a point where it hurts their social interactions. As a guy that's 6'5 I can say there is no greater consistent, awkward elephant in the room than when I am talking with (usually a guy) who has insecurities about his height. How tall you are is part of you, and you have to be the person to love who you are (fuck everybody else).   Don't let society make you think that you have to be taller because when it becomes a practical situation, 6'0-6'2 is the perfect height. You can fit into sports cars, clothing still reasonably fits without the need to make your own or go to a tailor, you don't have that much trouble with shower heads or tubs, and you don't have to constantly look out for ceiling fans or low hanging light fixtures.   Regardless of if you grow more or not, the most important thing that you can do for yourself right now is become comfortable with the body you were given, because it is going to be there with you the whole ride home."

Then she told me it was all about the plane being balanced - apparently an unbalanced plane would be ok if I'd paid to make it that way - I'm tall but I'm not fat.

The biggest reason though, is that most of the time I rise in very cold water and don't want my body in the stream. I got into the habit hearing that it's better on your hair. While the internet has told me it's likely to be a myth, I still do it because I feel a difference and seems to help it dry less frizzy at least."

tall,3cnsea,Aryada,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"I've been reading that site about biblical gender roles for like an hour and a half, it's interesting as fuck.  As far as I can tell, this is an actual human being with a family etc. who is OK with some slavery (and suggests it as a punishment for petty crime), agrees that not getting to fuck your wife in random places is the worst thing in a husband's life (step 6 here), thinks gay people cause discrimination against Christians and, of course, Obama is a socialist whose food stamp programs attack traditional marriage (but presumably don't attack ""non-traditional"" marriage?).  How does someone arrive at this schizophrenic worldview? Who do they hope to convince of their arguments (which are mainly bible verses and interpretation)? (Comments are mainly sympathetic even with more extreme articles.) How do you reach your 40's without understanding that slavery is bad even if the bible doesn't condemn it? Were they as weirdly religious before their divorce?  Bonus article on why polygyny is good but polyandry is bad, women who are turned on by looking at men are unusual, God has no problem with men or women's sexual nature (this is presumably somehow distinct to the sexual depravity he does have a problem with earlier in the article), ""erroneous zones"", and some point about how marriage should be a proto-dom/sub relationship (point 6)."

They're obviously at least somewhat intelligent, it's fascinating that someone with the same basic motivations, needs, desires and capacity for thought as any of us has formed these risible ideas and justified them to himself by quoting vaguely related bible verses. Is it basically just indoctrination that they've never questioned? Are they a sociopath or something?

You're tall and beautiful no matter what, so wear whatever makes you feel happy.   Also I want to say congrats on being able to pull off a peep-toe. I'm so jealous.

tall,3crtj2,MysticMixles,20,Fri Jul 10 06:53:02 2015 UTC,Has it always been that way?    Actually thousands of years ago it was super cheery. Everyone was joking around and having a blast back when the shorter you were the more wealth and affluence was attributed to your character. The shorter you were the more attractive you were to the fair maidens and all the worlds leaders were short.   Then the great height war of 225 AD happened and all of a sudden everyone wanted to be super tall and then r/short became bitter and angry. Truefact
tall,3crtj2,VaguerCrusader,9,Fri Jul 10 12:01:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, being short is not what most would call a desired trait. That is some reason of why they are angry. Also, realize that life would probably be harder if some people saw you as less mature because of something you couldn't control. As for you, how old are you? 6'3 is tall for any age, just not quite tall on here lol"
tall,3crtj2,Flyingflamethrower,7,Fri Jul 10 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"Well, think of it as /r/positivetrait and /r/negativetrait.   Being tall is a positive trait and being short is a negative trait."
tall,3crtj2,irbananaking,9,Fri Jul 10 16:59:34 2015 UTC,Its not rocket science man. Being short is an ugly trait in society. You really expect r/short to be cheerful when you are considered ugly and or less masculine by everyone? Are people really this oblivious to status quos in the world right now?
tall,3crtj2,Gonz84,-4,Fri Jul 10 19:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm subbed at /r/short and there is NEVER any funny stories, fun pictures, or interesting anecdotes. It's all posts about people being bullied for their height (which is wrong), links to articles stating women prefer tall men, or other depressing discussions.   I find the more I think about traits I'm self conscious about, the more paranoid I get that people are noticing or talking about that trait. I guess I'm wondering what you get out of being subscribed there?"
tall,3crtj2,KitsBeach,7,Sat Jul 11 05:35:39 2015 UTC,"A place to release frustrations anonymously. You cant do that IRL or you are a short weak sissy or a Napoleon. Just because you are not reading about those traits or thinking about them doesn't mean people are still not instantly judging you about it.  You cant force a sub to be positive when the very topic of discussion is seen as a huge negative in our current society. Bottom line, being extremely short as a man is nothing to be happy about in any shape or form.You really cant twist that into some cheesy positive."
tall,3crtj2,Gonz84,-3,Sat Jul 11 08:58:55 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, for sure. May I ask why you only post in /r/short and /r/tall?"

Obviously I use reddit for entertainment,  but /r/short was the first time I had seen people talking about the realities of height and being short, and the first time I felt comfortable speaking about it due to anonymity.  Without /r/short, and by extension /r/tall, I probably wouldn't post on reddit at all. Big time lurker, but I found subs that hit close to home."

People become a certain way because of how others treat them, nobody starts out 'angry', 'awful', 'nice' or 'cheerful' by default, it's mostly a 'from experience' thing. Get praised and complimented all the time, you'll going to end up with a 'gee, people are nice' attitude. Get spurned and mocked most of the time, you're going to end up a little more gloomy and cynical.  It's a self-reenforcing mechanism as well, and it takes a conscious effort to go against the flow for a few years and still keep that 'cheerful facade' up."

A person with an aggressive temperament is going to standout if he ends up being unusually short or unusually tall.  Likewise, someone who has innate leadership qualities is going to have a bad time if (s)he ends up with a body type that people don't want to follow (which applies to height, race, gender, etc.)."

tall,3crtj2,pokemoninsider,3,Sat Jul 11 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your analogy.  According to your theory, having smaller feet actually makes you run slower.  How is that like being short?  What is it that being short actually limits you in a physical way that people bemoan on /r/short?  I can't think of any.  We usually bemoan social stigma.  A better analogy would be complaining that people assume that you can't run as fast as them because you have size 11 feet....even though you can actually run even faster than them - if you were only given a chance to race."
tall,3crtj2,seanc_84,-4,Sat Jul 11 09:02:25 2015 UTC,"The point is that you can't change it, and there is nothing you can do about it. /r/short in my experience has been people complaining about how dating is impossible and their lives are the worst because they are short. None of the short people I know have difficulty finding compatible dating partners and don't have any problems with where they stand in life. I am fairly confident that their issues are not because of them being short, but rather something else completely. They act like if they had been tall, their entire life would be so much better, but it's not something that will change your life completely. I have been on both sides of the spectrum, and I can tell you that I have experienced no difference in my success in terms of general day to day life because of the change in height. For example, I got better at basketball from the time I was 5'3"" to now, but that was because I practiced all the time, not because I grew. If anything, the rapid growth set me back because it caused knee issues for me. I am sure that things like being in great shape, looking good, having a good personality, and being a pleasant person are fare more important factors in being successful in dating. Just look at people like Daniel Radcliffe and Seth Green, who are extremely successful despite the fact that they are short. The point of the analogy is to say, work on things you can control rather than dwell on things you can't."

I wouldn't worry about your height being a factor since most sports are dominated by tall people. Volleyball and basketball being the easiest targets, but nigh every event in Track & Field, baseball, and a ton of others, height makes you a better player.   There's lots of sports I wanted to be good at, and I am, but I understand that I might not be genetically gifted to do said sports. It doesn't stop me from lifting weights, running, and doing all the other stuff that makes me awesome. You're awesome too -so don't sweat it --except at the gym! :)"

Rivendell makes touring bikes in sizes up to 71cm.  Cannondale makes the supersix in a 63cm  Specialized makes the Diverge in a 64.  Mountain bikes are a whole different story, but Kona and Santa Cruz make some really large full suspension bikes, and Specialized makes some pretty large hardtails.   Leonard Zinn in Boulder also makes custom frames for tall people."

tall,3clwx0,anonanon1313,2,Fri Jul 10 14:30:20 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'10"" and have 5, 68cm frames. All of them are touring or sport-touring frames with long chain stays. My favorites are my 2 Cannondales, the oversized tubing makes them very rigid.  The newest frames are 90's vintage, the oldest are early 80's. They just stopped making large frames in mass production after the 90's. I have 2 MTB bikes, both standard 26"" wheel. They're OK, I'd prefer somewhat longer wheelbase, but I can live with them. Fortunately, at 240#, I don't have both height and weight issues.  I've looked at 36"" wheel bikes for a long time, but was put off by the limited selection of rims and tires. I'm very picky about tires. Normal size people have ridden small wheeled bikes (bike Friday, Moulton, etc) for a long time, so I don't see a huge difference for road riding, but off road could be a whole nother story.  I've looked at a lot of custom and tall bikes and haven't been impressed. Zinn was making short chain stay bikes the last I looked, which told me we had very different philosophies. I have not been impressed by anything I've seen."

tall,3clwx0,Zank_Frappa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:08:05 2015 UTC,Zinn makes a lot of race bikes (and bikes for people with illusions of racing) so the short chainstays are a result of that. Definitely not what you want on a touring frame. Have you looked at Rivendell frames? They make the A. Homer Hilsen in a 71! That should be tall enough even for most people in this sub.

The Museonder is a art/nature museum, there's even some original Van Gogh paintings on the wall. Website: https://www.hogeveluwe.nl/en/plan-your-trip/visitors-centre  Other than that I'd say Amsterdam (of course), Den Haag (I suppose that's what you meant with 'Hagge'?), Utrecht and Delft are some beautiful cities to visit. To be completely fair I'd probably skip Rotterdam if you won't be spending too much time in our tiny country. Rotterdam is an industrial city with relatively few old or special sites to visit. Besides the big cities you could also visit Naarden, which is fairly close to Amsterdam and it's an absolutely beautiful 'star fort': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naarden.  Foodwise: make sure you stock up on 'stroopwafels' (butter waffles/syrup waffles is what English people would call it I think) to bring home, because you're sure gonna miss them when you come home. You should also try some 'drop' (liquorice), you're probably not gonna like it since most foreigners find our liquorice to be too salty, but it's really something you should try anyways. Also try a 'frikandel', 'kroket' and a 'patatje speiaal', you can buy those at any snackbar/cafeteria you see.   Finally, don't be afraid to ask any of the locals for directions/advice or anything else. Us Dutch people love to speak English because we're all sure about the fact that we're able to speak it perfectly even though that's not the case most of the times.

Naarden is an example of a star fort, complete with fortified walls and a moat. The moat and walls have been restored. [when?]  Naarden was granted its city rights in 1300 (the only town in Het Gooi with these rights) and later developed into a fortified garrison town with a textile industry. Naarden is the home of the Netherlands Fortress Museum (Nederlands Vestingmuseum). Naarden hosts the bi-annual Naarden Photo Festival and, on Good Friday, a performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion in the local church, which is called the Great Church or St. Vitus Church. Despite its earlier importance, Naarden's population was surpassed by Hilversum in the 18th century and today it is smaller than its neighbour Bussum.  Naarden is well known as the city where Jan Amos Komensky (Comenius) was buried; visitors can see his grave in the mausoleum devoted to him.

Nearly everything is available in tall sizes and many shirts also come in ""slightly fitted"", so you can really get the length and still have a trim look, if that's what you want. The only problem is their pants only go to a 36"" inseam. That's perfect for me, and I have really long legs, so I know a lot of guys taller than me have the same inseam, but if yours is longer, you're out of luck. They've also reduced the availability of the 36 inseam, but so far I can still get everything I need. Literally, I do not buy clothes anywhere else."

After learning proper form and training my balls off I was able to touch the top of the box on the backboard at 16 and 6'7.

tall,3clvq5,LargeBody76,2,Thu Jul 9 00:01:43 2015 UTC,"What helped the most was plyometrics and just going outside and plain ole' jumping. Specifically I was doing the plyometrics dvd from p90x, but you can find all kinds of stuff like it on youtube. For the jumping I'd lower my basketball goal to whatever height was needed to just barely dunk with a tennis ball. I'd practice every kind of dunk such as drop step, running and jumping off 1 foot, etc. When it became easier I'd raise the goal an inch. When you get to ten feet progress in ball size (softball, volleyball, kickball, kids basketball). Adding weighted squats helps out too, but I didn't even do that until after I could dunk a regular basketball.  One thing I've noticed is tall guys like to jump ""from the knees"". You gotta visualize and feel yourself use your hips to generate the main power and then have the calves provide that extra few inches of fling. I know it sounds confusing, but really think about what muscles you are engaging when you jump next time you play ball or train.  If you got any basketball questions let me know. I've been playing all my life and I love the sport."

tall,3cie1q,waffleocalypse,2,Wed Jul 8 03:40:23 2015 UTC,"Removal of the headrests is available with google searches. They appear to adjust up as well. For something as specific as replacement/other model swaps, I would head to a chevy forum.  I've never had the problem and I've driven almost everything, audi, bmw, mercedes, vw, jaguar, chevy suvs and pickups, scion frs, but mostly ford pickups, explorers, and mustangs so old they didn't have headrests. I've fit in most cars except certain exotics and the fiat500 as a passenger. Your height isn't listed so I'm gonna guess over 6'3"".  Maybe adjust your seating position? I usually have to lean the seat back pretty far so my head never touches the headrest. Sitting straight up is uncomfortable for me and shoves the headrest on a few into the back of my head, this causes more discomfort and makes my head look at a downward angle."
tall,3cie1q,dustballer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I took the headrest off and turned it around but because it is angled it's quite far back and it can't be adjusted to be taller in that position. If I get into a wreck it will probably end up injuring me further so I'd like to get it fixed for safety reasons as well.  I'm 6'4"" but I have a longer torso, and I hate leaning back while driving for long distances which is why I got this car, it has decent headroom and I can actually sit up straight with just about an inch to spare.   I guess I'll head to a Chevy forum, I was just hoping that someone here would have had a similar issue that they found a solution for, thanks for the reply!"
tall,3cie1q,dustballer,2,Wed Jul 8 10:52:10 2015 UTC,"Well, at least the temporary solution helped. Wish I could help more, but I would seriously just start asking people, ""hey, can I see your headrest for a minute?"" Then explain. Try anyone, any brand. Safety not guaranteed."

tall,3cie1q,dustballer,2,Wed Jul 8 17:43:25 2015 UTC,Do it. If not consider test driving more vehicles and buying a different one. Change seats altogether from another model. Racing seats can be great or hell depending.

I'm applying to veterinary school next year so I'm a full time college student with a part time job working 17-20 hours every weekend at a veterinary clinic for $9.00 an hour.

tall,3chi2a,H2Otoo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:20:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming you know what you're doing, weightlifting should only do you good. There's no way you are going to ""accidentally"" put on too much muscle or get to a detrimental weight without becoming a fatass.   Plus, strength training strengthens tendons, ligaments, and bones; not just muscles."
tall,3chi2a,cburl04,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:39:36 2015 UTC,"When you say you're worried about joint problems due to extra weight, do you mean extra body weight, or lifting weights? Either way, I really wouldn't worry about a general notion that you might have joint problems because you're tall. If you're really concerned, ask a doctor. But absent a medical recommendation specific to you, I don't think that should be a concern at all unless you're overweight and overfat. Putting on additional muscle mass will also result in stronger bones and more support for the joints. You're not even talking about a huge physique here, so really, go ahead. It's always a good idea to talk to a doctor about a new exercise regime though."
tall,3chi2a,piylo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:34:10 2015 UTC,"I need to get my flexibility and tendon strength while I do it I guess.

tall,3chi2a,Iwannabeaviking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:53:40 2015 UTC,Losing weight and gaining muscle is a good way to alleviate joint problems. So you may want to lose weight in general while gaining muscle mass around any problem joints.
tall,3chi2a,piylo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I'm going to hopefully drop from 12-14% body fat to around 10% then work up from there."

Still hella weak, but I thought I would chip in. Weightlifting can help with joint problems, and being strong can help you feel... well, healthy. For things like squats and the like, don't listen to what people say about going below parallel hurting your knees - it doesn't, unless you have garbage form.   You should try and gain weight and muscle, and you can always go on a cut after you have bulked for a while.  Go to /r/fitness and ask on one of their foolish friday or moronic monday thigns. They will likely tell you to start with Starting Strength or Strong Lifts, and occasionally a push,pull, legs program. You are going to want a linear progression program (increase weight every workout). Go below parallel with squats. Although it isn't anything worth being proud of, my knees have been a-okay and maybe better after two months of squatting (85lbs -> 210lbs). I personally wouldn't worry about a little bodyfat, once you put on some muscle, you will probably look like you are more fit, even if you weigh more and have a higher bf%. A cut isn't too hard to do afterwards. Gaining the strength is the most difficult part.  Don't half-rep those squats, or I will find you and I will kill you. (just kidding obviously, but don't.)"
tall,3chi2a,MasterChaif,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:16:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't start gaining weight until my 30s. I played basketball in university, and tried like mad to gain weight trying any/everything short of steroids. (This was about the time Lyle Alzado died, and that stuff always scared me anyway)  With just a normal lifestyle, I was 6'10 205-210lbs. Lifting and eating a lot I could hit my playing weight of 245. But, I really had to work hard at it. My junior year I managed to hit 260 for a while. And, while I could really post up well it changed how I played the rest of the game--easily lost a step, and 4"" off my vertical. So, I easily dropped back down to 245 for the rest of the season.  I'm in my mid-40s now and aside from a stress fracture in my ankle due to heavy sprint training when I had my weight up (it actually cost me my career as a player--I could never rehab that ankle well enough), I have nothing adverse to report from the weight gain. Just don't try to get a 36"" vertical or 4.4 40 speed when you're heavier than your body wants to be."

tall,3chbeh,Big_Jon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"Straight, but I enjoy statistics.  According to latest samples of the US population, there are approximately 63,452,000 adult males between the ages of 25-54. Many believe the number of homosexuals ranges between 3 to 10 percent of the world's population. If we split the difference and take 7% of the 63M we end up with around 4,440,000.  Now, knowing this sub, about 80% fall below 6 feet tall of those at least 20 years old, and 89% fall below 6'1"".  So the number of gay males not including orher race, socioeconomic or health factors is already limited to 888,000 at least 6ft and just 488,400 at least 6'1. Finding someone your height limits the pool even more dramatically to less than 100,000 25-54, and probably less than 50,000 +/- 10 years to your own age."

The 105s may be 11 speed, in which case I would recommend going with Tiagra.  Road/mtb groups are moving more and more into 11 speed, which means that 10 speed replacement parts are becoming less expensive.  Shimano groupsets transition down the line by generation.  The new Tiagra is the last-gen 105, new 105 is last-gen Ultegra, and so on.  I have last-gen 105 on my Cannondale (61cm TT) and it's easy to work on and shifts smooth."

tall,3ce5f4,MingDynasty40,2,Tue Jul 7 05:27:01 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about electric or acoustic? I'm actually the opposite I prefer smaller bodied guitars. For acoustics there's OM and 000 and I prefer those because I hate the discomfort bigger ones like dreadnoughts gives me when you have to sling your arms around it, plus I have a bit of a case of tennis elbow so it aggravates it. Jumbos and dreadnoughts are really the biggest they get. There's plenty of tall guys who play smaller bodied guitars too in the mainstream like Eric Clapton and John Mayer, for reference they play a 000 and OM respectively.   For electric the biggest shapes are semi hollows like ES-335s or Casinos. The biggest ones are really jazzboxes and they're only big to resonate more, otherwise all electric guitar shapes are pretty small. Like ALL of them: strats, teles, SGs, Les Pauls, Mustangs, etc.  What is the thing that is bothering you about the particular guitar, and which one are you playing right now?"

Your large hands should actually help you (particularly with bar chords, only a few compact chords I have issue with).  I'll bet you're trying to watch your fingers while you play... if you need to do that, use a mirror and stand up straight.  When you were learning piano, you were probably also staring at your fingers and not your music (and therefore bent over too)... but you've hopefully learnt over time to trust your fingers and can sit up properly and take your gaze off your fingers... you just need to do the same with the guitar (and find a teacher!)."

Then what? Have you saved enough money to retire, did you think your career was going to be cut short?  If the injury is bad enough, you might not be allowed to play again because it's a liability.    Then you're most likely 30 years from retirement with probably not a whole lot saved up."
tall,3ch1fg,goodgod102,3,Wed Jul 8 11:18:01 2015 UTC,"Because you need to have so much more go your way than just being tall.   Being tall brings a lot of other problems and those problems are usually amplified because you are tall.   Greg Oden has all the talent and ability in the world but his body can't stay healthy enough to get through a game.   Also, just because its called a game doesn't mean its a game.   Its a job, and exponentially more stressful then most others."

So its a done deal, i'm already picking out what cars I'm gonna buy.   But, I get hurt, and try to come back.   I'm no longer the player I used to be.   I tried to see if i could still make it, it wasn't going to happen.   I think you are assuming that the Lakers have an open million dollar contract and they will give it, no questions ask, to the next guy over 7'.    It takes a lot more than being tall to make it in the NBA.   I'd love to have played and made millions, but the process isn't easy or scripted."

In the last year or so, the entire interior of my L5 has become severely narrowed and is slowly crushing my spinal cord. I'll be needing surgery on it when I can. The disc is about half gone and the vertebrae are deteriorating so they'll remove the disc and replace it with a ceramic spacer, grind out the screwed bits of vertebrae and install plates on both sides. Once that's done, they'll remove one side of the back of my L5 so that my spinal cord has room again."

Some shirts, like those made by American Apparel, run long and slim rather than wide and short.  As others have said, hang drying helps. If you don't have the time to do that try this:  Fold the shirt on it's vertical axis, grab the shirt just below the armpit/sleeve seam with one hand,  and then grab the bottom end of the shirt with the other hand. Firmly, but gently, stretch the torso of the shirt out. The shirt will usually fit a bit more tall/slim after this. Be careful not to put tension on the seems in the armpit, so make sure your hand is below them.  I have recently acquired a sewing machine and have begun altering my clothes to fit me better."

Some people are ugly, some are beautiful, some tall, some blonde, some cross-eyed, some with perfect teeth, some with bumpy skin, some with cleft palates.    I'd really encourage you to make yourself a diagram about social relationships. Draw a circle on a piece of paper and, in the inside, write things you can control, and on the outside, write things you can't. The inside might contain: hygiene, kindness, good listening, risk-taking, laughter, compassion. The outside might contain: height, cultural perceptions, other people's reactions. You could load up a piece of paper with these things.    Once you've done this, cut out the circle and throw away the outside. Keep the circle and focus on what's inside the circle. So long as you do that, you can rest knowing you're doing the best you can.    I'd also remind you that Europe is a unique place in that there are so many cultures that vary so radically all next to each other. Maybe right now you'll not be in a relationship, but one day you'll meet a nice Norwegian person who will make you very happy. And, as always, there's no shame in asking one of the tall guys out.

We split and I was 25  In the last year I've gone out with so many people. There's a population of men that are intimidated by my height and don't like it, sure, but there's also a population that are fascinated by it, love it, and aren't stupid hormonal teenagers anymore so they can embrace it. It's fantastic and I had no idea I could be considered attractive because I was still basing everything on my teen years.   10/10, would not go back to being a teenager for anything."

You won't get any shorter though, so you need to find a way to be happy with your height.  I wish I had more practical advice, but it's something that I'm still struggling with at 27.

Almost no one even reaches my shoulders and wherever I go, everyone stares at me. You, being a girl, is likely even worse.  I had to go through a lot during my school days, and as sad as it may be, you can't change jerks into decent human beings, so you will have to give your best to just ignore those who are not worth your attention. You will meet lots of terrible people, but sooner or later you will end up finding nice people as well!  As for guys only wanting short girls, everyone has their preferences, but I can assure you there are plenty of guys out there who would rather be with a taller girl. And as for how to find someone who'd be interested in you, I'm afraid that's a very hard question with really no answer. I know it's hard, but if you keep yourself strong, things are very likely to turn out well in the future.  From this post alone, I don't know if you are feeling insecure or not about your height, but if you are, I'd like to tell you that the big majority of both guys and girls out there are actually pretty jealous of you, you being that tall and athletic, so keep that in mind.

Other than being obese, it's one of the only physical traits that is immediately obvious, and unlike being obese, because being tall is supposed to be a ""good thing,"" people will continually call you out on it, either positively or negatively.  So don't stress over it. Find ways to enjoy it.  I also was quite shy growing up, and I didn't wind up dating anyone until I was 19 and in college. Yet, somehow, I survived it. Developed a reputation for always dating out of my league.  The difference? I started to feel good about my successes, and didn't freak out about things I hadn't done yet. You have to learn to like yourself before someone else is going to like you, and there's no reason to not like yourself over something that you can't control.  So don't let those kids get to you. They're going to spend the rest of their lives asking for help getting something off a shelf or changing a light bulb, while you proudly look over all their short little heads at concerts. And eventually, some tall dude is going to look over all their heads, and you're going to be the one that he sees.  Because you stand out."

tall,3c7v8p,swim1929,2,Tue Jul 7 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"When I was 16, I was the height I currently am. I'm a 6ft female. As you get older, height in women becomes more and more attractive in my experience. Being a tall woman can be hard. In my experience though, confidence is really a thing that will help. 16 is an awkward age for anyone. But especially if you have a feature that makes you stand out, and thats scary. For everyone. At 16 you just want to merge in with everyone else. Hell, i'm 25 now and sometimes I still want to blend in with the crowd.  And it's rubbish. And it feels awful sometimes. But it gets better. Sure, some people may find it intimidating or strange. But this is you and you can't change being tall. So my approach when I realised this was to make it work. Because you get a brief sneeze of time on this mortal coil. And 70 or 80 years is really not enough time to spend even a moment feeling rubbish about something you can't change, isn't it?   It's difficult. But you are certainly not a freak and you are certainly not a monster. You are blessed with a beautiful gift that's difficult to recognise at the moment but it will be something you come to appreciate, I think. There will be days when it doesn't feel like it, but height is great. You know that symbol in math? The greater than symbol? It means bigger than. Greater than. When I feel down about my height, I try to remember that, even if it is egotistical. A bit of ego never hurt anyone as shy as you seem, sweetpea.   You will find a guy interested in you, too. There are tons of tall guys, if height is important to you. It took me a while but when I was 21, I met a man who I now have the privilege of calling my boyfriend. We've had ups and downs like all relationships, but he is wonderful. He's 6'6 and not even the tallest man I know.   You're currently in school. Once you get out of school your social circles change dramatically. Without sounding patronising (i do not mean to offend!), school is where young people and children are. These demographics by nature, are often not very tall! In the adult world, there are literally tons of tall folk and you will not feel so alone or like a freak or a monster. =] And your height will be less and less of a confidence issue for you.   I can't offer any real advice. But to answer your posts tag line, no, you are not a freak. You are beautiful. And you know whats cool? Being tall, in my experience, has a whole host of benefits as an adult.   I don't get ID'd at pubs I look badass in knee-length shorts because they dont make me look squat I can eat SO MUCH and not put on any weight because I have a higher metabolism than my shorter friends. I'm not sure if this is relevant to height, but I also notice most of the tall folk I know have higher metabolisms generally When you gain the confidence, nothing really stops you because being tall and being able to be confident makes you look and feel unstoppable I feel safer walking down the street at night than most of my short friends. I don't feel as much of a target You don't -have- to wear heels. But even if you choose to, you feel like a model. Your legs go on forever and it's empowering, beautiful and glamorous. You can pull off being 13 stone or whatever weight (arbitrary amount that correlates to my weight, I am by no means implying a weight or anything like that, its just taken out of thin air based on me!) you are looks sexy on you. Because you're tall. Those 4' nothing folk can't pull that off. Because their frame can't support it.    Also the up and down looks? I honestly believe a lot of those are to do with envy. Envy is an ugly trait and that's why you find it upsetting. But that's what it boils down to.   Every single person has a specific taste on what they want in a physical appearance from a partner. And that's beautiful. Because there's going to be so many people who are attracted to you as you get older. Ever wonder why models are all 5'11 and above? There's a reason for that.   You're beautiful. I don't need to see a photo of you to know that. And people wont be talking about you behind your back, if thats what they are doing, for very much longer. School is a terrible time for a lot of people. I hated school. I felt like a freak too. But its for a tiny bit more of your life and so many doors are going to open to  you. You just have to make the best of it in the mean time.   You're right on the cusp of becoming an adult and I promise it wont be this way forever. And every single day that passes, it's only going to get better."

The bullies normally take advantage of the weakness of the other kids so just be confident and think of being tall as something good. Show that you are proud of being tall and they'll probably realise that the insults are not affecting you and they'll enventually stop. Yeah people stare and whisper but especially if they're woman they're probably just jealous of you.

It's weird though, because I can do that, but then I can also binge-eat like crazy.

tall,3c93hr,dat_swag_doe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:25:43 2015 UTC,How many spoonfuls do you use? I normally go with 3 but it usually ends up on the milky side. Still great though.
tall,3c93hr,Woof_tex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you live so the powder may be vastly different but, for a cup that's about 600mL to 900mL - I'm not sure what it is but it's a large cup - I use two and a half spoons but they are HEAPED spoons. Like, there's a spoonful, then there's this. This is scooping the absolute maximum amount you can onto the spoon and piling as much as you can on. So much so that you don't move the spoon to the cup, but you move the cup to the spoon to accommodate it. That twice, then a standard spoon. Fill the cup only a third or half, and stir, making sure to scoop all of the mix off of the sides on the bottom. You gotta make sure all of that mix is, well, mixed. The, after you've totally stirred and got all of the chocolate mix into the drink, add the rest of the milk and give it a quick stir, and you're done. Make sure there's no lumps of powder on the top. Stir if there are."

Dad used to be 6'8"" but as he has worked his way through his 70's he's settled down to 6'5""."
tall,3c93hr,davidtwilcox,3,Mon Jul 6 04:45:26 2015 UTC,"06:00: I blend 3 eggs, 3 bananas, a tea spoon of cocoa and a little bit of soy milk. This fulls me for the next 4 hours. It's the perfect breakfast. It's easy, fast and I can drink it on my way to work. Don't skip the breakfast. Most important meal of the day, have big impact on your hunger through the day.  10:00: 1 banana + 1 scoop of protein supplement (you can skip the protein supplement).  12:00: Anything that follows the proportion rules and that is healthy. I divise my plate in 3 categories: 1/4 of potato or rice (anything that is starch), 1/4 of meat everytime it's fish or chicken and red meat is once every 2 weeks or month and 1/2 of vegetables. It's nice because no matter how hungry you are, you can start with a small plate of food with those proportions and if you are hungry again, you can take another round with the same proportion.   15:00: An apple. A bunch of other fruits if you are still hungry.  18:00: Same as 1200. Respecting the same proportions.  21:00 or 22:00: 2 toasted slices of spelt floor bread with a good portion of peannut butter or if you are allergic like me, use pea butter. Chose a bread that contains 9g of proteins per 2 slices. Spelt floor is easier on your stomach than regular floor, which tend to irritate your intestines.  Note that I go 3 times a week to the gym and jogging 2 times a week. You can skip the protein supplements, but overall, those food tips are great. Never skip the breakfast since it's the most important meal of the day. Before, I never ate my breakfast and I was always hungry. Since I eat a breakfast, this is surprising how it influences your hunger for the rest of the day.  In a case where you are not looking for any gym results, you can allow yourself to cheat from time to time of course."

tall,3c93hr,toastertim,2,Mon Jul 6 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. Every day, all day.  And if I'm eating a proper meal and don't eat till there is no more room I feel as though I need more food. Then repeat in about 2 hours.  Now I'm not in great shape anymore, a couple of knee and ankle surgeries, but I'm not fat by any means."
tall,3c93hr,devern_hansack,3,Mon Jul 6 06:06:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe you are eating too fast? Your stomach takes 16 minutes before it can shows signs of being full. Eat slowly, take time to chew your food.   Between meals, if you are still hungry, take a big glass of water and wait 10 minutes. Sometimes, your brain has difficulties making the difference between being hungry and thirsty. If you are still hungry, eat an apple or a banana."
tall,3c93hr,davidtwilcox,2,Mon Jul 6 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"I definitely eat to fast. I grew up as the youngest of 5, now I'm by far the biggest. I sometimes try to eat slowly, but if it's something I like I just scarf it down. As for the water thing, I drink SOOO much all day that it's sometimes kinda scary. 😋 I started eating apples between meals and 10-15 minutes before meals because they have some kind of chemical in them that triggers the ""I'm full"" part of your brain.  It's also strange because I love hi carb food. Steak and potatoes? 3 potatoes. Pasta or rice? I'll eat 2-3 extra bowls with minimal toppings. Toast? Whole loaf for me."
tall,3c93hr,davidtwilcox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"I understand, everyone love high carb food. I am a fast eater myself and I still have to work on it, but it's rewarding in the end. It's a matter of discipline, but don't be too drastical, you're going to discourage yoruself fast. Try step by step. It's hard, really hard to change habits. If you want to try it, go that recommended proportion: 1/4 of your plate is rice or potato, 1/4 meat, 1/2 vegetables. Doesn't matter if your plate has a lot of food or not, as long as you keep the proportion right. Try with a moderate portion of food.   Before eating, take 1 full glass of water, eat your veggies first then proceed with the meat and the rice/potato. Eat slowly and it should be better. If you are still hungry, you can take another portion of food with the same proportions. It keeps the nutriments balance no matter how much you eat."

tall,3c93hr,PrincessHumperdink,2,Mon Jul 6 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"Before we start making more recommendations, maybe you could give a few more details. How old are you (i.e., are you still growing), how active are you, and when you say hungry, do you mean growling stomach hungry or low blood sugar need to eat to avoid passing out hungry?"
tall,3c93hr,RememberMeWhenImDead,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"I'm 15, still growing. I run track so I'm pretty active. I am (fortunately) not diabetic, just my stomach feels empty ALL THE TIME. In fact, I just recently started being so intensely hungry. I also think my eating habits have caused so much of my growth, because for a while I was 5'9. What makes it even weirder is that both my parents are 5'7."
tall,3c93hr,RememberMeWhenImDead,2,Mon Jul 6 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say your growth is driving your eating habits, not vice-versa. Also, running track is definitely driving your hunger.  I was a long-distance runner until recently and during the peak of my marathon training, when I was running ~90 miles weekly, I was packing in around 7000 calories a day and still losing weight. Combining puberty with a track workout means you will be hungry.  As others have recommended, peanut butter sandwiches are great. Get the natural peanut butter, not the sugared up stuff. If you are working out a lot in hot weather and sweating, the salted kind is OK. Otherwise stick to unsalted. Use whole grain bread, like the spelt flour bread /u/giantJim recommended, or sprouted grain breads.  If you get tired of peanut butter sandwiches, grab some whole grain wraps or tortillas, spread some refried beans and salsa on them and roll them up like a pinwheel. Easy to make and easy to eat on the run (literally - ultrarunners do this a lot). Put some leaf spinach on there, too, if you want. It's actually a good combination.  Steel cut oatmeal is great and you can find the quick cook kind to save time making it. Don't get the fruity flavored instant packets, though, they are garbage food. You can add protein powder to it. It's also easy to make overnight in the refrigerator in a big batch. Make enough for a couple bowls the next day and you're good to go.  Another good way to stay filled up without packing on tons of calories are salads. Get a pile of leafy greens like kale and spinach (not iceberg lettuce - that's water) and then throw in tomatoes, olives, nuts and seeds (I like sesame and pumpkin seeds with cashews), and any other veggies you want, then cover it with an olive oil and vinegar dressing. The bulky greens fill your stomach and the olives, nuts and seeds give you some fats and proteins to sustain you (and convince your body you are full). If you want to make a real meal out of it, scramble a couple eggs and toss them on. That's actually a good combo.  It's pricey, but one product I've tried when running a lot is Generation UCan. It's a slow burning carbohydrate originally designed for people with a medical condition that prevents them processing carbs normally and it helps to maintain normal energy and blood glucose levels. Not an everyday thing, but it will keep you going for a couple hours and make you feel less hungry when you can't pack in an extra meal. I use it only because I have a medical condition that causes paralysis when my blood sugar spikes and it works. And, no, I don't have any relation to the company or get any kind of kickbacks for endorsing it ;)."

That comes with insane repercussions, because no matter how fit one is, there's only so much strain the human body can take, and Wadlow himself was even confined to leg braces and walking with a cane- and the guy was barely in his 20s. Even if someone grew taller, I have little doubt their physical health would be suffering. They probably wouldn't live very long, to be perfectly frank.

So tall women and short men feel inadequate and will often fudge their heights.   I'm not sure what people who lie expect. I guess they figure if they get a foot in the door, so to speak, their other qualities might make up for their height. I'd rather just be honest and not have to worry about it, though."

It's neat.. :-)  A few weeks ago we had a childrens' party, and the hostess ended up measuring the kids on the wall, which spilled over to the adults, and when we arrived (we're always late), there was quite a bit of anticipation to get 'the short one' measured.   I wear shoes with like no soles. Flat. A piece of rubber.So I take them off and go down *nothing, where most guys there wear 3 cm wooden heels with soft inserts added etc..  She measures me, and by some kind of miracle, I'm taller than two of the guys there (who now 'tower' me, in their shoes).  Never seen anyone scramble to me remeasured that bad.  People are really sensitive about not being at the bottom of the ladder.. :-)"

tall,3c5c9n,legitpluto,2,Sun Jul 5 01:42:02 2015 UTC,I'd say 5'10'' for girls and 6'2'' for guys.

tall,3c5c9n,thebitchrake,4,Sun Jul 5 05:37:13 2015 UTC,"For males, I'd consider 6'4+ tall and for females I'd consider 5'10+ tall. For my age I'd definitely consider myself tall. In my country I believe the average male height is around 5'10 and females is like 5'5-5'6 (based on surveys). For ""normal"" people, I feel like they would consider 6'0+ tall for males and for females 5'8+ or if they are simply taller than them if the normal person is a guy."
tall,3c5c9n,Zachyboi,2,Sun Jul 5 07:54:55 2015 UTC,"So women who are 4-5"" away from average are tall but men should be 6""?"
tall,3c5c9n,thebitchrake,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"That makes it more relative to average height. Average height plus a percentage is a better way of considering it than average height plus a specific number of inches.

tall,3c5c9n,Killianti,2,Sun Jul 5 07:21:38 2015 UTC,"This!  Though, while I don't remember how exactly standard deviations work, I feel like they would be the best way to compare between men and women e.g. Tall is considered to be +.75sigma or something like that (taking into account sex, race, country, hairstyle, # of pets, etc.). Or perhaps in my fantasy world of matchmaking, if I am +1.0sigma then my ideal partner would also be +1.0sigma. That way everything in the world matches up perfectly according to math and everyone can't complain /s  My stats teacher will haunt me if it turns out that percentages and standard deviations are two sides of the same coin. My gut tells me otherwise while my brain has no input to provide."

Height can definitely cause or exacerbate joint issues though.  By far the best way way to protect joints is to keep weight down. Of course that can be an issue for tall folks, who literally are big boned. The second most important thing is to strengthen and tone muscles. Properly trained, the muscles help support your joints. So general fitness becomes even more important for folks who are prone to joint issues than your average person."

tall,3bw7rn,QuickSpore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"This is all from what my rheumatologist has shared with me. I'm not an expert, just someone who has asked his doctor.   A guy called Hafþór Julius Bjornsson weighs 400 pounds and is 6.8 Why doesn't weight effect him?    He's in his 20s and he is in extraordinary shape. It's likely when he is in his 60s he will have worse joints then he would if he kept his weight in the 200s. But his massive strength is no doubt helping him a lot. His joints will likely be in far better shape than a man of similar height and weight who is carrying more fat and less muscle.   Does nutrition help?   Nutrition always helps. But joint issues largely can't be fixed by improving nutrition later. Once the damage is done it is done. The best nutrition can usually do is help slow further deterioration.   What exercises do you recommend for knees and wrists?   I don't know about wrists. Here's what I know about knees. You want exercises that are load bearing, not too jarring, and have a range of motions (lateral as well as vertical stress). So swimming isn't great as it doesn't put a weight load on the knee. Running isn't great as it is too jarring. Straight lifting (like leg lifts) aren't great because it is a single straight motion with no twist.  Walking, hiking, skating, skiing, dancing, surfing, etc are all great. They carry your weight. They don't have the shock of running. And they include a lot of minor twisting and other motions to strengthen all of the leg muscles. A mixed variety is ideal.   But any exercise is better than none. Swimming or running may not be ""ideal"" but both are better for your knees than sitting."

tall,3bw7rn,Mattpilf,2,Thu Jul 2 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. But I did say similar weight, not similar build.  A 400 lbs man with 5% body fat and a 400 lbs man with 50% body fat, are both still 400 lbs. But the man with 5% body fat will have a lot more muscle helping support his joints. While the man with 50% body fat will just have the extra joint stress, with no corresponding musculature to help his joints deal with it."
tall,3bw7rn,Upsidedownsquare,0,Thu Jul 2 19:22:57 2015 UTC,What do you think is a reasonable lbs for good joints? How much do you weigh?
tall,3bw7rn,grasshopper_legs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for knees... the less weight is best. So just considering joint health, you probably want to be as light as possible. Of course anorexia comes with a whole host of different health issues. So it's trade off. What would be best for knees isn't necessarily ideal for the rest of the body.   My Dr. has suggested for my build, which is slight, I should try and stay in the 170-180 lbs range. I've been too sedentary over the past few years, and am currently over 200. So I'm trying to drop at least 30 lbs, personally."
tall,3bw7rn,Usrnamen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"I could squat 1.5 times my body wieght(I was 140),  ran 50  miles a week,  ate healthy,  and by 25  was reduced to walking about 1-2 miles a day.  Some bodies  just get unlucky.  While mines a more extreme  case,  people fall all along a spectrum of joint problems even when they do everything right.   However  being 400 pounds isn't could for your joints. Our bodies were designed for animals around 140 pounds,  not 400. While you can have all the muscle in the world,  once your body starts deteriorating  and healing slower those  joints start taking a huge beating.   Also if your wrist hurts,  it's probably  not from being tall.  You can do wrist curls(in all directions)  at light wieghts so you don't cheat the motion,  but that's just very vague advice since I don't know what's bothering.   Most knee issues are caused by poor flexibility,  weak glutes  and poor stabilizing  muscles.  Where you feel the pain is very important  though,  as weak quads is also very common issues.  If you are having leg issues  though  slow controlled single leg deadlifts/squats/leg presses can help. Again this is very vague advice since I have no clue where you are feeling the pain."

tall,3bujkz,GrandBuba,3,Thu Jul 2 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"Best: The view, and being able to dunk on command.  Worst: Not hearing people talking to me in a crowded bar, and being cramped on airplanes."
tall,3bujkz,captstella,3,Thu Jul 2 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe the best is that I've never been the victim of any kind of violent crime, even when I lived in terrible neighborhoods and walked through them alone, at night, drunk. Height is only one part of the reason for it, but it is part. I just don't look like easy prey.  Worst: staircases designed for short people, people who try to recline their seatback on airplanes, not realizing that they're just grinding the tray table into my knees that it was already touching. But I get a little passive aggressive pleasure out of the thought of how frustrated they are that their seat won't move. And buying pants."

tall,3bujkz,GrandBuba,7,Fri Jul 3 02:29:22 2015 UTC,"Best: I think tall girls in general look better in most clothes. Also them long legs tho.   Worst: short guys being haters, not fitting in airplanes, etc"
tall,3bujkz,Jared-Steffen,4,Fri Jul 3 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"short guys being haters   I think you'll find this an experience-based 'feeling' in most of them, having been shot down by taller girls a few times.   Then again, my experience is quite the inverse: short men not caring one bit, average-height men (5'10"") being a little more apprehensive about 'suddenly' becoming the shorter one in a relationship.. :-)"

You get bumped into everywhere you go, there just isn't room for everyone.  I was getting frustrated and taking it personally (my bad).  I got so fed up that I thought to myself, ""The next person that bumps me, I'm dropping my shoulder on them.""  So, it just happened to be a Ajumma (Korean old lady) who bumped into me next. She pushed past me, I dropped my shoulder a bit and pushed her back.  She looks up at me like, ""Good hit."" and kept moving.    That's when I finally had the realization that they weren't being rude, they were just moving however they could.  Don't be like me, don't take it personally.    Do:   Eat Bulgogi and Kalbi Drink Soju kettles Have eggy cheese sandwich from the street cart to soak up some of the Soju Bargain for everything outside of a supermarket   Don't:   Be a big stompy foreigner wherever you're from Be afraid to bargain Expect traffic to go anywhere quickly"

tall,3bof95,mezcao,3,Wed Jul 1 03:10:39 2015 UTC,"Noooo, don't say that. You don't have to look a certain way to be a derby girl. I had never skated in my life until about three weeks ago. I actually only joined because a pretty girl on the team invited me to her practices, so I went. I have honestly never been made to feel more welcome in my life. Everyone is so nice and encouraging. I can't even tell you how many times I've eaten shit and had to swallow my pride and get back up again, but every single time there's someone telling me that I'm getting better and I'm a lot stronger than I think. There's always someone to give me a high five and a smack on the ass after I've learned something new!  Trust me, if I can do this, you can too. About 5 or 6 years ago the LA Derby Dolls skated by me on Venice beach and I think my jaw hit the floor. They were all gorgeous and in amazing shape and I wanted to be one of them so badly. It took me this long to muster up the courage to put on the skates, and my only regret is that I waited this long because I didn't think I was the right type of person to be a derby girl.   The best of the best all started where I did and where you will, falling all over the place and wobbly as hell. If this is something you want to do, trust this random redditor you will probably never meet and just head to one of the practices or check out a local bout. I played sports my entire life and I have to say this is one of the coolest things I've ever been a part of."

When you gave me information about where to find my local team I thought to make a joke about wanting girls with low self esteem, not to imply I'm a girl with low self esteem.   I still thank you, and I'll probably check out the local team thanks to you.   Again, sorry for the confusion. I feel like a horrible person."

tall,3bof95,VaguerCrusader,11,Wed Jul 1 03:23:10 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh yes. Everyone skates in a squatting position, like you're taking a shit in the woods is what they taught me. Well, my natural squat isn't that low compared to everyone else, so I have to squat a lot lower than I normally would so I don't get called for low block penalties. Basically my legs are on fire but in about 5 months I will have the nicest ass on the west coast.  Also when it comes to giving and taking hits, I have to get a lot lower to hit the shorter girls. Taking a hit without squatting low will send me flying and knock the wind out of me. The lower I get, the more likely I'll be able to absorb the hit and keep my balance.   There are advantages to being tall though. Longer legs means longer strides. When I get better at skating I'll be able to go a lot faster than my fun sized teammates. It's also a lot easier to side step blockers and step through them with longer legs."
tall,3bof95,VaguerCrusader,4,Wed Jul 1 03:39:29 2015 UTC,Yeah all that squatting and skating is going to really make your legs pop.   If you gwt really great at skating i am picturing you just jumping/stepping over the tiny people and not falling lol
tall,3bof95,VaguerCrusader,3,Wed Jul 1 10:44:46 2015 UTC,"I'm more of an ice skater, but can skate in quads almost as good. Longer legs really make it way easier to do a cross over.   There's a huge amount of carry over between skating ice and skating on quads.   I highly recommend you put in a day of lifting and/or yoga. Working on getting stronger muscles and better balance is the key to skating. Also lots and lots of practice, cause a lot of skating is muscle memory/confidence"

My arms aren't strong enough to support most the weight so my back compensates and I think that's what has been causing issues.  It's really a double edge sword, I can focus on lower weight and higher reps, but it won't build enough strength to handle the heavy weights to actually grow the muscle. I used the 5x5 and the ICF5x5, I really enjoyed them. But the gym I have this summer is really limited in the equipment so I can't do alot of what the program entails.

Personally, while I haven't actually tried to start picking up women or anything, I don't think it's worth it to limit myself to shorter women.  Indeed, they may be the most accepting, and aren't even inherently less attractive than taller women, so I'm not lowering my standards or anything, but I don't think I'm going to care too much about being rejected a lot by taller women.  It's probably in my best interest to assume I can pick up taller women and then be rejected, rather than not try it at all.  I'll have a better chance at attracting taller women than another short guy who assumes he can't do it in the first place."

If the answer is yes, then that's your problem right there.  You're trying to live the fairytale: go to school, get a job, marry, have children, die. Real life doesn't work like that. Being in a relationship won't make you happy. The idea that you NEED it will only lead to hurt, depression, and posting nonsense on the Internet about how you ""can't get a girlfriend because ..."". Work on your self-respect and making yourself happy, and the right person will find you.  Of course, if you're just looking for sex then it's different. Go to a swingers' club, or get a friend with benefits. But to get friends with benefits, you first need to get friends, and so I'll refer you back to my original reply.  If you take nothing else away from this, then just note that I didn't say anything about your height. That's because it's irrelevant. ""But studies show..."" is bullshit. These kind of soft-science studies can be manipulated to prove anything that the person paying for the study wants. Your height isn't holding you back. Your belief that your height is holding you back is what's holding you back."

Sometimes I feel awkward in heels, especially around my coworkers who are exceptionally short, but then I remember I don't care and my legs/butt look great so fuck it.  Besides I have bright red hair so between the hair and the height, I'm not blending in anywhere."

Sure, the basketball questions still kept coming, and the stares and whispers when you're out in public, but it didn't affect me the same way. By my 30's certainly, I saw it as an asset rather than a liability. For a long time now I typically don't even notice people's reactions, or if I do my response is indifference and sometimes I'm even flattered. Teens and 20's are the ages of insecurity, most people grow out of it."
tall,3bim5e,EveRommel,5,Mon Jun 29 17:22:37 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, I forget about it. But I can't say I'm really all that ""over"" it.   The one time it always really bothers me is seeing another tall person at a distance, thinking ""Jeez, they're tall!"", then realizing I'm as tall or taller as they approach. It's a reminder of what people think when they see me, and it usually rattles me for a while."
tall,3bim5e,blitzofzero,3,Mon Jun 29 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't generally bother me on a regular basis at all and never has. The only time I get self conscious is in sort of crowd behavior situations, mainly dancing, but sort of anything like that: audience participation at shows, anything where everyone else participating is doing something they would never want to be the only one doing but they benefit from the anonymity of the crowd. I always feel like I'm not really part of that crowd because I stick out so much and that's when I get self conscious. As for getting over it? I haven't. I don't dance, that's my solution."

tall,3baaoe,Mattpilf,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:39:07 2015 UTC,"Well, kinda. It changes from position to position and what kind of player you are in that position."
tall,3baaoe,TheScarletPimpernel,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"Women's athletes are usually at least just above average height (I think most women's soccer players I knew growing up were between 5'6-5'8, though I played rec soccer one spring with a 4'10 phenom). In the US, taller, leaner boys usually get shuttled to basketball, while thicker ones move to gridiron football."
tall,3baaoe,Mattpilf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:44:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry,  but you can't pin this on the tall people being taken away from men's soccer.  Soccer players are average height in countries where it's THE sport and basketball and American football or even rugby  are practically  non factors. There's only two position where height is an advantage in soccer,  goalie,  and some central defenders.. The rest of the positions it's a wash,  where you can be tall or short or average.    You can check the average height of teams,  is pretty much exactly average height in every country for men's soccer.  That's what makes it so confusing for women's soccer."

We were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, which was where most rookies were staying.  We walked in, to check-in, and saw Kevin Love signing autographs.  My friends told me to go back outside and come back in, so I did.  When I walked back in, all my friends came running over and asked for my autograph.  Thinking I was someone special, everyone left Kevin Love and came to get my autograph.  That was the start of a crazy weekend involving suite upgrades, restaurants comping meals, clubs comping bottles, and very nice young ladies hanging around."

I usually don't get too many height questions/jokes, so it was very different for me.

A waist to hip ratio of  . 8-. 9 is normal for a healthy guy. If yours is higher that. 85, you definitely  don't have wide hips compared to your waist.    2 centimeters of fat between you and the hip bone though is a a good bit of fat,  you might be happier if you lost some of the fat.  You can have fat on belly and hips.   Anyways even if you have big hips and butt,  if it's from muscle,  it's something to be proud of.

I would recommend looking at Flexsteel. that have some ""larger"" frames but you are probably pay anywhere from 1200-2500. They use a 1.8 density foam in their cushions, mdf frame, and blue steel spring system. I've had one of their sofas for about 5 years now. My ex ruined the front of it though by sitting on the edge.    If you want something that will last awhile and have much larger frame styles look at King Hickory. They have a sofa that I can't even touch my feet on the ground. They range from 1500 and up. They have a hardwood frame, 8 way hand tied spring system, and a 2.0 density foam cushions.  If you are in the Midwest try finding a Smith Brothers sofa. These are my favorite. They have varying depths of sofas and in my opinion the most comfortable sit. They range from about 1500 and up. They also have a hard wood frame, a metal spring system (that is a little different from an 8 way hand tied), and a 2.4 density foam.  All of those are American companies which drives the cost up a little bit. But you are getting a product that will last far longer than anything imported.  Broyhill, Bassett, Rowe, and other similar brands are great pricing (~599-1999) but a lot of the cost in furniture is what you don't see. They use a lower density foam in their cushions, sinuous coil springs for support, and low grade wood in the frame construction.  These will be comfortable for the first couple months to the first year and then degrade from there.    To test the quality of a sofa is to lift up one corner,  if it twists the frame construction isn't that solid. Ask what type of springs are in the seat deck, avoid sinuous coils. Is it made in the US or is it imported."

tall,3b6b0n,teethypegs,2,Fri Jun 26 09:15:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, this feels like a funny coincidence! Just yesterday I was in Specsavers getting some new glasses. Usually I've gone to smaller local opticians but this time I decided to try one of the major retailers because I often have a problem with size too. Especially the length of the arms, usually they've been way too short and end up perched on my ears rather than tucked behind, which then causes problems with the bridge...    This time though I bought two pairs that felt like they fit me perfectly! At least in the shop anyway, hopefully I'll still think that after I collect them. They had a massive amount of glasses compared to my past opticians. I didn't try any randomly though, I asked my assistant for recommendations and only tried the ones she recommended, so I don't know if that was atypical or not.      It's definitely worth trying one of the chains though, simply for the huge range of glasses they have available. You could even just go into the shop and try stuff until you find a good fit then buy them elsewhere/online. If you're curious both pairs I bought were from their designer range, one was a Jeff Banks and the other French Connection."

tall,3b6b0n,zak75,2,Fri Jun 26 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you'll have a similar experience wherever you go. Usually it is a bit of a nightmare with endless compromises on things like arm length, bridge size/shape, frame wideness/head crushing and so on, just like our usual clothes buying compromises.     It's even worse for me because the lenses I need mean I can only use certain frames. It's going to be great having nice fitting glasses again with no compromises, I can't wait until they're ready :)"

They were just too small, or my head was just the wrong shape! In the end I had to get some bespoke glasses made specially for me, they cost almost £500 but it was one of the best purchases I have ever made in my life, they look great on me and fit perfectly!   I could have had them made for closer to £300 pounds but I went all out with all the bells and whistles, super study joints, super scratch proof glass and lightweight materials and honestly from the moment I put them on I was in love!   They also have my name engraved on the arm! I have had these glasses for going on four years now, with zero problems. It is a massive investment, but for something that is so important it's worth every penny."

If neither of those make you feel better, I'll tell you my tale of being called a giant… my brother just graduated from high school, so to celebrate we went out to dinner as a family after. My sister and I had to go the restroom… now, the lock on the short stall didn't work, so my good 5'3 sister guarded the door while I went first. However, when it was my turn to guard her I busted one of these out over the stall door. I was unaware that another woman had walked into the restroom and was silently deciding if she should call the cops and put me on some peeping tom registry or just let it go. ""She's my sister"", I tried to explain… the woman just looked at me and said ""How tall are you? You must be huge to see over a stall like that."" I don't like being called huge or a giant or Godzilla… but I also didn't want to be put on a sex offender registry for annoying my sister.  That guy was probably an asshat or maybe just had a really terrible day and said something really ugly to lash out at someone.

tall,3auir0,gekarian,-2,Wed Jun 24 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"And you are definitely overestimating the impact these foreigners have towards Dutch genetics and the height statistics. Immigration as a whole has only been promoted by the Dutch government since the 50's and 60's after the emigration of a large amount of the Dutch workforce to countries like Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The United States has had a population of different races for a few hundred years.   Also, who are these Middle Eastern and other Asian people you refer to that /u/Shotgunjack1880 did not even mention is his post? I may be wrong, but the tone of your reply sounds like you're not happy with the current state of Dutch immigration.

tall,3auir0,blackinthmiddle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:01:41 2015 UTC,I think this short video really neglected nutrition. They mentioned dairy briefly but generations of good nutrition can have effects on height.
tall,3auir0,towehaal,-1,Wed Jun 24 10:28:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm surprised the video didn't touch on this very obvious fact. The Dutch are very homogeneous, where as in America we have everyone. So if a 6'7"" black guy has kids with a 5' Mexican woman, you'll have sons who are 6' and daughters less so. The average height for a woman in the Netherlands is 5'8""!"
tall,3auir0,blackinthmiddle,2,Tue Jun 23 20:58:44 2015 UTC,"That's not really true anymore. First we had a wave of immigrants from Indonesia, then the Middle East, then Suriname, then the Dutch Caribbean, and now the Middle East again."
tall,3auir0,nedertall,-4,Wed Jun 24 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"Right, but the difference is you guys are homogenous. What do I mean? So you guys are now getting immigrants, right? How often do you see people walking around in the Netherlands who are half dutch, half, I don't know, Caribbean? Or half dutch and half Japanese? Or a mixture of multiple groups? If your history follows that of the US, those immigrants will have children with guys like yourself and the next generation will not be as tall. In America, this is already happening. If a white or a black man marries the typical Mexican woman here in America, it's almost a certainty that at best, the children will be the same height but more than likely they'll be shorter.   So my point is give it 30 years. I think then we can do a better comparison. I work in NYC and pass through Grand Central every day. If I had to guess, I'd say the average white person is 6' tall and the average black man maybe an inch or two shorter. However, you have many, many people who have mixed ancestry. That, I believe is the major difference. Am I wrong about that?"
tall,3auir0,blackinthmiddle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but our average height would still be affected if over 20% of our population is non-Dutch, even if there hasn't been any mixing yet."
tall,3auir0,nedertall,-3,Wed Jun 24 13:51:07 2015 UTC,"Not to belabor my point, but our height is affected in two ways. One just from shorter foreigners being here.

tall,3auir0,tyeunbroken,3,Wed Jul 15 04:55:58 2015 UTC,"Amsterdam is for tourists, you'll mainly meet your fellow countrymen/women there. Go to Utrecht, same idea, more Dutch people, including blonde Dutch girls.  Further recommendations for cities: Delft, Groningen, Marken (if you want to see a really beautiful old Dutch town) and Zaandam. Interesting musea can be found in Amsterdam, Amstelveen (modern art) and Utrecht.  For tall blonde girls I recommend going to either student cities (Rotterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, Delft and Groningen) or really to the countryside in the south of the country (where people will be super interested in meeting a non-German foreigner, go during Carnaval!)"

Den Bosch, Eindhoven, Maastricht and Tilburg are the biggest cities over there. In 2016 Carnaval takes place between 7 and 9th of February, but usually the drinking and partying continues a few days in the bigger cities.  Supposedly the Dutch girls there have the most attractive Dutch accent (not very relevant for you :P) and, from experience, are also very good looking."

Instead, go to Passau, a picturesque little town on the Danube with a social sciences university. This means that 80% of the students are girls and 50% of the guys are gay. As I am bisexual myself, it was paradise. I try to return every year, but sadly missed the opportunity this year. The Oktoberfeste there are great, because it also has a lot of international students. You can blend right in!"

tall,3ay424,blacklonerthrowaway,13,Wed Jun 24 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a typical case of male restlessness to me, so,  First; Don't care what other people think about you, it makes you less attractive if your behavior and opinions depend on who you are talking to and what you'd like them to think of you. Also, don't base your own self-worth on whether girls want to date you, you live for you, not for some imaginary possible future girlfriend. I regularly tell girls that the clothes they are wearing don't suit them, even if I might like to sleep with them later. So far no slaps in the face.  Second; Lankiness can be fixed by doing sports or going to the gym, combined with eating more food. Note: MORE, especially if you are superthin it doesn't matter yet how healthy the things you eat are, as long as you get your vitamins from fruits and vegetables, perhaps even supplements. Eat pizzas my man. I am in no way an expert on diets, so you should ask other people for more details on healthy diets. This ""diet"" did help me to gain a lot of weight though, in combination with lifts and rock climbing. Also drink more water.  Third; look on meetup or something and find like-minded male friends. Note where I said male. You need some friends male who have your back when you fall. Whatever your hobby is, as long as it is not something like locking people in your basement, there are bound to be people who are interested in whatever hobby you have. Don't have a hobby? Get one. Hobbies make you interesting. Meet with male friends who do this hobby and expand your knowledge about said hobby. My hobby is for instance rock climbing; I have several friends who do rock climbing and I hang with them after rock climbing. Note again that I said male friends. Women are nice to hang with sometimes, but ultimately distracting. Also, don't make your race the essence of your being.   Fourth; Become interesting, apart from your hobby, do interesting things. Go on bicycle trips around your area to areas where nobody goes; go volunteer at some youth center; go take dance classes (<= Secret tip on how to get girls), go on trips to states/countries less traveled etc.  Finally; College is maybe the best time to meet girls, but also to get your degree. Don't forget that and blow all your time chasing girls, work hard on that degree. Become interesting and they will chase you."
tall,3ay424,tyeunbroken,8,Wed Jun 24 13:32:17 2015 UTC,"Also I note you seem to think that your height and race are the reason girls don't want to date you. Girls are attracted to confidence and assertiveness. If girls don't want to date you because you are black, they are horrible racists and best avoided anyway."
tall,3ay424,tyeunbroken,3,Wed Jun 24 13:44:14 2015 UTC,ya I have no racial insecurities so I just said that as a potential factor - of course everyone has their preferences. What I'm more getting at is definitely the height and build thing. You have no idea how bitter I've become when people give me dirty looks or stare at me. It's at the point I wish I was the height of more normal men (who I see ALL the time with gorgeous women)
tall,3ay424,A_kind_guy,4,Wed Jun 24 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"Where do you currently live? In most places 6'3 won't be considered really tall, trust me. Also, it may feel like people are looking at you, but they probably aren't. You can gain weight, I gained 28 pounds so far through just eating more and lifting weights. I was your height and 143 pounds by the way."

Also, if you can get protein shakes or whatever, they're a good way to get some more calories in, especially if you get one's that you put milk in."

tall,3ay424,tyeunbroken,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"Aha. Well, if this sub is anything to go by, women dig tall men, even if they are lanky. However, even more than somebody being tall, people note people's confidence. It is quite easy to see who is confident in his own skin and who is not and apparently these ""normal men"" are confident, otherwise hot women wouldn't hang out with them.  I know a guy who is maybe 6'2-6'3 on a good day who has a medical condition that makes half his face paralyzed. He doesn't exactly look like a male model and is slightly overweight. However, he is a) the best wingman ever, b) incredibly successful with the ladies (it makes me jealous sometimes). This is because he is confident, stupidly so. (I've seen him cross dangerous roads without looking around, because he banks on the fact that  people will go out of their way for him, don't try this at home.) I've wondered a lot why he gets all the ladies and I now know it is because he doesn't give a fuck. Actually, his medical condition make ladies approach him (i.e. he is interesting) because they want to know what it is and they stay because he is confident. Analyzing other people's success can also help you.  Confidence is the key. The things I said in my earlier post are things you can do to gain this confidence. Have a hobby, be interesting, have opinions you don't change for others just to be on their good side, take charge of your life, work on yourself first. Have a goal in life as well, something you work towards.  What you are feeling right now is felt by a lot of young men these day and age. ""OTHER people have it all figured out and I seem to be drifting around, hopelessly trying to get girls."" Read this article, it explains a lot about the world we currently live in. The world we currently live in is built on an illusion (I have to make other people like me, so that I can be a happy person with a fulfilling life) and advertisers feed this illusion to make you buy their products. If you become more autonomous, you take their power away and give it to yourself. A worthy endeavor."
tall,3ay424,bdlover80,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:30:58 2015 UTC,Yes I like the whole be confident advice - but I wanna know how to fake it till I make it. Just so hard to change your personality. I already try and walk up straight with my chest out. I'm just completely clueless about how what I'm thinking is influencing my actions/confident aura.
tall,3ay424,tyeunbroken,2,Wed Jun 24 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"I personally think 'fake it till you make it' is more about ignoring/coping with the things that throw you off than it is about creating a fresh new identity to present for public review.  Your goal is not to change your personality, but to allow yourself to display the best parts of your personality.  Most of the time it's your own conscience stifling your actions.  How often do you think about doing something only to have the voice in your head shut you down?  Probably a lot.  That voice is an asshole and you shouldn't trust it when it comes to being social.  It'll keep you ""safe"" but when has it said ""hey dude you're killing it lately, go talk to that girl because i think she likes you""  It could help your confidence to stop stressing over girls and warm up with guys.  chat up some random dudes.  or if you're shallow you can practice talking to ugly girls because not leading with your dick can help a lot."
tall,3ay424,bdlover80,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:12:33 2015 UTC,"Right now you are thinking that girls don't like you because you are lanky, this doesn't exactly give you the confidence you need to approach girls. This feeds into your fear that girls think you are lanky etc. Breaking cycles like this is difficult, I know, it took me a while as well (I am not sure if I totally broke free). The best thing you can do is cut out the girls, at least for a while, focus solely on you.   You are going to go to the gym and gain some weight and improve your posture. At the same time, whenever you are bored, instead of thinking about girls that don't notice you for some reason, you're going to read and expand your knowledge on whatever topic you desire. I advice you though to read The Enchiridion first, it's 50 pages or so. It was written 1850 years ago, but still relevant today, actually more relevant than ever. Once you gain confidence from improving your posture, you start applying to other areas of your life, including dating, but more importantly your studies. Remember, you are more important than any girl. If you're not already in a relationship, you shouldn't sacrifice one centimeter of your freedom to get in the good graces of some girl you fancy. Seriously, you need to stop focusing on girls. Plenty of time for that later.  I don't advocate faking confidence, because girls see through that shit quite easily. The best way to fake confidence is by appearing quite stoic, take your time to respond to questions by not responding directly to the social pressure to answer etc. By faking that it appears you have a schedule of your own that totally isn't dependent on her you can appear confident. Think ""You can come home with me tonight, but girl, you have to leave early, because I have shit to do in the morning."" Be specific and elaborate in the details as if she is an inconvenience in your schedule, but don't be a complete dick about it (you are actually faking that you are interesting here). Furthermore, walk straight, wear better clothes (better clothes don't necessarily mean more expensive) and have good personal hygiene.   Good luck my friend."

But generally, would you go out with someone who asks you on a date and already has a plan on where to go and what you both are going to be doing/seeing or one who asks you out on a date and lets you then decide what said date should look like?  This gives the impression that he really didn't expect to get that far and is now clueless on where to go next, at least to me."

tall,3ay424,DondeT,2,Thu Jun 25 05:03:35 2015 UTC,"Right, but he already has a plan to take you to dinner on Saturday evening. This projects that he knows what he wants.

tall,3ay424,devoutmouse,3,Thu Jun 25 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"6'3"" is a great height; you're tall, but not too tall. You're fortunate, even if you don't feel so now. I am 6'3"" myself. I understand what you mean by wanting to be shorter -- I often times find myself slouching around a group of shorter people. I tell myself it's because my hearing sucks, but it's natural to want to fit in.   It sounds like a lot of your self-view is externally driven right now. tyeunbroken has a good post with good tips, mull it over. Everything that you're struggling with has a solution.

tall,3ay424,Cyssous,3,Wed Jun 24 14:16:08 2015 UTC,"Just a girl checking in about you saying you never get checked out. Typically girls are more subtle about it than guys. I'm sure you've been checked out before and not noticed. I've ended up dating guys, or just chatting later on when dating isn't an option anymore and mentioned times I was checking them out - they didn't have a clue. I think this is more on your insecurities than what is actually going on.    Also the whole 'girls love tall guys' is exactly the same as girls loving buff guys, blonde guys, foreign guys, educated guys and so on and so on. A lot of people have a type and talk about it, a lot of people don't."
tall,3ay424,merlestreep,2,Wed Jun 24 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"I cannot yes this enough. Guys don't typically look for the tell-tale signs of checking out like girls do, so they often miss it.   Plus, at 20, you've got nothing to worry about. I didn't lose my v card until I was almost 23. The biggest bit of advice I can give is that confidence really is key... if you don't feel confident, fake it, and people will react positively, which will in turn give you confidence."

If you're that shallow, then you're going to have a hard time meeting a quality life partner and a higher possibility of being alone.  And I'm certain op added the ""dying alone"" bit as dramatic effect. He is merely pointing out that being picky over a small physical aspect will likely result in what I started above.  Perhaps my perspective is skewed because women often tell each other when they have a dumb excuse to not date a nice guy but I don't see anything wrong with a friend warning you that your insecurities could result in lack of a SO."

tall,3aviat,cats__hammers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:08:42 2015 UTC,"It can definitely be hard to gain weight when you're growing, I definitely didn't put on any weight between when I started my last growth spurt at 15 and my thirties, in fact, I lost about 30 pounds between 15 and 5'6"" and 20 and 6'3"". After 30, the weight just started piling on... I also was a lot more active when I was younger. It may also have a lot to do with your general activity level and your metabolism. But you should be able to gain weight, and the best way to do it is going to be to lift a lot of weight and eat a lot of calories. A whole lot. And probably double the recommended allowance for protein. You can't totally neglect carbs as you'll need fuel for your muscles as well as building material. I'm sure a whole debate can be had on whether fat or carbs should be the fuel, but it probably belongs in a different subreddit."

My parents redid my old bathroom in their house, so that after years of my childhood spent having to stoop beneath a really awkward slanted roof (IN A SHOWER WHY WHO DESIGNS A SHOWER WITH A SLANTED ROOF) there's a new, tall shower with the water coming from high overhead.  But I guess years of showering with the handheld flexible cord variety has primed me to dislike the tall water from the heavens model, because the water cools somewhat in its journey downwards and it just hits you on the head and I'm so used to having a dry head in the shower and wetting it at my convenience that it feels wrong.  Similarly, showers that have like, eight directions to shower you from feel weird and unnecessary. I'd actually prefer stooping to get my head under a fixed, low showerhead at my leisure than being assaulted on all sides by water.  Has my austere upbringing showering hunched with only the corded showerhead as an option against tyranny robbed me of these futuristic pleasures, or is there some virtue in the old ways and are these new advances doomed to be fads?"

The nightly rates for both hotels were very cheap for the level of quality ($165 USD, and $115 USD respectively).

Of course he wanted me to sit in small cars, so he took me first to...the Smart Fortwo. It wasn't bad! I don't think I'd get one, I'm sure there are tons of way roomier cars, but I basically fit.  Then he talked me into getting into a Mazda Miata."
tall,3aumu7,daxpr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"Mentioned this in another similar thread just the other day, but my 2014 Kia Soul is ridiculously roomy (both head and leg room).  I have my seat height all the way up and I still have plenty of headroom.  Fuel mileage isn't class-leading, but still decent. I get around 26 city and 36 highway, depending on how I drive. :)  Just about anything with tall sides should work great for you, but some other midsized and compact vehicles are a bit more spacious than you'd think from looking at them (Nissan Versa comes to mind)."
tall,3aumu7,Vectorwulf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:17:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of cars have gotten a lot better, especially in terms of headroom. I actually drive a tiny car, a Toyota Echo, but it probably wouldn't have enough legroom for you. I feel like my wife's Prius has an abundance of legroom, but at your height, maybe not. I haven't driven a Corolla in years, but that was one car that I just didn't fit in at all."

Most mid size sedans will probably fit you as long as there's no sunroof (it takes away 2-3 inches in headroom). If you can afford it, try a full size sedan like a Ford Taurus or a Toyota Avalon. If mileage is a concern, my boss (6'6"") drives a Prius C and the Prius D is even bigger than that. Or buy a motorcycle. Infinity headroom."

With the seat all the way back I end up looking out the rear windows which is weird, and no one can really sit behind me, but ah well.  You could always get a bike, too, if you don't have to move large stuff much. I've got an older one ('84 Yamaha Virago XV1000) and it's been great. I get somewhere around 50 MPG and can pick up groceries and whatnot just fine. Grab a rain suit (not much choice at our heights, unfortunately) and you'll be completely dry in the rain too. If you're somewhere where it gets REALLY hot (it's been about 95+ here lately) in the summer or REALLY cold (I stay warm just fine, even at highway speeds, but it usually gets to the low 30s, MAYBE 20s here at the least) it may not be for you, or if you're worried about the risk. I've heard about heated suits for really cold climates, but I'd be more worried about snow or ice if you need that. Then again, I'm from Alabama, and everyone knows how the south fares with snow and ice in cars..."

They bark at everything and can be very noisy when playing or getting good scritches. They can be sensitive with their feet if they are not acclimated to being handled and trimmed. They are herding dogs and may nip ankles and chase if not trained properly. They can have back problems and can get injured if they jump and land wrong.   That being said they are the funniest dogs.

tall,3ar6fi,cluelesssquared,3,Tue Jun 23 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty much sounds like my girlfriend. She's 3"" taller than I am (6'0) and only started wearing heels since she's with me too. Always being the tallest in class, being too skinny as a child, etc. has made her self-conscious about her height, but I basically told her 'fuck that'. The only advice I have for you and your gf is to start with the lower heels and work your way up. Of course it'd be nice to see her in somewhat more sexy heels, but she is (a) not used to wearing any heel height at all, and it would (b) possibly make her feel insecure and self-conscious all over again, just like before. My gf for example felt a bit awkward wearing 8cm heels next to me for the first time, so she sticked with 4-6cm ones for a while. Gradually, she worked her way up and now wears 10cm (4"") heels standing next to me without feeling awkward at all.  The thing is: when she's experienced lots of height-related insecurities in her past, the last thing you'd want to do is bring that feeling back. I know from first-hand experience that you're going to get quite a few stares and even (rude) comments from total strangers when you're walking in public next to your already taller girlfriend who is then even taller because of the heels. Unfortunately for us and all the tallettes out here, society by far isn't ready yet for taller-female-couples... :)  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that all the stares and comments from strangers might need some getting used to from your (and your gf's) side as well, so that's another reason to start slowly and work your way up. Because even when you guys are both happy and totally fine with her being that much taller than you are, the rude comments are hard to ignore. Starting slowly buys yourself time to develop a thicker skin, so to say. ;-)"

DSW, Famous Footwear, and Rack Room Shoes are usually hit or miss for me but I still love going there anyway because you never know!

I think this is fair to say, and although I don't think riding a dangerous train in Singapore because you're a tall female makes a whole lot of sense, I think you're better off in that situation than the 5'4 girl.    I have no evidence to support this believe, but I would assume that if you're a dude and you see a tall, confident female riding on a train line considered dangerous, and this female is aware of her surroundings and doesn't seem nervous, you're not gonna fuck with her.  The dude would assume she has a reason to not be afraid (either she has a weapon or knows some kickass martial arts) and would pick a smaller target.  Again I have no evidence, but it seems logical.  I think all women (men too but blah blah men are stronger) should always be safe and aware. Don't assume you're safe just because you're tall, but if you want to recognize the slight advantage you have over short women, go right ahead."

It's lower than anywhere else I've been, but the possibility is still there."
tall,3apcsq,supermariojuana,2,Mon Jun 22 18:03:12 2015 UTC,Yeh I know. Of course there is crime everywhere. I just wanted to stress how very safe it is. For some context I am south african so my crime scale is a bit different. Singapore is so low it doesn't even blip on my radar but I'm the type of person who is always aware and never gets drinks etc I feel if you are a sensible person in the country for a short time it is hard to find trouble.   I'm sure it can be found but generally I have good faith in the country. I would be more concerned with expats than locals.

tall,3apcsq,Breaking_Benjamin,29,Fri Jun 26 18:11:38 2015 UTC,I hate to be a Debbie Downer but your height won't help you if someone has a weapon. My Mother is 6'1 and was attacked at knifepoint by a man much shorter than her.  She played defenseless then beat him so badly that she cracked his skull open. My point is- you might feel invincible but you're not. Unless you are a bad ass bitch and know how to fight you may want to be cautious. Height has many advantages but it doesn't automatically protect you from danger.
tall,3apcsq,nickl220,30,Mon Jun 22 12:43:07 2015 UTC,"your height won't help you if someone has a weapon   Or even without a weapon; One of the worst things I see my fellow trainers do is give girls a false sense of security out there because they have their male students 'hold back' when training real situations with the girls in the group (or even worse, have 'women-only' groups.. sigh..).  Men are stronger. Really. That realization in 'my girls' is the one I strive for.   During an altercation, men will start out restraining you, grabbing you, bending your arms etc, and that's the time to get busy. Once you're in a full-fledged fight with a man (and he realizes this), you're going to be fighting a stronger/faster opponent, and holding back because you wanted to 'fight fair' or de-escalate (too late) is going to get you into bad territory.  I regularly get girls in my group who are taller/bigger than myself, and who've got that ""oh well, I'll just kick his ass when that happens, sister!""-attitude, and while that may work exquisitely for Drunk Jim at the club (I have enjoyed that sight many, many times..), it will be a very costly mistake to make when they encounter a real mugger, who couldn't care less whether he smashes in the face of another hobo, or that girl who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  We build those girls up for a few months (basic techniques), and usually they feel like they can take on the world. They can block-strike, groin kick, escape takedowns, all the basics.. and then they go on to the 'normal' group, where 90% of training is done in full gear (helmet with face cage, mouth guard, chest/shoulder/stomach/back/shin/knees/ankle/elbow/groin protectors, etc..), allowing the students to work at +/- 80% force.   Eye opening.   That 5'6"" guy who you outweigh by 20lb? He steps into our 'elevator simulator' with you for a 50% force exercise, and you end up on the floor with someone whose knee is planted in your hips, and who's beating down on you within three seconds. That split second extra it takes you to grab another guy's neck to try and land that groin kick? That fucker just picked you up and threw himself on top of you! That fancy technique I drilled into your head to escape a hair pull / elbow hold? That worked a lot better when the attacker wasn't forcefully working you to the ground, apparently.. :-)  That's when you see the girls' eyes change. If there's defiance in those eyes after a few of those episodes, we got ourselves a winner. If there's defeat in them, I know I need to recruit some of the regular girls a bit more to rebuild their confidence, and even teach them a few things they've learned throughout the years fighting men.   TL;DR: men are strong, don't fall into the height trap for protection"

Being tall has a huge impact considering I am still slender. This is all I wanted to let people know in case they didn't appreciate their height.

tall,3apcsq,wcg66,4,Mon Jun 22 17:43:58 2015 UTC,It's only a very slight advantage. Men are simply stronger and the average Joe has no problems taking you on.   I lived in Sydney for 6 months and never felt threatened. But my height and muscles mean nothing when a guy with a knife shows up.

I spent three months studying in Mexico, and not once was I harassed, cat called, or felt unsafe. And I walked alone almost everywhere, and took the bus late at night by myself, and such.

Shorter and skinnier men have the same problem as their female counter-parts. I'm 6'4 and around 265lbs. Not many people mess with me simply because of my size and strength. However, I can tell you from personal experience that I've probably lost as many fights as I've won (if not more).   The ""problem"" with attacking large people is that even if we are out-classed in fighting ability, we generally have a good chance of at least injuring someone in a tussle. I've known several times going into a fight that I will likely lose so I might as well get a few licks in.  (aka ...

That said, I love being able to back up my friends or intimidate anyone giving them problems just by standing up.

tall,3alcf8,minimalistperson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:18:23 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, just bend your knees a bit, you'll be fine. A bit coltish at first, but you'll get the hang of it. I had to wear heels starting in highschool for various extracurriculars, I don't wear them every day in my grown-up life now (I work as a dev so I get to wear runners most days, but I have to wear heels for work-events) but it's good to know to walk in them and have a couple solid pair that will last you for a long time. Spending $10 on a pair of heels is going to guarantee a not good evening, that's a promise most women can make. But nobody needs a $1k pair of Louboutins either. Not too high a heel, and not a platform for the first pair- those are harder to walk in. Oh, and not wedges, those are... yeah. I really recommend this pair, I own those and they're my favorite go-to pair. Not too high, bit of lift, and comfortable enough to survive a day and into the night in if necessary. And they're apparently marked down to $39 a pair, so guess who just ordered two more pair for when I finally have to have more? Oh yeah. Take care of them (leather cleaner and conditioner and shoe polish aren't just for the boys!) and they'll last you years, particularly if you don't wear them a lot. And since they're black, they'll go with most things- great for college interviews (you'll need them then) and senior recitals, etc. Don't make the first time you wear heels the day you're needing to wear them, get a pair, practice walking in them, break them in. It's obvious when a girl doesn't know how to walk in them or is in a lot of pain. Consider getting them in a half size up, and pantyhose should never be considered out of style.   You're starting your Junior year for HS this year? My personal suggestion is to start getting interested in fashion to some extent now, and developing a personal style of your own. Doing so was recommended to me when I was about your age, and it definitely helped for writing my college entrance essays, I had a better understanding of WHO I am and what I like. Silly as it may sound. I went into engineering, not the most fashion-forward of departments, but having a few basic ideas of how to dress myself well was incredibly helpful. Start shopping for yourself WITH your mom, see what she's buying and where, learn how to shop a sale, how to plan for mixing and matching for outfits, how to buy quality clothes- and where to get them tailored if necessary. All of that will benefit you so much in the long run, because dressing for you- tall, short, thick, thin, however your body is- is essential to people taking you seriously. Again, as a female developer I get doubted a lot, but I know for a fact that when I'm looking really good they take me seriously a lot more often. In my office I don't have to dress up while working, but social events, meeting clients, conferences- yep. Because I COULD dress down, but again, it's about earning respect and we get that through looking put together.   This is getting to be a novel, but if you have any questions I'm happy to answer. I was your age once, and remember it was HARD. You're young enough to get away with playing around and experimenting now, so use that time so you know what to do (and how), and what you like later! Wear purple lipstick, wear a different color of nail polish on each nail, wear crazy eyeshadows and crimped hair and colorful mascara and wild outfits and all of it- have fun! You're washable, and changeable, and re-doable. Experiment and learn what you like and you'll be doing really well for when you need it- for those college interviews and first job interviews, and beyond! :)"

When we met at closing, he said that the shower head height was the main selling point and he would pay anything for the house when he realized he wouldn't have to do shower squats.   Fun fact: the reason that shower heads are so short is that plumbers don't want to sweat an extra joint or cut down a long piece of copper pipe. Copper comes in 5' and 10' lengths. In most houses, the shower head ends up 5' above the valve for a reason."

Guys who favor arm candy over something more, who see height as a ""status symbol"" they might be lacking, see tall and beautiful from a perspective other than their own. What their social sphere tells them a person who is successful has to have as proof of that success is sometimes a lot more superficial than substantive.    The same can be said for some women towards some guys regarding superficial qualities, height being the big, inescapable one."

When a woman says ""I do not like short men"", she's imagining Danny Devito and not Usher. Men tend to have rosier views on hypothetical partners.. :-)  And it's indeed usually a height/weight ratio thing.  Most men will love a normal-shaped short-to-average girl. Most men will love a stretched-out version of said girl, adding only vertical inches and little weight (most of the time, men will like this type of body even more). Then again some men are going to be a little apprehensive about a 'scaled' version of said average girl, wherein both vertical and horizontal inches are added, and the weight is scaled up accordingly.  A wild illustration appears, it's very effective!  With my negligible experience in social studies, I'm attributing it to an 'offset image', where some guys just don't want to be seeming 'small' next to a 'scaled' girl, much like some bigger/taller women dread being seen as 'bigger' next to a shorter/thinner man."

I use to have a knee brace, lost it! You can also use tape to tape the knee cap so that force causes them not to go too far to the L/R. I think you need to strengthen the area as much as possible.

Our knee caps are meant to go up and down. When they go to the left or right that can be normal (?) BUT only for a certain range. I have zero to very little cartilage and other issues in my knees so I have to tape my knee caps so that they are more apt to go up and down rather than left to right. If I didn't, in certain situations, my knee caps does to the side of my knee or under my knee and trust me. You def don't want that or the pain with it.

Both of us have/had abnormally elongated fingers and legs, multiple joint issues including dislocations, and after he tore his rotatorcuff it never healed back up properly. About a month ago now my knee dislocated in my sleep. :|  I was seeing a PT for what he diagnosed as bersaitis that had me on crutches the week before I saw him. I can't really afford more therapy though, even with my mom's health insurance helping me out. His advice was to continue my therapy I was doing for my bersaitis and if the pain started up again to come see him. After being out of work since my diagnosis though I'm having trouble with any sort of medical bills. Mom can only help so much ya know?  As for hobbies I try to get out and play Magic when I can. Walking around just in the parking lot or the store is hard though. I've fallen over a few times trying to get out of chairs because my knees didn't feel like supporting me. So mostly I just stay at home playing video games and working on getting back into school. My last visit to my neurologist I asked her what I should do for work because a 15 lbs lift limit is a nightmare for finding entry level jobs.

The problem is (and I had this happen)  they see a young male,  and sometimes even a strong one)  and tell you lift these weights and strengthen the muscle,  often with a bunch of open kinetic chain exercises.  But stuff like lifting weights can be very damaging on our bodies and instead need stability and strength exercises. It wasn't until many months later they started me doing the right exercises that I saw results.   And yeah our bodies suck for  non desk jobs."
tall,3akqrt,Mattpilf,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:46:05 2015 UTC,"I was originally being checked for Marfan Syndrome, and that was because an ENT doc noticed how whacked my proportions were. It's this big chain of crap that started with an ear infection and ended with a diagnosis of nerve damage in my legs with a genetic joint disease. It was a little disheartening to go from doc to doc and having some new and exciting problem crop up.  I finished getting my ear all cleaned out and stood up. The doctor asked me to stretch my arms out and I nearly touched wall to wall. She recommended I get checked for Marfan Syndrome. I go to see a geneticist and she sends me off to a cardiologist and ophthalmologist(eventually diagnosing just EDS instead of MS). My cardiologist does an echo and puts me on a heart monitor. Heart monitor + an EKG detects some electrical disturbances so he sends me to a neurologist. Neurologist does an EMG and EEG finding nerve damage in my legs.  So I lost my job working at FedEx's main hub in Memphis because I can't stand for more than an hour or two max plus I'm not supposed to lift more than 15 lbs. Now I'm stuck with more medical bills than I thought I would ever see and I'm only 23. Feels bad, man. (that's not to mention the weight gain from lack of activity.

Ohhh and I got hit the hardest  in my family  despite  being one of the healthiest in terms of athletics  Don't let inactivity  gain weight.  Every pound of fat above 12% body fat is just another pound you have to carrey around on every movement and that stuff can build up.   Also one thing to check out If you go to school,  see if there are any disability  scholarships.  I don't know much on specifics,  but I suspect there's scholarships to help there.  Bonus stuff if you plan to do something to help people with disabilities  with your degree. Some student debt is better than a life where you can't work at all."

It's because [looking at your post history] you're slim and attractive, and six fucking feet tall! A bikini just helps draw even more attention to you.  Now, that said, we could do some basic mathz here to compare ratio of bikini to skin showing... e.g. you're ~12% taller than average, which means you have ~25% larger cross section.  But presumably you wear a larger bikini, which has a correspondingly larger cross section, too.  So, to first order, I'd say the ratio of bikini:skin is should be about the same.  But if you're slimmer, you may be wearing the same size bikini as a smaller woman, in which case, yeah, you'll be showing that much more skin.  ... so, yeah, we could do that.  But we're not going to, because it doesn't fucking matter.  If your bikini fits, and you think you look good in it, just wear it and rock that shit.  If you don't, someday an older, saggier, you will look back and curse herself for not making the most of what she had."

If I were to guess, I'd imagine if you look really good in a two piece, they're projecting their insecurities. It doesn't help you, but realize you will not satisfy everybody's dress code unless you completely cover up; even then somebody will still bitch about birkas. If you're wearing the same style swimsuit as the other ladies you're with on the beach and campsite, and they're not getting comments - you're doing nothing wrong. Wear what you have."

FWIW, my stripes aren't as wide as yours - more like 1/4"" wide where yours appear to be 1/2"" or so, but mine are closer together.  If you're self-conscious, I'd say not to worry about it.  As shown by my girlfriend, it's all in how well you embrace who you are.  Hell, if anything, they make a great conversation starter.

tall,3afper,jsabo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"I assume this isn't a shoes on/off issue.  Like weighing yourself, it's recommended that you take height measurements in the morning right after you wake up.  As the day progresses you can lose height as gravity compresses your spine. Could be as much as an inch."

tall,3afper,FireArrow133,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"It depends on how long you actually have been awake.  It's proven that as the day goes on a disc in your spine gets compressed which causes you to become gradually shorter throughout the day. This is decompressed when you sleep.  So for example, I can be 6'3 in the morning, 6'2 in the afternoon."

tall,3ahfhe,RememberMeWhenImDead,6,Sat Jun 20 07:17:05 2015 UTC,"Let's do a bit of math and research.  If we use the United States of America as an example, the Wikipedia page on average height by country claims that the average height of an adult male is 5'9.5"", and the average height of an adult female is 5'4"".  The men studied were, on average, 5.5"" taller than the women studied.  This infographic on average heel size by state is a little bit tedious to interpret since each state would have to be weighed by the number of heels sold, but I feel confident in saying that the average heel size is somewhere between 1.8"" and 2.9"".  Neither of these values make up for the average height gap between men and women.  If we assume that the length of the heel gets added directly to a woman's height, heels don't make an average woman taller than an average man."

Also, from what I've seen here a lot of them are on the younger side, either still in or just outside the age group where even if you appear exactly the same you still feel like you stick out.

tall,3ac016,llamalobster,8,Thu Jun 18 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"About 7 months ago you posted a similar topic and I commented with this. I think you should read it again. I don't think you've truly embraced your height. It can be hurtful when people say stuff but there is literally nothing you can do about it. The only thing I can see that you're doing with rude remarks in response to people commenting on your height is making yourself be very unapproachable and a bit of a cunt.   Some of this wall of text is relevant some of it not so. It's my experience about being tall that I know you've read before but I think you might want to read it again as a little refresher.   ""Stereotypically being tall is seen; by others, as a form of authority, power and dominance. You’re not going to get away from that.  When I was growing up I wasn’t the tallest in my school year by a long shot. I was a good 2 or so inches smaller than the tallest guy but after a school summer holiday I had one of the most painful summers of my life. I went back to school later that year as the tallest male in my year.  It was most definitely noticed by the others. People treated me…differently after that.  I am now a towering 6 foot 10 inches tall in a city with a population of 141, 870 and I’ve probably seen another 3-4 people approaching/my height. It’s a rare sight, and at 6 foot 5 you are certainly in that rare bracket for your sex. I was extremely self-conscious and I would say borderline depressed about the whole thing. My folks (especially my mum) wanted me to go and see someone about it as she thought I just wasn’t myself. She had noticed this change over the course of a few years and finally thought it was about time I went and did something about it after about a year or so of me not going out for recreational activities.  It is embarrassing at times having people comment on your height, your inside leg, poking you in the hips to see they come up to their boobs or their shoulders or whatever. “Wow you’re tall!” I started to work at my student union full time (as I fucked up university) and needed a full time job else I’d have to move back home. I believe this was the time I completely let my guard down and came out of my shell. It was hard at first as most people still had the gapping maw every time I walked passed or asked what they wanted to eat/drink. After a time I got so accustomed to it that I just learned little come backs to their remarks which made them look like assholes in front of their friends. I’d usually get decent tips from the others as, I guess, a form of apology but after those isolated incidents they tended to not comment at all and just talk to me like a regular person upon their next visit.  I am 29 next week and I couldn’t be happier with my height. Over the course of many years I’ve slowly embraced it. I now prepare to get comments when I go to bars/clubs/outside in general. It’s usually a great ice breaker for males and females a like. I get attention wherever I go, wanted or not. Some of it nice, most of it hurtful. It’s just part of being tall in this generation. No one would dream of commenting on the obesity of someone to their face in a bar, or how short they are. “Oh hey buddy… Woooooweee you sure are bald, fat and ugly!” Yeah that just doesn’t happen. Most people see ‘tall’ as a good thing. It’s just a shame that for the majority they don’t feel nor see the negative implications an off the cuff comment can have to someone who is tall.  Yes stereotypically males are attracted to woman who are shorter than them but it gets to extremes also. You stated that tall guys can go with any size girl. I can tell you right now from experience that that is incorrect. At 6 ’10 you don’t think I feel like I’m huggin a child even if it’s a grown woman whom I’m attracted too? It’s just weird. It’s all fun and games until you’re havin a braw wee bit of dirty fun with someone but the logistics of long limbs and short torsos just make things impossible.  Seeing as you are about 12 inches taller than the average for a US female you can probably understand that being about 13 inches taller than the average male in the UK we fit into the same bracket. I long for the day that I can even attempt to woo a lady whom I am physically attracted too as well as mentally challenged by with the added bonus of her being around the 6 foot 3 or 4 and onwards mark.  You’re really negative about it and that’s a shame. While you assume it’s easier for guys to be tall due to the ooh soo many options we have. That’s just your false impressions and what you think you see around you. What you are thinking and feeling about being tall right now in relation to love and finding that special someone I would hazard a guess that the majority of blokes feel that way too. We’re just generally not allowed to show it. Guys can get hurt and cry too.  I’ve been upset about stuff relating to my height before and it really got me down. I’ve just, over time, not learned to give a fuck anymore. People can think what they like about me. I’m back at university studying Product Design and I’m trying to make myself a better person for myself. Selfish? Yes but I really don’t care at this point. I’ve let my height hold me back from activities I’ve wanted to undertake, from people I’ve wanted to get closer too, from jobs I’ve wanted to try out, hell; even restaurants I’ve wanted to eat at because ‘people might say something’. Fuck them!  Yeah people will say stuff, get over it. Yeah some taller guys think they can get away with stuff coz they’re taller, get over it. Yeah some guys are generally attracted to shorter woman, get over it.  There is literally nothing you can do about your height. Either let it completely consume your life dictating what you can and cannot do or just learn to not give a fuck. It’s not exactly an overnight change and will take some time but the more you let people’s opinions dictate your life the less of a life you’re inevitably going to have.  From reading your past posts and responses in this thread you just care too much about what people think about you physically but not who you REALLY are. There are some people saying 6’5 is too tall for a girl. Who the fuck says so? Apparently 6 foot 10 is considered too tall for a guy some places. Just gotten to a point where I don’t give a fuck. And neither should you."""
tall,3ac016,h3adph0n3s,3,Fri Jun 19 15:20:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks again. I feel like a loser posting this stuff, but there really isn't anyone else to vent to.

tall,3ac016,hitcakes,9,Fri Jun 19 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I feel your rage and your hopelessness and your anger. I've on the ""being tall is horrible"" bandwagon for a while myself, but that negative attitude will fester and rot you. I try to tell myself ""being tall sucks but being me is ok"". It helps, maybe only a little but it helps. Because you need to control the things you have control over, and you can't change your height but you can change your perspective.   So am I justified in being angry? Am I totally off point by saying mean things to people?   You can be angry, but saying mean things to people is not a good response. Don't get me wrong, I deal with this shit on the daily myself and I've come close to tearing peoples heads off, but letting that anger flow through you and snapping just makes everything worse. That anger will stay with you like a bad smell. If someone is being rude call them out for being rude, but try make it about their behaviour not your body. Ignoring people is also a good option.    But I can't/ dont know how to stop that visceral, but pointless rage when I see tall men with short women.   I have a (male) friend who's 6'4"", super nice and always been very friendly/flirty with me, and was single when we met. I had high hopes. Now he's dating an average height girl. It's a thing thats happened to me throughout my life, and it's very hard to shake that ""im not good enough"" feeling.

But like I said, there are way more short-average height women than tall ones. It's pretty rare that I see women over 6'. I've probably only met 3 or 4 women that were your height or taller in my entire life. And you said yourself that you went out with a tall guy, but found his personality off putting. If all of the tall guys held out for a girl who was not only tall, but was also a good fit personality wise, most of us would never have a girlfriend.

tall,3ac016,CaptnYossarian,5,Fri Jun 19 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"I bet all of those women are single now because you couldn't tolerate other people's comments   The two I seriously dated are now both happily married.  I'm not some amazing ladykiller that when we breakup she's so devastated she can't possibly go on through life.  Sorry my comments made you feel worse.  It was sincerely not my intention.   tall women are just garbage.   I wholeheartedly feel there are plenty of women on this sub that would vehemently disagree with that sentiment.  Edit- I remember your username now.  You posted a pic on /r/tall a while back with a guy on stilts.  Dudes were tripping over each other complimenting you.  You're very attractive.  I don't know you, but looks aren't the reason you're having relationship/dating problems.  Possibly an attitude check is in order.  If I was single I would have absolutely been all over that."
tall,3ac016,limeybastard,0,Fri Jun 19 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you start suspecting when you never or rarely see tall couples.  I live in a big city and notice quite a bit of different couples, and haven't yet seen an actual tall couple (let alone where the girl is above 6ft), which is super weird to me.  I see tall girls enough where I don't have to gawk at them too.  LOL"
tall,3ac016,Tallbikeguy,5,Sat Jun 20 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"I hear you, girl.  I've been there.  I didn't unsubscribe from r/tall, but I did stop posting and reading for a time.  I got angry because I posted some pics and some folks decided to talk about how I was unattractive and didn't deserve a boyfriend.  Meanwhile, there were plenty of positive comments for the very gorgeous ladies on here.  It stopped feeling like a community to me.  I thought, ""Do we only support the people who are attractive to us? Wasn't r/tall supposed to support all tall people?"" I felt like my own people (us talls) were rejecting me, echoing the rejection I'd felt in the world being a woman of unusual size.    I let the anger get the best of me.    But there were lots of good members of r/tall... in fact, there were many awesome members, way more than bad.  On that same post where I felt bullied, several tall folks spoke up for me.  I realized there were a few tall asshats, but a ton of tall (and short) heroes in our little corner of the Internet.  After some time and space I was able to let my anger go.    I think you're justified in your anger.  It's not fair.  You can't change any of these things, but you can change the power they have over you.  Find a way to release that anger in a way that helps you to heal.  I like to go on long hikes.  Being outside and by myself, I feel peace.  I can let go of my anger over whatever when I push my legs to go further.  I can find calm in doing the things I love.  The mountains and the trees don't care how tall I am.    BTW, you are hilarious.  I love the legbeard thing."
tall,3ac016,mytoeshurt,3,Fri Jun 19 07:30:28 2015 UTC,"I let the anger get the best of me.   Sometimes, that is just what was needed at that moment. In the long run, a simmering is worse than a well-placed 'fuck this shit!'.  But as you say, after that, you need to get in touch with those emotions again and learn to discipline them. If you don't, they just walk right over you any time they see fit, and they will change who you are over time. That is what llama is experiencing right now. It's one of the shittiest feelings out there.  I learned to recognize this subtle 'shifting' in myself and fought it with all I had. It's simple, but hard.  Llama (and you, probably) will have heard every other platitude and well-meant useless piece of advice out there (same here), and it can cause a shitstorm in the face of the 100th well-meaning person out there. People cannot understand if they haven't lived it themselves, we've got to realize that.  Doesn't mean it doesn't suck at times, though.. :-)"

tall,3ac016,spinsurgeon,4,Fri Jun 19 21:28:58 2015 UTC,"I know I can't talk to the height, only just sneaking in the door of tall for ""tall"" around here, but having been an outsider due to my background (Indian in a rural Australian town), the ""freakshow"" thing is something I've dealt with before.  It hurts, there's no question about it. People with ostensibly the best intentions will ask point-blank questions they wouldn't dream of asking others who are ""more like them"" because they act out of ignorance, and you can't help your height any more than I could help the colour of my skin as a kid. It really didn't help that I was a tall kid to boot.  I was 14 when I moved away to a big city, and found myself within a crowd of people ""just like me"", or at least enough of a mix of people such that it wasn't remarkable that I didn't look like them.  That, somewhat, should be what you find here in r/tall. A community of people who are outliers in the mainstream, that understand what it's like to have those questions asked, to be pointed at or have photos taken by random strangers just because of your physical characteristics that you can't ""hide"". Hopefully you see from some of the posts around here, and the comments, that you're not alone, and shouldn't feel like it's a feakish thing or a curse.  As for the being single and not liking shorter girls with tall guys, you've got to ease up on that, no other ways about it. Average female heights are lower than average male heights, and that kind of thing is inevitable. You're calling yourself out here already for having that attitude, and it's good that you recognise it, but it's taking that next step and accepting it's something out of your control. I think I'm a good guy, good career, good prospects, and while I accept I'm no Brad Pitt, I'd like to imagine my humour and personality work in my favour... and while I've got plenty of friends (most of whom are paired off), I haven't had a relationship in a while now, and it gets frustrating as hell, especially as you pass the 20s and 'suddenly' find yourself surrounded by friends having kids. Doesn't mean I develop a complex about how people are passing over and finding people who attract them more... would love to meet a tall girl, taller than me even is just fine, but that's not what's around, and so I do my best to stay patient, put myself out there and try to meet more people, because you never know when it clicks.  tl;dr it sucks to be an outsider, but hopefully you can see around here you're not one; being single sucks, but circumstances can be to blame more so than physical stereotypes."

You can't do anything about your height, and as much as the problems it brings suck, you do eventually have to find a way to live with it and be happy.  FWIW, I always thought you were very attractive (particularly the Kitana costume! hellooooo nurse...) and likable, I'd totally go out with you if you lived nearby.  You'll get there; just like those neckbeards, obsessing over being single won't help, do you and make YOU happy and people will want to get in your pants.  Hence, find a good counselor."

I mean no shit, you probably know you're tall by this point 😀.  Ask them if they like that, or comment how it's awesome except on planes. If it's an attractive dude, remember the rule for improv - say ""yes, and.."" to keep the dialog going."
tall,3ac016,Krapintosh,3,Sat Jun 20 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"I suppose this probably won't be seen but just in case I will throw my thoughts out there.  I would say you are pretty close to the female equivalent of me in quite a few ways.  6'5 for a woman is probably about as equally uncommon as 5'2 is for a man.    You really just have to try to train yourself to stop caring about it.  I know how it feels to desperately want to be in a relationship and feel like its not possible because of something you have no control over.  Hell I am even all messed up looking from scoliosis on top of being 5'2"" so it is pretty much guaranteed I won't be having any relationships.  You really just have to try and find other things in life to focus on that make you happy.  If you just focus on height stuff all day every day it will just eat away at you and keep getting worse.  You are a pretty damn beautiful girl so if you can just get in the right place mentally you will absolutely end up in a relationship sooner or later if you just let it happen instead of trying too hard and focusing on height.    I was just as caught up on height and relationships as you for a pretty long time but I finally have gotten in a decent frame of mind.  There is no point being caught up on something you have no control over because you can't do anything about it anyway.  Might as well focus on things you do have control over."
tall,3ac016,Franzisa__,7,Mon Jun 22 14:02:35 2015 UTC,"I would not pretend to know what it's like to be you, but I can tell you that I have struggled with jealousy for a long time. I'm sure my privilege score is through the roof because I'm a straight, white, anglo-saxon with a full head of hair and slightly above average height, but I have always been jealous of others who had more opportunity than me. Perhaps it was because my parents grew up poor and never went to college, but I've always felt jealous of anyone who went to a private school, or an ivy league university, or was raised in a high class upbringing. I was really uncomfortable when I lived in Mass because everyone you meet there can trace their ancestors back to the Mayflower, owns a family home on the Cape, and attended boarding school before matriculating at Brown or Dartmouth. I still have these feelings on occasion, but I've found a lot of wisdom in a quote from Hemingway.   ""There's nothing noble about being superior to your fellow man. True nobility is being superior to your former self.""  Don't worry about others and what they think, as they are surely not worrying themselves about you. Instead, focus on being superior to your former self."

I hope that you're cursed with tall daughters and they're single because of short bitches like you.""   Why would anyone want to date someone with such a negative attitude? Short girls with tall men aren't the reason you are single. You ooze negativity and low self esteem. It isn't because you aren't attractive enough. It isn't because you are too tall. You are too negative and undoubtedly, it spreads to those around you. Anyone who frequents /r/tall has certainly seen your posts complaining about the same things over and over again for the past few years and it's just so tiring. Maybe I'm in the minority here but, if negativity is what the /r/tall community is all about than I want nothing to do with it.   I know it's not as simple as saying ""fix yourself"" or any of the other one line bullshit comments people are making. It's probably not apparent from this post but I'm all about supporting those in need but at some point, you can't help people because their will to change isn't strong enough. Instead of internalizing their problems and finding ways to overcome the challenges in their life, they project it outward which is the easy thing to do. That's exactly what I see you doing. Stop blaming it on everyone else. Find ways to overcome it and if you can't, you deserve what's left."
tall,3ac016,GeoffreyArnold,6,Fri Jun 19 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"I also think the reason the r/tall community isn't negative is that it's mostly male. Height is a positive thing for men. Hence, this sub is positive. If this sub were mostly female, trust me, it would be very negative. Tall women, especially 6 foot plus, are treated terribly by society."
tall,3ac016,icechalk,2,Fri Jun 19 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"People have struggled with much harsher treatment from society and achieved great things. There are people alive today who survived concentration camps who have a more positive outlook than yourself.  I would hazard a guess that it's primarily because they didn't let others shape the life they wanted and they certainly didn't let other stop them from achieving that life. In my first post I pointed out that you only blame your shortcomings in life on other people. You don't seem to be capable of accepting any fault in yourself. As I also said in my first post, some people are incapable of change and that hurts me but it's true. I have said everything that I can about this. You can take my words, internalize them, and possibly change your life, or you can continue to blame everyone else and you will get exactly what you deserve for doing so, loneliness."

There are things in everyone's lives that are out of their control. You can't control your height. You can't control the people you interact with every day. You can change the way your emotions shape the world around you. So let's agree that to be happier, you need to work on that part of the equation. So there, now you have a goal. There is a finish line somewhere. How do you get there? No fucking clue. You won't know either, but you can try different things and keep working on it. Posting your woes on Reddit hasn't helped thus far so let's try something else. Anything else. You can find new perspectives in everything. In meeting new people and learning about them. In reading a book on an interesting topic. I would urge you to find ways to surround yourself with people who exude positivity but please, don't bring them your misery. Feed off their energy and find ways to be more positive yourself, even if it feels weird at first.   The life we live is the life we make it. We can choose to live in misery and shun the outside world for treating us like circus acts or we can embrace the genetics we have and make a meaningful life out of it. It's a choice, and for some, it's a struggle but I strongly believe that the struggle is worth the reward."
tall,3ac016,Dr_Paco,2,Fri Jun 19 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"I may have a semi-relevant perspective: I'm a 5'6"" guy, and I have very definitely felt the same way about my height and relationships. There have been many dark nights of the soul (so to speak), where I've felt absolutely worthless socially...just because I'm not ""full adult size"". Let’s bypass the “short guy vs. tall girl problems” debate   About 7 months ago, after at least a year of really depressing and demoralizing dating experiences (and after 6+ years of being totally single), I met and fell in love with a wonderful woman. She's 5'10"", and yes her being tall(ish) is one of the very attractive qualities she has.   It's pretty obvious you're in a dark place right now, and I definitely empathize. Here's the question I'll pose based on my relationship: What if you met a guy who was attracted to you BECAUSE of your height?   I ask this because one of the pleasant surprises for me was discovering my girlfriend LIKED being tall (and liked being taller than me). While I may never actually like being short, I can feel like this is a quality I have that (in addition to others) she's attracted to. And on the flipside, as I said, I’m very attracted to the fact that she’s tall.   So why am I bringing this up in relation to you? Well, you have a pronounced physical quality. You’re very tall, and that’s something everybody notices. Compare yourself to women with very large breasts, butts, etc…it’s something that people notice, comment on, and maybe even creepily fetishize. Because of this, it’s something that’s on your mind all the time.  What if you met a guy that was attracted to you BECAUSE you’re tall? From what you’ve said, I get the sense that you want your height to be a non-issue. I will humbly suggest that this isn’t possible…not least because YOU think about it all the time. While you may find guys tall enough to make you feel “average”…your mind will always go back to being TALL.  What might help transform your thinking, is if you met a guy who LOVES how tall you are. This could be a short guy, an average-height guy, or a tall guy…it doesn’t matter. I can honestly say that I’ve seen a few of the photos you’ve posted, and if I were single I would jump at the chance to go out with such an attractive, complex, and yes TALL woman. I’m far from the only guy who feels like this.   You might scoff at this idea, thinking guys (especially shorter ones) who would date a 6’5” girl are fetishists of some sort. Again, I will suggest that women with other very pronounced physical attributes probably feel the same. Does the woman with huge breasts worry that her boyfriend ONLY likes her for that? The answer is that it really doesn’t matter, and being very tall is probably one of the bigger weapons in your attractiveness arsenal.   This may not mean anything to you, and it’s possible you’re just going through an especially dark time. Just try your best to keep in mind that while you will never NOT be tall, this is something unique, amazing, and attractive about you. I would even offer that negative remarks you might hear are as much motivated by attraction as anything negative. So seriously, be tall! Take more photos of yourself, post them, and be reminded how much people are in awe of you (yes, in a good way), just for something you’re born with."

tall,3ac016,Noirgheos,3,Fri Jun 19 21:21:13 2015 UTC,"Also, after reading some of your recent posts, let me add the following (which might be relevant to your current mindset):  I'm 34 years old, and my girlfriend is almost 37. Both of us flirted with the notion that we'd be single and alone for our entire lives, and both of us had experienced crushing heartbreak before. Neither of us had even dated anyone before our 20's (I was 20 before I had ANY dating experience...she was 24), and both of us spend the vast majority of our lives single.   I personally felt like my height was something that had to be overlooked (no pun intended) to find me attractive. It never occurred to me that a woman could find that hot (in a non-dominating way), AND notice my other qualities on top of that.   On the flipside, my girlfriend had the classic tall girl woes growing up (even though, yes, she's at the low end of the super-tall scale), and felt like she would intimidate any man she was interested in.  This doesn't mean that this will last forever, or that I won't feel compelled to post woes about my height on reddit again in the future...but then that's life isn't it? For now (for the foreseeable future), I'm with somebody who loves me for who AND what I am, and that will forever prove that such things are possible."
tall,3ac016,Tallbikeguy,2,Fri Jun 19 22:09:21 2015 UTC,"Let me be brutally honest here: I have looked at the pictures of you in your account history, and you look attractive. You are not among the prettiest girls, but also not ugly. Your smile makes you very sexy. If I werent already married to a tall girl, I'd date you. Fuck short girls, tall girls best girls.  In my opinion, your real problem is a lack of self-confidence. Thats what definitely kills any sexyness. Girls that think they are ugly, too tall, too big of a nose, etc. Drop those shit thoughts overboard, because thats what guys hate. Your attitude decides over your physical attractiveness a LOT more then simple symmetry-of-the-face. Know those average girls that get all the hot dudes? Its because they smile and flirt a lot."

When I was younger, I used to be a lot like you. I look average, I'm really tall, and I lacked self-confidence. I used to ask the same bullshit questions. I was bullied in school, and I thought myself ugly.  Then one day, I just realized ""Fuck other people, Im gorgeous"" and started to become egoistic, and bully the shorter guys for being small. When someone points out I am tall, I say ""Hell yeah I am, and I look good!"". I started talking to girls, and that boost of self-confidence started the magic for me. I got laid a lot, had a couple of beautiful girlfriends (who I thought were out of my league, when I was younger), and life changed in favor of me. I look pretty average, mind you, and I have even been overweight. (Not anymore, I started working out.) Its all about attitude. I have a very nice wife today.  Fuck the appearance of your face, thats just an excuse to self-confirm your mysery. You are sexy, you are atttactive, now go out there and stop overthinking your weak spots.  TL;DR: You're an alpha female by nature, since you are tall. Accept that and start showing everyone how fucking gorgeous you are. You cant hide and make yourself small.

In my peer group, (Middle-aged tall German) to get tall women with big self-confidence is considered the maximum life achievement.  It might be possible, that you live in an area full of assholes and small-minded people. See it from a pragmatic viewpoint: If I interpret this right, you consider yourself too old, too ugly, and too tall. (Which a lot of redditors said they disagree, me included, btw.)

Only one in hundred men is going to be just as tall as you. You said that you don't necessarily need to date someone taller than you. But I think the chance of having a successful relationship is higher with someone near your height.   Someone that can relate to the very real problems that being very tall brings. But as you have experienced, such a person is not easy to find.   At times I've seriously wished that I was three inches shorter or so. I felt that I was literally too tall for some girls to consider. But my height is not going to change and most of the times I'm actually quite happy with my height.   But it's still a bit of an overkill. Anyways, your current quite toxic behavior is not going to help you. All I can say is to try and accept your height, body and the in your case, common comments.

Why?  I found out that a lot of people here actually went through similar things as me and we could talk about it freely without worrying about the outside world always making comments like we are some sort of attraction at a fair.  What I've found though honestly, or at least for me, is that being tall is seen as a desirable trait and people in general want to be that way, so they ask.  People don't realize how rude it is because they've never been on the other side of it.  They've never had to deal with what is basically harassment.  So the downside is if you're rude to them you might as well the mega dick because you have a ""good gene"" and you're mean about it.  As far as the relationship things go, oh boy where do I even begin.  If you even knew 10% of what I literally JUST went through you might be glad that you don't have to deal with it.  But what it seems like for me (which is INSANELY frustrating) is that tall women where I'm at, don't date tall men. Also tall women don't typically share common interests with me, which can make dating difficult.  I know it seems like I might be bitching and complaining, but there is a reason, kind of.  I've been single for going on 9 years.  Yea, I've gone on a few dates, and yea, I've met a few people that I would LOVE to be with, but nothing has really happened (partially because I'm shy in a relationship, or they're taken, or they're just psycho and into my roommate [true story]).  Any way you slice it, it all comes down to I'm single, and I hate it.  But I've learned to live with it and deal with it.  Now, I gather that you're a couple years older than me, which might be why it's so much more emotional/difficult for you, I dunno, maybe not, I honestly don't know you personally and can only speculate, but what I can say is that instead of focusing on someones height focus on their traits.  Are they a good person, are they funny, are they into the same things you are, do they have similar life goals and aspirations as you do?  While NONE of these things are a guarantee (trust me) to a good relationship, they are a start.  They're a good jumping off point for one.  I would absolutely LOVE to date a tall girl, but I realize that that's probably not gonna happen, so instead I focus on their qualities on the inside instead.  I dunno, I guess I saw this post and saw how I was kinda a couple of years ago.  Hope this helps."

tall,3ac016,GeoffreyArnold,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"You're perfectly justified to feel angry, but if it's at the point where you yell at people for just asking a question, even if you take offense to it, you really should seek counseling. As someone who goes through the same height comments wherever I go, I understand being frustrated when you just want to, say, grab a snack and pay for gas inside and are greeted with a swarm of questions and comments. But I couldn't imagine going through life always shouting/making snide comments.  (I sent this earlier this morning but was apparently accidentally show-banned so I dunno if it went through.

But I completely understand how you feel.   The longer I think about it and see photos next to my super petite and tiny friends (or even average sized men for that matter) I begin to believe I'm simply too large for society. I'm like an image that got stretched too far, I can't fit one-size bracelets over my hands, my friends giggle when they have to borrow my shoes and they're cartoonishly large on their feet, it sucks. When a tall dude friend tells me they only date tiny women I launch into a tirade about how perverse that is, how they shouldn't need a tiny woman to make them feel larger. It legitimately pisses me off.  It makes me mad that my boyfriend who is my height and exact size in clothes/shoes/life still somehow makes me look huge in photos because ""women are supposed to be smaller"". I can't exactly give advice on how to fix it, because I'm not quite there myself. But I can say you're not alone. And hopefully we can figure it out so that our tall daughters will never have to experience this stupid bullshit."

When you are 40 or 50, you'll look back at those pics and wonder ""why didn't I have more confidence/pride/joy then, cause I was hot!""  I talked to my 6'11"" dad and my 6'2"" daughter about this (I'm 6'8""), and we all felt like our height made us stand out, which made us shy and socially anxious. But I would have loved to meet someone your height! One thing I'd suggest - online dating - I often searched for a >6' woman, and usually found no matches! Of course, maybe I'm unmatchable in other areas 😀.  Anyway, try to love yourself, do clubby activities that dudes like to do, and try to smile and make yourself inviting.

tall,3ac016,redditinab,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:45:33 2015 UTC,I'm single asf!!! I have the same feeling from time to time but I was able to control my frustration and anger..I think for the time being. It is very hard trying to find a mate that is taller or the same height as you but recently I have been asked out by so many short men that I refused and I thought I was getting a punishment for not giving them a chance..bc it's fkn awkward but I have come  to a conclusion to give them a chance. I recently asked a guy out that was 6'8 and I was shot down..I was so mad too. He later started dated a shorter girl prob about 5'6 or so. I also get so frustrated when I see short women with really tall men. I'm like whyyyyyy????? But I have to say since I've been traveling a bit there is plenty of fish that are tall. I also tried online dating and meet some really tall guys and you can also try r/tallmeettall. Don't doubt yourself about not being good enough because you are more than qualified!!! The guys just miss out on the great times they could of have with us. So don't give up!! We are in this together :D
tall,3ac016,Kill_Welly,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:48:27 2015 UTC,"So I'm a tall woman, and even though I'm not as tall as you, I think I can somewhat relate. The number if guys in my life who've said they like tall women is very few, and they've mostly dated women shorter than me. I don't necessarily think they're lying about liking tall women though, I just think that height may be pretty low down on the list of characteristics they care about, and 99% of women are shorter than me.   I also know that guys don't like people with bad attitudes, and most people seem to not give a shit why you have a bad attitude, only that you do. I've often felt self-conscious about my height. I've felt that shorter women can be more forward in flirting and it comes across as ""cute,"" whereas for me it can be awkward or too aggressive. I've also noticed that tall women more often seem to be the aggressor in going after people to date than do short women. Tall women have fewer options than short women or tall men, so this makes sense.  You mentioned that you had a tall friend who flirted with you. Did you ever try asking him out? I've really just come to the conclusion, for myself at least, that I need to step up to the plate more when it comes to expressing romantic interest, and prepare for more rejection, because tall guys are more ""in demand"" than I am, and if I want to date tall guys I need to compensate by putting myself out there more. That's just the reality.  I also know a couple of attractive guys who married tall women who made the first move, so it's doable."

Best way to fix it in clubs/concerts etc is to push the little flap of skin next to your ear into your ear canal thing and it blocks out the ambient noise so that you can mostly hear the person talking to you.

I made the mistake of waiting until I had a career and a house before I started trying to date, and it bit me in the ass, hard.  I have no idea how to talk to girls, and I'm pretty sure I've just intimidated the ones I've asked out in real life into giving me their number, because they give it to me, and then say they didn't actually want to go out.  Which has happened the grand total of the 4 times I've asked a girl out in real life.  As far as online goes, I send tons of messages, and not just a ""hey, whaddup babe?"" but an actual message that takes some time to think up involving a quick flirty joke, and a good question to ask.  I've gotten maybe 20 messages back, and a total of 5 first dates, with only one of those going past that, all the way to whopping date 3.  I've never apologized for my height, and have no intention of ever doing so.  At this point, I'm just weary, lonely, and bitter.

The power of positive thinking may not cure cancer, but it will get you laid. The bar scene is tough, for many of us it's the choice of last resort. Almost all of my dating came from work, with the odd gym hookup or friend of friend. Career is great, but if you're in a work environment that has little social possibilities maybe you should consider a move. As nice as owning a house is, it removes another chance to meet single people. You've got to learn how to talk to women (they're over half the population), make it a goal.

The only news here is that her knees hit the seat in-front of her.

Surprisingly little problems, the only one I've experienced recently was saying in an apartment temporarily and the shower head only covering my shoulders. It's a bit difficult to find shoes sometimes as well, I wear either size 12 or 13 depending on the shoe.   Growth has slowed down a bit (I think) but my arms and legs are still pretty long compared to the rest of my body so I suspect I'm not done yet."

I hope I am done growing and I think I am. Being tall as a woman, your problems tend to be more social than practical (except for those REALLY tall women who are well over 6'). It's just a little awkward being so much taller than all the other girls in school and taller than many of the boys as well. It's certainly not the end of the world or anything but as someone who is painfully shy in real life, I really don't like the attention I get because of my height. On the rare occasion that I wear heels, I know it's only a matter of time before someone makes a joke about my height and then it's all eyes on me...not good. So, I wouldn't say that I hate being tall. I just hate that everybody else has to make a big deal out of it. I just want to blend in, you know?"
tall,3a9urp,Chandra99,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:33:59 2015 UTC,"Well, people will always notice your height, but eventually you'll get used to just... ignoring that.   When I'm out in public, usually if someone is looking at me I won't know unless someone who is with me (my husband, my family or friends) points out that I'm getting stared at.  The only exception to this being when I went to Bogota, in Colombia... everyone there was openly staring at me. You could definitely tell I was a foreigner. It only bothered me when I was eating because I've always hated that feeling of having someone watch you eat.   Oh and last year when I was in Vegas we walked by a group of Asian tourist and one stuck his camera almost in my face and took a picture of me without asking."

I got a bit frustrated a couple of times in restaurants where I was trying to enjoy my meal but could feel eyes on me.   I can get why I was interesting to look at though. Bogota isn't that touristy... most people who visit Colombia tend to go for places like Cartagena with the warm weather and the beaches.

Judging by his massive shoulders and muscles I'm not surprised by the 66. The number is how wide the jacket is. It's like an XXXXL. The largest size I saw at my local Macy's was a 54 regular. The most common size was around a 42.  Then there are different lengths. Short, regular and long. My 6'5"" husband barely fits into the long and needs the sleeves lengthened often.   The 31 waist however is very very small for such a big guy. My husband is a 34-36 and he's pretty gangly. The smallest size Macy's had for men was a 30. Any smaller and we sent you to the boys department which doesn't work if you are tall. Finding a 31 waist in anything but a short length is really hard.  Basically they are making fun of Kronk's cartoonish appearance, however a lot of tall folks can relate to his ""weird"" proportions because they are both tall and thin in the waist."

tall,3a46ng,katielady125,12,Wed Jun 17 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"For anyone confused why that would be hard to fit let me explain. A suit usually comes with what we call a ""drop"" which means the difference in coat and pant size. Most suits have about a five inch drop, meaning that if a coat size is a 44(size around the chest) the pant with that suit would be a 39(size around the waist). That's why it's ridiculously hard for tall, muscular men to find suits that fit. If Kronk bought a non-custom suit it would come with like a 60 inch waist.  Source: I sell suits."
tall,3a46ng,peemorebutts,5,Wed Jun 17 06:25:13 2015 UTC,"This is why ""Suit separates"" are so popular right now. My Macy's store didn't even carry the regular nested suits anymore because people hated having to alter them."
tall,3a46ng,katielady125,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Although, for those of us in the suit selling game we absolutely hate having to go looking for the matching pants to a coat. Also, pretty much everyone who buys a suit should have it altered. If you're spending all that money you might as well cough up a little extra to make sure everything fits you impeccably. Fit makes all the difference in wearing a suit. A Men's Warehouse suit can look like it came straight from Armani with the right tailor."
tall,3a46ng,adSimba,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"It wasn't too awful at Macy's because they organized them pretty well. It was just annoying when they didn't stock us well. And yeah, you should always plan on having a suit altered. (And I'm not just saying that because I do alterations for a living now) Sometimes you can get close if you have the right build and the right brand but it's really hard to do unless you have a literal warehouse of suits to try on."

tall,3a2d68,Exener,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:06:15 2015 UTC,"Objectively speaking it's not, but I lack a lot of shoulder power. 240 is my best with an axle bar, which you can jerk because it's just a thick bar, so you can get plenty of leg drive in to the press.   My last comp had a log press for max weight, seeing as though it's a cylinder, , it's harder to get leg drive because a) if you dip too low to press, the weight shifts you forward and off balance and b) you don't get as much direct force transfer in to the 'bar' to help you press it. So I got 200 lb which was about 80 lb lower than the next guy in my division.  With an axle bar, my press is all legs and technique."
tall,3a2d68,Soup_not_Cupcakes,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:01:41 2015 UTC,so you're overcompensating for your lack of shoulder power with your legs? ive never heard of anyone jerking an overhead press - a little hip drive to lockout maybe but jerking is pretty extreme.
tall,3a2d68,big_shane,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:21:09 2015 UTC,"In competition, there aren't any restrictions on how you get something over your head. So the closest thing to an olympic bar is an axle bar, which is just a thick bar. It has no flex so it's a lot harder to jerk, but you can still put a lot of legs in to it and duck in to it, which you can't really do with any other kind of strongman press. Hip drive to lock it out is pretty much all you can do with the rest, which is why mine are so weak."

For reference, for the state finals last year the deadlift was 660lb for reps, so it's my best lift and I wouldn't be able to budge it in a for reps event.

The question should't be did she pretend to be another race. its WHY did she pretend to be a black person? Was she trying to gain the system and get benefits and sympathy? Or did she genuinley believe she could do more good for the black comunity if she was seen as one of them.   From what I can tell (I haven't looked too too much into it) it seems like she did a lot of good in the local NAACP chapter and did a lot of great things that maybe wouldn't have been taken seriously if she had been seen as 'white'

tall,3a8yce,VaguerCrusader,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"True. A college or business setting is a poor indicator of average height.

What I'm seeing is a lot more these days is couples where the girl is taller/bigger than the guy.

tall,3a4li6,Kryeternal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"I had something similar happen when I was at the local park. Kid comes running up to me and another person I was with, completely ignoring the other person, and just starts talking to me.    How tall are you? Kinda tall. How tall is that? Taller than you. No, I mean exactly. Like in feet and inches? 6'2""... Oh. You look tall. Um, do you hike here a lot? Nope.    Conversation went on like that for about fifteen minutes. We were walking at the beginning of it but I stopped us at a bench along the path. The kid was so fascinated by me that I could tell that if we left him, he would have no clue where he was at as he wasn't paying attention to anything else around him. I figured after we rested a little at the bench, we'd turn around and head back to the trailhead.    After a bit, while we were still at the bench, his mom showed up. Out of breath. Turns out he had ran off from her and she was looking for him everywhere. Also turned out he was autistic and yeah, he would not have made it back on his own."

tall,39q1x9,LocutusOfOrc,7,Sun Jun 14 05:23:53 2015 UTC,Sadly this chart isn't all that useful since it lists both maximum and minimum. An airline could have 10 planes with a great maximum length and 1000 with a terrible minimum.  A chart that had just the average for each airline would be better.

If a particular airline had the highest average seat distance I would at least be more likely to get some more space.

tall,39tvs9,AasianApina,2,Mon Jun 15 18:30:29 2015 UTC,I didn't eat any vegetables besides cucumber between age 8-20 and my diet was pretty normal. My parents are of average height and so are my grandparents. I've been practicing sports for the majority of my life but I've also spent a buttload of time on my arse playing games.   I still got this tall and I don't think any of the above statements have anything to do with my height. I guess somewhere in my genes there is a catalyst for growing tall but I have no idea where it came from. Maybe some ancestor of mine was tall or maybe it's just a pure coincidence. My guess is that there is nothing you can really do about your height besides trying to live a good and healthy life and see what happens next :)

When we fast our body heals itself that's why when your sick your not hungry even to the point that your body will actively reject food if you try and consume it. Only in the past 100 or so years has the eating 3 meals or more a day become popular. Even to the point where we are told to eat 7 small meals a day to ""stoke"" our metabolism, which is crap.

Making stuff here costs more and because producers can be close to the process (hopefully) we can make them better and more interesting. Bringing manufacturing back to North America is a good thing.

We will do our best to make them easy to order including elaborate ways to confirm you're getting the right size."

tall,39nym6,PraiseTheGun,2,Sat Jun 13 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"Indeed. The trick is in production costs and raw materials. Whether you're producing locally or overseas, those costs come down with volume (which we will get to eventually). As we get better value on materials this will also help.  Realistically our first product will be closer to $100 and once we get our sizing nailed and can access more materials the price will definitely come down. We are very motivated to offer a stripped-down/basic hoody closer to $70.  Consider that Lululemon, Sitka and Burton all sell hoodies at $120 and none of them are made in North America. Though Sitka might be bringing some of its production back. American Apparel are closer to that number but don't really fit that well if you're tall and not fat."

The cut of the fabric often seems to be such that the garment tends to shrink upwards rather than inwards, and I wind up with a sweater that is wider than it is long. I have a long torso, and a bit of a rather large gut (I'm 245lbs or so), so a longer shirt that didn't shrink upwards would be great.   Another point -- could the hoods be three-panel, like this, so that I don't have a point on top of my head like a gorram elf when I pull the hood up?"

tall,39nym6,biggred11,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Please make long sleeved shirts as well.  There aren't enough options out there for slim and tall.  As for hoodies, yes, I have several zippered and pull-overs and really only one of them is a proper fit.  So I would definitely like what you're selling.    Maybe consider segmenting your hoodie lines (form vs function).  Some people just wear them for their look (I'm in Texas and don't necessarily need them for weather purposes, so the cheaper $20 hoodie from H&M is fine).  You could sell those for $35 probably.  For actual heavy-duty warmth and wind breaking purposes you can have the higher dollar, better quality hoodie ($65-$85) is certainly reasonable in my opinion.  Let's be honest, tall people don't have many options, so your prices are allowed to be higher than generic pieces.  As a reference, if you're familiar with J Crew long sleeved shirts, I (6'7"" 165 lb) get Medium Tall and they fit splendidly, as they are both long and slim.   You're doing God's work here!"

tall,39hr92,northwest_reigns,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:17:29 2015 UTC,At home depot they sell a shower head extender for about 10$ and it would put it at your head. I bought one for my old apartment that at 6' the shower head coming out of the wall was chest height. It's ugly as sin but it works and easy to get on and off. My current place we changed the shower head completely to a combination shower head and detachable shower head and it put it almost too high since it was already the right height.

First gets you different food and service, a bigger luggage allowance, fast track through immigration (which I didn't get, because I should have only been in club). I know people who have flown in new first and paid for it so they got all the services and whatnot, and they loved it, but I can't speak from personal experience on that"

We didn't have height as a commonality but we had Sargeant Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band love of the Fab4 as our commonality and we shared a music player and headsets, the 3 of us.  Then on that trip there were 2 other people, one from Jersey and one from So California and they were both short, but they bonded almost immediately with the identical twin pair and me. Maybe I miss that or I have a weird obsession with short meets tall.  Another one of my friends in Canada is 4'6"" and into rescuing frogs from harm and saving them in safe habitats.

tall,399yem,cluelesssquared,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"Normally I wear a 10 or 12 or a large or extra large, but with LTS, I'm a medium, and there's a little room to spare.  The one medium top I purchased, was a little big but could have been longer.  This weekend, I got a striped long tshirt, a medium, and it isn't tight by any means.  I didn't try on a small, but I probably should have.  I'm assuming it will shrink a little, so that is why I didn't bother.  The tights don't shrink at all."

tall,394lvc,daiterne,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:48:12 2015 UTC,Both. I was 205 when I played college basketball. At 22  I went to work full time I gained about 50 pounds of bulk muscle from lifting cases at my work but over the last about 6 years I've packed on another 55 to 60 pounds of fat. I'm trying to work that  off now but it's been rough.
tall,394lvc,megasaurass,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:43:03 2015 UTC,When did you start noticing good bulk? I'm 6'9 225 and still feel like I'm pretty skinny (started around 170).
tall,394lvc,daiterne,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:39:23 2015 UTC,I gained a lot of bulk when I stopped playing basketball competitively at 22 and started throwing 60 pound cases at warehouse job. I was about 255 at 24 and in really good shape still.  Over the last 7 years or so I got lazy and started liking food and beer more then working out and put on another 65 pounds of fat. I sit between 315 and 325 right now but would love to get back in the 270s. I started playing semi pro basketball recently and running up and down a court at 300 is brutal.
tall,394lvc,megasaurass,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:47:55 2015 UTC,Yeah my goal weight is around 250. Although I've played 300 pounders who seem able to run up and down the court no problem.

tall,394lvc,ShortyShuvnstuff,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:26:45 2015 UTC,"I just meant physical attractiveness, too. I don't have the purdiest face nor an inkling about aesthetics/stlyle, but if someone shares your reasoning then I might get a boost due to my height!  I find that I am generally a pretty cool guy though my sense of humor might be a bit too sarcastic for some people at times and my jokes too esoteric. I've also been told that I sometimes forget the fact that others don't find some of the things I am good at as easy as I do which makes me come across as a bit stuck up on occasion, but I am working on it and am very liberal with helping people when the opportunity arises. (I am almost proud of how convoluted and run-on that sentence was; hopefully it makes sense.)  And we can share the burden of the downvotes together!"

Now that I don't remember any of it, here goes!  In regards to your friend story, my version is even worse: I am the guy who doesn't study at all and still sets the curve :P I'm just really good at school and didn't push myself to go to a more academically prestigious university (I go to a Big10 school) where I would be more challenged. I've really worked on not talking about my grades throughout my life and will only talk about them if someone else asks; though sometimes it's super hard not to be able to mention it to anyone as they all get mad when I've pulled an especially ridiculous grade out of my ass (""boo-hoo for you, Sandmaester44...... sounds like a reeeaaaaaal struggle!""), which is why I try to help out my friends/peers as much as possible. Those are the things I am much more proud of such as when I helped a friend go from averaging 35% on his tests in a class to getting a 3.5!  I guess I got lucky in that I am good at one of the things that we hold in such high esteem growing up: academia. Though I will never be rich or famous or particularly successful in my business or social life: I am severely lacking in self-drive and don't do well with meeting people nor do I connect deeply with people (I have plenty of friends, but the moment I stop encountering you in daily life, you are pretty much forgotten which makes for boring trips back home; luckily, reddit is there for me haha).  Which brings us full circle to hopefully my height giving me a boost in at least meeting a nice tall lady to become special friends with one day. We'll see if said friendship can withstand my full-force awkwardness!  Sorry for the long posts, this is the only free-style writing I ever do now that I'm an engineering student..... When comments get deep, I go long."

Heightism may be a problem in western society and it may not be taken as seriously as maybe it ought to be. There's a reasonable argument to be made that short people are unfairly caricatured as inferior beings in all sorts of media, and as a result that belief has entered the culture. This change should be discussed widely as the anecdotal evidence is stacking up that there is an issue.  HOWEVER-  That isn't what happens on /r/short. The good folks over on that other sub are so deeply entrenched in self-pity and self-loathing that they can't have any decent discussion of day to day issues they're faced with without resorting to sad whimpers about fairness and value.   If they wouldn't be so quick to decry ""WHY ME"" and instead ask ""why?"" they could almost certainly make better headway than they are.  Man sorry for the block o' text but /r/short gets me mad."

tall,3934ym,CaveH0mbre,4,Tue Jun 9 08:41:33 2015 UTC,Fellow pilot here. How do you like the stick compared to a yoke? I've only ever used a yoke and an curious to how different it is
tall,3934ym,jewcyrubes,3,Tue Jun 9 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even compare it to a normal stick.  The normal stick/yoke comparisson I can give is a C172 to a Sport Cruiser 28. The stick is abit more sensitive, but somehow very intuitive. I suggest you give it a try sometime, and not something spring-loaded like the Cirrus. It's fun.  This particular stick is special. Not in the same way as a short bus child, but not far. The A320 in it's normal law has multiple protections and a plethera of other nifty features. To give you an example, the normal pitch law is a G-demand arrangment, meaning the full deflection corresponds to the maximum positive load allowed in the current configuration. Plus it has autotrim coupled to the stick. So flying the 320 takes some getting used to. You more or less man handle it into where you want it to go. Short inputs and it flies like a dream. Fly it like you would a conventional airplane, fluid and with a constant input and you're over controlling the shit out of it."

tall,393j02,rhymes_with_chicken,3,Tue Jun 9 03:26:39 2015 UTC,I thought it was purely a social construct....not literally marrying up
tall,393j02,ThrowAwayBro737,-3,Tue Jun 9 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"No.  It's biological.  Men (heterosexual) are programed to seek female beauty and women (heterosexual) are programed to seek male dominance (alpha male).  This dominance can be acquired through money, social status, physical strength, and other traits that signal an ability to assert ones will over other males.  This is what women find sexy.  It's not politically correct, but it's true.  Male height (whether culturally or biologically) is perceived by most women to be a signifier of male dominance.    In our society ""tall"" is thought of as masculine, even though it's really just a neutral descriptor.  That's why many women here want to be called ""tallette"".  Because even though the word ""tall"" has no gender, it is strongly associated with males and so they add a feminine suffix to signify ""a tall female person""."

Even though I'm a cat person (I know typical lesbian) the dog approach is perfectly fine and for me it puts me a little at ease. The reason being dogs are very good judges of characters and for the most part dog owners (that care well for their dogs) tend to be more authentic and less creepy.

tall,38x922,Mighty_Cthulhu,7,Sun Jun 7 20:09:08 2015 UTC,The one thing I didn't like with a tall girl is no more of the girl standing on her tip-toes trying to kiss you.  I always think that's cute af.
tall,38x922,JefemanG,5,Sun Jun 7 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"I'd assume if you went with a girl in the upper five feet to six foot even range, you could probably still get some tip toeing but not as much back strain. So.. Pretty tall girls would still apply!"
tall,38x922,kat_loves_tea,3,Mon Jun 8 03:07:40 2015 UTC,"Aren't you still quite a bit taller than most ""tall"" girls? Even on my tiptoes I can't quite reach perfectly when a guy is your height, and I'm taller than most women."

tall,38x922,Edgemere,7,Sun Jun 7 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"You still can, that's no different from a smaller girl.  Sure, a girl who's 5' might be easier to pick up than 6', but it's not a chore unless they're fat."
tall,38x922,JefemanG,5,Sun Jun 7 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"You think? That's great. I've always thought tall girls would be better logistically but there would Be some of my favorite positions off the menu because I can't lift them, but if your experience is that isn't true... 😍😍😍😍"

tall,38x922,GrandBuba,5,Mon Jun 8 08:51:22 2015 UTC,"I mean it depends on how strong you are lol.  If you have a fit 5' girl shes gonna be like 115-130.  A fit 6' is gonna be closer to 150-160.  Not really a big difference in my mind.  I know I could still pick her up and toss her around like she loved, just as easily as I can with my 5'9"" FWB now.

tall,38x922,chattypenguin,13,Mon Jun 8 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"Because it shouldn't be a big deal. So he decides to live as a woman, more power to her. It's just the media treats it like she's the first one to ever do this, people have be struggling with gender identity and sexuality for ages and just because someone famous does it doesn't mean it's anymore acceptable (or unacceptable) to anyone. This will change no one's mind, at least no one who hasn't already given it thought. I seriously doubt some conservative good old boy will really change his mind because someone from Hollywood decided to change sex (it might just reinforce his notion of the place being ""hollyweird"") much the same I doubt it would change the minds of coastal dwelling crowd. She changed her gender for herself but at the same time that family will try to squeeze every dollar they can out of this media storm. It's so distasteful."

Duh gender identity has been going on for a long time but it's only very recent that we are accepting of it. Having someone be in the spot light and garner a lot of support helps others who aren't famous to feel empowered to come out.  ""There have been gay people for a long time.

When I saw one, I would follow them until they got to their car. Then, I would get in my car. I would drive in front of them, slam on my brakes and let them hit me. Then I would call the cops and tell them I was rear-ended and they were under the influence of drugs (which I would plant on the tall people/in their car).   I also took all my tall coworker's pens and jammed them up my asshole. Dude was always getting pink eye and didn't know why.

tall,38zk43,ingloriousmanterds,2,Mon Jun 8 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"Unless a group of work people has gone out for a drink, then it's acceptable to ask for someone's number at the event, but I'd rather it was subtle.    Personally I hate it when guys try to chat me up in the gym. It's my me time and if I'm trying to get my head in the game to put everyone else to shame on the rowing machine, or do anything in the free weights area, I don't want to be distracted, especially if it involves asking me how tall I am. In the foyer on the way in? Sure. At the drinking fountain after a workout? OK. On the gym floor? Only if you're Hafthor Bjornsson."

tall,38zk43,TheStormSings,9,Mon Jun 8 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"Just don't open with ""wow, you're tall. That's hot."" and you'll probably be good!  Edit: and yes, do not approach at work and be careful to read context clues...if she looks like she's on a mission do not disturb her"
tall,38zk43,mobopdx,8,Mon Jun 8 04:21:00 2015 UTC,"I love it when guys flirt at the grocery store.  A little eye contact and a smile, a ""I just can't decide what kind of crackers to buy, got any ideas?""  It doesn't have to be complicated, just be comfortable in your own skin.    And for the love of god don't slouch."
tall,38zk43,PrincessHumperdink,5,Mon Jun 8 16:15:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely don't hit on people at work, that's always awkward as fuck. At a grocery store is a little less weird, depending on when you say something. Like when im buying food im not really looking to hang around the store and chat to people, so I'd be less inclined to stop and have a proper conversation. But a quick back and forth would probably work."
tall,38zk43,hitcakes,6,Mon Jun 8 04:55:10 2015 UTC,"Women are all different people.  Each one will have places where they don't want to be hit on, but the only place most agree on is at their work.  Otherwise, it's up to the guy to figure out if she's open to flirting or anything else based on things like the circumstances, body language, and the local attitude toward approaching women at any given place.  It's not something you should think hard about.  Just be considerate, accept rejection gracefully, and don't take rejection personally."
tall,38zk43,Killianti,5,Mon Jun 8 05:02:08 2015 UTC,"As other people have said, never never never while she's working. Don't wait outside of her work for her to clock out either. She's getting paid to be nice to you and you are putting her in a weird spot. One guy waited outside my work for me once, then complained to my general manager when I told him to fuck off when I was off the clock.   Saying hello at a supermarket or anywhere you are both on equal ground is fine. Just be sure to read body language.  Just again, never while she's working."
tall,38zk43,chaharlot,2,Mon Jun 8 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"YES. God, I know this is slightly off topic, but it still astounds me how many people take my being nice (because, you know, it's my job) as flirting. No, I'm not that interested. Yes, you are preventing me from helping the others now lining up behind you.   If I was flirting, you would know. But you should also know that I would never act in such a way at my place of work because I really would like it to remain my place of work.   There are just so many times I wished I could have said ""fuck off"" if I knew it wouldn't result in some kind of reprimand.  Also, what's with all the creepy (usually older) men thinking it's okay to make inappropriate ""tall"" comments?"
tall,38zk43,pula_pleut44,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous. I quit my job a little while ago and actually am leaving for a month long vacation exploring Europe...but when I worked at my last job I was being paid to be nice to you.  I did room design. It was all cabinets, countertops, and flooring for the most part and it can be time consuming to do it. I'd spend hours a day for a month or two designing with some people. I'll never forget this weird guy who'd always come in. He was a big spender and always gloated about his money. I thought he was all talk, but he actually did buy about $25k of special order cabinets.   He still came in every day to see me, even though we were done with his order and his cabinets wouldn't be in for a few weeks. A few days before the cabinets get to him (but still way past his window to cancel without facing a 25% special order restocking fee) he corners me when I'm off work going to my car. He says he'd waited for me before, but my shifts were too long, so he was happy to catch me on this day. He asked me out and wouldn't take no for an answer. He actually tried to get in the passenger side of my car! Luckily it was locked. So I told him to fuck off as I drove off.   I go into work the next day to find out he complained to my manager and wants to return the cabinets. Luckily, my manager loved me. The guy wasn't able to return the cabinets and I never saw him again.   And yeah, it's always the older creepy guys. This guy happened to be a bit shorter than me and would joke while I was designing his countertops (which he never came in to buy) that I'd need to hug him after all his purchases to thank him. He said it with the creepiest wink. Ugh. I told him straight-faced that we don't work on commission here but he's welcome to get a hug from my general manager.  I'm sure this post is a novel. But god. Creeps gonna creep."
tall,38zk43,chaharlot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:07:18 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm leaving my job soon to bop around NZ and Australia, and then go back to school! Hopefully at my next job I won't have to put up with this shit.   I totally get it; sometimes you just need to vent. Had a creeper linger while I was trying to close up and go home; he kept asking me to go to movies, even when I blatantly said that I was not interested. Then, when I excused myself to go to the restroom (poor move, but I really had to go), he then mistook that as an invitation to follow me into the restroom. I only know this because I heard someone come in right after me and go into the stall two down from me, and as I washed up and left, I saw his shoes peeking out underneath. I should have cussed that bastard out, but I was so unnerved I just went back to my station and finished closing up shop and then got the fuck outta there. Haven't seen him since, but just in case, I carry mace around since he could have easily deduced what time I was off work, and I really don't want to take my chances.   God, I'm so ready for a vacation. Enjoy Europe!"
tall,38zk43,pula_pleut44,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:19:17 2015 UTC,"You can say ""hello"" to someone any time, just don't press your attentions on women who are not interested. I wouldn't want to stop and talk to a strange man in a grocery store just because he was interested in one or more of my physical traits. Women, no matter what they look like, usually are just trying to get their errands done in those situations. If you really want to meet a tall woman, try online dating with height filters. A tall woman is no more likely to be single than anyone else."

tall,38qgon,vudewNL,6,Fri Jun 5 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"I am not a tall guy, but I kind of get where you're coming from. I don't encounter women taller than me too often, maybe, like you, every other month or two. I don't think, for me at least, it's intimidation, more just awe. It doesn't matter whatever features the woman has, she can have three eyes or a beak (obviously I am exaggerating), finding a woman taller than myself seems anomaly enough! I then proceed to geek out and try to measure myself against her, standing straight as can be to ensure she is in fact taller. Then, since I am somewhat insecure about my height at times, walk away with a smile thinking ""I just saw some awesome girl. If she can be awesome at that height, I can be awesome at mine.""  Also, I will be heading to the Netherlands in a few weeks. I look forward to feeling short most of the time."
tall,38qgon,chaharlot,2,Sat Jun 6 03:27:58 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there aren't that many women over 6 feet in The Netherlands though. It's still rare. But most guys are over 6 feet so in that regard you will be looking up. If you go on a tall-spotting hunt you can definitely spot women taller than you daily though.
tall,38qgon,_J_J_,7,Sat Jun 6 11:52:26 2015 UTC,One of the odd things about finding someone taller than me is literally looking up at them.  I'm so used to looking slightly down to talk with people that it feels incredibly odd having to look up to talk to them.  My university has a 7'2 man who works at one of the little fast food joints on campus and its especially weird looking that far up to talk with him.  I have a brother who is 6'5 but besides him I can go weeks or months without seeing someone 3-4+ inches taller than me.  Yes it feels weird.
tall,38qgon,komnenos,5,Sat Jun 6 02:29:05 2015 UTC,I don't know why but I hate when someone's taller than me. I don't get nervous or afraid or anything but it's more of a somewhat jealousy I think.

I think the feeling you have isn't intimidation so much as losing something that makes you special. You've always had to deal with your height and the moment you're not the tallest in the room, it seems like it was all for nothing.

In a way, I think that being taller than most people I see makes me rather passive, because I don't want to intimidate others, but when I see someone around the same height and taller, I feel like I should suddenly try to be more assertive, something, which is odd, and then I try to behave normally, but thinking to force yourself to behave normally is probably when I'm weirdest by accident."

Society doesn't say muscles=more affluence, muscles only maybe mean more sex appeal but not necessarily more status or respect.   am i just behaving like some primitive ape?   probably not since Apes in Ape societies will defer to more socially dominant males even if they are smaller"

tall,38qgon,jm434,2,Sat Jun 6 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"I do. It isn't like a conscious thing its just what you subconciously do when you see someone for the first time. Think of a life time of people congratulating you on your height. Telling kids to eat their veggies so they can grow tall and measuring kids heights every day. All this adds up to make you believe taller is inherently better no question.  Harvard had this thing called the ""negative association"" test where people are given pictures of different types of people/words ranging from gay, black, asian, etc to test whether they associate the words/people with positive or negative and it found that the majority of people have at least a little subconcious biases against people who are black or gay.  Short and tall was one of them for a while and the association of short=bad was just as strong as the one against black but the short/tall association test was promptly removed from harvard's website after only a few months of use."

He asks my age and then wants me to guess his, he has youthful features and I reckon he's younger than me so I peg him as 22.  Well after some back and forth it turns out he's 18 (showed me his license). I just stand their flabbergasted this kid who's younger than my brother received the dutch genetic lottery and is over 6ft at 18.

A large portion of the guys on this sub will tell you that they were over 6' well before 18. Growth spurts happen at different ages and some guys continue growing later but a large portion of growth happens closer to the beginning and during the middle of puberty rather than all at the end (YMMV). I was 6' at 14 and 6'3.5"" by 16. I slowly crept up after that to my current height at 21.  There are multiple threads on this sub about how people grew throughout their lives if it interests you."

And I don't remember so much growth spurts specifically as pretty much constantly growing and being the tallest of my grade up through junior high/middle school. It wasn't unhealthy at all and I am actually on the shorter end of /r/tall with many taller peope having grown in a healthy manner (barring growing pains here and there)."

I tend to tune these types of posts out and just look at the interesting stuff, on both /r/tall and /r/short :)  Seems reasonable enough, I guess only the extremely tall have issues, I know that when you hit gigantism it becomes a serious health issue.

tall,38idxd,komnenos,2,Sat Jun 6 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"Haha no worries mate.  We're both training to be professional dancers so we met in class and started hanging out/dating shortly after.  Unfortunately I'm just as curious about the sex part as you. She's from a very conservative area of rural china where physical contact between the sexes isn't really a thing. She's never seen her parents kiss before, even in their wedding photos, and holding hands with me is the first contact she's ever had with a male. So I won't be pushing the sex part too hard for a while haha."

tall,38idxd,Shagoosty,4,Thu Jun 4 20:19:34 2015 UTC,So I have horrible knees. What can I do other than squats because after a day or two my knees swell.
tall,38idxd,nike143er,2,Fri Jun 5 03:43:40 2015 UTC,"Do you know if there's something medically wrong with your knees? They may just be undermuscled and not up to the strain of squatting yet. Do some other leg stuff, running and start off light and slow with squatting. My right knee is pretty undermuscled from light repetitive damage and squatting light along with regular exercise has helped. If its feeling really strained I throw my brace on but try to avoid it as much as possible to build muscle."
tall,38idxd,thisiswhyifail,5,Fri Jun 5 04:01:34 2015 UTC,"ACL surgery and also my knees def don't have muscle because the tendons, kneecaps don't go up and down when moving, they go side to side. This has caused me to have almost no cartilage and lots of damage (knee caps constantly going out of place) to the point where I have to ice my knees after any type of work out or long hike (mountains). My fav weight machine is where you sit down with your legs in an upside down L and you push the weight (like squats but it works your thighs), even after doing this machine, I have to wait for 10 or so minutes because I won't be able to walk due to my knees being in pain. Doctors said to tape the knees but nothing helps. Not even a brace!"

Edit: This probably got glanced over like I was saying short women are sexier as if curvy is the only a way a women looks beautiful.

I recently met some of her family (she has 7 siblings) at a dinner and the tallest of her brothers is maybe 5'9.

I just work the evenings for the full time secretary so I have to use HER desk and HER computer because they are right next to the phone/switchboard. I honestly can't see a feasible solution that wouldn't cost them way more money than I'm worth. They are already firing people and cutting hours. If they had to set me up at a separate desk, computer and switchboard and find someplace to put it all too, they may as well just get rid of me and hire a short person who won't complain."

I casually counted the money as I walked back to the car. Once inside my sister asked me if I was crazy. Counting the money like that. What if someone wanted to mug me. I laughed, I'm a huge guy and honestly I think even if there was a mugger they would see me and think ""maybe the next guy"". That was the moment I realized the mugger would be waiting for someone like my sister.   So while I walk around confident that eve if a criminal were to be around me, that they would wait for someone else to steal from.

Being a ""huge guy"" is nice and all but if the person who wants your money has a gun...you lose. While I agree that in general a criminal goes for an easier target, they will definitely go after someone who looks like they're carrying a substantial amount of cash.

tall,38egzt,Chandra99,2,Thu Jun 4 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"honestly I think even if there was a mugger they would see me and think ""maybe the next guy"".   This is a really dangerous mindset if you live in a less 'ideal' neighbourhood. Someone coming up to you and knifing you without warning, size/sex won't make any difference.   If anything, that kind of attack is more likely to happen to you because of the attackers' expectation of the mugging.  Your sister will have her money taken, shoved/hit, and that'll be 'enough' for the attacker to safely take her money. When he sees you with that kind of cash, more drastic measures seem necessary in his mind (knifing)."

tall,38egzt,marumarmar,3,Wed Jun 3 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"/u/GrandBuba is pointing out that many women, short and tall, don't see protection as a deal breaker aspect. Height has nothing to do with basic trust and comfort (i.e. a tall guy isn't fundamentally more safe to be around than a short guy) and women, at least in my experience (you know, form talking to them, being one...), don't think of guys as ""protectors""—we don't look for that characteristic in our partners.   While the idea that a woman needs your protection may make you feel manly, this whole question and conversation seems to be more about your preference for women to see you as a protector and less with how women connect that idea to height.   TL;DR: yeah, a taller/buffer guy is going to seem like a more capable guardian that a short/scrawny guy, but most women aren't looking for protectors and don't view SOs and potential partners that way."

Oh, and by the way: people should stop seeing women as totally defenceless. My gf is perfectly able to defend herself if needed, as much as I am able to defend her and myself.

This however has very little impact on the capacity of women to perform in sport.""  ... and you want me to take this as a serious reference?  On the other hand, I was basing my comments on what my mom told me when I was a kid.  Looking for a more scientific source, I have found my copy of ""The Theory of Garment - Pattern Making - A Textbook for Clothing Designers, Teachers of Clothing Technology, and Senior Students"" by Hulme, 1944, who based everything on a ton of statistics taken on WWI soldiers.  He says, ""Basing the height of the proportionate woman on 7-3/4 heads, 4 heads will  be taken up by head and trunk, 3-3/4 by the legs.  In the male this ratio is reversed.  In terms of the human figure these proportions mean that the legs are both actually and relatively shorter, and the body relatively longer, than the male.""  TL;DR I was wrong, you were right, but your reference sucks."
tall,3860aw,kirsten_mc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:37:23 2015 UTC,Women's brains don't weigh as much. That doesn't imply women are dumber though. WebMD even says male brains are larger. Sorry if an anatomical fact is somehow offensive.

So, now we are debating the scientific value of your reference?  a. statistics, values, and all statements are not properly referenced.  A list at the end is not good enough, particularly when quoting values.  b. statistics do not have proper scientific notation.  Why are you using ±, which usually means this is an error measurement, in front of all the values?  Are you trying to indicate a statistical basis?  And in that case, why flipping between ranges and discrete values?  c. Honestly, is there scientific basis for the statement that a smaller brain is better or worse when it comes to athletic performance?  I'm actually fine with it being an advantage or disadvantage, but please give me actual evidence either way."

With variables like height, weight, hip/breast/booty size...is it even possible to make all of the bridesmaids happy?"
tall,386913,Goingoingoing,4,Tue Jun 2 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"This will be my 6th and I love supporting my friends on their big days, I feel honored that I am a close enough friend that the bride wants me to stand next to her when she says her vows...  Now with that said, the actual bridesmaid dynamic is really weird most of the time; We have the childhood best friend (in my opinion, she's the one that causes most of the problems ""well, I've known her longer"" being her catch phrase), The college friends (typically the group I fall into), and then we have sister(s) that sometimes the bride hates but has her in it just to make Mother of the Bride happy.   As for the dresses; I almost lost it with the childhood best friend yesterday. She's 4'11 and easily 250 (if not more); the rest of the bridesmaids are all thin and petite, with me being the Stretch Armstrong addition. The bride falls in love with one of the dresses, the one mentioned in my post WAY too short on me, but I don't say anything because I'll do whatever makes my best friend happy and cause as little drama as possible.   Childhood best friend throws a FIT and demands that the bride choose the dress that best suits her because the rest of us are thin and should have to dress around her size. Her level of entitlement was baffling... I've never seen anyone take on the diva roll so soon. I'm scared for what's else to come.  I know being overweight and tall aren't the same ""problem"" when dress shopping, but I imagine things are similar. I've been in other weddings with bigger bridesmaids and we've laughed about the extra fabric needed for both of our circumstances... I would never demand the bride change the dress no matter what... And I have some ugly ass bridesmaid dresses. I was just shocked and frustrated. Her level of entitlement was baffling... I've never seen anyone take on the diva roll so soon. I'm scared for what's else to come.  Sorry your comment was the one with the rant attached."
tall,386913,thatfunkykaren,2,Tue Jun 2 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"I think it is a lot harder being overweight than being tall. This might be the reason for the diva attitude :/  People tend to be more understanding of height being a problem than of weight. You cant change being tall, but she is constantly being told by society that she should change being overweight. If she ends up in a dress that exposes her overweight, it would probably feel like showing everyone she has a weak character since she is not strong enough to lose weight. Especially when standing next to a bunch of thin girls. I know this is a bit exaggerated, but the social stigma of being overweight is just so brutal.  That being said it sounds like she is being rude and handling it in a very bad manner. Hopefully everything turns out great :)!"
tall,386913,thatfunkykaren,2,Tue Jun 2 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I don't have sympathy for the differences in our body types. No one blames me for drinking milk as a child, it's not looked down upon to be tall (unless I'm talking to someone even taller, then they do look down).   But like I said, this isn't my first wedding with a plus sized bridesmaid and I can only guess the internal struggle she is having standing next to us... But her attitude is pure crap... That's what makes me mad. I jokingly was like ""at least you're not the only one who has to pay extra for a dress that fits; let's gang up on the petite ones for getting sample size prices."" She glared at me and told me to ""shut up."" I was taken shocked to say the least."

She had to fly into San Francisco from London to get her dress fitted, which she did twice. For each dress.    Sis have a formal ball after the wedding and dresses were changed for the ball.    The bridesmaid and I have been friends since sis and me and her were all little. She didn't want to say anything to sis, so I got the full blast.    Weddings can be brutal man. Especially if brides feel entitled and event organisers are involved. And 6 is a lot of weddings to have to attend."

tall,386913,Ranalysis,3,Tue Jun 2 23:07:07 2015 UTC,I can relate. I'm in a wedding this summer with long dresses... so of course I had to pay extra for a measly 4 inches. The kicker is that it then took 15 weeks for mine to come in while everyone else got their dresses after only 3 weeks.

We all had our own seats to ourselves since the bus never filled. We use to have our backs to the windows feet off the seats to make it comfortable. One day we get a sub bus driver who insists we sit straight we try and explain our side she quickly starts yelling at us without hearing us out. Being kids we just ignore her and talk amongst ourselves. She slams on the breaks (maybe assuming we would fly forward?) Pulls off the side of the road and storms to the back off the bus red faced screaming at us. One of the other tall guys gets up and just tells her to shut up. He ends up being moved to the front of the bus (where she can watch us) this pisses everyone off even people we never spoke to! She then put's me up front (I didn't fight it) I'm now stuck with the other guy crammed in the seat (he is six five so he's a giant compared to me) the last guy just yells from the back ""can I join then?!"" Of course she sends him up. He comes running up and throws himself up on us. She got really nasty after that the other kids thought it was a riot laughing non stop. We felt bad for holding everyone up and did apologize as we got off but no one but the driver was mad. When our regular driver returned she was annoyed but she gave us some slack and didn't write us up for it. We never saw the sub again."

tall,383vja,blackinthmiddle,2,Mon Jun 1 21:16:11 2015 UTC,"I was just coming home on JetBlue two days ago and was in economy as well. The problem I had was in seating width. I was in seat 17A. Two days ago when I was flying home, I was sitting next to a small Asian girl, so I had no problems. On the initial flight, however, I sat next to a short, but obese girl and she was spilling over into my seat. I felt bad muscling her, but when I didn't I was being squashed.   Now the funny thing is I picked the seat, but I didn't realize it was the row right in front of the exit, so my seat appeared to be two inches narrower than the other seats. Bottom line, I'm not huge, weighing a tad over 220lbs and I'm a slim 220 with a fair amount of muscle. I don't know how much more it costs for first class seats, but I'd rather not have to wrestle with someone for six hours. And as big as the girl was,i don't blame her too much, as it did appear I just happened to have one of the freak narrower seats. Lucky me.   Never take seat 17A on JetBlue!"

The regiment was founded in 1675 and dissolved in 1806 after the Prussian defeat against Napoleon. Throughout the reign of the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia (1688–1740) the unit was known as the ""Potsdamer Riesengarde"" (""giant guard of Potsdam"") in German, but the Prussian population quickly nicknamed them the Lange Kerls (""long guys"").

tall,37k8lx,Mattpilf,7,Thu May 28 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"So, ""my girlfriend and I are in this picture"" would be correct? or ""This is a picture of my girlfriend and me""?  The question is: what was OP holding back in that sentence? :-)"
tall,37k8lx,ToastyXD,2,Thu May 28 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"So, ""my girlfriend and I are in this picture"" would be correct? or ""This is a picture of my girlfriend and me""?   Both are correct, because when you take out the other subject, they become:  ""I am in this picture"" and ""This is a picture of me""  It's tricky, but straightforward."
tall,37k8lx,Mattpilf,1 point,Thu May 28 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"This gets complicated here.  So ""me""  is relic of all non-nominative case of the word I (so accusative,  dative,  genitive etc in English is just the oblique case).  In English  the verb ""is""  shouldn't really cause a tense change but sometimes does. So ""it is I.""  while once correct, sounds odd and overly formal to most speakers and thus the say ""It is me.""  Similiarly for other pronouns too like ""this is her""  ""that is them"".   However I believe pictures tend to omit information.  So a complete sentence  would be ""this is a picture of my girlfriend  and me on the street.""  often omits the picture in a sentence and thus becomes ""this is my girlfriend  and me on the street""   Honestly since it's a fragment I think it's crazy to assume there's a clear case if it's nominative or not."

Though this is purely anecdotal, I felt like Alice in Wonderland after she eats one of those size increasing pastries when I went South. I got off the plane in Florida and I went from being 2"" than your average West Michigander to 5"" taller than your average Floridian."
tall,37mlju,Nickxk,2,Tue Jun 2 03:43:46 2015 UTC,"I think the closest you might be able to get to an answer for this is US Census data on racial demographics. Asians and Latinos tend to be shorter on average, whereas the Dutch and a few other races/ethnicities tend to be on the taller side. Hawaii has a large Asian population, and Latinos are probably particularly common in border states and also New York City and Puerto Rico.  So you'd be looking for places with a high concentration of either taller races or shorter races. That should give a rough idea of the height ranking (three groups: cities likely to be taller, cities likely to be shorter, and more racially diverse cities that are somewhere in between), but it wouldn't give you actual numbers for the heights in those places. If there are other factors known to have a strong correlation with height that you can easily find data on, that might help inform your ranking as well."

If I sit up ergonomically, my head scrapes the roof (and no moonroofs, either, as you lose a few inches of head space for those!) and I'm looking through visor/roof. So I have to slouch slightly, which is bad for my posture, shoulders, and elbows. However, while slouching allows me to see straight ahead and to the sides, it puts the rear-view mirror directly in between my eyes and everybody stopped at the stop sign to my right, meaning I'm ducking my head like a walking chicken to see under my mirror before I cross a four-way intersection.  I miss my F150 something fierce."

I drive a Chevy Blazer and have to slouch in it (also in pretty much any car without a sunroof I've driven).

tall,37gjme,katielady125,9,Thu May 28 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a person who generally loves being short, clothes are always too long and nothing fits off the rack. You have to have like three stools or step ladders around the house because all the cabinets and closet shelves are too tall for you to reach on your own and you can't reach the pull strings on ceiling fans ever unless you buy an extension chain. Car shopping is equally tricky for a very short person as it is for a tall person because you can't see over the dash board or enough of the front of the car to be able to navigate without crashing into anything. Or if the seat is high enough, you can't reach the pedals.   I can legally drive a car, but I'm not tall enough to ride certain go-karts on my own. When sitting on a public toilet, my feet don't reach the ground, so they're just swinging in the air like a toddler, which is super awkward when you're trying to squeeze out a poop. It can also be a little tricky to be taken seriously as a professional when you're the size of a thirteen year old, and I kind of hate having to ask a tall person to reach something on the top shelf at a grocery store, or not being able to see over the person in front of me at concerts and movies.   That being said, I love being short. I can buy clothes in the kids section for super cheap and fit comfortably on public transportation and I can sleep in the back of a car lying down and I never have to duck under anything, and when I fall on my face, the ground is never far away. But it's not without its issues."

tall,37gjme,DeadlySight,2,Wed May 27 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"If a shop has pants in a ""short"" or ""petite"" size it'll fit, but otherwise pants are almost always too long and the hems get shredded from being stepped on. And skirts have to fall at specific lengths to look right, and if you have short stumpy legs, the skirt is too long and only serves to make you look even shorter and stumpier. It's not super obnoxious, but it's definitely inconvenient."
tall,37gjme,NinjaShira,3,Wed May 27 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"I had to laugh when you mentioned the shredded hems. I'm a 6'2"" girl with a 38"" inseam. I remember when so found the first pair of pants that were actually too long for me at age 26. My husband still makes fun of how excited I was when I held up the tattered hem of my jeans and showed them off to everyone. I was so damn proud. I was used to sagging my jeans on my waist and walking funny so that they looked long enough."

tall,37gjme,DeadlySight,2,Thu May 28 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"Physically, being short isn't bad at all, until you get down around 5' or lower. Reach can be an issue, but there are tools to get around that, like ladders, those grabber things, moving straps, etc. Visibility can be a big issue since you're so low, you can't see the board in class, can't see a damn thing in crowds, have trouble seeing over the steering wheel.  Most of the problems with being short come from other people though. Occasionally when I get gas on my way into work in the morning, I'll get comments about how I shouldn't be skipping school. Even though I'm past college, people still sometimes assume I'm a teenager. There's being used as an arm rest and the hair ruffling, because I wasn't already sick of that when I was 8. All kinds of fun."

It seems like it's become standard practice in society to pity short people and revere tall people. I mean I guess it's nice to be on the positive side of that but it also sucks to have your problems dismissed because ""well at least you're tall"". Truly we share a similar problem. We just don't fit in the world around us. We each have our upsides and downsides but we can both appreciate what it feels like to not fit into that nice average sized box that society has in their heads. I wish some of the shorter people I have met were more open to the idea of commiserating and mutual understanding. I experienced a lot of jealousy and outright contempt from some shorter people simply because they believed that by being tall, I had things so much easier than them and didn't deserve to complain about anything especially if it had to do with my height.

I'm not short, I never was, I was my height already at 15, but I can imagine how an inferiority complex can generate itself if you're a head shorter than every other guy and shorter than most women too. It's not so much that we have it ""tougher"" or they do or something, the problem extends also to very different aspects of life."
tall,37gjme,vbaeri,4,Wed May 27 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, the fact that people assume that being short automatically generates an inferiority complex is much worse than actually being short."
tall,37gjme,Ishmael1217,2,Wed May 27 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"People are praised when they are taller than average (throughout life, mostly men). All of a sudden, a taller specimen shows up, and there's a moment of incertainty there.   All of a sudden, someone is taking away the thing which is their 'distinction' between 'the normies'.  To them, it's a shock, and it makes them feel bad/uncertain/sometimes even threatened, so some people will extrapolate and go ""Oh boy, some people must feel like this all the time!"".  The truth is that when more people are taller than you than shorter, that becomes your normal (like their 'taller than' is), and doesn't really have an impact on how you feel in your daily life.  At least: for me.. :-)  But as you say: it sucks when someone comes up to you and goes ""don't feel bad, it's not a big deal"", as if something is wrong with you."
tall,37gjme,GrandBuba,3,Wed May 27 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"Well, for us shorties there's still the physical inconvenience of not being able to find clothes that fit. :P Granted, we can always just get them tailored smaller.  I think most of the angst over in /r/short relates to the whole dating thing (at least for the straight ones) and the pervasive idea that a woman needs to have a guy who's taller than her.

I have to agree that the world isn't easy for the short, but the fact of the matter is everyone on here was 5' tall at some point. Granted it was when we were about 10, but we were there. Clothes are long enough at that height (and before you make the short person argument, yeah, you have to tailor yours... so do we. Only they usually don't come with enough fabric.) and shoes fit and while our feet didn't touch the ground always, we did fit in a toilet stall without our knees around our ears, or onto a plane seat or in a car. Small modifications might be needed to help a short person fit into things better, but things frequently just aren't possible with even big modifications for the tall. There are some common complaints- we have trouble reaching things sometimes, just like short people (laundry in front-loading w&d is a nightmare for the tall, bottom lockers, the bottom shelf at the grocery store...) and we get lots of stupid nicknames and questions about our heights too (weather up here's great, and I played basketball until I scored for the wrong team and tripped three other girls on my team on accident) but yeah, overall I have to say that the world is certainly NOT made for the tall, and it's frustrating but you fit into the world for average size people, which frequently just isn't possible for a lot of us.   Plus, short girls in heels? Totally cool and normal. Tall girls? Stared at. Guys say things like ""Oh, I love shorter girls, they're better in bed""... Tall girls hear that and are like ""Soooo I suck in bed 'cause I'm tall? Is that a thing?"" It's another thing to be self conscious about. And guys don't have this problem dating someone shorter that the do with dating someone taller than them- so when it comes to dating, the pool for tall girls is rather limited, and even those guys end up with these 5' girls a lot of the time. sigh."

It's also not hard for a short guy to make you feel feminine  (if that's what you desire),  once  you the idea that height isn't really tied to feminine  and masculine.  You are NOT  some super masculine she hulk because you are tall,  and a 4' dwarf is not some feminine  man because he's short. I'm sure you know this,  but sometimes the people around you don't.  Sometimes it takes a while for people to understand that height shouldn't limit love.   Your best bet is to stay strong,  and don't let your ignorant  friends box you in.  Most men aren't nearly as picky as most women on height.  I'm not saying every man will be okay being shorter(some of them are that shallow)  but a very large and sizeable chunk will  be okay with your height, they often don't know if you are okay with theirs .

It's smart to stay away from fatty foods but a burger and a slice of pizza every once in a while wont kill you, especially if you're working out frequently. I know when i was trying to get bigger an important thing was to eat 4-5 meals a day and not to sway from that schedule so you dont throw off your metabolism, gotta get your body into a rhythm.  Also if your looking for supplements try out protein shakes, I used to take Mass XXX for post workout and friends of mine really like Whey Protein as well.

Key for me was to find stuff you like eating, and sometimes just force yourself to eat. Also keep track of what you're eating on something like myfitnesspal or whatever, it doesn't really matter what you use, but it helps to work to a goal for calories and makes it easier to keep track of macros.  just smash in food, it'll be a struggle at first but soon you'll start to enjoy it."

Leg room can work if you don't have a lot of junk in the trunk (your's, not the car's), and it is daft for a long torso (unless you like bugs and wind going through your forehead)."
tall,37dzct,zxcvb94105,3,Tue May 26 22:56:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on the year. They've grown just slightly - newer models are a tiny bit better than older ones.  My friend's late 90s one, I could get in, but my knees were too high around the wheel to make it practical to drive. An early 2000s model was a little better but I wouldn't have liked it as a long-term car. I haven't sat in a current-gen yet.  Best bet is to give it a try.  You'll fit great in European and probably well in (ugh) American cars (VW and Mercedes are good, Volvo is better, a Saab I actually had to move the seat a click forward), Japanese will be more hit-and-miss.  I did find that the 350Z was a great fit for legroom.  I ended up with an Integra, though, and that is really marginal. But oh what a car otherwise."

I fit OK, but you're so low to the ground that you're effectively transferring your ass directly to the curb when you get out.  There's nothing dignified about it.  Also, the older models had no power steering.  Source: my 34 point turn to get out of the parking spot and subsequent $700 at the body shop."

tall,37dzct,ozzimark,1 point,Wed May 27 16:29:23 2015 UTC,Yes! You'll most likely have to remove some foam from the seat and you can also remove the arm rest from the door panel for extra room.

Some lower sitting sport seats might help, but you could still run into problems if you have a lot of leg. That and having to peek above the roof line to see if the traffic light has changed. :P  Bottom line: it depends on the model year but the absolute best way to find out if you'll fit is to physically go to a dealer and sit in a few."

There are always some people who try to pick a fight with whoever they perceive is the strongest person in the room to prove something as a dick measuring contest but that is whatever. 95% of the time you can instantly deescalate tense situations if you aren't an asshole.   there isn't a shortage of girls who like tall guys, not everyone does, but you certainly have a leg up on other guys  and the without a doubt the most underrated advantage I have found, is that people will generally listen to you.

tall,37bh5r,ynosleepscreams,5,Tue May 26 12:01:29 2015 UTC,"Well, the average girl wouldn't be 5'9"", they would be 5'4""-5'5"".. :-)  Regardless, I see what you mean on a daily basis, having a few girls your height in the office. In pictures, all of us wearing flat shoes, the difference is quite minimal (since all of them are also pretty waif-ish), but in person-to-person interactions, those 2.5-3"" are a serious difference.  Hard-wired I guess?"
tall,37bh5r,GrandBuba,0,Tue May 26 14:10:06 2015 UTC,Agreed it is strange. Its just we notice it so instantly. Yet parallel parking is hard for so many. I wonder if its that whole defense thing where an animal will push its tail higher to look taller to avoid its predators.
tall,37bh5r,lorelaiskya,4,Wed May 27 01:35:53 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, a lot of my female friends are between 5'1"" & 5'5"", but I actually rarely remember/realize the height difference until someone else points it out to me (I'm 5'9"", for the record, which I know probably barely qualifies me for this sub...). I think I tend to be so focused on looking at peoples' eyes & overall faces when talking, I barely register the fact that I might have to look slightly up or down to do so."

tall,37bh5r,MandostheJudge,2,Tue May 26 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"I don't feel that way at all. I see people within two inches of my height either way as being basically the same height as myself, because it is, as you say, a very small difference."
tall,37bh5r,_J_J_,2,Tue May 26 19:10:29 2015 UTC,"In short: it's because of the increase in volume (no, I'm not calling you fat :-P ). People are threedimensional objects, so even a relatively small increase in height of two inches tends to translate in noticeable increase in volume. There may also be  a sociobiological factor at play, in that people may be finely attuned to detecting height differences in humans, while the same height difference in other species or inanimate objects would be scarcely noticeable."

I tend to see quite the number of tall/skinny girls around, and while the boys seem to be 'following', they're not exactly keeping pace.  It might be anecdotal, but I'm under the same impression.

tall,37c30o,billthane,2,Tue May 26 20:51:23 2015 UTC,why not? average height gap narrowed in recent years so it'll be likely that women will be taller
tall,37c30o,GrandBuba,8,Tue May 26 21:10:11 2015 UTC,Girls grow earlier than boys.  Maybe that's what you're seeing.
tall,37c30o,VoicelikeHoney,3,Tue May 26 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"The average woman will likely not be taller than the average guy, but I do expect the height gap to close. Estrogen causes the epiphyseal plates to close, ending height growth. This is why girls stop growing at a younger age - they have more estrogen.   Now, a couple factors are in play which may cause boys to produce more estrogen and hence grow less.  One is the chemicals from industrial processes and plastics, like BPA. These chemicals are prevalent in the products we use and even our air and water, and may contribute to higher estrogen levels in boys.  Another is the fact that fat converts testosterone into estrogen, and hence if the average bf% of boys goes up, so does their estrogen levels. Judging by rising obesity rates, I expect this is a significant factor.   Guys will still have less estrogen than girls, but the difference may well be shrinking - just like their height."
tall,37c30o,Ookami_Naku,2,Tue May 26 16:39:19 2015 UTC,Completely with you on this.
tall,37c30o,sirchewi3,2,Tue May 26 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"Evolution 101. You breed tall things, you will almost certainly get tall progeny.  Biology 101. Men have less estrogen in their bodies and more testosterone and growth hormone in general. This makes them grow even taller, and women to stop growing sooner. Men can grow for over a decade longer than women in extreme cases.  Nature vs Nurture 101. having the genes does not necessitate the result. Having poor diet and habits can stunt one's growth as we know. Men these days are more likely to lead a poor lifestyle, stunts their growth.   The average height may close, but men will almost certainly remain the taller gender."

tall,373alk,callmeRichard,11,Tue May 26 05:24:45 2015 UTC,"BMI is 19th century 'science' that was intended to measure populations, not individuals."
tall,373alk,alblaster,6,Sun May 24 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"BMI is still fine to give you a general idea of where you should be.  It's designed for the average person, not someone whose really tall or really muscular."
tall,373alk,horselover_fat,-2,Sun May 24 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"There are much better simple ways of determining your health. Most scales these days have body fat measuring things, which is a better (but less accurate) way to see if you are overweight.  Also fat around you're belly is worse than elsewhere. You can easily measure this by measuring your waist and comparing ratio of this to chest and hips.  The only reason to use BMI is if you are lazy, or don't own a tape measure or body fat scales. Really it didn't even help then. You're height doesn't change as an adult, so you'll know it will go up linearly with weight. So what is the point of even calculating it? You should know if the weight gain is muscle or fat if you pay attention to your body, which is much more useful than a number."
tall,373alk,Mattpilf,1 point,Mon May 25 12:18:29 2015 UTC,"First of all,  those scales are very inaccurate and not really better than a BMI,  nor is it obvious when they are wrong.  Very few places even have  these scales,  so they aren't exactly commonplace.  In fact in my dozens of scales I've been on I've still never been on one of those.  And muscle mass is primarily  concern  for men,  since most women,  even when weight lifting don't bulk up much,  even when they get strong. A guy can put on 50 pounds of muscle by lifting, but I've never seen a women do that,  even if their strength  gains are comparable.   Even for height in BMI you are only off by about 1 or 2, which isn't perfect but not wildly out there.  And it still has the same problem waist measurement  does to height.  Tall people have bigger waist in general.  On top of that,  it's actually hard to teach people consistent  and accurate ways to measure  waist.  Mine could be anywhere between 28"" and 36"" depending on measurements.   Gender isn't even a huge problem either.  While women naturally have about 10% higher body fat,  they also have naturally less muscle mass,  especially at the normal sedentary  population,  and it's more or less a wash(again excluding women with very atypical  muscle development)   BMI  isn't perfect,  it certainly  has some issues with height and muscle mass,  but it works for 90% of the population,  and the rest 10% just need to fudge the numbers a bit to adjust for height and muscle mass.  BMI is very simple (although since we don't have to do things by hand we should change the exponent  to 2.5), and mostly effective.  If we could as simply find your body fat percentage in people,  we would, but we can't,  so we'll do with what we have."

Not to mention all your tops that are supposed to end low-hip are now high-hip and suddenly become tummy-baring if you need to raise your arms.   Any and all mini-dresses for clubbing and the like will barely cover your bum (probably not).   And jeans in a 36"" inseam are harder to find than they should be. Heck, even finding a 34"" inseam can be a royal pain in the arse depending on where you live.   Not going to lie, when I find clothes that fit me well, I look stunning.

Congratulations, you're now a freakishly gangly, awkward young woman!  All long limbs, knobbly joints, and hard edges, with (as has been noted) lots of people willing to tell you how unattractive you are because of it.  Oh, and that sexy 32C cup of yours is probably more like a 34B or maybe even a 36A now. :-/  Or maybe during puberty you couldn't help but be clumsy and awkward because of how rapidly your body grew.  So you never got into exercise and even now, despite being more comfortable with your body, the square-cube law kind of fucks you when it comes to physical activity and health.  So go ahead and pack on an extra 40-70 pounds.  Yup, you're a perfectly healthy young woman who's 6'2"", and weighs north of 200 lbs.  Nice to meet you, Princess Fiona.  Now go for a stroll around town and notice how you blend right in.  Oh, sorry, people 'still staring at you?  Yeah, well, that's to be expected.  Being tall, you don't really have the option of being inconspicuous.  There's all sorts of wonderful unexpected consequences to that.  For example, odds are you're kind of a shitty dancer because you were always a little too self-conscious of how everyone was watching you on the dance floor.  On the plus side, not many men want to dance with someone taller than them, so it's only really an issue in the exceedingly rare occasion a tall gu =y (6'5""+?) shows an interest in you.  You'll be so non-plussed at the prospect of a height-compatible mate you probably couldn't stamp out a decent box step anyways.  Not what you were hoping for?  Sorry, there aren't actually all that many Elle McPhersons running around, despite what the media might have you believe.  Odds are pretty good you ain't gonna be one of 'em.  And even if you were, you would still have to deal with all the bullshit that comes from being tall, awkward, and uncomfortable during puberty.  Finally, no tall day would be complete without a little hanky-panky, right?  So let's shake the mothballs out of the bedsheets and hook up with an average-size guy.  Hey, this actually ain't so bad.  You're both about the same size; 'turns out your parts actually line up pretty well!  This is actually one area where tall woman may have a bit of an advantage.... assuming you're with someone who appreciates that sense of physical equality.  If either of you prefers more traditional gender roles (""petite sexy woman"" + ""big masculine man"") well... probably not your cup of tea.  Tall guys have it a bit harder (no pun intended).  If they hook up with a short women that 18"" height difference can make for some amusing bedroom moments.  This is not to say being tall doesn't have it's perks, but you asked why tall people have insecurities.  Hopefully this gives you some sense of that.  [Source: Not a woman, but did the tall/awkward thing in teens and 20's.  Wish I could enjoy dancing without being so goddamn self-conscious.  Wish I didn't get jolts of excruciating pain up and down my spine every time I sneezed. I know it's different for women, but I'm in my late 40's and I've seen/heard enough of the female side of things to be pretty confident I'm not too far off the mark.  My apologies if I'm wrong.  Please do correct me.]"

I apparently need to do a better job reading my own articles. :-)   While being tall had it's advantages, incidents like this can make the big guys out to be the aggressor   Totally agree.  I've experienced this my whole life.  Tall men (and women too, to a lesser extent I expect) here a refrain of, ""don't pick on the little guy!"" heir entire life.  It's one reason for the ""gentle giant"" types: big, physically imposing individuals who are incapable of lashing out matter how justified it may be.   an NBA player was tackled by the NYPD for preventing people from taking pictures and video of the victims ... He wasn't aggressive or a threat   I don't see the Sefolosha incident as being a good example of talls being unfairly painted as aggressors.  The only video I've found starts after the police have started to use force, and I'm having trouble finding anything that describes his preventing bystanders from taking pictures/video of Copeland. Do you have a link?  ... but I won't let that keep me from speculating on what I think happened. :)  If Sefolosha was trying to prevent onlookers from recording, he [Sefolosha] was probably breaking the law.  Recording someone in public is not illegal as long as you're not crossing a criminal line (harassment, intimidation, etc).  Sure, recording a stabbing victim is a dick move, but it's not illegal.  So it's not hard for me to imagine Sefolosha getting upset at seeing a fellow NBA-player treated poorly by a bunch of rubbernecking nightclub idiots and going after them.  But if that's happening in the vicinity of police trying to make sense of a crime scene, yeah, the police are going to have opinions about that.  As for this bit about Sefolosha ""not even being near the incident"", my guess is that Sefolosha probably tried to leave once he saw police taking an interest in him.  But walking away from an officer who wants to talk to you doesn't work. It just escalates things, and it's all downhill from there.  I know I'm defending the police, but all too often these viral excessive-force stories only show one side.  It's really easy to paint an oh-woe-is-me picture of the poor NBA player whose ankle was broken by the police, and who is missing out on the playoffs as a result.  But this is a healthy, young, physically fit, 6'7"" man, in front of a nightclub (read, ""possibly intoxicated""), maybe interfering with people at the scene of an investigation.  Sorry... limited sympathy until there's more evidence he was unjustly singled out.  tl;dr: People have a right to record anyone in public, not just police, and always-on body cameras should be mandatory for officers on duty."

Did the trick :)  As long as tall folk are aware as early as possible in life about 'projection', that they are naturally a noticeable 'target' for these subconscious insecurities of others & carry a mental arsenal of statements to project back  at any given moment, it can be handled quickly & smartly.  I have friends & family of all heights, none of whom try to publicly make a subject of who I naturally am; took me until my 30s to perfect the above & be just as 'thoughtless' as to my comebacks on those doing otherwise. Its fun when it happens now :)"
tall,36vs03,SpethalK,3,Sat May 23 12:08:03 2015 UTC,Do you honestly think people are trying to insult you when they point out your height?
tall,36vs03,ShortyShuvnstuff,0,Sun May 24 01:47:36 2015 UTC,"Regardless, it's still rude. If random people came up to you multiple times every day and said ""gosh you're short aren't you?"", how would you take it? Even if it's not meant as an insult, it's still rude and when you hear it all day every day, it gets really frustrating. It would be nice to go out in public and be treated like a human."
tall,36vs03,SpethalK,0,Sun May 24 03:00:43 2015 UTC,"Frustrating as it is, I still don't think people should be labeled as rude because of it."
tall,36vs03,ShortyShuvnstuff,-1,Sun May 24 04:36:06 2015 UTC,Why not? How is it different from me pointing out to a complete stranger that they are fat? Initiating a conversation with a complete stranger for the sole purpose of discussing some aspect of their physiology is rude.
tall,36vs03,SpethalK,2,Tue May 26 12:50:34 2015 UTC,"""You're fat"" and ""you're tall"" are nowhere near the same caliber of comment. ""You're tall"" is more likely to be a compliment than the insult you want to make it out to be. Just because it annoys you doesn't mean it's rude."
tall,36vs03,ShortyShuvnstuff,0,Tue May 26 13:49:11 2015 UTC,"Of the multitude of times its happened in the UK, I'd say 80% of the time these uninvited comments about my height (aka appearance) have not been in a positive manner unfortunately.   I've travelled extensively & in no other country/nationality does it happen quite so much.  It usually goes: 1. Minding my own business anywhere at anytime 2. A usually British (as in lift packed scenario) person will start looking me up & down checking to see if I am wearing heels (also known in this animal world we are a part of as 'Ranking') 3. If I don't walk away once I've noticed they are doing this they then start doing it in an overly obvious manner they start whispering & pointing at me to the person they are with (its never a Brit on their own, I avoid standing near 'packs' of Brits altogether) 4. If I am unfortunate enough not to have my earphones in & they think I haven't noticed their behaviour, then  increasingly visible/audible remark; more often than not negative eg; jolly green giant, is she a man (from shorter men) or sniggering etc 5. Depending how it turns out I either ignore, look them up & down in return, blow them a kiss or give them a look of disgust, regardless of what I do it often ends up with insults being shouted at me publicly even if I don't react whatsoever. Nice huh? If I'm ovulating then its usually females that start with the usual BS or start practically having sex with the male they happen to be with right in front of me, when I was younger & unaware the dumbest ones would actualky try & physically attack me when they got no rise out of me.  So 80% of the time in South Central England (or a person from there) my answer to your Q is a very firm yes (and yes I am trying very hard not to live here anymore but V tough having to leave all your friends/family to escape the regular unwelcome/uninvited abuse)  Just about every other place in the world the above just never happens at all :)"

In fact, your lack of a flair made me jump to quite a few assumptions. I'm sorry you have to deal with that.

Haters/lower vibration folk will always try to bring you down/make you doubt your own views regardless of any physical traits but my contributions intent to this tall subreddit is to share observations/tips/nip it in the bud techniques with fellow tall folk.  I am extremely comfortable in my opinions. It works for my own intellect, experiences & time on the planet so far. Making sense of what is absolute non sense aka bullying. Humans are a part of the animal kingdom not separate/above & similar behaviour patterns unfortunately still apply.  Interested to know if you've heard of/witnessed any of my experiences happening regularly to those of average/below average height?  Might go & ask or perhaps challenge someone's comment on the 'short' subreddit... ;)"
tall,36vs03,SpethalK,0,Sun May 24 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you are unable to see flairs, most people have their height and geneder displayed. I'm actually a 5'4"" man.  I really don't believe in all that ""me still caveman, me like certain size people"" nonsense that people claim results in height norms. To me it's mostly a matter of social psychology.   I can say with certainty that I don't have people snickering at me everywhere I go. It happens, but the majority of the time I'm left completely alone. The thing about being a short man is that when someone is genuinely trying to insult you, height will always be included."

I didn't use it that much (mostly cause my kid would jump around in it, which wasn't the best experience) but I vaguely recall it causing some back pain.  Their website says most of their kid carriers fit up to a 19"" torso, which sounds a little short for someone our size.  Osprey website says the Poco Plus should handle up to a large, which their sizing page says should work up to torso lengths of 23"".  I can't find torso sizes for Deuter packs, but they do have an ""EL"" (Extended Length) version for some of their standard models.  I don't see that offered for the Kids Carrier, though, which has me thinking it's probably not designed for taller individuals.  Lastly, and most importantly, there is a kid carrier designed for tall people! The site claims it'll work for people up to 6'6"" (torso length = 24"").

While. Height will help head the balls and stuff,  and there are some tall forwards,  the most important thing is ball control(not the easiest thing when you are  tall and have long legs) ,  agility(also not easy thing when you are tall as shifting direction tends to harder), play making(requires sports intelligence and experience)  and power for forwards(being big and physical can help in 50/50s) .

tall,36kyfd,laquerhead,12,Wed May 20 03:46:47 2015 UTC,"First off, congrats on the wedding (and your engagement!)  I know it's a journey to get a proper fitting suit. If you wanted a few pointers:  Good call on the two button suit, too many buttons looks distracting and 4 button suits are definitely out of style. With two button suits, always leave the bottom button undone. Undo both buttons when sitting down so the jacket doesn't bunch up, and you'll be nice and comfy.  I noticed that the fabric at your chest is bunching up into an ""X"". This might be just because of the pose you're in, but if there's still fabric bunching up to form an X on your chest, your chest is too tight. With an ideal chest, you can slide a fist flat up against your chest snugly.  Really impressed by how the shoulders fit. Completely flat shoulders just ending over your arms is what you want, and you nailed it. It's also really hard to tailor shoulders, so if you want any part of the suit to fit, it's this one.  Not sure if the bride wanted all the groomsmen like this, but weddings are probably the only place pink shiny ties can work. If you're all matching, fantastic, but if you're just wearing this tie by yourself outside of a wedding, I'd reconsider and think about a tie that isn't as flashy :D  Generally, pocket squares and ties aren't supposed to match. I do like the differing textures of the tie vs. the pocket square, though. Again, if all the wedding party has this, then rock it!  Just a small barely noticeable nitpick, but your jacket collar sits too big on the back of your neck. The next step up would be a jacket collar that sits flush against your shirt collar, and doesn't stick up in the air. Very small detail though :)  Your black shirt collar is a great size for your neck, wide lapels suit your neck + face type. The next step up would be to make a wider knot for your tie, like a windsor knot. Doing this would fill in the space between the collars nicely and make things look nice and proportional.  This suit is a great colour for a summer/spring wedding! If you're looking for another suit, consider charcoal, as it's good for formal and informal suit occasions.  Have fun, handle your alcohol, kick ass on the dance floor and give everyone giant bear hugs!"
tall,36kyfd,unfriendlyfire,5,Wed May 20 06:13:03 2015 UTC,Thank you and thank you! I will reply with more detail later when I'm not about to head off to work.
tall,36kyfd,KderNacht,5,Wed May 20 06:31:58 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate that pointers you offered seeing how this is my very first suit I wanted some feedback on it and you hit the nail square on the head and then some.   I have only really seen 2 button suits, that is great adVice about how and when to button which buttons, knowing that. I've never worn a suit before I probably would have failed miserably at that if I hadn't received your advice. Thank you.  The fabric was indeed bunching up because of my stance, it fits flat on my chest when I'm standing upright in a normal position without my hands in my pockets. Only reason they are their is because my fiancée had made some comments about a certain area and was more entertained with that than trying to take a pic so I could see what the suit looked like.  I really liked how a different jacket fit when I was seeing what when with my build but that was a different style than what the wedding party had to wear. Similar shoulders but more flattering than this one in my opinion.  Yeah she wanted all the groomsmen dressed like that, the tie is actually not pink but more of a violet but I'm sure the lighting didn't help show that. I don't plan in using that tie outside the wedding. I'm not a big fan of the color of the pocket square and tie but that's part of the color scheme my sister went with.  The collar of the jacket may also be because of my stance, I will try it on again and see if that is the case.  Yeah, that tie I just don't like but in order to get a larger knot I would have to tie it further down than it is and then I end up with a tie that is far too short. They supplied me with the tie or else I would have gotten one from a big and tall store so that wouldn't be an issue. I thought I had made a winsor knot but could you send a link or something so I can see what its supposed to be done?  Definitely going to be getting atleast one more suit in the future, I was considering charcoal/black and/or a dark blue.  I plan on having fun. As far as handling my alcohol that has yet to be an issue. I don't hit the dance floor because of my two left feet but I would like to learn, its just a bit tough trying to get my steps to match up to the rhythm and with my partner since I'm mostly legs which have a much longer gate than most people. I'm 6'7"" with about a 36"" inseam. Bear hugs will be given and shared with all."
tall,36kyfd,KderNacht,5,Wed May 20 10:04:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a traditionalist, so I might sound rather stuck up. Apologies.  On a two buttoned suit, never button the lower button. It has been the custom since Edward VII and suits are usually tailored to comply. Additionally, I don't agree with buttoning the jacket on a 3 piece suit at all. You've got a waistcoat to cover your shirt front, why cover it with your jacket ? Might as well wear a 2 piece. Lastly, when indoors, pocket flaps are to be inserted into the pockets.  And from what I can see, I'm afraid your sleeves might be too long.  Also, congratulations and all that."

The biggest factors for me were that I not dread coming into work, have control of my work/life balance, and can make enough to live comfortably.   Programming seems to fit that bill.

It's my job to interpret the information from their engineers into product that is correct. Sometimes I get the most perfect blueprints and sometimes I get something scribbled on a napkin or even cardboard templates. I remake the parts/drawings based on the tooling that we use in the shop. After the design has been checked I then tool/program the cad drawing and send it out to the shop for manufacturing.   I also know how to run various CNC machines. I gives me a better insight in how a part would cut. Sometimes I have to run the machines in absense of other operators. It changes things up.   As for pay, I know I could be making more but I am satisfied with what I make."

tall,36i66k,akaxaka,3,Tue May 19 19:09:58 2015 UTC,"Not taller, there's a guy here who is at least 6'6"". His legs are shorter than mine but he's got a super long torso. He has to worry about another problem I'll mention.  There are two potential problems that warranted the restricting of leg length.  The first is Dynamic Overshoot (AKA ""seat slap""). If your thighs aren't nearly flat against the seat, the seat's first impact on the thigh is hard enough to clean break femurs. This is not just a function of thigh length but of knee to foot. Rudder pedals can be adjusted, but some of us will still have a gap between our thighs and the seats.  The second is the potential to shear your legs off at the knees by the glare shield. Don't need to say more about that.  Smaller concerns are reduced room in the cockpit (to handle charts and whatnot) and the need to move my legs out of the way of various controls and instruments so that I may use/see them.  With long torsos (worse when your legs are long), breaking your neck during ejection can be an issue if you can't lower the seat enough. Canopies are designed to either be ejected from a plane or shattered with det cord before the seat launches. In case these features fail, the seats have spikes on the top as a backup to break the canopy (at the expenses of ejection power and increased chance that the glass can harm the pilot). If you can't get your seat low enough to keep your helmet below the spikes, you risk breaking your neck on the canopy.  The G force is all technique once you get above your resting G limit. Even as a tall guy I can be OK at 5 G without having to do all the straining to keep the blood out. Shorter people tend to have higher resting G but this is not always the case.  It used to be the cockpits were a ton smaller, which is where the short guy stereo type comes in. You can be too short and too light to fly fighters for various other reasons. Since before I was born, there was a shift towards a 95th percentile human size cockpit, which has increased the variety of people in this community."

tall,36by67,Leiryn,3,Mon May 18 16:50:10 2015 UTC,"Well assuming you don't burn 10k calories a day, you should be able to gain weight. 10k calories is about the limit of what the average person can process in a day.  If you don't mind milk, drink whole milk combined with so much protein powder it's basically a slurry.  A big glass of that can be about 6-700 calories easily. If you drink 3-4 of those a day on top of your normal diet you've probably doubled your caloric intake.   Red meat is a good way to gain weight as well.  A burrito made from 80-20 beef with some seasoning, a big tortilla and some cheese can be over 1000 calories  Neither of these is a strictly healthy way to gain weight, but it is better than pop.  Also being chronically underweight is terrible for you, so it's worth it.  It's a lot harder to gain weight as a vegetarian or a vegan though.  Warning, that diet will make you fart a lot. It won't smell, because you aren't eating anything green, unless you are lactose intolerant.  It's probably more healthy to eat a shit ton of grilled chicken.  Of course as long as you count x calories and make sure you are above a certain level you will gain weight.  I used to put ranch dressing on pizza, keep smore poptarts (500 cal each) on hand, drink tons of chocolate milk, etc when I was growing to keep weight on.  I was 6'3"" and 140 at one point, now I manage to stay about 185-190."

tall,36by67,Leiryn,1 point,Mon May 18 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"Ya I was the same and then I just started eating more. Until about 2 years ago I was around 180ish and that was small. Realized I was burning about 3200 or so calories a day without exercise so I simply started eating more. I currently eat about 4500 a day, including my exercises. It actually is a lot of work, about 5 pre prepped meals a day, but the real solution is to count calories and increase them. Currently sitting at 225 and pushing on to 250. If you are eating 4000+ a day and not gaining weight then I would actually seek a medical option because you've either got a thyroid problem or the new world record tape worm. But if you are content with your weight then kudos! Although getting checked for parasites is never a bad thing. (You'd be surprised how many you're walking around with.)"

tall,36by67,joelfarris,1 point,Mon May 18 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"Well when I started, it was just because I didn't like the way I looked. I used to be fat and lost a lot a weight. At my lowest I was probably 170 after not eating for a few months. Then people started calling me lanky and other names so I decided to put on weight. I thought 225 would be a good goal but now that I'm here I feel like I'm still small. I like the way I look now, but my motivation now is actually to get better at certain fitness goals and i simply can't do them at this weight.

Especially for taller people, there is a significant discrepancy between your height right out of bed and the rest of the day. On average, you are 3/4"" taller in the morning than a couple hours after waking up. The taller you are, the more height you lose, generally. Maybe he would measure at 6'3.5"" later in the day. Anyway, to answer the question, I still measure myself about once a month to track my growth. Even though I'm 18, I had a late growth spurt, so I am still going to grow for a few more years."

You should not be eating 4000 calories a day.  Download the MyFitnessPal app and track everything you eat.  Eat around 2000k calories a day and go to the gym and do cardio.  I would recommend doing stair master on level 9 for 10 minutes (or 50 flights).  Then move on and do weight training for the rest of your hour.  Cardio will make you lose weight the fastest, but make sure not to eat too many calories and try to eat healthier.  No fastfood, sugar or alcohol.  Try to stick to low fat high protein foods.  Try to avoid meat if possible, and stick with fish like grilled Shrimp or Mahi Mahi ."

To lose weight you have to have a calorie deficient which means eating around 3000 to 3500 calories and still exercising. You will lose both fat and muscle just as your body adjusts;however, with exercise and diet you can maintain the muscle and lose the majority of excess fat. Fitness is 75% diet and 25% exercise.

And just so you know, I'm currently eating between 1750-2200cals a day and losing weight very slowly. You might need to look at something more like 2250-2800cal a day. Feel it out, track your weight.  When people ask me how I did it, all I can really say is ""I wanted it more than food""   Last thing, you're a freaking monster in size. I'm the biggest (well, maybe only tallest now) dude at my really popular gym and its great. I have more potential with lifting than the little guys. People, who are in far better shape than you, are going to be very jealous of you. Feed off that, get big man :D  Goodluck buddy."

If you want to lose weight, then reduce your caloric intake and increase your exercise whenever possible. The BEST single exercise I've found is on a Precor AMT Elliptical.  They can handle our big size.  It's an elliptical that has a variable stride - set by how big you make your steps.  Your arms are moving and helping the resistance as well.  When you get tired you can switch to walking backwards, baby steps, or directly-up & down stair motion.  OR just relax your legs and push hard with your arms.  Once your ""break"" is over you can get back to taking large strides. NO impact on your joints, and I could burn 1200+ calories in an hour on the thing.  When I did that 3x a week and ate right I was losing 2 pounds of FAT a week. Also, get a body composition scale!  They're like $50 on Amazon.  This is very important.  You can gain or lose 3 pounds of water weight in a day - and THIS scale helps you track what your muscle is doing and how much fat you're actually losing.  I found it to be very motivating to watch my fat decrease, muscle remain, and I didn't care about the water moving around... Using a regular scale can be very de-motivational if you can't see your hard work pay off. PM me if you'd like more tips, I would keep track of it all in a spreadsheet and get very intense about it.  Use a calorie tracker and find what works best for you... Eggs were awesome for me - ANY type of Granola went straight to my fat stores.  your body will be different, so track it :) Best of luck, man."

tall,36112z,gseyffert,6,Fri May 15 14:16:47 2015 UTC,"Eh. Just because one person isn't effected by it doesn't mean other people aren't. I would argue that your friend is successful in spite of his height. Not to say that he isn't a great guy, but being tall is generally an advantage in most settings, whereas being short is not. It's hard being short, but especially if you're a dude. People place a lot of value on a man's height, subconscious or otherwise. I know because it's usually the first thing out of most people's mouths when they meet me, ESPECIALLY if they're short. ""Holy shit dude, you're tall, did they put something in the water where you grew up?"" And it's not like 6' 5"" is even that huge (well, to me I suppose). But there's nothing you can do to change your height, unlike a lot of other ""less desirable"" traits (overweight, depressed, etc.). That's the one thing I don't needle my guy friends about. I'd say most of my guy friends are ~5' 6""-10"", and I'll give them loads of shit for anything else, but I'd never insult their height. Fuck, just two weeks ago a girl I was hanging out with said I ""wasn't THAT tall""/""you're more average"" and it pissed me off for some reason (maybe it was the alcohol?). Like, no one has ever said my height was ""average"". I ended up spending like 5 minutes trying to explain that I was in fact tall, and not ""average"". But then she made up for it by saying my forearm veins were big so I dropped it.  Anyway."

Two vehicles that have fit me rather well are the jeep wrangler and a ford ranger. I was able to slide sideways into the seat rather than climbing in and out. The frames were build at my level.
tall,3638d4,lvlobius,1 point,Sat May 16 10:51:06 2015 UTC,"Room: headroom and legroom are often acceptable to me, but I also want elbow and knee room, and not every car provides that.  If any body part bumps or rests awkwardly on stuff in the showroom, it is going to do that every time you drive the car.  Make sure you can live with that.  Size: smaller cars are cute and fuel efficient, but are short in both senses.  I find the smaller doors mean my seat back is behind the pillar, and lower roof-lines and ground clearance make getting in and out feel like climbing in and out of a hole.  Vision: smaller cars often leave my eye level near the top of the windshield, making seeing anything but ""down"" a chore, and the rearview mirror becomes massive obstruction covering half the windshield.  I currently drive a 2015 Kia Rondo (not sold in the US, too bad for you guys!), which satisfies me on most counts."

tall,35xq64,BiancaEstrella,1 point,Fri May 15 02:29:37 2015 UTC,Cute shoes and bonus cute points for the confidence to wear them.   Just FYI there is an absolutely huge difference in selection between 10 and 11. A good percentage of shoes that are made in smaller sizes are also made in size 10. I am sure you have noticed that even at size 10 your selection is far fewer than those at size 7 or 8. At size 11 you get maybe 10% of the choices that you get at size 10. Larger then a 11 and forget about it just shop for shoes online.

Also, wearing heels and cute slacks or something  makes me feel epic and when I feel epic, it shows all over me.   I can be pretty androgynous normally (not as much as when I was in my 20s) and wearing heels makes me feel all dainty and delicate and feminine. I enjoy that feeling sometimes."

It's a feeling, like ""I'm gonna walk/strut in these like I own the place and look good while doing it.""  If I have to give a nice presentation at work or a conference, I'll throw some (low) heels on with my skirt or dress and I suddenly feel very put together."

tall,360txr,Harbinger_of_Kittens,3,Fri May 15 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"Few methods.  The guaranteed method: Contact the airline and upgrade to an exit row or economy plus seating. This costs money, but you are guaranteed a spot.  The ""this usually works for me"" method: Go to the check in counter, ask for exit row. Either pay there if they say you have to, or just keep the seat you have and go to step two.   Go to the gate agent and ask for an exit row since you are really tall and have hardware in your knee. Sometimes it will be a pay only option too.   The kicker is that either you get called back on intercom, or 5 minutes before boarding, go to the gate agent again and ask. At this point they will no longer be making money on selling those seats, so giving one to you doesn't lose them money. Yay.  All other methods have failed method: Make damn well sure that you booked an aisle seat before hand..."
tall,360txr,steeb2er,1 point,Fri May 15 04:51:24 2015 UTC,"This may seem obvious, but be friendly with the counter / gate agents if they're not busy.

tall,360txr,ingloriousmanterds,2,Fri May 15 05:40:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on the company that you're flying with, you can upgrade your seat to have more leg room without a full upgrade to first class; Exit rows also offer more leg room. I don't know where you're flying from but it might be worth it to check at the gate to see how much extra it would be to upgrade to first class.   If none of those things, stretch, stand and walk around the cabin. You have a couple inches on me but I've got two screws on my right knee and two screws in my left foot, the pressure makes them ache and moving helps."

tall,35ufr5,tyeunbroken,8,Thu May 14 14:32:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe one day shorter men will accept that their height has nothing to do with their ability (or lack of) with women. It's their insecurities with themselves which is off-putting. This isn't an example of an exception to a made up ""rule"". This is an example of being confident with who you are. I mean damn he looks boss in that second picture 😎. 👍👍  Edit: They are not a couple. OP and these women are not together. I still stand by my statement that the amount of insecurities pouring out of /r/short is off-putting. Be a man an accept what life has given you and stop complaining about how the dating world is unfair. Short, tall, fat, fit, ugly, attractive, ect. you name it there are disadvantages for every type of person. I get it, shorter men have it a little harder than taller guys. I also realize there are studies proving shorter men have a disadvantage compared to taller men. I never denied that they don't have some disadvantage. But the amount of guys so butthurt by this comment and willing to throw around disinformation such as ""Well 96% of women wouldn't date a shorter guy."" and the mount of /r/short who are familiar with this ridiculous ""fact"" is staggering. I feel it necessary to again reiterate just how ridiculous it is to say that your pool for women is only 4% of the female population.     For women, the vast majority indicated that the shortest per- son they would date would still be taller than them (89%), with only a small minority being willing to accept a mate who was their height (7%) or shorter (4%).   You guys are overlooking a very important fact. Idk if you are doing so consciously or if you're just not fully reading the study...   5.1.1. Participants: We coded personal advertisements available on Yahoo Personals for heterosexual individuals within 250 miles of Los Angeles, California, USA (men seeking women, N = 1000; women seeking men, N = 1000). The average reported age was 37.2 (SD = 9.8) for men and 34.8 (SD = 9.9) for women. Our sample was ethnically diverse for both men (545 White, 226 Black, 69 Hispanic, 60 Asian, and 79 Other) and women (465 White, 208 Black, 120 Hispanic, 101 Asian, and 92 Other).   This study is taking its data from Yahoo Personal Ads for one. Not a respectable representation of women. And only 1000 women within 250 miles of Los Angels, California. Ever been to LA? Shallow, vain (yet quite attractive) females. Horrible depiction for ALL of women. Putting the location aside and the implications of the superficial nature of LA (and surrounding areas). Let us just look at the numbers.  This survey involved 1000 women.....Around 49.6 percent of the world's population is female, giving a total female population of around 3.52 billion in the world as of 2014. Let us do a little math.  1000/3,520,000,000 = 0.0000002841  Change this into a percentage: 0.0000002841 x 100 = 0.00002841% Rewritten: 2.841x10-5 %  You cannot tell me that you're going to say 2.841x10-5 % of women from this one survey get to speak for the entire population of women. Guys.. just step back and honestly think about that. Anyone can sit here and list disadvantages they are faced with which they have no control over. Be confident with yourself, work with what you were given and stop furiously blaming how ""unfair"" the world is for you due to height. If you choose to only pay attention to information which proves your twisted world view. Ignoring any and all information which states otherwise because it doesn't fit YOUR world view. Then you have deep seated personal issues which you need to man up and work through. I won't allow grown men to sit here and defame an entire gender due to their own personal perception of how unfair the dating world is because of one physical attribute. This is the most substantial cop out I have ever seen."

Funny how a nice picture of a short man makes you jump to, ""oh see women don't care about height"".  I think there's a word for taking your opinion as fact and ignoring what women say about it. Man what was it... masonry? No... what is it you call a person who chooses to disregard facts involving women in order to prove a point? A m... m... shit I can't think of it. You know, the type of guy that assumes they are right even in the face of evidence provided by women?  Starts with an m. Miraginy? Massaginy? Oh wait! Mysogyny!  Yea that one you guys like to toss at /r/short at times they're feeling particularly frustrated with rejection.

Probably shouldn't have come then if you knew you were not going to like what you found.   Mysogyny! Yea that one you guys like to toss at /r/short at times they're feeling particularly frustrated with rejection.   Big word for you. Good job on attempting to use Google. Should have tried a dictionary before you were dead set on using a word you are unfamiliar with. The actual word is ""misogyny"". Which is defined as    hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women, or prejudice against women.      what is it you call a person who chooses to disregard facts involving women in order to prove a point?    That is not what the word ""misogyny"" means. Not even close, again a perfect example of trying to use disinformation to further your biased agenda. The only misogynists here have been people who would be considered short. Trying to attack women as a whole due to one biological disadvantage they are faced with. You don't get to hate on women as a whole because you feel life is unfair for you due to your height. There is a classification for people who dwell on perceived flaws with their appearance. Body Dysmorphic Disorder. It's a real disorder which takes time and effort to overcome.  If you are feeling ""particularly frustrated with rejection"" maybe you should not be going into a thread which you had a preconceived notion that you are going to find a comment which you will not like. You came here to fulfill your confirmation bias so that you feel validated in YOUR belief. That's a really stupid reason to be searching the internet.

Let me school your ""smart"" ass on some definitions and how to interpret them.   Preconceived notion: an opinion formed beforehand without adequate evidence.   Seems you're unaware of this definition, as I have more than adequate evidence to assume somebody in this thread wouldn't be able to resist the urge to shit on short guys.  Do you really think I'm unfamiliar with words? Do you really think I'm stupid enough to speak about things I'm not %100 confident about?   mistrust of women   Hmmm, you don't trust the dating opinions of women. In your Googled definition did you misread every ""or"" as ""and""? Or did you skip that one part you're guilty of?  I obviously have a biased agenda. It's called ""not every short man is rejected solely because he's a terrible person"". Biased yet worthy. Is life that peachy as a tall man that you assume everyone has it as good as you? Oh wait, you don't:   biological disadvantage   But wait, I thought nobody cares about height and I'm just an ugly person with an ugly mind?   Body dysmorphic disorder   Again you contradict youself. Do you believe the solution to this is ""confidence""? Would you tell somebody with depression or anxiety that they ""just don't have confidence""?   Confirmation bias: the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.   Do I need to search for the preference for tall men? Tell me, do I actually need to go out and cherry pick information to come to this conclusion? Do you even read /r/tall?  It is you who chooses to put their own beliefs before the values of women. Since you won't agree that this can be considered mysogyny, I'll just hit you with the ""willfully ignorant"" label instead."
tall,35ufr5,ShortyShuvnstuff,-4,Thu May 14 16:03:30 2015 UTC,"By me not rolling over and allowing stupidity to flow throughout this thread with misinformed statistics and bullshit doesn't make me feel superior. I actually find it quite fascinating how much attention this is getting. I mean I have short friends and know their insecurities about their height. However never in my wildest dreams did I imagine how deep-seated this pain is for you guys. This is quite enlightening for me, which is why I continue to probe further and further. I cannot help if how I speak and what I say makes you feel ""inferior"" (I derived this thought process because you keep saying I feel superior. Which I do not, but if you think I am trying to be superior that would mean I am making you feel inferior). I am who I am and I won't change because your feelings are hurt.   as I have more than adequate evidence to assume   Evidence =/= assumptions  No, you had no adequate evidence to believe that there would be a a comment fitting your criteria. You had a preconceived notion (would the word ""hypothesis"" help you to understand?) which was validated when you came here and read my post. You are mixing up a high likelihood of finding such a comment with evidence, but you had zero evidence. My original statement makes sense, you're just nitpicking and clearly unable to grasp what I am saying.  Unfamiliar with words? Well no, you obviously have a general understanding as you are able to form sentences for the most part. That is a very general statement you are making, something you're proving to be quite adept at. Yes, I do think you are ""stupid enough"" to use words you are not familiar with. Pretty sure I already proved that. However you are welcome to your own opinion. Again, it is misogyny, not mysogyny. Nice try though.  I do have a hard time following your thought process. It is well within the realm of possibility I misread what you wrote. Your attempt at wit with the ""Oh whats the word... masonry?.. no no"" made it pretty hard to follow. Then when you actually tried to use the right word, you did not use the right word nor the correct definition. It probably seemed really intelligent in your head but it was quite hard to follow. I will continue to try to improve my comprehension of what you are trying to say.    Is life that peachy as a tall man that you assume everyone has it as good as you?   Again, not sure where short men believe that being tall means that life is inherently easier for us. Or maybe that was an attempt at sarcasm? I don't know, your thought process is really hard to follow. You're speaking with emotion and not logic.   Again, not sure how many times I have to reiterate this since no one picks up on this. Further evidence that you only read what you want to see. I have not said that you don't have a disadvantage. The more you speak the more I really understand that you have a twisted, unwavering belief about women and how they choose a partner. Apparently I just keep poking the bear by expressing my thoughts. Well, I can't please everyone.   BDD, anxiety, depression. These are all very separate disorders, your attempt to lump them all together shows just how misinformed you really are. I have never said confidence is THE solution, those are your words not mine. If you interpreted it that way, well there is not much I can do about that. You seem to truly only read what you wish to see. Pretty hard to combat that kind of comprehension. Confidence is a major factor. If you take someone who has BDD, fix their misconception of themselves. They would then have confidence in themselves which would in turn impact their ability with dating and life in general. Correlation does not mean causation. I find it hilarious that I have to spell it out for you.  As far as confirmation bias, I am really glad that you were able to find the definition. I was using relevant terminology which I am familiar with to express a point. I cannot control whether or not you are able to comprehend what I am saying. You're improving your skills on the internet and I am quite proud of you. However you obviously are still unable to understand the meaning. Do you ever search for information, studies or what have you which actually states that there are women interested in shorter men? Based on everything you have said, I am going to go out on a limb and say no. You're only interested in information which validates your feelings. (Confirmation bias)   Since you won't agree that this can be considered mysogyny   Shit, I spoke too soon. You're still unable to use the internet effectively. Which is quite sad with everything having built-in spell check. As you are still unable to spell the word you are so fond of. I do not have a prejudice against women. I really cannot explain how I am not choosing to put my beliefs before the values of women. In fact it is quite the opposite. I am not allowing this blatant attack on women with false facts such as ""96% of women wouldn't date a shorter guy."" At least I cannot tactfully explain this to you until you actually understand the word(s) which you are still messing up. That would be like trying to explain calculus to a kid learning addition. You have to understand one before you can progress to the other."
tall,35ufr5,PanaceaIV,4,Thu May 14 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"I'll begin by saying, fuck, I've been spelling misoyny (<- edit: Fuck! It's missing the g! Way to go shortyshuvnstuff) wrong.  Believe it or not that's what's set in the autotype  on my phone.  No excuse but why didn't anybody tell me yet?  Lol, must have said it dozens of times already. Anyway...   misinformed statistics   First off, you're right to criticize the source.  But you're wrong to assume this can't possibly be an accurate figure.   I feel it necessary to again reiterate just how ridiculous it is to say that your pool for women is only 4% of the female population.   Secondly, you also need to be sure of what you are arguing about.  The data presented there doesn't say the dating pool is 4% of women for a short man. It says 4% of women aren't interested in a man shorter than themselves.  That would work out to myself, being the average height of a woman, having a dating pool of half of women, plus 4% of the other half of women.  Thirdly, usually you need to refute evidence.  You seem to prefer the, ""no, you're wrong and stupid"" form of argumentation.   superior   Here we go.  I'm going to have to take a deep breath to quote this...   Big word for you.

I wouldn't have even made that claim without knowing I'd have some examples to stuff right back in your mouth.  Not once have I said I'm insecure about my height, or even revealed any feelings toward it at all.  That's all on you.    No, you had no adequate evidence to believe that there would be a a comment fitting your criteria.   Really? You've never seen a comment on /r/tall about how short men are insecure?  Bullshit.  As for my jazzed up first comment, it was my attempt at some lame humour to lighten up what would likely turn into a heated argument.  You don't seem to share my light-heartedness and really want to get gritty with it, I appreciate your enthusiasm.   I have not said that you don't have a disadvantage.   Yup, that's the conclusion you eventually reached after we seemed to have to point it out to you.   BDD, anxiety, depression. These are all very separate disorders, your attempt to lump them all together shows just how misinformed you really are.   Nope, not misinformed.  I've got credentials from two different accredited institutions in social psychology/mental health (no I will not prove this to you.  In fact, I've been hesitant until just now to even mention it on these subs).  I never said they were the same.  The treatment for any disorder never includes, ""just be more confident because it's all your fault"".   those are your words not mine   Would you like me to copy/paste your first comment?   I find it hilarious that I have to spell it out for you.   This is the kicker.  Truly, you should take your own advice and think before you speak.  You seem to just keep spewing out terms you've learned in first year psychology.   Do you ever search for information, studies or what have you which actually states that there are women interested in shorter men? Based on everything you have said, I am going to go out on a limb and say no. You're only interested in information which validates your feelings. (Confirmation bias)   Have YOU?!?  Holy shit what a weird thing to say without actually doing it yourself first.  I think we've found the problem. Time and time and time and time and time again you'll find the same results: generally* (* important edit), women like tall men more.  Shocking.   I really cannot explain how I am not choosing to put my beliefs before the values of women.   That's a good way to remove guilt from yourself. I'll explain it in a term you might have learned: cognitive dissonance.  For the record, I don't actually think you're some woman hating prick.  Obviously you aren't.  I used the word on a small whim, similar to the way it's often used to describe short men.  How does it feel?"
tall,35ufr5,ShortyShuvnstuff,-5,Thu May 14 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"There we go now we are using logic and not just throwing around emotion. We all spell things wrong, auto correct loves to screw with you. It takes an adult to admit he is wrong and I appreciate your ability to admit that. Not an easy things to do, I will be the first to admit that.  I am not fully criticizing the source, it looks to be a sound study gone about in a scientific way. However, Geoffery trying to use it as a representation of the majority of women. No, the only thing it represents is the viewpoint of 1000 women in the Los Angeles and surrounding areas. That doesn't mean the data is wrong, obviously from the study their data is sound. However to turn around and say that the survey of 1000 women from Yahoo Personal Ads is in any way shape or form is a good or even okay representation of women.. that is a ridiculous.   I came up with stating that the dating pool is 4% again directly due to the fact that Geoffery keeps saying 96% of women wouldn't date shorter men. If 96% wouldn't date shorter men, that only leaves 4% of women for shorter males to choose from. It is a wrong statement on my part as a direct reciprocation from the argument with Geoffery I stated. But no, I shouldn't use a wrong interpretation of the study as ""evidence"" that it only leaves a 4% pool for the rest. That is very poor on my part. I will admit that. I shouldn't be trying to combat stupid with more stupid.   It's all in your language. I wouldn't have even made that claim without knowing I'd have some examples to stuff right back in your mouth. Not once have I said I'm insecure about my height, or even revealed any feelings toward it at all. That's all on you.   I already tried citing other studies (in an earlier post to Geoffery) which has data which is not necessarily in favor of shorter men. However does show that the numbers are not as astronomically against shorter men as it had been stated. I have been using blanket statements to you as if I was still speaking to Geoffery with the information which I provided for him. That is wrong of me, I am speaking to two very different individuals. Which also is (I came to realize) the studies I stated are poor to show due to the fact that I have access to the studies due to school. Which was brought to my attention that others cannot access due to the fact they don't have the same access as I have. However in relation to him Journal of Family Issues > an Imgr picture of a chart . One study of 1000 women < two studies I cited from reputable journals.   Again you contradict youself. Do you believe the solution to this is ""confidence""? Would you tell somebody with depression or anxiety that they ""just don't have confidence""?   Your words, the original statement was about BDD and then you're speaking about depression or anxiety as if they are all correlated. How you treat each one of these disorders is very different and there is no blanket panacea for all of them. I wish there was as then treatment would be a lot easier. However it is not, if your credentials are honest you will be keenly aware of.   Have YOU?!? Holy shit what a weird thing to say without actually doing it yourself first.   Well yes, I read 4 different studies. All of which inevitably had the same general outcome. Males shorter than a particular woman are going to have a harder time making a relationship with them than someone who is taller. However not even close to to wild claims that were being made. Does 4 studies make me an expert.. absolutely in no way shape or form. My goal wasn't to become an expert. That would truly take an extensive amount of research. My goal was to show that it was not the ridiculously small pool that which was it was trying to be portrayed as. And that there are studies out there that show that the outlandish claim is not even close to an accurate representation. I never even really gave this idea a thought until my posts became so ""popular"" for lack of a better word. I have a genuine interest in it now even if just for my own curiosity.    That's a good way to remove guilt from yourself. I'll explain it in a term you might have learned: cognitive dissonance.    There is a lot of validity to this statement. However my point here was not and is not to defend myself and what others view me as. I know how I think and view women. I don't feel a desire to prove how I feel about women to strangers. I really could not care less if everyone wants to think of me as an ass hole or misogynist. I know who/what I am, that's all I care about. In all honesty I do have some distrust from women stemming from being cheated on by SO. But by no means would I allow a few women to make me lump all women into one category. That is unfair and only hurts me and my ability to find a woman which is right for me. They are not all the same, there are a lot of wonderful women out there. Just haven't met the girl for me yet. Thought I have before, got hurt, learned from my experience and have moved on.  I like this side of you better, logic and reasoning. Something I was unable to get from anyone else. I don't mind having a healthy discussion, which was not where this conversation was headed in the beginning. I have felt attacked from the beginning so I threw up my guard and was instantly on the offensive. I would not mind having a true discussion over this. As I stated earlier, I am genuinely interested in this due to how my posts have been viewed. I don't mind if I am wrong, being wrong is a great way to learn what the truth is. I would love to have a real discussion over this. I would also like to offer the ability to have this discussion over messaging rather than blowing up this thread any further. Especially since this topic has steered away from what this post was about. I hope you're able to view this in the logical light that your recent post has now changed to."

tall,35ufr5,Nickjaw,5,Thu May 14 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"No one from r/short is saying that their pool of women is 4%. The study says that the pool of women who are taller than you and are willing to date you is around 4%. Short men still date shorter women. The MAJOR problem occurs when you're OP's height and the vast majority of women are taller than you. Of that N number of women that are taller than you, only 4% are likely to be willing to date you. And the shorter you are the larger N becomes.   I'm surprised that you are surprised by this. Is you still have doubts, simply take the ""Pepsi Challenge"" that I mentioned earlier."
tall,35ufr5,GeoffreyArnold,-5,Thu May 14 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"You don't know how to read a study then. The ""N"" only refers to the number of women in the study. Which was 1000 women IN THAT STUDY. That number doesn't change unless the number of women in the study changes. Your made up ""challenge"" gives no representation of what women want.  By you stating that the number of women ""N"" changes shows your inability to comprehend studies. Which is ever so evident with your wild 96% of women wouldn't date a shorter man."
tall,35ufr5,PanaceaIV,6,Thu May 14 18:11:53 2015 UTC,"Jesus....you're reading my comments so fast that you are just making assumptions about what I mean without actually looking to see what I mean.  The N that I am referring to has nothing to do with the study.    Listen closely.    96% of women will not date a man who is shorter than them.  Let's take this as true so that I can explain something to you.    Now, short men can still date shorter women, but they are at a some ""X"" disadvantage with even shorter women when compared to taller men.    But here, we are only talking about women who are taller than a given man.  Let's call that value ""N"".    So, a 5'8"" man would be at some X disadvantage with a shorter woman versus a 6'0"" man.  But that same 5'8"" man will have a 96% rejection rate with N women (where N = # of women > 5'8"").    So naturally, 5'6"" men have a greater ""N"" value than 5'8"" men, and 5'4"" men would have a greater ""N"" value than 5'6"" men.  All I am saying is that the shorter a man is, the more women there are who will be taller than him.  And of THAT pool of women, he should only expect 4% to be receptive to his advances.    So, OP is 4'11"".  According to the CDC, that means that only about 3% of women are shorter than him.  Ergo, he has some ""X"" probability of dating that 3% of women, but he only has a 4% probability of dating (serious relationship) the other 97% of women.    Confidence has nothing to do with it.  It's statistics.  And it's really shitty of you to blame shift OP and other short guys in his situation as if this is somehow their fault."

To which you ignored any of that and kept on with your ludicrous claims. If you came with more than 1 study of 1000 women I would be way more incline to having a discussion.  I don't care at all about your one study of 1000 women in the LA area. You are continuing to use this study as a representation of all women. If you change the amount of women in a study and the area the women are from. You better believe that the ""4%"" would also change. You keep trying to use this study as an undeniable source representing women as a whole. You cannot use a study of 1000 women from one area and blanket it to all women. Which you are still, even in this post, continuing to do. I don't want to play the ""well let us just pretend"" game. Facts and real stats or you're just making wild claims. You're now just trying to add in some statistical probability while still using a source that has an extremely small sample size and location.  Let me help you so you can rephrase your statements.   According to 1 study of 1000 women in the LA area. A shorter man can expect only about 4% of women, whom are taller than him, to be receptive to his advances.

Confidence isn't meaningless, but it's less important than height, money, ""looks"", etc (as a general rule). Also, the Male-Taller-Norm has been called the ""paramount rule of dating"" in the western world. The chances of a shorter guy taller girl couple is something like 860 to 1. Another study showed that 96% of women surveyed said they would never consider dating a shorter man. It's not about male confidence and it's shitty for /u/PanaceaIV to blame short men for something that isn't their fault."

Confidence is the single biggest factor in practically anything.

It's just not totally relevant to the discussion.  The odds of a couple violating the male-taller-norm is 720:1.  Plus, at least one study has shown that 96% of women surveyed said that they wouldn't consider dating a shorter man.  And yet, you're saying that this is because shorter men lack ""confidence""?  Seriously?  How can that be possible?   ....but even after that a guy can still get it with most women if hes confident in himself.   Let's back up.  We are talking about the male-taller-norm in this thread.  /u/PanaceaIV attacked short men based on a picture of a short man and taller woman who aren't even a real couple.  To be clear, are you seriously saying right now that a short guy can date most women who are taller than him (that's 51% of taller women - even though the survey says that his pool is closer to 4%), simply by being ""confident in himself""?

There is nothing ""cynical"" about posting studies which reveal a social reality.  Just because something is unpleasant doesn't make it untrue.     Saying someone attacked an entire group of people which just isn't true.    But he did attack short men generally.  He said ""Maybe one day shorter men will accept that their height has nothing to do with their ability (or lack of) with women.""  This is blame-shifting.  It's not short men who have a problem with women (generally speaking).  It's women who have a problem with short men (generally speaking).  This isn't an opinion.  It's fact.  Every study ever done on the subject shows that the height bias is with women...not with men.  And I'm not saying that short men are owed love or affection.  I'm just saying that we shouldn't attack short men because they were born with something that most women in our culture deem unacceptable."

I've always found that an easy way to discuss this matter is by using ""The Halo Effect"" I'm sure you know what it is. We tend to attribute positive things on people that we view in a ""positive light"". For an example: We could see someone as ""confident"" and another could see that same person as ""arrogant"" PanaceaIV seems to be ""suffering"" from Just-world fallacy and is likely making these generalising, because of how he view short people (men here) and this is where ""The Halo Effect"" comes in."

Can you spot the fake(s)!? 9 in 10 women find humor to be the most important personality trait.   Instead of taking any form of personal accountability. You choose to blame extrinsic factors. But here is the real data so you can use this ACTUAL data the next time you feel like spouting off a bunch of bullshit. (Rule 1 of making up statistics. Never be anywhere close to 100%.)   According to probability theory, the chance expectation for the occurrence of couples with females taller was 2/100. The actual value found was only 1/720, which was seen as supporting the notion of a male-taller norm.   doi: 10.1177/014616728063010 Pers Soc Psychol Bull September 1980 vol. 6 no. 3 396-401  Pretty substantial difference than your made up value. Odds still are not in your favor but not as bad as the value you made up. Now time for your ridiculous claim:   Forty-nine percent of women only wanted to date men who were taller than they were, whereas only 13.5 percent of men only wanted to date women shorter than they were.    Published online before print January 21, 2014, doi:10.1177/0192513X13519256 Journal of Family Issues January 21, 20140192513X13519256  That's 49%, not your outrageous 96% claim. But I am the idiot. Yup, shorter men have it a little bit harder. Fat guys have it a little bit harder. Blind people have it a little bit harder. Deaf people have it a little bit harder. Poor people have it a little bit harder. Are you healthy? We're you able to eat today? Both your legs work? Do you have two arms? Be thankful for what you have.  Stop making excuses and be the best version of yourself. If a women doesn't like you for you. She wouldn't have liked you if you were a foot or more taller. Shut up and move on.   Edit: This really got me thinking. I am a certified personal trainer. Do you know how many bigger guys come in with the notion ""Well if I was skinnier, women will like me.""? So far every single one of them, except one, has been gravely mistaken. You know why? Because their weight had VERY little to do with their ""luck"" with women. The one guy that it did work for didn't have that mindset. He came in to better himself. To be healthier. Sure he said a lot of the same things (jokingly, whereas the others were quite serious) but he had the confidence all along. He just didn't know it. Whereas the others did it with an expectation their ""luck"" would just change. Where the others quit shortly after realizing that their weight loss wasn't a magic aphrodisiac. The one guy that had a good head on his shoulders still comes in and works out. He just doesn't pay me anymore. I would gladly bet money that if I took a shorter guy. Magically made him tall. He would still pull the same number of women as he did before."
tall,35ufr5,PanaceaIV,7,Thu May 14 00:19:42 2015 UTC,"The 96% Geoff mentioned isn't made up man.   Here is an article that mentions that study.   Other studies have shown different numbers of course depending on the populations surveyed, the age range, the year it was done, etc.  Anyway, from that above article:   a whopping 89 percent of women said the shortest person they would date would still have to be taller than them. Only seven percent would accept someone who was their height, and just four percent would allow for a shorter guy.   In the studies you linked it doesn't show (at least from what you quoted) what the percentages were that would date someone shorter.   If you're going to use statistics and reference a study you should be comparing the same thing instead of doing the ol' apples and oranges thing.      If 49% would only date someone taller that doesn't mean 51% would date someone shorter.   There's a middle spot there, the ever important ""same height"" number. Once the person goes into the ""shorter"" range it gets quite a bit more difficult.  Do you have access to the full study for both of the ones you linked?   Because your links you posted just have the abstracts unless you pay (are a member of the site).    I'm curious what the full data shows when it comes to the ""shorter than"" part.   Just from personal experience my height has been given as the reason for rejection more than anything else.   You'd be surprised how quickly things turn for the worse when the height question comes up, even if the conversation was very positive and plans being made beforehand.    Confidence, social skills and having common interests with the other person very rarely negates the damage the 5'0"" bomb does when it's dropped :P"
tall,35ufr5,JohnGM,-4,Thu May 14 01:49:30 2015 UTC,"I wish I could share the full data with you. I am able to access it through my school. I am not willing to give my school log in and password for obvious reasons. I would copy and paste the full articles for you however to avoid any type of lawsuit (despite how minute) I am going to decline that as well (it's actually in the terms and conditions of using the website through school. Yeah I am one of those nerds that actually read the terms and conditions). I feel bad that I used articles which you guys don't have access to. That is poor investigative reporting on my part.  As far as the article you guys are referencing. I just stated this in my other post but I feel that is deserves to be said again. Huffington Post is NOT a reputable source. In fact, let me quote something from the article itself to hopefully drive home the kind of ""reporting"" they are doing.   ABC News conducted an unscientific experiment to explore how willing women were to date shorter men. They lined up several short men next to tall men, and asked women to choose a date.   So you asked a bunch of guys of varying heights to line up. Then asked a very small hand full of women to give their opinion on whether or not the would date them. First off, how did they choose these women? Are they all from the same area? This sample size and selection is not scientific in any way and so much so that they even said in the article that it is an ""unscientific experiment"". Don't take ""facts"" from an article with is even willing to blatantly tell you there is no science behind their research and take it as the gospel. You're smarter than that.  I am not saying height doesn't have an influence. It does have an influence on whether a woman will date you or not. I am not debating that. I will however strongly advocate that being confident in your own skin, being happy with who you are and letting that shine through. Will make most women not care about height and be more interested with who you are as a person. If she cannot look past your height and see that you have a lot to offer her. Then honestly, she is not a person you want to date to begin with. She is shallow and dating a shallow person will only lead to problems.   That is very unfortunate that a woman is willing to throw away someone who they are attracted to due to one physical aspect about a person. An aspect which you are unable to change, aside from wearing some thick soled shoes (but that is not really changing anything other than your perceived height). I get it, I really do, your dating pool is not the same as someone who is taller. But don't think that just because a guy is taller that the world opens up to us and all of the sudden every woman is pining for our affection. Being tall I can tell you first hand, first appearances of taller guys leads women to feel very intimidated by us. Which makes approaching a woman harder as well as they instantly view us as a threat. Not much I can do about it other than throw on a smile and be myself. We all have advantages and disadvantages. You just have to work with what you have and not constantly worry about things you cannot change. Keep putting yourself out there and someone is going to see your true colors and be thrilled to call you their SO.    Edit: Words"

Huffington Post is NOT a reputable source. In fact, let me quote something from the article itself to hopefully drive home the kind of ""reporting"" they are doing.   The huffington post isn't the source, it's just an article that references the study that was published on the topic.      There have been other studies too of course on the same topic and the numbers are always different but do show a very strong preference for sticking to the traditional ""male must be taller"" norm unfortunately.

You're smarter than that.   I wasn't talking about the ABC 20/20 news segment.   Though that is an interesting one to watch (the full video not just the dating part).     I was talking about the published study in a scientific journal that was being mentioned in that article I linked.     See the link I gave above for the actual paper on it.   I should have linked that earlier but didn't have it handy.  From their concluding comments at the end of their paper:   Our results highlight how powerful the male-taller norm is in the United States; very few individuals expressed willingness to break the norm when considering a dating partner despite the fact that it sharply limits one’s dating pool, particularly for tall women and short men.  Although endorsement of gender role ideology was only weakly related to preferences for height in our sample, the association was in a promising direction for future research. Specifically, research is needed to examine whether social awareness programs that challenge traditional gender norms can help to ameliorate the stigma faced by tall women and short men and expand people’s range of acceptable dating partners."
tall,35ufr5,JohnGM,-4,Thu May 14 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"Ok I see where you guys are getting the 96%.   For women, the vast majority indicated that the shortest per- son they would date would still be taller than them (89%), with only a small minority being willing to accept a mate who was their height (7%) or shorter (4%).   You guys are overlooking a very important fact. Idk if you are doing so conciously or if you're just not fully reading the study...   5.1.1. Participants We coded personal advertisements available on Yahoo Personals for heterosexual individuals within 250 miles of Los Angeles, California, USA (men seeking women, N = 1000; women seeking men, N = 1000). The average reported age was 37.2 (SD = 9.8) for men and 34.8 (SD = 9.9) for women. Our sample was ethnically diverse for both men (545 White, 226 Black, 69 Hispanic, 60 Asian, and 79 Other) and women (465 White, 208 Black, 120 Hispanic, 101 Asian, and 92 Other).   This study is taking its data from Yahoo Personal Ads for one. Not a respectable representation of women. And only 1000 women within 250 miles of Los Angels, California. Ever been to LA? Shallow, vain (yet quite attractive) females. Horrible depiction for ALL of women. Putting the location aside and the implications of the superficial nature of LA (and surrounding areas). Let us just look at the numbers.  This survey involved 1000 women.....Around 49.6 percent of the world's population is female, giving a total female population of around 3.52 billion in the world as of 2014. Let us do a little math.   1000/3,520,000,000 = 0.0000002841  Change this into a percentage:  0.0000002841 x 100 = 0.00002841%  Rewritten: 2.841x10-5 %  You cannot tell me that you're going to say 2.841x10-5 % of women from this one survey get to speak for the entire population of women. Guys.. just step back and honestly think about that.   Edit: /u/GeoffreyArnold to put your statistic into real world context. I did some math on the study you're so fond of referencing. If you can't appreciate the real world numbers. Then you really are as cynical as you come off to be."
tall,35ufr5,PanaceaIV,5,Thu May 14 04:30:01 2015 UTC,"Of course the 96% number is not perfect and doesn't speak for the entire population of women.    It wasn't meant to or they probably would have gathered data from all over the world.  If they did that they would have found that the results differed greatly depending on which country the person was from.       They openly admitted to the limitations of their study later in the paper.  You could dismiss nearly any survey and study done on people's thoughts on a topic as having too small of a sample size for the entire population using the reasoning you gave.   They weren't trying to speak for the entire population of women though.  They were mainly looking at the U.S. and how height matters in dating in the U.S.    Not too surprisingly they found that it matters quite a lot.    Were their results a perfect representation of women in the U.S.?    Of course not.  Just like how the studies you linked probably had their own imperfect samples, this one did as well.     Along with other surveys and studies done on the topic though it does show evidence that there is a major preference for the ""man must be taller than woman"" gender norm in our country.      That section you mentioned above (the yahoo personals) was just for one part of the study too.  They used undergrads from a university for a different part.      As for location, I do agree it is going to matter.    If you did a similar study in other parts of the world (like say Brazil for example) it would likely have much different results.    Some countries and cultures are less hung up on height than others.     Unfortunately the U.S. is one of those countries that is very hung up on height, not just in dating either.   Even that is going to differ by location and culture of the people living in the area though."

This isn't really about ""shallow"" versus not shallow.  You're at a University, right?  Simply ask any woman you see the question that we're talking about here.  Tell them you've got a friend that you'd like them to meet and you think they'd make a good couple.  Talk him up and say what a great personality he has and how much awesome ""confidence"" he has.    Then drop the bombshell on her.  Tell her that your friend is three inches shorter than her.  Not a whole 18 inches, like OP and his ""date"".  Just three inches shorter.  And see what happens.    You don't even need to report back on what happened.  Because I already know what happened.  If you asked 100 women if they want to be set up on this blind date, you'd probably get between 97 and 100 ""no's"".    This is the result of how height is viewed in our society.  It's not an issue that is directly the fault of women, and it doesn't make them ""shallow"" because one woman finds important what all the women whom she's ever known finds important."

That's 49%, not your outrageous 96% claim. But I am the idiot. Yup, shorter men have it a little bit harder.    Actually, that's a real statistic.  In case you didn't know, more than one study was done on this subject.  the one I'm using said that 96% of women surveyed said that they wouldn't date a shorter man and 47% of men surveyed said that they wouldn't date a taller woman.    But don't take my word for it.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alison-denisco/dating-women-men-whos-taller_b_1527117.html   Nearly half of men in the study indicated that their tallest acceptable date could be taller than them or their height (24 and 23 percent, respectively), while 53 percent required their date to be shorter than them. But a whopping 89 percent of women said the shortest person they would date would still have to be taller than them. Only seven percent would accept someone who was their height, and just four percent would allow for a shorter guy.   Now ask a tall woman which statistic she thinks is more accurate.  That only 13.5% of men care if the woman is taller or that 47% of men care if the woman is taller.      Stop making excuses and be the best version of yourself. If a women doesn't like you for you. She wouldn't have liked you if you were a foot or more taller.    This is patently false.  Even women will tell a short man ""I would date you if you were taller"".  It's pretty common.  Women don't put height requirements on their dating profile because they think that all shorter men will be bad people with bad personalities.    Quit living in a fantasy world.  Courtship is an amoral endeavor.  No one owes anyone any sex or affection.  But don't bullshit people or blame the people who have a much harder time than you based on things that are out of their control.     Because their weight had VERY little to do with their ""luck"" with women.   You do realize that weight is not the same thing as height, right?  Weight is to men what height is to women.  Men care A LOT about a woman's weight and women care A LOT about a man's height.  You wouldn't tell an obese woman that it's her personality and not her weight which limit her options, would you?

So there are no women out there at all which would find a nice guy to be attractive? Wow your view on attraction is very skewed my friend.  You falsely remembered a statistic  with a 19.4% error. Not much of anything you can do in this world with a near 20% error and still have it be viable.  I am sorry I do not take a tumbler image of a chart as any sort of scientific data WHAT SO EVER. I can make a chart, upload it to tumbler and pretend it is fact. I can also take a facebook quiz to find out which Harry Potter character I am most like. Your data is garbage.   Actually, that's a real statistic. In case you didn't know, more than one study was done on this subject. the one I'm using said that 96% of women surveyed said that they wouldn't date a shorter man and 47% of men surveyed said that they wouldn't date a taller woman.   Again, you're using a huffington post article? Yeah I am sorry I will stick with an article from the Journal of Family Issues. A Reputable source of information. Which puts out research which is peer reviewed and doesn't have a conflict of interest. Unlike the huffington post which is renown for using shock and awe to gain readers. Since at the end of the day, all they care about is how many readers they have. Because that means money, which again is all they really care about. Not scientific honesty. I can go out and find 1 girl that would date a shorter guy and say ""Whelp according to a survey I took, 100% of women would date shorter men."" Come on, trying to have an intelligent debate here. Right now you're spewing crap to further your biased agenda.   Now ask a tall woman which statistic she thinks is more accurate. That only 13.5% of men care if the woman is taller or that 47% of men care if the woman is taller.   I think I already proved my point how asking ONE person is dumb and would not be a valid sample size. She isn't an expert in the field, hasn't done any research into the subject. It would be only HER opinion.   ""If a women doesn't like you for you. She wouldn't have liked you if you were a foot or more taller."" This is patently false. Even women will tell a short man ""I would date you if you were taller"". It's pretty common. Women don't put height requirements on their dating profile because they think that all shorter men will be bad people with bad personalities.   Obviously you are not reading what I wrote in the context which it was written. By your logic, if a couple was dating (or even married) and then for whatever reason the man became wheelchair bound. Reducing his height. She would instantaneously be unattracted to him due to the fact he is now shorter than her? Wow, I would really hate to live in your world. Where there is no affection other than surface attraction.   You do realize that weight is not the same thing as height, right? Weight is to men what height is to women. Men care A LOT about a woman's weight and women care A LOT about a man's height. You wouldn't tell an obese woman that it's her personality and not her weight which limit her options, would you? Well, would you?   Again, further proof that you are not reading what I am writing. You are reading how you want to read it and then skewing what I am saying. The MEN lost weight and were expecting their dating life to all of the sudden sky rocket. As if their PHYSICAL APPEARANCE (yup, weight can be changed and height cannot. However both are physical attributes) was the panacea to their problems. Well guess what, it is their attitude and confidence with themselves which is their problem. Not their physical appearance. If an over weight woman was a bitch? Hell yeah it is her personality which limits her options, her weight wouldn't help either. Does her weight also affect her options? Sure it does. However what you're saying is that an overweight woman cannot have an awesome personality which wins over men? I will answer that for you. Overweight or skinny, a beautiful mind is way more attractive. Again, your view of the world is really messed up.   I personally don't date really attractive women who have horrendous personalities. And I know I am not the only one. Because first and foremost, I care about how a person acts. Not how they look. But that's just my opinion. There are men out there who would be content with a shallow yet attractive woman. But you better believe they are going to be living in utter hell due to caring more about physical attractiveness than what a woman has going on in her mind.  The more you speak the more I am becoming aware that you see the world through a tinted lens. A lens that I am very glad I don't have to look through because I would have no confidence and be stuck believing in only made up statistics which mirror my skewed point of view of the world."

tall,35wctj,rh0p,1 point,Fri May 15 00:59:26 2015 UTC,"Hey awesome, they do have some options, and they're on sale right now for $30!  I've just ordered a couple, will try them out.  Thanks!"
tall,35rsnf,backup_username,30,Tue May 12 23:47:32 2015 UTC,I decided to try out The Limited's tall online store. I originally ordered too big of a size because I didn't realize they size their talls differently. I normally fit in a 2 or 4 but had to send it back for a 0.   It fits awesomely!  The waist is at my actual waist. The hem is at a tasteful length. Even the darts are in the right spot!
tall,35rsnf,thepeterjohnson,11,Wed May 13 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"Well, you look lovely in it...  But what are ""the darts?"""
tall,35rsnf,RockyMotion,16,Wed May 13 03:52:32 2015 UTC,It's a sewing thing that shapes the boob area.
tall,35rsnf,DTX1989,12,Wed May 13 04:06:44 2015 UTC,That's the best kind of sewing thing!
tall,35rsnf,Adip0se,3,Wed May 13 11:58:46 2015 UTC,"Men's shirts can have them, too. It's worth getting a tailor to put them on dress shirts if you find that they fit well in the chest but have a lot of extra fabric in the stomach."
tall,35rsnf,Adip0se,5,Wed May 13 12:40:33 2015 UTC,"Darting a shirt is probably the best thing ever for your silhouette, other than being swole."

tall,35rsnf,Salaciouslysera,2,Wed May 13 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already, check out Long Tall Sally.  My first purchase from them included a nice jacket and my very first reaction on putting it one was ""omg the sleeves are actually long enough!""  They came to the just past the wrist bone and not an inch or so above it like everything else I owned.  I was so happy.  The rest of the the fit was perfect too."
tall,35rsnf,Second_Thoughs,2,Wed May 13 14:54:49 2015 UTC,They just opened a store in Denver. Their clothing style seems a little to mature for my tastes from what I saw. I probably get stuff from there eventually though.
tall,35rsnf,cluelesssquared,1 point,Wed May 13 19:12:12 2015 UTC,I would say only get something from long tall Sally (neé tall girls) if you are 100% in love with it. Their quality has really decreased in the last few years which is really disappointing! But definitely check it out it's always good to have options.
tall,35rsnf,_b_e_a_t_l_e_s_1969,1 point,Thu May 14 03:58:40 2015 UTC,Also they did recently start a new line called TTYA  (Taller Than Your Average) which seems to be catering to a younger look.  You may have to g online for that though.  Just a thought.
tall,35rsnf,BiancaEstrella,11,Fri May 15 16:42:06 2015 UTC,Nice.  I think it's harder to find a dress that goes to the waist than it is for length.
tall,35rsnf,Allorrarbor,3,Wed May 13 01:46:44 2015 UTC,Very nice look and it fits like it was made especially for your size! Great find OP!
tall,35rsnf,Allorrarbor,3,Wed May 13 03:08:34 2015 UTC,That's a very pretty color!
tall,35rsnf,Oh_PickleShoes,3,Wed May 13 03:35:21 2015 UTC,That's an adorable dress and it reminds me of Honeylemon from big hero six. I lover her character and how she wears high heels even though she's already ridiculously tall.
tall,35rsnf,wolfyne,6,Wed May 13 07:36:15 2015 UTC,"So crazy, I originally bought the dress to cosplay as her for the Denver comic con.

tall,35rsnf,Mo_Man-AU,1 point,Wed May 13 07:17:28 2015 UTC,I couldn't find it either so that's why I decided to try it out. I'm looking into getting some of their button ups next to see how the length of the arms are.
tall,35rsnf,heywoods,0,Wed May 13 12:27:23 2015 UTC,"I am 5'8"" 1/2 and quite busty, so I need longer ""length"" than typical girls my height to accommodate them or I show more leg than I'm comfortable with.  Tall clothing fits better due to this, but not if it's made for 6'+ women only (5'10""-5'11"" is fine). Edit: I seriously can't find the height range anywhere, though."

tall,35v7gf,reallyattractivegirl,5,Wed May 13 20:02:55 2015 UTC,How would this be any different than just a regular dating/R4R/social site/sub?
tall,35v7gf,lottikey,-3,Wed May 13 22:20:16 2015 UTC,It is more customized and made for redditors
tall,35v7gf,lottikey,2,Wed May 13 22:30:19 2015 UTC,So it would be one or two like in your title?  One would probably make more sense IMO.
tall,35v7gf,lottikey,1 point,Wed May 13 22:35:17 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree, maybe the two in my title combined would be best?"
tall,35v7gf,lottikey,1 point,Wed May 13 23:48:13 2015 UTC,"I would think so, because if it's split by gender (Short Guy/Tall Girl, Short Girl/Tall Guy) then non-hetero folks would be confused on where to go.  But I can see a bunch of average height people posting so would it be exclusive or not really and wouldn't that defeat the purpose if so?"
tall,35v7gf,VaguerCrusader,2,Wed May 13 23:56:35 2015 UTC,True. Well I can see it being a place for even average height folks with a preference for either tall or short dates. I happen to like GrandBuba's idea about merging tallmeettall and short4short into one subreddit.

tall,35v7gf,samesmile,4,Thu May 14 05:03:55 2015 UTC,I think the inherent problem with having two of them is that people would need to post in one and browse on the other.

That doesn't sound as great out loud as it does in your head OP, if you want a lot of arguing because a short girl likes a tall guy or anything that can ruffle the feathers of either side, you will have a schism and things will probably go back to how it is now. There is a /r/Tall4Tall and /r/short4short as you mentioned. You even included one for everyone r4r so why couldn't a girl or guy on there say what they are looking for? Pretty sure of you are looking for a SO you won't subjugate yourself to one specific place. Kind of like how people use more than one dating website. So you want to create a sub for something that there already is? I'm not telling you not to do it I'm just telling you good luck with handling what comes with some turmoil that will probably come up from it."
tall,35v7gf,GrandBuba,1 point,Wed May 13 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"Well yes r4r exists for general dating but, similar to tallmeettall, what if someone has a preference for either a taller or shorter partner, wouldn't tall4short or short4tall be the best place for them instead of navigating through r4r people of various sizes?

tall,35qfmj,HeTookTheOffer,35,Tue May 12 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"I feel the need to say something, since I started the thread you're referencing. I want to make a few things clear, before another big, long argument is started:      I started the thread because I was recently made aware that some groups exclude women under 5'10, and wanted to hear what the women from the under-5'10 category felt about it.    The only opinion I openly voiced was: ""The mens and womens height requirements should be the same for both sexes. (I.e, If a man needs to be 4 inches taller than average to attend a tall event, that same rule of 4-inches should also apply to women.)""     Due to excessive down-voting, and off-the-cuff remarks about what height warrants the label tall in women, the entire discussion was derailed, and most of the respondents were over 5'10. (Which is fine, but I was looking for thoughts and opinons from the women that were being excluded.) While I got to openly voice my opinons, the opinons of quite a lot of women were down-voted or ignored due to the rants, and criticisms about a sub-discussion that wasn't in any way a part of the main discussion.       I love this place, and I really wish we could have real conversations, without all of the hate. That's one thing that I presume would greatly improve this sub, and make it a truly safe space.

tall,35qfmj,ingloriousmanterds,9,Tue May 12 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"You're actually on the tall side of the spectrum, with girls in the 5'7-5'8 range being on the shorter side. Women that are 6 feet (just an inch taller) are taller than 99.5 percent of the female population.    Women over 6 feet are scarce, and shouldn't be used as reference point for defining what the start point of tall is. That would be like me saying to tall dudes, ""you have to be at least 6'8 to be considered tall."" or ""If you're not NBA-tall, you're short"" Do you see the problem, here?  I'm almost 5 inches taller than a man that's 6'5, but that doesn't negate the fact that he's still fucking 6'5, and taller than more than 90% of the population. Just as being 2 inches taller than a 5'9 girl doesn't negate the fact that she's taller than more than 80% of the female population"

This sub champions the view that the taller you are the inherently better you are. This can be seen in threads where it is implied Tall guys are ""wasting"" their height on short girls when they don't date tall girls or when users ""one up"" each other in comment chains where taller and taller individuals show up to say ""nya im taller than you""   Because of this when someone noticeably shorter than you walks in on your club and tries to say they are just as ""good"" as you it rubs you the wrong way since they don't have the height to back that sentiment up. Being tall gives you access to a whole community and it isn't the same if this community just lets anyone in.  Interesting side note, if this is the case why does it only seem that tallish women receive the backlash and not similarly heighted tallish men (women in the 5'7-5'8"" range vs men in the 6'0-6'1"" range). Is it cause they are shorter? Is it cause shorter women are usually more sought after than tall women? Is it because no one cares when a man claims he's tall when he is closer to average?

I was much taller than everyone else. Teachers didn't bother to learn my name, it was just ""hey tall kid"". When people gave each other nicknames...mine was always to do with my height. When I was bullied...it was because of my height. For a while it felt like my whole identity was my height. That was who I was, the girl who was very tall.  And then you come on somewhere like here and actually I'm not that tall anymore and its weird. Because I never really had anything except my being tall.

So guys either ignore it altogether, brush it off by acknowledging it but not saying anything else about it, or by joking about it.    Ladies tend to do the same thing with the exception that they feel freer (or more I dunno, empowered?) expressing anger over it and getting sympathy/empathy for it.

It's not attractive to attack people, belittle them or berate them for what they look like or forcing your opinion on them coz what you think they believe is wrong.   People from all over the place have different averages depending on where they live. I get approached by people who are around the 6 foot 4 mark or smaller and are taken a back by my height.  ""WOW!

tall,35qfmj,hitcakes,1 point,Tue May 12 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I do get frustrated when I see women nearly a foot shorter than me complaining about being tall. I understand that compared to national averages or whatever they are tall, but compared to myself they're just not. Really I'm envious, because ""tall for a girl"" girls seem to be idolized a lot (see models) and their complaints sometimes seem like humble brags.   I know I'm an exception and not the standard, and hence shouldn't be used as a measure for what is considered tall. I also know that even the ""tall for a girl"" girls feel out of place and insecure about their height. So while I do get frustrated and envious, I mostly try keep it to myself.   But when I see those girls posting, I'm reluctant to join in because of that frustration. The thread for how the under 5'10"" crowd feel was a prime example, and I can't really fault the people who voiced their frustrations in it."
tall,35qfmj,Dagnatic,4,Wed May 13 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"By your example though, that would be like a 7'2 male complaining I don't know what it's like to be tall, because I'm 9"" shorter than he is. Which is fair enough, I have no idea what life is like for somebody who is 7'+, but that doesn't take away from the fact that not just by national averages, compared to everyone I meet, I am tall. My height, and where I'm from are defining features of who I am and how people view me when they meet me.   Somebody who is 5'9"" may not be comparatively tall to you or I. Now somebody who is 5'9"" and female is comparatively tall to almost anyone else they meet and it's still a defining feature of how people view them. Though they may not be as tall as other's or that much taller than others, their height, and depending on when they got their height, has had an effect on their childhood and how people treated them.  Given the averages of height of 5'10"" and 5'5"" for Men and women respectivley [here in Australia at least] I'm 7"" taller than the average male, whihc possibly means my expirience are coparitively similar to that of a female who is also 7"" taller than the average i.e. 6'0"". which in your instance, at 6'6"", being 13"" taller than the average, your experiences are possibly more comparable to that of a  6'11"" male, which is possibly why you may find it difficult to sympathise with those who are, whilst still being taller than the average, are still much shorter than you.  I'll admit I'm very guilt of much the same thing, when sombody who is 6"" shorter than me complains about their hight, I find it difficult to sympathise as at that point, whilst they are trying to sympathise with me, they have no point of reference to fully understand the life expirence that have entailed due to my height."

tall,35qfmj,THROWINCONDOMSATSLUT,2,Wed May 13 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you.  The US census has documented heights for females that show the different percentiles at each height.  The 50th percentile is at about 5'4.5"" (somewhere between 5'4"" and 5'5"") in stature.  My height is between the 94th percentile and the 98th percentile.  Do you really mean to tell me that I wouldn't be considered tall even though I'm taller than 94-98% of girls my age (early 20s)?  Yes, you're tall; there's no questioning that.  The fact that you wouldn't consider somebody below 6' as a female to be tall is ridiculous.  According to the census, you are taller than nearly every female in the US.  How can you measure tall as being taller than 99.9% of the population?  That's just so unrealistic."
tall,35qfmj,hitcakes,1 point,Wed May 13 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"Youre above average in height by the stats. But yeh, tall is often defined by the fringe not the average imo.

I recognise my feelings are petty and irrational. But at the same time, id give almost anything to be under 6'. As i said in my opening post, its envy. And that breeds frustration.   EDIT - 5'9"" is 94th percentile for women, and 42nd percentile for men. There's someone on the front page atm calling himself a shortie at 5'8"" and asking how to get taller. You may have experience feeling taller than other girls your age, but not being tall in society in general. I guess thats the distinction im talking about."

Say someone is 400lbs overweight, more than 99.9% of the population. But now someone who is ""only"" 200lbs overweight (morbidly obese by BMI standards) starts complaining that they're fat. Can the person overweight by 400lbs say to them ""you're not fat, shut up. You don't understand what it's like to be fat. I wish I was only 200lbs overweight.""  I mean, they can say they don't know what it's like to be 400 lbs overweight, but they can't say they don't know what it's like to be fat."

My conclusion is that ""tallness"" and the associated problems are experiential, contextual, and more than the numbers on a scale. So who am I to say someone doesn't experience ""being tall"" for any reason?   I hate being as tall as I am. I am still likely to be frustrated by anyone under 6' complaining about their height in a petty ""you have no idea"" way, but im gonna work on not letting that bother me.   But to answer your question - is 200lbs overweight now? For who? For those 5'5"" folk? I feel like with weight we have different words for different sizes (chubby, overweight, fat, obese) that we don't have with tall, and yeh I can definitely understand people who get kicked off planes for being too large being angry at someone whose holding onto a bit of a tummy saying they're ""too fat for new clothes"" or whatever.   I mean, 200lbs is like 90kg? I'm around that, and I certainly feel pretty chunky at the moment but I definitely don't know what it's like to deal with ""being fat"" in society. Maybe that's part of the distinction? The personal feelings and struggles we have with our own bodies, and how that differs from the bullshit that gets heaped on us by others."
tall,35qfmj,aurora_lights,1 point,Fri May 15 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"No, sorry, I meant overweight by 200 pounds (to get around this ""depends on the height"" issue), but I didn't make myself clear. My bad! So, someone with 400 pounds to lose vs. someone with 200 pounds to lose. Obviously both of them will want to smack someone who complains about losing 1 pound, so your views are also completely understandable. That's why comparing heights to the population average and what percentile you fall in makes more sense than asking the tallest person what tall is.

This isn't a thing that happens constantly here.  Anyway, I see more of this than anything else:   At first it was just short girls, and I get that. This is a ""safe place"" for talls, and anyone that's short or average should kind of fall in line."

You're trying to justify this behavior but if you go and look at that thread, you'll see that it wasn't directed toward all women. A tall (who I think is over 5'10, not sure) wanted to know how shorter talls feel about being excluded, and the Tall Brigade came in, and made it so uncomfortable that only a few of them felt like they could reply.    It was close to 9 hours before most of the 5'9 girls came in and started talking.  This doesn't happen with men. I could care less if another man considers 6'1 or 6'2 tall, or average.

tall,35qfmj,krista17,10,Tue May 12 18:31:06 2015 UTC,I think it's an identity thing. People get butt hurt when they get told their paradigm is wrong.   For an example. I'm a 5'11 girl.

tall,35umi6,333beast,7,Wed May 13 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"You guys have it all wrong.  I've been observing a person that seems to be able to change their height, at will.  I've followed them and made detailed notes on their actions in order to figure out how, exactly, this person is able to do this.  And no, it's not some weird supernatural thing or magic, he isn't part of the X-Men or anything.  He's a college professor.  Currently I'm completing a degree in Bullshitting, and minoring in Smiling and Nodding.  It's not much, but it should open up a lot of doors for me in the future (and it's actually pretty informative and useful for real life.  Some courses include 'Responsible Jaywalking', 'Resisting the Urge to Slap a Dumbass', and of course 'Substance Use, Not Abuse').  Anyway, this particular professor is, naturally (I think) about 5'6"".  This I know from meeting with him in person in his office and estimating a ~2 inch difference.  However, during lecture, presumably a time when stature would be of great benefit, he appears to be at least 5'11"".  I've made this particular estimation by comparing the height of people that speak to him during the break, and comparing them to myself.  So far, he seems to have a pretty normal life.  I don't follow him around after class or anything, but my program takes place in a smaller building so you see the same faces all the time anyway.  I've noticed some patterns:   Coffee 30 minutes before each lecture in the morning. After the lecture, a poop.  Upon inspection, he doesn't flush (what the fuck?  Whatever...) and has a diet consisting of daily corn* intake. The rest of the day he is either lecturing or in his office, with one meal consisting of either a century egg, surströmming, goat's blood, or a big fat knuckle sandwich. Home life seems normal (except for the excess corn). *Meals consist mostly of corn-on-the-cob, corn-off-the-cob, corn flakes, corn balls and squares, corn holes, popcorn, and corny jokes.  Wine or beer with dinner. Normal sleep patterns. I like watching him sleep.   So, I think it has mostly to do with the corn and this gives him the ability to physically change his height on command.  I'm going to muster up the courage tomorrow to ask him if this is the truth, let me know if anybody wants to know what he says.  Update: I couldn't resist and emailed him instead. He's got a step in his podium. ...Fuck."
tall,35umi6,TheTallOne93,4,Thu May 14 01:12:12 2015 UTC,"Ib think it's a mix between magic and your diet. Genetics is quack type stuff. If the sacrifice doesn't work, then try a high protien diet. Tons of dairy, meats, and if you can get after birth then you're golden.   I read the Dutch have grown on average over the past 100 years on average 2.5 inches. I forget where I had read that so don't ask but they attributed a rich diet of protiens and dairy."

You are attracted to who you're attracted to, and don't have to feel bad about that. No one gets mad at people for only dating a particular body type, why should height or skin color be an issue? I mean, all the dating sites offer height search-filters BECAUSE they matter to their users.  Stating a preference doesn't mean you're opposed to everything else.

Its not ok to TREAT someone differently based on their race but it is permissible (still not ideal) to use race as a basis for JUDGING that person.

If you go there and search for ""tall"" or ""tall singles"" in a major city, they usually exclude women under 5'10. Sadly I think ultra-tall women would resent the inclusion of women that were over 5'10 in heels. There would probably be a fight, or two."

tall,35mv3q,scribbling_des,26,Mon May 11 23:56:05 2015 UTC,"A 5'7 woman is taller than 80-85% of the female population.  It's not freakishly tall, but it is tall.      I really dont understand all the hate for women in the under 5'10 category."

tall,35mv3q,legitpluto,2,Tue May 12 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"i agree with you. Height is a standard but being tall or short is subjective. I live in Los Angeles, where majority of the women are hispanic and around 5'2. It makes me feel really tall. However, when i'm in Holland, where most of the ladies are my height or taller, i feel quite average. While we might not consider 5'7 tall since we can see the tops of their heads, in other parts of the world such as asia, that's a couple inches taller than their average."
tall,35mv3q,rolgordijn,4,Tue May 12 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure why this comment is being downvoted. Average height is different in every country, that's a fact. I also live in LA, and most of the time I feel tall (especially since I wear heels almost always). When I went to Amsterdam I felt short. I'm from Israel- back home I felt like a giant. It's relative to what population you are a part of.  Edit: It is an actual fact that there are different average heights around the world. Why are facts being downvoted is beyond me."

tall,35mv3q,JohnGM,-1,Tue May 12 01:00:26 2015 UTC,You mean disagree with.  Because I don't see how an opinion on what constitutes tall adds nothing to this discussion.
tall,35mv3q,Khatib,1 point,Tue May 12 01:03:53 2015 UTC,"considering we're both still talking about height, i don't see how it isn't useful to the discussion? the post is about what is considered tall for a height limit, and since we are talking about height which is a standard of measurement but can also be pretty subjective depending on where you are in the world, i don't see why that deserves a downvote."
tall,35mv3q,legitpluto,4,Tue May 12 01:03:32 2015 UTC,"Why are some of you so quick to bring /r/short into this and start tossing blame that direction?  Just curious...  Seems to happen a lot lately and from what I've seen it's very rarely deserved.        We don't have the numbers to ""brigade"" /r/tall in a meaningful way.   This thread appears nowhere on /r/short.   I'm not sure why it even would or why you would think it would?       Yet...yes...it must be those damn evil horrible short people right? :P  It couldn't be for whatever reason the opinions being downvoted here aren't popular amongst the /r/tall members.... NOPE it must be those damn short people again!     Oh and before someone goes and points out I'm one of those horrible evil god awful worst people in the world short guys... I subscribe to both subreddits and have for a couple years.   I used to post over here more but the /r/short hatred and circlejerks has gotten a little overwhelming so I just mostly lurk now and do that rarely even.

tall,35mv3q,VaguerCrusader,-3,Tue May 12 11:00:10 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it's a brigade of angry /r/short voters. They get their jimmies rustled over things every now and again. About the only thing that ever triggers mass downvotes in /r/tall are exceptionally creepy comments. I've been in here since there were less than 200 subs and this only happens when it's coming from being shared in another sub.
tall,35mv3q,AaronPaulKilledSex,-3,Tue May 12 05:43:55 2015 UTC,was this shared in another sub (ie /r/short) ?

tall,35mv3q,_J_J_,3,Tue May 12 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a way to meet potential partners closer to your height. The people that are interested to go to a 'tall' event are probably all significantly above average height.   I mean I'm pretty tall, but still not tall enough to get the same problems as some of the actual very tall people in this sub. I can still buy my 36L jeans in the store, my shoe size is always in stock, I manage to fit in most spaces. But yes, I am forced to pay 50% extra to get a longer bed.  At 5'7-5'9 you might experience some of the 'being-taller' problems but definitely not as often as girls above 6 feet. If I went to a 'tall' meetup I would definitely expect all girls to be at least 5'10"". I'm not going to filter out any potential girlfriend material based on height though."
tall,35mv3q,HeTookTheOffer,29,Mon May 11 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"At 5'7-5'9 you might experience some of the 'being-taller' problems but definitely not as often as girls above 6 feet. If I went to a 'tall' meetup I would definitely expect all girls to be at least 5'10"".     Expectation is one thing, and reality is another. I don't think any tall women (Or men) should be excluded, based on them not sharing similar ""tall problems"". Who the fuck cares if two people both can't find sneakers in an enormous size? I don't know about you, but I don't need my woman to relate to my size. I moreso need her to relate to my state of mind, and lifestyle.    And also, as a tall man I'm tired of people sifting through women, and picking out the tallest ones for me to mate with.  Don't know about you, but that shit gets old, fast."
tall,35mv3q,_J_J_,3,Mon May 11 22:20:43 2015 UTC,"I get your point but I feel tall events should have a height requirement, otherwise you could just attend a 'normal' event. I won't be attending any of these events though."
tall,35mv3q,Tall-dude,25,Mon May 11 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"I feel tall events should have a height requirement     They should.  Never said they shouldn't.   otherwise you could just attend a 'normal' event.      This is where I disagree and point out just how out of whack our view of other tall folks is. Most tall women are under 5'10, and most tall men are under 6'4. Men like you and I are anomalies, and shouldn't be used to define what ""normal"" or relatively ""normal"" is.   A party where the females were 5'8+, and males 6'1+ would house men that were in the top 10%, and women that were in the top 6%:       Close to 6 percent of the female population is 5'8 or over.  Close to 4.5 percent of the female population is 5'9 or over.  Close to 0.7 percent of the female population is 5'10 or over.   Less than .5 percent of the female population is 6'0 or over.    Compare that to:   Over 10 percent of the male population is 6'1 or over.  Close to 5 percent of the male population is 6'2 or over. Close to 3 percent of the male population is 6'3 or over. More than 1.5 percent of the male population is 6'4 or over.    Not trying to be overzealous, just pointing out that ""tall"" for a tall person isn't always tall in reality. Everyone but extremely tall people start to look tiny to us."
tall,35mv3q,sunshinerf,2,Mon May 11 23:49:36 2015 UTC,Looking at those percentages it seems like 5'8 and 6'2 would indeed be a good combination.

So isn't it okay for someone who does want a woman who can relate to his size to have a certain restriction? It's okay for other people to want something different from you. I think that's the whole point of a tall dating event.  I have a preference to taller men, I think it's kind of a double standard to expect men not to have their own height preference in a partner."
tall,35mv3q,_J_J_,21,Tue May 12 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'9 and while I'm not over 6' I have more problems than most girls at 5'9. I'm a size 11 shoe and have long legs making dress and pants and shorts a huge shopping nightmare. Yeah I'm not a giantess but I have the same problems as those over 6'. I also love wearing heels and date a guy that's 6'4 so there's pluses and minuses, but just because someone isn't at that specific height requirement doesn't mean they don't share the same problems because of body proportions."

tall,35mv3q,mariapauls,3,Tue May 12 01:34:50 2015 UTC,"I've been a bit blunt there. You can certainly have the same problem as 6'+ women but at 5'9"" you should still be able to find clothes after shopping. I meant that the actual 'giants' and 'giantesses' simply can't buy clothes without ordering their size anymore. This is all based on Dutch stores though, they stock tall sizes."
tall,35mv3q,exitingcarisfail,2,Tue May 12 07:03:39 2015 UTC,Well that's lucky if you're Dutch then. In the U.S. they do not. I hate shopping because there's almost nothing in my size or its too short making it look unprofessional or just not appropriate.
tall,35mv3q,Winged_Hussar91,3,Tue May 12 10:04:25 2015 UTC,"i'm sorry but i just don't believe that. I lived in the US myself, I have very long legs. Yes a lot of dresses are suuuuper short, pants are a bit of an issue but i refuse to believe that there is ""nothing"" in your size. I have plenty of clothes that i bought in normal stores and they fit me."
tall,35mv3q,exitingcarisfail,6,Tue May 12 10:43:34 2015 UTC,"Tall and athletic/not a stick dont make for lots of things that fit well. I'm not petite. I'm tall and have some meat and muscle on my bones. I've been shopping for a dress to wear to graduation for about two months now. Everything that's summery is too short to cover everything and be professional for graduation. And all of the maxi type dresses are too short even when I wear flats. Yes I still find clothes to wear every day, but I work in the medical field so I buy unisex long scrubs or buy the male version so the pants are long enough. I eventually find things or make it work. But its usually many trips to the stores or ordering in the larger or longer sizes and hoping they fit."
tall,35mv3q,rolgordijn,2,Tue May 12 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"I realize I may be an outlier but in regards to finding clothes that fit, I think we can all agree sizing isn't what it should be. As a 5'4""/5'5"" guy who's a powerlifter but with a small waist, finding jeans that fit is like finding the Golden Fleece. So I believe you when you say you have trouble finding clothes. Also props for being fit! :D"

tall,35mv3q,Hovsky,-5,Tue May 12 12:55:33 2015 UTC,"The fact that this bothers you enough to make a post about it is bothersome.  I think it all depends on how exclusive you want the event.

Isn't the whole point of this sort of event to put people who can relate to each other based on their tall people problems (or victories) in one place? One thing I've learned from this sub, is that I don't deal with half the issues taller women have to deal with. Sure, I prefer my men taller, but I have a feeling that men who go to an event like this wouldn't really find me to be what they were looking for.  Don't let it bug you, whoever is behind these events just has a certain preference and it's okay for them to have it. Same as Black People Meet or Christian Mingle or J-Date. At least that's how I see it."

What are some examples?). Like /u/Neee-wom mentions, there is a large difference between someone my height and a woman even 2 or 3 inches taller. For instance, no one stops and stares at me in public because I'm tall like they may with a 6'+ lady.

About an hour prior to this, I saw an older Chinese man start a fight against another Chinese man and get arrested, so I was sorta guarded already.  But, I was sitting there alone, reading a book, when I glanced over my book and saw three pairs of shoes in a semi-circle standing in front of me.  I look up, act surprised and start smiling while speaking very slow English.  Then I stand up and realize that I have at least 6 inches on the biggest one.  They're mean-mugging me, then the ""leader"" finally says ""you need to leave our city and never come back"" I act agreeable and tell them that I'm just waiting on my train and will be leaving as soon as it arrives.  Then I start asking them if they like music and I pull a few guitar picks out of my pocket and start handing them over... This seemed to catch them off guard, but they didn't refuse the picks, so that made me feel like they weren't going to escalate things... And they didn't.  I don't know what they were trying to achieve because I was obviously already leaving their city.  I don't know if they were just trying to ""show-up"" the American, but there were probably 2,000 people in the room looking our way.  Very surreal."

So, I landed in Beijing and decided to check out the most touristy place possible... The Hard Rock Cafe.  Ended up talking to the Chinese Blues band that was playing that night and I told them that I was from a small town near Memphis, so they assumed (correctly) that I played music and they invited me up to play with them.  After a few songs, I got off stage and continued drinking, when a gentleman approached me about coming to his school to teach American Music to some of his students.  I accepted, and that's how I ended up in Changchun.  I spent a few months there working, and then decided to move on and see more of the country.

You can do those now and they don't waste gas, pollute, add to congestion and vehicle wear, or cause dangerous accidents. I'm American (in Houston), but I still don't see the point of driving just to drive.

Its also the combination of driving and music that let's me slow down my thoughts enough to sort them out.   There's always just a lot going on.   And yes, I've tried other thinks like you've suggested.  Its about as rational as liking one soda or another. Just personal taste."

The most important facet of self-driving cars is by far the possibilities it offers to blind, partially-sighted and handicapped people. They could revolutionise the mobility options offered to them.    Thought 2: ethical level. An accident can't always be averted, and there will be cases where the car will have to choose between potentially harming someone or potentially harming someone else. How do we resolve those ethical problems? Very hard question, in my opinion; harder than the technological questions still impeding their widespread usage, actually.    Thought 3: personal level. Meh. Height-wise, a small car will remain small; so I doubt that'll make much difference. It's not the existence of the controls that make us cramped, it's just the overal lack of space. Plus, I enjoy driving, so I don't think I'd get one."

tall,35head,Dagnatic,10,Tue May 12 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"Every single year I wrote a letter to Santa asking for more height. And every single year, I got nothing. Well, I got lots of clothes, candy, and an Xbox, but no height. One day I told my parents that Santa never gives me height. ""Santa can't give you that!"", they snorted. I was heartbroken. Years of my life I had spent hoping, wishing, dreaming, fapping. Then one day, it came to me: I needed Jesus to help me.  So I stopped fapping, and started praying. It became clear that, if I was going to pray, I needed to do it right. I mixed as many religions as I could. Knowing that only one of them was the right path, I began practicing. Things got intense. I actually got pretty high up in some organizations, I even had to kidnap some people on behalf of L. Ron Hubbard.  Nothing worked, but there was something I hadn't considered. Satanism. Finally, I had figured it out: I need to sell my soul for more height. I joined my local cult and began doing their dirty work. I did this for 10 years. One night, my leaders said that my time had come and my wish will now be granted. They gave me a potion to drink. It had a real fancy name, I think it was called psilocybin. Anyway I drank it, and within an hour I began to grow. And grow, and grow, and grow. Eventually my head hit the clouds but I just kept growing, and growing. It got to the point where I was bigger than the Earth itself and no longer bound by gravity.  I travelled the cosmos for what felt like millenia. Then as quick as you can snap your fingers, I found myself in a ditch, naked, covered in marker, and with a bottle jammed into my anus. A bottle with a note inside. It read:   Shortyshuvnstuff, you have passed my final test. There is one more thing you must do: on my sacred night you must burn all your favorite Xbox games I gave you and never buy them back.  -Santa Clause.   I couldn't believe it.

I have to crush my legs to get lapbars down on ""basic"" roller coasters and usually need to invade the space of the person next to me.  I haven't been on one where leg dangling would be a safety issue, so I guess I haven't had that fear. It's been a while, but I don't think I've had any issues with the ones where the harness comes down over the top.  I know I've been pretty paranoid on some rides with not a lot of head clearance. Definitely kept my hands down.  Once as a kid I had my back get royally messed up being jerked around on a coaster that went backwards through loops so I've avoided those since then.  In general, I'm not scared of probably the vast majority of roller coasters, but I just avoid them because of size issues.  I won't go on the vast majority of county fair rides because I just don't trust those death traps."

First I'll go with the funny one. It was in Harry Potter land and it was a basic kiddy ride where the only strap is a bar and net that comes down to the legs of the tallest person like this one I found (http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.456306!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/alg-michael-douglas-orlando-jpg.jpg) It's a two person ride and I was with my friend who is 5'11 maybe. It was the height difference so he wasn't held down at all and could easily stand up to leave the ride before the operator released this bar. We laughed he swore he'd never go on a ride like that with me again and we kept going.  The second story I hate. I have been to universal once a few years ago and when I did go I remembered the Simpsons ride as being fun so we waited in that line not too long and watched security deal with line cutters. At the ride the first 30 seconds or so were fine but this ride jams you back and forth a lot for effect well at my height and long legs each and every time it thrust forward my knee caps were jamming into the sharp metal hood of the ride and every thrust back my legs went back. This turned into a very vicious cycle real quick and I stopped enjoying the ride and just had a look of pain on it the rest of the time.  Edit: Found a new picture including a really happy old man as the original picture actually had 2 separate bars while this ride was 1 bar for 2 people.

The wannabe model / photographer environment is sketchy as f*ck with a lot of pressure from perverts with a DSLR for the girls to do nudey stuff.    If you want to see if you've got what it might take, pay a pro photographer 2 or 3 hundred for a photoshoot with a makeup artist.  Look for what the agencies expect (eg http://www.businessofmodeling.com/modeling-portfolios/modeling-portfolio/) and go round some of the agencies with your portfolio.

tall,35a9sn,jruhlman09,1 point,Fri May 8 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"I cannot recommend the Aeron enough.  Even only at 205#, you still weigh enough regularly break normal chairs (moreso because you're taller and the lever effect will put a lot of stress on those flimsy plastic arms most chairs use to hold the back on).  The Aeron will not break unless you take a sledgehammer to it, so in the long run, you'll spend a lot less."
tall,35a9sn,ArmchairMisanthrope,1 point,Fri May 8 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"The Aeron (assuming you get the biggest size) is definitely a great chair. A couple of days ago I got the chance to try out an Embody, also by Herman Miller, and so far I really like it. I seriously doubt they are affordable, and the back isnt quite as tall as I'd like, but it has an ""unrollable"" seat (hard to describe) that lets you extend the depth so it comes closer to the underside of your knee. Fantastic feature. Worth checking out if you have the opportunity!"
tall,35a9sn,IAmBlakeM,1 point,Fri May 8 19:17:41 2015 UTC,I have the Aeron at home and am mostly happy with it. I'm 6'4 225 and the chair itself fits my body size very well. I feel like it could also accommodate someone much taller than me. The one issue I have with the chair is in it's lumbar support. If I lean back into the chair hard the lumbar support pops off. This actually happens to me multiple times a day and it is somewhat annoying.

What I found was that there aren't really any cheap office chairs that are comfortable. I ended up settling on the Steelcase Leap Chair. It was the best reviewed chair I could find. For me it has all the adjustments I would want. The thigh support goes out far enough and the chair lifts high enough to take the pressure off my knees, and the armrests and lumbar go high enough to make them comfortable to me. The price was steep at around $600, but I'm going to be spending so many hours in it that I see it as well worth the money. I was able to try mine out at an office furniture store, try finding one in your area and calling to see if they have models to try out."

If she wears heels, you'll be well within the comfort zone. You don't have to worry about it being awkward though because lucky for us, girls will always pull the ""hahaha omg ur so tall:)"" shit about 5 seconds into the dance, and the ice will be broken. From there on in you should be pretty comfortable with each other. Just have fun, don't do anything stupid, and remember that it's only prom so don't get nervous or stressed over it. Slow dances are awesome and girls love dancing with tall guys. Let her put her hands on your shoulder region and put your hands on her hips. Don't be shy. And for the love of god, don't get a boner.   If she's not wearing heels however, you might be fucked. What I usually do if my gf isn't wearing heels is we just get really close and she rests her head on my neck and I rest my head on top of hers. If you're comfortable enough to try that, more power to you. You'll end up being pretty up close and personal anyways since you have to reach farther down for her hips and she has to reach higher for your shoulders. Just follow your gut. And don't get a boner.  Have fun buddy:)"

It has nothing to do with your level of fatness, and everything to do with your height/proportions (i.e. leg length to torso length).   Since you're 6'0"" you can ride a 29"" without any trouble. If you can ride a 29"", then you should. Most people can't handle a 29"" easily and have start riding 26b bikes (half-way between a 26"" and 29"" frame)."

So yes, I take up more vertical space than others, but please do not call me ""big"" if you plan on impressing me with your good manners. Were I a bodybuilder, I'd probably feel quite differently about the term, but it is clear with a passing glance that I do not lift weights.

Some languages use big and tall interchangeably. I have been called an Amazon a few times, LOL.  I purchased an new hybrid (street/mountain bike) last year at a local bike shop and there are not many frames that fit me. They had a very large selection but they only had 2 bikes that were tall enough to fit me. I ended up purchasing a GIANT Sedona XL and I've been very happy with it. I was the tallest person they ever had purchase a bike from them and they never expected a woman to be that person."

The teen years were rough, but that was mostly from a bad home life, and I think that teen years, with all the attendant insecurities, can be difficult for many without being so physically conspicuous. The hardest thing was clothes, there were times I literally couldn't go out because I had nothing appropriate to wear.  Dating was never a problem once I realized the whole unattractiveness thing was all in my head, and there are two sides to being unusual and it's pretty much up to you to control the spin. For the few % of women who may be uncomfortable, there seemed to be many more who were tall chasers, and others who could be converted.  Most of the time I've never minded the comments, jokes or staring. I realize people are curious, I always volunteer my ""specs"", and honestly answer questions about basketball, furniture, clothes and stuff like that. For those that seem insecure, I make it clear that I didn't choose my height, don't deliberately try to intimidate people, and don't compare myself to others. While a large stranger can be a little scary, a large friend can be reassuring, so I try to be friendly and courteous."

tall,352luy,real-rainicorn,1 point,Wed May 6 17:57:28 2015 UTC,I mean celebrities are public figures. When you are a director or writer or publicist you have to be mindful of the current social climate when presenting and creating things like this.  Having a noticibly taller girl will undermine her femininity and having a noticibly shorter guy will undermine his masculinity. If you don't try to mitigate the difference then audiences will notice that and will be slightly distracted from the performance. You have to change the public perception before you change the performance itself.

Granted, if the track is below me and the car is a large one, I don't have a problem because I feel safe (Batman coaster is best coaster). I went on Mind Eraser and nearly cried at the end. There are near misses that give me a panic attack because my fear is that I'll break my legs on the track or beam whipping by. And before you ask, yes I was actually short enough to ride. I'm 6'4"".  It's fucked. I don't mind putting my arms up. At least I have more space to move them to avoid things.

It's really hard for us talls, but the thing that makes an outfit look great on a person, is when it fits perfectly. When all the lines are in the right place, that person just walks with confidence. To me that's what creates a flattering look.    On a personal note, guys in cardigans and skinny jeans or anything ankle grazing give me a total soft on. But there's a lot of that around still :("

Here are a few topic titles just randomly grabbed from the /r/short front page right now:  ""There's been a study stating that tall men are smarter than short men and deserve higher pay. There have also been studies that stating that white people are smarter than other races. There have also been studies stating that men are smarter than women... I wonder if they should be paid more...""  ""Heightism IS real""  ""I'm 5'2"" (note: inherently not a bad title, but inside the post he actually comes out and says how stupid tall people look)  ""Kiefer Sutherland 5'8, Jack Bauer 5'11??""  ""Famous economist John Kenneth Galbraith on heightism.""  I mean, I don't give a shit how tall you are. Most tall people don't give a shit either. In fact, the reason /r/tall is so much bigger than /r/short has little to do with the plethora of tall men compared to short men (categorically untrue), but rather with the attitude of our sub (""haha let's poke fun at ourselves"" or ""wow she looks amazing in that dress, AND she's tall? Goddamn!"") versus the attitude of that sub (6+ anti-tall posts in the first two pages).  And yes, before you judge me, I do like taller women in general, because I don't like feeling extraordinarily out of place when I'm with my girlfriend. That said, my current girlfriend is only 5'3"", so you can't even tag me on that."

The fact we talk about these things offends you? Are you fucking serious?  Edit: and to add, that one post that you say the OP makes fun of tall people... well I see people here say lanky, giraffe, talk about awkward proportions etc. all the time. Yet when a short guy says at least we don't look awkwardly proportioned, it's hate speech? Do you know how common a sentiment ""at least I'm not short"" is here?  Give me a break."

Regarding your edit: I don't say things like ""but at least I don't have stubby little arms and no neck"" because I'm not a cunt. That's dickish behavior. Calling yourself a giraffe in jest is one thing. Calling a broad group of people unkind names meant as insults is completely different.

People don't take our content seriously and misconstrue it as hateful.   calling a broad group of people unkind names meant as insults  a bunch of angry people.   Literally, your only retort is, ""you're angry little men"". Again, /r/tall insults the users of /r/short in much harsher ways on a daily basis, for fun and often without relevant context.

I've always laughed at the thought of even trying to get into skinny jeans, I wouldn't get them past my knees.  Even then, sometimes it's just not comfortable regardless. A pair of khakis I have just fit waaaay too tight. Most of the jeans I have (mostly Old Navy) are very comfortable, fit fairly nice, and are cheap.  I'm a 36"" inseam (approximately) and a 34"" waist at 6'3""/215lbs. I'm not sure if you'd need a 38"" inseam, I'm not sure if either of those two stores/websites carry those, but they might. Eddie Bauer is usually great for tall men's clothing.  What sucks is having to go with bigger waist sizes that you don't really need in order to fit your thighs in...I've done that a few times but I refuse to do it any longer, I want my clothes to actually look like they somewhat fit me.  And even then, I'm not sure how much you weigh, but you probably have a BMI higher than me if you're a serious lifter. I've tried to keep my weight from going any higher, but I think my experience is relevant because I've definitely got more lower body muscle relative to my upper body."

Place a slightly moist towel in between the two to keep the two boards from slipping. Even adding only 2 or 3 inches noticeably reduces the strain on my back.

Tall men: Feel as if they're being bullied into only dating tall women, and are tired of people nudging them towards connecting with a person solely based on height.     Short men: Feel left out, and cast aside. They are, after all, MEN. So when they read these posts, they immediately feel like shit because yet another woman is bitching about how she can't find a man that's ""compatible"" with her (Even though most men are around her height)   Short women: Feel completely irrelevant, and are often bullied by way of extreme downvoting, especially if they try and lighten the mood by talking about being confident in your own skin (Because according to some women on r/tall, short women are too privileged to complain or give advice on body issues.)       Tall women: The people that are the most annoyed and affected by these posts are other tall women. Because if they ARE confident in themselves these posts push them into a negative mindset, and if they AREN'T confident in themselves these posts confirm all of the negative things they've been told about tall women.

I say this because I appreciate both sides of the height continuum in a different and unique way, and encourage those in the middle to draw happiness from people on both ends of the spectrum. It is a novelty to be a height extreme no matter which one it is, tall or short. And people on both ends are angsting to be loved.  The impact on the life of a short person, especially a short male, who had just one tall person (preferably opposite gender), who found his cuteness adorable, it would make that short guy an extremely happy man. If you want to equate the feeling he would experience, it would be that of the tall lady finding her dream taller than her match. Why not exercise the happiness potential? Even if you don't chemistry-wise have incentive to appreciate the short and vice versa, there's happiness to be gained and why don't we all want to achieve this?"

Paleo, raw food, Atkins - whatever diet you choose, is all well and good, but if you're cutting out certain foods, the work around is never as good or as satisfying. I had a blackbean brownie the other day, made with black beans, coconut oil, walnuts and some chocolate obviously. It was tasty.

tall,34qmai,xxxargs,4,Tue May 5 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"I think a big goal should be to work on the social/community element. This subreddit had a pretty solid group of core contributors that were active in threads, on social media, and in the IRC channel. But then there was a huge influx of subscribers and the subreddit's direction and content got a little lost, and people just stopped coming around because the community part of it was gone -- no more familiar faces or usernames.   I think the camaraderie of when many of us knew eachother (or atleast recognized usernames or had some context) was the best part of /r/tall. It sustained the subreddit while also welcoming new people in.  This is a new username for me, but I was a longtime member of this subreddit and regular on IRC, and that channel has been dead for a year or more when it used to be really busy. You lost core users, and it was sad to see it go.  TL;DR I think when you lost the core community of this subreddit, you lost the direction of the subreddit itself. Bringing that back would bring me back to the subreddit, but for now I check in to r/tall pretty sparingly."

In reality, his father is Jaime Lannister, the queen's brother and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. He has a younger sister, Myrcella, and a younger brother, Tommen , both whom are also the product of Jaime and Cersei's incest.  Joffrey takes after his mother in terms of looks and personality, his blonde hair being a subtle clue that he isn't really a Baratheon, who famously always possess black hair even when one of their parents possesses blonde hair. He is usually accompanied by his sworn shield, the formidable Sandor Clegane, who is better known as the Hound. Even before he ascends to the Iron Throne, Joffrey is spoiled, arrogant, cowardly, and sadistic; however these traits are further exacerbated upon Robert's death and his ascension to the crown.

tall,34mc1d,Tsurnka,39,Sat May 2 13:20:33 2015 UTC,Holy shit he's lost a lot of weight very quickly! Hope Penn doesn't have any health problems. He actually doesn't look very well.
tall,34mc1d,bishslap,17,Sat May 2 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"He's clearly lost a tremendous amount of weight, and even before he lost it he looked a bit out of it. Here's a still from one of his appearances on Wizard Wars (I'm assuming, 6-7 months ago). I'm thinking maybe his health began to decline, and he got on some kind of medical diet. Possibly even weight-loss surgery."
tall,34mc1d,NineEightSevenFirst,21,Sat May 2 15:07:59 2015 UTC,"he went on a plant based diet a friend of his suggested. Lost around 100lbs in less than a year. His doctors were surprised, but happy with the results. All stemmed from his BP being out of control and him wanting to get off the crazy meds for it. He's currently writing a book about the experience.   Michael Goudeau did it with him and has lost around 60lbs.  From what I can gather, it was sort of a vegan Keto diet. He says he feels far healthier than he has in years. Goudeau has said that he has far less inflammation in his joints and can do tricks that he hasn't been able to do in a decade."
tall,34mc1d,iacchus,6,Sat May 2 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"Good on him, man. I'm genuinely happy for the guy. It's nice to see such a powerhouse take control over their health."
tall,34mc1d,NineEightSevenFirst,2,Sat May 2 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"From what I understand about keto, it'd be quite difficult to do on a vegan scale. Can you give me some more insight on how that worked?"
tall,34mc1d,LegsMcGlasses,3,Sat May 2 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"Not really Keto per se, but a strict reduction of carbs, sugar, processed foods, etc.  Vegan keto was sort of a shorthand meant to give an idea of the drastic diet change. For example, he eats a lot of rice from what I gather, which doesn't really fit in with keto. I've never heard him mention keto, honestly, was just trying to give an idea of the diet.  Mostly, he eats tons of salad and vegetables."
tall,34mc1d,iacchus,1 point,Sat May 2 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"Nice info, I'm wondering if the ""hollow"" look is only because of the weight loss or if its also related to some dietary deficiency with the diet."
tall,34mc1d,jimdidr,1 point,Sun May 3 21:34:54 2015 UTC,I fully expect it is just from being 60 and going from 325 lbs to 225lbs in less than a year

tall,34mc1d,blackinthmiddle,-1,Sat May 2 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing.  He doesn't have that healthy weight loss glow, he looks a bit sickly."
tall,34mc1d,scribbling_des,13,Sat May 2 15:01:25 2015 UTC,He is 60 so he doesn't have that youthful skin elasticity that someone half his age does.
tall,34mc1d,scribbling_des,4,Sat May 2 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand this.  He still doesn't look well to me."
tall,34mc1d,iacchus,11,Sat May 2 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"Dude lost 100lbs in less than a year on a structured diet. From first person reports, he feels far better than he has in a long time. Also, got his blood pressure under control, which was the impetus for the whole thing.  His BP had gotten way out of hand."

I also think that if a female feels that ""social capital"" and treats men differently based on how a few have treated them, that's a problem with the gal involved, and likewise if men treat women differently based on previous situations where they felt ""disposable"". It could all be treated with a sense of humor like OP seems to have, or it could make a person a manipulative brat.

I look at it like this: The RIGHT person won't do these things. They won't care about the heels you wear, how tall(or short) you are, and they'll accept you and love you for who you are.

I agree its a poorly written article with lots of bias but to me it more voices moderate frustration than... saltyness? (gunna have to help me out on what that means)   Also let this be a note to all those who think otherwise that height still plays a role in attraction in the homosexual community."

I went there 5 days in a row, spent about an hour each day in there, and eventually found a helmet, gloves, a jacket, and pants that fit wonderfully.  Also, depending on your build, the brands will fit differently. I've noticed Sedici fits me best (really broad shoulders) so if the Bilts aren't fitting right, just go try some other brand.  Plus, iirc, for Cycle Gear you can have them order stuff for you to try on, no commitment (I'd call and double check first). If they do, go to their online shop and have them order stuff in.  Best of luck brother."

I will give the Sedici a try as I'm fairly broad-shouldered too, I don't think they had a ton of them in that particular store so ordering may be the way to go, I appreciate the tips."

Lost half the skin on my back and most of the skin on my right arm, was wearing a lightly armored hoodie. But regarding your original question, Aerostitch is an awesome company with insane customer service. My whole family has started to wear their jackets, my dad wears his bright yellow rain jacket always, even on our Vespas. If you can make a trip up to Duluth they will tailor it for you, but even just from stock, their products are great."

Don't live in fear of it, but have fun, and be prepared if some shit does go down. Clothing companies have got our number, kangaroo leather ($$$$$) is thin and supa lightweight, but tough as nails. My dad is the most gung ho in our family about this stuff, he has a pair of thick cow leather zip up pants (think chaps, but full leather over jeans) that he wears all the time unless he thinks rain might be coming, then he uses his synthetic rain gear. When it comes to motorcycle clothing, you have basically endless options, but get good quality that will actually protect you when you need it to. Don't let my story of losing skin discourage you, riding is fucking great, and there is little else that allows you to feel as free. I got my pilots license a few years ago, and lemme tell you, flying a plane is rad, but in comparison to hitting 100 for the first time on your bike, it just feels so stifling and confined. I'm gonna go for a motorbike ride now, cheers mate. Writing this got me pretty jazzed to go bounding.

They all seem to stop around size 13, and finding extra-wide is nigh on impossible. I recommend picking up a nice pair of boots with a low heel, I like Red Wings."

I also don't completely trust the studies that are used to determine national averages because they generally only measure about 5,000 people, which is a tiny amount compared to the national population here in the US.

tall,34l3tk,MartinH,2,Sat May 2 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"Well 60-80% of human height is genetic in most cases and times where the child or children of those parents are extremely taller can be from environmental factors and nutrition. This can encompass the other part of the height that is not genetic. Some people can have the condition of Gigantism which is the extreme over-production of HGH (Human Growth Horomone) in the body causing height that doesn't even fall in the 1% of the human population, this condition does not require tall parents for it to be expressed. The stature of these people shows extremely long limbs much like Robert Wadlow that's not proportionate to the rest of the body but we can't accurately tell if Peter the Great's body was to proportion because all we can see of him are paintings."

The Alton and Illinois monikers reflect the fact that he was born and grew up in Alton, Illinois.   Wadlow reached 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m)    in height and weighed 439 lb (199 kg) at his death at age 22. His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone. He showed no indication of an end to his growth even at the time of his death.

As a teen I was involved in a youth volunteer group that travelled to various countries once a year for humanitarian work. Being from a wealthy family,  my parents would often fly up and spend a week traveling with me after I was done with the group. I met many, many people and experienced many things. Some of these people had an ancestry to ancient Mayan shamans and herbalists. My parents, being health nuts at the time, found a dietary supplement that was beneficial to your body in pretty much every way possible. One effect the man told us was what we understood as ""big height"". His accent was very heavy so we couldn't catch everything, but we were certain he wasn't going to give me anything harmful or useless. Now his brother, the expert in ancient shamanism, told us to repeat one of two phrases everytime we ate it. One phrase gave me what he described, the other was only used to slow down or halt the effects as too much too fast could put unnecessary stress on my body.  It was meant as a regulator of my growth, not a steroid. Anyway, we used as instructed and my growth actually stopped, and stayed where I am at 5'4"". As it turns out, we had the phrase right, but we had the effects wrong. What we heard as, ""big height"" through his garbled accent was actually, ""little bit of height"". So just make sure you have understood what exactly you are getting into if you try what I did."

The shows I've been to with kids, no one moves out of the way...because the kids are all over the place.

tall,34jddz,birdhustler,1 point,Mon May 4 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"do you think maybe people don't skip in front of you in a concert because that's considered extremely rude and provoking? maybe you're not aware because of your height, but for those in the average ranges, this is standard social etiquette.  I do ask taller people if they'd be so kind to let me skip them if they're a whole foot taller than me. often I get yes, and if you'd believe it, a couple times I get a no. not all tall people think this is a given.  PS: you might want to take pause next time you feel compelled make a comment comparing racial segregation to... well, anything.   edit:   other interesting facts about being a short person at a concert:   you may say ""well, extremely short people should just adapt and ALWAYS GET TO SHOWS SUPER EARLY"". a fair argument. however, surely you know this isn't always possible (example, depending on someone for a ride). not allowed to sit on someone's shoulders or a chair or use anything to prop myself up. usually a security guard will stop you. there have also been tall people who notice me behind them and ask if I'd like to skip them. for that moment, they have become a towering god of graciousness, and for them they just had to move back like half a foot."

Personally, I don't have an issue if people want to get closer (basically, general admission is every man for himself). I have offered people to stand in front of me, because it's an altruistic arrangement that helps them and doesn't hurt me.  My post was a sarcastic response to the author's stupid demand. I really, REALLY don't expect anyone to take my comparison literally."
tall,34jddz,ozigiri,1 point,Mon May 4 02:16:09 2015 UTC,"If 'standard social etiquette' was observed at even just a slim majority of non-seated shows, we wouldn't be having this conversation. As someone in the average range, people try and shove ahead of me at shows all of the time-regardless of height. THAT seems to be the norm at most shows. And no-not all tall people think this is a given-for the many reasons stated in this threat-BUT it DOES seem to be assumed by the rest of society that tall people SHOULD move and that's what I don't understand. Why is that a given? As he pointed out-what is he supposed to do? Step aside so that every person at the venue who is shorter than him can get in front of him? Should I step aside for every person who is shorter than me? Are we really all supposed to line up by height at these things? What if you're with a mixed group of people? My husband is tall and I'm average-where do we stand? When I can't get to a show early enough and get a good spot, I don't resent the rest of the people at the show or expect them make accommodations for me. I accept my fate and try and make the best of the situation. You're not allowed to sit on a chair or stand on anything but are there not elevated areas at the shows you go to? Almost all of the mid-level music venue's I've been to have balconies. Is that not the case where you live? I just don't understand why people assume their tickets guarantee them a view."

tall,34jddz,CornyHoosier,2,Tue May 5 00:10:10 2015 UTC,"To most of your questions: No.  No one is obligated to move or give up their spot (short, medium, tall). You have misunderstood me giving my short person's perspective as ""points"" for a case stating otherwise. I have no points to make because I am not trying make a case for anything. I don't understand how you have arrived at this.  Again, I used ""given"" purely in response to the previous poster. His/her argument could have easily meant that they assumed everyone would shift around accordingly until they got a better view, which may mean inevitably someone skipping him/her. Not everyone assumes this. Not everyone thinks this is a given. See what I did there? Because it would be pretty absurd if I was implying that anyone was obligated to move just because of their height, wouldn't it?   Edit: Actually, that is the only point I made in my initial post. That and to be prudent when making comparisons of anything to racial segregation.  In conclusion, Tall people should ABSOLUTELY BE MANDATED TO move to the back =/= it sure is awesome when a taller person in front of me is kind enough to let me get in front of them. (Whether it's in GA pit or the balcony.)  PS: But fuck it sometimes it doesn't work out and even if I get a sweet spot I sometimes still get skipped/trampled by a rambunctious group that has outnumbered/overpowered me and my cohorts and I think EVERYONE of all heights can agree this sucks."

New Balance is one of the few brands that seems to fit fairly reliably. I have to get the velcro version though because the stringed version is narrower.

It sucks being able to see in hindsight and a lot of the time when I'm in ""party"" situations I tend to ignore my introverslion and step out of my comfort zone.

tall,34gqx5,killego,1 point,Sun May 3 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, just by doing what I said above really, putting in 100% of the effort when meeting people. After the first 2-3 minutes it all goes away.  For example at that wedding I mentioned, I only knew 2 other people and they were seated elsewhere. The guy to my left started talking to the guy to his left, I could hear them both trying to bring up something to talk about. The one next to me mentioned he had a trip planned for San Diego, which I visited last summer along with LA and Vegas (we're from the UK). I came into the conversation and got only one word answers from him. After an answer he would look back at the other guy even though they didn't have any active conversation going on. Previously after the second or third time, I would have taken this as him giving me the cold shoulder and abandoned trying to talk. I probed more asking if he travelled a lot and after a few minutes he seemed to get comfortable opens up and mentions his full trip. Turns out he's doing almost the same route as I did. San Diego to LA to Vegas. After that we ended up talking for about an hour straight during the dinner. We both been to China and other places, he worked in import/export which is a large part of my business so we talked a lot on that and a whole load of other stuff.  Even when others got involved in our conversation, they would talk sentences towards him even if I was the one that raised the point they were interested with. If I replied to them I'd get a short response, just kept at it for the first minute or two then they spoke to me like they were to him. Once I break through that initial 'defence' they seem to have with only me, it's easy going.  So me and that first guy had a ton in common but he would have never tried talking to me initially like he was with the guy to his left. I would have taken his cold answers to mean he didn't want to know me. He would have kept having dead end conversations with the guy next to him all night. I would have sat there regretting even coming out and so on. Just by putting in most the effort for the first couple of minutes, my social life has improved a lot. I've gotten more new non-business related phone numbers these last couple months than I have in 3 years.

tall,34csx9,GrandBuba,6,Thu Apr 30 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"poorly written with little backing. Height is 80% determined by genetics not from ""better nutrition"" especially in the western world. It also takes for granted that taller people are naturally more intelligent and have better ""social skills"" without any backing as to where these claims come from. Even if there was a slight correlation between height and intelligence and social skills that doesn't necessitate a causal relationship.  Ex. I could take the IQs of everyone in the world, find that white people are generally smarter than people with darker skin and publish my results but that wouldn't take into account that on average people who are white usually live in better developed countries with better educational opportunities."
tall,34csx9,VaguerCrusader,7,Thu Apr 30 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair the article does back the social skills part with research. Problem is it's using one aspect of one study done in one country on children in school 57 years ago to make global conclusions about present day career patterns in adults. Generally you can determine a lot from analysis of children and their life outcomes. ""Oh yep, short people are dumb and deserve the wage gap"" is not one of them."
tall,34csx9,ShortyShuvnstuff,6,Thu Apr 30 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"It's bullshit.

When there is an article about it, we aren't making it up. And why do you need to bring, ""you're short and obviously blame all your problems on tall people and women"" into this?  I can't deny there is slight evidence for the IQ gap. The problems in these studies are that they don't control for people with stunted growth and cognitive ability due to malnutrition being included, and are often done with children, not adults. IQ differences can be found between races, genders, and other demographics as well. Shall we start ordering salary by stereotyped intelligence level? Height is by far not the determining factor for intelligence, nor is ""IQ"" the only relevant measurement. Being taller does not automatically make you a smarter and better member of society, you have to consider everything.  Tell me, if there was an article stating that women deserve the wage gap, would you be supporting that as well?"

Being taller does not automatically make you a smarter and better member of society, you have to consider everything.   Of course it doesn't. That's not how statistics work.

When there is a disagreement with the results of a study, many people come to dispute the evidence.  They add a ""but"" to it.  There is no movement advocating for the fair treatment of short people, so there are no researchers itching to jump at the chance to provide the ""but"" there.  People simply don't care. Also, race and gender are hot topics that people are careful to traverse in the first place. Height is not, it is fine to make poorly founded claims of short people being incompetent because it fits in with society's narrative.  Do you really think that, with all the different people genetics can create, the only thing that has an effect on intelligence is height?  Merely suggesting there might be differences between races or genders is racist or sexist.  But a suggestion short people are inferior?  Oh, that's a fact for sure.  And what exactly does misogyny have to do with my comment history?  Is it misogynist to suggest heightism be taken as seriously as sexism?"

tall,34csx9,GrandBuba,5,Thu Apr 30 04:14:07 2015 UTC,"Full text   Employers pay tall people more than short people — and it seems that they are absolutely right to do so.  The “height premium” in employment has long been known. An increase in male stature corresponds to a 2.3 percentage point rise in salary, while the earnings difference between the bottom and top quartiles in height is roughly equivalent to that associated with an extra year or two of schooling.  The question for economists has been whether this demonstrates unconscious bias by employers, or whether it is because tall people really are better.  Now researchers from Ohio State University have found the premium paid for height can be entirely explained by the fact that taller people are on average cleverer and have better social skills. Tall people are likely to have been better nourished as children, which would help their brain development.  “Height captures two things — that you are growing up in a good healthy environment, and because you are able to grow up in a healthy environment you are able to develop as fully as you are allowed and access your true cognitive capacity,” said Andreas Schick, who led the study.  However, the researchers said this would only explain half the difference. “There is more to the brain than cognitive ability. There is also social ability.”  The team used the British ­National Childhood Development Study, on children born in 1958, to see if they could explain the other half. The British study included teacher assessments of various social skills. “When these were considered, the whole relationship was completely ­explained,” Dr Schick said."
tall,34csx9,ShortyShuvnstuff,3,Thu Apr 30 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"Wait, what? That's their link? Short people in developed countries are not malnourished and/or mentally handicapped. Even if there is a gap in social ability, which I'm skeptical of since it's not explained, that could very easily be the same societal bias and discrimination hindering short kids.  This article is super offensive, man."

When the US started to be really colonized the average height of the colonials was a couple inches higher than those nack in England supposedly. Granted my source is the History Channels documentary on the US but it does make a certain level of sense. Most were farmers or other skilled tradesmen. Except for a few instances there was generally plenty to eat and not many had to worry about food.   In the end genetics plays a huge part in it but at the same time they aren't entirely wrong either. A better connection could definitely have been made.

I know that stores wont have my size but I go up to an employee and ask what size they carry up to. Most give a flat answer but every now and then I get someone who lectures me that they try to carry shoes for everyone and blah blah blah. When they finish their speech they ask, ""so what size do you need?"" I smile and just say, ""I need a size 17 4e"" almost every single time they lose the smile and stare at me and say that they are sorry, but they don't carry my size. I leave the store with a grin and usually hear them go to another employee asking if they heard how big my feet are. Its good fun."

Now, this gym has a main basketball court in front, and a smaller court in back, with a cloth/netting divider separating the two when there was an official game going on. The divider was raised just enough for people to easily walk/run under, so I get the idea to jump up and hit it with my head as I am running to see if I can reach it. Bad idea. It turns out that there is a metal pole running through the bottom of it to help weigh it down. After a very quick introduction to the floor, they take me to the nurse's office and ask if I know where I am. I reply with the name of the junior high I went to, as I had not gone to the high school that long, as well as just smacking my head.

tall,34besl,Shagoosty,2,Thu Apr 30 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for asking for the source. As it turns out, the rich do not seem to be preferred and I was wrong in that aspect(when it was in the news at the time, it was all about alleged bribes, that's where I got it from). There still is some sort of corruption, however.   http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organspendeskandal_in_Deutschland  Unfortunately there's no english translation of this wikipedia article, but to give you the gist of it:   In Göttingen ergab sich aufgrund der Art der Verstöße, der Umstände im Einzelfall sowie der Häufigkeit des Auftretens der Verdacht auf systematische oder bewusste Falschangaben zur Bevorzugung bestimmter Patienten.   It's suspected, due to the kind and amount of violations in medical reports, that there was systemic abuse/deliberately false statements in favour of certain patients in Göttingen.   Auch in Leipzig, München rechts der Isar und Münster ergaben sich eindeutige Anhaltspunkte für systematische Falschangaben, wenn auch teilweise in zahlenmäßig geringerem Umfang.   Similar indications were found in Leipzig, München and Münster, although to a lesser degree(it happened less often, mostly).   Der ehemalige Leiter der Transplantationschirurgie in der Klinik für Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie* wurde im Januar 2013 in Untersuchungshaft genommen und wird im August wegen versuchtem Totschlag in elf Fällen und Körperverletzung mit Todesfolge in drei Fällen angeklagt. Den Verdacht der Bestechlichkeit und des Organhandels konnte die Staatsanwaltschaft Braunschweig unter der Leitung von Oberstaatsanwältin Wolff und StA Bornhöfer hingegen nicht bestätigen. Gegen vier weitere Göttinger Ärzte wird noch ermittelt.   The former superintendent of graft chirurgy in clinic X* was taken into investigative custody in January 2013 and is accused of homicide in 11 cases as well as causing grievous bodily harm resulting in death in 3 cases. The suspicion of bribery and of organ trafficking couldn't be confirmed. There are 4 more investigations regarding doctors in that clinic.  My english is a bit bumpy here and there, so the translations aren't exactly perfect(I left out the name of the clinic and the part about who's leading the investigations because I don't know any of these terms and I'd just botcher it completely anyway). I hope it's still understandable enough. They manipulated the reports by depicting the health of the patients as much worse than it actually was, meaning they got bumped up in the waiting list and took someone's else organs. In the case of Göttingen,   Without you I probably wouldn't have looked it up again, so thank you!"

It's just human nature."
tall,34besl,proweruser,6,Thu Apr 30 01:57:50 2015 UTC,"I think it could also have something to do with the psychological aspect of it. The thought of having pieces of your body cut out and placed into someone else. When I was younger (12 or 13) I had to get an ID so I could fly someplace, and they asked me if I wanted to be a donor. I said yes because I figured that was what was expected, but I remember looking at the little red heart anxiously thinking about it afterword. It really weirded me out, and the thought of how even though I would be dead, those are still my eyes or whatever and I didn't want them to be cut out made sense at the time. I debated going back and having it changed for a long time. Now, I'm glad I didn't and I don't have the same trepidation, if I go early, I'll hopefully be able to help someone else have a chance at a better life. But I can definitely see how people would get caught up in that thought process and not be able to commit to it.  It's just unfortunate."

Is your ""I refuse to donate something that I should be getting paid for"" opinion specific to organ donation, or is it a general statement (i.e. you won't donate old clothes to goodwill, you don't recycle, etc.). On the topic of organ donation, why do you think your organs are ""something [you] should be getting paid for""? It seems as though once you're dead, the money doesn't matter, and the organs have no value to you anymore.   Not trying to attack, I'm just genuinely curious."

That doesn't apply to my opinion about organ donation, though, because I know that the hospital that would get my organs would use them properly in the interests of making money.  Also, I encourage the ""the people who need it the most are the ones who are willing to pay the most"" philosophy.  I'm a die-hard capitalist, you see.  Currently, such money would go to my parrents and siblings, but when I get around to writting a will, it would go to a few research projects that I like.

Your question is confusing. What other options are there? The concept of the first world was literally created through colonialism and theft. And its supported by the fact that the power gained simply has the power to maintain itself, regardless of whether its fair. Even within a single country, those with more money and power have enough control of the flow of money that people closer to the bottom will be exploited. Comparing countries as a whole is a larger scale version of this. People are only confused by it, since day to day they struggle to remember that ownership is not actually a real thing. Its an arrangement enforced by people with power that establishes that certain people get to use a certain amount of resource. The idea that purely by accident it would ""just happen"" that the arrangement walked into would happen to correlate strongly with an actually fair arrangement on worldwide scale is so unlikely that its not even worth considering even if we didn't already actively have ways to map that the generalities of it are clearly far from the case.  This isn't like ""marxist propaganda"" either. Its simply the case. And takes a very naive understanding of money, fairness, and ownership for people to not realize it. And yet, the fact that inconvenient realities are arrived at through accepting it, its easy for many to ignore."

tall,34besl,sirchewi3,6,Thu Apr 30 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"No. If I, of sober body and mind, choose to donate that's different. If I'm in a coma and can't make that decision, no. What if I have the possibility of waking up and being fine. What if I'm like that nascar driver and my family has a chance at some time with me, and possible recovery.  I've seen the effects or organ donation, how people think it'll be healing to find out where the heart goes etc.... I don't want my family to go thru that. The possibility of being rejected by a recipient. The begging and pleading.   Call me an asshole. How I die will probably make my body useless. I would donate if I chose to die of my own intentional hand, not happening unless terminally ill. If that's the case, I will donate. However the requirement is that recipients stay anonymous to save my family the extra pain.   It's my fucking body. It's none of your business. Some people's religions don't allow it. No one wants my liver or brain. I have awesome eyes, but being a donor doesn't allow me to specify. Check it if you wish, that's up to you, just like choosing not to is up to me. If I need an organ, I have made the choice to not take one from someone more deserving."

If you double the sides, you get a volume of 8cm3 and a Surface area of 24cm2. So now, the cube only has to produce 3 units of heat/cm3.

My problem came from when I was in the Marines and we had to run our PFT (physical fitness test). It consisted of pull-ups, crunches, and a 3-mile run. The crunches and the run weren't a big deal but when it came to pull-ups having long arms is an absolute nightmare.   I'd constantly see people around 5'5""-5'8"" easily getting 20 pull-ups (max amount of points) due to their short arms and stocky builds,  but I always struggled since I have pretty long arms. The most I ever did was 18 and that took months of pull-ups every day. My average was around 16."

I never twisted my ankles or anything really just broke gingers and stuff to do with my hands and wrist. Once I stopped playing I gave noticed I have sprained my ankle at least twice that I can recall, on very random stuff. But it's kind of the opposite because my family is telling me to get back into sports because I to am you height and the added muscle really helped and I guess I am really coordinated with my lower section.

Do you have any recommendations at something a little more ""premium"" without approaching that $3000 mark??"
tall,34b2bs,nionvox,2,Wed Apr 29 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"Sure!   The Volagi Viage XL is a great bike, and the 63cm frame is absolutely huge. Its a really cool bike because you can use it as a pure road bike if you want, but it has the clearance for much bigger tires, so you can also use it on dirt. The frame design is really smart, which makes it very comfortable. Starts at $1500. I think this is a much better option that some of the common recomendations you might get like the Surly Straggler or the Soma Double Cross Disc.   The Niner RLT is another good option. Starts at $2000, but that is for a very nice build.   Both of those bikes would make great road bikes that can also be used on dirt. I'm biased towards that since I vastly prefer riding on quiet dirt roads than fast but busy paved roads. If you want a pure road bike I'd suggest something like the Soma Smoothie ES 64cm or the Specialized Roubaix Pro Race 64cm."

tall,347oj3,xflushot,19,Wed Apr 29 14:42:22 2015 UTC,"Preferences?  Yeah I have them. Standards? Yeah, pretty much foreign.  I judge on a case-by-case basis.  I find that setting inflexible criteria beforehand cuts me off from possibilities I hadn't imagined.  I'm short by the standards in this sub, but I've still been with a girl more than 14"" shorter than me, and even though it didn't turn into anything major, I have no regrets."
tall,347oj3,MaleFascistAdvice,9,Wed Apr 29 04:33:43 2015 UTC,It's okay to say he doesn't like someone because of their physical features though. I don't like girls with short hair. That doesn't make me a bad person does it? Of course not.

tall,347oj3,jjness,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:44:46 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, people are attracted to different qualities, for different reasons. I could never be with someone that I wasn't physically attracted to, does this make me a prick? Of course not.  Most women would rather date a taller man, does that make them bad people? Obviously not, they just view that quality as being more attractive than not being tall, nothing wrong with having standards. I'm short compared to most guys around me; therefore, most women will be more attracted to them in that area, and if that quality is important to them enough that they won't date me for it then so be it."
tall,347oj3,MaleFascistAdvice,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:01:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there's anything wrong with preferences, and I don't think there's anything wrong with stating them as criteria on a dating website, as it helps you filter out endless numbers of profiles or messages and narrow your choices down to those more likely to be good matches.    But if you put up a bunch of hard and fast rules in your mind about what you're attracted to when it comes to people you meet randomly in real life, you wall yourself off from possibilities you wouldn't have considered.  What if someone you meet is an ideal match, except for the fact that she's a little too short, or has the wrong length hair?  It may not be a factor in her favour, but is it really enough to rule things out?"
tall,347oj3,Magzify,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:43:03 2015 UTC,"Wait, so it's fine online, but not IRL? That dissonance doesn't bother you at all to write so plainly?"
tall,347oj3,MaleFascistAdvice,3,Wed Apr 29 13:13:43 2015 UTC,"Because if you don't narrow things down on a dating website you'll end up with far too many profiles to sift through. Unless that is, your specs rule you out for almost all the women on the site that you're left with a manageable number of profiles."
tall,347oj3,Redtube_Guy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"Again, it depends how important they think that quality is. Some people view height as a prerequisite before even considering dating, some are more flexible about it. I don't think there's anything wrong with standards, and this is coming from the guy that would most likely be last round pick when compared to all the other dudes in this sub."
tall,347oj3,MaleFascistAdvice,3,Wed Apr 29 16:16:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I think people are certainly entitiled to set inflexible standards, but I do think it's unwise to do so."

tall,3490es,GeneUnit90,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing you can do to prevent wear and tear is get good shoes (go to a running store and they'll help you), replace them at 3-500 mile intervals and make sure you have good form.  You should be running with a mid-foot strike or landing on the balls of your feet, not heel striking.  Heel striking is bad for your knees and slows you down a lot.  Look up running form videos for better/visual examples."
tall,3490es,onceadeafmute,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:51:16 2015 UTC,Technique will help. I struggled with a knee issue at first because I was heel striking but then I moved to more mid to fire foot strike and the knee is not an issue any more.  There's risks in any sport. Perhaps look for a local club where you can get some proper coaching. They'll also have access to physios if you do have any troubles.

tall,3490es,dahandrew,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:07:09 2015 UTC,Definitely have a brace for anything particularly weak or prone to injury. I could have probably prevented a lot of ankle injuries from rugby if I always wore a brace.
tall,3490es,Burnthisbook,2,Wed Apr 29 10:29:54 2015 UTC,Definitely do not wear a brace all the time unless recommended by a doctor. Wearing a brace will actually weaken the muscles as well as add additional strain to other muscles

Check out /r/running for some guides, and maybe even look at /r/barefootrunning for some good guides on form. Just follow their form advice for barefoot running but do it while wearing supportive shoes and you are going to greatly reduce your chance of injury. Lighter people can get away with mediocre form and rely on their shoes to prevent injury, but north of 2 bills you will need all of the shock also ruin you can get; from both your shoes and your running form."

tall,34a0ik,HelloDownThere,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:44:23 2015 UTC,"I was like that too during my growth spurt. I wasn't able to gain any weight.  At the age of 12, when the spurt started, I was 5'5 and weighted 125 lbs. At 13 I was 5'10 and still weighted exactly 125 lbs. When I turned 14 I was 6'0 and still weighted 125 lbs, but this is when the growth spurt stopped.  I am now 15, I haven't grown an inch since I turned 14, and I'm slowly starting to put some weight on me. Right now I weight 142 lbs, and I'm not done.  Tldr; you will gain some weight once you're done growing."
tall,34a0ik,MonoToc,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:20:37 2015 UTC,My experience was that when I stopped growing vertically I started growing horizontally.  I wouldn't worry about it until you stop getting taller.

tall,34a0ik,hjb345,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"Get MyFitnessPal and see exactly how much you're eating - it might be less than you think. Track it for a week, then add 500 calories to your daily intake. The only trick to gaining weight is to eat more than you burn, which will be a lot if you're still growing."
tall,34a0ik,4698468973,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"That was me almost exactly through most of my 20s. At one point, in frustration, I put myself on a 5,000 calorie daily diet for a few months. My energy skyrocketed but I put on only maybe a few pounds.   Make sure you're getting sufficient nutrition and that it's good nutrition. After a few years, junk food will become an easy and seemingly consequence-free option, but you don't want to do that. Start developing good fruit & vegetable habits now. Take up one or more physically challenging sports. I took up climbing, and at 6'3"" and 140 lbs, I got pretty good at it. I had a big wingspan and I could pull on small holds because most of my strength was in my tendons. The important thing is to do something so that your cardiovascular system stays healthy, you're sick less often, and once you finally do put on weight, it goes to all the right places. I know from personal experience that it's hard, but try not to dwell too much on your build. Everybody's shaped differently, there are advantages to your physique, and somebody out there thinks it's sexy. The more disappointed you are with your physique, the less likely you are to do things to stay healthy, ironically. All of these points lead up to this: you're not going to be 140 lbs forever. It took me until I was 35, and then seemingly overnight I hit 200 lbs (and climbing...) and suddenly I had to scramble a bit to fix my diet and exercise more and begin to develop habits that I didn't develop in my twenties. My hard climbing days are over (but my mountaineering days have just begun), so try to appreciate the time you have. You might be really good at ultimate frisbee or soccer or other running sports for instance."
tall,34a0ik,TallGent,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:28:02 2015 UTC,Do you climb indoors or outdoors or both. Also whats more fun bouldering or climbing?
tall,34a0ik,4698468973,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"Both, but past tense. I've climbed in Yosemite, Joshua Tree, Bishop (and the gorge), the north coast...  I personally enjoyed climbing a lot more than bouldering. I found it difficult to fully commit to a boulder problem the way I did when I was farther off the ground, and I liked the payoff of getting on top of bigger things. I also wasn't a very social climber, and bouldering can be pretty social. But, I met a lot of climbers that preferred bouldering. Bouldering tends to be a lot more gymnastic, with short bursts of intense effort with lots of rest periods in between, and it can involve more of a problem-solving aspect. Climbing is more about sustained effort, endurance, staying calm.  Try 'em both out and see which one you like more."

tall,34a0ik,TallGent,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:34:16 2015 UTC,At college so the local rec has a two story wall I guess. What shoes would you recommend before buying the special rock climbing shoes?
tall,34a0ik,4698468973,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"If the wall has some easy stuff on it (5.6, 5.7 at most), you can get away with some sneakers to start with. If you get more seriously into it, climbing shoes become really really important, it's amazing how much of a difference they make. La Sportiva Mythos are the canonical beginner rock shoe, they last a long time, they stretch a little to fit your foot (but don't get them too small, no matter what the crazy guy at the gear shop says, misery isn't worth it when you're starting out and you'll develop bad habits because you won't use your feet as much), and they do everything pretty OK.  If you have a pair of lightweight trail runners with a vibram outsole, those are OK too.  Most metropolitan areas now have a good rock gym somewhere within about 20 or 30 miles, and pretty much all rock gyms have shoe rentals and discounted beginner packages (chalk, chalk bag, belay device, harness, and shoes, typically). Plus it's a lot more fun going to one of those instead of the small woodies at places like your local rec center, and you'll get a lot more help on form and technique."

tall,341wie,ch4os1337,2,Mon Apr 27 20:10:02 2015 UTC,Protip: Put your hands together behind your back (and stretch shoulders). Fixes posture and no more elbow stabs.
tall,341wie,katielady125,2,Tue Apr 28 04:56:54 2015 UTC,Good idea! Though it might not work if I need to use my hands which tends to be the case when I'm T-rexing. I developed it when working in a coffee shop with a bunch of short girls constantly hanging out in my blind spots. I had to do all my stirring and pouring and stuff without killing them. And the hunching was because all the counters were so low and I couldn't read the computer screens unless I stooped. Every job after that had a similar situation. Now that I get to either work by myself in my workroom at home or sit at a desk with no one around I'm trying to get out of my weird posture habits but it's hard after doing it for ten years.
