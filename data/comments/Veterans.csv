Like Tweakers said you might want to go get a head scan and talk to a neurologist if it really is as bad as you say all the time. One thing I do to help is keep a pad near by and write things down not all things but the more important things like if your S/O asks you to do something another thing I do is set reminders on my phone.

Veterans,3e69pd,igeryu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:34:27 2015 UTC,"It's their school and they set the rules. So yes, they could send your debt to collections if they want to. There is no federal law protecting you on this. If their policy is that the tuition must be paid prior to the last day of class, then that is their policy which they have the right to make. If this is a state school, they are governed by a state body which makes the rules - in many states this is called a board of regents. I suggest that you look in the school catalog or their online website for their rules. Other students who are not using a GI Bill are receiving the same letters I bet.  Also did you apply for Pell Grants? If not, do so as that free money (if you qualify) would pay your tuition and put more money in your bank for you to live on."

Don't listen to this guy, there are no absolutes when it comes to getting a MBA. The only thing(s) you should be concerned with are the employment statistics and who recruits at the school you are interested in. Do you want to be a Media Executive? You will be much better off going to USC than going to CBS. Do you want to work for 3M? Once again, better off at Carlson than most other schools.  The most important thing when it comes to a MBA is looking at the network that will be opened up to you. There are MANY MBA programs that are a complete waste of time and money.

If you're suggesting getting an MBA from somewhere like University of New Hampshire is a waste of money then I will agree with you. Saying anything outside of a top 10 is a waste of paper is just silly. It's not black and white. Your claims are not supported by any evidence.  Anyone who is going to business school under the pretence that they are going to become CEO is extremely naive. Will going to a ""top 10"" business school allow you to better position yourself if becoming CE(X) is your end game? Maybe. Are most CEO's and CFO's in the graduates of top 10 business schools? No, absolutely not - Not even in the F100. At the end of the day, becoming CEO is about 90% luck and you do not have to go to a top 10 business school to get there.   Dismissing an MBA program as a waste of money because it won't get you to CEO is foolish. Most people that graduate business school will not become CEO or CFO.

In the end you should just pursue what interests you, and if research and academia are where you want to go then it's not like you can do that without a PhD. If you want to go into industry, then you can do just fine without a PhD, but there are plenty of Fortune 500 (and smaller) companies that employ PhDs in R&D.

Dumbass high schools have no concept of appropriate career exploration tailored to individuals. Just because some schools are willing to take your money, doesn't necessarily mean that trying out college will increase your long-term earning potential.   That said, even if you get a fuzzy wuzzy liberal arts B.A. that has no direct employability advantage, employers will still value the fact that you can prove to them that your capable of completing a long term intellectual challenge.

Each of these facilities has their own allotment of vouchers to distribute. If Brown is out, check with Lovell and Hines.  Also, while you're looking up HUD VASH support ask about local HVRP providers. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program or HVRP is a Department of Labor program to help vets find housing and employment to sustain housing. HVRP providers are generally non-profits and employment agencies that help veterans find transitional housing, permanent housing, and full-time employment to get vets established in a community. The definition of homeless the DoL uses is quite broad and includes vets living with family or friends and those who consider themselves to be at-risk of homelessness.   As an employee of an HVRP provider, I can attest to the program's efficacy. In the last two years the number of HVRP providers in the greater Chicagoland area has been cut in half as it's becoming harder to locate homeless veterans to serve. If the day comes that I'm looking for a new job because all my brothers and sisters are squared away I'll hit that job search with a smile on my face, I promise you.  Good luck, and if you have any questions about job search or employment drop me a PM. I'm always happy to help."

Veterans,3dy7sz,talktomylawya,3,Mon Jul 20 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"Actually your School could be in trouble when the next VA Audit is done as most Hybrid Classes are required to be reported as Distance Learning (schools report distance learning not online classes). And when the School is required to correct this (for all students going back 3 years) every student will receive a debt letter for overpayment of the monthly housing allowance.  So you might want to ask your School VA Certifying Official to double check this. Better to fix this now instead of later.  I am a School Certifying Official with an average of 1200 to 1400 students using VA education benefits per semester.   Edit to Add:  School report classes in 3 categories: Resident (classroom) classes, Distance Learning (online, internship, arranged, and hybrid), and Remedial.  This is copied straight from the School Certifying Handbook:  On the enrollment certification, resident training should be identified as “res”. Independent study, on-line and hybrid courses should be identified as “dist”. Do not add these hours together on the 1999.  Undergraduate Resident Training In-residence training for undergraduate students consists of regularly scheduled standard class sessions (at least once every two weeks). The total number of hours of classroom instruction (based on 50 minutes of instruction per hour) must equal, or be greater than, the number of credit hours awarded for the course multiplied by the number of weeks in the term. EXAMPLE: A student is enrolled in a 3-credit course over a 16-week semester. The course must be scheduled for a total of 48 hours of class sessions and meet at least every other week. EXAMPLE: A student is enrolled in a 3-credit course over a 5-week term. The course must be scheduled for a total of 15 hours of class sessions and meet at least every other week.  Independent Study (Includes Internet & Distance Learning) Independent study consists of interaction between the student and the instructor (who is physically separated from the student) through the use of communications technology instead of regularly scheduled, conventional classroom or laboratory sessions. Communications technology includes mail, telephone, audio or videoconferencing, computer technology (on-line internet courses or e-mail), or other electronic means such as one-way and two-way transmissions through open broadcast, cable, microwave, broadband lines, fiber optics, satellite, or wireless communications devices. Any courses that consist of some interaction using communications technology and some weeks of standard class sessions, but that do not meet the requirements to be classified as in-residence training, are considered distance learning. Any course (including a hybrid or blended) VA regulations defining residence training can be found at 38 CFR 21.4267(d). If a course does not meet the definition of residence training it must be considered distance training."

It is dangerous to provide unlicensed, unsupervised psychotherapy.  The VA's PTSD 101 site is a great resource and might help you on your thesis. http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/publications/index.asp http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/index.asp  There aren't many private PTSD programs around.  Some VA psychologists, like Kate Chard (co-creator of CPT) also hold university positions and have started to bring VA PTSD science to those university teaching hospitals.  Here in Cincinnati, Kate Chard, a rich baseball player and the university hospital have partnered to make a civilian PTSD program.  The non-VA providers are often invited to VA training events.    Non-VA providers are actually very poor at diagnosing PTSD and many agencies or therapists in private practice cannot afford to be trained in CPT or PE (2 of the ""best"" evidence-based treatments at this time), as it requires 6 months of consultation afterwards which is too prohibitive.  The VA gets a lot of negative press, but their PTSD research and treatment is LIGHTYEARS beyond what is available in the community."

So somehow I have to make a 30 day supply last 37 days or more.  This happened before with the same medication. Apparently now it doesn't matter how soon the request is put in, the pharmacy's policy is to wait until the existing prescription expires before processing the refill - that is if you have a 30 day supply that runs out on the 15th, they wait until the 15th to fill it.  They fail to account for the 5-10 additional days it takes for it to make it to and through the mail system.

Veterans,3doh0z,rakkasan3-187,5,Fri Jul 17 23:06:00 2015 UTC,"Summoned by /u/xixoxixa below, I appear. :)  Congratulations, man. Getting into a law school is an impressive accomplishment.   And since the GI Bill is covering your tuition, you're going to be in a WAY better position than many of your classmates are - you're very, very lucky in that regard because it means you can come out of law school prepared to do what you want to do.  My general advice to people going to law school is to do everything you can to maintain a life outside of law school. Law school can be all-encompassing - when I was in school I knew people who would spend 30 hours on a take home exam that I'd spend five on - and it can be very easy to find yourself in a trap where you feel like you have to do everytihng you can to squeeze out the last little drop of improvement, because everyone else is doing so and you're competing against them (everything's graded on a curve) - but really, honestly, the law of diminishing returns applies, and there comes a point where you've already gotten 90% as good as the best you can possibly do --- but that last 10% is going to take as long as the other 90% did. Figure out what that point is, and when you hit it, STOP, and go do something relaxing and fun.   That said, in your first year, make sure you understand everything. Law isn't additive in the way math is, but the first year classes are designed to teach you a way of thinking and a way of interacting with text, and the basic principles will show up again and again. Make sure you have those down cold - the bar exam is going to test torts and property heavily, and many other classes will draw on the principles, and the general way of thinking about texts is going to be essential.  Do you know what you want to do after law school? The legal market is still pretty badly impacted from the 2008 downturn, and if you know what you want to do now you can get yourself a leg up by taking classes that target it (trial prep classes if you want to do trial work, transactional practice classes if you want to do that) or if you can line up externships doing the kind of law you want to practice. Savannah's by no means a top tier school, so you're going to have to compete for jobs or clients once you get out - which means to the extent you can, you want to get work experience AND develop contacts before you graduate rather than after.  I'm happy to chat if you ever want advice from a recentish law school graduate, but really, my biggest advice is this: law school culture can suck you in and be all-encompasisng and make you feel like the law school is the only thing in the world which matters. resist that, maintain a connection to the outside world, and you'll be happier - and you'll do better in school, too. :)"

Veterans,3doh0z,xixoxixa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:23:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. Its great to hear from someone who has 'been there, done that.' Im excited to start. I am not sure what I want to do, but I think my passion is in criminal law. I want to stay local in the area, and since SLS is the only school here they have great externships throughout town. I definitely plan on taking advantage of every single opportunity I can take.  I am aware of the great position I am in. I am going on a full ride on the govt dime. With MHA stipend and VA payments I have more then enough to live throughout school without incurring any debt. I believe this will give me an advantage over my peers.   6 months ago, and I didn't know that this was the path I was suppose to take. I was hired by dif agencies but this is what was calling me. I'll try to stay away from getting sucked in to hard into law school, but I do want to get the ball rolling and start kicking ass.  Thanks again."
Veterans,3doh0z,learhpa,2,Sat Jul 18 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this   Of course, man. Although you should also thank my brother, because as a non-veteran I would only come to this subreddit if summoned - this is y'all's space, and I want to be respectful of that. :)   I want to stay local in the area, and since SLS is the only school here they have great externships throughout town   Aha! OK, that explains a lot. I was doing some research on SLS and was a little bit worried for you because of their rankings, which matter a lot when getting that first job out of law school (although less over time as your career grows). It is good to hear that (a) you specifically want to stay local so you're choosing something local and that (b) they have a good local externship network.  I would urge you to take as much advantage of that network as you can. :)   I have more then enough to live throughout school without incurring any debt. I believe this will give me an advantage over my peers.   I've got a friend who came out of a law school (not my law school) with $150K in debt that he may never be able to repay; it causes him all sorts of financial troublle, including preventing him from living where he wants AND tying him to a job he hates. Some of your classmates will be in that position. :{  Some more things I didn't talk about las tnight:  [a] there's this myth of law school as being super ultra competitive, and there's something to that - you're all competing against each other because all exams are curved. AT THE SAME TIME, especially if you're staying local, these are the guys you're going to be working with for the rest of your life --- so be kind and compassionate and do what you can to help them. It's counterintuitive because you're competing against them NOW, but they'll remember it later if you treat them well, and that will end up helping you in the long run.  (b) While it's important to preserve out-of-school relationships, it's also important to build friendships with the people you're in school with - everyone's just happier that way. :)"

Everything I have read, and talked to from actual students and grads, they try to distance themselves from John Marshall as much as possible. They want to eventually be able to establish themselves as a separate school. Hopefully they will get their first ranking soon since the first class just graduated. But to me, the ranking means nothing. Im going either way, and its MY school and I will make it the best for me.   The law school debt is insane. I have a very close friend that I grew up with in NYC that took the academia route while I was in the Army. Undergrad from a great school and LS from GWU. Now she is in crazy amounts of debt and living in NYC. Great school, great mind, but the debt is literally dragging her down."

I love living here, and I plan on practicing here. I do not want to do big law or work in the city. I grew up in NYC, I know what that is like, and I do not want to go back, not even for school.  Is a tier 4 school not worth it for some people? Yes. SLS is a brand new school. They just had their first graduating class. But that is what I like about it. Its new. Its just establishing itself, and I want to be part of that. Would I say the same thing if I had to pay over $150,000 in order to graduate from SLS, no. That would make a bad investment and the people who do not have full rides are going to have a really hard time paying off their debts.  But SLS is the right school, FOR ME.   Oh, and the Univ. of Phoenix although has such a terrible reputation, can lead to some great opportunity. But once again that is for SOME PEOPLE. A regular person would not benefit from that. I know someone who could not get into a reg university because their hs grades were shity. Took 2 classes at Univ. of Phoenix. Once those were completed, transferred to a brick and mortar univ on probation. Kicked ass there and transferred to a great art school. All on the govt dime. That person is now working for the govt in one of the hardest agencies to get into. Was Univ Phoenix worth it in that case? Yea.  So again, I understand the risks.

Veterans,3dkp83,Itsm00,2,Fri Jul 17 01:28:12 2015 UTC,"Representatives of The American Legion and Disabled American Veterans have warned lawmakers to reject calls to impose an age ceiling or other new cost control on VA compensation payments to veterans whose service-connected disabilities leave them unemployable.      An age ceiling is perhaps the most tempting cost-control option discussed in a new Government Accountability Office report that examines weaknesses and inefficiencies in the way the Department of Veterans Affairs administers Individual Unemployability (IU) benefits for 318,000 recipients.      Bradley Flohr, a senior advisor on VA compensation for the Veterans Benefits Administration, told the House Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday that VA is adopting more measured GAO recommendations to improve its process of monitoring IU pay and deciding future IU recipients.      These steps include fielding improved guidance for VA claim reviewers on determining IU eligibility, and better quality assurance screens so that IU claim decisions are more consistent across VA regions.      VA also promises to launch by January long-delayed software that will allow electronic verification of income reported by IU recipients, by matching it with earnings on file at IRS and the Social Security Administration. The department also promises to study whether it should use age or vocational assessments to tighten eligibility for new IU claimants.      More than 316,000 veterans see their monthly VA disability compensation enhanced by IU eligibility. These are veterans with service-connected disabilities rated below 100 percent by the VA rating schedule. But the department verifies that the same disabilities prevent these veterans from working, at least in jobs that pay wages above federal poverty guidelines."

What I don't agree with is his statement ""We need to give them a home and give them back the dignity and respect they deserve and have earned.""  First no one can take away or give someone dignity. Second, I've yet to see anywhere in my own military documents where I'm entitled to free housing (and more) for life from the government.  VA homeless programs are intended to be transitional - assist the veteran get off the street and transition into sustainable self-sufficiency.    Homeless veterans have significant needs and they have significant resources available to them.  Yes, some gaps exist, such as transportation, but the American public is expending massive amounts of resources upon them that other homeless individuals let alone any non-homeless veteran would enjoy.   So lets continue the work of enhancing what we are doing in a sustainable way without feeding into the deep entitlement mentality that has already developed in many Veterans... or the restrictive mindset that the government must provide for all these individuals needs forever."

I read the VA site, Googled a bit, and eventually called the VA with a few questions.  All in all, it was pretty smooth.  The only gotcha is that you probably want to file for your certificate before you approach the mortgage company.  They can do it for you, but it can hold things up if the VA is slow.  My experience was pretty smooth.  I think your experience will depend more on finding a good lender.  I would focus on that, then work with them on any VA questions.

Veterans,3djjzb,Poopkitty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"Just remember that the VA isn't loaning the money direct, a normal bank does.  Sounds like you already got that figured out.  All the VA does is guarantee the bank will get their money back, so you have a much easier time qualifying for mortgages.  Also, shop around between banks when the time comes.  Use a loan broker who can help you with that.  Your credit report will not take a hit for multiple queries when shopping for a loan.  USAA is in fact spectacular, and I am using them for my homeowners insurance, but another bank holds my mortgage as they beat USAA's interest rate by 0.2%.  Doesn't sound like much, but that adds up over 30 years.  The only bummer is that the VA will be very strict about the house, they don't want you moving into a shithole.  There will be inspections, termites will be a thing, and lots of paperwork.  A good real estate agent and loan broker will handle most of it.  However, that extra work for the seller (handling the independent inspection, repairing things the VA wants fixed) can make your offer attractive to a cash only or conventional loan offer which will not have the VA poking around."
Veterans,3djefg,gtfomyinternets,3,Thu Jul 16 19:20:23 2015 UTC,I worked full-time and went to school full-time. Many Veterans don't have the option to do it any other way.
Veterans,3djefg,janedoe2893,5,Thu Jul 16 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"12 credit hours in a semester that is 16 to 19 weeks long is full time for GI Bill but so is 6 credit hours for a semester that is 6 to 9 weeks long.  I work for a University with programs set up for students in your exact situation. What most of my students are doing is take one night class in classroom setting and two online classes for a Fall or Spring 16 week semester - this pays them 80% of the monthly housing allowance and they are only using 3 months for that semester in entitlement (approx.). Other students working full time take one 16 week (online or night or lunch time) and a 1st 8 week (night or online) and a 2nd 8 week (night or online) as this is also 3/4th rate of pursuit and pays them 80% of the monthly housing allowance and only uses 3 months of entitlement (approx.) for that semester.  If you only take online classes, you get paid at the 1/2 of the national average for an E5 w/dependent BAH rate for your Housing Allowance - which is why many of my students working full time take at least one class at night or lunch time (has to meet for the entire semester to qualify for the in classroom monthly housing allowance rate).  I say stay working and try to take night, online and lunch time classes as much as possible. If you plan on working in computer type jobs, work experience is as if not more important to most employers than a college degree is.  Now if you use the Montgomery GI Bill for 36 months 1st, you will then qualify for an additional 12 months of Post 9/11 GI Bill - but if you go straight into Post 9/11 GI Bill, you give up your right to use MGIB and will only receive 36 months of education benefits - so do the math before you decide which one to use before you apply for your GI Bill.  At a great many schools the BAH rate is so low that MGIB actually pays more money that Post 9/11 GI Bill. Also MGIB does not have the restrictions about receiving lower pay if you only take online classes.  Not everyone does could with online classes, so you might want to look at other schools in your area that offer the degree you want to achieve - just make sure that they are regionally accredited.  Also check if you can take some classes locally that will be accepted to transfer to UMUC if you are using the Post 9/11 GI Bill as this will help you get the higher Monthly Housing Allowance."

So if I took at least 2 classes (6 credits) that would be considered full time? That really seems manageable to me because I did that on active duty. With the amount of credits I'm estimating would transfer I would likely only need 33-48 for a bachelor's. I think I would have enough post 9/11 benefits to finish both the bachelors and a master's.

Many veterans I interact with at the VA act with an incredibly undue sense of entitlement to benefits. My impression is not that they abuse the system necessarily, but that they act as though the VA (especially compensation & pensions) owes them the world. If his stories are of the unfortunate few who fell between the cracks, that is a testament to an outstanding personal character as far as I'm concerned. Being the director of an RSC is a big deal, and my guess is that it's been a long time since he dealt personally with claims, so his willingness to answer questions here is even more so."

He would never do anything to screw over anyone and always follows the rules to a T.   I think a lot of it comes from guilt. He volunteered for the navy because he knew he would end up getting drafted. He managed to pass all the correct exams to get him into a place where he wouldn't see combat. So he basically was just on a ship in the Mediterranean for his duration of service. He saw a lot of guys come back with nothing and being treated like dirt by the American public. He was able to get a steady job, and slowly move up the corporate ladder, eventually to become director of a NYS regional VA office.

I'm both a veteran and working for the VA... I can understand both sides, but the VA is an incredibly frustrating organization to work with. For example, after having submitted a claim over 12 weeks ago, I got a call today saying that I either had to 1) drop everything tomorrow and go to an appointment an hour away, 2) wait until October for the next appointment (an hour away), or 3) drive 2 1/2 hours away to get an appointment. They gave me less than an hour before they closed to adjust everything in my schedule, confirm I'd be able to leave work early, skip classes, etc. for an appointment less than 18 hours away.  I don't know the source of the problem, be it organizational, financial, or what, but there is a problem. Hopefully you can see why that's frustrating.

Veterans,3ddawx,Itsm00,2,Wed Jul 15 11:07:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the author on multiple points.   embraced and honored by a grateful society ready to show its appreciation, as expressed by discounted goods offered by businesses of all stripes, and the outrage generated when the government that called them to duty fails to adequately see to their post-service needs.   Call me selfish, but a 10% discount and meaningless expressions of gratitude are almost worse than nothing.  I agree it's far better than during the Vietnam War, but I'd rather see people hold their government accountable for getting us involved in a war that was immoral and unnecessary.  Additionally, the ""outrage"" is almost nonexistent in many communities.  Far too many people assume the VA has already solved its problems and the media is doing far too little to disabuse them of that notion.  That's not including those who have the opinion that, since we chose to join, we are the only ones responsible for dealing with post-service problems, especially when it may involve raising taxes to cover the costs.   With a new ID card, veterans can easily prove they served honorably in the armed forces without exposing their private information, such as their Social Security numbers...   I'm glad they are worried about identity theft and personal information getting out.  Speaking of, anyone have any news about the back involving 21.5 million employees' personal information?  This is an incredibly minor benefit that's likely pointless for many at this stage.   The current situation ""leaves a large number of veterans vulnerable to identity theft because they must carry around their DD 214 documents, which contain sensitive personal information, to prove their veteran status.""   How often does anyone actually have to carry around their DD-214?  I've only needed mine a handful of times, typically the same occasions where I would need a birth certificate or Social Security card.  I can't imagine that anyone needs to prove Veteran status so often that it requires carrying around their DD-214 constantly.   Plus, it must be purchased — albeit for a nominal fee, which still must be set by the government.   This is a surefire way to make sure it's never adopted.  With how many veterans being homeless or struggling for money, asking them to pay for an ID that has zero extra benefits is asinine.  It provides nothing and is only going to add extra work to an organization that already can't reliably handle its responsibilities.   The government already issues ID cards to military retirees. The Department of Veterans Affairs already issues ID cards to vets who receive its benefits, primarily for health care. And many states allow veterans to declare their status on driver's licenses.   Then why not have them issue an ID upon discharge, or have each state declare Veteran status on their ID?  These are much simpler methods, and likely to be more efficient since there is a framework for each.  Asking the VA to do this instead is, quite possibly, the worst option available."

The article wasn't really about that, and I let some recent issues affect my post more than I should have.  That said, the idea of a card isn't necessarily a bad one.  I just think they are going about it the entirely wrong way.  The best solution is probably a multi-stage one.  First, enact a law that requires all states to allow Veteran status on ID cards.  That'll cover the short-term.  Second, figure out the VA/DoD crap and get them integrated.  This should already have happened, but at least it's becoming a bigger issue.  Third, have the DoD require each branch to give ID cards upon discharge that include chips just like CACs.  This can be programmed with a temporary status that will expire just like CAC certificates do.  Fourth, have the VA program any adjustments that are required as time goes on.  This would also be used for Veteran's Benefits and any other VA requirement.  I don't have any information about costs or difficulty, but that seems to be the least amount of immediate change while still preparing for the future, and it takes current infrastructure into account."

Thankfully for you, credit unions are the kind of institutions that help out fellow veterans.  Here's a few things you can try, and their caveats:   Call USAA, ask to refinance due to lower income.  No bank will refinance at a lower interest rate, but they're more likely to allow you to miss a payment by moving said payment to the end of your loan term.  So whatever you owed in August will now be owed at the end of the loan, as an additional payment.  This is often used by creditors when they are contacted in good faith. Call a credit union, open an account, and refinance through them.  Yes, you'll be paying a bit more in interest...  But your problems isn't in the amount of money you're paying at the end of the mortgage, your current problem is a cash flow problem.  If you've had the vehicle for a year and have made timely payments on it, most CUs will let you refinance with them for no more than 61 months.  That means that if you had 48 months of payments left, you can now spread them over 61 months, resulting in lower monthly payments (although your total interest paid will go up quite a bit).   Remember:  you have a CASH FLOW problem, not an investment problem.   -Get an insurance quote with a big name company (hint: the ones on TV, I like the red one).  Transfer your insurance.  They'll run a credit report on you to issue you a policy, and if your credit is a little better than most, they'll also push to refinance with them.  It's just the way the business works.  If you do refinance with them you also get a break on your policy.  -Sell the vehicle.  You don't need 8 cylinders for anything.  Whatever you do, MAKE SURE THE DEALER GIVES YOU A SIGNED PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS THEY ARE PAYING OFF YOUR CURRENT LOAN WITHIN THE NEXT X DAYS, with X being a number no bigger than 30, ever.  Call USAA every week to verify that the loan has been paid off.    Anyway, lots of things you can do.  It's definitely not the end of the world.  Remember to go to the VA and sign up for your ""free"" 5 years of health screening.  GI bill is a godsend, and so are the vet centers in your city."
Veterans,3db1mb,frigidjudge,2,Tue Jul 14 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"oh man you are my hero, if i had gold you would get it. It's a 2012 honda accord. i have a 4 year plan and i pay about 300 a month in car payment and about 300 in insurance. I don't know if that's horrible or not. I got my license last year in september (i'm 22). So i'm a recent driver but i have no problems with my car. Only ticket i have is from an MP at fort hood for speeding (which was BS).   I like my car but i also want to move out of my families house and be self reliant. The idea of the job was to work a year and move out almost immediately and get into a comfortable setting in a place before i start school. But at this rate i couldn't do that."
Veterans,3db1mb,frigidjudge,2,Wed Jul 15 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"The ticket from the MPs won't show up during the insurance check.  It probably is a good idea to refrain from mentioning this to them unless they specifically ask if you have ever gotten a ticket ON A PUBLIC ROAD.  IANAL.  $300 for a car payment is about right, and $300 in insurance a month is about right for someone your age (it goes down dramatically after you've been driving for a bit).  Contrary to popular belief, it would probably be wise if you toned it down at home, STAYED THERE, and worked on putting together a rainy day fund for that inevitable rainy day.  Parents aren't such dicks if you show them that you can be a responsible member of the household.  If you leave now, yeah you'll have independence, but expenses are always quick to add up, and if you're late in rent to a landlord you don't know, they'll kick you out in no time (then you'll have more expenses, and an eviction record).  Keep working, and once you start school you SHOULDN'T HAVE TIME to be at home (spend all your time at the library).  Make sure you sign up for a FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY/COLLEGE vs your run of the mill community college if you're using the GI Bill.    Anyway, got tons of advice I could give you, but YMMV.  Since you're just getting out, you should make contact with the local vet center AND GO TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE to talk to the veteran reps.  They usually can find you a really nice place to work that's decent, and if you were to find yourself out of a job, you'll find out that you're eligible for unemployment insurance."
Veterans,3db1mb,noiwontleave,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:26:51 2015 UTC,300 a month in insurance? That is quite excessive. USAA (in my experience) is generally non-competitive in the car insurance realm. I would try your luck with Geico or Progressive.

But for my advice, it'll all depend on how much you owe vs what the car is worth. Sometimes that can be wrapped into another vehicle but that doesn't always mean it's cheaper in the long run. Take your car to carmax and get it valued and you'll have a much better understanding of where you are and what options you have."

I never considered CarMax but I will definitely check out for it."
Veterans,3db1mb,cain8708,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:15:03 2015 UTC,"Depending on how long you've had the loan, you can call and ask for refinance which would lower the interest rate and payments. Depending on how much it's worth, you could sell it. If you can't at least sell it for what you owe, you'd still be reponsible for what's left. If you can come out ahead, you can pay off the loan. If that happens, wait about a month before you get the other car. That way your old one will come off your credit report, and will raise your credit score."

Veterans,3d889s,HahnZahn,3,Tue Jul 14 18:01:54 2015 UTC,"I was an officer and in a completely different field than you, but I'm going to assume some of what you're applying to is through USAJobs. I had applied to lots of jobs on there prior to being in the military, but it didn't really all come together for me until I spoke to my command's civilian HR lady just prior to discharge. She was the first human I'd ever met who was on the other side of the USAJobs black hole. Though I can't offer super-specific advice on your application process, what I can tell you that worked for me (I think about six Fed job offers, to date) is that you must be incredibly specific in your resume. Quantify everything you did, even if it was minor or occurred only once or twice. My USAJobs resume is 13 pages long - clearly much longer than the standard two pages for regular civilian jobs. Again, I don't know about your applications, but specificity on USAJobs is an absolute requirement, and runs counter to what your instincts might tell you when applying to non-Fed jobs."
Veterans,3d889s,HahnZahn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"Did she happen to say if the resume we submit for a USA job gets scanned and filtered out by a computer? Or do human eyes see it? My job code always has a dod 14 question assessment rating your confidence for specific abilities. I always answer above average but just under being perfect... It's a scale basically of 1-8 and I keep myself a 6-7.   Reason I've done this is if I am called for an interview and I answer 8 to everything I'm basically saying I'm perfect. Show up to first day and well, air traffic isn't a golden day for any experienced person who may have 2 years or 29 years. You have to be trained the base procedures, see a few weeks of flying at that specific facility before you get comfortable. Most places give you a month or less to prove you can do it and have a good picture developed.  But maybe I'm hurting myself because the interviewer doesn't see the computer 14 question assessment. Maybe all they see is my general info, dd214, cover letter and resume."
Veterans,3d889s,HahnZahn,2,Tue Jul 14 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"I think there's a computerized system that sorts them based on answers to the multiple-choice questions/Vet preference/Mil Spouse/etc. But my impression is that there are human eyes looking at a lot more of them than you might think. You've probably heard it said to really tailor your resume to the keywords in the job description. It's a cheap tactic, and a real pain in the ass, but I think that's a good way to go. If you're applying to the same type of job time after time, you can probably dial in on what you need to say; not like you have to go through the pain of editing the resume each application. In my case, I have an MA, worked regularly (but not always) with my MA discipline in the Navy, and applied almost exclusively to the civilian version of my officer job. So, my results were good when combined with a little bit of insider perspective from my HR lady. I can't speak to your occupation, as I'm sure the ATC stuff requires a lot more in the way of certifications, testing, etc. On a personal note, I'm really clueless how anyone who isn't a Vet gets a Fed job. You've clearly got that, so you're ahead of the game!   Edit: You're using the USAJobs resume builder, right? Not just uploading some version you made on your own? Because the USAJobs builder is the way to go.  Edit 2: Here's the way I format for each job. I think it arranges things so they can easily see what my responsibilities were:  XXX Duties:  Summary of what I did in that job.  Accomplishments:   Bullet point Bullet point Bullet point"
Veterans,3d889s,the_jak,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:12:02 2015 UTC,"I will be now. Wow sad mistake I made. I figured too that any human eye filtering the top interview candidates also probably doesn't have a clue what the job entails. Describing those details outside of the requirements or description, even though it's just using different words, could mean not getting selected because the person scanning doesn't have a strong comprehension that a tower control is a tower control. Regardless they still have to be trained. An FAA certificate is the same as anyone else's the difference is simply years of experience or time in grade.  So after forty applications for tower positions I was qualified for, I assumed I wasn't called at all because the 20 year retired facility chief controllers were getting hired due to their experience and the buddy buddy system."
Veterans,3d889s,the_jak,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the buddy system may very well be to blame.  I haven't yet had a hand in doing any hiring since I've been in the Fed, but my boss briefly said how (in just our case, anyway) the choosing of applicants was done: they do look at a lot of the applications, and he said some were very clearly qualified for the job, and many others weren't. My boss (who was a GS-12, just recently made 13) does the same job I do (as a 12) and did the initial choosing of candidates. Then I was interviewed by three GS-14s who do totally different work than I do, but they were available. Only one of those three is now one of my supervisors. As a matter of fact, in every interview I've had, they've involved people who work in the same field as I would, in addition to others who are just seeing how you'd fit with the organization. HR only got involved once I got job offers.  So, I guess, it might vary from job to job. My app was looked at by people in my field and not just some HR flack. I can't say if that's the case for all, but I would hope so.  But yeah, use the USAJobs resume builder because that makes it easier for the people hiring to look at information that uses a universal format, rather than hunt for it in an arbitrary format."
Veterans,3d889s,kimchionrye,4,Wed Jul 15 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"The world owes us nothing beyond the contracts we sign. That should be the foremost thing in you mind as you transition to the civilian world.   That said, you have a skill set and experiences that are rare. You have to find a way to leverage that during an interview and in your cover letter. It shouldn't be the whole story, but a component that sets you apart.   Like what /u/Tymanthius said, its an employers market. One employment number is down but when you look at the number of people who have stopped searching for work as well as the number of jobs lost since 2008 compared to the ones created you will see that there is still a deficit. Those being created are not necessarily in a field that is relevant to your current training.   My advice, for what its worth, is to use your GI bill to study something that will augment what you currently know. Thats the route i went with and its been successful so far.   There are some programs if you are having trouble finding work AND you have >= 20% disability rating. Its called Vocational Rehabilitation and they may be able to find you work in a relevant field.   Can I ask what metro area you are in? Im near Tampa so Im familiar with some of the job placement programs in Florida that geared towards veterans"
Veterans,3d889s,jeffsnff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"My background of course being Airspace Management/Operations...title Air Traffic Controller (Tower).  I'm in the panhandle...NW Florida. Three air force bases nearby. Been to several job fairs for vets. All companies besides Waffle House, Lowes, and Home Depot...were gov contract jobs that sought maintenance backgrounds (the main trade of the three bases here).  DOD ATC is a buddy system via USA JOBS.gov - I apply to everyone of them my resume backs up with qualifications just to get my name in front of a human being that can throw it in the trash (due to competing with the 20 year retired vets) - but hey rightfully so, I'd rather someone who retired get that position, they deserve it not me. I'm not that arrogant, I know my place.  School is an option, the problem is relocation to Orlando or Jacksonville - something I cannot do with a family. I am not a distance/computer student. I learn by being in class and having to interact with others and a teacher. Tried the distance e-learning and wasted it due to having to self-teach two classes, and I hated it.  I don't mean to come across and expecting a handout or golden path in society. I really don't. I guess the message every civilian preached to me 6 years ago before I enlisted, was that once I got out, all these opportunities would unfold for me. ""You'll have that military service on your resume, and that'll get you places buddy!""  School is a last card I want to play. It would take me the maximum time to acquire my degree or just under, simply because I would do enough research to find out what the rare/most desired degree is.   I've watched to many friends avoid my choices with the military to stay in school. They all chose the common Psychology, Business Management, Criminal Justice degrees, to all end up working at basic retail jobs, or enlisting in the military afterword to pay off their HUGE student loan debts.  I've also looked into my local police/fire dispatch positions, but the town doesn't pay well. You make more money selling women's swimsuits, problem is they don't hire men.  Frustrating to know that you make minimum wage of 8.50 to work at an auto shop, sweating your ass off, breaking your knuckles when a women can go stand in an air condition 8x8 room in the tourist town down the highway, and make 16 an hour.  I'm just nervous and stressed to a point where I don't want to rush any decisions or career changes that are extreme or hasty and make matters worse. Figured maybe I am not looking in the right place...or maybe I am overqualified...how does one hid who he is to not seem overqualified? I hate lies and pretending to be something I am not.  Keep in mind, my attitude/manners are all on point. I know how to act with people. I am being more sarcastic and blunt on here just because I am speaking my mind."

The panhandle seems like its pretty devoid of a lot of the things that would work for you. Mostly military bases and small towns that support them. If that assessment is accurate then its not a surprise that you are having trouble.   When I approach employment, its weapons free. Youve got to provide for you and yours man, so if it means some retiree that is already getting retirement benefits doesnt get a position because im better qualified or had a better interview. Brutal, yes. Possibly disrespectful? I dont think so but i see how someone could see it that way.   I get your issues with school. Im the same way. I lucked out with USF being here. They are rated as one of the most veteran friendly schools in the country. Its a solid school that does a lot good research. The office of veterans affairs is on point and exponentially more helpful than other Universities Ive attended.   If you manage to get down this way, there are a lot of opportunities for people with the right skill sets, especially IT, software development, database management, analytics, and finance. Off the top of my head, what you did as an air controller probably involved a lot of analytics and some queuing analysis and related disciplines. There are programs that could augment that.   Hang in there man, i've been in a similar position before. The area of Indiana my wife and I are from had really crappy job opportunities with the best being a private prison that paid way too little to deal with the demands of that job. Relocation is a huge pain in the ass but a small amount of hardship for a short time can sometimes lead to a great amount of success and opportunity later.

As others have stated, being a Veteran will only go as far as getting your foot in the door, the rest is on you. It looks to me like you have a few options.  1) Wait it out and hope the ATC job(s) pan out. That could happen tomorrow, or three years from now.  2) Go to a GOOD state school. Schools like U of Texas, Penn State, U Washington, Texas A&M, Ohio State, and plenty more love veterans. It doesn't matter what your grades were in high school. Pitch a good story and I can almost guarantee you can get into a top state school. It might take some work, but success requires work. Don't forget that the GI Bill will pay you BAH for an E-5 with Dependants for the locale your school is based in. You are a fool for not using the GI Bill. If you go to a state school, the chances of you having to take out any loans is pretty much zero, unless you decide to take extra classes. You mentioned something about Embry Riddle which is another veteran friendly school. Why aren't you doing everything you can to get enrolled for the upcoming Fall semester?  Military experience is great, but education is better.   A few questions for you:  Why are you against going to school?  Are there any careers that interests you? Are you against working in an office environment? I would be happy to help you apply for schools and find a program that fits your goals if you're interested. I'll also be happy to take a look at your resume if you would like.  How old are you?   Are you interested in a technical career? The GI Bill will help you pay for that too."

Instead the fundamental question should be - what value could I be to your organization?  Programs such as GI Bill are meant to increase your proposed value to the potential employer.    I will say this though - veterans preference in the private sector is a real thing.  Wall St is perhaps the best example - people will open doors and refer you as long as you have some kind of relevant schooling, a demonstrated interest in the field, and are dedicated.

Veterans,3d889s,Gawdscream,2,Tue Jul 14 13:39:49 2015 UTC,"SN1313,  I am a State Veteran’s Employment Representative (PA). I mostly work with disabled Veterans & homeless Veterans.  I too am a Veteran. I spent 20yrs active duty Army in the Infantry (retired 2011). The transition from military life to civilian life is not easy…and sometimes just outright sucks ass. The frustration you are going through is normal. There is no cookie cutter path for Veterans to follow...it puts you in self-discovery mode… and trying to figure that shit out while under the pressure of time because you have bills to pay, food to put on the table..etc. makes it much more frustrating.  Not sure where you are located. But sometimes the geographic area will influence the level of success you have and how quickly you find a job that you enjoy. You may have to resort to pursuing something semi-temporary just to get your foot in the door.  I enjoy my current job, it’s rewarding and I can get into my “Platoon Sergeant” mode to help some of these knuckle-heads figure out what they want to do. Many are clueless when they get out. Helping the homeless Veterans is very challenging, but when it does works out, it’s a good thing to see them in a better place in life.  You may want to look into working for your state. A civil service job can open other doors. Since I’ve been on board with the state, I can jump over to an Emergency Management position which is much closer to my background. I dropped my name in the hat a week ago and already have an interview lined up. Those positions don’t come up that often, which is the reason I pursued the Veteran’s Representative position, because I knew once I got my foot in the door..I’m walking through another one down the road.  You have a hell of a lot going for you, you just haven’t caught a break yet….that alone can be very discouraging and make you feel very pissed off. You will succeed…there is no doubt. Don’t allow any obstacles to slow you down or prevent you from moving forward…that is the difference between you and some civilians.   Explore more resources, network on LinkedIn…find  a Veteran’s Representative  in your area.

Veterans,3d889s,jbow808,2,Tue Jul 14 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"It was actually somewhat easy..however let me explain. First there was no degree requirement although I do have a BA in Homeland Security. I work for the state of PA. My job title is specifically a DVOP- Disabled Veteran's Outreach Program specialist..or Veteran's Employment Representative..for the past year+ the powers that be have trying to decide which title to make permanent because they don't want the word ""disabled"" to have any negative image issues...  After I finished working overseas, I started looking into different type jobs/resources. I discovered there was a position in my county and all I did was take a civil service test, which is very easy. Here's the thing..within multiple counties in my region there were only 3 slots that were vacant. I'm in Lancaster county, Pa. When filling out the application you put in order of which county you prefer. Depending on how well you score on the test compared to others will determine if you get called for an interview. Being a Veteran helps a lot..being a Veteran with a disability rating helps more..having a degree will help too, but again not a requirement.  Google search your state's civil service web site and look at what jobs appeal to you. You won't know if there is an actual vacancy for a particular job, but you should try and take as many different test as possible because your score/application will be held onto for 12 months. When a vacancy pops up, you're already in the running for it and don't have to scurry to do a test or submit an application.  I recently took a civil service test that covers two different jobs within emergency management which is more my cup of tea. At the time there were no vacancies but I still wanted to drop my name in the hat for when one does pop up. Well last week I got a letter in the mail asking if i would be available for an interview..I guess I made the cut so in a few weeks I'll get another letter letting me know the time & place.  Working and helping Veterans is very rewarding. It will be bittersweet if I do get this other position, but I need to get into a field that is better fitted to my background. Plus there is a nice bump in pay..I would go from 34K to 45K which is pretty damn nice. More importantly the ability to move up in the food chain. With what I'm doing now, there is no next level up, at least not with working one on one with Veterans.

Let me tell you my story, I was medically discharged in 2013. Got a job in August and was laid off from first contracting job in December, moved 1000 miles (company paid) in February for a job in the oil fields as a electronic tech, not exactly a lucrative job in the oil field since I was an hourly employee and didn't get the big bonuses the frac operators got. 11 months after moving oil industry falls apart and I get laid off again in one of the highest cost of living regions in America.   I went from making over $6000 a month to $1600 and could barely afford rent (1600/mo for a 3 bedroom shithole) or find a job that would make enough feed my my kids if I decided to stay there.  Luckily I saved some money and after taking a long overdue vacation and clearing my head, I started reaching out to friends/ former subordinates that were working with RF/ Satcom systems, within 3 months I had 2 solid offers, both of which required a move.   Although both companies offered some form of relocation reimbursement I had to pay the upfront cost (gas, temp lodging, moving truck, rental deposits).   To help cover these expenses, I pretty much sold everything that didn't fit into a 16ft moving truck.  You'll be amazed at the amount of crap you don't need and how much people are willing to pay for that crap.   We made a over $1800 selling things we didn't need anymore. More than enough to cover the cost of the rental truck, gas, and food while on the road. We were also fortunate in the fact we had friends in the place we eventually moved to and stayed with them for a few weeks until we found a place to rent.  Moving isn't too difficult if your willing to do it... As a friend who works with unemployed vets told me, people want to hire vets, problem is most vets aren't willing to move to where the good paying jobs are and expect jobs to just fall in their laps.   Op, I work for a contractor that hires Air Traffic Controllers, but only if your willing to relocate."

This was back in 2012 and was told a decision would be made in 90 days I believe.   About 7 months later, my claim had not moved from the first stage according to ebenefits. I looked up who my rep was and shot him a quick email along the lines of - hey I did this, was told that, here's where I am.   A few days later, his military liaison guy calls and asks if I can come in for a meeting. So I did and we met and spoke about my issues as well as other general things because I was still a constituent. The military liaison had me fill out a paper for a congressional inquiry and I signed over some stuff saying they can discuss and talk about my case.   Within 2 months of that meeting I had the BBE in my hands with a check for back pay and my rating info.

Veterans,3d5zw5,Itsm00,2,Mon Jul 13 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"This editorial is written by one of the leaders of ""Concerned Veterans for America"". It is a VERY politicized organization pushing a minimalist government viewpoint, with almost no veterans on their staff. In fact, several state directors aren't vets, but tea party politicians.  They seek to completely dismantle the entire Department of Veterans Affairs, rather than reform it. That means ALL of it: disability pay, health care, counseling, education benefits, the whole Megillah. They would instead leave veteran care up to private doctors and hospitals, and have no plan for how veterans would be reimbursed for this care. Those troops who joined to get GI bill benefits for education, like I did, would find themselves high and dry.   The only year for which CVA's IRS info is available is 2012. They declined to name their income source, but an investigation by ProPublica found that their ONLY income from that time ($1.94 mil) came from the Koch family's TC4Trust.

Also, all Basic Rider Courses provide a motorcycle (usually smaller 125cc and 250cc bikes) for you to learn on.  If you listen to your instructors then it is highly unlikely that you'll die.

I've known 3 deserters, which I thought was a lot for one person to know, but 20,000 is a shit load.   -My cousins husband went AWOL from his unit ( I think 101st ABN) right before a deployment to Iraq. They found him, brought him back, forced him to deploy, he flipped out in Kuwait before even getting to Iraq, they finally said fuck it and sent him back home where they kicked him out. He can't find a job anywhere, he has to work and live with his parents, my cousin divorced him.   UAV guy in my company got really into drugs when we got back from AFG. Not the happy trippy drugs, but the bath salt, meth type drugs that make you eat faces. He disappeared for weeks (sometimes months) on end, would come back, act normal, and then disappear again. Eventually he was busted down to fuzzy, forced to go to HQ PLT where he would always have 2 battle buddies watching him, supply was forced to go into his room and get all of his shit to turn in, and from what I understand before he could escape again they streamlined the fuckin' paperwork and got him thrown out. I wanna say he was accused of rape at some point during all this too but I could be wrong. A female soldier I met during BN staff duty. She came in for extra duty, we had her sweep, mop, general indoor cleaning stuff. I thought she was kinda cute so I asked her what she'd done to deserve extra duty. She said she'd gone AWOL for 3-4 years. A female PLT sergeant had apparently made her life such a living hell that she just decided to go AWOL. Once she got a ""safe"" distance away from Fort Campbell, she called one of the higher ups and told them that she wasn't coming back until that particular PLT sergeant was no longer at Fort Campbell. They begged her to reconsider. Nope. She moved a couple hours away from her home of record, got a job at a county jail, then somehow she heard the PLT sergeant had left Fort Campbell. She called up one of the higher ups at base and told them she was ready to come back. They paid for her plane ticket and here she was. I found out that the PLT sergeant she was afraid of had been my previous PLT sergeant that had just left a few months prior. She was a huge bitch but I was able to get on her good side within a month, she was pretty cool after that, still unpopular and disliked by most everyone but we got along.

You sign up knowing you are property to be transferred at will, and  bad leadership isn't permanent (I understand what a leader from hell is like, reminding me how worthless I was and threatening to send condemnation notices to the state PD I was planning on applying to upon discharge) and I don't get it. If you're anti war stay out. If you can't take some (alot) of abuse, stay out. It's a volunteer force. It's not hard to avoid. But once you sign that line there's no looking back. I have a slight understanding for those who opposed the war and had signed up pre-911. But there's a place for them too, re class to a non-combat MOS.  Draft issues non-withstanding, I'm very happy that Canada is taking a stand against deserters. Lets face it, the punishment doesn't seem too severe compared to other countries, or even our own laws. 2 years for a desertion during war? I believe that's punishable by death. they're going gentle.  TL:DR Yay! Canada's taking a stand!"

Go to your LPO and inform him that you are no longer taking orders. You'll get court martialed and sent to Leavenworth or wherever.   You always have a choice within any system, you just may not like what the repercussions are."

Unit just got back from Iraq, so I was look guy on the totem pole. Lots of us were. One day the medics have to pull out and inventory the connex. No big deal, except it's full and complete chaos in there. When the doors open shit fell out. So we spent the entire week unfucking the cluster fuck that was given to us privates. Inside was some guys full OCIE. His name still on the ruck, everything. Us being privates thought it was someone who KIA, so we carefully handle his stuff, set it to the side, treat it with respect. Turns out the oxygen thief went on R&R. Decided to just move to Canada. That was the shit he left behind. No one was allowed to rat fuck it, or fuck with it in general."
