treecomics,3dvv0f,laserbong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:37 2015 UTC,Doesn't hydrolysis take a lot of energy?
treecomics,3dvv0f,ThePurpleHayes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of what ""a lot"" means. When you have an entire nuclear powerplant dedicated to powering just this one vessel and all of the energy it requires, then in that situation the energy required to generate enough oxygen to replenish losses of oxygen is a trivial amount of energy.   And FYI, hydrolysis reactions are happening constantly in all living cells. (Though these hydrolysis reactions aren't hydrolysis of water into its constituent atoms.)"

In other countries our habits support child slavery and human cruelty, and while weed, especially locally grown weed isn't as morally reprehensible, we still need to be aware of the human cost. In this case, batman is justified for wreking this coke dealer, because he's part of a larger organization that is causing human suffering and supporting other crime ventures. At least when it goes legal there won't be violence and growers will be forced to work by labor practices even if it means for sure that Philip Morris will copywright hash or something assinine like that"

We can all relate to both sides of this comic: the eager glee of broadcasting your smoking to the world, and the exasperation with people who turn smoking weed into a lifestyle they must broadcast to the havens. This can also be read as a conversation between a new, novice stoner and the more experienced ent, and how we react to this sort of merchandise. It also speaks to a smiliar conversation we seem to be having on r/trees lately.  Pot Shot doesn't really have characters per se, but the use of each character in their respective roles here does fit with the rudimentary characteristics each character has.

treecomics,3bea7a,megameh64,4,Sun Jun 28 14:36:13 2015 UTC,I have never played Fallout so I'm afraid this comic is lost on me.
treecomics,3bea7a,WolfTristan,3,Sun Jun 28 19:46:56 2015 UTC,"In Fallout there is a system called VATS which has to do with shooting/hitting someone. You use your AP to perform hits in VATS and depending on a number of factors you have a certain percent of hitting the body part you're aiming for. You can also shoot things out of people's hands. So in this case, he entered vats to grab the joint, but 6% is a pretty low chance of getting it. Instead of answering he waited for is AP to regenerate and that's the comic"

treecomics,39yg6w,onloanfromgod,4,Tue Jun 16 09:48:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a fun read! It's funny, I've been making and reading these comics for years now and I don't think I ever really considered how important this formula is. I think it's probably something that everyone who reads them probably knows whether they realize it or not; pot shot is an easy target but you can look through a lot of other comics on this subreddit and find ones that are generally disliked even if nobody can specifically say why. I'm thinking back over my list of comic ideas, specifically the ones I've rejected or struggled to find a joke in, and sure enough, most of them are missing an element of your formula. I'll take a proper look at my list when I'm home and try to find some examples. I'd like to point out an additional element you sometimes find that's usually exclusive to tree comics. Comics about weed have the luxury of being goofy almost without explanation; my comic about the quest for the perfect ten spends most of its time in a ridiculous dream sequence, there's that great one about Africa, or one where a father is scolding his son and suddenly turns into a cat (sorry, on mobile so I can't link these) maybe it's a little lazy, but I would guess comics like that are less the result of them being about weed and more the result of the author being high. I dunno where those fall into your formula but I thought I'd mention it. Anyway thanks for the write-up, I read it this morning and its been on my mind all day. You wouldn't expect there'd be much of an art to making tree comics but you're right in that it's a pretty unique genre. I'd flair this thread if I was a more competent mod but you'll just have to settle for my approval!"
treecomics,39yg6w,TheGaz,3,Tue Jun 16 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your kind words!   I actually had another section I cut because I was already getting into wall of text territory, but I consider those to be Autobiographical in a way. Africa and the cat dad are both good examples of this, because they show inside the head of someone who smokes weed. We may not have had the exact ""Africa"" experience ourselves, but we may have been overcome by a strain and pulled inside ourselves in ways that make sense to us. The imagery then shows us what it is like to be stoned or the person's thought process while creating high. In that sense, the high is translated into the comic itself. Its why sometimes, comics made when someone is way too high can still be funny, like the one where the guy gets baked and tries to make a comic, and ends up creating nothing.   I don't have a solid answer, though, because I can't draw for shit, so I don't quite know how that particular creative process feels. I'm interested in your thoughts as one of the major creators!"

treecomics,39rai5,JabbaDaFuck,6,Sun Jun 14 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the stylized, vaguely off-putting images that have a vaguely foreboding look to them! And I personally think dividing semantics with language is hilarious. And the plot? This strip is based off a strip where a joint is pumped about getting a seriously shitty medical condition. The fact that Weed Read brought the smack down with its particular brand of ""recognizing these are sentient weed apparatus"" and its special writing pattern made this stip a lot funnier. But hey, you can't really explain why something is funny to someone else. I'm looking forward to the day Pot Shot dies and TheGaz brings his style to his own topics, if only because Pot Shot sucks, but until then, I'll take his hash over Pot Shot's mids every day of the week."

treecomics,39rai5,JabbaDaFuck,4,Mon Jun 15 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"Dude, take a look at my history, I've been here for years. I make treecomics that are more words than anything because I can't draw for shit. If I could draw even close to what theGaz is doing, I'd be doing that instead, hahaha. But I've read most of the treecomics posted on this sub for those last few years, and I've developed a lot of thoughts about what is a good or bad treecomic, which is why I support theGaz's work.   If I was Gaz, which I obviously am not, this ruse would have taken 3 years to set up, as we are both 3 year accounts. I'm not even gonna mention that your account has what, 16 posts to it, most of which are in this thread, and that you started posting 2 days ago? You look a lot more suspicious than me, dude. But if you are PotShots guy or not I don't mean to call you out. This is a conversation between you and me, and your identity and mine don't really factor in. Treecomics are an art, man."

I was like ok i mean no big deal just probably wants to not wait and just have it kick in when he's high.

One day, I bust out the frozen brownie, my NDS, and put on some good ol' netflix as I melt into the train of the sectional. I eat half of the brownie, and thirty minutes later, I don't really feel anything. I decide to stuff the rest of the brownie in my mouth, because even if it didn't work, it still tasted delicious.   Boyfriend at the time walked into the living room to find me in the fetal position, blankets over my head, pretty much sunken into the cushions of the couch. I remember he tried to talk to me, and I had about 5 different retorts in my head to whatever question he posed.   10/10 would do again- but man that was a terrifying night, haha."

Fuckit those brownies tasted great, and my tolerance is amazing.  Scarf 2 more.   Wait twenty minutes, nothing.   Screwit I'm going to bed. Sorry, friend, I screwed up the recipe apparently. So sorry.   Wake up with my sheets clenched in my fists, and for what seemed like an hour I try to unclench my fingers. Not sure why I'm doing it in the first place, and am pretty sure I'm dreaming.  Then I feel gravity and it is sideways. My bed, it would seem, is laying on my side wall, and my floor is to my right  (that is what it feels like, anyways.)   Finally unclench and realize I am just super freakin' stoned.   Shuffle to the bathroom as quickly as my addled brain will let me. Warily turn on the light. My eyes... I had never seen them so red. I was cashed out. Done for...  After that i tried to smoke a cig on my balcony but was too high to calm my  paranoia.

I had a weekend at the beach in Washington state with some friends that are big into dabbing, and over the course of the weekend dabs became a lot easier. That's why I like wax pens though, a lot easier to control the high since you're getting less wax at one than doing a dab"
treecomics,2zyuvi,LCDforever,2,Tue Mar 24 17:51:03 2015 UTC,This is the most accurate representation of dabs I've seen.  Like when I first did it I was living with my mom and she's totally fine with me smoking. I got so high I couldn't be around her. Took like an hour long shower to avoid sitting at the dinner table. I had just got done working so I had a good excuse for it. I've never done it without life turning into a disaster and I've handled some pretty important things I was surprised with while high.

treecomics,2wszjk,ImurderREALITY,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:25:29 2015 UTC,"ill try to explain, dont mind my english, not first language. try parking in a not exactly level surface, a small lean downwards. that was the case in that spot, when he just pushed the stick, in either first or third gear, the clutch pad mildly grips the flywheel, enhancing movement, helped by the small negative slope. but you really have to enforce it and its bad for your transmition to, engage gear without clutch. and why didnt the car stall, because the pedal was already in allmost top position, and we were moving (about a meter, then i slipped) and then it couldnt stall because the gear was already locked(you can adjust in that top part either press on to slow down and stop or let go to fully clutch). Doesnt work on all cars some need finely calibrated gas pedal tuning, some you can just mobilize by slowly reliving the gas. You asked so i had to explain, cheers :)"

The puffs may be decorated or left plain or garnished with chocolate sauce, caramel, or a dusting of powdered sugar.  In some areas, the term profiterole is used for small versions filled with whipped ice cream  and topped with chocolate   although the usage varies and can include other fillings.

A couple days later, after school one day we (5 of us) argued about it in a circle outside his mustang in the school parking lot when the school detective came up and asked what we were talking about. I straight up looked him in the eye, pointed at my friend and said ""this dude got an entire pizza and said he'd share if I brought paper plates. I brought them and it turns out he lied and the pizza was just for him and his girlfriend and he just wanted my plates to eat it off of. I even brought the pizza cutter!""   The detective looks at me for a second and says ""...was it good pizza?"" And i said ""I wouldn't know, since he sm-.. ate it all.""

treecomics,2q94u7,onloanfromgod,16,Wed Dec 24 05:48:33 2014 UTC,"I have experienced said phenomenon many times, and due to my ""Pure Consumer"" relationship with drugs I've ended up supporting a lot of my friends in their dealing efforts through the years. This has given me more info than could possibly be useful about dealer antics, how to preempt them, and why they (mostly) shouldn't be taken personally.   For the subject of this comic specifically I feel there are three explanations that explain this common dealer to consumer interaction.    Dealer is busy - Seriously, dealers have lives too. Family, SO's, jobs, errands, shopping to do, sleep to catch up on. SOLUTION: Hit your dude up before you run out. You don't need specifics or anything just ""Hey, I'm bout dry, what's the climate like?"" then go on about your day. If they're free they'll hit you up and you can set some specifics then. If they don't get to you until the next day,...no big deal.  Dealer is dry/waiting for Re-up - A lot of dealers just put their customers on a shelf when they're out. It's pretty tedious explaining to different people all day what the deal is. This is where consumers fuck up the most. They bug..and bug...and bug and after the 6th ""Hey, any word?"" text sometimes dealers just turn off their work phones. SOLUTION Patients. Dealer can't make Supplier drive any faster. Bugging them wont do anything but make them not like you, and I fucking promise they have not forgotten that you wanted some. You can rest assured of that because, as is their nature, dealers want to get paid.  You're a PoS customer - You're being ignored because your dealer truly dislikes dealing with you more than they like money. That's...impressive I guess. If you: Bug (Seriously, stop that), give unknown (to the dealer) people their number, get pissy when you're told there will be a wait, complain about the quality, ask for better breaks every. single. visit, never offer to smoke one with em before they split (Most will refuse, but it's the thought that counts), or have broken deals/fallen short on fronts/stolen customers...then most likely they just don't want to deal with you unless they have to. SOLUTIONS....don't be a bag of cunts?"

Even weed can slow down your reaction times.   I used to toke and drive. I never got into an accident but I noticed myself making stupid mistakes like forgetting to put my car into gear or putting it into the wrong one when I was stoned. I stopped stoned driving because I saw the mistakes as a warning sign that stoned driving isn't as good as sober driving."

treecomics,2o03o6,BalenciagaPapi,7,Tue Dec 2 01:59:20 2014 UTC,Wait. How where you wrong? I think friction was helping you walk because your body is not a single solid part and instead has several moving parts that use friction unlike most physics models students see physics in college or highschool.
treecomics,2o03o6,PolloMilord,8,Tue Dec 2 07:39:55 2014 UTC,I think a human body walking up a staircase is a bit more complex than those models used for introduction to these concepts.
treecomics,2o03o6,PolloMilord,4,Tue Dec 2 07:41:20 2014 UTC,Just because walking up a staircase involves more than just friction and counteracting gravity doesn't mean walking up a staircase does not involve friction and counteracting gravity.
treecomics,2o03o6,Pufflekun,2,Tue Dec 2 21:58:49 2014 UTC,I think he was probably just using that as an example. It's pretty hard to put an epiphany like OP had into words.

Just because it's different than it used to be doesn't mean it's worse... it's just different.  Looking back it will all weave into a tapestry of different times."

The pie itself is similar to the United Kingdom's steak pie.  It is considered iconic in Australia and New Zealand.  It was described by former New South Wales Premier Bob Carr in 2003 as Australia's ""national dish"".  New Zealanders regard the meat pie as a part of New Zealand cuisine, and it forms part of the New Zealand national identity.   The popular brand Four'N'Twenty produces 50,000 pies per hour and Australians consume an average of 12 meat pies each per year.  The average consumption of meat pies in New Zealand is 15 per person per year.  The meat pie is heavily associated with Australian rules football and Rugby League as one of the most popular consumed food items whilst watching a game.

So i hit back and I was on r/trees.   and just  had an emotional punch in the face moment where I felt so great for figuring that out.   Now I;m confused what to do.. stop typing?  Oh {crab}  attempt at editting this.   What's weird is the guy doesn't have red eye's and felt so sad for him.  Edit Started at a [10] now [8]

treecomics,2j6c03,Deracination,13,Tue Oct 14 02:50:51 2014 UTC,Resin out of a bong is the tits man it almost doesn't taste like resin and you can take massive hits without your throat getting burned by all the super hot smoke/air.
treecomics,2j6c03,TomorrowByStorm,3,Tue Oct 14 06:54:13 2014 UTC,How do you smoke resin on a bong? Just light it?
treecomics,2j6c03,eXX0n,3,Tue Oct 14 17:04:34 2014 UTC,Make sure it's in a nice ball and then let it harden a bit in open air. It'll burn similar to hash when not super goo like.
treecomics,2j6c03,TomorrowByStorm,2,Tue Oct 14 19:51:20 2014 UTC,Roll it up into a little ball
treecomics,2j6c03,BookofJoe,3,Tue Oct 14 19:40:01 2014 UTC,"And just put it in the bowl and light it? Sounds like it would melt and be pulled down in the water?  I would pretty much use the same technique I use when I'm smoking hash on a bong. Roast a cigarette and crunch it down to fine powder and heat up the hash and mix it to a fine mix. Burns REALLY well and smooth, at least for hash.  EDIT: Oh, btw, we all use a screen on our bongs here."
treecomics,2j6c03,eXX0n,1 point,Tue Oct 14 19:43:06 2014 UTC,If you roll it up tight enough it should burn just fine. If it's a really small piece then yeah you're gonna have trouble.

treecomics,2hxju8,Sir_Catbread,5,Tue Oct 7 16:04:17 2014 UTC,"It says ""he puked"" so I imagine it is his friend but none the less it is still possible. I think of it this way; new smokers don't always know how to react to that high feeling. I myself remember when I first started smoking reached a point where I actually fell over while walking and immediately let everything in my stomach go haha. Think of it as over stimulation and you mentally can't handle what is going on and your body is trying to evacuate itself in anyway can (Sweating, Puking, etc...).   TL;DR: The feeling of being high is a completely foreign one to the body (for new smokers) and our body usually rejects things it doesn't think should be there."

treecomics,2fh7jq,TheRealKidkudi,3,Fri Sep 5 13:07:22 2014 UTC,"To be honest, it wasn't very funny. There's no punchline or real joke besides the pun in the title."
treecomics,2fh7jq,PryingOpenMy3rdBeer,11,Fri Sep 5 00:15:45 2014 UTC,"IDK, i enjoyed it, the lets get a puff of air was funny. I don't wish I'd not clicked on it, so it was worth the post. Better than rage comics."
treecomics,2fh7jq,TheRealKidkudi,2,Fri Sep 5 01:45:43 2014 UTC,"Definitely better than rage comics. I thought the art was good, and I think the artist could make good comics, but this one just didn't really have any direction. It just was a scene of two dudes having a typical sesh under the sheets.  I dunno, just some honest criticism. Didn't expect people to downvote it just because it wasn't positive."
treecomics,2fh7jq,PryingOpenMy3rdBeer,1 point,Fri Sep 5 02:18:24 2014 UTC,"yeah, downvotes were supposed to be used for not contributing to discussion, not for differing opinions but nobody uses it correctly.  Hard to judge by this one comic though, if someone is producing comics on a regular, it's hard to make every single one a knee slapper, though i believe this one probably could've been condensed better into fewer frames, i still found it worth reading :D"
treecomics,2fh7jq,pottymouthgrl,5,Fri Sep 5 02:50:01 2014 UTC,I enjoyed it as just a relatable comic. Doesn't need to be funny.
treecomics,2fh7jq,KoolAidPenguin,2,Fri Sep 5 03:17:42 2014 UTC,It was funny to me because I've been on the front page of reddit and didn't see which subreddit this was. I didn't understand at first they were smoking [6] and the reveal made me smile.
treecomics,2fh7jq,SatyrMex,1 point,Fri Sep 5 05:19:22 2014 UTC,I might be dead wrong about this but MAYBE this comic is done in the style of Life in Hell by Matt Groering. Its deliberately just barely funny but it makes you think its actually funny. Or this is just a barely funny comic that makes you think is funny by mistake and im too high to tell the difference.
treecomics,2fh7jq,bert4560,0,Sat Sep 13 11:14:27 2014 UTC,I only found it funny becuse i did that on 420 a couple years back.

treecomics,2fdadr,onloanfromgod,10,Wed Sep 3 17:20:47 2014 UTC,I went through the archives and this comic is really frustrating to read. Both the adults and the kids come off looking like assholes just about every time.

treecomics,2fdadr,feloniousthroaway,1 point,Thu Sep 11 16:00:41 2014 UTC,I never said it was an excuse. But it's a disease. It's a symptom of that disease. Telling people that it shouldn't be that way doesn't fucking make it disappear.
treecomics,2fdadr,Martient712,1 point,Thu Sep 11 16:27:11 2014 UTC,"Well, that would depend on the disease, wouldn't it?  I've had 2 heart attacks and don't let that stop me from physical activity.  These guys are all amputees and can still play sports.  Now, pancreatic cancer would probably stop someone from functioning fully.  But with depression, a person may not feel like doing something but they still have the ability to make the choice to do it or not.  That's the perspective I'm coming from."
treecomics,2fdadr,noshore4me,3,Fri Sep 5 13:48:31 2014 UTC,That's the perspective I'm coming from.   The perspective of someone who's never had to deal with depression before?

Or is it both, like a cycle that feeds itself? If so, (and this is going to make me sound old), this kid needs to break the cycle himself by cutting back on the smoking and learning to handle the criticism of others."

treecomics,2e3sa3,anonymous_troll,2,Wed Aug 20 21:05:51 2014 UTC,Thank you
treecomics,2e3sa3,LeonidsFila,5,Wed Aug 20 22:57:03 2014 UTC,"I'll offer some constructive criticism.  A pun like that is a simple throwaway joke.  We all got what was the final punchline of the joke from the first panel.  This sort of joke makes a good t-shirt or bumper sticker, but you don't want to make a whole comic out of it.  In the case of a multi-panel comic like this, the joke needs to be a short story.  There needs to be a payoff for reading all three frames.  It sounds cold, because, after all, how much effort are we putting into reading your comic?  Well, we're putting in none, but you're putting in the effort to draw it, so you need to start on a good foundation.  Anyway, you need for your comic to not give away the punchline until the end.  Either the world's strongest bud is an intro to a short story with an unexpected ending (hence the humor), or the fact that ""strongest"" means ""muscular"" needs to not be given away until the end.  This sort of free-association is great for humor, but it's a starting point.  If you watch TV, little jokes like this are throw-ins that add humor to bigger stories and situations."
treecomics,2e3sa3,anonymous_troll,2,Thu Aug 21 10:13:06 2014 UTC,I didn't even know there was a pun until you explained it. I literally did not understand the point of this comic.  In an attempt to not be a dick I'll say the artist is talented!
treecomics,2e3sa3,broff,-4,Sun Oct 19 06:38:05 2014 UTC,Well in our eyes these are little throw in jokes because the bud is a comic book the strips are what we believe happens between the actual book and sometimes during. For us these are just fun.

treecomics,2dc1gm,Tayjocoo,18,Tue Aug 12 18:24:56 2014 UTC,Hits from a joint tend to be deeper and held longer.
treecomics,2dc1gm,tenhotuisku,8,Tue Aug 12 18:26:37 2014 UTC,Yeah I suppose so.  I smoke them just about the same personally.  For a minute there I was thinking this comic was about straight-inhaling as opposed to pulling smoke into your mouth and then breathing in so that it mixes with the air and doesn't hurt your throat.  I've met a couple of people that just straight-inhale everything and I don't understand how they survive it.
treecomics,2dc1gm,sailingtowesteros,5,Tue Aug 12 18:42:04 2014 UTC,"But isn't what you're describing exactly two different ways of smoking? I straight-inhale joints and don't do the same with cigarettes.   I used to straight inhale everything for years though, it's not that ""rough"" if you're used to it."
treecomics,2dc1gm,tenhotuisku,3,Wed Aug 13 03:21:11 2014 UTC,"I am describing two different ways, I was just saying I smoke both the same way and don't get why anyone would do it the other way."
treecomics,2dc1gm,Crimyote,3,Wed Aug 13 04:51:21 2014 UTC,"I never inhaled cigarette smoke as deeply as I do with weed. It didn't sit right in my lungs and caused me stress. I was a very casual cigarette smoker, and only had possibly 2 packs every month and a half or so, if not longer. So that might have been a factor.  Also, smoking weed vs cigarettes causes different muscles helping me inhale. With cigs, it was always (what felt like) my chest muscles. With weed, i can feel the pull more in my stomach and feels more like a deep breath I would use to play a wind instrument."
treecomics,2dc1gm,Dragin410,1 point,Wed Aug 13 07:01:12 2014 UTC,"and don't get why anyone would do it the other way.    might have something to do with how you're used to ""straight inhaling"" weed from bongs etc.  I haven't smoked enough pipe tobacco to judge if there's a difference with that."
treecomics,2dc1gm,ip00nu6,1 point,Thu Aug 14 09:47:12 2014 UTC,I just can't plain do a straight inhale when smoking anything.  Even if I try it's like my whole body is yelling at me that I'm doing it wrong.    Either way I like to draw it into my mouth first anyway. It makes me control my breathing for a good long time and really helps me get into a really good mental place before the smoke has had anytime to really effect.
treecomics,2dc1gm,madbassist,2,Sun Aug 24 07:33:40 2014 UTC,"Most people I know straight inhale joints, and draw cig smoke into the mouth then inhale"
treecomics,2dc1gm,ganjaguy23,3,Wed Aug 13 07:11:23 2014 UTC,Sometims when I smoke nothing but weed for awhile and then hit a cigarette I just rip the cig as hard as I can and hold it in. Then it tastes gross and I cough like shit.

Where that 10 is is subjective, but generally debilitating.  My first 10 was a little scary as I thought I had forgotten basic math which is very important for my job.

treecomics,28zl68,Foxata,2,Tue Jun 24 23:37:42 2014 UTC,"You don't have to reply to everyone with the same shit man. No, driving high isn't nearly as bad as driving drunk. But it does impair you, more or less depending on the person. So just because you're better at counterstrike when you're high don't go around being negative to people that are just trying to make the world a safer place"

treecomics,28zl68,RocketJeb,0,Wed Jun 25 20:54:29 2014 UTC,You are still intoxicated when you're stoned. Your reaction time is slower than you think it is. A dutch documentory did something on this with someone who had ADHD. He did a test sober and a test while stoned. And his reaction time slowed way down after he smoked. It's dangerous and nothing better than drunk driving.
treecomics,28zl68,Foxata,1 point,Wed Jun 25 20:57:52 2014 UTC,"You are kidding yourself if you think driving high is just as dangerous as operating a vehicle drunk. I don't condone intoxicated driving in any form but if I had to chose, I would be magnitudes less nervous getting a ride from a high person vs that same person drunk."
treecomics,28zl68,ShotgunPete,1 point,Wed Jun 25 22:18:28 2014 UTC,For real? Even though it is less dangerous you are actually making this acceptable? How are you people thinking like that? I'm only saying it stupid. Even though you are less likely to make an accident it is still stupid as hell and people like you only make it worse. Maybe america is indeed not ready for legalisation.
treecomics,28zl68,Foxata,2,Wed Jun 25 22:36:25 2014 UTC,"I think you misread my comment. I was in no way saying that it is acceptable. I completely understand the possible risks of driving high. Weed as a drug however impairs driving ability far less than alcohol, therefore those risks are less severe."
treecomics,28zl68,ShotgunPete,0,Wed Jun 25 19:02:14 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, I made a stupid comment.  Just very baffled at some people who are thinking it is acceptable.

treecomics,28zl68,RocketJeb,0,Wed Jun 25 21:07:45 2014 UTC,Dude. Honestly tolerance has nothing to do with this. Just because you're better at something  while stoned doesn't mean you should feel entitled enough to drive stoned. You are just as worse as drunk drivers.
treecomics,28zl68,Foxata,0,Wed Jun 25 21:34:04 2014 UTC,"Man, I would love to get super baked on one hit. That would be super cheap but not my point. Don't make assumptions about my personal life you don't know nothing about, it's childish and completely off topic. No matter what influence you are under even if it is less dangerous you should not make the descision to drive because you think ""you are better at games when stoned"".  I come from a country where this shit is tolerated and even sold at local shops. I hear enough about stoned drivers making fucking accidents. But I am incredibly sorry for trying to make the world a better place."

One night this room of people we knew was packed and we knew exactly what they were doing in there so we came up and knocked, said our phrase, then the entire room instantly went silent. Trying to hold back laughs, we put our ears up to the door and could just barely hear the sound of the window sliding open.  This room was literally right around the corner from the back door entrance, so my friend and I ran out the back just in time to see like fucking 20 kids scatter in all directions like a group of bugs would if you lifted the rock they were under. It was fucking hilarious, some dove into some bushes, others ran across the grass that extended behind the building, some cowered behind the dumpster, but the funniest thing of all was the kid carrying the bong; he fuckin screwed across the parking lot full sprint with both hands out in front of him death gripping the glass like a flag runner in WW1. We just burst out laughi g outside and told everyone its cool. A few jimmies were rustled but ultimately it was fine. But god damn id be lying if that wasnt hilarious to see."

It was about 9pm and we were smoking at an elementary school playground.  1 says, ""Oh shit, one time"" then takes off running.  Naturally we take off too and I had the zip in my pocket.  When I got to the street, I threw the bag into the gutter.  1 stopped and was just smiling trying to catch his breath, 2 is looking pissed off, trying to catch his breath and I didn't say anything.  I just walked right up to 1, punched him right in his chest and he starts wheezing.    I forgot he already had asthma.  With the combination of his asthma, him running and me hitting him in his chest, he starts to have an asthma attack.  He rarely needed his inhaler so he didn't have it on him.

treecomics,25bqt0,RustyWinger,13,Mon May 12 11:53:28 2014 UTC,Dabs are 70-90% THC. They're basically absurdly concentrated bud.

treecomics,25bqt0,tgjer,5,Mon May 12 20:54:44 2014 UTC,"Just a type of hash. Typically it refers to BHO or co2 extractions, but you can dab bubble hash too or anything melty."

treecomics,25bqt0,jonezy1995,6,Mon May 12 13:07:05 2014 UTC,"It's smoking hash oil. Usually ""taking a dab"" refers to using a water pipe set up for smoking oil, but in this comic they use the term fur taking hits out if a vape pen."

treecomics,25bqt0,Ad__Hominem,5,Mon May 12 19:32:25 2014 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel about dabbing. Somehow people always manage to find ways to make smoking weed a needlessly complex and unchill process. Just buy a fucking hash pipe if you're gonna smoke hash oil, it is literally exactly the same effect and all you need to do is light up and blaze up like you would a normal bowl. No need to get an expensive piece specifically designed for dabbing that you have to use a blowtorch to light."
treecomics,25bqt0,JustAWonderfulMan,5,Mon May 12 20:54:51 2014 UTC,my piece was $50 and i don't regret it at all. Invest into a cheap rig and buy some shatter and you'll be in love. But i dont go around hating on weed or other ways to get high
treecomics,25bqt0,xItsJet,6,Mon May 12 22:16:57 2014 UTC,I do. Dabs are meh. Highly overrated.
treecomics,25bqt0,JustAWonderfulMan,3,Tue May 13 00:15:13 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure you've dabbed... It's such a flavourful, clean, puffy but not harsh smoke. 11/10 would dab again."
treecomics,25bqt0,Lynii,2,Tue May 13 04:30:28 2014 UTC,"I have, all I was saying is it's not really superior to smoking hash by other means.  Mostly I've just been identifying with the comic in that everyone I know who swears by dabs and rarely does anything but dab to get high tend to be younger and needlessly super aggressive like this strip portrays. I'm a very low-key person. I just don't understand the obsession and the psycho culture I've been observing around it -- not to pass judgement on any of the random internet peeps blowing me up."
treecomics,25bqt0,JustAWonderfulMan,2,Tue May 13 05:36:30 2014 UTC,See you literally are exactly the kind of person this comic is talking about

The MFLB combusts the weed a bit, too. Temp control is harder since you have to figure out how much air you need to draw in, and how long you let the battery heat up the coil, and just sorta have to get a feel for it instead of dialing in a number and going for gold."

treecomics,25ao9n,ThePurpleHayes,3,Mon May 12 02:19:31 2014 UTC,"Yup! But holding the battery on longer also changes the temp as the battery discharges, the amount of amps drawn will decrease, less power per hit, etc."

I would say that your manner of discourse and what you choose to create conflict over is much more strongly correlated with maturity than what you enjoy for recreation. Besides, this comic references gauntlet, which came out in 1987, meaning we are dealing with an 80's or 90's kid, meaning someone that is 25 at youngest.  TL:DR You are terrible at guessing people's ages."
