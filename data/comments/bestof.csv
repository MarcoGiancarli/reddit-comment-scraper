Good write up though.   Edit: Did a bit of testing  As you can see,3D clocks from the time i started installing up to the time i disabled the Avira.Systray service in MSCONFIG.  It appears that the Systray is doing it but im not sure how much disabling it limits functionality.   Also noted a marked increase in boot times. Over 20 seconds from entering my desktop password untill the time my applications,MSI Afterburner for overclocking and Atuning for mobo fan control,were fully loaded. Compared to the <10 seconds with Panda.   i5 4690k @ 4.2,8gb Gskill RAM, Win7 Ultimate on an SSD.  Double Edit: It also installed Avira Browser Safety even though i opted out of all extra applications..."

bestof,3e2j3v,Sayis,25,Tue Jul 21 17:18:48 2015 UTC,"Basically, it means it will have high GPU usage if what /u/Pinksters says is true, this would mean bad battery efficiency in laptops and a louder PC on desktops.  It means the graphics card is doing quite a high level of processing for no good reason (considering it is an antivirus)."
bestof,3e2j3v,oscarandjo,8,Tue Jul 21 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  Modern Graphics run at certain speeds(example: my GPU runs at 1175mhz Core and 1690 mhz Memory) during intensive rendering(Playing games and such).   While you're doing nothing but browsing on the net/playing solitaire all that power isn't needed. So to save energy and wear on your electronics,as well as produce less heat, GPUs also have a ""Low power"" or ""2D"" mode where the clock frequencies,and voltages needed to supply those frequencies, are greatly reduced(mine runs 300core/750 memory).   This new Graphic User Interface,the one you access through the notification area on your taskbar, for some reason makes your GPU stick into 3D clocks all the time. It's not graphically intensive or anything. I think it's just a programming oversight.  Regardless,it's unacceptable for anyone who spends money on these parts to wear them out faster(voltage=heat=silicon degradation) for no reason."

If I'm playing something 2D like Titan Souls, or a Wadjeteye point & click, my speeds don't change because the rendering is probably less intensive than a webpage. If I open up Witcher 3, I'll go from 135 core/162 mem (idle speeds) up to ~1500/1950, which is what my overclocks are set to.  You can also (with Nvidia cards at least) change the general settings to 'prefer maximum performance' and that will cause your clocks to go up to gaming speeds just when playing back a video in VLC or something."

Trend Micro - Used to be really good. command line scanner will still do a good job but its firewall does some weird things and active scanner has gotten heavy.  Kaspersky - Best scanner, best for anyone with a decent computer and in-need of a good all around av.  finds and removes almost everything.  offer a bunch of free apps too. TDSKiller, KRD, etc.  Webroot - much like trend, its hay day has passed.  still a good scanner, most version just scan what it wants to scan and require configuration to do an actual full system scan.  Windows Defender - basic security, can detect things it cant remove,(fun). Decent for people who feel invincible on the internet. doesnt need much to run and its free.   Avira - Heavy for a free av. decent scan decent removal rate. Bothers you about pay features all the time.   NOD32 - Same as avira in my experience.  Decent but nothing great.  Viper - Decent av, scan takes a while. Great for people who are paranoid; it constantly tells you all the things it's doing to ""protect you"".  Had to do removals on systems with it installed.   Panda - The command line scanner still can catch a thing or two but why bother when other avs can do it better. Has a free version now but it bothers you to pay.  had a cool free online scanner back in the day.  F-Secure - only used the command line. would only find one really hidden thing per scan. was kinda slow, we did use it fairly often.  There were a couple more command line scanners, I've used but that wont really help most people.  To install on you parents/Family computer(s) - Kaspersky  Doing someone a favor they dont wanna spend money - Avira or Nod  better yet, install chrome and a popup /adblocker and most of the issues go away.    also pre install teamviewer on family computers to allow for easy fixing."

Before British contact, the only poses you'll see associated with the word yoga are essentially just good posture for sitting, standing, or laying still during extended periods of meditation.    This isn't like Tai Chi where there's a genuine ancient connection between specific physical exercise practices and a religious path. You won't even really see modern genuine Hindu Religious leaders give a crap about it. A Hindu should follow their duty, show devotion to the gods, contemplate ultimate truths, and seek out spiritual experiences - not stretch a lot.

Yoga comes from the same root as the word yoke (both are incredibly well conserved from PIE). It was used as a core metaphor in truly ancient stories, and has multiple meanings today. It's used a lot in actual Hinduism. That's what you're talking about - the yoga sutra and the yoga school. I've heard Hindus who emphasize other traditions and scripture use it in different ways. But this is all very much tangential to the story of 'yoga' the set of stretching excercises.  Calisthenics came to India via the British. Indians ran with it, developed a much better system of stretching excercises, and then it spread. Unfortunately, it spread with a name and with cultural baggage that should have been better understood as separate from the exercise system. The yoga you speak of is a precious part of Hinduism - and not at all a system of stretching excercises.  What you're talking about is yoga. What I'm talking about is 'yoga'."

bestof,3dz37t,OminousG,25,Tue Jul 21 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Some of the things he was describing are dangerous if you don't know what the hell you're doing. Not to mention, there didn't seem to be any emphasis on how do to yoga properly-using your whole body while at the same time not straining it. If it hurts a little, that's okay, if it hurts more than a little, you should probably ease up or stop. Yoga is gentle and friendly. At least, in my opinion."
bestof,3dz37t,cuppincayk,27,Tue Jul 21 03:39:55 2015 UTC,"in my experience there are absolutely no yoga beginner classes that are truly catered to the ""I can't stretch my hamstrings to put my fingers past my knees""  beginners (like me).   All the beginner level courses have people in them that have done yoga for at least months and can do the poses fairly well. The instructor even asks in a BEGINNER's course ""if you can do this, try the more advanced pose by..."" I mean goddamn, if we could do advanced poses why the hell would we enroll in a beginners class?"
bestof,3dz37t,audiberry,8,Tue Jul 21 05:51:16 2015 UTC,"I second this sentiment.   I've had several yoga instructors guide us into a difficult pose and only after the struggle mention, ""if that's too hard, try it this easier way"". I have yet to meet a yoga instructor that wasn't teaching to their own ability but to the capability of the weakest student.   Also, I'm not so flexible and 6'4"", so don't you dare tell me to forward fold and touch my toes! It ain't happening."
bestof,3dz37t,twirlnumb,6,Tue Jul 21 07:27:58 2015 UTC,"Going to the wrong classes then---makes me kind of sad.  It doesn't sound like you'd be willing to try so this might be moot, but just in case... You need to check out the backgrounds of the teachers which no one ever does. Yoga instruction is not a regulated industry in any way and unfortunately there are a lot of 'yoga teachers' that did like a weekend or week-long certification. And there are many different styles of yoga that are more or less appropriate for different body states and people.  You'd be looking for someone with at least a decade of teaching experience, someone who teaches responsively---ie no set flows or routines---and probably someone who describes themself as teaching 'hatha' (kind of generic) yoga rather than a particular school. It would actually be a good sign if it was a 'multi-level' class or was somewhere that doesn't have levels at all.  I think levels are kind of a crutch for poor teachers and, in a way, poor students. In a class that is really well taught by an experienced teacher, the teacher responds to what the students are doing and teaches poses in a way that students work at their boundaries regardless of where the boundaries are. It's not really fair to say 'poor students' because that's also the fault of the teacher---a good teacher teaches you how to be a good student as well as teaching you yoga and how to get further regardless of what pose you're doing.  Source: I'm a teacher and teach people like you all the time. My teacher is phenomenal and routinely teaches both instructors like me and people just starting yoga in same classes."
bestof,3dz37t,urbanabydos,0,Tue Jul 21 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"How do you know you can do it if you don't try?  Being in a beginner class you probably don't know the different variations, so you keep doing the basic ones until you can transition to an advanced position.  When you can do that with ease then you can move on to a more difficult class"
bestof,3dz37t,Mystrick,5,Tue Jul 21 09:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yoga is a lot more fun, when your instructor is Diamond Dallas Page"
bestof,3dz37t,sovash,42,Tue Jul 21 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"Funny, but: How did he remember all these poses and how well he did them? Did he take notes? Also, sounds like he went to an intermediate or advanced class. Obviously not appropriate for someone who's never done yoga before. He didn't fuck up as much as his GF did by bringing him to this class since there's no such thing as fucking up in yoga. Yoga is non-competitive. You do the best you can and that's all that matters."
bestof,3dz37t,loves-reading,69,Tue Jul 21 00:56:38 2015 UTC,The class I usually go to is an all-levels class and we do pretty much everything he mentioned.
bestof,3dz37t,lawmedy,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"I've been doing yoga on and off for 15 years and things like plank and ""hog tie"" are not standard, and neither is a 75-minute class. The one difficult pose that I've found to be standard is down dog. Fifteen years and I still can't do it well."
bestof,3dz37t,loves-reading,32,Tue Jul 21 01:39:22 2015 UTC,"We do the hog tie but I have trouble with it, so I can see your point on that one. But plank? That's a basic PE class exercise."
bestof,3dz37t,lawmedy,-10,Tue Jul 21 01:44:59 2015 UTC,Yoga isn't PE class. Plank is strenuous. I've recently been doing two different classes on video and even the hard one that had crow pose (I didn't even bother trying it) hasn't done plank yet.
bestof,3dz37t,loves-reading,20,Tue Jul 21 01:48:28 2015 UTC,What style of yoga do you practice? That may be the discrepancy here. His sounded like a pretty standard all-levels Vinyasa class.
bestof,3dz37t,zjs,3,Tue Jul 21 02:36:18 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been doing this one that says it's Hatha, and this one that doesn't say."
bestof,3dz37t,loves-reading,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:22 2015 UTC,"Ah. Hatha is a pretty broad category, but classes/videos that describe themselves as Hatha (instead of something more specific) typically focus on postures and is typically fairly low intensity. That chair yoga site seems to have the same sort of vibe.  This is different from Vinyasa (and Ashtanga and others), which tend to strenuous. In Vinyasa, sequences involving moving from plank to chaturanga dandasana to upward facing dog to downward facing dog, holding each pose, are common, even in beginner classes. Even when I was practicing regularly, I'd usually leave class exhausted; a 75 minute class might have 30+ minutes of solid cardio."
bestof,3dz37t,zjs,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:52 2015 UTC,Yoga is as strenuous as you want it to be. Some poses can be absolutely killer- especially some of the balancing poses. But sometimes it is nice just to stretch.
bestof,3dz37t,arghyematey,9,Tue Jul 21 04:34:38 2015 UTC,"I've done all-levels classes as well which always include a lot of advanced poses.

This allows the beginners to participate and get a good workout while not leaving the advanced yogis bored."

It sounds like our instructor was better at emphasising that what he was describing was the aim. As you say, yoga is meant to be non-competitive and it's about doing the best that you can do.

Honestly, blaming a failure on COTS parts is a no-brainer for the most part.  However...  Where I worked, there were NO COTS parts ever.  I'd never have assumed that this was the failure point, because it's impossible (in my world).  Every single part was built and tested, onsite or at another site related to our site. Occasionally we'd order small parts from specialized aerospace manufacturers (think rivets, and even those were heavily tested by both parties), but never anything actually structural.  Now, this leaves me with 2 possibilities.  Either he knows nothing about aerospace and took a lucky guess (which is not supported by the terminology he used), or he was an actual insider there, knowing for a fact that there were COTS parts in that particular assembly (which general insiders like me probably wouldn't have guessed).  I'm obviously leaning heavily in one direction on it."
bestof,3dzqen,SaltySnack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:31 2015 UTC,Are they not using HACCP when testing these sorts of things? I thought the space industry was the origin of that control method. Seems so strange if they just pick a couple of the finished nuts/bolts and test those.

Or believe they are already equal and the scales are being unbalanced.  I'm sure the vast majority of these people do not lack empathy nor do they wish inequality on others, but #black #black #black makes them feel like black is coming to the foreground at the expense of themselves being in the background. It's extremely visible in attitudes to women/feminism too, some subreddits are little more than a monument to fear.  Semi-relevantly, certainly interestingly, I was sorting through a substantial stack of books for young children recently and the covers featuring people were keen on diversity to say the least.

It is much more likely that such matters simply haven't affected us personally, that's all. Most people live a life that feels like everyone else is a background character at best. Who ever really cares when the redshirt is killed off as long as Kirk is ok? As long as it isn't our brother, our friend, or even someone that lives on the same street, it doesn't affect us.  Then there are others that likely don't care much for propaganda, and think ""#blacklivesmatter"" is as flippant as ""all lives matter"", and thus the two are equal. A hashtag doesn't really bring a true call for action, so it's seen as juvenile SJW type stuff. It might say something true, but doesn't really accomplish much.   Maybe some people are afraid that other people groups will eventually ""take over"" (whatever that means), but most of us have family and close friends of various ethnicities at this point. I'd say a very small minority are acting out of fear. It's probably something simpler."

You don't need to be able to do the trade to know what it takes to be good at it, and in the end people who limit themselves only on experience in 'world issues' are getting a ridiculously small perspective on the matter.  For example, I am a white suburban young male who is invested in gaming (primarily), and I would never tell you that racism exists from my own experience alone. When someone black here is met with racism the offender is met with a great deal of hostility and hatred from many people - a majority (as the majority of these suburbs) are white. It's regarded as a 'rough neighbourhood' but racism nor sexism have ever been utilised or tolerated here.  I live in a suburb of Cardiff, which is in Wales. From what I can tell, it's quite different living in the U.S. and not just for reasons of racism or sexism. There seems to be a different inheritance of attitude (much stronger sense of patriotism, immense capitalist focus), and I can't even tell how accurate these are to the real thing - but I can tell that my world view hardly compensates for a huge variety of other areas.  So much so that I now regard this suburb ""as an exception""."

They're inventing racism where it doesn't exist, and constantly claiming that there is no problem of racism against black americans (look, all these stats justify police brutality!!). Racism isn't, ""how do you know what my life is like; you're white."" Racism is: ""I was forcefully taken out of my homeland, I was disenfranchised, I was segregated, I was bullied, I was killed by the police (who were acquitted), I was arrested for something my white neighbour did twice as much as me, and as a cherry on top, all these white people are telling me why none of this exists."""

I had previously only seen it used by people who were trying to dismiss the black lives matter movement as selfish, so it was pretty confusing.   A few weeks later, I went to a discussion on race relations in the city and I brought that up with the black attendees because I was curious, and one woman gave an amazing response. Paraphrased:  Everyone who says black lives matter OBVIOUSLY believes that all lives matter. And all lives DO matter. It's just that many black people feel like they're not included in that. They feel like their lives aren't given the same value as white lives, either through how they're incarcerated at higher rates or how people always immediately dismiss their deaths as caused by their own carelessness.  Black people have to say ""black lives matter"" because they don't feel like they're valued enough to be a part of the statement ""all lives matter"". But all lives do matter, and when black lives are treated with the same value, there will be no need to say it any other way."

It is implied that the father is directly in a position to do something about his sons lack of food.  But most people aren't in the position of father.  The person who says ""everyone should get their fair share"" is actually your sibling, whose food was placed on their plate by father.  This makes the statement ambiguous.  Depending on how it's spoken by your sibling, it could be interpreted by father as implying he should do something about it.  Or it could be interpreted as indifference.  Think about it (but not too hard).    My point is this: Metaphors are used for communicating an idea.  If a metaphor makes sense it does NOT mean the idea is logical or inherently right, it means that the metaphor itself is well constructed.  And in the above case, it doesn't take much to break the metaphor apart.  I think the default position for a lot of people is that if a metaphor sounds good then it must be right.

It would take forever to consciously weigh all the evidence to make a decision for everything you believe in; Instead, 99% of our beliefs are automatic, and are influenced by instinct, culture, upbringing etc. Then, once we do believe something, we tend to assume we have good reason to, even if we can't remember why we believe it.

So, if there is a disease (oppression) and symptoms of that disease (poverty, crime), we shouldn't blame the symptoms for the disease.  It's not that the lives lost to black on black crime don't matter, but that the objective of this particular movement is to draw attention to the fact that violence against blacks by the police (agents of the system, as it were) is a contributing to a much larger and more harmful issue of institutional racism.

Racism is actually supposed to be the broad term. Racism is the word for the systematic oppression of a group based on race, not just through the actions of individuals but through the structure of society, including historical and cultural phenomena. So it's not more broad than racism, it is racism, however it is more broad than what people often take the word ""racism"" to mean, which is merely a synonym for individual bigotry based on race. And this difference in understanding is responsible for a lot of disagreement over how much progress has been made in eliminating racism in America. People understand that it is generally socially unacceptable to say overtly racist things or hold opinions of white racial supremacy and think that the problem must be mostly fixed. But what progressive groups are actually fighting to end when they talk about ending racism is the systemic component."

Often it's people who've done nothing wrong, have no record,  and have no reason to be stopped other than that they fit the description. This happens every day in black communities. And we wonder why they feel so pushed aside by society.   But when someone gets shot, everyone goes out of their way to say it was the victim's fault. Freddie Grey was killed by criminal neglect over a personal dispute, and there were national news organizations pushing the talking point that he broke his own neck in the van. THAT'S what will never happen when it's a white victim. That's the kind of discussion white victims don't have to fight off. And that's why it's so important to push for justice and media coverage when a black person gets killed.

Actually, Blacks Do Care About Black Crime   Beyond the data, there’s the anecdotal evidence. And in short, it’s easy to find examples of marches and demonstrations against crime. In the last four years, blacks have held community protests against violence in Chicago; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Pittsburgh; Saginaw, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. Indeed, there’s a whole catalog of movies, albums, and sermons from a generation of directors, musicians, and religious leaders, each urging peace and order. You may not have noticed black protests against crime and violence, but that doesn’t mean they haven’t happened. Black Americans—like everyone else—are concerned with what happens in their communities, and at a certain point, pundits who insist otherwise are either lying or willfully ignorant.   Rev. Jesse Jackson Takes on Black-on-Black Violence   “Each year ... about 7,000 African-Americans are murdered, more than nine times out of 10 by other African-Americans,"" Jackson said in a statement ahead of a series of nationwide anti-gun violence marches planned for Saturday. ""If a foreign foe took these lives, we would mobilize armies and armadas to stop them. But here, because much of this violence is contained in racially concentrated neighborhoods, there is too much resignation and too little outrage.""   Do black leaders ignore black-on-black crime?   ""What about black-on-black violence?"" demanded Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum, who is white. ""Where is Al Sharpton on that? Where is the president on that?""  Funny you should ask. Sharpton made a publicized trip to Chicago in November to focus attention on the city's chronic violence. Last year, Michelle Obama attended the funeral of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old black honor student who was shot, allegedly by a black gang member.  The first lady later returned to Chicago to converse with students at a school that is nearly 100 percent African-American. ""In choosing Harper High School for the visit, the White House noted that 29 current or former students there had been shot in the last year, eight of them fatally,"" reported the Tribune.   Sharpton, Jackson, the Obamas. What names do you hear most often declaimed and criticized for ""dividing us"" and ""race baiting"" and ""ignoring black on black crime""?

I moved to the bay area (not socal, but with the drought it's close enough) 5 years ago from a place with real weather, and I've heard this 'the first rain is slicker because of dust / oil / shit' on the road and I've never experienced it.  If it is an effect it isn't worth talking about.  By far the most dangerous thing on rainy roads out here are the drivers.  In addition to what the linked commenter has said, I've noticed that some drivers have a tendency to make sudden sharp changes.  They will slam on the brakes, accelerate hard, and take corners too fast.  They don't seem to do it because they are aggressive drivers, that's just how they drive and they've never had icy roads to teach them better.  That's dangerous driving in general, not just on wet roads.  The only thing about the actual roads that I've noticed that's more dangerous than roads in the midwest are the puddles.  For whatever reason, roads (even interstates) don't have proper drainage and I've run into some rather nasty puddles that have caught me by surprise.    Under normal driving conditions wet roads have plenty of traction to keep the car going where you want.  The main dangers with driving in the rain are limited visibility and hydroplaning.  So, don't outrun your headlights (your headlights are on right?) and don't go so fast that your car literally lifts off the road.  The slowest I've ever experience hydroplaning is 70mph.  Really, it's not that hard.  After spending a decade learning to drive on snow covered ice I really have a hard time understanding how people out here can't handle a little rain."

Only after it can you find things worth devoting yourself towards.   It never made sense to me how the philosopher with the seminal concept of the Übermensch is still somehow branded a Nihilist.

He wrote about it most importantly as an alternative to the Void, and he did eventually rejected nihilism. However, his writing is still some of the most influential to nihilism. Even though he isn't a nihilist, for the sake of the song, it's good enough. And it has the same phonetic end sound (I'm sure there's a word for that) as ""happy"", which works out nicely."

American (or whatever country you live in) Sign Language is not a world wide language for deaf people. There are some things some words or ideas have in common, the same as Auto and auto have in German and English, but generally speaking, knowing one language does not mean you'll know another.

I've been there and know you will burn bridges trying to supply your habit other than than trying to provide for it.  This isn't best of, this is just sad.  edit - a word"
bestof,3dsp33,GeneralBS,4,Sun Jul 19 08:43:39 2015 UTC,"Not saying benzoaddict has depression, as I know nothing about him or his intentions. That being said, you guys obviously have no idea what it is like to have depression, and as someone battling with depression I can tell you something much simpler than not being able to go to college can send you in a downward spiral and put you in a really dark place."
bestof,3dsp33,Courierr_6,23,Sun Jul 19 12:52:01 2015 UTC,As someone who did struggle with depression for a long time I can tell you that while being in a dark place sucks. But coddling someone with depression does more harm than good.   This guy is making excuses which is the opposite of what someone with depression needs to do.  He says he can't afford college and that with financial aid it would take too long so it isn't worth it.    Yet he has a benzo addiction and says he is using money he has saved to go on vacation.  This is a guy that wants hand outs.  He bitches that he can't afford to live and that its too hard yet he is spending his money on bullshit.    He doesn't need coddling. He need a kick in the ass and to grow up and take responsibility.   Life isn't supposed to be easy but he is looking for an easy out and he doesn't deserve sympathy.
bestof,3dsp33,HaydenSI,7,Sun Jul 19 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"Telling someone with depression to ""grow up"" is a good idea, and they don't deserve sympathy? Not buying it. Obviously I'm not saying anybody should enable his addiction by giving him money, but the whole ""tough love"" schtick with depression just doesn't work.  As someone who was also depressed for a long time, that is the exact opposite way I would deal with anyone with depression. Part of what made me feel so terrible was the feeling that I did need to just grow up and take responsibility, that I was feeling bad about trivial shit that I could easily get over and I was just pathetic for not being able to do it. If everybody else jumped in telling me the same I'd have ended up far worse."
bestof,3dsp33,Fireach,5,Sun Jul 19 15:16:48 2015 UTC,Let me clear it up a little.   Coddling someone who doesn't WANT to help themselves is a bad idea.  It reinforces the idea that they can stay down and don't have to change.  People that do not want to help themselves do not need sympathy.    There are differences in people who are depressed and want to help themselves but do not know how and people who are depressed and want to stay down and be told everything is okay while expecting handouts.

It has helped me become who I always wanted to be. It didnt change who I am, but it stabilized my mood so that now I feel like I am in control of my personality.   I spent the longest time resisting because I didn't want a drug to change who I was, but in the end it has been one of the best decisions I've made.

I am better in social situations, I actually got myself to ask out a complete stranger the other day which I have never been able to do because of social anxiety.

For me, it's more about being on a drug for the rest of my life, and the fact that if I stop taking them or can't get ahold of them I would be more depressed and lower than I have ever been before. I know someone who developed postpartum depression after her 2nd child and has been on a couple different SSRIs since, mostly lexapro until recently. When she tried to ween off of them, she had a nightmarish experience and told me she would have killed herself if she continued on that path of not taking them.

The fact that you have enough money on hand to go on any sort of vacation means you have way more money than I ever had on hand in college. I was paycheck to paycheck, robbing Peter to pay Paul.

The only things that seem to help is going out and being active but I had no desire to do anything more than sit in and watch netflix and anime.    I barely wanted to go to my obligations but it's the only thing that really pulls you along.  Having a pet to take care of or a garden definitely seems to help but only if you are successful.  The previous times I tried growing a garden and the plants died, well it at least didn't make things worse.  So the working hard and networking is tough when depression is nagging you."

He would beat me with a belt and a switch, do you know what a switch is? A long thin stick that makes the most horrible of noises when you swing it through the air with all your might.  It left me with real scars on my buttocks and upper thighs(he did it in places that were hard to spot), so when I was around 9 I started stealing some of my dads booze, this quickly developed to severe drug addiction by the time I was 15 I was doing coke. I actually started stealing from friends which made me feel like shit since they were the only people there for me cause my family sure as hell wasn't, I eventually alienated all my friends by 18, I am now 19 years old and still have a coke addiction and I am an alcoholic I did graduate highschool(somehow) but with very shitty grades.

bestof,3dsp33,jacls0608,3,Sun Jul 19 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"SGDQ is an event for charity though, so he's kind of helping the event that would result in charity money."
bestof,3dsp33,Maxentium,3,Sun Jul 19 18:15:59 2015 UTC,Thats probably why he doesnt go around donating to people wanting to go to Japan for vacation
bestof,3dsp33,PandaStyle00,9,Sun Jul 19 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"Is he a billionaire? I want to know that, this is a very crucial information for me."

bestof,3dsp33,hiyosilver64,3,Sun Jul 19 12:27:58 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a typo. I thought the top comment was going to be joking about it. I had no idea Notch was so insanely rich. I remember what feels like not that long ago, reading something about how he was worth tens of millions. It shouldn't be that surprising that he's a billionaire now but for some reason I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around it. Damn."
bestof,3dsp33,hegemonistic,6,Sun Jul 19 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Minecraft was sold to Microsoft for $2.5B and Notch owned 70% of Mojang, so became a billionaire overnight."
bestof,3dsp33,Krohnos,2,Sun Jul 19 15:21:36 2015 UTC,Plus he had all the money from game sales already
bestof,3dsp33,PandaStyle00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"According to wikipedia, Notch's net worth is $1.5B"
bestof,3dsp33,Shikogo,4,Sun Jul 19 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who takes benzos for horrific anxiety, those things are no joke. When a pill can make you feel like a regular person, you get hooked.  Nothing was more depressing than quitting them because I had a tolerance and feeling like I was trapped within my own brain."
bestof,3dsp33,The_Music,4,Sun Jul 19 15:51:35 2015 UTC,This is best of to me because giving money to an addict is like throwing sand into the ocean. It's a very good lesson for all of us! (Most of all sober sucker me.)
bestof,3dsp33,LB-426,6,Sun Jul 19 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"That hits at home. As someone who is addicted to benzos (one of my last addictions, finally), I can really connect to everything notch said. I'm glad to see people helping people, addiction is no joke"
bestof,3dsp33,DeepFriedPlacenta,2,Sun Jul 19 09:00:00 2015 UTC,"As a side note, I just noticed Notch now writes in /r/VeryExpensive. Not really relevant, but found it a funny side note."
bestof,3dsp33,TDuncker,2,Sun Jul 19 10:26:05 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest lesson to learn here is that you shouldn't be seeking solace from the internet. If you have emotional, lifestyle, or social ""problems"" (who knows if this guy is looking for handout or not?), then the internet is not the place for it. It's nice to feel like there is a community on reddit, but in reality we are a group of strangers, and you can't rely on us for the hard parts of life, because there isn't always a correct answer in those situations. We can't drop a bunch of money on you for there to be some risk of it all being a scam or feeding some harmful habit. Spend your time building meaningful relationships out in the world, not on the pseudo relationships we have here online."
bestof,3dsp33,squeezyphresh,2,Sun Jul 19 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"someone with the name ""BenzoAddict"" shouldn't get handouts from rich people just on principle."
bestof,3dvguv,rightcross,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"Nice find, and I got to say that this sub can use a healthy portion of good none aggressive rhetorics in contrast to the massive info dumps that are usually found here (even though the latter are if course also fantastic)."
bestof,3dz3qb,SilkSk1,8,Mon Jul 20 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't know what it meant. I took a guess, and it was right. But nothing in that thread made it clear.  For anyone else clueless like me finding themselves here: Masturbating. It means masturbating."
bestof,3dz3qb,EatATaco,6,Mon Jul 20 18:32:29 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I was trying to decide if I cared about brony culture enough to look it up.
bestof,3dz3qb,GarthVolbeck,5,Mon Jul 20 18:39:58 2015 UTC,No problem. No reason for more than one of us to waste our time looking up another euphemism for masturbating.
bestof,3dz3qb,EatATaco,5,Mon Jul 20 18:42:54 2015 UTC,I figured if you had to guess you'll guess right.

bestof,3dxwnk,sn0r,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:05 2015 UTC,"This was the only comment I could find for that user.  I wouldn't consider this bestof material, more along the lines of a shitpost.  https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/3dxbvh/food_entering_the_stomach/ct9lut7"

bestof,3dsq6d,respawn_in_5_4_3_2_1,10,Sun Jul 19 05:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but as it progresses, you realize that he has remarkable breath control."
