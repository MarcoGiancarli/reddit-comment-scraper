From today's followup article:   ""In [the] light of today‚Äôs development, we have initiated the process of refund to our client, DD Kisan for the amount collected for Mr. Bachchan‚Äôs celebrity endorsement. which was pending payment to him on signing of the contract terms.""   The sum had been agreed upon and partly paid, clearly.   Here's my theory: Amitabh Bachchan is maintaining plausible deniability here by shifting all the blame to Lintas. Lintas is/will claim that they were looking at it as 'just another deal' until Mr. Bachchan made it specifically clear that this was supposed to be pro-bono work.  This #Presstitutes tag/movement was aimed at discrediting the media with a straightforward MO: politicians would feed the media all kinds of bullshit and then cry foul/slander/libel. Solution?

Scratch that, even whores are better than Indian media, especially the english one.  Also you conveniently forgot to mention this line   This implies, Mr. Bachchan took a decision not to charge following the disclosures made in The Hindu.   This is not reporting , this is the opinion of the writer. Is the Hindu privy to the internal communications between AB and his staffs. Do they (The Hindu) for certain know / have proof of such aforementioned conversation that proves the implication ?   If not, than AB is not a party to the monetary transaction since he has received nothing, nor does it prove the intent of his firm to charge for his services and neither does it prove that the reporting of Hindu, has influenced his decision about the matter at hand.  The chain of events is not even circumstantial evidence to prove that The Hindu has influenced anything. And it's matter of fact way to observe that it influenced AB to not take any money, is a overly simplistic at best and a lie at worst.  Also The Hindu's initial report that money was paid to ABs , when in fact it wasn't, is a case of misreporting at best and libel at worst. This leaves the ground open for AB to sue The Hindu for libel.  So, the thing is Hindu is nothing but a part of the lying whore media."

Once, I watched a few consecutive episodes of 'Satyameva Jayate', each one of them could unfailingly be classified as an brazenly tendentious Hindu-bashing orgy, and the impression I got from Aamir's attitude was that he is gradually becoming more and more judgemental, in a grotesquely hinduphobic and moralistic sort of a way, with his growing fame.

indianews,3du9mn,duracharl,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"It can help reduce communal violence and crimes against women, as attacking people becomes far more risky when they (or their community) are armed.   That said guns are expensive, and many of the Indians in most need of self-defense can scarcely afford one. I am reminded of this quote:   And though I have no doubt exceptions can be brought forward, I think the following rule would be found to be generally true that ages in which the dominant weapon is expensive or difficult to make will be ages of despotism, whereas when the dominant weapon is cheap and simple, the common people have a chance. Thus, for example, tanks, battleships and bombing planes are inherently tyrannical weapons, while rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently democratic weapons. A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple weapon --so long as there is no answer to it-- gives claws to the weak.   George Orwell    as well as this one by Gandhi:   Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest.   Edit: Typo"

Owning guns do not stop or lessen the number of attacks on women in USA. I do not know why the media is bent on portraying India as a nation of rapists. Even if we double or triple the number of rapes in India the percentage is still lower than western nations.  And as for communal violence, it is not simple to stop by just giving guns to people nor will it lessen such incidences. The root lies in our history and foreigner will have  great difficulty in understanding it.  My question was about how it would have affected our near history, politics , society and law enforcement. But now that I know you are a foreigner, please ignore it."

indianews,3du9mn,W_Edwards_Deming,5,Sun Jul 19 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"I dunno, honestly, with regards to the gun debate that is. I lived in the Texas for a few months and there are about as gun-toting as an American can be. So, I had a good chance of understanding their perspective.  Before going there, however, I was against guns. Even now, I am against guns. But not because the citizen has the right to protect themselves but because more guns increase the chances of things going wrong, in general. Guns can help protect people, but it is a tool of destruction and can be used as such. More guns simply increases the probability of this happening. So, that's the anti-gun side of the issue.   Buuut, seeing as guns are already out there in the US, it almost makes sense to own a gun, seeing as anyone who attacks you is likely to own one, you might stand a chance if you own one as well. Sure, it's scary to own one. (And it is, I went to firing range down in Texas and we fired guns and I was scared, its fucking scary that something which can kill people is so easily accessible.) It's the US, those things are out there, if you wanna be safe, own a gun. You can be safe without owning one too. It's not a compulsion, its just something to have in areas which are a little more unfriendly.   TL;DR I have seen both points of view and I can completely understand Americans owning guns, however, that has been the law from the beginning and now its hard to change that. In India, it'd be stupid to allow guns because Muslims will literally start killing Hindus and vice versa."

Can't you see the preventative aspect? There are always weapons people can kill with, and of course criminals can illegally have guns. Nations with the highest murder rates tend to restrict guns (such as much of Africa and South & Central America). Nations with the most guns (USA, Serbia, Finland, Switzerland) per person do not tend to have the most murder."
indianews,3du9mn,W_Edwards_Deming,4,Sun Jul 19 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"I do see the preventative aspect. That's why I said, it works in a nation like the US where you have guns from the beginning. In India, if this were implemented, the poorest will be shot more often. Muslims will shoot Hindus more often and vice versa. I am extremely worried about that particular part because Saudis have significant influence over the madarasas of India and they have been trying to increase Wahhabism in the subcontinent for some time now. If you do not know Wahhabism is a form of Islam which IS and Al-Qaeda have drawn inspiration from. It's a strict form of Islam which degrades all non-Muslims to second-class citizens and supports the idea of Jihad until you, the Muslim minority, has control over the nation and have established Sharia law in the nation. Putting more guns in that arena will only give us more 26/11-esque tragedies and increased radicalisation of the Islamic people in the country. It's a recipe for disaster in terms of internal peace. As I said, I see the benefits, I really do, but I don't want the Muslims to even have the chance of taking over the nation because they will kill/convert all my people to their disgraceful form of Islam which will destroy all the things which made India once the shining jewel of world and my people will become a memory. No, for the preservation of peace and security of my people, guns should not be made legal in the peaceful land of Bharatvarsha. But, I understand your sentiment entirely."
indianews,3du9mn,ameya2693,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"the poorest will be shot more often   That was my worry as well, if you notice above.   Economics vulnerabilities aside, I think that were legal arms available the huge number of Hindu (Sikh and other non-muslim) Indians would prevent such a coup, and perhaps even have a more effective response to terrorist attacks. At least in my country legally armed citizens have been able to stop mass shootings.  I agree with you about the dangers of Saudi money (and Pakistan next door) and wish my country were less a part of that problem (arming and funding both of those countries as well as other evil-doers in the Muslim world). India ought to be the obvious ally in that region, resting between China and Pakistan as it does, protected by mountains and maintaining a free and pluralistic society."

Neither answer is 'wrong'. I think we need to find out which one is more correct for India. Right now, I see weapons not being used by Hindus as we are a peaceful people, but I can see them being used Muslims who are on the fence when it comes to violence. They can become militant about many things and given the power to do so, they will try and take more rights for themselves. The majority Hindus will lap up the Religion of Peace argument and people like me will be shouted down and called saffronist or anti-secularism and then, when its too late the same people may realise what we are trying to say.   It can also lead to Hindus actually owning and protecting weapons, though, I cannot see it happening currently."

indianews,3dtrfx,le_clochard,4,Sun Jul 19 11:21:14 2015 UTC,"i have written comments about this matter on reddit itself, primarily, because reddit is the only forum where I spend whatever little time I get for indulging in my idiosyncrasies.  I am not much educated like Mr. Srinivasan or most people here, but I can discern patterns in media, government, people, business, organisations, information etc. and I was trained for that.  This demonising of hard science was always there, but it wasn't open in the media. What was open was derision of capital and glorification of poverty. I can cite umpteen examples from bollywood and hindi poems. This was well and fine, the unwashed masses like us and our parents had one single goal, to live a life of dignity and move up in live by the virtue of a good education, which normally meant something to do with hard sciences.  Hard sciences were the ticket to a good life, You get selected for engineering and medical you are set for life. Failing that, you have the option of turning to commerce stream and get a CA certificate. The rest, opted for humanities, not by choice but due to lack of it.  Liberalisation came bringing with it big changes in how we live and consume products and news. The average Indian started wanting more, glorification of poverty was not fashionable any more. I started noticing articles about how this consumption culture is going to destroy our ""heritage"", ""history"", way of life.  I even saw articles, deriding the nouvea rich and their accents, how they call the Maruti , ""mruti"" how the aunties were trying to move up by trying to push their fat asses into new Levis jeans etc.  This was the starting backlash against the Indians who had started moving up. Next came the articles describing how the rat race of children and parents towards engineering and medical colleges are going to destroy India, by creating an army of unsociable drones who do not appreciate finer things.  Than came articles about how there is a discrimination against students of humanities and how they are treated with disdain and why India should concentrate on humanities, if it wants to be a world leader.  The Vajpayee era rolled in and the worms started crawling out of the wood work and I started noticing articles even on the weekdays deriding science and glorifying arts.  During 1995 or 1996 NCERT was breached some more and suddenly a subject called Environmental Sciences was introduced, and the students had to appear for an exam on theis subject during the pre boards. This was the first shot in a long campaign that still continues.  After the Vajpayee govt. fell, the CBSE curriculum was drastically changed, NCERT moved it's focus away from math and science. Children right from class 1 are now taught Environmental Science instead of science and social studies.   In central school science starts in class 6, and even that very very elementary. The condition of math is worse. Till class 5, students are taught only addition, subtraction, multiplication and divisions and few other artithmetic stuff. The algebra is gone, the geometry is gone.   No more teaching of history or the country, it starts in class 8 and even that, very elementary.  These liberal, seculars have been successfull in what they wanted to do, breach the very foundation of education to create more drones like them. Hard science, gives you the critical tools of thought to test everything and they didn't liked it one bit.  Sadly, they have won. Luckily, we can rely on private schools which arenot completely following NCERT, and are teaching algebra to class 5 kids, just like what we learnt when we were in class 5 during the early eighties or even early nineties.  PS: There are many reasons, why the liberal seculars do not like science, the author gave some reasons, but there are some more too."

I will credit P.V.Narasimha Rao for the liberalization of the Indian economy. Shat Shat Naman to him. CBSE syllabus sucks. At least when I studied. It was a pattern during my time to switch to the state syllabus after 10th if a person wanted to crack the Engineering or Medical entrance exams. That was an era when an engineer with a computer science background was considered to be god. Nowadays... Call it a conspiracy theory or whatever but there has been a sustained attempt to denigrate our country economically/socially/culturally etc over the centuries. In fact this has has been so successful that you only need to glance at our neighbouring sub to see how the Macaulay daughters/sons take pride on shitting upon themselves. The disdain upon humanities is a joke. For example, how many people can explain why ""Ode to Autumn"" (by Keats) is considered to be the perfect poem in terms of structure/grammar ? (I am sticking to this bastardized tongue and not even trying to mention any of our great languages)   TL;DR:- Macaulay sons & daughters your time is up. Go fuck yourselves.

They have lost hope of winning in any other state and even Punjab looks to be going down. They will continue this chutiyAAP until 2019 election and Kejru will project himself the secular saviour to fight LokSabha election.  tl;dr : There's no cure once you go full Kejru.

indianews,3dmhmk,duracharl,4,Fri Jul 17 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, after a brief glance I can summarize that the stories behind the temple(s) can be found in various Puranas. I am not a scholar to authenticate any of them.  The Kamakhya temple is a Shakti Peetham. I recently visited 3 of them over the last 2 months but I was not fortunate enough to pray here. Probably our dada /u/duracharl can tell us more about this as he is from there.  About rituals all of them are defined in the Agama Shastra. These differ from place to place. For example the way Rudra Namakam Chamakam is chanted in Kasi very different from the way it is chanted in the south. They follow the Sama veda method whereas we follow the Rig Veda method.  The same it is with taboos. What might be sacrosanct in one place can be considered a sin in another.  A story which I narrated before:-  There was a merchant during ancient times who believed propitiating lord Shiva made him successful. Everyday he would perform Abhishekam to the lord. A mischievous cat which he raised would sneak up during the puja and drink the Abhishekam milk/curd.  To prevent this, he would wait until the cat came crawling and then overturn a basket over it. After the puja he would feed it the milk anyway :-)  On his deathbed, he asked his son to continue the tradition of daily Abhishekam. (of course the cat was dead now). Anyway the son thought he should perform the ritual in a more grander manner than his father. He had a golden cat and a golden basket made.   He would perform the puja with the golden basket over the golden cat as he thought this was the way it was to be done.    Many of the rituals we perform everyday have been corrupted over the time. So is the case with taboos or beliefs about mensuration. Please give some time to ask around. I promise to make a post on this separately."

Two of them are in pakiland.  Most temples in east India devoted to any female deity close during Ambubachi. Yes there is a huge mela outside Maa Kamakhya mandir, but that they are not dancing or celebrating. They are plainly praying and come to witness the sadhus doing their thing.  The largest crowd happens after the mandir reopens and people come to pray and take any part of the sacred cloth etc."

I have no problems with that, your belief as long as you dont rope me into it but they became a close knit judgemental clan following whatever their local leader had drilled into their head. to the point of almost kicking out hteir wives because they ( the wives) were negtive energy to their postive energy and so on and so forth. Also the whole free thinking and thinking for yourself  was abandoned the moment their guru stepped in and his word was the absolute, morally and practically. this led to a fair bit of commotion and things went into a downward spiral.  So yeah, after this whole shebang the wives moved out and it took a near death scenario to one of the wives for those pricks to realise that family is foremost and they are not there to hold back their potential and yadda yadda.  TLDR : Cult mentality leads to serious issues.  Also , i refuse in my personal capacity to follow and guru or and sant or saadhu blindly. I am agnostic and will say the occasional aditya hrudaya and hanuma chalisa, but thats because it makes me feel good, not because some flying creature told me so. I take the rational meanings behind stuff but dont take them as absolute, change is imperative which the cultists seem to ignore."

Crux- Sea doesnt matter, a small drop makes a different. <-- One can understand only when perception changes.  But yes every now and then it'll put u in a test and thats where a true character will come out.  Bottom line i thought its difficult to bring a change outside in the society on your own. Inside too is not really that easy but still its better option and somewhat achievable. ""Small goals...Small drops"" Keep in mind  I thought if somehow a culture of such discussions would develop in every single hindu household, it can bring a change or it might.   Dont know if its joint or nuclear but somewhat families are interconnected through internet these days so now a days it doesnt take much to through in some worth knowing or worth learning or worth thinking about subjects online.  I use it on my social media, where rest are posting their pics im using it as feedly for my family and friends to get the daily bits with my thoughts and here n there i get a response and hey in no time im getting fair bit of support. that means ppl are thinking its becoming a part of discussion yesss i know facebook.. i know its a shithole but its what u make of it.   Another idea well u wont be able to change the old ones.. Pakki mitti ka ghada expression... or it'll be difficult to change them but the youth would definitely be interested and yes surely there will be some who wouldnt be but do remember youth follows where there is a following. As soon as they realise its catching they join. Tried and tested formula.   Another one If in each family there is 1 Modi, Jackpot!!  The fusion of these little bits i believe can bring about a change if 1 guys starts making a little effort with passion and relentless effort. Small drops yess and yess they will laugh and that right there is your true test. back away or take it head on!!  I dont know i focussed on my young couzins. little ones and basically everyone young.

Entitled ""The Rashtrapati,"" the piece scathingly criticized Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.  While the author acknowledged Nehru's innate drive and initiative, he also alluded to the prime minister's undeniable autocratic streak. He urged the Indian electorate to exercise caution, lest Nehru turn into a despot. Indeed, electing this man for a third consecutive term, the article warned, would fan his ego and endanger Indian society, saying that his character was marked by ""intolerance of others and a certain contempt for the weak and inefficient"". The author, who signed himself ""Chanakya"", added that Nehru's conceit was ""already formidable"", and worried that soon ""Jawaharlal might fancy himself as a Caesar"". The author of this article was Nehru himself under a pseudonym of Chanakya. This publication is a significantly important example of auto critique.   TL;DR: Ranjan is Kejriwal"

indianews,3dhhle,5-26AM,2,Thu Jul 16 08:51:09 2015 UTC,"Whatever be the Congress history with these folks, Modi can make amends and earn a lot of goodwill by acting on this case: http://sikhsiyasat.net/2014/11/24/convicted-under-tada-aged-sikhs-prisoners-languishing-in-indian-jails/   But the cases registered before the lapse of TADA were saved. One such case related to Ludhaina Bank robbery of 1986 stood on trial for 22 years. Decision in this case arrived on November 20, 2012. The designated TADA court convicted ten Sikhs to 10 years imprisonment each. Majority of these Sikhs were convicted under TADA after reading provisions of TADA with section 120B of the Indian penal code.  These aged Sikh convicts were accused of handling the robbed money but the judge invoked section 120B of Indian Penal Code pertaining to ‚Äòcriminal conspiracy‚Äô to convict them for the primary act of robbery itself and granted them harsher punishments under TADA.  An appeal was moved before the Supreme Court of India against the decision of designated TADA court in 2012. But the appeal still lays pending in the apex Indian court while the aged Sikh prisoners are languishing in various jails.  Bapu Assa Singh, aged over 94 years, is the only person in this case who recently got bail from the Supreme Court of India on health grounds.  S. Maan Singh, aged 70, of Dholewal (Ludhaina) is a heart patient. He has under gone heart bypass surgery and is jailed in Central Jail in Ludhaina.  Avtar Singh, aged 76, of village Kurali near Jalandhar is undergoing the sentence at Kapurthala Jail. Mohan Singh, 72, of Pattar Kalan (Jalandhar); Harbhajan Singh, 84, of Sharihn; Saroop Singh, 66, of Bisrampur (Jalandhar); Balwinder Singh, 62, of Village Tahli (Jalandhar) and Sewa Singh, 73, of Chak Raju Singh (Hoshiarpur) are also confined in Kapurthala Jail.  Gurjant Singh, aged 72, is imprisoned at Maximum Security Jail, Nabha. He hails from Kothe Jang Road near Jagraon.  Harinder Singh, 55, is youngest among all persons convicted in this case. He is a resident of Lalton Kalan (Ludhiana) and is currently undergoing the sentence in Maximum Security Jail in Nabha.  These persons have a ‚ÄòPanthic‚Äô background and many of them served jails during ‚ÄòDharam Youth Morcha‚Äô started by the Shiromani Akali Dal and Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Some had relations with Taksali Akali leaders of their area, but the Punjab government led by Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) did not pay has attention to the plight of these prisoners.   I intentionally left in the last para: their political past is not a secret and any goodwill shown now will ensure that their future politics will be pro-stability."

Since the politicos have no immediate requirement for the cash, and their only goal is to convert it to white, they can hold on to their inventory for long amounts of time, thereby preventing the prices from coming down. Secondly, builders also take loans to make the construction on the land. However, when they are also made to hold for longer durations of time and are unable to make their loan repayments, the politicians get the builders another loan to pay off the first loan, and so on. Due to this vicious cycle, the real estate bubble continues to inflate artificially.  If the general public collectively decides to hold off real estate investments for a couple of years, real estate will stop being an attractive venture for black money holders; and this can eventually lead to a drop in prices."

indianews,3df19e,soonwar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Cannabis is a family of plant, weed and marijuana are its slang names. Weed,ganja or marijuana is basically dried leaves of cannabis leaves and flower. Mostly top leaves of the plant are most apt as they have less moisture content compared to others. These are smoked in chillum or cigarette etc.  Bhaang on the other hand is the leaves and seeds of cannabis grinded together. It is wet in nature and can be consumed with lassi or thandai. Unlike marijuana it can't be consumed directly with or in cigarette as it is wet and takes time to burn. Use it in hookah or chillum, its effect is slow compared to dry marijuana.  There are govt. shops who sell bhaang biscuits, thandai, lassi, cake or simple bhaang balls."

Non-Manipuri owning land, migrant workers and tenant issues. Now this is a contentious issue as other states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have restricted areas too where non-residents can't own land . In Uttarakhand there's a limit of 250sqmt after which you have to take permissions from the state govt.   There are many reasons for this like ecological, prevention of ethnic and linguistic minority's rights and security of state as these states share border with other countries especially china. Obviously the Manipur law is harsher and even restricts tenants and migrant workers. We do need some laws to protect the 'real' minorities of this country but have to be pragmatic about it. Like uttarakhand government after making a law where no outsider could buy agriculture land started making small towns in rural areas where everybody from around India could buy land upto 250sqmt. These have not only increased revenue of state but helped locals get employment as well."
indianews,3dcglg,soonwar,3,Wed Jul 15 05:54:01 2015 UTC,"I think the issues are manifold. The inherent xenophobia is the most disturbing to me, personally. I had a picture of a utopic, idyllic countryside when I thought of Manipur, but now it just seems like a cold place I will get abused at for being a ""mainland"" Indian.  Take this article for example:  http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.Inner_Line_Permit_ILP_Demand.ILP_whose_line_is_it_anyway_By_Jiten_Konthoujam   Yaoshang festival will fade to blues. Instead the Biharis' ""Bol Bam"" trance will slap the society. Many politicians will then be more than happy, busy baiting easy prey and trapping migrants for their vote banks. Political denial and manipulation of facts is what irritates people the most.   The ""mithibong mitambal"" (coward) Manipuri phrase coined by our forefathers, is not a cheap title given to every Tom, Dick and Harry.   How is this not xenophobia?   A good number of Sikhs and Jain families have lived and become part and parcel of Manipur for years. There have not been any low profile mischievous cases registered against these communities. They have maintained their own dignity and contribution to the society, though some were bitter. But things are changing. Many of the descendants of the first generation Marwaris and Punjabis who have settled in Manipur during the 1940's and 50's, have now left Manipur for good. They seem to have had enough. But for the khaini and pan chewing breed of migrants, the 1970's was just the beginning of the massive streaming to Manipur. Manipuris have always accepted and lived with the outsiders, for ages. But now, why this uproar- Enough is enough.    Emphasis added to highlight the hate.  Now I for one always loved the sight of North Easterners in ""mainland"" cities, getting an education, jobs, finding meaningful existence and reinforcing the idea of India's diversity from just linguistic variety to racial plurality. But in turn if they close up their lands, if they look down upon the rest of us, the lack of reciprocation tastes bitter.   Even so I hold that the people who come to the cities for studies and jobs probably don't hold the same opinion as the purists back home. It just makes it harder for me to imagine going to Manipur for a piece of that misty hillside and feeling one with the land and people."

But you can't dismiss the issue of ethnic and linguistic minorities here and the ecological and security issues. That's why I said you have to be pragmatic on these issues but Manipur is being like you said, xenophobic.   This isn't the only issue though, you can see it in their outright ban on Hindi Films and Television and Hindi songs."

He highlighted the contradiction of presenting the historical facts as fiction in certain Tv drama series by Ekta kapoor and all is done to get whatever TRP or Political correctnes viz a vis reason as the Tv show itself Highlights in the Initials with message ""This Historical Drama has nothing to do with facts and are all fiction etc etc blah blah dont want to hurt any community so chill and enjoy Bullshit"" <-- basically u can check that in that Jodha Akbar Tv series  Ahh yea pretty much thats it.

indianews,3d4dul,apunebolatumerilaila,3,Mon Jul 13 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"look dude not to brag. some advice if you dont find it preachy:    I'm 30 happily married now. Even when I was single I rarely watched porn. It was obvious that it was not real.Neither was I ever attracted to fake boobs or makeup loaded chics. But most of my friends were into all of these things. They found it ""attractive/horny/hot"". What this did was filled their minds with unrealistic nonsense.    Now most are married. But are always whining about their ""sex life"" and most can hardly last 10 min on top of their wives. Idiots are still after some fake BS nonsense instead of the real thing. Dont be like them. Trying loving a person for their values/qualities. Sex with person you love is AMAZING and with one you hooked up for physical lust is SHIT. I had a few of the later ones when I was single. And that too with knockoff chics not some timepass chicks. But making love to someone you love from the bottom of the heart is bliss and none of that porn shit comes into play then.  Infact the porn will looks like yuck.    You should watch Don Jon"

You are a comrade You are a NRI who has met some pakis abroad or work with them You are a grown up who have never given such things a thought and study and have formed your opinion from Aman ka Tamasha run by the tv channels.   In any case, you would have had hardly enough time to know the beast that are the paki kaum. The thing is this kind of stats are distilled from studies and are not declassified. Any way census in pakiland is a joke and even their educated people know that.  People like me whose job it is to study such stuff, know what we are talking about. Hell I can prove it to you using circumstantial evidence. Take for example    UK, they are having problems with 2nd, 3rd generation brit born pakis. Jamat Ud Dawa does a rally and 1 million people attend. Agenda of the rally, ghazwa e hind and killing of all hindus in India. The 1 million people were not politicians, elites or media, they were the common abduls. Organisations like Jamat Ud Dawa have grass root level support in almost every town, village of pakistan. So much, that even the establishment is afraid of them. Salman Taseer gets killed by his body guard. Even government lawyers do not want to prosecute him. Aren't lawyers part of the common educated people. Police refuse to provide protection to any people who want to become witness against him. Why? because Salman Taseer was a blasphemer. It is a open season on Hindus, Sikhs and Christians in Pakiland. It is not the establishement which is doing it, it is the common abdul who is doing it and the government there turns a blind eye. There weapons are named after arabic and central asian invaders. They think themselves to be descendents of arabs and central asians and have nothing to do with the sub continent. There history books state that pakistan started with Mohammed Bin Quasim. They have a official policy of 1 Momim = 10 Hindu kafirs, somehow the entire nation believes it.   I can go on and on, but you can try searching for easily accesible videos of people like Hassan Nissar, Najam Sethi etc to see the actual present state of mind of the comon abdul there."

In short, ""do qawmi nazariya"" is true. In short, Hindus would ""oppress"" Muslims when Hindus are in majority. In short, Pakistani Muslims (or even so-called ""atheist Muslims"") hate Hindus. Thus, the liberalest of liberals believes in the bigoted ""do qawmi nazariya"", or MAYBE they don't believe in it, and are pussies that they can't say it openly on the fear of being assraped by ""Pakistani"" establishment."

They lie to themselves.  The do qaumi nazariya got fucked in 1971. Now it is a Tin Qaumi nazariya. If religion is the sole binding factor of muslims from this sub continent they would have been one nation and not three.  Don't make me go into what Liyaqat Ali Khan and his cohorts of chutiyas did to the other chutia Suhrawardy , which laid the foundation for the break up of pakiland into two.

He was the elected provisional prime minister of Bengal province and led the clarion call for partition of India.  This motherfucker was helped by the Hindu dalit lobby of bengal. And they got fucked for that by their islamic brothers.  Jogendra Nath was the leader of the dalit Hindu lobby that sided with the muslims and demanded for partition.

Because this identity is such an important aspect of their lives, bet they eventually do come to be aware of their history.    They can't abuse their power if that is indeed the case.   As I said earlier, they were said to be given a boon by Lord Rama, and thus subsisting on handouts from society became an important if not the only means of sustenance for them. Now, as times are changing people have begun to question the legend behind their almost-holy position; as the article I linked earlier says, now people don't call them for their blessings on auspicious occasions as in the times gone by, and quite a few people tell them to bugger off when asked for money. What do they do then? Becoming more persistent and bold in their approach to potential donors is what they probably devised to survive in a rapidly changing India. Also, there are even instances when non-hijras dress up as hijras and beg in local trains, thus bringing in more competition to the real ones! More than these guys, it is babas who ask to have sex with young daughters of devotee families or money in return for divine favors, who abuse their power.  Don't be afraid or contemptuous of hijras, they're part of our legacy as an organized and just Hindu society wherein everyone had a designated place and the right to live with dignity. As others here have said, talk to them as a fellow human being, and if you don't want to give them any money tell them so.  As a side note, maybe you'll find it interesting that in quite a few Bollywood movies, they're often portrayed as the quintessential good guys with hearts of gold. Mani Ratnam's 'Bombay' was one such movie. You'll surely agree such stereotypes have at least some basis in reality?! :)"

Firstly, you gotta specify how exactly they're getting 'westernized'. We still need to learn a lot from the west when it comes to movie making (especially in the professionalism department).  Secondly, if you're talking about story lines, then which aspect? Sex before marriage? Making out? This is nothing new to Bollywood and has been a part of our movies since forever.   All new directors are well versed in the language of cinema and we're only getting better. Soon the stars will be too old to play any decent leading role and the industry will move further ahead as a medium of art."

But Yael just told me what it was. I was gang raped   Ji Bilkul Sapna Ji, just because boys were from the Amerikka, doesnt mean that this was not rape.

So in her mentally colonized bimbohead, it was not rape and the men were cute. If the guys were not White, she would instantly classify it as rape and the men as creepy. And I find this mindset making its way into India as well, not just among ABCDs. Disgusting.  Anyway, why are we providing these bimbo coconuts a platform to showcase their mentally colonized thought process and behavior to other impressionable minds?

indianews,3cne9d,5-26AM,5,Thu Jul 9 10:51:25 2015 UTC,"cookie is not a problem at all.  they are just making that excuse.  it is not as if they are making too much revenue from ads.  if they are afraid of sharing traffic details with third party ad services, they can just stop the ads altogether, which is effectively what will happen when they shift to app only.  The app won't have ads... and so removing the ads from the website will do exactly the same thing.  no.  the real reason is far more nefarious.  for one look at the permissions that they will want.  they want access to your location, your sd card, your contacts, your everything.  now they will track when you go to a bookstore and when you go to an electronics store and when you go to garment store.  they will push deals to your phone on those products.  they will have huge amounts of very private information on all their users.  they will know that you go to a gym and they will show you protein powder, they will know that you go to a temple and they will show you diya stands and rudraksha malas.  they will know that you go to clubs and will sell you party wear.  they will know that you are fond of camping and will show you camping related stuff or cameras.  this is why they are doing apps.  even if that is not the case, apps are still a lock-in.  once you install a flipkart app, you are likely to go only there when you want to buy something.  and you will be surprised at how 'easy to use' it is because it keeps showing you things you are interested in.  when you search for books, you see the erotica or spiritual or cooking or whatever books right up front, because they have figured out that you are into that.  when you search for shoes they will show you office wear or casual or hiking shoes because they have figured that out about you.  the only way they can prove that they are not doing this is by making their app open source and hosted publicly.  security researchers review the code to identify any tricky parts and can compare the apk/ipa generated by the source with the apk/ipa downloaded from the playstore/appstore and can report on any discrepancies they find.  this is not much of a problem if it going to be a simple client which just sends the search string and displays the content returned.  anything less than this means they are screwing with you."

indianews,3ckbpe,raktha_sindhuram,3,Thu Jul 9 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"Nothing is black and white, everyone has an aganda in such social topics that are basically about cultural self-identifications and not things that are by themselves, as a separate entity, something you might research in a laboratory and make a final and provable statement about it.  Just a couple of remakrs up to the point I stopped reading the answer:  It is completely false that abrahamic religions do not retain local costumes, have no internal philosophical differences and need to be accepted blindly. We don't have time to go into details, but at least from the rediscovery of ancient geek philosophers (first by muslim and from there by medieval Christians) there was a strong philosophical debate within religions. My (catholic) area has retained a lot of pre-christian slavic traditions. There was even a document by that pope of the time to include and adapt in order to convert more easily. Many Slavic deities were just turned into saints, many other customs survived in different intermixing with the religion. Even if you ignore the local customs there are a couple of world-known ones of non-christian origin like the Christmas three or Easter eggs....  Shinto is an interesting parallel. The author might not be aware that the form we see today was not a spontaneous ancient polycentric religion (though we might argue that calling something that is polycentric any single name might be just our personal categorization and decision, not a given reality to start with as it does not begin or develop itself as such, unlike the classical religions) but a result of the Meiji era (imperial militarized Japan that ended with the WW II) state-sponsored administrative, ritual and theological standardization for political reasons that also ""killed"" some specific local traditions.   It might be compared to the need of the present Hindu right or of the colonial time of the forming and rise of the nation(al sentiment) to find some common denominators that will create a sense of unity (behind the state or behind a particular party agenda).   Religions, being abstract, emotional and conceptual mental formations that help unite and control societies are never far from politics. That is most probably the case in what the article mentions about the Dravidian movement, but the opposite side of the argument is not free of that either.   By the very nature of the subject being all about provisional human categorization/abstract modeling of observed social phenomena that can not be an exact reality by definition (but only an attempt to define and model it) such things are almost never, if not even absolutely never free from preconceptions and subjectivity of our accepted value systems, political religious or other ideologies.   So let me dare give a different answer to that - If he asks weather he is a Hindu? If he feels he is than he is, if he feels he is not than he is not. Others might accept or not his definitions or feelings based on their own. There is no way to come to a final, conclusive and exact definition or solution about something like that, it always depends upon the ideological outfit of the observer, therefore he can be whatever he wants."
indianews,3ckbpe,Beljki,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:36:56 2015 UTC,"Fact 1 : Abrahmic religions don't retain local customs.  You Said : Christians do retain some traditions.  Reality : They do as far as they don't challenge their core ideology. For example if tomorrow someone brings up a issue if God is really there or starts worshipping somebody else, there he'll be called a Satan worshipper or similar. Mind you saints are not god like creatures and aren't similar to local deities in Hinduism.  In Hinduism there are places and communities who even worship Ravana and he fought against Rama the incarnation or Avatar or god Vishnu.  There are customs which are culturally influenced and then there are which are influenced religiously.   Fact  2 : Hinduism and Shintoism parallels.  You said : Many of Shintoism local cultures were destroyed by political movement to find a common ground. Same is the case with Hindu right in India.  Reality : You yourself have conceded that these were political movements which wanted homogenizing of all population but how much were they successful is debatable. In the text quoted above it is said by giving an example how due to drought many people of one community are displaced and they loose their local culture but their assimilation to other local culture makes a new common point and a new culture emerges. Things like money and influence also play a role . This doesn't necessarily eradicate the inherit quality of diversity in Hinduism which is not really a religion but an assimilation of local customs and deities which originated in the land of Bharata or India or Hindustan and spread over to the parts of the world assimilating their cultures and deities too.  Fact 3 : The debate between Abrahmic religions were always sought to be between believer and non believer .  You said : There were plenty of debates between them in early years.  Reality : All Abrahmic religions who debated with each other thought of themselves as the know it all person. As if what they spoke and did was the only truth. Hinduism never really had it that way. You see a lot of mention of other religions in Koran too but they are considered as the 'others'. In Hinduism Buddha the main philosopher in Buddhism is considered a Vishnu's reincarnation.  You also said : If he thinks he's a Hindu then he is if he thinks he's not then he isn't .  The reality is you were not able to understand the debate at all. The person who asked the question says if his whole family who practised a local culture and worshipped local deities are Hindu at all as their customs and traditions are all different from any other Hindu. Now read the whole argument again and you'll see it in new light."
indianews,3ckbpe,soonwar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:15:20 2015 UTC,"They do as far as they don't challenge their core ideology.   True, but the article claimed something else, it said: ""you cannot retain any aspect of your old religion, communal deity or customs"". Which is factually false.   Mind you saints are not god like creatures and aren't similar to local deities in Hinduism.   Theologically not, but in practice there are similarities. People pray to them, villages, professions etc have their patron saints... It is explained that they are only ""praying on our behalf to God"" or things like that, but the practice is there and was probabilly more prominent in the past.   You yourself have conceded that these were political movements which wanted homogenizing of all population but how much were they successful is debatable.   Of course, I'm not claiming the state-level forceful formalization ever happened in India, just that he is comparing with something that is a recent political tool, and not a spontaneous religious development and that there are political reasons behind the need to do it in India too. However it can't be forced in the same way in the democratic India (like it can not by the right in other countries and their mythological tools) as it was the case in the imperial Japan and I never claimed that to be the case, in India it is more decentralized and even often a spontaneous reaction to social changes.   You said : There were plenty of debates between them in early years.   I'm not sure where was I writing about that, actually???   All Abrahmic religions who debated with each other thought of themselves as the know it all person. As if what they spoke and did was the only truth. Hinduism never really had it that way.   Because Hinduism was defined as such again fairly recently by the outsiders (Muslims I believe were the first to use the term Hindu in a religious sense to differentiate from Muslims, isn't it)? And it does not have a single doctrine. But you have plenty of debates between various schools. The rivalry turned rather bloody sometimes and it was not less ""know it all"" from the POV of a particular sect.   In Hinduism Buddha the main philosopher in Buddhism is considered a Vishnu's reincarnation.   Most religions deal with others either in an exclusivistic (all others are wrong) or elitist (there might be something right, but we are more right) manner. How it is in practice depends a lot on the social circumstances. For example Catholic religion was exclusivist but moves more towards inclusivism in modern times.   Modern, in a way often smarta-like (neo)Hinduism certainly has an inclusivist approach which is unavoidable if you want to make a polycentric system look like a single religion without forcing theological unification in an autocratic manner. have all the sects and teachers always been so inclusive throughout history? Don't know, but wouldn't bet on it (nor on the opposite).  Inclusivism however is just another tactic to manipulate ideologies for our own agendas.  Buddha never claimed to be an avatar, no Buddhist believes that. However Buddhism had a dominant role in the intellectual and monastic spheres, the early rebound of Hinduism borrowed a lot from them (monastic structures, Mahayana theological ideas), some Hindu acharayas even studied in their institutions to get the necessary tools (philosophy, debate) to deal with them. It is not included as a sign of tolerant benevolence but as an inclusiveness tactic of making yourself ""the right religion"" by appropriating respected leaders as ""lower forms"" of our own born to ""delude the demons"".    All of those are PR tactics. Like in politics where dictatorial regimes can have crude tactics and cast out or even kill disenters in more complex systems you have a lot of propaganda, subtle manipulation etc to achieve your goals. Exclusivist religions that have a strong and well established dominance were often able to afford the former, those that had to deal with more difference on the same territory an less (strong and prolonged) political and military support had to have more subtle tactics (as they need today in general in the ""free world"" ) to make others look worse than their on ideology.   But for the ultimate goal there is little difference in saying ""Buddha is a heretic"" or ""Buddha is an avatar that was born to delude lowlifes with a negativistic pseudo-religion"" .  Making an argument for presumed tolerance out of it as stretched at best.   The reality is you were not able to understand the debate at all. The person who asked the question says if his whole family who practised a local culture and worshipped local deities are Hindu at all as their customs and traditions are all different from any other Hindu. Now read the whole argument again and you'll see it in new light.   I see no new light. hings are what they are. People worshiped something. Giving names, developing terminology, giving definitions - all those are abstract concepts attempting to model such a reality and are neither false nor true in themselves besides our acceptance or not of such definitions and categories.   Some do have a definition that is narrow enough and universally enough accepted by the majority of it's adherents not to create that much confusion. There is little to debate about what is Vaishnavism, Shaivism, monism or dualism. But Hinduism because of that very polycentricity depends a lot on our personal notions about what it is or is not, what to include or not. It is almost impossible to have a consensus and such debates will newer end with a clear enough conclusion to be universally accepted, hence it is rather pointless even to try."

All were from dharmic school of thought which believed there are many paths to truth and you shall find your own. This was the thread that binds it even today. It's not mere terminology that can bind people together.   Buddha never claimed to be an avatar, no Buddhist believes that.   You are confusing Adi Buddha with Gautam Buddha. Adi Buddha was the reincarnation not Gautam Buddha. You spent all your energy defining the wrong.    I see no new light. hings are what they are.    You don't because you don't want to as you had committed a good amount of time posting and writing and it doesn't suit you know to forfeit your earlier position as it would mean all that you did was a waste of time.  The person who questioned was referring to the Hindu as it is used now in contemporary India and whether he did fit into that term at all. The answer is given in that context. Have a good day, this was my last response on the topic."
indianews,3ckbpe,soonwar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"It is true, you are confusing cultural customs with religious customs and deity with saint.   Cultural customs usually are religious in nature or at least original provenience. Many are explicitly religious too, or would you claim to know better what is going on in my own place? There iwas a rich tradition of mythology, but also practices, ""witchcraft"" (actually remaining pre-christian pagan elements) alive until the modern era secularization (and some survive even that, though declining and dying out) with only a very thin christian coating.   Yes, sure. Even if the Pope explicitly demanded for local religious customs to be included in proselytizing pagan regions I guess you would consider it a pure coincidence that the cult places and functions of the Slavic deity SvantoVid got replaced by the Sveti Vid (Sveti mining saint). No relationship there, obviously.   Again wrong, saints are saints and are not deities. Saints never challenge the supremacy of a god but deities do.   As I mentioned they are not the same in theology, but are in function and mythological association to a great extent. The point meter is not that it is a full-blown pre-Christian paganism, but that pagan elements are not wiped out by Christianity. Sometimes they are, sometimes they are silently ignored, sometimes actively included.   Again the claim was that you can not retain ANNY ASPECT of old deities, customs etc an that is so obviously wrong that such claims show no knowledge of European and Church history. Those things rarely get wiped out so easily and completely and you can find them all over the Christian world (especially the old, non-reformist one) as well as Islamic. Judaism is in itself an outgrowth of pre-monotheistic paganism and even the scriptures are full of struggle with such practices and believes, but I'm not familiar enough to know how much of that enters and survives the mainstream religion.    I doubt it as it dilutes their own rituals and customs to great detail.   How exactly does the non-Buddhist notion that Buddha was an avatar while rejecting all of the Buddhist teachings and practices (including that he was a man) as basically a way to trick demons into ""spiritual suicide"" dilute Vaishnavic rituals and customs?  If anything it has had a strong influence on advaita, but Ramanuja already criticized Shankara for that (to be a covert Buddhist). And it influenced them in the similar way colonial rule influenced neo-Hinduism even when it was opposing it - because before the revival it was the dominant force to match up and measure by.    The term Hindu was, yes. But to say they weren't from same school of thought is going too far. All were from dharmic school of thought which believed there are many paths to truth and you shall find your own. This was the thread that binds it even today. It's not mere terminology that can bind people together.   So what. There is much more connecting various abrahamic religions than different Hindu denominations and yet they are not the same religion. There is a lot connecting Zen with Taoism and Confucianism and yet it is classified only as Buddhist... That there are many paths and you should find your own frankly I'm not sure represents Hinduism. A modern newage and neo-hindu version maybe, maybe some of the sects, but certainly not Hinduism as a whole, there are plenty of the ""my doctrine is the only truth and all of you are deluded fulls"" moments.  Also Hnduism today is not identified with all the dharmc schools but only astica ones. If we exclude Buddhists, Jains or even Lingayats for not accepting Vedas etc why would village folk that have no relation to Vedas and the ariyan Vedic religion necessarily be considered such?  If you do consider all dharmic religions Hindu than you have an even bigger problem of the term loosing any meaning or sense as it would make such a wast sea of people and doctrines a part of it that it would destroy it's own purpose of defining a particular religious group. Not to mention that you might than have more ""Hindus"" not accepting such a definition than those that do, another ""terminological suicide"".   You are confusing Adi Buddha with Gautam Buddha. Adi Buddha was the reincarnation not Gautam Buddha. You spent all your energy defining the wrong.   Ah, that's just another addition to the mythological confusion of a myriad of overlapping myths and theories.  Adi Buddha develops as a concept in Buddhism only in the latest phases, besides some recent political needs in a Muslim country to be considered a religion, but that is not really relevant.  I'm guessing there was a convergence of Vajrayana and Hindu (specially bhakti Vaishnavic) movements somewhere in the North-East where such terminology and adaptation might have occurred, or that it is a modern interpretation (or selection of one of the interpretations that fits the bill better).  However the Buddha described in the Puranas and elsewhere is not a consistent figure nether internally in different description not with the Buddhist cosmology and mythology nor with history, and it is not even consistent that Adi, and not Gautama Buddha is mentioned as an Avatara i believe or can be (re)interpreted that way (but can't say for sure, no time to check it now).  Also Adi Buddha in Buddhism represents a concept of a transcendental primordial being, not a manifestation of God in the physical form, so I'm a bit confused as of what should that mean here. I'd guess is the classical ""Puranic confusion"" of religious folk-literature that tends to adapt and change mythology to the circumstances.  What I'd be interested to know is:  1 - is the Adi Buddha avatar theory of a more recent date or is that the explanation you have in older commentaries.  2- is than something universal (highly doubt t as there is almost nothing universal in any aspect, doctrine or myth in Hinduism).  3 - when does the Buddha start to be mentioned in Hindu scriptures (dating of real Historians only please, not Hindutva charlatans)  But there is nothing in all of that that changes much in the subject meter, in all the cases it is an attempt of surpassing the opponent by (mis)appropriating him, pushing our own agendas on him and than refuting those (strawmen) ""arguments"" that we constructed ourselves in the first place. Again a political classic. Weather it is Gautama or Adi, whether that Adi is a physical older Budha or a transcendent principle changes little or nothing.    You don't because you don't want to as you had committed a good amount of time posting and writing and it doesn't suit you know to forfeit your earlier position as it would mean all that you did was a waste of time.   you can use that argument on anyone that has ever said or written anything, yourself included, hence it is just another example of irrelevant sophistic manipulation"

USA for economic and military China for economic and military Saudi for religious and economic Turkey for religious and history   As a country they have deep seated identity crisis which leads them to define themselves as ""Not India"". They derive the history and genesis of Pakistan from the time of Mohammed Bin Quasim. An invader who raped, looted and killed their ancestors. This speaks a lot about the country.  They act as a two rupees whore for any one who is willing to pay them money. USA / UK has been paying them since 1947 and they are doing their bidding, even if it means destroying their nation.   China is paying them now and they are turning a blind eye to the chinese making mullahs dance and forbidding ramzan.  Saudi till before the massive exploitation of Oil looked up to the pakis as equals and now spits on them.   Turkey is a curious case, the Mughals were turkish muslims and ruled India, pakistanis are muslims so by extensions pakis are turks and they ruled India for 800 years.  Lately, during the yemen crisis the saudis whistled for the pakis to come and fight for them. The Paki army and establishement was divided into camps some of whom wanted to fight for the saudis and be called ghazis and some did not. Eventually the camp that didn't want to fight won.  This caused a massive loss of face to saudis and in a tribal society that is calling for trouble. They retaliated by arresting chief ghazi of ghazwa e hind and sentenced him to 8 years in prison and 1200 lashes in saudi prison. BTW, this ghazwa-e-hind ghazi was most vocal against saudis whistling for pakis.  The paki army cited parliament siasatdaans as a reason of not joining the fight. As a result, the hands of Raheel and Rizwan the two noors of paki army is being strengthened to lead a coup.   The problem, however is the kerry luger bill which states that US won't give bakshish if there is no ""democratically elected"" government to represent the gandus. And without US bakshish the land of the pure won't run.   So the paki generals have two options. Either keep on serving massa, forget becoming a ghazi and play second fiddle to the siyasatdaans such as nawaz and imran or align completely with china and saudis and ask them for full aid and become their full time whore.  Thankfully Raheel and Rizwan want to be full on ghazis and have started slow dismantling of siyasatdaans.  The saudis will now pay for their shiny toys of war by buying it from the ruskies."
