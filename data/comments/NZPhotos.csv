How about this one for a more natural looking scene (apart from the wide angle distortion!): https://www.flickr.com/photos/chris_gin/6423150435      The difference in colours is purely due to the light. The first one was at sunrise and there were some incredible colours in the sky. The second was just before sunset, and there wasn't much colour in the sky."

NZPhotos,2wswia,bostwickenator,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Well this is an HDR blend of 3 shots, one of 'correct' exposure, one 2 stops exp comp down and another 2 stops up.  As it turned out, in post I ended up dropping the shadows and blacks down quite a lot so the extra detail I got in the shadows from doing a blend wasn't really necessary in the end!  In general when taking one exposure I would exp comp just to the point where whites would start to clip, IE ""exposing to the right""."
NZPhotos,2wswia,bostwickenator,1 point,Thu Feb 26 04:37:13 2015 UTC,Ah I figured this was either HDR or a reasonably new sensor with a lot of dynamic range. My comment is more just that it looks quite unnaturally dark to me.

NZPhotos,owlrw,thetobester,1 point,Wed Jan 25 21:35:59 2012 UTC,That is seriously very cool.  What was the climb up like?
NZPhotos,owlrw,twentygreen,1 point,Thu Jan 26 00:08:10 2012 UTC,"Cheers :)   About 6-7 hrs to the bushline, and then up a steep, exposed tussock ridge that's quite narrow for 100m or so, then up further to a 'knife edge' ridge, which was a tester for my head (I'm not very experienced) - After getting across that I gave up and hung out at the spot in the pic for a few hours while the other guys climbed 400m higher. They used a rope up there, and it sounded challenging way beyond what I'm up for. I think to a climber with a lot of experience to exposed terrain it would be challenging but manageable for sure - some do it without ropes.   The descent down the mountain was problematic for us as we got lost several times and stayed an extra night and ended up filling bottles with water from muddy puddles treated with Iodine or Puritabs, but that and the getting lost and re-sheduling pick-ups just made it more epic."
NZPhotos,owlrw,twentygreen,1 point,Thu Jan 26 01:03:52 2012 UTC,Dude! That ridge is extremely bad ass. Must admit I am jealous of this adventure.
