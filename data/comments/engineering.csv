If you are working with your brain (which I hope an engineer would), then anything over ~6 hours per day is wasted effort. You're burning yourself out and don't even know it.  The second thing is that you are working for a ""small"" company. In my experience, smaller companies demand better and faster results for less pay than larger companies. Your boss is probably expecting you to be a ""rockstar engineer"", even though you're just out of school (I'm assuming). You need a mentor to really get the hang of things. Experience is the only good problem solving technique, but it doesn't have to be your experience. Learning from others is a huge leverage that you're probably not using."

engineering,3e3myr,EastWhiskey,11,Tue Jul 21 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"expected to wear 100 different hats at all times   Try not to exaggerate, it won't help your outlook on a seemingly overwhelming situation.  Exaggeration of the situation will only create extra stress.  Identify the requirements of your position and perform.  If you can't perform a task, show effort for 15 minutes until you're spinning your wheels, then ask someone to help you work through it.  If your workplace does not provide you an environment where you can freely ask questions, then your growth as an engineer will be extremely limited.  All engineers need to be able to learn from each other and grow as individuals and as a team.  Ask questions.  Always ask questions.  If someone says they don't have time for you, schedule time to meet with them.  If they refuse, fuck them, they're getting paid and ask your questions anyway."

What union are you from?  A lot of work isn't really mentally demanding. Trawling suppliers for parts and substituting what's available for what isn't, for example. Even if the work is designing a new machine it could consist for example of running repeated FEA simulations with slight different parameters or dimensions to find out the optimum cost/benefit for the design.   There's two examples of things that are trivial to do but have to be done by an engineer. Many many times I wished there were more hours in the day."

I think to be a great problem solver you need to know what are the right questions to ask and be able to perform a root cause analysis for the problems you face.

When we see an issue, I can tell an operator ""you used too much epoxy here"" or ""you didnt quite seat this washer properly,"" or I can determine if the drill isn't properly aligned.   As this keeps happening, my responsibility shifts to coming up with a longer term solution for these problems, which is where I am stuck.  How can I make it so that the operstor doesnt use too much epoxy? How can I make sure the drill doesnt drift? What can I do besides check every single part to make sure the operator is putting the washer on correctly?  I just feel so lost the minute I have to look deeper into an issue than just the top-level."

engineering,3e3myr,WampaStompa33,3,Tue Jul 21 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"Question: has the company recently ramped up production?  It sounds like you are doing a production engineering, or a process engineering job. In my experience that discipline can have some very difficult problems because of the ergonomics; you may have a technical solution, but it is not fluid enough/self-correcting/wasted movement/whatever, so the production people don't use it. The solution may technically work, but it fails ergonomically, so it does not solve the root problem.  This is different problem solving than a mechanical design where the part will ultimately be CNC'ed, or an electrical design where an unusual circuit does the trick, or a programming problem where the solution works but it is a kludge which no one will every see.  If your boss has an expectation that you can solve problems that have an ergonomics component as easily as purely-technical problems, then that is where the disconnect is. Process problems can sometimes be very challenging to fix so that they actually stay fixed. My record is that only half of my ergonomic-related solutions were actually used after implementation, and only 10% really solved the problem and were happily embraced by production."

Why does the drill drift?   Also, always break problems down into small manageable pieces. Like in the example of the epoxy problem, first focus only on the operator. Then focus on the epoxy itself or the directions that come with it. And go from there"

Realize that practical problem solving is something that you learn over a long period of time, after many failures. The difference between a good engineer and a poor one is how quickly you can learn from those failures, adapt, and implement solutions.  Don't be too hard on yourself because, as others have said, small companies require you to be a jack-of-all-trades. Try to figure out ways to work smarter rather than harder.

Imgur is blocked at work so I can't look at your link, but capacitors are used for power factor correction like /u/FotzeLicker said. They typically turn on (assuming they're switching and not fixed bank) around 9am or so (when businesses are all ramping up) and turn off around 5pm or so (when they're all shutting down).  They're meant to reduce the kVARs without making the system lead (at least too much, a little wouldn't hurt)."
engineering,3e2khc,thinkbk,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:50 2015 UTC,How is the on off mechanism controlled? On a timer? Can you point it out in the photo linked above?
engineering,3e2khc,workaccount314,3,Tue Jul 21 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"It's called a capacitor controller, I can't see it on the picture, it's probably on the other side of the pole.  It looks like a (probably grey) box.  One of the options for a cap controller is to control it on time (since it is pretty regular), but my department doesn't like to do that since the system doesn't have to be regular.  Rather, we choose to control our switchable cap banks off of kVARs.  When the kVARs on that circuit get just above the rated value of the caps the switches will close and the kVARs will drop.  Later in the day, when the kVARs are dropping to right about the rating of the caps, the switches will open back up.  Switches will typically open and close once a day--more operations than that are indicative of a bad controller, bad caps, bad settings on the controller, or something else.  You can also control based on temperature, amps, dates (like holidays where your load profile may be a bit different), etc.  Now that I think about it, controlling on kVARs alone isn't what we do exactly (although it's an option).  To be technical, we operate on kVARs and voltage.  You can only vary from line voltage by + or - 5%.  Since you do have some voltage drop before the customer is served we set our voltage limits to be about -4.5% to 5.5%.  This basically means that if the cap controller wants to open or close the switch but that action would cause the circuit to below about 115/116V or above 126.5V then it won't operate until it can ensure that the voltage on the circuit will be within acceptable limits.  Edit: This is an example of one of the few cap controllers we use on our system.  When it's on the pole the door would be shut and locked such that the public couldn't access and mess with any settings.  You'd use a USB type b cable to connect to it from a laptop to program it or you could use the knobs and buttons you see (although a computer is much easier to use).  The buttons and knobs are also very handy to check out stats in the field like how many times it's operated."
engineering,3e2khc,antiduh,3,Tue Jul 21 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"For those non-power industry types:  VAR = ""Volts-amps reactive"" = V_rms * I_rms * sin(phi), where phi is the phase angle between current and voltage. a VAR is in units of power (Watts).  Roughly speaking, it is the amount of power that is out of phase.  A kVAR is 1000 Watts of out of phase power."
engineering,3e2khc,workaccount314,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:49 2015 UTC,"Edit: Didn't see that you were calculating VARs.  You're right about the sine, sorry about that :P  Yep, I probably should have clarified since this isn't a EE only sub :P  That should be cosine though, not sine.  The sine would be the reactive part but for power consumption (kW) you want real power, not reactive.  The cosine of that angle is commonly known as the power factor (pf).  To clarify to anyone who's not an EE, real power (measured in Watts), reactive power (VARs), and apparent power (VAs) all have the same units (volts*amps), but are noted differently to distinguish between the three.  Watts are real power (what you get charged for), VARs are reactive (caused by a capacitive or inductive load), and VAs are apparent power, a combination of real and reactive power (apparent power = sqrt((real power)2 + (reactive power)2 ) since real and reactive power are 90 degrees out from each other)."

Looks a bit odd though with so many caps--looks like they have each phase hooked up with two caps in parallel. The round drums on the side are the switches. You can usually tell which devices on poles are circuit breakers or switches since the bushings (the insulators the lines tap off of) are the same size.

engineering,3e2khc,drktmplr12,3,Tue Jul 21 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"Lots of comments about power factor correction without why PF correction. It's to reduce heat loss (i squared R) and improve voltage regulation on the feeder conductors.   If you construct a power triangle and reduce the reactive power magnitude, the current draw decreases and therefore the voltage drop across the transmission line decreases."

engineering,3e2khc,UlrichSD,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:50:13 2015 UTC,I'd guess they are transformers.  Transformers are used to take the a.c. transmission voltages down to usable line voltages for your house.  They do this because higher voltages experence less transmission loss.
engineering,3e2khc,workaccount314,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"They do this because higher voltages experence less transmission loss.   Ehh, yes and no.  Higher voltage doesn't inherently lessen transmission loss in general.  To get technical, you'd raise the voltage on a given circuit which in turn would lessen the amperage (conservation of power--P=V1A1=V2A2).  Voltage loss across a transmission line would equal the impediance of that line multiplied by the current squared.  If you generate at 13.8kV and step up to 345kV then you lessen loss such that the current power loss is (13.8/345)2 or 0.0016 times your old power loss."
engineering,3e2khc,Jerkcules,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah Ulrich, so your statement is only correct if power is constant when voltage is amplified (meaning, current is lowered). It's the magnitude of the current that causes transmission loss due to heat."

From memory, I think it was a custom build by Emerson for Thermo King but don't hold me to that.  I'm trying to think of an application for the generator. How hard would this be to set up for domestic back up power generation (single or three phase) driven via a diesel engine. The 200 Hz rating is what's really throwing me. I presume that I'd have to rectify it to DC and pass it through an inverter to use it?  TLDR: Why would someone want a 200 Hz generator?"

A 2 pole motor at 200 Hz would rotate at 12000 RPM  You could run the generator at 750 RPM to get 50 Hz but you won't get 205V, better to rectify it and then use an inverter."

It provides reinforcement to the wall which increases its strength due to lateral loads like wind or people leaning on it. This can be useful if wind loads or geometry of the wall mean that the maximum stresses are exceeded.   It can also be used to increase robustness in the case of cracking/failure and can also be used for crack reduction around openings. I've specified it near the corners of doors/windows which I believe are at risk of cracking. It is only done every few layers because this is more economical than doing it every layer.  I belieeeeve it can also be used in place of expansion joints but I'm not certain on this. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Once you pass 120 VAC it gets dangerous.  120 VAC is more annoying than painful and I don't care about being hit with that occasionally.  Step up to 208 and 220/240, you will get yourself hurt.  Bad burns, or if it crosses your body it can do some damage to your heart.  Go to one hot 480 leg to ground, amplify the statement about 208.  Now if you really, really fuck up, and get two 480 lines to arc on you, you have a descent possibility of killing yourself depending how it crosses you.  That being said, you can get an electrician to come and install a step down transformer for you, or you can get a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD, VSD, Variable Speed Drive, frequency inverter, freak inverter, vector drive, just pick one), and program that to run on a lower voltage, even though it has 480 coming in.  From there you can tune the motor to the desired speed, control the acceleration, deceleration, even hook buttons to it to run at different preset speeds.  My final word of caution is that if you decide to do this yourself, throw the disconnect supplying this and lock it out with a pad lock, and then have a buddy be near you with a 2x4 to knock you off the line if you get shocked and it holds you.  It just might save your life, and give him the chance to say he saved your life, get to hit you with a 2x4, and get a few 6 packs out of it.  Everybody wins."

Ive always wanted to know more about it personally. What are your own answers to your questions? What are your thoughts on nanotechnology?"
engineering,3dwl7t,Broasourus_Rex,6,Mon Jul 20 05:40:26 2015 UTC,"I think that nanotechnology definitely has the potential for a large scale impact. I mean, I'd say it was one of the major contributing factors to the Digital Revolution. To my knowledge, processes that create computer chips are ones utilizing principles studied in nanotechnology (photo-lithography, for one). Medicine is another big place it can change the world. I've heard of more efficient drug delivery systems and even a remote controlled one. All of which are still in research but definitely viable in the coming future.   It seems to me nanotechnology will mostly stay in the field of electronics and medicine though, with few exceptions. I know that some very new sports equipment use carbon nanotubes because of their rigidity. But I think we're still going to use reinforced concrete for our construction, so I don't think we'll see a space elevator anytime soon. Or giant arcologies. Maybe we will, though. I don't think people in the 1960's could have ever envisioned the Burj Dubai actually being built. (Or maybe they did. I'm not sure).  Most of what I know about nanotechnology is from news outlets, though. And a summer course I took where I only learned about the basics of the Bravais Space Lattice and Miller Indices. I haven't advanced far enough in my education such that the really ugly math sets in.  Overall I think nanotechnology surely has its place in the future. That's good, because that means there's plenty of jobs for it. Unless they all get outsourced :("
engineering,3dwl7t,IAmDoingItForScience,11,Mon Jul 20 12:19:00 2015 UTC,"I am doing a masters degree programme on precision engineering with a specialization focus on micro and nano engineering. So this is right up my alley, and I am going to answer your questions from my (limited) knowledge and general interest in the field. First things first, to get it out of the way. No, nanotechnology will most likely not lead to a second industrial revolution. The reason I say this is because the industrial revolution was an event that had affected not just the industrial advancement but even more so the social structure of countries. To put it into perspective, even though the invention of transistors led to the advancement in computing technology it has not changed society in a such a fundamental way as the industrial revolution has.       So even if it is not that ground breaking I still think it will play a game changing role. The power of a nanotechnology is twofold in my eyes. The first being the most well know, the scaling down of existing technologies. Where the best example is of course the ever decreasing size of transistors and other computing components or the miniaturization of known machines so our smartphones become ever more versatile, due to clearing up space for overall dimension reduction or addition of extra components.  A less common example of using this new power in a different way is the addition of nanoscaled machines in traditional production. Imagine you have a product that needs to be assembled in a very precise fashion. For example the coupling of laser diode with an optic cable. This will be very sensitive to tolerances and every misalignment will lead to a much lower total output yield. In order to overcome as many errors as possible you could use a microscale actuator with a limited stroke to outline the optical cable at the last few microns.      The second and less explored is the discovery of new phenomena due to scaling. As you mentioned in your post these ""new"" materials show that with very precise engineering we can introduce new properties. With the prime examples being insanely high conductivity in graphene and the extreme tensile strengths of nanotubes. To give you an example of scaling to ""normal"" larger scale engineering, imagine we could stack carbon nanotubes in such a fashion that we can make a beam out of this material. The hypothetical beam will have tensile strengths that surpass steel, due to the optimization of the material at a nanolevel. So would it replace steel in every engineering application just because it is far stronger? Probably not, because every material has it's limitations. In this case the carbon nanotube beam is of course a hypothetical concept only. As it is very difficult to grow carbon nanotubes in a fashion that allows a large enough scale of production to produce such a beam. So actually making a beam out of carbon nanotubes is not only difficult but also far more expensive than the overall gain would be. As with engineering in general you have to make choices, nanotechnology will probably serve as an additional tool to the engineer's toolbox. One with very powerful applications at that.  I am sorry if my post is a bit brief but I tried to keep this post short and lacking any sort of really gritty detail. The thing is that nanoscale engineering leads to so many new applications that it would be difficult to mention them all without getting tied up into specifics. Novel applications on the nanoscale keep being discovered. I think the biggest problem is that nobody really knows where the limits are. As it is hard to really predict the future."

I'd contribute that to nanotechnology since it allowed more powerful computers to be made smaller. It's really amazing how our smart phones are more powerful than the computers onboard Apollo 13. I think computers and integrated circuits really have made so much change in the last few years, and with the advent of graphene and related wonder materials I think that change will persist. I can see where you're coming from though. Nanotechnology will probably not shift society the way the industrial revolution did. Although even that is not clear, because the advent of computers brought the fear of things like hackers and Y2K. Also, the increasing presence of digital artifacts has pretty much eroded many previously-held notions of privacy. But then again, that's more security instead of overall societal impacts.   If you are still interested in going further in depth I would be interested to hear it. I'm going to study nanotech so it'd be best to see how deep the applications really go even if it starts to get ugly."

However the industrial revolution is a whole different ballpark. It was a major turning point in history. You have to imagine what it was like before the industrial revolution to be alive. The majority of the jobs were rural, almost everyone was a farmer. The industrial revolution caused people to move into the city. It had such a major impact that it completely shifted the political landscape and led to changes in everything from our day to day life to the political landscape. The changes were so massive and invasive that it is hard to imagine what it would be like. The technology that is invented today may pave the way to another turning point however one of such importance as the industrial revolution hasn't passed, yet. I personally think that once (or if) artificial intelligence is ever invented, that too will be change society in a way that is as hard to imagine as it would have been for someone living prior the industrial revolution."

Once stable (reliable and repeatable) manufacturing is achieved, nearly nothing is out of bounds for ""nanotechnology"", which at the moment is a blanket term I guess for anything that deals with any design below a certain size so it's hard to talk about just one area where it can be applied but that's part of the beauty of it, at least to me.  I know this is just words on a screen to you right now but I want to share some philosophy of mine when it comes to engineering because you seem a little meh on the future of nanotech. I had experience in art before any significant engineering work, and almost any ""art"" typically involves the following: with a certain set of tools and constraints, you express an idea or a story or an emotion or you create something that others can process and impart their own ideas on. Your tools can be pencils, paints, chisels, instruments, or even your own body, among countless other things. Your constraints can be the edges of a canvas or the piece of marble you're working on (basically any medium), or a specific amount of time available, or your financial resources, again, among many other things. You can probably see where I'm going with this. Engineering at it's essence is moving towards some goal, with tools and constraints. Tools are countless, and constraints are first the fundamental laws of our universe, and then human things like money, time, or safety.  I know many people have went into engineering with some kind of philosophy like this and ended up designing half a handle for an electric teapot, or have avoided any kind of design work altogether but that's a different conversation, and somewhat touchy. You asked about applications and the reason I brought up art and all that is because it really, truly, is up to you to decide what can be done with it. Its as simple as that, fucking insane but anything really is possible. Cliche, but science fiction is just the first rough draft. I remember when communicating with someone far away and being able to see them over a monitor was something that you would find on a spaceship going lightspeed in the year 2895 but now millions of people can do that from their own little phones and are just kind of ""oh that's nice"" (or at least in most parts of the world). Nobody explodes in orgasmic amazement every time they get a face time.   At times it can seem like the world has no more room for novel ideas, and I used to think that, but now I've moved to the complete opposite side. We can always do better, we can always improve, we can still create something new and in our own special way, beautiful (aww). The automobile has been out for a while, and I swear it's almost like there's a new model every year. Nanotechnology will give engineers a massive toolbox and many new avenues of approach for problems that already have some kind of solution. Synthetic muscles based on electrical impulses? Micromachines that can construct a material that has some built in functionality, a la microscopic springs or sensors? Being able to design a device that you could send hundreds of into the bloodstream and eliminate a specific virus? Its tricky but if you're able to bounce between the small scale design and large scale application, you will never run out of novel ideas.  I guarantee there will be a boom with nanotechnology, but timing is where I can't say anything. It could be a hundred years before we reach smooth nano scale sailing, or in December some guy outside Moscow will find an amazing way to build microscopic assembly units and change the world. Who knows?  And if where you're working isn't heading in the direction you want, change something, why not? Change something there or leave and do it on your own. Just be smart about it, roughly plan. Go do something else and come back to nanotech in ten years once you sell your startup or have a profitable investment or rob a bank, whatever, there will be plenty of people who you can hire who will know all the little details that you won't have time to study up on, and engineers have to shut their egos up at a certain point and know when something is outside of their knowledge. BUT you know the general idea behind it and can guide everything in a good direction. Did Elon Musk start out with SpaceX? Simply put, he did something else until he was able to create something that I'm sure most engineers would be proud of. I bet he's an overused example, but still, valid.  But yeah, nanotech looks bright."

But H2/O2 is such a good fuel combo in terms of energy potential (and low-pollution potential, and less reliance on an oil industry), and the fundamental reason it's not that popular is due to the difficulty of getting useful volumes of it in manageable container sizes. Here's a representation of the H2:O2 fuel ratio in a hypothetical conventional rocket.  I suppose the hypothetical containers would just be little cages made from molecules of things. You'd want them to be liquid at room temperatures and pressures, so that they become easier for humans to use. Perhaps they'd be carbon tubes with ends, or perhaps they'd be carbon balls with needles/spikes/etc to ensure liquid properties. Plus, you wouldn't have to fuss with cyrogenics as much as before.  So why aren't they being used now? I'm not sure, but it's probably relating to manufacturability on a large scale, and then how to fill them, and then how to use them / extract the gas and filter out the container material.

You can take the 'learning-to-learn' skill set and apply it to any career.  We can't really help you with 'suggestions for ideas to pursue,' as only you know your interests.

The best part, IMO, is the fact that the tourists just keep on touristing through the whole thing, despite the mass damper swinging around behind them.  I was actually in my office on the 9th floor in Hsinchu, Taiwan, when this one hit; it was quite a shaker."

But really, Taipei 101 was engineered with earthquakes in mind, similar to buildings in Tokyo, and the mass damper is doing its job well.    Earthquakes also aren't even the worst of it. If you go to the top of Taipei 101, in the same room as the mass damper, there's a large screen playing footage from a few different typhoons that have hit Taiwan which actually caused the damper to sway even further due to wind loading."

If you can get your period out beyond the peak of the response spectra your accelerations will be relatively low. Also, risk category for these buildings calls for more conservative designs. Finally because of the money invested some owners will opt for a performance based design that will result in a structure that performs very well."
engineering,3dtler,thegreybush,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"I was talking purely on the effect of me feeling safe while using the building, I wasn't trying to say there would be some sort of structural damage to the building in the event of an eq.   As for the statement you said, I wouldn't necessarily agree because there are many more variables to consider while trying to compare eq effect in tall and small buildings. (structural system, material used, quality of force transfer, strucuture type and so on...)"

engineering,3dtler,81dwarves,-6,Sun Jul 19 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"Well maybe, but there is no guarantee that the building itself wont be damaged enough to get you seriously injured. And also, you have to factor in that not 100% of building resident will be located at the top floor, and generaly people will be located throughout the building, thus making your way out to the nearest flat, object-less surface a logical way to proceed in the event of an serious eq."
engineering,3dtler,Gallig3r,4,Sun Jul 19 19:17:06 2015 UTC,Literally your entire job as a Structural Engineer is to guarantee that the buildings you design don't fall down.
engineering,3dtler,81dwarves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:20 2015 UTC,Nobody can guarantee that. If you tried to make structures indestructible you would quickly find yourself out of clients. As an example the Kobe earthquake was fairly recent (1995) and over 6000 people died. It wasn't the fault of all the engineers. With each new earthquake we learn new lessons. We learn from these and adapt.
engineering,3dtler,81dwarves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that is a good example to make your point.  If the Kobe earthquake hit today, I'm willing to bet there would be much fewer structural collapses, as we've learned better ways to design members and connections.  I would say that example was more of a lack of knowledge than it was as a result of an accepted trade-off between cost and overall life safety.   As far as earthquakes go, the trade-off instead is between cost and post-earthquake usability of the building / repair costs.  For example, after a 500-year earthquake (or whatever you design for), you might have to demolish the building (high ductile behavior might damage the facade, leave structural members inadequate for future earthquakes, etc. etc.), but HEY it didn't collapse during the EQ killing the people inside."
engineering,3dtler,peacecoast42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:14:40 2015 UTC,My point is that you can't guarantee anything. The failures don't show that the engineers failed to do a thorough job. It shows that we have to make a lot of guesses and assumptions based experience and new lessons learned. If you were to try to make a guarantee you would have to be so conservative it would not be feasible. We design for the largest probable earthquake not largest possible. We then modify the base shear based on generalized ductility of the building system used.
engineering,3dtler,Gallig3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:33:19 2015 UTC,"As a side note you would be surprised at how little the codes change. I picked Kobe because the number of lives lost was huge, it was a unique earthquake history, and it wasn't that long ago. I could have easily used Christchurch as an example. The largest change made in Japan had been the wide use of base isolation. It's estimated there have been over 7000 base isolation projects in Japan vs 50 in the US."

Well, sure you really cant guarantee no failure from a theoretical standpoint, even if you do understand 100% the behavior of the entire structure. I believe LRFD proportions the phi factors to have a 1/10,000 chance of having an over stressed member?  Of course, there's other ""inherent"" safety factors that I guess would just lower that chance of overtress (overstrength?), such as never seeing the design loads, or having designers round up for extra capacity, moment redistribution, etc.  So, yes, there is still that statistical chance of failure even if we did 100% successfully analyze how the structure is behaving under all loading types; but from a designer's point of view we still make it so its ""close enough"" to being ""indestructible"" for the given loads based on our assumptions of behavior.  And I definitely agree with you - the reality is we don't always have the complete knowledge/understanding of behavior, we tend to learn a lot after earthquakes for how to better detail for ductility (ACI's earthquake chapter is always being updated, even ACI 318-14 has plenty of new rules despite all the effort to re-arrange all the chapters). I'm saying the incomplete knowledge/understanding of behavior was a bigger factor in the collapse of the structures, less so than a trade-off between safety and economics."

engineering,3dtler,81dwarves,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:29 2015 UTC,That is an interesting video. Unfortunately TMDs are really only very effective for narrow-band periodic excitations. This means they work excellently for wind or marching but any performance gained in and earthquake is most likely just a bonus and not necessarily relied upon to reduce seismic forces seen by the lateral force resisting system.
engineering,3dtler,ozzimark,-15,Sun Jul 19 17:41:18 2015 UTC,What you are talking about is a very classical engineering debate.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XggxeuFDaDU  The damper is always in motion and I know that first hand.  I have also been to the top and that is in motion a lot more than I would have liked it to be after a week of eating sushi.  The damper acts like a capacitor in a circuit.  Your rigid parts are more like the resistors.  But they built the building as an engineering marvel.  While they were building that every plastic toy in the US had 'Made in Taiwan' stamped on it's bottom.      So that damper swings forever like a pendulum.  And unlike the very rigid twin towers in New York and surrounding buildings Taipei 101 was built to flex and move with it's surroundings.  There are frequent wind storms and earthquakes.    And building a building like that where it was.  It put it self in the way of strong winds.  From an engineering perspective it was a nightmare.  But it just so happened that everyone who lived on that street was an engineer.    TL:DR  The ball always moves and it was designed to.

engineering,3dvwku,Kiwibaconator,2,Mon Jul 20 05:42:32 2015 UTC,Both.   Amt is more efficient at transmitting power and this gives better fuel efficiency.   Cvt had an advantage against torque converter Automatics with only 3 or 4 gears.   But those days are long gone.

engineering,3dvpbo,Hydromeche,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"Is this for pneumatics or hydraulics?  And what pressure is it required to seal? I'm guessing you're going to use a .070 cross section O ring for something of this size and relatively low pressure(injection molded plastic isn't super high strength), so you would want to use a gland depth of .055 to .057 for a reciprocating seal.  This will keep the O-ring from rolling in the groove and possibly extruding.   If you're using a different pressure or media like mentioned by Thejoven, the parker hand book is an excellent resource.   Generally, a cylindricity of .003"" to .005"" is acceptable for hydraulic/pneumatic pistons."

Never have I heard a convincing argument for it, and it makes me suspect that it's either a rumor or a practice put in place by bitter recruiters who resent others who worked harder than they did in school.  I know people who have really, amazingly high grades in a college known for grade deflation. They are not each deficient in some way; nor do they all share some common weakness supposedly selected against by recruiters. In fact, they're usually much harder workers with better experience and more social skills than the people I know with the more ""reasonable"" 3.0-3.5's. They get research positions, they get internships, they make money, they get into good grad schools. Any company avoiding these students for having ""too high"" of grades is doing them a favor, forcing them to apply to positions where they'll find more people like themselves and less who got drunk and lit couches on fire during rush week.  (That isn't to say there's a terrible lot wrong with such activities; just that people who choose to do so instead of working long nights for better grades ought not to resent those who do.)"

It's not universally true, but it happens frequently enough for me to see a trend.  Things like looking at your hands, or giving short and curt responses to questions, appearing extremely anxious or nervous, not asking questions, it all paints a picture of an individual who does not communicate effectively. That's a problem. Charisma and confidence are interview traits that are just as importance as experience and knowledge."

The issue is, they're trying to hire the ""elite"" from a pool of graduates, people who are probably hoping to get hired by CH2M, B&C, UTC, Tesla, etc for their small contracting firm for $60k a year... Those guys don't want $60k a year from a contracting firm. They wouldn't mind $65k a year from the big leagues, but not from a small contracting firm. The people who will take $60k from a small firm are people around the 2.0~2.9 GPA range without concrete experience. They're willing to be trained and earn their spot. The degree is at least an indicator that they survived engineering curriculum. Expecting them to have internship experience and a high GPA without considering what they had to do to work through school is rather pretentious. And also the reason a lot of us are abandoning the field altogether."

Power companies are now hiring and grabbing engineers from other competitors as the older generation retires. In some places there is a huge experience gap and some interesting scenarios have come about from this adding to the slow assimilation. The industry is also different because there is no incentive to stay at one company for more than 10 years let alone 45 like some of my coworkers. Controls isn't an easy field and you generally need some experience to be valuable from what I've been told.

In some cases this could also affect how you implement controls upstream and downstream. It all takes some experience to pick the ""correct"" option."

Lather.  Repeat.  The organization's response?  Offer the older guys who would otherwise be retiring some perks and such to keep them around ""until we can get somebody trained.""

Promises of raises and job security in exchange for loyalty have been met with unexpected company closings, positions being outsourced, laid off after mergers, etc. There simply isn't a lot of trust that employers are going to reward their long time workers, or that they'll even be around long enough to do so.  The other fear is that staying in one spot gets you pigeonholed. I've heard many stories of engineers struggling to find work outside of their specific area of expertise after a long tenure, and I am regularly advised to stay diverse and keep my eyes open for opportunities.

And I've also been paired with graybeards that were burnt out... granted extra staffing but too fried to make use of the resource.  So that's an exercise in drinking from the fire hose while putting out a fire.   I would have no qualms if we had a previous working relationship; however, leadership tends to think that technical folks are all inter-changeable.  [That's just wishful thinking, imho.]  I would add that certain markets force the money issue.  If a new grad is heavy on school loans and trying to make it in LA or SF, wages does not track with inflation/cost of living.

That's enough time to learn the processes and learn the workflows. Then after 2 years of 2-4% raises a recruiter comes along and says ""How about a 25% raise for showing up to a different office but doing the same job?"".   No one turns that down, especially because we all have student loans, rent is skyrocketing, milk is $3/gal, and people want kids before they turn 40. Then we read the news that X company is laying off 10%, Y is laying off 15%, and Z is selling all assets to A and cutting the headcount.

If manufacturing and heavy industry begins to tilt back to the US, the climate for engineering jobs will improve.  Some say that this is on the verge of happening as China's growth slows.  Others say it may not happen in our lifetimes.  I would secondarily lay the blame on human resource departments and their strange hiring practices.  It's no longer fashionable to hire new graduates and apprentice them into positions, as if they'd work with a company for decades.  Rather, they prefer to hire in a directly targeted way for specific skill sets that no new graduate could possibly have.

HR will often list requisitions with job requirements that no real person could possibly have right have out of school. Additionally, unemployed engineers from the most recent recession as well as recent grads with Masters degrees apply to the same ""entry level"" jobs. This creates large applicant volume which forces HR to filter applications to 5-10 to plop on the Hiring Managers desk.

The automotive industry mostly needs engineers for general roles and the critical thinking skills rather than the actual concentration they did in most cases.   That being said, I could have told you to go into automotive in 2010. People outside of Michigan do not tend to realize this, but the majority of the closings for the automotive industry happened from 2002 to 2006. They were already streamlining and cutting waste fairly well. The problem was that with the economy tanked, people just stopped buying cars as much. Most of the Senate and House hearings on the automotive industry that happened before the bailout were focusing on why it happened, was it the fault of the automotive industry or something else, and lastly, did the automotive industry do enough to help stop their decline into bankruptcy. I could garauntee you that if they were not bailed out and fully went under, you would have needed an engineering degree for building things in the next massive depression that would have occurred."

engineering,3dr8y1,mmediaman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:58:26 2015 UTC,"Some companies may have favoritism from certain schools based on a history of candidates.  However, that could be positive or negative.  Frankly, a company is most interested in your skills and experiences.  They have a job to do, and all they really want to know is if you're capable of that work.  Being a kid fresh out of college is especially tough because you lack the experience and in some cases some of the skills.  Many companies are so unwilling to train that they magically want a guy with 10 years of experience but also want to pay them entry level pay.  The company makes a compromise.  The best you can do as a college kid or recent graduate is to learn what skills and experiences are needed, and fill in any gaps you have.  To do this, the best route I've seen is to look at job postings.  Make a big list of everything they ask for.  If you're an EE, look at EE job postings, a hundred of them.  Write down every skill they ask for.  Write down every experience they ask for.  Write down every piece of software or device they want you experienced with.  Build your list.  This list represents what employers want from you the potential employee.  Now many things will be covered in college through various projects and coursework.  However, a good portion of the things they ask will be lacking.  While college tells you nothing about this, a good approach is to get into personal projects and degree related hobbies that fill in these gaps.  Now don't feel bad about not having everything.  For example, something like EE is pretty broad and has many sectors.  Focus on the types you are interested in.  Also, you will begin to see a pattern where every employer asks for X, Y, and Z.  All the common stuff should be things you know or should know.  All of these should be on your resume.  Research where the hotspots are for your job type.  Typically a particular engineering field will have certain cities that are packed with that type of engineering.  For example, where i live we're massively focused towards medical device engineering and a significant portion of the jobs are related to this.  It isn't my personal focus, but if it was, my location would be a hotspot for it.  At the end of the day, don't feel bad about not having a job immediately.  For reference, my first employment took 6 months out of college to get.  After a layoff from that job it took me 8 months to get my next one.  I'm a person who isn't willing to move more than about 500 miles.  I also completely avoid contract work which is becoming a slight epidemic in my field.  In my field specifically they're quite picky, not for any good reason though.  They just seem to be.  It may literally take 100, 150, or 200 resumes and a reasonable portion of them transitioning into interviews to land just one job.  Most folks fresh out of college really don't understand this.  They pick one place they'd fantasize about working at and apply to that one place.  The people that actually get jobs are applying to hundreds, anyone, everyone related to their field just for the random chance of being the best fitting person for that particular company."

engineering,3dr79e,edro,39,Sat Jul 18 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"The fundamental mechanics of a screw are a lot simpler than a bolt, which is still debated as to how it actually works, though the main concepts are generally agreed upon.  At it's most basic level, the screw is a wedge wrapped around a cylinder, and is thus a variation of a simple machine. Installation of screws works on this principle to allow a torque to insert them into a material slowly. When this happens, the internal forces in the screw are minimal and can be neglected.  Once a screw is put in place and a tensile load is applied, the threads in contact with the material resist the load. The point of failure occurs when one (1) of he following things occurs:   The shaft of the screw is loaded beyond its ultimate strength. When this occurs, the body of the screw remains in the material and the shaft necks and fails. The threads of the screw shear off the shaft. This is an extremely unlikely failure. The screw pulls out of the material because the material fails. The head of the screw shears off. Most screws are designed so that this does not happen before some other form of failure.   What keeps the screw in place? Well friction keeps it from spinning out. The incline of the wedge makes it pretty much impossible for a tensile load to unscrew it. Shear in a screw is handled the same way with any dowel fastener.  Sheet metal screws work the same way. You are correct that there is little thread engagement. Theoretical methods of evaluating this mode of failure are tedious which is why test data is used for sheet metal screws. A #10 fastener will typically yield at well over a thousand pounds but will typically be good for only a few hundred in 22-gage sheet metal.  But sheet metal screws are not loaded like bolts are. Yes, when you torque down a sheet metal screw, there is a tiny part between the uppermost thread and the head that experiences tension. But that is not the same thing as a bolt pre-load and doesn't function in the same way at all. The main mechanism of a sheet metal screw is friction when it is installed to the proper torque to keep it from coming unscrewed. But the way it takes tensile loads is the engagement of the threads."
engineering,3dr79e,raoulduke25,7,Sat Jul 18 18:15:46 2015 UTC,What is it about bolts that is under debate?
engineering,3dr79e,chillywillylove,28,Sat Jul 18 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"Specifically the behaviour of the joint immediately surrounding the bolt. When you tighten the nut of a bolt, you stretch the bolt and compress the area of the base material surrounding the bolt.  But what is the stiffness of the base material, and how do you model it? Let's say that you have a lap joint with a bolt connecting two (2) pieces of equal thickness. When you tighten the nut, the two (2) pieces will go into compression. But it's not as if only the portion of the material directly underneath the bolt will deform. The area surrounding it will deform as well. But how much of that area? And how do you mathematically model the stiffness of that?  Finally, if the bolt is holding the two (2) plies firmly in contact, then the bolt will never take shear unless the friction forces are overcome. So some people say to neglect shear in a bolt, whilst others say to consider it after a certain point.  And here's where it gets weird.  The bolt doesn't ever take any additional tensile load higher than the preload as long as the plies stay in contact with each other. So if you pre-load the bolt to 1 kN and place a 0.99 kN load on it, the bolt is still only in 1 kN of tension. It will not take any more tension until the plies are separated. But once the plies are separated you have effectively zero shear capacity due to the oversized holes. So how to you account for this in construction? People are divided."
engineering,3dr79e,raoulduke25,10,Sat Jul 18 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"""The bolt doesn't ever take take any additional tensile load higher than the preload""   Your last paragraph is false. Even when preloaded the bolt will carry a portion of the tensile load - it is a ratio of the relative stiffnesses of the bolt stiffness and the clamped material stiffness. This can be a small number, but the bolt does carry some fraction of the load. Operational stress of the bolt is greater than preload stress alone. You can pull the equation straight out of Shigley's."
engineering,3dr79e,TeignmouthElectron,12,Sat Jul 18 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"This can be a small number   You are absolutely correct that it's never zero. In any structural system, even ""zero-force"" members are never loaded to an axial load of zero pounds.  A better way to phrase this is to say that significant increases in bolt tension do not occur until the preload force is exceeded at which point the load increases directly with the tension.  Prior to the preload, the variation is very small for most joints in structural systems.  I always thought that this was an excellent explanation of why the bolt doesn't take the full tensile force in the connection."
engineering,3dr79e,raoulduke25,2,Sat Jul 18 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"Or if you have a situation where the member stiffness is small relative to the bolt stiffness, this will be a substantial force added to the preload"
engineering,3dr79e,TeignmouthElectron,5,Sat Jul 18 21:27:35 2015 UTC,"member stiffness is small relative to the bolt stiffness   This rarely happens in structural or mechanical systems, primarily because axial stiffness is directly proportional to cross sectional area and the jointed area is always larger than the bolt area, often by as much as an order of magnitude (depending on whose model you are using).  But if you have a tungsten fastener holding two (2) plies of plastic together, yes this could happen."
engineering,3dr79e,raoulduke25,-4,Sat Jul 18 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"Clearly I'm wasting my breathe here.

This is something I've found even many seasoned mechanical engineers ignore, and at times it can become a considerable amount of force."
engineering,3dr79e,TeignmouthElectron,5,Sat Jul 18 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"Clearly I'm wasting my breathe here.   Why do you say that? I agree with you.   I will suggest that next time you're designing a bolted joint you check the actual operational stress by calculating the amount of load going into the bolt   I always calculate the load going into the bolt. And I never design a bolt connection without sizing a bolt that can take the operational load.  But this calculation of pre-load versus applied load simply doesn't come into play in structural engineering. Yes, you are correct as I have conceded several times. The factors you keep bringing up do not occur in structural steel connections such that said checks are ever required. No steel code ever requires this check of any bolted connection. And the reason is the one you already gave:   a situation where the member stiffness is small relative to the bolt stiffness   This doesn't happen in structural steel. Steel bolts with steel plies means you joint area is always much larger than your bolt area. Perhaps I'm wasting my breath?   This is something I've found even many seasoned mechanical engineers ignore, and at times it can become a considerable amount of force.   Maybe mechanical engineers do ignore it. It's negligible in my field."
engineering,3dr79e,raoulduke25,-2,Sat Jul 18 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"They sure can occur in structural steel bolted joints. If you are working with a thin flanges or say sheet metal joint with a relatively large diameter bolt, the member stiffness will be lower and thus the bolt taking a load considerably larger than the preload.   This type of calculation is also not ""required"" in ASME pressure vessel code. Does that mean you should ignore it and there's never situations that deviate from the code? Certainly not"

engineering,3dr79e,IHTFPhD,4,Sun Jul 19 01:47:26 2015 UTC,"Your last paragraph is indeed false. The bolt takes between 10% and 30% of the tension load (not a negligible amount in many industries). The load starts at the preload, then when the total bolt load (preload + 10-30% of the tension load) is the same as the tension load, the joint separates and the bolt takes 100% like you said."
engineering,3dr79e,hacksaw123,2,Sun Jul 19 05:06:41 2015 UTC,"As I have already conceded elsewhere in the thread, yes the additional load is not a non-zero load, but it's negligible in nearly every conceivable case in structural engineering.  You design the bolt to take the calculated load from a statics model. This is usually sufficient because you don't add the pre-load to the statics load to find the total load in the bolt; that is absurdly conservative. Yes, the bolt will take some load in addition to the pre-load, but in any steel structure this is a negligible amount since the bolt load is a function of the large joint stiffness and the relatively small bolt stiffness.  Maybe in mechanical engineering this is a big deal. In structural engineering, it is not. That has been my entire point in this thread. I have yet to see any structural joint that is affected by the pre-load versus applied load comparison in any tangible way. The specific cases that were brought up by the other poster (thin flanges, massive bolts in sheet metal) do not result in a connection which is governed by this criterion. Thin flanges and sheet metal result in joint failures, not fastener failures."

And 30% of a load can often be a big fatigue problem.   I fully concede that in structural engineering it's negligible, especially that the preload is around 90% of tensile strength (iirc) to ensure separation never happens (among other things)."
engineering,3dr79e,hacksaw123,4,Sun Jul 19 05:28:31 2015 UTC,"Preloaded studs work the way you said.  Wood screws aren't preloaded- they just resist applied loads in tension and shear.  They have big threads to gather friction (and glue area), and the spread the steel load to the wimpy wood.  Sheet metal screws aren't intended to be loaded in tension.  Their threads only hold them in place (friction, interference), so they can resist shear loads."

Really the rooftop labor portion isn't a major part of the total project expense.  An interesting option to consider is just not putting the panels on the house at all - in some areas ""Community Solar"" or ""Solar Gardens"" are an option, where a company installs, say 500kW in an old agricultural field near a residential area, and people ""buy in"", purchasing the output of a small portion of that field. They pay a monthly fee to the owner of the plant, and the utility automatically applies the correct percentage of the system's production to each home's bill. You have a middle man taking some profit out, but given the economies of scale, it can still be a better deal than putting it on the house, and it opens up the options for condo and apartment dwellers, renters, shaded houses, etc.  This isn't possible in many areas due to laws, regulations and utility policies, but where it is available, it is a good solution."

Higher latitudes benefit more from seasonal adjustment tilts, and lower latitudes benefit more from single axis tracking. Unfortunately, the reality in many cases is that they get adjusted for a particular season, then the person who's job it is to remember to adjust it back sells the house, moves, loses interest, forgets, etc., and then the array spends the next 10 years at a bad angle, generating less energy than it would have if it had just been placed at a reasonable year-round angle and left there. For an asset expected to last 20-30 years, simple and maintenance free counts for a lot."

If we are ever going to get going on renewable energy, it needs to be localized within a community or personal financial level. The national government(who control the roadways) has too many hands in the pockets of coal, that their help on an energy source such as solar at this point in time is unrealistic.

Gotta use distilled water as well, other wise fouling in the cylinder can increase pre detonation (knock) and bust the engine..."

A more efficient engine means you don't have to carry as much fuel, so the vehicle can be lighter. A lot of people are super negative about the new F1 cars because they're not wailing eargasms anymore. The sad truth is all that noise was wasted power, they've just grown up a little and found a way to harness it."

engineering,3dpue9,mike413,3,Sat Jul 18 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"This right here. the modern bulk carriers I work on have dual fuel Wartsila slow speeds. Things can run without a shaft at 14.5 RPM. With the exception of the solenoid operated injectors instead of unit fuel pumps, there is no difference between it and a slow speed from the mid 80's.  edit : these are 2 strokes though obviously.  edit 2: drunk edition  People just never get it. When you're talking fuel efficiency it's not the engine that us the main talking point. So you can burn diesel 0.06% more efficiently than the other guy. great. The issue is, major industry doesn't burn diesel, it burns 380 HFO. So the question becomes (at 600 USD a ton rather than 1000 USD a ton for MDO) can we burn our cheap shitty fuel cleaner. Cleaner, not more efficiently.  When you have 4 mill in product aboard then 300 bucks here and there makes no difference.  It's reliability and making sure you pass low sulfur requirements. So rather than engine design it's hull and prop design (which impacts fuel efficiency way more than the engine) as well as adding scrubbers to remove NOx and SOx emissions.   Bottom line is the cycle diesel engine is never getting any better.  Get over it."

engineering,3dpue9,drive2fast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"Water intrusion: normal combustion byproducts are carbon dioxide and water, so we already have to boil water out of the oil. Adding a steam cycle means a whole lot more water. Could be solved by oil chemistry changes and a heating (exhaust)/evaporating/cooling system to maintain a big oil tank. A separate system that boils moisture off of a small oil feed using the exhaust system heat and returns it to tank.  But the real problem is emissions. Cool cylinder walls cause fuel condensation and huge spikes in unburnt HC. This is a bad enough problem with the rotary engine. Cool cylinder walls further and the emissions will be miserable. And now we are steam cleaning/cooling the catalytic converter, rendering it useless. A cat is one of the corner stones of emission controls.  I wonder if an engine like this could be run off of hydrogen? Hydrogen loves cool cylinder walls and could solve that. Except the whole lack of a hydrogen fuel infrastructure thing...

engineering,3dpue9,Criplor,2,Sat Jul 18 09:20:15 2015 UTC,"I used to dirt bike quite a bit and I was close to equal numbers of 2-strokes and 4-strokes. 2-strokes give more power per cubic centimeter of engine size, particularly low end torque, but 4-strokes are more efficient.  In races, they regulate the maximum engine size for 4-strokes and 2-strokes separately to try and even out the playing field. Because of this, you often end up seeing both."

engineering,3dpue9,Max_yask,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:55:37 2015 UTC,That is something we would need numbers on. The more energy the second compression requires the more needs to come from one of the expansion phases in the system. We need more resources to find out.

Don't get me wrong, I love California: Great food, attractive people, good looking housing, relatively safe, good IPA/Gravity/Micro brew, lots nearby, everyone WANTS to live in California. But let's face facts: Construction and manufacturing is taking a nose-dive in California because the economy there is plummeting. So firms laid off more experienced engineers than you, who are more desperate to get a gig. They might be willing to sign on for $5,000-$7,000 under what their normal salary is just to not be unemployed in this market. They might even have their PE. Where does that leave you? In a saturated market of engineers/engineering graduates from very competitive schools (UCLA, UCB, UCSD, Cal-Tech, Cal-Poly, Stanford, etc) that are local, plus competitive graduates outside of California that just want to COME to California, in a dwindling economy with high living costs and a recessing work economy. The only plausible solution is to apply out of state, be willing to relocate. In Iowa, you might not have Venice Beach down the street and a quick drive to Disney Land, but what DO you have? An average four bedroom house price of around $120-140k, a salary in the high $60k range (at MINIMUM), a much lower candidate:placement ratio and you can work there to pay down your debt, get experience and maybe even your stamp and come back to California when, hopefully, its economy and market bounces back. But I'll be honest with you: It's not looking good for another 5~7 years. I have met engineers who got hired for $1000 less than my first offer in Silicon Valley, 7 years ago in 2008 for the same job. My first offer was $58,000 with a kicker to $65,000 if I finished three months and decided to stay. Six of my fellow alumni hit me up for potential references, four of them took similar pay in similar fields in similar areas. I got out because I couldn't handle the living costs, I was literally spending every month with about $75-150 left before the next pay check.

I wonder if this machine is essentially a CNC battery terminal spot welder - spot heating the magnet to homogenize its structure.

Edit:  This video  is much more informative.  It shows a large hydraulic pump with 68 little cylinders and a big accumulator.  Since these special idling cylinders have low losses, you can idle many during low load or low winds, then instantly ramp during gusts or loads and charge the accumulator.  Very cool, and much more useful than the little 12 cylinder accessory pump shown in the other material. (oh, mikey linked this exact video.)

This is the only reliable way to figure out fastener sizes. Measuring threads is too hard.   If you decide to make a mold, I recommend reprorubber.

engineering,3dothj,light_pollutant,5,Sat Jul 18 00:58:08 2015 UTC,"Ok so it sounds like (depending on project scope/complexity) you could have engineers do more than they currently do on a single project and that's step one. Then step two is instead of going to manager for feedback and info regarding completed elements you go directly to whoever did that portion.  Right now I work in a design group of 7 designer/detailers, a CAD manager responsible for our group and an engineering manager responsible for our group and engineers in operations. We do some product development and most importantly here we do little to no analysis in terms of FEA. So we go from concept (usually developed by management) where we get a rough design going and that's the responsibility of 1 designer/detailer. Then he runs it through the shop for manufacturability concerns (can we make this). Important detail is that while other people are allowed input he is the only one allowed to touch the CAD. The process engineer for welding (even though he knows the software) is not allowed to modify various gusset features. So the initial designer must remain involved.  After initial concept gets the go ahead it's detailed. Detailing for small projects (0-5 pieces) is done by the designer but sometimes they get lucky and get out of it. Also anything larger is generally distributed amongst the team. Work is managed by the CAD manager but the designer is always available for information. Then it enters checking. As designer detailers we are all checkers. When a drawing is done it's handed to another guy to check. The drawings also go to a process engineer for a manufacturability check (are all required numbers and data there for X process etc.).  So in this process the drawings and designs go through everyone. Now the amazing part is that meetings are rarely involved. A review for manufacturing consists of the designer taking the drawings on the floor, finding the process engineers in person and getting it looked over. If it's a big deal (take at least 40 minutes and involve at least 4 people) then a meeting might get setup. That's the upside.  The downside is that FEA/Analysis skills are not evenly distributed on the team and neither is manufacturing knowledge. I might do great analysis but another guy will build a cheaper design. Also we still have the bottleneck although it's not as bad. We also self-assign work and ascribe to an unwritten hierarchy of seniority ""Please do X"" when CAD manager is unavailable but I'll admit, I've gotten in trouble once or twice for that."
engineering,3dothj,DNGTA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:09:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. If I understand your office's process correctly then, the designer at the beginning takes ownership for a project until the CAD manager distributes the work out for detailing.  Is that the source of the bottleneck you mentioned, waiting for the CAD manager to distribute pieces? It sounds like you have a fairly good flow there, especially since you can all check each others drawings."
engineering,3dothj,DNGTA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"Yes the bottleneck is that the CAD manager has to re-distribute your work out for detailing and he's always getting 3000 things dumped on him at once. He's also design lead so you have one guy that's supposed to manage all the people, give the ultimate approval/denial on designs, and also is in charge of final sign-off on all drawings. Oh and he's got a bunch of non-CAD responsibilities as well."
engineering,3dothj,mvw2,3,Sun Jul 19 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"Could you add in some information about the skill sets of each employee.  For example, I've worked only in the same size companies as you and have worked both in parallel and in series.  The series approach in a small company is rather slow.  I've found it only to be cumbersome because one or maybe two people in the department know how to any particular step of the process.  I've found the parallel approach to be better but also more demanding toward the employee to know ""it all"" to work effectively.  There is a lot of training that must happen to allow parallel work through most or all of the project scope.  I personally liked the parallel approach.  It feels better, and if the company has a large pile of projects they want processed, you can have 3 or 4 projects running simultaneously.  Time wise you still only have so many man hours, so speed is a function of efficiency.  The efficiency could be affected by quite a few factors including one person in the series doing no work and waiting on others to finish their part first.  Efficiency could also be an engineer being rather inefficient for a part of the process due to lack of experience, lack of knowledge, poor research and problem solving skills, and so on.  How about the benefits and cons of series versus parallel department setups?  Well, the list is big, but I will note a few key points.  First Series  Series is a good format for when you find it hard to hire the jack of all trades type of employees.  It can sometimes be easier to find a specialized individual.  It also requires less training as each person is more focused in their work.  Series is bad in that you now only have one or two people who know any particular part of the process.  If someone's sick or on vacation, the process could come to a stop.  If that person leaves the company, you could be screwed.  Series can work well if you have a long list of queued projects that can simply be handled down the line as parts get completed.  However, series is bad in being able to handle many concurrent projects or matching completion dates of several projects as you will hit bottlenecks.  Series has a particular fit and depends on the project flow of the company.  The sometimes easier ability to hire and narrower training scope may be beneficial to some companies.  It is beneficial for a company of this design to have significant documentation and operation detail as well as some level of cross training to account for sickness, vacation, and employee turnaround.  Parallel format  I like parallel.  I like the broad scope.  However, it moderately depends on each employee to know everything or near everything to work effectively.  That's a lot of training and/or experience.  The beauty of having a department full of know it alls is that they all can do anyone's job, and that's kind of powerful.  Parallel allows batch processing of projects.  If you have 4 engineers, you're processing 4 projects, and concurrency of timelines don't matter all that much.  The common knowledge of the parallel format also offers several distinct advantages.  One, any employee can cover for another in the case of a sick day or vacation.  Two, common skill sets means collaboration is VASTLY easier and is much more common naturally.  Rather I should say collaboration becomes a natural thing to some extent.  Three, you have all highly skilled employees with heavy cross training, shared knowledge, and a broader understanding of the product development process and influences of design, manufacturing, assembly, costs, reliability, ease of service, and so on.  Broader skill set breads broader understanding and a higher skill to balance the project.  Is there much bad about parallel?  In my eyes, not really.  Other than being able to hire or spending the time to train and mentor employees capable of the broad scope of work, no not really.  Plus there's another interesting component.  Any parallel design can mimic series if necessary as project demands dictate.  Series can't mimic parallel, but parallel can mimic series.  Oh, and the other downside is the lack of specialization and high knowledge detail without significant experience, but that's something that balances out with time and isn't much of a problem unless the company has high turnaround.  I know I was rambling a bit.  Sorry.  However, hopefully that points out some differences and details of a couple choices your department can make.  I said earlier, I'm a fan of parallel.  I like what it can achieve, but I also understand the daunting nature of hiring high experience or spending a lot of time training and mentoring.  Not every company's willing to spend the money or time to get there, but man does the department run nice.  A small note on the manager.  I've managed some, and have been under some variety of managers.  A good manager will learn what scope they can handle in the hours they have.  These managers will learn to delegate and train as required to make their work reasonable and not a bottleneck.  The alternative is calling 16 hour days ""normal"" to make up for what you're not willing to train and delegate someone else to do.  It is possible to have a one man engineering department performing all functions, so it's perfectly possible to split and balance the same process across several employees.  There's no magic behind making a department work, but there must be understanding.  I will also make a small note about employee skill.  There is often a large difference between poor and highly competent employees for the quality and flow of a department.  I will always blame management and their willingness to train and mentor employees.  You can create a highly competent employee if you are willing to put in the effort.  However, it is also important to identify assets and weaknesses within the department and sometimes fire and hire the personnel needed to create a high functioning department.  A department full of highly skilled employees almost runs itself and well.  The difference can be night and day."
engineering,3dothj,mvw2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:07:49 2015 UTC,"I like the comparison of parallel and series type workflow. What we have here is definitely the series kind.   Currently we have one drafter/designer; one senior engineer who performs experimental testing; two junior engineers who perform smaller scale expermiments, mechanical designs, and any other odd jobs; and myself who performs all FEA/CFD simulation, analysis, and research. To try and convert our series style workflow into a parallel operation would be an extensive overhaul, although I do believe some cross-training would be very wise for if/when people leave the company. (And with so much undocumented activity here there is a huge potential for lost information if people leave). What I would like to see is projects clearly and visually defined, such that multiple projects can be cascaded over each other so everyone has something to do --or prepare for -- at all times. And hopefully remove the manager-as-hub bottleneck.   As far as my manager is concerned, I don't think he has given these topics much thought, or realizes that things could be improved. I think our current management style exists as it does by a combination of accident and momentmum from when the company was smaller, and not by design. The series type workflow was probably more efficient in the past when the manager had fewer responsibilities and could dedicate more attention to these things."
engineering,3dothj,roger_ranter,2,Sat Jul 18 03:37:14 2015 UTC,"In series or parallel, the manager should still only have about the same level of work...if set up right.  It sounds to be mostly a problem of information flow, and unfortunately this is a management problem.  Series or parallel follows basically the same project process path.  The main difference is instead of you doing everything, you trade off.  It's a relay race, but instead of a baton, you're passing a chunk of information.  Right now the manager is taking and handling off the baton every time, but you could very easily do that yourself.  You could also do some preemptive staging to get the next person prepped and up to speed by the time you finish your component and promote smooth transitions.  The manager could be relatively hands off outside of just monitoring progress and performing key tasks at various stages that would exist in parallel or series configurations.  I think you just need to get the manager to buy into the idea of not being the center of it all.  I know this is excruciatingly hard for some managers to let go.  A great manager knows how to play the support role.  ""How can I help you do your job better?""  I've never had a manager yet ask me that.  I've asked every employee I've supported or managed that question.  Good management and leadership isn't me, me , me.  Good management and leadership is I'm here for you and to make your world better.  You do that through delegation and support, not micromanaging and control.  You are likely right in the idea that the department likely grew into what it is now, and the people jostled into their current roles.  One thing that was really hard to let go when I went from a product engineer to a manager was the retained want to be hands-on.  I still wanted to do a lot of the work I did before, but I found out I couldn't, not without putting in 80+ hours a week.  It's a fundamental shift of duties, scope, and mindset.  Conceptualizing that shift can be tough.  Plus for a small company, there's likely a lot of desire to pick up the slack and do this or that, filling your time with additional busy work rather than putting in more effort into the higher level roles of management.  I think one great exercise for your department is to all get together and map out your product development process in detail.  Identify every step, every role and owners of each role, key checkpoints throughout the process (ex. review stages), map out information flow, and don't forget to tie this into other departments like the production floor, sales, purchasing, everyone that's influenced throughout the process (typically ever department in some way).  Map information flow between these departments and identify where this happens in the process.  A good example is sourcing and purchasing items, not only for prototyping but also production.  Long lead times generally require action in earlier stages or at the very least planning.  Sales will need documentation and specs for literature and preemptive sales.  Manufacturing will need to plan production schedules around prototypes and production goals.  Everyone's influenced and information is going everywhere.  All of this should be able to be mapped out and structured.  It will take a little time and effort, but it's worth doing."

Based on your first comment, since my outer ring is stationary and my inner ring turns, I would just use the radial run-out spec for the inner ring? It seems odd to me that the inner and outer rings would have a different spec for the same bearing. The way I see it, it's a matter of frame of reference, and run-out should be the same whether the inner or outer ring is stationary."
engineering,3dn1lu,howdoijeans,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think you really would use the radial runout for the inner ring. Eccentricity between the bore and raceway of the inner ring will affect the measurement of the inner ring runout but not the measured outer ring runout. Thats why both numbers are given separately.

All of this is going in a cabinet made of MDF, which can't hold the necessary tolerances on its own. The assembly consists of two aluminum blocks, each with two bearings pressed into a central hole. The clutch is bolted to one of these blocks using shoulder screws, with the output shaft going through the bearings, out the back side. The other block is spaced off the front of the first with aluminum hex spacers. The input shaft goes through that one. The clutch hub has about .010"" allowable radial misalignment before it rubs on the coil casing. I'm trying to work out the tolerance stack-up."

I've got no problem if you completely ignore the rest of the post, but I already typed it out...  I'd go with ABEC 1 based on what you've given me.  I've got a few questions, more are just design related / how you are planning on fabricating it.     How are you going to ensure the bearing bores are aligned between the two blocks?  (Machine as an assembly? Machine separately?) If machining separately, how will you handle alignment/assembly? My primary concern would be radial misalignment due to minor deviations in the hex spacer locations.  The other concern that I'd check is angular / face parallelism between your blocks due to machining operations or small deviations in the hex spacers. How are you ensuring your clutch is aligned with the two bearing bores?  Is there a fit bore/turn on that clutch?  I guess (fitted) shoulder bolts could work.  I'm not used to doing something that way.   A fairly common practice the shop I work at, to ensure everything aligns properly, is to machine a turn/bore and skim cut a face without breaking a setup on the machine.  This way you ensure they're perpendicular to each-other.  Bores machined with tolerances +.001, turns -.001"" (Usually with a .001"" - .003"" clearance, depends on application).  Drill + tap holes in one component, and on the other component drill the bolt circle holes 1/8"" larger.  That gives you a bit of play with respect to the bolts, the drilled/tapped holes don't have to be perfect (Like with fitted shoulder bolts), but the fit should always end up how you want it."

A canal is a hydraulic transport method, when you need to move water at a certain rate, you use pipes, when you just need to move it, you use a canal, because hey, gravity is free!"

engineering,3dki8l,MechEGoneNuclear,2,Fri Jul 17 10:07:22 2015 UTC,Canals are waterways that cut across the drainage basin. In order to cope with changes in elevation. They have locks. Locks prevent flow.
engineering,3dki8l,prions,0,Fri Jul 17 13:47:17 2015 UTC,This area does not.  The water has no where to go because the area is below sea level.  Water needs to be pumped or evaporate.
engineering,3dki8l,lowdownporto,0,Fri Jul 17 17:33:30 2015 UTC,You are correct. Something thats man made and moves water around is an aquaduct.  A canal is a man made channel for moving shipping. They are prevented from flowing by the locks that allow for change in elevation.  There will be some replacement of water from rainwater draining into them and overflowing out. But where I am from (the UK) a canal is a specific thing for barge transportation and are very very stagnant.

As well as the obvious, it means the canals will become avenues of electrical infrastructure through the countryside, that most of the new irrigation pumps or generators along the canals will be the much cheaper to run (for the farmers) electric based ones.  It also guarantees a large volume of solar cell orders, which could be a good kickstart to local solar factories expanding, bringing the costs down further for other buyers in india."

But nobody does that, because it's really expensive to build a steel structure like that, and there is other land that's way cheaper.  Yes, the other land is in use, but it's not like you can't find a piece of land that you can buy. This is not Manhattan where land is really expensive.

With an approximate average consumption of 200l per person per day in Europe (US is in the range of ~400l) the water that would be saved in a year could supply a city big family of about 4,500 12 people in Europe. The water use in India is probably much lower so it would make an even bigger impact.  However to produce 1kg of wheat you need between 500-4000l of water (source). Let's pick 2250l per 1 kg of wheat. So the water saved could produce 400kg of wheat. Which doesn't seem that much in comparison.   I would be interested if this number comes from just the stretch they already have covered or if it would be if they covered the whole canal.  Still a good idea imo.  edit: Messed up my numbers.

engineering,3dki8l,dimensional_dan,19,Fri Jul 17 05:10:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't run the numbers, but it's not as simple as that.   This is being done to avoid putting solar panels on arable land, which is better used for farming, so there is that benefit which must be factored in. The panels are being used to prevent evaporation of the water, which is a second benefit that has to be factored in. Water loss is a loss of money, after all. This means that there is a long term return on investment that has to be considered. Concrete isn't free, and a concrete pad requires transportation of concrete to the site, excavation, reinforcement, and soil disposal. That has to be compared to the fabrication of the steel beams.   I'm not saying that this proves that the idea is worthwhile, but it's not as simple a comparison as you are making. The mere fact that there is water saved means that even with an increase in cost, there still may be benefit."

engineering,3dki8l,The_Automator22,5,Fri Jul 17 05:52:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you consider as ""a lot of water"". The article mentions saving 900 cubic meters of water a year with three quarters of a kilometer of arrays. So you save 1 200 m3 of water for every kilometer per year, or 3,29 m3 per km per day.  A kilometer of arrays would then be enough to save enough water for the daily needs of 5-6 Americans (average consumption of 0,575 m3 per person per day) or 24 Indians (average consumption of 0,135 m3 per person per day).  Since the canal network (including the 458 km stretch where this array is) is currently about 19 000 km long then if it were covered with solar panels in this fashion it'd save enough water to supply the needs of 104 500 Americans or 456 000 Indians. While at the same time producing 25 GW of electricity (at 1 MW per 0,75 km).  If the completed canal network of 85 000 km were covered in this way then the savings in water would be the daily water consumption of 467 500 Americans or 2 040 000 Indians. With a production of 113 GW of electricity.  If the opportunity costs in wasted arable land to put as much solar panels on fields and lost water from evaporation were factored into the cost of concrete support ground based panels then the two systems would probably be comparable in price."

engineering,3dir5x,Silcantar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"That's a good question and it has some of he same difficulties, but I'm not as worried about the lips. Lips have much less influence on the sound of speech than the tongue does. To illustrate, you can try saying the same words with your lips in weird configurations and they should sound pretty much the same, maybe just a little odd. Try the same thing with you tongue and the results are completely different. So I'm focusing on the tongue part for now since it's the biggest hurdle."

Until that point they were recipes, and things like carbon steel were invented almost accidentally without knowing the science underneath.  It was maybe carbon from the fire combining with the iron.

Like we know there were actually local gods that people worshipped besides the ones we all know but we don't actually know much about them since we only have found some remnants of temples or artifacts. Even in the Empire record keeping was bad, like the great fire under Nero most secondary accounts don't seem to be very good and the primary accounts were lost and were described by Tacitus as contradictory and gross exaggerations (except Tacitus's widely accepted secondary account also seems slightly contradictory and exaggerated in some ways due to our knowledge of Christian history now)."

Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it, that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What often causes confusion is the large amount of evidence of widespread lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had easy access to piped water.[3][4] This was an unfortunate result of lead being used in cookware and as an additive to processed food and drink, such as a preservative in wine.[5] Roman lead pipe inscriptions provided information on the owner to prevent water theft."""

engineering,3dg5g5,nebulousmenace,28,Thu Jul 16 03:06:41 2015 UTC,"Concrete is presumably quite a complex product. In Rome you may have had several different contractors manufacturing various parts, as well as skilled engineers who would oversee the pouring and use of the concrete.  When the Roman empire collapsed the scale and complexity of social systems was significantly reduced. People probably traveled shorter distances, did not often communicate over long distances and were much less aware of the world which wasn't immediately around them.  The result of course is that the complex supply chain for concrete could no longer exist.  Many industries cannot downsize beyond a certain point - maintaining an entire concrete supply chain was not economical without the large scale construction and interconnection that was available in the Roman empire, without it concrete industries could only focus on small areas with too few projects to sustain them as an economical alternative."
engineering,3dg5g5,EmperorOfCanada,6,Thu Jul 16 02:17:04 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia seems to show that it was used in some places for specific reasons:  ""Although any preservation of this knowledge in literary sources from the Middle Ages is unknown, medieval masons and some military engineers maintained an active tradition of using hydraulic cement in structures such as canals, fortresses, harbors, and shipbuilding facilities.""  but it seems it fell out of use for general construction:  ""It is not understood how the art of making hydraulic mortar and cement, which was perfected and in such widespread use by both the Greeks and Romans, was then lost for almost two millennia. During the Middle Ages when the Gothic cathedrals were being built, the only active ingredient in the mortar was lime. Since cured lime mortar can be degraded by contact with water, many structures suffered from wind blown rain over the centuries.""  (wikipedia articles on cement and mortar)  It might also be that other technologies became easier to use?  It looks like sawmills started coming into being around 4th century AD.  If it was getting easier to work with wood, which was probably always a local resource, maybe concrete just fell out of favor for a while?  (wikipedia article on sawmill)"

Paper rots quickly so you need to have people copying everything over. Even without transcription errors this is a very expensive process, because people able to read and write are in short supply. Of course, without cheap access to written media very few can learn to read and write.  Only very popular texts, like the Bible, could be reliably copied.  Then the printing press came along, suddenly it was possible to mass print flawless copies of a document. This of course lead to a rise in literacy, which, due to the nature of the printing press, made texts cheaper (more copies made each time).

That along with there being few things like engineering textbooks written by companies hoping to keep their ""secrets"".  Basically if your society shrinks for even just a few generations then you don't need whole branches of technology that are involved in doing things like improving new agricultural ground, building new buildings, expanding infrastructure such as wharfs, etc.   Then in Rome they did things on fairly industrial scales. So there would be effectively large companies making concrete where not that many people knew the entire recipe. Plus it was a bit of a secret as you didn't want competitors to know how to emulate your process. And with nothing written down enough to guarantee survival. It all adds up to the knowledge potentially being lost within a single generation. For instance if our economy mostly collapsed and we were all just farming in our cottage back yards for food, would you teach your kids VLSI techniques on how to make GPUs? Even if you did, would they teach their kids?  In some parts of the Roman empire such as in the East they may very well have wanted to cook up some concrete within 30 years of the last batch being made as they would have first cycled through the western empire's ability to export the remaining stocks that might have been left around from other projects.  Then on top of all that concrete of the time was highly based upon volcanic materials which weren't readily available in the east (which is where the Roman empire largely kept going) and thus while the people who knew how to make it might have fled east they would have no ready supplies of what they needed.  On top of all that it is quite possible that in the turmoil that literally the few hundred people who solidly knew the recipe might all have been killed."

Also, the fem background, especially with what sounds to be a basic undergrad understanding of the subject, won't help too much. Unless, you attempt to do a petrov-galerkin approach to working with CFD though even then you'll still need a much better understanding of nonlinear FEM to go that route. If you do decide to attempt the CFD route either go with a commercial route, e.g. Anysys cfd solver, or try out OpenFOAM. Since you can at least be more confident in the answer as long as you don't have any turbulence going on in your propblem because Anysys really can't handle turbulence problems that well."

I would recommend having a decent understanding of fluid dynamics and vehicle dynamics.  The book used to have a free pdf and still might.  While reading it you should take notes because everything builds upon itself.  It is one of the few books made for beginners and what I recommend to most.  For my senior design group I required my team to read it prior to the school year and I would say 8/10 people understood it well.  The other 2 really needed to talk to others about it.

engineering,3ddprk,Ekaros,2,Wed Jul 15 15:25:02 2015 UTC,I'm so confused...
engineering,3ddprk,bipocni,2,Wed Jul 15 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure its been said, but I'll echo it. The reason is steel, simply put it wasn't a viable material yet (hell I'm not even sure it was invented yet...). You can't build a long span beam or abutment with just stone and concrete, it simply doesn't have the required tensile strength and moment resistance.   An arch allows all present forces to be shifted to compression-only, directing it down to the ground without placing anything under tension. This resulted in relatively short spans of hundreds of arches, as seen in Roman aqueducts.  We're able to make much longer spans with concrete today because we reinforce them with steel, back then the only solution was ""More stones!!!"""
engineering,3ddprk,bbqroast,2,Thu Jul 16 00:09:29 2015 UTC,They didn't have reinforced concrete. Which relies on idea that concrete is great with compression while steel is good with tension. Also their thermal expansion is close to each other which makes them suitable long term combination. Romans lacked suitable steel for this method. So large spanning structures just weren't possible.   It really just comes to technology available to them.
engineering,3ddprk,skavier470,2,Thu Jul 16 03:08:42 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you are going to span a multi-mile distance with an abutment.

engineering,3ddprk,KerbalrocketryYT,9,Wed Jul 15 15:06:38 2015 UTC,We do that with a combination of steel and arches. The Romans didn't have steel. Thus: arches.

engineering,3dbylj,Lumpyyyyy,18,Wed Jul 15 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"This exactly.  I have never liked the built in FEA because it is difficult to get exactly what you want out of it.  I want to know exactly what is happening because if I don't the the results could be completely wrong and you have no idea.  With simple parts it might be easy to check, but will the designer(the person these packages are aimed at) do that? My experience is that if it is blue then they say it is fine and never question it.    I don't think the built in packages are bad, it is usually operator error and the un-initiated always trust the model."

MSC and the other companies that acquired the code each developed it independently from there. So that's the ""customized Nastran"" that NX uses.

For studying linear models with common boundary conditions it works great for us in R&D.  Our manufacturing guys prefer ANSYS for 2 reasons.  1) its ease of scripting 2) Tighter control and precision.  Ive done some pretty amazing simulations using the Solidworks Simulations packages.  And when the manufacturing guys get to modeling the same thing in ANSYS they are usually only a few percent off from mine (<5%).   Because of the faster setup with Solidworks Simulation I can get results much quicker, and as such the managers usually come to me first when they have a new problem that needs solving."
engineering,3dbylj,my_cat_is_dumb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:27:22 2015 UTC,Where I work it is done as you describe. Design engineer uses it for his design work to get the design near final. It then goes to the analytical guys who then take the model and recheck the model using ansys and mathcad for verification of the ansys model including vibration. Often times it will then go back to the designer for corrections.
engineering,3dbylj,tlivingd,10,Thu Jul 16 01:20:25 2015 UTC,"Don't underestimate how much engineers looove to overcomplicate things.  A package like ANSYS will of course let you tweak every last parameter and let you do more complicated analysis, but if you realize what the limitations are within the Solidworks simulation package, you can get results which you can make generalities from.  If you're in the brainstorming phase of a project where you want to try different things and see if they work, then its not just acceptable, but preferred in that you can get results extremely quickly without interrupting your work flow.    Plus, let's not underestimate the fact that it comes with SW.  Many companies couldn't ever afford the expense of ANSYS when all they want to do it do a few simple simulations.  As others have said, garbage-in, garbage-out so if the simulation isn't set up correctly, you'll get nonsensical results, but at least with SW you can practice and learn the software because you have access to those tools."

engineering,3dbylj,BordomBeThyName,3,Wed Jul 15 04:24:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, as i have also used both. I found ANSYS to be unbearable to use, maybe its because I didnt put the time into learning the ins and outs of the software. SW is relatively simple and produces quick results. I have never found a problem with SW.  I know many regard SW as 'cheating' as any person can easily produce FEA, CFD etc... without any actual knowledge behind the maths or process. Whereas ANSYS is quite overwhelming for the average person.  Edit: Spelling"

engineering,3dbylj,lie2mee,7,Wed Jul 15 11:29:29 2015 UTC,"Over 30 years with Ansys, Cosmos, SW sim (based on Cosmos), Nastran, and Algor.   The packages used to work very differently. Good results were possible with a careful understanding of what you were doing with each package. Some of the solvers were less useful for larger degree of freedom problems (CFD and nonlinear/ buckling FEA).   The quality of the results from competent use of the SW sim package has gotten better steadily, and has been excellent in the right hands for almost a decade. Those who claim it is not either have little experience with how to use the tools properly, or have problems with difficult modelling geometries...and there are plenty of those cases where other packages can sometimes offer an advantage.   Increasingly, the interfaces and usability of all the major packages is looking the same. The challenge with integrated packages like SW sim is that it is trying to develop an analysis for engineers who know little to nothing about how FEA or CFD really work, divine what they are trying to do, and generate results that are relevant. This is only partially successful. But the same engineers will experience difficulties with any package.   The important thing is to know how to create valid models. Garbage in, garbage out. Know how to verify boundary conditions, trends, and hand calculate as many aspects of the design as possible. Don't trust...just verify. Engineers (and their co-workers) tend to be too trusting and feel more enlightened by the pretty color pictures than they should be.   By the time a good FEA or CFD driver completes an analysis, he or she should look at the tools as communication tools for others as much as tools for quantifying performance of a design.   In short, SW sim is fine. It is a powerful integrated tool for a non-specialist engineer in analysis to get good results most of the time. It will allow a more knowledgeable specialist to get excellent results more or less as well as other codes out there for general solutions."

Then there is the full SolidWorks Simulation package, it is pretty good for somewhat more complicated simulations such as when you need to test multibody parts. I've found it to be lacking in some types of simulations such as impacts or non-linear simulations.

SolidWorks FEA has terrible stock nonlinear and anisotropic materials, and it's a pain in the ass to add accurate custom materials of this type.

engineering,3dbylj,FeralBadger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:21 2015 UTC,Ansys has auto converge which tightens down the mesh automatically in areas of concern to your specified convergence criteria.  Have not seen that anywhere else so you are back to running multiple studies and manually converging.
engineering,3dbylj,DempRP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"Simulation express is pretty crap. The full Solidworks simulation package is fine though. You don't get as much in depth control and flexibility as you would with something like ANSYS or Abaqus, but you often don't need that anyway. I always use Solidworks simulation in the early stages of design to check whether something seems reasonably reliable, then if I need better control and accuracy l can use Abaqus later."

It can still give accurate results otherwise no one would use it, but it just isn't powerful and doesn't offer much in terms of customizing your project.  For instance, some softwares like ANSYS would simplify a beam into a series of linkages with its properties (eg profile) specified. Or you can use a rough mesh on the entire part but use a fine mesh on an area of interest. But in SW, you can only use one type of mesh throughout the entire part."
engineering,3dbylj,mecheng904,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:53:48 2015 UTC,"MechE here, and I use SW almost every day.  Been using it steadily since about 2007.  We have the full SW Pro license and full SW Simulation (non linear sims, assemblies, SRS, etc).  My opinion that SW overall is a piece of bloated crap and the company needs to start over from ground zero.  The software is aimed as taking choice out of the hands of the user and making it as simple and easy to use as possible.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it gets old fast.  It's also riddled with hidden bugs and glitches (some have been there for literally close to a decade) and horrible performance issues.  When I use SWSim, I need to take the results with a HUGE grain of salt, since SW is so limited and buggy that I really don't trust it to run the calculations correctly.  One example, my coworker ran a static sim on a steel structure.  Then changed the material to aluminum.  Got the EXACT same stress strain levels.  Obviously not correct.  Restart SW, restart compy, delete all sim files, check material in model and Sim model, still not working.  Tried it on another computer that had never seen the model before, same problem.  Tried it on another compy that had never seen the model before, and it finally worked.  Took it back to the original compy, and it's working again.  How does that happen?  And don't get me started on the broken triad options that worked just fine up until about 2010 and have been broken since.  They keep adding redundant, bloated features that nobody uses or wants, but don't fix the shit they broke in the last upgrade.  /rant  Anyways, to answer your question, as most have said, it's usually a user error.  You need to understand how FEA works; that mesh size, shape, and type can have a direct impact on results.  You need to understand the assumptions and limitations of those assumptions that go into the model in order to trust it.  Unfortunately, SWSim gives you very very few choices in how to configure and run your simulations, so if one assumption doesn't work for your particular situation, then you're pretty much screwed.  I haven't tried Catia, but I used to use NEi Nastran/FeMap and it was ok.  I've recently been exposed to AutoDyn's FEA and their STR pre/post interface and I love it.  SOOOOOO much more powerful than SWSim, with a very intuitive and easy to use interface.  Lets you combine a ton of different mesh types and sim types into a single, multipart simulation very easily.  Gives you much more control over the finer details of FEA, but the default settings are good enough for most first runs of a problem.  Only problem is that it's $60k+ per license per year... Also you need to pay very very close attention to meshing as aspect ratio, element shape, and element size range can greatly effect their results or performance."
engineering,3dbylj,killerguppy101,4,Wed Jul 15 11:52:40 2015 UTC,"Just a note on your ""problem"": if the steel and aluminum structure had the same geometry, they would of course see the exact same amount of stress under the same load! Stress is independent of material, which is why we calculate stress and compare to some yield or UT stress.  As you said, it is important to understand how FEA works.  In a linear solution (FEM stiffness method), the only material property required is Young's modulus.  This is used to calculate deflection, which is then used to calculate stress by multiplying by Young's modulus, cancelling it out. This means that ANY value of young's modulus will give the same stress results.  However, the reason we use the material's actual Young's modulus value instead of some arbitrary one is that the deflection leans upon it for accuracy. So, I would have expected to see the same stress for your structure, but different deflections."

In this design, the counter weights, compressive members, tensile members, and supported load create symmetric closed loops of force which result in no lateral loading to the chairs. The men's chairs could be on wheels and this design would still work, which can't be said of the segmented arch consisting of compressive members that you describe.

I think you would also be qualified to be an operational consultant (sometimes misnamed as a ""process engineering role).  I would recommend trying to do what you can to get experience in a manufacturing environment whenever you can. Your background in ME will be very helpful in baiting potential part time employers.   I do not recommend taking any project or project mgmt based work. You are an engineer but your experience will be from a much ""softer"" role. Focus on using the introductions to industrial engineering and general statistics vs. trying to do any kind of high level design with 8 bar linkages or CFD. Professional certification in lean manufacturing or six sigma will help you learn how to apply statistical tools to common production problems.   I know several guys who do this work, and they basically get to define their work schedule between jobs. Some of them do not even have engineering backgrounds. Most of the time they do a job for a month or two and then take several weeks or even months off. The pay rates can get silly (5 figures per week in some cases) after you bank some successful jobs, and you can make a lot more money than any engineer, pretty much anywhere, at some of the simplest businesses. Furthermore several of the consultants, who have been successful, are offered regularly to join the organizations they consult for at very high levels (even C levels) in these companies, particularly if they have a lot of experience in that particular industry."

engineering,3d9b7n,argentcorvid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:16 2015 UTC,This is the right answer. There are ways to do a megger test with cheaper equipment if all you need is broke or not broke.
engineering,3d9b7n,GeorgeTheNerd,0,Tue Jul 14 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"No, this is the wrong answer. OP doesn't want to measure whether the insulation is broken down."
engineering,3d9b7n,dhmt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"If the conductor is broken but in contact, that point of contact will have a much higher resistance the rest of the wire and degrade further with higher voltages.  A standard megger test figures out of the resistance decreases with higher voltage (insulation breakdown).  Here, you want to see if the resistance increases (conductor breakdown) with higher voltage.   Same equipment, same test, different interpretation."
engineering,3d9b7n,GeorgeTheNerd,0,Wed Jul 15 12:28:57 2015 UTC,"If the broken ends of the wire are still in contact (and the contact is a low resistance, which OP says when he says ""resistance is still the same""), a megohmmeter will not show you anything.  If the contact opens (for example, if he bends the wire), then a megohmmeter will show something, but a plain ohmmeter will also show that."
engineering,3d9b7n,dhmt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:21:10 2015 UTC,The resistance stays the same is true on small voltages because you aren't challenging the broken but touching surface contact. Put a whole bunch of volts across that contact and the resistance will go up.   What you have to do is put an ohm meter on it while applying high voltage. That is a megger test.
engineering,3d9b7n,GeorgeTheNerd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"Put ""a whole bunch of volts"" across a contact that is low resistance?  Is ""bunch"" around 100-200V? Yes, that will work because you will put several 10's of amps current through the contact, heat it up, and burn the insulation. Yes, a smoke test is one way of finding where the wire is broken. I think OP is looking for something less destructive.  As I said elsewhere, I do tests to find broken wires (but still electrically-connected) buried in PCB or insulation on a weekly basis, without destroying the PCB/cable."
engineering,3d9b7n,dhmt,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:35:17 2015 UTC,"no... you're wrong.  You can test conductivity with an ohmmeter, if you know what you're doing."

engineering,3d55jh,Science_Monster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"For EIS, you should report resistances in Ohms*cm2. It does seem counterintuitive, but you are really reporting resistivity, which is the inverse of conductvity which is Siemens/cm2. It might help to think of it as R = V/I, where if I is current density (Amps/cm2), R needs to be in Ohms*cm2.  It is a measure of how much current will flow through your coating given a potential and a surface area.  If you are trying to publish, or obtain more precise data than simple comparisons for your own internal use, I would strongly recommend finding a potentiostat and someone to help you use it. If you are a grad student, check your chemistry department as well as engineering. If they do any kind of electrochemistry, they will have a potentiostat. If not, contact other universities, many will probably be happy to help out.   To measure the coating resistance accurately, you need to accurately know the potential between the substrate and the solution, the current flow out of the substrate, the resistance of the electrolytic double layer (EDL) and the resistance of the solution between your electrodes.   When you measure the resistance by applying direct current, you can't decouple these facts. also, you need a really precise control and measurement of potential and current. You also need to know the potential of the solution right near the surface of your coating. A potentiostat will allow you to use a 3rd electrode as a reference, allowing you to measure this more directly, and control potential with the solution, not potential with the counter electrode (which is not the same). you also can't tell how much the solution resistance, and resistance from the counter electrode contributes to your total. ideally you want to measure the coating on its own.  EIS is also powerful because by measuring impedance changes as a function of frequency, you can make judgments about the various effects of solution resistance, EDL resistance, (and capacitance) as well as coating resistance. it can also tell you about diffusion through your coating, how porous it is, etc. Gamry's site has a pretty good explanation here."

In addition to the use of springs, an object can be sprung by stretching rubber. Scientists call this “Elastic Potential Energy.” At the center of the ERW is a layer of rubber. Through the use of adjustable rods, the rubber is stretched, which stores elastic potential energy in the wheel, turning the ERW into a 360-degree slingshot that retains energy (hence the term “Energy Return Wheel”). When the ERW is attached to an object, that object becomes sprung. The attached object becomes de-weighted and requires dramatically less energy to move than an unsprung object. Less energy to move means an increase in fuel efficiency.  In theory, when a car is riding on ERWs, it will be like riding on 4 slingshots. This “Slingshot Effect” could cause a dramatic improvement in the car’s acceleration.   Lol."

Even in pneumatic tires the sidewall does most of the actual work, the air just acts as a ""shot peening"" to keep the sidewall in tension and change the load distribution.  Also, this tire would have considerable stress risers in the spokes compared to a pneumatic tire which does an awesome job of distributing load around the rim."

A tire could be thought of as a macroscopic, single-cell, closed-cell, elastomer/rubber ""foam"".   The air compression does nothing   Precisely what are you referring to here about ""air compression"" in relation to foam?  Are you suggesting that a pressurized closed-cell foam has no research-possibilities, no use or merit or application whatsoever for tires?  Perhaps you could explain why and elaborate because I don't see why that should be true.  The list of polymer materials is vast, but if polymer foams don't have the right properties, perhaps other materials would.    Foam might actually be an elegant solution.  It's just another type of spring, elastomer, polymer, metal or otherwise, no different in terms of first-principles, to OP's spring, or the air spring of a pneumatic tire.  If a tire works by holding in air, then in theory, any structure that holds in air while pressurized (either in tension or compression), could potentially find application in tire technology.  That's all I'm suggesting.  You shouldn't necessarily discount foams entirely for R&D.  Including because of their mass.    Foam is not massive or heavy, especially compared to rubber or OP's composite spring.  It can even be lighter-than-air, depending on which gas it is filled with.  We're also talking about bikes with a tire width of 1-5 cm, which doesn't add up to a lot of volume or mass for a given wheel diameter, at least not compared to a car tire.  If tires fail due to sealing issues when they leak air, perhaps it might be easier to a design a tire to hold-in ""closed""-cell foam than to hold-in just air."
engineering,3d2785,tinkerer13,2,Mon Jul 13 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about the material use for carcass construction, foam might be better than rubber or steel, but currently is only really used for maybe constructing the apex of a tire (lower sidewall portion near the bead).  What I was talking about is use of foam in the air cavity instead of air, which is what I incorrectly assumed you meant.  The article makes the false claim (or allows the layperson reader to assume) that the air cavity in the tire being compressed is the cause for inefficiency.  This is simply not the case.  Rubbers are used for tires not because they hold air in (though this is desirable) but because they are hyper-elastic and can undergo a great deal of strain without failure (and redistribute load well), and have good wear properties in direct contact (though modern tires use separate carcass and tread compounds).     It's just another type of spring, elastomer, polymer, metal or otherwise, no different in terms of first-principles, to OP's spring, or the air spring of a pneumatic tire.   Air helps to hold the shape rather than to provide spring rate like in an air spring, which operates off of an entirely different principle.  In an air spring you have a much larger difference in compressed and uncompressed volume (something like 90% volume change).  This causes damping and loss of energy through heat transfer.  In a pneumatic tire, you have at the most 1-2% compression of the air cavity volume (due to reinforcing steel belts and Kevlar carcass plys, among other things).  This means that the air holding capacity of a tire (to me the largest difference between a pneumatic tire and the hollow holey tire in the article) has very little to do with the efficiency.    If there is some huge gain to be made via a non-hysteretic, hyper-elastic material that is durable enough to be used in tire construction, this article did a piss poor job of letting that be known."

Spoke loading  The hub of your wheel actually hangs from the top of the rim, which is why they can be long and skinny. A pneumatic tire does a very very good job of distributing the load around the entire rim and allowing the spokes to do their thing.  This design, and any non pneumatic tire really, is loading the rim directly at the bottom and concentrated in the one spot. This means that the rim and spokes are not being loaded completely as designed. The bottom spokes won't carry any load(they can't) but the rim and side spokes are going to be more heavily loaded to distribute the force into the upper spokes. Prepare for broken spokes.   Tire dynamics also have a huge role in the dynamic handling of the bike, I don't know what this would do to the bikes stability."

If I'm on smooth XC, I'll run higher pressure for efficiency. When I'm on a rougher trail, I'll air it lower for more grip."

One thing that comes into mind that you keep this design as inside, like some sort of skeleton, but you cover it with rubber all around to keep dirt, water, etc. outside. In kind of you would get tubular tire with inner skeleton for puncture and damage resistance and outside rubber for grip and sealant. But it is question how many technical challenges that poses, how good solution is, how heavy (important) resoult would be, and of course pricing.....

Under a uniformly distributed load (same over the entire length of the beam) the beam's moment diagram will have a parabolic shape. You just need to create a distributed load such that the moment diagram has zero slope (flattened).  I'll leave that to you. ;)  EDIT WELL AFTER THE FACT: Crappola! Yeah, it definitely won't do for SSB due to zero moments at ends. However, there are ways to get this to work...just not with SSB."

To get a constant moment, you would need to apply two (2) equal and opposite point moments at the ends of the beam.  Probably the easiest proof that it isn't possible is that a simply supported beam has zero moment at the ends, and distributed loads only increase the moment in the beam without affecting the moment at the ends.

Similar regular shapes were created in the laboratory when a circular tank of liquid was rotated at different speeds at its centre and periphery. The most common shape was six sided, but shapes from two to eight sided were also produced. The shapes form in an area of turbulent flow between the two different rotating fluid bodies with dissimilar speeds. A number of stable vortices of similar size form on the slower (south) side of the fluid boundary and these interact with each other to space themselves out evenly around the perimeter. The presence of the vortices influences the boundary to move northward where each is present and this gives rise to the polygon effect. Polygons do not form at wind boundaries unless the speed differential and viscosity parameters are within certain margins and so are not present at other likely places, such as Saturn's south pole or the poles of Jupiter.     wikipedia  page"

engineering,3d2wo7,nastypoker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:39:13 2015 UTC,I am not going to do the maths for you but that solar panel is a trickle charger and that battery is tiny. It all depends on what you want to run from it but there is a reason kitting out a house or whatever with solar panels costs thousands and that is because they are much larger. If you wanted to run a single light then this setup might work but it wouldn't be any use to power household devices.

engineering,3cvdyr,cessna182er,7,Sat Jul 11 04:30:16 2015 UTC,"In this case the ""two parallel flows"" are different layers of the atmosphere. Cool dense air near the ground is much more stable than the hot air of the upper atmosphere, and the interaction between the two regimes creates these patterns.   What is happening is that the nocturnal near-surface layers (lowest 50-100m) of the atmosphere are much more stable than the layers above it in the mornings. Until the ground heats up due to daytime heating, the surface layers stay more stable than the air over it. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves occur when the wind shear between the layers destabilizes the topmost portion of that stable layer, and entrains the air into the unstable layer. What you see is stable air being lifted, cooled, and condensed so that this process becomes visible, though this commonly happens many places without being visible.   non-scientific source"

The issue is compounded by ageing and decaying equipment which the utility will have to deal with issues from, but cannot fix themselves.  Also, when a line goes down, equipment cannot be attempting to back feed while people are working. Meaning every generation point needs to stay disconnected with 100% assurance at each and every generation point.  The rest of the issue is relating to proper scaling of utility generation.

He's not saying to place the turbine inside the capillary, but rather to use capillary action to increase the height of a volume of water, and then use the water at the increased height to power a turbine.  This is really intriguing. My question is this: how do you get the water from the capillaries into a pool where the water can flow freely into a turbine. It seems that that is where your energy loss would be."

But in any case, the act of lifting fluids in a capillary tube has to use energy from something. All I can think of is thermal energy."
engineering,3cxlml,floridawhiteguy,3,Sat Jul 11 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"Water has energy to do work: it carries chemicals in solution, adheres to surfaces and makes living cells turgid by filling them. This energy is called potential energy. At rest, pure water has 100 percent of its potential energy, which is by convention set at zero. As water begins to move, its potential energy for additional work is reduced and becomes negative. Water moves from areas with the least negative potential energy to areas where the potential energy is more negative. For example, the most negative water potential in a tree is usually found at the leaf-atmosphere interface; the least negative water potential is found in the soil, where water moves into the roots of the tree. As you move up the tree the water potential becomes more negative, and these differences create a pull or tension that brings the water up the tree.   What you're thinking of doing would require some sort of energy input at the top of the system to draw the water out of the capillaries.  Plants succeed because they transpire a good deal of water as vapor.  In order to replicate the process, you'd need a large surface area with microtubular channels to wick water away from the capillaries and on which the surface grades from hot to cool (perhaps with a solar heat engine assist). You'd lose most of the water to vapor, but you might collect as much as 0.1% as liquid water into a container, with the gravitational potential to drive a turbine.  And there lies the rub - to make such a process work, you'd have to expend an enormous amount of energy to create the specialized materials, and you'd lose 99.9+% of the water you transported up the gravity well.  Plus, it would likely work to useful effect only during the day, be less effective in cold, dark, damp locations (like Seattle, which has plenty of water) and only marginally more effective in Death Valley (which has lots of sunshine and dry conditions but precious ground little water).

engineering,3csqmx,mgannett,32,Fri Jul 10 13:51:37 2015 UTC,"I can answer this since I am a turbo diesel performance engineer.  Water injection in ICEs - principly turbocharged engines is used for cooling the charge air. In the case of spark ignited engines like gasoline engines this is helpful for keeping the engine from detonation.  This means you can use better spark timing or compression ratios while still meeting emissions limits and not detonating.  You could make the engine more powerful this way too.  In diesels water injection is rarely used since detonation isnt a problem.  Fuel is injected to initiate combustion.  Water injection has been studied as a way to help meet emissions limits (as a kind of assistance to the aftercooler) but I am unaware of it being used in any large scale production engine.  In your case your results may have been affected by humidity but it greatly depends on the exact engine you have.  Humid air takes more energy to heat up, and this combustion temps come down and so does NOx emissions.  Some modern engines with sophisticated aftertreatment systems have sensors that adapt injection timing and aftertreatment or EGR settings based on anticipated NOx production.  Thus its possible (maybe plausible?) that the engines lower NOx output in much more humid conditions enabled it to adapt and improve efficiency.  Generally speaking there is a strong trade off between NOx production and fuel efficiency.  Generally Low NOx engines are less fuel efficient.  Or rather Engines producing Higher NOx through high pressures and peak temperatures are usually more efficient.  So NOx limits - in general - hurt fuel mileage while keeping smog controlled.  Aftertreatment is one way to avoid the combustion based trade-off. But there still exists the connection you just get to move the whole curve.  5mpg sounds like a rather large change, id be surprised if that was all down to humidity.  Its more likley that combined with a tailwind or other favorable conditions you saw that change.  I wouldnt expect calibration changes due to humidity to change efficiency by more than about 5% overall, so at most 30mpg might become 31.5mpg.    To circle back, if such humidity changes are so helpful for NOx reduction why not use water injection instead of the aftertreatment?  Like I say, its been studied and generally the water requirements are heavy, you need large tanks, lots of control mechanisms, and as with Deisel exhaust fluid you need to make sure its pure distilled water.  You run the risk of damaging the engine if anything goes wrong, it can rust and corrode engine parts, its kind of a headache.  Hopefully this answers your questions.  Or just creates more questions :)"

engineering,3csqmx,Nemo222,5,Fri Jul 10 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"The efficiency of any combustion cycle is influenced by the total temperature change you can get out of the combustion cycle. adding cool water into the charge will lower its temperature and is functionally similar to the intercooler on a turbo. The water itself doesn't do much to the combustion itself, it is solely there to increase delta T. This is also the same reason why engines run better in cold air.  However, when the water is in the air, its not changing the temperature but it is changing the latent energy stored in the air and changing the amount of energy the air in the charge can absorb. The engine is trying to hit an exhaust gas target temperature and will either increase the amount of fuel giving you more power, or reduce the throttle giving better efficiency. This change is less noticeable in a combustion cycle as maximum efficiency is limited by delta T which hasn't changed.  Both the change in delta T and the change in energy capacity of the air improve the performance of an engine. you would get both benefits using water injection, but only the latter one in higher humidity.  Old turbojet engines used this technique and would inject water on the high pressure side of the intake compressor, essentially doing the same job as an intercooler for the high pressure air before the combustion chamber. I believe this is also common in marine diesel engines and other large stationary engines."

Also everyone is forgetting the the coefficient of thermal expansion for steam is some 180 times that of  air,  water injection was used on WWII fighter planes during take-off to increase performance under max weight conditions."
engineering,3csqmx,raoulduke25,3,Fri Jul 10 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert in combustion, but I would guess that the difference in fuel economy had nothing to do with the humidity. Injecting water vapour into a combustion doesn't seem like it could have any useful benefits."
engineering,3csqmx,avengingturnip,6,Fri Jul 10 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"That was my original thought too.  Water injection seems so counter-intuitive for ICEs but it can improve engine performance.  In fact, before intercoolers were developed for turbocharged engines, water injection was used to prevent detonation.  It may be that the higher humidity allowed the turbocharged engine to run with a slightly higher total compression improving the gas mileage.  Or not."
engineering,3csqmx,TheRealSpaceTrout,4,Fri Jul 10 14:59:35 2015 UTC,"It could also have to do with the density of the air due to its increased water content. There's less o2 per ""packet"" of air, thus the turbo is working to bring it back to its ""usual"" o2 level. Less gas consumption because the o2 levels in the gas are as if the turbo wasn't there on a cold dry day. So you were driving a less powerful car that day and didn't change your driving habits to compensate.   Totally guessing here.  I think the ECU and the MAF are behind this. I don't think it would happen without that feedback."
engineering,3csqmx,avengingturnip,6,Fri Jul 10 15:45:26 2015 UTC,I think the key is how much the addition of humidity to the mixture changes the specific heat and density and resultant temperature rise due to compression.  If the temperature rise is less for higher humidity air then the turbocharger can precompress to a higher pressure before it bleeds off and the combustion efficiency will increase with the increase in total compression ratio.
engineering,3csqmx,TheRealSpaceTrout,4,Fri Jul 10 15:51:56 2015 UTC,Ooo I didn't consider the change in specific heat. That's a good theory!

Parley., Effects of Water Injection and Increased Compression Ratio in a Gasoline Spark Ignition Engine. Wilson, Thesis, University of Idaho, 2011   I bet it has the answers.  Edit:  I am also thinking that in a turbocharged engine, since the EM system will inject fuel beyond stochiometric just to cool the cylinders, that additional humidity reducing the temps could directly result in less fuel usage too."
engineering,3csqmx,Nemo222,4,Fri Jul 10 16:07:31 2015 UTC,"Modern engines will NOT inject more fuel than can be burnt into a charge to try and cool things down. that drastically reduces efficiency and there are already mechanisms in place for cooling. an engine controlled waste gate valve can blow off extra pressure, a fly by wire throttle (not supper common) can limit the throttle available. and all engines are externally cooled already either by water or air. Why would you add more fuel to cool an engine down when you already have a cooling system?  Water injection works by 2 mechanisms,  1. water cools the charge allowing a greater delta T which brings it closer to the carnot efficicecy limit.  2. water increases the latent heat capacity of the charge allowing more energy to be extracted from combustion reducing fuel requirements."
engineering,3csqmx,avengingturnip,2,Fri Jul 10 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"Peak power is generally produced with a rich mixture and peak efficiency with a lean one.  This is true for all ICEs, not just turbocharged ones.  And yes, making the mixture richer is one method used in turbocharged engines to prevent engine damage - something far more critical than gas mileage to the typical car owner.   The problems of turbocharging that put the nails into its technological coffin the first time around haven’t changed. When you turbocharge an engine, the increased pressure produced by force-feeding extra air into it raises the temperature and pressure in the combustion chamber to the point where the engine wants to self-destruct. The easiest solution to this problem was to reduce the engine’s compression ratio and bring combustion-chamber temperature and pressure back into the survivable range. This was especially true with those early turbos that didn’t even employ intercooling.  Another approach is to run a richer-than-normal mixture, by adding more fuel to the air than is needed for combustion. As the extra fuel evaporates, it cools the combustion chamber and reduces the stresses of turbocharging. Of course, reducing the compression ratio and blowing extra fuel into an engine doesn’t help efficiency."

Modern engines have other methods of controlling the heat in a cylinder.   Cruising down the highway in a modern turbo diesel and that engine should be running happy. I am not saying that these things don't happen, but in this specific example the gains in fuel efficiency can be explained by the heat capacity of the more humid air. Injecting more fuel would decrease fuel economy and is clearly not happening here."

engineering,3cqr4n,Lashway,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:54:44 2015 UTC,"Backlash (engineering):       In mechanical engineering, backlash, sometimes called lash or play, is clearance or lost motion in a mechanism caused by gaps between the parts. It can be defined as ""the maximum distance or angle through which any part of a mechanical system may be moved in one direction without applying appreciable force or motion to the next part in mechanical sequence"" p. 1-8. An example, in the context of gears and gear trains, is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth. It can be seen when the direction of movement is reversed and the slack or lost motion is taken up before the reversal of motion is complete. Another example is in a valve train with mechanical tappets, where a certain range of lash is necessary for the valves to work properly.

engineering,3cqr4n,autowikibot,2,Fri Jul 10 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"If you turn the system one way, it responds nicely -- turning the input a bit further makes the output(s) move a bit further.  If you then start turning the input in the other direction, the output doesn't respond before you have turned the input a few degrees. That is backlash, which is generally a very annoying phenomenon. You can sometimes see it on the steering on old cars.  Another example is precision positioning devices - one we had in the lab had a stepper motor which drove a gear, which then moved an assembly in sub-micron increments over a range of a few mm. Going one way it worked quite nice with the position being equal to ""stroke per step * number of steps"", but once you started going a bit in one direction, reversing and going a bit in the other direction etc., the position was absolutely not given by ""stroke per step * (number of steps in - number of steps out)""."

engineering,3cqr4n,kyrsjo,2,Fri Jul 10 16:31:23 2015 UTC,"You're right about the travel limitation, but I'm not sure how well the rest might be applied.   For rapid transit, many machines use ball screws coupled to servos, which allow for low tolerance movement without backlash. When moving through very large distances as you described, translating motor rotations to movement is much more difficult. Because of thermal movement of the rails, losses of the system, and other considerations, laser positioning is often used. Also remember that tolerances increase with part size.  More fun flexure facts! They can operate in cryogenic environments, consist of multiple stages for more travel, and can operate along several axises. They don't even have to be linear."
engineering,3cqr4n,anon72c,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:41 2015 UTC,"Yea I was actually thinking about laser tracking.  We use flexure stages for positioning of a few millimeters and servomotors and pneumatic drives for positioning up to a few inches.  We use laser tracking for positioning over distances of hundreds of feet.  So instead of using a servomotor for tracking position you could use a laser tracking system, the servomotor would just position the sled with some sort of feedback to your tracking system.  By decoupling this transmission from tracking duty backlash and expansion wouldn't be an issue, it would basically just be an extremely fine positioning system that would work over large distances."

Each worm/worm gear pair reduces the speed of the motor by 1/50th. Since there are 12 pairs of gears, the final speed reduction is calculated by (1/50)12. The implications are quite large. With the motor turning around 200 revolutions per minute, it will take well over two trillion years before the final gear makes but one turn.  Given the truth of this situation, it is possible to do anything at all with the final gear, even embed it in concrete.   Wikipedia lists the actual time for a complete revolution as roughly a mere 13.7 billion years[1] .

We were happy to have him, but the story of how we got him was sad.  He had been working a project involving helicopters.  There was a proposed flight profile for a test.  He had been called in on the Test Readiness Review.  He took one look at it and tried to halt the test.  His argument boiled down to ""That helicopter will not do what you're asking it to do!""  Alas, this is my translation of whatever NedSpeak would have actually come out of his mouth.  The others at the table didn't really know him, blew him off, and two people died when the helicopter went down.  That incident weighed heavily on him (I talked to him about it several times).  He knew what was going to happen but couldn't get anybody to take him seriously, had been unable to stop the test, and couldn't figure out why (I could.  NedSpeak!).  In the end, he left helicopters and moved to missiles because if a flight test for a missile goes badly nobody dies.

engineering,3cud11,LupeKnoble,6,Fri Jul 10 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"The hard disk, at the device level, knows nothing about what is being written or read. It doesn't care if its 1 partition or 12. It doesn't understand what and why data is written - its job is to read data and write data, one block at a time. It has one set of heads, but it uses one at a time, because they are physically moved as a set to where they are reading/writing for each platter surface.   So doing a bunch of stuff at the controller level or the OS level does almost nothing to help the drive read/write faster - once you've optimized the connection to the drive and hand it information in a way it likes, the HD does what the HD does. Read or write one bit at one time onto one side of one platter.   This is why cheetah drives exist - up the rotation speed, up the throughput. The 10k drives were faster at the expense of reliability. So these had been all the rage, until you could raid 5 some cheaper drives and get the same throughput and more reliability - and now SSDs have eclipsed everything in the ""fast HD"" space.   The only real way to get multiple writes and reads from a single drive is to have multiple heads per platter side, which means two separate head arm sets, with two separate controllers controlling the positioning of the two head sets and two separate data queues for feeding data in and out of the two controllers, and a much larger HD management chip, as it is having to watch the data going in at two places instead of one - I bet doing that perfectly is very difficult to when trying to use two heads to write separate blocks in alternating order for continuous reading later. This chip would look very much like a RAID controller, as I understand it.   So you've jammed the functionality of a raid 0 array into a single HD for 50-100% more than the cost of buying 2 drives and a raid controller. Which still suffers from head positioning latency, so it still isn't as good as an SSD, has a static raid 0 inside, but still isn't as fast and space saving as an SSD, and the more sets of heads you add, you get a larger and more complex drive, so it is better in almost every way to separate the drives so a single disk failure (a bad power controller) doesn't bring down your whole raid.   Since manufacturing at scale for consumer drives reduces cost, most people don't need such an expensive drive, so they don't get made. And data center customers are not space conscious  enough to worry about HD storage in this way - they would use an SSD or RAM for such speed critical functions.   If it was a good idea, it would have been done.   And two sets of heads on one spinning platter is something i have never seen done on a modern HD most people could buy.   PS Its not where the data is on the drives that causes things to be slow - it is head positioning.  The heads have to move to a new location, which takes time. This is very very slow compared to an SSD or RAM - they could be sending data by the time the head begun repositioning (80ns vs 6ms). There is no way to speed this up, as it is looking to see what ring it is on.  It then starts reading and writing data to the drive. Waiting for the platter to come around does take a little time - so yea - having the data always on one ""side"" of the platter would be interesting, but you are writing the data twice - so all the speed gains are lost on writes.  This could be handled by an aggressive controller which does the 2nd write when there is idle time, but if you were importing some raw files or video, the ""write again later cache"" on the drive side would fill up in a few seconds, and the drive would have to stop the write and then do the duplicate writes (read-write-read-write) which would drop the throughput of the drive to zero. You'd have to have a huge cache buffer (several GB) just to keep the actual data held for duplicate writing later, because read-write-read-write is even more inefficient.   Now for reads - if the file is more than... 1-2MB? It would have to be split, as every single continuous string of blocks is cut by having the data on both halves of the platter. This means waiting for the platter to rotate, and/or repositioning the head to move to the next non-contiguous set of blocks, which would offer zero read bonus to speed - it would probably be slower.   Maybe there is a scheme for keeping whole platters continuous - the bottom is the same as the top, so all read/writes are done in parallel,  but this would again mean additional read/write controllers (two heads at a time) and some way for the disk to compare the data to confirm its good, and a way for the read/write magnets not to interfere, which would lead to only 2 platter drives, which would rule out small laptop sized 2.5 HDs.   The massive downsides to the continuous writes and reads outweigh the the bonus of faster seeking (sometimes). Continuous ""one after the other "" reading and writing is the basis of HDD operation for decades, and making it more complicated inside the drive usually doesn't work, as i understand it. Its best to move that complexity to an external controller and a have a few discrete drives humming along at maximum efficiency."

engineering,3couhy,prosnoozer,3,Fri Jul 10 02:02:17 2015 UTC,Quantum computing will not decrease transistor size. Its just not possible. The only way to effectively improve is via three dimensional transistor networks. But the underlying transistor size will hit a very real and very hard limit. Besides quantum computers don't magically make computing easier. Quantum computers can only be applied to very specific types of problems. They will never replace the classic silicon chip for every day computing.

At each rotation they get a supervisor, who is supposed to give them small entry level engineer level job assignments as well as have them shadow to meetings and review things.  In they end they are not experts in any one thing, but do get enough exposure to see how things work and a chance to practice their new skills and get good enough to go on their own.  I think of it like behind the wheel training for drivers ed, while their degree was the classroom part, and when they are done they get to be a new driver who is good enough but not great yet.    I went through this program and appreciate it because I got to do a variety of engineering but with a safety net and really not expectation or responsibility to actually do substantial production.    As a supervisor I really like it because I can get engineering help to do things I can't give to a tech, but tend to be simpler but time consuming tasks that take up my time. The only really important part is I am still responsible for the work product even if the grad does it for me, I need to do a review and provide feedback.

engineering,3cmfwv,mindheavy,2,Thu Jul 9 11:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if the torsional stress of the inscribed circle might be lower than that of the square section... Nope, it isn't. The shear stress factor for the circular section is 0.6366 vs. 0.601 for the square. But what's interesting is that on the square, the peak stress is on the middle of the flats, meaning that even after that area yields, more torque is going to be loaded onto the corners of the square, which haven't yet yielded. So the yield region will propagate both inward radially and outward into the corners.  Note that not all of them failed on the socket holder, although the 890 ft-lb one did. Also, ultimate strength can be so much higher than yield. However typically on high heat-treat steels they aren't that far apart.  I once had a very stubborn front sprocket on a vintage sport bike. I tried everything. Went through five 1/2"" drivers before I found one that wouldn't break (a Great Neck) and it still couldn't get the nut off with a 5' breaker bar. A friend asked ""... did you bounce?"" I'm very sad I sold that wrench although I don't really wrench like I used to.  So in that case I was doing maybe 1.5 g bounces and it did break loose finally. I weighed 150 lb at the time, so 4' x 150 lb x 1.5 g = 900 ft-lb."

engineering,3cmfwv,ajandl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:23:28 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to determine if these materials failed at particularly high or low stresses? How are you defining failure, yield or fracture? Of which part? The head, arm, assembly, ratchet?   This isn't the best test set up for testing this, but you could assume the socket head was in pure shear loading. Using Mohr's circle I think you'll find that the shear loads are equal to the principal stresses.   Now that you know the principal stresses you can select a yield criterion. If you want to be conservative you can use the Tresca criterion. This means you won't have to look up the ultimate shear stress or approximate it, instead you can use the ultimate tensile strength. For simplicity, assume that there will be very little plasticity, so a brittle material, which means that any yield will result in fracture.   For the materials that withstood the higher loads, I would guess that they were more ductile, so they could support very high loads before fracturing. However, failure for something like this would usually be determined by the onset of plastic deformation, not fracture."

engineering,3cmfwv,roger_ranter,2,Thu Jul 9 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"4140 with an angry temper can have 145ksi yield in tension = 290ksi in torsion/shear.  Minimum.  Plus, your equation is for tau max, where the whole section sees a wide distribution of shear stresses from zero to max.  So the outer fiber is yielding, while the section is still holding on.  Also, if the outer fiber doesn't exceed twice yield strength when it's cold worked, it will theoretically be able to endure loading after loading.  But you know what they call a regime where it's cold worked too much?  Ratcheting.  Heh."

Is there a basic calc to calculate the failure of the cross section?"
engineering,3cmfwv,roger_ranter,7,Thu Jul 9 04:48:40 2015 UTC,"Ah shit.  It's actually 145/2 = 73ksi, not *2.  Because from mohr's circle, a pure axial load test gives 145ksi tension, which you can transform to 73 ksi pure shear (like torsion gives you) at yield.  So if you load the material in pure shear instead of tension like they do for the test/chart value, you can go up to 73ksi shear at yield (not 290).  And now my explanation's all fucked.  A linear stress distribution for max 410ksi gives an average stress of 205ksi, which is way more than 73.  My only other thought is in the quote FTA: ""the new Craftsman held its max torque level the longest before breaking.""  Maybe the wrenches were loaded quickish, yielding the whole time to rupture, and the testers were impatient.  But you can see that the fracture was brittle as fuck, so it was sudden, not smeary.  So how'd they do it?  Magic.  QED."

engineering,3cne8t,theholyraptor,3,Thu Jul 9 15:32:18 2015 UTC,"You can either get manufacturing prints and models from the engineer who designed it and go to ANY shop to make it that'll give you the time of day, or work with the engineer to bring you anywhere from a functional prototype to a batch of product to millions of them depending on your needs.  Your needs and the design requirements may dictate that as well.  A one off piece may be machined but if you need 10000 of them you might need molds made for injection molding etc.  Unless the mechanical engineer isn't interested in assisting you through the end, most probably will as part of the job.  Someone said the engineer won't make it and that is half true.  Another user here and I are both mechanical engineers and machinists.  Even if for most engineers that's not the case,  as I discussed above the engineer will be designing it for manufacturing  (though some are shittier then others at that) and be intimately involved in its manufacture even if they aren't the ones running the machines and making the chips."

Yes, I'm a noob at this stuff and that's why I'm paying someone to do it for me.   The part is three separate pieces.   1 rubber piece  1 plastic (debating on metal)  1 spring piece  Held together by bolts or screws."
engineering,3cne8t,CardboardHeatshield,3,Sat Jul 11 08:28:41 2015 UTC,"The drawings and model are the universal way of communicating what you need machined.  From there, the shop has free reign to do whatever they want as long as they meet the print.  For example, if you had a piece of aluminum with a 3in length and the tolerance of plus or minus 0.1in they might make it with a cnc mill or they might use a cold saw.  If the tolerance were plus or minus .0005in they'd probably need to cut to size then grind to final size.  This is where the engineering is important. If you made a drawing and specified everything as plus or minus  .001in cause you don't know whats needed, it'll be harder for the shop to make and they will charge more to make it.  You also need good prints that convey everything critical and important about the part.  If you leave something ambiguous the shop doesn't know any better and sometimes shops are good and ask but they arent obligated to.  Just this week a coworker told a shop to rush a job and skip a plating requirement that takes a long time and instead anodize it. Well there's different types of anodizing and he didn't specify so the vendor assumed wrong. The print is essentially your contract specifying what you need.  As to how they make it, they could do it on a manual machine by hand or with hand tools depending on requirements. Or they'll take your drawing or 3d model and put it in cam software to write gcode to run a cnc or they could write the gcode manually if its simple enough."
engineering,3clonp,CheefReef,12,Wed Jul 8 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, you do not need to have your professional engineering license to practice as any type of lawyer. However, it can make a minor difference dependent upon what you end up doing.  For 99% of lawyer jobs, you only need to go to law school and subsequently pass the MPRE (ethics bar exam essentially) and the bar exam in order to practice.   The only area of the law that requires additional certification is patent prosecution, which is the filing of patents. This is not the litigation of patents. This is simply the filing of patents. In order to become a patent agent, you need to sit for the patent bar exam. This exam is a 100 question multiple choice open-book exam that lasts six hours and deals with Title 35 of the U.S. Code (patents). In order to sit for this exam, you need to have a ""technical"" degree or background. There are six different categories that qualify your background to sit for the patent bar. The most common is category A. But with regards to your PE license, you can look at category C or one of the other catch all categories in order to qualify. A PE does not qualify as an FE for these purposes, but perhaps there is some crossover in that area I'm unaware. Either way, if you have a PE, you likely have a qualifying degree under category A, and therefore don't have to worry about the other categories.  All that being said, you take the patent bar and pass it, you are now a ""patent agent"". You can file patents, but you can't give legal advice about them. That is the job of a ""patent attorney"", which requires a law degree and a bar exam passing.   So, long story short, you don't need a PE license to practice any type of law, however, it is one way of qualifying you to become a patent attorney. It should also be noted that once you pass the patent bar, you can file claims for any kind of patent. You don't need to have a degree in chemistry to do pharmaceuticals or a mechanical degree to file for machinery. You simply need to pass the patent bar.  Now, does having a PE license help? A qualified yes. It will definitely be a resumé booster for both patent prosecution jobs and patent litigation jobs because it shows that you understand the underlying substantive material. It's not necessary, but it will get you the job. Assuming you have the same knowledge as a PE (but without the certification), you will likely be more than fine without the PE license.   To be an expert witness, you don't need any background in law whatsoever. That really isn't a legal job at all. It is just someone examining you in your area of expertise. Of course it could help you to have an understanding of legal concepts to be a better expert witness, but it won't matter much because a good lawyer will prepare you and question you in the right way so as to cover his ass on the legal part. As an expert witness, you have to pass the Daubert test, which basically says you have to be competent in the field as an expert. That's where a PE comes in. It's an indicator that you are an expert in that field. You don't need it to be an expert, but a lawyer won't likely hire you without one because he has other better options."

And I am actually curious as to how that would effect it.    In my eyes the compressor is having to work harder because of the obstruction.  So maybe it does matter.
engineering,3cm547,gizzard_n_pepper,3,Thu Jul 9 00:20:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the flow rate.  If the pressure drop of the heat exchanger goes down, your flow rate through the whole system is going to go up.  The pressure delivered at the compressor discharge will land somewhere on the performance curve."
engineering,3cm547,Hammbo,2,Thu Jul 9 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"This is correct. If your downstream pressure on the heat exchanger remains the same the outlet should remain at eight psi.   Therefore, the inlet would be at 10, but you'd have to use the compressor curve to determine if the increased flow rate at this lower output pressure would then change the pressure dynamics across the rest of the system."

We need the type of compressor (centrifugal / positive displacement) and its performance.  We need to know the regulation of the compressor  :    constant speed or variable speed ? if variable speed : flow setpoint ? pressure setpoint ? if pressure setpoint, where is the pressure measured : at the compressor outlet ? at the HEX outlet ?   At last, we need to know if equipments/valves up stream and downstream to the HEX might influence the pressure / flowrate.   Simple case : centrigugal, constant speed => Pressure at the HEX inlet should drop to somewhere between 10 and 18 PSI. Strange case : centrigugal, constant speed, fixed-flow valve downstream the HEX => Pressure at the HEX inlet won't change."

It's for air blowers but the principle is the same for any fluid. If the total delta P of your system is low you can assume air is incompressible (constant density) to simplify the problem.

engineering,3cm547,TeignmouthElectron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:06:02 2015 UTC,From your explanation I don't understand what the issue really is. I don't see why the heat exchanger has a set pressure drop. Is that data published for a given flow rate? If the system is air and we take the compression into account this problem becomes very complicated.  The question about what type of compressor and what is regulating the compressor is also very important to ask.   Another thing to think about is how the volume of the fluid is influenced by the temperature. This gets back into compressible fluids and makes the problem pretty complicated. What is the delta T across the heat exchanger?
engineering,3cm547,TheTrueLordHumungous,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:51:54 2015 UTC,"The inlet pressure to the heat exchanger depends on what type of compressor you have. A centrifugal compressor operates on a curve (flow vs pressure), and will run at the pressure and flowrate where the system resistance allows it to operate. This information should be obtainable from the manufacturer. The maximum pressure is what is called shut-off head. A positive displacement compressor will push a constant volume, no matter what the system resistance, and therefore will continue to raise the pressure. So for a given rotational speed, the flow vs pressure curve is near vertical, however this information should also be available from manufacturer or the internet"

FYI: 1500 lb tension, ~1.1"" wide belt.  The reason I ask is that one of the pins for our rollers got bent, and I'm trying to determine why none of the other pins were bent.

I don't remember any mechanism that would change the speed of the reel though, but it would make sense to have one. Maybe bigger projectors that show more than 20 mins of film at a time have something to adjust for that.  Edit: actually, using a belt here would allow for the reel to slip, which would automatically slow it down as the effective radius of the reel increased.

Doesn't it just pull the film gently all the time and lets the rest of the mechanism set the speed?  Edit: A slightly more advanced way would be to sense how taut the film is (by letting the film loop around a little pins that moves when the tightness of the film exceed some threshold) and regulate the back reel based on that."

What that study says to me is that many people in the engineering profession have taken jobs that don't necessarily directly relate to the field of engineering. An engineer can work in a variety of fields. Not only that, does that study account for people that have left ontario and decided to work out of province or out of country? Many people earn degrees in ontario, and then move to another province or country. But that study simply looks at 'number of people who earned degrees in ontario VS people who work engineering jobs in ontario"".   I have a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering at a university in southern ontario, and decided to pursue a graduate degree in thermofluids purely out of interest, that pays surprisingly well. My thesis project is directly funded by industry, and every now and again I get the opportunity to do presentations to executives. Pretty much everyone I know from undergrad got an industry job in engineering within 4 months. So don't worry, there's plenty of jobs out there. Just be prepared to apply to literally every posting you see. Don't limit yourself to a specific field necessarily. And if you see a job that requires '1-2 years of work experience' , apply anyway. What the harm? Perhaps they'll consider that 1 year of Formula SAE sufficient. Don't close doors by simply not applying.   Edit : oh ya, do not quit your program. You will be in much better shape with an engineering degree than pretty much any other undergrad degree. With engineering you can do exactly what that study seems to suggest, work in fields outside of engineering should you have to. (Finance, etc)"
engineering,3cjmi6,youngster18,2,Wed Jul 8 12:42:10 2015 UTC,The engineering challenge of biofuels is to reduce the energy required to purify fuel from plant material.  I've always thought that this would ultimately be a genetic engineering problem.   Biofuels are sustainable but they may also contribute to food shortages which needs to be addressed.

I wonder what kind of operating cost would attract lets say corn farmers to grow algae instead?"
engineering,3cjmi6,indyphil,3,Thu Jul 9 13:53:07 2015 UTC,"here are my feelings on Biofuel, as someone who works for an engine manufacturer and has more than a passing interesting in the oil industry:  Corn Ethanol appears (from what I can tell) to be wash in terms of energy in (via diesel and fertilizer, and processing energy and transport since it cant be sent through pipelines) to energy out.  Thus Corn Ethanol is basically a farm subsidy.  It uses the same amount of fossil fuel to produce it, so its not really saving anything.  Cellulosic ethanol has the potential to use less diesel and fertilizer but current methods seem to use more processing energy (electricity) so its not very economically feasible to compete with fossil fuel.  Admittedly you could argue fossil fuels are somewhat subsidized.  electricity could be generated by non fossil means, so this has some promise.  Seems to be slow to develop though.  Biodiesel has some promise, generally the engines are ready for it, at least in blends.  Its cleaner (no sulphur) so it meets the demands of modern low emission engines.  But again currently its not very competitive with fossil fuels with the oil prices so low.  There are of course a couple of different ways of using biodiesel.  Oils - fats - just heated and burned, or actual biodiesel made from other longer chains, but processed to mimic the regular hydrocarbons.  the french fry oil method isnt going to catch on with major machine or engine manufacturers because of the hassle with heating it and cold weather and such.  thats for garage tinkering - besides its only economical using waste oil on a small scale.  If you have to buy your fuel in larger quantities its not economical.  Leaving what I think of as real Biodiesel - B20 or higher blends.    The problems are all going to be related to energy in vs energy out and competing with the currently fairly low price of oil.  If you use renewable energy for processing or harvesting thats great but renewable energy (wind, solar etc...) is capital intensive.    Not to mention ethanol for example is kind of a hassle to deal with.  for lawn mowers and seasonal equipment its downright destructive stuff and pisses people off.  upping the blend ceiling to 15% or 20% is a big fight between farm subsidy types and engines with carburetors wont tolerate it well anyway."
engineering,3cjmi6,Kammaol,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:01:54 2015 UTC,"Additionally to that: Biodiesel is a bitch to clean from particulate matter using DPF's (diesel particulate filters). It has higher vapor temperature so during regeneration cycles, when you pollute your oil with fuel it won't evaporate as regular diesel would causing problems."
engineering,3cjmi6,NineCrimes,0,Wed Jul 8 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with your take on Ethanol. I think its not very economically feasible, especially corn ethanol. While I'm griping about energy I'd also say Wind Turbines are overrated.   My main interest and ideas would be to retrofit farms, who use primarily diesel, to convert to Biodiesel. I think that this has the best chance of success. Almost acting like a consulting agency and teaching and supplying farmers with the knowledge and tools they need to become fully self sufficient in terms of fuel. I'm no expert, as I said I'm only 23, but this is my goal someday."

engineering,3cjmi6,NineCrimes,2,Wed Jul 8 13:26:25 2015 UTC,"Well, again I'm no expert so this is my opinion, and the last thing I want to do is look like an idiot.   So I live in Ontario and there are multiple reports and papers as to why the wind energy here is a waste of time and money, but this could be argued to be the governments fault for going at the implementation of the technology all wrong, and handling the whole situation very poorly.  In my personal opinion, I think solar makes more sense than wind at this point. I don't know pricing and statistics, but wind energy seems to be a massive investment, you need to basically bribe people to put a noisy turbine on their land. They only have a life span of 20 years, have moving parts so they must have some sort of O&M costs and , i could be wrong here because I was told this, wind turbines cause a set amount of land around them to essentially be ""dead"" where it can not be used.   I'm not saying solar is 100% the solution, because I think solar farms are the biggest waste of farm land ever. Put those panels on industrial rooftops, pay them a fraction of the subsidy that you would to a farm family. Give them a ""we're going green, we love the environment"" or some kind of sticker so they can brag. From what I've heard, panels only require to be cleaned and have a longer lifespan than turbines.  Whether or not they produce more energy or are more cost effective is up for debate because I have no clue, I'm just trying to think logically. We have all of this rooftop space that could be used for solar panels, even one panel on each rooftop would have a world of difference. Granted this brings it's own issues, but i honestly think that this would be a better option"
engineering,3cjmi6,Hapten,2,Wed Jul 8 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"You appear to be looking at this from a bit of a 1-sided perspective. First off, wind is far cheaper per kwh than PV solar right now, so the cost effectiveness aspect definitely works towards their advantage. You're correct that they usually put them on farm land and pay the owner a subsidy, but that's mainly because it's just easier than putting them somewhere else. Consider that solar farms effectively require the same thing, and actually require more surface area to produce the same amount of electricity.   Now, as far as operational costs, they're both going to have them. Solar panels need to be cleaned and have their mounting equipment maintained.   As for limited lifespans, wind turbines have been estimated to be operational from 20-25 years before needing an upgrade. Solar panels don't last indefinitely though. The general rule of thumb is that they lose around .8-1% a year of production capacity.    We have all of this rooftop space that could be used for solar panels, even one panel on each rooftop would have a world of difference. Granted this brings it's own issues, but i honestly think that this would be a better option   I'm not sure how it is where you live, but where I am a lot of buildings do this already. The issue is you can't cram as many as you might think up there. You have lots of equipment and vents that need space, plus you need room for maintenance people to move about.   Look, I'm a huge supporter of both wind and solar, and they both have markets that they're going to excel in. What I don't think we should be doing, however, is focusing on one to the detriment of the other. They're both rapidly improving, and while wind tends to have a cost advantage at the moment, I think they're both necessary for a future that doesn't require massive fossil fuel use."

I'm very naive to the subject and don't have anyone to debate about and learn from around here so this is good. I'm just trying to think in a logical way and it just doesn't make sense to me   I also think that we need a good balance between all of the renewable energies to have them be fully effective in order to get rid of our dependency of fossil fuels.  I'm from a small town and all our municipality seems to be doing is popping up wind turbines absolutely everywhere and throwing money at it to try and prove that it's working, when all they are doing is charging us far more for energy. I am very bias towards this topic because I just can't see how the wind energy is profitable, or even sustainable at this rate, and It seems that nobody around here has even considered solar energy. They're putting all their eggs in the wind turbine basket.  I'll research up on these topics so see which is actually more cost effective because me debating right now is essentially useless."

It sounds like you're still in school so I'll tell you something right now, you generally won't offend most engineers by talking about things like this, even if you disagree (at least in my experience).   Like I said, these technologies are very area specific. Where you live, solar may make way more sense than wind. Additionally, while I think both will continue to advance and get cheaper, I think solar has a lot more potential advancement left than wind before we start seeing dimishing returns on the R&D."

engineering,3cjmi6,wwjz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"The biggest downfall of renewable energy is flexibility. Wind comes when it wants and solar requires ton of property and management. I am not too familiar with solar but I know that you need people to clean them often because birds fly over them and get roasted all the time. Just maintaining solar panels is a pain and not worth it for how much energy they produce.   Natural Gas is very cheap and very flexible compare to renewable energy. I don't see us moving away from it anytime soon. I am pretty sure that the cost of maintaining a gas turbine running combine cycle is a lot less than a solar farm.   So, unless we can find a way to make renewable energy flexible, we will depend on fossil fuels for a long time. The place I work at have to PAY people to take our renewable energy from us since there is not a good way to store energy.   As for biofuel, biofuel is a joke. There is just so much cost associated with it that it is not economical. There is storage and transportation cost, all on top of the cost of producing it. Most of the cost is probably going to be in transportation contracts and at that point you are better off with fossil fuel because it is cheaper and produces more energy."

If you flattened out at that level and have to pay rent on your own for a studio or 1 bedroom apartment anywhere decent, it could easily take you 10 years being frugal to save up a down payment for a condo, and much more for a fixer-upper of a house! But it's a great area.  On the original question, I wouldn't feel too bad, especially if you don't have concrete tasks and milestones. When I first started my job, it took almost a month for them to even get me a computer. There will be times when you sit your ass down and focus and do great things, and there will be times where you kind of twiddle your thumbs a bit, I think it's normal. You might consider spending your downtime just coding up things or experimenting on things that are interesting to you and could be reasonably relevant to your actual job. I personally have some things like that that I've been wanting to do (certain open source things) but every time I get five minutes into it, I find that I actually have real work to keep me away from it!

Running numbers to make it comparable to your example:  Take home on that 100k would be around $66k.  Toss out 18k - 27k / year ($1500/mo to $2,250/mo, which I bet is a typical range) for rent in that area.  That leaves $39k - $48k/year.

You're doing early R&D and information gathering. Most projects I worked on got really hectic when we were actively getting the design finished, so a little ebb and flow is good.   Some companies I worked at crammed all the projects together so there was never any downtime and 50 hour work weeks were minimum. Some people loved that work environment but it burned me out as I got older.  Other companies have too much downtime all the time, overstaffed, poorly run etc. You'll likely move around and experience different work cultures, especially here in the bay area.   Make the most of your first job, learn as much as you can. It is perfectly ok to have some down time, but I ended up using my downtime to learn about the business, go talk to people, find out how the company runs, who makes decisions, figure out what's good and bad about my group and other groups.  Often times I've found people in other groups who will light up and love to talk about their jobs and what they do. It is very insightful to see how small and large businesses operate.   I've learned some interesting things doing this, and it probably made me look like a go-getter to my managers. I was just curious and enjoy talking to people.

Weeks like that I might do 65 or 70 hours, skip all lunch breaks, cut my input down to what is critical for me specifically to do (like sketch something by hand rather than do it in cad), rush through meetings with people just focusing on the immediately necessary elements, etc and STILL find myself behind...... But other times things are damn slow. I've definitely done an entire week where I haven't actually accomplished anything productive.   Then there's still more occasions when you're not idle but also not hugely busy so you put a bit more time and effort in to things, dot your i's and cross your t's. Those are the weeks you can take some pride in your work and really put out some good stuff. When you write a VBA macro or something, and everyone starts using it because its really handy.

I think there's some false expectation that you need to work insane hours per week to be an entrepreneur. Or should I say not every business model needs that.  So I spend a lot of time ""automating"" my business more in terms of knocking out as many man hours as possible between customers buying product and me shipping.  I've gotten it way down, but not nearly as much as I would like.   That being said the daily work generally does not require a huge amount of my input save for fulfillment and so I continue to work full-time until I'm in a position financially to go solo. 100K in net sales is not enough to go solo, but more than enough to keep the business moving forward cash positive.  No automation in terms of programming, I can't program and I'm not selling E-books or drop shipping, I design consumer products, and I have several that are active not just one, and I've got two more I'm launching.

You design a product, presumably  with solidworks/creo, get it manufactured, then ship it out, then profit.

I think the hot business right now is subscription boxes and plenty of college kids have started those successfully, I don't think I would have attempted this in college or I would have got stalled along the way.  The other big thing is that you have to design and market something that people actually want to buy, i think most engineers (myself included) suck at marketing and product design because it relies on different rules than what you are taught in engineering school.

We were installing a repaired circulating water pump, and I was the engineer that oversaw the whole deal (Inspection, Repairs, Drawings, Buyouts, etc.), and I botched it.  The upper shaft was replaced, but we reused the pump-half coupling and the coupling adjusting nut (To set the lift of the impeller off the running surface).  I spec'd R.H. threads on the shaft, because thread direction doesn't matter in the application and that's pretty standard (Bolts run through the keyed pump-half coupling, through the adjusting nut, and into the motor-half of the coupling, preventing the nut from advancing or backing off).  Turns out the nut/original shaft was L.H. threads.  First time I'd come across that.  Oh well, I made a drawing for the new nut (With R.H. threads) and sent it into my work.  They got someone machining on it right away.  It wasn't a big (up-front) cost mistake....  Except we had sub-contracted riggers and millwrights to perform a turn-key install.  This mistake cost us an extra couple days of labor (where we did nothing), a few extra days of me being in a hotel (over the weekend), and a senior engineer made the drive out (5 hours or so) with the new nut to finish off the install and oversee everything and make sure our customer was happy.  So I got to look like I didn't know what I was doing.  The place we were at is going to pull their other pumps in the next few years (Haven't been serviced, ever, as far as we can tell.  Drawings date them to 1970s, they run sporadically based on river conditions).  Sooo... Just hope that my mistake wasn't so off-putting that they do use us again.  TL;DR:  Made small mistake, and I knew it.  Probably cost my company in the neighborhood of 7-10k (initially).  Potentially costing us hundreds of thousands in lost revenue if the customer thinks we are incapable of servicing their equipment because of my SNAFU."

engineering,3cfe1r,ForeTheTime,5,Tue Jul 7 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"This... is far too complicated a question to be asking on reddit.  an upper bound I would say is take the maximum cross section area of the shrapnel, apply an acceleration of    Time * Pressure in Vessel at Rupture*Area/Mass of Shrapnel   integrate and that is your upper bound velocity as a function of time.  the real problem is going to be determining how long the pressure is actually acting on the shrapnel, and how quickly the pressure in the vessel will drop with a shrapnel sized hole in it.   These heavily depend on the size of the vessel, size of the shrapnel, and pressure of the gas in the vessel before rupture.  Also, you would have to add any effects by the 'explosion in tank' you mentioned."
engineering,3cfe1r,dirtyuncleron69,3,Tue Jul 7 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"also recall that a good deal of initial energy is in the material itself in terms of elastic deformation, when a pressure vessel goes it's acting as a sling shot so velocity is not based on gas pressure alone.  This is why fiberglass or CF pressure vessels tend to fail safer as they have very little elastic regime."
engineering,3cfe1r,metarinka,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.  I have simplified equations for how the pressure interacts with the shrapnel.  I was just thinking there might be a simple way to obtain a pressure drop curve.
engineering,3cfe1r,dirtyuncleron69,3,Tue Jul 7 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"If you assume that the gas inside flows out at the speed of sound for the conditions, you can calculate a mass flow rate    (area * speed of sound) * density.   I would probably assume adiabatic calculations for this, and see what you get using simply the ideal gas law.  If the tank is big and the hole is small, it's probably safe to assume constant velocity for the gas escaping, but if the mass flow rate you come up with is a significant portion of the total mass in the tank, you'll probably have to account for the pressure decreasing in the tank as gas leaks out."
engineering,3cfe1r,crux510,2,Tue Jul 7 14:58:01 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind that typically a pressure vessel will either fracture completely or form a small leak when they fail. Look up air compressor explosions on YouTube for examples of pressure vessels fracturing.

Someone else will have to take the job eventually, so moving to another job might save yourself in the short term, but you're helping the business screw over another worker.

The real solution is a lawsuit and organizing a union.  Moving to another job is only so easy because we work in professions in which the demand to supply ratio is higher than in other professions where workers are more easily replaceable and there is a large surplus labor pool. This may only be a temporary historical anomaly. Engineering may become as easily replaceable and de-skilled as garbage-collecting.

They're process simulating programs and are quite expensive. Your university or employer likely has a license for one or the other if you work with fluids.   Alternatively, you could calculate this yourself. Pick a desired volumetric flow rate and divide it by your desired fluid velocity to obtain the needed cross sectional area of the pipe or orifice.

engineering,3cgqml,cn1ght,2,Tue Jul 7 19:56:26 2015 UTC,"Your calculations are off, however I don't have the correct answers for you. First a 5V battery doesn't make sense, lithium cells are 3.7V each so it is likely a 7.4V 16,000mAh battery with a 5V regulator. This will throw off your energy calculations. There are also charging losses as the batteries approach topping off. If you leave your solar charger attached to the phone for long periods you can achieve long periods of on time with no reduction in battery life.  There is more value to this exercise than the cost of electricity, as a learning experience putting together a reliable and portable usb power supply is a great learning experience."
engineering,3cgqml,slopecarver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:13:25 2015 UTC,"Looking at the solar panel I linked to, the solar panel has 5V output.  The battery does not state what voltage it uses.  I agree that 5V seems wrong for a battery, but it was based off of what the solar panel generates.  Also the wall-outlet charger I have sitting next to me claims to have a 5V output.  As such the calculations are correct as the power going to the battery (what I pay for or can not pay for due to solar panel) is 5V and that is what must be used for the calculations.  In terms of charging losses, these should exist for both the outlet and the solar panel so I decided to simply ignore them as they would cancel each other out.  On second thought, the charging losses are not irrelevant as it is that much more power I am saving by not using the wall-outlet...  You are correct about the value of this exercise.  I gave the thread a very bad name as it is more focused on the cost of energy storage than anything else anyway.  I do agree that this could be a great learning experience for finding out trade-offs of cost/performance.  One of the replies I gave someone I found a battery which costs $8, but only gets 500 or so charges and holds less charge.  Now, in terms of performance this is a large downgrade, however in terms of $/performance it is a huge boost which makes this project have less of a negative value.

I am not seeing ""Lithium Iron"" in any sensible price on Amazon for what I have in mind for this small project.  Same for a quick glance through Google.  Sure, Lithium Ion may cost much more on a $/aH, but I can get a Lithium Ion battery for between $8-$38 with USB built-in and I cannot find anything with Lithium Iron below $70 and I still need some way to get that into a USB connection."

It is still not at break-even (even ignoring the cost of solar panels), however the numbers get rather close...  Is that sarcasm or an actual comment about the Tesla Power Wall (which this is the first I have heard of it)?  Part of the thing is that (from the limited experience I have) batteries do not have a good scale.... The price goes up in direct relation to the amount of storage you need generally speaking.  Actually, in some ways they scale badly as once you pass a certain point you need to worry about extra things such as eye-wash stations and ventilation.

There is pretty much no case that I can see where it would be cost effective as an alternative to grid power.  The only way that storing energy in batteries makes sense for home power is in totally off-grid applications, e.g. a cabin in an isolated area. Where you have grid power, even expensive power in Hawaii, batteries are too expensive."
engineering,3cgqml,inqrorken,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that the main thing as to why I am looking at using a battery at all is that a solar panel is not a reliable source of power, whereas a battery charged from the solar panel would be a reliable source of power.  Now, someone did mention that I could replace the external battery with a capacitor and gain the benefit of smoothed out D/C power from that rather than using a battery.  However, it is not that I am concerned about say voltage spikes, it is that I am concerned about there not being any sunlight when I want to charge the phone.  In that case, I gain the benefit of solar panels to have this tiny thing of my smartphone being off-the-grid 100% at any time because I am storing the energy in a battery for whenever I want to charge my phone.  I think you took my project idea, decided that you could take the time to bash the Tesla battery idea, and have totally forgotten that these are 2 different scenarios.  The Tesla battery seems to be as an emergency backup for when power is lost and it can power a fridge or something for an extended period of time.  The project I am asking about is for a phone where it needs to be charged every day or every other day once for a small duration.  Because of the vastly different scopes in these ideas (Tesla versus smartphone charged) the Tesla cost is out of proportion (I think we both agree) to the benefit most of the time by a very large amount (let's use a random number of 7X).  The project I am asking about seems to be off by a factor of 2 plus or minus (if I go with a cheaper battery which I found and ALSO take the solar panel cost into account).  I suspect I can tweak things a bit on my particular scenario by adding in USB fans powered off of the solar panel, charging my bike LED lights, and probably other things in the future such as potentially a laptop battery charger if I rarely use the laptop (a tablet is already a valid item, I simply lack a tablet).

engineering,3cbjwi,slopecarver,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"Spoilers create downforce to push the car down to keep the frame low and give the tires more traction. Think of a spoiler like an upside-down airplane wing (lift is going towards the ground). Without a spoiler, a relatively light and aerodynamic car traveling at high speeds will only need a slight disturbance before it becomes airborne. It's no surprise that the only race car without a rear spoiler went flying after a slight nudge. Watch any Formula 1 crash and you'll see that the cars try to flip upside down if they go airborne and seem to ""float"" before crashing back down.  Hope this helps.   EDIT: Apparently my comment is entirely off-base even though it is almost verbatum what my aerodynamics prof. taught us about car spoilers. Granted, we only talked about them for <5 min, so while it's true that they do generate downforce via a lifting body, the utility of this is for reducing drag by keeping the air attached to the body in a turbulent flow - not keeping the car low and increasing tire traction."
engineering,3cbjwi,darthchurro,3,Tue Jul 7 04:26:24 2015 UTC,"That car did not flip because it lacked a wing, that had nothing to do with it... It flipped because the red F458 hit the black F430 at angle that cause it to climb the rear fender of the F430.  Once the flat bottom of the car was high enough to create a pocket of air under the car it acted like a sail and caused the car to become air born. You could have a rear wing like a Suzuki monster hill climb car and it will still fly if it gets an air pocket under it. The other cars stability had very little to do with the wing as well, it was a very minor touch.  With the proper conditions you don't even need to hit a car to produce this type of lift effect just a hill or crest can cause it, or following a car too closely with a bad aero package.

A lot of the times these big wrecks are not intentional but a result of the massive air disruption from cars going 3 or 4 wide down the track. The cars in the middle of the bunch have the least amount of control and it is easy for the to lose control and bump other drivers.   Drivers have a pit crew and one guys job is to watch his driver, the spotter , so when a big wreck happens like this in front of them it's the spotters job to tell him which way to go to avoid wrecking as well."
engineering,3cf310,bwhitso,2,Tue Jul 7 12:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'd approach it from a resistive force POV. Sure, you push the slush out of the way, but you could also imagine a neverending road of slush, where each bit of moved slush is instantly replaced by new slush. From that, I'd make the assumption of it being a constant force against the direction of motion.   Secondly, could you make the assumption that once slush gets compacted to ""x"" level, the slushlump gets big enough to be pushed away from the truck.  So, if you could generate an idea of the force required to compact slush to this slushlump, you'd have a reasonable idea of the resistive force against your motion - and from there how much energy is wasted as a percentage of the energy to roll on regular tarmac.  I'm mentally justifying this by comparing a truck with, say, a skateboard. A truck will get through most slush by having loads more momentum, big wheels with inertia etc. A skateboard will not get through any slush as you'll never generate the force (or maybe it's pressure) to turn slush into a slushlump.  Does that help? I think that'd be my first point for making assumptions anyway."

Would be a very similar situation that would allow you to see what order of magnitude you'd be looking at.    There would be some kind of buoyancy coming into play that would also reduce traction with slush.  Snow might not move out of the way as much as compact.

For two tires of the same pressure, diameter, width, weight, speed, tread profile, and rubber compound, how much more energy will it take to roll through slush than roll on a control surface (dry asphalt). Is it twice as much energy? Five times as much energy? 0.1 times as much energy?  Hope that clarifies."

If you can estimate how far forward the contact patch center moves, and multiply this by the vertical load, you will have the RR moment MY.  If you know how far the slush is thrown out the side of the tire, you can find the work per unit length it took to move it that far.  Basically take a cross section of the slush, and compute the center of area.  Take this distance, with an estimated mass of slush and time of slush movement, and you have a work/energy/power calculation depending on how you do it.  From this you can compute the work/energy/power it took to move that slush.  The basic idea is that the work done moving the slush is the same as the drag on the tire."

It was a robust program and had a function that let the user read in a csv of elements with custom data labels (stress color plot and thickness text plot, for example). Problem was his export was a horrible format for getting a clean csv file. I wrote a GUI application that read the output folder and provided the data (millions of elements and even more nodes) in an easy-to-read tabbed window. The user could filter data based associated data labels (stresses, deflections, coordinates, element/node id), transform 3-d stresses, save/export, and some other stuff. It provided a quick and easy way to weed elements that might not fit a criteria and quickly plot custom data on his model.   I had also re-written a lot of excel/vba based analysis tools my group used with Python. Sometimes bringing execution times down from 5 minutes to less than a second. Very powerful stuff. And it can all stay in excel since you can call python from vba or vice-versa. Some people don't like change.   In my civil job we were working on a contract to gather data for all the airports in my state, so I wrote a web scraping tool that went to a couple hundred FAA airport pages and grabbed data and dumped it into a spreadsheet  I wrote a tool to check confidence shots from a surveyor that are meant to ensure a roadway is being built to elevations specified in the design. My program basically re-built a Civil 3D roadway alignment in memory and identified the closest matching alignment and survey points and calculated offsets and elevations. Went from manually checking each point to one-time execution that was seconds compared to hours.   I developed a little script to keep track of my hours throughout the day so I can generate a summary each week for my time sheet.   Wrote a tool that counts the pages of a pdf and breaks out page sizes for tracking printing costs  I built a tool that analyzes bid tabulations for past projects we've advertised. The tool looks at our cost estimate and compares it with the bids we received in order to better refine our estimates in the future.

During times of high run-off and wind, hydro power is the first to get curtailed because its not a renewable energy source (state law). Because the majority of the dams are run-of-the-river, any water coming at the dam needs to get passed through it by either generating power or spilling. Spilling has the added effect of increasing total dissolved gas which is harmful to fish. So when hydro power is curtailed, the dams will start to spill, gassing the fish.  Since the dams are required by a federal order not to operate like this, there is a hard limit to how much you can curtail their generation. Any other curtailment has to come from wind.  And BPA has done this before and got sued for it. Competing 2 renewable sources against each other was asinine. But these guys keep building them because of the tax credits."

I have to head out for the remainder of the day, but I will try to give you the basic idea behind the method of analysis.   The impact load must be converted to a total energy amount, i.e. a force times a distance, meaning if you drop a 1 kN weight from 1 metre, your total energy is 1 kN-m. The beam will deflect on impact and this deflection will be a function of the energy applied to the beam. So you need to characterise the deflection as an internal energy. All beams in linear elastic deformation follow a linear path: F = kx where F is the force applied and x is the deflection. You need to solve for k to determine the spring constant. This value is in units of force/distance and is a function of the bending stiffness of the beam and its length. You can use simple beam equations to determine k. The total energy in a linear spring is equal to E = (1/2) k x2 . You know the energy in the system from the impact load you calculated in step 1. You know the spring constant from step 2. Now you can solve for the deflection x. With the energy, the spring constant, and the deflection, you can now solve for F, which is equal to F = kx. With this force you can solve for the stress in the beam.   Hope this helps. I will be out, but if you have further questions, I can answer them later this afternoon."

But I'm not quite sure about step 1, is it not correct to use the kinetic energy of the falling object at the point of impact instead?   If the transfer of kinetic energy to work done on the structure is: (1/2) mv2 = F d, and if we choose to use the RHS, should we not use the distance where the object works against the structure's resistance after impact? And conversely, if we want to use the LHS, we take the drop distance to find final velocity before impact? I can't quite make sense of drop distance being used in F*d in this context when we want the energy being transferred into the beam"
engineering,3cbhnl,barfobulator,3,Mon Jul 6 18:21:30 2015 UTC,"Drop distance before impact is used to find the kinetic energy. If you get the kinetic energy from the mass and speed instead, that works, too.   To find the deflection, convert that kinetic energy into the energy stored in the deflection of the structure (strain energy) by treating the structure as a spring where E=1/2Kx2. Once you have the deflection x, find the force by K*x. You need to know the structure's stiffness, K."

I believe that the correct approach would be to use dynamics, assuming that the load ""hits and sticks"", you would use a unit step (Heaviside funtion). Here is the structural response to the step function (taken from Chopra's book). As you can see the ""maximum dynamic response"" is twice that of the static response if we assume 0 damping; I can imagine this is where the factor of two comes from that you had found previously.  To calculate the response over time you could use this formula, and assume that the impacted member is an SDOF system split at the point of impact, and place half of the load on either side.  It would be interesting to see how the two approaches compare.  EDIT: see my explanation of the dynamic amplification below."
engineering,3cbhnl,raoulduke25,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"but here we have strain energy = external work*distance.   No, you have energy = weight x distance, which is the formula for potential energy. Work times distance does not have units of energy.   I believe that the correct approach would be to use dynamics, assuming that the load ""hits and sticks"", you would use a unit step (Heaviside funtion).   I don't know the notation used in that formula so I can't comment on its utility in this case, but this conclusion:   twice that of the static response if we assume 0 damping   does not make any sense. We cannot add x energy to the system by x and expect the internal energy to increase by 2x. That would be very cool if we could, and would indeed solve the world's energy crisis, but since we have thermodynamics at our disposal it is safe to say that adding x to the energy of a system is limited to an increase in x and nothing more.  If you want to use the Timoshenko equation to solve for the response spectrum that is fine, but is probably unnecessary in this case."
engineering,3cbhnl,emperorchampion,2,Tue Jul 7 00:06:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, I understand where you are coming from now.  As I understand it, in terms of the dynamic response the impact will cause vibrations which oscillate about the static response (Force/stiffness), with a minimum at 0 disp and maximum at 2 x disp. The total energy is not only of the force x disp, but also the inertial energy of the bar (massx acc). At a maximum displacement, we would have the maximum acceleration, but in the opposite direction (second derivative of cosine). The result is the dynamic amplification factor for displacements. The sum of the energy terms will still be equal to the initial potential energy of the mass however.  If we add some damping to the system, there will be the third energy term which will ""reduce"" the accelerations, therefore the displacements will decrease as well since we have a smaller negative term.  http://imgur.com/7UcECCS here is a graphical representation, assuming unit everything and zero damping. The blue is the disp and the orange is acc. For the drop problem we would just replace p/k with displacement found from the potential energy of the mass.  While your method would underestimate the true value, it will not be by the full factor of two because there will be damping of the bar. The damping of the bar is tough to estimate, it really would depend on the material as well as the connections. However, the amplification is as high as 1.5 for 20% damping (which is quite high), so I feel that a factor of 2 is the safe route. To get a more accurate number testing would have to be conducted."
engineering,3cbhnl,barfobulator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:19:20 2015 UTC,I agree that the structure will overshoot and oscillate. I was only concerned with the amplitude of the first oscillation.
engineering,3cbhnl,raoulduke25,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:46:50 2015 UTC,is it not correct to use the kinetic energy of the falling object at the point of impact instead?    The cool thing about energy is that it is a constant. The potential energy of a 1 kN object 1 metre in the air is the same as the kinetic energy of the 1 kN object after you have dropped it 1 metre!   I can't quite make sense of drop distance being used in F*d in this context when we want the energy being transferred into the beam   We assume conservatively that the entirety of the potential energy of the impact particle is transferred to the beam. This is conservative since some of the energy will be lost to air resistance and some will be released as heat or sound energy upon impact. But the energy transferred to the beam cannot be greater than the potential energy of the particle at the height of release above the beam.
engineering,3cbhnl,raoulduke25,2,Tue Jul 7 00:09:50 2015 UTC,"For what we're talking about here, drag forces can be neglected. If he wants to find out what miniscule drag forces are applied that slow down his impact particle by some immeasurably small amount, he is certainly free to burden himself with such useless calculations.  For this case, we're using basic particle/beam physics to arrive at a useful approximation - in that paradigm, we neglect things like drag forces for falling objects."
engineering,3cbhnl,raoulduke25,3,Tue Jul 7 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"The main risk for this structure is impact from heavy loads dropping on it   OK, since you obviously don't get how silly your proposition is, I'll break it down for you. Let's take your 12"" wide disc. And let's drop it 100 ft. We'll say this disc is made of steel, because why not? Converting everything to metric units, we have a 30 cm disk which is 2.5 cm thick, and therefore has a mass of 14 kg, and a weight of 137 N. We'll drop it from 30 metres up. And I'll grant a drag coefficient of 1.4 just to be safe.  Free fall velocity at impact in a vacuum would be 24.26 m/s.  With air resistance, it would be 23.01 m/s.  OK, so what does that do to our final energy?  Free fall kinetic energy = 4,120 N-m  Kinetic energy with air resistance = 3,709 N-m  What's the difference? 10%. The mere fact that results won't even be anywhere near repeatable to this margin of accuracy is enough to see how dumb the whole exercise is. Not to mention - when you're designing for impact loads, what would be the benefit in shaving off a tiny portion of your steel costs? Let's look further and say that we have a W14x68 and a W14x72 to choose from, and you opt to go for the light one because of air resistance. You're saving 4 lb/ft, which is less than (USD) $2 per foot. For a 25-ft beam, you saved a whopping fifty (50) bucks. And that cost was eaten up a half an hour into your calculations on air resistance.  And all this is for a something falling an hundred feet in the air.   That's not very wise for real world engineering.   ""Real world engineering"" doesn't concern itself with unknowns that cannot be calculated repeatably to the third decimal place. This is like trying to fine-tune a car by driving to the store and back and claiming that you went 1.2948326547 miles and then trying to make a sensible decision based on that value."
engineering,3cbhnl,TeignmouthElectron,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:05:06 2015 UTC,"One method would be to estimate the deceleration of the weight. For example, if the impact decel was 3g's, you would end up with a load 3x your original load. Perhaps you could calculate your max speed, then determine the time (or distance) it would take for your load to decel from full speed to stopped, then figure out the decel g's. You could estimate the time (or deflection) by looking at the spring rate of the beam it is dropped on. You'll need to do a little back and forth because you need load to determine deflection but I think you could come up with a decent ball park."

I love how ridiculous that is, assuming a target heat rate we run over 5 MW of heat released - obviously not everything is captured.  On your point, capturing it into a steam generator [or hot water, depends on how you want to go with it, steam does require special certificates and plans to work on where I am located] into an accumulator through a pressure regulator running through insulated pipe to finned heat exchangers. The loop goes back, deaerator if needed for makeup water, and through the loop again. How much heat you will have I do not know, you know the exhaust temp but not the flow rate to get the possible energy capture.

If it were my system, I'd probably consider using that to preheat feedwater to a small low pressure boiler, and use the steam to feed HVAC coils. You could also just pump the hot water to a secondary loop heat exchanger and use that loop to heat some HVAC coils. If you have hot process water in the plant you could just pump the water into that system if you just want to recover some energy. Either way, make sure you have a pressure relief valve somewhere in the system. This type of setup is used all the time in plants to capture waste heat."
engineering,3cdizz,index_match_false,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"Basically echo-ing the same thing that /u/getsomegetsome has said, but in more words. He's absolutely right.  Use a stack economizer to capture the waste heat-- the exhaust passes through the economizer which has a bunch of coils inside that water flows through. If you have some hot water loads (process that requires hot water, steam-to-hot water calorifiers, or HVAC AHUs with hot water coils) around the plant, you can create two closed-loop systems connected by a plate heat exchanger. Primary loop = heat exchanger to stack economizer, Secondary loop = heat exchanger to hot water load. If you have any boilers around the plant, you can up their efficiency by pre-heating feedwater, by running the feedwater through the stack economizer (or same idea with the primary/secondary loops to lower risk of contamination)."

Any contract job offered to a guy fresh out of college would be suspect.  There are good, and high paying, contract jobs out there in the engineering world, but they want VERY experienced people. It's a company that has an immediate shortage, they're probably behind on schedule, and they want to bring in someone that can start contributing on day one. Any college grad is going to take months of mentoring/training before they can walk on their own."

I haven't heard of anyone including it in applications tho.  One thing that might help you: Do you have a ""major sequence"" GPA, or anything like that?  Cancel out all the English, philosophy, whatever classes that you had to take, and just look at classes directly related to your degree. That was something my uni did, not sure about others. If not, calculate it yourself, see if that helps.  And if that doesn't help, maybe classes directly related to that job. Like its a job focusing on fluid flow, and you got all A's in thermodynamics, fluids, compressibles, etc etc. Add that in there somewhere."

Within our department we're not hiring right now (budget) but the company overall has positions opening up every other day around the country.  Any advice? I would love to stay in this section of the company but I don't think they're able to hire a full time engineer at the moment.
engineering,3cag42,The_Height_of_Folly,3,Mon Jul 6 12:17:02 2015 UTC,Just ask. This seems pretty straight forward. Go tell your boss that love what you are doing and ask if they would consider hiring you full time.   They may offer you lower salary than someone else (just keep an open mind) since there may be budget constraints and they somewhat already have you on board.

Sure I could get a temporary minimum wage job while I wait, but at this point neither I nor no one from the company has any idea how much longer I could be waiting. The position is something I would love to do, with very good pay, but I'm missing out on income and have loans to start paying back in ~4 months. Should I wait or start looking for another job? Am I hurting my chances of getting hired somewhere else by waiting around months after graduation? I am just unsure of what to do and looking for any advice anyone can give!"
engineering,3cag42,The_Height_of_Folly,2,Mon Jul 6 20:13:34 2015 UTC,"I would start looking at other jobs to get an idea of what's out there. You don't know how much longer it will take for the clearance so you may as well try to find something else. If the clearance doesn't go through, you will still be unemployed and have to start from scratch. By looking at jobs now, you'll have a headstart in case things don't work out."

When the interviewer called me to make me the initial job offer, I told him I decided to take a job with a controls company in the area where I went to college (about 3 hours away from my hometown).  I ended up leaving the job at the controls company after about 4 months due to a ridiculous commute (bad decision for a first job, hindsight 20/20), and have been working at a company doing mechanical design for the past year and a half or so.    When I scheduled my upcoming interview with the same interviewer on the phone, he mentioned the position I am interviewing for may require some controls work.  I don't want to give off the vibe that I'm hiding something by not mentioning working for a controls company since I did already mention it to him back in 2014, but I am missing out on some interview brownie points by not mentioning I have some controls experience.    When I spoke to him on the phone recently he did not mention that I said I was working for a controls when I turned down his initial offer, so I'm not even sure he remembers.  Any pointers on how to address this situation?  I did not put the controls company I was at for 4 months on my resume when I re-applied to the company."

Fast forward to present, I was interviewing with the company I rejected, and I mentioned that I had been offered a job in the past that I turned down. I explained the circumstances of the decision I made and I honestly think it had a positive impact on my interviewing process.  It tells them that they trusted you enough in the past to offer you a job, and not only that but that you got multiple offers.

My company deals with power generation. The position did not give the title of ""engineer"", but the job required an engineering degree. I'm working in the operations center of our company, essentially overseeing and monitoring power production.   After working there for a year, I'm figuring out that the position is much more demanding than positions with the same title at other companies. Those positions typically require someone to sit in a room, watch some screens, and make phone calls when something happens.  We do that, but we also design the systems that we're watching, as well as design the reporting systems for the reports we produce on a daily basis. And yet I get paid like someone who only is supposed to watch TV screens.  We're actually in the hiring process, and I was asked to update our online posting. And I plugged some keywords into google to find some similar positions that I could get ideas from. And nearly all of the positions I found had titles such as ""Performance Engineer"". I couldn't believe how the responsibilities for those were nearly identical to what I do on a daily basis.  So, when I start looking for new jobs (soon), would it be immoral to change my position title from what the company calls me, in order to more accurately reflect what I do?"

When I return to school in the fall, I will start taking for focused classes and really need to have an idea for the direction I want my career to take. I had originally planned to take some classes dealing with nuclear engineering. However, I kind of enjoy the work I'm doing at my co-op job. I'm dealing more with chemistry and physical testing. So my question is this: should I study nuclear engineering and try and get into a career that I have no knowledge of and no connections in, or switch focus to chemical engineering and chemistry? I am going to set up a meeting with my supervisors to discuss potential employment for my final co-op and post-graduation. Does anyone have an advice? Is nuclear a difficult field to get into?"

If it's just something that sounds cool, but you don't know much about it, go for the career path that nets you the most options, like chemistry/chemical engineering, especially if you have connections there.  The nuclear field is a closed box. It's not impossible to get into, but you really are going into a field that you can't just leave and go do other things any time you want. It's a very specialised field. If you are on the fence about it, learn more about the field and see if it's something that really interests you.

Dead weight hurts the company a lot more than a large company. Not to mention, you can't hide your true colours as easily since everybody works so closely together.

Is my idea of designing propulsion systems a realistic one? Would I be able to start in a job in planes and move to space stuff?  3) Would I need a masters? Could I start out with a four-year degree?  4) What would my day in a job with an aerospace/astronautical/aeronautical degree be like? What about a career in propulsion? Would it be mostly computer modeling (I'm cool with this)?  6) Anything else I should know/do?  Thank you very much."
engineering,3cag42,utspg1980,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"1) Don't get too hung up on the name of the degree. I have a degree in ""aerospace"" because that's just what my university called it, but the vast majority of my classes where atmospheric based, aka aeronautical. Find the universities you are interested in, and email a guidance counselor from the aero dept and tell them about your interests, and ask if they have a program that focuses on that, and a list of classes they offer related to that.  2) NASA is on a downward trend. With the cancellation of the Constellation program, I know several people that lost their jobs, and were unable to get back into Aero related jobs for several years.  The private industry is on the rise, with notable names like SpaceX, Scaled Composites (Spaceship 1), but is in it's infancy, so too soon to call it reliable yet. SpaceX is known for treating employees poorly: 60 hour work weeks, mediocre pay, no 401k match, etc etc all for the ""glory"" of working for a ""cool"" company. The others such as Scaled Composites and Sierra Nevada are better.  Atmospheric flight (unless you get into military, i.e. missiles) is a totally different propulsion system than space. Could you switch between the two? It's possible, but since they'd have to teach you a lot at the new job, you would probably lose some seniority if you switched. Job wise: GE, Rolls Royce, and the like seem to be plenty busy. The recently released Boeing 787 has made headlines for using less fuel. Something like 10-25% less fuel for the same flight as a 777. Some articles will contribute this to the composite construction of the 787, but in actuality it can all be awarded to the fuel efficiency of the new engines!  3) Nope, engineering is one of the better degrees in regards to being able to get a good job right after bachelors.  4) Yes, odds are you'd be in front of a computer all day. Actual modeling of parts, or doing stress analysis calculations, or running finite element analysis of parts, stuff like that. There are some people, such as test engineers, that are more hands on, but the vast majority of people that get an aero degree end up in front of a PC all day.  5) You skipped number 5. Attention to detail is important in the engineering industry.  :p  6) If your school offers it, try to take AP Chem. Chem is very useful in propulsions...not so much in the rest of aero. Also try to take AP Physics if you can."

I'm not 100% sure which particular field I want to work in, but I like the idea of working in construction. I've read about MEP engineering and I feel confident that this is where my interest lies. However almost all Google searches related to MEP involve Mechanical engineers, not EE. Last year I spoke to a mechanical engineer in an engineering and architecture firm who told me that their work involves HVAC, sprinklers, fire alarms, and power distribution throughout the building (like signs, outlets, lighting, etc.). They do in fact hire EEs, but at that time I didn't know what MEP was, so I never had any follow up questions for him.    I also read that mechanical engineers can not only handle the ""M"" but can also handle the ""P"". So can they also handle the ""E"" or do engineering firms hire EEs for these tasks specifically? Can anyone who works in MEP give me some more insight into this field? Are Electrical Engineers usually in demand in this field? I would imagine that NYC being such a hotspot for construction would definitely have lots of jobs available for MEP? ANY information would be very much appreciated. Also, how are the benefits for this career?"

To ppl in in this field is this true? 2.job outlook/relocation: The job outlook seems bleak tbh especially compared to the other two, and getting internships is near impossible. Also the jobs would require relocation and are nowhere near major cities i.e. Toronto. can people in either of these fields elaborate Now for SE what scares me is that i've heard people say that the strong survive in this field and to become a good SE u must make it your life (I only have a little python programming experience) is this true? The biggest pros for this is the number of jobs in toronto is more then 15 times that of chemE and there is no job 'safety risk'. For compE it seems like an offshoot of electrical Engineering. It seems like a good field to go into and relatively stable and safe. But i stll want to know the level of programming involved in this and for a person who is good in the core subjects (physics chem, math) and ok in pthon programmng how well I can do.

Those that do, sure, there's additional safety precautions that are required.  But you should go where your passion lies. If you're already in your second year and only know a little bit of Python, it doesn't sound like you exactly have a strong passion for coding.

Before I get into my questions here is a little about me (skip down a bit if you don't care about my life, it's okay I won't get mad):  I am 26 and I graduated with a degree in Management and Organizational Studies (I don't know what that exactly entails but most of my classes were accounting/economic classes).

I cannot see myself working the field for the next 20+ years so I am considering a career change. This brings me to your lovely subreddit!

(Important) Do you find your job rewarding and/or boring? Why?  Do you think it will be difficult to enter the engineering work force at the age of 32?  How is the work/life balance?

Not nearly as challenging or interesting as college was.    Fairly boring. Unless you constantly switch companies/departments/focuses, you become very specialized. In college you are like a jack of all trades, you learn about propulsion, fluid flow, structures, stress and strain, etc etc. Once you have a job, its 1 thing. You end up using the same 4 or 5 equations 10,000 times.    I did it at 27, so no.  Several companies (who were focusing on hiring new grads) viewed my maturity refreshing. Hiring someone that had worked for several years in an office (even if not engineering related) showed I'd already gone thru the phase of adjusting to work life, a 9-5 job, etc.     Depends on the company, but in general its pretty good.    Some type of 3D modeling software is important, but every company will have a different program that they use. If you are thinking of teaching yourself AutoCAD, sure it is a bonus that you can put on your resume, but don't spend 1000s of hours becoming a super pro, because you might interview at a company that uses a totally different software. It's not like Excel, where 1 program is used by 99% of the companies. But the concepts are similar in a lot of modeling programs, so it helps to show that you can grasp the concepts."
engineering,3cb0r2,trooper5010,5,Mon Jul 6 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"Peltier systems are small but have a poor coefficient of performance (COP). In strict thermodynamic terms, efficiency is a poor way to describe a refridgerator. COP is the term for how much heat is removed for how much energy used. Vapor compression systems have better COP but require a compressor.  I have never seen a compressor smaller than 90mm fan.   Since the two options are competing against each other, you have to choose which is more important - size or COP.  That said, what you likely need is economy (how much cold for how many watts) of which COP is only one component. Air space, insulation, any heat generation inside the space, and the rate of temperature reduction, the outside ambient air temperature all factor into the economy.  Determining if the linked device is sufficient will depend on all of those things.   I can't tell you the answer based on the information provided, but I can tell you that you need to focus as much on insulation, air leakage, and some heat calcs as much as finding the right cooling unit."

After doing a little research, If I wanted to maximize my ""economy"" and build a vapor compression system, am I correct in saying the following is my objective, how would I find an evaporator and a condenser that could circulate roughly the same amount of heat as my compressor? I found this research paper and on page 7 it seems like it has a method to make a simulation, but a very vague method at that.. I would rather just do it with a laser heat sensor if possible (I have never done something like this though).  I hopefully will get a chance to do some computational fluid analysis and all of that good stuff to see if I can compare the themoelectric cooling fan to a custom built system.. and also how different shapes are affected in fluid flow as well.  Thanks again."
engineering,3cb0r2,GeorgeTheNerd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"If you move forward with a vapor system, please keep safety first. Learn the gasses involved and what needs to be done to work with them.  If you modify the plumbing of a system, you will likely need to evacuate the system and then refill it.  The vapor system requires the evaporator coil to be in the cold part and the condenser coil to be in the hot part. Then power the compressor.   Refrigerators, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, and heat pumps all use basically the same system. The differences are where the coils are, the size of the coils, and the gas being used.  If you want such a system, the easiest way would be to find a used dorm fridge or small home dehumidifier. Again, I want to emphasize safety and knowing the gasses you will be working with and not bending or opening the pipes of the system with it being pressurized."

On the flip side, most of the engineers I know write terrible code, they care far more about getting the right result than the steps to get to that result, so while the code may work it's extremely brittle, slow, and specific.  A big part of my job is taking code written by our PhD guy and turning it into something that can actually be used by other people.  I've seen very intelligent engineers write code filled with global variables where functions have to be called in just the right order or the variable won't even be defined, there's a complete lack of understanding of OOP and FP, and databases are out of grasp for many of them.  And pray that you never have to read LabWindows C written by someone whose last programming course involved punchcards.

engineering,3c9hi0,Whimsical_Monikr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:35:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely keep up with your math. All the coolest CS algorithms in robotics have some considerable Mathworks behind them. Understanding how they work makes them that much easier to implement.   On the CS side, scrape up as much experience with different softwares as you can. In no particular order: ROS, OpenGL, OpenCV, PCL, Qt, Eigen, etc.   Read some scholarly articles if you can. There's a ton of great stuff you can find in Google Scholar. Find a particular field you like, and read deeply in that area. Machine learning and computer vision are advancing rapidly these days.   Finally, start your own project. Push the boundaries of your learning, constantly. Build a web app or a small household robot. Pull some spare parts together and build yourself a server for your own r/homelab   Do what you love and love what you do, and you'll never work a day in your life"

There are different flight test teams, such as loads, spins, weapons, ship suitability, etc. The aircraft will be tested to every limit possible, and generally each flight test engineer will be assigned a specific task, so testing a specific naval aircrafts minimum launch speed off the deck using a catapult for example. From this, the flight test engineer, the test coordinator and the test pilot will have meetings and organize a flight test plan. It will take a few months to get a test plane together, which will outline everything that you want to do during the test, what data you want to record, what you expect to see in the test, possible errors and what to do as a result of those errors. Then comes the test, where you go out with the pilot and test coordinator and you run the test. Lastly, you take the data back and do data reduction to understand what happened, good or bad, and relay the info back to a design group to either validate or suggest changes to a design, and then you go to test something else.   It's a fun job, you usually get lots of time around airplanes and you get to do the cool tests most people don't get to be a part of. If you have any specific questions feel free to PM me.

I would absolutely not pursue this any further, it's not that it's petty, it's that complaining about it will accomplish nothing and betray a lack of knowledge of how engineering research labs operate.   I didn't acknowledge any of the summer students who worked in my lab in any of my papers, I didn't even cite the PhD students who were heavily involved in my work (and people I helped didn't cite me either).

First of all, get all your paperwork in order that shows that the case was dismissed. Keep this available in paper and electronic formats and ready to give to anybody who asks for clarification. If any question comes up if you have been convicted of a felony, say no. This is perfectly legal. If they do a background check and they say, ""Well, this case came up in your check,"" then say, ""Yes, but that case was dismissed,"" and deliver the paperwork to them.  If they ask if you have been arrested tell the truth. In most cases, having an arrest is not enough to keep you from getting a job. I had much worse legal problems than you and I managed to get a PE is several states without too much difficulty. I don't want to get too much into my legal problems but to sum up, I was charged with felony forgery and plead guilty under the Georgia First Offender Act. I was given probation for several years and upon completing it and paying my fines, I had the verdict returned to me not guilty.

I had a Pinkerton (now Securitas) check done before I could go into a plant a few years ago.  They will find probably find out about the arrest, and if you have ever been scraped by a private aggregation service, the expungement will not affect them.  If you are asked about it you should disclose it, but in most cases it will not prevent you from getting a job or being allowed into a plant.    Giving information on the background check that does not match what their databases turn up will cause a problem though.  I had to fight an error where someone with my same first name and the same start of my last name got linked in a private database; it kept me out of a plant for a week until they fixed the link and sent a clear report to the plant.

Technically, I would say robotic systems are a subset of mechatronic systems.  Mechanical is a far more specialised discipline. Mechatronics is the mix of mechanical systems with electrical controls and computer control. So all three disciplines mixed. A mechanical engineer will be more specialised in the physical machine aspects.  I'm not entirely convinced the broader degree is ""better"" - at some point you really want the expertise of three specialists. There's a lot to be said for people who straddle two fields and can work at the intersection, but that's what majors and electives are for - by the time you do the common units, if you pick the right units you can finish with a Mech eng and a big chunk of EE, which is possibly more useful than a broad-but-shallow degree in three areas.  And I say that as someone doing a robotics degree, but I recognise that I really won't have the expertise in any area that a dedicated degree would give me. I'm really just a professional dilettante."

I'd call the OEM."
engineering,3c6l10,JackfromMN,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:04:08 2015 UTC,Some fans with fairly aggressive pitches can be pretty darn loud even when balanced correctly.  I remember working on an engine once that had a hydraulic radiator fan that was louder than the engine itself.
engineering,3c6l10,WallyReflector,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:16:08 2015 UTC,You should also worry about chopping of the air which occurs when the outgoing air strikes the stator/housing and basically makes a siren noise (youtube link to build one) This also relates to balance of load from an airflow standpoint. Rotation-ally it can be balanced but the loading on the fan is unbalanced.
engineering,3c6l10,slopecarver,13,Mon Jul 6 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"So you're pulling wet biomass through the fan? Is it possible that you have compacted material in some of the vanes and that is causing an imbalance? Was the fan balanced in the first place? If not, you most likely have impeller balance issues. If it was, maybe you are seeing material stick to the fan and causing imbalance."

engineering,3c6l10,digitallis,10,Mon Jul 6 17:06:57 2015 UTC,Check to make sure there's not a clump of something inside the fan cage (causing unbalance).  Open a porthole and spin the thing by hand. Look for wobble. You can help look for wobble by clamping a stick to the frame and bringing it close to the rotating assembly as a feeler.  Check the alignment/bearings.  Can you observe the pillow blocks as the thing is spinning up? Is the thing snug in its bearings?
engineering,3c6l10,gizzard_n_pepper,4,Sun Jul 5 12:56:59 2015 UTC,"Have you verified the fan is meeting the expected performance?  Centrifugal fans can rotate backwards and still move a large percentage of air, and be loud.  Where does the operating point land on the fan curve?"
engineering,3c6l10,kv-2,4,Sun Jul 5 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"You could have had minor water infiltration during the trip which may have destroyed the grease in the bearings, the bearings could have generated false brinelling during transport [unlikely but possible], there could be enough misalignment to generate the vibration, the fan could be unbalanced, you could have sucked biomass in the bearings/unbalanced the fan with it, it could be the wrong bearing application [unlikely] or the running clearances could be wrong, you could be using the wrong grease [possible].   When you say stuff gets warm, is it abnormally warm or just ""warm""?"
engineering,3c6l10,gingerkid1234,2,Sun Jul 5 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd take a closer look at the bearings.  Just because they're not getting warm doesn't mean they're working properly.  The easiest way to check would be to rotate the parts separately.  If possible, run the motor unloaded (with belt removed), and turn the shaft separately.  If it feels rough, it'd probably a bearing.  Someone else mentioned measuring the vibration.  If that's outside your equipment, the easiest way is usually just to compare the sound to what bearing noise sounds like."
engineering,3c6l10,DrNebula,2,Sun Jul 5 12:53:44 2015 UTC,As others have said check the bearings.  In my experience if something is louder than it should be it's typically bad bearings.

You can replace bearings all day long, but if they are dying in a fraction of the expected life, it isn't the bearings fault.   Even though I may not have been working long, I have seen this far too often already."
engineering,3c6l10,Funkit,2,Sun Jul 5 16:35:25 2015 UTC,You have no type of filtration to prevent pulling particulate through the fan? Debris could destroy those bearings depending on whT type and how they're shielded. Id lean more towards an imbalanced blade.

engineering,3c6l10,mechathatcher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:45:00 2015 UTC,Is rotating stall related to cavitation in centrifugal pumps?  Cavitation is caused by choking off the inlet to the pump causing a reduction in pressure that causes the water to vaporize.  It is also very loud and ultimately will destroy the impeller.
engineering,3c6l10,voynaimir,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"No, nothing about cavitation. The rotating stall essentially builds a vortex behind (IIRC) usually one blade in the fan. This vortex prevents that blade from contributing to the useful air flow. The vortex travels along with the blade, thus ""rotating"". The vortex is quite violent and can excite resonance in the housing or the duct work that produces incredible noise. AFAIK it is not particularly destructive to the fan, but it severely impacts performance.  Edit: It's been years since I worked this problem. There are characteristic frequencies associated with this, maybe 1/2 or 1/3 X turning speed and multiple harmonics of such. You might find something in the archives of Sound&Vibration magazine or the Proceedings of the Vibration Institute. In my case I hired a PhD in fluid mechanics to redesign the impeller which solved the problem and got the lawyers off our back. Wish I could give you a name but those records are long lost.

Use their recommendations as rules. For something more entertaining, read Hemingway. He subjects weren't technical, but his style was succinct and descriptive. Try to use a similar style, avoid prose and strive for clarity. Scrutinize your word choices.   Make every document, every section, and every paragraph answer the questions why did you do it, what did you learn, what did you do, how did you do it. In that order.   Finally, tell them what you're going to tell, tell them what you are telling them, tell them what you told them.   Know your audience, but you can also write for all audiences if needed. Begin with simple conclusions worded so that everyone could learn from them. Your neighbor should understand the first sentence or two. Build towards specific and technical conclusions in the next two or three sentences. Then present your work. To finish, reverse the order.   So to improve your technical writing, first improve your writing abilities. Use a style of writing that is concise, informative, and clear.

When I went on site to do installs, then 50% of the time was spent pulling cables and making sure your equipment was connected correctly and the other 50% was sitting around waiting.   I didn't stay there long and got back to a plant. I realized what I like about automation / controls is optimizing a process that I own. It's not doing it full-time as a contractor where you hardly ever see your automation run."
engineering,3c3vh4,papep,44,Sat Jul 4 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"Introverted engineer here.  I've ended up having to do lots of public speaking in my career.  It sucks at first, but it truly is one of those things that will only improve with practice.  Seek out every opportunity you can to get up and speak in front of others.    Organizations like Toastmasters can be good for getting some practice and feedback on your speaking.    Also, the times when I get really nervous about speaking is when I don't know my material well, and when I don't know the audience.  So, I would also strongly suggest taking enough time to know your topic forwards and backwards.  I don't like memorizing my talks because I find I get more anxious about going off script.  I do like having an outline so I know which points I want to cover.  Finally, understanding your audience is a big help, as it lets you prepare material that will be at an appropriate level, and it can also let you anticipate the kind of questions you may get and be prepared for those."

engineering,3c3vh4,claireauriga,3,Sun Jul 5 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to say, ""I don't know,"" or, ""Let me think,"" or just allow there to be a silence. It can actually show strong confidence, because you're not afraid to engage with your material in front of other people. If you ever get nervous, focus on slowing down. Allow pauses, space out your words, and breathe. You'll sound a lot more confident and it gives you time to think or relax."
engineering,3c3vh4,confirmd_am_engineer,17,Sun Jul 5 07:58:27 2015 UTC,"Great question! I might be outside of the norm on this sub because I'm not introverted at all; I actually enjoy public speaking. In high school I used to compete in extemporaneous speech (writing a researched speech topic in 30 minutes and presenting with no notes). I've only been in the engineering field for a few years, but being able to talk formally to a group of people has already been valuable for me. I also believe that anyone can become comfortable with public speaking given enough time and practice. A few words of advice for anyone who isn't fond of giving presentations:  1) Know what you're talking about. It doesn't matter how good you are at speaking to a group if you can't adequately address the topic of your presentation. Think about the questions you are likely to field at the end (or in the middle, if your managers are like mine) and write yourself an answer for them.   2) Practice. Your first few runs through a presentation will be a little rough. Get a co-worker or friend to listen through these trial runs and give you notes.   3) Vocal pauses: noises like ""umm"", ""err"", ""you know"", are there to give you time to think about what you're going to say next. They are also pretty annoying for an audience to listen to. Instead, try actually pausing to think. It allows the same time for thought without your speech becoming a stream-of-consciousness blur of sound. You'll sound smarter and more confident without doing anything different (note: if you are a habitual vocal pause-er it will take time to remove this habit).   4) Use notes! Not full-page notes, but note cards. Don't write your whole presentation on them, just some cues to keep you organized. Here's an example: my notecard reads ""Pumps: 2A, 3A, 6B"" which helps me remember ""We had pump failures on 2A, 3A, and 6B scrubber pumps that all fit this failure mechanism.""  5) Visual aids: there's a ton of stuff to think about with powerpoint (or equivalent) presentations, but here's two that I find will help you give a better presentation.    First, try not to put your ideas in text on the screen. You will read from your slides if you do this. Here's the thing about reading from slides: I can read them too, and I can do it faster than you can read them aloud to me. This is very boring and makes me want to ignore you. Instead, try pictures or graphs that illustrate the points you want to make, plus a few words to help clarify. This makes me as an audience member pay more attention to both you and your slides.  Second, make sure your slides are readable from the whole room. If you can, put your presentation up during your practice runs and make sure you can read it clearly. This also applies to color and font schemes. Don't get cute.    While I'm not an expert in public speaking, I do understand the difficulty many engineers have in conveying their message to a room. Don't quit; just think of public speaking as another engineering tool that you need to develop. Very few people are born as great speakers, just like few are born knowing instinctively how to do differential equations. You can do it!  Edit: formatting. Also, this post was really long. Sorry."
engineering,3c3vh4,GeneralPickle,3,Sat Jul 4 15:38:49 2015 UTC,"I like your analogy of ""public speaking as another engineering tool that you need to develop."" Totally agree. We engineers are often focused on technology at the expense of interpersonal development."

engineering,3c3vh4,big_deal,6,Sun Jul 5 09:58:16 2015 UTC,"I have issues doing public speaking but hide it as well (at least i think i do). Knowing your material is the biggest confidence boost as well as helping you actually convey what you need efficiently. I also keep a bottle of water or glass with me if it's going to go on for a while so I can take a quick break to keep pace and also doesn't come off as awkward. The more you do it the more fluid you become, i just hope there's a point in the future where I'm not freaking out on the inside while doing it. I did a speech class but that was during my hardest semester so i ended up going off the cuff for some parts of my speeches which might of helped a little but that would not be ideal professionally."
engineering,3c3vh4,Inigo93,3,Sat Jul 4 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"All of my public speaking is in design reviews or presenting training material to newer engineers. The hardest aspect is in delivering complex topics in a clear way to people who may not be familiar with the subject. In design reviews we often are presenting to external or internal customers who are not deeply technical. Yet we have to present very technical information to support our design decisions. There's a fine line between giving too much depth and not enough.   The same goes for training but at least I can adjust the content and depth for the audience. I usually break up training into introductory (this information is useful to be familiar with but you don't need it to do your job) and detailed (you have to learn this or you won't be able to do your job).   Early in my career I had to practice my presentations to make sure I had a clear idea of what I was going to say and exactly how I wanted to word it. Now I usually just wing it. This is a result of being more comfortable with speaking and be much more comfortable with my understanding of the material. Sometimes if I expect certain questions I will prepare backup presentation slides that go into greater depth. For example, if I'm presenting a design that is clearly a compromise (all designs are), I might prepare some slides that show alternative designs and the reasons they were rejected. Then when someone say ""you should have designed it like this"" I can show them why it won't work or why it's not the best option.   One of the biggest problems I had early in my career was that I would get nervous and speak very quickly, running out of breath. Slow down, take time to breath. Pauses in speech are natural - just because you are presenting doesn't mean you have to fill every moment with a noise from your mouth.   The hardest part for me now is answering left-field questions. Be familiar with the content of your material, the source of all the information you are presenting, and the assumptions built into any analysis/results. Be prepared to answer questions. If you don't know the answer don't try to make one up. This is a common mistake with new hires - they don't know the answer but they think they are expected to guess on the spot. Just take an action item and followup later.   The most cringe worthy thing I see in other people's presentations is using the same cliche or catch-phrase over and over again. There are a couple of people I work with who use filler phrases every other sentence, e.g. ""You know?"", ""Therefore,"". I just want ask them ""Do you realize you keep saying this over and over?"" Be careful with your language, listen to yourself and try to avoid developing a catch-phrase. I think it takes a very focused effort to listen to yourself. If you have trouble doing this while you are speaking then it may be helpful to record your presentation and listen to it later.   I did have some formal training in college. I worked for the Industrial Engineering college and our boss wanted each of us to take a professional training course and return and present the material to the rest of the group. I signed up for a public speaking seminar. It was about 4 hours and the content was helpful. The things I remember the most were related to articulation and voice. All other training has been informal - college and work presentations."

engineering,3c3vh4,MomentOfArt,3,Mon Jul 6 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"Do you ever think about this topic? (better communication, public speaking, etc...) If so, when, why, and how often?   Yes, pretty much anytime I'm preparing a formal document or presentation for someone else.  I have a tendency to be overly wordy and I'll spend some time pondering what actually needs to be said.  Generally, this takes the form of writing the document, walking away from it, and coming back to it a few days later.   What's so hard about speaking/presenting and why?   Knowing what information your audience values and what it doesn't.  'Cause what ever it is, it's almost certainly different than what you think is important (or not).  What makes it easier?  Rehearsal with an audience and getting feedback from said audience.  Do a couple dry runs and everything after that is cake and pie."

I knew the better of communicator and public speaker I was, the more successful my life and career would be.  Some are natural entertainers and some are not. I struggled with filler words and not being very smooth. If you haven't presented much it can be nerve wracking.  On the recommendation of a few older coworkers and my own research, I joined Toastmasters and I'd classify it as one of the best decisions of my life. For $100 a year in dues and some of your free time, you can gain confidence in your speaking voice that carries over to not just presentations but everyday communication. Go start this week.

The second is to know that your audience will not be able to accurately gauge your level of nervousness. If you are feeling an 8/10 level of anxiety, your audience will see a 2/10.

Your duty of communication is to the engineering you did. Serve that work, and the tech you know, and make that the object of your effort. The audience, assuming they're interested in the first place, will take care of themselves in that context. Serve them by telling the tale well.   That's how I talk, and (counterintuitively!) for some reason keep getting compliments on my speaking style and how I engage people. :) People do respond to passion and integrity, and if you're really determined to tell the story of the work, it'll show.

engineering,3c3vh4,hamad501,2,Sat Jul 4 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"For me the biggest challenge is that you don't get much in the way of immediate feedback. It's a conversation where the other person doesn't say anything for 20 minutes. The most you get back is a few head-nods. It's hard to tell if you're being clear, if you need to slow down or speed up or what.  Humor is the best way to bridge that gap. If you drop in a joke and everybody laughs right away, they're engaged. If there's a hesitation and muffled laughter, they weren't really paying attention. If there's no laughter, it's either because you should never become a comedian, or they are baffled by the subject matter and you need to slow down. In any case it increases people's focus and attention on the topic and helps break up a dense subject.  Aside from this, practice, know your subject, and get to know your audience as well. Make sure you talk a little about how the subject and conclusions will impact them or their interests. Forgetting to put the topic into perspective is a mistake a lot of engineers make, and it can be a critical difference in achieving comprehension."

engineering,3c3vh4,phatdoge,2,Sat Jul 4 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"Knowing your material is by far the most important thing you can do when public speaking.  If you you are confident that you know all of the material there shouldn't be any reason to be afraid.  Remember, when public speaking it is good to note that you are there to portray something, not entertain people.  Usually what I do, before going into a meeting where I have to speak publicly is tell myself that I know just as much or more than the people I am talking to.  This helps me ease me nerves and think of it more as a conversation than anything."
engineering,3c3vh4,phatdoge,2,Sat Jul 4 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"I find I have several areas in which communication is important:   Written communication, including reports and emails. One of the hardest skills is learning how to be concise. Techniques I use include writing what's in my head, then editing it afterwards; not sending something until I can summarise it in three sentences; and lots and lots of bullet points. Other important things include following a narrative order so other people can understand your thought process, and for goodness' sake define your terms. As engineers, there are a lot of words which can be used in many ways. It doesn't matter which way you use them as long as your audience understands! Public speaking (one to many). This is easy once you get over any nerves from being on display, because there's very little feedback and you're in control of the message. Having a strong narrative is really important to keep the audience with you. One-on-one discussions. These tend to be the easiest, because you can relax and be yourself quite a lot. It's very useful to always break down your point into 3-5 key statements, and keep refocusing on them to make sure you've been understood. Group conversations. You have to monitor the group dynamic as well as individual people and be willing to steer things back on course. There are also specialised roles, like facilitating, which are particularly challenging as they require you to speak and behave in completely different ways to what you'd ordinarily do.   Of those four, I find group conversations very, very difficult, and the others pretty easy. I think it's because I'm an introvert, so reading and focusing on so many people is exhausting, and because I have far less control of the communication than I do in any of the other situations."

engineering,3c3vh4,dam072000,2,Sun Jul 5 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"Great answers!  I will add one other case:   What if your audience is not interested in the technical details. As an introvert - project manager, this happens a lot.  In that case I try to put myself in the shoes of my audience by imagining (or asking) about    what things they fear might happen again that X can help reduce or eliminate, and how they imagine X might generate a positive future   Usually I work with this logic structrure:   What are our needs (Did we understand the problem?) What are the desired outcomes for the stakeholders What are the limitations/ difficulties/ trade-offs we have for reaching the desired outcome What we can (or have) achieved How the future will be with X   Finally, I try to be very sincere about what are the assumptions that were made during the development of X.  Engineering projects are built on assumptions. Some assumptions are weak or irrelevant while others turn out to be the pillars that will make your project a success.... only the stakeholders can make you see which are which."

engineering,3c3vh4,TBBT-Joel,2,Sun Jul 5 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"As an engineer, it is vital to be able to effectively communicate.  Whether you're writing an engineering report that has to get reviewed/approved by a permitting agency, engineering and developing a new product that needs funding, pitching your idea to investors, or even explaining something engineering related to the public...being able to communicate well to get your points and ideas across to others is vital.  I've gotten to the point where people have told me that I'm a natural at public speaking.  I'm not.  I was absolutely terrified of public speaking when I was younger.  To the point where I would visibly shake on stage and forget what I needed to say.  It takes work and practice but over time I've gotten comfortable with it.      (1) I am forced to think about effective communication.  I write lots of reports or submittals to local and federal agencies.  I have to write my reports in a way that allows the reviewer or someone else 1, 5, or 10 years down the road to pick it up and understand the engineering we did as well as come to the same conclusions.      On the public speaking side, I teach at a PE exam prep class and I've given a few presentations at conferences.  Effective communication there is extremely important.  Students in my classes are there to get prepared for passing the PE exam which is a huge milestone in Civil engineering.  If I don't effectively communicate the topics I'm teaching, then the students are not learning what they need to in a way that gets them prepared to take the PE exam.  (2) What's so hard about presenting?  Could by a wide range of things.  I think inexperience and fears (actual or perceived) might be the two biggest things. Many engineers I know, myself included, are introverted.  One of my biggest fears - and I have a suspicion that other introverted engineers may feel this way too - is rejection or being embarrassed, especially in front of a group.  Those fears can sometimes drive us away from wanting to be in the public eye.  Also, to improve on public speaking one has to get up and do it.  Practice, practice, practice.  And not in front of a mirror.  Practice in front of actual people.  Sometimes all you have to do is get over the hump and you do just fine.  That hump may be large, or it may be small.  But you won't know how big it is until you get up there and tackle it head on.  Trial and error helps too.  If it works, keep doing it when you speak in public.  If it doesn't try something different in your next talk.      (3) One thing that has helped me immensely with public speaking is a book called ""Made to Stick"".  Here's a quick synopsis.  The whole book is predicated on an acronym using SUCCESS (minus the second S at the end. * Simple - break it down to the core topic/idea.  It's easier for an audience to understand a core topic/idea than to try and remember how a bunch of pieces fit together. * Unexpected - throw in something unexpected to get and keep your audience's attention. * Concrete - your idea/message needs to be tangible rather than abstract. * Credible - you have to be a credible source for your audience to believe you and buy into your ideas. * Emotional - tapping into emotions allows for your message and ideas to stick in people's minds a little bit more. * Stories - everyone loves a good story.  It keeps them engaged and it doesn't feel like a boring technical presentation if you tell them a story.     Other resources I've found that really help * website called Rule the Room. * TED talk by Simon Sinek called ""Start With Why"".  Read his book too and thought it was fantastic.      Like others have noted earlier, knowing your topic makes a world of difference.  If you know your topic you can not only speak about it well but you'll also be able to answer in depth questions when they do pop up.  It's a confidence builder.  You also have to know your audience.  You have to tailor your presentation and your wording to your audience.  Speaking to professionals in your area of expertise at a conference versus speaking to residents about the same topic can be quite different.  You can speak in more technical terms to other professionals but when you speak to residents or the public you have to tailor it in a way where they understand it because they generally don't want to hear all the technical information (at least that's what my experience has been in speaking to the public).      Know your audience, know your topic, and deliver the message well in speaking/visual aids/handouts."

They're pretty much polar opposites, but I've loved acting for as long as I can remember. This summer I actually got a job as a tour guide, so I've got a pretty good grasp at public speaking. I've always gotten nervous when speaking in front of small crowds, but groups of 500 people have been cake for some reason. I think it's because with smaller crowds, it seems more personal and intimate. Also, I've never been nervous acting because as long as I know my lines, it's pretty hard to screw up. When I started my tour guide job this summer I was super nervous because I didn't have a set structure as far as a script went; it was all just general information. After I got to know more info and started getting more of a script down, I got really comfortable with it. I still get nervous when I go off script and try to wing it, but what it all boils down to is having a script and knowing your information. Sorry for the wall of text. Hope that helps!"

Was also a criminal gang that used to do arson jobs on old factories  using components of jet fuel, think it was the waxy solids that fall out and form tank sludge. Those burned REAL GOOD.   Also have to consider refractory components of where the main burn was. The less parasitic loss, the hotter the flame, more convection, etc. An extreme example being a microwave crucible pod for doing small amounts of metal. 1500 watts is not much, unless not much heat escapes.

The chart gets pushed to the site.   Google forms. I created a questionnaire form based on the task involved for a certain deliverable. Each deliverable has one person responsible for updating the tracking of that deliverable. This form goes to them at the end of every day. They update progress on tasks and send in the form  The form automatically populates another Google sheet.  Google sites. Create a list page. It's a customizable column and list based Web list view. Mine is automatically updated based on input from the Google form but manual entry doesn't take that long.   Google sites. Each deliverable had its own list page. If the task is data based and not physical based ( building a spreadsheet vs building a house ) I include a file cabinet page for others to upload the files to.  These services are free which is a bonus if your on a budget.  You can aggregate all the data on the site into a dashboard view. The site can be public of have custom sharing options for each page.  So for example my boss can see the dashboard page and each employee involved in a certain deliverable can only access their list page as a viewer and the file cabinet to upload/download files.  There is a small learning curve but it allows you to automate a large part of project management ( information gathering ).

engineering,3c2uq2,vengeance_pigeon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:57:14 2015 UTC,"Read up on Gantt and Pert charts.  Learn the basics.  I don't know how big or small of a project you're working on.  Plus, I have no idea how your department and company handle the project process.  Everyone's kind of different which makes project management fundamentally easy but weird to implement.  I say the best you can do is understand the steps required for the project.  Break down each stepping stone of the project.  Identify resources (materials, tools, personnel, etc).  Get some estimates for the timeframe of each step and put in a fudge factor to account for uncertainty or variation (typically statistics plays its role here if you know that stuff).  You should be able to piece together an action plan to work through the project.  It may not be exact, but it can be a reasonable representation.    You can also ask people for help, especially for anything you don't know.  A simple example is you have to weld a frame structure together but you have no idea how long it takes.  You can have some basic drawing concepts and then talk to your welders about time, equipment, and any special needs.  They can help piece together the key components and help you create a good representation of that part of the job.  I do not know what kind of steps you will have in your project, but I would expect there will be stages throughout the project that would include budget/costing estimates and review of design concepts and prototypes.  There should be some checks in place to evaluate progress and worth of continuation.  Sometimes unknowns going into a project force a change of scope or may possibly even halt a project dead and deem it not feasible relative to the initial parameters.  The checks throughout the project ensure the worth of doing the project still exists.  Things like Gantt and Pert charts are useful to package it all together, but they're kind of worthless without all the fundamental components."

If that is all, it is perfectly legal to keep using old software (that you paid for).  It is illegal if they are getting updates without paying for them, or if they did not pay for the original license.   If it is typical NX, then you can put it on as many computers as you want, but they have to connect to a local license server, so only as many seats as you paid for can be running at a given time.  If they have a workaround for the number of seats, then yeah, illegal.  But the subscription fees are typically for updates and support.  Like if you bought solid works 2006 then never paid fees, you could still use it, you just can't get updates or anything.    Edit:  never mind, you said pirated, not just old software.

You are in no way responsible as an employee, unless you are participating in which case there may be piracy related consequences if an investigation happens. I know a guy who nearly went to prison for it because his boss expected him to keep all the computers running and would not pay for software. I would flat out refuse to apply cracks and let someone else do it. I would find another job if your boss doesn't see the value in purchasing CAD software.  The bottom line is... your license may be used to start/own a business that provides engineering services to the public and to sign/seal contract documents. I dont think the board would even care to look in to such a detail. It's not their business. They are more interested in disciplining engineers who put the public at risk.   Edit. If he's too cheap to purchase software. He's too cheap to pay you what you might deserve down the road. Plenty of businesses can afford the price of software and pay an engineer's salary.

Be careful with whatever you decide . Engineering communities are small enough that you are likely to run into those same guys and general advice is you want to do your best to leave on good terms. Now say you do say something and they go under. You now have to compete with some of those guys in a area with a limited job market. And some of those guys will be networked enough to get those jobs pretty quick especially their senior engineers and management. Add in the fact that they at the very least they suspect you and would hold a grudge, what with being a new hire and someone that they haven't seen prove themselves as being on-board with the ""system"".

You could apply - all you need to be a member in training is an accredited degree.  You need to gather up your four years of experience before you apply for your license anyway - your character gets evaluated when you apply for professional license, not when you apply as an member in training.  I forgot that Ontario doesn't regulate members in training due to some wonky legislation.  You can sign up for the Engineering Internship Program, but it isn't required to get your license.  You can submit your experience after you have your 48 months (12 of which can come from pre-grad experience if you have it) without ever having talked to the association.    You could submit an anonymous note to PEO, asking this very same question and see what their response is.  The people that work there in discipline and enforcement will likely give you some decent info.  My guess is that the answer you're going to get is that the code of ethics states that members must act with devotion to high ideals of personal honour and professional integrity and pirating software is an offense that is punishable under the act. You could try to discuss the ethical dilemma with your boss.  You might not get anywhere, but at least you can tell yourself that you tried.  Alternatively, you could try discussing with some colleagues, to see what they think.  Maybe the others are in the same boat and just haven't brought it up out of fear. You could try contacting the software companies to discuss with them.  The programs sound quite dated, maybe those software companies don't actually care.  This one is risky though, because if they do care then you're really in a pickle.  You'll be obligated to push your concerns higher.   Ultimately, it's up to you.  Your boss is currently operating in contravention of the act.  I imagine this is not a rare occurrence (pirated software at professional places).    I'd encourage you to think about this though - being a self-regulated profession means that the regulators (the professional associations) rely on the membership to keep each other in check.  If we, as a profession, want to have the trust of the public, then we need to demonstrate that we are serious about regulating ourselves."
engineering,3c03vx,me_and_batman,38,Fri Jul 3 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"Ethics, bro. Choose the harder right over the easier wrong. Just asking this question, I think you already know the answer. I would take it up the company's chain of command, and if you get fired then you didn't want to work there anyway. If they take your advice then you prove yourself to be an honest, ethical worker.   Also, if they do fire you, just let the software company know about their piracy, but I wouldn't use that as a bargaining/blackmail chip."

I was in a situation once with an employer where I took a stand over a clear ethics violation. I didn't get fired, pretty much only because my supervisor took a stand with me. It was a real possibility though, especially if my supervisor hadn't agreed with me.   Edit: another thing... If you're in that situation and you've been fired, it might be worth mentioning the labour board.

All nuclear power plants boil water to generate electricity but they still obviously can melt down and don't appear to be self-regulating like the commentator claims this one is.
engineering,3c0t61,sts816,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"You may know about the difference between PWR and BWR. The self regulating effect discussed here is due to the fact that in BWR more power means more bubbles, which means less water, so less moderation of neutrons so less fissions, so less power. In theory (without this effect), if a critical core has its reactivity increased even slightly, the power should increase exponentially, in practice, the power rises, then stabilizes to a new equilibrium in which the bubbles created lower the reactivity to compensate the power generated. This is observe in the first part of the video. But this only works up to a certain point, if the excess boiling required to compensate the excess reactivity cannot be achieved because (to put it simply) there are not enough water to boil fast enough, you get kind of reaction in the second part. Here, notice how there are only a small number of control rods, and they are dropping the central one. In actual BWR, a large number of control rods are used so that they each have a small reactivity effect (called control rod worth), so that even if one of them is ejected, for whatever reason, you dont get this kind of violent reaction. Now this is about reactivity in operation, when you have water to boil. Fukshima has demonstrated what was already known: you dont need a critical core to have heat, used fuel is hot by itself (and this thermal power is independent of the boiling water around it); you need to cool it even after shutdown; if you cant cool it anymore (because you lost the water), then it is hot enough to melt itself.    TL;DR: the self regulating effect is about the regulation of fission (neutrons, chain reaction): more fission means more bubble which means less fissions = equilibrium rather than unlimited exponential increase. Fukushima is about residual heat (fission products, no need for neutrons): no more water means no more cooling = melting.  An even more extreme self regulating example. But here too, if you have a bunch of used fuel without cooling, it will melt. Chernobyl is the exact opposite of BWR: more power = even more power. because of a Positive void coefficient."
engineering,3c0t61,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:28:22 2015 UTC,"Boiling water reactor:       The boiling water reactor (BWR) is a type of light water nuclear reactor used for the generation of electrical power. It is the second most common type of electricity-generating nuclear reactor after the pressurized water reactor (PWR), also a type of light water nuclear reactor. The main difference between a BWR and PWR is that in a BWR, the reactor core heats water, which turns to steam and then drives a steam turbine. In a PWR, the reactor core heats water, which does not boil. This hot water then exchanges heat with a lower pressure water system, which turns to steam and drives the turbine. The BWR was developed by the Idaho National Laboratory and General Electric (GE) in the mid-1950s. The main present manufacturer is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, which specializes in the design and construction of this type of reactor.

The Chernobyl accident was caused by a power excursion (possible due to poor design an operation) but this can't happen with western reactor designs. What can happen is that the fuel can overheat after shutdown because it carries on producing heat due to radioactive decay of fission products. This drops to a small fraction of full power quite quickly, but it can still be many megawatts of heat in a small space. If cooling is not maintained, the fuel will eventually melt - this is what happened at TMI and Fukushima. In both cases, the damage only started well after the reactors were shut down."

If it has no knowledge of its previous life or experiences then it is no different than cloning, and at that point I'd recommend adopting one of the countless millions in shelters that are waiting to die before you go recreating ones needlessly.

Animals are only primarily test subjects, so your point about animals shelters are inappropriate!   Second, we can try to recreate a lot of memories via forensic analysis of neurological proteins, and even bone and hair samples in the case of a very decomposed corpse. We can have data to work with by measuring certain flaws in the DNA transcription process to create those proteins, in such it will give accurate clues such as personality, and even many memories. While we probably can't recreate all memories, one must also realize that, animals(including humans) loose memories all the time, and create new ones a lot too, the human mind is far from the workings of a computer in its complexities and quirks. Perhaps with further research we can accurately recreate memories from many years back. Epigenetics is a field in which I am highly enthused with, which will most likely help with this procedure ultimately. I am of the opinion that this technology will be developed by a team in around 20 years hence.   In short, yes this technology can recreate the personal identity of the animal in question. In fact if I was to die, and this procedure was preformed on me in another 20 years, it will be like falling to sleep and waking up again, without a lapse, and to no inconvenience to me at all!"

So why is it when people think that if they die and replicate themselves it would be waking up again?  its not you nor will it ever be. it is a copy at best, it may seem like you, it may act as you would have in your absence but your continuity and its existence aren't one and the same.       I am not saying your Idea/invention is impossible but what you wish to achieve is already roughly available, studies have successfully cloned creatures, and studies have successfully inserted false memories, altered memories  and erased memories.  Now obviously your seeking to do this on a higher level than currently available but my question is ""what are you trying to accomplish?, a mimic clone of ones dead self?"" And finally on an ethics note, if you map protein strands that are the causal link to specific memories, then it is not too far from being able to manipulate these proteins to create false memories which could be used to then create/clone people for specific purposes that believe exactly what you programmed them to think and therefore would literally have no true free will or control in which case a variety of monstrous outcomes become not only plausible but likely."

What stuck out to me is how stable it could be and its potential for efficient use of nuclear materials. I hope research really gets restructured soon."
engineering,3bwjpu,NoUrImmature,17,Thu Jul 2 20:34:04 2015 UTC,"Sadly, many different concepts are often merged together: salt/ liquid fuel/ thorium. The development of each and their respective advantages/ limits are very specifics. Salt as coolant is reasonable; liquid U/Pu molten fuel is achievable with moderate R&D (mostly chemistry); thorium, while promising in the long run, requires a quite different fuel cycle technology with heavy constraints on radioprotection, with the main option being on site fuel processing, which multiply the cost/efficiency of each plant (not unlike accelerator driven subcritical reactor needing their own accelerator)."
engineering,3bwjpu,jt7724,4,Thu Jul 2 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, over all the video seemed very unbiased and fair to the relative benefits and drawbacks of the technology. But towards the end they came dangerously close to disparaging  the experiments going on now as not going far enough to develop the technology. Those guys working on molten salt cooling of solid fuel pellets seem to be on the right track while also remaining pragmatic about how much can realistically be accomplished and how quickly. I hope this technology continues to have a groundswell of support because it deserves a chance and just having people talk about it and know about it is going to go a long way towards it getting the funding it needs."

A big issue is dealing with safety.  Not too many people want to work with hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen, and liquid beryllium compounds at 600C.  Those who want to may be hampered by safety concerns in an over-safety-consensus lab environment.  If you can't make the salt, you can't do the research.  The University of Wisconsin - Madison, over the past two years, has repurified roughly 51 kg of Li7 flibe from the MSRE and made 40kg of their own salt---the largest batch in 50 years.   Things are moving along, but it definitely is taking a while since the budget at UW was roughly 1 million with 2 full time PhDs and a master student.  A lot of chemistry expertise and experience was developed in this time.  I remain doubtful, but hopeful, of China's efforts.  They say they have a staff of 500 PhDs, but the progress over there is very slow and HIGHLY intertwined with politics.  Stay tuned, this isn't something that gets done in 5, 10, or 20 years.

He probably could have gotten a film student and had them edit it together.  But it looks like the issue was more than just the editing.  The actual footage was kinda crappy.  He never sat anyone down and had them talk and asked them questions in a way that could be more easily edited later.  Also that video was literally all over the place.  In many places jumping from one person's sentence to another.   He could've invested in lights.  Spent time on a script or questions to ask.  Had people sit down properly for an interview.  That would've added on a couple grand.    Had someone do proper editing of that footage, again 2k.    Paid someone to do a voice over, 1k.    That's like 12k.  Again if this is the person we're talking about.  In the first place he mentioned spending 1k on it and was looking for 10k more.  It's not a big budget thing."

engineering,3bv8mf,bigpolar70,2,Thu Jul 2 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not in europe, but I compared those values to the ASCE 7-10.  Section 4.5.1 gives a concentrated load of 0.89 kN and a distributed load of 0.73 kN/m, both in any direction, as the minimum load that handrail and guardrail systems should resist.    Commentary on this section states: ""Loads on handrail and guardrail systems are highly dependent on the use and occupancy of the protected area.  For cases in which extreme loads can be anticipated, such as long straight runs of guardrail systems against which crowds can surge, appropriate increase in loading shall be considered.""  Based on that, I would say that the loading requirement is based on safety, designed to prevent a single person leaning against the wall from knocking it over.  Testing was probably just having people lean/fall against rails and adding a factor of safety to the load.  If your masonry wall is serving any other purpose, such as a partial retaining wall, then that load may not be appropriate."

I think it goes back to the point I made above that people who are really good don't use headhunters, they find their own work through word of mouth.  The whole ""who you know"" thing goes both ways, and when you're trying to hire it's just as important to be able to bring in good new hires through who you know rather than relying on randoms through an agency."

If said company are really interested in you they can sort out the problem with the recruiting agency.  If the recruiting agency calls you, send them directly to the company. If the recruiting company is smart,  they won't jeopardize their relationship with the company over one client. As a hiring manager I've been on the other side of this,  where by I found the candidate and the agency is now saying they are a client. Typically, I tell the recruiting company to go fuck themselves. Honestly,  you're best bet is avoid recruitng companies and focus on getting a contact on the inside.

engineering,3brgdo,slolift,4,Thu Jul 2 04:16:40 2015 UTC,Hahaha indeed! I just got a call from Aerotek a few months ago.  They had my resume from pre graduation in 2007 and wanted to see if I wanted a drafting tech job. Needless to say that would have been a downgrade.
engineering,3brgdo,sniper1rfa,12,Thu Jul 2 06:00:21 2015 UTC,Aerotek was fine for me I guess. I guess if you get a job and everything goes fine you like them.
engineering,3brgdo,KingMango,6,Wed Jul 1 19:08:51 2015 UTC,I've had good luck with Aerotek too. All 4 jobs I've had since graduating has been through them.
engineering,3brgdo,sniper1rfa,8,Wed Jul 1 22:04:54 2015 UTC,All 4 jobs I've had since graduating has been through them.   How long have you been out and why have you gone through 4 jobs in that time frame?
engineering,3brgdo,Skiffbug,3,Thu Jul 2 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"I graduated in 2011 with Mechanical Engineering degree. My first job was a contract job (through Aerotek) doing quality work at a medical device company. I liked the company, but didn't like being in quality. I didn't get hired on at the end of the 6 month contract.  My second job was a contract job (through Aerotek) doing quality work at a small machine shop that did aerospace work. They kept me on a little longer than the original contract, but they got rid of me after about 8 months.  My third and kind of third and half job was at a medium size machine shop that did aerospace work. I started off on a contract I got through Aerotek doing quality work. That lasted a year and due to money trouble the company laid off all of their contractors. I was unemployed for about 4 months and the same company hired me back full time as a quality engineer. I still didn't like working in quality, but it was nice to have a stable job.  After being full time for a year, Aerotek contacted me about a full time manufacturing engineering position at first place I worked at (medical device company). I had been wanting a manufacturing engineering position since graduating and thankfully got the job. I am still at this job and it is the first one I've enjoyed since graduating.  So to answer your question. I went through four jobs because I kept taking contract jobs in a position that I never wanted to be in. I only took the jobs because I needed to pay the bills, I wasn't willing to relocate and I wasn't getting any other offers, so I never really put my full effort into any of those jobs. I also didn't help that moved to another part of the country shortly before graduating, so I didn't have any contacts from school or previous internships to help get my career started."

Whenever they submitted me for a job, it lead to an interview and usually a job."
engineering,3brgdo,slolift,8,Thu Jul 2 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"I've had pretty decent luck with Aerotek, insomuch as they don't send me a bunch of bogus leads or jobs I've already applied for.  I do wish they had a more centralized system, though.  I get calls from them for different areas (part of the problem being that I'm actually looking to relocate so I get hits all over the country) and they're always a different person.  You know, if I could just work with two or three guys at your firm instead of every freaking one of them, it'd probably go a lot easier for everyone."
engineering,3brgdo,lowdownporto,2,Wed Jul 1 22:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I felt like Aerotek found some very legit jobs for me and they seem to have good relationships with companies, but holy shit their recruiters are aggressive. For a couple weeks I had two Aerotek recruiters working together and they would call me at least twice a day, no exaggeration. Like, I don't have any more to tell you when I just spoke to you 4 hours ago and you know I'm at work.   And when I eventually turned them down because I accepted another offer the guy acted all sad and exasperated. Very weird."

engineering,3brgdo,TiltedPlacitan,10,Wed Jul 1 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"It discourages nobody.  A word document 'exported' or 'printed as PDF' is as good as text.  A corporate license of adobe acrobat is what, a few hundred, maybe a thousand tops...  You can LITERALLY completely edit anything in a PDF with acrobat.  The best way to keep it from being edited is to either put a security lock on it (can still easily be hacked if you have $25 for a one time fee) or to print it on paper, scan it as a picture, then print that picture as a PDF.    I just realized I know way too much about editing PDFs.  Edit:  I'd like to point out why editing a typical resume is so easy.    If you export a word doc as a PDF or even if you hit print then chose PDF as your source, you still have text.  Even with the free reader software you can just select it, and paste back into word.  Then edit it how you want, and print or export a new PDF.    It's way too easy.    If you print paper, then scan, then PDF, you have an image, not text.    The problem with this is that many companies use a keyword search bot.  If yours is an image, it'll find nothing.  And if you think the underpaid HR person is going to read your resume instead of just trashing it... I have some beachfront property to sell you in Kansas."
engineering,3brgdo,IcanCwhatUsay,4,Thu Jul 2 02:40:33 2015 UTC,My experience has been that the crappy ones are also technically illiterate. It discourages them.  I didnt say it stops them. It's just irritating enough for them to move on to somebody else unless they're serious.

The way around it was to hire me as a contract employee and then go through the contract to hire process. They ended up paying less for me, and I actually ended up getting paid more (since I didn't have benefits). Most recruiters have a certain period of time you have to be contracted to do this - for me it was 3 months.     May be worth a look if this is a possible option for you.

I make a hell of a lot more money doing this job than if I'd followed the career paths more normally associated with my degrees but that still isn't my driving factor. Plus I make the money because I'm actually good at what I do, I understand the jobs I work on and I'm on the same level intellectually as most of the candidates I deal with.  Not all recruiters are bad, take the time to find a good one who only works in your niche area of expertise and who actually understands it.

Stepper motors have rock solid speed regulation even open loop.

Assuming this is a technical evaluation, of something you have already received some kind of bid that is based on a scope of work (or similar). All you would need to do in the first instance is check that all the things that were requested are included, check if they have raised exceptions, prepare a list of clarifications for the subcontractor and the score them in order of preference.

Pretty much any of the Hysol EA family of adhesives will work well (though they aren't cheap), read the information about them to find out what works best.   Also, depending on what you are doing and how resistant the adherends are to elevated temperatures and pressures, you really can't beat an autoclave cured film adhesive.

Yes you get a lot of vacation, yes you get comp days constantly so that you maintain your required minimum rest, yes you get paid to use your vacation days (in addition to your normal salary), but it is impossible to get things done. Everyone is always out and there's no obvious accountability for it. Outside work it is not the utopia I was lead to believe. There are fat people. There are homeless people. Cities are still dirty and full of crime. Everyone smokes or chews. Rent control has created a multi-year wait list for apartment rentals. I still have to buy health insurance. As a childless, working person, I'm not entirely sure how the exorbitant taxes are benefiting me.

It is basically a hiring frenzy around here right now and it is only getting worse as many older workers are trying to retire but they are being asked to stay on until replacements can be found. They are not the only ones. If you are an EE, Ford was offering in the paper a full payoff of student loans up to $50,000 or so, a $15,000 signing bonus, and a $55,000 starting salary for 1/2 years of experience as long as you signed a 3 year contract that included pay raises in it starting 3 months in.   If you do not like Automotive related engineering there is aerospace (Boeing, General Electric, Leer), chemical (DOW, BASF), electrical (nearly every power company including DTE, Detroit Edison, and Whirlpool), and military(Northrup Grumman, General Dynamics). I have seen engineering firms sprout up like weeds around here and major companies move into the area because of the skill level of workers and the importance as a transportation hub. We recently started getting Northrup Grumman commercials starting to air on TV and they do not really tend to sell products to the public so their aim has to be at hiring."

engineering,3blqul,btone911,9,Tue Jun 30 11:12:28 2015 UTC,Many people are still being worked to death at extremely low salaries.  I don't feel the need.    Which is it? You think people are being worked to death or you don't feel the need?  You've been to Rostock. You know how engineering works over there. Heck doctors are in a Union in Germany. Consequently corporations don't get to walk over employees across the spectrum.
engineering,3blqul,WallyReflector,19,Tue Jun 30 11:23:33 2015 UTC,"I personally don't feel the need to unionize. I am also not salary for a reason, because of the hours.  Should others? Maybe they have to. Many people are being overworked and not paid for it. Which is wrong in many ways."
engineering,3blqul,DStoo,2,Tue Jun 30 11:25:51 2015 UTC,Or just go work somewhere else. It doesn't take very many good engineers walking out the door to get HR to look at why.
engineering,3blqul,WallyReflector,6,Tue Jun 30 11:34:32 2015 UTC,You haven't worked where I've worked. It's much easier for HR to stick their head in the sand than address a retention problem.
engineering,3blqul,DStoo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:21:09 2015 UTC,That still sounds like their problem not yours. Allowing someone else's inability to do their job should not effect your calculation of whether the work you do is commiserate to the compensation you earn.

engineering,3blqul,1wiseguy,7,Tue Jun 30 14:56:56 2015 UTC,I worked a union job while paying my way through college.    So why not take everything that sucked about that union and make sure an Engineering union doesn't fall to those same issues?  Unions are a touchy subject with most engineers because they are only really exposed to a few unions.  Some unions suck. I would the UAW would go down in a flaming zeppelin never to come back. Some unions don't suck. All or almost all engineers in Germany are in unions of some sort. They exist to protect workers rights but when the means to the end becomes toxic (UAW) the union needs to move on.   and the company I chose to work for recognizes that.   And when a H-1B will do that work? Or when you're asked to work OT because you're salaried and they don't have to pay you?

If your goal is to discourage companies from wanting employees to work >40 hrs, straight overtime doesn't help. Since they typically bill clients 2.X times your hourly rate, unless your overtime is like 2 times your normal rate, companies will still want overtime."
engineering,3blqul,juandh,-16,Wed Jul 1 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"Hold on.   Engineers are usually salaried, and don't get overtime pay. They also earn over $100K, with lots of experience.  They knew the terms of their job when they hired in, and they can bail and find another job if they want. They could probably find work as contractors at an hourly rate, but without benefits.  A deal is a deal. These are educated people who have made an informed decision. I don't see what's unfair about it."
engineering,3blqul,Direlion,-8,Wed Jul 1 12:21:35 2015 UTC,"You can't force an employer to pay you more. It's a free country. An employment agreement is a mutual thing, and you both agree to it.  Let's say you work as a manager at a store for a fixed $30K/year, and you put in 55 hours a week, with 2 weeks of vacation. That works out to about $10.91/hour.   It doesn't sound good to me, but it's well over minimum wage. The employer could just pay you $10/hour, and it would be slightly less. Where is this going?"
engineering,3blqul,ryumast3r,5,Wed Jul 1 12:51:46 2015 UTC,It's not a fair deal if one side gets to collectively bargain and the other doesn't.
engineering,3blqul,Jewnadian,-4,Tue Jun 30 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"Collectively bargain? Are you saying that several employers get together and agree to fix wages?  That's not out of the question, but I don't think it happens often. It's illegal, and it would take some serious effort.  I think you're just looking at some employers who offer similar deals, and saying there's no choice. That's how a free market usually works. If you shop around for gasoline, you'll see similar prices, but that doesn't mean there's anything shady going on."

engineering,3blqul,Baconaise,8,Tue Jun 30 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"While I do think there is an upper limit to when OT should be mandatory, this is not one of those ""suck it up"" cases.  If you stole a printer from your employer that would be pretty messed up right? They could fire you for it?  Yet if they steal 2-4 hours a day of your time it's ""part of the job"".  The only problem with the whole ""find another job"" clause is that employers always have more power if you live in a small town you might not be able to find another job, if you are taking care of sick parents or living somewhere so your kids are in a good school you might not have an option to get another job.  The employer always has more negotiating power than the employee, but really it's a sign of how broken american work culture is when taking working unpaid OT as an engineer as seen as  fair."
engineering,3blqul,Rollingprobablecause,6,Tue Jun 30 21:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, we make an informed choice based on the options available to us. Show me an employer who is paying $100K or even $60k with overtime pay and I'd probably take that, but it wasn't in the list of my choices when I made my  informed decision.  The ""you can just go out and find another job"" line is bullshit for minimum wage and it's bullshit for six-figure salaries. Getting to choose between two shit options is not a fair choice.  There are reasonable arguments for why high-salaried positions could be expected a certain amount of overtime, especially in engineering. But this dogma of the pure free market where the status quo is fair and just so you plebs should shut up, knuckle under and be glad you have jobs is a pile of crap."
engineering,3blqul,Shintasama,-4,Tue Jun 30 23:07:20 2015 UTC,"In our society, there is a free market. You can buy and sell goods and services, and there is no authority to decide the prices or the terms, as a general rule.  For example, if you want a new car, you are free to go to a dealer and negotiate the price. If you can't get the price you want, you can go try another dealer.  However, that doesn't mean you can get what you want. You can't get a new Corolla for $12,000. No dealer will do that.  Does that mean that ""go to another dealer"" is a bullshit option? That you have to pick from several shit deals, so it's not a fair choice? Should we have laws that compel car dealers to sell us cars for the price that we want?  I don't think so. I think the free market works just fine. We don't always get what we want, and that's just how it is."
engineering,3blqul,ablarry91,5,Tue Jun 30 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"Gee thanks for the lesson! Why don't you explain what money is while you're pretending that anyone who disagrees with you must be an uneducated child?  The point that eludes you is what is ""fair"" need not be defined by the free market. It is simply a method of exchange, not a god. In most cases letting things happen on their own is the best option. But where some people choose not to exercise critical thought or judgment and bow to their dogma that the free market is always just and fair, others notice that the free market does have its flaws and injustices like any other system, and seek to correct it.  One instance is in the matter of wages. If an employer and employee fail to agree to a contract, the individual will starve sooner than the company will go out of business. This asymmetry creates an advantage in favor of the employer, and at times can become extreme. Hence we as a people decide to put laws in place to counteract this and to raise the overall quality of life. As a brief example I would point to child labor laws, which I'm sure you've heard about before. By government intervention in the free market to put children in schools instead of factories, we now have a large, educated middle class that is better trained, more productive and has a higher quality of life. But I'm sure you feel this is unfair and we should have been content with the strain and poverty of the 19th century.  I would go on, but I suppose this topic is not really fit for /r/engineering, and I doubt either of us will change the other's mind anyway."

engineering,3blqul,chaosbutters,4,Tue Jun 30 21:53:56 2015 UTC,I doubt any company is going to double your salary to avoid paying you overtime. I mean it's still helpful and a good thing and everything. But for a handful who were being paid $48k-$50k are just going to see a small raise that isn't commensurate with what they would (should?) be making in overtime.
engineering,3blqul,orange2o,2,Tue Jun 30 13:09:24 2015 UTC,Are there any figures on the impact? My impression is that a lot of companies could raise the wages of everyone making $25k/year to $50k/year and remain profitable. The reasons that they don't basically boil down to greed and short-term profit focus.

Even a 1% margin for a company that brings in billions of dollars is a huge amount. I have not worked at a single company with that low a percentage even in oil and gas the average margin was around 5%.

engineering,3bo67b,getawombatupya,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:58:22 2015 UTC,"First all congrats.   The best bet is to find a book that covers a bit of everything. The plant engineers that seem to succeed the best, in my opinion, are the ones that know about 60 to 80% of the basic ideas and constraints in the main fields: Electrical, Automation/Control, Mechanical, and Process/Chemical.    The idea is that you don't need to know how to do all of the calculations for each field, but have an understanding of the constraints, requirements, limiting factors, and safety issues. Example: head pressure on pumps, amp capacity of cables and full load amps of motors, transformer power ratings, types of valves and their pros/cons, types of vessels and their limiting variables (like boilers, heat exchangers, reactors, dryers, scrubbers, conveyors).    There will always be ""that one guy"" who is the expert in his specific field. When you understand the constraints, safety issues, and limiting factors of each, you take your final design or questions and ideas for each individual topic to him.    Why is this so key? While everyone else has spent three weeks scratching their head and scouring information to solve a very specific technical detail, you will have already taken an entire project or problem to about the 95% mark.   I have yet to find a book that covers all of this, so let me know.    What I do recommend, and this seems like common sense, is to just google and wiki any questions that come up in your head on a daily basis and keep things organized in a program like evernote that you can use to reference on your phone in the middle of meetings.  Look for webpages that go into the least amount of detail and offer simple explanations. You want the birds eye understanding behind the fundamentals of how something works, and what you would need to apply it versus getting lost in trying to calculate flux density of a medium.   Youtube is also a fantastic resource to find animations of just about anything.  Hope this helps and good luck.

engineering,3bn45n,lookin4fun09,4,Tue Jun 30 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"In an axial compressor, you can only get a pressure ratio of 20x max out of one compressor. To overcome this, you can use multiple spindles, so most engines have a low pressure compressor and a high pressure compressor. Each of these gets driven by a different turbine because they have different rotational speeds. High pressure turbine drives the high pressure compressor, low pressure turbine drives the low pressure compressor (and often the fan). Some engine also have an intermediate pressure spindle, which helps to prevent engine stall and allows for even higher pressure ratios.  It should be noted that this isn't what '2 stage turbine' means though. Stages are the number of rotor-stator pairs on an axial compressor or turbine. Typically the high pressure turbine has one or two stages while the low pressure turbine has between five and eight. There is a maximum amount of power you can get out of one stage, so if your compressor needs more power, you have to add more stages. Also, the more power you take out of the airflow, the less power one stage can pull out of it."
engineering,3bn45n,skpkzk2,2,Tue Jun 30 17:15:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for correctly distinguishing between stages and axial rotors.  Rolls-Royce makes three-rotor engines. Pratt & Whitney is in final testing of a two rotor engine with a reduction gear on the main fan: even higher efficiency and a lot lower noise. GE prefers exotic materials to make them bigger and hotter.  However, they all have many stages in the compressor, each locked to one of the rotor shafts. Air ping-pongs through alternating stages of rotor blades and stator vanes (non-rotating blades). This zig-zag airflow and narrowing core space forces the air to get squeezed to very high pressures before the fuel is atomized into it and combusted."

engineering,3bhlng,XS4Me,3,Mon Jun 29 14:37:52 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't ship radar pick it up?
engineering,3bhlng,deletive-expleted,23,Mon Jun 29 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"There's a concept called the horizon, which is where the Earth curves away from you, and so you cannot see beyond it. The taller you are, the further away the horizon is. Ships have a radar horizon, which is why the heavy radars are always up high--higher radars mean the ship can see further.  If you are looking for something, it can stay below the horizon longer if it is lower. This is why most anti-ship missiles fly only a few dozen feet off the surface--to stay below the horizon as long as possible. Once they pass the horizon, the ships can see them.  This makes it hard for ships to detect Ekranoplans, Ships, and low-flying aircraft at long distance. By putting your radar in an AWACS and flying at 20,000 feet, you can extend your horizon quite far. You can also do things like fly your radar away from the carrier, so the enemy can only see your AWACS, not your carrier. Remember--radar horizon works both ways, so the Ekranoplan has a tough time seeing the carrier, too. Can't get too close; the carrier and her escorts have missiles.  That's the problem with the Ekranoplan, and naval combat in general--reconnaissance and targeting. If the Ekranoplan uses its radar to find the carrier, two things will happen. First, it won't see the carrier, because the carrier is below the radar horizon. Second, every fighter in the area will see the Ekranoplan, because they are up high, so their horizon is tremendously far.   So the Ekranoplan can't use its radar if it wants to get close, but that means somebody else needs to find the carrier, and that somebody needs to survive long enough to talk to the Ekranoplan and give good enough info for targeting. Then the Ekranoplan has to go to its launch point, and by the time it gets there the carrier will have moved, so it needs new targeting info to launch. Even if it launches, 6 P-270s probably aren't enough to saturate a single Aegis ship's defensive capabilities. Also, hope no carrier aircraft flies over you with its radar turned off, because if it sees you you're still fucked.  Ekranoplans are pretty incredible, but they're hardly some sort of carrier-killing silver bullet."

There are anti-missile missiles. If they can see a cruise missile coming at them, then they can shoot at it. These don't have to be fired from the carrier either but one of their support vessels.  Also, there is the Phalanx guns as a last line of defense. They are basically a modern gatling gun that try to put a wall of lead in front of the missile. I think the Navy is also testing lasers in this role?"

Where in the general area? Remember, you're searching an area of ocean that is thousands of miles across, and littered with carrier-sized ships. The P-270 missile has a range of 75 miles, and there are plenty of aircraft from both sides flying around. I imagine the Ekranoplan would wait in some soviet-controlled area, because if it waits 200 miles offshore in the Bay of Biscay you can expect there will be rather a large number of NATO aircraft flying around.  Actually, looking at the traditional coastline of the USSR, this thing is rather useless. It's based in the Black Sea, which means to get at a carrier you have to fight your way past the Bosporus and the Dardanelles (both are within a NATO country and so narrow that tanks can shoot from one side to the other, and both would almost certainly be mined to hell), and then you end up in the Mediterranean. So you have to deal with Turkey's, Greece's, Spain's, and Italy's air forces, and the USAF. All the while you're trying to find a carrier strike group, which is sailing all over the place and pretty much constantly engaging south-eastern Europe Warsaw Pact countries, or is helping Turkey keep the Black Sea Fleet penned in, while the Black Sea Fleet is trying to fuck over Turkey enough to get through the straits, which probably means two amphibious assaults or that's not happening.  All the while here you are, little Ekranoplan, don't know where the carrier is and hope nobody in NATO sees you because you have two tiny gun turrets and they all have missiles.  I can see why the USSR didn't make any more of them. They're great for keeping people off your coastline, except the USSR didn't have a coastline. They had warm-water ports with no NATO-free access to the sea, and they had really brutal cold-water bad weather ports which are great for subs, but not for small ships like this.   What defensive capabilities are those?   Assume a typical Aegis escort vessel can shoot down an incoming anti-ship missile every one to two seconds (two seconds includes misses), and can see them 20 km out or more. The number is almost certainly higher now, but that's the firing rate limitation on the SM-2's shipboard terminal illumination radars. I would be surprised if the ESSM or SM-6 can't fire much more rapidly."

Not the least since aircraft carriers seem pretty useless in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas where you always have a coastal port to launch your airplanes from. At least I know that was our government's official stance back in the time of Yugoslavia: ""We don't need an aircraft carrier because our every island is an aircraft carrier [and we have a thousand of those]""."
engineering,3bhlng,Uberbobo7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"I know early in the Cold War the US routinely deployed carriers to the Mediterranean, to give them the ability to hit eastern Europe with nukes. I don't know about late in the Cold War.  At the same time, Yugoslavia wasn't part of the Warsaw Pact, and so most of the Mediterranean was close to, more or less, only NATO airbases. That makes it a reasonably safe place to put a carrier.  In other words, there's no point building a carrier for the Mediterranean, but if you already have one, there's no reason not to put it in there. An airbase with 70 fighters and 4 SAM batteries is pretty potent, even if very expensive.  It's not really clear why Yugoslavia would want a carrier, though. It would be mega expensive, not much use for fighting the Warsaw Pact, and it would be suicide to fight NATO from inside the Mediterranean. Too many airbases, not enough sea to hide in."

engineering,3bkua2,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:47:03 2015 UTC,"Creep (deformation):       In materials science, creep (sometimes called cold flow) is the tendency of a solid material to move slowly or deform permanently under the influence of mechanical stresses. It can occur as a result of long-term exposure to high levels of stress that are still below the yield strength of the material. Creep is more severe in materials that are subjected to heat for long periods, and generally increases as they near their melting point.  The rate of deformation is a function of the material properties, exposure time, exposure temperature and the applied structural load. Depending on the magnitude of the applied stress and its duration, the deformation may become so large that a component can no longer perform its function — for example creep of a turbine blade will cause the blade to contact the casing, resulting in the failure of the blade. Creep is usually of concern to engineers and metallurgists when evaluating components that operate under high stresses or high temperatures. Creep is a deformation mechanism that may or may not constitute a failure mode. For example, moderate creep in concrete is sometimes welcomed because it relieves tensile stresses that might otherwise lead to cracking.  Unlike brittle fracture, creep deformation does not occur suddenly upon the application of stress. Instead, strain accumulates as a result of long-term stress. Therefore, creep is a ""time-dependent"" deformation.  The temperature range in which creep deformation may occur differs in various materials. For example, tungsten requires a temperature in the thousands of degrees before creep deformation can occur, while ice will creep at temperatures near 0 °C (32 °F).  As a general guideline, the effects of creep deformation generally become noticeable at approximately 30% of the melting point (as measured on a thermodynamic temperature scale such as Kelvin or Rankine) for metals, and at 40–50% of melting point for ceramics. [citation needed] Virtually any material will creep upon approaching its melting temperature. Since the creep minimum temperature is related to the melting point, creep can be seen at relatively low temperatures for some materials. Plastics and low-melting-temperature metals, including many solders, can begin to creep at room temperature, as can be seen markedly in old lead hot-water pipes. Glacier flow is an example of creep processes in ice.    Image i     Relevant: Superalloy | Refractory metals | Deformation (engineering)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Coupled to the end of this drive shaft is a second shaft coaxial with the first, which is in turn attached to a squared piston in a square-shaped channel--not sure if that's the best terminology. The piston has to be driven down the square-shaped channel by the drive shaft, and in order to do that it has to be able to be rotated independently of the drive shaft.  The entire mechanism has to be able to be disassembled by the end user for maintenance, cleaning, and part modularity. The way they want this to be done is a quick-connect mechanism between the drive  shaft and the secondary shaft.  I'll try to provide a sketch during lunch."

HiFi headphone jacks can handle more power with only 3 channels maximum.

There is also something to be said for putting in the hard work now, while your family is still young, so you're in a better position to put more time into your family later.    What I said about my dad is true and I stand behind it.  Some things I didn't say, however, are things like my mom stayed home and growing up in a single-income household where raising kids was prioritized had its downsides, like my parents were constantly worried about money, and it showed, even though they never said so directly to us.  (I can grocery shop like it's an olympic sport though, so I guess that's kind of cool.)    We moved four times growing up because when my dad got laid off (as is common at the end of a contract in his industry), he couldn't afford to take more than a few weeks to find his next job and that often required accepting work in a new city or region.  One result of that is until I got married, I never lived in a place where I had a solid support network (friends or family) outside of my nuclear family.

I had an internship for 8 weeks in a small shop and they basically let me do whatver I wanted (after they showed me how to operate everything of course). I machined parts for my bike, I made handles for my closets and some other random stuff. I also made stuff they needed for their projects. Hell, I even worked alone on a 200,000€ custom machine they had to deliver 2 weeks after that. The boss showed me the problem, said ""fix that if you want, but it has to look nice"" and went home. It took me almost 2 days, but in the end, it was fixed, looked nice and boss said ""good job, you learn fast"" and disappeared again."

I feel you in your expense burden, but really your employer should help with some of this. As for having up-to-date versions, it depends on the code.  For ASCE 7, you need to have version 7-10 for wind, but 7-05 will be fine for everything else, including seismic.  IBC 2012 references ASCE 7-10 but is otherwise mostly the same as IBC 2006/2009.  For wood, masonry, and concrete, you could probably get by with some older codes, but I heard Appendix D in ACI 318 got a serious overhaul in the latest revision in which case you'd have to at least get that section for the test.  Honestly, I'd find a mate who's taking the same test, and split the cost of the materials and then spend a day at Kinko's copying what you need. Considering you're only doing this for a test, there isn't anything unethical about that.  Sorry about this, but this is just the cost of getting licensed."

engineering,3bcu1g,Snowboardyn,2,Sun Jun 28 01:21:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say a older copy of the CERM should be OK, you won't use it for much beyond fundamental equations from collage. The PE costs a lot, you should be able to recoup much of the cost selling the codes used.  Ask arround see what you can borrow.  I'm a bit surprised work won't let you borrow code books from work for the test.  I took about $2000 in just code books (transportation), plus a few text books I was more familiar with and the CERM and used every book.    As for using older codes, it is a gamble.  Some codes only have minor tweaks, you may be OK, but if they ask a question on something that changed you are out of luck.  Keep in mind the structure of the test and make your decisions based on what the test looks like.  (also that is my general PE exam advice, know the test and approach the test strategically, don't expect to get it all)  $1500 seems like a lot for a class too, the class I took was like $200.  Good luck, it is great when it is over."

Starting late career-wise, I focused on project management where maturity and breadth of knowledge is probably more important than engineering chops.  Leverage the work experience, and keep on if they'll let you, or find something in an engineering related company closer to your ideal (even if it's grunt-work).    I worked the last two years of my degree driving admin spreadsheets (dull-as-can-be) for a mid-sized engineering consultant firm.  It was great on the whole - my colleagues were working engineers, the managers and owners (themselves engineers) were sympathetic and I learned a lot that school doesn't teach."

I have spent about ten years working in bars, kindergardens, playing in bands and generally becoming more independent and mature.   It might also be relevant to mention that I have lived with a very active Crohn's disease since 1996, and that that has slowed me down academically in the past (I spent 2 extra years just to finish ""High School"" (we don't call it that in Norway), with surgeries to remove parts of my colon and small intestine leaving me hospitalized.  The last two years while studying 100% I have been living with my girlfriend, and working part-time to get enough money to survive. In the same time my Crohn's disease has been very active and caused me to develop Amyloidosis which has given me Kidney-failure as well. So the last year has been very rough, and I was hospitalized last fall and barely passed my exams.  If the next year goes without hiccups, I might try to go for a 2-year MSc in Robotics and Cybernetics, which has been my dream since I was a teenager.   Either way I would end up with a great and sought after education in a field that is exciting and interesting, with good pay.  It has been hard, and requires total devotion, but it is absolutely achievable, even if you have to work part-time and have a chronic disease."

But I did graduate with plenty of 30 year olds,so it is never to late. As far as part time/night school, that might be tough for a few reasons. Getting a engineering degree takes a lot more credits than a regular degree. A lot of schools require you to apply to the dept after your lower division courses and they might kick you from the dept if you aren't taking a certain number of classes. Lastly, unlike a lot of other programs, the courses you take are pretty fixed with few electives and those courses might only be taught one term a year and only one section. I went to a pretty good sized state school and all this might be different for your school. So these are just questions you may want to ask. I think the best advice would be to meet with the schools engineering councilor or dept manager. Best of luck"

This includes things like Calculus (1,2, and 3), statics, dynamics, physics, etc. Also, if you're doing it part time, expect for it to take 6-8 years instead of 4; high level courses are a lot of work and there's simply no way to match the courseload of a full-time student."

I started school after 10 years in the military and graduated at 35.  I feel like being older gave me an advantage academically, but hindered me socially.  On the academic side, I always came prepared, I treated school like a job, and my assignments & emails were always submitted on time and in a very professional style.  I always addressed the professors professionally and dressed nicely.  My efforts landed me an automatic acceptance into the Master's program as a result of high GPA and I'm generally liked by most of the staff at my college.  Socially, however, I didn't really care to join any fraternities or engineering clubs.  I joined Tau Beta Pi because it gave me access to some quality career workshops and looks very good on a resumé.  But I really didn't care to join things like Concrete Canoe or Steel Bridge or even stick around after classes to gossip about professors.  At the end of class, I really want to just get home to my family and do my homework.   Do you think you could have earned it part time/night school in bits and chunks?   I really believe this would be quite difficult.  Many undergraduate courses are only offered during the day.  The professors that teach them generally reserve their evenings for graduate classes - classes that are typically taken by people already in the industry and who require evening classes.  Additionally, there are some long prerequisite chains in engineering.  For example, there is the Calc I -> Physics I -> Statics -> Dynamics -> Structural Analysis chain which I believe would be difficult to complete on a part time basis - simply because skipping one semester of these classes because it doesn't line up with your work schedule would mean pushing back every class after it in the chain.  Similarly, Calc I -> Calc II -> Calc III -> DiffEq could be a challenge.  You may be able to take the classes in the evening at a community college or online and transfer them into your local university, however.  Good luck with it all, /u/Kite23!"

Doing this involves high concentration acids, applying voltage across your parts, and should not be done at home unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Having said that ...  as long as you force the voltage to go through your acid rather than direct anode/cathode contact, you should be fine.

engineering,3b3eaw,bigfig,4,Fri Jun 26 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"This is so true, but that's because of cost and resource limitations.   My nuclear plant, we have over conservative calculations all over the place. I don't know the exact failure point of many systems, because rather than do a realistic analysis to figure it out, we add massive safety margins and use simplified, conservative methods which always produce ""safe"" results. The good news is if we bust one of these limits, we know there is a ton of safety built in. It's much cheaper and faster to do.   Some examples: electrical loading, we assume 102% load on everything, even stuff with variable loads which may never run at full, and we also assume heating and AC are on at the same time. You can never be wrong if your calculations error on the side of caution, but it does make it tighter for our load calcs.   Our main steam line flow limiters were calculated using a moody approximation model for steam line break flow. This was considered over conservative at the time. When Ge found an error in a calculation, they spent months formulating a realistic model, found out we have way more margin than we thought, and it was a non issue.   It only makes sense to come up with the answer that solves the problem, and not trying to go overboard on everything. We really do live in the approximate."

They added weight to the tip of the wings as band aid.   And as you can read in the comments from two aerospace engineers:  Commenter 1: ""Adding dead weight is the last thing you want to do against flutter. It's a desperate solution that has to be used when the plane is already designed and a re-design is not possible anymore (due to cost and time delays).""  Commenter 2 Reply: ""While you are right in your assessment about Boeing's ""Engineering Band-Aid"" using such fixes is quite common. [...]  Engineers are smart guys (99% of the time) and using fixes like adding weight to the wing tips on the 747 was a LOT cheaper than a major design change.  Such a fix doesn't take away from the wildly successful career of the Boeing 747.  Still, I respect your opinion and you are NOT wrong."""

Hardware wise, I would use something like a raspberry pi to serve the content. However, it will likely have problems dealing with any more than a dozen users at once. Could you give an idea of the expected patronage? If it might be too much for a raspberry pi, I would opt for something like an Intel Nuc  Either way, some device running Linux.  For the wireless component, you can use a USB dongle,  or pretty much any consumer router. There aren't many USB dongles that don't suck in my experience. Your choice in hardware depends on your expected range and how many users you expect there to be.  Once you've sussed out what you want with hardware, you just need to set up the content device as a http proxy. The particularities depend on your choice of hardware  What you really need to think about is cooling and weather proofing. Most components don't like being above 60C generally, so you need some form of ventilation. You also need to keep water  and such out of the devices. That's not my forte,  I'm a computer guy."

For the ""computer"" side of things I was directed to this article about building a Wifi Honeypot using Raspberry Pi, from an amateur viewpoint it looks like a promising start, what do you think?  I'm not sure if patronage and range would be a problem. The landmarks aren't swamped with tourists, often they are more or less accidentally discovered by trekking/hiking tourists on their way, however there sometimes are small tourist groups that drive to the more prominent landmarks (like the remains of an old lighthouse). I think we are dealing with 25-30 people max when they come by bus.  Weatherproofing might be a problem in terms of heat. It can get quite hot in the summer, especially at the sites that have no natural shadow. There might be an option to place the box underground, though. All sites have small ""maintenance holes"", it's where the batteries are stored to power the lights, maintenance workers' tools, etc. (and where the data box would get it's power from). The box would be tretty safe and cool down in the hatch.

I would probably go with something simple like nginx with PHP or Ruby on Rails.  If you want them to be able to get actual Internet access after they've bounced through your portal your server requires two NICs. Then just create a cookie whenever they try to access the Internet for the first time and redirect them to your portal and after that let them go wherever they want to. Or you could still just restrict them to your portal, but your server could communicate with other things like the weather services to get weather info if that's something you wish to show.  As far as I'm aware, all you need is WiFi router and a server with DHCP service so you can route everything to that machine."
