Nisekoi,3dotup,Bradythenarwhal,12,Sat Jul 18 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, my problem with Onodera is that outside of being a love interest for Raku she's got little to no character at all. We know she's got a little sister, that her mom makes her work in a sweet shop, and that while she's good at making things look nice, she's a horrible cook. That's all well and good, but she doesn't seem to have anything else going for her besides that and her crush on Raku.  All the other girls have other things going on in their lives.  Chitoge's going to have to move back to America after graduation and eventually is going to have to manage both Beehive and whatever kind of business her mother leaves behind to her. She'd be a busy woman, and while Raku might get to live his dream life as a productive member of society through the company, he'd easily get swamped by all the work and we'd wind up with similar problems to the ones Chitoge used to have with her mother.   Tsugumi has the lifestyle of an assassin; she goes into dangerous situations and has to deal with the consequences of it. Being in a relationship with her would be hard because she's always traveling and has a terrible job.  Marika has failing health, and she's always going to struggle with who she is as a person outside of simply being someone that she thinks Raku will like. If Raku did get in a relationship with her, there's a very high chance that it could all end at any moment, and there will always be the question of whether or not Marika is being straight with him or just putting up an act for his sake.  The problem with Onodera is that comparison to the other three girls in the series she is just. so. boring. She's got a cute face and a fluttering heart, but there's nothing of substance - nothing of value - beyond that.  If Onodera wants to win me over as a character, she's going to need to show me that she's capable of doing more than just liking Raku. As it stands, it's not that she hasn't gotten any development; it's that there's nothing in her character to be developed whenever her chapters come up.  What are her personal struggles that aren't just endearing flaws? What is she thinking about when Raku isn't on her mind? Who would she be if she didn't end up with Raku? Those are the questions I want answered."
Nisekoi,3dotup,JinHikari,9,Sat Jul 18 07:40:00 2015 UTC,Development does not mean much. She could become even shyer or become a murdering psycho and both would be a form of character development.  Her character could improve. But I believe it's a little too late. 180 chapters of only making cute faces is a little too much.
Nisekoi,3dotup,DonEncro,5,Sat Jul 18 06:41:35 2015 UTC,Kosaki should worry more about fixing her grades and deciding on her career.she ranked 88 in her first year and she probably even higher now lol aside from that she really doesn't put much effort into anything without the assistance from others.
Nisekoi,3dotup,CaneloAlvarez25,6,Sat Jul 18 06:55:26 2015 UTC,"I just don't like shy girls that don't do anything about it and have to constantly be push to action... and she has easily given up on Raku when she thought he was dating Chitoge for real and that Hana arc when Raku took Chitoge to the Hotel, Onodera was like oh that fine cause they are dating... she gives up all the time... and yes lack of development in general...   I used to not like Marika but on her last arc and liked her more as a character, aslo Yui I have respect for her now....  but Onodera in her arc, fir tree, she...... well....she did make that face... and nothing else really happened.. but I don't dislike Onodera its just that all the other girls are way better cause they do something.."
Nisekoi,3dotup,wardaniel9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:23:37 2015 UTC,i can agree with most of that. I'm really hoping somewhere in the future she'll start to get a little more pushy and stuff. I bet Komi has a lot of plans for Onodera. At least I hope so.

Very wrong.   no, but she really wasn't that upset at all. she just accepted that they would spend the night together even though she knows that they are not really dating..   Whenever Marika gets close to Raku Chitoge throw a fit and tries to separate them... Marika is always noticing when Raku gets close to other girl, Tsugumi thinks they are dating for real and still thinks about being his mistress and protecting Chitoge togther... Haru is trying really hard to give up on Raku because her sister(Onodera, I know they have the same last name, Kosaki) really likes him......   Onodera once she see one girl get close to Raku just accepts that she will never be with him... thats what bothers me the most about her... even if she is too shy to do anything she can still have a better resolve and think about things she can do to get closer to him, instead of relaying on Ruri-chan(which has been gone for like 100 chapters now)... and I know she has gotten close to confessing but so has Chitoge and Marika and now Yui who actually confess..."
Nisekoi,3dotup,-Nosebleed-,7,Sat Jul 18 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"I would actually like to see her do something useful for herself. I don't care how hard she tries when most of it is just her talking out of her ass, she has to be pushed hard to make a move, it's frustrating to witness. She acts like a retarded grade schooler, blushing over freaking hand holding like she's already married, even her own sister makes jabs at it. Even Yui who's only been around for the past 70 chapters has made 100 times the progress for goodness sake. Characters that don't fight for their love by themselves after 178 chapters of being pushed around to do something get no respect from me. Do i actually HATE Kosaki? Not really, but god damn are most of the events revolving around her boring, I have more fun watching paint dry."
Nisekoi,3dotup,nazario1996,3,Sat Jul 18 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"My problem with Onodera is I don't think she suits Raku at all. She's from a totally different world to Raku and the other girls. She's not good academically, where the other girls all perform amazing as well as Raku. They all have chances to go to great universities and have great jobs apart from Onodera.   We can clearly see Raku excels at being a person from high up in society as how he was managing to do work for Hana's international company while being a teenager. He's also a great chef who has helped out Onodera's mom's shop countless times and could probably easily be a chef of a major world renown 5 star restaurant where as Onodera can't even cook, something she's spent her whole life doing.  Chitoge is a daughter of a mafia boss and one of the most successful business women in the world, which she could easily reach those herself. Marika has put her entire life in order to reach the highest so she can always be with Raku which is crazy but amazing determination and skills she's got from that aswell as being a police chief daughter, she can go far. Tsugumi is a world class assassin as a teenager, she could be the head of MI5 or someshit by the time she leaves school. Yui is already a teacher despite or young age but could have easily been higher up in some other career if she didn't come back to chase Raku.   Onodera can't come close to the other girls apart from in looks (but personally her looks are still a bit bland when compared to a feisty red head, a half american half japanese blonde goddess, a sexy deadly assassin and a chinese mafia beauty) which gets boring fast. And despite what Raku says about wanting a 'normal' life I still don't think he truly wants that, the same in how he says he like Onodera but pictures Chitoge. He's also most likely just saying he wants a normal life to get back at his dad because he's always been seen as a scary yakuza kid by the other kids when he was younger. So he just has a bitter feeling for it atm, but if he actually left the yakuza he'd regret it in an instant, and I don't think a girl like Onodera would be any good for Raku in his life after school."
Nisekoi,3dotup,therandomone92,3,Sat Jul 18 13:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's a matter of Kosaki just being a common plain girl, a cute one, but without anything special as a character to make her interesting for the readers, I think that's what most people mean, calling it ""lack of development"" would be putting it in the wrong words...  There is also a matter of compatibility in a real relationship, to which Chitoge has a lot on her favor, but that's only because we've been able to see how would a relationship between Raku and Chitoge would fare, thanks to the fake relationship... We still don't know how would a real relationship between Raku and Kosaki go, a lot of people just go on and on about something like ""blushing awkwardness"" but I feel like that'd just be a phase, and after they acknowledge each other feelings, things would take on a different note, we just don't know how it would go, which is why by comparison with Chitoge, most people side with Chitoge...  I do like Kosaki as a girl, as a character though, reading her is quite underwhelming to be fair, and that's what I think most people think when they say ""lack of development"" though I'm very interested to know what happened 10 years ago, it would probably put Kosaki on different light, since I think there is more to Kosaki than what we already know, just consider it, everyone else had a reason to be there (the secret meeting spot for Raku's and Chitoge's fathers) 10 years ago, but what was Kosaki doing there? Just who she really is, or was 10 years ago?  I hope Komi gives her character at least some flavor, people don't want to see Kosaki get together with Raku, because they feel like it would be a plain and boring ending, and a waste considering how it has all been set up for Raku to end up with Chitoge in a powerful and interesting way, but I feel like Komi could pull it off in a satisfying way for the readers with all of the stuff already established that need to be resolved (Lock, keys, book, Chitoge and Kosaki's friendship, and so on), it's just a matter of what the author decides to do, but I agree it will most likely be Chitoge in the end, which allows for something to happen between Kosaki and Raku before that... perhaps in a way to satisfy the readers that want some Raku x Kosaki perhaps..."
Nisekoi,3dotup,Opal158,5,Sat Jul 18 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"Many people don't like shy characters with or without character development. However, Kosaki should get more selfish and confident in my opinion because she's too kind for her own good. :-)"
Nisekoi,3dotup,therandomone92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:17 2015 UTC,"She needs to... Or else she'll lose by default (which is sadly pretty consistent with her character until now)  I'd love to see Kosaki owning up to her words and fighting for Raku instead of giving up, even if that means going up against Chitoge, now that would be interesting, after all we haven't seen Kosaki on the offensive or taking initiative until know, her doing so would be a great change of pace, and a huge step in character development and growth... She could use a little Marika in her life, she often says how she admires the way she handles her feelings, how about trying to be a bit more like her..."
Nisekoi,3dotup,tx8xsiempre,2,Sat Jul 18 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"I like her, and I do hope she gets more development.

Nisekoi,3dotup,kishien,2,Mon Jul 20 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"I think the better way to say is that she may have developed but the author doesn't to highlight/make use of her development. The thing is if those confessions pushed through, then the drama happening right now wouldn't be happening since Raku only had Kosaki on his mind back then."
Nisekoi,3dotup,elx0r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:14:01 2015 UTC,NOt at all! She's a worthless character the way i see it.Useless i would say. It's thanks to Ruri that she took 2-3 steps.If it was for her she would just stay quiet and dumb for the rest of the days! Unlike Chitoge and Marika who know what they want and give their best(or at least they try) she just CAN'T do anything at all!!!

NO she has not tried hard to win raku at all. you are def wrong in that regard. Ruri has tried and tried again to push her and she still hasn't budged.

So what has Chitoge done to earn his respect? i dont really recall her pushing forward that much. i mean she wussy's out every time she thinks about it. i remember her, what asking if they would work out as a couple (hypothetically) at the beach on the rock but it really didnt result to much. Im not trying to lash Chitoge fans shes cool and all but what makes her SO special? Everyone needs to remember as well onodera has no clue chitoge like raku, so her not freaking out about the hotel thing i would say is normal.. i mean shes assuming they arent really interested in each other. I respect everyones opinions, but i too wanna know why chitoge is so interesting?  ~#TeamOnodera"
Nisekoi,3dotup,IdealsNReality,4,Sun Jul 19 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"From what i can remember, Onodera tried to confess twice: once when Ruri pushed her (and she got interrupted by a baseball), and another during the fir tree incident. She also asked Raku if she could kiss him. But, you see, the problem is that she had so much advantage from the beginning (being his childhood friend, his crush, loving him since middle school) and yet she let all those niches get away and finally lose to the current girls. I don't think she actually tried much, only the times i mentioned were the ones she actually did. And let's look at Chitoge: she also tried to confess (got interrupted by phone-sama), she went out of her way and tried to get Raku's attention (when she continuously put on make-up and change her ribbon to make him notice), she put away her likings and tried to cater to Raku's tastes (during their recent date), and she always got annoyed and angry everytime another girl approached Raku (Marika mostly) and she did say that she was ok being his (fake) girlfriend. As you see, the two are currently on equal footing, and yet Onodera had so much going for her at the beginning (having Ruri's support, having Raku already likes her, being near Raku the most, etc) but eventually lost all of it. This is why people feels that she lacks ""development"". Now, i do agree that Chitoge has her fake relationship going for her, but Onodera has even more things supporting her, and even after Haru joined her team, she still couldn't get anywhere. If we blame Raku for being dense, then even when he's not, the current situation will still be that he likes them both, and both of them love him back. I won't use the Chitoge's mom arc as an example, since nobody could have done anything in that case. At the end of the day, Onodera (currently) actually has tried LESS than Chitoge, but even if we ignore that, results matter, and current Chitoge continued to rocket forward while Onodera just keep leisurely walking at snail's pace in order to get Raku."
Nisekoi,3dotup,J4Seriously,0,Sun Jul 19 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"I think both potential winners are as bland as can be. In fact the whole cast can be described as candy that's just sugary.  Sure its fun to chew, but it has no depth.   I think the lack of real drama accounts for this, they don't go through deep troubles and even real drama boils down to easy fixes and happy endings (the Hana x Chitoge chapters.) My hope for the next chapters and even leading into the conclusion is things that challenge characters, their personalities and their shortcomings.  So, yes, I would like her better but it hardly matters at this point, just pick your favorite and roll with it."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,IdealsNReality,9,Sat Jul 18 11:14:53 2015 UTC,"All those things you typed were true, but I don't think it shows that Raku's a hypocrite.  In fact, think Raku's been pretty consistent.   At the start, he's shown to be someone who's very focused on attention to detail... His personalized cooking for every individual in his mob, the way he feeds the animals at school using a scientific scale... He notices details, and makes them his thing.  He also appreciates people who notices details like he does.  He likes his mob members for how much they notice his cooking... He likes Onodera because how much she notices little things (like the band-aid she gave him in the beginning because she noticed he was hurt).  At the start though, Chitoge's the very opposite of a detail-oriented, considerate person, and that's why she gets under his skin, and he has little patience for inconsiderate people.  She knees him and her 'verbal apology' was without turning around or stopping at all to check on him immediately after clocking him out-cold.  Raku insults her as a monkey in class only after Chitoge's attitude was ""You got up, you're fine, it wasn't that serious an injury, stop being a baby"", instead of showing him empathy or remorse.   When he's worried about the locket, Chitoge's stance is basically what you said... ""If it was so important, you should know where it is. Deal with it like a man"" instead of like Onodera, actually stopping to talk to him and share concern/offer help.  (For Chitoge, details don't really matter, it's the thought and feeling behind everything that counts.  ""I felt sorry, so that should be enough, don't have to make a big scene of formally apologizing"", etc.)    So far in the manga, they've both softened up to accept each other, but they're still mostly the same... Raku's still a detail freak... He notices the tiniest things about Chitoge that only an autistic kid would notice (while still being dense enough to not put all those details together to figure out her feelings towards him).  And Chitoge still brute-forces her way through situations instead of using compassion when she can (Getting the cat to love Raku during their recent date, by threatening it with a death-stare).  The thing you have to notice though, is that they're slowly brushing off on each other... and becoming better people for it... Chitoge showing some signs of Raku-ish compassion has made her a nicer person...  That recent date where they only did things she noticed Raku liked... Old Chitoge would have never been able to do that.    Raku's problem right now with the girls is his attention to detail... He puts so much thought into every little thing going on, that it's crippled his action with the girls... He can't say something to girl a, because what would girl b and girl c and true-locket girl think? ...  Right now, for the story to progress, Raku's handling of love needs to be a little more like Chitoge when not dealing with love, and just hammer through things with confidence based on his gut feeling and not second-guess, overthink and look-back every two seconds because 'details'.  His response to Yui was a step in the right direction, because he made a decision, ""No Yui, you're not the one"" without fully weighing all the pros and cons of that decision like he normally does.... (Though he did spend that night later on in bed going back to old-Raku mode worrying and rethinking.)  TLDR:  Raku's a more details matter ""brainy"" person... Chitoge's more of a follow gut feeling ""heart"" person... They were opposites at the start, but as they share more and more traits, they've become better people."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,whut-whut,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, Chitoge did turn back and check on Raku. Now had he been unconscious and lying on the ground it would have been common sense to help, but Raku was fine, his eyes were open, his brain was functioning, not to mention that Chitoge was in a hurry, so it should be excusible for her (despite being a little rude). Fast forward to when she was inside the classroom, Raku started the fight first by calling her a ""berserk woman"" and kept pestering her about it, despite Chitoge trying to calm the situation down (her first 3 lines after Raku's statement). In the end, the whole thing actually was Raku's fault for insulting her. Now i am not saying that she wasn't at fault for him losing his locket, but she did help him look for him for a whole WEEK. I don't know about you, but forcing a girl to stay behind after school looking for something you lost for that long is extremely unmanly. And to be precise, when Chitoge complained about it, Raku did act like it was only her fault, not his. If it were me, my anger would have calmed down a long time ago, and i would have forgiven her and look for the pendant myself , not act like a brat when Chitoge complained rightfully then shouted at her for telling the truth. Raku was that kind of person, when someone says something he didn't like despite being the truth, he will immediately get angry and insult them. You see, Raku has to hear the words ""sorry"" for him to forgive someone, as shown when even though Chitoge helped him for a week and he still felt salty about it.  And on your second note, i actually think that it's exactly why Raku is so shy and dense. He idolizes Onodera so much that he expects every girl in the world to be like her, evidenced by when he talked to Kosaki after being kneed by Chitoge. That's arrogant and narrow-minded, and when he was confronted by someone different like you said (Chitoge), he gets annoyed for no reason and start saying bad things at them. On the other hand, i disagree that Chitoge was inconsiderate from start, an inconsiderate person would have walked away without giving a thought at Raku or even bother looking for his pendant, and an inconsiderate person would never tell Kosaki that her relationship is fake, knowing it could end in a full out war between 2 gangs.  I do agree with your second-last and last part. They did grow closer, but it was mostly Chitoge trying to change herself. Raku hasn't changed much at all, still the same over-thinking boy from the start that never actually managed to figured out anything despite thinking so much. Marie had told him her love a zillion of times already and only recently did he understand it. Shuu had been dropping hints here and there hundreds of times and yet he only just considers that option now. Raku needs to get his thoughts right, not everyone is Onodera, and they shouldn't be, and he should open his mind more to see what's in front of him. What he lacks is guts, and confidence. I expect within the next 3 chapters or so he would finally be able to resolve his feelings and come to terms with the fact that he also likes Chitoge, not as a ""best friend"", but as a girl."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,msakit234,-7,Sat Jul 18 14:24:18 2015 UTC,Holy shiy get a life u 2 assholes this is a manga isny supposed to be realistic stop making wall of txt holy shit
Nisekoi,3dq78x,elfadlym,5,Sat Jul 18 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"I think he really IS a gentleman. Kosaki, Ruri, and Shuu have known Raku from middle school (Shuu being a childhood friend). Kosaki admits he's nice no matter what and says he's that kind of person (forgot chapter). Ruri knows he's nice because he accompanied her to her grandfathers mansion as her boyfriend but understands how dense he is. What I'm trying to say is that Raku started acting salty and whimpy like a beansprout because of all that's happened to him. In Marika's case, it's hard for him to act nice to someone who is SO clingy yet he makes the effort to listen to her (from the chapter where she kidnaps him to her family island) or put effort to help her (when her old friend comes to see her fiancé and Raku plays along). In Taugumi's case, she tried to get rid of him because of Four-eyes' orders. Yet he 'treats her as a girl' and goes through A LOT with her (experiments/BeeeHive products/mission). In Yui's case, Raku has always been there for her as a brother with brotherly love. Knowing her but to dense to understand her... But she's family to him. With Kosaki, he's always been a kind person. When she talks about him in middle school with her, she mentions how he's not very athletic or popular but how she fell for him due to his kindness and concern for others. To everyone he seems like a really nice guy which is why you viewed him to be hiding behind a gentleman's mask. Similar to Haru's impression of him, Raku is my a gentleman but a womanizer. Yet after some time she witnesses his kindness first hand. I think this can be applied to Chitoge's case. Yes it was unnecessary to be salty towards someone who knees you BUT apologizes, and then to figure out that you would have to be in a fake relationship with said person. It would be very hard to be nice with someone in this scenario. Yes Chitoge's  side has feelings too but this is just the beginning. Raku has more problems than she does (practically all of Nisekoi). I feel that Chitoge is the only one that has actually tested Raku's gentleman's personality. Raku acts all salty and rude around her yet is still a gentleman. During his amnesia arc, it mentions how he never called Chitoge ""pretty"" because he must have been embarrassed too. That arc I feel was really important because it makes you question whether Raku has a ""gentleman's mask"" on or... If maybe he now has a different mask when/because of Chitoge."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,elfadlym,2,Sat Jul 18 14:23:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, i see your point, but it's exactly these kinds of things that made me wonder: does Raku only act nice towards people who meets his expectations. As you said, Ruri, Kosaki, Shuu are Raku's childhood friends, so it's very normal for him to act nice towards them. Now i'm not saying Raku is rude to others, but the point is that he expects too much, he wants every girl to be like Onodera, you can clearly see it every time he tries to compare Chitoge with her. And when someone doesn't meet his criterias, he immediately fails to treat them approriately. He never once took Marika's love seriously, he never saw Chitoge as a girl and only focused on her bad side until chapter 30 or so, and his obsession over Onodera means that he can never consider himself a love candidate, too shy to confess, and too humble to be loved. Haru is a special case, i think, since she was introduced so late in the manga, Raku has kinda got used to dealing with troublesome things that it seemed normal, but even then Raku did shout at Haru asking her to return his pendant, without hearing any reason from the other party. What i'm trying to say is that Raku can easily act like a nice guy to people he knows well or people he rarely socializes with, but when someone different from his ""ideals"" try to get close to him, he immediately loses his calm temper and ""nice guy"" attitude, which is mainly the reason why he couldn't bring himself to take Marika seriously or figure out Yui's feelings. It's also the reason why he constantly denied Chitoge's lovable side and never consider himself as a romantic interest."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,ss4chris,3,Sat Jul 18 14:49:34 2015 UTC,gaaahhhh! Harems and Dense protagonists are so complicated! But i get what you're saying!  lol this is new for me... Talking about Raku rather than the girls lol
Nisekoi,3dq78x,ss4chris,4,Sat Jul 18 15:55:07 2015 UTC,i feel like you are reading too much into it lack emotions and comprehension. Raku is anything but a coward or a hypocrite.
Nisekoi,3dq78x,ss4chris,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:49:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right, it's just that i get extremely annoyed at how Raku treated Chitoge (a girl) in the beginning. He acted like it was never his fault and anyone who disagreed was bad, no matter how much they apologized."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,therandomone92,2,Sat Jul 18 15:07:54 2015 UTC,she kicked him in the face...  horrible first impression. rofl. wut? >.< and thats sexist feminist oh because shes a girl treat her different compared to other sexes? wut?   It was her fault! you sure you read this 4 times now?
Nisekoi,3dq78x,therandomone92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"Being angry was fine, but forcing your anger on someone the entire week is not. And let me get this straight, calling someone a gorilla in front of others is not sexist? And even if the first impression was bad, it wasn't intentional, she apologized, yet he didn't let go. Had he calmed down right from the start and gently had a civil conversation instead of calling her a ""berserk woman"" things wouldn't have gone bad. It was his fault. From your point of view Raku's actions maybe justifiable, but that's not how a gentleman should act, calling a girl a bitch, a gorilla, a brute every minute or so. And if it was her fault, Raku took a part of it. He had the time to walk leisurely to school and daydream about Onodera but didn't have the time to check whether if anything has fallen off? And then when Chitoge complained, did anything she said sound wrong to you. She was right, a normal person wouldn't hang on to such a person from 10 years ago, especially when he was only 5 then. Basically forcing her to stay after school to look for your pendant, is that how a man act? And when you can't handle the truth, instead of reasoning, you let your anger take over, is that good?"
Nisekoi,3dq78x,ss4chris,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:27:25 2015 UTC,shes  pretty agressive even for  a human being. so that anology is fine. So ya it really isnt his fault. she kicked him and half ass an apology.  so youre def wrong in that regard.  i think you have a misconception of how a gentleman is supposed to be. hes pretty much a gentleman to everyone but treats one person differently and all of a sudden is not a gentleman? bad logic is bad.  If we wanna go there  she wasnt verylady like doing cartwheels over a wall kicking a  stranger and then kicking his ass later cuz he called her a name if we're going by your standards/ logic/ level.  I mean its what got the  plot/ story going. works for me. Getting off to a great start. rofl.
Nisekoi,3dq78x,ss4chris,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"I am not saying that it was not her fault, think of it this way, why being angry and insult someone when you can have a normal conversation and will eventually receive your apology. Both of them were at fault, Chitoge for kneeing (not kicking) him and apologized half-heartedly and Raku for not holding a civil conversation at first. And where did you think she was aggressive? Before Chitoge was introduced to her class, Raku has never met her once, not to mention the aura she gave off at the beginning was extremely friendly, but he just had to be angry and called Chitoge a ""berserk woman"" before she could say anything. It's fine to treat everyone differently, but there are standards for it, and hating someone despite seeing her for only the second time is not.  And why are we even dragging how Chitoge act into this? I'm talking about when Raku first saw her, she wasn't doing anything brute to him, yet he had to keep pushing her when they could just sit down and talk normally. So, going by your logic, when in any chapter does she actually go around looking for trouble from Raku? Every time she responded was because Raku provoked her or did something that people could easily misunderstand. And even if she did, all she said was ""i don't want to be near you"", see? That kind of statement is nowhere near the level of ""this bitch"" that  Raku usually had at the beginning.  And i am not talking about the Raku now, he did change (albeit not much), he could hold his anger more easily, he is more gentle than before, and he chooses his words well. The one i am trying discuss is his way of acting at the beginning of Nisekoi, not now."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,ss4chris,2,Sat Jul 18 15:50:49 2015 UTC,"Well Raku called her a ""berserk woman"" because she kneed him, and Chitoge only apologized half-heartedly, like it didn't merit a proper reply, she then called him a ""pansy"", which triggered the known until now ""gorilla woman""...  Now if you expected Raku to treat her differently just because she's a cute girl, or be more lenient to her kneeding him just because she could just go ""Teehee I'm sorry!"" (which she didn't), that doesn't fit with Raku's character, not defending him on this point, it's just how Raku is...  Just consider this, has Raku ever been wronged in the series like he was at the start? I mean in Japan proper retribution is a pretty deep concept, it was Chitoge's fault that he lost his pendant, expecting her to take responsibility for it isn't that out of nowhere, it's just that you're seeing it as a guy demanding something from a girl, whereas Raku was just treating her as a person, regardless of gender... Apologizing in Japan, is also associated with a proper retribution, we westerns could just say ""I'm sorry"" and that'd be it, even then you can tell when someone doesn't actually mean it, or doesn't seem to care...  Chitoge on the other hand kept insulting Raku's ""manliness"" calling him a ""pansy"" and a ""puny"" and ""pathetic"" man... Raku also tried to make amends and helped her with Japanese, because he noticed she was struggling, yet Chitoge just shoved away his good intentions, even then, after she keeps helping him find the pendant, he does acknowledge that as a good thing from her part...  Now if you want to go to the breaking point were Raku actually went overboard, it was because Chitoge once again questioned his manhood, calling him a ""pansy"" and just went on and on (probably venting out her frustrations of having to be dragged around and associated with Raku), about him caring about the pendant and the girl who gave it to him made him a ""lame idiot"", by that point she was already yelling, not as loud as Raku did when he replied though... and even then he just told her to go away and not help him then, he didn't yell out some random slur or insult back at her... and even so Raku acknowledged that doing so wasn't ""acting like a man"", and that she had actually helped him all along until that moment, yelling at her wasn't ok, it was probably Raku's own frustrations and doubts around the promise as well in contrast to how important it was to him...  Anyways, Chitoge keeps searching for the lock regardless, finds it, and gives it back to Raku, Raku then considers thanking her if they get the chance to meet again (they already found the lock, there was no need for them to see eachother, and following from what Chitoge had said before, to Raku the best would be to stay away from her just like she asked), and just right after that, they are forced to date... and the insults kept on piling up, on Chitoge's side, questioning Raku's manhood calling him a beansprout and a weakling (which is partly true) and on Raku's side, questioning Chitoge's femininity, calling her a gorilla (which is partly true, she often doesn't behave ""girly"", not saying it's a bad thing, that's her personality, and along the series Raku has agreed that it's the real side of her, and the one he prefers), both kind of insults really get on eachother nerves, because probably each of them can see them being partially true, if someone notices something ""bad"" about you that you already know about, and keeps pointing it out, it would probably get on your nerves...  Raku did thank Chitoge after the whole fake dating first showdown, and he did tell her the story behind the lock even though he thought she'd laugh at his face, which she didn't, and Raku acknowledges her ""cute side""...  Anyways even if they get closer and become friends, from the very start each of them keep going on, on how having to date eachother is so bad, again by attacking eachother's manhood (Raku) and femininity (Chitoge)... It's because of how strongly against the fake relationship the two of them were, that many misunderstandings came about later on, like what Raku said to Chitoge at the beach, which triggered the whole drama during the Romeo and Juliet arc..."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,cptcruiser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying that the apology would be ignored, i was stating that there could be another way for Raku to ask for an apology (read my last comment for this) without starting his conversation with something that could potentially hurt or anger the other side. For a calm guy like Raku, don't you feel it's a little bit ooc when he holds his grudge for so long (note: this is before he realized he lost his pendant).  Again, i wasn't saying that he was completely at fault in such situations, nobody is. What i'm saying is that he could have approached the event in a different way. For example: he could have simply tried to reason instead of shouted ""Don't fuck with me!"". And we also have to approach this not only from an emotional point, but a logical point as well. Chitoge did take reponsibility, she helped him look for it for a week. Normally when something can't be found in more than 3 days you'd better give up, the fact that she was patient enough to help him that far already proved her apologies. What you're saying basically means that she should kill all the criminals since all they did could never be repented equally. And besides, apart from her insults (which was still caused by their initial conflict, which was amplified by the way Raku approached a conversation inapproriately). What she said wasn't entirely wrong, each person sees the value of something differently, not to mention the frustration of having to comply with repaying him.  What i'm saying is, we shouldn't view these events as entirely separated chains. Instead, try to think of a different scenerio from root to top. Had Raku had a normal conversion and received a normal apology from Chitoge, then she wouldn't come to hate him so much and would be more devoted to helping him. Whether they find the pendant or not does play a factor, because patience matters. But in the end, the entire conflict at the beginning was caused both by Chitoge apologizing half-heartedly and the wrong way Raku demanded an apology."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,nickoswar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that last sentence, though just one thing, I don't think Raku forced her to look for it with her for that much time, the way he puts it (while in thought) sounds more like each time he went to search for it, Chitoge tagged along as a way to repay Raku for causing the loss of it on the first place... I don't think Raku demanded her to look for it with him for a whole seven days, which is why when she lashed out at Raku, he just yelled for her to leave and not help him then, he realized that was wrong because Chitoge had helped him until then, on her own accord most likely, and even then, she kept looking for it without him...  I mean Raku was on the wrong by calling her a ""berserk woman"" in the classroom, but I wouldn't be surprised if what Chitoge was about to say was ""Oh you're that weakling I kneed on my way here, were you okay?"". I'm not saying it's okay to hold a grudge on someone like Raku did, but it's just part of Raku's character, he really is pissed by people who avoid their responsibilities, you can notice this for example, by the way he lashed out at Hana (Chitoge's mother) when she seemed like she didn't care about Chitoge, even if Hana was an extremely intimidating (yet beautiful) business woman, he faced her head-on, and called her out on her being irresponsible on Chitoge as her mother...  For that matter Raku is a self-righteous and imposing guy, and this could easily be considered negative, after all many have pointed out that he seems to stick his nose on other people's business and judge out of his own set of values, most of the time with good results, but that doesn't make it a good thing nevertheless..."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,cptcruiser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points, but i do think that Raku forced Chitoge to look for his pendant, we can see that if he had been so forgiving, when Chitoge asked whether or not she could pass, he basically talked until she agreed to help. Another point, the part where Raku said ""Don't fuck with me"" was actually when Chitoge asked to stop looking for it for the first time, not when he lost his calm and shouted at her. As you can see, the moment she proposed giving up, he didn't give her a choice but continue."
Nisekoi,3dq78x,Paradoxs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:00:47 2015 UTC,but how else are you supposed to grab an audience with a  normal convo and apology? unless you wanna changed the genre from comedy to slice of life i think everything you're critiquing is fine.  agressive as in cartwheeling the way to school with bread in mouth into a  stranger isnt agressive to you? im surprised she didnt go in alimo rofl.  i dont think you know what a tsundere is. clearly chitoge instigates things lol.
Nisekoi,3dq78x,Defguru,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"The thing you just described is not being agressive.  aggressive : ready and willing to fight, argue, etc. : feeling or showing aggression : using forceful methods to succeed or to do something (source: merriam-webster)  She simply was late for class and had no choice but to use her naturally strong power to jump over the wall, it's not being aggressive, it's improvising.  Why not? There could be another way the conversation could have unfolded. For example: Raku-Chitoge: You! (Starting point) Raku: You were the one back one back then... Chitoge: And you're that guy... After a moment of silence, Chitoge closed her hands and apologizes. Chitoge: I'm sorry for before, it was my fault, i was in a hurry...  And if you're using the fact that it was to attract audience then both Raku and Chitoge were acting out of character. Reasoning like that is using arguments based on something that doesn't happen in Nisekoi itself. I acknowledge the neccessity of such drama, but the fact still stands that the two of them didn't act like how they should normally do.   See? Calling someone ""berserk"" is not a really good way to start a conversation, it could have been much more polite, not arguing in front of everyone in class.  Being slice-of-life or not just doesn't cut it. Raku was acting out of character for someone who's supposed to be a calm and caring type. And like before, being tsundere or not doesn't matter, this is at the beginning of the manga where no character interaction has been established, both of them got on each other's nerves, how do you think they can get closer when Raku keeps calling her a bitch?  And i should restate this, i already took back the part where Raku was a hypocrite (maybe coward), but i still feel like the way he acted was inapproriate and out of character."

Nisekoi,3dnfcn,RobinThunder,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:15:16 2015 UTC,"Damn bro, that sounds awesome. Good for you!"
Nisekoi,3dnfcn,wardaniel9,2,Sat Jul 18 11:37:39 2015 UTC,"what is that one in the middle call, and there's no translation of that right... (onodera with cat ears..)"
Nisekoi,3dnfcn,wardaniel9,2,Fri Jul 17 20:21:57 2015 UTC,(Nisekoi : Inside Stories Volume 1) pretty sure there's english translation somewhere because it's the first volume (the 2nd volume is with the nisekoi magical patissier kosaki-chan cover) . Have not read yet but THERES RURI AND SHUU PAIRING.
Nisekoi,3dnfcn,wardaniel9,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"It's also known as nisekoi urabana, and I search the entire Internet and no translation found.. and is it in Manga form or LN form... and you could read Japanese, translated please... or at least post the pictures of each page, please...."
Nisekoi,3dnfcn,ss4chris,2,Sat Jul 18 02:54:06 2015 UTC,Here you go. Took me quite awhile to scan because this is the first time that I'm scanning a book. Nisekoi Urabana 1 Scans: http://imgur.com/a/g7Ky7
Nisekoi,3dnfcn,ss4chris,2,Sat Jul 18 04:30:58 2015 UTC,Cool thanks a ton....
Nisekoi,3dnfcn,msakit234,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:49:18 2015 UTC,lol. and yet we can read it for free..  nice.
Nisekoi,3dmpqh,RosePichu,3,Fri Jul 17 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"Episode 1 is Magical Patissier bonus comics from volumes 18-21(not all released yet)   Episode 2 is the Newlywed bonus comics that came with each OVA, including one for Chitoge that is in Vol. 21"
Nisekoi,3dmpqh,dakoslug,2,Fri Jul 17 15:07:22 2015 UTC,Wait how many new episodes are there in total?
Nisekoi,3dmpqh,nazario1996,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:40 2015 UTC,So it there a chapter for the newly wed ova? And is it translated to english by any chance?
Nisekoi,3dmpqh,RobinThunder,3,Fri Jul 17 17:52:07 2015 UTC,Do you think the OVA's will be released online?
Nisekoi,3dmpqh,dakoslug,3,Fri Jul 17 17:04:37 2015 UTC,Of course.
Nisekoi,3dmpqh,RobinThunder,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:13 2015 UTC,Well then thats good news!
Nisekoi,3dmpqh,LastResort4532,2,Fri Jul 17 17:43:48 2015 UTC,"Do you guys remember a Newleywed bonus with Marika? I feel like I've seen this before, but it was never translated."
Nisekoi,3dmyxp,Thehoennhippo,5,Fri Jul 17 16:10:43 2015 UTC,When the 3rd year starts  Adding more characters   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Nisekoi,3dmyxp,-Nosebleed-,3,Fri Jul 17 16:26:46 2015 UTC,"No, we might see new characters but not permanent ones that are gonna add to the harem.. and there really no new character that can be added.. there was no one else there ten years ago, no siblings mention... but we might see a male character(Yui future husband) or either Raku's or Marika's mom or Onodera's dad"
Nisekoi,3dmyxp,wardaniel9,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:26 2015 UTC,I guess that makes sense.
Nisekoi,3dmyxp,whut-whut,3,Fri Jul 17 17:41:04 2015 UTC,"Since Raku seems to be on a fast track to make a decision on the girls, he could always add guys to the mix and muddle everything up... Increase the misunderstanding/jealousy/love polygon again while giving the ""losing girls"" an alternative for a happy relationship when the dust clears (again).  It'd change the entire feel of the manga, though."
Nisekoi,3dmyxp,luacs1998,0,Fri Jul 17 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"It is possible, but it seems Komi's trying to get Nisekoi out of his life ASAP, so I'm not sure he'd add new characters which may complicate things."
Nisekoi,3dmyxp,nazario1996,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to why you think he wants out of Nisekoi ASAP? I understand the manga is closing up certain points such as Yui being rejected, but with them only just entering the third year of school I think there's still potential for at least another 1.5 years of chapters. Plus with how well it's selling and popularity on the rise I don't see him wanting it to end soon."
Nisekoi,3dnood,ClassicReborn,5,Fri Jul 17 19:22:20 2015 UTC,"You can check out this list.  The adaptation is pretty much spot on, but they skipped a bunch of chapters for the 2nd season and some chapters were condensed (those episodes that adapted 3 chapters). The 2nd season finished at chapter 106.  I would suggest that you read from the very beginning, since there are also some minor chapters skipped from the first season."
Nisekoi,3dnood,jcdeoferio,2,Fri Jul 17 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"Reading from the beginning is probably the most 'complete' way, reading from chapter 50 is probably the most efficient way to cover the plot that got skipped but not repeat what S1 already covered."
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,kishien,5,Fri Jul 17 09:17:54 2015 UTC,"I am hoping that this is a turning point. Raku seems to have had an epiphany about his feelings for Chitoge. Yui's rejection marks the beginning of the dissolution of the harem, which in most harem stories, mean we are going to start heading for a conclusion.  For example, in the Monogatari series, the dissolution starts and persists all throughout Second Season spoilers ""Rejection of Hanekawa, loss of Hachikuji, and the ascension and then descension of Nadeko.  After SS we got Hanamonogatai (a stand alone story set months after the end of the main storyline, closes Kanbaru's story), and Tsukimonogatari, the first chapter in the declared final season.   While I don't expect Nisekoi to get quite as crazy as Monogatari, I still think that harem stories still follow that formula if they intend to end with one winner."
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,nokayy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree. I wonder how Komi is going to show what happens to the others after though? I hope it's not like Zero no Tsukaima or Love Hina where everyone is just buried by the main relationship without a proper closure. Well, at least Yui's rejection leads it away from it."
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,ss4chris,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:17 2015 UTC,idk how you can compare monogatari with nisekoi. there is no harm between the two. More like a love triangle. and its clear senjougahara is the clear fav in kyomi's eyes.
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,nitvit610,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:54:27 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it's gonna open his eyes to how the others feel about him.
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,elfadlym,5,Fri Jul 17 12:19:17 2015 UTC,Yes yes... A less dense beansprout!
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,the6crimson6fucker6,4,Fri Jul 17 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"Well amongst the others remaining, Raku at least knows about how Marika feels about him. I think it's more of a matter of not just knowing but doing something about his own feelings first."
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,ss4chris,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"well, at least with Marika he knows how she feels."
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,msakit234,2,Fri Jul 17 17:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, but he's going to have more struggles in figuring out his feelings and what to do with her since he knows that Marika is very sick and rejecting her might worsen her condition."
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,msakit234,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:32:19 2015 UTC,he has kind heart who just doesnt know how to say no/ hurt someone unintenionally. but he got his point across to yui. whos next.
Nisekoi,3dlvb4,J4Seriously,-6,Sat Jul 18 14:53:06 2015 UTC,Dont worry he gonna fuck chitoge tight asian pussy soon
