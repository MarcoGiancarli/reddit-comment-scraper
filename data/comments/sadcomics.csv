sadcomics,3d9tdi,Tenure,6,Tue Jul 14 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"Also, the comic then uses the common trope of a train going into a tunnel, to imply sexual activity taking place. Except it subverts this after showing it after showing the act anyway.  Which is why Nicholas Gurewitch is a fucking genius."
sadcomics,3d9tdi,JacZones,3,Wed Jul 15 09:02:21 2015 UTC,To me it was implied she was leaving him for a lover she was having an affair with. It's unlikely she was just blowing some stranger she just met.

sadcomics,3cpi43,ifyourheadexplodes,-1,Thu Jul 9 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"I really don't know any at all. I've never drawn cartoon characters in my life. Maybe if the eyes didn't look so.... not like normal eyes? I mean I've taken photography classes and I've even painted, but I've never done anything AT ALL like making a cartoon. I mean I get the point of the comic was to make me sad, and it DID, I really enjoyed that aspect actually. It was a really solid message about how difficult it is as a kid that develops hobbies beyond gender norms. I was the same way, I lived in the south, had longer hair, and played tennis. I got called faggot for years by jocks, sometimes i just didn't even want to go to school, and I didn't want to cut my hair, because then it would be like they won.   But the cartoon genuinely makes me feel uncomfortable VISUALLY, and I have ZERO doubt it would be at least somewhat more accessible to most people if they would just change the art style. Also, I've now realized the OP here isn't even the actual artist."
sadcomics,3cpi43,chikitavanana,2,Thu Jul 9 21:56:52 2015 UTC,"Never done any kind of art except music. Here we go.  He should make the eyes less elongated, while it is a cartoon and it's supposed to be unrealistic, they are uncomfortably long.  Try and keep the eyes in the same place relative to the head, they seem to move around from scene to scene.  The eyes also seem to be focused on nothing, or the irises are spread too far apart. This combined with the teeth make the kid seem mentally handicapped, not that it is necessarily bad to be handicapped, but I doubt that was the intention of the cartoonist.  At the end of the somersault scene, that's how resting eyes should be focused, just enough inward to show a little focus, but not too close to show concentration on one specific item.  The little boy(?)'s eyes' pupils are wider than his mother's, possibly because he is a kid, but it seems a bit akward.  I have never taken any drawing art classes, and I haven't done any art but music. It took me 10 minutes to figure this out, and I bet a pro art critic could do better. You really don't have to be a jerk about this."

Being dishonest is how people develop flawed self-images. I didn't say I didn't like the comic either, I said I didn't like the STYLE. The content is fine, the STYLE is completely gross and uncomfortable. And I've seen NO ONE try to claim they liked the style, so it's not really me not liking other people do at all. It's more other people are walking on eggshells, while I (as an actual artist) like to tell it like it is. There are things I like about the comic, there are things I do not like. Simple."

sadcomics,3bq9ck,Princepurple1,2,Wed Jul 1 22:58:27 2015 UTC,"Depends how you look at it in my opinion. Behind every piece of art no matter how small, inferior, or insignificant it may seem holds ulterior motive.This is where we find our truths, not just from the artistic vision but the human experience. Take for a moment an idea that extrapolates beyond the existence of these panels.  The pessimist, strong in character weak in soul, finds solidarity in the thought of unison of the expression of sympathetic comradery. The bystandard observes the pessimist actions but with a single word unknowingly causes him to lose faith. Thus the curse of the pessimist, a soul always fretting failure, searching for solidarity in others to compensate for his fleeting heart.  In this comic I see reflections of myself, as everyone should. In identifying with ourselves, and accepting our flaws, we find solidarity."
sadcomics,3bq9ck,Demoniclol,2,Wed Jul 1 16:36:16 2015 UTC,Youre over thinking it. Even the kid who drew this just wanted a joke using the word pessimism. There is nothing round breaking or insightful here.  Also the joke has been done a thousand times.
sadcomics,3bq9ck,Princepurple1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"It's not about over thinking the comic. I said to look beyond the comic. To the reader more specifically . It's about reflection in the human experience through artistic expression. We get the joke. We know its a joke. On the other hand, you can find insight on life everywhere. Ironically I'm talking more about finding a sense of optimism from pessimism."

sadcomics,3bjdyq,meltedlaundry,7,Mon Jun 29 21:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I understood the comic. But the explanation added another level of novelty to it. One of my favorite quotes by Friedrich Nietzche, often seen around reddit, and how I remember it off the top of my head is, ""a man must be careful when fighting monsters so that he himself does not become one. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back in to you.""  Honestly, imo existentialism is such an underrated philosophy. It's reality, seen in a realist view, with realist principles that manifests poetry. It's beautiful"

sadcomics,3ae1kp,e-wrecked,3,Fri Jun 19 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"I did a quick translation, I'm not entirely fluent in French though so I'm sure I made a mistake. Also keep in mind it sounds much more poetic in French than in English.  'You're Hebert, 1km up, no memories aside from falling. You contemplate the earth, as you pass through a cloud.  I like this, so I'll translate it in whole. ""You swim in emptiness. Nothing to your right, nothing to your left."" Further down, you see a cloud of birds. You watch the birds fly to somewhere unknown. You wish you could go with them.  It's the moment before impact. It seems infinite in your head. Your stomach seizes (butterflies in your stomach).   -Ending based on choice-. Everything is over.'  The three choices you have are ""contemplate, pray, and throw yourself."" The choices don't seem to affect anything other than the ending phrase you get."

sadcomics,37jgs9,Talki,12,Thu May 28 01:55:20 2015 UTC,Part of the comic is cropped out. The top part of the comic would be vader firing the stormtrooper for missing so many shots at rebels and then the stormtrooper declaring that without the empire he has nothing to live for. Sorry I can't upload it since I'm on my phone.  Not sure why but with that context it seems far less sad.
sadcomics,37jgs9,timscheller95,2,Thu May 28 13:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it seems less sad. He devoted his entire life to the ""state"" and has nothing without it..I think that's pretty sad"
sadcomics,37jgs9,DeadPrez1,3,Mon Jun 1 20:30:14 2015 UTC,You're right. As a big star wars fan I guess the context makes it clear to me that this comic isn't really about the stormtrooper as a character but rather about making a point about the movies.

I am pretty shure if i haven't been an total ass people would go: ""hey remember that immortal thing that he has going on? Lets dig!""

sadcomics,377cex,sarge21,0,Tue May 26 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"So, i am home now, so let me add to my comment.  You remember that that thing that security people like Mountainguards and stuff say before you go on a mountain, into the wildness or skeeing or whatever? Carry a transponder, announce to the local stations where you are and so on. It is the easiest thing not to be a silly person that dies because of silly things. These are simple daily things like ""look left and right before crossing the street"" that most people get right and since i have all the time in the universe why wouldn't i take the time to make it extra right?"
sadcomics,377cex,SkyUraeus,2,Tue May 26 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"Because you are going to live through the rises and falls of civilizations, wars, disasters, etc. Not to mention that being open and well known about your immortality may cause someone, over the course of millions of years, to capture you and imprison you in a hidden place forever.  You want to leave the planet? Well you now risk being lost in space forever or being stranded alone.   Let's say none of this happens, and humanity enters a perpetual golden age of peace and everyone universally celebrates your immortality. As humans evolve (and they will, faster than ever before due to gene selection/modification) you will be left in the dust as humanity evolves so far beyond you intellectually that there will reach a time when you have no comprehension of what's going on around you. Maybe you will be kept as a pet or a relic of the past but certainly you will not fit into the daily lives of these creatures.  On a long enough timescale, the risk of something going catastrophically wrong approaches a near certainty, regardless of what precautions you take.  Also, enjoy the heat death of the universe."

We might not though, if we keep killing each other and stagnating progress.   I do think that humanity will at least survive until the end of the universe because we will be able to send out sperm and artificial wombs and incubators into the deep reaches of space, kind of how the Kryptonians didn't die out. I see it as totally possible.   However, just because humanity won't die out doesn't mean you'll ever see it again.  Your decision to be immortal is not a good idea. Being immortal without being given the option for your consciousness to disappear might be the worst thing you could do to yourself. It'll be fun for a while, but then you'll be the only person to exist. Everyone you knew will be long gone. You will keep waiting in isolation, eventually having done everything so much that you can't find enjoyment in anything anymore. When the Earth is gone you will just float for millions of millions of years. Your mind will lose all sense it had anymore and will go mad. Every possible thought will have gone through your head infinitely many times and any concept that may be meaningful to you now - love, friendship, success, happiness - you simply won't be able to understand or feel anymore. You will be the wisest and most mad soul to have ever existed, and your only wish would be to free yourself."

sadcomics,377cex,daskrip,1 point,Tue May 26 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"Most here are pretty pessimistic. :-)  A bit selfcontradicting here. If we have the technology to leave Earth why would i stay here? Even if it is really slow, why would i stay here? Also if i, as mentioned above, make myself part vessel for humanitys DNA i would be like a moving spawn for humanity.  If i have all the time in the universe it would be pretty silly to let it come to that scenario.   And seen everything? How? Even if i live till the end of time in our Universe i will never have seen everything and will never have talk to everyone of dvery possible race in every possible configuration. That is the great thing about this: there is no end to the possibillitys. There is always another hill to climb and a new horizon to explore!

sadcomics,377cex,Felixader,1 point,Tue May 26 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"Not seen everything; thought everything. Seriously, don't underestimate the length of forever. That's how long you'd be floating in space for. And remember - you do not have the option to kill yourself. After the Earth is gone and you're floating in space, you do not have the option to try ""removing"" your consciousness by clawing through your ear and destroying your brain bit by bit.   Imagine going to prison for a lifetime. There are people that have done that. It's unbearable. Being locked up in a jail cell for every second of every hour of every day of your whole life, nothing to do. Now imagine having even less to do than in a prison, and not going for just one lifetime, but millions or billions of lifetimes. Our brains are simply not made to withstand that kind of boredom and stagnation. It would be the worst torture imaginable.   The only way I might agree to this kind of immortality is if I was frozen in a machine until someone finds me and unfreezes me. But I would require that the machine has absolutely 0 chance of ever failing to keep me frozen."

sadcomics,36borm,Gohack,7,Mon May 18 23:29:48 2015 UTC,"It's scary how much I can relate to this. It's something people don't understand about depression, I guess. You can't fall asleep at night, even if you're exhausted. And when you do, you'll be lucky to get 6 hours of troubled sleep and only wake up a couple of times throughout. And then when it's time to get up, you can't, and not because you aren't well rested (even though you aren't, you probably feel as tired as you went to sleep, if not more so) meaning you have to force yourself out of bed. You have to force yourself through the actions of a 'normal' life, even though you've long since forgotten what that feels like."

sadcomics,35yipy,phd2k1,4,Fri May 15 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"Real love is not needing to be with someone 24 hours a day and having to do things with each other constantly.   I know that this is some peoples' definition of a good relationship, but for me, I'd like to date someone with their own hobbies, their own passions, their own life.   Sure, it's sweet to cook together, go on walks, watch movies...but I'd like my partner to have friends outside of our relationship, maybe be in a play, join a softball league, or have a book club. I'd like a partner who doesn't want me to be by their side at all times.  This comic is cute, but to me it simply portrays a codependent couple. Vonnegut calls this a ""duprass"" in his book Cat's Cradle (great book btw). A duprass is a pair of interdependent people whose lives revolve around each other. They are usually married, and often die within a week of the other person. This is not the worst life style to have, according to Vonnegut, but also not the healthiest.  Anyway, I saw this comic floating around facebook recently and couldn't bring myself to be the stick in the mud shouting ""that's stupid! not real love!"" while everyone I know is totally into it. I think its a cute depiction of one possible manifestation of love, but not one that I would want to live.  Maybe it's just me being a broey douche bag, but my first reaction when I saw this comic was Dude, get a fucking life that doesn't revolve around your girlfriend's every beck and call!"

They're needy for the first 2 years, incredibly curious after they start walking and talking, they require emotional support, they require so much attention to make sure they don't get themselves injured, etc ad nauseam.  So, take a mother who isn't the most empathetic. She'll resent having to take care of a needy human being, who cries at seemingly random times and for random reasons. She won't understand the kid's feelings and the reasons for how (s)he behaves.  Add some situations when the child wasn't actually planned or wanted ..."

And those who in the last panel stay on the dependence truck are covered in at least some of the other hazards.  So I think this is much more about someone who does all the ""right"" things in life, avoids all the perils and pitfalls he or she sees others end up in...and then realizes, in the end, that they are unable to connect to others because everyone else didn't have the same life experiences the ""winner"" did.

It isn't out of reach, but being patient is hard when I'm frustrated right now.    So I decided I didn't want to be lonely, and recently got a pet, a fat cat that needed a home, and it's surprising how comforting it is to see her when I get home every day.  She sits in my lap and purrs while I play video games or watch a tv show.  Otherwise I try to improve on myself, what I know, what I can do, eat healthier food, get more exercise.  It all helps to improve my mood, and my attitude toward life.  Find what you like, what will put a smile on your face.

sadcomics,2ytcu4,epeen,3,Fri Mar 13 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"I believe it has something to do with them not wanting to be held accountable for a mishap.   For instance, if someone is being beaten by their husband there is a lot you can tell them to do in that situation. If you tell the person to stand up for themselves it can result in the other person getting violent, and then you indirectly caused a murder. Tell the person to leave, and they could end up homeless. There's a lot that can go wrong with just throwing advice out.  It sucks, but it's kind of understandable. So the suicide hotlines really only offers you a place to vent, and no solutions.  This is why we need more help for disadvantaged people. If homelessness is driving you to suicide, you will get no help from the suicide hotline. But if you had acceptable shelter, you wouldn't be thinking about suicide in the first place."

Otherwise, every person in those circumstances would be suicidal. The people on the other end of that line do care - a lot - and want you to know you're being heard and that you're a valuable being. Accepting that for what it is might lead to it helping a little more. I say this as someone with his own issues who is also sometimes the voice at the other end of the line (in a different capacity).  Everyone and their mothers can (and does) offer practical advice. Those in certain situations - the homeless fellow, the battered wife, the runaway teen and others - might get better practical tips from a social worker or 2-1-1."

sadcomics,2yg4k6,letoatreidesII,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:37:41 2015 UTC,"180-degree rule:       In film making, the 180-degree rule  is a basic guideline regarding the on-screen spatial relationship between a character and another character or object within a scene. An imaginary line called the axis connects the characters, and by keeping the camera on one side of this axis for every shot in the scene, the first character is always frame right of the second character, who is then always frame left of the first. The camera passing over the axis is called jumping the line or crossing the line; breaking the 180-degree rule by shooting on all sides is known as shooting in the round.    Image i - This schematic shows the axis between two characters and the 180° arc on which cameras may be positioned (green). When cutting from the green arc to the red arc, the characters switch places on the screen.

sadcomics,2yg4k6,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:38:15 2015 UTC,"My intention was to lock in the thought by visually creating a wall with the last panel. If the camera angle remained the same your eye would keep going to the right when reading the comic. The way it's setup your eye follows the nose downward to the ""Maybe I'll feel better"" line or your eye follows the character's eye back to the first panel as he looks back on his drifting thoughts. Edit: spelling"

Which is a outlook on children's cartoons that certainly lacks a lot of perspective, but it is especially surprising coming from someone whose screenname is based on one that is generally pretty well regarded.  I'm sorry the comic didn't work for you. I think it worked for some other people so I disagree that it flat out failed.  Don't sweat that you don't have any advice. I don't really care about your advice in particular on how to fix it because you don't seem like either a nice or a considerate person."

sadcomics,2xmcu1,toastnbacon,5,Mon Mar 2 12:31:08 2015 UTC,"It's okay, I'm pretty tough.  It is a tricky balance dealing with negative comments because you can't really grow as an artist if you just stick your fingers in your ears and say ""if you didn't like it, it must not be for you"" while at the same time it is okay that not everyone likes/gets/appreciates what you doing and if you let it get to you it is paralyzing.  It is useful for me to know that you read one of my comics and had the reaction ""Jesus christ this is absolutely awful"". Truthfully. I want my comics to have broad appeal and it is good to know if I am achieving that goal and in what ways I am failing to.  That said, people are different and not every comic is for you. While as a writer I need to accept that and work to make my comics better so they work for more people, as a reader you need to accept that and recognize that just because you don't like something doesn't mean there is anything wrong with it or that your objections are quite as important as you think they are.  I love telling dumb jokes about sad feelings. I think to some people those jokes have a sort of ""faux deep"" vibe to them. I don't care so much about that because I think that's an inevitable side-effect of telling those jokes.  It sucks to have your reaction to a comic written off as an unfortunate side-effect. It sucks when something isn't for you. I get it. And if you find like-minded people, it's fun to indulge in that feeling of insult, because it counteracts the feeling of isolation you get when a comic doesn't work for you.  But it's nice not to do it in a way that invalidates the opinions of people who DID like the thing you don't like. And I don't think calling something objectively awful is really hitting the mark there.  Anyway, don't sweat it.  That "":("" was mostly insincere."

This is damaging relationships, even ones that are traditionally close and nurturing, like parental ones. I think the comic is suggesting here an unbreakable bond between mother and child, but stretched and and withered into uselessness. The adult son glancing over his shoulder, is feeling melancholy for the warmness and support of a mother-son relationship but it's not there, they each too absorbed in their own escape to maintain such a thing. They might as well be strangers or friends, for all they are like mother and child. But the bond is there, quietly laying across the floor, connecting them. It makes him sad and he does not know why. Her funeral will be very hard and he will not understand why. It will only be years later, after a long depression and much soul searching that he will understand the bond and he will mourn leaving it to wither. He can finally grieve properly, as a child, acknowledging the bond and how much it meant. He may have closure but he will never have the relationship he needed with his mother. Something will always be a little bit wrong. And it's sad."

sadcomics,2x6kw2,muhammadtalhas,38,Thu Feb 26 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"So, I don't mean to hijack OP's thread, but I just felt like sharing my story...  I've told it before, but this seems like the appropriate forum to tell it again:  When I was in the military, I served a little time in the Honor Guard.  For those of you that don't know what that is, the Honor Guard does a number of things, but they are most well known as the men/women who fold the flag and fire the rifles at military funerals.  Taps is played and they present the folded flag to the next of kin.  For me, the most asked questions is, “How did you do it without crying?”  And, while keeping your military bearing can be one of the most difficult aspects of the job, it is extremely necessary in order to provide the dignity and honor to the deceased, that they earned throughout their service.  Not everyone was able to maintain their composure while they looked into the eyes of another person, witnessed the grieving for a lost loved one, and presented a flag in exchange for someone that could never be replaced.  For this reason, there were a specified few of us that were entrusted to carry out this part of the ceremony, every time.  We trained rigorously, and had several tricks to distance ourselves from the situation to preserve our military bearing and professionalism.  Amongst these tricks, we used repetition and memorization to remove the grieving and sadness from the funeral and make it a more impersonal job.  When presenting a folded flag to the next of kin, it was mandated that the individual recite, “On behalf of the President of the United States, the Department of the Air Force, and a grateful nation, I present, to you, this flag.  You and your family are in our thoughts and prayers on this day.”  A similar speech was mandated when that individual returned to present three of the fired rifle casings used in the final salute.  These speeches were recited, practiced, and memorized to a point where it was no longer personal, but almost mechanical.  Everything was calculated, planned, and practiced thousands of times before the public ever saw us “perform” our duties.  Even our commands and motions were mandated and conducted to the point that a right hand was to be presented over a left hand in one situation, and vice-versa in another.  We used exorbitant amounts of attention to detail to focus our minds on our job instead of the grieving that was all around us, all of the time.  This routine and practice, coupled with the extreme attention to detail, gave us an essential tool to provide the respect and professionalism that was expected of us.  Although I knew that this was the case, I never understood just what a valuable tool this was until it was too late.  One August day, we received notice that there would be a funeral for a young girl in our area, and that we needed to prepare for it.  The details of this particular funeral would quickly come to light since we were unable to find any information on the young lady.  It was almost as if she had never joined the Air Force at all.  On top of this, we were asked to provide two flags, as well as two shadow boxes for those flags, for the funeral.  This information usually meant that the flags would be presented to the parents of the deceased, and that those parents were separated.  Assembling the shadow boxes for these flags proved to be extremely difficult since we were unable to find her rank, name tags, or any medals that she had been awarded.  We were forced to fabricate these items ourselves, which delayed the assembly even further.  Because of this issue, it didn't take long for us to discover what the problem was: she had only been in the Air Force for about a week when, during Basic Training, she had become sick.  In fact, she had become so sick, so fast, the doctors were unable to diagnose her before she passed away.  For this reason, she had yet to be awarded rank, medals, or even a name tag.  This was very unusual and made the proper assembly of the boxes not only difficult, but impossible to complete before the ceremony.  So, after much practice, we were forced to go along with the funeral without the shadow boxes due to the time restrictions.  With the exception of the missing boxes, the funeral went perfectly.  It was a very small ceremony with only a handful of people attending, including the mother and father, who sat on opposite sides of the group.  Afterwards, we left to complete the shadow boxes and tried to make arrangements to deliver them.  The father was easy to reach and told us that he was available at any time.  He explained how he lived alone and worked as a truck driver, so he had an awkward sleep schedule and didn't mind visitors, regardless of the time of day.  The mother, on the other hand, was impossible to reach.  For this reason, the father offered to deliver her box to her as thanks for our hard work and the “beautiful ceremony.”  He explained that, although he and her didn't usually talk, he would make an exception in this case for his daughter.  So, I was tasked, along with another Honor Guard member, to suit-up and drive to this man's house to deliver the boxes.  More than willing to do this, we quickly acquired a black government vehicle, got into our ceremonial attire, and drove to his home.  Upon arriving, we immediately noticed that he was sitting on the front bumper of his semi.  Beside it was a ragged trailer that was dwarfed by the massive truck.  It looked as if it could have been condemned at any moment.  The yard was such a mess and the trailer was in such a state of disrepair, my co-worker and I were both surprised that anyone lived there.  If we hadn't known the address or remembered the man's face, we would have never imagined that the man from before, dressed in a suit and tie, was living there.  We pulled into the driveway, got out of the car, and I carried the boxes to the man.  His eyes were puffy from crying for the last several days, and he just looked at me.  He stared into my eyes for a second when I realized that, since this type of circumstance had never happened before, I didn't have anything prepared.  I had nothing to say to him.  I handed him the two boxes as I looked directly into his tear-filled eyes and said the first thing that popped into my mind, “Thank you for your sacrifice.”  At that moment, he dropped the boxes, grabbed me in the heaviest hug I had ever had, and relentlessly cried on my shoulder.  Knowing that I had to keep my military bearing and stand there at the position of attention, arms to my side, emotionless, and distinguished, I did what I had to do: I hugged him back and cried with him.  Neither of us said anything, but it was one of the deepest conversations I have ever had.  I instantly understood who he was, where he had come from, and how these last couple of months had unfolded for him.  I understood how he had lost his wife, his home, and finally, his only child.  I felt the weight that he carried on his shoulders, and I wanted to help him -- but all I could do was stand there and thank him for his sacrifice.  I knew that I could never give him his daughter back, but I could give him a shoulder to cry on.  So I broke every rule I had ever practiced.  Although I knew what I had done was against the regulations and that I could be stripped of rank, fined a large percentage of my paycheck, and/or heavily reprimanded, I didn't care.  We embraced each other for what seemed like an eternity until he pushed me away, looked me in the eye, and said, “No, thank you.”  At that point, he picked up the boxes, turned around, and walked into the dilapidated trailer.    At that moment, I realized that no man should ever outlive his child.  That's just not the way the universe is designed to work, and it must be one of the worst feelings a person could ever endure."

I've never been the type to show my emotions, a many few years back, i was a child when my next door neighbor passed away in a car accident, and when I was a kid, and truthfully still, i never had friends. He was about 30 and i was maybe 10 at the time. He would invite me over, because he had the coolest videogames and stuff. He was my only, and best friend. He started dating my aunt, and for a while everything was great, and one day, he called me over with something in his hand. He handed me a small, leather wallet, and told me to keep it, but to not tell my sister, because he was planning on getting her something very soon, and wanted it to be a surprise. That was the last time I ever saw him, face to face. In the following weeks at the funeral, i kept my composure, because i felt like me crying would make me seem annoying and greedy, taking away from him. It was weeks later, and for no reason at all, i was sitting in my room and I just started bawling , into my pillow and sheets. This went on for maybe 10 minutes, and is the most i've ever personally cried in my life. The next time, was last year, when the girl I thought I loved left me, and again, it was weeks before it broke me down.  Sorry for the long post, and thank you for all you do."

sadcomics,2soxlx,Klacky,74,Sat Jan 17 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"So, in the original comics, it's never really clear whether or not John can actually hear Garfield. Garfield doesn't really talk in the first place, all of his dialogue is in thought bubbles.   So GMG is really what's happening to John Arbuckle, except he's just talking out loud to his cat, which he knows can't understand or at the very least can't respond. And in the comics that he is responding to Garfield directly, it's probably what he imagines Garfield saying because he's so starved for interaction, having an external object on which to project his imagined other half of his internal dialogue is the closest he comes to social comfort.   GMG only highlights this dim reality. And that's exactly why I find it so crushingly hilarious."

The title kinda helps with deducing this puzzle, though. They want to help him get his message across without taking the dive for it, basically."
sadcomics,2qteak,bigb00gie,8,Tue Dec 30 23:10:36 2014 UTC,"I think that he was trying to set himself on fire in protest, trying to garner sympathy from the audience (think of the monk setting himself on fire to protest Vietnam).  And instead of everyone going ""don't do it"", they actually offer him a lighter when he can't find one (think of the person screaming ""do a flip"" at a jumper on a bridge)."
sadcomics,2qteak,TNine227,3,Tue Dec 30 23:35:27 2014 UTC,"This is how I see it, but you put it more eloquently than I did when I tried to explain it.  He's trying to make a statement and shock people, but they don't care and are dealing with it like ""Somebody set him on fire so we can get this over with.""  I think the OP (Not the creator, as the title is different) saw it as them calling him out on his bluff, but his expression when he doesn't have a lighter makes it not seem that way to me.  Edit: Followed link, the creator said it was people calling him out on his bluff."

I gather that this is some kind of ""fame sucks"" message."
sadcomics,2qteak,GeneralDisorder,2,Tue Dec 30 20:57:33 2014 UTC,One interpretation would be that he's protesting the government and how wrong the system is and purposefully doesn't bring a lighter so he doesn't really have to light himself on fire. You know all the gusto and everything of such a graphic showing but without the actual death part. Then everyone offers him a lighter to see if he'll actually do it and he falls through.

In the comic Donald and the nephews are outside carolling. In the mean time, Scrooge is at home reading old letters. The letters are all from Jenny and tell a little story about her life.  First, Jenny wrote to McDuck asking for a bit of money. Presumably, she lives with her mother and they are somewhat poor. In the next letter, she thanks for the money and mentions her mothers operation. So Jenny's mother has health problems.  The third letter talks about Jennifer's mother in the past tense, suggesting that she has passed away. She mentions flowers that Scrooge probably sent for the funeral.  In the last letter Jenny writes about her graduation and addresses McDuck as 'uncle'. So he seemingly adopted her after her mother's death and continues to take care of her.  Meanwhile, Donald doesn't think that Scrooge knows about the spirit of Christmas. But as we've seen, he actually knows a bit."

sadcomics,2pox31,cunninglinguist81,14,Thu Dec 18 16:19:55 2014 UTC,"I agree. The comic assumes that all people have the same possibilities, the same starting position. Being born in a moderatel wealthy country by moderately wealthy parents may give yout the impression that everything is just up to you. It's the dogma of the ""meritocracy"" - a dogma that is quite convenient for the ruling classes, since it legitimises their position of power. But in fact it does not only depend on you but a lot on the context in which you are happen to be born in. Nobody can tell me that a girl born in Kinshasa has the same opportunities as the son of a billionaire. ""If you are poor and have a miserable life, girl from Kinshasa, that's just what you actually want!""? The fuck no!

sadcomics,2pox31,cunninglinguist81,1 point,Thu Dec 18 18:37:52 2014 UTC,You missed the point. He never said it was a guarantee that you would find riches or even happiness.   He's reiterating the fact that you have to try. Nowhere did he state that the goals you are working towards are a certainty.
sadcomics,2pox31,highjayb,2,Thu Dec 18 19:13:29 2014 UTC,"No. ""If you wanted money enough, you'd figure out what you had to do to get it, and do it. The fact that you haven't just means you don't want it enough.""  He absolutely says it's a guarantee if you want it badly enough to take those steps. (You are correct about happiness.)"
sadcomics,2pox31,cunninglinguist81,2,Thu Dec 18 19:01:21 2014 UTC,"That's the thing though, we always work towards goals as if they are obtainable. The way I interpreted it to mean was that if you truly wanted something bad enough, you would have figured a way to get it. No matter what.   The dude in the comic sounds like a cynical dick, but the truth rarely sounds good.   And he said, ""you'd figure out what you had to do to get it, and do it"". He merely states that you would truly try to achieve the goals you want if you wanted them, he didn't say you'd get the riches. He said you would do what you figured will get you what you want. I don't really see that as a comment made for certainty"
sadcomics,2pox31,highjayb,2,Thu Dec 18 19:13:22 2014 UTC,"Hmm, with the way in which he said it, I do. I think you can state the truth far more effectively using different words, and sound like less of a dick doing it.  i.e. ""There are no guarantees except that if you don't try in the first place you will fail for sure."""
sadcomics,2pox31,cunninglinguist81,3,Thu Dec 18 19:44:22 2014 UTC,"The way I interpreted it to mean was that if you truly wanted something bad enough, you would have figured a way to get it. No matter what.    No, this is stupid. It doesn't matter how much I want a perpetual motion machine I will never get one."
sadcomics,2pox31,gnutrino,2,Thu Dec 18 21:06:10 2014 UTC,"We're talking under the concept of who you want to be in life, or where you are at.  And it doesn't matter what you want, because it's not a certainty that you will get it.  If you had read my second paragraph I would have elaborated. The point is that you might not get it, but you can at least make choice towards it"
sadcomics,2pox31,highjayb,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:39:41 2014 UTC,"It's an interesting thought. You may say you want it, but if you wanted it bad enough you WOULD figure out how to do it. There's someone with more money than you willing to pay you to do something depraved so they don't have to."
sadcomics,2pox31,ConebreadIH,24,Thu Dec 18 21:45:52 2014 UTC,"I gotta agree. ""Want something, go get it"" is a fucking stupid thing to say. Things aren't as black and white as all that. The guy telling people to just go do it comes off as a huge dick."
sadcomics,2pox31,LuminiferousEthan,8,Wed Jan 7 09:54:39 2015 UTC,If you do nothing towards getting something how do you ever expect to actually get it?  He's a jerk but he's right.  Life is made by your actions; not your wishes.
sadcomics,2pox31,Sasakura,4,Thu Dec 18 16:40:05 2014 UTC,"So... is this before or after the ""hand"" comic?  Which way did he change his mind?"
sadcomics,2pox31,CitizenPremier,2,Thu Dec 18 18:45:47 2014 UTC,http://www.akimbocomics.com/?p=573
sadcomics,2pox31,theboyleastlikely,2,Thu Dec 18 23:45:36 2014 UTC,So... after.  It's funny because this comic is like the perfect response to the one posted.
sadcomics,2pox31,CitizenPremier,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:52:43 2014 UTC,And also this: http://www.akimbocomics.com/?p=82
sadcomics,2pox31,theboyleastlikely,9,Fri Dec 19 01:11:26 2014 UTC,"obviously we all want the wrong things.   this is the most important part of the comic.  the rest of it is a lot of bullshit, but this point is extremely significant.  if you want to be rich, but aren't, your goal shouldn't be to work as hard as you can to get rich.  your goal should be to not want to be rich."
sadcomics,2pox31,jeegte12,3,Sat Dec 20 02:17:47 2014 UTC,you can certainly focus on something that also helps you get rich though
sadcomics,2pox31,rotarded,2,Thu Dec 18 20:42:49 2014 UTC,but why?  why get rich?  it doesn't make people happier.
sadcomics,2pox31,jeegte12,7,Thu Dec 18 21:41:04 2014 UTC,"it makes life easier (not necessarily simpler) so that you can have the power to make other people happier.  this is assuming, of course, that you are a decent person"
sadcomics,2pox31,rotarded,-1,Thu Dec 18 21:53:28 2014 UTC,"haha, so people want to get rich to help other people?  ""decent people"" aren't the ones who actually think this way.  incredibly rare truly altruistic people think this way, and they're too busy actually doing things to help people to think about getting rich."
sadcomics,2pox31,jeegte12,1 point,Thu Dec 18 21:57:13 2014 UTC,"you could say decent people are also ""open-minded"""
sadcomics,2pox31,rotarded,1 point,Fri Dec 19 03:17:36 2014 UTC,"Technically it does, but only to a point. There have been some great studies on this - I think for most parts of the U.S. (since it is also based on local affordability) the cutoff is around $100K a year.  At that point all of your basic needs, including being able to save for retirement, children, college, etc., are fulfilled - psych profiles of people at that level or higher show about the same levels of contentment, satisfaction, and happiness, whereas those below it steadily decrease.  Above that level life doesn't get happier - just more complicated and deluded."
sadcomics,2pox31,cunninglinguist81,1 point,Fri Dec 19 03:20:45 2014 UTC,"Being richer than 100k a year opens a lot of doors for you. You can travel the world and meet experience different cultures without any fear of destroying your career once you come back home. You can influence politics to a level that would be much harder for someone less wealth.  And what about people with specific hobbies? I love cars and I would be extremely happy to own some super cars. And yes, there is definitely diminishing returns if your reason for buying them is to show off or as a status symbol, but if you crave the very physical visceral thrill from driving a roaring g force instilling machine, then there is nothing that can provide you such joy other than millions of dollars to spend.   Being rich allows you to enjoy hobbies, to travel, to become an influencer, to help out people in need, and to make a difference in the world. Sure if you only care about showing off your wealth and buying useless status symbols, I can see how $100k a year is enough. If you want to experience all that life has to offer, I can see being rich to very very fulfilling."
sadcomics,2pox31,Razor_Storm,1 point,Fri Dec 19 02:54:49 2014 UTC,"It's not more fulfilling than other hobbies, though - only more expensive.  100K allows for most people to take plenty of vacations, enough to maintain their happiness at ""peak level"" anyway. Wanting to race performance cars doesn't make your life more fulfilling - it just means you chose something to fulfill you that is particularly expensive.  I'm only quoting from the psych profiles article I read of course - point is, once all your basics are taken care of and you have a financial safety buffer, the only difference more money makes is the ""icing"" on your cake gets more expensive."

sadcomics,2pox31,magnusu2009,2,Fri Dec 19 16:07:57 2014 UTC,"I understand the meaning of this comic, but in a way, it sort of cheers me up! What the dark-haired philosopher was saying was so simple that it reminds everyone truly how to get the best of of their own lives, how it's a matter of perseverance :)"
sadcomics,2pox31,tigregrafo,0,Thu Dec 18 23:38:31 2014 UTC,Anyone else think this guy is sexist?
sadcomics,2pox31,tinybrownbird,3,Sun Dec 28 00:31:07 2014 UTC,"Don't think so. I mean the dark haired guy pretty obviously is, but the author himself gets pretty deep on gender topics."
