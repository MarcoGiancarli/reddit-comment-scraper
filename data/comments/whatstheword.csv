For example, the statement ""all cell phones in the room are turned off"" may be true simply because there are no cell phones in the room. In this case, the statement ""all cell phones in the room are turned on"" would also be true, and vacuously so, as would the conjunction of the two: ""all cell phones in the room are turned on and turned off""."

I'm an accounting Ph.D. student, and I am currently trying to do some research in this area. Even academics cannot agree on terms for ""aggressive tax strategies"", but I can give you some of the highlights.  ""Tax Aggressiveness"" is generally used to describe any individual or company that takes active measures to pay less in taxes. This may involve any strategy or scheme that goes beyond normal tax planning, including both legal and illegal activities.  ""Tax Avoidance"" is specifically used in accounting to describe active tax planning that is within the legal boundaries of the tax code. This can include basic tax planning as well as more aggressive activities, but in all cases, they must be legal to fall into this category.  ""Tax Evasion"" is the opposite of tax avoidance and describes activities to mitigate taxes that are illegal. Corporations are careful never to use ""tax evasion"" to describe their own activities."

whatstheword,3dpeu9,FreezrBurnz,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:33 2015 UTC,"Well, perhaps the old Shakespearean ""quintessence"" might work."
whatstheword,3dpeu9,supernatural_skeptic,2,Sat Jul 18 11:44:55 2015 UTC,"Scintilla or possibly just particle?   Kind of depends on what substance your talking about, guacamole for instances is a mixture of several things so the smallest amount possible will have to have salt, avocado, lime juice, etc and would be larger than say a minute piece of wood or paper.   I personally like ""speck"" or ""trace"", gets the idea across plainly and succinctly although scintilla is a pretty cool word in its own right."

whatstheword,3dpeu9,hungryfarmer,0,Sat Jul 18 07:10:17 2015 UTC,Probably not what you're looking for but technically you would be correct in saying molecule. Anything made of matter that isn't a pure element is a collection of _______ molecules.
whatstheword,3dpeu9,Icehouse24ozCan,2,Sat Jul 18 14:26:49 2015 UTC,You can't have a molecule of stainless steel or a molecule of lettuce.
whatstheword,3dpeu9,hungryfarmer,0,Sat Jul 18 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"Well first stainless steel isn't a perfect description. Steel is just an iron atom lattice with carbon and other ""impurities"". Stainless steel molecules would be composed of some ratio of iron, chromium, and carbon atoms. There are very specific definitions of what is what in the metal alloy world."
whatstheword,3dpeu9,Icehouse24ozCan,2,Sat Jul 18 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, so you can't have a molecule of it."
