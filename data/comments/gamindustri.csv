gamindustri,3e6dj2,Shinjiro_Aragaki,2,Wed Jul 22 08:46:04 2015 UTC,For all the dungeons that offer the University outfits I have ran them stock.   Ive been able to get the full set for Blanc and Vert. I have the outfit for Nep but im missing the hat. None so far for Noire. Im looking into the idea that it might require the Jumping Star plan. I have the plan that shows the hidden blocks but it might not be showing a block up there because I have not explored there.  Jumping Star can be found in the first brick in Halo Forest (Leanbox)
gamindustri,3e6dj2,Shinjiro_Aragaki,3,Wed Jul 22 08:52:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Running through PS dimension now, looking for it. Can you please tell me where you got the Blanc and Vert ones?"

While I'm not certain what is the maximum amount of storage obtainable, I remember that after about 3 full playthroughs of Re;Birth 1, I maxed it out."
gamindustri,3e3rkx,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:54 2015 UTC,hopefully as getting the oracles is very long process to me
gamindustri,3e1s14,thugnificence,3,Tue Jul 21 08:09:52 2015 UTC,"As ShadeEmpire said, when you get into Chapters 4 and 5, there will be events that appear that will end up giving you items. Those items are needed in order to get the Good Ending.  Without Good Ending, the game ends when you finish Chapter 6. Good Ending finishes at Chapter 9 (You have until the beginning of Chapter 8 until the end of Chapter 9 to Scout and view the events of all six Hidden Dungeons for True Ending,) and True Ending finishes with the Final Boss in Chapter 10.  If you want to go for True Ending, then you need to use the Scout System to uncover six Hidden Dungeons in certain areas, and then in Chapter 8, run to the end of those Hidden Dungeons to view Events in order to progress onto True Ending. The Scouting System is fairly easy as well. Say you send a Scout to a Dungeon, and said Dungeon takes them 6 days to Scout to give you useful info, you can just repeatedly enter and leave a dungeon six times, and it counts as a day each time.   Otherwise, Questing isn't really necessary, aside from the ones that you have to do throughout the Chapters in order to progress onto the next Story Event.  If you are going to go for True Ending, I suggest you scout Dungeons and change the Enemy Info so that stronger Tough Enemies appear, or you do as many Quests / Share Grinding / monster killing and whatnot as possible during each chapter. You can get Large Medals from those Strong Monsters, or from the Chapter Reviews, and you can use them for an event in Planeptune that gives you a Game Disc. I don't know which Chapter it is, but once you get past a certain point, you can't get the Game Disc Events anymore. If you don't have Game Discs (which I did not ) and you want to do the True Ending, you can do it at around level 65 - 70 with your party, but it is REALLY difficult. You will pretty much be hoping that Boss RNG is good for you if you want to be able to beat the game, but it is definitely a satisfying fight with great music."
gamindustri,3e1s14,Rajaxx,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:30 2015 UTC,"I only played Re;Birth 3, but based on that, I recommend you just rush through the game first time through, for a nice challenge.   You can leave the optional stuff for another playthrough, so that you'll have an incentive to see what you've missed and not get bored with the repetition."
gamindustri,3e1s14,Shinjiro_Aragaki,2,Tue Jul 21 09:13:45 2015 UTC,"There are some missable events (in chapters 4 and 5 I think...), and if you lost them you can't get the good or true ending only the normal ending. Just check all around the map every time. Or don't, and get the normal ending in the first playthrough."
gamindustri,3e1s14,ShadeEmpire,2,Tue Jul 21 12:07:36 2015 UTC,"Some of the quests can't be completed as soon as you actually get them. The first ones that come to mind are the Ice Skeletons quest from the first chapter, and the Gargoyle quest in, I think, Chapter 4. The former because the monsters don't even appear until Chapter 2, and the latter because there's no way you'll be strong enough to even hit it at that point, much less beat it."
gamindustri,3e1s14,reallygoodbee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"There's some quest that only appear during certain chapter but AFAIK there's only one is missable the other are needed to advance the story progress. If you want a quest master trophy it's advisable to play all quest in true ending route because it has more quest. The details ask you to clear 100 different quests in 1 gameplay, so replaying more than once doesn't count. Strange thing I finished my 1st playthrough with normal ending and continue to half true ending in 2nd playthrough and get the trophy. The condition isn't really clear about this trophy"
gamindustri,3e17ls,Frolicks,8,Tue Jul 21 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"Watch it twice, once dub and once sub.  The voices for both are wonderful."
gamindustri,3e17ls,ZombiAgris,3,Tue Jul 21 09:39:04 2015 UTC,I say watch both.
gamindustri,3e17ls,stealthcl0wn,3,Tue Jul 21 10:35:42 2015 UTC,"Initially, when I first saw the title of the topic I was going to say sub. But after reading your post in more detail I would recommend that you watch the dub. I have personally never watched the dub all the way through (I know how the dubs sound though). If the Neptune, that you are fond of, in your head already speaks English then I believe you should just enjoy the series with the Neptune you already know and love. Since this an anime, I can't image the personality and antics of the characters going to far off from their intended anime persona. Neptune's personality is pretty different in the anime in comparison to the game. Also the Japanese Neptune's personality is sort of different from the localized US Neptune.  Even so, you should know what you are missing when you watch the English Dub. First off, as you probably already know, the Anime Industry is quite big in Japan. Thus, in Japan, the competition for voice actors/actresses (seiyuu) is pretty cut throat and competitive. It just also so happens that this series carries some of the best voice actresses of that competitive industry. Many times characters designs are made with top name seiyuus in mind (especially animes/games with moe character designs). The big ones being Blanc, Vert, Neptune, Nepgear, Plutia, and Uni. Not that the English VAs aren't competitive or fitting but a lot of the character designs and dialogues are created around with the original VAs in mind, since the VAs are chosen while the anime/game are being designed.    Also for localized dubs, liberties must be taken. The auditory dialogue must match the ""mouth flaps"" that are displayed on the screen. This makes literal translations almost impossible. In general, they must change cultural references to fit their intended audience.Even among ""fansubs"" there is a divide on liberal vs conservative translations.   So, I say if you want to enjoy a ""NepNep"" that's closer to the Nep you already know and love then go see the Dub. If you really want a closer view on what they are really trying to say then go for the subs. If you dislike ""cute anime voices"" choose the English dubs I guess. I know a decent amount of people also aren't fond of listening to a language they don't understand or reading subtitles instead of listening to voices and I can understand that.   From the youtube clips of the English dubs I've seen and my experience with some of the dubs and text in the game, I feel as if the English dubbed anime Neptune is closer to the English dubbed game Neptune than the Japanese dubbed anime Neptune is to Japanese dubbed game Neptune.  English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQu2EHV6KPU  Japanese w/ English Sub: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3fTu7IRm'3M  The personalities seem a bit different. English base Neptune actually sounds pretty good.  Personally in my head, the Neptune I know is somewhat ditzy and childish and also says ""Nepu"" a lot (nepu is actually Neptune's signature ""word"" that she always says, which is similar to plutia's ""puru"" or Noire's nowa [she doesn't say it as often as Neptune or Plutia though]). Compa is extremely polite in her speech and also uses a lot of ""keigo"" and desu. She also calls Neptune by ""Nepunepu"" and Nepgear as ""Gear-chan"". IF calls Neptune ""Nepko"". Nepgear calls Neptune Oneechan and Neptune calls Nepgear ""Nepgear"". And Histoire's pet name is ""Issun"". I'll admit though, Neptune voice in my head is sometimes in English but it is still Tanaka Rie's voice (although she usually speaks in Japanese). The leaders of each country are called Goddesses (Megami) not CPUs and transformations are not referred to as HDD forms. But to each their own.   It's very interesting, usually for anime, the majority is always leaning towards subs but for Japanese games and this subreddit, (from my observation anyway) is split down the middle between sub and dubs.  I also want to apologize for digressing so much. In general, I have a bad habit of writing excessively when posting on reddit.   I want to end with the statement that I could listen to Tanaka Rie's Neptune all day. Also that Asumi Kana (Blanc), Horie Yui (Nepgear), Kitamura Eri (Uni) and Hanazawa Kana (Plutia) are like real life voice goddesses to me. Hanazawa's Plutia melts my soul. Ogura yui's Rom is literally one of the cutest things I've ever heard. Something about Asumi Kana's angry Blanc makes me want to get yelled at by her.  Nepu"

gamindustri,3e17ls,Luminous083,3,Tue Jul 21 05:13:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, when it comes to Sub V. Dub I dont think anyone will leave happy no matter what answer you give.  A good example I always use is Code Geass. I know back when I was looking into watching it I looked around to see peoples thoughts on the sub as well as the dub and it was almost 50/50 as to what people said. Yet, if you look at the responses the other side always said their way is superior.   So that really puts you back at square one generally. Yes, there are exceptions where some dubs are bad, I know personally I like sub more often than not but my dad was trying to get some bonding time and I decided to watch Attack On Titan with him on Adult Swim and I did not like the dub at all. It almost feels like they missed the mark on half the characters, but, I still wouldnt say someone is wrong for watching that way. They just prefer to watch how they like.  Edit: It probably is a troll thread by the way, but on the odd chance it wasnt I figured id give my two cents anyway."

Now all that is ancient history. I will now wait for Victory II and the other vita games to come out.
gamindustri,3e0t94,mikhdrag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"About two semesters ago my friend had told me about a recent PSN sale that just happened to have Neptunia on it. I had remembered when he got his copy for the Vita he had played it so much and it was practically all he talked about for weeks on end. After noticing that it was on sale he told me multiple times that I needed to get the game. We talk about anime with each other pretty much all the time so when he told me it was something I would probably enjoy I gave him enough credit and decided to look it up.  I think the first thing I stumbled upon was the opening to the game, I thought the characters were really nice looking and that the music was pretty good. At that point I was pretty willing to buy the game. After that I ended up looking up some gameplay and thought that the brick based combat was pretty cool. The idea that as long as you took the time to line up your attacks you could do more damage was awesome to me.  So about a day later I ended up buying the game and right around the time I did the first little dungeon that taught you combat I HATED the game. Yeah, I felt like I wasnt going to like the game at all. I had sent a few words at my friend for suggesting the game to me (of course they were all sarcastic) and continued playing. Luckily I got to a point that saved the game for me. The story. It's weird how it just pulls you in and makes you have a good time.  Fast forward to today and ive played pretty much anything Nep aside from PP and have finished the anime as well. I also will likely end up getting LE's of the rest of the games (started with Nep U LE and now RB3 LE). I also make it a goal to help people that are interested in getting into the series or people who are stuck in the game. The community for the game is another reason I love the series so much so being able to help where I can is just as awesome for me as getting the next big hit in the series.  In short, its kinda crazy how you can actually hate a game and somehow end up loving it for all its flaws because the story is just so catchy. Nowdays whenever someone asks about the game I always tell them to give it the benefit of the doubt because I know that I almost didnt, and that would have been a shame."
gamindustri,3e0t94,Luminous083,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:48 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to know what about Re;birth1 got people into Neptunia in the first place, because every time a new game comes out, there's always newcomers who buy it and love the series.  The story, maybe?  The only things that PP had going for it, I find, were the characters (for preexisting fans) and graphics (still the best to date)."
gamindustri,3e0t94,Luminous083,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:21 2015 UTC,"I think for me it was just how relaxed the story was. The character interactions just seemed really natural to me. The humor was another big thing for me. Im someone where you could literally say ANYTHING and I could probably laugh. So add that in with the general jokery that was RB1 and I was sold.  I think alot of the newcomers probably had the same mindset as me in the beginning. Before I knew anything about the game I wrote it off as some niche game that was pumped out for people that were into moe characters. I didnt think in game graphics and textures were great at the time and I basically completely wrote off the game when I first saw it and I didnt expect the game to go anywhere. Basically some one hit wonder. However, here we are and Neptunia has basically exploded in comparison to what it used to be and I think people may have taken notice and possibly changed their perspective a little. They may now be looking at it and saying ""hey if there have been this many releases the game cant be that bad right?"" and naturally most people would tell them to start with RB1. So that would be my best guess, a change in perspective most likely.  I am happy to see that this subreddit has begun to thrive over the past few months. Not only that, but for the past few months the Vita reddit has been buzzing with Nep too. Its good to see more of them taking notice of games other than P4."

That would've TEH BEST THING EVAH!!!!!   Before I knew anything about the game I wrote it off as some niche game that was pumped out for people that were into moe characters.   Probably the reason we'll never see TotalBiscuit review the game.  Then again, he hates the anime artstyle with a passion....   They may now be looking at it and saying ""hey if there have been this many releases the game cant be that bad right?"" and naturally most people would tell them to start with RB1.   I think that might also have to do with the fact that IFI is catching up pretty quickly to the Japanese release schedule.  I mean, all the Vita games (except PP and Re;birth1) have all come out in the past 7 months.  Thats quite a lot for some people....   I am happy to see that this subreddit has begun to thrive over the past few months. Not only that, but for the past few months the Vita reddit has been buzzing with Nep too. Its good to see more of them taking notice of games other than P4.   I'm happy as well.  Nobody thought the series would blow up as big as it is today.  And P4 reminds me - I hope that IF/CH gets together with Arc System Works to make a Neptunia fighting game in the same way Atlus did (with ASW) for P4A.  P4A converted a few members of the FGC (Fighting Game Community) into JRPG fans - or so I've heard - and I'd love to see the same happen for Neptunia (plus I love fighting games too).  With music by Daisuke Ishiwatari to boot!  Oh wait, part of Mangolia Eclair (Ky Kiske's theme from Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN-) has already made its way into Neptunia VII's main battle theme, sooo......"
gamindustri,3e0t94,NautilusMain,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:45 2015 UTC,There's some fighting implementation in Action Unleashed but it's whether you are OP or OP AI. And white sister can even juggle opponent for a whole fight with no chance of retaliating. If they can thought how to rebalance those fight then it will be OK.
gamindustri,3e0t94,Rajaxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:17:53 2015 UTC,"There was actually an issue with this in DoA3 (cant seem to find footage of it) where certain characters would be able to almost infinitely juggle someone if you did not counter before the air hit occurred.   For the most part this has been fixed but it still somewhat exists in DoA5 (and DoA 4) with character switching which looks something like this. I think the newer level of juggeling is fine, but when you screw up a counter and never hit the floor (much like what you had described in Nep U) I dont think thats acceptable."
gamindustri,3e0t94,Craunva,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:46:45 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of a Nep fighting game would be great. I know pokemon is even getting some kind of fighting game (Pokken) and if Pokemon can making a fighting series work out then Nep should have no issues.  Not to mention that there is not a whole lot in terms of fighting games for the vita at the moment anyway so its a pretty good market. If we look at the anime based fighting games for Vita off the top of my head you have: BlazBlue, DoA5, Dengeki Bunko and J Stars as far as im aware. That leaves plenty of room for a new series.  My only hope (and I suppose its more of a personal wish than a universal one) is that if they DID make a Nep fighting game I hope:   The cast is large. I would like to see as many of the Nep characters as possible. Use NEW music. As much as I love the series they are in need of some new music. I would love to see some BGM akin to BlazBlue in the game. Fast gameplay. A really good example would be DoA4. This is part of the reason I didnt like DoA5, for me it felt really slow in comparison to DoA4 and DoA3. Admittedly im not the best at the slower fighters (MK,BlazBlue,Street Fighter) but for me the faster pacing made DoA4 really fun. Combine that with the counter system and you have a pretty sweet game.   That would be my bucket list for the game. Granted, im sure others have a different vision but hey, why not throw out some ideas."
gamindustri,3e0t94,T_GTX,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't mind it if it was BlazBlue with a Neptunia skin.  Or hell, even a crossover like the one I made a fan trailer for a year ago.   The cast is large. I would like to see as many of the Nep characters as possible.   It's damn large.  There's the 6 CPUs, 4 CPU Candidates, the 20 something Maker characters, the 15 or so characters that were in Hyperdevotion Noire, the Seven Sages, the NepU antagonist....it goes on and on.   Use NEW music. As much as I love the series they are in need of some new music. I would love to see some BGM akin to BlazBlue in the game.   Which is why I suggested Ishiwatari would write the music, as he also writes for BlazBlue and of course his own series, Guilty Gear.  Let's not forget that the Neptunia producer (her name escapes me) has always wanted to make a fighting game...."

The only reason I decided to bring that one up is because of how they handled Nep U. While Nep U is by no means a bad game, it would have been so much better with a larger cast than what they provided. It just seems like if its not a main game they either dont provide the slew of characters (NepU) or they make up an entire cast (Noire).   If they came out with a fighting game that managed to have all of the CPU's, Oracles, Makers, bosses etc. and they managed to make most of them feel different from one another then I would be more than happy. I just dont want it to possibly come down the pipe and Just have CPU's as playable characters. Especially in a genre that prides itself on having quite a large cast of characters."
gamindustri,3e0t94,theMrsupperscout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:13:52 2015 UTC,"My first was Rebirth 1.  Basically a few years back I saw the original game at Gamestop and I pointed it out to a friend and said it was basically the most weeb thing I had ever seen ever.  Fast forward to later I kept seeing gifs from the anime and I decided that it looked hilarious so I watched the anime.  Then I remembered that this anime was a game.  I couldn't get the originals on account of not having a PS3, but I did see they were remaking the first game, so I said why not.  I liked the anime enough to go buy a Vita and pick up the remake.  It was worth it."
gamindustri,3e0t94,gloveraran,2,Tue Jul 21 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely was Re;Birth1 for me of course.  What got me into the series wasn't the game itself, but it was actually the Animation. Back in like January, I was going through the front page of Anime Planet to see what it would recommend me, and Hyperdimension Neptunia came up. I thought the characters looked cute, liked the description for it, and then marked it as Want to Watch. I had planned to watch it at a much later date since I was originally in the middle of One Piece, and starting to watch different series.  Then comes February. I one day opened up the Steam Store to see what was on the front page, and I saw there was a game called Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 up on the Sales panel. I looked at it, thought it was interesting, then immediately after, I had said to myself ""Wait a second... This name seems really familiar... THERE'S GAMES FOR THIS!?""  So I decided to bump the Animation up into my next Anime to watch, despite all the bad reviews it had, loved it, fell in love with both Neptune and Blanc, and then bought Re;Birth1 and played it. Enjoyed the humorous dialogue from that, and it was also my first time jumping into the JRPG scene, unless you count Super Mario RPG and the Paper Mario series.  Here I am today. Got myself Re;Birth2 as well, bought a PS3, played all three games, and now waiting to buy a PS4 for Victory II."

The day RB1 came out on steam I saw it and just kinda stared at its steam page for half an hour deciding whether or not to buy it simply because NIS on steam (even though RB1 has nothing to do with NIS.) after a good long thinking session I decided that I should get it because it was half off but I figured I would play for an hour then keep it installed as a joke because none of my friends like anime stuff at all. 90 hours later I had every achievement, all the DLC, had played through it multiple times and my friends gave up on trying to save me from this weeb junk.  I got followed the games very closely after that and got RB2 as soon as it was on steam, and got my first job like a week before so a week after RB2 I got me a PSVITA so I could get more Nep and Disgaea, the summer job ended though so I have everything except Nep U and Disgaea 4"

RB1 essentially locked me into the series, so I ended up buying every Vita LE, and for some reason I even preordered Black Heart's 1/8th statue despite Blanc being my fav.

gamindustri,3e0t94,gianttabby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:05:46 2015 UTC,"My first game was Re;Birth1 on Steam, I had never heard of the series until the sale that happened in April. It's because I only owned a GameBoy, a Famicom, a PSone a Wii, and a 3DS, so I never bothered with Xbox/PS2+ titles, but I digress.  I had doubts as to whether or not I should buy the game. The first being that none of the people I knew in real life had every played the game. The second was that I thought it would be a fairly bare bones jRPG with a lot of fan service. I read the reviews on Steam and watched a few let's plays on YouTube. Despite its fan servicey look, it looked really appealing to me, and I got it at the end of the sale despite the possibility of being ""judged"" by my friends for playing this. I then downloaded it immediately and played it the moment it finished downloading.   I was instantly hooked. I instantly loved the Neppiverse to pieces. I loved the game's atmosphere, the dynamic characters, the awesome dialogue between the characters in the game, the battle mechanics and the pacing. I remember getting frustrated from being beat up so many times by Noire and having to grind, but I loved it. A week or two later, I read the announcement about Re;Birth2 and Re;Birth3 coming to Steam. I can't remember the last time I was so enthusiastic about a game series that I was actually excited for its launch. It didn't happen for Pokemon, and it sure didn't happen for Super Smash Bros. for 3DS (pretty much got those because everyone else I knew got it). I ""patiently"" waited for Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation to come out on Steam, finished that (really liked it despite there being wayy too many endings) and currently waiting for Re;Birth3: Generations.  TL;DR I started with Re;Birth1. I love the Neppiverse (err. Gamindustri)"

I remember getting frustrated from being beat up so many times by Noire    Ive heard this so many times over my time playing the games / helping others through the game and its great. Its almost like a collective story we can all share together.   I can't remember the last time I was so enthusiastic about a game series that I was actually excited for its launch.   Im still in this boat, which is partially why im so invested in the game and the community. They have successfully kept me hyped for their products and I havent been disappointed after the hype. ALOT of games nowdays cant say the same thing.   currently waiting for Re;Birth3: Generations.   Sorry you have to wait for such an amazing game. If its any consolation you get it at 60fps and multiple resolutions. Something about Nep for me is really invested in the Vita though. Its really justified my purchase of the system really.

Either Noire if you like SRPGs more or U if you like action games more (it's basically Senran Kagura with a coat of Nep paint), and then PP is the least impressive of the three. It's a very watered down idol sim (like THE iDOLM@STER). No minigames except for performances.  And to correct a misconception before you get disappointed, the performances in PP are not rhythm games."

If you want to have a start on an actual connecting story of the series in some way, I would say get Re;Birth2. I would recommend Re;Birth1, since you get to know the main cast (Blanc, Neptune, Noire and Vert) better through that, but Re;Birth1 is not PS TV Compatible.  Only downside to Re;Birth2, while it is a good game, is that it is a little more serious than the other HDN games, just like Mk2. Nepgear is also a decent character, but there are so many flaws with her compared to Neptune that ends up leaving a bad taste to those that play it (or they end up skipping it entirely, screwing themselves over by going directly to Re;Birth3 instead and don't want a proper Canon story.) In Mk2 / Re;Birth2 and the games after those ones, True Endings are always the Canon endings."

Its also worth noting that depending on how far you get into the anime, ALOT of it is spoilers for Re;Birth 3. I found that out the hard way when I watched it after finishing Re;Birth 2.  That being said, with RB1 not being offered for play on the PSTV I would recommend starting with Re;Birth 2. Regardless of how good or bad people think it is compared to the other Re;Birth games it is needed to give you some background to some of the dialogue you will experience if you do happen to pick up RB3.  Normally I would say to finish RB1 to give you a foundation to work with but since thats not possible with the PSTV I think RB2 is the next best option. Since youve seen the anime though you wont be missing out on much of the major information that the first game carries over to the second. You would just have to be sure to really read up on the remake system and shares systems work but that shouldnt be too difficult to wrap your head around as the games usually do a decent job at explaining things to you."

gamindustri,3dwjdm,Challos,0,Tue Jul 21 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"Rebirth 3 probably has the most 'challenging' gameplay, since I didn't even get close to burning items in 1 and 2 (without weaken enemies).  Honestly they all look the same, and play the same (except for RB3), the only question you really need to ask is what storyline you want.  For me, it goes Victory > 1 > sisters (or 3 > 1 > 2) in terms of storyline. The second is faaaaaar too serious, and it's the first game with a different storyline with the amount of models they reused.  Currently, you have four choices.  Just buy the first, see if you the series in the first place (make sure it's rebirth though, apparently the real first game is really shit). I recommend this the most.  Buy the second and third together, because the first one is an alternate timeline and has no bearing on the second and third.  Buy the third because it's the best in terms of gameplay and story, but you'll be missing out on some of the story by not playing the second.  Buy the first and third, skipping the second because it's probably the weakest entry out of the series.  Okay, you may have noticed I really don't like the second rebirth. It can be chalked up to many things, but in my eyes it just wasn't as charming as the others, or nearly good enough to bother buying unless you planned on buying the third.  However you didn't ask for a rant, so here's a tl;dr.  TL;DR: get the entire series if you can, and if you can't get 2 and 3. If that still is not an option, get three. 3 is by far my favorite.  Edit: just saw that you are planning on getting a PSTV. Well good luck, and be glad you didn't buy a vita. It also cannot play RB1, but you can get it on steam for ~$40, and there are a few sales going for it and the second as well.  Oh, small side comment. In terms of visual fan service, 2 is probably the worst. However in 3... well it gets interesting in the dialogue."

gamindustri,3dt4xp,Challos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:51 2015 UTC,"Just buy the Stella DLC. It makes every floor take 1 second and stops you from losing items. It's dumb, it's P2W, it's terrible you need it, but it's a dollar and it will save you so much grief."
gamindustri,3dt4xp,petalferrous,2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:34 2015 UTC,I wouldnt really call it pay to win to be fair. Yeah finishing the floors in 1 second is a nice perk but you dont HAVE to get it to progress anywhere in the game and for the most part the plans that stella drops are just icing on the cake (such as symbol attack gain which is located on floor 16).   This time around they also designed stella to be more user friendly in RB3 as well. You can actually get several perks that allow stella to come back without losing her gear. (There is one that allows you to retain gear and there is another where she will auto leave a dungeon if she is very low (sub 5%) health.)  I agree though that it is pay to advance. Meaning that you pay money to get things done faster than someone who didnt pay. Thats just a perk you have to decide if you are willing to pay for or if its something you care about. Luckily though its Compile Heart and the DLC isnt trying to price gouge us. At 99 cents its basically a steal for a completionist and is worth getting over the much slower times youll encounter at the higher floors.  I would 100% suggest getting the Stellas Dungeon DLC to save you the hassle (and the perk slots) but its by no means needed.

gamindustri,3drwmm,ChickenCake248,2,Sat Jul 18 23:03:54 2015 UTC,"Hi Sven. I recomend you to start by going through the Re;Birth games in order, skipping the originals. As far as I'm aware, they're better in every way and have almost identical stories to their counterparts. Then if you like them, you can go to the spin-offs."
gamindustri,3drwmm,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:04 2015 UTC,A friend of mine doesn't have a vita and wants to try to series but he has a PS3 would you say get the PS3 version of the first game so we could both at least try the games to see if we even like the series before investing in the vita versions?
gamindustri,3drwmm,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:29:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I didn't play the original, but judging by reviews it was a very bad game, with lots of issues like confusing mechanics and framerate drops, things which were fixed in the sequels and remakes. Mk.2 (the second) is better, but not very interesting IMO.  Victory (the 3rd game), however, is the latest one on PS3 and not very different than it's remake, so if you insist on using a PS3 I'd say to get it instead. Hope you enjoy the series :)"
gamindustri,3drwmm,Luminous083,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:07 2015 UTC,"I intend on getting the vita versions to play but the vita copies are pretty pricey and I can't do digital with my tiny memory card at this time, The ps3 copy is just to see if we enjoy the series as a whole"
gamindustri,3drwmm,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:19 2015 UTC,"I would look into a lets play of it or something. If the Vita versions are too expensive of an investment for you right now I wouldnt recommend you going out to buy the originals. I know a lets play doesnt really give you a personal feel for the game but it allows you to take a look at the game without having to put any kind of investment into it.   Another issue with going with the PS3 versions is that if you do end up liking that version you may not like the rebirth structure for the games as they are pretty different in almost every regard. Normally I would suggest watching the anime to get a better sense of the story as well but the back half has alot of spoilers from RB3 haphazardly connected to a story that didnt really touch most of the content of the other games. However, if spoilers are no real issue that is another good way to see if you would  However, I cant tell you how to spend your money. If you feel like MK1 is a sound investment then go for it. Personally though I waited for a big enough sale on RB1 to try it out. Since your memory card is not up to par though I would just recommend either waiting or going with another free method. Better than spending money on something you are not even sure if you would enjoy, especially when you could save for a little while and get the objectively better version of the same game.  Edit : Forgot to mention if you have a PS+ you could take advantage of the current sale going on for RB1 and RB2. While ive never used it, alot of people swear by the cloud storage that you get for having a PS+ membership. That might help with the memory card size issue? Im not too experienced on how that works though as I personally have a 16g card but its worth mentioning if you had not thought of that."
gamindustri,3drwmm,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:52 2015 UTC,Persona is one of those series where they make better versions later yet I am still able to go back to 3 FES from 4 Golden with out too much trouble and thats going from being able to control your whole party to only being able to control the main character. He is waiting on closer to his visit to get the game that way if we both don't enjoy it we can return it to my local gamestop and at least get some of the money back instead of buying a digital copy of a game and being out the money even if it is just 6 dollars with plus.
gamindustri,3drwmm,ginkaa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:05:11 2015 UTC,"The Persona series is awesome, but Neptunia is wildly different. A very rough comparison to Persona will be like:  Neptunia 1 & 2 are like Persona 1 & 2: Very different from the sequels.   3 Is comparable to Persona 3 as in that it laid the current foundation to the series.  The Re;Birth versions are equilvalent to P4 Golden, as in that they're portable and vastly improved."

gamindustri,3drwmm,T_GTX,2,Sat Jul 18 22:19:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what everyone else has said. Starting with the Re;Birth games would be your best bet. Its pretty easy to see when you look at them side by side why the Re;Birth series saved the games itself.    The combat is better by a million years The animations are better The game is much more fluid The grinds are nowhere near as bad (but still annoying at times, looking at you lily ranks.)   Overall, I think youll have a much better experience through the Re;Birth series than you would the originals. This is especially true if its your first jump in (There are alot of die hard fans that even have a hard time recommending the originals.)"

Like you could choose which nation to live in (Planeptune,Lowee,Lastation or Leanbox) and that would act somewhat like a faction.   You could have fights similar to raids with bosses like Arfoire or the Seven Sages or any of the numerous boss battles in the games.  Quests are simple enough to make, even something like the ones they have in game already would work.  I think one of the biggest issues they would have is more the design aspects more than anything. Do they want to use the Holy Trinity (Tank/Heal/Dps) or do they go for a more fluid style like GW2 where the trinity is not used? How would combat work? If they forwent the trinity you wouldnt really need to design tanks or healers and it would be easier to keep the nep style of play but the content would be alot easier than it could be if you had the trinity.  The biggest issue they would have is shares. What would they do? it would need to be something meaningful yet not overpowered (assuming one ""nation"" has more players than another). I think making that work in a way that doesnt seem tacked on would be the hardest part."
gamindustri,3do0ka,Luminous083,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"You know, they could try a beta and experiment with the various systems. See what works and what doesn't. They can also make that shares are relative to the population, to balance things out. Maybe there can be unique rewards to each nation's quests, encouraging players to pick a side at each major event, and depending on personal performance award them accordingly.   I think the creation of such a game, although hard to make, and especially if it will be free to play (bleh), will give Neptunia even more popularity, and if done well, give a major boost to the franchise."
gamindustri,3do0ka,mabinight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"I think another hurdle they would have to jump is that MMO's are quite expensive and time consuming to create. Assuming they got the game set up in a way they would like you still have to deal with patching the content, adding more content to the game,game/login servers and continual balance changes. All of that along with the fact that MMO's are somewhat on a downturn for the past few years.  I think Neptunia is slowly getting its time in the limelight though. I think when I joined the reddit (This subreddit was why I made an account at all) it had less than 600 people and now we are quickly approaching 1200. The community even outside of the reddit is pretty massive compared to the Nep1 and Mk2 days. Nep1 being on sale this week seems to be bringing quite a few people to the game as well.  Overall, I think it would be really amazing for them to churn out an MMO with the quality of something like FFXIV / SWTOR / Pre-WoD WoW but at the current moment it seems to be a large project to undertake. That being said we didnt take 5 minutes to get a basic idea for how it could work out, imagine what someone whos being paid to make it could come up with."
gamindustri,3do0ka,ginginator901,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain that if the games will keep selling well, the release of such a game is eventually bound to happen. There was already a mobile card game based on the series in Japan. Not sure how popular it is, but it's still proof a social Neptunia game could work."

Who knows, maybe Stella's dungeon is actually an experiment to see if time based gameplay should be implemented in a future, online installment."

I don't own a Vita myself, nor am I interested in Strategy RPGs, so I can't give you my thoughts on it unfortunately."
gamindustri,3dobjg,Tjoeb123,2,Sat Jul 18 01:26:46 2015 UTC,Oh I'm still here!  I've just been busy getting the platinum for Re;birth3.
gamindustri,3dobjg,Tjoeb123,2,Sat Jul 18 02:28:56 2015 UTC,"Well, /u/Rajaxx has summoned me, so...  It's a simple SRPG, much like Fire Emblem or something.  You get to move all your characters in a single turn, lift them, attack, the whole 9 yards.  Some of the stage layouts have puzzle elements to them, where you, for example, might have to have a character stay on a switch to form a bridge while all of your other characters go across or something. I like this because it adds a bit of depth to the fields.  Hyperdevotion Noire easily has the largest roster in the series.  Besides the CPUs, there's Resta who casts magic, Lee-Fi who is a fighter, Tsunemi who's a singer (yes, a singer), Tiara from Fairy Fencer F as DLC, and too many more to list here. Like the makers in the main series, all of them are callbacks to other franchises or even genres.  Sadly, the non-Histoire oracles and CPU Candidates (Kei and and Uni especially, since this is Noire's game after all) are nowhere to be found.  If there's 3 things I don't like, it's 1. The English voices aren't loud enough even at max volume in-game and on the Vita itself, 2. The voice actors don't change when the CPUs transform during story events, and 3. I love most of the CGs but none of them feature Black Heart specifically.  Oh, and 4. Some of the later battles can really drag on.  For example there's one battle where you have to form a staircase and climb up to get to the enemy forces.  One of the boxes is out of most characters' reach, so if you don't bring someone who can get across no problem, you basically have to restart.  Aaand 5. Music being recycled from the main series and inserted where they don't fit, like Soild Park from Re;birth2 being used as the briefing theme.  But don't let those nitpicks get to you.  It's still a good game!  Did I also mention that there's a mode where you can fill Noire's requests from Lastation's citizens?  Or even redecorate her Basilicom?"

Its been discussed a few times here and its the general consensus that in the end it was good for the series. They were able to look at the responses they got from it originally and took note that alot of people like the goofy/fun stories with threats that are difficult to overcome but dont result in massive changes in the tone of the game. In the end its also just an extra ending. So even if it had been a massive failure or success they were saved by the fact that it was one of many endings you had to choose from at the time."

All of them except Gear were mechanically fine, so I'm going to just comment on balance and maybe correct wording.  IF: Should cost 8 or 9.  She's extremely strong for her cost.  Compare to Al'akir, who does a similar thing but is class specific.  Seems very fun though.  Compa: Perfectly fine.  Seems like a useful effect, especially when combined with White Heart.  Neptune: Fine.  Purple Heart: 6/6 for 5 is obscene.  I would make it like a 5/5 for 5 that gets stats if you have a CPU in your hand.  Legendaries should all have effects.  Noire: Fun fact: If a minion is immune and they have Taunt, the enemy can attack over the taunt.  Make Noire a 4/5, make her effect say immune, and she's fine.  Black Heart: Enemy MINIONS.  Fixed.  Blanc: Kinda odd how normal Blanc has higher attack than CPU Blanc.  Bring down the attack and she'll be a really fun to use card that will probably be used in every deck.  White Heart: Seems fine to me.  Vert: Love this card.  Very powerful effect that will probably win you the game on the spot.  Green Heart: Seems fine.  Not very strong, but fine.  Nepgear: Overly complex effect that gives you no reason to ever play her.  Psst.  Nepgear likes robots and machines and stuff.  Do stuff with that.  Uni: Make her a 2/3.

gamindustri,3djxn9,greatfinn,3,Fri Jul 17 01:47:37 2015 UTC,Vert is balanced because she dies to Dr. Balanced.  At least she dies to Dr. Balanced when I play her cause never lucky.

gamindustri,3djxn9,NautilusMain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:58:21 2015 UTC,"I had a really hard time balancing the mana cost for Ram and Rom. Like Stalagg Feugen, you have to play both to really get any effect. Both are alright alone (Rom is like a spider tank and Feugen is good HP for the cost too), but when both are done, it's much more powerful (free 11/11). I figured the bonus stats were worth less than Thaddius, but 3 mana is actually a stupid idea. Maybe 4 mana for both since they have to be on the board at the same time?"
gamindustri,3djxn9,greatfinn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:32:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is Stalagg and Feugen are pretty bad without the effect (4/7 or 7/4 for 5 mana) and if you silence the second one, it just becomes useless  Rom and Ram have great vanilla stats (3/4 or 4/3 for 3 mana) and the silence only affects the one being silenced. If you silence Ram, she won't get the boost, but she's still Ram, so Rom still gets the boost. I think 4 mana is fair"
gamindustri,3djxn9,silverhydra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:28:41 2015 UTC,"She's balanced until you play her alongside double brewmasters and never keep her on the field, just a reusable 9-cost ""kill everything"" one-card combo.  Granted it's not like a meta of CPUs exist so maybe she can get cuntblocked by other CPUs or something; whatever... at least she's not pre-nerf undertaker OP."
gamindustri,3djxn9,NautilusMain,2,Fri Jul 17 02:01:44 2015 UTC,"A Rogue deck running Vert, 2 Gang Up, 2 Shadowstep, 2 Vanish, and 2 Antique Healbots.  That wins through fatigue.  Have fun."

I probably think that because I got into the nep series by playing Rebirth 2, and IF is one of the first characters you see. She's also really badass. Also, that chirper event where IF starts to cry because someone broke her phone's screen is the best thing ever."

I played Re;Birth 1 and 2 on the pc, then got the third on PS Vita. On my gaming computer, I run the game at 60 fps no problem, so that made the stuttering frame rate on the Vita seem dizzying at times. This would happen when special effects appeared when attacking, and the fps would drop to somewhere around 5-10 (at least that's what it looked like)."
gamindustri,3dk07r,ChickenCake248,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:42 2015 UTC,i also relate to 5bp a lot because of that but Red became my favourite because of her constant amount of waifu baiting and obsession made me laugh a lot.

gamindustri,3dk07r,Luminous083,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:17 2015 UTC,"Most of the hitbox issues youll eventually get used to after playing long enough, if not because you are experienced it will be because alot of the models get reused which means youll just be accustomed to how big their boxes actually are.   As for who my favorite non-CPU is id have to pick either MAGES. or CC2. Mostly because I have a thing for tan chicks, daggers and food., all of which CC2 enjoys. As for MAGES. she does the whole chuunibyou thing (like IF) and does it in a way that doesnt come off as annoying or forced. Not to mention Dr. Pepper is pretty amazing."

Iffy legit seems like the straightman and even if she, alone, isn't the best character she has a vital role in the overall environment.  Things Fixed Question  Make stuff harder post game, seriously. I intentionally underlevel myself so fights end up being a tough 10 minutes of strategy and I enjoy myself but as soon as I get end-game equipment it's all worth nothing and everything becomes easy. I know it's possible to make hard bosses because 'Forest God' in the Colliseum for Re;birth1 was a fucking spectacular fight that took me two days prep and 30 minutes of fighting, so why can't I have those delicious hard fights in other games?  This game caters to people who are likely to grind for end-game stuff, and caters to people who like difficult fights; so why, when those two conditions meet, does everything because easy as hell? Just doesn't make sense to me. I want some unbeatable endgame God-like entity that takes 2 hours of fighting so I can brag about my triumph!"

Go to a changed Powerlevel Island, symbol attack the Cerberus (the blue dog tough enemy) or to a changed Septent Resort and fight the symbol attack the Volcano Turtle. Both give about 12.6 million EXP.   The enemies ranked at level 399 and 699 in the colosseum give between 71 and 83 million, and the level 999 fights give like, 150 million+, but I didn't even fight those until all my party members were 999."

After the first Newgame +, there are some new Chirpers you need to get in order to unlock new content or get more memory.

gamindustri,3dl7q2,silverhydra,3,Fri Jul 17 08:26:58 2015 UTC,In fact.  Just pretend the game costs 1 more dollar than it actually does because this DLC may as well be mandatory for the sake of your sanity.

gamindustri,3dfvrq,Villag3Idiot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:46:43 2015 UTC,Sucks. I thought senran was shallow.   Is the game split into a bunch of very small areas like senran or is it bigger maps like warriors.

gamindustri,3dfvrq,Villag3Idiot,2,Thu Jul 16 00:59:34 2015 UTC,"I would suggest getting it if you are into Neptunia. Alot of the gameplay is pretty easy and youll pretty much have no issues getting most of the trophies (as usual the lily grind is stupidly long and imo not worth the time.)   Is it better than SK:SV? Definite maybe. The storyline is pretty barebones compared to SK where each academy has a story and each individual character also has a story. NepNep has a singular story that could be described as ""ehh"". The game hooked me for a few days and I enjoyed quite abit of my time playing it, but, the playtime was nowhere as long as SK:SV.  So while the story is not as good as SK imo, the gameplay is really solid and it feels really fun to slash people up as your favorite CPU character."

gamindustri,3dfrki,gametempest,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:12 2015 UTC,I've beaten the game and found it to be very fun. It is a simple srpg nothing that will make you lose your mind due to difficulty. It has the same lovable dialogues in between characters that we all enjoy. From what I have seen most of the bad rep came from Japanese fans. It seems that they did not like the fact that Noire was getting a love interest.
gamindustri,3dfrki,Blazephantom,2,Thu Jul 16 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"difficulty is a bit harder than the RPG ones, even if u overlevel the enemies they still hit hard. The story is good, full of comedy and you can notice some characters trademarks from their game representation with exception the endings not really satisfying for me. One final note, this game is really tough if u attempt for platinum trophy(40 hours+ of grinding)"

gamindustri,3dfrki,Cater0mcf,2,Thu Jul 16 02:39:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of tactical games, growing up on Advance wars and Fire Emblem, which is quite close to this type of game. Noire's game kinda fails in terms of gameplay, one of the main thing about tactical games is preparation, it's really hard to look around on the map in the settings part, hard to check the stats of your opponents, you can't check what kind of abilities they have or the range on them. There are natural hazards that only target you, you don't know what they do or where they can hit you, you get 0 info on those.  Generally moving around is tedious, your characters don't follow your cursor, they try to walk in the simplest L shape they can(this means you can only turn once in your movements unless you are blocked by something, for some reason you can turn multiple times then). Even as simple thing as moving directly left or right is tedious, since you can't do that, you have to press square, rotate your character into the direction your wish to move, confirm, then move.  Plus you have this level elements on the field, where not everything is on the same height. It's cool at first since if you are higher, you deal more damage and take less, but later on when you have to move around, you take damage if you fall off from a height your character can't jump(you don't take damage if you jump on a character, for some reason this is never mentioned to you). Plus later you have to build stairs from platforms to be able to continue, it takes a lot of time, really tedious and you get shit on by anything that's on the top. In one of the later mission, I spent 30 turns just building shit up, since the game won't give you enough materials, you have to half build it, climb up with 1 character, take it apart, build it again.  All in all, it's really only for fans, even tho, I'm a huge fan of TRPGs, I had to take breaks every 3 hours, the gameplay gets boring, the story is really slow. The enjoyment you have is the Neptunia comedy and the elements you recognize from the main series implemented into this game."

gamindustri,3df1pj,Weeaboo69,9,Wed Jul 15 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in a love hate relationship with these guys. On one hand fuck them but on the other hand at least the battles are sometimes unwinnable if you can't keep DPS up and keep the game challenging (also forcing you to sustain some DPS) rather than spamming resurrection items and gradually killing the boss.  Battles which force you to use an EXE skill at least once every third turn, sustain healing, and make sure everybody has no status ailments and is high on SP are fun. :)"
gamindustri,3df1pj,silverhydra,4,Wed Jul 15 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"It just becomes tedious as hell. The defense on all my front-lines are pretty high, and the boss heals 90% of the damage I mitigate on average. So I'm just button spamming for like ten minutes."
gamindustri,3df1pj,MakutaArguilleres,5,Thu Jul 16 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"True, but I prefer the tedious fights over the other ones. I like knowing how much they heal and keeping tabs of how much sustain I need to apply to them; gives me a bit of wiggle room but otherwise is difficult (especially if underleveled).  Better than the bosses who don't heal. You just surround them in a plus sign and keep some distance while you have two people attack, one person ressurect the meatshield, and have Rom die repeatedly because it seems bosses hate her the mostest. You could be 10+ levels under what is ideal and still win that fight with monotony.  I mean, the only bosses that don't heal that are actually difficult or even challenging are the dragons who have the signature 'dragon raid' move with an area-of-effect of ""yes"" and damages for ""fuck you"".  So different strokes for different folks; I see what you mean about it being tedious but I prefer my fights tedious rather than simplistic."

gamindustri,3df1pj,MakutaArguilleres,2,Thu Jul 16 03:01:30 2015 UTC,It sort of reminds me of late pokemon gym leaders and elite 4 where if you cant 1 or 2-shot everything theyll just spam potions and protect for the rest of the fight and it's a stalemate unless you run out of healing items or revives yourself or you get a lucky crit. I can't decide whether that's a good or a bad thing.

gamindustri,3dajg5,Weeaboo69,4,Tue Jul 14 19:49:07 2015 UTC,"View pretty much every Chirper conversation, then save before the boss fight in Chapter 5 (it'll be an Event at Planeptune).  This will split off towards the Conquest/Holy Sword and Normal/True Endings. (you'll want to save in separate slots for each ending at this point)  If you go into Chapter 6, you pretty much only have one boss fight.  If you want the True Ending, then meet the requirements for that and save in its own slot."
gamindustri,3dajg5,Tjoeb123,3,Tue Jul 14 20:43:32 2015 UTC,This should give you an idea of when the endings branch off from each other:  http://i.imgur.com/Sy53ck7.jpg
gamindustri,3dajg5,RadiantViper,2,Tue Jul 14 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"You should run it multiple times, but you don't need one playthrough for each ending. Trying to do all endings in one playthrough will actually make it more complicated than it needs to be. Though you will probably want to do it for the cities unless there's something those endings give you that carry into another playthrough, they are more or less the same ending.  Since you're on chapter 2, make sure that you've gotten at least 15 shares in each nation besides Planeptune and viewed the chirper scenes talking about a cursed sword. Then in chapter 4, get 30 shares in each nation ( except planeptune and not all at once) and unlock the makers. Then in chapter 5, get 50 in each nation to unlock each CPU (except Planeptune). Then after Lan Castle there will be an event in Planeptune. This is the point of no return where you will get locked into an ending's route. Try to meet requirements before this point which are all the chirpers, non-oracle characters unlocked and below lily rank 8, and planeptune above 55 shares but lower than 75.   When you get to gamindustri graveyard, make certain you get a plan called ""destroy symbol gains"" from the ""God of Woe"" which appears with add enemies. Also kill the other enemy called ""Rival Craft"" I think since IIRC he drops necessary materials for break damage limit. Also, at the end of the Graveyard depths, you can get past the crystal in the far back by sticking to the right to kill the turtle boss and try to complete the plans I mentioned before finishing the game.  Repeat this with your second playthrough. Recruit them when you need them after making an extra save at Lan Castle. When you get to Lan Castle, start doing laps and making use of that ""Destroy symbols gain"" to power-lily everyone up through the roof like Nepgear on Vert in the anime or at least rank 8. This will save you a lot of time than you would have just reverting to an old save for Holy Sword after doing conquest. Not to mention the symbol gains will help with moving shares as well since what the plan does is instantly end a battle after a symbol attack but you still get rewards.  After doing Holy Sword, do a third playthrough. Do the same thing again but don't recruit the CPUs in chapter 5 right away.  Now run to Lan Castle again and save then do Human ending which requires all makers at lily rank 5+ and avoid the Planeptune ending requirement and recruiting the other CPUs or getting cursed sword chirpers when working up to this point. Then once that's done, revert back to chapter 5 refer to the part where I talked about the city endings and do those. Revert again, then just meet the requirements for true ending (there are dungeons exclusive to this route). Once you're in chapter 6, get to 75 in each nation for the oracles which again, symbol gains and you'll have extra memory from previous playthroughs. Colosseum is nice but it doesn't move ALL the shares.  Once you're in the final chapter, you can effectively 100% the game given that there isn't any items you need to carry over from the final boss. If you happen to not have enough memory for something you need, you can always just do another speed run.  Sorry for the long post. This should take 3 playthroughs. The oracles are completely unnecessary for the endings but are necessary for completion. If you find yourself lacking memory but don't want to do another playthrough, save before unlocking them then revert. That way you still get their achievements/trophies.   Forgot Human ending. Just don't get CPUs right away and instead save where I told you and do the requirements for that before doing true route. Many brainfarts were had while writing this especially after forgetting an ending. Sorry for all the edits."

gamindustri,3d9n1k,Kitsunedon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"What is this? How do I forget this ever happened? This is self insert fanfic of the worst kind. Did she just suddenly become a goddess for the reason that ""I want to be better than these other characters and I just want to feel important.""  Perhaps my biggest gripe is the fact that the reaction to ending up in Gamindustri is completely unrealistic (I'm judging realism in a fanfic, I know.) and they just shrug it off like they've had a ride to school. I for one would freak out if I was warped to Gamindustri whether I was familiar with it or not. It's a completely different dimension and everything I knew and loved would be back home and unreachable. None of this makes sense and it irritates me more than it reasonably should."

gamindustri,3d6jas,K_Uzume,3,Tue Jul 14 00:33:42 2015 UTC,"That was changed a few months ago. You don't need a Proxy to connect any more, since their new Route finally reached most ISPs by now. SEGA didn't kick any one off either. It's just that when the DDoS happened last June, they had to switch their routing, and most ISPs did not get the new routing to it, if that makes sense.  SEA is still locked out though unless you get a Proxy, obviously since PSO2 SEA exists."

gamindustri,3d6jas,Zilveari,-6,Tue Jul 14 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"No, I said fuck it and fuck them.  They said it would be released in the west, then they just ignored us for the past 2 or 3 years, and then basically said that they were never going to release it here when they released IP blocks from the Japanese servers.    They pissed me right the fuck off and I refuse to give them any money for it."
gamindustri,3d6q66,Craunva,6,Mon Jul 13 23:20:46 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm missing something, we've gotten every other game localized. So I say there is nothing to fear, just be patient lol. I believe the game just recently came out in Japan."

I seem to have gotten my answer, thanks pals. except whoever downvoted me because that hurt my feelings"
gamindustri,3d6q66,Luminous083,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:09:14 2015 UTC,I will give you an upvote to unhurt your feelings. Being downvoted for legitimate questions is really odd. Especially for this subreddit.

It was fine before, but we've been getting a lot of people from Steam who seem to think it's okay to downvote content here or legitimate opinions (like one I posted in a thread a few days ago that I removed because I shouldn't be getting downvoted for some thing that's true lol.)"
gamindustri,3d6q66,MAGESdot,2,Tue Jul 14 05:01:42 2015 UTC,"No release date announcement yet. But it's going to happen, I'm sure of it. The Nep fanbase outside outside of Japan is larger than in Japan after all so no reason for IF not to localize it."
gamindustri,3d6q66,Tjoeb123,2,Tue Jul 14 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"I want Nep VII as much as anyone else but I honestly think they need to put the brakes on putting out any more Neptunia games for now.  We already got 4 games (plus Omega Quintet) and the anime series within the 1st half of the year; that's quite a bit of Nep-Nepping for the time being (unless you're waiting for the Steam version of Re;birth3).  Plus, between Amnesia and the Steam versions of Fairy Fencer F and Re;birth3 (all slated for release this Fall), I think they have their hands full for now."

Of course, we all know its very likely itll recieve a localization. Its just a matter of when.

gamindustri,3d6q66,Blazephantom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:37:02 2015 UTC,It's gonna happen. It just takes time for licensing to go through. IFI will announce it when they have secured whatever rights they need to get.

gamindustri,3d4adp,SupaStaVince,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:43:09 2015 UTC,Already did the conquest ending. What does the symbol gains plan do ? And what do you mean I did myself a favor ?
gamindustri,3d4adp,SupaStaVince,2,Tue Jul 14 11:50:50 2015 UTC,"Symbols gains basically makes it so that when you use a symbol attack with ""destroy symbols"" instead of the enemy just popping out of existence, it starts the battle but all the enemies are already dead giving you credit for beating them which is also handy when farming for shares, lily rank, or drops.  When I said if you didn't do conquest already, I assumed you went for Holy Sword first which would have made it impossible to get the conquest ending."
gamindustri,3d3v5w,sealewowsuchamaze,2,Mon Jul 13 08:44:26 2015 UTC,It was a nice breath of fresh air that I'm glad exists but will never do again. Good to see the series can be serious every once in a while.  Also got a lot of sweet equipment as well from that route.

gamindustri,3d2b1z,supernaga,4,Sun Jul 12 23:18:46 2015 UTC,As a independent game for mobile? Yes. If I could choose what character to send out from the franchise? Even more so.

gamindustri,3d2b1z,stealthcl0wn,3,Sun Jul 12 23:22:10 2015 UTC,This will create IF syndrome(playing phone while walking in public)! Cool idea though
gamindustri,3d2b1z,mikhdrag,3,Mon Jul 13 03:38:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit too basic to be a standalone game, in it's current form, but with a few tweaks like control in battles or the like it could be awesome."
gamindustri,3d2b1z,Shinjiro_Aragaki,2,Mon Jul 13 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"It would need some tweaks, I don't think it would get very popular with just picking a floor and pressing go"
gamindustri,3d2b1z,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:49:56 2015 UTC,"When I think about it, a port of the rebirth games on Android and IOS is actually feasible, mainly because a dev called Hyperdevbox which works with Idea Factroy has released Agarest War and it's prequel on the platforms and they play and sell pretty well. Who knows, maybe they'll plan to release the Nep games after 2 or something?"
gamindustri,3d2b1z,qchto,2,Mon Jul 13 05:01:55 2015 UTC,"well, if it worked in the same way but had the capability to sync collected items with the main game it would be more than enough to make me pay for it.. (but no more than 5 dollars, of course)"
gamindustri,3d2b1z,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:55:12 2015 UTC,"Well, if the port would come into fruition, I predict it would run at relatively low graphic settings, probably have platform exclusive cloud saving, and would cost about 15 (or less with dreadful IAPs) bucks. If they'll polish the touch controls and add some extra content such as Stella's dungeon for the first re;birth, it might turn out to be pretty awesome, especially for newcomers."

gamindustri,3cz8m2,Challos,4,Sun Jul 12 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"Buffs and debuffs don't stack.  You get the candidates by making progress in the story.  Yeah, they do, you need 15% in Leanbox, Lastation and Lowee to view their chirper events for the conquest route. Need 30% or more shares in Leanbox, Lastation and Lowee to unlock that city's maker character from chapter 4 and onwards. Need 50% or more shares in these 3 to unlock the CPU of the city. And of course most endings of not all of them require you to have a certain amount of shares.  Naturally, you should play it without DLC gear since it's way too op. Should be using Stella's insurance and fast dungeons crawling for sanity reasons.  Anime is cool, should be watching it."
gamindustri,3cz8m2,Cater0mcf,2,Sun Jul 12 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"I can only answer the Animation question since I have not played through Re;Birth2 yet (I've played Mk2 but there's a lot of new stuff in Re;Birth2 so...)  The Animation, like the Games, happens in its own Dimension. It spoils a tiny bit of Mk2 / Re;Birth2, which is the CPUs being Captured, as you already find out when you first start playing Mk2 / Re;Birth2, but it mainly spoils stuff from Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, along with who the real mastermind in the later episodes is (who is also Good Ending's Boss and True Ending's Final Boss in Victory.)  As far as the other CPU Candidates in Re;Birth2 goes (I don't know how far into the game you are,) you will get them to join your party later on as you progress through the story, since it works the same way as Mk2."
gamindustri,3cz8m2,Rajaxx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"I never played mk2, but I'm confused. Beating them does NOT stop them from allowing me to enter my party?  Edit:  I need to read harder. Never mind."
gamindustri,3cz8m2,Rajaxx,2,Sun Jul 12 03:40:07 2015 UTC,"I don't even think you can choose to lose to them in you want. Think it's a Game Over. I wouldn't know since I always beat them when I encountered them each time.  But no, defeating them during the Story does not stop you from getting them. They join the party when you get far enough into the Story.   Also, as far as how you should go about playing Re;Birth2 the first time, I personally think it's better that you do a Playthrough of it once without all the DLC, then see whether you want to use it or not next time. Re;Birth1's DLC was okay since I wasn't concerned about Plutia and Peashy making Chapter 2 - 5 a joke after I beat it many times, but Re;Birth2 has a lot more stuff that gives Nepgear (and I assume other Party Members) a major advantage in the form of an EXP Boost plan, along with Nepgear's stupidly OP Swords.  With Shares, you will need to get them to a certain point before either the end of Chapter 2 or 3 in order to view the Cursed Sword events (If you are going for Conquest Ending, or Holy Sword Ending,) along with meeting their Ending requirements, and you need Shares to get the CPUs (after you rescue them) and the Oracles/Makers (Oracles aren't necessary for the Endings.) There's a bunch of Share stuff you would need to do in the game to get 8 of the 9 Endings pretty much.  Heh. You must have edited while I was finishing up the post XD"

It's one of those Animations where it doesn't have a clear set story. Just about every episode is pretty much random non-sense until Episodes 3 - 5 and then 6 - 10. It's one of those series that you kinda just watch before you invest into a larger series, per say.  Most anime sites (just like review sites for the games) have rated poorly. I can't give you a clear response as a result because unlike the people that let all the jokes and parodying and whatnot fly over their head, I liked the Animation and to me, it's a 10/10, even if it has its flaws.  If you like the Games, you'll like the Animation. I popped into your stream a couple times before (and was wondering why you had Voice Volume off,) until at one point I heard you had English voices on (I'm not a Dub person when it comes to Anime / JRPGs personally,) but if you like how the Dialogue is in the Game, I would recommend you watch the Commie Subs version of Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation, since it stays true to the Dialogue style in the games.

gamindustri,3cz8m2,MegamanZen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:51:15 2015 UTC,"Length: 12 Episodes, with a 13th OVA Episode. Episode 12 is essentially the Normal Ending, while the 13th OVA Episode is the True Ending, because at the end of Episode 10, some stuff happens, and Episode 13 remedies some of that (Hard to explain and not spoil.)  Rating Wise: It doesn't make sense at all, but people that usually review on those sites have high standards when it comes to Anime, or they dislike any thing Moe related (but still watch it for who knows what reason.) If you were watching the Series without having any knowledge of the Games, I could understand why people would be confused with how it progresses, or don't like that it takes Jabs at every thing, Fan Service included (there's a good amount of it in the Animation, just like in the Games.)  Commie Subs version here. Animejoy used to have the Animax sub version of Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation back in January / February, but now they replaced it with Funimation's Dubbed version. While the Videos for Commie Subs are high quality (720p or 1080p if you want,) the main downside is that you have to Torrent them. That's not a problem for most people to torrent all 12 Episodes and then the 13th Episode, but i'm sure people out there disagree with the notion of doing it. You have to worry about there being Seeders as well (I had a hell of a time trying to get the OVA Episode torrented, and took a lot longer than expected as a result.)  You would have to ask the others in this Subreddit, if they post here, about if there's a Channel or whatnot on Youtube that has the Commie Subs version of it uploaded if you can't Torrent.  And like I mentioned before, I only briefly popped in, like not even for more than 10 seconds both times, so I couldn't tell you. The moment I hear Dubbed voices for any Japanese game, I don't stay around, but that's just me. Pretty much: Just do you. If you're Streaming for fun and not looking to get Partnered or a Subscription Button on your channel one day, do what you want. There's people that will watch full playthroughs of games with or without Commentary. Since I have no motivation myself to get a sub button due to past incidents on Twitch from Channels / Viewers I used to watch, I myself just go for Playthroughs without Commentary, because there's always a crowd who wants to watch a Game without any commentary.  Speaking of Stream Playthroughs, I need to hit up the Subreddit Mods about some thing I am planning as well when it gets closer to the time."

gamindustri,3cz8m2,Shinjiro_Aragaki,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:12:11 2015 UTC,I can understand why you would feel that way. Torrenting is essentially like Emulating video games: It walks a very thin grey line on what is and is not considered legal. I'm sure some one here will be able to supply you with a Link to the Subs elsewhere without having to Torrent.

gamindustri,3cue0k,stealthcl0wn,6,Fri Jul 10 21:24:46 2015 UTC,Short answer is no sadly. I have only completed 6 large scale watercolor pieces like this over the past 5 years. I enjoy making them for myself as a tribute to characters that I like but I would not want to be forced to finish one. There was a two week gap between the line art and coloring stages of this picture alone.  If I ever decide to do commission work it would probably be at a smaller scale so that I could get the finished product out in <1 month without feeling overwhelmed or rushing the process.

I tried to upload more WIP pictures like last time but imgur hates me right now so I'll have to try again another time.  I'll try to take better shots of both once I find frames to put them both in. The coloring only took two days this time and was much easier to finish than Plutia was; I still think Plutia turned out better overall though. Some of the colors that I ended up with while working on this were either too washed out or over-saturated but it could have been worse.

EDIT: We are long past the point of no return. Does Noire really think that because you humiliateed Plutia that she's going to give up? You think that a painful IF stackwipe means that she's going to concede defeat? Because that is wrong. If we wanted revenge before, now we are going to be fucking fanatic about it. The price of a war must be paid, too many CPU lives have been lost. The price must be paid by the one, that started the war in the thirties.  I am fully expecting Plutia to return home, encite zealous revenge speech, and rally her entire nation to war. She also still has, what, 3? 4? CPU crystal things left. It isn't right morally,  but Plutia is going to come back for vengence with a full on army and a half dozen ish cpus, to scorch and salt Lastation until it is a desert, then call it peace. Gehaburn or not, Noire is dead. She can beat 1 cpu, maybe 2 or 3. But 4 or 5? And the entire mass of corpses from planeptune ultradimension physically smothering the   Land of lastation?  We are at the point where Plutia would be willing to throw away everything to win, and will win but lose everything that she was.   As an eu4 player, there has never been a time where I have not gotten vengence on any ai that has wronged me. When France decided that it wanted a free bullshit event pu over my shitty little Italian country called Naples, and then beat me up quite a bit and won the first war taking a few provinces, I didn't rage quit. Instead, I gave up every fucking thing that defined my sicilian, catholic country to win. I culture shifted to germanic prussian. I religious converted to reformed. I formed Prussia instead of italy. I destroyed france and ensured that every last french culture group province was eradicated from the face of the earth.  However, ironically, my campaign was brought to an end when Sicilian patriots revolted and killed me. But I didn't care. I had my revenge.  For a real life example, take the Soviet union. The entire eastern front was a massive pyhrric victory. The land was scorched, the industry ruined, the people massacred and women and children were raped at the hands of the nazis. Yet they had their revenge. You can find plenty of sources of the red army's rape through eastern germany. Today, stettin, Berlin's historic port city, IS POLISH because of the red army. The soviets were utterly ruined internally from the war. They had lost anything they once stod for. But they had their revenge on the Teutonic aggressors.  If plutia drops out of the story, I will be disappoint"

Plus Uzume isn't out of the story completely.  Plus there are roughly seven chapters left to go, and Neptunia's cast is diverse and dimensions many  Who knows, maybe Hyperdevotion might appear."

Just sitting in front of the computer with a small candle lit, my back hurts, I can barely move at all and  I'm starving. It's not fun, but it's strangely relaxing.

The people that call themselves patriots would never actually fight for the country nowadays - they would rather attack people of other religions and sexualities. There was a big rainbow made out of flowers in a place in warsaw - the ""patriots"" burned it down because they thought it was meant to show tolerance for homosexuals. It was built because warsaw is very grey and they wanted to add color. A year later it was rebuilt only to be burned down again..  But you are right. The food is not the only good thing.

It happened to Ireland (Catholic Stronkhold), and it happened to the USA (south is evangelical protestant stronkhold). Without John Paul II, Poles will slowly drift towards france / UK / Scandinavia.

I was just a child, playing with bionicle and drawing, making silly animations and playing video games in my room. My family was doing something I guess americans would call a BBQ. Upon hearing the voice of my mother, I come downstairs then into the garden where said BBQ was being hosted. Now, I take my usual kiełbasa and various other meats and my mom... she shows me this weird flat piece of vegetable in the colors of a Wiz Khalifa song. She orders me to try it. I reluctantly agree. I take a bite out of the vegetable.  It's a fucking eggplant.  What the fuck, mom.  It was disgusting. The texture, the taste. 7 years later and I still cannot forgive my mom for doing something like that. Everytime I see an eggplant I remember that particular event in my life. I have eggplant PTSD. Playing Neptunia triggers me. I always thought eggplants are those stupid looking dildo vegetables that they always made fun of for being disgusting in cartoons.  I also blame this event for my lack of productivity. I am getting progressively worse at drawing, playing video games other than Dark Souls and I have given up on my goal of becoming an animator. All because of that eggplant.  Fuck you, mom.  Also she once fed me a small diced piece of a melon or whatever fruit in a salad, saying it's a cucumber. She knew I hate fruit. She knew. I cannot trust her. I cannot trust anyone.  Luckily, I I was just forced to eat the eggplant, I was not tied up or sexually fed that eggplant."

gamindustri,3cdqk6,biggsk,2,Wed Jul 8 07:42:50 2015 UTC,"Nepgear is a different character. She's unlockable in R;B1 and isn't part of the plot. She doesn't show up until the second game, so she's not plot relevant in the remake of the first."
gamindustri,3cdqk6,Rajaxx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:59:28 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, thanks!"
gamindustri,3cdqk6,biggsk,2,Wed Jul 8 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, she is a different person (Neptune's little sister.) You can get her and the other CPU Candidates in Re;Birth1 by getting Shares in Planeptune, Lowee and Lastation to 30% for their Birth plans, and then 50% in order to actually create them, although you will need two playthroughs to unlock them all.  Obtaining them gives you extra dialogue (their introduction Events,) and extra dialogue during the Epilogue, but isn't necessary unless you decide to go for all the Steam Achievements.  The reason why most people mention her after the Original and Re;Birth1 is because in Mk2 / Re;Birth2, the Story mostly revolves around her and the other CPU Candidates, for reasons I won't mention since you haven't played it yet. While the CPU Candidates themselves are also good characters, there is a major difference in tone / story between having Neptune as a Main Character, and having Nepgear as a Main Character, and unfortunately, with how Nepgear is in Mk2 / Re;Birth2 with her personality, she is not really good enough to fill the Main Character position. Later on in the game when she goes to talk to Blanc in one of the many events you get, Blanc even mentions herself that Neptune has the type of personality to understand and make any one her friend, and even though Nepgear does not have that, she has her own way of making friends herself."
gamindustri,3cdqk6,Rajaxx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, thanks! I'll have to play further haha. I'll probably get the other games after I beat Re;birth1.  I heard something about there being a bunch of different endings though, so I'm not really looking forward to finding out how to do all those... XD"
gamindustri,3cdqk6,biggsk,2,Wed Jul 8 20:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Mk2 had 8 endings, but Re;Birth2 added a 9th, which is practically a Positive version of Conquest Ending (Holy Sword.) You'll understand why it was necessary when you do Conquest Ending for the first time.  Don't look up any info on it either for Conquest. You need to suffer experience it blind like the rest of us."
gamindustri,3cdqk6,Rajaxx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"Lol ok, I won't spoil it. I'm assuming it's sad or something? I thought this was supposed to be a very lighthearted series, or at least that's the impression I've gotten so far."
gamindustri,3cdqk6,biggsk,2,Thu Jul 9 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"When the first Hyperdimension Neptunia game came out on PS3 (which people say to avoid because of its horrid gameplay, but still has a fantastic story,) a lot of the people who did play it voiced their opinion that they did not like how Comedic the Dialogue and Story was in general for that game, so as a result of that, when Mk2 was made, they went with a more serious (but still comedic) game.  One of the things they added as well to off-balance how lighthearted the game was at the time was the Conquest Ending, which pretty much takes what you know about the game from playing it, and then effectively slaps you in the face with the opposite. To be exact, it was a traumatizing ending, which you will understand why when you experience it yourself, and most people did not like that as a result, along with the more serious dialogue. It's pretty much one of those Endings you won't forget for quite a while.  So they went back to doing what they do best and keeping things comedic (except for Re;Birth2 of course which is a remake of Mk2, still with serious dialogue.)"
gamindustri,3cdqk6,kakigori,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"So is Re;birth1 or 2 the one that has that ending? There's so many hyperdimension games with similar titles, it's confusing for me. Mk2 is Re;birth2?  So only one of the games has a dark side to it, and the others are all lighthearted then. I'm not sure why people don't like the goofy, lightheartedness of Re;birth1, I think it's adorable and hilarious haha."
gamindustri,3cdqk6,kakigori,2,Thu Jul 9 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"Hyperdimension Neptunia, Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2, Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, and Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory II are the Main games, which are on PS3 / PS4.  Re;Birth1 (original), 2 (mk2) and 3 (Victory) are remakes of each of those games for Vita / PC.  Conquest Ending appears in Mk2, and also appears in Re;Birth2, so no, Re;Birth1 does not have that ending.   In case you ask afterwards: If you are looking for an actual Storyline, then Mk2 / Re;Birth2 > Victory / Re;Birth3 > Victory II fall in line with each other, even though they pretty much happen in different dimensions (Mk2 Neptune gets transported to the dimensions in Victory and Victory II, hence why they fall in line.) True Endings are Canon. It was done this way because with the True Ending in Hyperdimension Neptunia PS3, it was not possible to make sequels when they wanted to have story, and people liked the main CPUs, so they had to reboot the series with Mk2."

gamindustri,3c70bf,DoorframeLizard,8,Sun Jul 5 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"People love the game and are glad they are coming to the west. That's why we're here. It doesn't stop people from being critical of the games though. Neptunia is a series that no one (initially) thought was going to get big (I mean, the devs themselves basically thought of working with a new cast for mk2). It has slowly grown and gotten better over time. We want to see it continue to get better. Sure, I think this particular screenshot /  the others ones about translation meme-usage are a bit obscure / nit-picky, and I'm all for letting translators have some flex in how they do things because of:  Amateur linguist rationale  However, this doesn't change the fact that some people would like better/different translations. There is some limitation to the concept of flex at which point it becomes something different. Sometimes it is good (see how westernized Animal Crossing ended up getting re-translated back into Japanese). Sometimes it isn't.  I personally refrain casting my judgement on this topic of translations because I don't speak Japanese, and don't exactly remember how Victory exactly went in terms of translation / how NISA handled it.  If anything, I expected this to be your territory since you seem to have at least played through both the originals and the remakes and/or also have the Japanese language skills for this.  Still, people have the right to voice their opinion on this matter and start a discussion about this. Our input might not be much, but if there's a single IFI employing reading this at any point it the future, then it was worth it. If we don't speak up about how we feel about the translation / games, IFI is stuck firing syringe shots in the blind in terms of how to fix it.  TL;DR: Flex in translation is okay. Too much flex is questionable and turns original into something different. People criticize game because they love it and want to see it get better."
gamindustri,3c70bf,DoorframeLizard,3,Mon Jul 6 00:23:32 2015 UTC,"Well said. And another thing, Neptunia is a very character-centric series, deliberately so. It's evident in the fact that they hire some of the most prolific and talented voice actors in the industry (referring specifically to the Japanese cast, but also to the English cast to a lesser degree), despite the games selling barely more than a hundred thousand copies each. If the quality in the writing for the characters is degraded, be it due to localization or otherwise, then that's a major issue."
gamindustri,3c70bf,silverhydra,2,Sun Jul 5 20:40:03 2015 UTC,"+1 for mentioning that Polish idioms translate poorly into english (And vice versa) So many times where I want to say something but I can't translate it and I can't find any substitute idiom/word so I end up saying something dumb. Also you triggered my patriotic side, seeing my language mentioned out in the wild like that."
gamindustri,3c70bf,DoorframeLizard,2,Sun Jul 5 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"This is about as bad as World of Warcraft's community with every expansion the game's had :/   Not really.  If it was WoW's community, they would talk about how -insert developer in place of holinka- should die of cancer, that everything is unbalanced, that there's paid dlc, that the story doesnt make sense, that the devs are greedy, that they hate gamers and that Neptunia is dead. Wow's community is MUCH worse.  But I do agree that we should all be grateful that we're getting the games in the first place. I just dont think they should reference the memes that are not dank."
gamindustri,3c70bf,PraiseYuri,3,Mon Jul 6 00:29:38 2015 UTC,I just dont think they should reference the memes that are not dank.

gamindustri,3c671e,stealthcl0wn,2,Sun Jul 5 11:18:10 2015 UTC,"I think the Golden Third would be great to keep around, problems for the side characters tend to be a mix of licensing (for the ones named explicitly after companies), the fact that they suck compared to CPUs (Victory 2 fixed this though they still have too few skills) and they're largely one-trick ponies.  The Golden Third have incredible libraries of games to make references to for new skills and dialog, they're just fine in gameplay (or at least, less lacking relative to the CPUs than ever before), they're not officially licensed so probably less of a pain to deal with.  Then again they could easily drop them like they did with Peashy and Plutia, I hope not though. S-Sha and B-Sha are like my favorite makers along with CC2 and Cave."

gamindustri,3c3zom,burnpsy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:35:35 2015 UTC,I'm guessing its a licensing issue. Since Victory was done by NISA they couldn't just take rip the voices from the scene.   And Neptunia isn't big enough (in the west) for them to spend extra money on full voice acting.
gamindustri,3c3zom,reallygoodbee,0,Sun Jul 5 05:12:24 2015 UTC,"Umm...Even if they did do that, it would sound very weird as the translation is slightly different from NISA's.  For example, when Nepgear gets an affinity, the word ""affinity"" is replaced by ""ability"" in Re;birth3.  Gone is the dance event (featuring Go! Love&Peace from Neptunia mk2). Also gone is Pirachu, replaced by Warechu.  I personally much prefer the former over the latter, though I would still have the ""chu"" at the end of most of his sentences.  Plus NISA didn't even bother recording battle/menu voices for IF & Compa, whereas IFI did (and I'm pretty sure they're not ripped, but then again, I haven't used them once.)."

gamindustri,3bz815,sealewowsuchamaze,3,Fri Jul 3 10:08:22 2015 UTC,try running it in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3
gamindustri,3bz815,stealthcl0wn,2,Fri Jul 3 10:54:41 2015 UTC,"On top of running compatibility mode I decided to run it in 720p windowed(my native res is 1366x768).   UAC will be a bitch and will always show up when you start the game(I know for a fact there is a way to fix that though) Intro has very minor improvement Restarted laptop and tried again. Much less lag, great improvement to stability! lag isn't completely gone though... Still facing the lag after battle, most notably after difficult enemies(eg dolphin, flame fenrir etc), http://i.imgur.com/7qdgWbi.jpg just look at that. But... oh my gosh i can actually hit 60 in dungeons occasionallyhit 60 a lot after restart :D still have to haul task manager out of the potato to close the game. and my laptop being the potato it is takes 2 minutes to start task manager fml ;-; this is what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/bUWwOFn.jpg You were very right about stabilization though!    Decided to switch to Fraps for framerate counter and it showed the framerate locking at 30 in dungeon and the moment I went to the in-game menu it jumped to 60. I feel that it is unlikely that the 30fps lock is because of the potato I have, and hopefully IFI will give this game the optimization patch it needs soon. I recorded a bit of the end battle lag and I'll probably post it to give an idea of what I'm experiencing. Thanks so far!"
gamindustri,3bz815,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the game uses an awful, primitive form of v-sync.  If you don't hit 60, it will lower it to 30 and lock you there."

gamindustri,3by4bp,ginginator901,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:12:06 2015 UTC,Triangle button shows stat windows for all stats. I think the try on feature is when you choose an item in the shop but don't buy it and hit the triangle button until all screens go away. From there you can move the character.
gamindustri,3by4bp,Blazephantom,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"Triangle button is doing nothing for me. Square shows me stats, but doesn't really compare stats to currently equipped."

So no, they are not an expansion of the true ending.  It doesn't really matter which ending you do first, it's generally a good idea to do Conquest early, since that's painful. I think you should do True ending last, since some dungeons are only available there, so you wanna do end game stuff in the True ending's route."

No idea where is the requirement for the chirper events coming from(not 15 either), you don't need any shares for that. I'm sure I had about 2% shares for a nation and the chirper events still popped up.

gamindustri,3bor11,nothinfollowsme,3,Wed Jul 1 00:05:28 2015 UTC,I believe it's from an artbook that came with the Japanese Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory as a preorder bonus.
gamindustri,3bor11,nobleseeker,3,Tue Jun 30 22:39:00 2015 UTC,This pic is what I see every time I play L4D2
gamindustri,3bor11,Okhlahoma_Beat-Down,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:03:58 2015 UTC,"Aye, same."
gamindustri,3bor11,Fissie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:49:52 2015 UTC,Ayy that's my phone wallpaper :3
gamindustri,3bor11,Tjoeb123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:43:07 2015 UTC,"Nice find!  Here, have an upvote."
gamindustri,3bor11,Zilveari,-1,Tue Jun 30 23:56:28 2015 UTC,"Should flair that as NSFW, I wouldn't want Noire's pantsu showing up on my screen at work.    Also is that a scythe on the left side?"
gamindustri,3bor11,Zilveari,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:21:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I thought it would be tame enough :P  Yeah it looks like a scythe. If you look closely you can see her holding the shaft in her right hand. I think it was from an early version of her character design. It would have been so cool if she used a scythe in the game."
gamindustri,3bpurd,ishovedadogupmyass,3,Wed Jul 1 04:41:18 2015 UTC,The things you're missing are the Enemy/Item remakes for dungeons that can only be gotten during the True End path.  So just go through the True End path and ... go through the game a 3rd time...  This game is got out of hand on its grinding compared to Re;birth1.
gamindustri,3bpurd,Sedori,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:11:26 2015 UTC,awesome thankyou
gamindustri,3bota4,petalferrous,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:53:38 2015 UTC,Oh God. It sounds like victory all over again. I was hoping the frame rate would be more stable. That's one of the reasons I bought rebirth 3. Oh well.
gamindustri,3bota4,ginginator901,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:27:31 2015 UTC,Physical copy takes a moment or two to get going in a dungeon but it clears up to a fairly playable level after that 2-3 sec load.  Otherwise it's averaging about as well as other Re;Birth games do on Vita.
gamindustri,3bota4,Taedirk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:14:42 2015 UTC,I'm getting around 20-25 fps for the game so far. Only in chapter one. I'll see how it goes
gamindustri,3bota4,ginginator901,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"I have Re;Birth 2 and 3 digitally, and 3 performs better for me, so that is going on for me."
gamindustri,3bota4,SuperRiderTH,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:56:44 2015 UTC,Why would a physical copy make a difference?
gamindustri,3bota4,CaptainCapybara,2,Wed Jul 1 01:12:09 2015 UTC,"I thought game cards and discs performed better than digital copies in general? IDK, I might be wrong."
gamindustri,3bota4,Roondak,2,Wed Jul 1 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"Vita game cards are faster than Vita memory cards. For example, the initial load screen in Uncharted: Golden Abyss is 2-4 seconds faster with a physical copy.  Source: http://kotaku.com/5869222/which-is-faster-vita-game-cards-or-vita-downloads/"
gamindustri,3bota4,ginginator901,2,Wed Jul 1 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, interesting. Dunno if that would affect frame rate but neat little fact. Another reason for me to keep buying physical copies"
gamindustri,3bota4,Roondak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah it might perform a bit better in game due to the higher load speed, but I doubt it'd be very noticeable."
gamindustri,3bota4,CaptainCapybara,2,Wed Jul 1 18:56:46 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks for the link. I always assumed since both ways were reading off of a card it would be the same (as opposed to other systems where you have disc drive speed in the mix)."
gamindustri,3bota4,Roondak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:25:22 2015 UTC,"Of course. It just so happens that one card is faster than the other. Certainly though, loading a PS3 or 360 game off the hard drive generally is faster than off a disc."
gamindustri,3bota4,ginginator901,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"If anything I think digital would run better since it's all on the hard drive/ memory card so the disc reader doesn't have to read it. But pretty sure they all run the same, excluding loading times. Those usually are shorter on digital"
gamindustri,3bnuw6,Tjoeb123,3,Tue Jun 30 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"I have the same dilemma! I wish it could randomize the themes every time you turn on the system so that it's a different one every time. The Chibi BGM is my favorite, the Candidates theme have my favorite Ps vita app icons, and the CPU background themes are the best. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE TO PICKKKK. That aside, I honestly think this is money well spent."
gamindustri,3bnuw6,EmoIga,3,Tue Jun 30 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I love the Candidate images (Purple Sister is just cute!) but I don't think I'm up for hearing $100 a million times over on my main screens.  It's not a bad song, but let me remind you it's been the main event theme for literally every Neptunia game (even Re;birth1!) since mk2, with the exception of NepU.  Even VII, AFAIK, keeps this tradition going.  I do wish the themes would change the PS Store music to that of the in-game shop.  Also, I'll miss my Hyperdevotion Noire background set but this'll be a theme I'll be keeping set for a long time."
gamindustri,3bnuw6,Daverost,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:58:11 2015 UTC,"I wish it could randomize the themes every time you turn on the system so that it's a different one every time.   As much as I generally dislike everything about the way Nintendo designs their consoles, this is a really, really good (though late) feature on 3DS, and I'd love it if Sony would implement it on PS4 and Vita."
gamindustri,3bnuw6,Daverost,2,Tue Jun 30 22:02:12 2015 UTC,Definitely have the same problem. One has Nep and the other has Uni and I'm clueless on what I should do.
gamindustri,3bnuw6,Cater0mcf,2,Tue Jun 30 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to roll with the chibi theme. CPU candidates are out of the question, I don't like them much. The decision between Chibi and CPU is hard, maybe gonna rotate them, but I like the bgm of Chibi better. Probably gonna switch around a background or two too."
gamindustri,3bluwr,Rajaxx,8,Tue Jun 30 07:14:38 2015 UTC,
gamindustri,3bluwr,stealthcl0wn,9,Tue Jun 30 09:25:30 2015 UTC,"I'm quite shocked myself, I didn't know cosplay meant stripping."
gamindustri,3bluwr,Cater0mcf,2,Tue Jun 30 09:26:47 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly.
gamindustri,3bluwr,stealthcl0wn,2,Tue Jun 30 09:28:52 2015 UTC,Err cosplaying characters in... certain works?
gamindustri,3bluwr,Koverp,4,Tue Jun 30 10:15:33 2015 UTC,And they say Nepgear is a Nudist
gamindustri,3bluwr,Tjoeb123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"And Nepgear, if you count a certain image on the Re;birth2 LE calander..."
gamindustri,3bluwr,codered543,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:10:45 2015 UTC,Any idea if there  is an image set for the calander anywhere? Either the the 3 preview ones
gamindustri,3bluwr,Okhlahoma_Beat-Down,-4,Tue Jun 30 20:23:01 2015 UTC,Dunno if I feel sorry for her for deciding to cosplay as a stripper.  tfw slut
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Tjoeb123,3,Tue Jun 30 17:06:19 2015 UTC,Hooray for 64gb memory!
gamindustri,3bnh1m,kakigori,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:59:33 2015 UTC,This is not good. I have no idea how much free space I have on my wimpy 8gb card.
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Blazephantom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:13:33 2015 UTC,am cry. rip remaining space on my card.  Edit: 677 MB left. Had 2993 before.
gamindustri,3bnh1m,ginginator901,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:29:43 2015 UTC,Seriously? A character pack is 1GB?
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Roondak,2,Tue Jun 30 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"One is about 700MB, the other is 260MB."
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Roondak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"That's still quite a bit for a 2 characters...  EDIT: Oh, they're character packs... Yeah that makes more sense..."
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Roondak,2,Wed Jul 1 03:59:14 2015 UTC,Yep.  Would rather have these than having to download 10+ characters (in addition to all the other DLC) individually.
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Roondak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:29:42 2015 UTC,"That's true, a lot of games have way too many little DLCs on Vita."
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Sedori,2,Wed Jul 1 05:58:06 2015 UTC,Sigh......trying to queue up all the free DLC for Senran Kagura was more of a hassle than it needed to be.  As is queuing up all the DLC for a game I redownload.
gamindustri,3bnh1m,dodongo821,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Vita's store can be quite finicky at times. I often prefer to back up my whole game to PS3/PC so I won't have to redownload all the DLCs.."
gamindustri,3bnh1m,dodongo821,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:58:02 2015 UTC,"Are there any in-game movies in Victory, not included in RB3?"
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Zilveari,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:55:26 2015 UTC,I would assume that the dance event (with GO! Love&Peace from mk2) is removed but I hope I'm wrong.
gamindustri,3bnh1m,Zilveari,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:57:52 2015 UTC,How many dlc packs are there? Cause im so used to paying for the game and all dlc for 20 dollars with a steam card. It would really suck if rebirth 3 couldnt be bought with a steam card.
gamindustri,3bnh1m,MegamanZen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:00:43 2015 UTC,"I think there's just one item pack that's $1, plus the 3 Vita themes that are $1 each (obviously that doesn't apply to Steam), but everything else is free. If you don't believe me feel free to go to the PS Store and see for yourself.  http://store.playstation.com/"

gamindustri,3bmlzx,gametempest,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:02:57 2015 UTC,...but wouldn't that be 'add pudding' and remove [insert Arfoire food here]?
gamindustri,3bmlzx,qchto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:32:42 2015 UTC,yeah it should be REMOVE EGGPLANT.   REMOVE EGGPLANT remove eggplant  you are worst nep. you are the nep idiot you are the nep smell go back to R4
gamindustri,3bmlzx,petalferrous,3,Tue Jun 30 23:39:43 2015 UTC,I'd rather bring Arfoire with eggplants...
gamindustri,3bmu17,kuletxcore,2,Tue Jun 30 14:19:40 2015 UTC,Compile Heart should make Roam a true character. Next HDN game will have fusions. I can see it now.
gamindustri,3bj1pw,Tachibana_Lab,3,Mon Jun 29 17:04:55 2015 UTC,Here's an album of the process. I've made a few of these for characters from games and anime that catch my interest. After watching the Hyperdimension anime Plutia was quickly added to the list.
gamindustri,3bj1pw,retnuh8,2,Mon Jun 29 17:07:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, really good job on the Plutia. The little neptune doll is adorable. Can you post that Nepgear one when you're done too? Love her :D"
gamindustri,3bj1pw,mabinight,3,Mon Jun 29 17:14:04 2015 UTC,Thanks :D. The doll alone probably took more than an hour to complete >_<. I started filling it in thinking that it would be quick but by the time it was finished I had no desire to do more.  I don't know when I'll start working on Nepgear but I'll try to make a post similar to this one when it's done.
gamindustri,3bj1pw,Cater0mcf,3,Mon Jun 29 17:19:06 2015 UTC,It's huge!
gamindustri,3bj1pw,ginginator901,3,Mon Jun 29 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, but it's smaller than the size that I usually make these. Here's a (crappy) picture of the group"
gamindustri,3bj1pw,Domoda,2,Mon Jun 29 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, it looks awesome, great job."
gamindustri,3bj1pw,TheWayToGod,2,Mon Jun 29 17:13:14 2015 UTC,Thanks :D.
gamindustri,3bj1pw,lpchaim,2,Mon Jun 29 17:20:18 2015 UTC,THAT'S SO COOL
gamindustri,3bj1pw,Yacoon,2,Mon Jun 29 18:09:47 2015 UTC,So uhhhh... Can I have it? XD
gamindustri,3bj1pw,Neo_Techni,2,Mon Jun 29 20:18:19 2015 UTC,Now that's talent.
gamindustri,3bj1pw,nothinfollowsme,2,Mon Jun 29 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, your art really does look great. The sharp contours and soft colors mesh quite well, all the more with this moe aesthetics. The others you posted look good as well, I'm especially fond of the Higurashi one. I won't lie though, it does make me a bit jealous as I can barely muster the ability to scribble some faces with wildly varying degrees of resemblance all over my study material haha."
gamindustri,3bj1pw,yuki264,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:08:04 2015 UTC,That looks very nice. I'm always envious of people with good drawing skills(or skills in arts in general). The best thing I could do would be a really bad stick figure. xD   Keep up the good work!
gamindustri,3bkh52,Tjoeb123,8,Mon Jun 29 23:25:06 2015 UTC,I strongly believe they just got afraid from the thought that we would riot. They threw it together in 2 days for us.  They had no chance
gamindustri,3bkh52,Cater0mcf,3,Mon Jun 29 23:30:08 2015 UTC,I too thought this
gamindustri,3bkh52,ginginator901,3,Mon Jun 29 23:55:21 2015 UTC,Those faces don't seem to work when viewing them from the inbox...
gamindustri,3bkh52,Histirea,4,Tue Jun 30 01:10:28 2015 UTC,They're sub-specific objects. They won't show up outside the sub they were made for.
gamindustri,3bkh52,Blazephantom,7,Tue Jun 30 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"There's 3 themes total.  One is of the chibi versions of the characters (what you'd see in the towns, etc.)  Another features the CPUs, and the last featuring the CPU Candidates.  They're $1 each, and will launch in EU on July 8th.  If you want to see what these themes actually look like, go here.  Also if you haven't noticed already, I've been cross-posting this to /r/vita."
gamindustri,3bkh52,RadiantViper,4,Tue Jun 30 01:09:39 2015 UTC,ALL HAIL THE CPUS! Gotta buy them all.
gamindustri,3bkh52,zeppo3k,6,Mon Jun 29 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yessss, thank you IF. I'll be buying them all for sure.  Hopefully we get the PS4 theme as well!"
gamindustri,3bkh52,TweetPoster,4,Mon Jun 29 23:55:50 2015 UTC,"It probably depends on how well these sell. But i hope they get those vii themes too, they look awesome."
gamindustri,3bkh52,Villag3Idiot,3,Tue Jun 30 00:18:30 2015 UTC,They have to announce the game itself first.
gamindustri,3bkh52,qchto,4,Tue Jun 30 01:09:57 2015 UTC,@RPGSite:   2015-06-29 22:43:14 UTC  Idea Factory will be launching 3 Neptunia ReBirth 3 themes tomorrow on the NA PSN (EU on the 8th) for $1 (€1) each. pic.twitter.com [Imgur]     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
gamindustri,3bkh52,Raygenesis,3,Mon Jun 29 23:26:07 2015 UTC,Definitely getting the chibi ones.
gamindustri,3bl3es,Blazephantom,5,Tue Jun 30 02:33:14 2015 UTC,"And so, the cycle begins.....  And by cycle, I mean the following events (in the US):   Everyone's copy of the LE ships out. Everyone gets their copy before I do. USPS has some random delay on their end. I go onto sites and bitch about the USPS and how I don't have my copy yet.   Only this time, I've learned not to do that last item so I won't."
gamindustri,3bl3es,Tjoeb123,3,Tue Jun 30 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"It's okay, I also hate USPS. They decided to hold my package for two days when it was already in my city instead of delivering it right away. What a wonderful world we live in"
gamindustri,3bl3es,ginginator901,3,Tue Jun 30 04:29:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, when I say delay, I mean the delivery date (currently set for Thursday) passes and the tracking doesn't update until the next day.  It hasn't done that ALL the time, but when it has I get a little angry (like Plutia, hehe.) because I love Neptunia!  In the meantime I'll download the themes so that my Vita can Nep-Nep with Neptuna, Nowaru, and Prutia. (Yes, I made up that last one based on how it is in Japan)  As well as maybe the DLC.  Which reminds me, I'd like to remind everyone that the Japanese audio is NOT included by default (since the JP version already maxes out a 4GB retail card).  It'll be a free download instead (once the Store updates).  Which reminds me again - I wonder if applying any of the Neptunia themes changes the PS Store music to the in-game shop music?"
gamindustri,3bl3es,Tjoeb123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the character dlc. Now being that I got Soul Sacrifice yesterday and that leaving 2 GB on my memory card... Well, maybe it's time for a new card."
gamindustri,3bl3es,ginginator901,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:22:13 2015 UTC,"Nope, haven't forgotten that!  I just thought the Japanese audio bit was important, is all.  Just in case people freak out that the game doesn't have Japanese voice acting upon starting the game, or to those importing.  Of course I haven't seen /u/BlueMaxima's video on it yet (because spoilers) but I'm sure he made a note of it."
gamindustri,3bl3es,Tjoeb123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:55:23 2015 UTC,"JP VA is very important, I wouldn't really feel like I was playing neptunia without them honestly, especially when I hear the English voice acting isn't so great in R3."
gamindustri,3bl3es,ginginator901,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:02:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, personally I'm a dub person no matter how bad it is (unless it's Chaos Wars bad).  I don't hate Japanese audio (especially if it's a matter of not dubbing a game vs. not having the game at all, like most of Bamco's recent localizations), it's just English dubs are my preference.  And besides, the text may not always be accurate with the JP audio anyways (not counting things like Gameyokun or Pururut, aka Gamindustri and Plutia in Japan), as we've seen with NISA's localizations.  Also, good thing I have a 64GBer."
gamindustri,3bl3es,Tjoeb123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:33:29 2015 UTC,It just feels nice to be able to understand what they say.
gamindustri,3bl3es,Cater0mcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:39:53 2015 UTC,"I usually do dubs, but to me the different voices for each language almost seem like separate people (don't know how to describe it) I also find Japanese nep much more entertaining when she freaks out compared to the American VA one. That being said, I don't HATE the dub, I enjoy it. Just slightly prefer the JP one for this franchise.   And lucky you. I have an 8GB and a 16 GB. Did you buy the 64 gb msrp?"
gamindustri,3bl3es,ginginator901,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:49:21 2015 UTC,"It was about $100, so....probably."

gamindustri,3bl3es,Tjoeb123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:59:48 2015 UTC,"It's okay, I tend to forget EU release dates too.  That also means /u/Cater0mcf won't be able to download the themes till the 8th either."
gamindustri,3bl3es,Cater0mcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:59:12 2015 UTC,"That's quite alright, I don't mind waiting for that.  What I do mind however, even if I wasn't buying limited editions, I probably will never be able to play a Neptunia game on release, since shops here don't sell them, so I have to order them from UK all the time(I don't live there)."
gamindustri,3bl3es,Tjoeb123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:26:03 2015 UTC,Your region's PS Store doesn't have the Neptunia games either?
gamindustri,3bl3es,Cater0mcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:42:52 2015 UTC,"It does, it's really nice that I can use my own region, unlike on Nintendo consoles. But I don't like getting games digitally, well not the ones available to me physically.  By shops here I meant local stores where they sell them. Here Nintendo consoles and the Vita get a lot of hate, and while there are groups fighting for the Nintendo consoles, so shops usually have a lot of games for those, not so much for the Vita. You can only find AAA titles or some random no name games that no one wants to buy, kind of a shame, I live in the capital too.  The only Neptunia game I've ever seen in the country(besides my copies) was an Mk2 that had the first game's limited edition for it's cover for some reason.  So my options are pretty much ordering standard editions from Zavvi, while they tend to send the game 3-4 earlier than release date, it usually arrives 3-4 days late; and IFI for limited editions."
gamindustri,3bl3es,doombot117,2,Tue Jun 30 09:07:39 2015 UTC,"I live in the UK and i just got my LE delivered today, 3 days early"

gamindustri,3bl3es,Ghostly95,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:29:07 2015 UTC,I paided for normal shipping from the EU IF store
gamindustri,3bl3es,Cater0mcf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:10:15 2015 UTC,I'm suprised that the EU store had the limited edition sell out that quick. They're still in stock on the American store.
gamindustri,3bl3es,ginginator901,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think there were many of them in stock. Hyperdevotion Noire took a while until it ran out of stock, Re;birth 2 ran out of stock maybe a month ago. After those games I'm pretty sure IFI just brought less limited editions to EU."
gamindustri,3bjukj,Cater0mcf,3,Mon Jun 29 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/eIlHm8x.png  Sorry they aren't screenshots from the actual games, but I uninstalled them and didn't want to reinstall just for the sake of the picture. I recorded these numbers right after I finished my own version of ""100%ing"" the games; that to me being completing all sidequests, creating every single plan, holding at least one of every item in the game at once, getting full Nepedia information on monsters, and probably a few more things. The only thing I refused to do is max out everyone's lily ranks with each other. Re;birth1 is from PC and Re;birth2 is from Vita."

gamindustri,3bjukj,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:17:17 2015 UTC,I don't either.  I honestly just spam rush attacks or the occasional Power if it's a weak enemy.
gamindustri,3bjukj,ginkaa,2,Tue Jun 30 09:30:45 2015 UTC,"Re;Birth1, PC Version. Still proud (and maybe a little concerned) of my 160 hours of playtime. And I love that we have done literally thousands of jumps despite it being functionally pointless."
gamindustri,3bjukj,ginkaa,3,Mon Jun 29 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, really nice, I only had about 100 hours on my PC when I first met the series, no idea how did I play it for that much, but I've definitely enjoyed it.  It's fun jumping around, hearing everyone how they jump. Plus whenever I'm grinding there is really nothing else to do, well, scanning kinda sucks, so left with jumping. I seem to be jumping more often, with jumping once every 56 seconds average compared to your 125 per second. Buuuuut, great news, Re;birth 3 is gonna have hidden blocks, so we are going to have a reason to jump!  What I find weird is that you switched a lot of times. I've never been fond of the function, it often feels you are just skipping a turn. Do you find it useful to heal/switch on the HDD for your other character?"
gamindustri,3bjukj,TheWayToGod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:12:42 2015 UTC,"I like switching my characters to heal them up if they've taken a lot of damage during a boss battle or whatever. You do sort of lose a turn but the alternative is another character losing a turn healing them back up to full, or using an item. Switching them back a couple of turns later and they're usually at full health again. I've basically never needed to use Compa in the late game (around 50+), or healing items using that strategy."

gamindustri,3bhwlx,Chimpso,2,Mon Jun 29 10:39:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you used physical damage on a unit that has really high armor. Neptune only has physical attacks, I think Noire's only magical moves are the ones that have elemental effects.  Using Compa's EXE attack would have done wonders, since it's magic damage(especially with int booster).  Both Noire and Neptune have attack buffs, so it's a good idea to use those during hard fights. Plus Neptune has a buff that increases everything besides attack and int, it probably would have prevented Noire from getting 1-shoted all the time.  Lastly, try to time guard brakes so that you can use one or two exe attacks when their bar is empty."
gamindustri,3bhwlx,Cater0mcf,2,Mon Jun 29 11:33:52 2015 UTC,"That boss is pretty tough the first time, but here's some tips that could have made it easier:  You will notice the guard meter only regenerates after a guard break; there's no point bringing the guard meter all the way down so that Compa can get a single hit in. Don't be afraid to defend until all of your party members can attack after the enemy gets a turn, then you can unload all your damage at once. On a similar note, with high regen mobs, you want to do as much burst damage as possible. Build up EXE and unleash it all at once rather than using it as soon as you can.  I noticed you didn't set any power attacks for Noire. I know that you're using EXE boost for EXE spam to kill bosses, so it's not so important, but Noire is excellent at DPS since she naturally has the ""Ignore Enemy Traits"" buff which allows her to cut through the high physical defense that machine type mobs like this one has.  Lastly, you should pair up characters and switch them out in battle when they're low on HP. When characters are in the back row, they will regenerate health each turn so you don't have to rely on healing as much. At the very least you can use Assist finishers which tend to have very high guard break values."
gamindustri,3bhwlx,ginkaa,3,Mon Jun 29 12:06:04 2015 UTC,I almost have a platinum in Re;Birth 1 and Re;Birth 2 and I never knew characters regenerate health in the back row :<

Each NG+ would take you about 2-3 hours to complete.  You won't have the CPUs recruited, you have to get them again, which means a lot of share manipulation, but that's the main thing that makes each NG+ clear 2-3 hours.   If you don't plan on beating the game that many times, I suggest getting Conquest ending, Holy Sword ending and True ending saved. Conquest gives you CPU Aegis, which is the best ornament in the game(or one of the best), Holy Sword endings gives you the remaining CPU and Candidate Aegis+it gives you Nepgear's best sword in the game.

gamindustri,3bafxf,stealthcl0wn,2,Sat Jun 27 09:08:20 2015 UTC,"1) Noire/Uni. I've only played RB1 and 2 so far, but they always seem pretty salty. I wouldn't mind seeing that get taken another step.  2) Uh... what's a really robust dating sim? Because I'll go with that.  3) Not really doomed, I'd think. We'd probably just read all day. Maybe take a break now and again to drink tea or talk about books. I should live through it as long as I'm not too annoying.  4) Blanc (ayyy) and MAGES."
gamindustri,3bafxf,Sporadi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:02:00 2015 UTC,"If MAGES. had known this would be the reaction, she wouldn't have needed to charge Vert.  This sight alone was enough to justify taking the request.   The sight of Blanc, Rom and Ram on stage dressed in maid outfits and cat ears dancing for a gathering audience in Lowee.  A sight like this was rarer than the most valuable of monster drops.  It was a most beautiful, resplendent sight. All the credits in the world meant nothing.   Vert's request was a simple one: ""Wound Blanc's pride, and make her look cute doing so.""  MAGES. had charged her a generous fee of 500k credits for this. The idea alone was enough to sell her, but she needed enough to turn tail and flee from Lowee if things went south.   Instead, things went in the best possible direction they could've. The only thing that would've satisfied MAGES. more was if the cute blue haired assistant girl whom she always forget was up there with them.  She stared at her potions bag. A lock of Cyberconnect2's hair and a fragment of a maid outfit Vert once made Nepgear wear was all it took to make this. If it was this simple, then maybe other combinations would be as well? MAGES. was positively giddy at the prospect of the Lastation CPUs doing this.  Returning her gaze to the stage, MAGES. found herself oddly enthralled by Blanc's movements. She had cute little hips, and she was adorable when she was enjoying herself.  Bah, this was no time to be ogling a CPU, nor was it time to be lingering. The effects would wear off shortly. MAGES. slowly pushed her way through the crowd and made her way out of Lowee.  6 hours later, whilst browsing the Graveyard.net, MAGES. stumbled upon a live clip of the spell wearing off.  It was marvellous.  Before, they were dancing enthusiastically without a care in the world.  After, they were shyly covering themselves up and blushing so furiously that there was almost some glare.  To them, this was a public death sentence. The end of their pride and dignity, which they would never recover.  To MAGES., this was a sign that maybe she should take more contracts from Vert. There was lots of fun to be had."

gamindustri,3bafxf,Kitsunedon,2,Sun Jun 28 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"1: Spoiler For VII To be honest, I would like to see the aftermath for the Conquest Ending, but we know how that goes. So in turn, I'd say the goddess I want to see turn to the evil side would be Neptune. It'd be like a endearing villain with humour and jokes afoot, and it'd be very interesting experience.  2: I honestly don't follow a lot of franchises so I can't give a straight answer to this. The entire series is a bloody testament to gaming culture and jokes, so it's kind of difficult to think of a good crossover that would work perfectly.  3: Not screwed at all. I would love to learn a lot about the world and everything in it, but it probably would take 3 days to even get any information.  4: CAVE and MAGES. This is a very peculiar paring, but let's see where you can take it."

gamindustri,3bafxf,Cater0mcf,2,Sun Jun 28 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"1) Hmmm, gotta agree with a lot of people, probably Noire is the closest to become an antagonist. She tends to show more interest in beating everyone and ruling gamindustri than anyone else. Buuuut, since I enjoy using the original four CPU, I wouldn't mind Orange Heart falling to the evil side, as I don't know her yet.  2) At first I didn't know which series to say, I'm not really into JRPGs or visual novels that would fit HDN well, but I remembered that I'm a fan of Monster Girl Quest. So HDN+MGQ crossover please, tho it's never going to happen, MGQ being an eroge and highly +18.  3) Aside from being hugged to death, I think I would be fine. I'm a quite skilled gamer myself, reaching the top of the ladders of different games and winning 80% of the LAN tournaments I participate, so we would have a fun time. Besides, Vert is the nicest character, isn't she?"

I would be okay with that. Well at least until the syringe comes out.

gamindustri,3bafxf,Okhlahoma_Beat-Down,2,Mon Jun 29 04:53:19 2015 UTC,"1.) I could see Noire from the Ultradimension falling to the evil side, considering how she is incredibly arrogant, thinking that she is better than every one else (Noire in the Hyperdimension is nowhere near as arrogant as her Ultradimension counterpart.) You know it's bad when Plutia has to constantly punish her and she still remains the same way afterwards.  2.) I'm not sure what Crossover Game I would like to see, but I am dying to see SEGA and Compile Heart/Idea Factory agree to do a Neptunia Collaboration in Phantasy Star Online 2. I already got Rie Tanaka's Voice Ticket. Just give me Purple Heart's outfit and her processor parts as accessories! Neptune's Jacket or her Victory clothes would also be very nice.  3.) Aww yeah. I am pretty satisfied.  4.) Wow... I have no words for how rigged this Wheel is. Kei and Noire."
gamindustri,3bafxf,greatfinn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"WARNING: LONG.  The other Noire wasn't quite used to the Hyperdimension's basilicom. Whereas hers was decorated to fit her personal traits, this one was decorated in a very... ""official"" manner. It slowly freaked her out inside, which she did NOT need today of all days.   2 weeks prior to her visit, all of the Ultradimension had come together to witness the delightful marriage of Blanc and Vert. Everyone was celebrating that they'd found love. Noire celebrated alongside them, until a doubt sprung up in her mind.  ""Can I find love too?"" she thought.  She knew she wouldn't find any in the ultradimension. Plutia was married to this world's Neptune, Blanc and Vert had JUST tied the knot. She could've dated Rei Ryghts, but she was far too dangerous for her tastes. Out of options, Noire turned her attentions to the other dimension.   Would she end up with that dimension's Blanc or Vert? Or... would she end up with HERSELF? So many possibilities, many of them Noire refused to entertain.  After about half an hour of waiting, Noire heard someone enter the room. She turned, expecting to see her other self.  Instead she was met with a sight she never could've dreamed of. Before her stood a 4ft11 silver-haired woman wearing an expression of impatience that, on anyone else, would've look terrifying.  But on this woman it looked... enticing. Noire found herself staring for far longer than she felt anyone would be comfortable. Her cute little nose, her beautiful silver hair, her cold blue eyes, her immaculately well fitting suit, and her lips that really should be put somewhere on Noire's body  ""Can I help you?"" said the woman sternly, as if she'd been reading Noire's every thought.  Noire was startled by her sudden interruption, as well a little scared. Deep down, a part of her was even... excited. This woman before her was intimidating, and maybe even dangerous.  ...  Oh no. It hit her.  Noire liked dangerous women. Noire. Loved. Dangerous Women. Iris Heart, Rei Ryghts. It all made sense now.  ""I'm here to see... well, me, if schedule permits"" said Noire, hoping that the woman would take her right here, right now, on the floor to see Noire.  The woman nodded. ""Right this way. I also believe introductions are in order: I'm Kei Jinguji, the oracle of Lastation in this dimension.""  Kei Jinguji. So Noire finally had a name to whimper during the late hours of the night put to a face. Noire observed Kei carefully as they proceeded to Noire's office. The way she walked betrayed feelings of self-confidence. It was intimidating, powerful, impressive.  Noire mentally slapped herself. She came here for other reasons, not to fantasize about Lastation's oracle.  ...Or did she?  She did come here in search of a partner after all.  ""Noire isn't busy. You may proceed through this door and to the left to reach her office. I'll be going now, take care.""  Noire blushed whenever she spoke. Was it attraction or intimidation? She couldn't quite tell. Nonetheless, Noire proceeded to go meet her other half. She had some very important questions to ask her.  Noire entered the office and was greeted by the sight of her other self beckoning her over to her desk. Taking a seat, Noire straightened herself out.  ""So, what brings YOU here today? You never visit. Blanc and Vert always get visits from their other self but not me."" The other Noire was doing an awful job at masking her insecurities.  ""Well... I... uh..."" Noire realized she hadn't ACTUALLY prepared any questions. In an attempt to prevent any awkward fumbling, Noire steeled herself and prepared to ask a very dangerous question.  ""Your oracle... Kei... IS SHE SINGLE?"" Noire blurted out. She had hoped it would come out more professional-sounding than that.  The other Noire's facial expression changed drastically. Her eyes widened, and her mouth curled into something that could only be described as an evil, sadistic grin. Almost like Iris Heart. Sitting up from her chair, the now terrifying Noire slowly and playfully walked around her desk, and came face-to-face with her other self. She leaned in slowly, as if she was SAVOURING this. Getting right up close to her other self's ear, she spoke the words that would haunt Noire until she breathed her last;  ""I hope you haven't been pondering this, because Kei can read the narration."""

If she's that sadistic as a 'good' character, she'd be fuckin' invincible as an evil one.  2) For me, I think it'd be PAYDAY. I can already picture that the Chika civilian would automatically have Stockholm Syndrome for the Vert heister. Also, Tekken Cloaker would be funny.  ""I-I call that a difficulty tweak!""  3) I'd survive. All I need to do is Vertpost all day, and we'd get on well. As for entertainment, I dunno.

gamindustri,3b92bd,Mechyoshi,3,Fri Jun 26 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"It does not play like the original at all. You don't move during combat, rather you just select a target. The combos were also a lot longer, since they were based on your AP which could go high into the hundreds for combos that take a while to execute (mashing triangle, anyone?). Also, encounters seemed to be based on time spent walking in a dungeon, the monsters don't actually show up and there's no such thing as a symbol attack. I liked it. The art was also better, in my opinion. Transformation sequences were actually cool.  On the topic of the story, there are a great deal of differences. Instead of being chummy with Neptune and friends, the other three CPUs hate her guts pretty much (except Vert, she just isn't greatly friendly with them). You don't get to use any of them until near the end of the game. I think you could also get Nisa, Gust, 5pb., and some other characters through DLC that don't exist in Re;Birth 1."
gamindustri,3b92bd,TheWayToGod,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:10:34 2015 UTC,"The only thing thats the same in Re;Birth 1 is the basic story premise. However, how they go through the story is completely different.  As mentioned, even the characters themselves are different, as well as their personalities.  For example, due to reasons, Gust and NISA were removed and Broccoli/Falcom took over. MAGES. from V also appears in the story and MAGES./Broccoli are from the Mk2/Victory universe.  Personality wise, IF is much friendlier in Re;Birth 1 than in HDN1, where it takes her a while to warm up to Neptune and Compa. The Goddesses all have split personality quirks from Mk2/Victory, whereas only Neptune had them in the original.  Generally, I liked HDN1's story much more than the rest of the series, as it focused on characters/story/lore/references much more so than the other games.  Also its the only main series game to have received a full dub.  But ya, the major problem is that the gameplay is terrible and takes forever if you don't animation skip. The music is pretty bad too and repetitive."
gamindustri,3b90lo,DrunkLightning,2,Fri Jun 26 23:19:02 2015 UTC,"The guard break value (unlike the power value) is multiplied by number of hits. So when it says 183, that's per hit; probably 183x3 to give a total of 549."

According to your assumption Break! should do twice as much damage as Fall!, but on my attack, Break! dealt around 21k damage, while Fall! dealt around 32k on the same enemy.  I don't think base damage*number of hits shows the strength of the move. I think they have some multiplier so that Rush increase more EXE drive, Power has higher damage and Break lower's the enemy(dunno, shield?) more."
gamindustri,3b75bn,mrzero787,4,Fri Jun 26 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"Re;birth1 Specific:  You get:  Nepgear, end-game, from a plan.  Iris Heart/Plutia, is DLC.  Noire/Black Heart, is mid-game, you get her naturally.  Compa is your first party member.  Yellow Heart/Peashy, is DLC. DLC characters only appear at Chapter 2 and after you look at their ""events"" in Planeptune.  Re;birth2 Specific:  Nepgear is the main character.  Iris Heart is not here, nor is Peashy.  Noire is near the end.  Compa is also your first party member.  These games have New Game+, you keep all your items, levels, but anything story related goes away.  As long as they're in your party and not KO'd they'll gain EXP, also it's not divided, if the game says 500 exp everyone gets 500 exp.  I recommend just going through the game multiple times instead of having a save where you can fork through the endings. I'm personally at Cycle 8 (RB1) and Cycle 10 (RB2) even though you'd only need like 3 to be able to get all the remake plans working.  Since these games are also available on the Vita, there's that.  I don't think this game is popular enough to warrant a GotY edition.  Nep VII, probably. I'm hopeful."

I'll double check when I can."
gamindustri,3b75bn,Sedori,2,Fri Jun 26 15:55:27 2015 UTC,Bummer on no peashy/plutia in RB2. Guess I'll be able to switch back and forth between the girls without worrying to much.

Re;birth 1: Iris Heart and Yellow Heart are DLC characters(they have no part in the story), you get them right at the start of chapter two(check Planetune), you have them for the rest of the game. Compa is present from the start. Nepgear doesn't have much part in the game, you can unlock her in the last chapters by fulfilling her plan and increasing Planeptune shares to 50%. When you unlock her, she is only lvl 1 too. Noire is part of your party in the early game, Spoiler  Re;birth 2: Iris Heart and Yellow Heart are absent from the game, no way of getting them. Nepgear and Compa are in your starting party. Noire is unlockable from chapter 5(late in the game).  There are no carry overs.  Making saves, well, Re;birth 1 right when you get into chapter 8, but I suggest going into new game+ since you want memory to unlock stuff. For Re;birth 2 you probably have to beat it 2 times(3ish for memory), for the normal route, you wanna save right before the normal ending final boss, you can grind out 7 endings from there. For your second playthrough you wanna save before ending chapter 5(fight with CFW Magic). I personally just beat the game 9 times, lol.  Every character that's available gains exp.  As far as I know for steam versions, yes, that's the way to get DLCs.  For my infos, no plans for GOTY editions and I don't think we gonna see Victory II on pc anytime soon or at all, it has only been 2 months since the game came out in Japan anyways."

gamindustri,3b75bn,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I walked by most of the enemies, besides, you can have a plan that insta kills them if you first strike common enemies. It takes about 2 hours to get through the NG+ and do the requirement for the ending."
gamindustri,3b75bn,Daverost,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:54:59 2015 UTC,You can turn on a plan called Symbol Destroy.    Instead of fighting too weak enemies it just kills them on the field without having to fight.   I usually don't do this as every battle in & out slowly brings up Lily Rank.

After getting the good ending, I reloaded my chapter 9 save to try and get the true ending.  The 6 events you need to find are in hidden dungeons which show Spoiler. You need to unlock the following dungeons using the remake system, but you'll need to find the plans first: Spoiler  So far I've gotten 5 out of the 6 events by unlocking the dungeons by activating the plans for each of the dungeons, but Spoiler seems particularly hard to get the materials to complete the plan since they're drops from a monster in another hidden dungeon, Spoiler, which I can't seem to find the plan for yet."
gamindustri,3b64o4,MagnetmanEXE,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:37:50 2015 UTC,"As a fellow reviewer (though I'm merely an amateur), I don't think you have to worry about the true ending too much if it's just for the sake of the review.

gamindustri,3b4x1a,RembrandtEpsilon,3,Fri Jun 26 00:18:18 2015 UTC,"Let's see, I'm currently lvl 999 on everyone(lol), doing the lvl 900+ colosseum. I don't tend to use human characters at the end, the CPUs just feel to be superior, going in HDD mode has a much bigger advantage later on. Plus the four goddess+Plutia and Peashy has the best end game gear. Compa is really nice to keep around, tho, she is an awesome healer and MAGES is quite good, since you don't have a strong magic damage dealer if you don't have Plutia, Vert needs some levels first to become strong magically.  Best strategy is probably what you are doing currently, just using rush until you have finishers and power attacks. I'm personally not using break attacks, since normal enemies tend to die to my power attacks, while for bosses, I feel it's a better way to spam rush and EXE attacks.  For my team I just use characters I like, I have: Vert-IF Neptune-Noire Plutia-Nepgear Vert works really well with Plutia, since Vert has INT boost, while Plutia has MEN decrease for enemies. Neptune is there to have a physical damage dealer, she has some really nice boosts and I think she has the highest physical attack in the team.  And hmmm, pro tips that I didn't know back then.... I guess try to get Drill chip, it fully heals(hp+sp) your character every time you activate HDD, kinda broken."
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Cater0mcf,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:02:06 2015 UTC,Damnnnn you've slayed this game.     Know any moves that are better equipped than others? Any discs configs that are baller?     I'm going to take you up on your advice and keep my eye out for the Drill Chip. Where do you grab it?
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Cater0mcf,2,Fri Jun 26 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"Well, for moves, for rush just go for the highest hit count, power I just use the highest cost ones. My leftovert points go to break attacks. For finishers, I try to get power ones mainly and I equip combo link too(it lets you attack again, but you lose a turn with that character), it's useful for finishing off opponents.  My favourite disc config is probably TPS(you are immune to status effect), Auto Save(you ignore enemy specials, like the high defence of robots), and Drill. When you are not doing colosseum(TPS is a must have there(lvl 900), since you pretty much lose if you get paralyzed or virused), you can always go for Bullet Hell, it shortens the wait between turns.  And where do you grab Drill: Neo-Geofront Depths Gather Shift ON  Naasne Volcano Depths   Gather Shift ON  Naasne Volcano  Gather Shift OFF      Here is a spreadsheet, so you can figure out where to get everything in the game."
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Mogarane,3,Fri Jun 26 11:53:06 2015 UTC,"I use Neptune, Noire, and Plutia in front and in the back use whoever lowers SP usage (or plus EXP if need more levels) or has a Coupling skill with Neptune. Then Break attacks till break meter is broken then spam SP and EX skills before it restores (i'll time my break for when everyone can attack in one turn). I almost never use rush unless that character has a better rush attack then power (IE. Vert or IF).  Ive never really used magic users because there normal attacks are usally shitty. Bosses are immune to some magic elements and iam to lazy to look up and remember what magic to use. Also up intil RE;birth magic users had no long range so you had to go up close and they would die too easily.  Protip is healing items are better then healing skills most of the time. Intil Plutia gets her 70% HP healing skill."
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Mogarane,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:09:13 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Who are considered magic users?    MAGES. since I've first gotten her seems really powerful and she has a longer ranger attack.
gamindustri,3b4x1a,stealthcl0wn,2,Fri Jun 26 04:07:47 2015 UTC,"Plutia, Compa, MAGES (or Rom and Ram if you wish to go for them) any one with INT as main stat (Vert uses both INT and STR so you could call her a ""magic class""). But Plutia is crazy because her main stat is INT and still has great damage/healing. IE. She can heal better then compa and do way better damage then she could ever do. Compa is different in the fact that she can cure status aliments but you can just use items to do that and save SP.  In Re;birth 1 you only have 3 party members in battle so its easy for the monster to go around and run to your ranged in the back and kill them. MAGES. Has a pretty low HP and defence stats. so you'll be wasting turns healing/rez and moving back into position when you could of just used one heal went back to doing damage.   Luckly in RE;birth 2 you have 4 party members. so using a long range is useful."
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Sedori,3,Fri Jun 26 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"Front:Back  Blanc:Compa Vert:Nepgear Uni:Noire  Spam Blanc's rush attack and then spam Vert and Uni's EXE drives. Swap back to Noire on occasion if I need to make the hurt even stronger.  It basically just boils down to rush and EXE spamming.  Equipment wise you want defensive items on Blanc and Offensive items on Vert/Uni.   IDea chips? EXE Drive related ones on everyone, really.  Spam spam spam away."
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Mogarane,2,Fri Jun 26 01:35:29 2015 UTC,Hah I'll keep spamming champ. Spam til the sun goes down.
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Sedori,3,Fri Jun 26 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"I use:  Vert - Anyone  Noire - Uni  Blanc - Rom/Ram  With this set-up Blanc tanks the Colosseum, while Vert and Noire DPS down the mobs.  The discs at end game help out plenty."
gamindustri,3b4x1a,Sedori,3,Fri Jun 26 01:45:22 2015 UTC,I see so many people use Blanc. Ive always found Blanc to be bad because her natural defensive stats (and low damage) are useless in the long run (in the ps3 games at end game everything hits you like a wet noddle).   Then again i've only plat'd the PS3 games and I don't know about 99+ colosseum stuff in re;birth 1+2.
gamindustri,3b4x1a,TheWayToGod,2,Fri Jun 26 05:09:16 2015 UTC,"Blanc has naturally high HP at 999, she has the highest health, so the Gradual HP effect is more effective on her.  The Colosseum 999 fights would easily two shot both Noire and Vert, it actually goes to the point if you position wrong the Clione or Vader would use a frontal breath attack and massacre everyone that isn't Blanc."
gamindustri,3b4x1a,chenohayo,2,Fri Jun 26 05:26:34 2015 UTC,That sounds like a dope team.... although you're missing Nep-Nep. A true cardinal sin.    What discs do you have setup? Recommended a disc config?

gamindustri,3b2k9k,Quivering_Star,6,Thu Jun 25 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting, Hyperdimension Neptunia doesn't seem to be in the store. Anyway, the games are not really in chronological order, the first and second game plays in different hyperdimension, while Victory plays in ultradimension and the second hyperdimension. But if you wanna go in order, for PS3, the first game was Hyperdimension Neptunia(which was kind of a disaster), then Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2, and the last one is Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory.  Things like Re;birth are the remakes of the first 3 games that were on PS3 for the Vita. Hyperdimension Neptunia U is a hack and slash spin-off for Vita, Producing Perfection is ummm, a rhythm game spin-off, and lastly Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart is Noire's own game and a strategy spin-off.  If you are interested in the series, I suggest buying this , 47 euros new for all the games on PS3 and free shipping(if you live in EU)"
gamindustri,3b2k9k,Cater0mcf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, since I don't have a Vita and my PC isn't gaming-oriented and for some reason the first game isn't available on the PSN, I'll have to settle with Mk2, Victory or a the Hypercollection/Trilogy thing, which is apparently only available in disc format, which defeats the purpose of wanting to buy a game during the PSN sale...  I'll have to investigate a bit more."
gamindustri,3b2k9k,Cater0mcf,3,Thu Jun 25 14:28:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the only game from the series on sale is Victory at the moment. Mk2 had its price reduced, so it's not as expensive as a full game. If you don't wanna get the trilogy and wanna get something from the PSN, I suggest Victory. It has the most advanced battle system, has the current share system too. Plus the set of characters are much more likeable with the goddesses fully around and Neptune being the lead. Mk2 got a lot of criticism, because Nepgear is unfunny and a boring main character and the CPU candidates are not as great of a characters as the CPUs."
gamindustri,3b2k9k,Cater0mcf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is starting to sound more clear to me.  So basically, the very first game is not that good and I can't buy it anyway, the remakes are out of reach since I only have a PS3 and a not very powerful computer, and Mk2 is better than the first but the characters and story are not very interesting.  So what you're saying is that Victory actually has the main characters instead of their Mk2 replacements and the gameplay is more polished, right?"
gamindustri,3b2k9k,ONLYUSEmeFEET,2,Thu Jun 25 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, Victory has the characters most of us love in the spotlight, has the refined soundtracks and gameplay. Only problem I find is that Iris Heart's voice is supposed to be alluring, but for some reason they didn't hit the hot sadist spot and she sounds angry instead, lol, thankfully it was fixed for the Re;birth games.  Edit: Oh yes, getting into the series, I suggest watching the anime too, it has 13 episodes and perfectly matches the humour and the air of the games. It's called Hyperdimention Neptunia Animation"
gamindustri,3b2k9k,Cater0mcf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:01:03 2015 UTC,Would I be good to watch the anime after beating Rebirth 2? I'm on PC so I have to wait a while for Rebirth 3.

The only game I've played before watching the anime was Re;birth 1 and I didn't feel that I've missed much not knowing the story of Mk2 and Victory.  There are some scenes that are exactly the same as the ones in the game, but instead of realising it while watching the anime, you gonna realise it while playing Re;birth 3."

gamindustri,3b2k9k,TheWayToGod,3,Thu Jun 25 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"There's really no continuity in the series (With the exception of Victory 1 and 2) as every game takes place in a different dimension, so you can jump in at any point. That said, it's generally better to jump in at Re;Birth 1 as the gameplay of the first few isn't exactly great."
gamindustri,3b2k9k,Rajaxx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:15:36 2015 UTC,"It looks like Rebirth 1 is only on PS Vita, and as I said in my edit, I'm pretty much confined to PS3.  Failing the continuity thing, which would be the best to get introduced to the series with?"
gamindustri,3b2k9k,greatfinn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:20:43 2015 UTC,"Really? The original is probably my favorite, although I haven't played Victory yet."
gamindustri,3b2k9k,gametempest,3,Fri Jun 26 21:59:35 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for chronological order in terms of Story, Mk2 > Victory > Victory II (PS4) fall in line with each other story wise.  The way that Hyperdimension Neptunia PS3 ended with its True Ending made it not possible to do an actual Story for the series afterwards, so they had to reboot the Story with Mk2.  Even though the First game is not great at all when it comes to its Gameplay, I would still recommend it if you find it cheap mainly for the Dialogue and Story alone. These games are great for its story and humorous dialogue.  Also, don't watch the Animation until you have played Mk2 and Victory. The Animation itself takes place in a different dimension, but they use elements from mk2 and Victory (mostly Victory) that will spoil or make you confused if you have not played the Games. Once you play the games, watch the Animation and the OVA and it should make sense to you."
gamindustri,3b2k9k,greatfinn,2,Thu Jun 25 15:08:28 2015 UTC,"Hyperdimension Neptunia is the first game, but i don't recommend it. It's basically an accepted fact that the battle system is terrible. The remake is Re;Birth 1, which is only available for PC and Vita. If you don't mind a broken battle system, Hyperdimension Neptunia is pretty hilarious  BUT, the first game and the rest happens in different dimensions, so the events that happened in the first game may not apply to the second and third game, so there isn't one that's the first in the series in a timeline sense"
gamindustri,3b2k9k,PraiseYuri,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my PC isn't good for games and I don't have a Vita, I'm limited to PS3. I think I'm actually limited to Mk2 and Victory. What's the difference between these?"
gamindustri,3b2k9k,Death200X,2,Thu Jun 25 14:23:12 2015 UTC,"The first concept that must be understood is that most of these games take place in alternate/parallel universes/dimensions, so while the characters basically stay the same, there is not much in the way of actual story continuity. That being said, there are still better and worse places to start with this series.  Okay, there are a lot of spin offs in this series. I'm not going to tackle them. Start with a main series game. I'm also only going to tackle the main series that's been released in English.  The main series is:   Hyperdimension Neptunia (no subtitle), then Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2, then Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory. There is a minor level of continuity going from mk2 to Victory.  These have their respective remake counterparts for Vita/PC: Rebirth 1, Rebirth 2 Sisters Generation, and Rebirth 3 V Century.  People usually recommend starting the Rebirth 1. This is because the original Hyperdimension Neptunia had a very different battle system than mk2, Victory, or the remakes (which all basically use Victory's battle system). Additionally, some people say the original was rough around the edges. I can't comment personally on this, but I can vouch that Rebirth 1 is a good place to start (where I basically started). Of course, the issue is that you lack a capable PC / a Vita.  If you wanted to start chronologically at the start where there is some level of continuity, mk2 would be the way to go. Even knowing all the games though, I'm at a loss. mk2/ rebirth 2 focuses primarily on a different cast of characters (as the remake's title implies, the sisters of the original cast), so I'm not sure if this is the best place to start if you have no clue about the people. The key part this series cherishes is character interaction IMO."
gamindustri,3b2k9k,reallygoodbee,2,Thu Jun 25 14:27:34 2015 UTC,"Mk2 and Victory are on the same timeline more or less, but spoiler Just watch a playthrough of the first one, then get mk2 for the Conquest Ending, and Victory for the improved battle system"

I love the change from shares being a zero sum game, but losing them for transforming or being hit is silly.  That said starting NG+ and retaining levels makes it extremely easy to keep shares at max. Love the NG+ features this time around.  Edit: oops, do you know what, aside from PR and quests, increases shares? Just beating enemies with a CPU? Are there english patch notes anywhere?"

gamindustri,3ardas,Graynigma,5,Mon Jun 22 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"Note: This War of Mine is a 2014 war survival video game focusing on the civilian experience of war.  The game allows the player to use a custom character portrait so I couldn’t help it. The character biographies are largely irrelevant since I just chose from a very limited selection of game-given preset personas which I felt were most appropriate. I had just stolen from an elderly couple using my primary scavenger character (Neptune) since we were running out of food. When Neptune got back, the reactions made me feel so guilty that I had to stop playing. Take this with a grain of salt, but I thought their reactions were vaguely similar to how they would probably actually react so I felt it was worth sharing."

I bought this way back during the sale but didn't play until yesterday :P"
gamindustri,3aqgf5,Kent93,2,Mon Jun 22 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"If you got a PS3, I would definitely say get Victory, and then get Re;Birth3 when it comes out so you can compare (even if it's the same game) which dialogue you like more per say.  I have not touched Re;Birth2 myself until tomorrow, but if that and Re;Birth3 are like Re;Birth1, then you'll be hearing a lot of the same music Re;Birth1 has from Mk2 and some from Victory, which is a shame, because Victory is chalk full of great music, most of it which wasn't used in Re;Birth1.  Plus, if you have not watched the Animation yet and the OVA, or even if you have, you could play Victory, go for the True Ending (which is possibly the easiest True Ending to get in the series,) and then you can watch the Animation again for every thing to make more sense if the end didn't make sense, if you get what I mean.  A little tip for Victory if you decide to get it before Re;Birth3, and you decide to pursue the True Ending route: Do a lot of quests, Share transferring, Scouting, Killing, and one other thing I can't remember. After Chapter 1, there is a Review Score series after each chapter. If you do very well on it, you can get Large Medals, which will give an Event in Planeptune for a Game Disc. You can get them from certain Strong Enemies later on VIA the Scouting System, but the Events stop popping up after a certain point. True Ending's Final Boss is ridiculously hard / annoying to do if you're under Level 70 / 75 without Game Discs. I thought Hyperdimension Neptunia PS3's True Ending Final Boss was the worst difficulty wise, but Victory's True Ending took the cake there."

gamindustri,3aqgf5,ginginator901,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"From what I have noticed with all the games (Plus what I have seen posted often in Re;Birth2 Steam Discussion,) Re;Birth1 and Hyperdimension Neptunia PS3 were different in many ways (Obviously we all know this but I am still pointing it out with this post,) Mk2 and Re;Birth2 are not really that different at all aside from how they don't use CGI all the time, along with the extra ending Re;Birth2 gets, and I guess Re;Birth3 and Victory are the same as well, but Re;Birth3 also has extra combat stuff and whatever else has been revealed.  Either way though, it's always fun to play both the originals and the Remakes to see how different they are, along with seeing what dialogue people prefer. The Console's localization was done by NISA while the Vita / PC was done by IFI (who also has NISA's Translator among their team.) Dialogue wise, while Re;Birth1 was good, I preferred the Console's dialogue better. It just seems like some people hate the Re;Birth dialogue because they haven't touched the Console Versions."

I made it to Uzume's hideout place (I guess it's her hideout) and then went straight to the big boos who 2 hit killed me.  I may be getting ahead of myself but is it possible to transform into Next Purple?    Thanks for any assistance you can provide!
gamindustri,3ao6p7,ginginator901,2,Mon Jun 22 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"1). Yep! Toy around in the PS4 accessibility settings.  2).

Backtrack on the map and there should be a red exclamation point on one of the squares. Go to that, there are a few cutscenes, mini boss, you unlock everyone, and then you can grind a bit in other areas to help you beat the boss. Hope this helps."

gamindustri,3alj61,lovethecomm,4,Sun Jun 21 11:42:16 2015 UTC,"Some enemies are resistant to physical but not magic (usually machine-type stuff), which is what Plutia's attacks are. So normally Plutia will do more damage than Neptune in this case. You can counteract this by giving Neptune Ignore Category/Ignore Enemy Traits through Idea Chips or Coupling effect. Verbal Abuse gives a MEN debuff, which is magic defense, so it will make her attacks do more."

They'll also give their spew of dialogue during the Thank You after the credits. If you enjoy the game enough the first time around, it might motivate you to play it more, even go for all the Steam Achievements.  As far as if they are good in battle, I never used them, but from what I have heard, either Ram or Rom makes doing the Level 900 Colosseum DLC missions a lot easier and not as frustrating."

Nepgear and Ram & Rom are definitely worth getting. Uni, not so much.

gamindustri,3ag3fm,Teapo64,2,Sun Jun 21 12:02:22 2015 UTC,"1.) Compa, because then she would not have to worry about growing up and dying one day while Neptune remains un-aged due to being a Goddess, so they'll be friends forever! (Poor IF will get shafted unless she finds a way to become a CPU too.)  2.) Since the Animation happens in a different dimension, has some stuff from Mk2, and a good amount of spoilers for Victory, I would say either a continuation of Victory (From the OVA Ending) where Peashy and Plutia are more involved as well, along with some stuff from one or two of the Dimensions explored in Victory II, or maybe all of them. I would hope it would be 24 episodes instead of 12 for the Second Season (I'm fine with 12 + an OVA but I want more Nep-Nep and co.) Or a Second Season that follows Victory II similarly but is different.  3.) N/A, I can't really think of one.  4.) Hahaha! First roll was Plutia, second roll was Neptune. What a great combo since I just played Victory a couple weeks ago."

This month was the month that Plutia and Peashy were to visit.  Of course, not many people could blame Neptune for her behavior. Plutia was her wife-of-sorts, and together Peashy was their child. Of course Neptune had to pay them 100% attention, she'd be a terrible wife and mother if she didn't!  If only she applied the same work ethic towards Planeptune and her real sister, though."

The twins did it often. Sometimes one of them, sometimes both of them. Neptune, whenever she was here and sleepy, did it often. On the rare occasion where she'd had a bit much wine, even Mina had winded up in her bed.  But never had she expected to wake up sleeping besides... herself?  Yet that was the sight she was treated to when she opened her eyes.   Ultradimension Blanc had somehow ended up in her bed, with her arms wrapped firmly around her waist.  Blanc couldn't quite say the situation was unpleasant. She was soft to cuddle, and her counterpart's hair had a very pleasant scent. She looked sooooooo cute when she slept too.  She froze for a moment.   ""Oh my god, am I becoming a narcissist?""  Her thoughts were derailed by the sound of her other self yawning loudly. Was she waking up? Oh god, was she even AWARE of the fact she was cuddling herself?  Blanc sat up and rubbed her eyes, and her other self followed suite, albeit slowly.  ""Blanc... uh, me?"" asked the other Blanc.  Before she could answer, other Blanc followed up with a handful of words that shook Blanc to her core.  ""I can read the narration."""

I was not using DLC characters and was actively avoiding grinding in the first parts of the game, yet defeating them was easy and they are very common in that zone.

If it was 3x23 that would make it stronger than Mega D-Drive (69 vs 56), which it definitely is not. Just try it out yourself and see.  For building EXE, hit count is all that matters, but rush attacks always build faster, even if a non-rush attack does the same number of hits."
gamindustri,3af412,ginkaa,2,Fri Jun 19 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. So to set things straight, total power is multiplied by the amount of hits? I read somewhere that power doesn't scale with hits which confused me, what you said made much more sense."
gamindustri,3af412,Craunva,3,Fri Jun 19 16:58:30 2015 UTC,"Wait a sec, I was also under the assumption that ""power"" was static and not multiplied by hits but guard damage -was- multiplied by hits. I believe the game said so itself, so if power is 48 and you attack 5 times it's only 48 if all 5 hit but the guard damage being 70 is multiplied by hit so it's 350.  I think OP had it all right."

So I've spent the last few days reverse-engineering the game's database format resulting in the link.  DLC dungeons/items/monsters aren't included but it should be fairly trivial to add them later. I also plan on making a dump for Rebirth1 but there are some differences in the database format that I need to look into before I do that."
gamindustri,39zvmw,blind_guy23,2,Tue Jun 16 03:21:15 2015 UTC,This is great. It's not hard finding these lists but a lot are either incomplete or some of the names are off. One for Rebirth1 would be equally fantastic. Thanks!

Hell, even loading up Mk2 or even Re;Birth2 will make me think of it again (even more so for Re;Birth2, because I want to play it to see how IFI handled the Translations, and i'm going to be doing the Conquest Ending for that again any way on stream ;_;)"

gamindustri,39zf9j,qchto,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:00:59 2015 UTC,"Story Wise, there is a lot more events / chirpers that happen in the Original HDN. I actually like the PS3 HDN Games better myself, because I personally think NISA did a better job with the translation / having funny dialogue, whereas IFI, while they're great for giving us the Remakes, is kinda hit or miss (Re;Birth1 was good, but from what I saw on Steam's Discussion Board, in Re;Birth2, they made Neptune look like a complete idiot, which saddens me.)  Gameplay wise.... Oh boy... All the HDN Games have an Animation Skip key. Some people like to use it, some don't. The Combat in this game makes you want to use it all the time (The combat is not that great at all.) Very slow-paced, and the Item System is so that you have a % chance of using an Item as you Attack, Defend, or do any Action. The Difficulty is also really stupid too. You can do most of the game underleveled actually (As I have done it,) but when I got to the Final Boss when I was somewhere under Level 50, the fight was so one-sided, that I had to go out and grind up to about 65 in order to actually do the Final Boss (You can still get screwed, especially on the Item System if it decides to proc one of your Lesser heals instead of a Heal that works when you are at 50% or 30% HP.)   Gameplay wise, I don't think the first one is worth it. Story and Dialogue wise though, as with all the HDN Games, it is really good. I would say the game is worth $15, unless you manage to find it cheaper elsewhere (none of the places like 2nd & Charles or Disc Replays had it at all, and the only place I could get it from cheap was at Gamestop.)"
gamindustri,39zf9j,Rajaxx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:07:29 2015 UTC,I'm not from the US so as you made it sound I think I'll get it asap. Thanks for your reply!

I thought the editor from NISA did the translation for re;birth 2. Definitely not the same one to whoever did re;birth 2, or unless you're referring to something else, then nvm because I'm probably one of those who doesn't enjoy those kind of ""unique"" translation."
gamindustri,39zf9j,Rajaxx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know who all six members of IFI's team are, nor do I know where they came from prior to forming it. I only know that NISA is not a part of the Remakes because they had a falling out with IF / IFI a long while ago, so they have nothing to do with the series anymore except for the HDN Games on the PS3."
gamindustri,39zf9j,Daverost,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:20:28 2015 UTC,"The editor for the Nep series under NISA started his own company. He's been working under contract on various IFI releases. R;B2 may have been one of them. Noire's game and Nep U definitely were.  He's still got his hands in the series.  Also, IFI in general is made of ex-NISA employees."
gamindustri,39zf9j,Rajaxx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:37:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for letting me know. I actually forgot to look into it after I had posted 2 days ago. I wonder then if people have not played the Console versions, or if they just don't like the dialogue in general. I've been seeing a lot of people who liked Re;Birth1 bitch on the Re;Birth2 Discussion Boards how they hate the Translation.  EDIT: Okay, i'm standing by the assumption that those people on the Steam Board never touched the PS3 games, and that's why they are hating on Re;Birth2, because they weren't used to that guy's Translations for the Dialogue."
gamindustri,39zf9j,Daverost,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, R;B2's script is definitely better than mk2's, which is why I can't remember for sure if Nick Doerr had a hand in that one or not. But it's also definitely not as good as R;B1's was. R;B1's still had a good English flow with localized references, but the script and characters weren't altered with such a heavy hand. Neither are nearly as bad as Noire/Nep U, though.  But just because I forgot to mention it, Nick's new company is Mr. Tired Media. He started it up upon leaving NISA after finishing his work on Nep PP."
gamindustri,39xqpm,Mysterius,7,Mon Jun 15 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"And just like that, I realize that you really shouldn't buy a game until it's daily."

Though Steam does now offer refunds for games up to two weeks after purchase and played less than two hours: http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/    They explicitly allow refunds due to sales, too:     We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price."
gamindustri,39xqpm,MegamanZen,4,Mon Jun 15 18:14:37 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I gifted the game. Oh well. I only spent like 6 more dollars on a game for someone else to enjoy Nep Nep anyways.

gamindustri,39xqpm,Tjoeb123,4,Mon Jun 15 17:39:42 2015 UTC,I'm guessing this was the milestone for hitting 15B clicks in the monster game?

gamindustri,39xqpm,Vulpix0r,6,Mon Jun 15 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just saw as I was logging in to see if the milestone was unlocked or not.  It wasn't, which is a shame since the 3 associated tags were Anime, RPG, and Turn-Based.  That means it could've been Neptunia, Agarest, Valkyria Chronicles, Ys/LoH, or even Final Fantasy IV.  Doesn't matter anyways because I already own all the CH games and VC on Steam.  Still would've been sweet to see an extended sale on them, though. :)"

gamindustri,39w1b7,RembrandtEpsilon,5,Mon Jun 15 06:52:27 2015 UTC,"Highly unlikely that Blanc + Neptune will be ported to PC because I believe it has local ad hoc multiplayer. So either they remove the multiplayer altogether (which also removes the unique selling point of the game) or they replace it with online multiplayer (which would take a lot of time and budget), neither of which are good options."
gamindustri,39w1b7,ginkaa,4,Mon Jun 15 11:48:51 2015 UTC,"Noire has been registered to the ESRB for PC, but IFI has stated that it's only a precaution and they have no plans to port it.

gamindustri,39w1b7,ginginator901,5,Tue Jun 16 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. I just don't think enough people would buy them for the effort they put into them.

I think the reason they're only releasing the rebirth games are to attract JRPG fans, I don't think those people would buy the spin offs unless they get into the series like the rest of us."

Also if you managed to see one of the chirper events in your previous playthrough (they are usually just Nepgear talking to somebody not pictured on the screen) then you don't need to hit the share prerequisite a second time as the events will just appear.  The above conditions apply to both Conquest and Holy Sword endings with the only difference is that Nepgear needs a lily rank of 8 or above with all characters to get the Holy Sword ending; if that final condition is not met then it's the Conquest ending."
gamindustri,3936h1,silverhydra,2,Mon Jun 8 22:51:46 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the conformation :D
gamindustri,3936h1,dieth,2,Mon Jun 8 23:11:04 2015 UTC,So if my lily rank is 8+ with all chars I can't get conquest anymore?
gamindustri,3936h1,silverhydra,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, you'd go right along to the Holy Sword ending if you picked up all the characters.  The only possible workaround I can think of is just to not pick up Falcom or Caves, since PCB automatically joins your party at the end of a chapter (and she does have dialogue in the Conquest ending). You're going to get CC2, Marvy, and Tekken when getting the CPUs (they also have some dialogue in the Conquest ending) but if you forget Falcom or Caves then the condition of having a 8+ lily rank with all characters cannot be met.  I haven't tried this though, so unsure if it would work."
gamindustri,3936h1,retnuh8,3,Tue Jun 9 13:54:07 2015 UTC,"You can manipulate the events, even if you're at lily 8. If you get 50% shares and don't visit the city to get the maker for that zone, when you next visit the city it ALWAYS prioritizes the CPU. By doing this, you can guarantee the conquest ending (assuming you don't do anything dumb like visit the city a second time!)."
gamindustri,3936h1,Inkerius,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"I also wanted to know who gives you the event and around what time (beginning, middle, end) the events appear during the chapter(I forgot to ask this in my post :P)"

If you have Neptune as Leader, you'll want her mainly Defending while every one else attacks him, since whoever is Leader will end up getting enemy aggro for the most part. Iris Heart's EXE Drive is also very effective against him and other Mech enemies / bosses (I'm sure you know that already though.)  Out of curiousity, but do you plan on going for True Ending?"

Take the Twitch link as you will, but I have to start linking to fights and whatnot I did, because unfortunately, people that played Mk2 or Re;Birth1 are extremely stupid and say that you need to be Level 70 - 75+ or whatnot for the Normal / True Ending final bosses for example, when i've done them at much lower levels, along with saying I am full of shit when I post that I did them at average / below average levels.

Do you really want to send a whole new character or two through the exact same missions, or would you rather a whole new game to play through?  Also, most of the reason that here in america there is no ""Post launch support"" is that the game has already been out awhile in Japan, and got all its DLC by the time it came out here. So instead of staggering the DLCs post American launch, they just provide it all at once.  For the record, PP received (free) costume DLCs, Noire has character DLCs and possibly a bit more, NepU has mission DLCs. So its not like the spin offs received no DLC what so ever."
gamindustri,3948uf,Misha_Aeval,3,Tue Jun 9 13:35:26 2015 UTC,"I see them more like filling the gap before VII came out. It's relatively ""cheap"" to hop on the idol and fighting train to make something."

gamindustri,3948uf,Daverost,2,Tue Jun 9 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"Nep U 2 is more likely since it's practically already been announced (Blanc's game runs on the same engine and is being made by Tamsoft again).  I'd rather have new games than DLC for existing games.  Did you play any of the post-game stuff in Nep U, at least? There's not a whole lot in the way of story, but there's at least more dialogue and content.  But really, Compile Heart farms these side games out to other developers (Tamsoft, Felistella, and Sting so far) so that they can focus on their main titles. I'm honestly thrilled that they dedicate enough creative resources to the projects to be able to bring us several new games a year. It's a model that most devs won't follow (I can't even think of any others that do) and that's why they're not super gung ho about creating any additional DLC when they could just as easily have a brand new game for you within a half year. And it's honestly better this way."
gamindustri,38ykjp,Ghostly95,5,Sun Jun 7 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"Little backstory here: There are gamestops are my area that sell ""new"" copies that have their cases opened and still sell them at full price. I really didn't want to be ripped if I was going to pay for it. So I looked it up and drove an hour from my town to obtain this baby, I know I could have just ordered one online but I had a gamestop gift card that helped me get this at a steal. Can't wait to jump in :D  -Also a side note some of my local retro game stores were sold out of Neptunia U copies, only having the limited edition!"
gamindustri,38ykjp,Zilveari,4,Sun Jun 7 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"That's not just ""your area"".  It is all Gamestops, and all game-only shops.  It's called gutting, and it is so that they can put the cases on the shelf without worrying about anyone stealing them.  They immediately put the guts into bags and seal them at the good stores...  At the bad stores they might throw the guts on the counter for awhile, or take them home and play them.    EDIT: BTW just because it is shrinkwrapped doesn't mean it hasn't been opened.  A number of Gamestop stores have shrinkwrapping machines in the back..."

gamindustri,38ykjp,alex1is2bored3,2,Mon Jun 8 01:52:46 2015 UTC,How do you get ripped by them having taken the plastic wrap off?
gamindustri,38ykjp,Daverost,4,Mon Jun 8 00:54:22 2015 UTC,"If the game is on a disk, you risk scratches and fingerprints on it. When the wrap is taken off the case, that leaves just the case itself to put all of GameStop's stickers on, which can often be a pain to take off and cause permanent damage to the case, making it much less presentable if you're into that kind of thing. There's also the possibility that the store worker putting the game back into the case will give you the wrong game. I was one time given Hyperdimension Neptunia PP inside of a Re;Birth 2 case."
gamindustri,38ykjp,Tjoeb123,2,Mon Jun 8 04:55:55 2015 UTC,"I had a friend buy one of the IMOQ series of .hack games for PS2 back in the day.

gamindustri,38ykjp,kakigori,2,Sun Jun 7 23:14:25 2015 UTC,Just because it isn't shrink-wrapped doesn't mean it's used. I've literally had them put on the tape in front of me on release day when I picked up Sly Collection on vita. It's just a stupid thing they don't do for less popular games.

For main character theme's it's Nepgear's."
gamindustri,38xhiw,silverhydra,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:40:16 2015 UTC,My favorite is Victory's credit song. Forgot the name but i still listen to it all the time. Second runner is Re;birth 1's opening song.

gamindustri,38ysn4,stealthcl0wn,4,Mon Jun 8 12:33:50 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem with the game is the lack of Neptune as the main character, and yes I'm sure that's the complaint everyone has, but it's not just a case of personal preference.    Yep. That's the biggest problem. Neptune is better way MC than what she might look like at first. Nepgear on the other hand feels like your average harem anime MCs. She's so bland in mk2/rebirth2 that the devs made her in to some kind of robotics otaku in the later games so she would stand out a bit more. And about the story. They indeed tried to make it more serious and thus it's not as fun as the first rebirth but the first rebirth differs wastly from the first neptunia game while rebirth2 and mk2 are almost the same. The newer games are all better because of what they've learned and the budgets grew.   Oh and mk2/rebirth2 also has arguably the most memoriable event in all of the games, though you'll probably miss it on your first playthrough if you're doing it without guides."
gamindustri,38ysn4,zeppo3k,3,Mon Jun 8 00:49:19 2015 UTC,Now you are making me curious. What's the most memorable event in Re;birth 2?  On the topic my subjective  downsides:   repetitive Underling fights less comedy no Nep-Nep Noire is not a loner anymore Financier was one of my favourites in RB1
gamindustri,38ysn4,Capafe,3,Mon Jun 8 14:25:47 2015 UTC,Conquest ending
gamindustri,38ysn4,zeppo3k,3,Mon Jun 8 22:12:23 2015 UTC,"Of the main series Neptunia games I have played, I rate them Victory>Re;birth 1>Re;birth 2.  Rebirth 2 nailed down the game play, but I feel the CPU candidates were not as memorable as the actual CPUs. I like Nepgear as a character, but not as a lead since her traits can be ""generic"" especially when brought to the spotlight. Also, the recurring grunt girl gets kind of repetitive and tiresome, wasn't a fan of her.   Overall, Rebirth 2 is the my least liked game in the series because of its weaker characters, but it's an alright game 7/10 at most. Luckily this is the only game starring the CPU candidates so they don't get too stale to play as."
gamindustri,38ysn4,PraiseYuri,3,Mon Jun 8 00:42:32 2015 UTC,"Ponytail Falcom > Non-Ponytail Falcom  Reading from the Manga to flesh out the characters a bit more, even Nepgear herself says that she just follows her sister.  Neptune is a much better protagonist, but I'm hoping for future games ... her translation isn't as bad like how it is in R;B2.  With that said I fully enjoyed both Re;birth 1 and 2."
gamindustri,38ysn4,Sedori,3,Mon Jun 8 01:49:04 2015 UTC,"I said the exact same thing to my friend last night, so I guess I'm not the only one who thought that re;birth 1 is more fun than re;birth 2.       The 4P player system sure is neat compared to 3P in re;birth 1 (and the EVENT thing on info tab), but story wise, it's rather bland. (There's lack of humor and references, but I believe it's because the story tone being rather serious.)           As for the translation (I'm using JP voice btw), it feels like whoever translated it (definitely not the same person who did re;birth 1. If it is, I'd be shocked) took too much liberty on translating the scripts, which made it sounds too wacky and not as enjoyable to read.       I still enjoyed it nevertheless, but I'm hoping that re;birth 3 will be better compared to this one.                Is it just me or the game is more fps laggy compared to re;birth 1 when you enter any dungeons (during mobs spawn). not like it affects much though.."
gamindustri,38ysn4,koromokokoro,3,Mon Jun 8 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, without Neptune as main character game is less neppable, but I also feel like they made Nep even dumber than in the first game. Like, this time she really is an idiot, instead of being just a fun girl who can joke about everything because nothing ever can go wrong."
gamindustri,38ysn4,LeBeines,3,Mon Jun 8 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Re;Birth 2 simply isn't as funny as Re;Birth 1 because the characters feel more shallow.  From what I've seen of Victory though, it appears that a lot of Victory's humor comes from poking a lot of fun at Mk.2, especially Nepgear. Speaking of, Nepgear isn't necessarily a bad character, but she can't really take the lead because her main character trait is that she's so blatantly generic, that it makes her stand out in a series full of whackos."
gamindustri,38ysn4,Zextillion,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:48:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say a lot of the humor comes from poking at Nepgear, per say. If any thing, that's only part of it. It's still strong in the Humor department without the parts that poke fun of her,  True Ending route also has some funny bits added as well."
gamindustri,38ysn4,Rajaxx,3,Mon Jun 8 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"I've only got the stellas dungeon achievement to complete and then I've got the platinum achievement.   My opinion so far is the same as everyone else here, the gameplay in re;birth 2 is very solid and enjoyable but the characters and writing is a lot weaker than re;birth 1. Overall I enjoyed the characters in re;birth 1 a lot more but I prefer the gameplay of re;birth 2. I can only hope re;birth 3 delivers."
gamindustri,38ysn4,Sechuraniam,2,Mon Jun 8 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"Well, IIRC a bunch of people were complaining about how overly light hearted and silly the first HDN game was so IF/CH made Mk2 more serious, mostly just to show they could. Then people bitched about the darker side of the story, hence the Holy Sword ending in R;B2, which I don't think Mk2 had. (Though I may be wrong on that one.) Personally, I enjoyed the story in R;B2, but not as much as the story in R;B1. Though, R;B2 has some REALLY awesome and memorable moments.  The biggest problem with the CPU Candidates was that they tried to make backseat/supporting characters the mains.. I mean look at them: Nepgear just kinda does whatever Neptune does and is really down on herself but not as bad as Uni, Uni has a serious sister complex and is always whining about not being as good as Noire, Rom just follows Ram around, and Ram being very vocal and borderline spastic is probably the most interesting one of the four. Don't get me wrong, I love the CPU Candidates but I don't think they're quite Main Character material."
gamindustri,38ysn4,Flamesblade4,2,Mon Jun 8 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"Only about 10 hours in but i completely agree that not having Neptune as a main character is definitely a detriment. Another criticism I have would be the enemy and equipment models. I feel that there were too many recycled enemies and equipments but then again, Im only 10 hours in and hopefully this will change later on. Although I will say that the animation quality overall has increased which is particularly noticeable with the jump animation (Neptunes jump animation drove me crazy in RB1)."

I've finished all the Enemy Limit quests except the Blanc and Uni one, and you don't get anything for any of them. I don't know if there's a reward for doing all of them, but there probably isn't."
gamindustri,38y712,petalferrous,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"I had to max out their Lily Rank for the x2 exe drive fill rate. With that I was able to keep slicing away at the regular mobs as Purple Heart without the gauge depleting (equipment was max kit EX, heat gauntlet, eternal gear). Whenever I was moving room to room I would switch to regular Dengekiko to preserve Nep's HDD. When it came to the room with all of the New-Gen Mechs I tried to lure as many as I could to the previous room one by one (they get stuck trying to pass through the hallways). After I defeated a few with that method I used SP skills as Dengekiko and then finished them with her exe skill. The last room I rounded up all of the bosses and killed them all with Nep's exe skill (pretty much the only way). All that was left was the last DTT-mech boss, but compared to everything else it's nothing. Spent a good 10 minutes whaling on it since I had no more transformations.  tl;dr Take advantage of switching, max your lily ranks, and use your exe skills wisely.   Sucks that there probably isn't anything outside of a trophy for beating them"

gamindustri,38vu0i,LiSiKai,6,Sun Jun 7 06:48:37 2015 UTC,RB2 takes place in an alternate dimension. So same characters but alternate versions of those characters.   I haven't played it but from what I understand this becomes more important in Victory/RB3 onwards.

gamindustri,38vu0i,Rajaxx,4,Mon Jun 8 04:11:48 2015 UTC,"It's because the first game does not fall in line story-wise, plus it is also in a different dimension compared to Mk2, so the Compa and IF in the Mk2 Dimension do not know any of the other characters from the first game (Even though Nisa hints at meeting them before early on.)"
gamindustri,38vu0i,reallygoodbee,2,Sun Jun 7 06:53:45 2015 UTC,"Neptunia 1's True Ending didn't allow for continuation outside of either scrapping the cast and starting over with new characters, or rebooting the series. They decided it would be better to just reboot with Neptunia mk2, so it ended up having nothing to do with Neptunia 1. However, Neptunia Victory is a sequel to mk2, and picks up a few years after it leaves off.  Rebirth 1, Rebirth 2, and Rebirth 3 are remakes of those games, so they follow suit."

Everyone else is good, though. In particular, Noire's VA has been doing a great job. I think the direction isn't always as good as in the games, but overall it's a great dub. Also, I feel like Histoire's voice is noticeably better than in the game even though she has the same VA."

For Uni, she generally has her voice, but her mannerisms and inflections weren't present. But Compa and Linda sound like they weren't even trying. Makes me sad since Uni and Compa are my top two.

gamindustri,38nnj5,Kenny99m,5,Fri Jun 5 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"R;B1 and R;B2 aren't directly linked by plot in any way. The second game was a reboot of the series and while the remake of the first looked like it might have been trying to tie the two together, they didn't really go anywhere with it when the remake of the second came out. Feel free to play them in whatever order.  As far as going for platinum, you'll need a guide to get all of the endings. They're primarily based on your share distribution, so you'll need to know which combinations give which endings. Other than that, I don't think there's anything else that you'd really need a guide for, though you may want to check around and see if there are any missables. I don't think there were any, but I can't say there aren't with confidence. It couldn't hurt to have a guide for grindy trophies to make those easier on you.  I didn't really buy any DLC for the game, but if you want some ridiculously overpowered items, you can pick up the free stuff."

It's great to pick up and play though.

I have to say though, If you don't care that much about spoilers knowing about the ending requirements beforehand would help a lot for the eventual platinum trophy. There is one in particular that gets trickier to get in later playthroughs, although it's never truly locked out as people seem to believe. Also, the Stella's Dungeon trophy can be quite cruel and a truly massive timesink without the helper DLC. Even with it, it's by far the most time-consuming one IIRC, progress through the minigame at every opportunity. Order of the two first titles doesn't really matter, there are few significant gameplay differences and they are on distinct continuities."
gamindustri,38nnj5,lpchaim,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the long response ! If I understood correctly, one requirement for the ""Conquest"" is to have Nepgear with a lily rank lower than 4 for all characters, right ? Is it the one that gets trickier ? If so, how is it not locked out if you have a lily rank over 4 ? The lily rank between Nepgear and If is at 5 for me, so I'd appreciate it if you told me. :)"
gamindustri,38nnj5,wresd123,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad to be of help! Yes, that's the one. The general idea is the superseding events won't trigger if even one of the ""main"" Makers  isn't recruited, and there is a way to not get them while advancing the story. I'll just drop the quote from the trophy guide's author here:     Contrary to popular belief, it is still possible to max out Lily Ranks with everyone and still earn the Conquest Ending. This is achieved by recruiting the goddesses, but not recruiting the makers Cyberconnect2, MarvelousAQL and Tekken. To avoid recruiting these makers, do not increase shares in Lastation, Lowee, or Leanbox to over 30% in Chapter 4. When you get to Chapter 5, raise one land's share to 50% to recruit the goddess. The goddess recruiting event takes priority over the maker recruiting event, so only view the first event to avoid recruiting either Cyberconnect2, MarvelousAQl, or Tekken. As long as you don't recruit all of these 3 characters, you can still get the Conquest Ending.     It's worth reading through what he has to say if you don't mind slight spoilers, and it would seem you don't haha. Also, do take a look at the one about Stella's Dungeon while you're at it. Might make you consider the DLC pack, I know it did for me.    EDIT: I'm on mobile, so sorry if this came out a bit weird. Feel free to ask for clarifications."

The drop rate isn't so bad most I had to kill was one three times to get a medal drop.   The Large Medal page linked above lists all zones / Monster name that drops them.   I got all medals/disks by simply going through all zones and downing the rare & tough mobs, checking for any medals available from quests at the guild completing those, and the same for the Colosseum fights.  The easiest way to get a zone to flag is to send all scouts to the same zone, enter it, and then exit (Travelling to the zone itself turns the same amount of days the scouts need to complete).   Go thru the reports all the scouts and only choose to believe the scout that tells you I found a way to make stronger monsters appear, or I found a way to change the enemy locations.   After downing the mob, change the flag and repeat.  I cannot remember, but there may be some medals that drop off the boss type monsters that exist in the zone already w/o any scouts. (They were probably a quest kill, and the quest resulted in a medal).  Again you do not directly get discs from the monsters.

gamindustri,38jqbr,Taedirk,4,Thu Jun 4 18:23:52 2015 UTC,"I really wish all the irrelevant chirpers can be turned off in new game+ and all the chirpers that give you things you already have (I don't need fortify enemies 5 times thanks) could also be turned off :/   Welcome to the club.  New Game+ is not something Nep games do well.  As for the plans, I believe they all show up during Chapter 2 and you can ignore things after that (as long as you don't care about the MB boosts)."
gamindustri,38jqbr,Sedori,2,Thu Jun 4 19:00:07 2015 UTC,When im running through a new game+ cycle it feels like I spend more time talking to chirpers than actually playing the game until I reach the point I wanted to get to.  I remember which chirpers hand out MB so I'll just grab them and only bother with chapter 2 chirpers until I'm satisfied I've gotten all the dungeon plans (sadly chapter 2 is the longest chapter of them all). Thanks for the info though!

Those would be really cool places to take the series.""   ""I'd like to do something like a dating sim game—a love game—with the characters.""  someone give her tons of cash please xD"

gamindustri,389s4z,thugnificence,4,Tue Jun 2 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Once you get into Chapter 5, you will be able to access the Colosseum that is in the Gamindustri Graveyard. You can easily use that to pull shares out of Cities or Local areas around them to increase global shares or local shares to get the CPUs / extended parts of the Normal Ending if you get Lily Rank up with each CPU. Whatever you can't pull out Share Wise, just do certain Quests like killing Dolphins or Bits.  Having the Colosseum makes it really easy to go for the Conquest Ending as well. Be warned though, if you never heard about it or witnessed it from a Let's Play or whatnot, it is definitely an Ending (if you are going for All Trophies,) that you will want to complete first, that way the other endings make up for what happens during it (It's depressing, while the rest of the endings are cheerful, so it will balance out if you do the 1 depressing ending first then do all the others afterwards.)  The only problem though is that you don't want to do quests that give Midgard Lastation shares, because if you put Shares into Midgard, the only quest to pull Lastation's Shares out of Midgard is in Chapter 4, and once you finish the Graveyard in that chapter, you can't go back to the Graveyard to fight the Tough Enemy you need for it."
gamindustri,389s4z,Rajaxx,2,Tue Jun 2 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a lot of useful information Thanks! I think I will go for the conquest ending first then. I looked up some stuff about the game trying not to spoil too much but I know about the Coliseum,but didn't know that shares could be acquired or gained from it. Good to know that I don't have to start over again!"
gamindustri,389s4z,Radene,2,Tue Jun 2 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"Most quests are repeatable, aren't they? Or is that just in the remakes?"
gamindustri,389s4z,Radene,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"they are, but I think they might only give shares for the first time they are completed. I'm testing it out right now I just completed the same quest 3 times and there's been no movement in shares. but i assume there are a lot of quests I had since I'm not even on chapter 3?"
gamindustri,389s4z,Zilveari,3,Tue Jun 2 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"One thing that often catches people off-guard is that they don't check where the shares are taken from. So, if it's ""Planeptune +2%, Lastation -2%"", you won't get any shares if Lastation is already on 0.  They all add up to 100%, and you can't take from where there aren't any."
gamindustri,382ptz,Daverost,2,Mon Jun 1 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"The DLC dungeons are designed to be used with the Level Cap DLC, so yeah. Unless you shell out for the level cap removal, you're stuck just using your DLC Makers.  Pretty sure it even says on the PSN Store page that FREE TRIAL PERIOD is meant for 300+, National Entrance Exams is meant for 600+, and Get The Treasure is meant for 900+."
gamindustri,382ptz,reallygoodbee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it does, but I am aware of the recommended split.  That said, like I mentioned, at 700+, I can't even deal with the boss in the second dungeon. I don't know if it's because the Makers are much weaker than the main cast (I don't have them at the same levels to compare) or because I'm just doing it wrong."
gamindustri,382ptz,reallygoodbee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"It's probably because the Makers are a bit weaker and don't get the transformation stat boost the CPUs do.  It is worth noting that with Rebirth 3, the Makers get a self-buff that works the same way as the CPU's HDD, so they're not so underpowered in comparison."
gamindustri,38221m,qazdg,10,Mon Jun 1 07:57:46 2015 UTC,"The games take place in different dimensions, 2 doesn't follow directly from 1. They don't really say it explicitly, but there's tips like the fact that Compa and IF are mentioned as being childhood friends (instead of meeting during Rebirth1), and the fact that the two met Neptune and Nepgear at the same time whereas Nepgear didn't exist for most/all of Rebirth1. Also, note that the Falcom in this game isn't even the same character as Rebirth1's Falcom. I don't know a whole lot about it, but as I understand it the Falcom in Rebirth1 is the Falcom from Plutia's dimension?"
gamindustri,38221m,Shardwing,4,Mon Jun 1 08:13:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know a whole lot about it, but as I understand it the Falcom in Rebirth1 is the Falcom from Plutia's dimension?   This is... complicated.  The R;B1 makers that are new to that version (i.e. not IF/Compa) are all from the Victory DLC. But they were all summoned to the Ultradimension (Plutia's dimension) from other dimensions. Some came from the Hyperdimension, like MAGES., but it's not really explained where they all specifically came from. Then you have Falcom, who has an Ultradimension version, but the mk2 version was summoned to the Ultradimension as well. The one in R;B1 is the mk2/Hyperdimension Falcom, not the younger one native to the Ultradimension.  And then with all of them dimension-hopping over to R;B1's dimension, things get even more complicated. It's kind of a mess."
gamindustri,38221m,Daverost,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:31:45 2015 UTC,So that's why those makers talk about meeting the main cast in a different dimension. I didn't realise what they were talking about when I was playing R;B1 since I haven't played Victory.
gamindustri,38221m,Roondak,2,Tue Jun 2 04:04:01 2015 UTC,"It's probably just their subtle nod to a line that Nisa had in the original mk2 since they stripped her out of the game. Her original dimension was implied to be the first game's Hyperdimension, where she was a guest character that could become playable through DLC."
gamindustri,38221m,Daverost,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:44:34 2015 UTC,Oh so it's a reference to that? This is all very confusing...
gamindustri,38221m,Roondak,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:51:28 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Maybe. It's honestly hard to pin down why they made the decisions that they did. It makes sense to me, but I could be way off base on that last one."
gamindustri,38221m,Daverost,3,Thu Jun 4 00:14:31 2015 UTC,Oh gosh this is confusing.
gamindustri,38221m,Shardwing,7,Mon Jun 1 08:38:35 2015 UTC,"As I hear it, Neptunia 2 was originally going to have a completely new cast, but people liked the old ones so they used them again but made it be a new continuity in a different dimension. Don't think too hard about it, and just have fun."
gamindustri,38221m,Tjoeb123,3,Mon Jun 1 09:00:59 2015 UTC,They are taking Neptune out not way D;
gamindustri,38221m,Radene,2,Mon Jun 1 10:31:27 2015 UTC,"That's....pretty much what I do.  Outside of Victory and its sequel, I don't ever pay attention to this Hyper-Ultradimension nonsense.  Too nerdy for me.  Also FYI, I do call the mk2 and Victory Falcoms ""Adol"" Falcom and ""Estelle"" Falcom, respectively.  They share the same name but their designs pay homages to two different Falcom (the company) protagonists - Adol from Ys and Estelle Bright from The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky."
gamindustri,38221m,reallygoodbee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"I dunno, at least in R;B2, her artistic pseudonym being gender-reversed Adol, in the fishing scenes, she's most definitely channeling Estelle."
gamindustri,38221m,Daverost,2,Wed Jun 3 07:32:30 2015 UTC,"Neptunia 1's True Ending didn't leave any room for continuation, and they had to just start over again with Neptunia mk2.  Rebirth 1 and Rebirth 2 are remakes and do the same thing.  So IF and Compa don't remember anybody because Rebirth 2 is an entirely different story in an entirely different continuity and has nothing to do with Rebirth 1."
gamindustri,38221m,reallygoodbee,2,Mon Jun 1 11:42:11 2015 UTC,"If they were going to completely rewrite the finale of the first game and give it two new endings, as well as giving an origin to the Candidates, I'm honestly disappointed that they didn't try to just tie R;B1 and R;B2 together.  As is, I'm left wondering why they re-wrote the end of the first game at all, because I didn't like the changes."
gamindustri,38221m,cockshittingmanatee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:33:28 2015 UTC,I thought there would be ties since its R;B1 and R;B2
gamindustri,38221m,reallygoodbee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:46:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no. It's Rebirth 1 because it's a remake of the first game in the series, and then it's Rebirth 2 because it's a remake of the second game in the series.  However, Rebirth 3 is a sequel to Rebirth 2, and picks up a few years after it ends."

gamindustri,37zo8l,Rajaxx,6,Sun May 31 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"Hyperdimension Neptunia PS3 / Re;Birth1 are separate, because they had wanted to make sequels for the game with an actual story, but the way that True Ending in the original HDN turned out made it so that they had to reboot it in the form of Mk2, Victory, and Victory II.  Re;Birth1 is a good way to get introduced to the main CPUs in the series (and based Nep-Nep,) but otherwise, you can skip the first game.  Just like Mk2 > Victory > Victory II, Re;Birth2 will fall in line story wise with Re;Birth3 and (if it ever happens) Re;Birth4."

I was expecting the same thing to happen since more and more people have been finding out about / getting interested in HDN in general.  The only place i've seen it really bad is the Steam Discussion Boards for Re;Birth1 and 2, since almost every day, people are asking if one is worth playing over the other, or if there's an actual story."

Why remove the original Japanese text too? I've been studying Japanese for about two years now and it would be great to practice with Neptunia but the option doesn't exist  It just seems odd to me to not just leave it in, unless there's some legal nonsense surrounding it.

gamindustri,37oquv,Rajaxx,1 point,Fri May 29 05:19:04 2015 UTC,"The day system is easy to figure out. On every dungeon on the second enemy page (if applicable) there's a number with a boot. If you enter that dungeon and leave, that many ""days"" have passed.   Fixing flags yields different results. Some of the bosses spawn while it's up and different ones will spawn while it's down. But, none of them activate unless you spam scout and get the Tough Enemy thing from a scout.   Hidden dungeon are from scouting in general but only in that nation.   As for the hidden events, I think if you get them all before chapter 7 (could be earlier?) is over, you'll get it. Which is also if you got all five items. Five items, five events."
gamindustri,37oquv,Chemlicker,1 point,Fri May 29 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"Entering and exiting dungeons causes time to pass. How much time is dependent on the dungeon itself, and you can check by highlighting a dungeon and pressing L/R until it says Scouting Time. Changes what the scouts change in the dungeon itself. Namely, Risky Foes, which have very high stats, vs Tough Foes, who have some kind of additional gimmick, and Harvest Shift, where harvest points become mob drops, vs Harvest Shift Plus, which makes the gathering points give their rarest drop all the time. It's random, but the dungeons themselves are region-specific. So you need to spam scouts in all the nations to get all of the dungeons. You don't need to worry about the True Ending or the Hidden Dungeons until Chapters 8 and 9, when the True Ending requirement-events actually appear."

While hacking away at hordes of enemies is tons of fun and each character has a unique playstyle, the game itself is essentially the same thing the entire time of mashing different combinations of square and triangle.   If you are simply a fan of the series and the characters then this game won't disappoint. It has the CPUs/Candidates showing off their skills in the flashiest way yet and the exchanges between them during the cutscenes are still as charming and funny as ever.   Those are my thoughts, at least, after just playing through the main story."
gamindustri,37lqul,kakigori,2,Thu May 28 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"The story is fun but its pretty short overall. Its also somewhat sad that there are characters that are completely overshadowed by others sadly (Neptune>Blanc) but thats really inconsequential to actually playing the game its just more annoying than anything. If you are looking for a game similar to Senran Kagura or you are a fan of Nep games id recommend it. Its probably my favorite beat'em up on Vita currently. It wont last you anywhere near as long as Shinovi Versus though, It took me about 2 days to get all but the last trophy so if you are looking for alot of easy trophies then its also a pretty good game for that. Just dont expect to plat it unless you plan on spending like 15 hours doing lily rank grinding."

I get she is supposed to be slow and strong, but, thats not really how it ended up. She is slow and does average damage. Meaning that besides being someone you favor (myself included) its better to play one of the faster characters."

gamindustri,37nkek,Mogarane,1 point,Fri May 29 03:34:17 2015 UTC,"Binged? They did dub the OVA but they're always reserved for BD releases and sometimes VOD (iTunes, Amazon, etc.). I know that; I was specifically referring to Black Heart.  If you've seen Rosario + Vampire, Moka has 2 forms and FUNi decided to use 2 different actors for its dub so my initial thought was that they did the same thing with Neptunia.  Glad I was wrong though."

Hopefully there's some more depth here, playing NepU gives a sense of big potential but it is definitely nowhere near realized yet. I like the Neptunia games but it seems like they'll all just be in this weird mediocre space where the game are alright but could be much better. That is totally OK, it gives it a strange sort of charm even, but paying full price for another NepU would be a big blow to my trust towards the devs personally. Waiting for more info.

Apparently it was available in japan for a couple days when the first one came out (Not sure if that's true or not though since I don't live in Japan myself,) but for the most part, it seems like Idea Factory doesn't want IFI's English Localized version released in Japan, since apparently Reverse-Importing is very frowned upon there."

Region locking of Japanese games on Steam is common practice for the very reason you stated and is done a lot (Capcom is the most guilty, but SqEnix did it too...

If you want to spam Cliones for Levels (This game is very unfair in end fights, because it can be really one-sided against you,) just look for the Purple Rune inside a Dungeon, and then Save and Load the Game constantly. Doing that inside a dungeon resets the Running distance of possibility triggering a Normal Fight. Easiest way to farm Cliones for Leveling.   Don't let Neptune die either. You lose Shares permanently each time. Same with leaving the Ranked Side Dungeons. It isn't bad if either happen a couple times, but any more than 10 is usually when it gets harder to build Shares for others."
gamindustri,374xkh,lpchaim,1 point,Sun May 24 23:57:54 2015 UTC,Seems more trouble than it's worth. I might just watch an LP on YT or something.  Thanks anyway though!
gamindustri,374xkh,Rajaxx,3,Mon May 25 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"I kinda want to buy the original ones, if only to have them on me. A big part of that is they seem to go around fairly cheaply here, bad reputation and all. From what I've read it's a more like a much more severe case of nice dialogue and character interactions buried below relatively lesser combat and general gameplay, which permeates even the newest titles to some degree. /u/Rajaxx's comments seem to further confirm that."
gamindustri,374xkh,lpchaim,1 point,Mon May 25 00:34:35 2015 UTC,Mk2 and Victory really aren't that bad. Most of the hate for the series stems mostly from the first Game in the series.
gamindustri,374xkh,Rajaxx,1 point,Mon May 25 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I just realized I didn't specify my last paragraph's first sentence was meant to refer to the first game. That does seem to be the case AFAIK. On that note, did Re;Birth 2 and 3 mantain their respective scripts from the originals, unlike the first one? I've only played the first two remakes, so that eludes me."
gamindustri,374xkh,lpchaim,1 point,Mon May 25 02:03:45 2015 UTC,"The remakes won't retain their original scripts because as far as I recall (some one please tell me if I am wrong if this isn't true,) the script for the original games was done by NISA. NISA had a falling out with IF a long time ago and they have nothing to do with Hyperdimension Neptunia now. I think IFI does their own Translations for it now.  The Humor and stuff is still good, even with IFI doing it, but I personally think NISA did a better job with keeping the story / dialogue humorous, hence why I like the first game and Mk2's story more at the moment.  Although, I can't tell you how the script is for Re;Birth2 and 3, since I own neither a Vita or a PlayStation TV. I would assume that since IFI does it, that it'll be similar to the first Remake, although of course, in line with Re;Birth2 and 3."
gamindustri,374xkh,ginginator901,1 point,Mon May 25 02:16:39 2015 UTC,"Got it, thank you for the info and insight. I did figure it had something to do with NISA, but didn't know any details. Hunting down the PS3 versions just got a lot higher on my priority list, gotta play through the original dialogue someday."
gamindustri,374xkh,Rajaxx,1 point,Mon May 25 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"Thankies to OP for asking, I was wondering this myself since all I have on the PS3 was Victory. Also, anyone here think I should pick up mk2?"
gamindustri,374xkh,ginginator901,4,Sun May 24 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Most people will skip the Original and go straight into Mk2, since it is in a different dimension of course, so you don't miss out on story. Combat is definitely a lot better (before it became perfected in Victory and onwards.)   The Story is still comedic, but it definitely feels more Serious (As I mentioned before in a Thread I made, the Game was more serious than the first because original fans of the game did not like how the original was too funny. Mk2 was their test, along with the Conquest Ending, they saw not many people really liked it, and went back to what they do best.)  Also, if you played Victory, Mk2 is worth it, since Victory literally starts off that Neptune from Mk2 is transported to the Victory dimension, and she tries to find a way to get back home. In other words, Mk2 and onward fall in line with each other Story Wise. Mk2 had to be in a different dimension because in order to make the series work, they had to re-do every thing since there would be no way to make Sequels after the first game, considering how True Ending is.  If you like Trophies too, Mk2 has eight Endings, so definitely a lot more to do. You need at minimum Three playthroughs to view them all if you try to perfect every thing each playthrough."
gamindustri,374xkh,reallygoodbee,2,Sun May 24 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I guess I'll pick it up. I do have Re;birth 2 and I'm playing it right now but I was curious to see if mk2 is darker (since it has the M rating) unfortunately I already know the conquest ending due to accidentally finding out, Oh well.  And yes, I LOVE trophies. Currently I'm level 15 on PSN and have 2041 trophies. Always looking for more. Thanks for the recommendation!"
gamindustri,374xkh,ginkaa,1 point,Mon May 25 02:11:54 2015 UTC,"Gameplay isn't very well polished, or even polished at all, but the story, dialogue, and soundtrack are probably the strongest in the series."
gamindustri,374xkh,dieth,1 point,Mon May 25 01:12:57 2015 UTC,"Looks like you've already found your answer but I just wanted to add that I've been watching a playthrough on youtube (for my source of nepu-nepu until RB2 is released) and agree that the dialogue and characters are still pretty good, but the gameplay is the weakest part of the game. The story does seem a lot deeper and it is different from RB1 so it's worth experiencing one way or another in my opinion."

gamindustri,374xkh,Craunva,1 point,Mon May 25 12:14:32 2015 UTC,"Wait, so is NISA (the character) not in any other games?"
gamindustri,3741xf,phoneau,3,Sun May 24 18:03:35 2015 UTC,"First off, the first game was designed horribly. As a beginner, it's fine since it's all you know. Anyways, each character has their own strengths. Generally speaking, O is stronger for both Neptune and IF. Compa is magic based so she needs to use X. With that said, you need to make their combos in the menus. It's important to experiment with IF and Neptune since they are more useful with the abilities they have. Compa just needs Combo Link at the end of her combo so she can link her attacks while gaining AP. Everyone else needs combo link too just so you get more out of your turn.   One of the most important parts about winning is defending. You'll be golden if you save enough AP to defend at the end of every turn.   The healing is also 100% RNG. I still can't figure out the actual percentages since the lowest one wins. If Nepbull is set to 100% and Nepbull C is set to 100%, only Nepbull will activate.   The last thing is if something seems too hard (which will definitely happen later) just grind out a few levels. The game isn't balanced well where a single level can make a huge difference."
gamindustri,3741xf,Chemlicker,1 point,Sun May 24 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great advice! Regarding defending, do they not do the item RNGs if they are defending at the end of the turn?"
gamindustri,3741xf,Rajaxx,2,Sun May 24 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, the Items that say Upon Defend / Defense activate if you get hit while you are defending, and it goes to your Turn (Which is a must have item since you always want to have a little bit of AP left for your party to defend.)"
gamindustri,3741xf,Rajaxx,2,Sun May 24 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"Two tips:   If you feel like you're having problems later on, or hell, early on, just keep spamming a Side Dungeon or the current Story Dungeon you are on, and then look for a Purple Rune on the ground. You can use Compa's Monster Call on that to fight a Clione and get a ton of Experience. Cliones are weak to Earth, so toggle Earth before you start shooting. Have IF and Neptune do their normal stuff against them and you'll be fine. Later on, you will end up finding or buying a weapon for Neptune that increases her Ranged power. You will want to get this to make Clione fighting faster, along with spamming your Attack Keys and the Animation skip key.   What I ended up doing whenever I needed to grind Cliones, was find where exactly in a dungeon the Purple Rune is, do it, and then exit out of the dungeon. If the Rune itself is far inside a dungeon, a common method you can do is run a fair bit in a dungeon (Fair as in like you know how far you think you can run before you feel like a Fight will trigger,) and then just Save the game, and Load the File. It loads the Game, keeps you in the Spot you saved, and you can run full distance again since it resets the Trigger, per say. Doing that makes it easier to reach the Runes and exit the dungeons without worrying about a normal Fight taking out any of your party members.  Mini-Boss Runes (Cliones) can be done many times, not just once, as long as you leave the dungeon and re-enter it (Some Side Quest Dungeons, it is faster to clear the Dungeon than it is just to do the Clione and then run back out. I only ever saw like 1 or 2 Side Dungeons while Share Grinding where I could actually get to the Clione and leave fairly fast, because you can't do the Save and Load method in those.)  As was mentioned up in Chem's comment, Fights will start to feel like they are getting unfairly hard later on, and some times it's just plain un-winnable without grinding. I myself got to the Final Boss with my Party all around 45. It was so one-sided that I had to leave and do Clione Farming up until Level 60 in order to actually stand a chance against the last Boss (Even at that level, you may end up dying a lot, but you will have a better chance of getting better Item RNG when you retry at that level.)"
gamindustri,3741xf,Rajaxx,1 point,Sun May 24 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, this advice came at the perfect time. The story mission I am on right now has a Clione in it that gives me 52000 XP every time I beat it, and I am at a point in the game where most random battles give me around 1000 XP if I am lucky. I fought it twice already and gave my level a nice boost up to 23. One thing though, if I leave the ranked dungeons, don't I lose shares or something? I don't really understand that premise but lots of guides have told me to not let Nep die or leave ranked dungeons or else you can permanently lose shares which locks you out of some events?"
gamindustri,3741xf,reallygoodbee,2,Sun May 24 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"You need to get Shares for each area (except Planeptune) to a certain point in order to get the other CPUs to join you in the last dungeon.   You do lose shares though if you let Neptune die at all, or if you leave Ranked Dungeons. It actually isn't that punishing to let Neptune die or leave Ranked Dungeons, especially if you have not gotten her killed up until the end of the game, but it does start to become a problem once you die and leave Ranked Dungeons past say, 10 times (Ranked and her Dying count together, keep in mind.)  When I did my Blind Playthrough of it a month or so back, I never died with Neptune at all until I got to the Last Dungeon, so I went into 1 Side Quest Dungeon (It's a Lastation one. I would have to check what it's called,) killed a Clione 6 or so times (It gives 3 million EXP each kill,) left, and still had enough Shares to still balance between the other Cities to get every one else for True Ending (If you go for True Ending, you need to level more past 60, because the Final Boss is harder.)  If you're going for True Ending, then once you get all the Goddesses in the Party, you can just go ham in the Side Quest Dungeons and lose Shares all you want, because all that matters for True Ending is bringing the CPUs with you to the end of the game. Shares won't matter once they join you... Unless there are Trophies for getting each City maxed. I don't know if there are any, since I don't really go for all Trophies / Achievements."
gamindustri,3741xf,dieth,2,Sun May 24 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"You chain comboes by setting moves with Combo Link, and if you've got someone in the back, Switch.  Keep it within your AP limit, but best chain for the CPUs is just Attacks > Combo Link > Attacks > Switch > Attacks > Combo Link > Attacks > Transform.  Its the same for Compa and Gust, but focus on shooting, and try to break the Guard Gauge going into the CPUs turn.  And its important to know you can modify Item Skills mid-battle. With a little practice, you can learn to micromanage your Item Skills for maximum survivability."

Rebirth 1 doesn't feature any of the CPU Candidates outside of being hidden characters, whereas they're a major focus in Rebirth 2.  NepU features the CPUs, the Candidates, and two reporter characters.  If you're okay with not immediately picking up on some of the character references or traits, then go for it.  It's a non-canon side story where you beat stuff up."

gamindustri,36mamn,dieth,3,Wed May 20 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Knowing the character personalities is probably going to be helpful, but I don't think it's necessary."
gamindustri,36mamn,Flamesblade4,2,Wed May 20 14:34:03 2015 UTC,"For the most part, all of the games in the Hyperdimension Neptunia series are standalone. The only one that is kind of a sequel is Victory/Re;Birth3 and it's a sequel to Mk2/Re;Birth2. Hyperdevotion Noire is set in an alternate dimension that has nothing to do with the main series games, and I have yet to boot up Nep U yet so I can't give specifics about that one."
gamindustri,36ki4g,stealthcl0wn,8,Wed May 20 01:29:10 2015 UTC,"Choosing just one is too damn hard. I would say Compa is my favorite. She is just so damn cute. My second would be Vert. I'm a sucker for the older sister type characters. Yes, I know the other CPUs are real older sisters but they don't have that maturity vibe that Vert gives off."
gamindustri,36ki4g,Blazephantom,3,Wed May 20 02:07:07 2015 UTC,"I always liked Vert, but I didn't really get hit by her appeal until one day I was bored and taking screenshots of a certain game with Neptunia models. I was in the process of taking this and suddenly for some reason, I felt charmed and thought, ""she's like a princess... wow."" I see her in a different light now."
gamindustri,36ki4g,Graynigma,2,Wed May 20 05:21:31 2015 UTC,I can only hope Vert will get her spinoff game soon.

gamindustri,36ki4g,Redarmy1917,5,Thu May 21 16:16:13 2015 UTC,I would choose Uni.  She's always trying to impress and get the acknowledgment from that special someone.  Describes my life perfectly.
gamindustri,36ki4g,ChiyoMihama12,4,Wed May 20 14:00:36 2015 UTC,"People in here be separating their human and HDD forms... They're still the same person guys.  It's Plutia for me. I enjoy my mid day naps and I also love Sadie.  Then I'd go Noire, Vert, Neptune, Nepgear, Peashy, Uni, Blanc, Rom, Ram."
gamindustri,36ki4g,Blazephantom,4,Wed May 20 04:35:17 2015 UTC,Agreed on both aspects. I realllyyyy want Plutia to have her own game.
gamindustri,36ki4g,ChiyoMihama12,4,Wed May 20 05:21:21 2015 UTC,You misspelled Vert.
gamindustri,36ki4g,Graynigma,2,Wed May 20 05:32:20 2015 UTC,LOL!

gamindustri,36ki4g,Rajaxx,3,Wed May 20 05:05:53 2015 UTC,"Something about IF's personality reminds me of someone I know, so naturally she's my favorite. Close second is Noire though. She's pretty funny."
gamindustri,36ki4g,ginginator901,2,Fri May 22 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely Neptune.   Blanc is 2nd for me because she fits me perfectly personality wise, but I really love Neptune and her mixture of being very silly, while also getting very serious when necessary (She definitely has the biggest personality change when she transforms, alongside Plutia.) It was very hard not to laugh at a lot of stuff she had to say. It was also very hard  Although, if we had to choose between Normal and CPU, I like Purple Heart a lot more... and considering I play PSO2 a lot, I show my faith as well."

gamindustri,36ki4g,ginkaa,2,Wed May 20 06:17:39 2015 UTC,"Definitely Vert because i feel like i can relate to her a lot more. Actually tried to pull off some of the gaming feat she does. I am that guy who will not sleep at night just to do limited time missions that the eastern MMO love to do, i am that guy that will wait at a rare monster spawn to get silly mounts and achievement and i really wanted an older sister. But sadly i am the oldest. Apparently i am supposed to be the second, if my mom didn't had an miscarriage on her first child who is a girl.  But ... if you look at my username you will see that i like Noire too, i am a sucker for tsundere as long as they are not too unreasonable. !"
gamindustri,36ki4g,Nintyboy245,1 point,Wed May 20 09:47:47 2015 UTC,I love Vert for her sisterly and teasy nature tbh. It's adorable.
gamindustri,36ki4g,Ethridel,2,Wed May 20 10:30:42 2015 UTC,Nep > Uni > Noire > everyone else in some order or another that I haven't bothered to think about  Don't have any particular reasons. I just like them. It's the whole package per character.
gamindustri,36ki4g,Craunva,2,Wed May 20 11:15:30 2015 UTC,"It's hard to choose favourites since they're all great characters in their own way, but the ones that stand out the most to me are Plutia, Neptune and Blanc.  Plutia because she's just too damn adorable, which makes her transformation even better.  I know, picking the main character as your favourite feels totally cliche, but how can anyone not love Neptune's super cheerful and playful attitude? I find her genuinely funny, and there's never a dull moment when she's involved.  And lastly there's Blanc; going from calm and quiet to violently enraged in the blink of an eye is always hilarious. It's her Japanese voice actor that really makes it for me. Seriously, if you're used to playing with English audio just have a listen to her in Japanese and you'll see what I mean. I also really love her outfits, her's are probably the most well designed in the series in my opinion."
gamindustri,36ki4g,Tyaph,2,Wed May 20 12:47:52 2015 UTC,"Blanc's JP VO is amazing. She goes from ""dull and disinterested"" to ""gunning for anything that moves"" in an instnat."
gamindustri,36ki4g,Zeromus22,2,Wed May 20 12:50:17 2015 UTC,Blanc because I feel like i could actually live with her and not get annoyed. And i also have a short temper so we have that in commo. :D I don't like many of the non goddess characters. Next goddess would probably have to be Noire. Then nep then Vert. Vert is last cause I feel she's just too perfect...
gamindustri,36ki4g,P1zzaman,2,Wed May 20 13:17:28 2015 UTC,"I don't like most of the non-goddess characters either. I just feel they're kinda 1-dimensional, save Compa and Iffy"
gamindustri,36ki4g,Okhlahoma_Beat-Down,2,Wed May 20 13:18:14 2015 UTC,"I guess most of us have our flairs represent this?  I first saw Chika in mk2 and her introduction threw me off. Her scenes with Vert cracks me up so much, especially the extra events in mk2 and her ecstatic expression in the group photo. Also, she's got a great hairstyle and a really nice dress. Personality wise, she doesn't hide her affection although she gets crazy sometimes, ha ha."
gamindustri,36ki4g,BJC1994,2,Wed May 20 14:57:47 2015 UTC,"I love the Oracles tbh, perhaps more than I should, but still"
gamindustri,36ki4g,Johnypleasebegood,2,Wed May 20 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"Uni- she's adorable in both forms and isn't a loser like her older sister. And I just can't not love the twin drills.  (No offense to fans of Noire, she's just a little too tsundere for me)  Edit: Gotta add Blanc as #2 because I love characters who use slightly less conventional weapons in RPG games, especially a hammer."
gamindustri,36ki4g,Tjoeb123,2,Wed May 20 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say Neptune. She's silly, carefree and funny, and as Purple Heart she's a bit more serious with a touch of Nep's silliness. I also love those D-Pads she wears in her hair. Adult Neptune from VII looks promising as well, if she has similar mannerisms or characteristics to our Nep, then she'd probably be at the top."
gamindustri,36ki4g,Graynigma,2,Wed May 20 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"My top 3, in order:  Blanc  Peashy  Plutia  Blanc, because I'm a nintendo fanboy at times, plus I'm a sucker to those ""calm but deadly when angered"" types.  Peashy, because she's like Flandre Scarlet mixed with evangelion plugsuits.  Plutia because she's so spacey, and that unexpected HDD mode."

gamindustri,36ghui,Weeaboo69,4,Tue May 19 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Laptop  Not because I'm a /r/pcmasterrace circlejerker but   $14.99 sale on release 1080p waifu goodness    framerate in Re;birth1 is kinda disappointing   I was one of the lucky ones who didn't have optimization issues and could just play the game without any performance drops. I believe it was a your-mileage-may-vary kind of issue and people suggested fixes in the Steam discussion forums. I didn't experience that myself so I can't really say anything about it. BUUUUUT since they're running a beta which I didn't get into god dammit and delaying the launch to June 2, it would be reasonable to expect a better PC port this time. And if that doesn't convince ya, then at least you can save some $ with the 50% off on release and get 1080p waifus in suboptimal framerates.  Also, in case it's relevant, I was rolling with i7-3630QM Quad 2.4GHz, GTX 670M, 8 GB RAM on my laptop before I built my current desktop.  Second edit: I derped while reading your post and mistakenly thought you were referring to fps drops on PC and gave you info on PC but it's still relevant so it's ok"
gamindustri,36ghui,Graynigma,2,Tue May 19 05:36:02 2015 UTC,"As someone that usually tolerates 30fps pretty well, some of the chugs in Re;birth 2 were pretty bad. It might just be my copy, but during the HDD transform for Nepgear, I was literally getting massive frame skips / less than 10 frames per second (to be fair, I PSN downloaded Re;Birth2, whereas I had a physical copy of Re;Birth1, so that might have contributed to differences in performance). Normal gameplay though is about the same as Re;birth1, which is to say it chugs from time to time, but it is generally alright.  Sacrificing convenience is pretty hard to swallow, though, and honestly it's a toss up between convenience and graphics. I'd say what you should also consider is whether or not you plan to finish Re;birth1 before June 2nd (RB1's main story is about ~20-25 hours long). If not, you should definitely get the PC version since it will be deeply discounted on launch day. 50% off AND better graphics is worth losing convenience of portability in my opinion.  If you are blitzing through Re;Birth 1 right now, then it is a toss up. Non-Essential RB1 Spoiler The other and probably more relevant reason I bought the Vita version was that I was impatient and wanted to play the game now."
gamindustri,36ghui,gametempest,1 point,Tue May 19 05:49:29 2015 UTC,I spammed Cave's EXE drive all the time in Re;Birth 2 and it chugs so bad. Nepgear's EXE is pretty bad too. I'm also using a PSN digital copy.
gamindustri,36ghui,petalferrous,1 point,Sat May 23 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys, that's exactly what I needed to hear! I'll just play Witcher 3 until the 2nd, then get RB2 on Steam.

gamindustri,36ghui,Rajaxx,1 point,Tue May 19 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"On a side note with the PC version, there are two things I would like to point out, based off how Re;Birth1 was for PC:   I personally did not use them (I played with a Official Xbox 360 controller,) but one thing most people complained about was the Keybinds for Keyboard. Pretty much, there are apparently a lot of them, and you will want to remember what exactly you set up to do what in the game. If you decide to play with a controller, get used to moving and using the camera at the same time. One of the biggest issues with the game for a Controller User was that you could not move in all eight cardinal directions (mainly Diagonal.) While this doesn't sound too annoying, it is if you are trying to line up 2 or more enemies together to hit / build Gear fast. If we can move in diagonals in the PC Version of Re;Birth2, which we won't know yet until it comes out, then this won't be an issue. If we can't, then moving along with moving the camera constantly will alleviate the issue."

gamindustri,369z9t,DalentZX,3,Sun May 17 17:03:41 2015 UTC,To answer #2: Quite a lot. the Re;Birth games tell the main story of the series. Nep U is just a spinoff and doesn't really contribute to the main story. Playing RB1 and 2 first would be good so you can understand the character interactions on the other games.
gamindustri,369z9t,Omochikaeri,3,Sun May 17 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"Rebirth 1 and Rebirth 2 are remakes of Neptunia 1 and Neptunia mk2. Due to Neptunia 1's True Ending, they were forced to reboot in order to make a sequel, so the second game had really nothing to do with the first. The remakes follow suit. Action Unleashed is just a spin-off. It's good, but you're better off playing the main games, which are 1, mk2, Victory, their remakes Rebirth 1, Rebirth 2, Rebirth 3, and the upcoming Victory-II. Not really. The games do a good enough job of explaining the setting and cast."
gamindustri,369z9t,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sun May 17 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"So with AU just being a spin-off, am I to assume that it has no online play like the others?"
gamindustri,369z9t,reallygoodbee,2,Sun May 17 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"None of the games have online play.  Producing Perfection is a Business/Idol sim, Action Unleashed is a beat-em-up, and Hyperdevotion Noire is an SRPG. The rest of the games in the series are all single-player RPGs."

For me though, I always used Neptune / Blanc / Vert for the Fake White Heart fight in Chater 4 (I never used Healers because I was perfectly fine with just using Items to heal since I always had a ton of them.) Pretty much just build up the EXE Drive Gauge, use a mixture of Vert's and Neptune's EXE Drive, and use Vert's SP Skill to keep Fake White Heart debuffed (I don't remember if Vert's EXE Drive works like Noire's Infinite Slash where it debuffs the enemies / boss afterwards.)"

gamindustri,35v79e,Samanic,2,Thu May 14 00:42:01 2015 UTC,"If you want something with similar character design, the artist who made all the character designs for Neptunia also did the illustrations for a Japanese novel series calld Date A Live. You can read the books translated and see the pretty pictures here: http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Date_A_Live Her artwork is really good. Plus there is even MORE fanservice in the novel illustrations. (Albeit with the characters from Date A Live, not Neptunia, but the girls are cute there too!)"

gamindustri,35v79e,Mogarane,1 point,Fri May 15 02:27:29 2015 UTC,Its too bad the golden week sale on PSN already passed.  I don't know what you mean by padding. Do you mean without lots of post game and side quests or are you looking for games that are more linear with more story content?
gamindustri,35v79e,lpchaim,1 point,Thu May 14 06:13:38 2015 UTC,"A bit late to the party, and it might not be what you're thinking, but are you familiar with the Senran Kagura series? If you are, feel free to ignore the rest of this gigantic post. It popped into my head because it fits all of your criteria, except for having way more than a slight of fanservice, it's in fact built around it. I think the first one was actually the game responsible for bringing the clothing destruction mechanic to the forefront recently, the one present on Neptunia U (In fact, SK's studio is behind this game IIRC) and quite a few others. They're not JRPGs though, With Burst on the 3DS being a side-scrolling beat-em-up, a la Streets of Rage, and Shinovi Versus on the Vita being kind of a musou-lite, playing like a Samurai Warriors title with more emphasis on action and duels. SK2 on 3DS is a bit of both with a way more refined gameplay. Estival Versus on Vita seems to expand on its predecessor. It's a surprisingly solid series for a fanservice-focused one. Games play well (Burst is more repetitive and harder to go back to though, play it first if at all), the girls are all very well modelled/characterized and the localization is quite well done. Story is nothing to write home about, but serviceable enough to be a good vehicle to character interaction. Sorry for the massive wall of text, I hope I could be of use."

Other than just the HDN Games, only ""merch"" for HDN I have is a custom Purple Heart Poster I found on RedBubble that sits above my bed.  I'd like to get more Merch / official stuff for it as well. Only two things stopping me: 1. Lack of Funds (currently working on that.) 2. I live in a household of five. My brother and my sis-in-law watch anime (their tastes are the opposite of mine and i'm pretty sure he would hate HDN,) but not my parents. I think it would be weird as hell explaining to them why I have my room covered with HDN related stuff. It was bad enough already with both the Purple Heart poster and the Shana (Shakugan No Shana) Poster I have up."

(Note: The poster above the shelf isn't actually a Neptunia poster - it came with my Time and Eternity LE.....oh god, that was a bad game....)  Fun fact:  The tag Nepgear was reading isn't translated for the wall scroll, however, it was for the Udon artbook (which I also own - and it translates to ""striped"").  Also, Neptunia games aren't the only games I have LEs for - but they're the only ones that have cute box artwork on them!  I know Omega Quintet isn't Neptunia but it's still CH, dammit!"

gamindustri,34xvq6,dathar,3,Tue May 5 15:54:47 2015 UTC,Nep's VA is also Maria from Hayate no Gotoku. Really mature voice in that one.

It doesn't end there either, the imouto VAs are top tier too.   Nepgear shares a VA with the JP Chie from Persona 4.  Uni is voiced by Kitamura Eri who is in almost as much as HanaKana. She voices best girl Nene in the currently airing Yamada-kun to 7nin no Majo.  Speaking of HanaKana, guess who voices Plutia...

gamindustri,34t9d5,gametempest,7,Mon May 4 11:15:14 2015 UTC,Nothing is censored in R;B2.  It's basically speculated that NISA's version of the script was a lot harsher and creepier than it needed to be. Or that a few years managed to change perception enough for it to not be considered a big deal anymore. One of the two.
gamindustri,34t9d5,Daverost,3,Mon May 4 11:33:01 2015 UTC,"In mk2, they were forced to remove a CG of Ram and Rom being molested by tentacles/Trick's tongue.  They included a much milder version of the CG in Rebirth 2."

gamindustri,34t9d5,dodongo821,1 point,Mon May 4 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks for letting me know. I'l probably just keep rb2 if it was something they had to censor across the board/ couldn't fly under the radar. I was just worried that in order to attempt to appeal to a broader market (even though it is still pretty niche) that they watered down the remake in comparison to mk2."
gamindustri,34t9d5,Redarmy1917,3,Mon May 4 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"I felt like Mk2 basically bordered between M and T to begin with. Some years have passed and probably a couple of different people deciding on the rating, they went with it being just under M probably.  Regardless, I'd say get Mk2 anyways. It's combat system and Victory's are pretty similar, Victory has some slight improvements, but there's one thing I felt Mk2 did so much better, which was handling SP. Instead of SP just functioning like MP in a final fantasy game which is Victory's system for it, in Mk2 your SP is actually at 0 going into a dungeon and you build it up by hitting enemies, also HDD gets extremely costly the longer you are in it, and going HDD feels much more special and important.  Though there is a glaring issue you'll especially notice early on in Mk2, and that's accuracy & evasion are extremely important stats and tech support is basically the most broken move to have because of it. Even being like 2-3 points below their evasion will cause an issue about being able to hit."

In the Vita subreddit they have a system where if you write up a formal and concise review of a game then they will add it to the list if it is well received or liked by a mod. You can then view all the reviews for the many different games the Vita has to offer all in one spot. So far there have been no player reviews for those games on the page.  Sorry for not clarifying, I just thought the idea of Vita game reviews by the Reddit/Vita community was a really cool idea. Id love to see someones name from around here up with a review as well.

gamindustri,34ku1y,Tjoeb123,1 point,Sat May 2 01:05:40 2015 UTC,This was actually my first time getting a NepNep LE. After the horror stories I had heard there was no way I wasnt going to be extra cautious haha.
gamindustri,34ku1y,Rvbchurch678,2,Sat May 2 01:06:49 2015 UTC,"Haha me too. My friend got me Noire, heard that sold out within like, 30 seconds. I wish the contents were a bit cooler though, like something similar to the Re;Birth 2 LE or Omega Quintet LE,  but OST and body pillow case (even though I don't have a body pillow) is cool with me."
gamindustri,34ku1y,Tjoeb123,1 point,Sat May 2 01:09:46 2015 UTC,"I kinda like how they are mixing up the items in limited editions. Sure, I love the art books like the next guy but I can actually use one of the items in the limited edition. I know I can use the calendar too."
gamindustri,34ku1y,Rvbchurch678,1 point,Sat May 2 01:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really liked the Calendar. I would've also liked the wall scroll from Hyperdevotion, but I'm glad they're not the exact same package over and over."
gamindustri,34jy1w,petalferrous,7,Fri May 1 20:13:01 2015 UTC,tl;dr version: Just about every game is an alternate universe.
gamindustri,34jy1w,Taedirk,4,Fri May 1 20:15:09 2015 UTC,"...pretty much, yeah. Although mk2, Victory, and Victory-2 take place in the same universe, along the same timeline."
gamindustri,34jy1w,reallygoodbee,1 point,Fri May 1 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, only Victory and Victory II are direct sequel and prequel of each other. The rest of the games have their own storyline set in their own dimensions and possibly their own universe even."
gamindustri,34jy1w,MAGESdot,2,Sat May 2 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"Opening of Victory directly states that it takes place after the events of mk2, and I'm pretty sure Nepgear says it's been two years since they fought ASIC."
gamindustri,34jy1w,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sat May 2 16:32:49 2015 UTC,"I guess she definitely did, my memories are foggy."
gamindustri,34jy1w,MAGESdot,1 point,Sun May 3 15:03:00 2015 UTC,i'm curious would you happen to know if plutia is at all involved in victory 2 cause i haven't seen any mention of her in it.
gamindustri,34jy1w,kavinh10,3,Sun May 3 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, she's off-handedly mentioned here and there, but nothing aside from that."
gamindustri,34jy1w,reallygoodbee,2,Tue May 5 14:22:34 2015 UTC,You'd be disappointed :(
gamindustri,34jy1w,P1zzaman,2,Mon May 4 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"In the main storyline, I don't think so. Maybe as a DLC character in the future."
gamindustri,34jy1w,MAGESdot,3,Mon May 4 07:01:15 2015 UTC,"Basically, there's no connection between Rebirth 1 and Rebirth 2. They take place in separate continuities, just like Neptunia 1 and mk2 did.  It's because Neptunia 1's True Ending. In fact, Neptunia mk2 was supposed to have an entirely different cast of characters, but the executives opted to just reboot and throw in the four CPUs."
gamindustri,34jy1w,reallygoodbee,1 point,Fri May 1 20:56:36 2015 UTC,"That's basically the answer I was looking for, thanks :)"
gamindustri,34jy1w,reallygoodbee,3,Fri May 1 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"Np.  And I'd also recommend playing Neptunia 1. Rebirth 1 was so extensively modified that they're two entirely different games, with no similarities beyond the setting, most of the cast, and the very loose outline of the plot."
gamindustri,34jy1w,Tjoeb123,5,Sat May 2 01:23:34 2015 UTC,"Even as a diehard Neptunia fan, you can't make me play that piece of shit....."
gamindustri,34jy1w,Sircheeksalot,1 point,Sat May 2 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've platinumed the first and I would advise people to not play it. The game was bad. Was crazy how big of a difference that to mk2 was."
gamindustri,34jy1w,Johnypleasebegood,-2,Sun May 10 05:44:00 2015 UTC,"You aren't really that ""diehard"" then lol."
gamindustri,34jy1w,MAGESdot,2,Sat May 2 09:24:01 2015 UTC,I still bought a copy of the game just to keep it as a collection. Am I qualified to call myself a diehard fan?
gamindustri,34jy1w,Johnypleasebegood,-1,Sat May 2 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"If you really ""love"" the series and all its characters, would you not play all the games in the series? Especially the first one which arguably has the best dialogue in the whole series. Anyone who calls any Neptune game a ""piece of shit"" (especially the first game from the main series) isn't a ""diehard"" Neptune fan in my book. I will admit, the first game didn't have the best ""gameplay""  but it still had great dialogues and character interactions which made the game worth playing for me and many others who enjoyed the series as a whole. I started this series from Neptune1 on the ps3 and I have played every game released since then.   But yes, I think reallygoodbee is correct. You should play Neptune1, it's definitely worth the play if you want to understand the ""original"" character design and story. The game mechanics are completely different too."
gamindustri,34jy1w,Luminous083,1 point,Sun May 3 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"I dont want to come off as rude, but, I dont think its fair that you can judge someones love of a series based off of the titles they choose to play. I started with RB1 and I wouldnt think it would be fair for someone to say that I dont love the series as much as someone else because I didnt happen to play any of the originals for PS3.  Honestly the greatest thing about Nep games (and this sub reddit) is that the people here are nice and inclusive to others. If its your first time playing people wont treat you any different than someone who is a seasoned vet. Who cares if you have played all of the Nep games and others have not or choose not to for their own reasons, we are all here because we enjoy the series and I think that is what is worthy of discussion."
gamindustri,34jy1w,Johnypleasebegood,2,Sun May 3 06:45:43 2015 UTC,"Although I do agree with you.  I think when you call the main title a ""piece of shit"", the threshold of what a ""die-hard fan"" is broken. There is nothing wrong with loving the series without playing some or most of the games in the series. But when you talk poorly about one of the games in the series and try to push people away from a certain game while calling yourself a die-hard neptunia fan, it just does not make sense, at least to me. When I come to a Neptunia subreddit and see someone call one of my favorite games ""a piece of shit"", of course I'm going to comment back.  ""Honestly the greatest thing about Nep games (and this sub reddit) is that the people here are nice and inclusive to others.""  I want to believe this too.  I apologize, the purpose of my previous reply wasn't to be ""elitist"" and say that the only ""real fans"" are those who play all the games but rather to call out the ""piece of shit"" statement and defend the first released Neptune game. Of course, it doesn't matter if you've only play 50% of one of the games in the series, if you like the series then you are a fan of the series."
gamindustri,34jy1w,Luminous083,1 point,Sun May 3 08:38:49 2015 UTC,"While I cant speak for them, I think they were just mentioning that they didnt enjoy Nep1. While I think they could have said it in a more productive or tactful way I think that may be what they were trying to get across. Saying something like ""I didnt really enjoy the original neptunia because _____"" would have been a much better response than what was given. So while I agree with you that maybe the way it was worded was wrong I dont think they meant anything malicious by it.   As for steering someone away from the original Nep that could be true. While they did not explicitly say ""Dont play this game"" they did give it a negative connotation which could be enough for someone not to play the game. However, for most people I dont think they would give up on a title that quickly, I know personally I take the general consumers opinion rather highly but I also do personal research to figure out if ill enjoy a game.   Also, Im happy to see im not the only one who is passionate about the game and its community. It takes more of someone to apologize than it does to spout a retort so for that you have my respect."
gamindustri,34jy1w,burnpsy,1 point,Sun May 3 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"I see the question has been answered, but I want to point one thing out: The game itself does make it clear it's another universe, it simply doesn't state it directly.  Most blatant example is when they completely change the way Neptune, Compa and IF met. In addition to the other changes, Nepgear's presence at what would have been the beginning of Re;Birth1 should have been a pretty big indicator. There's also how Arfoire's appearance here doesn't match how she is in the original at all, regardless of which ending you got (and especially not the True Ending of Re;Birth1).  Basically, you saw a bunch of hints, but ignored them despite knowing the answer already."

gamindustri,34em5j,Rvbchurch678,1 point,Sun May 3 00:10:29 2015 UTC,I think Uzume's not included in the Nep x SeHa game...  OR IS SHE???
gamindustri,34fejb,ChiyoMihama12,2,Thu Apr 30 18:12:48 2015 UTC,Im pretty much in the same boat. The game looks amazing and im sure it will be extra hard to avoid spoilerinos in the mean time. I wouldnt expect it to be localized for quite awhile though. Thats just my thoughts however. Luckily we have alot of other great Nep games coming out in the mean time to tide us over until it does get localized.
gamindustri,34fejb,Luminous083,2,Thu Apr 30 18:15:03 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly! Hopefully IF will announce it soon, with the way things have been going!"
gamindustri,34fejb,Rajaxx,2,Thu Apr 30 18:27:31 2015 UTC,"HDN - August 19th, 2010 in Japan, February 15th, 2011 for US.  HDN Mk2 - August 18th 2011 in Japan, February 28th 2012 for US.  HDN Victory - August 30th 2012 in Japan, March 21, 2013 for US.  If I were to take a guess for HDN Victory 2, I would say either possibly November / December, or January / February of 2016. I can't guess for certain though, because I don't know if it will be easier or harder to localize PS4 Games compared to PS3 games."
gamindustri,34fejb,Luminous083,2,Thu Apr 30 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly cant wait, my PS4 rarely sees use. Especially since most games for PS4 are also available on PC. Leave it to Nep to justify my PS4 purchase haha. I suppose I could try out Omega Quintet too, Im waiting for some honest reviews before I drop the ball though since we all know meta critic as well as many other major reviewers are quite biased when it comes to localized games."
gamindustri,34fejb,Rajaxx,3,Thu Apr 30 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"What I want to know is what Review sites are actually fair when it comes to localized games, instead of just publishing half-assed reviews all because they're getting paid. Never looked because I never cared about Console stuff until I got hooked on Re;Birth1 XD  Yeah, that's also the same for me. That and FFXIV will make getting a PS4 worth it. Omega Quintet's interesting, though not a big fan of the Costume Breaking."
gamindustri,34fejb,btdandurand,2,Thu Apr 30 18:51:15 2015 UTC,"I'm no pro reviewer but I've played the HDN series and Fairy Fencer F and Omega Quintet is right up there in terms of quality, just smoother on the PS4."
gamindustri,34fejb,Luminous083,1 point,Fri May 1 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"Since I sorta reminded myself about it I took the liberty to look up a few reviews from average joe youtubers. General consensus is that the game is a 8-9/10 which is pretty decent. I really like what I see in terms of combat as well so I think im going to be picking it up for sure. Its just a matter of when haha. Thanks for the review though, I prefer hearing what the non ""pro"" reviewers have to say anyway."
gamindustri,34fejb,ginginator901,1 point,Fri May 1 05:34:19 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend it. It's so much fun. I can't even tell you how much fun it is. If you have any questions about it let me know. I haven't played my ps4 this much before, this game gave me a reason to."
gamindustri,34fejb,InuJoshua,1 point,Sat May 2 12:51:21 2015 UTC,I can stream it if you want to arrange a time to watch. I'm not very far though.

gamindustri,34fejb,Daverost,2,Fri May 1 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"Possibly the end of this year, most likely the beginning of next year."
gamindustri,34fejb,MAGESdot,2,Fri May 1 10:53:25 2015 UTC,"Following the trend of the previous games, it will take up to almost a year for International localization. Which is why I started a series of English Commentary and Summaries of Victory II on my youtube channel for those who wants to get some idea of what the storyline is before getting the game themselves (although that pretty much means that those who watch it completely spoiled the story for themselves :/)."
gamindustri,34fejb,ginginator901,2,Fri May 1 14:18:04 2015 UTC,"Now.  Just kidding, honestly, it might be October!  Omega quintet came out in Japan in October of 2014, came out in April. That's 6 months so, maybe we'll get lucky. I also believe OQ has more text than HDN so maybe sooner, but I doubt it. I'm just kind of scared that they announced the PC version of R3 before announcing localized V2, makes me think we won't get it this year D:"
gamindustri,34fejb,CaptainFL76,1 point,Sat May 2 12:49:31 2015 UTC,My fears exactly. Guess we have to wait and see.

gamindustri,34fejb,Rajaxx,1 point,Fri May 1 04:37:19 2015 UTC,"The trend i've noticed is somewhere around 6-10 months difference, but this might change because Idea Factory International is distributing them, maybe closer to 6 months. I say somewhere between October, and Feburary."

gamindustri,34bo8m,Cornetto_Man,4,Wed Apr 29 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"Really? Nice.  I play HDN pretty much exclusively for the dialogue, so I can totally see it as a vn."
gamindustri,34bo8m,Zeke2d,5,Wed Apr 29 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"The problem is that most just go by the ""if it's on VNDB"" criteria. VNDB is notoriously fickle on pretty much everything though so it lead to HDN being removed from it yet stuff like Fate/Extra staying."
gamindustri,34bo8m,Cornetto_Man,4,Wed Apr 29 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was kinda surprised to see the Noire flair even exist. As far as the ""what counts as a vn"" thing goes, it's not like everything is a vn or isn't. I didn't realize Danganronpa could be considered a vn until I finished it."
gamindustri,34bo8m,Zeke2d,4,Wed Apr 29 23:43:48 2015 UTC,"Yep that was me. I sent Advocate a PM at one point asking for it and she obliged. They're actually a helpful bunch, the /r/vn's mods.

gamindustri,34665f,ginginator901,4,Tue Apr 28 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"I'm currently in chapter 5 since I got it in the mail on Saturday. It's an IF/CH game, so don't expect anything amazing. But out of the 11 hours I've played so far, I'm incredibly hooked. Since it's a completely new type of storyline, the dynamic is very different than any of the HDN games. That said, getting used to the game takes maybe two chapters and the level curve is incredibly high. I am playing on hard, so I don't know if the game is easier. Some of the pronunciations kinda bug me, but I think they were just trying to appeal to the English audience. I'd say it's still worth it. I'd probably give it a 7/10."
gamindustri,34665f,Chemlicker,2,Tue Apr 28 18:11:11 2015 UTC,As long as it's fun I'm happy. Thanks for commenting!
gamindustri,34665f,Rajaxx,3,Tue Apr 28 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"I'll probably end up grabbing it once I get a PS4, regardless of what Reviewers say (I wish people would learn not to follow reviews from companies like IGN that don't play the game all the way through, and act like they know what is and isn't good when they're just paid to do a half-assed review. There are so many better review sites out there.)  Although, that won't happen until around the time Victory 2 comes to the west. Gameplay was interesting. Only thing I personally don't like (same would go for Neptunia U even though I haven't played it) is the Costume Breaking."

gamindustri,343lwh,Graynigma,6,Tue Apr 28 02:02:17 2015 UTC,"Via siliconera:    Ultra Dimension Action Neptunia U also has a costume destruction system that works a little differently from Tamsoft’s other games. Costumes have a durability stat that goes down when you take damage and do specific actions. When a costume is destroyed you’ll take more damage, but there is a chance to turn the tide too since your critical attack rate goes up and EXE Drive gauge fills faster.   Bold for emphasis.  Senran Kagura series only involved durability damage when taking hits.  It seems like NepU will bring you fanservice without having to let the AI get its licks in.

gamindustri,33l5s3,CaptainFL76,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:19:20 2015 UTC,That seems to be the general consensus. It gets people interested in Guilty Gear and NepNep at the same time and brings in mutual interest to boot.
gamindustri,33l5s3,Luminous083,2,Fri Apr 24 05:59:24 2015 UTC,Don't see how that's gonna work because they're two completely different genres.  Then again I'd love to see an ASW-made Neptunia fighter!
gamindustri,33l5s3,Tjoeb123,3,Fri Apr 24 08:48:59 2015 UTC,Its pretty simple to me. People who follow Guilty Gear content will likely see this article or another (im sure there is more than one floating around) and they will likely end up looking up what Neptunia actually is. The same goes for people who play Neptunia and are curious about what Guilty Gear is. Whether or not they actually buy or play said games is irrelevant. Getting the name out there was likely the intention. This gets the attention of both crowds for both games.
gamindustri,33l5s3,Luminous083,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"Either way, I hope CH doesn't get in trouble and/or risk blowing the chances that it'll be localized (it more than likely will be, but still)."

Even with all of the CPUs, the Neptunia girls are still out-numbered. Unless they decide to bring in Non-CPU characters, which seems a possibility since Iffy is in the spot-light."

I dont want to say it seems lower quality at first glance, maybe just different art style? I dunno, im not against the idea of the game, im just curious about Segas version of Nep Nep I suppose."
gamindustri,33g0io,Rajaxx,3,Wed Apr 22 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"Personally for me, I didn't think it was very funny, and I wasn't a fan of the art style too much. I ended up dropping it after two episodes.  It's one of those series (Like D-Fragments for example) where it tries hard to be funny, but it's mainly cringeworthy. Like I said though, that's just me. Every one will have different tastes in what they do and do not like, and will enjoy stuff others don't like."

The game really encouraged playing through the whole franchise because there are not just reference to others game, they even reference each other sometimes.  I would say the most noticable example in my opinion is eh in Rebirth 1 Noire told Neptune to shut up about joking on a certain item because ""we seeded trauma into some people who went through that, so stop it""   I saw a few youtubers who did Rebirth 1, and that joke just went over their head completely. But it is actually a reference to the original HDN 2 where eh ... a set of events will traumatize the players. Hmm i hadn't played Re;Birth 2 but i am assuming that event is still there ....  In HDN Victory (3), a certain character was bullied really bad and just treated like a butt monkey because of that trauma event ( I guess ... at least many players think so )  Spoiler !

I haven't played all the Re;Birth games yet (waiting for PC Release for 2 and 3, which have dates already,) so I can't comment for that, but story wise for PS3 / PS4, I guess you could say Mk2 > Victory > Victory 2, because Neptune in Mk2 does get transported to the Victory dimension at the start of Victory, and the same thing happens in Victory 2 as well."

gamindustri,331rwg,Tjoeb123,6,Sat Apr 18 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"Ugh, the original Neptunia. I was one of the very first people who played that sick-horrible-disgusting thing, known as a ""game"".  But you should realize two things here:   The reason why the remade the original series; and  The reason why they have more spin-offs before releasing the ""sequel"" of the original series.   To answer that, let me start with number one, by stating what I've said in my first statement. ""I was one of the very first people who played that sick-horrible-disgusting thing, known as a ""game""."" Looking back, I wouldn't really blame them, since I know companies like Idea Factory pre-2010 or 7th Gen era, were small companies that had few funds and employees.  I once described the first game in comparison of all the other games including the remakes as... ""Neptunia - Worst. Terrible. Horrible. Stay away unless you're a weeb like me who wants to experience masochistic pleasure and pain from playing J-Games like these.""  The scenes and characters alone cannot make up for how horrible the gameplay is. To an extent, only redeemable by a few factors. Nevertheless, we're not here to talk about the game.  The reason is probably obvious to you now why they remade the series. IT IS THE SAME REASON WHY GUST REMADE THE ATELIER SERIES FROM THE PS3. They knew the first Neptunia games, including Mk2, to a very little extent. Was in fact, terrible. Victory redeemed the series by a long-mile change in the battle mechanics and gameplay. More people, and even in the west began to know about Neptunia, BECAUSE of Victory, not because of the original. To some little extent, again, some people may have known Neptunia because of Mk2 as well.  Now the remakes are obviously done to redeem the original game, which was planned in development right after Victory, and during the Vita's early production years in Japan. They want to make sure the game is one of the first few games on Vita during that time.  To summarize, the remakes was obviously to improve greatly on the first games, reintroducing older characters to old players, whilst attracting and introducing them to newer players. This was purposely done, for the fact that newer players wouldn't be bothered to play the original games, instead to play the remakes which are far more superior.  As for the second one. The main reason why they have spin-offs, is because entirely of the remakes. They are doing spin-offs while remaking the 3 of the original series. NOTICE HOW THE SPIN-OFFS ARE THE SAME YEAR AS THE REMAKES? Thinking about in a developer viewpoint, you make more fans, and money with this, while spending less on the remakes. To clearly explain, remakes are different from making an entire new game. In a remake, you have the entirety of the game itself, including the story, in a nutshell, already done. With the only changes to make are usually the gameplay. So while they're doing seamlessly work on remakes, they're also developing spin-offs for the older fans to experience a new taste in the series. Because older fans will eventually be bothered why there isn't a sequel to Victory yet(which is of course Victory II), when the developers are too busy handling remakes first.  Now to conclude. Do we really have a lot of Neptunia games? Maybe, and maybe not. If you would look back and think ""What if Re;birth series replaced the entire original and was released in 2010-2011?"" We would have a difference in development years. With minus three games in the series.  Another thing to note is: The reason why you're seeing a ""milking"" view, is mainly because IF released internationally and because probably you like the series a lot. When if you actually play a lot of J-games, or has knowledge of even smaller companies. You'd realize they're not the only ones. This include companies like Gust, Bandai Namco, Nippon Ichi, Atlus, Square Enix, former Square Soft and also Enix games, Arc System Works, Marvelous Entertainment, and a lot more are just to name a few.  In a western standpoint, of course no one would think some of those companies would be milking. That's because most of their games are released only in Japan.  Welp, that's all I got to say, and I hope you understand. That this isn't your ""usual milking"" like what companies like Ubisoft is doing.  Edit: Also Iffy is best girl. Should have her own series."
gamindustri,331rwg,EnigemCenia,3,Fri Apr 24 01:52:41 2015 UTC,"I can definitely understand where the concern would be, but for me, it doesn't bother me so much since for the spin-offs they're different genres.  If they were all RPGs like the Re;Birth games, I wouldn't be as excited for each one so quickly.  But having the mix-ups I like.  I'm super pumped for U, but slightly less pumped for Re;Birth 3 after spending so much time getting the plats for 1 and 2 just a few months ago.  That said, once we're caught up, NA/EU releases will slow way down to match the JP releases with a delay."
gamindustri,331rwg,somehokie,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think that will ever happen, because by the time all the currently-announced games are released, the 2 Vita spinoffs will already be out in Japan with CH likely announcing more in the then-near future while we would still be waiting on VII's release."
gamindustri,331rwg,somehokie,2,Sat Apr 18 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"NA/EU will always be slightly behind, but one or two games behind is a lot closer then we were at the beginning of 2015, with several games behind.  After R;B3 and U, next is VII, SHG-Crossover, and Blanc's game.  When we are getting those, you're right, JP would be getting their next spin-off or mainline game, and so on.  They aren't simultaneous releases over there, and IFI isn't powerful enough for a worldwide release (although that would be awesome).  That said, there are still a lot of Neptunia games, and getting burnt out can be an issue for some people.  If you do start feeling burnt out, it's okay to take a break.  Try playing just the main line games and come back to the spin-offs at a later date. Of if that doesn't help, it's okay to play none of them.  Vita and PS4 games must be released digitally at minimum, so there'll always be a way to get ahold of the game, even if there's some strange shortage of copies.  Also, as an aside, can we all appreciate the back-and-forth with Tjoeb123 and mine flairs in context.    EDIT:  Guys, don't downvote Tjoeb123.  He raises a good point.  He and others may be getting burnt out.  Just because you (and I) enjoy getting rapid catch-up releases and aren't feeling tired of them, doesn't mean others can't be."
gamindustri,331rwg,ginkaa,3,Sat Apr 18 20:55:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The releases you're talking about are localisations and ports done by the International branch; obviously those are going to take much less time to develop than full games from scratch. The problem with the franchises that you mentioned is not that there are 'too many', but that they make very little improvements from the previous iterations. They are essentially making the same game year after year. For the Neptunia series, I don't think that's really the case. I mean yes, if you only look at the gameplay features, very little has changed, but for me it's not just the gameplay but the characters and story which keep me playing. Also if you take a look at the VII website you can see that they are introducing a lot of new gameplay features, and of course the spinoff games play vastly differently from the main series. So no, I don't think it's come to the point where they are milking the series just yet."
gamindustri,331rwg,Craunva,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"You're right, I play the games mainly for the characters (and especially my wifey Noire) and story.  Makes the constant recycling bearable (though I hated hearing the same songs again in Noire, which don't quite fit well in a SRPG IMO), but it's still annoying to deal with.  Or maybe I'm feeling this way because I've already played Victory, and platinumed PP and Re;birth1 (the latter being the most tedious and I do not wish to ever repeat it in the foreseeable future).  But then again, my room is covered in Neptunia limited editions and NISA's wall scrolls, and I have the Nep and Noire shirts, so I won't be abandoning the franchise anytime soon."

Even though they did say they currently didn't have plans to bring them over to PC, they still did get them ESRBed for PC, so who knows how that goes.  I for one am glad the Re;Birth series has been coming over to Steam. As much as I would like to get a Vita because of all the JRPGs and whatnot for it, I don't buy handheld consoles that I know friends of mine don't have (for online purposes in other games,) or for Streaming purposes (I'm not paying $200 or $300 bucks or whatever it is to get a handheld modified with a Capture board to broadcast / record games on Youtube or Twitch.) So it works out for me. Ends up working out as well for those who don't want to buy a Vita.  But yeah, I do understand where you're coming from about wanting a console to keep exclusives, since I used to worry about that stuff as well. Nowadays, I just see it as: ""Bring it over to other consoles instead of keeping it exclusively to one, and you'll find out that there are other audiences that want to play your games, which should encourage you to release more here or use what you get to develop more great games."""

gamindustri,32gnvf,superange128,2,Mon Apr 13 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"Q1 - Levels: I never encountered an issue on my first playthrough.  I made sure not to try and rush dungeons so my experience tended to match up properly.  Q2 - Exp plan: Don't remember right off.  Didn't use it until NG+ and starting to max out characters.  Q3 - True Ending: Coliseum is the winning move for share manipulation.  Shares only move when you finish quests or win fights in the coliseum.  Skim through your available lists and find what you can do to bottom out Arfoire without being annoying then run coliseum fights to manipulate the balance between CPUs.  Q4 - Characters: DLC characters are fun, but mostly a nod to the third game.  Definitely a power boost when playing.  You can also get access to the CPU Candidates through share manipulation and large amounts of MB for plans in the final chapter.  Q5 - Party: Everyone you can currently select will get experience in every fight.  It's fine to swap around or stick to constants as you see fit.  Don't worry too much about letting someone get underleveled.  Q6 - Combat: Combat advantage really falls by the wayside with Nepnep games.  Elemental attacks and the like are such a small boost that you can bull your way through with regular attacks in 95% of all situations.  It's almost never worth the extra effort to optimize beyond picking physical or magical attacks based on if a character's STR is higher than INT.  Q7 - Writing: ReBirth 1 is very lighthearted.  Lots of meta, lots of humor.  The CPUs do develop a bit, but there's a lot of sticking to their cliche roles.  ReBirth 2 focuses a lot more on story and character building in comparison, but it loses out on the humor in places."
gamindustri,32gnvf,Taedirk,2,Mon Apr 13 17:35:49 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Assuming you do quests as they come up, you shouldn't have any issues, aside from one or two bosses. The series is notorious for its sudden difficulty spikes. Yes, there is a plan for boosting EXP, but I can't remember where it is. If you do quests and coliseum fights, your shares will constantly be in flux. To get the True Ending, you need to have each nation's shares above 20% and Other shares at 0% going into the final boss. Other than that, it doesn't matter when you do it. Almost every playable character joins you over the course of the story. You have to use the plans system to make the CPU Candidates, and getting all of them should take two runs. The DLC characters are much stronger than the regular characters, especially Histoire. It's entirely up to you whether or not to get them, since they wreck the difficulty curve. I'd recommend just picking your favorites and sticking with them. The best equipment is in pretty short supply. No, you're doing it right. Later on, enemies will get a lot tougher, and you'll find yourself needing your special moves to deal any real damage. It really doesn't make much difference when you use elemental attacks, but certain enemies take more damage from certain enemies. Also, you'll notice your moves are marked with a Sword or a Staff. That means Physical vs Magical, and later on, enemies will be resistant against one or the other. Yes. The plot twists a little later on, and while the characters never really develop that much, they do mature over the course of the story."
gamindustri,32gnvf,reallygoodbee,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Q1 - You can pretty much do every Boss in this game underleveled. The only reason people recommend to grind early on is so you can get access to your other character's EXE Drive Gauges early on, which does make the game easier, but still difficult. I've gone into the Final Boss fight with my main party somewhere around the 40 - 45 range. It is doable, you just have to do a lot of extra planning with Healing / Reviving / evenly spreading your Party out so that Bosses aren't likely to use their AOE Normal Attack. Otherwise though, overleveling isn't really necessary.  Q2 - I don't remember when you get that unfortunately.  Q3 - Yep. For True Ending, it's 20 - 25% Shares for every one, and Others at 0%. You can do quests early on if you want to get some extra EXP / work on Shares beforehand, but once you get access to the Colosseum Plans in Chapter 5 and unlock that, you'll get missions that will speed up the process. My recommendation though: If you want the True Ending, wait until you unlock the CPU Candidates, because you will get extra dialogue with them as well, which is also great.  I don't remember exactly why, but I believe you can start getting the Birth Plans some time in Chapter 6.   Nepgear's Plans - 30% Shares in Planeptune for Chirper on the Map. 50% + an Item from a certain Dungeon Tough Enemy to actually create her.  Uni's Plans - 30% Shares in Lastation for Chirper on map. 50% + an Item from certain Dungeon Tough Enemy to create her.  Ram and Rom's Plans - 30% Shares in Lowee for Chirper. 50% + Dungeon Tough Enemy item to create her.  If you don't use too much Memory during your first playthrough and you grab the Memory from the Chirpers as well, you can make 2 of the 3 Candidates. Otherwise, you need 2 whole Playthroughs to get all of them.  Q4 - Auto-join wise throughout the story, there's definitely a lot of characters. You will end up with a lot of variety to choose from for the final dungeon. The DLC Characters are fairly cheap, and worth getting AFTER you play the game the first time around. The reason for this is because when you get them (You get Plutia and Peashy when you get into Chapter 2 and go to Planeptune for Events, and Histoire in Chapter 7 and Planeptune for Event,) they start off with stats / equipment that is better than your Party's equipment, although at a lower level. If you level them up though, specifically Plutia, it makes the early chapters not challenging at all, because she is an INT Character. Her Damage won't be lowered when fighting Machinery based enemies / bosses (and that's essentially what you mostly fight from Chapter 2 - Chapter 5.)  Q5. You only get 3 Characters to use in a Party, but you can use the Lily Rank system as well in order to swap them in during Battle. For Example, let's say you run a party with 3 CPUs. You get in a fight where you don't want to use Blanc, but want to swap in Compa instead to help heal. If Blanc is paired up with Compa VIA the Lily Rank system, then when it is Blanc's turn, you can use the Swap key to switch out Blanc and bring in Compa instead. I'm not exactly sure if there's a chance it skips their turn when you switch them out though. I switched them out when my characters were in the Level 500 Range for Colosseum grinding, and they never lost their Turn unless I decided to Swap them out twice on the same turn.   I'm not sure how far into the Story you are right now from the time you have posted, but you will soon start getting characters that will join your party to help out for Fights, along with giving you the option to swap out Party Members and Equipment right before fighting some Bosses. I like to think that is the game's way of telling you ""Hey. Here's a Temporary character you can use. You don't have to use her, but she'll really help make the Boss Fights up ahead easier to do."" You will see what I mean when you progress through Chapter 4.  Q6 - Yep. You're playing correctly so far. To me personally, you stop using Guard Break attacks around Chapter 4, because you will have 2 - 3 of your party members at level 25+ already, so you will have access to EXE Drive Gauge. Boss fights pretty much turn into ""Rush to build up Gauge, and EXE Drive Gauge when available"" after that point. Sounds simple, but one boss in Chapter 7 and the Final Boss in Chapter 8 will make it tough for you to utilize that if they give you bad RNG. As far as Elemental Attacks goes, I rarely used them myself. Since you fight a lot of Mechanical bosses until the end of Chapter 5 though, you can figure out what to use (Not all Mechanical enemies are weak to Lightning. They could be weak to either Ice or Fire as well, or resistant to them as well.)  Q7 - There's definitely plot twists, but otherwise, this isn't a Game you go into and hope it takes itself seriously the whole time, since it does a lot of 4th wall breaking and poking fun at a lot of stuff. Humor is what makes the story enjoyable. You will find heartwarming moments and good character development throughout as well, but in my opinion, not as much Character development as the original PS3 games, which the Re;Birth series are remakes of."
gamindustri,32gnvf,Rajaxx,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:01:16 2015 UTC,"Q2/ it's in Lowee Snowfield and you need to find it with treasure search. Just run around and spam the treasure search button, you'll find at some point. Or when you get/craft the Laplace's Eye plan (in chapter 5) it will be easyer to find hidden treasure as it shows up on the mini map."
gamindustri,32gnvf,Mogarane,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"Well then, here are my thoughts: Q1)  I don't remember having to grind to beat bosses, aside from killing the mobs on the way to them, of course. I think I did most of the quests in parallel though, and that might explain why. Grinding in early game does help for getting the EXE attacks sooner, which makes killing bosses and elite mobs much easier. Q2) I don't think there's a plan for that, and I feel it's not really needed. The 'stronger/weaker enemies' ones don't affect EXP and money output, if that's what you were thinking. There are, however, idea chips which give EXP boosts. Some monsters later on give literally one level per kill, which makes getting to 99 a breeze. I should mention I didn't buy any DLC. Q3) Yes, that's right. Forget about the shares for now and just use the Colosseum or missions for moving them around before going into the final battle. Q4) Almost all characters join automatically and are outclassed by the CPUs, even more so when they get the combo chain at level 70(?) which doubles their combo damage output. Then there are the optional ones, the CPU candidates of Lowee, Lastation and Planeptune, which require being on chapter 7 and getting 30% shares at the respective nation to get their plan (each costs a whooping 1024MB, can do 2 at most in one playtrough) and 50% to actually put them in action. Also keep in mind they join at level 1 and their gear updates are really expensive. They're not that useful either, aside from Uni's godly rush attacks and Nepgear's pairing with Neptune. As a more general note, make sure to open all dungeons you can for materials, I remember I couldn't get some items because of me messing up a certain chain. It can be quite frustrating, because dungeons and dungeon recipes can be lost until a next playtrough. Q5) All characters gain experience regardless of being active on battle, so that's up to you. Q6) I don't know if you're playing correctly, but that's definitely close to the way I have, and I've got its platinum lol. I got into a boss/tough enemy with full EXE, got some EXE drives in, proceeded to rack away its shield and tried to make so it'd get broken when I got it full again so it could get major damage from EXEs to the side... I just realized you haven't got any drive for now, sorry. In that case yeah, it can make for some looooong battles, but your method is about right I think. Elemental attacks are never really useful, it's all pretty superficial. There are some mobs with quite high elemental resistances, which can be pretty troublesome for Blanc since most of her EXE Drives are ice-based, but otherwise elements can be pretty much ignored most of the time. Q7) Well, Neptunia is all about the self-aware, lighthearted, parody/reference-ridden dialogue. There are some little twists here and there and even some heartwarming heroism antics by the end, but... they also don't really take themselves seriously either. The characters don't have that much development per se even if they do change a bit, it's all pretty binary. This doesn't stop most of them from being very endearing and very well characterized and localized, of course, but that's another matter entirely. Hope I could be useful, feel free to ask for any clarifications or help."

gamindustri,31z91u,Craunva,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:16:30 2015 UTC,We don't talk about Zune. she was a miscarriage. the sisters are Windows n Surface
gamindustri,31z91u,BlueDmon,3,Fri Apr 10 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"Although it's very probably just a dream sequence, as indicated by the sparkles and all, I like to think one of them stands for Smartglass and the other stands for that new Xbox-Windows streaming thing."
gamindustri,31z91u,lpchaim,2,Thu Apr 9 13:47:52 2015 UTC,"That would be quite interesting, but does it make sense? As far as I know (I'm new to gamindustri ;) ) the goddesses stand for homeconsoles and the little sisters for handhelds. So Planeptune has Nepgear(Sega Game Gear, that's why it is NepGEAR), Lastastion Uni(PSP I guess Uni because it uses UNIversal Media Discs aka UMD) and Lowee Rom and Ram (two because of the dualscreen). Leanbox had no little sister because Microsoft has no handheld.   Correct me if I'm wrong."
gamindustri,31z91u,Yacoon,3,Thu Apr 9 11:09:27 2015 UTC,"You got it right. The only thing I'd add, not sure if you've noticed, is that the goddesses don't necessarily represent one specific console, even the candidates. Uni, for example, has attacks referencing the Vita on Re;Birth1, even if her design is obviously PSP-inspired. The four goddesses also got newer transformations to stand for the current-gen machines in VII."
gamindustri,31z91u,lpchaim,2,Fri Apr 10 02:41:26 2015 UTC,I love the one on the left with the twintails <3

gamindustri,31ryfo,Luminous083,4,Tue Apr 7 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"Now to post on Twitter, let my friends know, and see how many of them don't end up buying it because they either ignore me or have a bad taste of humor / Waifus."
gamindustri,31ryfo,Rajaxx,3,Tue Apr 7 20:48:38 2015 UTC,Its one of the sacrifices we have to deal with living a Nep-Nep lifestyle. D:
gamindustri,31ryfo,TheWayToGod,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"I feel so mad at myself for not buying it especially since it's on sale, but with the amount of sexual themes in the game my parents and brother (and probably cousins and friends) will think I'm a weirdo. Ah, decisions, decisions..."

My parents dont really understand anime but they are more than supportive of me liking it (I actually got my dad to watch attack on titan somewhat so thats a feat within itself). Main point is that your parents may be more open to the idea than you think, its just showing them that you have an interest in it."
gamindustri,31ryfo,Felinomancy,4,Tue Apr 7 23:53:43 2015 UTC,Now I have both the Vita and PC versions of this game...  Steam is taking my monies
gamindustri,31ryfo,ginkaa,3,Tue Apr 7 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"I bought this yesterday because it was on sale. I had no prior experience in this game, and only watched the first three episodes of the anime. Currently just finished the first chapter where you meet IF for the first time and fight the ""old lady in goth makeup"". Nep's level is 6-ish.  Impressions: * I like the intro video. The apartment above mine will be hearing it a lot, I'm afraid. * Green Heart is making me feel all weird. Underboobs are my fetish. * I find the controls to be rather unwieldy when using the keyboard at first, until I ditched the mouse and use WASD + Numpad instead. * I got confused about several things - for example, I think I learned a new skill, but can't find it anywhere. I think I still can't use EX skills, even though I already have the gauge by this time.  * what sort of... ""special"" videos that Nep has in her HDD?  That being said, should I get the DLCs?"
gamindustri,31ryfo,Felinomancy,2,Wed Apr 8 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"You don't get EXE attacks until much later levels, about 40-50ish I think? It was probably an EX finisher that you got, which require you to build up the EXE gauge to use, but they don't deplete it. Go into commands for a character and select one of the four ABXY slots at the bottom. As for DLCs, the 3 Coliseum DLCs are basically postgame content and allow you to level up to 999. You can buy the other characters if you're a fan of them, but there aren't any cutscenes for them as far as I'm aware."
gamindustri,31ryfo,Omochikaeri,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:57:42 2015 UTC,I could've swore that I did not see any EXE finishers; but I'll check again after work. Thanks for your help!
gamindustri,31ryfo,Teapo64,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind ive heard that the DLC characters for RB1 are pretty much OP. So if you are looking for more of a challenge id suggest for at least your first playthrough dont buy the DLC characters. Thats more anecdotal than anything as I have not bought the DLC characters but thats what ive heard, take it with a grain of salt.  That being said, Enjoy the game, its a really fun series if you invest yourself in it."
gamindustri,31ryfo,Rajaxx,2,Wed Apr 8 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"I can't really decide whether I should buy this or not. I don't want to buy it since I already finished it on Vita but at the same time, I want to buy it since I want to support IFI and the Steam version has cards and stuff D:  A bit off-topic question: Do you think the other Nep games will come to Steam too? What will you feel about it?"
gamindustri,31ryfo,Daverost,4,Tue Apr 7 18:44:01 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we will be seeing the Re;Birth series on Steam at some point (Considering RB1 is on steam currently and RB2 is being tested). As for the spinoff games making their way to steam (Noire/PP) Id say its less likely but still possible.
gamindustri,31ryfo,iniitu,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:49:48 2015 UTC,Noire and Action Unleashed got rated by the ESRB so there is a good chance they'll come to Steam. Unsure about PP though.
gamindustri,31ryfo,Rajaxx,5,Tue Apr 7 22:25:25 2015 UTC,"They are ESRBed for PC sure, but if I recall, Idea Factory mentioned that they had no plans to bring Hyperdevotion Noire to Steam (Think same applies to Neptunia U, don't remember) but they ESRBed them just in case  They'll probably come to Steam. Re;Birth1 is doing well in terms of sales. Re;Birth2 will probably do just as well, if not better."
gamindustri,31ryfo,BlueDmon,3,Tue Apr 7 22:27:42 2015 UTC,PP almost definitely won't happen since NISA has that one.

gamindustri,31i5co,gearheadprime,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:08:33 2015 UTC,"Haha, I also thought it was for the Wii U for the longest time until I looked up gameplay footage. Probably because nintendo has been naming every game for the Wii U ""(Series) U"""
gamindustri,31i5co,dodongo821,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:41:52 2015 UTC,I voted for Nep. Mainly because she's the main character.

gamindustri,31c54n,reallygoodbee,2,Fri Apr 3 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, they mainly want characters that were used for Nintendo Games, so the possibility of a Neptunia character being added is close to zero unfortunately."

Oddly enough though, I was a part of the minority of people that never ran into any issues with the Game or getting it to run.  I am kinda hoping I get picked for it since a couple users found a pretty major exploit in-game a while back, and I took the time to use that Exploit and see what exactly could be done with it, only to found out there was a high chance of losing your current Save File you were on.  In a way, it sounds kinda wrong, but in the end, it's always fun to see what the end result is, and then let the company know all the exact details XD (I'm referring to the Exploit with the Colosseum if any one follows the Steam Discussions for Re;Birth1)  Even if I don't get picked for it though, won't matter. I just hope the Testers that do get in get a lot of stuff fixed by letting IFI know, and i'll be buying the Game regardless any way since I love the Series XD  But yeah, any way, good luck to you, and good luck to every one else applying as well"

I thought the characters looked cute so I tagged it as Want to Watch.  Then a few weeks later, I saw Re;Birth1 went up onto Steam. I was like ""Wait a second. This uses the same name as the Animation. I didn't know there were games for this."" So I decided to watch the Animation before I played the Game, since I rarely ever played JRPGs growing up, and rarely like them.  It was confusing at first, but it grew on me, and I really loved it. Played Re;Birth1 afterwards. Loved it. Watched a friend play the original HDN. Did not like that at first, but all the Dialogue in that caught me even more.  So even though I spoiled myself with some Victory spoilers from the Animation, it was worth it in the end, especially since I have a Purple Heart poster up in my room, and hopefully a PS3 / PS4 in the next several months so I can play more HDN."

I watched the anime after I had finished both Re;birth 1 and Re;birth2 and loved it just like you did. It sort of jumps all over the place as far as plot goes but thats expected when it comes to moe/SoL animes (Which I would say Neptunia's anime is). The show in my opinion is really good. It makes you feel the feels and makes you laugh 3 seconds later. If you havent seen it yet and are a fan of Neptunia is definitely something to see, regardless of what anime elitest might believe."
gamindustri,30c1xc,Luminous083,3,Fri Mar 27 01:54:02 2015 UTC,"Right. I was not exposed to the franchise before the anime, so I approached it with a blank slate, and it was very entertaining, with plenty of fluffy moments with Plutia (best nep). It seems like most of the bad complaints were ""it didn't stick to the script of the games"" and I'm just sitting here thinking ""well duh, it's an anime, not a game"". Those reviews are really unfair imo."
gamindustri,30c1xc,LunarisDream,2,Fri Mar 27 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"Thats generally why I took them with a grain of salt. That being said the only issue I had with it was transitioning from the Dubs to the Subs which actually wasnt bad at all. Generally ill watch subs to begin with but since I had already heard the dubbed voices I expected to not like the japanese voices but it ended up being a non issue. In fact, I might have a tough time when RB3 comes out deciding if I want to use the English voice or the japanese ones.  For those that cant stand the JP voices, luckily there is a dubbed version coming out so that they can enjoy the anime as well. Though I dont think that was a problem for many."

gamindustri,30c1xc,Omochikaeri,3,Mon Mar 30 10:49:55 2015 UTC,"I originally planned to buy a Vita to play Disgaea 3 and 4. As I was looking for people selling their Vita online, I saw someone selling a brand new copy of Re;Birth 1 at a cheaper price so I decided to buy it on the same day I bought my Vita and Disgaea 4.  So I got my Vita and 2 games on November and I first tried Re;Birth 1 out of curiosity then Nep happened. Now I just beat Re;Birth 2 a few days ago and now playing HDNoire.   What happened to my Disgaea 4? Let's just say that I barely even played it (chapter 2) because Nep.  I still find it funny that I got into the Hyperdimension Neptunia series because of a guy selling a cheaper copy of a game. I want to thank him for indirectly introducing me to the series ;D  I actually knew that series existed before because I had some HDN songs on osu! (Re;Birth 1,2, and animation OP). I just thought that the series is all about fanservice and is only available in Japanese so I didn't care much about the series that time."
gamindustri,30c1xc,LateForTeaNo8,2,Thu Mar 26 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"I heard a friend say they liked it then they linked a play through of Victory, I at first thought it was just cute now I love it."

gamindustri,30c1xc,Thehellis_Allthis,2,Thu Mar 26 04:22:19 2015 UTC,"Found the game through a friend. He had played it for days on end telling me how amazing it was. He was trying to sell me on it because he knew I (like most people here) are a fan of both anime and games so he knew id understand the references.  I put it off until I saw that it was up on PSN at a discount. Since I had nothing better to play at the time I decided why not? If I liked the game great, if I didnt, well, I got it not at full price anyway. Like someone else mentioned I was actually REALLY put off at the beginning of the first dungeon. I had liked the story before hand but when it came to gameplay I didnt like it at all. I saw it as a cash grab for people who liked anime and that there wasnt much else to it. However, after playing more and seeing more of the story unfold the game quickly grows on you and if you ARE a fan of anime and games then I believe most people who pick it up will enjoy it. It just really comes down to giving it an honest try. I know im glad I did."
gamindustri,30c1xc,_andry,2,Thu Mar 26 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Back when I browsed Cracked, I saw an article that mentioned it. After I finally decided to buy a PS3, I remembered reading about the game and bought it (and it's sequels soon afterwards)."

gamindustri,30c1xc,Yoppish,2,Sun Mar 29 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"I heard about the first game way back then on some big gaming site, when I still visited those, and thought the concept was mighty interesting, even if gameplay apparently sucked. The art also turned me off at the time. I wrote it off as 'creepy fanservice', basically. Fast forward to some time ago, I heard the Vita remakes were quite good and bought the first two Re;Birth titles. Played and platinumed the first one so far, loved every second except the ones associated with the absurd money grind. About the art, my tastes have shifted so much I actually love Tsunako's work nowadays, and have the Hyperdimension Neptunia + mk2 artbook on my amazon wishlist way (I have actually just impulse bought this along with the Gurren Lagann artbook, don't ask me why). Aaaand I also opened up quite a lot to moe and fanservice due to anime, so that probably helped a lot."
gamindustri,30c1xc,nelsonassassin,2,Sun Mar 29 06:13:33 2015 UTC,"Also new here, on to a long tale of how first encountered HDN then actually got to playing HDN.  A couple years back, I was on some imageboard and came across a block of text in Hebrew. As someone interested in foreign languages, it immediately caught my attention, so I immediately went to good old google translate and auto-detect, and it was something proclaiming an ""Iris Heart"" as one's lord or something along the lines of subservience to it (or as I later found out, her). Seeing that the rest of the text made absolutely no sense and gave no indication of what it was about, I then searched for this ""Iris Heart"" in English since it was the only proper noun that appeared.   Yep. My first experience with Neptunia was Iris Heart. Needless to say, I was traumatized and ran away in the other direction. As an old Chinese philosopher said, ""There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must not be attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, Orders of the Dominatrix Sovereign which must not be obeyed.""  This run-in with Iris Heart did lead me to the Wikipedia page for the series. The general concept of the series interested me, however, the statement for Plutia (""Lazy and always tired like Neptune, Plutia is calm, friendly and nice, and values friendship. Her personality completely changes when she transforms into Iris Heart, becoming sadistic and cold."") was hardly any reassurance. Since there were no images for the characters on the Wikipedia page, I did an image search that brought up images that were were... not safe for Iffy.   After having mentally blocked the trama from my mind with a few years and a couple thousand hours of mindless 4x games (EU3 and later, EU4), I got a Vita as a belated birthday present. Unfortunately, I got a PS2 slim eras ago for the explicit purpose of playing Persona 3 and 4, and honestly I am the type that finishes about 10% of JRPGS I play, so I had basically 0 interest in P4 Golden (it was a miracle that I even hassoutobi'd my way through the original). As someone that has had very bad experiences with grinds (a few too many grindfest mmos under my belt), nearly nothing would motivate me to play a JRPG, and even when I did play for the story/characters, I would end up very, very under-leveled.   Anyways, this predicament of having a Vita and not having any games made me go search around. Eventually, Amazon and its cookies decided I should take a look at rebirth 1 (then a pre-order). I revisited the wiki page, and having blocked Plutie from my mind, and I only read the general summary and the main character sections. Elsewhere on the web, people kept saying that based on the Japanese release of rebirth 1 that the remake was vastly improved compared to the original (which scored pretty badly), I decided to give it a shot. JRPG or not, the characters and concept had my interest.  I beat a couple dogoos. Meh. Fell into the cave and got HDD Nep. Meh. It was somewhat interesting, but not enough. I think I met IF and then saved and quit. I thought I would come back later, but didn't touch it for about 1/3 of an year.  Came back to it this spring break. Decided to give it a shot. Got to Black Heart and I was really, really underleveled (like I said, I basically do not grind at all). I got absolutely crushed. The Pre-Noire Boss was literally so tough for my underleveled characters that IF and Compa both fell within the first few turns despite heal sp skill/item spam and it devolved into an outright DPS race between Nep and the bird that I barely won. Black Heart then proceeded to steamroll me like Operation Barbarossa.  Rather than rage quit, unhealthy amounts of playing EU4 and getting screwed over by AI France made me plot my revenge. There are few things I hate from the very core of my existence as a gamer. Noire joined French Elan on that list. That smug face of hers. That intolerable accent (I still can't understand how the VA that did Chie from P4 and Emmeryn from FE:Awakening did Noire). Few things get me to go grind. Noire became one of those things.  I hit the whales and steamrolled Noire right back. A Bagration to payback a Barbarossa. From there, I was invested and binged the rest of the game to the true end. It was a worthy use of my vacation. I am looking forward to playing Rebirth 2 when I save up enough for it. I'm still not sure if I can fully forgive Noire though.   tl;dr: First encounter is random encounter with a wild Iris Heart praising. Iris Heart makes fast trauma. Few years later and many repressing of mental scar, I get a vita and, avoiding P4:G, play amazon roulette get this game. I lose interest in the slow start, and stop after a wild IF. I give it another shot on this spring break. I do not grind, so Noire make fast steamroll of poor Nep Nep and crew after hard battle with bird. I plot revenge by killing many whale to power level. Grinding makes me invested in game, all because I must get revenge against The Black Heart of Lastation, and I end up completing a JRPG, which is a rare occurrence for me. Still not sure if can I can forgive Noire."

gamindustri,2ziyjd,Rajaxx,3,Thu Mar 19 10:57:49 2015 UTC,"I can agree to that in some way.  Even though Neptune is main Waifu for me, Blanc is definitely second. She definitely fits the bill of how I am personality wise, and it's funny when she gets pissed off."
gamindustri,2ziyjd,Luminous083,3,Thu Mar 19 15:31:04 2015 UTC,Neptune's second for me. I didn't like her at first but then she grew on me like moss on a rock.  FLAT IS DELICIOUS JUSTICE
gamindustri,2ziyjd,Rajaxx,2,Thu Mar 19 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"Understandable.  When I first started the Animation (Was my gateway into HDN before Re;Birth1,) I didn't like Neptune all that much, but then she started to grow on me more as each episode went by. If any thing, it's mainly her Purple Heart form that made her my favorite lol.  But then come Re;Birth1, I couldn't stop enjoying Neptune XD"
gamindustri,2ziyjd,Luminous083,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"Its really interesting when I hear that people watched the anime first and thats what got them into the games. Alot of reviews from people who havent played the game have been pretty bad compared to those that have played the games.  I watched the show after beating both RB1 and RB2 and loved it, sad to see that some people didnt give it a proper chance. That being said...Blanc <3"
gamindustri,2ziyjd,Luminous083,2,Thu Mar 19 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"Well, at the time for me it was the best decision. I had never heard about Hyperdimension Neptunia at all. I originally thought the Animation was the only thing that existed (Because I didn't google the series.)  Then when I saw Re;Birth1 appear on Steam, I was like ""I never played a proper JRPG before and I didn't enjoy the Final Fantasy games at all when they came on Steam. Wait. The Animation was based around these Games? I think I will enjoy the Game more if I watch the Animation first and then play it.""  Worked out for me, even though I found out later it spoiled some stuff from Victory, which I don't mind XD.  It's just a shame that reviews knock the Games when they haven't played it. I'll admit, after I played Re;Birth1, I was one of those people when I watched my friend play the original HDN on the PS3, but over time, I started to like the Combat in that game, some of the music was decent, but the Dialogue overall was REALLY enjoyable. The series is by no means bad at all, since it rarely takes itself seriously XD"

gamindustri,2zf1pn,reallygoodbee,3,Wed Mar 18 01:11:49 2015 UTC,Well the last 2 limited editions of the games had a decent amount right? So hopefully there's a good stock for these as well.

gamindustri,2zf1pn,KickassCookies26,2,Wed Mar 18 01:53:20 2015 UTC,Apparently its says it on the site but it hasn't always been the case. I think with one of the LE's it was stated to be one per customer but people managed to get quite a few more than that. I'm relatively new to the Neptunia community though so i'm not quite sure if that is 100% accurate.
gamindustri,2zf1pn,Mogarane,3,Wed Mar 18 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, that one time was the Re;Birth1 LE. Before IFI had their own store, they went through Amazon for that one. Literally sold out in minutes"
gamindustri,2zf1pn,RadiantViper,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:08:02 2015 UTC,I stand corrected >.<   Hopefully since they have their own store now it wont be AS bad.

gamindustri,2zf1pn,KuroSame,2,Fri Mar 20 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I want the figurine, I'm irked that it wasn't included in NA's limited edition Hyperdevotion Noire when JP's copies came with the figurine, so I also don't want to buy it..."
gamindustri,2zf1pn,Thehellis_Allthis,3,Wed Mar 18 03:25:28 2015 UTC,It being so limited is probably the reason why they didn't include it. They probably wanted to avoid the same problem as re;birth one's disastrous LE while still offering NA a way to get some of the figurines. Pretty much most of everyone's main feedback after the launch was to offer the vita case as a seperate item next time to allow more LE's.  So yeah it kinda sucks but I can kinda see why they did what they did.
gamindustri,2zf1pn,KuroSame,2,Wed Mar 18 05:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I figured that the separation of the LE and the figure is due to quantity limitations. It's nice that it makes the LE much more available, but the downside is now we have to pay for such things as this. Though if it was the Vita case, I'd have bought it instantly since I actually need a Vita case."
gamindustri,2zf1pn,Blazephantom,1 point,Wed Mar 18 06:37:26 2015 UTC,Yeah it'd be pretty sweet if they sold the vita case on their store. I was fortunate enough to get one but I must say I don't really use it too much. While it looks pretty sweet it's not as durable as the bombshell one I have.

gamindustri,2ysqkx,Killergeist7,5,Thu Mar 12 16:07:05 2015 UTC,Like 5-6 times early on. Then once more later which taught me that if an enemy is mouse sized it will fuck you up.
gamindustri,2ysqkx,soah1086,5,Fri Mar 13 00:51:22 2015 UTC,"I think three times, all together.  First time was the Killachine 3, which was just utter bullshit. Between Green Heart and Purple Heart, I was filling the EXE Gauge in a few turns, and between Compa and Item Spam, I was out-healing its damage. Then it was just Paralyze Gas, Paralyze Gas, Paralyze Gas, and everybody was dead.  Second time was when I accidentally activated the Polytan fight at level 40-something. Got completely wrecked out of nowhere, lost almost an hour's worth of progress.  And the third was the Clione in Millennium Labyrinth. I can beat it with Nep, Noire, and Histy, but I went in with like... Vert, Broccoli, and Rom, and just couldn't kill the damn thing. It eventually got a bunch of turns in a row and killed everybody."
gamindustri,2ysqkx,reallygoodbee,6,Thu Mar 12 15:30:44 2015 UTC,"First playthrough, I saw that at least 10 - 15 times, because I had some horrible RNG with the Black Heart and Killachine fight in Chapter 2, then I died twice to the Jammer Fight in Chapter 4. Died a few times to Fake White Heart (She's definitely difficult even with a few EXE Drive Gauges loaded and used on her.)   Then died once on the Last Boss. Apparently Dragon Raid liked to hit 2 - 3 party members for almost all their HP at full HP.   Second Playthrough, I only saw it twice. Once was from Dragon Raid again, the other I forgot that you actually had to lose in the Second Fight in Chapter 3 when Arfoire transforms, and ended up thinking I had to die in the First Fight."

I just let them destroy my party then I realize that my party should be the ones beating them up.  And a lot more due to stupidity and lack of planning.  They really should make a Hyperdimension Dogoo game.
gamindustri,2ysqkx,Omochikaeri,3,Thu Mar 12 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"3 times. 1 from the ONLY boss that seals your items/skills. I wasn't prepared for it. Another from an enemy that went viral and got 3 turns in a row and killed me. Total bullshit.

gamindustri,2yqy1j,VoidxWolf,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:02:03 2015 UTC,combat system in rebirth 1 and 2 are different from their respective games instead they take the one from victory. Rebirth 2 has an extra ending too. Idk about rebirth 2 and 3 but rebirth 1 changed the story quite a bit and removed all the side story cut scenes which was pretty disappointing.
gamindustri,2yl0r6,Luminous083,4,Tue Mar 10 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"The only odd tip that could be useful is that healing items are better then using healing SP skills at the early game. Healing Grass does 1000 hp (and cheap, only costs 100c) and your first SP heal does 30% of max health. At early levels 1000 does 75% to 100%.  2) I don't know of any Team Comps that you have to use, you can use what ever you want. But there are just better characters then others if you want to go full min/max.  3)There was is 8 endings in Mk.2. I think the endings are the same in re;birth 2. The normal ending by completing the game without meeting the conditions for any ending and the 4 different endings for getting 70% shares with one nation and rank 5 lily rank with the nations CPUs. Another ending ""human ending"" by getting 5 lily ranks with all the makers. Must not meet the conditions for any of the nation endings. For the True ending you need to Get Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox, and Lowee's Shares to 15%+. Everyone to Lily Rank 4 or 5. Recruit all the CPU's The Conquest Ending Recruit all the CPU's. Watch all 3 Cursed Sword rumor events at Lastation, Leanbox, and Lowee BEFORE Chapter 5 start. Get Planeptune's Global Shares to at least 55% BEFORE CFW Magic (2) fight.  In Mk.2 (on PS3) you had to replay the game at least 3 times if you wanted all the endings. But getting shares and lily ranks are way easyer to get in re;birth 2, so now maybe able to get them all on one save."
gamindustri,2yl0r6,Mogarane,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:18:54 2015 UTC,The only difference this time around is that for the rumours you only need like 5% shares rather than 50% in Mk2.

gamindustri,2ykjsd,Mogarane,3,Tue Mar 10 18:23:13 2015 UTC,When I watched it I used Commie Subs and they used all the terminology from the game rather than direct translations so that might be worth noticing too. Plus as much as I hate Commie they occasionally do typesetting well.
gamindustri,2ykjsd,Cornetto_Man,2,Wed Mar 11 00:48:19 2015 UTC,"Basically what this guy said. If you want the subs to use the same terms the (English) games use, go with Commie Subs' version.  Sidenote: I like Commie when their good staff members are the ones working on stuff."

gamindustri,2ykjsd,whispen,2,Tue Mar 10 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"I think fan subs are usually closer to the original than localized subs. I say ""usually"" because of the fact they are ""fan subs"" and some fan subs are extremely liberal with their translation. In this case, I'd go fan subs. I have never seen the official subs for this particular anime but official subs are usually very liberal in their translation. The localization group's job is to not do a literal translation but to appeal to as wide of an audience as possible.  But in general, if you ""listen"" and read rather than just ""read"", a lot of discrepancies will be very obvious, even if your Japanese is weak or non existent. Also keep in mind whenever you see western idioms in anime subs, you can almost always assume that the subs are very ""liberal"" in translation and not true to the original meaning.  TBH, after translating my own manga, I realized how hard it is to keep a decent flow for Jp->ENG subs/transcripts without being liberal in translations.  TL;DR Probably should go fansubs for more ""literal"" translations. I watched commie and it seemed ""okay"" to me."

It uses the same cast as the Neptunia games, but has an entirely different setting, plot, and it's a Strategy RPG."
gamindustri,2yihqj,weeabooboo,2,Tue Mar 10 13:04:23 2015 UTC,"No, Re;birth 1 is a great starting point!  and Hyperdevotion Noire is great if you like srpg's...it is a lot different then Re;birth 1."
gamindustri,2yihqj,Graynigma,5,Tue Mar 10 12:30:46 2015 UTC,"I'm currently playing rebirth 2. I already played through rebirth 1 and got both endings. I picked up Hyperdevotion Noire not so long ago but haven't start it yet because I want to get at least the true ending for rebirth 2 before starting Hyperdevotion Noire. ( I regret this decision because there are SO MANY ENDINGS I MUST DO).   The story of rebirth 1 and rebirth 2 both occur in different dimensions, so you can pretty much skip rebirth 2 and play Hyperdevotion. Heck, you can even play rebirth 2 without playing rebirth 1, they explain the story pretty well in the intro of rebirth 2. But being a fan of Uni, I just had to pick up rebirth 2.  You should probably look out for the next rebirth game (coming this summer?). Get ready your wallet. (Don't pirate it, the goddesses won't like it and Arfoire will win!)"
gamindustri,2yihqj,weeabooboo,4,Tue Mar 10 04:33:32 2015 UTC,"Every time you pirate, Arfoire's shares go up. ;)"
gamindustri,2yihqj,kakigori,3,Tue Mar 10 05:31:00 2015 UTC,I actually already have the next one pre-ordered. I just wish I could get Hyperdevotion and Rebirth 2 both. But oh well.

I've got to say they are both extremely helpful. Peashy levels up easily and has insanely high physical attack. Plutia has decent INT, is immune to virus, and has skills that heal 30% and 75% making her sort of like an offensive Compa that can go HDD. I'd say they are totally worth the $1 each"

There's a possibility it could one day come to PC, but if it did, that wouldn't happen until some time later next year or possibly 2017 (assuming they do decide to do Re;Birth 4)  If I take a guess (And I hope I am wrong,) I would say it'll probably stay a PS4 exclusive."

gamindustri,2ya3sl,gearheadprime,0,Sun Mar 8 00:31:14 2015 UTC,"Right now, mostly holding out for Rebirth 3 and Hyperdevotion Noire.  I found Neptunia mk2 to be... kinda meh, honestly. It was a bit darker than Neptunia 1, and much more up-front with the sexuality. I mean, I loved every minute of Neptunia 1, but a few scenes in mk2 actually made me uncomfortable."

I don't know how it is in the later games, but I had trouble with listening to it in the original HDN game. It's just hard to hear a Valley girl style Dub for Neptune and Compa, and to me, it feels like Blanc is emotionless (Whereas her JP VA gets her right especially with her Personality change when she's angry.) It also was weird hearing Noire's ENG VA sounding like this? with a question mark after every thing? for whatever reason?  I'm not knocking any one that likes the Dub either. I want to like it, but it's hard for me not to switch over to English in the Remakes and give it a second chance after the experience I had with the original HDN.    Edit: Guess i'll throw this here. I never bought any physical Discs for Anime before. I'm sure this is a dumb question, but in the event that I don't like the English voices, do Dubbed discs tend to have an option to switch over to Japanese / English Subtitle instead?"
gamindustri,2y8chl,Rajaxx,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:16:40 2015 UTC,My first exposure to the series was through the original's English Dub and I thought it was fine at the time. I guess I'm used to it because it was the first set of voices I heard for the characters.

gamindustri,2xr76n,soah1086,2,Tue Mar 3 05:21:01 2015 UTC,What level should I be? I was around level 60 when I beat him. I read that the Colloseum fight has a level 80 requirement though. Was it the same requirement when I fought him at first?
gamindustri,2xr76n,soah1086,2,Tue Mar 3 05:47:51 2015 UTC,"No there isn't any requirements, you'll just get rekt in most fights if you're not that level. I can't remember where I grinded for levels before the Colosseum, but I kept fighting Regulus until I reached 99+ on all my characters. After that I spammed the Colosseum for a few hours and hit 999 on all characters. the 99-550 grind takes longer than the 551-999 grind if you'd believe it lol."

gamindustri,2wygqk,Rajaxx,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"The animation combines some story elements from The original, Mk2 and Victory into it, so you will experience some spoilers (mostly after Episode 4 though,) so it's your choice if you want to watch it or not. I personally decided to because I figured it would be a good way to be introduced to the Cast before I touched the Game, and I ended up enjoying the Game much more afterwards, albeit the fact that I ended up spoiling myself quite a bit.  Otherwise, if you want to go in VIA the games first, I highly recommend you play Re;Birth 1, 2 and Victory. I don't know how Mk2 is, but the original HDN game was bad enough to where it needed a remake.  Re;Birth fixes a lot of the problems wrong with the original Games, but it does gut out a lot of the Story and humorous dialogue from the Original."
gamindustri,2wygqk,dieth,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:06:18 2015 UTC,"The original HDN wasn't bad, it has a high learning curve for Item Skills, and Combos.  You can't heal outside of battle you really need to tweak your item skills sometimes every turn just to pull off heals and debuffs properly.  Mk2 has the start of the Victory engine, and Victory and the Re;Birth series just add better things with each release.  Mk2, Victory, Re;Birth1/2 pretty much play the same, Mk2 has no Jumping."
gamindustri,2wygqk,Rajaxx,1 point,Tue Feb 24 12:04:37 2015 UTC,"I never got the chance to play the original, nor touch the series in general until Re;Birth 1 came to Steam.   It's just.... very eh to me. I've been watching a friend of mine play it on Twitch, and the only thing I really even like about it so far is the music in Lastation, and how the Story / Dialogue is (Compa even has another side you don't see in the Remake.)  Otherwise, I just feel like the Music is not very likeable (It just doesn't match with what's going on. He was fighting Black Heart the other day and I was like ""Why the hell is it playing Troll Stronghold music from Runescape for her Boss Fight?)  Combat's also really slow. I do like the fact that Healing / Reviving has a % chance of activating during fighting, but the fighting just drags on, even against normal encounters. Then again, I never was a fan of slow Combat so... :P  I can definitely see why in some aspects the original HDN wasn't too bad. It's just a game I wouldn't play since the Remake kinda spoiled me."
gamindustri,2wygqk,dieth,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it got a remake the Victory engine is a much more enjoyable format.  Although I much preferred the treasure search that gave you a direction, over the running around aimlessly until you find where it's hidden or get Laplace Eye unlocked.   Oh and Compa's Monster call was AWESOME for tallying the exp up."
gamindustri,2wygqk,Omochikaeri,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Get a Vita and try all the games. HDN Re;Birth 1 and 2 are out now. 3 is coming sometime this year. You can also try the spin-offs which are HDN PP (released), Hyperdevotion Noire (released), and HDN U which is coming in May.  Or get Re;Birth 1 on Steam. I think 2 is confirmed to be released sometime in the future but I don't know if the other vita games would be released.  As for the anime, I think watching the anime before playing any of the games is a bad idea since you'll have a hard time understanding things. It also contains spoilers (especially for HDN Victory) so I suggest watching it after you got some background on the NepNep universe.  If you really cannot play the PS3 or Vita games then just hope that they release Re;Birth1 2 and 3 on steam then watch the anime after playing 1 at least."

You deal with all threats like you rule your nation, ruthlessly and efficiently, and the people worship you out of a grudging sense of respect and admiration.  As you begin to take form, you find yourself shaping your own being, deciding what to put where. Like all CPUs, you are distinctly female.

Good luck, and may fate be with you.  ...Odd. As I pass, I feel a strange sense of euphoria. Is this what it is like to die? After such a long life... I... I can only hope these actions... will make up for my past... mistakes...  And then the voice disappears.  Opening your eyes, you awake slowly, to the sound of the birdsong outside your window. Rising, you groan as you sit up and stretch, your weary muscles loose from a long, peaceful rest. Tossing back the heavy sheets and blankets, you step out on to the cold stone floor of your bed chamber, feeling around for your slippers. Grabbing the robe from the hook nearby, you wrap yourself as you get up from the bed, to begin the day.  After taking a nice hot shower and dressing yourself for the day, you march down the main corridor of your fortress-like basilicom, snapping fingers and pointing here and there. Lackies and servants pour from the doorways, each of them eager to do your bidding. You demand breakfast, and someone leaves to arrange it. You ask for the daily Share report, and it is brought to you.  Yours and Calloway's shares are up slightly, while Planeptune's are down, like usual. And like usual, Leanbox's shares have gone up, leaving them at nearly double your own. Bah.  A short time later, you are seated at the head of the long table in the central dining hall, waiting to be served. Footsteps of servants echo through the massive stone chamber, lit with a wall of glass panes on one side. Your minions stand nervously to the side as you glance around the chamber and await your breakfast.  If it takes too long, heads will roll.  Fortunately, nobody has to die today, as your eggs, toast, and sausage are brought in post-haste, quickly placed in front of you, the servants scurrying away as soon as the plates hit the table. Like usual, you dine alone, except on special occasions.  While you eat, one of your ministers approaches you, carrying an armload of papers, with pens, and ink. You eye him up and down as he walks up, waiting for permission to approach. Wiping your mouth with a napkin, you nod and he bows deeply before moving towards the table.  He wants to know what your plans for the day are. There is work to attend to, and guests have already begun arriving.  A) Go visit another nation. Go shopping, get in a fight. B) Do some quests C) View the map of Gamindustri D) Do some work E) See the guests F) This food is subpar. Someone has to pay. G) Go train in the caves nearby H) Insert other here"

The librarian sucks in a breath, silencing himself when you glance his way. He's smart enough to know when to bite his tongue.  Hmm... The situation in Lastation piques your interest. They're going through a big industrial reform, and normally, a nation wouldn't go through such drastic changes so quickly. Too much risk, especially share-wise... All you can imagine is that something must have happened to their CPU.  You decide its worth investigating. Announcing the days plans to your ministers, you leave the staff to clean up from breakfast and march out of the chamber, your bootstrikes echoing throughout the stone hall.  As you walk, staff and servants fall in and out of line behind you, asking questions about this and that.  Namely, your route. The easiest way would overland through Leanbox, although border security might be... hesitant to let a rival CPU into their country. Secondly, you could take the monster-infested, maze-like caverns that lead right to the Lastation border... Or you could fly, but you'd be dead-tired upon arrival.

Either way you go about it, you have to head through Leanbox to reach Lastation. And after a short discussion with your ministers, you decide flying would burn up too much of your energy, and you really want to avoid being hassled by border security, so you'll take the overland route through Leanbox and go... incognito. Yeah, incognito. Turning a dime, you head back the other way, your servants and vassals parting and reforming behind you like water.  As you walk, you snap fingers, ordering some supplies prepared. It should take you two days walking to reach Lastation, so you're going to need two days food and water, money for an overnight stay and maybe some shopping, and camping supplies. Bowing deeply, the vassals and ministers break off and leave at every door and intersection of the castle, and by the time you reach your own private chambers at the top of the fortress, you're alone again.  Pushing open the massive double-doors to your private dressing room, you quickly start to undress, throwing your regular outfit into a heap on the bed. You decide to change into something a bit less conscipuous. It's buried away in the bottom of the dresser, in the closet, but you find a nice, plain sundress, with some dark sunglasses and a large, wide-brimmed hat. It doesn't hide your figure very well, but at least it doesn't make you stand out like the other clothes do. Grabbing another armful of clothes, you stuff them into the bottom of the pack you're brought, along with some supplies.  The pack is a little heavy, but you're going to need practically everything in it.  Leaving your fortress, you bid the staff farewell and head out, taking a small contigent of soldiers with you, to carry your things. You take another good look at the basilicom from the hill nearby, admiring your creation. Whereas the other basilicoms are mansions and apartments, yours is a massive fortress complex made of dark stone veined with grey and violet. The Bastion, they call it. It's fitting.  Your guard of twenty escorts you for two hours, until the border starts to come into view. They quickly leave at your insistance, and you're on your own. Nodding and waving to the heavily-armed Leanbox soldiers, you pose as a tourist, and when you have to turn on the charm, you really pour it on. Thankfully, you only have to degrade yourself for a few minutes before they let you cross, and within minutes of crossing, the terrain starts to change. Whereas your nation is rough, and rocky, Leanbox has fields of gently rolling hills, with only a scant few trees breaking up the landscape.  It's... actually really nice.  You walk for several hours, keeping to the edge of the dirt and cobblestone road, and you stop when you see a patrol moving down the road. They seem pretty heavily armed, but don't immediately notice you.  A) Hide. They might give you trouble. B) Pass on by. You're just a tourist. C) Move to the side and skirt around them. D) Go through them. Violently."

You want to get a good look at the world before you decide what to do first. Maybe you'll go and take over another country... Hmm... It's hard to decide, really.  You only have to wait seconds before one of the librarians rushes in with the map, and being courteous for once, you lift your breakfast plate and hold it in your hands while you eat. The shaking, cowering man unfurls the map and straightens it out on the table, doing so until you wave him away.  Hmm... Let's see...  Your country of Valen is in the southeast of Gamindustri, with only a small bridge of land connecting it to the mainland. Attached to you, just north, is the nation of Calloway, ruled by your long time friend and rival Nanagra, CPU Orange Heart. It has roughly the same landmass, the same population, and the same number of shares... although the people love and worship her because she treats them fairly and kindly. Bah.  On the central landmass, connected to the west of you is Leanbox. It is the most powerful nation, with the most shares and the greatest military. It is ruled over by Verde, CPU Green Heart, who is loved by her people for her open, celebrity lifestyle. Pfft. They love her for her melons. Or maybe its the fact she is the only one of you who can go HDD Next.  North of that is Lowee, split into East and West due to constant arguments and disputes between its two very young CPUs. You know virtually nothing about the place, other that it has the smallest number of shares due to its division.  And further west is Planeptune. They are the most technologically advanced nation, and have a moderate number of shares, between yours and Lowee's. Their CPU, Nepuru, isn't very smart, or powerful, but she never gives up on anything, which makes the people love her all the more.  And finally, to the northwest of Leanbox is Lastation. They are currently going through a huge industrial reform, and their shares are rollercoastering because of it. Rumor has it their CPU, name unknown, is assisting in the construction of new factories. That is probably why their shares have been going up lately.  So far, the share distribution is Leanbox - 30%, Valen - 15%, Calloway - 15%, Lastation - 14%, Planeptune - 11%, East Lowee - 8%, West Lowee - 7%.  Hmmm... What to do...  A) Attack another nation. B) Just visit a nation, get some intel. C) Scope out your own nation, first. D) Quests. Get your shares up. E) Do some work."

They are wearing heavy metal armor, carrying long lances and wearing laser pistols at their sides. Typical Leanbox fare. Modern, with a touch of Medieval. Nothing at all like you, or your soliders, or your nation. For a moment, you debate simply defeating them and moving on, but you may have trouble taking on so many.  You try not to break stride as they close in on you. You're just a tourist, and they have no reason to bother you. One of them shouts gruffly, telling you to move out of the way, and thankfully, he doesn't seem to really notice you beyond that.  None of them do. They just keep walking, some of them eyeing you as they pass. At least... you think they are. It's hard to tell under their thick visors and heavy helms. You don't make eye contact, and you sigh inwardly as they go about their business without accosting you.  After that, it is a long, boring walk. You walk, and you admire the scenary, and after several hours, you stop by a beautiful shady oak near a babbling brook and an ancient stone bridge. Setting down for a rest, you tuck into the supplies you brought, preparing yourself a light lunch and drinking from the stream. This nation contrasts sharply to your own, which is much harsher, with little vegetation. Maybe you should change that...  By the time the sun starts to set in the distance, you've made it to the edge of a small town. You look around, but it's no more than a small handful of buildings clustered together. There are a few houses to the side, as well as a hotel, a general store, a bar, and a small guild station. There isn't even a Disc Developer here.  Well, at least its a place to stay the night.  A) Stay the night, get some hot food. B) Keep going. C) Find a place to camp out instead. D) Destroy the town. E) Get some food, then keep going."

In this dimension, Arfoire and Histoire created the four CPUs, and Neptune, Noire, Blanc, and Vert came together to defeat Arfoire when she tried to destroy Gamindustri.  Later, the candidates were created from their Share energy, and they all worked together to stop ASIC from resurrecting Arfoire.  And soon after that, Neptune, Noire, and Blanc retired, giving full power to their candidates. They simply left, and their fates and locations are unknown. And centuries later, Nepgear, Uni, Ram, Rom, and Vert defeated Rei when she tried to take over the world.  Over time, they would all create their own Candidates through Histoire, and then retire, and the process would continue until this cycle, with the creation of Grau and Nanagra, just before Histoire's death.  So Neptune likely won't be showing up any time soon."

gamindustri,2vw8fm,kuletxcore,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:48:09 2015 UTC,"Adjusting the straps of your heavy pack, you pull it up a little and walk towards the town. You don't see any people at all, but as you approach, you start to realize the town is actually a little bigger than you thought. The few scattered buildings aren't very big, but are all very modern, made of concrete and steel built to withstand fierce monster attacks. In your nation, you deal with monsters by finding their breeding grounds and destroying them. Wandering the streets of the nameless little town, you take a look through the window of the general store as you pass, making sure to scoff at the junk they're selling. You briefly consider stopping at the bar, but you're not in the mood for drinking.  You find the inn off to the side, and ultimately decide to stay the night. It's better than sleeping out in the cold, and you'll be vulnerable if something attacks you while you're sleeping.  The inn is a small, two-story building set on the edge of the town, with lots of small windows in the front. It has a very plain, beige exterior, with a big sign on the balcony that serves as an awening. However, the inside is an old, wood-walled tavern, with well-worn tables and chairs, a big, roaring fireplace, and a cute barmaid in a jumper and partially-buttoned white blouse. Smiling a little to yourself, you find a good spot in the corner booth and put your pack down, snapping your fingers and gesturing for the barmaid.  She doesn't appreciate the snapping, but still takes your order with a smile.  You're pretty hungry after a day's trek across Leanbox, and you just order whatever is on the stove right now, with some bread and butter and a cup of cold milk.  It only takes a few minutes for her to bring your food back, and she thumps a bowl of some kind of brown stuff in front of you, with a few slices of bread and a drunk. You dip your spoon into the bowl, and you... think it's stew. There's a carrot, and a potato, and a hunk of meat... You almost have to force yourself to eat it. One mouthful and your eyes widen a little. Surprisingly, it's delicious! While you sit and eat, you take in the atmosphere, enjoying the fire, and just as you finish the last bit of beef stew, you hear the chime of the bell over the door.  There is a pause before somebody darts into the room, moving quickly and checking back over their shoulders. The young girl glances rapidly around the room before settling on you, quickly walking over and setting down next to you, scooting next to you on the bench and making herself small. She has short, thick black hair with red tips, and the brightest yellow eyes. And she's carrying a great big grey suitcase, with big and blue red buttons around the handle.  Uh... She asks you to keep quiet as she leans forward to check the door.  A) Ask what's going on. B) Ignore her. C) Get a room and go upstairs. D) Push her off the bench."

gamindustri,2vw8fm,kuletxcore,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:50:31 2015 UTC,"Chewing a bite of the hunk of bread that came with your stew, you look the girl up and down. She's wearing a simple black blouse, with a knee-length blue skirt, underneath a red vest. You lean forward slightly and realize the inside of her vest is lined with pockets, and every one of them is stuffed with just random bits of metal. Wires, screws, nuts and bolts... She is obviously some kind of mechanic. Or a thief, you can't quite tell. She stays stone-still as she squeezes against the bench, trying to keep out of sight of the doorway.  You simply ask ""Can I help you?"".  After checking the door, she leans back against the seat again. ""I'm hiding from someone. So... shhh. I'm not here.""  You sigh. ""What did you do?""  ""I uh... kinda sold someone a defective weapon.""  ""You're a machinist?""  ""Inventor. I like to tinker. Now... quiet.""  Going back to eating, you spread some butter on to the bread and take another bite, washing it down with some of the milk. The bread is surprisingly good, despite being a little dry. After a minute or two of sitting and eating, the door opens again, knocking the bell off its hook andslamming against the wall, making the barmaid jump. Two smaller, unarmored men rush inside, waving knives, and just on their heels is the biggest man you have ever seen. He has to duck to fit through the doorway!  Dressed in low-quality Leanbox Guard armor and ragged monster hides, the enormous man glances slowly around the room. As he turns towards you, you notice his face and chest are covered in black soot, like something exploded in his face. He seems pretty agitated, telling his men to fan out and find the girl.  She starts trembling when he mentions something about breaking all of her fingers.  A) Help hide the girl. B) Turn her over to the thugs. C) Defeat the thugs for her. D) Ask if she can fight."

They seem pretty pissed off about whatever she did, which according her, was cheat them out of a bunch of money. Glancing to the gang, you watch them as they fan out. The innocent little barmaid begs them not to cause trouble, but they simply ignore her and continue to search. Leaning towards the girl, you ask if she can fight at all, and she nods nervously, telling you she isn't that strong.  Whatever.  You tell the girl to take a breath, and then you push her off the bench, sending her stumbling forward. She gasps sharply as she finds herself standing on her own two feet, in the middle of the room. Immedately, the thugs notice her, yelling and shouting, and the big one shouts ""Found you!"" as he starts towards her, laughing about what he plans to do with her.  Shoving the table away, you push it as hard as you can with your legs, launching it across the room and leveling one of the opponents. Not wasting a second, you get up quickly and step towards the closest thug. He turns to you with a look of surprise. Your heavy steel gauntlets pixelate in around your arms as you suddenly tighten your grip on his shoulder. The bones crunch sharply, and he screams in horror as you easily throw him against the wall. He hits with a loud, solid thud, and slumps to the floor, right into the seat.  The girl ducks as you swing your fist around, clouting the one about to grab her with the side of your fist, taking him clean off of his feet. She shouts at you and you turn on your feet, blocking the swing of a sword. It smashes against your weapons, and a couple of quick blows smashes the man's ribs, sending him to the floor.  With the thugs taken of, you can turn your attention to the big one.  He's almost on you as soon as you go to face him, and even a solid punch to the middle barely phases him. His counter-punch is wild, and you're able to dodge. As you're swaying back, he lashes out with an alarmingly fast kick, knocking you to the floor. You flip and roll out of the way as he stomps clear through the floor, and when you regain your balance, the girl is yelling at you to keep moving.  In the same breath, she presses a button on her suitcase and tosses it to the floor. The top half springs open, slapping against the wooden flooring, and a menagerie of springs, gears, and wires unfolds from it, culminating in a small, cylindrical missile. The end of the rocket spews fire as it pops off the bracing, flying right into the chest of the giant man. It explodes violently, blasting him through the door he came in with.  While you try to figure out what happened, the strange girl folds up the briefcase, smiling at you.  She's about to say something when the enormous giant comes back in, gritting his teeth and growling heavily.  ...Man this guy is tough...  You have 100 HP, 100 SP, and 0 EXE.  A) Rush attack - Raises EXE slightly. B) Power attack - Deals increased damage. C) Break attack - Enemy takes increased damage for a short time. D) Items - None.

You hope its a weapon, because you think you'll need the help. The giant of a man stepping through the doorway just took a rocket to the chest and it barely even slowed him down. He stomps back into the room as the barmaid flees upstairs, leaving you to do whatever it is you're about to do to the guy.  Because nobody f***s with CPU Grey Heart.  After that explosion, the man is a little slow on his feet, and his movements are very easy to read. You dip and sway as he swings wildly, bellowing in rage. With each attempted strike, he creates a wide opening, and you fill it with your fists. You give him a few good hits whenever you find a spot, and he gets angrier and less controlled the more you hit him.  It takes several long, grueling minutes, but you finally manage to put him down with a solid uppercut, finishing him off with your signature Dynamic Punch attack. He hits the floor hard enough to shudder the entire building, knocking glasses off of shelves and painting off of walls. When its safe, the barmaid pokes her head down the stairs, glancing around before tip-toeing down the wooden steps back into the tavern.  Waving out your fingers and dismissing your heavy, iron gauntlets, you assure her its over just as the strange, black-haired girl finishes assembling whatever took her so long to assemble. It looks like some kind of weird gun, with some bulbs and exposed wires, and she seems awfully proud of it until she notices the man laying on the floor, half-conscious.  As you're about to walk away, he starts to get up again, reaching towards you. You flinch sharply, and his hand is an inch away from your face when the inventor girl fires whatever the hell she made. A powerful laser beam whizzes past your head, trimming some of your hair on the right side, and when it collides with the man, he curses loudly for a moment before turning into a blackened smoking stain on the floor. Wide-eyed, you look from the stain on the floor to the girl, and she smiles innocently, telling him she just teleported him somewhere else.  ...So why didn't she do that earlier?  Because the idea didn't occur to her before, she responds, tilting her head to the side.  ...Uh, whatever.  Exhaling sharply, you try to decide what to do next, only to realize you're hungry again. You offer to help clean up the place a little, since its full of unconscious bodies, and while you're at it, you order another bowl of that delcious stew, with more bread and milk. Bowing, the sheepish barmaid thanks you and then hurries back into the kitchen. Packing up her briefcase, the black-haired thing thanks you for the help, and asks what your name is.  A) You don't have one. B) It's Grau. C) You are Grau, CPU Grey Heart."

I don't know how you've been playing up to now, but I usually find that killing every enemy spawn at least once and completing every quest the game throws at me are usually good ways to keep on top of leveling. It almost always makes any Nep game a breeze, and it's not too grindy, but it can be a bit of effor.  Wherever you are, find a recent dungeon with some easy enemies (dogoos, ghosts, flowers, stuff that isn't insane like a dragoon and preferably something that doesn't have a tough viral form) and just go nuts. It helps if it's a dungeon like the factory where spawns are in close proximity to each other instead of an area like the field where they're spread apart. Killachine 1.01 is in one of these dungeons, but I forget what the enemies are like in there.  And since Killachine 1.01 is in a dungeon, build up your EXE Gauge to max. Unload everything you've got at the start, then then pick one character to be a dedicated EXE user. I think your strongest one is probably MAGES., but you can use whoever you have in your party. Have everyone pop Rush moves until your best EXE user's turn comes up and have them use it. If you want, you can save one level for your finishers to help build the meter faster. It will help if you have good discs. A Final Fantasy disc (RPG, Fantasy, Orthodox) is easy to make and gives good EXE build. On enemies that heal huge amounts, you may want to hold off until you can unload the entire party's EXEs at once, but Killachine 1.01 doesn't regen, so there's no point in dragging the fight out.  You should be able to do it at level 40, but a few levels never hurt anyone."

gamindustri,2vop2o,Shardwing,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"It's based on the same engine as the ones already confirmed for Steam, right? That makes it easier to port."
gamindustri,2vl2co,reallygoodbee,2,Wed Feb 11 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"Generally you'll get weapons in 3 ways.   The shop will update as you progress. At first most weapons will be far better than the previous, later on some will have positives and negatives. This is how you'll get most weapons. You'll find plans when in dungeons. The little blue boxes occasionally have weapon plans in them. Find the required parts for the plan then you can buy the weapon. Sometimes you find actual weapons in the blue boxes although that doesn't happen a lot. The box's contents are fixed and only a few in the game have weapons."
gamindustri,2vl2co,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:04:20 2015 UTC,If you have the Fairy Fencer F DLC; beat Polytan. You'll be given a godly weapon.  Good luck fighting Polytan.

gamindustri,2v4les,Mechyoshi,1 point,Sat Feb 7 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Rebirth 1 has so many changes that they're two entirely different games. The only thing that remains the same is the setting, and even that's altered a bit.  That said, Neptunia 1 has much stronger writing and a better soundtrack than Rebirth 1, but Rebirth 1 has vastly superior gameplay. I also preferred Neptunia 1's endings to Rebirth 1's."
gamindustri,2v4les,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sat Feb 7 22:01:54 2015 UTC,What about 2 compared to Rebirth 2?
gamindustri,2v4les,zoruru1,1 point,Sun Feb 8 05:27:22 2015 UTC,The changes are less notable than 1. The current gameplay style started in Mk 2 and was built upon in Victory. As such it's slightly different in Rebirth 2 but the core style is the same.   Other major differences is the replacement of certain characters. Mk 2 had the hero of Justice Nisa whereas Rebirth 2 has the waifu obsessed Red. The game has the beautiful new Rebirth sprites as opposed to Mk2's ugly 3D models. As far as I can tell the story is far more similar to Mk2 than Rebirth 1 was to the first game. Granted I'm only playing Rebirth 2 at the moment so that might change. As far as I know there's a new ending in Rebirth 2 that wasn't in Mk2 but I'm pretty sure all Mk2's endings are present still.   And obviously the remake system is present and the new Stella's dungeon which although a nice little meta game isn't really anything to write home about. There's some new enemies in it too.   Overall I'm loving it. If I had to choose I'd say go for Rebirth 2 over Mk2.
gamindustri,2v4les,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Sun Feb 8 12:16:16 2015 UTC,"A quick question, do DLC characters show up from the time you buy them or do they show up in random parts of the story?"
gamindustri,2v4les,zoruru1,1 point,Sun Feb 8 19:59:35 2015 UTC,Which characters do you mean specifically?  Well I can't be sure as I don't have any DLC characters yet since it just came out in Europe but I'll go by Rebirth 1. In that there was a certain chapter (3 I think) where after you start it you could get them. To get them you'd just go to Planeptune and a short event would happen where they're added.   If you mean the Oracles then I believe they're added later in the story. I'm only on chapter 2 right now so I haven't got them yet.
gamindustri,2v4les,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:08:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok thanks!"
gamindustri,2v4les,zoruru1,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"Which game? R;B1 lets you add two of the three DLC characters in chapter 2. The other comes late in the game, chapter... 7 or something? And then in NG+, the same character will join at chapter 2 like the others.  In R;B2, there are no DLC characters.  The unlockables in both games come in at the very end. R;B1's will carry to NG+ from the start, but R;B2's, as far as I've been told (I'm not done with it yet), are only usable in the true end path at the last chapter."
gamindustri,2v4les,Daverost,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:28:34 2015 UTC,"100% agree on everything you said. The combat in R;B1 is a lot more fun, but I give HDN the win on absolutely everything else."
gamindustri,2v4les,Daverost,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion is that both are worth playing because they end up as very different games. The first game on PS3 is pretty hard to get a hold of, though, as I recall.  Personal opinion: The first PS3 game is still my favorite in the series. It definitely has some problems and a really bland combat system, though. It's pretty old-school menu stuff, like playing through a PS1 RPG with a really bad healing system. R;B1 is a lot more refined in terms of gameplay, but falls short of the original in a lot of areas. I always say it's like a ""Cliffs Notes"" version of the original, but with completely different endings. After a certain point, the story isn't even the same anymore. Characterization and plot are cut down pretty significantly and some things that I considered important are completely missing. It also almost completely cuts out the rivalry between the main characters, despite the fact that the first game's plot is entirely based on the real-life console wars.  Worth mentioning: The first three PS3 games are getting a collection release soon that will be easy to find and much cheaper, if you're willing to wait that out. It will be April in PAL regions and it's expected to be close to that for NA."
gamindustri,2uyuqf,Devoterlol,2,Fri Feb 6 08:35:39 2015 UTC,"It's usually not too bad. If you do all the side quests and don't run away from fights you should never really have any problems with regular enemies. Some bosses later on might require a bit of grinding to beat. If you're finding the the game to be too difficult, there's a plan you can make that makes it easier."
gamindustri,2uyuqf,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Fri Feb 6 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"That's usually how the series goes.  If I recall correctly, there are plans to boost your EXP, as well as chips you can use through the disc system."
gamindustri,2uyuqf,reallygoodbee,1 point,Fri Feb 6 14:20:43 2015 UTC,"Bosses and tough enemies are pretty tanky, so they might seem extra difficult.  The trick is to break their guard, then blow your exe moves."

gamindustri,2ur17a,CarrierT,3,Wed Feb 4 13:06:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rebirth 1 should be enough background on the characters for you to start Hyperdevotion Noire. All you really need to know is who the characters are."

gamindustri,2ur0h8,MarshManOriginal,3,Wed Feb 4 12:56:27 2015 UTC,What are you running it on?  Possible fixes:   Run it as Adminstrator Run it in Windows XP Service Pack 3 Compatibility Mode Try getting the newest Visual C++ Redistributable x86 files

gamindustri,2up5yi,Marorin,2,Wed Feb 4 00:22:40 2015 UTC,just unlock harder monster for a dungeon (i prefered the second snow area and the vulcano). The rat in vulcano area will deliver 170k exp : ) so leveling up is fast as hell.
gamindustri,2up5yi,Greevee,2,Thu Feb 5 11:53:49 2015 UTC,"In the plans, there is one in systems for EXP Up, buy and turn that on if you don't already have it.   There are also red chips in Disc dev that increase the amount of exp received, I use those on my main characters. I would recommend using them as there is quite a boost  If you have the naasne volcano, i would recommend grinding there as you get 8k a battle and each battle can take a couple of minutes at most. I personally found this the best way of grinding up. I went from about 55 to 75 using the method I described in a coupe of hours"
gamindustri,2ukoq1,Forever-Independent,2,Mon Feb 2 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"You need their plans. You obtain these in chapter 6 by getting the shares up to 50% of the nation that the oracle belongs to, then grabbing them from ""information"" in the city. Then just follow what the plan says to unlock them."
gamindustri,2ukoq1,BlancWhiteHeart,2,Tue Feb 3 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, man, that helps greatly.   But that means I can get all of them in one playthrough, right? Albeit I'll have to be jumping through a ton of hoops"
gamindustri,2ukoq1,somehokie,3,Tue Feb 3 20:36:05 2015 UTC,"Yep!  It's like getting the Candidates plans from the first Rebirth.  It's a bit grindy with the shares, but smart planning makes it easy enough."
gamindustri,2ul9fo,PersonaZero,3,Tue Feb 3 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"Watch it any time, really.  It only very loosely follows the events of mk2 and Victory, although it doe spoil a few key points of Neptunia Victory. Namely who Yellow Heart is and what Rei Ryghts' true intentions are."
gamindustri,2ul9fo,reallygoodbee,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"I would wait until you've played all 3 games,  so you know what is going on later in the series and not have anything spoiled. I waited myself."
gamindustri,2ul9fo,wildthing202,1 point,Tue Feb 3 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine. In general i think you should play/watch things in the sequential order of release but since you are starting with rebirth i think order doesnt matter. Neptune1, mk2, victory, anime, rebirth1,rebirth2. I started with the anime then played the game right after. I think different orders give different perspectives and appreciations for different parts of each game. Like knowing nepgear and playing neptune1 makes unlocking her that much more epic in rebirth1. Knowing Neptune's role in neptune1 makes the mysterious natural born hate between majekon and neptune in mk2 and victory."

If that happens to you try running the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3 and if that fails Service Pack 2. It helped fix another crash for me and others!

gamindustri,2tzizp,zoruru1,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"Would there ever be a reason to buy the games for PC over Vita which is more easily portable? Excluding being a huge fan, or just not owning a Vita in general."

gamindustri,2tw4t9,reallygoodbee,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:30:26 2015 UTC,I've been wondering the same thing. The screenshots look as if they are doing some kind of EX-move in battle so they MIGHT be playable (if so that means we get a lot of new characters in this game!) or it could just be a boss battle.  Hopefully we get this game before the end of the year.

gamindustri,2rov5c,Cornetto_Man,2,Thu Jan 8 01:23:10 2015 UTC,I see. I doubt that I'll be able to make everything.  When should I start make New Item or Add Monster plan though? Only when I see a quest with weird items/monster?
gamindustri,2rov5c,Cornetto_Man,2,Thu Jan 8 01:43:41 2015 UTC,You can make them whenever really. They can be switched on and off. The only thing is that the monster plans often contain tough enemies. So you might want to wait a little bit to actually use them.
gamindustri,2rov5c,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"I see. I was really trying to make and farm items for all possible plans before moving on with the story, then I scare that I'd run out of memory ...

I think Dark Souls really was the tipping point for all this.  Since then we've seen a ton of games that previously we would have assumed would NEVER EVER come to PC.  Deadly Premonition, FFXIII, Valkyria Chronicles, Ground Zeroes, Neptunia.  So glad this is happening."

gamindustri,2pgtte,KickassCookies26,7,Tue Dec 16 18:10:08 2014 UTC,This. I wish the anime could've kept Tsunako's style. Date A Live represents her style a lot better than the Nep anime.
gamindustri,2pgtte,Cornetto_Man,4,Tue Dec 16 22:02:00 2014 UTC,I guess so if you're not sure about the games. The anime condenses all three game's story-lines into one season so there might be some spoilers.

gamindustri,2m2vid,TwoOfSpades,4,Wed Nov 12 15:37:06 2014 UTC,"I'll translate the Tanaka Rie and Honda Mariko interview later tonight. It's too long.  Dark Goddess battles differ from normal battles. In normal battle the field stays as it is. The battle with Dark Goddesses moves to a special field(floating islands). The  battle takes place in various fields, Neptune and the others move to different fields while battling. The specialty of these fields is that normal attacks are not available, only skills can be used  While jumping from one island to the next, surrounding the Dark Goddess. If you can position the characters well, then you can activate a formation skill.  Depending on the field the Dark Goddess may get weaker but it is still a tough opponent  Among the 3 dimensions, the Dark Goddesses that appear in Zero dimension are approximately 30m tall. This is the largest enemy character that has appeared in the series thus far。 The Dark Goddess will repeatedly use a squeezing attack with it's hands。 If you repeated take damage from it's large build, it wil be fatal. You can confirm the name Dark Puple in the battle screen. It hascontains the name ""Purple. What kind of relation does it have with Purple Heart.  Orange Heart The goddess Orange Heart, Uzume's transformed appearance. Her personality energetic and bubbly is a complete change from her tomboy personality. In the ruined Zero Dimension how does she transform and gain shares?  Neptune Another Neptune that you meet in the Zero Dimension. She's a different person from the protagonist Neptune but her personality is the same. Travelling to different dimensions while carrying ""Nep's Note"" in her hand.  Arfoire appears in VII! The enemy that usually appears in the Nep series. The Arfoire that appears in this game is a different person but with the same name. The appearance maybe a little different but she is still a dangerous existance  Arfoire The mysterious woman that Neptune and the other meet in the Zero Dimension. Performing destructive acts around the world while destroying the world.  A new dungeon revealed A dungeon with all kinds of sakura trees.   The ruined world of Zero Dimension brings about the fascination of the sakura trees  What awaits on the otherside of those sakura trees-  The same dungeon appears in the Hyperdimension.  Jingu Zakura, an area that exists in the Zero Dimension.  But on the other picture is the same area in the Hyperdimension where Neptune takes naps. What is the meaning of these two picture!? The contents of the Hyperdimension will be introduced next time.  RB3 Remake system powered up. You can now powerup the characters.  New component 1 Customize the character with plans! Characters can now have their stats increased and gain skill. Gather the nessecary materials and power up your favourite characters.  HP up for a certain character, and an additional rush slot is in the picture"
gamindustri,2m2vid,reallygoodbee,1 point,Wed Nov 12 19:58:16 2014 UTC,"Awesome. Can we get some translations?  I really like Orange Heart's design, to be honest. Not so much her wings, but I like her suit and her hair O_o.  Also, I love how Dark Purple is measured in Neps.  Having an alternate Arfoire would be interesting, especially if she's playable. I noticed that in the dungeon screenshot in the second page, the party is Big Nep, Uranus, and Nepgear, and it only reinforces my belief that something is going to happen to Neptune :(  Now, what the f***ing hell are those frigging squirrel things at the bottom of the third page?  Seeing CGs like the one on the third page really makes me think that the CPUs should be able to switch clothes, without the clothes changing sizes. So, like, Blanc drowns in Vert's dress, while Vert barely squeezes into Neptune or Noire's clothes."

Speaking of level caps, the DLC characters are uncapped. Not that it matters if you're not buying the other DLC, but thought I'd throw that out there."
gamindustri,2jaejm,Redarmy1917,1 point,Wed Oct 15 04:20:34 2014 UTC,They are in Japan. Not in the west yet. They'd need to be patched.  Pretty sure f/f 2nd won't ever be compatible because of the touch notes.
gamindustri,2jaejm,Daverost,1 point,Wed Oct 15 10:52:18 2014 UTC,"Re:Birth should be soon, considering the JP list, and Hatsune Miku should be soon as well. I could be wrong, but that's what it's leaning towards."
gamindustri,2jaejm,ChiyoMihama12,1 point,Wed Oct 15 17:04:16 2014 UTC,"Well, I impulse bought it today, and it for the time being, Re;Birth sadly isn't.  Hatsune Miku does work on the Vita TV in Japan? Sweet, that just makes the decision of whether to buy the PS3 or Vita  f 2nd that much easier."
gamindustri,2j70eo,Pythia_The_Liar,2,Tue Oct 14 06:27:49 2014 UTC,OMG yay! Been waiting for something like this to happen. This has motivated me to continue translating the manga lol.
gamindustri,2j70eo,Johnypleasebegood,1 point,Sat Nov 1 15:28:06 2014 UTC,"Awesome. I was hoping somebody would do it eventually.  I have to ask, though, the only description I've found for the LNs is that they are ""HDN in a high school setting"". Am I correct in assuming that Neptune, Blanc, Vert, and Noire are normal high school students, and not actually living goddesses?"
gamindustri,2iwboz,TwoOfSpades,3,Fri Oct 10 22:22:03 2014 UTC,"My translations:  Pirachu's business rival is Chuuko, ""used goods"" in Japanese or ""used games"".  They started planning this right after Victory finished development.  They were going to release this as 3 separate games and they even made different logos for each of them.  Anon already translated the the Zero Dimension so I'll skip it and do Heart and Hyper.   Hyperdimension Mizuno: In the hyperdimension the usual 4 goddess Neptune, Noire, Blanc, and Vert appears. Recovery of ""Existence of the forgotten goddesses"" and the relation of the ""Gold Thirds"" and the 4 goddesses is depicted here. The Gold Thirds may appear to be enemies but they each have their own justice, they aren't villains.   Kochiwa: We'll be releasing details of the Gold Thirds in order. They are full of parodies.   Heart Dimension Mizuno: Last is the Heart Dimension, a world of mysteries where it reflects a person's heart. A form of the goddesses that are normally not seen. Anymore than this it will be spoilers.   Gold Thirds, rather than a transformation.....it's better to say it's a version up. On the contrary Big Nep is a normal human so she can't transform.   4Gamer: There are a lot of robot designs as the villains.   Mizuno: Fundamentally, this is a world there male characters don't appear. The unidentified character designs that closely resemble the goddesses are by Washinoo Tadahiro (TL: Not sure about the romanization of the name). and the Afimoujasu. by ToMo-san.  Kochiwa: For example if we have a handsome guy there are people who feel disappointment. If it was a regular character it wouldn't feel like ""Neptune"" at all. So we added that as a twist.  Mizuno: After that would be ""Umio"". In regards to Neptune he is a Histoire-like existence. Rather than Uzume's adviser, he is more like her Guardian.  4Gamer: From the existing characters the 4 goddesses and Candidates will appear but what about IF and Compa?  Mizuno: Of course they will appear.  Kochiwa: they will be regular party members. The number of characters will be fairly large.  Mizuno: In addition the goddess can transform. It was a lot of trouble to make them close to the goddesses. It will be a lively party.  Next is the battle system.  4Gamer: Tell us about the new systems  Kochiwa: We have made a completely new system this time. You can image it will be close the current system, and the combo system has been changed.  Mizuno: The concept of break has also been changed.  Kochiwa: Up till now the characters were dependent on weapons. We have added various modifications, there are effects from character customization as well.   4gamer: Until now, the range of the weapons we're used to wrap up as many enemies as you can was the most effective strategy, will positioning become important?   Kochiwa: That's correct. While making best use of the most interesting part, we have developed it even further. Details at a later date.   4Gamer: What about the enemies? Will the familiar looking monsters also appear?   Kochiwa: If there are familiar monsters, of course there will be new ones.  Mizuno: Extra-large monsters will also appear, but when you fight them it will be a special battle.  Kochiwa: In comparison to the Extra-large monsters, the characters will be tiny but because we can make use of the PS4's functions ...(TL:Something I don't know what he's talking about.)   4Gamer: Will there be other new battle components?   Kochiwa: The 2nd stage of transformation.  Mizuno: In addition to the normal transformation, we have also made ""Next Form"". Each of the goddesses have their own so please look forward to it. Among them ""Purple Heart""'s design was the most work.  Kochiwa: Noire's ""Black Heart"" is also good looking.   4Gamer: Then what about dungeons and other new components?   Mizuno: There is the hidden treasures. When you use and search for a treasure there will be a special condition you must fulfill so that they come out. In the world map you can open up your own route(TL: I don't know even know she mean by this.)  4gamer: Reclamation(path finding) of the world map? I wonder what kind of system it is, We look forward to the information. (TL: Again I don't know what their talking about).   4Gamer: We've only talked about this for a bit but this is a title developed for the PS4, in regards to that please tell us what was different.   Kochiwa: We didn't have any fears because we had help from the ""Omega Quintet"" team. Even then in comparison to the PS3, the PS4 has its own difficult parts to develop for. It's often talked about that ""developing for the PS4 is simple"", but on the contrary making the fog and lighting to some extent was difficult.  4Gamer: High specs have its own troubles too.  Kochiwa: For example, at first we thought of casting a shadow, but then we tried it, it didn't look good so in the end we left it out. It took weeks to finish making the shadows but to show the character's cuteness we had no choice but to throw it out.  4Gamer: I see.  Kochiwa: The PS4 was intended for real representations. When you pile up shadows the colours become dull, the intensity of the light suddenly changes the colours of the characters because of the calculations.(TL: Probably talking about how the engine they are using calculates where the shadows are cast.) . Possibly if the maps become too big it would be a lot of trouble. Despite putting in a lot of work into ""Omega Quintent"" the maps were too large to check. If we were dealing with larger numbers, it might advance the efficiency of development. ...something...(TL: TL: Too lazy to translate this part he just keeps going on and on about development.)  Skipping a question since it's just more about the developer info. 4Gamer: Was there anything you did specially for the PS4 for the character modelling?  Kochiwa: We have added various alterations. In particular the motions have been changed considerably.  Mizuno: The resolution of the textures are larger. When you observe it read it, it's easy to transmit.  Kochiwa: The textures used for the PS4 is really beautiful. Hypothesizing it is not enough. The development PC we used within the company wouldn't operate because the data was too massive, and it's still not enough. If that was the case, we had to change the structure but again that was a lot of trouble. An easy to understand portion more than the PS3 was bringing out the effects. Processing fog and particles is not a match to the PS3. After that might be the preferences. In any case after some trail and error, we had to be careful with the character's expressions.   4Gamer: To the players playing the game, what would be the most conspicuous part? Mizuno: That might be the mood. In comparison to the ""Neptune"" series until now, when you walk in the dungeons you might think ""This is completely different!"". Kochiwa: When you play it will feel changed. The movement is crisp, there is almost no loading time, ....something (TL: Too lazy to translate the rest since it doesn't seem important)   After this is FFF, fuck it I'm not translating it except for this:   It's not a remake/port , their changing the battle system.  4Gamer: I understand. Is there any genre the ""Neptune"" series would like to challenge?   Kochiwa: There are several. We're at a stage were we can't talk about it yet but we would like to try it. We would like to try a lot of things with this series.  Mizuno: ""Neptune Sports"" is something I would to try. The PS4 has an online function so we would like everyone to play together and because it's ""Neptune"" there are numerous characters.  Kochiwa: Aaah, won't someone make tennis?  Stuff about R;B3 but who cares about that. There's a message to the fans too. And that's teh last of it. I'll post a pastebin in a few minutes.  Anon >>82964252  Nepgear+Neptune fall into Z Dimension, meet big Neptune and Uzume, then the story goes Z>G>H while converging towards 1 big end, and Uzume is key to all of this(also she transforms and we'll see that eventually).  Robots are usually villains cause no males, they run a review site, Pirachu's ""business rival"" who owns a shop(?), the talking fish Histoire equivalent with the cool voice; the goddesses, candidates and IF and Compa should show up (the party's gonna be big), they changed up the combo system, potential character customization with weapons, then lots of talk about development for the PS4"
gamindustri,2iwboz,reallygoodbee,1 point,Fri Oct 10 22:22:40 2014 UTC,"Alright, awesome. I assume that by big party, they're going to include everybody in the series so far, minus Plutia and Peashy for whatever reason.  The Map Reclamation thing is definitely interesting. Maybe the game will be free-roam, or sandbox?"
gamindustri,2iwboz,ChiyoMihama12,1 point,Fri Oct 10 23:12:59 2014 UTC,I thought Peashy and Plutia is in the game. Isn't Ultradimension 1 of 3 dimensions in the new game?
gamindustri,2iwboz,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sat Oct 11 17:33:04 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, no. They are the Ragnarok Dimension, which has been almost destroyed, the Hyperdimension, which sees the rise of rivals to the CPUs, and the Heart Dimension, which reflects what is in a person's heart.

gamindustri,2ikq21,reallygoodbee,1 point,Wed Oct 8 11:27:44 2014 UTC,So it sounds like SP is going back to Mk2 SP from your description except they're combining it with EXE Gauge?
gamindustri,2ikq21,Redarmy1917,1 point,Wed Oct 8 15:45:52 2014 UTC,"As far as we've seen, yeah, it's the SP Gauge from mk2. You gain SP by dealing and taking damage, and it's spent on special attacks and transforming."
gamindustri,2ikq21,reallygoodbee,1 point,Wed Oct 8 17:27:38 2014 UTC,"Okay. Officially hyped for it now. I loved the feel that SP gauge gave to the game. Like, going HDD actually meant something."
gamindustri,2ikq21,Redarmy1917,1 point,Wed Oct 8 21:17:41 2014 UTC,"Personally, I found it too restrictive in mk2. Maybe without the AP Meter, it might be more forgiving, but we'll have to see.  Also, that's what you're excited for? Not the extra chapter they're adding?"
gamindustri,2ikq21,reallygoodbee,1 point,Wed Oct 8 21:43:07 2014 UTC,"Well, that too, but yeah. Going HDD just feels so ""meh, whatever"" Without having to have built up AP and keep it up with it constantly draining more and more.  Also, if you never knew Nepgear was able to hold HDD practically indefinitely due to Blue Sonic. Like, that mechanic made Rushes useful. Whereas in Re;Birth1 the only person with any rushes right now for me is Blanc and that's because she doesn't do too much damage to begin with, plus the 8 hits."
gamindustri,2ikq21,Redarmy1917,1 point,Thu Oct 9 02:32:32 2014 UTC,"I always found Rushes were only good for building up the EXE Gauge and using Combo Link.  And yeah, general strategy was to go HDD and then attack with some rushes to sustain it. Did the SP Drain increase over time?"

gamindustri,2iegph,reallygoodbee,2,Mon Oct 6 00:15:17 2014 UTC,"Hard to say. For the first game, I liked damn near everything, but the one track that always comes to mind when I think of the OST is The Gushing Broken Pipe. But all of the nation themes are outstanding, too, Planeptune's Theme probably being my favorite of them. Everything is great. I'd agree that it has the strongest soundtrack.  For mk2, it's definitely Go Love and Peace. Easily one of my favorite songs in the series.  Victory... Not sure. I'm thinking it's probably One, Two, Three. There are a lot of really good tracks in Victory, too.  PP has my favorite song in the series, the ED theme, Perfect * Quest, which is also my favorite credit sequence in the series.  Re;Birth1 has some good remixes of the original nation themes, but you barely get to hear them..."

gamindustri,2iegph,Redarmy1917,1 point,Tue Oct 7 21:20:15 2014 UTC,"Personally, I don't like how Plutia and Peashy are getting shafted lately. They appeared in Victory, Goddess Transmission, and the anime as actual characters. Then as DLC in Rebirth 1, they don't even get any events or anything, and Word Of God has stated they won't be in Victory 2 at all.  I don't understand why they'd just drop the two of them. I mean, they were fairly important characters. The entire second half of Victory revolved around Peashy."

gamindustri,2gy70i,VinnyVynce,1 point,Sat Sep 20 13:33:32 2014 UTC,Excited. I've only played rebirth so far but is victory a different storyline than 1 and 2?  Like how persona is different than smt.
gamindustri,2gy70i,cg001,1 point,Sat Sep 20 17:15:49 2014 UTC,"Each of the Neptunia games has it's own story line, aside from Rebirth 2 and 3, which are/will be remakes of Neptunia mk2 and Neptunia Victory. Rebirth 1's storyline only loosely follows Neptunia 1, afaik.  It's also worth noting that Neptunia 1 was designed as a stand-alone title. They couldn't make a sequel without either scrapping the whole cast or rebooting the series, and they decided to reboot, so the first game and Rebirth 1 are their own little continuity and have nothing to do with the other games. Aside from that, Victory is a direct sequel to mk2, and V-2 looks like it will be a direct sequel to Victory."
gamindustri,2gy70i,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sat Sep 20 18:06:26 2014 UTC,So rebirth one is one story line. Rebirth 2 and 3 are a storyline together. Hdn 1 is a separate story and mk 2 and victory are a continuation of each other while V2 follows victory 1 and mk2?  It's so confusing.
gamindustri,2gy70i,cg001,1 point,Sun Sep 21 05:21:15 2014 UTC,"Actually all Neptune games, to me, are standalone. You don't need any informations about the previous games to know what's going on. The only link between the games are small references and characters (The story don't really follow up). Rebirth 1 and U are in the first Hyperdimension while Rebirth 2 and the Beginning of Victory (Most of the game is in the Ultradimension) are in the second Hyperdimension. When a game is in another dimension there is no link between them because the Character are different (even if they look the same). But yeah, I didn't play Rebirth 2/3 so I have no idea if it changes a lot since the original ones on the ps3... EDIT: For what I read, Neptunia VII is standalone even if it's called Victory II, kinda weird to me. I also want to add that the only connection that I remember (except some characters of course) between MK2 and V is when Nepgear talks about the Deity of Sin during her narrative."
gamindustri,2gy70i,cg001,1 point,Sun Sep 21 06:17:21 2014 UTC,I'm not far in rebirth but does it eventually explain that there is different dimensions?  I've always wanted to play the series but jumped in at rebirth so I know nothing and I am only at the second island.
gamindustri,2gy70i,cg001,1 point,Sun Sep 21 07:11:01 2014 UTC,"A lot of things changed since the first game, Before the world was divided in 4 landmasses (Lowee, Planeptune, Lastation and Leanbox) and also there was Celestia, where goddesses lived. Since Mk2, The world is just 4 nations (not divided) and celestia is just gone. The serie really start to shine with Victory in my opinion (it's the first game with multiples dimension, and I think that's the way to go with the serie) and no they don't talk about others dimensions until Victory."
gamindustri,2gy70i,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sun Sep 21 08:09:23 2014 UTC,Okay. So why does everyone say the combat is boring in the first one?  Should I just skip it all together?  I can deal with boring game play if the story is there.

A Dreamcast rep, reps for Square-Enix, Konami, and a few others, a darker tone for at least one story with a more mature Nep... It all looks very interesting.  I don't think we have to worry about losing any of the main 4 CPUs, though. Even CH has to realize that would be suicide for the series."

gamindustri,2fsgly,infecteddeer,10,Mon Sep 8 07:46:25 2014 UTC,"It's a series about personified game console and game dev companies. The main characters are the CPUs (Console Patron Units), based around Sega, Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft consoles. From the second game on, these characters have little sisters based on those companies' handhelds. The two recurring game dev characters are based on Idea Factory and Compile Heart, the creators of the series. Various other console or dev characters show up game by game, and one of the spin-off games features characters based instead on series (Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, Street Fighter, etc.).  The first game, which Re;Birth1 is a remake of, is based on the console wars. The second game (getting its own remake in English next year) is about piracy. The third game is about the history of the video game industry. The first spin-off (PP) is a parody of idol sim games. The second spin-off (mentioned above) has not been announced for localization yet. I'm actually not too sure what the plot of it is yet. A sequel to the third game has been announced for PS4 and will consist of three stories in three alternate universes.  It's a generally light-hearted series full of gags and gamer-centric references (with a few anime references sprinkled here and there).  The original game basically re-used a lot of game engine resources from one of the company's previous games (Trinity Universe), so the reason you're hearing a lot of comparisons is that the remake is using the most recent version of the game engines custom created for the second game on (this one based more on the third game's version). The original wasn't bad, per se, but it was a very traditional turn-based, menu-based RPG combat system, with random encounters, and apparently people just don't like that anymore? The only real flaw it had was that you couldn't manually heal. Heals were set up as reactions based on conditions and were done automatically. (If you've ever played Final Fantasy XII, think of the Gambit system.)  It's a really fun series to get into if you like JRPGs and gaming in general.  If you have any questions I didn't answer, let me know. I'll be glad to help."
gamindustri,2fsgly,Daverost,3,Mon Sep 8 12:10:29 2014 UTC,Thanks for the great response it gave me most of the information I was looking for. One more question; what makes the combat system in this game unique to other JRPGs like the Tales series and such.
gamindustri,2fsgly,Daverost,2,Mon Sep 8 14:17:11 2014 UTC,"It's hard to say for sure that it's ""unique,"" because most things these days run on borrowed or similar concepts.  It has a bit of an active system to it where placement of your party members is key. With the right placement, you can keep certain members away from enemies, or ensure that your attacks hit more than one enemy (almost every attack has an area of effect instead of being single target), or you can even crowd an enemy into a corner to prevent them from moving. It's still a turn-based RPG, though. If I had to compare it to something, maybe some of the older SRPGs with free-roaming battle systems like Phantom Brave or Makai Kingdom.  It also features a custom combo system for your standard attacks that allow you to select from several options that vary in power or element across three attack buttons, each with their own attack type (Power, Rush, Break), as well as choosing from a variety of combo finishers.  Additionally, the CPUs and their little sisters (the CPU Candidates) have transformation abilities that will allow you to become stronger at the expense of your available skill points, allowing you to change your strategy up a bit.  But it's not strictly menu-based turn-based combat, nor is it full active combat like Tales.  It would probably help to look up some footage of Re;Birth1 or Victory online and see for yourself. (The Victory video is a little better at showcasing the combat.)"
gamindustri,2fsgly,lilcases,1 point,Mon Sep 8 18:13:38 2014 UTC,"The first game I believe was not completely finished and that was the reason it was so bad. The first game's storyline is not related to MK2 and Victory. The second game, MK2, also introduces a new battle system that continues into Victory and Rebirth. Now Rebirth is technically a remake of the first game, however there are changes into the story and the battle system is like MK2 and Victory. Rebirth has some ties relating to Victory but I wouldn't want to spoil anything. Correct me if I'm wrong about anything. I do recommend the game if you want to get into series."
gamindustri,2fsgly,Redarmy1917,2,Mon Sep 8 09:34:52 2014 UTC,"Quick clarification, Mk2 and Victory's combat are pretty different. I actually immensely preferred MkII's over Victory's. Though both are still miles and miles ahead and better than the original."
gamindustri,2fsgly,Daverost,1 point,Mon Sep 8 20:40:40 2014 UTC,"I felt like mk2's restricted you too much on your combos due to the way finishers worked, so I wasn't a huge fan, honestly. I think Victory and on nailed it.  What was it that you liked more about mk2?"
gamindustri,2fsgly,Redarmy1917,1 point,Tue Sep 9 13:07:28 2014 UTC,"How SP worked. I know EXE Drive is basically the replacement to old SP, but it also made turning HDD on more special.  Plus it then felt cool late game that Nepgear's rush attacks got sooo out of hand like, she could stay perma HDD."

You attach chips to them, and then reformat the disc later on, which destroys all of the chips attached to it and lets you attach new ones.  Some chips are considerably harder to find than others, but there are no missable or one-time chips, so go nuts experimenting. Worst case you just reload the file.  And certain Tough/Risky Foes drop medals, which can be traded for better discs, and once you have all twenty-six medals, you get a disc that holds a Level 5 Red, a Level 5 Blue, and a Level 5 Yellow chip."
gamindustri,2f3rht,reallygoodbee,2,Sun Aug 31 19:25:55 2014 UTC,Awesome thanks for the great detail!  Do the medals come from the foes I add to the dungeons using plans? Or do all tough foe types have a chance?
gamindustri,2f3rht,VinnyVynce,1 point,Sun Aug 31 20:09:26 2014 UTC,"I would also add that you can also create ""godly discs"".

Godly Discs adds a supplemental bonus to your disc, so watch out for that!"

gamindustri,2ezopn,ZachQuest,5,Sat Aug 30 07:58:46 2014 UTC,"Niche JRPG series that is slowly losing its Niche status. Purple Heart made the cover of Dengekki Playstation Magazine back in like April. Because people have trouble looking past the anime-styling and moderate-to-heavily sexualized character designs. Also, the first game was only really half-finished because they ran out of money. Gameplay-wise, you can expect a fun, if easy, JRPG with a moderate amount of strategy to it. The difficulty tends to spike a bit here and there, but it usually doesn't get that hard. Story-wise, you can expect a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, a lot of satire, and a lot of references to other games. Yes it is.

gamindustri,2ekjsh,KickassCookies26,1 point,Tue Aug 26 13:04:44 2014 UTC,"So, I played 3 hours so far and that's what I think about the game so far. First of all, in my opinion, this is one of the best Neptunia game released in the west. All the new additions such as the remake system works really really well. The framerate is really great (especially for an handheld), quite bad when you're entering in a zone, but it's recovering fast enough. They added some touchscreen features in combat: basically we can select a target/multi-target really easily. The music is awesome: Splash (main battle theme) is just so good! Most of the best BGM are back such as Dancing girl, To hell and most of the ""Characters theme"". Graphically the game is great, the environment textures take a hit though.. That's it for now, maybe I'll add more things tomorrow?  EDIT: forget to mention something important that I don't like about the game so far. The translation is not that great. Black Heart (not my favorite character BTW) have something strange with her voice (English voice), idk if they change the voice actor or something but it's really strange :/ Also, another thing: the quantity of voiced dialogs is quite low, like Victory, however, if you play with the Japanese voice these two shouldn't be a problem for you!"
gamindustri,2ekjsh,ziekke,1 point,Mon Aug 25 23:39:34 2014 UTC,"If Erin Fitzgerald is still the VA, I feel like Black Heart is voiced like that because of the way Noire is. Sure it feels a bit hammy, but if you think about it, Noire is a tsundere that's always trying to look cool, be admired by others, and tries to hide how much she actually cares about any given situation. Then when she transforms into HDD, all of her traits are magnified. It fits who she is, but it is odd to hear after hearing her non-HDD voice."

gamindustri,2e1pb3,tossturtle5,3,Wed Aug 20 02:56:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, each game has it's own story essentially. They all reference each other, but none of them are like continuations it seems. Then again I think the beginning of Victory does start off from sometime after MkII. Then they go to a different dimension.  Also, from what I've understood about Re;Birth 1, is that it's supposed to be fairly different from the original anyways, as if it's essentially it's own game.  Essentially, the older the Neptunia game you play the better, because each new one will make small references to old ones, which imo just makes the experience better knowing that. Hell, I know Re;Birth 1 references Victory. Also wouldn't be surprised if they referenced stuff from Producing Perfection, MkII, and hell, reference a difference between itself and the original.  Don't really worry about it, just pick them up and play."
gamindustri,2e1pb3,Redarmy1917,1 point,Wed Aug 20 04:43:02 2014 UTC,"thank you so much for your insightful response. It was really depressing to find Neptune in her older state because she lost her powers apparently and I got sad lol. Also,so rebirth is still sorta a remake of the original?"
gamindustri,2e1pb3,Redarmy1917,2,Wed Aug 20 05:39:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah. The overall storyline is supposed to be practically the same, but I know there's different characters in it.  Also, the ""spoiler"" you saw, wasn't really a spoiler. Talking about Neptune in her older state without powers is from Victory II, which is a game that will be essentially three different Neptunia games, having 3 different dimensions, and 3 different set of characters. One of them features Neptune without powers and grown up."

gamindustri,2e1pb3,Chemlicker,2,Thu Aug 21 05:48:05 2014 UTC,Each game isn't contiguous with each other. Each one is an alternate dimension.

The games tend to:   have an unimportant story have lovable and funny characters be loads of fun make me laugh, and generally put me in a good mood be super cute   With the exception of the original game, which Re;birth is replacing, the combat is turn based but has an area to run around with during your turn which affects targeting and range.  I like the combat quite a bit.  I've been looking forward to more Nepu for quite some time."

gamindustri,275c2g,reallygoodbee,1 point,Tue Jun 3 04:54:36 2014 UTC,I actually have no idea. I just saw it on nepgen and saved it.
gamindustri,275c2g,reallygoodbee,2,Tue Jun 3 05:53:49 2014 UTC,"I'm about 12 hours in and I just got to chapter 4. I've just got Estele, Ain Al and I've had the 4 goddesses, Restore, Riddo, and Li Fai.   In terms of gameplay it plays like an SRPG would, although I haven't played that many SRPGs. The number of characters you can have in a missions varies, it starts from 1 and the max I've seen is 7 characters. Each character has a leader skill that give bonuses, for example selecting Vert as leader would increase INT and STR by 10%, Restore's leader skill makes you immune to skill seal and increases INT by 10%.  In each map there's gimmicks that could either help you or obstruct you and treasure boxes. Some treasure boxes you can't open normally just by hitting it, you have to equip a crystal that the box is weak to so that you can open it. As for the gimmicks there's boxes to help you climb on to higher ground or you can throw it to an enemy, there are other gimmicks such as pitfalls, moving platforms, electric floors.  Then there's lily boosting, it makes everything overpowered. The lily gauge bar, is like the exe drive in Victory/Re;Brith1/2, except it's much easier to fill since you can just fill it up in 1 turn and have a character be surrounded by 4 other characters and have that character use a supermove and the gauge will still be at 100 since lily boosting increases damage, reduces cost, and still fills up the gauge.   This is also the way to increase lily ranks, however they don't really do anything else, it's also the way to unlock the true ending. The characters also don't talk about the kissing mechanic other than a tutorial from Histoire. Increasing the lily ranks gives that character some events, either with Noire or the SI or both. \  In terms of story not a lot has happen so far. At the start is Noire's battle with the other goddesses (that preview video from CH's youtube channel). Then Noire gets tricked by Eno (Arfoire) to make a wish to the share crystal for the unification of gameshijoukai, which causes Noire and the other goddess to lose their power. After Noire meets the SI and helps her regain her power and he gets appointed to be her secretary. You battle Nep, Blanc, and Vert again to decide who the leader is. After that you start trying to find the other military commanders (the characters that are based on a game). And if your asking ""Is there romance with the SI"" like everywhere else I've been to, to discuss this game there hasn't been any yet.   As I said I haven't gotten that far, there's 9 chapters and expected completion time is about 30-50 hours."

Neptune and I we're the same size  Panel 3: It was a new feeling being able to touch your cheeks when I reached out my hand (Not sure if this is would be a good translation for this.)  Panel 4: When I do that I get all worked up. (Not sure if this is a good translation for this)  Panel 5: To Neptune-san...  Page 2:  Panel 1: I did the iron claw (Again a rough translation it's hard splitting up sentences)  Nep: I didn't hear that wrong!!!  Panel 2: Another day  Noire-san I lo...ve...you...

Im not really sure, but from the requirements listed (no spoiler there) i think there are 2 possible endings after you trigger the extra chapter. It would be the old conquest ending, and Holy sword ending which scene is probably shown here.  Edit: are these screenshots from your own gameplay? If it is, is my speculation correct?"
gamindustri,238z50,reallygoodbee,1 point,Thu Apr 17 07:15:20 2014 UTC,"It's not my own, these were screenshots someone from /nepgen/ posted and I just translated them. There is a new ending.  It's another route that branches off the conquest ending called holy sword. The requirements are that you have lily ranks 8+ with Nepgear, including the makers that don't join you automatically. If you ever want to go to conquest end just don't recruit those makers.  Also do you have Re:Birth2? If you do could you take screenshots of the scenes after this, I'll translate them all and repost it here."

That might open the doors to other characters, as well."
gamindustri,23006r,reallygoodbee,1 point,Mon Apr 14 14:10:27 2014 UTC,Dengekiko is the scout from Victory it's Dengeki's Mascot/Maker with the yellow hair.

Hyper Dimension will be about the forgotten goddess' whose existence was stolen away from her and the relation between godesses and goldside.  Heart Dimension will be an adventure into the heart of a goddess, her normally hidden away goddess form might become clear in this one. Because this is no sequel to V, Pururut and Pishe is out of question  They've been working on it since before FFF and ended up throwing so many ideas that they got 3 stories out of it.  They did Uzume's name differently using english letters and hiragana, spending months just to find the perfect name for her.  Can Dengekiko transform like the other goddesses? Well, the truth is, yes, she can! It's not goddess transformation but she can transform. Please wait for more info  What does the U in the title mean? It's a secret, for now Geki Noire is 99% done  Uzume's hotblooded and it has something to do with the setting. The megaphone is her weapon and she will sometimes throw it aside to brawl.  Adult nep hasn't changed much inside and is different from hyper dimension nep. Both versions will be meeting in the game. Is adult nep same as the one from V true end? Think of her as not!goddess nep that grew up(lol). Adult nep gets called by different names in the game, Nepgear(Big-oneechan) & Uzume(Huge Nepchi). Tanaka Rie's taking on 3 roles this game.  Uzume and Big Nep are very colorful characters, but when you say Neptune it has to be her.  Tsunako's drawings have more girl power to them than ever  Sisters, IF, COmpa and Histy will show up. Don't count on Pururun or P-Ko though.  Gold Third/Side/Sade are not villains but rivals with opposing ideologies. Like the goddesses are consoles, they have their own motifs.  Side characters so far are Chuuko(a rat) and UmiOtoko/Seaman/Aquaman. Chuuko can be considered Warechu's business rival while Aquaman will be the most sensible character serving as Uzume's Histy - we haven't decided what he'll look like though. He'll be a heavy character in a way and we plan on giving him cool stud's voice.  I drew Uzume with ""Neptune's older cousin part 2"" in mind. Part 1 was pururun. That said she doesn't look very Planeptuneish in all three parts. At first glance, the concept would be ""Salaryman on the brink"". She's wears a rough kind of jacket but this character survived fighting in a destroyed world so she's rather frank and wears whatever she pleases so we settled on shirts and shortpants worn loose. Incidentally because the buttons are being used, she just forces them in place with suspenders. As you can see, this leaves the necktie and the megaphone as the stand out points... the very personification of ""fanciful"" game of course.  They've done a overhaul on the systems. There are special battles with big enemies, you can carve out your own routes in the world, hidden treasures are redone there are a whole lot of things to play with in the system. They've deepened the character customization, coupling and combo systems. We threw out the design plans to make her a cheerful character but we gave her just as much impact as neptune and pururun leading to this manly form. Her worldview also matches how she looks. From there, Uzume's character steadily shaped the story.  If you can recall, I included an illustration in one of the visual books that looks just like this Neptune with same clothes only with bits of nepgear's looks and color scheme... Basically, we went with podt transformation colors here. As for where she came from, she may or not be the same one from V's true end. While we won't ask you to play V before VII, it's perfectly fine if you do it the other way around too. Incidentally I saw Adult Nep's 3D mode dual wielding and her in battle pose seemed new. She's normally a sword character but she also has a gun holster there that she uses. The gun is the same as from that artbook, ""Unlabeled""(?), I mentioned.   These 4 girls are called Gold Third/Side/Sade by those around them. They are not a group though, they are top leaders and charismatic... it's kind of an honorary title. Each one is different from the last so I had a lot of fun with all these individuals. Also, they have power up forms not too different from the goddesses."

Well, I guess CPU Neptune's story is finished, for now.  Hopefully, all of these little adventures are part of one big story arc, and not just separate events."
gamindustri,22mmtl,reallygoodbee,1 point,Wed Apr 9 20:55:50 2014 UTC,"Also, reading that again...  No Plutia or Peashy? Really? After everything that happened in Victory, they're just going to straight leave them out?  Any indication if the other CPUs will still be playable?"

gamindustri,22mmtl,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sun Apr 13 23:28:45 2014 UTC,Hopefully playable Rei. My guess is probably all the goddesses with the candidates. I want more MAGES for the makers though that's for sure and you can't have a Nep game without IF and Compa.   At this point they might actually have over 20 playable characters like in Re;Birth 2.
gamindustri,22mmtl,reallygoodbee,1 point,Sun Apr 13 23:34:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah, playable Rei would be interesting, if she isn't completely bats*** insane like she was before.

gamindustri,22jx66,TwoOfSpades,1 point,Tue Apr 8 21:50:19 2014 UTC,"Release Date: 2014 Platform and price: TBA Producer: Mizuno Naoko Director: Onodera Shingo Character Design: Tsunako  A new character Tennosei Uzume is introduced (I think her name is Uranus). She has red hair in twintails, and an orange and black megaphone with a swirly thing in her hand. Maybe she represents the SEGA Dreamcast?  Another twintailed character, with blonde hair  Grown up Nep-Nep. Unlike her Hyperdimension self, this one is not a Goddess, so she can’t transform, and maybe even grows too.  The story takes place in 3 dimensions:  Reijigen Neptune Z (Zero Dimension), The Cornered Goddesses’ Ragnarok Choujigen Neptune G, The Golden Vanguard, The Existence of Industry Innovation Shinjigen Neptune H (Depending on the specific context: Heart/God/New Dimension), Trilogy Finale, and Thus Into a Legend Rough designs of Neptune G characters  More info from the scan: -Grown up Neptune will use a gun like the first game Neptune -Grown up Neptune is playable -They say those who has cleared V might already have a guess for her real identity"

Second image: Interesting design choice for Grown-Up Nep. If she's really going to be playable, I wonder what's going to happen to the real Neptune...  Third image: I'm not sure what to say, other than that she has Purple Heart's hairstyle. Considering the full image has a megaphone with a modified Dreamcast swirl and a pin on her sock that says ""I (Heart) DC"", I can only assume she's another Alternate Neptune, and the blonde girl with pigtails is her HDD form."

gamindustri,1zqmj1,reallygoodbee,2,Thu Mar 6 18:39:48 2014 UTC,"The lily ranks are the longest part of the plat for victory. A helpful tip is to equip all front line fighters with a Lily Rank +5 and keep spamming an arena fight that you can one-hit kill. Mine was level C or D i think, where you get the ""Christmas"" and ""Monday"" enemies, and I'd use Plutie's multi-attack skill to finish it quick. At this rate you can have about 8-10 battles per minute (assuming data is installed, load times are the longest part), and with lily rank +5, thats one rank per minute for each front character.  There is also a glitch because not everyone needs to be 10, I had all but 1 at 10, and that one was at 8 when it decided to give me the trophy. just keep at it :)  Sorry if my terminology is a little off its been a while."
gamindustri,1zqmj1,rtlsdr_is_fun,1 point,Thu Mar 6 19:35:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the way the Lily Rank system works, it goes up to 10, but you can get it to 8 for everyone and still get the trophies.
