People complain about Reddit's comment section, and how there are often jokes in poor taste to the article posted, but you still find honest discussions which are genuinely interesting.   9gag, on the otherhand, is full of people literally always hitting on girls. A girl will comment on a picture, and suddenly 9gag is just full of horny teenagers posting weird comments. It's so bad I'm honestly not sure if it's some massive circle jerk, or if they're genuinely serious. I once looked at the comment section, the highest upvoted comment was ""Hey guys, just got a new haircut, what do you think??"" and a load of guys just praising her.

9gag,3bat6c,pepedelarare,16,Sat Jun 27 12:49:42 2015 UTC,"Aside from showing that 9GAG isn't funny and that 9GAG lacks good content, this shows one of the most important things that I think we all have to remember on this sub - That 9GAG is basically run by high schoolers. I mean, there are gonna be people on there who are 30+. But 8,000 upvotes? Over finishing high school? I mean, congratulations to the kid who just finished the easiest part of his life so far.   But he probably doesn't know that high school was the easiest thing he's ever going to do. And 8,000 other people don't know that either, because they're fucking high schoolers."
9gag,3bat6c,buffalog,10,Sat Jun 27 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"That's a really important thing to remember.  About one year ago, someone made a survy in the comments about the age of 9gagers (they had to like the post corresponding to their age), and most users where around 15 or 16.  It's important to understand why 9fags act like they do. They are teens. 9gags OC is a compilation of /r/im14andthisisdeep and /r/im14andthisissmart because they are 14!"
9gag,3bat6c,alphasocke90,3,Sat Jun 27 19:49:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Let's face it - It's mostly young people on 9GAG. The jokes are sometimes terrible, the grammar is awful, and people on there just aren't at the same age most of us are. When I was 14 or 15, I would probably have loved 9gag. It's simple, easy to use, and doesn't require you to really think. I'll be the first to admit that I still browse 9gag every now and then because sometimes, when you're tired but not tired enough to go to sleep, it's a good way of just passing time till you're ready to pass out.  Of course, we can't forget that a lot of what we see on 9GAG is taken directly from Reddit. However, those are usually the mods who are adding the best that Reddit has to offer to their website in an attempt to drive traffic towards their ad-funded website. They probably make a killing off of it as a result."
9gag,3bat6c,buffalog,3,Sat Jun 27 22:35:28 2015 UTC,doesn't require you to really think   That explains a lot...
9gag,3bat6c,Jowsten,4,Sat Jun 27 23:07:07 2015 UTC,That's a matter of perspective. For a lot of people high school was one of the more difficult challenges they will ever have to face.

These fuckers go crazy lenghts to make 9gag look stupid (and let's be honest, Reddit is often like that too, depending where you look). The reason why I hate 9gag, is because they act like Nazis. They steal shit from Reddit, EVERY FuCKING DAY. And not just Reddit. They steal shit from buzzfeed (haha, buzzfeed) and 4chan (and we steal from 4chan too, but I will get to why 9gag is horrible son). And they censor words. Your comment says reddit? Nobody will see it. Your comment says buzzfeed? Bye bye. Admins? Gone. And bots don't steal shit, people do. And then they give it 300 upvotes. 9gag community is a bit dumb (obsessed with the ""nice guys can't get laid"", sausage gifs and that sort of bullshit), but what made me leave where the Nazi mods.

Spending a couple days on both makes you realize the colassal amount of effort 9gag puts into stealing things from reddit. 9gag's commenters are all-around pretty vile people, and sometime hilariously so. Since 9gag nabs at least 50% of its entries from reddit, it makes sense to have a reddit page pointing it out when 9gag goes so far out of its way to pretend reddit doesn't exist.   And why we feel the need to have a 9gag subreddit; I'm subscribed to /r/KingstonOntario, live in the US, and have absolutely no interest in Canada or ever traveling there.  There are much more useless ways of spending my time on reddit besides seeing what dumb crap 9gag did today."

But they are making money from stolen work claiming it as if it was theirs. They put a watermark on a stolen picture, put a few ads next to that, maybe copy the topcomment too.  Now comes the part where I get involved: I work in the media industry. Piracy is in fact a problem, but it seven worse to see people making money and getting the attention for something you work hard on. It's like a punch in the face.  Whoever supports such concepts as the 9gag one deserves to be robbed out just to feel how it feels to see people getting money and being happy while the own work is worth nothing. 9gag is stealing. Many posts on Reddit are not original content too, but we don't claim everything as ours, Reddit doesn't live from stolen content."

Seriously, only a small percentage of content that makes it to the front page are actually submitted by a user. The rest is submitted admins disguised as regular users and given fake free upvotes. This subreddit exists to make people aware of how broken 9gag actually is. Reddit has five rules, 9gag has like fifty rules, and all of them are unwritten.  Also, I don't really understand the edit part. I know 9gag doesn't have sub9gags, but how is this relevant? Reddit has the front page which shows you the best of all subreddits you are subscribed to, and also the All section which is basically like the hot page on 9gag in that it shows you the best of the whole website."

The point of the list is to provide some kind of transparency and provide a way to write your comments around the censoring system. This requires the list to be easily accessible to anyone.

At some point the automated censoring will not be sufficient anymore. They can make it stronger and stronger which will also make it more intrusive, which will make more people notice.

9gag,39p841,silver_nuke13,6,Sat Jun 13 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"whats this? an actual discussion instead of just gossiping and hating? well, this is a nice idea. their censoring system is becoming better and better. it feels to me as if they remove any comments that make an attempt in tricking the censoring system, like if you write w0rds l!ke thls, they just assume that you are writing something they dont like and block your comment.  for a plugin i think you could make something simple that quickly logs you out and in to check if your comment is blocked. of course you wont want this to happen every time, so maybe have some kind of button that can enable and disable the feature, since usually you know when you are writing something that might get blocked. also a possible tip: i think when your comment is blocked, the comment count (for example 133 comments) does not increase, so you might be able to detect if your comment was blocked by comparing the comment count, unless it is not updated instantly.  also i found it strange that people were able to post comments with upside down text, since i actually tried that earlier, but got my comments blocked. maybe it is the combination of ""strange"" letters and normal text, and if you only use strange letters it assumes that its another language or something. whatever it is, their censoring system seems to be pretty clever."
9gag,39p841,derkevevin,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"There's a little loop in the system. By default, it displays the OP thread and 2 comments after that. Then you are able to load more comments. However, if there are only 3 comments, out of which one is ceonsored, the show more button will still be there, but it will disappear after pressing it, without showing more.  I tried with upside down text as well, but if it gets too popular they might remove it manually or censor the upside down characters."

9gag,39p841,konfu1,3,Sat Jun 13 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"i guess you could make a beautiful soup for that, but i think individual comments are easier to test, plus not every comment is going to be censored.   Someone could even build a bot that creates crap posts in the vote page, where nobody ever looks, and post words one-by-one from the english dictionary in the comments, and see which words are ruled out. with additional suspected words that exist in the internet slang (like how they ban the word reddit)  BTW do you know what is the comment quota? 30-40 comments every 24 hours or so?"

Those people have no idea about design, what fonts and spacing to use, it's almost as if that picture was made by a random simpleton on the internet with no technical knowledge of how even paint works."

9gag,396g8g,Skroopy,17,Tue Jun 9 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do. In my experience, you get 300 upvotes when the admins transfer your post from Fresh to Trending (which is well known) and 3000 upvotes when your post is transferred from Trending to Hot. I always monitored my posts on 9gag, and noticed those huge jumps that didn't make any sense at all.  The notifications only display the number of people who upvoted your post. Since those admin-upvotes don't come from real users, they are not seen in your notifications."
9gag,396g8g,cedriceent,4,Tue Jun 9 16:37:44 2015 UTC,they use huge numbers to make it appear like their site has a lot of traffic
9gag,396g8g,silver_nuke13,6,Fri Jun 12 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"Yep happened to me as well. I had two posts come to the hot page. Both had 400 extra upvotes when they reached Trending and 4000 extra upvotes when on Hot. It's because the moderators decided to push forward the post but a post with for example 20 upvotes can't be on Trending, so they add extra points. The notifications only show the upvotes from actual users.   Well this turned out to be exactly what cedriceent said but whatever"

9gag,393aen,jonneburger,11,Mon Jun 8 23:45:57 2015 UTC,Maybe OP meant raising awareness of 9gag's censorship by informing other people through other social media or even small news agencies/websites.
9gag,393aen,konfu1,5,Tue Jun 9 04:18:12 2015 UTC,"Yes cocoabean_wot, that's the kind of thing I have in mind. For example, I've made a video about it a few weeks back and I've posted it on YouTube and I've been trying to promote through my website, through Reddit, Facebook groups and all other means I have at my disposal. The video I've made is a bit crude and doesn't really encompass all of the things I wanted to share  but even so it gathered 550 views in a somewhat short period.  I think if we were to gather a few of us that would do the same thing in an organised and professional way, I think we could send the message a lot further."
9gag,393aen,konfu1,4,Tue Jun 9 07:42:08 2015 UTC,"I linked your video in my list post, if you didn't notice ;)  As for a campaign, I don't really know how to approach it. Just telling people online/offline of it on occasion is propably best."

They won't leave 9gag, because they don't care about the censorship. Especially not, when they are not able to ""just scroll"" on other websites.  Active people will sooner or later realize the censorship, the copied content or the stupid community. They will find this place (just enter 9gag on google or wikipedia).  14 year old kids, who do not realize, how bad the 9gag-community actually is, should stay on 9gag. We don't need them!"

Bao Bao is one of only several hundred giant pandas alive today in captivity, a small fraction of the fewer than 2,000 giant pandas in the world.  Bao Bao was born on August 23, 2013, at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Giant pandas are an endangered species, and are protected in part by conservation efforts at reservations and in zoos such as the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington D.C. Giant Panda births are rare. The cub of Mei Xiang, Bao Bao is a result of artificial insemination of Mei Xiang on March 23, 2013.

9gag,390u25,Gachl,3,Mon Jun 8 12:42:31 2015 UTC,"What you describe happens to all sites, when they become popular.   It does not mean that most people are stupid and its not necessarily a bad thing. The ""opinion"" of the majority wins and if it is a community which is tolerating bashing and hating, every different opinion disappears. They could prevent that by separating the people in different Communities with similar interests (for example: Subreddits).  9gag is a Community about everything (like Facebook or YouTube), just look at the Mainpage, out of the first 5 pictures, there are just 2 which are supposed to be ""funny"". It's a logical development, that it gets more ""Mainstream"" (again: not necessarily a bad thing) and simultaneously maintains some kind of ""unique"" style (Emma worshiping, sexism,...).  9gag never was ""better"", it was always a copycat-site with horrible OCs and censorship. It's just 3-4 years old. But it was a smaller community back then and a smaller community is more ""forgiving"" about different kinds of people.  And 9gag is for lacy people. You just scroll threw the pictures and click on like or dislike. So it attracts people, who are not willing to contribute anything, they just want to get entertained.  There is no ""just for real nerds""-Community, because nobody knows what a real nerd is ;) (Google the difference between Nerd and Geek) There are so many hobbies which are considered ""nerdy"", that every platform, which tries to unite all those different people, automatically becomes ""Mainstream"" (even if there are just people with nerdy hobbies).  For example: I'm heavily into OpenSource-programming and GNU/Linux stuff, but when i talk to a StarTrek-Nerd, it's basically the same as talking to ""not-nerds"", because we don't have similar interests ;) Nerds are Kellerkinder, but they have different reasons for that (introverts, addicted to their hobby, shy or ""i hate people"").  Try to find a community about something you like and you will find ""nerds"" like you :)"
9gag,390u25,alphasocke90,0,Mon Jun 8 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your extensive feedback. While lots of it is true, most of what I wrote is based on what my personal experience has been and still is with 9gag and the people that I know browse it, it may very well deviate from what the majority does. I guess it's more about the imitating and not adapting of (the) growing community(ies) to laid foundations, kinda.  It's also true what you say about nerds, I used this term more in a derogatory way, if you are a nerd you are more likely to call yourself a geek.  And lastly, I somewhat like a concept that 9gag was probably built on when it all began, that is having a central place for your content, not having to shuffle through six different websites and subforums. I'm sure 9gag used to be just that and did not mean to steal, rebrand and practically resell other peoples OC but rather have the good stuff come up, be reposted, in a central place. There are not many around anymore and the whole 9gag thing has made a whole wrong turn somewhere. I guess I'll be on the lookout for the next small community before it bloats up again :)  edit: words"

9gag,38ip4f,Draco6slayer,4,Thu Jun 4 15:56:07 2015 UTC,I thought he did the cosmetic surgery as a way to sort of go all in on the disease. Being spotty is worse than being albino.

First, look for either a comment pointing out the 300 upvotes, or at the vote tally. If it's 300-310, it's probably a HOI post. After that every second post after it will be a Hot on Internet post. It seems as if trending automatically puts up a HOI post to go with a user post."

9gag,37yj3n,Pawel1212,2,Mon Jun 1 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"It was probably because of my comments/posts. Some of them were ""anti 9gag"" Because I tryed to explain how they rip off post from other sites and how the auto upvotes work. But the worst thing of all was that they banned me without a word.

9gag,3744yk,iSetRainToTheFire,12,Sun May 24 18:34:08 2015 UTC,Well I meant that there is a huge subreddit called ELI5 which they just stole

9gag,370wby,benedrix,2,Sat May 23 21:32:07 2015 UTC,So it's a shitpost with 18.000 points.
9gag,370wby,ImNicolasCage,-8,Sun May 24 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"maybe because we 9gaggers are not dead serious elitists like you. hmph. anyway, since you are a moderator here, can you tell me: why or how is reddit so much better than 9gag? ive seen the ""repost machine"" post here, and rumors on 9gag (we are not all dumb ""sheep"" over there) which is why i ended up here in the first place. at first i was disgusted by 9gag, but after seeing this post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1xoy7x/why_is_9gag_hated_so_much_around_the_internet/  i was skeptical. and after seeing more posts here, im starting to think that you (or at least some people here) just ""hate us cause you aint us."" without much reasoning. also it seems that a lot of people here are former 9gaggers which were -to say the least- disappointed in 9gag, so they came here. and some people tried to change 9gag but failed...  anyway, enough of that. i dont know reddit a lot yet, but something that i dislike (when it comes to memes/pictures) is that you have to click on every single post, or open it in a new tab, while in 9gag you can just scroll. which is pretty nice, which you should be able to admit. if 9gag wasnt based on a good concept, it wouldnt have gotten so popular after all. but maybe the reddit UI has its advantages too. in that case sorry for being ignorant of those. im also sorry for possibly offending you and other people here, but depending on your maturity you should be able to see that im  just trying to keep an open mind and discuss. but if this place is only fueled with blind hate, you can go ahead and (ironically) delete my comment, i'll know that im in the wrong place and you wont see me again...  thats all for now. sorry for the random wall of text, have a nice day :]"
9gag,370wby,derkevevin,7,Sun May 24 07:30:02 2015 UTC,"You already listed the main reason (blatant stealing of content), so I'll list some others:  Watermarking  Infantile userbase  Unfunny content  Anime fanboys  Misogyny   Unfunny comments   Unrelated comments  Vote manipulation   Censorship  Creepy pick-up lines  Attention whoring   Emma Watson ""is our queen""  ""9gag nation""  You've been using reddit for quite some time already. Take a closer look and you'll find the differences."
9gag,370wby,ImNicolasCage,-4,Sun May 24 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"Watermarking: i think this is acceptable for content made by their users. with the stolen content its another story.  Userbase: i dont think being childish (in a good way) is a bad thing. why would you be dead serious on a site that is about fun? the 9gag motto literally is ""why so serious?"" of course there are idiots and assholes, but im pretty sure that applies everywhere on the internet. and there are many cool people as well. also, now that you mention it, i never see troll comments on 9gag :O  Anime fanboys: well ive heard complains of people, but never seen fanboy posts or comments by myself. instead i see more anime hater comments than comments of people who like them. its almost like people see it all over the internet and complain about it on 9gag :l same with bronies for example. i also dont like exaggerated ""fan service"" anime (and posts about them) but if you hate them, you can just scroll past them.  Misogyny: yeah, many people are frustrated with women and probably dont think about what they write. its probably the same people who make the creepy pickup lines -.- on ""women hate"" posts there is usually someone (male or female) in the comments telling them how stupid they are. and there seem to be quite a lot of female 9gaggers as well.  Unfunny comments: for the unfunny comments that are there: (at least you tried gif here) and if you know a place where every comment is pure gold, do tell :)  Unrelated comments: sometimes they are weird, sometimes they are super random but funny. who cares?  Vote manipulation: this is a major flaw. not trying to defend this practice, but since those bot posts seem to always start with 300 points on the trending page, ive spent a whole day on the fresh page recently. i would say the overall content quality is lower, but no ""hot on internet"" and people are more responsive in the comment section. also you never reach the end, there are so many posts that you can keep scrolling for as long as you like. perfect when you just want need to kill some time (or a whole day lol).  Censorship: While they cleverly blend out your comments when you say things like ""reddit"" or ""hot_on_internet"", you can say anything else you like. That's why I was unaware of censoring, until people started saying things like ""hót on ínternet"" again -.-"" to avoid censoring.  Creepy pickup lines: see misogyny.  Attention whoring: This is present all over the internet. And on 9gag, its usually instantly punished with a ""sausage gif"".  Emma Watson is our queen: 9gag has their running gags, so have other sites. including reddit.  9gag nation: see above.   ""You've been using reddit for quite some time already. Take a closer look and you'll find the differences.""   I have registered a while ago, that doesn't mean that I've been using reddit all that time.  TL:DR; the only real issues i see, are the content stealing and the vote manipulation.  and maybe ""we"" could do something about it, but the suggestions i've seen on this sub reddit so far are about DDOS'ing and spamming scat porn. (facepalm) how about instead, letting everyone know the truth? i've found my way here through a post about the repost machine, which had a shortened url in the picture, on the fresh page. they cant scan pictures for the things they dont want people to know."
9gag,370wby,derkevevin,1 point,Wed May 27 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"This is perfect. I agree that the only issues I can find is the content stealing. But again to that I say ""who cares?""    The rest of the arguments against 9gag are all a matter of opinion and often times hypocritical seeing as the things people hate about 9gag are the exact same thing they love reddit for."
9gag,370wby,Jowsten,2,Sat Jun 6 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"YES, i wish someone would actually read the post from the link --> https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1xoy7x/why_is_9gag_hated_so_much_around_the_internet/ where the hypocrisy is explained... also, we NEVER ASKED 9GAG to steal content from other sites and censor comments and shit. we would be perfectly happy without it. they are annoying everyone with their ""HOT ON INTERNET"". recently there were just so many HOT ON INTERNET posts, that they completely removed OP names all together. looks like too many people were starting to get aware of what 9gag does. now the only way to know that a post is made by an actual user is, if they comment on the post -it will show OP on their names."
9gag,370wby,derkevevin,0,Sun Jun 7 14:22:07 2015 UTC,"Since you've replied to every item in my list, I feel it's only fair that I do the same with the ones we disagree on:  Userbase: 9gag's userbase is notably younger than reddit's, and this reflects on every other characteristic of the website I will go into.   Fanboys: Just think about any Goku post. No, it didn't teach you to never give up, it didn't teach you anything actually.   Unfunny comments: I've never laughed at 9gag's comments, while I do it all the time when browsing reddit. However, this is probably a subjective matter.   Unrelated comments: They are annoying, unoriginal and derail the discussion.   Emma Watson: This ""meme"" is a very curious thing. It is a variation of the Chuck Norris meme. Why is she so special she deserves such a high amount of praise? Same with Leonardo DiCaprio.   9gag nation: There is a seriously annoying nationalist undertone on this one. By creating this ""nation"" they attempt to claim other memes as theirs and create a false image of grandeur."
9gag,370wby,ImNicolasCage,0,Wed May 27 15:48:57 2015 UTC,"maybe you call it adult, i call it fedora tipping elitist assholes who spit out their food when they find out it has 9gag in it, and wash their mouth twice afterwards. to sum up the rest:   ""you must be fun at parties."" talking about fanboys, pretty much everyone here is dick riding reddit so hard, as if they were getting paid for it >_> about 9gag nation, reddit and other sites are doing similar things like ""reddit army :D"" and maybe its just me, but neither of those make my fucking blood boil.   edit: +did anyone even actually read the post from the link i provided?"
9gag,370wby,derkevevin,0,Fri May 29 05:58:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know, you also seem to be ""dick riding"" a website, so at least we have something in common! The only difference here is their quality!   And while the ""reddit army"" thing is satire, the ""9gag nation"" is propaganda.   This discussion is not going anywhere and is getting quite boring, so I won't reply anymore."

9gag,36v7zv,bradleygoddard,4,Fri May 22 12:53:29 2015 UTC,just shows how sad that place is.
9gag,36v7zv,bradleygoddard,-4,Fri May 22 14:39:19 2015 UTC,I kind of wonder which place is sadder. 5 people getting mad at a post that has 11'000 upvotes or a place that has 11'000 people enjoying a post
9gag,36v7zv,bradleygoddard,2,Fri May 22 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"very valid point but you assume that the sole reason I think that place is sad is because of an idiotic post that managed to gather 11,000 upvotes, which I truly think it's more due to random stuff, like posts getting automatic upvotes and people upvoting random stuff just for the sake of it, especially after it gets to trending.  I'm more concerned with 9GAG claiming ownership on intellectual property it and it's users do not own. I'm also concerned with how only mentioning competitors in comments on 9GAG will render you comments invisible to others, without giving you any notice and fooling users into thinking that they're comments are still featured.  There is more to it than what a simple glance over a comment I left might lead you to believe. I have mentioned only a couple of them above."

They are stepping up their ante and are deliberately stealing without worrying about covering their tracks. Seriously. They just took a fucking screenshot and the user that uploaded it was their repost machine.  This has to stop. The internet will become a clusterfuck of reposts and unoriginal content at this rate. They need a new DDoS attack and someone to tell the 9fags HOW the content they upvote gets there, but since they are stupid, they won't care. The only reason the 2011 attack didn't gather enough fuel was because the 9fags felt attacked by outsiders and might have interpreted it like they were victims. The only person to blame is the 9gag owners that allow this shit to happen."

9gag,359veh,Kishq,3,Fri May 8 10:01:25 2015 UTC,9gag deliberately stole this. They took their precautions and are actively moderating that post to look out for those type of comments. I know because I've seen it happen to me doing the same thing.

9gag,3567he,willgeld,4,Thu May 7 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"That kind of attitude is why people leave 9gag in the first place, because its users are the self anointed kings of the internet and they feel they are superior.

Since 9gag steals most of its content, the only way to trip them up is to either a) stop posting content site wide (not going to happen) or b) promote a day where every subreddit that they steal from (r/funny, r/wtf, etc.) continuously posts variations of ""9gag is terrible"" image posts.

And then I visited the same post from a browser I never used to login on 9gag. My comment was nowhere to be seen.   Went back on my logged in page and it was there visible at the top.

9gag,33spmz,KeisariFLANAGAN,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of bone heads there, but remember that r/jailbait and r/fatpeoplehate were things, so reddit as an unsegregated aggregate is certainly not innocent in that regard. 9gag, which I used at school since reddit was blocked, is a place where I've taught many people with poor english lessons that they missed in school - and gotten lots of thanks, far out numbering the ""you must be fun at parties"" cliché there - and even reached out to one (really cute) gay guy there to give advice/optimism, things that, sure enough, are equally prevalent on subs like r/gay."
9gag,33spmz,Jowsten,-2,Sat Jun 13 11:02:40 2015 UTC,"Reddit isn't much different. The comments here fit the kinds you just outlined. Reddit is just a bit more in depth and allows a less shallow conversation to happen between users. But it's just as ""shitty"" by those standards."
9gag,33spmz,TheDarkOnche,3,Tue Apr 28 11:27:07 2015 UTC,"Then I assume we go to different boards...  Of course, everything in 9gag isn't bad, and I hate the idea of making fun of 9gag just because it's a common opinion here. It's way more easy to ""surf"" than reddit, and it is a bit more organized and clear than imgur. And there are still original creators and nice users.   But I don't see all the kind of comments you can read when you browse 9gag.  First because reddit is not about funny images or text, but about everything. You can find a subreddit for almost everything, and you can discuss about every subject here.  And even if you go in subreddit that can be asssimilated to 9gag, where you can find memes or funny images, and of couse imgur, you don't find the same things.  People are still, for the majority, seeking for the front page or for the most ""liked"" comment, but on 9gag you're reading way more shit than here. I just can't find examples, because I just can't even see one similarity. As a said, you can, under almost every post, a comment about feminism, or racism, films, videogames and memes, with the same consensual opinion...   I don't want to try to convince you, do whatever you want, I'm just saying that 9 gag is really annoying because it's full of people who can't go (for multiple reasons, because they don't like them, don't want to spend a lot of time on them or never heard of them) on websites such as Reddit/4chan or whatever, close from ""nerd"" ""culture"" but are still interested in this culture. Most of them, because of multiple reasons, end up on this website and feel comfortable. And it's legitimate : you don't have to search for what you like, it's coming for you. And by the content you see there, you begin to think like the other users, and hate some stuff only because you see a lot of hating images about it. They can meet users who think exactly like them, and have artificial discussion or debate about all sort of things.  I know it's something common on the internet, but again, it's way more present here than in other sites, and you don't have all the other advantages of other sites.  9gag is not about fun, it is about letting you think you are cool and different."

9gag,33spmz,derkevevin,0,Tue May 26 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"for every hate comment, there is usually someone to tell them how stupid they are, with almost the same amount of upvotes. you shouldn't judge the whole userbase for some retarded people's comments. maybe try seeing (and noticing) the good comments as well, by keeping an open mind instead of being biased. with your last sentence you seem to be describing the internet as a whole, not just 9gag. also i dont understand why everyone has to be dead serious about a site that exists for the lulz. some people here are no better than the worst people on 9gag. and a lot of people are biased. but im not judging all of you for that."
9gag,33spmz,TheDarkOnche,2,Wed May 27 12:49:23 2015 UTC,"As I was reading you, I was agreeing with you on several points. I think we are taking this a bit too seriously, and people are free to do what they want, even if I think they are ""damaging"" a culture, that I actually do not ""own"" or ""rule"" (I like quotation marks). I then decided to browse 9gag, just to give it a chance and try to find the good comments that you were talking about. And I found this. Imgur This is the big problem in my opinion.  Because the reposts are an issue, but you can't just say ""it does not belong to 9gag, this comes from Reddit/FunnyJunk/whatever"" It is on the Internet. The watermarks are annoying, but I don't really mind. They make money out of something that could be considered unfair because they are not creating a lot of original content, but that's ok. They're definitely not the only ones.  No, as I said, the big issue to me is the social aspect. As you can see in the comments on the captured post, a very big proportions of 9gag users, or at least a very big proportions of 9gag users I can see, are acting like this. Acting like they're some hardliners, proud representative of an oppressed/dying culture. Acting like they're really cool because they know memes and stuff. It's the kid section of the Internet. Where you got to show off your ""skillz"" your ""knowledge"" about anything a bit nerdy related. It is one of the worse form of communitarianism.  For any guy that come up with a fact/opinion, you will see another guy saying the opposite (as it happens everywhere else) but I really feel this is not really about the opinion/fact, but more about how different you can be from the ""others"" : ""these weird guys who go on parties Saturday's nights and think they're cool but we're cooler..."".   But I never said that this is exclusive to 9gag, of course you can find things like this (and even worse) on other websites. But it does hold a very strong percentage of those people (or at least that's how it feels like).  You now have a part of my explanation about the ""hate"" on 9gag."
9gag,33spmz,derkevevin,1 point,Fri May 29 22:29:38 2015 UTC,"yeah. what bothers me in the comments is the judgmental ones, which pretty much fit what you said about trying to be ""better"" and ""different"" from the others. other bad comments are just ignored by the majority of people, including me. and hate comments usually get downvoted and deleted.  after all i like the 9gag comment section, i go there for comments like these: Imgur not for the bad ones. and i mean there is more important stuff in the world to care about than some idiots, trolls, and assholes, spreading their bullshit on the internet."
9gag,33spmz,TheDarkOnche,1 point,Sun May 31 07:38:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but that's why I browse Reddit and other similar sites. Because you still find tons of interesting/funny comments, but the idiots/trolls/assholes are really under-represented, while on 9gag it's quite the opposite. I can't see enough good comments. And that's it."

I was on 9gag for some good memes but I despised the community with their anime obsession and nerdyness, which can be fine but not to those levels.

If the train from Australia to Nopeville (a town [hence ""-ville""] that's apparently big enough to be a country?) goes entirely over water, then why does it curve? Train tracks don't curve if they're over water. They go straight.

There's an entire area just called ""Gif River."" Let me repeat: An area of LAND, called Gif RIVER. And before you rebut with ""Gif River is the circular thing around that area of land, which is clearly a waterway!"", let me explain you a thing. Rivers flow from mountains to oceans. They flow downhill. So basically you either have one of these scenarios, which are impossible, or you have a stagnant body of water, which for some reason has developed in a loop around this random, unnamed island in the center of a continent.

Many have the exact titles from originals, horrible typos included. It's like if they automated a fraction of the process, watching specific sections of specific sites. And the posting system is definitively automated.  It has a queue. It always waits for a legit user post or two before generating another fake post. They don't pop up on Hot Page, they come to life in Trending, actually, with 300 instant upvotes and 0 comments. When something makes it to Hot Page it seems to be by users votes, if you pay attention not half of the automatic posts they do manage to make it out of Trending because people don't like them too much and they hate Hot on Internet. Some users ignore these, others purposely downvote them."

9gag,333y04,ImNicolasCage,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:32:10 2015 UTC,"First you need to know which subreddit is the best place to post something. For funny images, try /r/funny. Then, click on ""submit a link"" on the top-right of the page and choose the title and link (an image, for example)."
9gag,330f9s,EEDDDWWWAARRRD,24,Sat Apr 18 07:47:54 2015 UTC,"9gag is 9gag. It says right there that it is ""Just for fun""  it literally just serves the purpose to deliver, handpicked, funny image-based jokes/humor. The content is funny, no doubt about it at all. The layout is much better than reddit ever will be. It is really convenient. I mean if you have 5 minutes to waste, then you can do it super efficiently on 9gag. On reddit you can max go through 5 links.   However a major thing is the people. The people of 9gag have I think slowly just migrated to reddit or they used both sites and now don't care about 9gag. The comments are really stupid and lame. There is absolutely no sense of humor with the people. The advice animals and captain thing is become so very lame. Basically it has become very very very popular and mainstream which I feel has contributed to its loss in quality.   Reddit on the other hand is a piece of beauty with one major flaw (relative to 9gag). People don't come for fun here. They come for everything. There everything for everybody. You want gaming, you got it. You want DIY, you got it. You want funny/advice animals and you got that. It's configurable. You can have stuff as you like. You spend your free time learning. On 9gag it's just funny stuff. On reddit the flaw is of course the design and inherent slow paced usage. On 9gag all you need is the scroll wheel.   However the people of reddit are very nice. They are calm and composed and are always willing to help. They have great remarks which are funny and entertaining. It just feels like a family."
9gag,330f9s,kvenaik696969,8,Sat Apr 18 21:55:41 2015 UTC,Perfect explanation of the difference between 9gag and reddit.
9gag,330f9s,Jowsten,3,Sun Apr 19 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks brother !   Most people trash 9gag a lot when they compare it to reddit. However they fail to take into account the fact that they are apples and oranges. Sure, most of the content is stolen/reposted (if not all of it), but one needs to realize that there is very little OC overall on the internet.  However, if you have been following 9gag for the past few months, one would clearly see that there is more OC now than there was previously. It might be cringey material and might be stupid, silly stuff like Rage Comics or Advice Animals, but atleast its going back to its roots ! (which is great)"
9gag,330f9s,kvenaik696969,3,Sun Apr 19 18:26:55 2015 UTC,Exactly. I make that argument all the time. Anything posted on the Internet belongs to the Internet. It doesn't matter where it came from. And It doesn't matter where it gets shared.  I use 9 gag when I want to laugh or find shareable memes or whatever. I use reddit for information and a but more interactive entertainment. They both have their uses. Like you said.. apples and oranges.   I have seen a decent amount of original content. Only every now and then do I see something I've seen elsewhere like reddit. Which doesn't bother me in the slightest. And I don't mind the cringey material. I don't think it's a majority of the content.
9gag,330f9s,Jowsten,4,Sun Apr 19 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"If anything posted on the internet belongs to the internet, why does 9gag watermark the pictures it steals?"
9gag,330f9s,ImNicolasCage,5,Sun Apr 19 20:39:58 2015 UTC,"That I agree, is a very douchey/shady as fuck move. Not cool."
9gag,330f9s,kvenaik696969,0,Sun Apr 19 21:02:16 2015 UTC,To make them feel better about themselves?  Hell if I know. I don't really care. All that matters is 9gag is a good site to use for what I use it for. And I'll defend my opinion on it. Nothing more.
9gag,330f9s,Jowsten,-1,Mon Apr 20 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"No, it's not to ""make them feel better about themselves"". They don't add the watermark on purpose, it's added by default. Have you read this post? They do it to generate more income:  First, 9gag steals an image and adds the watermark, then someone steals it from them, this time with the watermark, and now everyone who sees the image will go to 9gag seeking more of them, thus generating ad revenue.  The amount of OC on 9gag is extremely low. I would go as to say that 95% of it is reposted from other websites. The comment section makes me sick.  It's a horrible website with a horrible community. There is no way to defend it.  I'm sorry, but if you are here to act as a 9gag knight, you are in the wrong place."
9gag,330f9s,ImNicolasCage,3,Mon Apr 20 01:16:50 2015 UTC,"My actual answer was ""hell if I know""    And I completely believe your answer because I'm sure you've done all the researching and blah blah blah...  And finally, as I said, I simply defend my opinion on it. I'm not defending the site itself or how the people on it conduct themselves. And am in no means being a ""knight"" for anything."
9gag,330f9s,Jowsten,16,Mon Apr 20 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"I knew about reddit for quite some time, but the fact that I had to click on each post to see the image put me off.  However, for the past 2-3 years, I noticed an influx of posts that bashed on modern music, fashion and even smartphones for some reason. Then came the ""Hey this is my puppy. upvote plz"" posts. They were annoying, since the website was made for jokes.   Then there were the comments. The SJW's, the neckbeards, the ""hey guys add me on kik to see my boobs!"", the people who asked for a captain to explain something that could easily be googled, etc. I was quite a popular commenter, where I'd usually get anything between 20-1000 upvotes. Yet strangely enough, none of my posts that referenced websites such as reddit or 4chan got upvoted. I let it slide, thinking that it's just an anti-reddit circlejerk, but I eventually got fed up and decided to make a second account. To my surprise, none of these said comments were visible. That's where I drew the line. Now I can be a karma whore in piece.  Also the fact that they called polandballs ""countryballs"". That grew old real quick."

9gag,330f9s,redraenhys,5,Sun Apr 19 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"I'd been a hardcore 9GAG user til last year. I only browsed it at night before going to sleep. It was all good until I started observing a few things:    The front page was rarely updated. Maybe about 10 new posts PER DAY. I frequently went to the new and rising pages just to see something fresh. Most posts were about opinions about the US, Putin and bashing pretty much every other thing that made the news. The comments were HORRIBLE. The community felt creepy sometimes.  I felt shameful for browsing 9GAG, even though I was a mere lurker.   So, about this around last year, I installed Reddit is Fun and decided to give the front page of the internet a try. And boy was I glad. During the transition, I mainly browsed /r/f7u12 and /r/AdviceAnimals (what else do you expect from a 9GAGGER?), but I've since unsubscribed from them. My favorite subreddit is /r/AskReddit, which is way more interesting and funnier than all of 9GAG combined. I also have subscribed to other subreddits of my interest, such as /r/web_design.  Now every time I open Reddit, I have something new waiting for me on the front page. Heck, I sometimes feel a bit of Fear Of Missing Out!  And the best part of Reddit is the community. (Mostly) sane, mature, genuinely funny people; not twelve year olds.  I regret not being a part of Reddit earlier. But better late than never, I guess? Most of my Facebook friends are still 9GAG obsessed, but I hope they will grow up someday. ;)  I also made this post making fun of 9GAG and posted it to 9GAG. They thought it was real!  TL; DR Switched to Reddit a year ago because of 9GAG's awful community and posts. Regret not doing it earlier."
9gag,330f9s,not_a_real_penguin,2,Sat Apr 18 12:37:12 2015 UTC,"Every time I check 9gag's comments I feel extremely annoyed. Creepy pick up lines, unrelated comments, obnoxious gifs that have nothing to do with the post itself. Simply awful.  The community doesn't feel creepy, it IS creepy."

9gag,330f9s,redraenhys,6,Sun Apr 19 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I got introduced to 9gag by a friend and i would just browse it every night, then one day i saw a post on 9gag about crazy things kids say to their parents, then i looked at the comments and someone had linked to a reddit post about that(i think it was on r AskReddit)  then i got an account on reddit,  this one.  And every night i would browse 9gag and see something from from r/funny and i would be like what the fuck this was posted on reddit like a day ago, then 1 day i got tired off it.  I said to myself if i see one more post from reddit im fucking deleting everything that involves 9gag, and guess what after a few scrolls and there it was.  I deleted the app immediately.  TL:DR :  was addicted to 9gag copy machine saw reddit posts,  trashed the copy machine."

9gag,330f9s,LinkDemobilizerBot,2,Sat Apr 18 09:13:09 2015 UTC,"Reddit scared me at first. Not because of the content or it's community, but because of the first look I gave it's frontpage. It's just too complicated, and asks too much work to be done if you just want to waste a couple of minutes looking funny images. So even though I've heard of it, I never actually spent more than 30 seconds on it until recently, so I was a 9gag regular.  Even if I spent tons of time on that time waster, the most propable reason was that it was so easy, it actually became a habit. A part of muscle memory just having a tab open, scroll for 10 second and go back to whatever you were doing. The hive-mind community was the reason I was starting to lose faith on the entire ordeal and was using 9gag like a packet of cigarettes. Just for the habit.  And then, something happened. Something so horrible, anethical and  inhumane that I snapped out of it quite violently. 9gag censored me in the worst way a ""social"" website can censor someone. By muting me without my knowledge.  The story was that I saw a post, that I saw on reddit one day ago. No big deal, but I felt like pointing it out. ""Hey, I already saw this on reddit!"" I said. And then silence. I was already getting suspicious on the ordeal that I did an experiment. Made some more comments like ""R e d d i t  did this first"", ""Bots don't even get subtle now"". I could see those comments when I was logged in. I could not when I wasn't. And of course other test comments I made that just saying things like ""banana for scale"" were visible normally. Even though it was just a website with stupid content, I felt horrible when I realised it.  And that was the moment I left this horrid place, and spent some more time on the quirky layout of reddit. And it's worth it. Hello everyone!"
9gag,330f9s,Loupax,3,Wed Apr 29 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"I discovered 9Gag via some friends who were on it sometimes. I started out as an occasional scroller, but over time I started going on it multiple times every day. Once, there was this horror story on 9gag, and I googled it because I found it intriguing, and somehow found /r/nosleep. After this I kept scrolling trough 9Gag on a daily basis, and occasionally read the nosleep stories. Just a few months ago I began noticing that there were a lot of posts with 300 upvotes with no comments coming from nowhere. A comment told me that it was probably a bot, and I was like: ""Cool! I need that bot so I can get a lot of upvotes too!"" I googled the bot and so found this subreddit and read the shit out of it. Since that day I started coming more and more to Reddit, and noticed that about 50%, if not more, of the posts on 9Gag were the same as those on Reddit. Since then I havent visited the site anymore, and am trying to convert my stubborn 9Gag-friends to this magical place."
9gag,330f9s,Barnacle_Stinson1,2,Sat Apr 18 11:12:00 2015 UTC,"I've found it pretty hard to convince people to stop using 9gag. It's the layout of the website: easy to use, hard to stop."
9gag,330f9s,ImNicolasCage,3,Sat Apr 18 15:41:32 2015 UTC,It's that! All my friends prefer 9Gag because they think Reddit is too chaotic and not as easy to scroll trough.
9gag,330f9s,Barnacle_Stinson1,2,Sat Apr 18 16:24:20 2015 UTC,Chaotic?  Nah. But definitely more obnoxious to browse. 9gag is just more simple and appealing.
9gag,330f9s,Jowsten,3,Sun Apr 19 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"In grade 7 9gag was the shit. Idek if they were good or I was like 12 but whatever. All of a sudden I stopped checking it just because I wanted to play video games or whatever. Then in grade 8 my friend showed me to /r/fiftyfifty . Being the sick fuck I was I was very into reddit. I started checking out more subreddits and eventually started checking it every night. It's almost been my first year, reddit! I love you <3"
9gag,330f9s,The_Nicktator,4,Sat Apr 18 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late to the party, but I need to kinda rant about this.  9gag put me off because of how ridiculously annoying it became. When first I joined, 9gag seemed awesome. An almost ever-lasting scrolling data base where I had seen maybe 1 out of every 30 posts before. It was amazing, and practically unlimited in that sense.  As I went through the motions (created an account, started commenting, etc) I started noticing things that really started getting to me. I mean, I had been on there for a year, so I had started noticing reposts every now and then. Yeah, that's fine - If it's good quality content, then it's completely fine to repost it for the benefit of others. I know reposts are going to be common on whatever internet site you go on. Long-time redditors have probably seen it all to be honest. But I was scrolling the fresh page, because I had exhausted the trending page, and I discovered not one repost, not two, but three of the exact same image in a row.  That was the beginning of the end for me. I started looking in the comments, and instead of meaningful comments on the posts, the top comment on nearly all the popular posts would be... pathetic. It would be people commenting for attention. I know that's what reddit is essentially built on, but it was different on 9gag. People had display pictures, and once I saw a girl post a comment that said ""hey guys, what do you think of my new haircut?"" with thousands of upvotes along with hundreds of comments. All I could think was... What the actual fuck?  That was the final straw. I had heard of reddit before through that annoying friend everyone has who overly preaches stuff about the internet, so I thought I'd give it a go, and thank god I did.  I went to revisit 9gag a couple months back. I left in an angry storm. Do you remember the whole Jenny and Zach thing? I saw a post taken from the front page of Reddit referencing the whole Jenny and Zach thing! IT WASN'T EVEN ON 9GAG BUT THAT POST MADE IT TO THE HOME PAGE."
9gag,330f9s,buffalog,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the Jenny and Zach repost! A classic 9gag fail..."
9gag,330f9s,ImNicolasCage,2,Sun Apr 19 15:33:37 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is why the mods allowed that to go through. I mean, I know 9gag is basically a regurgitation of Reddit, but it was completely and utterly unrelated to 9gag. It was relevant only to reddit. Some people on reddit don't even understand the references!   Another classic 9gag fail was a picture of the reddit mailbox icon highlighted red to indicate an unread message. The tag line was ""How you know you've pissed someone off."" It made it all the way to the trending page, thousands of upvotes, and the comment section was literally filled with people saying ""What website is that from?"" People were upvoting it without knowing what it was."
9gag,330f9s,buffalog,2,Sun Apr 19 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"I believe there is some sort of algorithm that defines how many upvotes something gets. So people were not upvoting it, just commenting, and the votes were added according to the number of comments/views.  But I don't understand how it happened as well..."
9gag,330f9s,ImNicolasCage,2,Sun Apr 19 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"I remember when 9gag was ""Just for fun"" 4 to 5 years ago. At that time I didn't care much about the site reposting from other sites, I just wanted to see funny things. Over the years, the content and the community changed. While the funny things began to disappear and every 5th post was a repost, the community began to change more and more to the bad side. I noticed this, but never wanted to realise. I mean, it was just like a year long friend, with who (or whom?) you did hang around and have fun, why should it change? You know what I mean?  However, in the last year I started to wake up what 9gag really was and what it had become. ""Just for fun""  had turned into ""Just for money and attention"", and the once more or less funny community had turnt into twelve to seventeen years old people with certain characteristics.  When I look on the fresh page of 9gag today, then I see that half of the posts are either political, social or consist of animal and cake pictures to seek attention and upvotes. The other half consists of reposts I have seen like 1000 times on 9gag itself, which were clearly reposts from other sites. Sometimes there were (and maybe still are) reposts of the same repost 3 times a day.  Now to clarify the ""certain characteristics"" of the community I wrote earlier, I need to make a list:   There's always someone who knows it better.  It doesn't matter which topic, it could be 9/11, economy, biology or even quantum physics: it seemed like every user had at least a degree in rocket science, chemistry, physics, psychology and law. I truly have never read so much bullshit (challenge me!) like in the comment section.  Reason and sense are something you search and never find.  I don't know how you call it in english, but in my language you would call them populists and (I'm sorry for the words) god damn assholes. If you would let them run a country, everybody would be executed for basically everything they don't like. It doesn't matter what topic, they refuse to think further as 3 meters (can you say this like that?) and they lack of anything I would call in German ""Verhältnismässigkeit"". Which leads me to the next point.  They just hate everything that doesn't line up with their expetations and thoughts on life and existence. You have another opinion as someone on 9gag? Well it must be wrong. You have scientifical facts, theories or logical arguments and ""thought line""? They will be succsessfully ignored and labeled as wrong or as a simple opinion (which a fact is clearly not). You can prove someone's opinion wrong? ""You are an idiot for not respecting my opinion"".  They are racist. It starts with the thought of superiority of all other people outside of 9gag. If you're not a 9 gagger, you're automatically worthless. They lack of respect and understanding of other people. They label things as ""black"", ""white"" or ""mexican"", believe in the superiority of nations, think heritage is something to be excessively proud of and makes gives you superiority over others (while you clearly didn't contribute anything to everything;but that's just my opinion). They even believe that there are races in the sense of social darwinism and the race theory.    Conclusion: the community consists of mainly twelve to seventeen years old ignorant, populist, selfcentred, hateful racists with questionable views on the world and certain topics. If I ever truly lost faith in humanity, then it was in the comment section of 9gag.  I searched the last year for another place on the internet, wich was more fun, where I could choose what content I could access, where I could choose which community I want to follow and where I could even talk to other people with other opinions without hate, without grudge or unreasonable behavior. And then I (re)found reddit. I knew somewhat what reddit was, but I realised it just two months ago, it was everything I was looking for. I use reddit for fun,  Magic: The Gathering card alteration pics, news and everything I want to discover.   TL;DR: 9gag community destroyed 9gag,was the reason I came to reddit.  EDIT: grammar, spelling."
9gag,330f9s,tenthousand_eyes,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:41:08 2015 UTC,"started 9gag sometime in my high school, i think sophomore year (im a sophomore in college now, so that was 4 years ago). basically it was like a few months before 9gag started getting bad. first few months it was hilarious as fuck. then, the shit. i remember some of the memes that came and went that i liked, i remember the first 'If you know what I mean' Mr. Bean post that made it to trending... ah the memories...  then came the bad ones. The lipton Tea, the confession bear, overusage of success kid, awkward penguin turned into awkward seal, and all that fucked up shit that came. I knew i hated it, but i didnt know of anywhere else to go. my friend used reddit, but i didnt understand the links, the threads, when really i just wasnt ready to change...  and then, one day in late september/early october of 2014. i saw one of those trending topics on facebook (i just use it to remember birthdays and for the trending topic thing, which is actually not a bad tool from zuckerberg) Naruto. i wonder, y the fuck is naruto a trending topic? and i see, the 5 weeks left on the manga... i almost cried. i did all the research i could, and it was true: naruto the manga was finally ending. couldnt believe it. Apparently the naruto sub was basically going berserk, and since none of my college friends read naruto, i needed to find an outlet to vent my 7ish year commitment to reading Naruto ending, so i finally gave Reddit a try.  And now here i am today. I still use r/naruto, but mainly Reddit has become my number one area for sports, r/nba, r/soccer, r/baseball, it really has helped me keep track of things, since im studying to be a sports broadcaster/analyst. Television shows like House of Cards and GoT, web series like Red vs Blue, those subs are all great. Even video game subs like r/FIFA and r/FIFAcareers. I am a full supporter of reddit now, spend probably a couple hours a day on it.   and yet still... i use 9gag. only on mobile. its easy, its stupid, its terrible. ill give an upvote like once or twice in the day. i hate it, but its app is very simple. for those of you wondering how it is now, rage comics are making a small comeback out of nowhere, like the past week. they arent great, and im sure that most are reposts, but its nice to see some thing different from the overusage of success kid (idc about your weight loss really, this is for FUNNY SHIT), confession bear, and what was once my favorite meme but now a shadow of itself, insanity wolf (now its just clever comeback wolf)"
9gag,330f9s,kman273,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"My ex is very into reddit, and he once said that I should read people's stories here. I wasn't that into the idea, as I thought that browsing funny posts on 9gag was entertaining enough to me. A week or so after he broke up with me, I felt a need to tap into a community where people share real life stories and came to visit Reddit more often. The fact that there're so many facets of life here on Reddit makes it a better place to keep my mind busy and offer perspectives regarding my place in the world. I still can't quite laugh at the jokes I see on 9gag yet, but I am getting ready to return."

9gag,330f9s,Kowinfeyo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:50:32 2015 UTC,"Why i'm disturbed by 9gag; 1. Most of the stuff is a huge repost, not credited to its original creators. 2. Most posts on the two ''big'' pages are there because the admins chose to, not the users. 3. Bots (including pretty girls, of course) everywhere. 4. False facts, that are quite usually promoted to the ''hot'' and ''trending''. 5. The teenage boy misery that is usually found on posts and comments (''no one loves me'', ''women love only money'' etc.) 6. The absence of rage comics and original funny memes (even the stolen ones, are not funny at all). 7. Misogynistic. 8. Annoying posts about (american mostly) celebrities and their shit. 9. Certain chain (or single) posts that included a.Ukrainian fascists (as the good people), b.nazi ''relics'' photos  that their poster's ancestors left them and the posters found in their houses (and they were sounding quite happy about the fact). c. posts with, at least, conservative political and social darvinistic views (''if you are poor you shouldn't have kids'', Che Guevara was a scum'' etc.) 10. Melodramatic written stories, with quality that makes the spam mails look like a Shakespearean play. (''try not too cry'') Stolen of course and with a conservative theme, usually."
9gag,330f9s,LunatikC,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:03:13 2015 UTC,"I was on 9gag for about 2/3 of a year before I began to notice it's major problems.  Firstly the repost machine is fucking ridiculous and as a result the hot page is shit.  Second the North Korean levels of censorship. I mean you mention reddit and your comment is hidden wtf!?   Then their was the quality of the posts on 9gag. 9gag is meant to be a gag site and be nonstop funny, but the amount of emo posts and posts by 40 year old virgins and anime obsessed twats was ridiculous. I don't even need to mention the terrible posts that were meant to be funny because everyone knows about that. Last thing I'll mention was the fucking people. Most people think it's just a bunch of autistic teenagers, which honestly would be better than what it really is. Imagine all the internets rejects, retards, socially awkward loners and emos concentrated into one toxic community. Granted there were a few decent people but they'll sonn leave 9gag when they realise what it truly is. In all honesty these ""9gaggers"" are the main problem with 9gag. They repost, they post unfunny shit and they proudly display their severe autism in the comments.  I don't regret leaving 9gag at all and I'm glad my last post there was a metaphorical ""fuck you"" to their ""community"". I could post more reasons but this is long enough as it is and you don't need any more reasons to abandon the cesspool of the internet."
9gag,330f9s,Runcibubble,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:02:41 2015 UTC,"I still use 9gag regularly and use reddit on a weekly basis. It's only been recently that I've started to notice the censorship and other fishy behavior like seeing reposts from the reddit front page. I honestly just go to see the comments as there is far more humor to be found there than the actual posts themselves. Cuz... you know... people actually TRY to be original.  I'm wondering if we can organize an en mass posting that tries to get people aware of the flaws in 9gag. I know that the nuking attempt a year or two ago failed but it's still an option. Either that or I should just take up a crusade to inform the comment section.  Also, 4chan is a garbage can. True, they make some legendary memes occasionally but the very design of the site encourages shitposting over discussion. But I digress..."
9gag,330f9s,NimbleBrain,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:30:28 2015 UTC,"They crush any attempt to warn people. I can provide you more or less the time the posts moderator is active and details about their behaviour, but quite frankly, it won't work unless you manage to get a post to Trending. It usually takes a day or so to gather 300 upvotes, and such warnings last ~12 hours at best. Even on weekends."
9gag,330f9s,redraenhys,0,Sun Apr 19 16:47:17 2015 UTC,"I was introduced by my sister. I enjoyed scrolling, maybe just five minutes. It turned into hours and hours, but at some point it became boring. Then, I saw a post about cats. I looked at the comments and everybody was complaining and talking about reddit. When I got there, the first thing I found was TIL, so everytime they reposted something from here, it was quick to notice. When I noticed, some posts with instant 300 started appearing. That's when I moved here."
9gag,3314o5,Kullthebarbarian,2,Sat Apr 18 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I see this as an advertisement deal between the original creator and 9gag. There is no other logical reason for them to suddenly have a source on a post, when they slam a watermark on just about anything else."

9gag,3314o5,kingphysics,2,Sun Apr 19 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, they didn't suddenly found their ethics. Aren't you aware of the heavy censorship they're imposing on the comments of their users right now? It's despicable, because they're putting a lot of effort to fool their users into thinking their comments were really posted.  When a comment contains a blacklisted word it'll become invisible to everyone but you. It's easy to check, post a comment, wait ~30sec to make sure the comments were updated and check while logged out. You can use incognito mode for that (or whatever browser counterpart you use).  Some banned expressions are directly linked to the affair, so that makes sense: ""Hot on Internet"", ""bot"", but others... others not: ""potato"", ""official"", ""generic"". You can't even mention their own site name in certain contexts!"

9gag,32yv6m,ImNicolasCage,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I made the bot compare the title as well. Threads where more than 80% are the same will be notified. Interestingly though, it didn't find any such threads (yet). Also, these are not ALL the posts re-posted from Reddit. Like I said earlier, in order for my bot to find reposts, the Reddit posts would need to have been indexed by Google before being posted on 9gag. I'm going to make my own image reverse service later in order to get more accurate statistics based on the findings from how I've made my bot so far."

Praise Leonardo DiCaprio and Emma Watson (""Emma is our queen"")  . Hate on the US (""stupid amerifats"")  . Think they are superior (here)  . It's very common to find people saying how religion is terrible  And the list goes on.

What makes me even more mad is if they go to some askreddit-threads, pick up the top answers, and copy them 1:1 into a picture  .   Reminds me of a story: I once have read a joke on a german site which is quite similar to 9gag, just german. because i found it funny, i translated it and submitted it to r/jokes.

9gag,32huin,KrishaCZ,2,Tue Apr 14 18:52:10 2015 UTC,See that is even crazier to me because that took extra effort to steal. They would have had to put all of the images together in one image since you can't post an album on 9gag. Freaking ridiculous!

Also people are karmawhoring like champions on those especially fucking pun threads... Smaller subs are small communities that are really good tho.  The voting system sometimes forces actual realistic and honest comments on the bottom, so it's not a democratic site because people vote on opinion.   4chan because that place is just a big scary question mark to me   Hehe, 4chan is not just /b/ you know. It has decent boards with strict mods. If you are ""afraid"" of 4chan, just avoid the crazy monkeyhouse called /b/ and some other boards like /v/, /mu/, /r9k/, there are strictly SFW boards there.

9gag,32huin,ImNicolasCage,2,Wed Apr 15 06:01:27 2015 UTC,Right. In the same way the only requirement to be in your late 20's is to be in the older ages of your 20's. Haha
9gag,32huin,briseymo1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:38:10 2015 UTC,"Adolescence isn't a well defined concept. It varies from person to person, but it's usually used to define people between 12 and 19 years old (it depends on the age of onset of puberty).  Twelve doesn't end with ""teen"", though.  Anyway, it doesn't really matter. Most 9gaggers are probably under 10 years old!"

9gag,30lu5d,Joe_Henry,-1,Sat Mar 28 18:49:30 2015 UTC,How is it okay to commit suicide?
9gag,30lu5d,Jowsten,5,Sat Mar 28 22:17:02 2015 UTC,Because your life belongs to you. You can do with it as you wish provided you don't cause harm to others or society with it.  Taking other people's lives is not ok Because you robbed them of their right to be alive.
9gag,30lu5d,BALACLAVAK,2,Sun Mar 29 01:29:04 2015 UTC,What about the grieving friends and family you leave behind?
9gag,30lu5d,Jowsten,2,Wed Apr 8 02:29:39 2015 UTC,Suicide is a selfish act. That's part of it. But the way I see it is that it's more selfish to expect someone to live when they don't want to. No one has any obligation to me to live. Who am I to demand that they do?  I think the most important right that we have is the right to choose what we do with our life in society. And that includes choosing to opt out for good. I'm not going to demand someone live just because I don't want to deal with pain. I'm not going to expect someone else to suffer just so I don't have to.  A little context here: I've formed this opinion after years of dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. I've lost a fair few to suicide. So it's something I'm familiar with.
9gag,30lu5d,BALACLAVAK,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:48:09 2015 UTC,"I do like your point. I guess you can look at it as if the selfishness factor of the person outweighs the selfishness factor of their family. But in some situations it's still fairly unacceptable, like if the person is responsible for others, like a parent. But that's probably a relatively small minority of suicides. However, I do have a little less right to talk about this as I've had much less firsthand experience with suicides than you have."
9gag,30lu5d,Jowsten,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:25:36 2015 UTC,"Well like I said at first suicide is selfish as well. It really is a lesser of two wrongs depending how you look at it. I'm not necessarily trying to excuse the consequences of the action. It's not like you can shrug off suicide and just go ""well if it's what he/she wanted."" So in a situation like a parent leaving a child behind with no one to care for it then I'd say you're correct in saying that's the more selfish act. But a lot of times people don't have a child or they don't have much really at all. Just a few family members and an honest lack of desire to exist. Those are the cases where I think it's more wrong for everyone to demand that the person live than it is for that person to opt not to. It's a touchy subject and obviously a fine line which is why we draw it at the point where no suicide is ok. I just think a little bit beyond that is all."

It rarely happens but it happened to me once:  Here's a 9gag-post I did a few months ago which was pretty popular ( http://i.imgur.com/DlKKbaR.jpg ) (I found the top pictures on the Internet and made the photoshopped one at the bottom) Now, a few days later, I found the same post here on Reddit ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2pax85/animal_cookies_in_their_natural_habitat/ )  You can clearly see which one is the stolen one since the 9gag-watermark was simply cropped out."
9gag,2zdfyx,cedriceent,2,Tue Mar 17 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the difference is that on Reddit, a user uploaded your image to /r/funny. It happens once in a blue moon. On 9gag the admins steal posts all the time and makes ad revenue off of it."

This makes it the 'to-go' place for a lot of children.  A really young audience makes any community shitty.  From my experience, they are hypocritical, condeming sites while stealing from said sites.  The memes are Facebook tier memes  If you are a girl in the comment section, people will try to ""seduce"" you.  The voting system sucks balls"

9gag,2w9gqb,GameC9547,17,Wed Feb 18 01:38:28 2015 UTC,"I used to 9gag a lot too.  It was how I found out what memes were, and several years ago the content was genuinely funny, and I would actually laugh audibly.  Then I discovered reddit but I thought that 9gag was ""easier"" to scroll through, quicker, I didn't have to click on links to see stuff, browsing 9gag was less effort than reddit, which suited the lazy ass that I am.  But what I always found frustrating was if there was a post of something really interesting, like maybe a product I wanted to buy, or an artist whose work I'd like to see more of, was that there's no link to the original source in 9gag.  Sometimes it's in the comments, but sometimes it's not.  And it also bugs the piss out of me that every image is watermarked with ""via 9GAG.com"" because it's like, dude, this is not your original content, you totally ripped it from somewhere else.  I like reddit, I like that if I click on a link for an image it takes me to that image's source where that source may not be reddit.  Or a news article, or whatever.  That's what started me spending more time on reddit.  And hen I did spend time on reddit, I'd notice that a couple days later hot stuff would show up while scrolling on 9gag, and that's pretty uncool.  Over the years it has gotten increasingly not funny, where there are just these overused and misused ""inside jokes"" that people tack onto posts for more upvotes.  The other thing that really pisses the shit out of me is the, um, how to put this lightly, or not, literacy level of the 9gag posts that aren't recycled reddit posts.  9gag user OC makes me cringe, the grammar is awful, the spelling is awful, the misuse of ""to"" and ""two"" and ""your"" and ""you're"" just makes the whole lot of them seem really ignorant.  So yeah, fuck 9gag, they suck."
9gag,2w9gqb,nonstop_nosebleed,5,Wed Feb 18 03:33:55 2015 UTC,"Well, there are tools you can use with reddit  redditp.com or www.scrolldit.com for example, /r/funny with redditp: redditp.com/r/funny  There may be more, probably"

9gag,2w9gqb,BALACLAVAK,2,Thu Feb 26 04:14:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same as yours.       Also, I know internet communities are supposed to be somewhat like minded, but jeese 9gaggers were sheep. No wonder 4chan and reddit says they can't think of original content. If the usual topics strayed from bananas, relatively crappy Earthporn, Emma Watson, and glorifying your social anxiety it might be slightly worth reading- 9gaggers even regurgitate stuff from their own website.      And all the teenage ""I can't get a girlfriend and I'm sad"" crap complaining about feminists got ridiculous too."

I had been familiar with some reposting from dorkly and from previous posts but one day it was ridiculous when there was one post that made hot twice. Also nobody cares about spoilers on there. Common decency would give at least a spoiler alert but on 9gag, half of game of thrones was spoilt for me. I did like 9gag a few years ago but I did notice it slowly deteriorating. Now that this sub has shown me how deep the rabbit hole is, I'm never going back."

I'm not even american but for some reason it pissed me off every time I saw something like that.

Only two of them got into trending, and obviously it wasn't because of upvotes or comments. It came pretty clear for me that admins choose what posts get into the trending zone. I was mad, because lot of good posts which reached a really good number of upvotes on fresh section never got to trending and were lost forever, while one of the stupidest posts I made reached the trending zone with just 25 upvotes and 2 days after the upload. Doesn't make any sense. That was the moment I realized there is no democracy on 9gag. So I came to reddit and I found what I been looking for all this time :D"

Thanks to great 9gag community, the people on reddit are just fools...  Lol... the rounded muscles are a sign of exogenous testosterone injections, and this body at THIS age is having at LEAST 1ml of weekly testo injections, which is usually 4 infections (split into 250mg). These veins are a clear sign of Winstrol (stanozolol) which is also injectable anabolic steroid. On top of that, even with such relatively big quantities of steroids, this body needs at least 5 quality meals per day... He may be living on the street, but he certainly does have his sources. - Finishes my little excursion into the world of the enthusiastic 9gag comments. I'm so glad they were so kind and helped that poor man, because foolish imgur community didn't. lol.  Well, I guess just the images are from imgur and the text is from 9gag. What a bullshit.

9gag,2p2c19,EboyMonkey,11,Fri Dec 12 09:04:58 2014 UTC,"My friends showed me 9gag back in 2011,it was a great time. 9gag had funny post (which were stolen from 4chan and reddit cause i researched it) now 9gag is all about hating the United states, feminism, console gamers, more American posts such as health-care, college tuition, gun laws, america. Football and obesity and why Americans are all retards (I'm an American) .  . . I'm so stupid it took me 3 years to realize 9gag slowly became anti American propaganda. My close friend left a year ago because of this , i should have done the same thing.  Now there are more and more Posts about anti American. The 10% of 9gag posts are about Americans 90 % are from reddit and 4 chan. It's ridiculous! . .  They have the nerve to continue bashing America and now their propaganda has made innocent 9gag users think like they do. People from different countries see 9gag posts and automatically judge America from these dumb posts and now they won't want to visit... I mean really.....  .. . The dumbest posts that are becoming popular I've seen is the way they make fun of Americans for not having kinder eggs. I mean really..... A chocolate egg with stupid candy or toys....  . . In conclusion, I'm going to start using reddit as a source of entertainment because seeing the American post really rustle my jimmies.  I get butthurt because it is constant cyber bullying against innocent American citizens .  .... Lasty,  i just want to see fun posts! 9gag has changed to close minded, arrogant, ignorant,  and racist freaks.  I just want a quick hug from you redditors because i really feel like these people attack me constantly. And not just me, also innocent Americans who uses 9gag as well. Many wrote in the comments that they are leaving. I feel for them as well.  So i want to thank whoever is reading this. I wrote this on my phone"
9gag,2p2c19,Sabanoch,5,Fri Dec 12 09:24:02 2014 UTC,"Haha, that's exactly how I joined reddit, lad! Welcome aboard! You'll find it pretty fun in here once ya get used to the interface.  Oh, and don't hesitate to post something every once in a while, so that the website's content varies over time. And if ya put enough effort into it ya might actually reach the frontpage, unlike on 9gag. Also, ya'll see that sharing what you're skillful at or something that passionates you is quite thrilling. Or you can post dickbutt, if ye're into that.  Also, make sure to customise your account with all the various subreddits, heck there's one for every single hobby on earth it's amazing. Now everything ain't all about peace and love here, ya'll find the regular quota of haters as on every website, but usually ya can just ignore and focus on the nice people who seem to be legion here.  Have fun, pal, I hope ya'll feel as welcome here as I felt when I signed up myself!"
9gag,2p2c19,killtheghostthoughts,2,Fri Dec 12 13:00:18 2014 UTC,"I noticed 9gag is hating on almost everything and everyone to the point where it's not funny anymore (not saying hating someone is funny, but playful jokes about stereotypes à la beer-drinking Germans for example are okay in my opinion.)  They hate Americans, they hate Europeans, they hate fat people, they hate skinny people, they hate white people, they hate black people, they hate women, they only love cats and Emma Watson. Oh, and they love their precious 90s and they hate technology and smartphones because they apparently had a better childhood than the children today. (I was born in 90, I really don't understand what makes the 90s better than everything else.)  I left 9gag, too. A great decision. I offer you a high-five or a hug (or both) for solidarity. :)"

But not all. There are still a few posts that are links to some decent 9gag content. Which is what a 9gag subreddit should be for. (Seeing as there are already 9gag hate subreddits) so please. Don't be afraid to post or use this subreddit with positive feelings toward 9gag. You're not alone in doing so.   But as to your post I don't believe I've seen such an image. Sorry to say :/

That's all a female Olympic athlete can lift?"" Why spend so much training female athletes and then holding a competition when there we can find a dozen guys down at the gym who can lift that much right now? Women's sports is to men's sports as the Special Olympics is to the real Olympics. Sure it makes everyone feel good but no one should really take it seriously."

When someone posts OC about their lives, it informs us about their lives and thus forms a genuine link between human beings.  Reposts just create a circlejerk"

Besides, there's no proof! He might be suing reddit for no reason other than him hating us for having all the great memes! If he had a screenshot or something, I could believe it. But even then he'd probably edit it. And, $50,000,000 just for making a site crash (if it was us) is still a bit harsh. Besides, I've been to 9gag and it hardly ever crashes!"
9gag,1g2ike,Melodyheart,2,Thu Jul 11 17:35:36 2013 UTC,Doesn't he also know that the whole internet hates 9gag?  Hell it's probably more likely 4chan doing this.  Redditors are mainly chill (with a few obvious exceptions) and we have a tendancy to frown upon childish behavior like that. We make fun of 9gag BECAUSE it's community will do dumb things like that to reddit.  The 9gag people are usually assholes so it doesn't surprise me at all that the users are doing things like this but just because you made a site full of swag fags doesn't mean you should get upset at others when shit goes down.

9gag,1ebwf2,bompf,2,Wed May 15 08:59:47 2013 UTC,"Also hover zoom, it arguably does more to make reddit more usable. OP mentioned they liked the 9geg let's you see each post as you scrolled down and hover zoom lets you do that with like 1/3 of posts."
9gag,1ebwf2,Mofptown,2,Fri May 31 08:08:58 2013 UTC,I'm poor  :D
9gag,1ebwf2,DGehrke2015,10,Tue May 14 22:39:44 2013 UTC,It's free! Just an extension for Google Chrome and Firefox.
9gag,1ebwf2,YinYar2,7,Tue May 14 22:51:04 2013 UTC,Really?  I was under the impression it cost a certain fee per month.  I shall look into this immediately
9gag,1ebwf2,VirSpector,5,Tue May 14 23:13:50 2013 UTC,You must be thinking about reddit gold.
9gag,1ebwf2,Cerealforsupper,1 point,Sun May 19 09:47:19 2013 UTC,"It's Reddit Gold. Different thing.  RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) is a free Google Chrome and Firefox extension making everything easier, from viewing photos and videos without opening the link, unlimited scrolling, etc. etc.  Google it, since I'm too lazy to find the link and post it here. Maybe some other redditors is not as lazy as me to do it."
9gag,1ebwf2,Cerealforsupper,9,Sun May 26 12:45:17 2013 UTC,"I'm exactly like you. Used 9gag a lot back in the days, heard about Reddit, used both sites, forgot about 9gag after. I do miss it sometimes, but I hated the fact that it was an absolute cluster fuck of different content from different categories in one place. It's basically gaming, anime, pokemon, cute animals, art, celebrities, memes, etc. The cool thing about reddit is the subreddits; you get to see the type of stuff you want to see."
9gag,1ebwf2,MelonHeadSeb,1 point,Thu May 16 20:04:31 2013 UTC,"I like how you can find the communities you really love. I'm personally subbed to /r/civ, /r/minecraft, /r/sfm, and /r/nerdcubed"
9gag,1ebwf2,shmuklidooha,2,Thu May 16 23:29:44 2013 UTC,Yeah it's very cool cause you find new subreddits that catch your attention all the time. I live in the smallest town ever and there's one for it!
9gag,1ebwf2,NikVik,2,Fri May 17 01:14:20 2013 UTC,I like it when see other procrastinators on random subreddits.
9gag,1ebwf2,michaelhands,3,Sat May 18 17:53:55 2013 UTC,"The whole point of having to click on each link is so that traffic gets diverted to the source of the content, thus giving credit to the content creator. Which is kinda why I'm not much of a fan of Imgur, since that's where many posts link to."
9gag,1ebwf2,vilest,2,Wed May 15 08:51:14 2013 UTC,"If there is one thing I dislike about 9gag it's this: Usual English: What it feels like/how it feels 9gag: How it feels like  God damnit, it's either What it feels like or How it feels, you can't just mix them, 9gag!"
9gag,1ebwf2,CFourIs1337,1 point,Fri May 17 15:20:08 2013 UTC,i honestly joined reddit because of the reddit enhancment suite that allowed you to scroll down   but now i cant cannot stand 9 gag for the unoriginal content and watermarks

9gag,1ebwf2,DanezTHEManez,1 point,Fri May 17 21:11:12 2013 UTC,"I came to reddit from 9gag too. I used both for some time, but then switched to reddit, because many stuff you would see on 9gag was on reddit before(and reddit has a better community)"

9gag,1ebwf2,erythro,1 point,Mon Jun 3 02:19:28 2013 UTC,"I agree with you, 9gag is easier to use and has a far better web design than reddit. If you want that experience 9gag has to offer, I recommend you a Reddit client. Good examples are ""Reditr"" for Windows or ""Baconreader"" for Android, which also has a nice slideshow mode, where you can simply swipe trough posts. Give it a try! :)"
9gag,1e4e1n,Pixelprou,55,Sat May 11 09:22:48 2013 UTC,Reddit is fucking easy to use how can't she... glad she went to 9gag.
9gag,1e4e1n,TheRedditSurvivalist,31,Sat May 11 16:58:51 2013 UTC,How do i search bar?
9gag,1e4e1n,cmgg,14,Sat May 18 03:15:56 2013 UTC,"The design isn't as beautiful. 9gag kind of has a similar design to social sites, while reddit has a really simple design, so people that are on FB all the time and are used to that might find it nicer."
9gag,1e4e1n,CFourIs1337,43,Sun May 26 16:28:22 2013 UTC,Hoooly fucking shit MY EYES MY EYES!

9gag,1e4e1n,werewolf2814,9,Sat May 11 10:15:32 2013 UTC,Reddit Enhancement Suite
9gag,1e4e1n,Cupcake_in_Acid,2,Mon May 20 23:38:47 2013 UTC,That's the problem. We shouldn't HAVE to install a 3rd party addon to enjoy Reddit.
9gag,1e4e1n,Ging287,14,Mon Jun 24 19:38:41 2013 UTC,"In a way, I'm happy that she didn't join our ranks..."
9gag,1e4e1n,cmann360zamboni,7,Sun May 12 16:33:53 2013 UTC,People like this are to lazy to try and learn something new.

9gag,1e40dc,MegaTurtleClan,9,Sat May 11 03:32:41 2013 UTC,Actually we got our entire high school to play this essentially. One person started as zombie. Rey could mark you with a sharpie anywhere on body. Humans wore beads. Throw paper balls stops the zombie. Try to survive all week. Really fun
9gag,1e40dc,choldslingshot,2,Sat May 11 07:30:37 2013 UTC,Shit dude.. Isn't it kind of easy to cheat on a game like that?

9gag,1e0mik,bartholomeu_jr,15,Thu May 9 18:41:20 2013 UTC,Upvote??? Did they steal that too?
9gag,1e0mik,TheRedditSurvivalist,6,Thu May 9 21:52:59 2013 UTC,They could have just said what it really was: Use a bot to push all the shit forward in a few minutes

9gag,1dmfo1,therager74jk,3,Fri May 3 22:44:17 2013 UTC,"The shit-fest we call FunnyJunk, do not mention it.  In all seriousness, it's mostly horny smug 14-year olds with a PhD.  It's reddit, but a decade younger."
9gag,1dbiy8,Popipenguin,15,Mon Apr 29 04:54:22 2013 UTC,I think there used to be a watermark system but they pretty easily removed it or just ignored it if it was subtle enough
9gag,1dbiy8,nipnip54,12,Mon Apr 29 05:51:22 2013 UTC,"If a user would re-post from reddit, and the post contained a reddit logo, or the reddit alien for example, the Admins of 9gag would go in and edit the picture and remove it.  There was a post where this happend a few weeks ago."
9gag,1dbiy8,ZionTheKing,7,Mon Apr 29 08:17:50 2013 UTC,Yeah. I can see some of the 9gag rage comics were copied from here but with their alien watermark edited out.
9gag,1dbiy8,smikims,5,Mon Apr 29 09:50:25 2013 UTC,I see
9gag,1dbiy8,nipnip54,3,Mon Apr 29 07:14:17 2013 UTC,"No, there never has been. Reddit doesn't host images. Any system like that would be up to the people we link to (link imgur)."
9gag,1dbiy8,smikims,1 point,Wed May 1 23:10:41 2013 UTC,well i remember a while ago reddit watermarks were pretty common and sometimes they were a solid logo in the corner
9gag,1dbiy8,shmuklidooha,2,Wed May 1 23:37:26 2013 UTC,"That was always a thing individual users did, not something reddit (or any sub for that matter) enforced."
9gag,1dbiy8,prestonicus711,13,Thu May 2 00:37:26 2013 UTC,"in /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, lots of posts have the reddit alien watermark for precisely this reason. It's still not mandatory though.  Still glad to hear that you moved to reddit, welcome to the fun!"
9gag,1dbiy8,mosarmini,7,Mon Apr 29 07:05:53 2013 UTC,Thanks for the warm welcome man!
9gag,1dbiy8,mosarmini,4,Mon Apr 29 07:12:23 2013 UTC,"Same for me. Used to use 9gag religiously. And now I discovered reddit. I have changed, I have xhanged"

9gag,1dbiy8,trannot,8,Mon Apr 29 07:26:02 2013 UTC,Here.
9gag,1dbiy8,cmann360zamboni,5,Mon Apr 29 07:34:01 2013 UTC,"Thanks for that man, in my opinion I see that the fact that 9gag takes credit for reposts off other websites to boost their website traffic justified those attacks. (Some of course went a bit too far)"
9gag,1dbiy8,lukelnrd,7,Mon Apr 29 07:45:58 2013 UTC,Yeah. I mean Reddit re-posts but at least we quote the site it originated from. 9 gag is just doing plain plagiarism and what's worse is that they sell meme merchandise for memes that they didn't make.
9gag,1d8umv,lukenog,25,Sun Apr 28 00:26:29 2013 UTC,Don't link to 9gag....
9gag,1d8umv,DanezTHEManez,10,Sun Apr 28 01:13:38 2013 UTC,I forgot.

9gag,1d8h7c,soontobeGM,12,Sat Apr 27 20:57:19 2013 UTC,shitty rage comics   So just rage comics then.
9gag,1d8h7c,SMUT_ADDICT,10,Sat May 11 14:53:13 2013 UTC,And somehow they'll find a way to repost the shitty content on their lovely site. Didn't either Reddit or 4Chan do an attack that was similar to your post not too long ago? I'd love to see it happen again
9gag,1d8h7c,mosarmini,12,Sat Apr 27 23:06:40 2013 UTC,"During the 4chan-9gag war, 4chan spammed 9gag with posts of gore and porn. 4chan won very quickly after that."

9gag,1d8h7c,bowld123,7,Sun Jun 23 21:22:00 2013 UTC,I heard they don't like ponies either.

9gag,1d8h7c,Wu_Tang_Shogun,10,Sun May 12 05:49:13 2013 UTC,"I don't hate ponies, but I do hate 9gag."
9gag,1d8h7c,Awesome_Auger,4,Sun May 12 05:52:42 2013 UTC,"Then lets make a rage comic with all the stuff on the list OP made, ponies & the glorification of reddit, that will piss them the fuck off, & if we can get everyone on this sub-reddit, it might get to the front page, depending on how many upvotes or whatever the fuck they have, it takes to make it to the front page."
9gag,1d8h7c,Wu_Tang_Shogun,2,Sun May 12 05:57:29 2013 UTC,Is it even possible to blend all of those together in one comic?
9gag,1d8h7c,Awesome_Auger,5,Sun May 12 06:01:04 2013 UTC,"Maybe it is & maybe it's not, but I'll be damned if I don't try.  FOR THE DEMISE OF 9GAG!"
9gag,1d8h7c,Wu_Tang_Shogun,6,Sun May 12 06:16:06 2013 UTC,"Indeed, the 9gags will gag on their own folly. The Redditian revenge will be so great every 9gager will soil themselves with the shit that makes up their ""humor"".  Every black day they stole a rightful Reddit relic will be etched into the void of forgotten memories and all that will remain will be a smoldering husk of what was once the scourge known as 9gag. Now we cry: ""Havoc!"" And let slip the dogs of war."

9gag,1d39x8,shmuklidooha,14,Fri Apr 26 13:08:52 2013 UTC,It's common knowledge that 9gag uses bots to smiley posts. That's why most posts are made from only a few users.

All these articles lacks any kind of logic, some of them are ironic. You keep making articles about how 9gag is homophobic while using the term 9fag for starters.  And for the last, there are these stories that you make up. Claiming that 9gag made Bad Luck Brian into a meth addict etc.  Edit: I'm not defending 9gag, I hate it as much as the next person does."
9gag,19kwe6,Cakesmite,2,Sat Mar 9 13:18:24 2013 UTC,It's slightly ironically ridiculous like SRS. The term 9fag was mostly used by my other admins. You could become the admin of the page if you'd want.

I think he got so upset abut that las remark about don't having a girlfriend that he regeously submitted a PrintScreen to /r/9gag calling this lady ""bitch"". Of course she didn't need  either to point that out but I think he had that coming. Besides, /r/9gag is about how 9gag steals shit from everywhere, not about how a comment is submitted over and over again, thing that also happens on reddit."

9gag,18miyr,tavison,8,Sat Feb 16 18:17:01 2013 UTC,"Internet is like a drug. You have cocaïne wich represents reddit and is for the rich and wealthy, you also have the bad/cheap type of cocaïne wich represents 4chan (it is à litte more odd and weird than reddit but it still is pretty cool). 9gag is like meth, it is made with ingredients that are very important for cocaïne but i is very bad, you also have Paco, Paco is for the incredibly poor and stupid people that are just... Poor and stupid, Paco is a mixture from Some of the above, but is is very bad. That is the connection"

There is a good article about 9gag on reddit, it's called ""9gag repost machine explained"" (on /r/4chan I believe).  I hate the shit out of 9gag, but literally among all my friends and people I know there are 5 redditors and 100 9faggers. The main problem with 9gag is its popularity and that it's fool-proof, a 4yo could use 9fag whilst reddit is hard to navigate on at the beginning.

9gag,15e1ja,thaFalkon,7,Tue Dec 25 13:31:38 2012 UTC,"I completely agree, I come here alot, although I don't post very often. In the morning, I might sit down and read some comics or whatever to while I'm having breakfast and see a wad of new content, and then these 9fag 'friends' of mine always tell me about this great post they saw on 9gag. And I shit you not, 70% of that content is from reddit, and I know it but I could never prove it before because of the posting time inaccuracies. However, a few weeks ago, I saw this piece of bullshit -   The owner of 9Gag, Paul Horner, said he thinks Reddit is just jealous of 9Gag’s success. “It’s a well known fact that 95% of all Memes and funny images on the internet originate from 9Gag. Reddit doesn’t like this so they try and tear down our website with their childish little shenanigans. Maybe this $50 million lawsuit will shut them up,” Horner laughs.'  I get frustrated every time I re-read this. Not only do they steal from Reddit, but they claim to have made 95% OF ALL MEMES. And they are still thinking of this lawsuit. This needs to stop.  -Source - http://superofficialnews.com/tag/9gag/ (I had more but I couldn't find them again, just search 'reddit vs. 9gag lawsuit)"
9gag,15e1ja,rockyearth,1 point,Fri Dec 28 09:43:45 2012 UTC,"Ahh fuck me. Even the rest of the internet can't be trusted... But the thing is, whenever someone posts a comment that even mentions reddit on a 9gag post, it is removed. Therefore, you can't claim it as your own and that some 9fagger stole it, the only place to complain is here, isn't it? Then again, the reposting is mostly done by bots. As '9FAG_EXPERT' says, there is a bot called 'madeyoulol' so I went and checked. 'Madeyoulol' was the owner of around 30% of the posts on the front page, while I only saw other names once or twice. Could it be the actual users, or the website itself trying to earn profit (lol not the website, the people controlling it) with advertising, so they copy content from Reddit to keep people interested in the site... I have no idea what I'm talking about."

9gag,15e1ja,Cakesmite,-22,Sun Dec 30 21:45:04 2012 UTC,"Well, I don't think 9gag is in the business of being a platform for publishing stupid shit for liberal hipster douchebags, who's biggest life achievement is sitting at Starbucks and writing a blog about some shitty bands that no one cares about. I'm pretty sure they're in the business of making money. And browsing 9gag is much more easier and fun than reddit. That's why so many people visit them. And the fact because 9gag only post funny/interesting pictures, not ""serious"" stuff (which basically means liberal and atheistic bullshit) makes it much more fun to browse. And 99.5% of people don't give a fuck that one or another picture originated from reddit: 9gag gives much better experience for an average user. Not sure if this is true, but being a website owner myself I'm pretty sure that's possible: 9gag could be making $15K per day. So eat shit, you jealous little fuck.  And by the way, get a life."

9gag,14ua9m,leocooper,12,Fri Dec 14 13:13:35 2012 UTC,"This is not a new strategy, this happened ever since they started stealing content from reddit.  Explanation  This happens because 9GAG's script that steals images grabs ALL images from http://www.reddit.com/r/all/, http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/, etc.  Now bots/scripts usually don't have adblock installed. In that case, there will be an ad at the top. The bot ignores that, since it is not a direct image link (like imgur).  But sometimes this happens: it shows a random new submission (in order to promote it <-- this was useful when reddit had a lot less posts, now it is useless). Good chances are, that post is shitty.  But 9GAG's script/bot doesn't recognize that. It thinks it's another top post from reddit and steal it.  The 9GAG ""Stolen Content Moderation"" Team doesn't notice that and puts it in the 9GAG Post queue. Where it will get automatically posted to the Trending page and the post time is set back 6 or 8 hours in time.    That's the full story behind it, read it if you want to know the real reason why this happens."

9gag,1086py,TheShuckler,1 point,Sun Oct 21 02:22:00 2012 UTC,"Before, this subreddit was about how pissed everyone was at 9gag. This was a terrible subreddit, and when you searched /r/9gag to see if there was a fan page for it, you felt good finding a pisshole of shit with posts like FUCK 9GAG. A minor thing but a nice thing, especially in the early days, when 9gag had just come about and you felt alone in your hate for the creature.  In the comment section we would discuss. We would talk about how moronic the 9gag website was, how it's users comments made us cringe, how we couldn't believe people would go there day after day for the same recycled dead people Matrix shit to be pumped into them. Eventually we came to a long drawn out conclusion. What if the 9gag website was a gift. What if 9gag was taking the shitty users away from other websites. Because of the morons of the world going to 9gag there was less and less drooling and shitting on the rest of us. After the community reached this conclusion there was a slow period of a few months during which the posts reduced and we became at peace. 9gag was a terrible, terrible website. But there was a silver lining to the cloud of fuck it produced in that the users were there and we were here.  We never compared reddit and 9gag. We knew we never had to. We knew that at that point we would change. Change from being a subreddit that acknowledged the hate for 9gag, but ultimately was a place were you could find others that felt the same way, and know you wern't alone.  Now this subreddit is a industrial circlejerk machine. Yes we know 9gag is a piece of shit, but let it be. The shitty users stay where they are. We don't give a fuck about comparing reddit and 9gag and how awesome reddit is and how shit 9gag can turn. We especially don't give a fuck about helping some 12 year old faggot trying to redirect his sister away from 9gag and to reddit. That is a horrible idea. Go and cry to you parents. Hide your sisters Bieber CD. You are becoming something you don't intend to be, and from an outside perspective, you look like a moronic cuntbag that no one wants to listen to and someone that no one wants to help. You have become the cancer. You have become the moron."
