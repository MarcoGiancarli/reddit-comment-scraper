EliteHudson,3e6i8k,CMDRJohnCasey,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:56:28 2015 UTC,I have a Class 2 fuelscoop with a scoop rate of 65/s. It's ok but I have to refuel every 3rd star because of the tiny tank. Certainly it's possible to fly 100 ly and undermine there. But it would be better if I could fortify a system on the way to the target system with more than 8 units. So my next ship should be an allrounder.   But I don't see how to make enough money in less then 15 weeks if I play PP at that time. I will not sell my lovely Cobra and my angry Vulture ;)

Most builds will give it a slow top speed, but that is only a problem when someone is running away. Lots go for the FDL or Python but you need to earn lots for that.  As regards PP only being for rich CMDRs, I don't think that is true. You can hit level 4 by doing undermining fairly easily on your own, or really easily in a wing. That will give you 5 million per week (plus small change for the kills).  Flying the Vulture into enemy control systems can take some time, but a class 2 fuel scoop will help.  Also, While we are at the top there is a 50% bonus on all bounty hunting kills, get a good spwan at a RES and that Vulture can bring in over 4 million an hour. Even if we drop we will still get a bonus, how large it is depends on our position."

Yes you run the risk of interdiction, but NPC interdictions you can get away from.  You'll have to either wing up or go solo/private if CMDR interdictions are a problem."

EliteHudson,3dzm4t,Ant-Solo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"The post above is worth reading, it details how Overhead works and the changes that are inbound.  This by Jgm on Page 9 is interesting:   Due to the low overheads early on this allows smaller powers to expand relatively painlessly until somewhere around 45 control systems. However, beyond this point their previous actions will dictate their future expansion ability. Those who picked ""good"" systems (good being income minus upkeep somewhere north of 70CC) will be able to continue to expand without fear of being sent in to turmoil, however those who picked ""bad"" systems will need to be on their toes fortifying all of their existing control systems as well as avoiding expanding in to non-optimal control systems as otherwise they'll end up with a CC deficit.  Interestingly, this change would put Mahon front and centre in the best position to become the largest power. The imperial powers lose due to their close proximity and taking too much of each others' income, along with choices of control systems which were optimal under the current-but-one system but would be considered bad under the new. Federation fortunes are mixed, with Hudson doing okay but Winters not. Yong-Rui is given a bit more CC to prepare expansions, and Delaine and Antal have no significant change.  In terms of strategy and counter-strategy: small powers (<45 control systems) are basically untouchable in that undermining them makes little difference to their expansion capability given the small number of systems that they need to fortify to maintain a suitable CC budget. Medium powers (45-55 control systems) will be vulnerable if/when they do not fortify their control systems and become open to undermining. Larger powers (>55 control systems) will need continual and dedicated fortification each cycle to avoid falling in to turmoil.  Technically the system is okay, but completely relies on players being willing to fortify their control systems every cycle to avoid turmoil. If everyone walked away from Powerplay for a cycle then a number of powers (3 at the moment but the number will increase as powers become larger) would fall in to turmoil. Is this really what you are after?"

The basic responses were along the lines of how dare I suggest that the chosen play-style of many players be something that FD make impossible or difficult for them to do. Having thought about it, as annoying as it is, we have no choice but to live with this, as basically, at the end of the day, any player can choose to play how he or she wishes.  The other problem is that there are valid reasons other than 5th columnists acivities for expanding into a particular system that is not at all desirable for the power as a whole. This makes it impossible to say whether 5th columnist actions were the intent or not. Other reasons for expanding into particular systems are using the power bonuses to be applied to a certain system for increased personal profit through trade, while that system may be an extremely poor choice with respect to the power play mechanics. Then we have role-play reasons such as what is going on at Lugh right now, which is our largest head-ache over at Winters in power-paly to date."

EliteHudson,3dmaxq,Spirouac,2,Fri Jul 17 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not opposed to misdirection, but it's difficult to pull off here since a lot of commanders would not be able to tell the difference between valid intel and the false intel we planted. I feel this would lead to lower rank commanders following the false intel and potentially losing their ships, I don't want that blood on my hands."

EliteHudson,3dmaxq,CMNDVadek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"I can confirm they are still actively hunting our res sites.  Yesterday I was in a popular high intensity res near nanoman.    A group of 4 enemy cmnds waited till I engadged a wing of 3 NPC'S.  They seemingly appeared out of nowhere and opened fire on me. Including the NPC's I had 7 ships shooting at me.  Needless to say my python did not last  long.   I believe they were using silent running, as they were not on radar prior to attacking me.  The wing had an anaconda and a clipper, never got a look at the others.    Use caution in our res sites."
EliteHudson,3dmaxq,Chris_Hatchenson,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"Correct, they generally use Diamondback Scouts, Diamondback Explorers, and Asps in packs of 4-6 fitted with the Imperial Hammer and silent running. They use this tactic to get very close to their targets, unload multiple railguns at once, and duck back into space."
EliteHudson,3dnzmf,Kevin_DD,3,Fri Jul 17 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"That's great. I think we all need to play the game at our pace and not for the grind. I have limited play time, too, but I am quite happy of my ships (biggest are a Vulture and an Asp) and my balance. Today I gave a hard time to a FDL with a Viper. I lost, but I had fun. That's the important thing. I also have fun playing strategy games and that's why I'm keeping myself in PP."
EliteHudson,3dnzmf,CMDRJohnCasey,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about powerplay.  Everyone will at some point, because the mechanics are bare bones and thankless.  The ALD bailout also made me feel like all my actions are meaningless, as the rules can change at a whim.  However, I will continue to play as I wish, without trying to push arbitrary bars over arbitrary trigger points.  I had fun escorting a Winters guy in Empire space who was being harassed last night, and even if he probably didn't need the help, it was the idea of roleplay and player interaction which made those moments interesting.  Hammer's Wrath are great.  I also admire the 'Velites' of ALD, who act like a Uboat Wolfpack, rising up out of the deep to launch torpedoes at the oblivious enemy.  These little player driven stories and imaginative use of the sandbox are what keeps Powerplay of interest to me.  Powerplay gives context to action, and at least a sense of meaningful impact on 'life' in the galaxy.  I will hate to see systems go unfortified etc, but goddamn that was killing me."
EliteHudson,3dnzmf,SirBeastly,2,Sat Jul 18 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"Understand your frustration man, but I'd knock out the 800 merits needed for a 5mil salary. That's just easy money."

EliteHudson,3dnzmf,Frank_K_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're complaining about. I earned back the 5.5k merits I lost to decay, by spending roughly 3-4 hrs shipping ~500 units of fortification supplies at a time - http://i.imgur.com/rbTDfQF.jpg - 11 runs back and forth and I was done for the week! C'est la vie! :)  Sure, you need a T9 to do it, and you'll need to burn through your entire 50M salary to fast-track the supplies (rather than wait 30 minutes), but the rank 5 bounty bonuses alone are SO worth it. For instance, this is what I got in 3-4 hrs of bounty hunting with ALD rank 5 bonuses: http://i.imgur.com/9yGhMWK.jpg  Now, go out there and enjoy powerplay."
EliteHudson,3dnzmf,SirWhitefall,2,Sat Jul 18 09:35:12 2015 UTC,"So you're over-fortifying Guathiti to a bazillion percent and done nothing useful for your faction, and you've spent 8 hours and earned yourself 50 mil. Is that really ""enjoying"" PowerPlay? Do you really believe it's not broken? Your own actions seem to indicate otherwise. I would have thought regular trading was more fun for 6 mil an hour.  And what's the fascination ALD faction members have with the Hudson sub? Slimy slavers go home."
EliteHudson,3dnzmf,msqrd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"I grinded my 5.5k merits back (after they decayed), in about 3 hrs of shipping fortification supplies to Guathiti. If I'd spent that time undermining or shipping them longer distances to places that need them then it would have massively increased the time it takes to grind the 5.5k back. The former would take almost the entire week to do at 15 merits a pop.  If the devs reward me more for taking supplies further, then maybe I'll consider doing it. Right now it's just 2 jumps to Guathiti from Kamedhanu, so no wonder people fortify it to insane levels.  Quite frankly I'm not really taking part in PP. I'm just in it for the sweet bounty bonuses. I spent 3-4 hrs in ALD space at a RES site last night and earned 54M, so the bonuses are a definite must have."
EliteHudson,3dnzmf,SirWhitefall,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"And there is the root problem with the way powerplay is setup.  People aren't playing it to enjoying it, they're just min/maxing it often to the detriment of the power itself."

EliteHudson,3dnzmf,Frank_K_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nothing beats just doing 10-11 runs and then 'done' for the week. I can't believe I used to spend all week undermining just to maintain my rank. What a grind that was, in comparison."

EliteHudson,3dj7ta,Darthun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"I must have missed what that is, I'll catch up on TS later tonight.  I was wondering if I gave my fortifying supplies to someone else, if they could deliver both, get the merits & apply the total towards the fortification.  If that's the case, then you could have a bunch of CMDRs drop their fortification supplies outside one of the stations, while having someone pick them up to drop them off in mass.  Add 2 others in a wing, one at both ends, and you should allow for faster fortification."

The last two weeks we were all but ignored when submitting tickets through the official site. I think we all would appreciate it if you could look into these tickets as well to determine why no action was taken. It makes us feel like the red-headed stepchildren of the galaxy when FDev pulls major strings to fix the actions of Empire powers but takes three weeks to fix a single issue for Federation powers."

This was intended to have been fixed for all systems and powers, thanks in no small part to you guys pointing it out to us. However something obviously didn't work as intended so we poked the dev team after seeing this. :)  If you send in tickets as Bug Reports, please be aware that you're unlikely to get a response, as they go direct to QA who start testing, then pass it on to Devs to start fixing.  If you send a ticket as anything else, it will go to us and we will respond to you, even if it's just ""we're looking into this for you"". Often there won't be much we can do as support other than chase up those who can affect change.  Cheers, CMDR Atom"
