pitbulls,3dyysz,minkabun,6,Mon Jul 20 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"Supposedly 3/4 Rottweiler 1/4 Pit Bull. I don't believe that though. He's weirdly tall and skinny. Here's Kaos next to him. Kaos is 25"" tall at the withers and about 80lbs, pretty gangly himself. Not sure how tall the other dog is but he's just under 100lbs. I'm not too sure where he gets his height from though. He did look like a Rottweiler when he was a puppy though."

pitbulls,3du9uk,nevalee,9,Sun Jul 19 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"It's not a muzzle, it's a gentle leader- much like the ones used on horses. They are recommended to use with larger dogs or any sized dog that pulls a lot when on a leash. It is much easier to control the dog by controlling where their head goes vs trying to control their neck/chest. Bacardi can still eat, drink, give kisses, and chew on her toys with it on. Gentle leaders may slightly restrict how wide a dog can open their mouth, but that is not it's intended purpose.  EDIT: sorry I didn't check to see if someone else had responded first :)"
pitbulls,3du9uk,greeneyedjellycat,3,Sun Jul 19 18:47:51 2015 UTC,It's not a muzzle. It's a type of gentle leader. It helps dogs walk better On a leash.

I'll get first choice and I have to title the dog in conformation and one dog sport, as well as get his CGC. Once all that's done and he's had all the required health tests the breeder uses the dog for a breeding and the paperwork is all switched over to my name.   I'm over the moon with how great this breeder is. She'll be mentoring me through everything.  Heres the dam and here is the stud she'll most likely be using. He's a hog dog that lives in Texas and does bitework as well."

She's actually one of the people that's been organizing the pull practices in my city, though she lives in the next province over. The only problem with that is the practices are held at a dog kennel I briefly worked for. I swore I would never support that place again based on how the staff treated the dogs. Uhg lol."

pitbulls,3do411,slamthedog,10,Sat Jul 18 01:30:15 2015 UTC,"Well if you want my opinion, purchasing a pitbull is really irresponsible, there are so many dying in shelters. Moreso than any other breed, pitties are dying, please at least consider adopting! Shelters and foster homes have soooo many beautiful dogs, check your local shelter's website and they have plenty of pictures!"
pitbulls,3do411,ladycoleopterist,8,Fri Jul 17 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"I am actually Pakistani. Pitbulls are rare here, and there are very few animal shelters here. I think maybe 3 in the whole country run by good Samaritans.  Furthermore my first two dogs were stray puppies I adopted off the street and the third was a 3 year old Afghan Livestock Guardian who belonged to a friend but he and his family moved to the UK so I ended up taking her in. She had to be put to sleep last year at the age of 9 because she had developed bad arthritis."

Sorry to hear about your dog :(  I usually just try to educate as many people as I can, sometimes people don't really realize the situation over here and the breeding is out of control."
pitbulls,3do411,ladycoleopterist,0,Sat Jul 18 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"Some western breeds are very popular over here. Labs, GSD's and Rottweillers especially. Pitbulls are less common but not unheard of. Once people get these western breeds they are seen as a status symbol so they tend to keep them.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/p/pakistanimastiff.htm  https://www.dogbreedinfo.com/p/pakistanibullterrier.htm  These are two Pakistani breeds. Commonly found in villages, not as popular in cities. I might end up getting one of them, they are often used as dog fighting dogs so I'll see it as rescuing one even if I buy a puppy because that way nobody will be able to abuse then that way."

pitbulls,3do411,bigbluebully,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you look into adopting. It might just be my city, but they always have a number of pit bulls in need of a good home. It's cheaper and gives a dog in need a home. Ultimately it is your choice though.  I'm not sure what it is, but it doesn't like an american bully. They are shorter and much more squat. They have very wide stances and bodies. Their snouts are shorter as well. The dog in the pictures doesn't seem to have much muscle tone, something very prominent in american bullies and less so in APBTs. The face doesn't seem to look like either to me. I'm not sure what that dog is, but it looks suspicious to me."
pitbulls,3do411,smashley951,5,Fri Jul 17 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"It's a poorly bred American Bully. Also, American Bullies have different classes and come in many different sizes ranging from around 50 to 120lbs."

pitbulls,3dkejr,designgoddess,3,Fri Jul 17 02:34:05 2015 UTC,"I've posted to Craigslist before with details, but when the owner contacted me, I made him email me more photos of the dog so I knew he was the real owner. Perhaps you could try that, too?"
pitbulls,3dkejr,designgoddess,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely going to do this, thanks for the suggestion."
pitbulls,3dkejr,DrPoopenheimer,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Make them supply proof. Post under Lost & Found and Pets. Also call animal control and the police to report you have them. Around here the police get all lost dog reports have helped me find the owners. I second Lost Dogs of Texas as well.
pitbulls,3dkejr,bigpix,2,Fri Jul 17 04:09:40 2015 UTC,I didn't know that about the police. Will do!
pitbulls,3dkejr,designgoddess,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:22:06 2015 UTC,It might be different there. Even around here most people don't know to call. Our police department actually has a few kennels for found dogs that are turned over to them. They hold them for 24 hours before they go to animal control. It's a nice system designed to get dogs home. Good luck.
pitbulls,3dkejr,goloons,2,Fri Jul 17 05:10:47 2015 UTC,post in /r/sanantonio as well
pitbulls,3dkidx,greeneyedjellycat,4,Fri Jul 17 00:28:14 2015 UTC,That's great.  Unfortunately the Camp Bow Wow by my house doesn't take bully breeds :(

pitbulls,3dkidx,buildingbridges,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"That might be against the rules, have you called corporate headquarters to ask about it?"
pitbulls,3dkidx,Ripl,2,Fri Jul 17 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"No I haven't. I'm also not looking for a fight and I don't want my dog where he isn't welcome. We don't need then out necessity, they were just close-by (quarter mile) and thought our dog could use some playtime every once in a while.   We've since gotten a second SBT so he has canine company."

pitbulls,3dicr7,ridethepiggy,7,Thu Jul 16 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"Between his crooked jaw; snaggle tooth; bulgey eyes; and set back ears --- I just don't know what would be his biggest money maker?  HA.  When I told my girls we would adopt, I pictured a regal shepherd mix or something.  They stopped at his cage and ""found their dog.""  I never thought I could be as happy with a dog as I have been these last several years with him.  But at first, I thought, ""THIS guy is it - he is who you choose?""  LOL.  Love him!"
pitbulls,3dicr7,ridethepiggy,3,Thu Jul 16 14:50:42 2015 UTC,Has to be the tooth! So cute!~(˘▾˘~)  One of my boys has some jacked up teeth too and makes all kinds of weird noises but that's what makes them so loveable!
pitbulls,3dicr7,ChalkyLuvr69,3,Thu Jul 16 15:05:33 2015 UTC,Your girls have great taste! This isn't the first story I've heard about someone's kids picking out a pitbull when the parents were dubious and the dog turning out to be great.

pitbulls,3dicr7,OfficialCocaColaAMA,3,Sat Jul 18 21:31:16 2015 UTC,"It really upsets me when I see people on facebook talking about buying dogs from breeders. My close circle of friends would never buy from a breeder, but I feel like a lot of people just don't realize how many options they have adopting, and that by supporting breeders they are indirectly contributing to shelter dogs being put down. I always want to comment, letting them know there are plenty of breeds and plenty of pups in the shelter, but I feel like it's not my place to tell people what to do."
pitbulls,3dicr7,random_user_name_13,3,Thu Jul 16 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"And rescue dogs are great. I think the mix of breeds make them so unique. And if you want purebred, there are rescues for that, too."
pitbulls,3dicr7,adopted_dog_oscar,0,Thu Jul 16 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"Don't hate on the reputable breeders, their dogs don't end up in shelters. Hate on the backyard breeders.   Also, adopting isn't for everyone."
pitbulls,3dicr7,bigbluebully,2,Thu Jul 16 22:48:13 2015 UTC,"Not hating - I know that breed enthusiasts need a place, too.  I'm not for the puppies in the store but I know there are breeders with safe breeding practices.  I'm shelter/rescue only but I don't hate on people who make other choices."
pitbulls,3dicr7,adopted_dog_oscar,4,Sat Jul 18 21:34:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have dogs from a reputable breeder (30+ years in the business) and I get so much shit from people. Little do they know that I love rescue dogs, have had numerous rescue dogs, donate to MANY different rescues and volunteered at one! I just happened to get two of my dogs at a breeder because my husband and I wanted a specific dog. Then after we got #1 and our old rescue dog passed away from cancer, I got an email from her a month later with a puppy that looked JUST LIKE MY dog who had passed away. Just like don't always assume a dog who has cropped ears or a docked tail has a bad owner. That may have happened in the dogs previous life!"

pitbulls,3dgl5u,hamsammicher,5,Thu Jul 16 13:27:15 2015 UTC,Mast cell tumor? My pit just had one removed on Monday in the same exact spot.
pitbulls,3dgl5u,hamsammicher,5,Thu Jul 16 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"Yup! He went swimming in a pond and when he came out he had welts everywhere and was itchy like crazy. He and I were up all night. After a vet visit, steroid shot, and antibiotics he felt better. Then about a week after he had a lump that seemed to get bigger over night. He ended up ripping out some stitches and getting staples. Now he's perfectly fine."
pitbulls,3dgl5u,hamsammicher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:26:41 2015 UTC,"Wait, what?  How did the pond cause it?"
pitbulls,3dgl5u,AnorexicManatee,2,Thu Jul 16 17:01:35 2015 UTC,The type of tumor it ended up being ( I can't remember the name ) was developed due to the allergic reaction he had to whatever got him in the pond
pitbulls,3dgl5u,HelenZass,2,Thu Jul 16 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"""Mast cells are cells that reside in the connective tissues, especially those vessels and nerves that are closest to the external surfaces (e.g., skin, lungs, nose, mouth). Their primary functions include defense against parasitic infestations, tissue repair, and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). They are also associated with allergic reactions, since they contain several types of dark granules made up of various chemicals, including histamine and heparin, serving biologically to modify immune reactions and inflammation. Mast cells are derived from the bone marrow, and can be found in various tissues throughout the body."""

pitbulls,3de5ny,Germandexter,8,Wed Jul 15 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"I had no idea. My bigger boy is actually dog aggressive when we go on walks, I was really nervous for them to meet. He avoided her for the first few days but I worked with them a lot and they were best friends by the end of the first week.  The boy used to be toy possessive-aggressive too, even to humans. I can tell he still doesn't like it when he has a toy and she gets close but I'm not worried about a scuffle at this point."
pitbulls,3de5ny,Krystal907,11,Wed Jul 15 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"Be proactive! Every time she walks by, toss your boy a treat. Her being near him with a toy = yummy treat!"

pitbulls,3de5ny,bigbluebully,8,Wed Jul 15 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Harnesses for pulling! They pull me around on my longboard. I've been taking my boy out almost every day since I got him last November. He can pull me by himself for a few miles without any problems but he likes the help. They also wear collars while they have the harnesses on, and I switch the leash between harness and collar. I make them wear collars mainly because my neighbor has 3 Chihuahuas that they keep outside all the time. They yap at us the entire length of the fence when we leave and when we come back.... I hate those dogs... and their owner."
