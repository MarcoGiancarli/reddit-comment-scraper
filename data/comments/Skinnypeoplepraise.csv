Skinnypeoplepraise,39ede9,burntfishnchips,4,Thu Jun 11 08:09:21 2015 UTC,"Hahahha. Of course the fat ass piece of shit adminst were going to ban FPH. It was too popular and too big for it's own good. As soon as they made that stupid horseshit announcement about ""wah wah wah harassing"" full of vague SJW feely bullshit you knew it was coming. Get ready for more from these mealy mouth pussies."

Skinnypeoplepraise,39ede9,drkyle3337,7,Thu Jun 11 04:52:40 2015 UTC,"damn it, already? This is going to be an uphill battle."

Skinnypeoplepraise,39ede9,motherfalcker,2,Thu Jun 11 05:05:41 2015 UTC,goddamn it feels nice to see shit like this after fph was taken down by the head nanny of Reddit

Skinnypeoplepraise,39ds7j,A_Jehovahs_Witness,8,Thu Jun 11 02:07:06 2015 UTC,I'll sign my sister up for the program.
Skinnypeoplepraise,39ds7j,camelCaseCoder,6,Thu Jun 11 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"Charitable, I like it"
Skinnypeoplepraise,39ds7j,camelCaseCoder,3,Thu Jun 11 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"Another option - melt their fat down, and use it to produce lubricants and lamp oils to sell to hippies. Would pay for the doctors' time to liposuction them and staple their stomachs."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39ds7j,GreeniesInDehBowl,2,Thu Jun 11 14:10:18 2015 UTC,You are a genius. Fuck nuclear power. We need more fatty power!
Skinnypeoplepraise,39ds7j,Braindrool,2,Thu Jun 11 05:51:02 2015 UTC,You'd need a twinkie on the end of a fishing pole to get them to move though.
Skinnypeoplepraise,39f9a4,squeakyaletheia,4,Thu Jun 11 09:27:53 2015 UTC,"im not by any means super fit but damn, being in shape boosts my general confidence 10 fold."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39f9a4,GreeniesInDehBowl,2,Thu Jun 11 09:39:33 2015 UTC,That's wonderful! Keep going! We'll get there soon enough!
Skinnypeoplepraise,39f9a4,protein4dayz,6,Thu Jun 11 09:42:42 2015 UTC,"It's much cheaper to be fit, damn! Like you said, I'm full after eating less. I fill up more time being active and running and at the gym and playing with my kids rather than going out to spend the money in movies, buying shit, running up electric bills playing video games, etc. I just enjoy doing other things because I'm so much better at that stuff.   It's also really damn nice to walk into a room and turn heads. Fuck yes, fitness."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39f9a4,protein4dayz,2,Thu Jun 11 10:05:39 2015 UTC,"I never even thought about how much I do versus how much I haven't been doing. And I made connections with people that way. I have been to the beach, to zumba and cardio dance classes, and a lot of places I was too lazy to go to, but truly truly loved! I feel like I can take on the world again. I missed being active so much, but when I was overweight, I didn't even realize it."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39f9a4,protein4dayz,3,Thu Jun 11 10:14:00 2015 UTC,"Right! It's easy to meet people who live active lifestyles when you live one yourself. I love that I have friends who'll go hiking, rock climbing, and running with me. I love that a social gathering isn't just limited to sitting around a screen."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39f9a4,protein4dayz,2,Thu Jun 11 10:20:08 2015 UTC,"Right! And sometimes taking a lazy day fan be fun, but 10 minutes of yoga won't take too much out of anyone's time. That's what I learned this summer as I am not taking classes and don't have a job, haha."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,pure_trash,14,Thu Jun 11 02:46:45 2015 UTC,"From a fairly straight female, BOOBS and that flat stomach, you go girl!"
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,Slybunny,5,Thu Jun 11 05:17:40 2015 UTC,"Dayuuum!!!...clears throat I mean...Nice, very nice."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,LycraBanForHams,3,Thu Jun 11 09:01:01 2015 UTC,Not as nice as your username.
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,LycraBanForHams,2,Thu Jun 11 09:04:54 2015 UTC,Thanks. Was much nicer with my shitlord flair :(
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,GreeniesInDehBowl,2,Thu Jun 11 09:06:45 2015 UTC,Verify and you'll have a SpP flair :)
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,LycraBanForHams,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:05:44 2015 UTC,Good idea. Will do tomorrow :)
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,burntfishnchips,5,Thu Jun 11 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"You have an amazing body. I have a craving for chips whenever i eat a sandwich, so I know that chips crave."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,MrsStrom,3,Thu Jun 11 06:14:11 2015 UTC,Look at that thigh gap! Meow!
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,equus_du_nord,2,Thu Jun 11 13:05:41 2015 UTC,I ate a single bar in a kitkat and put the rest away. Treats are 1000000 times better when they're just that: TREATS!
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,GreeniesInDehBowl,10,Thu Jun 11 23:02:53 2015 UTC,"this jealous piece of shit over here, lol.  she's skinny and you can actually make out the human form. by all accounts, she's posting in the right place. this isn't hard bodies. OP did not profess to be an athlete.  but, oh, damn the skinny bitch for showing you up, huh? nasty fat fuck."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,GreeniesInDehBowl,7,Thu Jun 11 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"My hero! Thank you though. I actually have really low self esteem, and I was trying to tell myself that it was just a grouch, but it gets to ya. I spent a lot of time losing weight because I felt fat, and I finally feel okay about myself. So thank you."
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,equus_du_nord,6,Thu Jun 11 03:08:04 2015 UTC,Eat all the damn potato chips you want! You've got a nice body and are officially a verified non fatty. Welcome aboard :)
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,TheDon835,3,Thu Jun 11 03:10:32 2015 UTC,Awesome :) I was so sad about losing my fph flair.
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,equus_du_nord,3,Thu Jun 11 05:45:08 2015 UTC,No worries. Now you have a flair here and we as a community think you look great! Keep up the good work. :)
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,QueenoftheNorth82,6,Thu Jun 11 08:58:46 2015 UTC,[â€“]itmebloobs 1 point 5 minutes ago   You can really tell you used to be fat. It's kind of gross.   look what it does to try to deflect its own insecurities. like a fucking child. embarrassing.
Skinnypeoplepraise,39dysx,QueenoftheNorth82,5,Thu Jun 11 09:26:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for the repost!
