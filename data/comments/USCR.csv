USCR,3dzu40,ALOIsFasterThanYou,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:50 2015 UTC,It's a shame to see such a quality team fighting so hard for a ride
USCR,3dmibk,Bakkster,5,Fri Jul 17 13:57:59 2015 UTC,"I hope they won't leave the P class. I want to see TUSC with a strong top class, involving multiple OEMs."
USCR,3dmibk,August_R18,3,Fri Jul 17 19:20:32 2015 UTC,They can always test the waters with just the engine (I believe the engine in the Shank and ESM cars would still be USCR legal) in 2017 and if they're happy they could always get an areo kit a season or so later.
USCR,3dmibk,cwinnbari,3,Fri Jul 17 16:35:06 2015 UTC,Ligiers are too wide for the 2017 rules format. The only new LMP2 that fits the 2017 rules is the Oreca 05.  Odd that they just happen to have a car that fits the new rules package before anyone knows the rules.
USCR,3dmibk,iracecars,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:38 2015 UTC,He was talking about the engine. Valid point though.
USCR,3dmibk,TBurd01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"The HPD engine could basically be ready to go. If the 2017 cars are actually targeting less HP than TUSC currently depends on, problem solved. That might not help Judd or Nissan, but it's still a start."
USCR,3dmibk,TBurd01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:21:11 2015 UTC,"I thought the current P2s in Tudor were actually sped up to keep up with the DPs on the straights? But yeah yeah, we won't know if it'll work or not until the actual regs are released.  Honda has a F1 engine they could probably use. /s"
USCR,3dmibk,iracecars,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"They're sped up but they're not 600hp like the new spec engine is supposed to be.  They're around 520 or so for the HPD and 480-500 for the Judd and Nissan. In fact with the big displacement HPD (for the DP and RealTime WC Acura) they were having some real reliability issues when they started pushing for 600hp.  I'm not sure if they've fixed this with the Realtime, though if the Pikes Peak car was running the same engine combo then it looks like there are still issues."
USCR,3dmibk,TBurd01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:23:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, yeah. So might need some machining modifications or something. I'm sure if they are set on racing (which I hope they are), they'll build something reliable. Hopefully with bodywork as well."
USCR,3dmibk,TBurd01,3,Mon Jul 20 02:11:25 2015 UTC,Dallara Honda could be a good fit I think.
USCR,3dmibk,MrDisco99,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:51 2015 UTC,I could see them doing well as an engine supplier for TUSC prototypes.  Seems the engine/bodywork brand will be the one that really matters in this class.
USCR,3dmibk,cwinnbari,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, the one thing with the body kit is its supposed to be cosmetic and not give an aero advantage over another kit or the standard body  I'm good with that, other wise manufacturers would be going bonkers on aero development"
USCR,3dmibk,WarEagle33x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:00 2015 UTC,So the 04b could still possibly be used if someone wants it bad enough it looks like.
USCR,3dmibk,the_fos,3,Fri Jul 17 15:41:33 2015 UTC,You're better off grabbing an Oreca 05 than something that hasn't even been homologated yet.
USCR,3dmibk,WarEagle33x,2,Fri Jul 17 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's as likely as selling a refrigerator to an eskimo. Who's going to buy a struggling P2 just to race it for a season before the regulations change to a cheaper car to race?"
USCR,3dka3a,TBurd01,5,Thu Jul 16 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"I know the entire field doesn't go to Long Beach, but I really hope the GT is there. It'll be a real treat to see it race, given the brands history. Maybe they'll even get Gulf back as a title sponsor (I can dream)."
USCR,3dka3a,_McLaren,4,Fri Jul 17 03:12:23 2015 UTC,That would be quite the clash with the Astons in the WEC. :)
USCR,3dka3a,Bakkster,2,Fri Jul 17 04:10:44 2015 UTC,I guess we'll just have to settle with Martini and Rossi ;)
USCR,3dka3a,spatchbo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome.  Something like this would not surprise me either, since A) Chip Ganassi and B) the official renders already have a similar livery.  They will have the four cars total though, two here in America and two in the WEC, so we could see a few. Maybe they'll even run them all at Le Mans. :)"
USCR,3dka3a,terrrrrible,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah by the way: the GTLM cars go to Long Beach. Pending the new GT is actually finished and reliable by Daytona, it should be there."

USCR,3dka3a,Qel_Hoth,2,Fri Jul 17 07:28:22 2015 UTC,"Reading the article from Racer yesterday on CGR's driver selection process got me all excited for next year. I'm not old enough to have seen the original Ford GT race, and if anyone was racing the '04-'06 edition of it, I wasn't watching at the time. But the first time I saw that car, I absolutely fell in love with it. It's my ""If I ever win the lottery..."" car. I saw one driving through the streets of Boston one day, and I squealed at the sight of it.  Unless something changes, I doubt GTLM will end up at Lime Rock next year. Might have to talk to some friends about taking the trip over to the Glen. Though my father in passing has mentioned on multiple occasions, making trips to Daytona and Le Mans next year, so we'll see."

USCR,3dgefw,Bakkster,3,Thu Jul 16 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"Indeed. We have a fairly compact one on our car, but have plenty of room for a much larger one if needed.   I didn't see one on the M6 either."

USCR,3ddncn,Bakkster,4,Wed Jul 15 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"I get the impression Speedsource knows this is the package that can make them competitive, and they're just trying to convince Mazda corporate that it's still good (or better) advertising to run it instead of the production diesel. Otherwise they'd be running it already."
USCR,3ddncn,MrSamsonite10,2,Wed Jul 15 13:28:44 2015 UTC,"Problem is you can't advertise it as skyactiv, which is what is currently driving Mazda sales and growth."
USCR,3ddncn,MJDiAmore,3,Wed Jul 15 14:34:10 2015 UTC,"The engine wouldn't be SKYACTIV, no, but technically the SKYACTIV technology suite includes SKYACTIV-Body, which refers to lightweight, high safety rating crash materials.  You could argue the P2 fits that bill compared to the DP, being -119 kg and a safer driver tub...    Then the reps at the tracks can make the platform-wide pitch and dealers can explain more of the technology working in synergy with the engine in the road-going car."
USCR,3ddncn,iracecars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"Not as a road-based engine, but of course they could brand it as SKYACTIV. There's also the SKYACTIV-G.   A new-generation highly-efficient direct-injection gasoline engine that achieves the world's highest gasoline engine compression ratio of 14.0:1   The bigger question is whether the money for the program came from the diesel advertising budget, or otherwise needs approval to use a gas engine to advertise the brand because it's beyond the scope of the original agreement.  Either way, it's likely to be a temporary solution, since Mazda should need a road-based gas engine for 2017 with IMSA cracking down on waivers."
USCR,3ddncn,MrSamsonite10,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"But why would they need a production based engine at that point, if the spec V8 isn't going to be one."
USCR,3ddncn,MrSamsonite10,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"Production-based engines would continue as the sole format allowed in IMSA's P2 2017 plans, but a question has been raised by manufacturers whether bespoke engines would be permitted.   http://www.racer.com/imsa/item/118705-imsa-first-look-at-2017-prototype-regulations?showall=1&limitstart=  Presumably Mazda is (one of) the OEM asking about a bespoke engine."

USCR,3d4559,Bakkster,4,Mon Jul 13 11:08:55 2015 UTC,"A curious quote here:   Out of the four confirmed chassis constructors, only the Oreca 05 is understood to be able to be upgraded, in some form, to the new yet-to-be-finalized 2017 LMP2 regulations, and Flis admitted the French manufacturer is his team’s leading chassis option.   Curious that the only P2 constructor publicly in favor of the 4 CC limit happens to have the only car capable of being upgraded for the 2017 rules... did they have a sneak peek at the rules?"
USCR,3d4559,TBurd01,3,Mon Jul 13 16:38:08 2015 UTC,Why is the Ligier not upgradeable to 2017? I'd be pissed if I just bought a new one (or two).
USCR,3d4559,WarEagle33x,2,Mon Jul 13 16:25:19 2015 UTC,Yea I don't understand how Oreca got the jump on everyone but OnRoak didn't lol. I guess it's all just business that you and I don't get to hear about.

USCR,3d4559,CrizzleColts,9,Mon Jul 13 11:49:27 2015 UTC,Park it out back and buy a new chassis.    At its most basic the DP is a tube frame chassis vs the carbon fiber tub of the current P2 and 2017 P2 regs.
USCR,3d4559,TheFakeJerrySeinfeld,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"If they took the car out right now, how would it fair in performance compared to p1/p2"

USCR,3d4559,CrizzleColts,3,Mon Jul 13 14:33:41 2015 UTC,You mean like a new race lap record and podium finish after running 2 hours with no power steering?
USCR,3d4559,BreezyD,3,Mon Jul 13 14:52:25 2015 UTC,"Look at what Oak did with the same car last year. Nearly had a dominant win at CotA even after getting spun, and running strong until they crashed out of their other two events."
USCR,3d4559,MJDiAmore,2,Mon Jul 13 16:00:17 2015 UTC,"Look at the beginning of last season, when the P2s had an extra 5% HP but were still running the same 900kg weight. The P2s were faster in the corners, while the DPs blew by on longer straights and out of the slower corners, so it depended on the circuit.  But the biggest issue is one of the costly DP upgrades to get them to that speed, and their lack of crash testing."

I'd have been curious where it would have finished.  Whether any of the teams would have wanted to pay to run NC is obviously very debatable, but it would have been awesome."
USCR,3d0ck6,CrizzleColts,6,Sun Jul 12 12:43:24 2015 UTC,Wonder how much the upgraded body work will look like the old LC70 body work.
USCR,3d0ck6,iracecars,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:05:59 2015 UTC,That looks exactly the same?  I'd love to see them fit the Oreca 03 bodyworks.
USCR,3d0ck6,TBurd01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, wing, diffuser, rear arches, nose, and dive planes are all different.  That car has a lot more downforce.  The current PC car is like the LC70 in Le Mans trim with even more downforce taken off."
USCR,3d0ck6,iracecars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:02:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, well the nose looks very similar."
USCR,3d0ck6,TBurd01,4,Mon Jul 13 00:13:17 2015 UTC,"It's just the angle, the PC nose is a lot more stubby, the LC75 nose comes out to the end of the front splitter and is more pointy. The PC body like I said is very similar to the Le Mans LC75 body work.   PC  LC70  LC70 Le Mans  Which is partly where the low down force of the PC car comes from.  Having to run in Le Mans style aero everywhere the car goes really doesn't help it.   To put the PC chassis actual capabilities into perspective, in 2006 that chassis in LC70 trim lapped Le Mans at 3:34  current P2 cars are lapping around 3:38-3:41."
USCR,3d0ck6,iracecars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:06:32 2015 UTC,"Still looks pretty similar here. But yeah, I think they either use that bodywork or the 03."
USCR,3d0ck6,TBurd01,3,Mon Jul 13 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"I think it would be cheaper thought to just do the dive planes, diffuser, wing, and fin. Then add in TC and the cars should be right at the back of the P field."
USCR,3d0ck6,iracecars,2,Mon Jul 13 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yes TC would really help out the AM guys, and isn't the 6.2 currently choked quite a bit?"
USCR,3d0ck6,thyusername,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"Probably. I just love how the 03 looks. :)  Still hope whatever they do, they'll allow P3 cars. That'd be a really diverse mix. And they'd all sound like crap together. :)"
USCR,3d0ck6,TBurd01,4,Mon Jul 13 04:08:03 2015 UTC,As much as I like the idea of shiny new hardware I can't really argue with the financial logic of this plan
USCR,3d0ck6,brock1samson9,2,Sun Jul 12 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"Agree, its one of the most cost effective forms of sportscar racing.  My only question would be the lack of a full cockpit.  I thought they were moving to all prototypes having a completely enclosed cockpit."
USCR,3d0ck6,WilliamHowardTwat,2,Sun Jul 12 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"P2 and P3 regs for sure, but PC is kinda IMSA's own deal."
USCR,3d0ck6,WarEagle33x,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:37:12 2015 UTC,"It all depends if they have customers willing to keep racing. The teams are dependant on what the paying drivers want to do.  The best solution is whatever gets the most cars on the grid with the last overlap with other classes. Without knowing the Am driver's preferences, is hard to tell what that is."
USCR,3d0ck6,Bakkster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:30:34 2015 UTC,If they have a few variants of bodywork then it could hold interest. Still will probably have the boring rumbling V8 engines though.
USCR,3d0ck6,TBurd01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:17:11 2015 UTC,I can't say I'd mind this. I'd rather see LMP3 get properly sorted over the next few years before IMSA brings it over here.

USCR,3d0ck6,thyusername,3,Sun Jul 12 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"Because GTD, GTLM, and P will be faster classes in the coming years. If PC doesn't get sped up somehow, it will either directly conflict with GTLM and possibly GTD, or will be slower than the GT classes. Either way, that's not what IMSA really wants."
USCR,3d0ck6,WarEagle33x,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"You do know this car is already a dumbed down P1/P2 and is no where near optimum in current form right? Less power than a street camaro from a motor that is tuned to run the whole season, ride height issues, no traction control, and it is already a high down force car.  This is really nothing more than a visual update for hype.  I'm not sure if you used to watch ALMS but if you did, do remember top drivers in PC cars passing ALMS P2 not the greatest drivers?  I tried to find some links but I can't remember the exact races, I think Petit and Mid Ohio but years ago... http://www.racecar-engineering.com/cars/oreca-flm-09/"
USCR,3d0ck6,thyusername,2,Sun Jul 12 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"Not my point. They still need to be sped up, with or without the visual upgrades. But the improved aero will surely not hurt anything and the fin would be a very good upgrade."

Ganassi is already confirmed to be running the new GT cars, but I wouldn't be surprised if they made bodywork for the Riley-Multimac chassis (and also had an engine) for some other big team(s) to run for them.  You know Chevy is going to make a P2 bodywork/engine and run them like they do with the Corvette DPs now, so Ford probably wants a piece of that pie too. Chance to win all the big American races overall."

USCR,3cw8ou,Jensaarai,5,Sat Jul 11 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"DPs have gone through enough evolutions. For the speed they need to go now, a clean sheet design really is required to keep them safe.  Whether or not the 2017 regulations we end up getting are actually what the class needed or not is another question, but the decades of refreshes have left the cars too expensive to meet the real intent of the class."
USCR,3cw8ou,Bakkster,2,Sun Jul 12 01:50:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, personally I'd rather see another good GTLM entry anyway, but on IMSA's part it seems like a big piss off.  I know Honda wouldn't want to develop it more anyway with it not being able to run elsewhere, but they could cobble some aero fixes and lease it to a team and run the chassis out at least.  Extreme Speed could sell theirs for something at least ( I assume they still have them from what I've read, maybe I'm wrong)"
USCR,3cw8ou,thyusername,2,Sat Jul 11 20:21:47 2015 UTC,I don't think the new rules are any worse for IMSA than the old DP rules. It's still a limited number of approved chassis to which you can supply engines and modify the bodywork.  My only concern is the number of OEMs in the class as Chevy seems like the only one sure to be in 2017. I hope the engine rules will be relevant for OEMs to make the current ones continue in 2017 and new ones to join the class. I hope Honda continues in the P class besides their GT programme.

Definitely a marketing dilemma at this point -- as it's been since the SA-D couldn't make its way to the US the way they wanted it to because of the emissions regs and so on.    Possibly something on a comparison basis -- Mazda can make such good road-going engines so you can push them to within seconds of a bespoke race engine :)  Don't know that would work with the average joe unfortunately -- just look at some of the hate the squad gets at SC365 at times - and those are supposed to be people interested in the sport and that understand.  :/  Regardless, pulling for another P1 on the side this weekend :D"

USCR,3comup,iracecars,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:11:40 2015 UTC,I didn't believe for a second that Dallara hadn't submitted a bid. I don't know who told them otherwise.  Dallara always jumps at these type of small manufacture pool opportunity classes. Plus some of the other Euro manufactures specifically stated they did not submit bids because they knew the Dallara bid would over shadow them and that it wouldn't be worth it.
USCR,3comup,Bakkster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently Dallara responded that way to a direct question about whether they submitted a proposal.  However, the list passed around at Sebring implied that these four constructors announced today had already been selected that far back..."

USCR,3comup,TBurd01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"IMSA teams can have custom bodywork and engines, but only use the engines if they race Le Mans (or maybe the WEC Austin race?)  If I were the ACO, I'd just take all the approved P2 cars and speed them up, and have that be the new P1L class, which IMSA would race. Engines and bodywork free. Other constructors would be able to come in, but would only get the P1L homoligation. Not only would this let people like Dome, SMP, and HPD keep racing with their current cars (in P1L), it would easily allow a team running ACO spec P2 to move up if they wanted, and also would give IMSA teams an easier avenue to run Le Mans (just take whatever they race here, instead of needing OEM bodywork and an Am driver)."
USCR,3comup,INeedANamePlz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"I don't see anyone who would bother running both IMSA and ELMS races, but I guess it's a nice provision to have just in case. Krohn Racing, perhaps?"
USCR,3comup,iracecars,3,Thu Jul 9 23:37:21 2015 UTC,I think you could firmly call that the Krohn rule.  Though teams like RSR have expressed interest in doing the same in the past if they find funded drivers interested in it.
USCR,3comup,Bakkster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:58:15 2015 UTC,I can see the advantage for an amateur to run mostly ELMS plus a few NAEC rounds.  What I'm not sure of is why such an amateur would buy an engine that wasn't the less expensive spec engine. Though I suppose some gentlemen are impressed with the OEM support they get currently (namely ESM and MSR with HPD).
USCR,3cg5r7,August_R18,11,Tue Jul 7 17:32:27 2015 UTC,USCR just because the accessibility and race times. The TV coverage is pretty meh though and the whole current prototype situation kind of bores me.

I love seeing a good Porsche-Audi-Toyota Prototype battle, but I'd like to see more GT focus somewhere in between. Plus, like you, I do prefer a lot of TUSC tracks to WEC.

USCR,3cg5r7,unsalted-butter,3,Tue Jul 7 20:31:27 2015 UTC,I follow TUSC mostly because I am not usually awake or at home for majority of WEC events. Not to mention fox flopping around channels on most US fans.
USCR,3cg5r7,random123456789,3,Tue Jul 7 20:48:52 2015 UTC,TUSC just because it's more accessible in America and I go up to Watkins Glen every year. I also prefer American race tracks over European ones. I only really watch the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the WEC but I still like reading about the LMP1 machinery.  The WEC coverage also don't focus a whole lot on the GT classes like someone else mentioned. .  I'm coming off pretty negative about the WEC but I still think it's really cool.

USCR,3cg5r7,INeedANamePlz,2,Tue Jul 7 20:10:44 2015 UTC,I like both. I view the WEC much like the F1 and TUSC as the local flavor with its own twist like Indycar.   If money was no object I'd probably go to a WEC race ahead of a TuSC though.

USCR,3cbt7z,dirty_hooker,2,Tue Jul 7 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  It is the future.  The LMPC is based on a 10 year old LMP1 design and is due for a change.  I don't think the Watkins test was representative of the car's capabilities for several reasons.  First, I don't think the Ginetta is the car to have.  It was rushed through too quickly and is still under-developed.  Second, the drivers at Watkins struggled with the car's setup - it was too low and probably had too high of a spring rate on the car.  European tracks are very smooth and flat, and American tracks require a different setup altogether.  Third, each driver only had a hand-full of laps (20 minutes total).  Have a read of Matt McMurry's thoughts on the car in the link below.  He's driven a number of cars in the past few years and I think he has a good basis of comparison:  http://www.racer.com/imsa/item/118950-matt-mcmurry-testing-and-pondering-ginetta-s-lmp3  I am disappointed that the ACO has decided to limit the chassis manufacturers in LMP3.  It seems they really do have a death wish for small teams like BR Engineering and Wolf.  Look back to 10 years ago and there was quite a few small manufacturers.  They all got along and the racing was good, though there were certainly better cars than others.  But that's how racing is.  LMP3 is a good format and will be very popular here if they get it up to speed.  The gentleman drivers have to be faster than the GTLM cars and IMSA has to get the car to that level.  I think fans' biggest dislike of LMPC currently is the spec nature of the cars.  Having multiple manufacturers in a well controlled series will make it more attractive.  And the budget is obviously attractive to teams.  With as many cars as have been sold currently (Ginetta - 11, Ligier - 6, Adess - 3+, Riley - 1) it shows the interest is there.  IMSA just has to make a home."

At this point, what it looks like is:  2016   Prototype-current DP and P2 PC-current GTLM- GTE + some GT3 cars GTD- GT3 only   2017   New P2 cars, in either stock ACO spec, or with IMSA spec engines and bodywork PC probably still the same, but might include P3 as part of a transition.  GTLM- GTE + some GT3 cars GTD- GT3 only   2018   P2 Same as 2017 PC Might be replaced in favor of P3, but might still be in transition.  GTLM- GTE + some GT3 cars GTD- GT3 only   One alternative that I think was brought up on Radio Le Mans, was the idea of having a pro-am sub-class of P2 act as the new PC.  Trouble is, the cost of running a P2 car is so much higher than the current PC car."

USCR,3bwxn6,INeedANamePlz,6,Thu Jul 2 20:49:18 2015 UTC,Excellent. More GT cars is always better. It's the real reason I watch USCR
USCR,3bwxn6,AznTri4d,2,Fri Jul 3 04:41:58 2015 UTC,"I was pleased to see this a while back http://sportscar365.com/imsa/tusc/bmw-pursuing-gtlm-homologation-of-m6-gt3/ I saw another article that quoted someone from Lexus saying the RCF might be developed into a GTLM as well.  One can only hope.  With the new Fords, surely a 488 and I know it's not going to happen but maybe Viper Exchange could step up since Fiat is robbing all of Chrysler's money to develop Maserati models, we'll have good top level GT racing in the states again next year."
USCR,3bwxn6,thyusername,3,Fri Jul 3 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"Next year should be some pretty good GT racing, while the prototypes look to be mostly boring. I hope that if BMW gets GTE homoligation with the M6 GT3, other  manufactuers may jump on board too."
USCR,3bwxn6,TBurd01,3,Fri Jul 3 07:11:23 2015 UTC,I think Bentley is pushing to homologate the Continental GT3 for GTLM as well.
USCR,3bwxn6,ASH_03,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:32:53 2015 UTC,"I don't see the need for trying to homolgate to GT-LM specs... just run it as a GT3 program... GT-LM is effectively reserved for factory marks battle, the way it should be in my eyes..."
