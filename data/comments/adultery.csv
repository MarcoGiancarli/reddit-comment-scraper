To add to that, it's already usually harder to find a good man than it is to find a good woman, and to further add to it, you could never consider your SO's affection genuine or even significant until they completely knew who they were loving.  I would imagine your situation is a difficult one to be in. I realize you are an emotional person who desires love and respect, but you seem positioned to take the maximum amount of abuse in that sphere, and on several different levels. Just an observation."

No one is perfectly moral but infidelity is worse than most because, and these are just a few:  You are doing it to someone you supposedly love  You are doing it to someone who trusts that you will remain faithful  The pain from uncovering an affair is particularly damaging   All of that applies to a dead bedroom situation as well. Withholding sex and physical intimacy from someone you love. Doing it to someone who trusts that you will give them that physical intimacy that you crave. And the pain from a DB is very real, and very intense. If you don't believe me then browse the /r/DeadBedrooms sub for a few minutes.   Many of us are here because of DB situations. Where's the outrage on our behalf? Where are the insults and pitchforks? If I go out with my buddies and tell them I haven't had sex with my wife in over 6 months all I'll get are jokes and uncomfortable shrugs. If I tell them she cheated on me I'll get my drinks paid for for the entire night, an endless outpouring of support, people offering to set me up on dates, and endless rage and indignation aimed at her. How dare she do something so cruel?  I was cheated on in a relationship. Yeah, it hurt. But with that experience I can say that the pain of a DB is just as bad, if not worse in some ways. Where's the support for that?  Tonight I'm going to have sex with a woman who isn't my wife. It's a purely, 100% physical thing. We probably aren't even going to have anything resembling a conversation. I'm going to her house, we'll fuck for a few hours, I'll go home. This is something that makes me reviled, hated. I'm committing a terrible sin.  A few weeks ago I posted about meeting a female friend...we barely touched save for a non-intimate hug at the end. We talked for hours and I was able to tell her things that I haven't really been able to talk with my wife about lately. This, however, is perfectly okay.  So then what are relationships? Why is it okay for me to have an emotional relationship that surpasses what I get at home, but not okay for me to have a physical one? If sex is that goddamned important then why is my wife given a free pass to ignore our sex problems? If it's not so important that people can't pull out the pitchforks because our relationship went sexless by her unilateral choice, then why is it suddenly so important when I decide to have sex with a woman who isn't her?

I'm not making any assumptions, she's told me as much. I have no reason to believe otherwise.  I can do nothing, abide by my wife's wishes for sexual monogamy despite her not meeting my sexual needs/wants. This will affect our relationship as my resentment grows like a poison. Our dynamic sours and eventually we end up divorcing. This too will devastate her, as she does not want her marriage and family to fail. It's not what I want either.  I can cheat...and if the secret is found out, yes my wife will be devastated and maybe we end up divorcing. Which, if you haven't noticed, is pretty much the exact same outcome as above. However if the secret doesn't come out, then we have what we have now - I'm happy, she's happy, everything works.   Who knows, maybe the final bottom line is that we end up divorcing anyway and everyone is devastated. At least with what I'm doing now we have a shot at happiness.

adultery,3e3r6c,marriedscoundrel,2,Wed Jul 22 04:14:43 2015 UTC,"Keeping a promise doesn't entitle one to a reward. It just means you did what you said you'd do. To your first question though, you tell me. If you married, why did you promise your undying faithfulness? Was it the assumption of easy and frequent sex? Just something to consider. But these are why I think marriage is a sham and I don't want to participate in it."
adultery,3e3r6c,ecostigan,3,Wed Jul 22 04:43:48 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with any sort of reward. Rather, what is the reason for making that promise?  Let's say I'm a single guy. I can have sex with as many people as I want to. Sure, I'm single, non-committed, there's nothing wrong with that. The world is my sexual oyster.  Now I start dating a woman, and she asks me for sexual monogamy. Why should I say yes to this? Especially if she comes at me with the idea of ""I'm not obligated to have sex with you, and I may not want to have sex nearly as often as you do, nor engage in the type of sex you want."" That's not a very enticing offer.  And yet that's how it works. We enter into romantic relationships where monogamy is the default but partners don't think they have any sort of obligation to fulfill their partners sexual needs. And unfortunately the way the system works, they're right. There's no backlash for denying sex, but should the scorned partner seek it elsewhere there's plenty of backlash for the cheater.   So ultimately I agree with you - the way marriage works now it is a sham.    If you married, why did you promise your undying faithfulness? Was it the assumption of easy and frequent sex?   While dating my wife I was very clear - if you want me to be monogamous to you, there is a certain level of sex I would need in order to be happy. We had this conversation several times while dating and even in the early days of marriage, and she swore she was on the same page as me. Then she tried to change things and expected me to be on board with it, when I'd given her no reason to ever think I would be.  And a question for you - why is ""faithfulness"" measured in whether or not I put my penis in another woman or not? And what does that say about relationships in general."

adultery,3e23wc,Arcusico,7,Tue Jul 21 10:54:51 2015 UTC,"I've always had the opinion that someone who cheats from the get-go is an ass.  If that's how you roll then look for someone who is compatible.     I used to think that all cheaters were asses until I found myself in a /r/deadbeadroom situation.  Then I started to see things differently.  When I heard about something I'd ask myself what it was that brought them to that point.    For me it was over 10 years in a DB situation, but not wanting to split up kept me in the situation all while she resisted dealing with the situation.  I still would rather be with my wife than seek out an AP without her permission, but I found myself unwilling to continue with that condition so I succumbed.   I read something a marriage counselor wrote about sex-starved marriages...""If your spouse doesn't have sex with you, he/she may not have cheated on you, but they did cheat you.""  The spouse made an agreement with you that both of you would stop having sex with anyone else in exchange for only having sex with each other.  But when they stop having sex with you they've breached their side of the agreement.   This breach isn't an excuse for cheating on them and I readily admit that it is more accurately described as a rationalization.  But the damage done by a sex-denying spouse is just as real as is the emotional damage caused by cheating.  Are there better ways to deal with it?  I guess that depends on one's definition of ""better"".  I know there are different outcomes I would prefer, but that doesn't mean I can make them happen."

With all that you built?"" in that if you fess up and break up you are erasing all you have and built. So it is a catch 22. And that is the main reason a lot of people cheat, we just can't give up what we have even though it is a guilded cage. A nice shiny guilded cage with all the mod cons.

For those of us who have found ourselves seriously wanting for affection, whether it be from dead bedrooms, emotional or physical abuse, or just plain old incompatibility, most of us never thought we would even considering cheating either.  You don't expect to be in that place until you suddenly are, and for those who are suddenly on the fence, having an safe place to discuss has been quite helpful.  Many of us, myself included, have not cheated, and have the other posters to thank for that, for sharing their experiences both good and bad, and with that info we can decide what is best for ourselves.    It's never as simple as you seem to think it is, and there are plenty of reasons to not want to break up the family.  That risk is something that is real, some people take it, others don't.  As for the situation with your sister, it sounds like infidelity is a recurring theme for your BIL, and that sucks.  It sucks for her, for their kids, and for the family.

If this story is all true, (which some seems farfetched to me like cheating on his wedding day) than there is little that can be said about this guy.  Some people are just selfish, and are never intended to be in a monogamous relationship.  Now I will speak for why I cheated … it was out of necessity.  I was faithful in my marriage for 9 of the 10 years, something happened to the two of us over the course of the last 5 years in which we just became more and more distant.  I felt trapped, lived in a /r/deadbedrooms situation for over 6 months at a time, and my needs were not getting fulfilled.  I didn’t go out searching for an affair partner, but there was a moment when a good friend and I were alone and we connected (emotionally and physically).  In that moment I no longer felt unloved, ugly, or unimportant in life.  I felt like a new man and for that reason the affair went on for months.  My story did end with me leaving my wife, and I am still with the original affair partner till this day (she left her husband).  We knew that we could not hide forever in our little bubble and we wanted to experience each other.  We have been extremely happy since we left our ex-spouses, and I hope this goes on forever.  As for the rest of the people there are many reasons as to why they cheat and may not leave their spouses.  Most cheat out of necessity, there is a need not being met at home even after many pleas to their spouses whether it be physical or emotional.  Cheating sometimes is a way to get that need met somewhere else and save the marriage because people truly do love their spouses despite the fact that their needs are not completely met.  Some have affairs and stay for other reasons like children, money, security, or just the fear of being alone.  Something I have learned through my affair is to stop playing judge.  I used to point fingers at people like me and assume they are bad people.  I have learned to stop and ask, “why do they need to have an affair”?  Not all people who go down this route are bad people, and most do not wish to hurt their significant others.

She would be easily angered, wouldn't want to help around the house, and generally shoved me away emotionally, and sometimes physically. I got that sex was off the table, for whatever she was going through. Maybe it was the child, maybe it was something else that she wouldn't talk about. There were weeks when she wouldn't even sit on the same couch as me.  I tried to make things better. I gave up my hobbies and my friends to try and support her spouse any way I could. I gave everything I had into my marriage.  Seven years later, nothing had improved. I became an alcoholic, and an all-around miserable fuck. I resented my children for what I perceived to be their role in me losing my best friend along with everything else. I hated my life, and wanted nothing to more to do with it, but I was trapped with it.  I'm happy to find what I need elsewhere. Even a one night stand has made me easier to live with, and takes the weight away from everything I gave up.   A regular thing... it might make everything totally livable."

Because there are very few instances where people who want to experience the 'new' are allowed to be truthful and have it initiate a thoughtful conversation with their spouse about what is going on either in themselves or in their marriage that makes them want to cheat.   There is no real safe environment for truth in the majority of marriages. I doubt many would survive the truth - imagine if one spouse went to the other and said ""I love you but I am attracted to someone else and explore that."" Nope, that will result in punishment - either in separation or divorce (or swallow and hide your lies behind ""marriage counseling"".)  By and large, people who cheat want affairs - not divorces."

My wife doesn't look at me the same way she used to--and vice versa--not because either of us isn't attracted to the other anymore, but because there are no more secrets or surprises. My wife will never give me that look again for that moment after you meet someone, when all my jokes are working and she decides in her head, ""holy shit, I want to fuck him!""

The problem is coming clean and getting help have potentially crushing consequences compared to drug or alcohol addictions.

However, not telling my wife is another story. But I love my family, and I don't want to lose them.

And the feeling is mutual for men, who instinctively support their mate.  But that doesn't mean that we don't also crave promiscuity. Having sex with a wide variety of partners does just as much to ensure successful progeny.  And if you put the two together, you get the dark side of monogamy. If you know of a couple with a harmonious pair bond, deep down inside you know that your own offspring will also be taken care of in that situation. Jealousy, of others in successful sexual relationships, is that urge manifesting as an emotional state.  Monogamy was never forced upon humankind. It is merely a mating strategy, one of many."

I had several over the ensuing years and although my marriage ended, it was not because of the affairs but rather because of the underlying issues that led to the affairs. I'm not proud of what I did but I don't regret it either.  I started documenting my experiences in a blog a couple months ago:  http://cheaterandliar.blogspot.com/"
adultery,3e23wc,The-Pussy-Whisperer,3,Wed Jul 22 02:02:21 2015 UTC,"Because most partners don't want honesty either.    Honesty would be admitting that they value the idea of having utter control and dominion over their partner's genitals over years invested a relationship.    The chastity device fetishist are at least honest about the dynamic, but most people don't see that monogamy basically operates on the same principle.   I would wager most of the people on this board have made a good faith effort to address the desires and issues that have led them into the beds of others, and were basically ignored by their spouses.  Kinda hard to work on an aspect of a relationship where one part doesn't feel the need for any changes.    So then you have one spouse who thinks that they're pulling their weight in the relationship, when in actuality they've decided to ignore their partner's desires.  So then the issue becomes, do you tear apart a family because one aspect of the relationships isn't firing on all cylinders, or do you self help so your spouse can continue to pretend that things are fine when they're not?  So, to answer your question, usually the payout of a successful gamble is that it allows the non-cheating partner to lie to themselves about the quality of the relationship and the effort they've put into meeting their partner's needs.  When the answer to the following two questions, ""Do you want to divorce me for having different desires, and do you want to fulfill those desires?"" is ""No""...  Well, that person's just asked for option ""C"".  In your BiL case, it seems like he wasn't honest enough to admit that he wanted to be a swinger.  I don't know whether it was because he was a hypocrite and wanted one-sided monogamy or if its because he was raised with ""traditional values"" and didn't think to add ""swinging"" to his list of compatiblity criteria when he got married."

My oldest nephew was very upset about all this, because he had asked my brother in law some time ago if he had a secret, to which he answered be didn't.

This sucks, and I do think you are the victim as well. I can really relate how this kind of relationship can feel like a trap.  But how did the conversations go? I mean, if my SO told me that she NEEDED something, that it was thriving her crazy and she fears it would drive her to be a person she does not want to, I cannot imagine how we could not find a way out. And I am pretty sure wise versa.   Like we kind of had this situation, in that some of my kinks and the frequency were a little hard on her. But we found a compromise.

I don't think she'd ever actually do that, it was more to shut me up.  There wasn't going to be any compromise. Sex is clearly off the table when one of the parties is angry.  I understand that I'm no saint, but there was a serious communication breakdown. She couldn't articulate what she actually wanted from me, and still can't/won't, years later.  I stay with her because, I feel like my kids will have their lives destroyed from sheer financial hardship if I leave. If I left, I would be impoverished as well (we're not exactly rich, though we do fairly well). Finally, I'm still very fond of my wife; we laugh together, and have very engaging conversations.

But, it is a fact, and I do my best to do better.  If my children ever find out, I hope some day they forgive and understand.  ... but I don't expect them to."

I am just going like, goddammit, you should have done the right thing. The thing you would want me to do. If your life isnt working out, and you think with someone it will, you should have gone for it openly, honestly. I understand, and respect that he feared my mother wouldnt be good for me, and I respect that he thought he did right by me. But i just feel like he should have had more trust in me, let me handle some this. Tried to stay close, look after me.  Just the fact that i know for a fact that he is willing to lie, decieve and led a secret life, if it is for what considers to be right reason is some kind of barrier between us. Something which i feel may never be fixed, because how would i know if he is open with me now? How would i know if he sees the strength in me facing difficult situations together, putting the trust in me that I will try to understand and work with him? You know what i mean.  That being said, I still do respect and love my father. It is just that he lied to me as much as he did to my mother, and that he took the chance from to deal with this situation forever."

When she and i got together, we got what we wanted.  That was 13 years ago.  Happily married and trust isn't an issue - infidelity isn't that big of a deal for either one of us, regardless.  But we knew that the only reason we both cheated previously was b/c of the lack of sex/intimacy.

I don't really choose APs by the same criteria I would a life partner or hold them to the same relationship standards so I doubt I would be in anything legitimate with them, and I'm also not sure I'll be willing to enter another monogamous relationship anyway if this one fails."

adultery,3e316y,mazty,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"Because you aren't enough. And maybe that's okay.  Okay, maybe you can be ""enough"" in the sense that your partner feels fulfilled. But that doesn't mean that they'll never be attracted to another person, never be tempted. Instead of taking that in stride we get hurt and offended.   I know I'm not enough. I'm a flawed human being. We all are. I'm always striving for improvement but I'll always be an imperfect human being. But I'm okay with that. And ideally my partner would be too and would accept me for my virtues and my flaws. So in that sense it isn't about being ""enough"" but rather ""content""."
adultery,3e316y,marriedscoundrel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"Obviously being imperfect is part of being human, but surely there is a large gap between not being perfect and sleeping with other people? As you said, no one is perfect,  yet many of then have monogamous relationships. Surely being content would be accepting a partners flaws and yet feeling they satisfy you wholly. Id argue being complacent is when you'd want to have an affair/swing etc as the relationship is okay, but not enough."
adultery,3e316y,mazty,6,Wed Jul 22 09:50:37 2015 UTC,"Because many people don't think of it as ""I'm not enough"" but rather ""You're a free, independent person and if you have a connection with other people, that's great! I'm happy for you if you're happy!""  I don't own my spouse.  He's not my property.  No one person is ""enough.""  If that were the case, we wouldn't have friends.  Some people are satisfied with one person sexually, but many other people are not.  It doesn't make them bad people.  If more people were honest with themselves, they'd realize that they don't want monogamy.  Does it upset you if your partner watches porn? Or thinks some movie star is hot?  Or ever thinks about any other person besides you in a sexual way?  Because they do.  You can be upset over it or accept the fact that we're sexual beings and desire and attraction are rarely honed in on only one person forever and ever.  That's not realistic."

Your comment is very warped add you seem to suggest the majority of people aren't happy with one person when in fact it's the other way around. Do you have any proof at all about that monogamy comment? It's natural to find other people attractive. However if they actively want to sleep with them, then clearly the relationship they are in is not the right one for them as is not fulfilling."

Didn't want to waste time with counseling, divorce, etc. It's given me the freedom to do what I want now, pretty much guilt free. I do not believe SO currently has an AP. If he did, it me would give me more time to be with mine."
adultery,3e316y,Juststartedthis,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"Some people here would be happy if their SO would cheat because it would alleviate guilt and/or they want their SO to be happy with someone else.  Other people here would be pissed and feel betrayed if they found out their SO cheated.    I'm in the former.  If I found out my spouse was cheating I'd be happy because I'd feel less guilty about doing it myself, and I'd like my SO to be happy.  If someone else can make him happier than I can, then I would be completely fine with that.  I don't think he and are are very compatible but he wants to stay together for our kids.  If he were to find someone else who could fulfill him, I'd be thrilled for him.  I don't think my SO is cheating on me because he's pretty much gotten permission from me to do whatever he wants with other people, way before I ever started cheating.  I can't answer the second question as I've never ended up in a serious relationship with an AP nor would I plan to."
adultery,3e316y,ForAdulteryOnly,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"I'd be furious. I cheat because there is a lack of sex in my marriage.   If she's just having somebody else on the side, when she could have had me for all the years while we fought about it instead, I wouldn't see any point in continuing the marriage, children or no. At that point, we're actually just roommates, and should probably move on, or at least have the understanding that all our finances, etc. should be separate.  Edit: You know, I'm not really sure anymore. I'd be furious, but probably not for very long."
adultery,3e316y,amsosorry,0,Tue Jul 21 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"The answer to this can be found by having sex with a few partners outside of your relationship. If you get away with it, you will probably find that the affection and love you feel towards your primary partner hasn't changed. You still have all the history, and your life together. You have simply enjoyed fleeting sexual pleasure with another person.  Once you have experienced that dynamic, it is hard to deny your partner the same opportunity. If my wife discretely has sex with another person, and comes home to our family leaving me oblivious, I simply don't care.  In fact, I prefer it that way. I don't want to think about my wife sleeping with another man. I don't want an open relationship, where I know that she is going off to fuck somebody else. Even though on some level, it would be nice to be able to talk about some of my adventures with my nearest, best friend, on the whole, I don't want to know.  That may seem a bit weird, but it is a dynamic that I am comfortable with. I know what it is like when she has an affair. She had one very prominent emotional affair that turned physical, about 7 years ago, and it tore me up, until I, in a self destructive fugue, started having sex with escorts. That was the beginning of my own transgressions, and over time, our relationship became steady, and I accepted her past dalliances. Since then, our relationship has become far calmer and more loving. We have had a child recently, and are trying for another.  How do I know? I had my suspicions, and went through her email and social media accounts. Since then, she has had at least two more discrete affairs, and has carefully spared me the anguish of having a public crush on another man. I know this because I am still snooping on her private life now and then."

adultery,3e2sus,markmeyours,11,Tue Jul 21 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"Most people who are regulars here are from the States. If it is at all surprising that marriage is a black and white setup and cheating, for any reason, is a terrible thing, you are ignoring everything our culture screams at us all from day one.  Culture is very black and white. You meet someone. You fall in love. You get married. Happily ever after.  The divorce rate and programming of the Lifetime televsion network beg to differ.  Everyone here will tell you that adultery is not the best option. It's not the first option. It's an option, often driven by desperation. Adultery is what happens when you have a failed marriage of two people (for a multitude of reasons) and it can't be ended.  Adulterers live in the grey space fighting a cultural feeling of shame and regret over the violation of the black/white rules of marriage that is countered by finally feeling love, affection, sexuality, and desire - you know, one of the cornerstones of any healthy relationship.  So our discussions are always going to demonstrate that the cultural norm is black and white, our activities are somewhere in between, and the internal debate is on how to juggle that. How to wake up and feel good about your life when society frowns upon how you handle a fundamental human need?  None of this is about superiority. Yes, you are going to see some folks brag about getting laid. It's a confidence bluff, a bit of surprised joy, and a way to validate that ""it could be worse."" because it could.  Go spend a week reading every new person who posts on /r/deadbedrooms   See what it's like to live without sexual validation inside a prison that says ""Until death do we part.""   It's a very dark place, full of wonderful people who are just crying out in confusion, pain, and hoplessness because they are being denied a fundamental thing.   I read DB for the same reason I read Adultery - to remember how I got here, and how I never want to be a card carrying member of eithier club again. I don't read to feel better than the people who are here, I don't post to celebrate and rub my superiority in their face. I share because I understand that hurt. I understand the joy of finally knowing someone sees you in a sexual manner. I understand the pain behind both.  These friends aren't about superiority. That you see it, and not what I see, tells me more about you than them. Why do the people here make you feel inferior?"

I'm in a pretty good relationship and never had much trouble leaving when things get stale and finding someone suitable. But you mentioned desperation, which is all I see here despite a significant amount of swagger.   It's the swagger which confuses me. How can you swagger when you spend all your time begging and bargaining for crumbs and doing things that have the potential to harm so many people, yourself included.

That's totally fine for you, but ease up on the locals eh? What you see as self righteous is anything but to people inside that space. If you truly want to understand you are going to have to get past your own view of things and learn to embrace a mindset that is apparently alien to your own.  At this point though, my question becomes ""If this is all alien, why are you even bothering to look?""  The simple path is to go read other subs. I'm not saying fuck off, but... it's OK not to participate if you can't relate at all. That's far better than calling people out and attacking their differing mindset."

All the tears over a lag time between texts, the craziness about covering your ass and tips on how to pass and act normal, it's just nutty, isn't it?

Your questions about energy use are valid, from a completely abstract space. When you get down and dirty, it's not that simple. It never is.  Adultery is a LOT of work.

adultery,3dxzcm,wtfdataleakthroaway,29,Mon Jul 20 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"Zen answer: there's no point in worrying, since the leak has already happened and nothing you can do will change that.  If you've used your real name (or if the leak includes billing addresses), and if the data is published and if you have a suspicious SO, then I think there's a chance that you might be found out."
adultery,3dxzcm,spare1382,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:20 2015 UTC,My SO isn't suspicious but just the fact that my personal info could be in all that data and released is unsettling.

adultery,3dxzcm,amsosorry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, and someone is going to reverse google 37 million images (assuming an average of one image per user)?   I like those odds."
adultery,3dxzcm,amsosorry,0,Mon Jul 20 15:08:20 2015 UTC,"What are the odds someone used their profile pic from Facebook...   Honestly? If they know at all what they're doing or have half a brain? Close to nil. Even cave men know not to do that.  Many AM photos feature masks for this particular reason. Some people blur their faces, or cut them out of the frame. An image floating out there in a pile of other images is not going to be easy to identify.   (And I've never seriously thought like a cheating dirtbag until the story broke, thinking about how to cat and mouse with my SO. I feel naive but I guess that's ok).   Eh. Take very seriously the idea that we know we're bad people. We have our justifications, but most (all?) of the regulars here know that we are lying to and betraying our spouses, and jeopardizing our relationships."
adultery,3dxzcm,amsosorry,3,Mon Jul 20 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"Well, a couple of things: How likely is your SO to be aware that there was a hack? How likely are they to suspect you and then find the information, and look for you?   I think those two are going to be the biggest saviours for anyone here.   If the answer to both of those questions is 'likely', it depends on a few other factors.  How common is your name? If there are only a handful of you in the world, you're probably screwed; even if they have expired credit card information, it still has your name on it. Now, if your credit card reads 'John Smith', it won't matter, you're one John Smith among millions, even if no other John Smith cheats.  Unless your spouse has a photographic memory for credit card numbers, and/or you have a very unique name, I think you'll probably be fine.  More than anything, your SO needs the motivation and will to actually go looking, and I'm pretty sure most of them won't."
adultery,3dxzcm,amsosorry,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:56 2015 UTC,There's also the question of exactly how this information is going to go public.  Post it to a website? It'll get shut down for spreading illegal information (i.e. credit card numbers). Your SO is going to have to dig through crappy places on the internet to find full information.  I honestly doubt anyone here will get nabbed. It will take dedicated work to just obtain the data. I think the real victims here will be people who have SO's who are looking for proof for their divorce lawyers.  Those people? They're really fucked.
adultery,3dxzcm,spareredditor1,19,Mon Jul 20 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"Sort of sucks for me.  I have a unique name and used this service in the past while not married or dating anyone.... was just looking for hookups like every other dating site.... and got nothing from it.  Deleted the account but used a credit card to do so.  Now married with kids... and this is going to surface.  It's not going to be easy to talk my way out of this one, especially considering I did nothing wrong... but that is not how the SO will see it.  A few people I know created accounts on there too, but simply just to see if their SO's were on there or find people they know.  A lot of people not actually doing any cheating are going to get fucked bad on this one."

For me it feels like I'm approaching her for one reason only - you're attractive and hopefully this will lead to sex. I hate judging people based on looks and I hate the rat race. If I was sitting next to a woman in a bar or somewhere and we end up talking and things are flowing well that's one thing, but I've never really liked the cold open, as they call it.  So online is kind of a blessing and a curse. It lets you meet people based on what they present of themselves, not just their looks. I can read profiles and think ""hey, this girl seems pretty interesting!"" and strike up a conversation there. Yeah, maybe the bottom line is ""Let's have sex in the near future!"" but at least it's not so obvious as picking a woman based on her looks and hoping that in the process you find each other engaging enough to get to that point.  But I don't think any model where you put up an ad and hope for replies is going to work all that well. Mostly because these things get inundated with guys who are looking and hoping for a woman that'll read his profile and decide she wants to fuck him specifically. Or women who will put up profiles of their own and then pick him out of the dozens/hundreds of guys who will apply. Not to mention that from what I've heard AM used a lot of shady business tactics.

I would like to add that for most people out there the relationship of their parents becomes more or less  the standard in many ways. Of course, many would prefer a completely different setting, especially if the relationship wasn't a happy one, but still the small things are still our standard of ""normal"". Behaviour patterns on how to solve a conflict, how to have this kind of discussion etc.. No matter how much we want to distance from our parents, the thing is that it's the only long term relationship we've ever seen up that close. We know tons of different relationship settings from movies, books and our friends, but we've barely experienced alternative small, boring patterns up close, so our parent's way of doing things still becomes the default in many ways.  Uprooting your childrenseems to be the greater evil now, but please keep in mind that the influence of your behaviour won't stop once they're grown up. Your behaviour now will be their default patterns in their marriages. So they might try to have a happier marriage live, they will try not to marry an alcoholic etc. But what will happen once their spouse lets themself go or they drift apart etc, when they start to feel unhappy in the marriage for a much less obvious reason? Do you think they will leave to become happy or stick for their children's sake as well? Who will copy the behaviour just as well.. It's not just abuse patterns which pass along the generations.  If you teach your children that it's not the parent's happiness that matters they will become just as unhappy adults."

He really got into the idea of me having Erotic chat with other guys. I set up an AM account strictly for that purpose and he was involved. Read all the messages and again it worked for a while.  He suddenly got jealous of the chat so I deleted the am and the throwaway email and stopped it all.  Our sex life continued to deteriorate until it was less than  1/10th what it was before.  I was torn and needed more.  The problem had become not only was sex infrequent,  he was regularly rejecting me.  I suspected an affair. I begged. I asked him to go to a Dr to see if it was a physical issue and he refused. I initiated every single day and even day got rejected. His rejection got more and more mean.  I finally gave up. I was grieving the loss of intimacy and his personality began to change in other areas as well. He no longer was interested in the same things I was. He wouldn't do anything with me. He had a strong relationship with the remote and he seemed angry with me all the time.   The more I tried to figure it out the more angry he became.  After an especially mean rejection, I needed something. I wasn't ready to end my marriage but I needed someone to talk to that could relate.  I found myself back on AM.   This was not something I ever wanted or intended.  I have found a side of myself I never knew existed. I still love him but I am slowly learning that we aren't the same people we were when we fell in love.  I don't know if we will make it and I do feel guilt and shame for what I've done... sometimes. Other times I really enjoy being a naughty girl.   I got a little off topic but I guess I felt the need to share."

adultery,3dyxw1,ph1shtaco,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:01 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of glad you asked this because I had a similar question and I'm curious to see answers.  I have a good relationship with my SO, other than sex, and it has been improving lately, because of my decision to find an AP.  SO and I parent really well together, have a lot of laughs, mainly have great communication and want the same things for our future together.  We love each other pretty madly.  However, I am really no longer attracted to him.  Sex is a big, heavy problem for us. He's afraid I'm going to leave him, either for someone else, or because he can't/won't try to f*ck me, but he doesn't seem to want to figure his stuff out.  This is our happy medium for now.    I was with my AP this weekend and we haven't progressed to sex yet (it kind of feels like we're dating?? Lots of good making out and fun stuff but time/place has been troublesome).  I was so horned up when I got home that I told SO he needed to make me come, and he did - three times in the next twelve hours.  We were both very happy.  Whether he suspected something or not I don't know.  I had been with AP until 2:30 am and as I said, I came home hot and needing relief.  I was happy that it was with my SO, and would have been happy if it was with my AP."

They have always know I have a voracious sexual drive and they work very hard to fill it and keep it exciting.

Since I'm not seeking to become his SO, I'm actually feel more stable that he attaches well with the SO. I think that's the whole reason why I exclude single guys"

I didn't seek an affair, but when I was presented with the opportunity, I gave in to temptation. I felt some guilt in the beginning, but rarely do now. What can I say? I like giving in.   My relationship is unaffected since my SO always comes first. My AP knows this and we agree our SO's take priority. We both maintain stable home lives which we have no desire to leave, and we give each other the fun, flirty, sexy, secret escape from real life we all need from time to time - best of both worlds and no need to change it."

adultery,3dyxw1,outofoptions33,6,Mon Jul 20 17:53:48 2015 UTC,I always thought cheating was about the worst thing you could do to your spouse. I had no idea how big an impact being sexless could be.  It changed not only how I felt about him and our relationship but how I felt about me.  It is just as bad to freeze your spouse out.  I would almost rather he cheat.  At least that I could somewhat understand.

adultery,3dyxw1,theadulteress,4,Tue Jul 21 07:10:51 2015 UTC,I think it improves our relationship because I am no longer shitty and frustrated with him. I don't feel guilty really. Feeling sexless is worse because it affects your self-confidence.

adultery,3e0ffb,jamaicaplain9999,5,Tue Jul 21 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"A couple important data points about the hack, and an armchair analysis...   First, the people at Ashley Madison think they have a good idea who it is.  Reading through the pastebin in question, the hacker has a feud with Trevor Sykes, the CTO of Avid, but he has a positive relationship with Mark Steele, who joined the company in April (https://www.linkedin.com/in/markrsteele).  That should narrow the possible hackers down to people you can count on a hand.  Additionally, the feud most likely existed before April. If I were the hacker in question, I would burn my hard drives instantly.  You've got information on there that could destroy the lives of 37 million people, mostly men, who are not accustomed to following the rules.  Unless your server logs are perfect, and unless you cannot possibly be found via your pastebins and server logs, then if YOUR NAME comes out as the hacker somehow, either via an arrest or via someone else figuring out who you are, then you suddenly have 37 million people (none of whom are good at following rules) with a strong motivation to MURDER YOU IN COLD BLOOD.  Yes, I mean the kind of murder you that involves coming to your house silently at 4 a.m. with something sharp.  No, I am not threatening to kill the hacker myself.  But many, many someone elses will DEFINITELY have the idea. This goes the same for anyone with the bright idea of creating a blackmail-type web site who charges money for searching in a purportedly leaked database.  Threatening to ruin peoples' home lives has a way of making some people look for something sharp.  Again, I am not threatening the blackmailer personally, but many many someones WILL threaten the blackmailer personally.   All in all, I think it's the hacker who's going to be losing the most sleep tonight, and perhaps for the rest of his life.  It's one thing to doxx one person.  It's another to doxx 37 million.  How can you be sure that one of those 37 million won't find YOU?"

One thing is for sure, when it's out there, it'll stay out there. So, another person finds the data. Sifts through it and finds you (while doing a google search of your name and city name for example). Then, he contacts you and asks for money.  How to avoid this?

There's no point in leaving AM for the purpose of defending against this hack, because it's already happened. If you think AM is still going to be lax about security after this incident, then you have a choice to make there.  AM claims (for what it's worth) that they didn't actually have credit card information except for the last 4 digits of the card for verification purposes. They say they use a third party for their CC processing.  So it really comes down to whether you believe them or not. I'm going to wait and see, for now."

The hackers have violated the privacy of millions of people. Okay, so you disagree with what complete strangers were doing online (something that isn't illegal by the way)--you should just be appalled that the privacy was violated.

I don't want to divorce, and it would be pretty hard on the kids. I made the choice that, as long as the secret holds, has the least negative consequences. And actually things are pretty good - family is intact, wife and kids are happy, I'm happy. Just, as long as the secret holds.

She's entitled to truth in her marriage and should be able to decide what she will and will not live with.  If divorce is the worst possible outcome, she won't choose it. And she'll be responsible for her choice to stay.  Maybe it would change things between you and you could have the open marriage you've both requested but denied to each other.  Or maybe she'll try harder to be whatever it is that you need.   OR.... maybe she'll decide that sharing her life and fidelity with a serial cheater is in fact the worst thing.  But she's a human being and should be allowed to make that decision for herself.   I'm interested in why you feel she's not entitled to the truth about her own marriage. And why you feel justified in denying her that,  and why you think you can act as though your self serving decisions are somehow an act of compassion.   Have you legitimately sold yourself on that idea?  I'm looking for actual answers here.  Why shouldn't she be able to decide if divorce is in fact worse than what you're doing? And if it is. .. and she is not the kind of person that will want to hurt your kids unless it's the best alternative,  why not tell her what she had a right to know?"
adultery,3dyzhk,Diet-CokeFiend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"I've thought about coming clean so to speak, just telling her that this is what I'm doing, she can choose to live with it or not. And man, this would make my life so much easier. No more secrets, no more lies, no more having to cover things up. That would be awesome. But it would come at the expense of her peace of mind.  We've talked about open relationship. And while she can see and appreciate all the reasons why it would help our situation she just can't resolve herself with it. Despite the reality of our situation the traditional idea of what a marriage should be is too deeply ingrained in her head. Married men just don't have sex with women who aren't their wives. Period. What would the neighbors say? I've told her that I can have sexual relationships with other women while remaining emotionally committed to her, and in reality I'm already doing it, and even though she can say she believes I can, ultimately she's just going to undermine herself.  A long time ago, before our DB started, we were talking about our sexlife and she said something to the effect of ""If we ever get to that point and you feel the need to step outside our relationship, make sure I never find out about it."" I don't take this as permission to do what I'm doing, but rather a sign that she would honestly just rather not know. While you personally may prefer 100% honesty in your relationships, not everyone is the same and I believe my wife is of the ignorance is bliss camp.  For my APs, since our relationships are casual they often joke about the possibility that I might be seeing other women. I've had serious discussions with a few of them about it as well. They've said something similar - if I am seeing other women, they simply just don't want to know about it. They recognize that the possibility is there, but knowing the truth only complicates the situation.   So I don't know. Sometimes I still do have the ""well, just tell her and let her deal with it"" internal struggle, but at the same time I can recognize how that's going to do more harm than good. Even if she decides to stay now it forces her to try and deal with it mentally, and we both know she kind of can't. So let me absorb it by keeping the secret, and if it ever comes out then I can just be the bad guy cheater asshole. I can handle that."

adultery,3dyzhk,veliza-raptor,2,Tue Jul 21 06:08:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, let's talk about being forced into things.  I told my wife repeatedly while dating that I was 100% opposed to a sexless relationship. Having a healthy and active sex life was very important to me. She swore she was on the same page and that we'd never go sexless. Then it happened anyway. And I tried all the recommended fixes - candlelit baths and backrubs, taking on more duties around the house, pouring out my heart and soul about how important this was to me...nothing worked. Even the promise she made about us never going sexless she claimed to not remember ever making (she later admitted that she did remember, but just said in response ""things change"").   I did give her the chance to do this out in the open - when all else failed I proposed an open relationship as a last resort. I outlined how I would do it in a manner that wouldn't negatively affect our family. I made my case for why it should happen. I offered her as much or as little transparency as she wanted. She listened and admitted that she couldn't logically counter any of my proposals. However, she was still going to say no. She didn't like it, and she didn't have to say yes. If she said no and I did it anyway I'd be a cheater and society would hate me no matter what. She was absolutely right about that. From her POV, our little ""problem"" would be solved if I'd just be okay with the infrequent, uninspired sex she did offer. Actually, wanting anything more than that made me a pervert and a freak. Keep in mind that at no point have I ever given her any reason to think that I'd be okay with the sexless relationship, and actually had been very vocal and up-front from the start that I wouldn't be.  So at that point I had a couple of shitty options at my disposal. I could slink away, try to ""accept"" our new sexless dynamic despite never having wanted it and having done everything in my power to avoid it. The bitterness and resentment would continue to grow, spreading throughout our relationship like a poison until we eventually split. I could initiate divorce then and there...sure, go out and have all the sex with women I wanted ""the right way"". Get a sweet bachelors pad with a revolving door for the ladies. Except I'd have to nuke my family to do it. From my wife's POV she's a pretty good wife and mother, and excepting the sex thing she's right. But hey, none of that matters because she wasn't willing to open her legs as often and enthusiastically as I want her to. And hey kids, sorry you can't have both parents around...daddy needs to have his knob polished sometimes, and mommy isn't willing to do it. I'd still be a villain over divorcing my wife and leaving a perfectly good family over a lack of sex. I could defiantly tell her I was going to do it anyway, let her struggle with the idea of her husband going out and wining and dining women, having hot sex with them, and then somehow coming home and being content with her in her same pair of frumpy pajamas.   Then there's the choice I made - go out and do what I need to do to be happy. And it would be lovely if my wife could handle the truth and I could be honest, but she can't so oh well. I have the sex life I want, she doesn't have to deal with issues she can't, the family is still together. It works. You may not like the finer details of how it works, but it works.   I don't expect you to understand the choice I made. I wouldn't have understood either. I didn't until I had to make it. The moral brigade constantly hits me with - you should be honest! You should just divorce her! From my POV that's nuking the relationship, and I have no idea why I'd want to do that when everything right now is fine. It's not ideal, but it's much better than a nuked relationship, which is something neither of us want. So no, I don't always believe that honesty is the best policy. Sometimes it isn't. We actually live in a society that thrives on lies and dishonesty. Some people hate this one because it strikes a personal nerve.  And I'm not trying to justify anything. I made my choices and I'm personally comfortable with that. You may or may not understand, but honestly I don't care. If you're looking for perspective or whatever I'm happy to provide it but I don't expect to change your mind. My wife was right when she said I'd be hated for becoming a cheater, which gave her the power to say no to everything I tried - from improving our sex life, to trying to find my own happiness elsewhere. When it got to that point where I had to choose between forcing myself into a life I didn't want because of issues she didn't want to deal with, and making a choice that would make me hated socially but personally happy...well, it was a fairly easy choice."

It seems like she is emotionally blackmailing you. Making false promises, not respecting your needs and you having obviously spent alot of effort trying to make it work not working with you and going: ""though luck, society is on my side. so just deal with it, i dont care""  I actually have to say i grew a pretty intense dislike for her reading your text.  However, I would still consider leaving her if I were you. You seem emotionally troubled, and I wager that you maybe are not really happy with the situation. I mean its not like you would nuke a family because you get your knob polished. You would seperate your family because your needs are obviously not valued, there is no compassion and understanding, and you are left alone to struggle. This is not what a loving relationsship should be, and you should not risk demonizing yourself to your children when you are eventually busted, but should go the straight path to your wife ""You are not interested in my needs, you obviously do not love me anymore, this is not a relationsship i wanna be in."" And explain this to your children when they are old enough to understand. I do not feel like this is about the sex, this is about the emotional support every person should recieve from their partner."

The only thing hard on your children would be the notion that people will just use them and not be commited. You're wasting her time being married to you. And she deserves the truth. She deserves to know who she sleeps with at night; just gross. In fact, I wanna do to you what vets do to dogs when the owners don't want breeding: cutting off the dog's penis.  You don't deserve a wife, you don't deserve your children (who will by then see what a disgusting person you are), and you don't deserve to be a husband. You don't value commitment, honesty, and family values. You don't love your wife, and that's just a fact. You have to hide it because you know it's wrong, yet you try to justify.

What I had to learn over the past few years is that some people just don't have much of an interest in sex. They don't get the same things mentally or emotionally from it that others do. And there's nothing wrong with that, that's just who they are. You can't assume that every couple ""in love"" should just want to be physical with each other.   Honestly, it sounds like both of you should probably be looking at a divorce if neither can provide the other with what they need.

Let me take your analogues and talk about them a little:  Theft - I'm of the opinion that it can be justified. If you're starving, and you are given the choice between violating your moral principles and dying, what do you choose? I'll steal, thanks. I'm not dying for those principles. We can wax philosophical about the society and circumstances that put me in a position that I need to steal to survive, but at the end of the day, it doesn't much matter: I take those measures, for those ends.  Racism - The racist doesn't know he's an awful person. The white supremacist sees other races as sub-human. He doesn't need justification; from his point of view, his position should be readily obvious to anyone with half a brain. The fundamental schism is that the racist doesn't believe he's doing anything wrong, and I'm pretty sure I know I'm doing something wrong.  Okay, now...  Infidelity - Let's not mince words. I take the notes in the sidebar to heart. This is a catastrophic risk. This is not 'right'. Whatever 'right' means, I'm pretty sure infidelity doesn't live in that column.  So, why do it? Because it makes my home life better. I don't put pressure on my wife for things she doesn't want to do. I don't resent my children because I see them as the cause for the lack of sex and intimacy in my life. A void gets filled, people get along. I get that people think that sex is just some triviality, an afterthought, a dessert after a healthy dinner.  It isn't.  It's what I need to feel loved, by someone. If I transfer that responsibility on someone who doesn't actually feel that way, the juxtaposition makes me an easier person to live with. If that makes me an awful person, or a scumbag, or whatever you want to call it (and it does), so be it. Fine, I'm not a whole human, but we aren't all so lucky.    So, what do I get out of this place? Is it a useless echo chamber to reinforce my diseased opinions on sexuality and relationships? Is it just a handy repository for tips and tricks?   No. Here, I find emotional support. Community. People who aren't going to judge me for my circumstances or my needs. It isn't unlike other support communities, like /r/nofap or the red pill, or even /r/insomnia. I don't like two out of three of those, but I don't go there to run my mouth about it, because everyone needs their communities. Even assholes.  And that's why it's so laughable when people come here, and say ""You guys are a bunch of fucking douchebags"" as though we didn't already know."

There are other stories I considered not worth sharing but maybe I should....like the guy who couldn't stay hard long enough to put on a condom or the guy who came in less than 2 minutes and was done... didn't want to help me finish at all.   The hours of sex includes the foreplay... oral, edging, etc as well as the kissing, cuddling, fondling during recovery time.  And keep in mind that in this lifestyle there is the NRE and I believe that coupled an excited partner who is thrilled to be with you helps with recovery time.  An eager blow job to get things going again can go a long way.  I don't know about others but overnights are few and far between for me.  Usually I only have a couple of hours in the middle of the day so nothing you said would be a deterrent.   I also think once a day would be above average."

Some visits with my AP turn out to be epic events in the sex department, and other times, not so much. But while it is essentially a physical relationship, the sex is a small part of the enjoyment. To me, it's about the entire experience of seeing my AP. The three or four hours I get with him every few weeks is spent mostly talking and enjoying each other's company. The sex is fun and important, but certainly not the only expectation."
adultery,3dvz7k,szeegirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"My AP has an average libido, and it's totally fine. We can usually only meet once a week at best and then only for about 30-40 min. My libido is probably bigger than his, but it's a non-issue because we have a lot of family obligations that prevent us from seeing each other too often. He has a dead bedroom situation at home, so the only sex he gets is with me pretty much, and, though i know he'd like to be with me more often, he is pretty ok with once a week. My situation at home is different in that my husband is high libido and we have sex about every other day. (My reasons for cheating are not about lack of sex, obviously) So i am not so desperate for sex, though i do wish I could see my ap more often and fuck him on a bed, instead of in my mini van, lol. We go for quality over quantity.  Also, i didn't go looking for an affair- my ap and i fell in love and there's pretty much nothing we can do about it, except try really hard not to let it hurt our families, or our partners, who will never, never understand.   At any rate, i dont think you have to be a HL person to live this lifestyle- it all depends on what you are in it for, and what your (potential) ap is in it for. Good luck :)"

If they do know how to torrent and go looking, they were already suspicious and you'd have probably been caught anyway.

He first asks for a show of hands of all the people who had sex almost every night. A modest number of hands were raised. He then asks, how many had sex once a week? This time a larger number of hands were raised. John then asks how many had sex once or twice a month? Again a few hands were raised. After John polled his group several more times he noticed one guy sitting off to the side with this huge beaming grin on his face. John noticed that the guy never raised his hand, so he asked him how often he had sex.

Since he moved I didn't take long to move on. 2,3 and 4 were back to back since 2 and 3 were so disapponting.  4 was a couple months the first round.  5 was one and done so just a couple weeks til 6.  6 and 7 overlapped.  6 was a month. 7 about the same before 8.  I was still looking until I met 8.   8 was 3 months.   I took a few weeks after 8 to decide I needed someone to help get my mind off of him.  Met up with 7 again and it was still lackluster. Kept looking.  9, 10 and 11 aren't really worth the story. Reconnected with 4 about 4.5 months ago and feeling like I found the right partner finally."

I just went through 13 days without seeing my AP due to him having personal issues  (death, sickness, family issues). I guess it was so bad because I was used to seeing him 2-3 times a week (met end of may). I found myself very depressed,  angry, sad....in other words I went through all the stages of grieving in a matter of less than 2 weeks. I also found myself considering he was just stringing me along.....almost to the point of telling him to kiss my ass and that he wasn't the only man with a dick in this world. But...I couldn't find myself to say those things because I am sooooooo sexually whipped. We finally managed to meet yesterday. All of my fears were put to rest, thankfully. He reassured me he is completely crazy about me....and you know how you can just tell when someone is telling the truth?  The passion was very apparent in his words and eyes. So, I wish I could tell you it's going to be easy.....it wasn't for me. Terrible, terrible....one thing you have going for you is that you don't see your AP as frequently,  so you are kind of used to waiting. We do communicate through email about 4-10 times a day. He always tells me good morning and good night. Having no communication would just make a difficult situation even more difficult. Please, let us know how you are doing. There is a lot of great support on this Forum. Wish I could help you more... the sex after waiting is incredibly awesome though!!!"

He was aroused before he turned it on and he didn't seem to pay attention to it at all which I thought was strange since he liked having it on.    The sex itself just felt like he was trying to play out his own porno.   I did see him several times after this.  It just never felt natural with him.

adultery,3dr3ws,pinkpeeps,8,Sat Jul 18 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear it. It sucks. Been there, or mighty close to it.  For what it's worth, it may be helpful to keep in mind that now you're seeing more clearly his poor relationship and coping skills that are his part in making his marriage so crummy (and would negatively impact your relationship together if you to did make a real go if it.) To wit:   you offered to step back out of concern for him as well as self protection for yourself. That he didn't honor that is a sign that he cares more about what he wants than what's good for you. Think on that. he promised his mother? Please. He's a grown man and he makes his own choices--and evidently cannot be accountable for them. WTF kind of appeal-to-authority gambit is saying that he promised his mother? He's telling you it's guilt--but you yourself understand the deep complexity of ending a marriage. There's a lot more going on than just guilt, and he's not being honest with you about that, either.   I don't mean to pile on--I know you're hurting--just saying that this awful time can be very clarifying in its own way, and help you get past the withdrawal symptoms from the stuff that was good, meaningful, affirming to you.  Along those lines, I found that the best thing I could take from the whole experience was affirmation that the good stuff from my affair really truly was important to me and a necessary part of my life--that included sex and affection but also quite a few other things--and have been working to make sure that they are or can be part of my life going forward. That may be a helpful perspective for you too.  Good luck."

Annoyed with the details of separating, kids, house, etc., but heartbroken? No. Not like this.  I'm sorry you're going through this. The heart wants what the heart wants.

So I tried single guys telling them I was not interested in any committed relationship since I'm post divorce and don't have the time right now.

There was another from AM who would regularly text but last night we finally met up and we smoked and I got really high (bad idea) but it was such a good high.

What do you like? What does your partner like? The more honest and open you are with your own selves and each other the more fun the talk will be. If you don't know, ask. Open up to him about what you like even if you aren't sure he's into it. Have fun."

'I want you filling me up and stretching me out'  -'I've been thinking about how you're going to fuck me all day' or.

I usually follow it with 'I know you want to. I can see how bad you want to cum. Tell me and I'll let you' then he usually mutters how bad he wants to and I'll 'let' him cum 'I want you to cum for me and fill my pussy up. Make it all dirty with your cum'   He also likes it when I say 'please'. 'Please let me suck your cock' 'please let me taste your cum'.   It might be too much for some, but it literally drives AP wild. I get more detailed and dirtier depending on what we're doing.

adultery,3dmlu7,ForAdulteryOnly,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"Great story.  I'm in the same boat you and your wife were in - pretty much together for the kid and we were never friends either.  Now that the sex/desire has faded, there's nothing there.    I do have a question for you though.  Seeing as your relationship with AP has been much about sex, are you scared that will skew your view on the relationship?  I mean, sex and NRE are so powerful.  I'm scared if I left SO, I'd do the same thing with the next person because I am not someone who waits a certain period before having sex.  If it feels right, I do it.  I'm afraid I'll get into another situation where I let the sex cloud my judgement and jump into another relationship with someone I might not be super compatible with or develop friendship with.  And the friendship part is so important because the passionate, sexy, excited feelings will fade."
adultery,3dmlu7,mysecretlife369,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"AP and I were worried at first about the same thing. She is fully aware of my situation and knows that me and SO were basically only physical and no emotional bond.   So although AP and I do have sex, it is not every time we meet up. We do lunch dates, and just hang, watch tv or something. We def have the emotional bond and connection right off the bat. The sex is just a bonus with AP. I guess I have a what all relationships should have now; A strong emotional and mental connection plus great physical desire toward one another.   We also both agreed to always be open and honest no matter what, and we are learning to communicate with each other. A lot of AP's who end up together always have issues with trusting one another (I can understand why), due to how most relationships with AP start (deceit, lies to SO). So the AP knows what you are capable of. But we both decided that we trust each other fully and we haven't doubted each other yet!   Anyways, feel free to ask me any questions on anyone's mind. I am all ears."

Like you stated, the phone call was a big mind fuck that brought everything to a crashing reality. I responded back that she needs to make sure that this is what she wants and until that time, we should not see each our so she can think about it.   That attraction feeling is such a rush, and it is very tempting. But maybe the down time will make it clearer if I want to go through it again."

I may go many days without finding a suitable ad, sometimes it's three in a day). Once you've got her replying, it's much more a matter of your flirtation skills (mine need some work) than it is a pure numbers game. Where I live, they'll receive 200+ responses, so it's not luck.    Sometimes they get cold feet and filter themselves out, one has turned into a good friend (who won't ever become an AP).

Doesn't help I'm a statistically under-desired ethnicity either..  That said, I accidentally did an experiment of my own, I had originally included no picture, no comment on ethnicity and no ""I'm looking for an afaiir"" in my Tinder profile as I was still tweaking it.  I had a barrage of likes.  I updated - the likes actually went away!  So, dick may be abundant, but I guess well educated, well travelled and professionally successful males (that I suppose you mold into your dream man) - are not."

Yet I feel that If I say something, she will start questioning me too.   I did ask her if she was texting any male friends. As I could see on the phone bill over 3000 text and it's only half way thru the month.   She said she had a guy friend but that was it.   Just makes me think of it even more now!

I don't really feel guilty about what I'm doing. I only feel guilty about not feeling guilty. I know what got me here and the adultery thing didn't just happen. I got fed up with being forced to beg for the smallest crumbs of affection and attention. I actually don't feel mad at my wife right now. I'm just frustrated with the whole situation and that we couldn't overcome it together despite some previous attempts to do so. Disappointed maybe? Yeah, I guess. Maybe that's a good adjective. But if I found out what got us here was another man you can bet I would do everything in my power to fucking destroy the dude's life. For what it's worth, my AP's marriage is about to end and she is about to pull the trigger on it (according to her) so I don't feel like I'm the cause her marriage is failing. I'm fully cognizant of the hypocrisy but it helps me sleep at night. I think rationality goes out the window in most affairs."

I'm disappointed that while we get along, we have no affection between us anymore.  I never imagined myself cheating.  I never imagined anything other than being happily ever after with him.  So if I found out he was having an affair and that got us here (especially since we had a very active sex life until he stopped it), I'd be pissed beyond belief.  Not at the AP... at HIM.  I only feel guilty that I don't feel guilty about it.  I realize it is hypocritical but I don't really care.   If he started having an affair NOW, I am sure it would still bother me but I think I would respond differently that if it was what started this chain of events."

Could my wife be telling some other man how fucking lame I am right now? I don't judge either type of woman because I'm certainly no better but it's kinda funny when I think about it.

It does creep back in on occasion, but I try to be constantly mindful of what I'm feeling & quashing the emotions that bring me down. We have to let go of what we can't control, not easy & always a wip for me.     And don't forget the kids, they can pick up subtle cues. I want my kids to be confident individuals who are caring & resilient, another reason for me to try & kick downer emotions to the curb. I try not to sit in the silent toxic mess, I usually take the kids out for walks, biking, parks, ice cream parlors, coffee shop.

adultery,3dnbja,marriedscoundrel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:22 2015 UTC,Not suggesting it was you at all.  I'm the kind of person that likes to keep a diary of my thoughts (can't really do that).  I like to talk about the exciting things happening in my life with friends.  So this seemed like a safe place to do that.

adultery,3dnbja,bblaze420,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"AP4 sounds amazing. I just love the way you describe every detail in such clarity. Sounds like you got what you needed.  Def sucks that he has pulled away, but can't blame him if he serious is trying to work on his marriage.   Although I have used that excuse to get out of it with an AP before, not that this is the case, just saying.   Either way, you will find what you are looking for. Just keep positive!  Also, are you looking just for physical? Or are you searching an emotional connection as well? Or would you rather not have feelings involved?"
adultery,3dnbja,bblaze420,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:28 2015 UTC,Working on the marriage only lasted a few months.  He messaged me and we've been seeing each other every 1-2 weeks since March.  Sex keeps getting better.  I figured I'd get to that later. :)

adultery,3di6mz,amsosorry,2,Thu Jul 16 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think your experience might be coloured by the fact that you have a good relationship with your spouse, and that an escort is paid to like you.  With your SO, you have an emotional connection and experience.  With an escort, you have an emotional detachment, and a wallet.  If you lack that connection with your SO, other people might seem as satisfying or better."
adultery,3di6mz,ForAdulteryOnly,5,Thu Jul 16 15:43:16 2015 UTC,Not really. It just makes me question my compatibility with my SO and whether he will ever be happy with me and vice versa.     edit: too many words
adultery,3di6mz,laureywilliams,2,Thu Jul 16 15:10:37 2015 UTC,Same
adultery,3di6mz,jtaylor52,6,Thu Jul 16 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely, because sex was always the biggest stress on our marriage, her lack of desire vs my huge libido.  Now, with my libido in check, I don't find myself constantly in anticipation of whether or not we are going to have sex on a particular night (I wanted at least 4-5 times a week, she reluctantly does 1).  With that weight lifted off my shoulders, I can still enjoy sex with my wife, but also, since it's not #1 in my mind, I can enjoy my TIME with my wife.  Our marriage has improved 10-fold since I started seeking sexual satisfaction outside of it."
adultery,3di6mz,whatnow7654,3,Thu Jul 16 15:29:30 2015 UTC,I find that I am more present and engaged when I am home after being out with the GF. I know this is common as I have read it elsewhere. It must be the guilt and perhaps some over compensation for other indiscretions.
adultery,3di6mz,Shereallyknows,2,Thu Jul 16 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I am starting out with my first AP (havent had sex yet) but U can say that I am sure the feelings you would have with an AP with whom you have an emotional AND physical connection would be night and day different than just some quick lay with an escort. I think I am less upset with my spouse because I am happier, but it is because of my AP and not focusing on how shitty things are at home. I agree that my AP just highlights the things missing with my spouse. Again I think it is the connection that is formed that differs from an escort situation."
adultery,3di6mz,itwasntplanned,3,Thu Jul 16 15:35:41 2015 UTC,In the beginning it did.  But as time passed it exposed my marriage for what it was.  When I started up I thought there was a few cracks on the ceiling.... But the house is crumbling down.
adultery,3di6mz,cheathrowaway69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:03:25 2015 UTC,"Sex with a cheap escort (depends on how you define cheap) will probably be worse than with any half enthusiastic spouse.  For an escort it is like a production line: you can produce $10k cars and make $200 profit each or you can make $100k cars and make $30k profit each. You are going to put more effort into the $100k car and make less of them.  I have seen $800 escorts and $100 escorts, night and day. Although there is a personality factor and a mood factor, generally speaking you get what you pay for.    Going back to your question, Escorts and APs have made me appreciate more the good qualities in my SO and highlighted the lacking qualities in my SO."

adultery,3dk9c5,NotHisMrs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of things for myself.   I never chase. I do enough chasing my husband at home. If you're not going to make time to talk to me then oh well. I'll move on to someone who will.   I never make someone feel bad for not having time for me or being busy. It just backfires anyway. And if they really want to, they will make time for you.   I try not to expect anything more than what my AP might expect of me. Expectations usually end badly anyway.   I don't second guess myself when it comes to men. I used to think that I was just being too harsh or whatever. Maybe even a bitch but when I did give those men a chance I just ended up regretting it anyway.   I try not to have too many rules for the person I'm seeing. I mean I do expect a certain amount of attention, sure, but if said person doesn't meet my needs or I'm not meeting theirs (which I try to make sure I am) what's the point of doing it.   So far I'm really happy but I think I'm really lucky and I met my perfect match. We are on the same wavelength so much of the time it's weird."

I just tell SO that we ended up staying out for drinks afterward.   One caviat: TURN OFF your phone GPS and location services.

Sometimes people are more attractive in person (and sometimes they're less attractive).  If you meet and you're not attracted to her then you just tell her (either in person there, or via however you've been communicating) that you appreciate her taking the time out to meet with you but you didn't feel any chemistry and you wish her the best and hope she finds what she's looking for.

adultery,3djayh,liguy8719,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"I don't agree.  Maybe it's better for you, but there are crazy people out there who will be offended by a blunt rejection, and by blunt I don't even mean rude.  These crazies can fuck up your life.  Threats, harassment etc. They may not be the norm but if you play this game long enough you WILL run into them.  And on top of that, it could be a serious hit to their self esteem.  You can say, ""we didn't have chemistry"" but any halfwit can read between the lines.  When you disappear, it can leave some doubt as to why.    Alternatively, you could make up an excuse like ""working things out with SO"" or ""getting more serious with another AP"" but if you met on AM and she sees your profile is still active, she'll be even more hurt/pissed."

But even if I did, and got together with my AP, the fact that he wants kids of his own might be a deal-breaker anyway. As a woman in my very early 40's (although I'm very fit and told I look in my 30's), the chances of me being able to have a couple more kids would be pretty slim. AP is also 40, but his bio clock isn't a factor, since he's a guy."

adultery,3dg15n,threwmeawai,5,Thu Jul 16 18:49:18 2015 UTC,"Chemistry doesn't mean hotness. Chemistry for me is something that comes from The connection that may or may not be there once you actually meet the prospective AP. I've either felt it or not.  Part of attraction is physical. I have reviewed photos from guys online- attractive, mostly, but something about them doesn't make me want them more. I can't explain it. It's part of the entire package of sexy attraction that I need to make intimacy possible and enjoyable."

I think my issue is that for most chemical reactions to take place the elements need to interact. I don't like that I have been guilty in the past of  rejecting some potential AP partners by putting too much emphasis on appearances and not giving things a chance.

adultery,3dg15n,liguy8719,3,Thu Jul 16 13:01:16 2015 UTC,"Chemistry was intense with my AP. I actually had no idea what he looked like, met on AM started chatting, something about him drew me in. Conversation was fluid, almost intuitive. I knew he was going to be different from my normal type of guy, so I was prepared for that. Felt immediately comfortable with him, knew I could let myself be vulnerable, let go of control. Fast forward, I have done more with him and I'm not talking sexually in the past 6 months then with SO over years. I find him fascinating, and he teaches me things. Respect is scary thing for me, makes it hard to cut the cord. I'm all in when that happens."
adultery,3dg15n,docholidayNJ,3,Thu Jul 16 16:07:09 2015 UTC,My AP and I have fantastic chemistry. The closer we got the stronger it did as well. It's to the point of just smelling his skin turns my insides on fire! He can lightly touch my arm and nerves are awake and ready to go. I find chemistry to be more on a physical/primal level. The way my body responds to him is completely out of my control and I love it!
adultery,3dg15n,livesomelife,2,Thu Jul 16 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"chemistry isn't about passing the eye test.  It's sitting down and chatting and seeing if there is some kind of connection.  I've met a couple of APs that I found very attractive, enjoyed sexting etc.  Then we meet and it was just dull.  Nothing there.  It was like going to a business meeting, even after all the sexting we did.  The chemistry just wasn't there."
adultery,3dg15n,livesomelife,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"In my admittedly limited experience using AM only, the women are far more selective than the men (because they can be.)  ""We don't have any chemistry"" from her just looking at your pictures is shorthand for ""I'm out of your league"" (at least on AM)   While ""We don't have any chemistry"" after meeting in person is shorthand for ""We don't have any chemistry.""    As for more success by meeting and spending time with potential partners and let the ""chemistry"" evolve over time.  Sure that could work but look at it from her perspective.  She could meet a guy whose pictures alone get her worked up or she could take a chance on a guy whose pictures don't impress her.  Who would you agree to meet?  All part of an interesting journey, isn't it."
adultery,3dg15n,trashandthrow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:23:48 2015 UTC,Very insightful!  I do appreciate (and envy) that women have the opportunity to be more selective. I can also understand that when women (or men) use that shorthand as mentioned in the first context that they are usually attempting to be polite. But I wish we could get rid of that first use you mentioned. Using that shorthand in the second sense makes much more sense and I agree with you on that. And it is indeed an interesting journey.

The current CEO was stepping down and met with the new hire privately in his office, where he handed him three numbered envelopes.  ""Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve,"" the first CEO said.  Things went along pretty smoothly for the first six month, but then sales took a downturn and the new CEO began catching a lot of heat. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, ""Blame your predecessor.""  The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.  About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product malfunctions. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO opened the second envelope. The message read, ""Reorganize."" This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.  After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on hard times. The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope.  The message said, ""Prepare three envelopes."""

As the guy who 'never would cheat' and finally did, though, please let me offer this:  Just remember that, once you cross the line into acting on your adulterous impulses, you cannot go back.  Obviously you can stop having affairs... But what you can't undo is the impact to your psyche of getting it in with another woman. I thought I totally had it together, but I know that the first time I saw my SO after the first tryst with my AP was ... well, interesting. This will change you - perhaps only in small ways, but changes nonetheless.  You also may not be able to easily undo some of the unintended trappings from having an affair... getting caught and SO finding out, potential health consequences, pregnancies, etc.  Not telling you not to do it... just telling you to think it through before leaping into the waters.

Then dress for the women you want to attract. Finally work on your conversation skills. Women will seek you out.   Long answer: I was and am in a similar situation as you. Dead bed room and some mountains I still wanted to climb. I made the choice to if I wanted a beautiful woman I could not be a slob. I started working out but lost most the weight with diet. 70 pounds of fat in 8 months. I was really skinny. So I started to lift heavy and eat more meats. I gained 35 pounds of muscle over 10 months. I did all this before even talking to another woman. Once I got 18 inch arms and nice cloths that fit my new body. Women talk to me.

adultery,3dfvd8,alter_ego_1,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:02 2015 UTC,It's great that you want to chip in.  Why be uncomfortable talking about it.  My AP doesn't have the resources I have and she has mentioned it several times.  She sometimes picks up a lunch tab but otherwise it's me.  And I don't have one problem with it.  If he's like me then he is okay with it and honored to be with you.   I also have separate accounts and thankful for it.  My SO and I lived together before marriage and having separate accounts worked well and we just continued it.  So my experience doesn't compare to all others.
adultery,3dfvd8,striker1869,2,Thu Jul 16 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same situation. Not discussed, but I wouldn't expect her to pay for it. In my area, decent hotels (Hampton Inn up to the Hilton) run roughly $175-$225 per night. I've decided that if we are going to have a full evening and overnight, I'm going to get us a room at a nice hotel. If it's a quick late-night meet up or just for a few hours, I'm going to scale back and hit something like a Comfort Inn or something. If you were okay with this kind of idea, it'd be AWESOME of you to casually bring it up with your AP. Just say, hey, I know these places are pricey. If we only have a couple hours together, let's just get somewhere with a bed and a locking door and it's not going to matter what's on the walls.  Secondly, if you were to take the initiative and book/pay for the room, it'd be fantastic (in my opinion). Do keep in mind, though, that under the assumption that I'm paying, I have a ""method"" set up to go undetected (different credit card at a different bank that is funded and paid off by an OLD PayPal account that my SO doesn't even think to look at). If you were to assume more risk in paying, he may have a concern. Maybe leave him some cash in his pants pocket while he's cleaning up in the restroom."

After our initial drinks date and parking lot kiss, I had to cancel on my AP twice before we actually got to meet up for hot sex. And now I'd say our planned meetings only happen like 50% of the time due to unforeseen family stuff."

It's also something that is almost impossible to bring up early on.  There is no respectful way that I've come up with to get it out there.  I did put in my AM profile I can arrange to host but that's as far as I took it.  In your situation, the fact he's paying and not mentioning it at all tells me he's ok with this.  NotHisMrs does have the perfect way to bring it up though."

This should open up conversation about his willingness to always pay and may help you identify other, less expensive rendezvous spots."

With that being said,  a room at a nice hotel where I live only runs about $125 at the most....hell, I'd pay for a room to meet him EVERY day if he could.

I can afford to front the cost of the affair.  However, my concern is having the account withdrawals noticed by my SO.  I go to great lengths to disguise it.  But the more I meet my AP, the harder it is to make it go unnoticed.    In the end, the less money that flows out of my account, the less my SO is going to notice or ask questions.  I feel like, for the reason of risk mitigation alone, affair partners should offer to split expenses as much as possible."

Usually if there is nothing beyond the minimum required information the profile is either another man checking out the competition, or a fake designed to get you to spend credits.  These are almost always a guaranteed no response or an immediate move to chat.  Chat eats credits like candy.  As already mentioned find something in the profile and or public picture you can connect with and start a conversation.  I had several mails from women who saw I had looked at their profiles that provided an opportunity to also communicate but as  /r/PandaPomPom said these are sometimes auto generated to get you spend credits.  AM will drain your account if you let it.  OTOH my AP came from one of the profiles I looked at who contacted me and we went from there.  I have a public photo that does not show my face and most of my private ones don't either. A genuine smile that lights up your eyes and face, a good sense of humor and knowing how to craft witty, grammatically correct, full sentence correspondence will go a long way.  Good luck."

adultery,3d7x8m,itwasntplanned,4,Tue Jul 14 09:49:57 2015 UTC,"You sound a little bit like me (except that I started this lifestyle when my husband lost his sex drive). I used to be a church-going Catholic girl who thought of sex as something shameful, even as my sex drive raged uncontrollably. I was also raised to be shy, reserved, and submissive and deferential to my husband, even though my personality was naturally alpha and independent. When my SO stopped having sex with me, I tried to suppress my libido and force myself to believe that this was a good thing because having sex for any reason other than procreation was something to be ashamed of. It wasn't until I drifted away from religion that I broke out of my shell and decided that I could no longer deny expression to my true nature. I accepted and celebrated the fact that I was a very sexual person and a dominant, strong-willed individual. I haven't looked back and have never been happier (though my husband basically knows about my lifestyle, so the guilt factor isn't there).  I do, however, keep my sex life and my everyday life completely compartmentalized from each other. At home, I'm the loving mother and breadwinner who dutifully supports a household (I make a lot more money than my SO, which probably gives me the leverage to have my needs met in whatever way I see fit). At work, I'm the hard-working and ambitious VP who heads a division with dozens of employees. But when I'm in the bedroom with my APs, I'm a horny freak who is DTF and ready to try almost anything. Everyone who knows me from my first two roles has no idea about my third role and I'm probably the last person they would expect to be in this lifestyle. And I intend to keep it that way."

My confidence comes from that and not from fucking new guys.  It doesn't hurt when they are hot.  It is a nice ego boost but I do realize that is temporary.

I may have just met him but knew his real name, where he worked and where he lived before we ever met.  I will meet someone anonymously in a public location but if we choose to move things forward, I want to know a real name and more detail about who they really are.  I am very forthcoming with my expectations before we ever meet. Since that first meet, I've never had any sexual contact with an AP at the first meet.

adultery,3d6k95,feisty1432,4,Mon Jul 13 22:35:29 2015 UTC,I can totally relate. If APs wife is just something he mentions it's easier to deal with for me. But!  I went through the drive through coffee place and there she was. I didn't know she worked there. She took my order after I stammered it out. I was frozen when she touched my hand taking the change. Seeing her in person made me feel so fucking guilty.

Sometimes, it's easier to emphasize the negative when with an AP. It's not really a lie, it's just not fully accurate.  I think the real problem is when one party starts to take some things as an indication that the other one will leave their SO. I usually emphasize how I am happy with my SO to keep drama on simmer."

When I saw him a part of me felt terrible knowing how much damage I could do to him if we ever got caught. He is a great kid so I'd never forgive myself if I was the cause of his family's dissolution.   Another part of me felt bad because seeing him in person made the gulf between my AP's real life and the fantasy of us being together seem much more tangible and impossibly wide.   It was a sobering dose of reality.

adultery,3d6k95,partyanimal792,2,Tue Jul 14 01:25:58 2015 UTC,I inadvertently did this to my AP.  I snapped a risky selfie in the car and my glasses caught my SO's arm.  And that was the most he's seen of him as we both actively try to keep references to our SOs limited. Why? For exactly this reason.   In order to cope I subconsciously lie to myself that my SO is in a loveless and sexless marriage. Rationally I know that if that were the case they would be separated.

When I learned of my husband's mistresses I kept saying the same thing (mostly in my head) I'm a person. I'M A PERSON!  I thought they must have some false impression of me (they did,  he lied about me and our home life) because if they knew the truth,  if they saw us laugh together,  or saw me caring for our kids,  or sobbing as I stared at him for hours through the middle of the night...grieving the loss of who I knew him to be.....maybe they would stop.   Maybe they'd never ever do it to anyone again.   I have interacted with two of the four.  One of them was young.  She had already attempted suicide and just really struggled with herself in a lot of ways.  She believed him....  Until I was unexpectedly on the phone with full knowledge that she had slept with my husband.   She was scared, she cried, she apologized over and over. I'm a nurturer by nature and somehow felt for her in that moment. I knew he was a cheater for a while.  She was just learning that he lied about me and also had another mistress at the same time.  She is capable of empathy. Had she known the truth,  she would not have been with him.  She suddenly saw me as a person, and her decency overrode her selfishness.   The other one. ....I sent her an email.  I asked her how she could do this to another woman?  And told her I understood how she could love him. ..Because I did.  So much.  I tried to make her see me as a person.  But she never did.  She then stalked me on reddit and knew about our sex life and that he had been lying about his home life. She didn't care. She read about our attempt to heal. ..she didn't care.    They were still in it.  She knew they were both playing games with me, that he was lying to me. ..and she kept it up.  She saw my humanity and didn't care.   She learned he had been cheating on her the whole time with the other one. ..she still wanted him.   How sad to be so broken,  so void of empathy, so lacking in standards or self respect.  I wish her nothing but hell and pain and hope that she experiences betrayal so bad that it makes her want to fall asleep and never wake up. I wasn't full of hate before. Another side effect of his infidelity.   The other one? I had hope for her.  Saddly she has chosen to continue selling herself short,  and taking part in the horror of destroying other women's hearts.  I continue to hope that decency will win sometimes.  That mistakes will be turned away from. That family will be cherished and not risked.   I don't agree with what you all do here.  But I felt weepy to see that some of you still have compassion inside of yourselves.  It was nice."

There is no unspoken Sisterhood of Cherishing the Family. He didn't truly make an attempt to heal your relationship. He continued to lie about you and cheat on you with mutiple APs.

You have only 2 posts in 5 months and this is one of them?  You felt that strongly about defending the role of mistress?  Further, I think most people would agree that there is a universal expectation amoung decent human beings that we don't willingly hurt one another.

The thing with their regular chatting too is they delete if you don't choose to save the text. Also he could just use his regular snapchat instead of logging on and off and just choose to delete your conversation when needed.  2: Use a fake texting app like textfree. He can download the app, login, and see what you sent and then reply and delete the app when he's done. This way he can go to check messages when he can and there will be no trace once he's done if the app is deleted. This can be done with snap chat or kik if they are apps he doesn't normally have so his SO doesn't see them and get suspicious.   3: along with these there is always just using an alt reddit account or email that he can open in a private browser on his phone/computer and then read and respond before closing the page."

Aside from that - if your gut is telling you that a woman wants to have sex with you, she probably doesn't want to have sex with you.

I find myself jealous of a married man's wife. Which is SO ABSURD. But I feel what I feel. And it's because I fucking love him to pieces and want him all for myself, but I can't have him. He belongs to a woman who's controlling and has no idea the caliber of man she has at her fingertips. If I had him, I'd love him and take care of him every day. He's amazing. And he goes to bed every night with her... And sometimes that kills me inside. He wants her more than he wants me, and that's how it's supposed to be. But it hurts.   That's what happens when we love someone who loves someone else. It's normal to feel jealous in this situation, as I've learned. Just don't let that jealousy ruin a good thing between you.

I can't imagine being in bed with an AP and he casually says, oh by the way, I have a great night planned with SO.

We also spend a great deal of time outside of the bedroom where we just talk and share our lives. AP says (I know, grain of salt) that there's no one else in his life that he can talk to or share his feelings or run ideas by. We get together for sex and then we also get together for conversation at another point during the day. We just sit and talk and kiss and just... enjoy each other.

The shortest affair (fling?) lasted just one meeting and she stopped replying to my messages. The handful of remaining affairs lasted anywhere from a few weeks to a few months and most were ended by my partner due to lack of chemistry or they decided they still love their partners or other reasons that were never articulated to me.

She admitted that she couldn't logically defeat my arguments but she didn't like it and had no reason to say yes. If I did it anyway I'd be a cheater and automatically the bad guy.   At that point something inside of me just soft-snapped. I had to ask myself why I wouldn't pursue sex with other women, intentionally keep myself miserable to keep her from facing a harsh reality she simply didn't want to deal with. I decided to do what I had to, to make myself happy."
adultery,3cykr4,ForAdulteryOnly,2,Mon Jul 13 04:17:36 2015 UTC,"I think for me, I'm just an extremely sexual person who likes variety combined with feeling completely unemotionally attached to my SO.  I've even had an open-ish/poly relationship with my husband and I'm still cheating.  He's basically given me some permission to fuck other people (within guidelines), it just wasn't enough freedom for me.  I want to fuck whomever I want whenever I want.  It's selfish and I'm trying to figure out why I want that.  No sexual abuse as a kid, no fucked up relationships in the past. Totally stable upbringing and my SO is actually great.  It isn't an addiction, per se, because I still function at work and at home but it feels a bit like a compulsion.  Like I can't help but want to fuck other people.  My therapist feels like I'm just poly/sexual by nature and that I should accept it rather than fight it.  Sometimes I feel that way, other times I feel like there's got to be something WRONG with me to not be happy with compromising - from the outside my SO has been more than fair with me."
adultery,3cykr4,OnlyYouCanStopMe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:44:12 2015 UTC,What are your SOs guidelines that you're having difficulty adhering to? Does he know that you're not adhering to them?
adultery,3cykr4,ForAdulteryOnly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"No, he doesn't know I'm not adhering to them, that's why I'm on here and not r/polyamory right now...  He wants us to be ""emotionally exclusive, but sexually non-monogamous"" and he also wants to be involved in my outside sexual escapades - so either present when I'm fucking other people, or know who, when, where, what, etc.    I don't want to be emotionally exclusive. Besides just really liking sex and connecting with people sexually, one of the reasons I want to have sex with other people is the emotional connection I get.  My biggest issue in my marriage is feeling like he is completely emotionally unavailable to me.  I get a lot of emotional connection from my outside relationships and if I were to cut that part out, I would feel like I was starving for it.    It sounds reasonable from the outside that he would want to be there for the sex or involved in some way...but some of my sexual bucket list things don't involve him...most of them actually.  Some of them could but being a cougar or training as a domme and dominating men, for example, aren't things he could be involved in (at least not the way I want to do them - and he's pretty vanilla).    He's more than fair... I'm just selfish and want free reign to do whatever I want.  He wouldn't be okay with what I'm doing right now (with my AP's) because he doesn't know them, they're married to other people who don't know they're cheating, etc.  The world is pretty black and white to him most of the time.  There are things you do and things you don't do and rules you follow.  I'm the opposite. To me, rules are meant to be bent and sometimes broken...and when someone tells me not to do something, I want to do it much more.  Immature maybe, but it's how I've always felt."
adultery,3cykr4,dyingontheinside2015,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"The moment that pushed me over the edge was when I was sitting in a bar with a woman whom I'd met on online and would go on to become my first AP. She leaned over and told me how much she wanted to fuck me. That was the first time I had felt desired, really desired, since before I got married and never with my wife. I had the best sex of my life that night. Having sex with women that are totally into it/me is a nice change of pace from my wife."

I had the actions of my wife (well, touching on me) and the words of her desiring me, but I just never felt that RAW passion about it. I feel like I could go on a rant about the intricacies and talk about how's it's really just an intangible feeling that is nearly impossible to explain, but you just know it when you feel it. And then someone would completely agree while another has no clue what I'm talking about. lol It's interesting. I will say this, something I've found lately is that we do what we want. Now, that sounds like an a-hole thing to say, but the only difference is our motivation behind it. Some are motivated by beliefs (some call that 'fear'), others are motivated by not wanting the drama that a breakup/discovery can cause (fear again?), others don't want to change because, let's face it, change can be scary and what if ""the other side"" (having to hide, or getting caught and splitting up) is just so much uncharted territory and it's really ""not that bad"" right now that you just remain there (laziness?). It's just interesting that 1 person doesn't usually cause someone else to change that much, but enough of those ""1 persons"" and someone will show a ton of change."

It's turned into a sexual banquet after I lost the fat, gained muscle, dress better and found out how to seduce women. By seduce I mean make them weak in the knees seduced.

adultery,3cykr4,szeegirl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:24:15 2015 UTC,"40/F here. SO always had a lower sex drive than me, but about 10 years ago, it tailed off altogether. We started to fight a lot and grew distant from each other. My sex drive stayed strong, though I initially had no intention of cheating or leaving him (SO and I both grew up in strict catholic families, and i still believed in it then). I started going to the gym as an outlet for my frustration and developed a strong interest in fitness and weight training. Lost weight and toned up my figure over the next couple of years. Simultaneously began re-evaluating my life and my beliefs. Started getting attention from guys. By the time I hit my breaking point, I had pretty much abandoned my religious beliefs, so I thought fuck it, i'm getting mine. Since then, i've had 8 APs and a bunch of ONSs. The first time I had sex with my first AP (after a gap of about 3 years of celibacy) was more memorable than my wedding night. Harsh but true.   SO and I are like roommates now. We stay together for the kids and for appearances. I might leave him when our youngest goes off to college. We'll see. He pretty much knows that I cheat and doesn't seem to care much (though we've never discussed it). I still stay discreet because I don't want the kids or my APs' SOs to find out."

No one wants to be accused of cheating when they aren't actually cheating (especially after working 12 hours.)  Had a massive crush on a friend from work. I left the company for unrelated reasons but we kept in touch. Went alone to a dinner party he was hosting. Was feeling pretty ""Fuck it"" about the situation. Had epic sex.

adultery,3cy6me,Pickle_Slinger,4,Sat Jul 11 21:09:08 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm sorry you're going through this situation.  Most of us here are a little damaged, but we don't want to hurt other people.  Your situation is highly unusual because you work with this individual.  Most us do not know the spouses of our AP's and they are merely abstractions.  You are not an abstraction and he knows exactly what he's done to you.  Here's where it gets blurry - for right or wrong, your SO and your co-worker are mourning the end of their relationship.  A clean break is extremely difficult.  Especially when neither party was anticipating the break up.  So it's not surprising they could be taking some time to get past it.  Though he is unwittingly hurting you by continuing the communication, it's unlikely that is his intent.    That said, he's severely broken your trust - twice.    Here's what I would do if I were in your shoes.  Talk to him again.  Calmly let him know that you're aware of their continued communication.  Let him know you're OK with it if they're just saying goodbye to the relationship.  But also let him know that he broke your trust, again, and that he is to never contact your SO ... ever.     I have to trust him with my life at work,   I can only surmise you have a dangerous job (first responder, military, etc) and team work is essential.  If this is the case, I also think it's fair to ask him why you should trust him to have your back in a life threatening situation.  Unless he explains that to your satisfaction, you may consider talking to HR / your superiors / whatever about his transfer.    Normally, I'm not one for work place drama or revenge.  But if I'm reading your post correctly, this is about your life as well.  So this needs to be confronted.  You need to know the people you depend on are going to have your back when it counts."
adultery,3cy6me,DrinkWarmBeer,2,Sat Jul 11 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I am in Law Enforcement, so that is why this situation is highly unusual. It is almost as if my brother has violated my marriage.   I think I will calmly inform him that I am aware. I won't trust that he will never contact her, but I must at least let him know that I'm aware.   I'm still on the fence about what to do about work. I don't want to make any major changes just yet, but I may have to at some point if I can no longer handle it."

Having a dude come tell me not to go bang his wife would be nothing but an ego boost to me.   I guess you could ask to fuck his wife? She hot? Maybe decide on an open relationship? Figure out what you want and what helps you the most. Does confronting him help you in some way? If so do it, if not ignore him. Do you want to stay with your wife? Then forgive and go open, or pretend you can trust her to not do it/ignore it. Shit only matters if you decide it matters. We're all masters of our own realities."
adultery,3cy6me,Shereallyknows,4,Sun Jul 12 08:35:31 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'm not understanding. Are you having an issue with your wife having an affair?  Then you should be talking to her, not her AP. she's the one that needs to cut it off if that's the result you're looking for.   Sure, him being a co-worker makes it awkward as hell. But you need to maintain a working relationship (or alternatively, be prepared for a lot of drama and possibly finding another job). You can tell him to stay out of your life, but apparently it didn't work before, what makes you think it will work now?    If you're ok with her going outside the marriage, then you need to accept this and move on. Comes with the territory."
adultery,3cy6me,GotnoVoodoo,2,Sat Jul 11 22:36:41 2015 UTC,What are you hoping to gain from a conversation with him? Are you wanting him to know how you feel? I think it would be a waste of time. Focus on rebuilding your relationship with your wife.  Did you ever find out why your wife cheated? I think that would start the dialogue on how to improve things between you and her.

We (women) in general don't cheat with a guy because he's better looking.  We cheat with a guy we have a connection with, who listens to us, makes us feel attractive.  I'd say this guy is a huge threat.  It also sounds like you don't give your wife much credit (she's too naive to know what flirting is?!)  If your main concern is to save yourself from getting caught in a future potential affair, your best bet is to let this go.  What good would you do by putting adultery on her radar?  You might end up pushing her into his arms (she already confides in him about your relationship) but you'll definitely get her thinking about affairs in general which means it will be in the back of her mind when you're trying to start something up with someone else."

They need structure, and schedule and it is very beneficial for them to have both mom and dad in one household if you can make that possible. Work on fixing things with your wife, the mother of your child. Don't think about sleeping with other women. Picture if you were having a daughter... would you want her husband to one day be writing what you are writing here?"
adultery,3cx2ue,myinsideart,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:13:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, there's a lot of advice here, but it really depends on what you REALLY want. Do you want a marriage that's open? or just one where each cheat but no one questions the other? Do you WANT to both be monogamous? It SEEMS like what you want is to create a 'get out of cheating-jail free' card, right now, to use later. If that's the case, it's hard to help, cuz we don't know your wife. She pregnant which can be a shit-storm on emotions and all kinds of stuff. I would suggest talking about it. You did read the texts, so starting off with offering that info up, could be a good way to open communication. Bottom line, if you don't talk about it (which is way scarier and harder of an idea, than simply cheating) then you're not going to be open to change/fix/adapt. We can all give advice, but truly, you know her better than we do, and YOU'RE taking the risk, you need to take it, but do so in a way that is YOU. More women love men for them being THEM than for being a conglomeration of ppl from the interwebz  ;)."

Bad news, there was some fantasizing type language that implies she's not being as innocent about this as I presumed (you were all right and I was wrong).

Is he a big guy? You've read her texts? You needed to find out what she'd told him? If you confront her about this, pull up her texts, your marriage might die, and at the very least it would be extremely painful for you and your wife. The marriage license you filed with the agency lists you, your children, but only one significant other. You need to make sure your wife doesn't accept this guy's offer in favour of yours. First one to talk gets to continue this marriage with a clear conscience. If you don't talk, your shit will just be fucked up."

Wait and watch for a better opportunity to present itself. Maybe after she has a particularly public and good time with her friend you can tell her that you really are happy she's got a good friend to talk to and don't want her ever to think you are threatened by it. You are happy the two of you can be so honest about thigns with each other vs. having to hide the fact taht she's got a mail friend.  Also, discard any notion of looks being the only reason a guy is a ""threat,"" that's a very male thing. If he makes her feel an emotional thing you aren't, he's a threat. Given your desired outcome, that's not a bad thing."
adultery,3cvaeu,StraightlacedSortOf,2,Sat Jul 11 01:49:30 2015 UTC,"Your story is remarkably similar to mine, conservative, wanting more out of life and needing new sexual experiences. I jumped into AM about 6mo ago. I've had two AP's, and chatted with numerous women in kik. I can say one thing you have going for you is that you seem like a normal guy, from what I've heard and read is the selection of decent regular guys who will treat a girl with respect but still give them a good bang are few and far between.   So some AM pointers I've picked up, u can find a lot of good tips about making a great profile all over the Internet. Put some effort into it, don't just click the basic checklist. Also make sure you have a pic, women get to be choosy and no pic means they will probably skip over u.   You don't have to be that flirty when just doing the initial msg. Something as basic as ""Good morning (nameofchick)! I read your profile, you're incredibly sexy and seem like someone I'd love to get to know better. Please check me out and if you'd like to chat you can contact me @email or kik"". Has worked for me to get to at least move to the next phase quite a few times.   One thing that I've found super helpful after you start chatting is ask about what turns her on or what kind of fantasies she has then you give her yours. It's usually a turn on for you and her... Or you'll find out they are total freaks and u can see yourself out.  Last thing, a lot of women want more than just a fuck buddy, so make sure you're clear that you aren't looking for a relationship.   Hope this helps! Good luck."

adultery,3cvaeu,dfwbbwgallooking,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:39:12 2015 UTC,Private picture is fine.  If a woman is interested from reading your profile then they will request your picture key.   Conservative gut next door normal is hard to find on AM.   Once your start chatting and you want to meet don't tell her that you have to check with your wife.  You need to be able to schedule meetings easily so work that out. I had a guy tell me that he had to check with his wife if he had the evening free. I told him not to bother.

adultery,3cvaeu,myinsideart,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:18:14 2015 UTC,"Good two-shoes? Careful, you're going to get a lot of flak from 'theRedPill' lol. Sarcasm aside, I understand you. I'm actually a natural at flirting....only I don't know when I do it. My suggestion is play up your personality traits and OWN WHO YOU ARE. Slightly shy nerd? Who cares, stop cowering and just own it and shrug off what ppl say you ""need"" to be. You're fairly attractive and fit, so you fit into the giant pool of ""doesn't make me want to run away"" category. That's good, but what's better: DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR LOOKS. Yes there are some women who only care about that (or else 'Magic Mike' wouldn't exist) but far more are the women who care about WHO you are. You don't have to be some macho, hollywood, rich, snob for women to notice you. Be. Your-Self. Yes, that sounds cliched, but the key is, you don't have a lot of leverage. You're, probably, going to have to be open, to a degree, about your 'situation' so faking all kinds of other things, as in personality, may get you more tail, but ultimately, you're going to burn a lot of bridges. And, sooner or later, you're going to meet someone that you wished you were honest in the first place with. Back to flirting, there's as many 'kinds' as you can think of. Making women laugh is great, so if you've got that talent, USE IT. Being a little artistic and articulating words like a writer can be good. Being nice, but not some doormat, is good. Have your opinions but be, at least somewhat, open to others opinions also. You're trying to do something that's really taboo in our culture, so you'd better not be too strict with 'beliefs' in anything. Oh, and if you have trouble with women knowing what you think/feel, tell them. Yes, it's hard the first few times, but doing it more makes it feel far more natural and easy to simply say ""I really think you're pretty"". Or ""you wanna go get some coffee/drink tonight?"" Remember, in the end, they're humans too, and they're just as complex as you are. I know, this all sounds far easier than it is. Many have said that getting and having an AP is a marathon, not a sprint."

adultery,3cvaeu,xray777,0,Mon Jul 13 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"/r/theredpill.  Summary: Most women are sexually repulsed by goody-two shoes men.  They adore jerkboys.  Society has convinced most men and women that the opposite is the case.  We have very similar stories.  I had one girl go ga-ga over me in my first 25 years of life and that was IT.  And she left me after a year together for.....you guessed it....a jerkboy.  I checked all of her ""great guy"" boxes except for the most important one....the tingles box.  You basically have two choices.  Learn how men and women REALLY tick and be successful in the social/sexual sphere or continue to believe the synthetic feminized ""reality"" that what really turns a woman on is a compliant nice guy.  Its just not true.  For the few who enjoy corrupting an innocent an inexperienced guy....they've got a waiting list a mile long.  Meanwhile, half the housewives on your street find themselves daydreaming about the jerkboys they threw away every ounce of dignity for in college and they loved it at the deepest level of their being."
adultery,3cvaeu,TrollingPerv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:59:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I should clarify what I mean by goody two-shoes. It's not that I'm seen as being too nice or submissive or a pushover. Not at all, actually. It's that I'm seen as being excessively serious and 'moral', if that makes any sense (emphasis on 'seen as'; obviously I can't be that moral if I'm posting here and seriously considering stepping out). A couple of my wife's friends have actually told her that they find me a little intimidating because I look so serious and reserved all the time. I can actually be quite assertive and even 'alpha' within that vein. For example, I've never had so much as a sip of alcohol in my life and the only drug I've ever done was the occasional blunt in high school. I've been in situations where I was pressured to drink or try other drugs, but I made it clear that I had no interest in doing so and that I wouldn't be persuaded or coerced into it. With my wife, we've established a dynamic in which she defers to me on most matters and I generally win out when we disagree on a decision, which is what I expect (from a guy's perspective, one positive consequence of having a conservative upbringing is that women are generally expected to be submissive to their husbands and men are generally expected to be the leaders of their households). Behind closed doors, I'm jovial, friendly, and considerate with my wife, but she knows when I mean business. When it comes to our sex life, I'm the dominant one and my wife rarely ever says no when I want to have sex (though I try to be considerate and I don't initiate when I know that she's sick or having a bad day). She's never tried to make anything off-limits in the bedroom or refused to give me a blowjob or anything like that.  My problem is that I don't know how to channel that into developing a way with (other) women, so to speak. I'm pretty sure I've been in casual conversations with women at bars and parties during business trips and such where they've been attracted to me and wanted me to make a move, but I just have no idea how to take that next step and capitalize (perhaps if I drank, my inhibitions would be lowered to the extent that I could seal the deal). I usually end up chatting them up a little bit and ending the conversation abruptly because I don't want to embarrass myself. When I find a woman to be absolutely drop-dead gorgeous to the extent that I'm intimidated by her, I simply avoid interaction with her and I try to be as terse and formal as possible when I do have to interact with her. If anything, they probably think I'm a dry asshole. So I don't think I suffer from 'nice guy' syndrome. I think straightlaced and excessively serious is a more accurate description."

If the woman we are supposed to love and care for has to tell us what to do, it brings he subconscious feelings of being a failure to those we love. And the worst part, it creates a cycle that only gets worse with each gripe or argument.  Too the ladies who question this. Next time you go to preach or yell at your husband or son. Watch his eyes. If he looks away and down, it is the failure and embarrasment in life he is feeling."

adultery,3cjody,probite,3,Wed Jul 8 14:37:56 2015 UTC,"Women are attracted to macho men and not attracted to men who act like women (as most do in our society).    Its not about manipulating women any more than a woman putting on makeup is manipulating men.  She's accenting her feminine qualities that make her attractive to men.....and men who accentuate their masculine qualities are more attractive to women.  Is Don Draper vs. Pete Campbell from Mad Men.  Pete was a creep, Don was a catch.  A TON of red pill truth is in Mad Men....which is extremely interesting because most of the writers were women.  They were writing about the traits they find viscerally attractive in a man, and Don Draper is 100% what Red Pill is about."

You have to take some time and really look at your entire life, how you operate day to day, etc. Then you will see what you can improve upon.

adultery,3cjody,probite,3,Wed Jul 8 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"I'll throw in my opinion. So I found out about trp about a year ago. As a woman, and one that had formerly been in near abusive (like seriously abusive) relationships, trp just made my skin crawl. I dot know how long this is going to be so bear with me.   I've changed my mind about trp recently. I have read all its many subs an awful lot over the last year.  I think once you get past the hate, and when you get past the way guys talk to each other ( harsh almost cruel, but meant to be motivating) you start to see it for what it is. It's self improvement with no hand holding. I don't believe in awalt, I think these guys like me had a hard time with picking someone to love, so they pick wrong and ignore signs that people are shitty. Trp is a crash course in standing up for yourself. You know the whole' fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me' ? Trp says ' get fooled even once and you are stupid, but get over it and never let it happen the second time'. There's a big sense of being responsible for your self. Don't pity yourself, fix it.   So if you can look past the hate, and there is so much I never dare post there even with a throwaway. There is a lot of good messages.   I'm a woman, I'm not devious and irresponsible. I'm not backstabbing and looking to jump ship to something always better. I don't want to be take care of. And ye I know what sub this is, but this is not a men vs woman on who's the biggest cheat. It's funny, I'm actually the single ap and met him when he was briefly single, never met her, and really only want discreet sex every now and then. I've never really done anything like this and if not for the chemistry probably never would. I've never even been the cheater myself except for one time in high school when I got cheated on.   So don't take it like all women are evil. Do pick and choose some of the core messages. Workout, keep in shape, don't be a spineless creepy idiot. Get off the video games and do what you said you will. Side note, I resented my ex a lot because I did all the housework while he played games, except when he wanted sex. He promised and promised he would help but never did unless he wanted something, and if he didn't get it he would whine and throw a fit. Rp is so right, that shit is not sexy.  I never got a sense of security at all, never felt he cared, the sex was great, but boring at the same time. A lot of the time I also felt like I was his mom, ad trp does teach you how not to fall into that trap.   Sorry I'm a bit scattered. I'm trying to do about three things at the same time here and I'm on mobile so I might have lost track.   Ignore the all women are cheating sluts ' field reports'  and read the less angry posts. Trp is actually changing a bit to become far less angry, and way more useful. I just wish the women's sub made half as much sense but all they care about is being good housewives."

And I'm not even married, so I have far less to lose than my APs. Yeah, I know it can be thrilling (and for men, having sex with a married woman in her martial bed is the ultimate notch in their belt), but there are just way too many risks. It can also be a mindfuck for the AP to have sex while looking at pictures of her and her husband together, pictures of their children, their children's toys, etc. I remember reading a story in which a married woman had her AP in her room and while he was having sex with her doggy-style, she started crying uncontrollably because she looked up and saw a picture of her husband. If having sex with someone's SO is playing with fire, then doing it in their home is like juggling ten live flamethrowers while walking a tightrope over the mouth of a simmering volcano."

Doesn't really matter what that something else is, or what the reasoning behind it might be. I know the situation is not identical, but I try to treat meeting up the same as if I made plans with a friend or family member, or my SO when we were dating. That person is going to be my priority, and I expect them to make me a priority too, for the duration of our time together. Yes, sometimes an emergency will come up, or it somehow becomes too risky, but that should be a one-off, not something that happens six times in a row. If you had a friend who made it clear they didn't value your time, would you keep trying to get together with them? I know I wouldn't.  The only times I've cancelled plans and not immediately rescheduled for the near future (within a week of the original plans), it was because I didn't particularly care about someone or want to meet up with them. If people cancel on me without a good reason and clear future plans, I assume the same.

I feel like I need to let my initial surprise die down before doing anything because I can be pretty damn fickle.

It's possible that since it's still a pretty new thing that he's not sure where you stand. I think the first month or so are exciting but they're also the most fragile in terms of stability.   I do think you are being a little harsh and you're also making assumptions. If you're going to confront him about AM, then I also hope you're ready to tell him about Mr Hammers.

We haven't had a specific talk about it but even in the early chats we were clear about each wanting one person and that being the reason we were interested in each other. I've been clear I'm not looking and I thought he had been too.   The hammers thing is now over but of course if he asks I'll be willing to admit some things about the situation and that I won't fault him for taking an opportunity that falls in his lap,  I just don't want someone who is constantly looking."
adultery,3c7m59,liguy8719,2,Sun Jul 5 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I totally get where you're coming from. Before AP and I had the talk about exclusivity, I deliberately didn't go on AM because I didn't want to taint how I felt. And because you never know how many people someone is talking to, it took me a little while to feel confidant that I was the only one. Granted, I fully realize that I can only choose to believe him.  I hear you on not wanting someone who's actively looking.   I think you got smacked by a bit of reality and it stung. Don't let this ruin a good thing before you have a good chat with him."
adultery,3c7m59,liguy8719,2,Sun Jul 5 18:08:09 2015 UTC,"GIRL. The exact same thing happened to me. I had to talk it out with some people to get myself straight. I approached him about it and I did this whole passive aggressive thing... and basically sounded like a crazy person. He begged.  He asked if we were fighting. He said he'd deactivate the profile if it meant being able to see me again. He says he's just looking out of boredom and has specifically said his intentions to be exclusive with me. I just asked him to be honest with me, and in a way I got over it. We will see what happens.  He's still on there, but he's doing what I want him to for everything else I need.  I've only gone on 3 dates in two weeks, and IRL and dating, it's not official until it's BF/GF and that usually takes some time to filter the crazy out. In this case, I'm not calling him AP yet... though he alluded to something last night about us having an affair for years to come."
adultery,3c7m59,livesomelife,2,Mon Jul 6 12:14:15 2015 UTC,"I have been where he is now when I first started out. He is on high right now of finding someone like you and the great sex you had. He is probably feeling like he could do that with every woman he meets. I can't recall if you discussed with him about exclusivity, so if you didn't he is out there looking for more. Not being harsh, just realistic.   I learned from my mistakes by losing an AP that would have been a wonderful companion for as long as she had me. I felt that I could have been that Don Juan and no woman would resist me. Well, it didn't work out that way, and after she dumped me, it stung and it made me rethink of the reasons why I was doing this in the first place.   Talk to him. I know your hurt, but since he is knew you can be there to guide him through all of me emotions he is going through at the moment. Good luck NKT!!"

First thing that really hit home was when I read from a well respected expert that waiting until children go to college is usually worse than leaving earlier.  College kids need a home base to come home to. If you blow up that home base right after they leave, things do not go anywhere near as well as establishing two new home bases before they leave.  I know young kids under 7 roll with changes pretty well and, if both parents are committed to keeping things civil and positive for the kids, they do just fine.  Older kids and teens are going to have trouble with a divorce, especially at the beginning, but it might beat the alternative of teaching them the wrong examples of what marriage should be like.  Perhaps this experience I read recently will help in your decision: You can't Stay Married for the Kids"

What will make you happy? What will fill your life? Your AP showed you that you are worthy of love and being loved. Now that you see, what will you do with the information?   You will always be tied with your SO for your offsprings sake. Maybe you will be a better father and supporter in a better and more loving relationship. When you feel good about you, you are in a better position to be a better friend/lover/husband/boyfriend/etc. Showing your kid how relationships can end healthily and begin healthily will be better lessons than staying in a situation that makes you resentful."

Did you jump into adultery because things were already shit with SO or more selfish reasons unrelated to her?  If the feelings your having now is what drove you to an AP in the first place then maybe an AP isn't clouding your judgement at all.

adultery,3c6krk,barneyalfred,3,Sun Jul 5 09:04:37 2015 UTC,"People who are 'on the side' are usually referred to as ""affair partners"" or APs for short. Even if it's not a marriage thing, AP is shorthand for 'the other man/woman'.  It goes both ways; some people have APs that know they're married and know the score. Others keep another identity, and never let their AP know the score, and the APs think they're dating someone who is barely available.   What made you keep having these relationships?   As you've guessed, some just don't know, and think they're dating someone. Others are in similar circumstances and do it for a variety of reasons; NSA sex, an emotional attachment to escape an agonizing marriage. Single APs might just like the person they're banging enough to be 'the other man/woman' with no chance of having a lasting relationship.   Hell, I'm sure some single APs look at it as practice, or don't want a close partner while still wanting to fulfill certain needs.  I think others could provide more detailed answers than I have.   I won't bore you too much with the story, but basically the guy starts to seriously date one of his side bitches- who is unaware of her status, while unknowingly cheating on her with a former 'main girl', who has since being unknowingly demoted to side bitch.   I think the distinction in this case is an academic one. Usually, it's pretty clear cut when someone is married to one party and banging another. In this guy's case, I feel like he's just dating multiple people; if none of them know of the others, it's hard to see any of them as 'main' or more privileged than another."
adultery,3c6krk,amsosorry,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"In this guy's case, I feel like he's just dating multiple people; if none of them know of the others, it's hard to see any of them as 'main' or more privileged than another.   Came her to say just that.  The protagonist/antihero of your story isn't taking a risk at all.  He's dating multiple people and at one point he switches who he wants to spend time with the most.  Even if all these women find out about each other he just moves on to others.    Now, take that same situation and have your serial dating dishonest protagonist fall for someone who he is unaware is actually married and using him as a side bitch... that could get interesting."
adultery,3c6krk,docholidayNJ,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:37:43 2015 UTC,"Oh he's not the protagonist, just a side character really. Nice little twist of yours though.  He's really a part of the main girl's dilemma. She really likes this guy, gets really attached, it's not the fact that he is seeing other girls that bothers her but that he lies pretty heavily about it i.e. multiple facebooks, his busy work schedule. She feels strongly for him, but at the same time she is left wondering what else he lies to her about. She thought it was serious as he had asked her to move in with him."
adultery,3c6krk,trashandthrow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"I prefer ""side piece"" than side bitch. There's a set of side piece rules published in huffpo opinion a few years ago I found entertaining. I joked with my ex-AP and sent him this article... though for the most part we kept to the rules, he thought of me as more than that. I agree with what the others have said... Dating multiple people that aren't in a committed relationship (bf/gf, marriage...) isn't adultery, or even cheating really. It's just dating in modern times. That's how it is nowadays."

She has been contacted by quite a few guys she knows from work and from our personal lives. She never follows through with them or sends pictures. She does sometime chat with them just to try and figure out whats up in their marriages.

Knowing that the end is inevitable doesn't make it any easier and it hits you like a ton of bricks even when you see it coming. I'm so sorry.   I want to say that I hope she comes back to you and that this is just a bump on the road, but I'm guessing that even if she does, you'll be facing this scenario again and again until it's really over. She's right to feel torn and she's right to want more. She deserves more. It's unfortunate for you that you can't be the one to give it to her.    All you can do is let her know you're there, that you love her and then wait and let her make her decision. I would advise against letting it drag on, but I get that the clean break it easier said than done."

adultery,3c2f5g,deepbluesomeone,3,Sun Jul 5 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"Well... Fuck.  Honestly never been in a situation where that happened - feeling bad over losing an AP is a common theme so just keep in mind:  Four months in with good chemistry, you're still in your NRE phase and likely a little more attached to that than you may think or notice. Also, this is your first AP - not sure about every guy here, but the first AP I had where there was more of a connection than just sex (and I know what you got into this for - being broken up like means there was a bit more there) hurt like hell when it ended and I still think about her randomly here and there to this day (2yrs later)... It blows but it doesn't hurt like it did.  Playing the happy card when you're at home when you're torn to shreds inside is one of the most difficult things you'll endure.  You'll come out on the other side of this a little better for the experience, maybe a little jaded as it comes to your next affair. It gives you clearer vision during your next relationship with an AP and allows you to get a little better at faking it (while getting through it) should you have to deal with it again.  Bottom line: sorry to hear this happened, I can't imagine that immediate feeling of disappointment as it happened. Hope you get through it quick, good luck."

I got bailed on once like this (didn't know she was bailing out for good, she claimed it was just a temporary thing, but I knew better) in a similar situation.  I kept the hotel room and stayed away for the night as planned.  For a couple of reasons -- didn't want to raise my wife's suspicions with a travel plan change, and it also gave me ~24 hours to get my head in the right place.  This does you no good NOW, I realize.  But just throwing it out there in case it might help someone else in the future."

Then when I finished work (around 7 pm) I called her back and she is like ""Awww you going home... we didn't get to see each other.."" . WTF??  So we have plans for Tuesday night (I have a pre-stablished alibi for Tuesday Nights) and are also going to the Opera  the week after.

adultery,3c0tuw,bunniebell123,3,Fri Jul 3 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"OK.  I'm going to take a stab at this:   APs SO is suspicious so they had to cool it for a while AP is getting texts from out of state number but no mention what they say Bunniebell123 is getting texts from another number saying things about monogamy. Bunniebell123 texted back nothing going on and thought that ended it. Person she thinks is behind this was a friend but is now not anymore. Bunniebell123, AP, and who she suspects is text stalker all work together.   My take is everyone at work knows everything.  Too many moving parts for this to be as quiet as submitter thinks it is.  Jealousy, revenge, boredom etc could all be motives for the text stalker.  No telling if he or she will get worse and notify SOs or just stop.  My suggestion is to cease all AP activity for at least a month and act the same at work.  See how it plays out."
adultery,3c0tuw,docholidayNJ,2,Fri Jul 3 20:31:28 2015 UTC,"People talk and when they see a male and female together more then a few times they start assuming something is going on.

adultery,3c0tuw,livesomelife,0,Sat Jul 4 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"My AP and I at work, interactions have changed.  AP finds it difficult not to touch me so he acts differently than before.  We used to act pretty silly, just like we do with everyone else. AP acting differently than before is what I think is causing suspicion, but only in one person. One person whom has turned out to be a nutter.  I keep telling AP you do realize you act different now, cause I am acting the same.  AP then starts to act ""normal"" again and nutters suspicions dropped for a while, but when we started to get back into see each other again, AP went back to I can't look at you cause it makes me want you too much and then He starts getting texts.  Just going to wait it out and see if whom ever is bothering him will just go away.  I mean they seriously need to get a life.  The person I'm pretty sure it is, is out of state for a while and I'm curious to find out if AP gets more or less texts.  I know I should be trying to pin point the person, and I'm not going to call them out or anything  I just want to know.  It is just me being over protective of AP too, don't like that AP is getting harassed, when at this moment in time nothing is going on."

adultery,3byt1y,marriedscoundrel,3,Fri Jul 3 06:57:26 2015 UTC,"Google and assbook share data with most major websites so anywhere that you have visited (even while logged out of assbook) from the same browser as you use to check your gmail or friends list is now connected.  Even bit torrent sites and every single online email site share data with assbook or google or both so all your contact lists will eventually be connected.  The key is to choose a browser (NOT chrome) for your backup identity and only use that browser with that identity and never, ever cross the streams. Use incognito browsing for an extra tiny hit but mostly just never ever google search with your alt from the same browser as your main. Hell... use duckduckgo as your search engine and just stop googlong entirely. Especially from your phone.  And NEVER user gmail for your alt identity. They index the contents of every single email and use that to flesh out your marketing profile."
adultery,3byt1y,throwawaypoesie,3,Fri Jul 3 09:10:56 2015 UTC,"I usually use Chrome for real me and Firefox for the alt, although there are times when I have to use Chrome incog for the alt.   This incident inspired me to check my suggested friends from my real account on Facebook, and sure enough, one AP shows up. If she shows up in mine, I can only assume I show up in hers. So I'm changing my profile pic. Quite the scare but it's a good thing I caught it now before someone else did.  The information age is terrifying."
adultery,3byt1y,LondonTallGuy,2,Fri Jul 3 09:27:19 2015 UTC,"The new term is ""big data"", which sounds quite unthreatening but scares the hell out of me. I actually work in infosec (and I'm pretty good at it) - if I get occasionally caught out, what hope have most people got? There are so many potential vectors for information leakage now that pretty much anyone can be tracked down."
adultery,3byt1y,LondonTallGuy,2,Fri Jul 3 13:16:55 2015 UTC,"I'd also add - installing plugins like ghostery, adblock plus, flashblock (to kill flash cookies) can make it much harder for these organisations to track you. Nothing is perfect, but if you're going to the effort of setting up a dedicated browser, it's worth doing this too."
adultery,3byt1y,notagoodidea2,2,Fri Jul 3 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"This is what I was talking about a few posts ago. Block them. Block them all. Better yet, if your ap knows, get them to block everyone.   The good thing is that they suggest tons of people so you get lost in the crowd. The bad thing is even one saved and hidden email Addy, one phone number, one mistake on a device and boom. The connection is made to fb.   This is why fb is the easiest tool any stalker can ask for. This is why you don'tuse it if you can help it.  Let me add this. If they are suggested to you, you are suggested to them. And your closest friends and family. They connect every dot they can.   Fb suggested a guy I had dated five years ago, and did that last month. It also somehow got an email address I had saved in a hidden and password protected app, and suggested people based off those."

It must be in my colleague's contacts and he uses the fb app.  Why did I give a mobile number at all? Because I believe fb use phone numbers as a kind of ""are you a real human?"" test. Someone I knew didn't verify a phone number with them, and after a while their account was disabled and they had to send off pictures of their passport to get it back. For a throwaway account, perhaps I shouldn't have cared. (And I certainly should have used my other other mobile number, that nobody at all knows!)"
adultery,3byt1y,docholidayNJ,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"And Facebook and other companies use the type of phone number you give them to determine if they believe you are who you say you are.  iPhone and Droids get high rank, burners get very little trust.

adultery,3byt1y,LondonTallGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:35:58 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure (99%) that mobile phone numbers are used for matching, too - I've had matches suggested where the only thing the person suggested knew about me was my mobile phone number, which also happened to be known to facebook as I used it for verification. A very good reason to (a) have a ""burner"" phone for all AP related activities, and (b) not to give facebook your phone number!  (to clarify - I'm guessing the person logged in on FB on mobile, and it scanned their address book and matched me up by recognising the number. Pretty scary.)"
adultery,3byt1y,LondonTallGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it, this could work the other way - if you have your APs in your phone address book (even under pseudonyms), and use FB on mobile, it's likely to pick them up by linking the numbers. The only solution is either not to use the FB app, or to install something like XPrivacy under Android to feed the FB app bogus information..."

adultery,3byt1y,AlwaysStickItInCrazy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"It's the searching that gets you.   If you list your home town as the same as your AP's (which is common), and you FB search your AP and AP searches you, bam, you're linked. FB makes guesses that you're friends, and your friends might be friends.  The link gets stronger the more you search.  FB phone apps are also aware of what network you're on, your geolocation, and I believe your phone's IMEI number. Those all link fake you to real you.  I would be skeptical of FB and Google straight up sharing personal data about you. Both companies compete for that, since that's what they're getting from their free services. If it's true, a source should be easily found."
adultery,3byt1y,liguy8719,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:16:02 2015 UTC,"You need to use a fake email that is not associated with anything else for your fake facebook.    Like others have said, most sites share info."

It constantly bombarded me with his posts, he was constantly in my chat pane, every time I added a pic it would ask me if I wanted to tag him in it etc., and don't even get me started with the whole 'seen' message thing. It just drove me loopy, made me anxious, and it unfortunately made me somewhat obsessive. This, of course, totally freaked my AP out, and he ended up blocking me. We haven't spoken since, and I doubt we ever will again...  Never again am I going to 'friend' an AP on there!"

adultery,3bzn5x,itwasntplanned,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:03:22 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the taste, it changes as the menstrual cycle progresses and if the other person is willing to give you head then they probably know/don't care.  Smell also changes and it is more of a factor but as long as you don't have a fish shop downthere (due to an infection/std) then some wiping beforehand and you are good to go. It won't smell like flowers, it will smell like pussy... and pussy is good ;-)"
adultery,3bzn5x,docholidayNJ,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:08:15 2015 UTC,Yep. It's totally banned for the reasons you point out; too self conscious about it and it kills the mood for her. So the compatibility isn't all there.

Other guys would be thrilled they don't have to worry about it.  Probably a lot of guys.  Try seeing it from the other side...  Say you love giving head and it really turns you on but your partner says he doesn't want you to do that because he feels he's never clean enough.  He's made the decision on what you should like for you.    Ultimately, you gotta do what you're comfortable with though."

The second time round she admitted that our relationship and intimacy wasn't a priority for her and she couldn't do the things I wanted to do. She didn't have the headspace.  So I thought, fine, that makes sense and confirms everything for me. We had a trial separation of 1 month and about two weeks in I had no intention of returning.  The logistics are that I was lucky to have a friend who rented me a spare room and I take my son away for a little holiday every other weekend, and see him about twice a week apart from that.   It's all very amicable. I'm seeing a super hot milf who is the most sexual person I've ever met in my life(!) and I keep myself really busy with seeing friends, going to parties and doing my hobbies/passions. Oh and going on dates.   That's the other thing, when you start getting with other people the person you once used to put on a pedestal becomes pretty average in a lot of ways. E.g. I compare sex with the milf to sex with her and there is NO comparison.   It's all part of the process of moving on and embracing life. Good luck guys."

If I start an affair completely upfront with another person who's also being up front about everything, then OUR relationship isn't built on lies, it's built on an understanding that we're both married but want to pursue a discreet relationship with each other.

I'd say there is about a 95% chance you have thoroughly screwed any chance with this woman. You have outright lied to her multiple times. Your only sliver of hope is to come clean before she suspects something is up. By then it will definitely be too late.

None at all. Re-read it if you don't believe me. I may have been blunt but sometimes that's exactly what someone needs. Fact is, I've been there. I have made damn near the exact same mistake and I blew it with someone incredible. And it was a ""sure thing"" as well. She was all in until I came clean but I had to. In my case it wasn't an outright lie, it was an omission. She assumed I was divorced, I didn't correct her assumption, and it just went from there. I still kick myself over it but it was too late and the damage had been done. Learn from it and move on. Or, like I said, maybe you'll be lucky and she is a smart girl who already figured it out and she doesn't actually care and she'll still be good with you.

That being said, perhaps a good start for you will be to find someone online and keep it there, basically an exercise to see if you could actually go through with it. A lot of people (in my experience) do this online only and whether or not it's cheating, is for the birds.  In my case, starting an online thing with someone answered a lot of question I too had. Those were answered and it turns out that I can do online no problem but doing it for real is currently another step I have to take, and I don't know if I'm ever going to. Perhaps it's because I no longer have any reason to visit r/deadbedrooms. When she hit 41, the wife became something of a freak. Shit, sometimes it feels like the LL person is me because I have to feign a headache or something sometimes.

adultery,3buj1j,YourSecond,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:32:03 2015 UTC,"I think there is another option to consider. Sometimes I look at the subs r/seduction and r/redpill. I see a common theme of dead bedrooms leading to break ups and divorces. But then something interesting happens. If the newly single man decides to remake himself and starts getting a lot of attention from new younger girls, the ex gf/wife goes nuts and becomes extremely sexually interested in him. I can go on and on for the psychological reasons for this, basically it comes down to women instinctually craving ""high value"" ""alpha"" males and a man receiving attention from good looking girls is perceived this way.   Anyway, my point is not to make her jealous, just that I have read about so many hopeless situations being saved. If your wife loves you enough to give adultery a shot, I think you should give seduction a shot and see if you can't turn her on again.   Warning, r/redpill can be very distasteful sometimes. It treats females as if they are nothing more than their instincts and they can never overcome them. But this sub still has value because sex is extremely instinctual, these instincts evolved millions of years ago, and the way they manifest in the modern world seems to go against what we know about our culture and society. However looking at girls this way has a lot of merit and usefullness. You love your wife so I know you won't take it too far. But I really think you should check out both these subs. Girls are wired a bit differently than we are normally taught to beleive and so it is worth learning about it to turn on your wife. BTW r/redpill loves r/adultery."

If my fingers are sore, they need more of a workout more often. If her on top gets her off then I get to enjoy the view.   Men should enjoy the power trip. What kind of an ego boost is it to know that whispering in a woman's ear ""Cum for me, now."" works?  The best kind. Passion, enjoyment and pleasure should all be part of sex. If you just work to bust a nut and roll over because that was the requirement, you suck as a lover and probably as a man.   Women deserve better."

I'm sure she's probably looked at you with interest before. I think cheaters are always sizing people up. But now that you both know you're cheaters, who knows, there might be an opportunity there. I would probably see if she wants to talk to you about her situation more. Find out if she's happy with her AP.  See where she's at before you go putting yourself out there.   Also. Does it matter that she's a client?  I would imagine that you'd have to maintain a professional front regardless and watch for your reputation."

adultery,3brqfy,partyanimal792,2,Wed Jul 1 18:25:43 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like you need to calm the smaller head a little. She may be interested but might not be the right one to make your move.

Most people there aren't looking for what you are looking for.  If you pay for a membership (pretty inexpensive) then you can browse profiles in stealth mode. That will help you find who might be up for a married guy.  You can search profiles depending on how a certain question was answered.  There are some questions relating to monogamy and dating someone in a relationship.  I did that recently and three profiles came up.  They were not what I was looking for."

adultery,3bp82d,theadulteress,23,Wed Jul 1 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"Because people are greedy, and we always end up wanting more. By the very nature of an affair, you're not the main dish as it were. And the AP relationship can have varying levels of involvement, but it's never the main event. Not for as long as one or both parties are technically committed to another. Eventually one partner may come to a point where they realize the relationship will never grow, never evolve to anything beyond what it currently is, become unsatisfied with that, and end things. Even if you weren't married or attached, saying to a person ""this is my limit on how much of a partner I can be to you"" is not a very attractive package.  Other reasons - some people live for the NRE. Once that wears off, find someone new for more NRE. Or maybe they find that the longer it goes on, the more they get attached, which is not what they want. Or simply - a lot of relationships aren't destined to last that long, regardless of the context."

We all have emotional and scheduling demands outside of the affair that come first and can leave us with little to offer our partner or maybe just not enough in the area they need at times, or vice versa, and without any real ties or commitment to each other there is no reason to deal with getting less from an AP than you want, especially since many of us already settle for that at home."

The only men I have been involved with on the side are men that I have had around as FWB long before I even met my SO and none of them are attached so they are trustworthy and drama free. The risks and potential drama surrounding this guy are really not worth it but I am curious about the signals he's been sending. These are signals that he is sending, unprovoked, to me. So I'm curious, how did my post come across as though I was pushing him closer to cheat? My intentions aren't to persuade him to cheat, at this point I have done nothing other than accept an invitation from my friend to hang out at a hotel and have some drinks.

Check out my sub on tinder...been on a few days literally its like AM is dial up & tinder is fiber
adultery,3boj1d,deepinlust,3,Tue Jun 30 21:36:22 2015 UTC,I'd wait until I see their pics then send my key with pics that are still blurry anyway lol. Most guys can see through and I'll wait to respond to the ones with a meaningful message first.
adultery,3boj1d,trashandthrow,2,Tue Jun 30 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"I also don't upload any pics to AM. If someone piques my interest, I move the conversation to a throwaway email or kik, and even then I make him jump through a few hoops before he gets a pic. If he's pushy or a moron about it, I say ""no thanks"" and block him. It's a ladies' marketplace. I've nothing to hide. I'm fit and attractive.

If you really like favorite them or wink...I generally I wait for a chick to view me twice before I msg... Make sure your bio is short sweet & to the point.  Then you can chat/swap pics on kik or a throw off e-mail, or text on a burner.  Kik is good so you can block dorks if they get creepy or needy.. I like Kik..Its a app for droid or iphone..Pretty much everyone on AM has it...Yes its anon... Personally I think all women would be better off on AM with no pics..Too many dipshit guys mess it up for guys like me..

Nerd talk guys may run shit, live in 5000 square foot houses, and retire with a lotta $ at 55, but we still have trouble picking up narcissists on AM.  All kidding aside, I just started to explore kik and, though it seems great, you can't actually quit the app on an iphone.  The only way to quit it is to reset the app and lose all your texts (not sure if all contacts lost as well).   You can hide it in a folder but one search and up it comes.  One click and, if you haven't reset it, your whole history is there.  Someone needs to design a web based portal to access kik.  Log in via incognito web page and once the page is closed, the trail is cold."

I read someone on here used a name that looked like a buddy's,  so if it was ever found he just could say,  buddy must have installed it when I let him use it when his phone was dead. That would only work of logging out its an option though. I can see when I kik someone on an IPhone of it gets delivered,  or sites on sent if he's logged out,  but now I'm worried he's not really off the app, or is less hidden than he realizes? I'm on Android,  so it appears to go away when I force quit."
adultery,3boj1d,NotHisMrs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:44:10 2015 UTC,I had a key pic of me in a dress that showed my shape but not my face.  I have other pics for later when I feel more comfortable.
adultery,3boj1d,DirtyGingertini,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:20:25 2015 UTC,"I ignore any winks,  pic requests,  or keys,  delete it all unless there is a personal note.  I also ignore anyone who moves to email immediately or has email in their profile. I usually also delete anyone who doesn't meet my specifics,  age,  location,  isn't attractive to me,  or obviously looking for only nsa sex.  I should reply to some of those,  but everytime I have I feel like I'm leading them on.  I probably get ten requests everytime I log in.  So if they can't write something,  why bother.  When I'm interested I usually send my key and ask for theirs.  Favorite them if I'm really interested a couple days later.  At first I sent messages out,  but I found out that makes it cost extra,  and is what the bots do.  None of 3 my pictures are revealing of anything other than my body shape,  I used the clip art makes provided to cover my whole face. Be careful with pics even after messaging.  I've had a few nice guys turn out to be just looking for pictures and that left me feeling pretty gross and vulnerable. Good luck!"

Otherwise I feel like you may just be spamming all the ladies, or it could be a well crafted free wink. The interface is awful I've had it eat more than a few messages,  so I don't mind switching to kik or email but I guess I still enjoy feeling like I'm the one getting the address,  not on a bulk list."

I had a funded AM account and closed it anyway because CL was so much better.  Step 1: Have a good body.  Step 2: Take a few good photos that show off your body. Also take or have ready some good face photos. Note: don't use these photos anywhere else because of reverse image search.  Step 3: Post a CL ad with your body shot (no face obviously). Keep it short. Say what you're after. Be upfront about being married. Be a little picky. Tell her  briefly how you'll treat her (hint: not like a princess). Ask them to include a photo (At least body) in their first response, and a specific subject line from them so you know they're not spam.  Step 4: Delete the spam, guys asking to suck your dick, and any responses without a pic (this one's your call, but I've never had luck with them). Send your face pic to the ones you like and ask when they're free.  Step 5: The ones that are interested, meet them for coffee or drinks soon - they've responded to other ads.  If they agree to meet, they're looking to have sex. Escalate touch (hand on arm, brush her hair, etc), keep eye contact while smiling, tease her a bit. Go for the kiss early.  Step 6: You know step six.  edit: grammar, wording"

But, be prepared to explain what you want.  What is it you're trying to gain from this display of true affection and feeling? Do you want him to leave his wife? Would you rather be able to just tell him you love him while maintaining your present relationships?  Rationally come up with your plan as you move forward and then lay out how you feel. If he likely already knows, all you're doing is bringing your best friend in on something he no longer needs to mildly speculate about and read into; your actions and words are valid and relevant.  Having true, deep feelings for someone like this isn't easy nor common, in my experience. When you find it - grab it, and you can't do that while keeping everything bottled up.  I'm a male - if I were your friend I would want to know and I'd want to be able to openly discuss how I feel about you as well.  Good luck. Keep us posted :)"

adultery,3blit7,blackcorduroy,3,Tue Jun 30 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to accomplish is just getting it out there. I have no expectation.     In that case what's bothering you is that ""what if"" scenario you keep playing in your mind.  What if I spook him and he decides to cool it.  What if he feels the same way, then what do we do.  What if we wind up in a physical affair not just this emotional one.  Would he want me over her and do I want out of my marriage.  The spinning mind is almost unstoppable.    Calm you mind and open the discussion by telling him you need to express your thoughts and feelings openly and are a little afraid of how he will react.  This usually gives us guys a heads up to really pay attention.  Then just tell him, but also give him time to digest all of it.  Do not expect an immediate reaction and you should even tell him that you know he will need time to think.  The hard part will be that period of time from you telling how you feel to his response.  Be it seconds or days your heart will pound and your mind will spin.  Calm yourself.  If you are anxious he will see it and feel pressured to make the ""right"" answer maybe not his true feelings.  As others have said he no doubt feels the same way and probably has the same thoughts in his mind.  Since your relationship is already so open in discussion of intimate details this would just be the next step.  Good luck.  BTW this sub is one of the least judgmental on reddit.  OTOH we do tend to speak our minds here and sometimes it's not pretty or what you want to hear."

But nothing prepares you for that moment and best laid plans can often change.    He's under siege right now.  His family, his finances, his social structure are all potentially under assault.  He stands to lose all of it.  So my suggestion is to give him what he needs (which is probably space) and ask him for nothing.

You have a lot of options. 1. Play the dread game and see what she does. This means that you communicate that you don't just want sex, it's required and not negotiable and you'll get it however you can and that's why you are interested in other women, but you'd be interested in Celine if she provided. Tell her that you two need to fix that part of your relationship or else you're going to look elsewhere. 2. Get in shape if you aren't already. 3. Instead of playing the dread game, cheat behind her back. It's what most of us are doing. Works pretty well. The sex is amazing."
adultery,3blf9t,Throw-away-4-days,3,Tue Jun 30 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"OP, I agree 100% with what /u/probite said about going to counseling.  That will ultimately bring out whether or not she's on board with saving your marriage.  You can't, as others have suggested here, just ""alpha' your way out of this.  It's a low probability of success and a high probability of douchiness.  There's nothing wrong with working on your confidence and any other sort of self-improvement (including fitness).  But for this to work out to your best possible desired outcome, you both need to be vulnerable in front of each other in a safe environment.  Currently, the vulnerability is 100% one-sided and is not safe for you.  Counseling is the only place that can offer that safe environment.  She will have a chance to see what her actions do to you.  You will have a chance to see what your actions have done to her.  It will be raw, it be emotional, it will completely suck at times.  But eventually you will find out whether or not she cares and whether or not she's got it in her to do the work required to fix your marriage.  Basically, it will be a litmus test to see if your marriage can be saved and will offer a path if you're both on board."

Women are more threatened by emotional transgressions, men by physical ones  Good luck but stop settling please, you can make a new life with someone you're more passionate about  I WILL say that if a woman, any woman, doesn't let you get physical with her even after an intense emotional connection then there is a danger that it's an illusion. women who actually want you accept you physically"

adultery,3bjmjr,Hechangedmylife,2,Tue Jun 30 03:37:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry -- on mobile.   I created this account because my situation [will be] similar to yours, except I'm the younger, single AP.   He is in his late thirties and I in my early twenties. There is a 15 year difference. We met unintentionally through a mutual interest/hobble. Clicking instantly, we talked over the phone for hours when we could (he is in the business world -- more opportunities for extended talks/meets), dropping subtle hints about our fondness for each other. Eventually that developed into meeting eachother and once that happened we quickly fell deeply, deeply, deeply in love with eachother. This is long story short.   We both know it would never, ever work out between us. He has three young children, is a CEO position for a semi-major business, and is also in the military. Needless to say, he also maintains a dedication to his family and the commitment he made to his wife, even though he is in a extreme dead bedroom situation and with a woman who is completely undeserving of him. I have no interest in destroying a great man and so we never bring this topic up or moan over it.   His biggest fear is me. He and I both know that I'm young and will ultimately need to break off this affair. I wanted you to know, from my perspective and likely from your ex-AP's, that this is so, so, so painful for is too. The thought of it causes tears to well in my eyes. I want him forever. He is the greatest lover and the most perfect man for me. But I know that I have to let go at some point, for my own good. I am young, I want to ultimately have my own family.  We have both talked about how this will be devastating and just knowing how hurt he'll be at my hand rips a hole in my heart. These talks usually end with my own melt down - assuring him this isn't what I would want in an ideal world. I want to keep the affair going for as long as I can. But we are honest to eachother and have acknowledged that I will have to one day leave.   You just must remember that she had to do this. You knew why you were signing up to. At the end of it all, you have. Had the most romantic, passion filled relationship of your life. Be glad you experienced that, not many people, ever , get to experience that."

I was attracted by his username and his ""phrase"" (usually just one sentence, that shows for those who don't have pictures). If I remember correctly,  I winked (or whatever), we exchanged pictures, and the conversation began. He did have a picture of his upper body, nude...but it was very tasteful, along with 3 face pictures. To be honest though,  his words are what sucked me in. I could tell he was very intelligent, secure (alpha, but not cocky), and referred to me as ""sweet girl"" a few times which was the deal sealer. So, it's not necessarily all in the pictures. Both of us are fairly attractive, and I do believe the more attractive you are physically,  the better chance you have. ...sadly...hey, I'm just being realistic. We are a society that focuses on beauty.   With that being said, I did communicate with maybe 3 other men....all who went on and on about themselves. ..what they owned, how rich they were, how they wanted to take bubble baths, and wine and dine me....none of which I was interested in hearing. So, those conversations ended quickly.  I feel like personal life information is just off limits....especially in the beginning.   Another turn off were  the pictures with masks over the men's faces. Just looks stupid. If you are worried about someone seeing your picture, wait and exchange your key. Of course the men who had pictures with a woman (cut out,  but still obviously a picture with a woman that had been cropped) was another deal breaker.   I wish you the best of luck!!

Try to bring others with you when visiting at the water cooler so the office is not buzzing with your hot minutes. Use her office to visit but don't stay long. You can use the company chat system to talk longer. Text as much as you want. You might want to use google voice to text if you don't want anything to show up on your phone bills. Find out of the way happy hour spots. We had run into coworkers too much at our usual spot. You said you live alone so why not bring her back to your place? For her cover, tell her to take a to day/leave for a doctor visit and you do the same. Now it looks like she is at work while ""visiting"" at your place. Also, find a conference going on and you both go for your company.   Hope this helps. Enjoy!"

I honestly don't see any reason to stop chatting and doing lunch - I almost feel like it's less suspicious. I mean in your coworkers eyes, if you were having an affair, wouldn't you be more secretive?   The conference thing is not a bad idea either. I would try occasionally using the work late excuse or weekend work - not sure what you do, but it's very believable that I have to stay to get work done or go in on Sunday's. Also since your office seems bigger, you both taking a day off is not as conspicuous so that's good.   But whatever you do, just be so so so careful.

adultery,3bct6g,tthrowawaylogin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:13:31 2015 UTC,It is VERY hard to do this stuff at work. You may think you are being discreet but people pick up on body language changes so quickly.   Try to have a valid reason to be in her office. Be mindful of how you behave at the coolers. If you are leaving the office to meet outside then be mindful that people WILL pick up on you both leaving at the same time on a consistent basis so try to find a way to go out where the same people won't notice both of you leaving.   Really the best way is to get a room booked somewhere and take a sneaky day off.

That clip must have been taped in the relatively short gap between the day that Bill Clinton was caught being unfaithful and the day that Newt Gingrich (who Rock used as an example of someone who could not get laid because he was a fat Republican) was caught being unfaithful.
adultery,3bbl0h,marriedscoundrel,2,Sun Jun 28 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what /u/newsdigest_fan said. Wife decided our relationship didn't need that much sex in it, despite multiple protests from me."
adultery,3bbl0h,newsdigest_fan,3,Sat Jun 27 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"For me, it was the best last resort action I could take, and I'm extremely glad I did. I went many, many years without and emotional or physical affection from SO and resented everyone and everything. I was in a really dark place.  Then one day I met AP. The world just opened up for me again. Everything was (and is) brighter with her in my life. As much as I fought against this notion, we humans are social creatures and for the most part feeling wanted and desired on an emotional and physical level is vital to our well-being. Cheating made me a whole person again."
adultery,3bbl0h,hugepenis,2,Sat Jun 27 22:13:03 2015 UTC,So why stay with SO?
adultery,3bbl0h,dyingontheinside2015,5,Sat Jun 27 23:54:15 2015 UTC,"In no particular order: kids, significant assets, and I still love my SO. She is still and will always be the one I want to grow old with. I just got sick of living like an old person decades before my time."
adultery,3bbl0h,My-Names-Jeff,2,Sun Jun 28 01:06:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this.   I always feel guilty for the love of my wife.   I want nothing more than to live my life with her, but there are just something's we don't see eye to eye on and affection is one of them."
adultery,3bbl0h,newsdigest_fan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:23:49 2015 UTC,"Good question.  As I think many would admit here: it's complicated. Finances, kids, and we generally get along well most of the time -- but like co-workers, not a loving couple. We tried counseling, but that proved useless. This situation, though probably not permanent, works for me now."

I do it for thrills, fun, the chase, getting that ""one"" that is too good or plays hard to get... It's a game.  Although I tell myself it's for the emotional connection and that's the reason I started doing it - I haven't been able to find that connection, so playing the game is fun... Empty, but fun."

adultery,3bbj0z,txguy345,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:17:06 2015 UTC,"Not yet, but I'm in a similar phase. We are near enough to meet after almost 25 years and talk a little here and there about life, our partners (she's married) and whatnot.   I've enjoyed learning what she was up to, and completely not interested in rekindling the flame of our teen agedd love, but I'm also enjoying being able to talk to someone who I was intimate with. At the start it was just nothing and very friendly. Then one day I mentioned that I needed to head off for a shower and she commented on how much she'd like to see that again.  After a quick spiral of flirting, we were both masturbating, sending messages back and forth, and I had a huge orgasm when her message said she was cumming and I should too. As we calmed down, we chatted quickly about how much of a surprise that was -and that it was a fun release.   From there I gave her space because I don't want to screw up her marriage, though I'd be an AP for her just on the novelty of it all. We haven't met IRL since that session (a few weeks ago), or done anything sexy again. I'm not pushing it, just chatting about normal things every few days again.  So... proceed with caution. There's a part of my wicked side that would really like to compare our sex after so many years and partners. It would be fun! But there's a good balance of ""Don't fuck up her marriage, I don't want her."" countering it.  Staying mindful is good sometimes ;)"
adultery,3bbj0z,GotnoVoodoo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"I've met a few APs (women) whose first affair happened by hooking up with an old HS flame (or crushes) via Facebook. Those were like a gateway drug into the world of adultery.   Me? I hooked up with a HS flame but that was before AM or the other sites were on the table. Enjoyed it, enjoyed her, we had a sort of in-love but accepting that we're not destined to be together feeling. We still keep in touch like old friends."
adultery,3bbj0z,Son_of_Riffdog,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:16:22 2015 UTC,Not really a hs sweetheart but someone from hs. We had gone out twice after hs like 3 yrs after. Nothing happened as she had a kid with her. Kinda why I stopped looking for her lol. We kept in touch but lost contact with her for like a few yrs till i found her on fb. Started chatting met for lunch and yes didnt tell wife.  She was single so i guess things just happened. She knew my situation and was cool aboit it.  She really didnt know my wife too well in hs so made it a bit easier. She ended up gatting so we stopped.
adultery,3bbj0z,jst4fun562,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:51:17 2015 UTC,I have recently reconnected with a boyfriend from high school. We live hundreds of miles apart but are planning to meet soon. The intensity & passion is off of the charts - it is actually a bit scary.
adultery,3bacdg,partyanimal792,2,Sat Jun 27 08:07:11 2015 UTC,So yes tinder is for singles yea yea... But its just so efficient and fast.  Why not just create fake fb account with burner phone & enjoy the ride?  My married buddy uses it & has had fun.  I prefer to be honest in my bio and just say married looking for nsa & see what happens.  My single friend who uses tinder takes me on dates where girl has friends.  Im a pretty good wingman & he knows Im a cheater.  From what Ive seen the tinder women are about 70% nsa dtf..Some are looking for love but I think tinder just sucks for that.  Bios are short its all looks..Any other cheaters using or thinking about using tinder?  If so any techniques used to make the cheater lifestyle work better?
adultery,3bacdg,dyingontheinside2015,2,Sat Jun 27 08:14:57 2015 UTC,"I've met both my APs via tinder (using a fake fb account). I don't have my marital status in my bio. As a male, unless you look like a model I wouldn't expect you to get a single match if you do. I'm a bit older so it's pretty much a given that everyone is either married, has been married, has kids, etc.. I think that makes it a little easier.   I'm honest and don't lie once I match with someone. More than one woman has said she tries to blow it up on a guy if she finds he is lying. You aren't as smooth as you think your are and the lies will catch up to you. Keep that in mind. I've also matched with women who are bitter and pissed so even being honest has its drawbacks and isn't perfect. Keep your matches a safe distance to eliminate the chance of running into one of those in the local grocery store. I found that the longer I wait to give my relationship status the worse it is so I usually try to find an appropriate segue to talk about as early as possible. It took some time to figure out, but I now keep most of my matches even after divulging my status.   Bios don't mean shit. Ignore them. My current AP had every possible ""it isn't going to happen"" in hers."
adultery,3bacdg,bigblacker,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:03:47 2015 UTC,Im no model but Im very fit.  I get lots of views & msgs/ dates on AM...Im pretty sure I can navigatev tinder.  All my single friends go nuts on it.  I have a married buddy who likes it too.  My problem is getting the app to work on my burner..How beefed up does my FB account need to be to make it work?
adultery,3bacdg,dyingontheinside2015,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:06:28 2015 UTC,"Barely - make a fake account. Change the city to someplace else (won't matter) like some pages that are of topics you like.... Add your photos but make them only viewable to your friends (which you won't have any... Right)   Add photos to Tinder, make sure profile public photo is not your face.  Do not friend anyone you may know or even know by proxy."
adultery,3bacdg,dyingontheinside2015,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:02:29 2015 UTC,"You got it working now but for what it's worth, my fake account doesn't have any friends and only the pictures I wanted to use in my tinder profile. It's basically empty and tinder worked fine."
adultery,3bacdg,AlwaysStickItInCrazy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"Replying to myself to mention something I forgot:  responses to the marriage revelation fall into the following buckets:  1) instant un-match (very rarely). It has happened only a couple of times. 2) no response, but not un-matching me either. Just not their thing but not turned off enough to un-match either. 3) relief (they're married too). 4) more interest (want more info but aren't disgusted or running back to their ex). By far the majority. 5) ""Holy Tits! I didn't see that coming."" (my all time favorite)"
adultery,3bacdg,dyingontheinside2015,2,Sun Jun 28 14:01:34 2015 UTC,"I have yet to meet a married woman on Tinder - all my connections have been with single women. It's fine for a one night (well, day) stand, but without the mutual cheating, there's not a whole lot of room for a longer term AP (emphasis on 'partner'). At least, not in my experience."

adultery,3b9ef0,SweetD08,2,Sat Jun 27 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"I was a lurker at deadbedrooms before I made the, um, transition over to here. Generally speaking, people on this sub are far happier.   For me, not having someone to talk to is about the hardest part. I do have someone I could talk to if I really needed to but then he wouldn't have plausible deniability so I keep my mouth shut.  Welcome.  As for your feelings, my AP and I are fighting that battle right now. We met a couple of weeks ago and the NRE is running really high but we've also connected on a very deep level. I've shared details of my life with her I haven't with anyone else. I find it deeply ironic that a relationship essentially built upon lies and deceit is at the same time so open and honest. My marriage is in a different place than hers but we both have a lot to lose so after an incredible date night earlier this week, today was the first day we've tried to pull back a bit and get our feelings and emotions contained a bit. It's a bitch but still better than moping around the house knowing there was no way in hell I was going to get laid any time soon."
adultery,3b9ef0,dyingontheinside2015,2,Sat Jun 27 11:43:10 2015 UTC,"I find it deeply ironic that a relationship essentially built upon lies and deceit is at the same time so open and honest.     Yes! this. What is keeping me grounded (kind of, at least) is reminding myself of those lies and deceit. Because otherwise I'd be absolutely gone.   I agree that the emotional stuff is a bitch, but better for me than settling for sketchy one night stands. I like a certain type of guy, and they tend to be married :/ not many of my type in the dating pool."
adultery,3b9ef0,Son_of_Riffdog,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:52:43 2015 UTC,"That's what keeps me from ever falling completely, the admittedly hypocritical thought of: the other person is a cheater, so can I trust them in the long run? Can I be trusted?"
adultery,3b9ef0,Son_of_Riffdog,2,Sat Jun 27 15:13:55 2015 UTC,"and it helps me to constantly remind myself that it's so much easier to be a good AP than a good spouse. An affair is such an artificial relationship - no financial stuff, no parenting stuff, none of the nitty gritty of a marriage. Those are my two tactics that are working right now"
adultery,3b9ef0,probite,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"For me, not having someone to talk to is about the hardest part.    That's a big reason I created this sub. When I first started out there were only a handful of spots, specifically the comments of a blog I used to visit, but right after the guy started a forum he got caught and the whole blog/forum/everything collapsed. A few of the refugees scattered to some very small forums but they weren't very welcoming (filled with other bloggers paranoid they were next).   There are so many people who make the decision to cheat, so many that it's a sizable portion of the population. It's a shame there's been no place for them to talk. To vent. To feel some connection to the thousands of people out there (more like millions) who can relate, offer feedback, offer needed criticism, whatever.   I wanted this to be that place.   Especially for guys: I've found more women can find an understanding girlfriend to tell about their decision to go outside their marriage, but guys will at best guy a ""high five, dude!"" which isn't useful and feels like more a of a potential liability."

I had an AP like that before, we started talking. while she knew i was married from the start, by the time she realized the consequences, it was too late, she was emotionally hooked (us married guys got game).    Just remember to always be able to take a step back and decide if this relationship is still meeting a need and not causing more pain. also, I would suggest dating single guys at the same time as the relationship. it's nice to have someone to come home to"

Im a guy on AM its very hard to guage sometimes if the women you meet are aggressive or tame.  Often women talk about how disgusted they are with aggressive, needy, gross guys.  So during first dates we tend to be a bit conservative so as not to scare you off.  Also most 1st dates are in daytime In lunch/bar setting.  Its hard to get the body chemistry going like you do in a crowded nightclub or bar.  Not to mention no dancing.  Also since crowds are light both are on high alert for unfriendlyies... Basically 1st dates are tough...I prefer to convince women I meet on AM to tell hubs they want a girls night out.. Then I tell wife Im out with boys.  This way I can touch her talk in her ear, dance, ect...Much better for both..I'd like to hear your thoughts on best 1st date options from other side of fence.

My bio clearly states that. No tricks no fake pics no games.  I just think its hard to have great dates in such blah environments.  IMO getting women to be physically attracted takes body chemistry.  In order to create that you need a environment that promotes touching.  I like things to happen naturally.. Talking, touching, fucking..  Getting a woman to meet  in a hotel after a few lunch dates seems awkward..  However I agree Im a simple meathead.  The whole brainy things not my cup of tea.

I think putting yourself in a situation with him and his family be it his daughter or wife will not be helpful, and just make things worse for you.  to be continued (wife walked in)  I'm leaving that in because that is the essence of our problem as married men. we could want to be there for you all day and night, earnestly and with no ulterior motives. but when the SO comes in or needs something, that will take precedence, even if you are in the middle of the worst day of your life, we will try and get back to you as soon as possible but at the end of the day, those of us not leaving our SO's will have to prioritize going to pick curtains with SO over helping you from  sinking deeper . we would rather be with you supporting you and making sure you get to a better place, but we can't.    So at the end of the day, you will have to decide if the pain and guilt , the  sudden disappearances and potential chaos is worth it. There are good supportive available single men out there but many of them are waiting for you to find them."

adultery,3b6kzv,probite,2,Fri Jun 26 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why I asked here is because I can talk about it to my wonderful therapist all day long, but she's never been in this situation before. Y'all have. It's nice talking to people who know what I'm going through, or at least have a better understanding of it."
adultery,3b6kzv,probite,4,Fri Jun 26 13:13:20 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, in life you can have someone love you and care for you deeply.  and still the best thing for your health might be to cut contact ...if you can't handle it without reverting to old habits."
adultery,3b6kzv,probite,2,Fri Jun 26 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"I have tried so hard to find these ""good supportive available single men"" but I just can't seem to. OKC isn't working (been on there for years) and POF/AFF seem to be more aimed towards one night stands or emotionless encounters. Plus I have my problem of sleeping with guys on the first date whether I want to or not, because somehow I have it ingrained in my head that the only way to get guys to like me is to sleep with them. My married guy keeps instructing me to not do that, but apparently I have a problem and can't not do that.  For some reason I'm attracted to unavailable men. I don't know why. Maybe something to do with my dad being emotionally abusive/neglectful? Who the hell knows. All I know is I have to find a way to move on."
adultery,3b6kzv,probite,3,Fri Jun 26 14:09:35 2015 UTC,"may I suggest start looking for them online? it's a win win situation:    many of the available good men are available because of insecurities and are found online much more than real life (and i am not talking date site, think forums , subreddits and games).    since they are online only they still count as unavailable (to you) so they should be your type  and best of all no sex on the first date!!!"

In all honesty I'm really disappointed in the men that are on AM in my city.  I've been tempted to screenshot the groups of thumbnails to see if other women on /r/adultery think my AM sampling is as gross as I do.  I would have thought that married men looking for affairs would be more attractive,  but no.  I've had a couple that did have nice pics turn out to be older/fatter in person after claiming there photos are within a year.  I think I might start asking for verification photos before meeting from now on because having a man light up when he recognizes me come through the door at Starbucks and my first thought is ""oh gross"" is not fun.   I'm not going to lie to my family about my whereabouts for that. It's awkward to make a getaway too because they can't take a hint and push to the point if me having to say ""I'm sorry but you don't look like your photos and I'm not interested.  Also I'm mad that you wasted my time.""  All this is to say...   women can be very selective.  Attractive women can be extremely selective.  Maybe she will only chat with the best of the best.  Or hell, maybe she recognized you from something.  You have an AP #4.  So you must have something going for you.   Was the AM woman in a different league than your existing APs?"

Has anyone else experienced this? Why is it? To be 100% honest, I think the married send would get better/more frequent if I could last that long with her.   WAIT,WHAT???  say it's true. there is hope i can last longer with other people?  while i don't agree with /u/mysub3  for the reasoning as I make sure my wife has a good time before i take  my turn at bat, I still strike out quickly.  so, I am eagerly awaiting your answer guys !"

I dunno how long he'll last but you don't need to be too involved, just 5 minutes or so. Finish, put him back in his pants, then stand up, tracing your finger along his stomach and chest as you go. Kiss him again, then hug him and whisper in his ear ""Sorry, but I'd been thinking about that all day and just couldn't help myself. Shall we have a glass of wine?""  With any luck, the wine will come after the fun."

adultery,3b08xt,1969blue,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally get that. You have to pick who you trust carefully, it only takes one wrong move, and I agree that men are generally more understanding than women. But he knows me. If he knows me to this extent and still thinks I'd do anything to hurt him or mess up his life, then it doesn't really make it 'better'. It's the way you treat a fuck, not a friend. I guess that's what I'm really hung up on, he said he cared about me and now I see he didn't really.  Plus he's good, but he really thought I would never figure it out? I must come off like the most naive, trusting human on earth."
adultery,3b08xt,marriedscoundrel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"Good points. I find your attitude very admirable, although I don't share it. I know I have to talk to him about it, because for me the reasoning behind it makes a difference to me. And I need him to apologize if...I don't know. If there's anything to continue. I'm actually shocked by how hurt I am by this, since like you I suspected something wasn't right from the beginning. But when I asked the second time and he told me he was divorced, I genuinely believed him and I guess I let my guard down. I try to hold back in proportion with what other people are holding back, so if someone is open with me, I'm open with them. If he didn't want to be open, he could've been ambiguous, said it was complicated, and I would've respected that and backed off.   For me the thing is, is he really the same person? He's lied about such fundamental things, what if it's all lies? Everything he told me could be a lie, and I'd be none the wiser. I feel like the only things I can trust are the things he didn't say, the little stuff implied in parts of larger stories, or just the way he is. And those things have worth to me, but he's just not the man I thought he was. Maybe he's a better man or maybe worse, but different either way.  I am going to try and put myself in his shoes, after I've cooled off. I want to work through it entirely on my own and then go from there. Thank you for helping me talk this through by the way. I don't really work through problems and examine them from all angles unless there is someone else to reflect ideas off, and you having been through something similar is useful."
adultery,3b08xt,marriedscoundrel,3,Wed Jun 24 23:36:23 2015 UTC,"I lie about...well, everything, really. My alter ego has a different name, age, background, profession, and is of course, single. This is for my protection in more ways than one. The first is that I fundamentally don't trust my APs/people in general. Even if she just knows I have a wife, if she goes digging she can find her and decide to blow me up. That's not some insane paranoia speaking, within the past year there have been two women to post on their sub who did exactly that, one because she was ""annoyed"" at the guy. No matter how good my secret keeping is that's something I wouldn't be able to control.  The second form of protection is emotional. I have zero intention of leaving my wife. If I did, we would/should have divorced by now. Rationally I can reason that of course things are hot and heavy and intense in the beginning, but when you're right in the middle of it, it's harder to keep that rationality. Even now I have an AP where things are amazing and intense, and it would be so easy to start imagining a life with her. What keeps me grounded is the fact that she doesn't really know who I am. And the more intense it gets, the more hurtful that secret becomes, so I can either never tell her who I truly am, or I do and it irreparably damages our relationship. Either way, it prevents us from being more than just APs. My last line of defense against my own emotions."
adultery,3b08xt,marriedscoundrel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:44:02 2015 UTC,"The first part of your post is what I thought of when I found out. Actually thought of you, since I lurk here sometimes and I've seen your posts where you say that before. I've actually told men before that they are being too trusting with me, because some people are very findable online even with just a first name and some personal details. And generally, the easier you to find, the more you have to lose, so I'm occasionally shocked at how cavalier people are. Like, I know I'm a good person and I'm not going to use information maliciously, but some people can and will. So I understand that cautious approach, especially with people you're not close to. But I feel like that falls a little flat if you want to pretend there are emotions involved, since how could you have feelings for someone you realistically believe would screw you over like that?  Your second point, though, I hadn't considered. That's pretty smart and I have to respect it. The thing is, this guy is one of those verbal daydreamers when we talk sometimes. Telling me to get a job in his town and move there, we could date and then when his kids go to college, we'd get married and have kids of our own. I get that it's one of those things people talk about just to talk, that they don't mean it, and I find it fun just to think about it even knowing that I'm not going to leave my relationship and wander off with him. But there is an element to that kind of talk that takes you deeper with a person, and if he wants to keep a barrier up between us, I wish he wouldn't escalate that kind of intimate thinking. I guess it stings because he gets to hold back, and I don't hold back to the same degree because I don't realize he's doing it. Like he has all the cards and I have none and I didn't even realize we were playing this game. It's a fundamentally different approach to cheating than me and my friend take, and I guess it feels unfair. Looking at it from your point of view though, and maybe his, that's a pretty great sacrifice to make in the name of your marriage. It sounds tough and kind of soul crushing. The kind of thing you choose if you have no other choice. If that's his mindset, I do get it. That instinct to protect your relationship from everything, even yourself.  Can I ask you a question? Since you're kind of in a similar position to himI basically found that he was married after I googled his cell number and his name came up (he never told me his last name) and the site listed a 'related person' who turned out to be his wife. Do you think there's a way to frame that when I talk to him about it where it doesn't come off as a massive invasion of privacy? I didn't really do it with any intent, I was just curious and wanted to know a little about his life. I totally bought into everything he said so it wasn't that I didn't trust him. I initially assumed the woman was just his ex-wife, it took a couple days for it to occur to me that I could check her facebook and actually find out. Sooo basically I'm a creepy stalker, and I'm not a good enough poker player to pretend like I'm not (and I just...I don't want to be dishonest with him. Dishonesty is exhausting, as I'm sure you know)."

Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned? Basically emotions are volatile and it makes people unpredictable. I know my wife loves me, but sometimes during an argument the gloves come off and she says some things that are extremely hurtful. And it's not on accident, she knows where the vulnerable spots are and is targeting them. This is the person I married, we promised to spend the rest of our lives together...we made kids together! APs have far less at stake. Even with a strong emotional bond or whatever it'd only take one falling out to bring everything crashing down. And she might instantly regret what she did but regret doesn't turn back the hands of time.    Do you think there's a way to frame that when I talk to him about it where it doesn't come off as a massive invasion of privacy?   Well...it kinda is, honestly. But that's the thing living in the information age, the stock price on privacy has plummeted.   But we all Google people we're interested in, so my suggestion if you want to talk to him about it would be - ""Hey, you know how sometimes, when you get bored or something, you google a person's name to see what turns up? Especially if you really like that person and just want to find out more about them? Well, I googled your phone number, and though it wasn't my intention...I found your wife. Look, I understand why you said what you did. And to be honest I'm a little disappointed, but I'm not angry. But I'm a terrible liar so I just wanted to tell you that I know, and I want for us to keep on as we have been, no changes.""  Something like that, perhaps?"
adultery,3b08xt,livesomelife,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting take. I guess I feel kind of insulted by that since my reaction to being scorned tends to be slink away and deal with it by myself, or talk it over with my most trusted friend (who doesn't even get names if it's about something adultery-related, just to make sure there's no security risks). But. It's tough to really know someone, especially if your time together in person is limited. It's never come up between us before, although I've talked issues through with him before so he knows generally how I am when I'm upset. But if you're constantly hiding your own intentions, you're more likely to suspect others of doing the same. God, I will just make excuses for this guy all day. I must really want to keep him around.   Well...it kinda is, honestly.   Yeah, it's one of those things where I see that now, but I honestly wasn't thinking about it at the time. Just I happened to be looking up another number unrelated to anything, got a good result on a site, and thought, why not look up this guy also. Just did it because I could, it was so early in the morning that I hadn't even had my first cup of coffee and I wasn't really awake. If I could take the whole thing back, honestly I would. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. I think your suggestion is a good one, will probably be stealing big parts of that. Thank you."
adultery,3b08xt,Son_of_Riffdog,3,Thu Jun 25 01:47:31 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you just never know. You may slink away after being scorned, but others may not. You may have a rare moment of vengeance and decide to strike. I guess the bottom line is, for me at least, I have zero control over what you'd do and I'm not comfortable with that. Especially in this game where mistakes simply just aren't an option.   Just did it because I could, it was so early in the morning that I hadn't even had my first cup of coffee and I wasn't really awake. If I could take the whole thing back, honestly I would.   Don't beat yourself up too much over it. Like I said in this day and age you almost trip over personal information. I assume any woman I meet will Google whatever info I give her."
adultery,3b08xt,liguy8719,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:10:23 2015 UTC,"He's reserved but definitely not emotionless. Initially we were both pretty guarded with each other, cautious like you say. I was a little concerned because it became clear early one that he was very intelligent, with a good grasp of how people relate to each other, which gives him tremendous capacity for manipulation. I slowly relaxed and trusted him that he was just being himself and not trying to game me in anyway, and I thought he began to know and trust me as well. I never felt like I wasn't being treated respectfully or with care. I just thought we were equals and now it's clear we weren't, that he had far more of an upper hand than I thought I'd ceded. Not a fair relationship is actually a pretty way of putting it. I guess the choice now is do I try to make it fair? I would hate to lose him completely, he's talked me off the ledge a couple times and I like to think I make him happy too."

adultery,3avpp8,amsosorry,5,Tue Jun 23 23:48:34 2015 UTC,"but for me?   Hoo boy. Let's assume that things go sour.  There's the garden variety stuff, like her finding your wife, and telling her anything from your therapy sessions including things that aren't true.  She can request access your medical records, and that could be a grab bag. That means she knows your address, at least, along with a host of other information.  At the extreme end, there could be involuntary commitment: she could say that you've threatened to harm yourself or others, and that could get you tied up in a mental hospital of some variety for at least 72 hours (in the US and parts of Canada). That one is going to be hard to explain, though she will lose her license and probably face criminal charges.  It's not so much that there's an increased risk that she might do something crazy (though I don't think I've ever met anyone in psych who wasn't also a head case themselves). It's that if she does, there is (probably) so much more damage she can do than the average AP.  Edit to add: Actually, if she's willing to risk her career/credentials over it, she is at least a little crazy. Tiny bit. Man, it's exciting."
adultery,3avpp8,amsosorry,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:18:04 2015 UTC,"So exciting. So very exciting. This is CBT treatment, so it's more to help me deal with my mild-medium anxiety in public, no real mental case here (although this OP proves otherwise...). I think she might be a bit crazy, or at least unorthodox. But I don't think that it's affair type of thing, more of a stint. So I don't think it'll get to the full blown scenario, if it will ever get to any scenario."

She just gets angry and asks me why Im making her drink alone then more angry then calling me names ect...  My Fathers day was my SO and my daughter went out to dinner together so that was fun.   I know where you are coming from.

We had great and happy times together, but I needed more fulfillment, more passion for life, and less dependency on alcohol. I've now run a marathon, dropped 5 dress sizes, have more confidence, happiness, am mastering my musical instrument as a hobby, and just feel I have come to the point where I've achieved all this happiness from within. I no longer have to have someone else to complete me, or use alcohol as a crutch.   My SO has done so much better this week, but still has the neediness, the insecurity, the clinginess, jealousy, and other issues that make me want to run away. He tends to go overboard with extremes of showering me with attention, flowers, love notes, etc, to the opposite, getting hostile and taking offense at everything I say, gas lighting, and drinking until I'm disgusted with him. So right now he's great, but I'm giving it another week or so..."

I am not willing to sacrifice it, however. I don't think this is worth breaking up our family, so I'm gonna go out and get it with other women. In fact I've been doing that for the past couple of years now, just wanted you to know. Let's keep on as we have been. I'd like to say that, but I know that if I did she'd be devastated. I know the reasons why she'd be devastated - half would be assumptions that aren't true, and the other half would be truths she simply doesn't want to face. So rather than kick up that shitstorm it's, sadly, easier to just keep it secret."

With that being said...I made the decision to be with a man  (SO) for every reason BUT sex, which I am realizing now was not too smart. Maybe that decision came from inexperience,  and not realizing the joys of sex before now.  But, whatever. . I'm happier now with the experiences my AP has gifted me with,  then I have ever been.

As a man, nothing is more unappealing than a ""BBW"" (obese woman) who is ""outgoing"" (loud and obnoxious usually). Confidence is quiet. Insecurities are loud.   As a man, I look for a partner who has self respect, and nothing screams disrespect like letting your body go to shit. We have beauty standards and ideals in our culture, and they don't exist to make people feel bad about themselves, they exist for us to aspire to.

I think there is a trend that if a woman has the confidence that she should be able to attract anyone she one she wants and it's the guys loss if he doesn't see how 'sexy' she is. That's simply not true. You like thinner, fit women, there's nothing wrong with that. But maybe go easy on the bbw bashing. Attraction is complex and can be fluid. There's room for everyone to get laid."

Burner emails are a pain to chat with. If you can use the kik app or a similar one. Even the in app messaging on okc and pof are preferable to email."
adultery,3anobm,liguy8719,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:54:12 2015 UTC,Totally agree with the email comment. It is very hard to maintain a conversation and get a feel for personality. I always end up losing interest.
adultery,3an0nn,confusedap,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah i know in my heart that is the only option. I want her to be happy. Just hard to believe that i went from having a loving Fiancee, to an AP i wasn't looking for, to now nothing."
adultery,3an0nn,livesomelife,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:59:02 2015 UTC,I keep asking myself would i do it again and i think i would. Maybe this happened more for my SO than me. She definitely deserves better.   Not sure how i am going to proceed on this
adultery,3an0nn,throwaway_quinn,3,Sun Jun 21 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"WOW ...thank you for the very deep reply, really appreciate it you have helped me so much in getting my thoughts and feelings in order!  Also really appreciate the last 2 paragraphs. I think what you're saying about her being insecure etc is spot on, i was her first everything and we have been together 12 years so she only knows me.   This isn't going to be easy but i knew what i was getting myself into when i started this.  Thanks again for your words and taking the time to type it all up."
adultery,3an0nn,pieh285,2,Sun Jun 21 21:07:11 2015 UTC,If the sex is so bad now before marriage....wait until after. It's non existent.
adultery,3an0nn,alter_ego_1,2,Sun Jun 21 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"Invading Russia in the winter is kind of a bad idea.  You getting married is a terrible idea.  How is supposed to work?  She is supposed to be pleased that you are in love with, and sleeping with, another woman?  Or you are supposed to transfer your affections like you are switching cable providers?  To the degree you are fond of your ""fiancée"", you owe it to her to break it off as cleanly as possible.  To the degree you are not fond of her, why not break it off now and spare yourself the hassle?"
adultery,3anp9s,docholidayNJ,4,Mon Jun 22 00:27:09 2015 UTC,For me anything sexual in the first chapter couple of exchanges would be a turn off. But I've also explicitly stated that I'm looking for a kindof romantic affair. If I had said NSA in my profile it might be diff.  I found with my limited experience that if you start to connect well over the usual stuff then the sexy stuff comes along pretty organically.
adultery,3anp9s,Wineonwed,2,Mon Jun 22 01:49:37 2015 UTC,cums along pretty orgasmically    Fixed that.
adultery,3anp9s,Throw-away-4-days,2,Mon Jun 22 03:31:11 2015 UTC,"For me, I like it when sex is included in the conversation sooner rather than later. I like to have a more physical relationship with an AP rather than a more emotional relationship. I tend to lose interest if we're not including sex in our conversations early on."
adultery,3anp9s,boredintheburbs,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:33:27 2015 UTC,Those are the best kind of APs!!!
adultery,3anp9s,boredintheburbs,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"Within the second or third message I offer to share me ideas for how a time spent together would go (they all say yes) then provide a canned answer I wrote (based on my own style so no deception) that I know gets a lot of mileage. I don't even give the whole thing, I have certain section breaks after a few paragraphs and ask them if they'd like me to go on."
adultery,3anp9s,Son_of_Riffdog,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:49:55 2015 UTC,For me it would depend on how sexy her pics were but I would take my lead from her messages. She is probably messaging with a few guys so going slow is generally not a good plan. What I do is try to arrange for a meeting as soon as practical so that I can verify that her pictures are legitimate and to see what develops. That also lets you know whether she is looking for something long term or a quickie in the car at lunch.
adultery,3anp9s,throwawaystowaway116,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:11:18 2015 UTC,"I prefer to wait to get racy until we move the conversation to email or kik. I enjoy dick pics, but I don't necessarily like seeing them on AM. Also, most guys are notoriously bad at taking dick pics - they take them in the bathroom, and my eye is immediately drawn to the empty toilet paper roll or his SO's hair care products in the background! If you can banter with me for awhile, in a way that is intriguing and appealing to me, I'm pretty confident we will be sexually compatible. I believe most women really want to be courted, even if just a little bit... before the ""Hey, u want 2 fuck?"" messages start coming..."
adultery,3aojdz,lovingmartian,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"Sigh. I don't know if he will be back. I am literally in almost the exact same situation, but I'm assuming mine won't be back. I've left the door ajar, but I have told him I'm not checking my ""mischief"" email because I have to stop myself from re-reading every damn email from the past few months, dissecting the missteps which led us to this point. (He claims I want more than he can give me.) He said he needed ""time to think."" We're no contact right now, by my choice. I told him he can text me when he's ready, and that I'm willing to wait a few weeks, but if I don't hear from him, I will move on. Honestly, I need the time to think, too. I'm starting to think after almost 2 years, it has run its course. His story is that he feels like I deserve more than he can give me. And while I agree, to a point, I certainly do not want him to leave his SO or anything. It's been almost a week since we went 'no contact', and I'm 99% certain it's over. I'm still numb, though. I dread the moment it hits me. The reality is that I miss him like crazy. Just trying to stay busy, and not think about him."
adultery,3aojdz,throwawaystowaway116,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:09:47 2015 UTC,If you figure out how to stay busy and not think about him will you share how to do that with us? :/

adultery,3amm8m,Not_keeping_this,5,Sun Jun 21 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"For me, five-star sex is possible in a two-star hotel.  There are many variables but I'd bet your planning and flirting up until the moment will make it perfect for him."
adultery,3amm8m,SweetD08,3,Sun Jun 21 19:13:05 2015 UTC,I guess I should stress less. The room really isn't the most important thing.
adultery,3amm8m,NotHisMrs,4,Sun Jun 21 20:40:53 2015 UTC,"I'll admit my last AP and I went to a slightly shady place on the regular. I was a bit bothered the first time, especially since he was pretty well off, but in the end it was perfect. 30min drive for each of us, not strict about check in and out times, took cash, and we never had to worry about running into anyone we knew. Plus, once the door closed, where we were didn't matter as much as the fact we were there together. They actually got to expecting him since we always went on the same day."
adultery,3amm8m,docholidayNJ,3,Sun Jun 21 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"Considering the costs of having an affair if hotels/motels are a part of your regular 'thing', I don't think any AP should be overly picky. A clean room in a decent neighbourhood is more than reasonable. It's nice to spring for a nicer place occasionally, but what you're proposing sounds perfectly fine.   Besides, he'll forget all about the puke green carpets the second he sees you laid out for him anyway ;)"
adultery,3amm8m,docholidayNJ,2,Sun Jun 21 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"There are a few fairly nice places in the are that aren't over priced but we won't be getting a five star treatment by any means. I think you are right though, he will probably be happy just to have me."
adultery,3amm8m,alter_ego_1,3,Sun Jun 21 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"First hotel date should be in the nicest place he can pull off.  I don't care if the first date was a little pricey.  If I was the guy, I would totally be ok with paying for a nice 4 star hotel in a great location.  You only get one shot at first impressions in bed.  Crappy rooms, lumpy beds, and worries about if your car is going to be there when you leave do not make for a great first time.  That is, unless you are into that sort of thing."
adultery,3amm8m,pieh285,2,Sun Jun 21 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"He would have taken care of it no questions asked, but I offered. Not just because he paid for the date but also because he has never done anything like this before and I don't want him slipping up and getting caught, especially before we even get to have some fun.   I will definitely go somewhere safe and clean, but I'm not going to worry too much. I think he'll be pretty happy."
adultery,3amm8m,PentharMull,3,Sun Jun 21 20:16:05 2015 UTC,I know I'd be pretty damn happy if my new AP was taking the lead and booking us a room.  Hope you have a fantastic time.
