They attach emotions to prayer, and experience those emotions when praying. I imagine that sometimes saying something out loud, or pretending to say it to another person, can be comforting."
TrueAtheism,3dyx3w,NaturalSelectorX,13,Mon Jul 20 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is my take too. I remember when I was 10 and 11 I would stare at the ceiling at night and pray. It would be very cathartic to voice my fears and insecurities and think that a benevolent, omnipotent being was listening to me, and would perhaps answer me.  It wasn't until after doing this for a few months and never seeing any tangible differences in my life and the world that I started questioning the power of prayer. Then it kind of morphed into asking god to give me some sort of sign that he was there, listening and cared. A few more months go by and then it kind of hits me like a ton of bricks that maybe I'm just talking to myself, that I never had a feeling that there was something on the other end of my conversation, I just wanted there to be something. At that point I just started living my life with the assumption that there isn't some personal all-powerful being watching over us and nothing I've experienced since has changed that."
TrueAtheism,3dyx3w,Griffonian,15,Tue Jul 21 01:09:05 2015 UTC,"IMO, you are confusing words there. Replace ""hear"" by ""feel"" and you will be closer to what actually happens. The mere act of praying (asking to a supernatural hierarchy) calms people for evolutionary reasons (it's a little long to explain but as we are social animals, pleading to hierarchies instead of revolting helped social cohesion, for short); once the act of pleading is done (and in earnest, meaning being submissive and recognizing a higher ""chief"") we have an emotion we evolved called ""hope"" that allowed us to wait even in the face of hardships, we ""feel"" someone is in charge and will deliver. With hope humans are able to endure and do impossible tasks for animals that don't have such soothing emotion. For many people this step alone is enough as it is a strong emotion, specially is it is well ""trained"" or ""induced"", and religions usually are invested with that very function among others. If there is a response (the expected one, a closer one or even an ""attributed"" one) our brains are prepared to strengthen the bond with said hierarchy. If there is not, usually the resort is to increase the pleading and therefore, increase the hope (and then increase the illusion of some ""form"" of response, a mental suggestion). If things get even harsher, there is when the bonds begin to break, as the social relationships are maintained by mutual providence; people usually whether topple failed hierarchies or revolt to favor others that they expect to deliver. In religious terms this is when schisms, new religions, etcetera, happen, as a new hierarchical ""pact"" (with the supernatural) is needed; very few are able to break free from the pact with the supernatural hierarchies to invest themselves (or a correspondent ideology, etc) as a replacement.   Back to the beginning: some people (you) rarely or don't enter the ""hope"" phase; they expect an immediate response to what they ask. In this case maybe you were lead to think that God would actually talk to you somehow. Usually others that are more invested into the praying-pleading process may even enter into enough suggestion as to actually think that God responded them somehow, and in extreme cases, talked to them (like a vivid dream). On the other side, those who are that uneasy and more in touch with their external perceptions usually are of the dominant type (what doesn't grant automatically being able to command, but that is another question) and instead of follow the pleading feedback they tend to look to escalate the social level as to have some direct touch with the good stuff. In the case of gods, usually these people become part of the religious class (not to confuse with the lower level priests who may be as dispossessed as other commoners). In your case you became your own chief by becoming atheist (and learning and adopting those things that helped sustain an atheistic worldview).   As you mentioned, religious people generally aren't that dumb or are compulsive liars, but they understand reality through the filter of emotions what gives them quite an ample range to interpret anything as an actual physical response from God. Reality, in humans, is a conceptual interpretation: bending it to make it fit the gods' hierarchical responses is what have made them (the gods or supernatural beings) stay with humans through their evolutionary history."

It is likely that prayer causes the devout to enter an altered state of consciousness in which they are less aware of what thoughts are internal and which are external, leading to the experience of hearing the voice of God."

TrueAtheism,3dyx3w,GaryOster,4,Tue Jul 21 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"People praying in public are hearing their own insecurities and feelings of inadequacy reflected and amplified by the social setting they are in.   People praying in private are basically projecting their desires onto a mental image they have formed (Jesus, Shiva, their Ancestors, etc). It is rather rare for a person to kneel down and pray for good health, and return with their head hanging low saying ""I heard a voice that says I may have chlamydia"". The prayers always answer themselves. There is very little chance that they are actually experiencing auditory hallucinations (and no chance of any real divine communication) because the messages are always the same. Auditory hallucinations aren't a convenient thing that crops up when your head is bowed and your hands are clasped. They don't give us serene peaceful messages. The closest these 'voices' ever come to being believable is when the message is ""Be patient and it will be so"". Essentially, the supplicant knows that the prayer is futile in the present but wants to believe it is possible in the future.   I severely doubt that 0.5% of the religious folks actually feel like they are communicating with anything. Most of them know that they are just thinking with two voices. Just like we all do when we mentally chastise ourselves for doing something dumb in public.    ""Great fookin' job Timmy. Way to blow it with Jess. Everything was perfect and you had to pick that moment to crack that stupid fookin' joke, din'tcha? Shit, Timmy, if you can't get this simple relationship straight, why even bother?""    This is his inside voice scolding himself. It is how we think. Thought without words doesn't go very far. It is not a hallucination. It is not a holy ghost. It is not his great grandfather frowning upon one of the many failures of his genetic material, named Timmy.   That was all the private prayer bit.  As for praying in public? I will demonstrate to you what happens with a thought experiment.    We are now in a great palace of indulgence and debauchery. It is opulent and lavish. There is a big congregation here to rejoice the great powers of the Almighty Dong. In our experiment, the supplicants are all male. The Arch-Dong (a wise and holy man) regales the congregation with a sermon. He speaks of how true worship of the Almighty Dong is to bow your head, unclasp thy buckles, peep into thy trousers and watch it grow bigger than you've ever seen before. Then he leads the congregation into prayer and they all perform the ritual, and lo, each one of them lets out a gasp of amazement. It is bigger than ever! Oh Dong Almighty!    This brings us to the end of our experiment.  Hope you enjoyed that ride. Now does anyone care to guess how many of those little willies actually grew into big dongs? Well, whatever percentage of those you thought, divide that by a hundred for an answer to what percent actually hear anything during prayer (aside from the peer pressure to hear something). Why divide by hundred? Because some willies actually get random boners, the air might be cold, and some people are exhibitionists and might get a thrill out of doing willy-staring in public.  So by my count, pretty much everyone who thinks of 'prayer' as anything more than ""quiet time with my own thoughts"" (aka meditation) is either deluding themselves, or flat out lying to compensate for something they feel others do experience, or both.   No, they are not hallucinating. They are not having visions. They are not 'feeling' something or attaching emotions to feelings, like some people said (all feelings have emotions attached - if I feel like being an arse to people, you can bet my emotional state reads: ""pretty damn pissed off""). They have not been possessed by the trinity. They are hearing either deafening silence, or their own 'thinking voice' where they occasionally might spawn a half-decent idea... or, you know... decide to invade Iraq."

It's a kind of focus where I have something on my mind I'm not sure what to do about, clear my mind, and pray (which I understand now as asking myself), ""What should I do?,"" or something similar.  An answer would come immediately. The answer was not a usually (or initially) voice, but an awareness - which I would describe as the first thing that came mind. When it was a voice it was my own, just like when I'm thinking or reading in my own voice.  I'm pretty sure that's what people are usually talking about when they say they hear the voice of god, something similar to people suggesting it's a feeling - it's intuition, subconscious, inner voice, etc. as opposed to thinking."

I so desperately wanted to believe in God, to be a good person and to not be found out as a fraud.  It was during a very dark time in my life and I desperately needed to believe that someone was looking out for me and loved me.

Often times we go too far, and detect agency when there is none.  Was that just the wind or a dangerous predator?  We evolved to ""be safe rather than sorry.""  A false positive has a neutral result, but a false negative can lead to death or harm, so natural selection favored genes which assigned more agency to more things.

This makes  the RC in my opinion a more "" useful"" church than the protestants since what is the point  of  religion if it isn't to make people behave in better ways?   The problem of course is that the RC became hideously corrupt, and good works became essentially a way for the RC to extract wealth and power from  its parishioners at a time when it was basically the institution that held  europe together.   This corruption was precisely the reason why the people who carried out the reformation  kicked out  good works from their  doctrine. Instead they embraced solae fidae "" salvation from  faith ( sometimes grace) alone"". I cannot think of a single  protestant church in the United States ( with the possible exception of the RC- lite episcopal church  and the creedless disciples of christ, and these are only guesses as to possible exceptions)  that do not adhere to solae fidae. The refrain heard time and time and time again is that   good works will not save you, only faith in christ.   Now it is true that once you "" become"" a christian in these faiths you are expected to conform to the moral norms. But this  is not how you are saved, to the contrary they are a "" symptom"" of your salvation. You show to others that you are saved BY behaving according to the strictures, but it is NOT the behavior that saves you.   If you later on say  commit a major grave sin and are unrepentant, most of these christians will say that you "" were never truly saved to begin with"".

First, they were supposed to guide the spiritual development of the child and second, if something happened to the parents, they were supposed to take care of the child.  Obviously, meaning #2 no longer applies. Nowadays, CPS would decide (though often godparents would be family members and CPS would go there first).  As for meaning #1, None of it is binding but the OP has the opportunity to choose to be a positive older influence as the child grows.

It means that I'll be an important person, perhaps some kind of role model, in that kid's life. If you take it seriously, it's a responsibility; not a huge one, mind you, but a responsibility nonetheless. Making sure the kid grows up with a good sense of ethics, of doing the right thing and thinking critically. You'll be that kid's conscience! How great is that!  And if the kid's parents dislike having someone teaching their child to think logically by himself, well, sucks to be them, they chose the wrong godfather.

So honestly, why not? Unless you feel really strongly about it.  Regarding renouncing the church--I haven't done it yet. It's too much work to do and in the end it doesn't matter. It's not like here in Finland (my adoptive country) where being part of the church means 1% of your paycheck is donated to them every month. That's why they can easily renounce the church through a website. I'd have to write a letter to... someone? The guy who baptized me?

Personally, I would make my stance clear on what religious activities I would not participate in, and if they wanted further reasons why, I would discuss it with them.

I'm now 22, and I've leveled out into who I think I'll be for the rest of my life. Christianity, or any religion for that matter, can be a force to bring people together or drive them apart. It can be a source of guilt or solace. It depends on what you're raised with, how you feel, and who you are.  I did not renounce anything officially. The closest I got was changing my Facebook religion thingy. I have no desire to renounce anything because baptism means nothing to me, nor should it to you. It's meaningless without a God to worry about. I'd vote for you to just go your own way as far as faith or a lack thereof, but don't alienate anyone if you can avoid it. My general way of looking at life is this: Don't be a twat. If you can brighten someone's day, go for it. If they're twats, it's whatever. You do you. Just try to increase the net happiness in the world. That's it.  Now, following that idea, there's no real good to come from renouncing anything. I still close my eyes and hold hands during grace at family meals, I just remain silent. I attend Christmas parties and such, and I just try to adopt a little extra cheer-- not for any theological reason. Just for the happiness of it.  This post is becoming longer than I wanted it to.

My advice that most of reddit shares is wait until you're financially independent and no longer living at home until you fully tell your parents. Suck it up, go to church, if you can't handle that then find reasonable excuses not to go like extracurricular activities, sit quietly when everyone else prays, nod along when they talk about God. I've been there, it sucks but it's way better than fending for yourself at 16 or having your parents constantly questioning you and making life miserable.   I'm 25 and have been an atheist since I was about 14. I knew my parents would flip out so I just kept my head down and found support through friends and online atheist communities. If you can at least wait until college, it gets a lot better since you won't be home as much and can get away from it all.   Not sure about Catholicism, but at least in my church being a godparent is no big deal, technically you're supposed to help raise her in a Christian lifestyle and take over if something happens to your parents but wills and legal custody trump that and honestly most people I know don't even remember who their godparents were anymore, its really just a formality.

Religion exerts its controlling influence over every aspect of life, from relationships to business practices to diet. It feeds upon its own adherents, through tithing, taxes and donations, often with a bonus guilt trip as incentive. It frequently leads to conquering of entire cultures, through assimilation or threat of harm.  The coping mechanism aspect for individual believers is only the psychological impetus being exploited for all of the above goals, and more. Fear, guilt and shame are extremely powerful tools.  People often talk about the ""moderate"" and ""good [insert religion of choice here] individuals"", but every dollar they donate or tithe, every show of support by attending church, every family member or friend or child they influence to do the same, it all legitimizes and props up the corrupt and damaging system.

So far only my wife has been implying that a divine appeal is an appropriate course of action.  Odd, because she knows as well as anyone that's not my style.    Prior to surgery this past Monday, I was asked if there were any beliefs or practices that would conflict with the planned treatment.  That aside, no one offered any prayers which I found reassuring.  It felt like I was being treated by people that dealt with reality.  A melanoma was removed from my cheek along with a couple of nearby lymph nodes.  I'll get the biopsy results on Monday while they're removing the 30-odd stitches.

TrueAtheism,3dp5bg,Insergentes,4,Sat Jul 18 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"In these atheist subreddits, we tend to focus a lot on the faith surrounding religion, but I don't see a lot of focus on the practice of religion.  The thing is, religion has an answer for what you should do in this kind of difficult situation, and it's surprisingly not a bad one.  What should you do?  How should you feel?  Well, there's a guide for that -- religion tells you to do what your people have done for generations, which is to pray, sometimes in some particular way with some particular words.  So instead of being lost, you have a direction.  As atheists, we don't have any gods to provide this direction or to comfort us when we don't understand why something is happening (because there is no why, generally), but you know, religion is actually still there.  There's no need to believe in fairy tales, even if you say religious words that reference them.  They're (mostly) empty actions, but they're actions nonetheless, and that's actually a good thing to have.  For example, in Judaism, when someone in your family dies, there's a thing you do.  You cover mirrors, sit in low chairs for a week, and have people bring you food.  You also say kaddish.  Without believing in the religion's god, kaddish might be a bit meaningless, since it's all about glorifying this god.  But eh, so?  It does have meaning, which is honoring the memory of the deceased.  There's a set of things to do.  Maybe you can come up with better things to do.  That's good!  If you don't believe in tradition, then you might as well do your own thing.  Why not?  Well, the reason why not is that tradition has been at it a long time and these particular actions have been well-tested.  And if your event -- whether it's a misfortune like a death or diagnosis, or a great thing like a wedding or a birth -- doesn't happen all that often, and if it's a misfortune we all hope that it's rare, well, it's not like you have practice.  This is why there are all sorts of rituals.  Fireworks and cookouts on the 4th of July (if you're American), turkey on Thanksgiving, a fight song when your team scores in football, a secret handshake when your trivia team gets full points on a question, honoring Chronos on Daylight Savings, etc.  Shit happens, whether it's good or bad, and because of these rituals, you know what to do.  And that makes dealing with it much easier.  Doesn't even have to be religious."
TrueAtheism,3dp5bg,xiipaoc,2,Sat Jul 18 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"religious belief is little more than a soothing lie told to those without the intellectual and emotional strength to handle a life of random events.   Soothing lie? It's not really that soothing to be told that ""god's will be done"". I mean I get how Hallmark card Christianity could be soothing but don't forget the fire and brimstone.  I mean: imagine you were a Christian and things turned out shitty. In that case: great, you are dying of cancer plus you have plenty of good reasons to have a crisis of faith. Everyone telling you its God will and now your in pain and having literally the worse time of your life. Perfect!  And the eternal soul is actually just terrifying the more you think about it.  So my point is that religion can't be simplified as just being an emotional crutch, mostly because it is terrible at it. It is a worldview that people use to make sense of things. Even if you ignore the ""it's wrong"" part, I don't it is great at making sense of things even from a utilitarian perspective.  PS Fuck cancer."

This encapsulates my primary problem with religion. Solace in God's will.  The atheist sees the problem as one that requires some lifestyle changes and effort in order to mitigate unpleasant consequences. The choices of today impacts the results of tomorrow. Furthermore, the personal responsibility for a better future resides solely with the atheist.  For the religious person, prayer is how one avoids those same unpleasant consequences. He could also make those same lifestyle changes, but more often than not, the solace found in prayer alleviates the need to change one's habits.  ""God's will"" controls his future consequences. It absolves the personal responsibility for the future results of today's choices.  If it just so happens that the least effort of prayer means that the habits of today don't have to change in order to obtain a new and better consequence tomorrow, so much the better."

I wish I could honestly say the same, but to tell the truth I don't know if I'll ever get completely beyond these occasional terrified moments where I'm overwhelmed by the horror of it all and really wish there was some kind of higher power or afterlife.  I used to be religious, and I feel like you hit the nail on the head here.  There was I time when I was just too weak to go on without hope of something greater, and it kept me at least semi-functional.  I'm not sure I should be ashamed of that as some here are suggesting.  I didn't have that strength of mind, and it wasn't really my fault.  Without assurance of a proper happy ending, I only wanted to die.  I have grown beyond that now, and I am very glad I had a chance to.  I think this understanding can at least help some atheists have more empathy for believers, and that's a good thing.  However, I certainly think those believers still need to get it through their thick skulls that they need to stop bothering other people with different beliefs-- even as a churchgoer I felt it made a lot more sense to 'leave that up to god'.  Their need for a security blanket I am totally okay with on the other hand, just as with a literal special blanket for a child, and for some (like me) it turns out to pretty much just be a phase anyhow."

TrueAtheism,3dp5bg,theomorph,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"So your feel that your outlook was confirmed, they feel that theirs was confirmed, and nobody fell apart. Seems to me the difference isn't strength, but method and interpretation. Most of us have methods for riding out the bad times. Your method here was to interpret events as manifesting ""the random nature of the world"" and then to conform your state of mind to that. Your loved ones' method was to interpret events as manifesting ""God's will"" and then to conform their state of mind to that.  And I don't think those interpretations are really too far apart. There is no god. But the world isn't random, either—it's filled with structure, even repeatable structure, which is why science works. And, as you know, your medical condition also isn't random, but the result of real causes, even if some of them haven't been identified. When you and your family encountered something for which there was no satisfactory explanation—where the causes weren't fully identified—you all called upon an interpretation of the world that allowed you to maintain your composure against that unknowing. You all found strength in something that isn't true.  And I don't think that's terrible, even speaking as an atheist. We're always brushing up against uncertainties and unknowns (and unknowables); if we only allowed ourselves to think the things that are fully certain and known, we'd never get anywhere. We all fill the gaps with stories, just to get through the day—and especially in dire situations like yours. Your story is the meaningful assertion that nothing has a purpose and your loved ones' story is the meaningless assertion that God has a purpose in everything. I like yours a little better than theirs, but I don't think it's fair of you to say that you're the stronger one, just for that.  The real problems happen when people in much different circumstances mistake their stories for knowledge, fail to understand the importance of doubt, and then make a habit of doing harm in service of their undue certainty."

It doesn't tell us how to live, it doesn't explain much about our reason or what happens after death or how morality works or anything like that. It's a single answer to a single question... and therefore isn't a fundamental part of you, other than as a recognition of an absence.  So, your relative perspectives on religion cannot be equally important to each of you, since his shapes him and yours is functionally defined by its lack of shaping of you.  Having said that, there is still a certain level of respect for his (I assume) open-mindedness in reading your blog and keeping it to himself, presumably to understand you. Or perhaps he just likes the writing of the blog more than the content, and is interested in your writing skills and approach. Have you asked him what he's getting from your blog?

You can very much choose how to feel, it just takes practice. Don't believe me? Try smiling for a few minutes and see how you feel - the act of smiling triggers muscle memory and releases neurotransmitters associated with feeling happy. Or for choosing to feel sad, actors, for example, can cry on command. It's all about practice."

TrueAtheism,3ddl4c,BlooregardQKazoo,5,Wed Jul 15 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"Being happy, sad, guilty, angry, regretful, etc. are all personal choices.   Psychology 101 says you're wrong. They are normal emotions which are experienced by everyone as a result of events in their lives. You don't control emotions. They are physiological responses to stimuli.   Sometimes, they are medical issues. Your statement suggests that I should simply choose to no longer suffer from depression."
TrueAtheism,3ddl4c,theillien,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:42:05 2015 UTC,"Understanding psychology is precisely what enables me to say that emotions can be personally determined. Of course they're involuntary, but they're also not magic. You can definitely alter your mood at will. There is a science to it.  You can't choose not to suffer depression, true, but what I'm saying is you can affect your internal biochemistry with practice such that you mitigate negative responses. In fairness, depression isn't an emotion - it's an affective disorder, usually requiring treatment."
TrueAtheism,3ddl4c,Mikesapien,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"I think that ""being happy"" is a state that transcends emotions. It's kind of like depression. Depression doesn't necessarily mean you are ""sad"" per se.   Maintaining a positive outlook comes from being able to deal with sadness, anger, guilt, regret, etc.   It doesn't mean ignoring those feelings in order to say that ""i am happy, because I am not sad.""  In order to be truly happy, you need to be able to be sad, and understand that it is not a bad thing to be sad, but that you know you can come out of it and be happy again.  Maintaining a positive outlook comes from being able to do that. Not from just ""trying to be happy"" when you are not. In fact, attempting that may even lead to psychological problems, repression, avoidance, feelings of guilt, and depression. There is a cognitive dissonance between how you actually feel deep down, and how you're trying to act, or how you are told you should feel."

TrueAtheism,3ddl4c,Tedesche,3,Thu Jul 16 04:28:23 2015 UTC,"Clinical narcissism is about more than just having an inflated view of yourself—which, alone, is basically just arrogance. People in a bout of mania can have inflated views of themselves via delusions of grandiosity, but it's not narcissism. Narcissism is very specifically when said inflated self-view serves as a defense against privately-held views of oneself that are the polar opposite: extremely negative. The narcissist puts on airs in an attempt to prove to both himself and everyone else that his deep, dark, horrible views of himself aren't true, and he typically requires constant affirmation from others to support this defense structure. An arrogant person who doesn't respond defensively to a person who doesn't affirm their inflated view of himself likely isn't a narcissist. Narcissists need others to go along with their act, and typically get extremely angry, defensive, and sometimes depressed if they don't; arrogant people who aren't narcissists don't require such support—their inflated self-view is not an ego defense, and is likely the result of other factors.   In this case, for example, the girl in the OP might hold the view that only people of her religion can be truly happy as a way of dealing with the question of why she chooses her particular religion, when there's really no objectively good reason to pick it over others. It's a defense against threats to her religious identity, but not necessarily her sense of self-worth overall. The belief that only those of her religion can be truly happy is still a defense, just not a narcissistic one."

I began with a historical perspective with questions like, ""what was going on in other parts of the world, like China, when god made the hebrews his chosen people?""   I again gained some perspective when I began looking at other cultures and faith traditions. When you look at how deeply and sincerely Muslims and Buddhists worship, meditate and study you gain perspective on your own life.   When you study the history of the church and early Christianity and the arguments going on about the nature of God within it, you gain perspective and realize that our current ideas about the Bible have developed over time.   When you consider that the ancient Greeks worshipped their gods with faithfulness and they added value and understanding to their lives just like religious folks today, and the same goes for the Egyptians and many many other ancient cultures, you gain perspective.   Billions and billions of people had different ideas about humanity and the divine and lived and died with different traditions. They experienced joy and sorrow and strived together and were content together and experienced sincere happiness in their lives. Billions and billions over many thousands of years.  Now I've found that modern American Evangelicals seem to have the least amount of perspective about the rest of the world, or even fellow Americans in other denominations. They're deeply connected to their holy-rolling, tongue-speaking worship and can't imagine bliss can be gotten any other way. They're insulated within a small cultural subset of Christianity and for some reason can't understand others outside of it... yet this particular denomination or expression of faith is relatively new in history. Are we to assume they've finally figured it out after all these years? It's hubris."

TrueAtheism,3ddl4c,ertger,5,Wed Jul 15 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"Mostly from readings in the Bible. The first Pope of the Catholic Church is Simon Peter, which is established by Jesus.  Some of the things Jesus told Simon Peter:  ""And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.""  ""I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.""  ""Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?"" ""Yes, Lord,"" he said, ""you know that I love you.""  Jesus said, ""Feed my lambs. ""Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"" He said to Him, ""Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.""  He said to him, ""Shepherd My sheep.""  He said to him the third time, ""Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"" Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, ""Do you love Me?"" And he said to Him, ""Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You."" Jesus said to him, ""Tend My sheep.""  Peter's church will survive against hell.   Peter gets the Keys to Kingdom( hence the logo of the church).  Jesus commands Peter no less than three times:""Hey Peter, you love me right? Then look after my followers.""  All the other thousands of versions of Protestant-Christianity, like fundamentalism, Mormonism, 7th day Adventists, baptists, anabaptists, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Amish, etc. etc. were started by men with no guarantees. Jesus will only underwrite and insure the Catholic church from the perils of hell, the rest of the denominations are on their own."

TrueAtheism,3ddl4c,ertger,2,Wed Jul 15 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"My two cents:   what Jesus says to Peter is only valid for him   So Jesus only wanted the Church to be valid for a few years while Peter was alive ? After that, its a free-for-all ? Why wouldn't Jesus want his own Church to continue, why would he abandon the Church he started through Peter ?   the catholic church is validating itself through its very own doctrine with no biblical foundation.   Where is the biblical foundation for your pop's word-of-faith pastorship ? (Not trying to imply your dad is uneducated in the Bible.)   Jesus didn't tell his 12 apostles ""Guys, everyone must decide for himself how to interpret the word of God. Just wing it. If you get some stuff wrong, its ok. I'm not going to establish an official church or anything.""  Also there's Paul letter to the Ephesians where he states:  ""There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;  One Lord, one faith(emphasis mine), one baptism,  One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.""  I always think back to the Old Testament, where you have the uncompromising and unwavering God of Israel being extremely strict in his criteria for worship (He burned up Aaron's son's for improper worship in the tabernacle). This same God is the Father of Jesus and He will demand to be worshiped and interpreted the way  He wants it. He wants Peter's church as his authorized method of worship, you think I am going to stand in his way ?"

His def is related to optimism more than ""true happiness,"" and most people would agree, happiness and optimism are two different things. His assertion, ""X person must be lying,"" cannot be proven. He has no way of knowing whether someone claiming to be ""truly happy"" is lying or not. Furthermore, there are numerous Christians who claim to be happy but are actually lying, like, for example, my father - an evangelical Christian and lifelong sufferer of depression. How does your friend account for the tens of millions -possibly billions- of human beings who lived and died before Christ? Were they all not ""truly happy?"" Surely some of them lived fulfilling lives; it's probabilistically impossible for them not to have done. How does your friend account for various studies that indicate no correlation between religion and happiness? If he is right, shouldn't Christians score higher than other faiths? Are the researchers and participants ""lying"" too? If so, can he prove it? Are their methods wrong? Does he have an alternative model for studying religion and happiness? Even if we suppose that your friend's assertion is true (which it clearly isn't), that wouldn't mean Christianity, or his interpretation thereof, are true or correct. No one said truth makes you happy; on the contrary, misery is sometimes a consequence of pursuing truth and following evidence.   Hope this helps. I have a Bachelor's in Psychology, and have studied happiness to a certain extent, so I find your friend's line of argument troubling for a number of reasons, both philosophically and scientifically.

TrueAtheism,3ddl4c,inopedouttathere,2,Wed Jul 15 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that his definition of true happiness is a rather naive one. Hardly anyone is able to stay calm, or feel anything but sorrow during a time of great personal tragedies. He also defines happiness in a very trivial manner. What is a great personal tragedy for your friend is an every day occurrence for many. I cannot know for sure, but I seriously doubt religion or the idea of any god helps you permanently overcome those issues, let alone eradicate them. On top of that, religion seems to both directly and indirectly cause a large amount of the same personal tragedies.  I would't argue that you cannot be a truly happy atheist, but I must state that it feels like a perpetual struggle that shows no signs of ending, but a struggle worth going through. Atheist don't get the bliss of ignorance and the joy that comes with lack of critical thinking. We want wisdom and knowledge which can't be found in thousand books, let alone one. If in return we have to start our journey with a smaller amount of happiness, I say we go for it. We will get plenty of it by acquiring knowledge and wisdom from books, texts, and discovering new things using scientific methods and critical thinking. Compared to that, religion seems like a sinister shortcut to happiness, it requires no work while providing for all the reward one might hope for.  P.S. Despite what the majority of the people in this thread say, I advise you not to stop arguing with someone just because they are stubborn or unwilling to change their mind. It is a great way to get a new perspective on your own opinions as well as, with a lot of effort, change a friends life for the better."

Well, philosophically, you can't be an atheist without someone else positing theism. Atheism is the rejection of theism. Someone had to claim God existed before someone claimed it didn't. Although, you're right. Someone can be an atheist in a practical sense without ever confronting theistic thought.    I haven't rejected anything so I don't attach life's meaning to it.   Atheism is a negative claim. It makes the claim that some other thing does not exist, namely God. The point is, whether you ever knew about claims of God or not (both philosophical and practical atheism), you do not have a guiding purpose or meaning given to you. You start out with the default position of ""life is meaningless"". If you do not engage nihilism, as I described in the OP, your life will not have any meaning."

I suppose you could be saying that if someone feels like their meaning and purpose in life comes from their religion, then a rejection of their religion would lead to them losing their meaning and purpose. I can agree with that. Though the obvious solution is to communicate meanings and purposes that don't depend on their religion. I don't really follow the logic of Nietzsche in this post; it seems like he's positing virtue theories without justification.

It seems the assumption being made is that all meaning and purpose in life comes from religion, and I don't know what justification there is for saying that.   This is entirely possible, but what it tells me is that you have already confronted nihilism in an existential manner prior to considering theism. Obviously, for people who are deconverting from theism, this is a much more difficult task.   I suppose you could be saying that if someone feels like their meaning and purpose in life comes from their religion, then a rejection of their religion would lead to them losing their meaning and purpose. I can agree with that.   Yes, this is what I was saying explicitly in my OP, but like I just said, I admit that it doesn't necessarily have to happen in the case of growing up without any religion to begin with. Even for people who are raised as atheists, a large number experience existential crises and turn to religion. Of course, I think we can both agree that this is an unnecessary move, but that's besides the point.   I don't really follow the logic of Nietzsche in this post; it seems like he's positing virtue theories without justification.   Nietzsche's view of morality is confusing to be sure. The way that I interpret it is that Nietzsche views the one moral rule as ""live life honestly"". To Nietzsche, this goes to embracing the ""experience"" of life. Much of Nietzsche's views on the matter stem from his will to power philosophy.   To respond directly to your comment, Nietzsche doesn't think that morality (or anything else for that matter) is entirely grounded in logic. We have to engage our being and choose something. Ultimately, that something that Nietzsche thinks we should strive for are virtues that make us greater. This isn't necessarily a logical answer, but Nietzsche doesn't think logic has primacy in this sort of issue. To Nietzsche the ""justification"" is in one's experience. Nietzsche thinks we have to acknowledge the emotional and passionate part of us deep down and that this is ultimately why life continues on. Nietzsche calls this the ""Dionysian"" aspect of us that upholds life even in the face of tragedy and apparent nihilism. He ultimately does believe in upholding these ""life-affirming"" virtues."

Nietzsche does, in fact, use plenty of logic, but on a fundamental level he doesn't believe that life is an entirely logical thing. Think about it this way... I'm sure you've done things that weren't logically justified. For example, having sex because it feels good, loving someone because it felt right, watching a sunset because it is beautiful, watching your favorite tv show, choosing cereal or oatmeal for breakfast, etc. The point is, in questions of value, we have to examine what it means to be human and what drives us. We must accept that what drives us is not always logical and that sometimes, we must cater to our natural desires. Personally, I think that Nietzsche comes pretty close to the truth about life, but I don't think anyone has the absolute truth. Sartre and Camus also have a lot of practical stuff to say about meaning in life as well."

Mormonism (LDS) is a significant-sized YEC religion that teaches creationism but not everlasting torment. It's my understanding that Mormons don't believe in the fiery, painful hell, but rather a place called 'the outer darkness' which is a place lacking light and god. The only way to get there is to have a perfect understanding of god, to 100% KNOW he exists and is the true god, and then reject him. Other than that, there is a holding-type place that everyone goes to while they wait for the second coming of jesus and his reign on Earth. Once that passes, everyone is sorted into one of three levels of heaven. The lowest level is for your regular murderers, rapists, etc. The middle level is for non-mormon good people and lazy mormons. And the highest is for the people who were 'good' mormons during their time on Earth. You might be thinking, as was I, that if we all go to heaven, what does it matter how we live on Earth or what we believe? Well, the people who go to the highest level of heaven, according to Mormon teachings, are rewarded with their own planet, which they essentially become a god to. So, when those Mormon teenagers come to your house asking you to join their church, they're really trying to sell you a planet and goddom. For 10% of your income.

So let's preface with a description of your current experience. Stimuli stimulate different parts of your conscious network, such as nerves or your eye machinery. These yield specific qualia of experience eventually when the stimuli reach your consciousness (perhaps filtered through other processes so the signal that came in isnt necessarily the signal that you experience). There is a wealth of qualia we can experience as humans, not all of which are pleasant.  Now, let's suppose there is an eternal soul, or at least one that's less temporary than our human bodies. This consciousness ('soul') will still be experiencing the world around it like a human would, though I'd imagine the qualias are completely different so perhaps 'like a human' is a bit disengenuous. It would not feel anything the same. So what reason would we have to think all this qualia will be pleasant?   Hell would be the soul experiencing things that induce qualias similar to pain and all the other 'negative' experiences, sourced presumably from the environment. In Hinduism, it'd be like being reborn as something that only feels pain. No God needs to have created this all, it could all just be math that determines what a good or bad feeling is, heaven or hell.  There's totally a lot of conjecture about the nature of reality as the basis for this idea, but it shows that the idea can be non-theistic."

When you check in, you discover that most of the guests at the resort are living according to a rumor that started long before you arrived. Nobody remembers who started the rumor, but they take it so seriously that they won't even call it a rumor. It's just a given.  The rumor is that the producers of Extreme Makeover Home Edition are bringing back the show. For the first episode, they're monitoring the resort with hidden cameras, and everyone who is following a specific set of rules will go home to a brand new, bigger and better house at the end of their vacation.  Nobody is sure of what the rules are, though, but they seem to involve keeping off the beach, not drinking or partying, and generally staying in your room watching Extreme Makeover reruns.  Every floor seems to have a different idea of the rules. Most of your floor believes that only Season One reruns should be watched, and only popcorn can be eaten while watching them. Most of the floor below you watches Season Two, and sometimes goes onto their balconies at night. The floor above you watches only the first six episodes of Season Three and never calls room service. Most guests think that the other floors are crazy, and only their floor's rules make sense.  You've searched the entire resort and found absolutely no evidence that the Extreme Makeover people have ever been there, there's no indication on TV or elsewhere that the show's coming back, and the show never did more than one makeover per episode anyway.

TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,SerialAntagonist,2,Tue Jul 14 12:11:06 2015 UTC,I believe it is the best response to Pascal's wager I've ever seen. You don't even have to explain anything either.
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,Jenycroispas,3,Tue Jul 14 14:13:04 2015 UTC,This is awesome.
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,MagicBob78,2,Tue Jul 14 10:34:30 2015 UTC,Great analogy! Though I believe the religious response would be to restate pascals wager as ones eternal fate compared to a house would shift the reward/risk substantially. Its great for explaining though I'm not sure it would hold debate yet.
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,RationalMayhem,2,Tue Jul 14 14:14:26 2015 UTC,The relative risk and reward involved become meaningless when there are infinite wagers to be made.  Got a present for you.
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,Backdoor_Man,2,Wed Jul 15 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"You've searched the entire resort and found absolutely no evidence that the Extreme Makeover people have ever been there,...   Actually there's a number of books in the lobby all about the life of the Extreme Makeover host, Ty Pennington. There's no author's name, the accuracy is questionable and some of the different versions contradict each other as well as themselves. That's surely enough to convince anyone that the producers of Extreme Makeover are choosing peoples' houses to renovate? All the holidaymakers know all about the book although few of them appear to have actually read it."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,eddg,2,Tue Jul 14 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"The books still aren't evidence that the Extreme Makeover people were ever there, not least because they were written years after the rumor started, by people using the rumor as their primary source."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,SerialAntagonist,2,Tue Jul 14 20:15:24 2015 UTC,This definitely highlights the absurdity of the initial analogy. There is no reason to give credence to any of it. I like it.

TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,ethernetcord,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:57:00 2015 UTC,Fucking great!
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,SecularVirginian,7,Mon Jul 20 05:41:31 2015 UTC,"It is false dilemma, because the analogy assumes that one has no option but to chose a room. In reality we have the option of not even playing the game."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,MrSenorSan,2,Tue Jul 14 07:52:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we're on the same page here. I was gonna suggest that the atheist option would be the one that figured out where the exit was."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,nukefudge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:11:53 2015 UTC,That was actually what I was thinking when I was first told this! But I mostly focused on figuring out more of the house and learning about what could be outside the house. But when/if the bombs went off I still would have made a choice.
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,HoppyMcScragg,2,Tue Jul 14 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm...  I was told that I has to pick a room. Even if you decided to stay where you woke up in the house, you made your choice. You couldn't not make a choice. That's actually part of the reason why I had the crisis, I didn't want to pick a room but was told that I had to pick and my emotions got the best of me."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,gypsy5467,4,Tue Jul 14 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"If you have no solid evidence to go off of, one room is just as good as another. And it might be nice to find out if anyone has a good reason for thinking there are bombs. Is it just some dumb rumor that got out of hand? Also, this whole exploding house scenario seems slightly too convoluted to make a good analogy."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,SerialAntagonist,3,Tue Jul 14 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"I guess the whole house exploding is supposed to be everyone being wrong and suffering the punishment? Yeah, in hindsight I felt pretty silly for freaking out over this."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,Backdoor_Man,2,Tue Jul 14 04:56:15 2015 UTC,"Except, to make the analogy correct, every room but one explodes...or none.  You get to pick with everyone in each room saying that their room is the one that survives.  Other than that, not bad.  Might use it."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,elmarko44,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"Not perfect, I know. But that's how it was told to me.  Edit: the reason I was told that way was because we have no idea what will happen. Maybe nobody is right, maybe everyone is right (which makes no fucking sense but that is what I was told could be a possibility), maybe only some people are right, etc."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,KusanagiZerg,5,Tue Jul 14 02:43:46 2015 UTC,"And that gave you an existential crisis? If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?"
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,Salvroth,2,Tue Jul 14 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"I'm 19. And I do have depression so that probably ""helped""."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,eddg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:17:53 2015 UTC,"To make the analogy actually correct, every room eventually explodes or implodes or is crushed or burned or fills with water or poison gas or fuck I don't know something happens and you die. No matter which room you pick. Try to make it comfy until then."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,thatool,2,Tue Jul 14 05:29:05 2015 UTC,"The sad fact is that most people don't get to even pick their room. I can't remember who said it but,  ""there's no such thing as Christian children, only children of Christian parents."""
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,moiez326,2,Tue Jul 14 07:28:32 2015 UTC,I don't know who else said it but Dawkins uses that a lot.

TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,okayifimust,2,Tue Jul 14 08:31:35 2015 UTC,"My answer would be:   I don't want to blow up but I know that I have no idea which rooms have bombs in (agnosticism) and absolutely no evidence to support the claim so I see no reason to believe it (atheism). I'll work hard to try and find out as much as I can about the rooms and this house because I don't want to end up dying young (science). In the end I'll hopefully find a way out of this horrible place. Either way, whether the place will blow up or not, we're all going to die at some point. I think we should spend this limited time enjoying life not living in the fear and paranoia of death but that's a personal opinion.   TIL god is a terrorist, using fear of terrible consequences to make people choose ""his room"" ... oh no, I already knew that..."
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,okayifimust,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:15 2015 UTC,Yeah it's just preying on the fear that you should be religious just to be safe from an unknown threat.
TrueAtheism,3d7bjo,okayifimust,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:51:52 2015 UTC,"Its a good analogy. A little similar to whats theramintrees calls ""the impossible game"".   Check it out on youtube."
