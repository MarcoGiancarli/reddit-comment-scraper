PKA,3dpr0b,Zebzk,11,Sat Jul 18 06:44:44 2015 UTC,"So when they were talking about Bernie Sanders wanting a 90% tax rate, which is not completely how they made it sound, it would only be for extremely high income, we actually had this kind of system for years(up until Reagan) and it affected less that 1% of the population. The starting point for extremely high taxes would be well in the millions per year.   The reason they got rid of that income tax rate, is because worlds markets began to open up in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s the world was still recovering from WW2 and in the 1980s companies like Fiat, Mercedes, KIA, Hondia, and others began to compete againist other countries and the US began to lose. Also in the 1970s the Laffer curve was created it bassically means that if you over tax you will have short term gains while having long-term economic falling returns. In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s the US was the Wests provider of all goods, but know it's China if you look at the graph you can see when they began producing their economy sky-rocketed, while US companies couldn't compete on wages, cost of energy, cost of regulations(EPA standards), and other costs.   They seemed to think that a socialist country would be full of moochers. However, look at four of the countries typically considered socialist here in the US; Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and Norway.   Except those countries are ""NOT"" socialist.  Sweden- Centre-Left government *note he only beat the Center-right government that was in charge for 10 years, because he's the son of a famous Swedish politician.   Denmark- Centre-Right government *Note beat the centre left government, his party was in charge for 18 of the last 25 years. Ran on lower taxes, get rid of immagration, and lower government spending  Switzerland-Right-Wing Swiss Banks are the most pro business banks in the world  Norway-Centre-Right  Finland-Centre-Right  Germany-Centre-Right government of the last 70 years the Centre-Right has held 52 years in power  Your right that those countries were socialist until the 1990s economic crash in Europe in which countries with a lot of socail programs like Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and others failed and since then people have swtiched to pro market belifs.   One of Sweden top Economists explains it quite well-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG51uCrYxVM)   Now lets look at the GDP of those countries compared to the US(according to the UN, rounded up to the nearest hundred)   Well first you have to ask why GDP(Y=C+I+G+X-M) is so high in those countries. The simple answer is min-wage which is a misunderstood topic, as you have a higher min-wage the more people can afford until price equilibrium occurs.  Cost of living America VS those countries  America VS Swden  America VS Denmark  America VS Switzerland  America VS Norway  America VS Finland  America VS Germany"
PKA,3dpr0b,ehImCanadian,4,Sat Jul 18 15:07:02 2015 UTC,"Not saying you're wrong overall, but saying that Norway (which is where I live) is centre-right simply because the ruling party is centre-right would be like saying the US is socialist because a far-left party served a single term. Most of Norwegian economic policy was made by our left-leaning parties, and Høyre+FrP has done very little overall during their term.  Your sources when comparing cost of living are good (SSB is a reputable collector of information in Norway). I still don't understand this. If Norway is so much more expensive to live in, even with a Norwegian salary, how come there is so much more poverty etc. in the US? I'm just a kid who wants to learn, not trying to say you're wrong in any way :p"
PKA,3dpr0b,BrainBrokenVaga,2,Sat Jul 18 21:47:06 2015 UTC,"is so much more poverty   Well theres a huge difference between Norway and the US especially when it comes to minorities for example 12Million illegal immigrants, historical segregation in cities, and social-economic problems.   Norway is pretty homogenise when it comes to population/demographics your country has grown for the most part together while the US has always had minority groups attempting to reach the ""American Dream"" example Irish, Italians, blacks, Mexicans, and others. Every few decades theres a new group of people that are on the bottom trying to make it to the top.  Note I'm not anti-immigration, I'm just showing why."

PKA,3dpr0b,sawex1,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"The nordic countries are capitalist countries.   Nordic people and American people are not different.  America is largely capitalist. Largely being the key word.  The whole 'moochers' idea is misguided. People mooch because it is the best choice for them. They can work hard doing things they dislike for people they hate, all for a roof over their head and food on a table. You are essentially selling your life, hour by hour. OR ... they can sit back and vegetate and try to avoid the alternative as long as possible. They can pretend to put in job applications and pretend to try, but the reality is they don't want to succeed because they have no hope of ever getting beyond the aforementioned problem.  The 'socialist' idea is that people want to work. There is an entire world of work out there. Capitalism is preventing this work from being done. Capitalism incentivizes mooching (i.e. you can trade your life for shelter, or you can mooch), whereas socialism incentivizes work.  You're right in that mooching is not good. It's capitalism that causes this though."
PKA,3dpr0b,GaB91,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly that is one of the most stupid things I've ever heard. Yea, the idea of not working is great but unfortunately the world needs ditch diggers too. This is were socialism fails because no one wants to do undesirable jobs. Capitalism makes people do these jobs because the alternative is worse. Free riders would be much more prevalent in a socialist society because of the fact better workers are paying for them. This combined with the fact hard workers don't want to pay for non hard works leaves a massive flaw in your system.   Honestly the idea of a society where people who want to work is fucking stupid and logically retarded."

The problem here is, as stated in the video, you and I are thinking of work in two separate ways.  Socialism discourages free riders by making 'work' more accessible to everyone. Capitalism fundamentally inhibits actual 'work' from being done."

PKA,3dpr0b,Rtat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:30:29 2015 UTC,~30%  Based on polls and comparing him to underdog/grassroot candidates like Ron Paul
PKA,3dpr0b,GaB91,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:33:34 2015 UTC,Is that for the Democratic nomination or the general election?
PKA,3dpr0b,Rtat,2,Sat Jul 18 23:34:55 2015 UTC,"Democratic nomination.  If he can win that (only way he can is if Hillary messes up), then his odds for president would shoot way up. Republicans can no longer beat democrats by using their same old platform. The only way they would stand a chance is with Rand Paul, who is in a bernie-esque predicament. The democrats can just scoot into the white house by default at this point. If he won the nomination the only thing that could cause him to not become president is the 'socialism' factor scaring people away."
PKA,3dpr0b,GaB91,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:42:57 2015 UTC,He's not even close to 30% against hillary... Not even close... More like 10%. I'd give him a 4% chance to win the general election. If you think the republicans can only win with Paul you spend too much time on the internet....
PKA,3dpr0b,Rtat,0,Sat Jul 18 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Did you read what I wrote?   I said that if the election took place TODAY he would absolutely lose.   HOWEVER, taking into account his campaign strategy (grassroots, going to red states that other Dems won't go to, etc), the fact that on POLICY ISSUES Sanders is with the American people on almost every category, the fact the election is over a year away and the fact that Sanders doubled in the polls in the span of a MONTH, points to him having A SHOT at the presidency.  If you need further proof, I can recall a certain senator from Illinois running against Hillary Clinton in 2008. This senator campaigned from the left of Clinton and the mainstream media, INITIALLY, didn't give him a second thought. That man became our 44th president."

It comes as a perk for getting close to banks and big businesses all of which know that when push comes to shove she'll support them.   will probably never get mainstream media support   Of course he won't. Have you listened to what he says. The mainstream media knows that if they get this guy's name out there the American people will wake up and realize that he's saying all the things they like and believe in.

The more people focus on their salaries, the less they will focus on satisfying their intellectual curiosity, learning new skills, or having fun, and those are the very things that make people perform best.  The fact that there is little evidence to show that money motivates us, and a great deal of evidence to suggest that it actually demotivates us, supports the idea that that there may be hidden costs associated with rewards. Of course, that doesn’t mean that we should work for free. We all need to pay our bills and provide for our families — but once these basic needs are covered the psychological benefits of money are questionable. In a widely cited paper, Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton reported that, in the U.S., emotional well-being levels increase with salary levels up to a salary of $75,000 — but that they plateau afterwards."

The starting point for extremely high taxes would be well in the millions per year.   The reason they got rid of that income tax rate, is because worlds markets began to open up in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s the world was still recovering from WW2 and in the 1980s companies like Fiat, Mercedes, KIA, Hondia, and others began to compete againist other countries and the US began to lose. Also in the 1970s the Laffer curve was created it bassically means that if you over tax you will have short term gains while having long-term economic falling returns. In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s the US was the Wests provider of all goods, but know it's China if you look at the graph you can see when they began producing their economy sky-rocketed, while US companies couldn't compete on wages, cost of energy, cost of regulations(EPA standards), and other costs.   They seemed to think that a socialist country would be full of moochers. However, look at four of the countries typically considered socialist here in the US; Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and Norway.   Except those countries are ""NOT"" socialist.  Sweden- Centre-Left government *note he only beat the Center-right government that was in charge for 10 years, because he's the son of a famous Swedish politician.   Denmark- Centre-Right government *Note beat the centre left government, his party was in charge for 18 of the last 25 years. Ran on lower taxes, get rid of immagration, and lower government spending  Switzerland-Right-Wing Swiss Banks are the most pro business banks in the world  Norway-Centre-Right  Finland-Centre-Right  Germany-Centre-Right government of the last 70 years the Centre-Right has held 52 years in power  Your right that those countries were socialist until the 1990s economic crash in Europe in which countries with a lot of socail programs like Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and others failed and since then people have swtiched to pro market belifs.   One of Sweden top Economists explains it quite well-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG51uCrYxVM)   Now lets look at the GDP of those countries compared to the US(according to the UN, rounded up to the nearest hundred)   Well first you have to ask why GDP(Y=C+I+G+X-M) is so high in those countries. The simple answer is min-wage which is a misunderstood topic, as you have a higher min-wage the more people can afford until price equilibrium occurs.

Also, in those countries, being poor is much less stressful as they could be considered richer than low paying jobs in the USA as they have access to so many services for free. It makes it so you feel like you owe country instead of hating it for leaving you alone. It makes it so people are not broken down by their situation and still have the will to be a productive member of the society.   In those countries, there is less poverty, less crime, more education and less corruption because money isn't the center of their society.

Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Norway. Nobody even bothers to look at the other socialist countries that are complete failures with their economy, such as Cuba, Korea, and Vietnam. The list can go on, but you get my point.   In the United States we can't exactly replicate those countries anyway, we're took big. It's like baking, you can't double a recipe and end up with twice as many as the original called for. Scaling is a whole issue in itself.  And what is with all of the wealth shaming? Why should people be embarrassed to have wealth? Everyone likes to target CEO's but guess what, they are getting compensated based on what the free market thinks they should be compensated. That's the beauty of capitalism. If the workers don't like low wages, then they don't have to work for those companies. Anyone could become college educated and work hard to achieve endless monetary success. We have hundreds of ideas a day. Just one idea can make you a millionaire. You are one app away from being a millionaire. People say ""Well what's the likelihood of that?"" It's low. It is absolutely low. But do you know why it's low? Because people don't chase their ideas. People aren't ambitious. People like to sob and blame their issues on others, instead of betting on themselves and chasing a dream. Capitalism allows for that to happen."
PKA,3dpr0b,Indiana_Pacers,14,Sun Jul 19 09:03:11 2015 UTC,"I'd like to address the points you made here so this might be a bit long.  There's a reason why Bernie Sanders is looking at the 4 countries you mentioned; that's because they work. He would be out of his mind if he actually said that we should have a system that resembles Cuba, Korea, Vietnam etc.   Also, just because one country has a good policy does not mean that another country can't, in some form or fashion, take it and manipulate it to fit its needs. For instance, the US probably has one of the better entrepreneurial environments in the world. There's absolutely nothing wrong w/ a Sweden-like-country taking a US mentality on that kind of environment and making it compatible w/ their economic system. Why shouldn't the US take a look at socialist countries and say ""They have really good health care"" or ""Gee, all of their people have enough to live and not worry about tomorrow.""?  IDK about other people (either in this sub or on the left) but so far I haven't heard anybody say that having money or being wealthy is a bad thing. (This is besides the loons on the left who are clearly loons) If you're a CEO of a company, you should be making more money than the janitor. No one is complaining about that.  What they are complaining about however, is that some CEOs, due to tax havens, are not paying their ""fair share"" of the benefits of being a company that is based in the US. Couple that w/ the fact that the businesses as well as the super rich, are constantly getting tax cuts by the politicians and than having programs like educations get cut because we no longer have the funds all the while the poor and middle class are getting tax hikes to compensate.   If workers don't like their wages, or anything else for that matter from their company, than yes, they should absolutely quit. But than will they be able to get another job quickly? Do they have some form of higher education? If not how are they going to afford to go to college even though community college is still pretty expensive? Is it even worth leaving?   It's easy to tell somebody ""oh just do this or do that"" if you don't know the kind of situation that person is in or the hoops they would have to jump through.   To your final point regarding ambition. Yes there are, and always will be moochers in this country. And yes there are those who find it hard to get motivated or aren't ambitious. But just because you don't see the go-getters in your area making it right now (IDK anything about you so obviously this could be wrong) doesn't mean they don't exist or won't in the future.   Capitalism is great. I love how it rewards those who try and are successful while weeding out the weak (for lack of a better term). However, what's to say that society, or a community, can't look at itself and say ""ya know what there's a lot of people who, whether it's their fault or not, are not successful. Let's invest in them as whole and try to bring them up and hopefully make this place a little better""?   And that's what I like about Socialism."

I really enjoy this and glad we can share our views with everyone being offended.  I understand why countries like Cuba, Korea and Vietnam aren't brought up, you're right, Sanders would sound like an idiot. I'm just saying when looking at socialist countries you must look at the complete spectrum of socialism, from the ones that work well to the ones that don't.   I agree, there are things we can learn from other countries as they have us. You gave the example of health care, but it is difficult to change the American mindset on something like this. We have to constantly ask ourselves what we owe the government, and what it owes us (through our tax dollars might I add).  I'm not commentating on just people in this sub, but people who feel this way in general. You hear a lot in the media of people attacking the wealthy. I think people understand that the CEO should make more money than the janitor, but they take issue with the wealth gap. That's still something I don't understand why people take issue with though. You are worth whatever the market is willing to pay you. It's why athletes make multi-millions, because sports stars are in demand.   I agree, tax loopholes and havens are complete bullshit. I think if we had a flat tax, they would be closed. I disagree with it too, corporate welfare. I think we could put a stop to this too by putting an end to lobbyists and special interest groups.   Why does it concern me if they can't get another job quickly, or have a form of higher education? It is their fault for not pursuing better, and or more secure jobs in the first place. Anybody can get a student loan and put themselves through college. It's a pretty bold statement but I'm of the mindset, ""where there's a will, there's a way."" It's a part of the betting on yourself process.   I am of the belief that it doesn't matter to me if somebody is successful or isn't. It's not my fault that they aren't successful, they made their choices. I shouldn't be forced to help those who cannot and will not help themselves. I'm not a cold hearted Republican, but I think you have a lot of power in yourself. I am also for raising the funds of education. What we need is an educated society, more people will become successful that way. Education needs to be stressed more than it currently is. I'm not an anti-socialist who is afraid of anything related to socialism, as it has its own merits outright. I just have skepticism in giving too much help."

That being said nobody is saying that it's your problem that somebody is failing nor should YOU have to go help said person.   I was listening to a podcast that featured former Baltimore cop Michael wood. One thing he said really stood out. I don't have the exact quote so please bare w/ me. ""A lot of people say to pull yourself by the bootstraps. The problem is that these people DONT HAVE BOOTSTRAPS to begin with.""  Again, that's not to point the finger at you. That's to say ""hey. There's an issue here; often times its on the individual but if it becomes pervasive as it is today, then it becomes a SYSTEMIC issue""   Believe me when I say that I understand the whole ""I shouldn't HAVE to help these people"" mentality. But is it so bad to ask society as a whole to INVEST into itself so that others might enjoy the benefits this country claims it offers? Like investments in business not everyone in society will succeed. But just like in business, we are investing in the whole, not the partial.  Unfortunately I'm on mobile now and not used to this format or I'd go back and re read your response to me and address some of your other points. But as luck would have it I'm at work right now and I can't for the life of me remember your other points so please forgive me of that.  I would just like to reiterate what I said above and ask that you think on this; It is NOT YOUR PROBLEM if others succeed or fail in this world. What I along w/ Bernie sanders and other progressives (not to say that you're not progressive) ask is that you (when I say you I mean society) make the investment in others and the society so that should you get into some predicament the community can help you out regardless of whether or not you ""deserve"" it or even want it."

Get in a union is also a lot easier in Norway, and you can't get fired for being in a union. It's a system that helps the bottom line get along a bit easier.

An example of a country using 'socialist' free healthcare would be the UK with services like the NHS being free* due to taxes. What Bernie Sanders is saying is that he wouldn't be opposed to taxing the 1% at 90% to make this happen.  So a USA using models like that wouldn't stop you from being rich.

What are your thoughts coming from a more democratic point of view?"
PKA,3dpr0b,P_Revere1776,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:16:27 2015 UTC,"That's fine, it's natural to defend your beliefs and viewpoints. I just hold the opinion that politics (and the areas related to it) are so complex that there is currently no ""correct"" or even near perfect ideology/system. When people hold their belief (or one belief) as being the correct one- and don't look into or give other systems a chance- then they become stagnant in their thinking and growth.  I just want to state for the record that I neither advocate for pure capitalism or pure socialism.  That's a hard question. I don't think it's a good idea to give EVERYONE a fixed minimum income, because I can see the case of people who live off of that and don't do anything to progress the world around them. Maybe have the criteria of in order to get it you must be: a student, a worker who makes less than living wage, specific physical disabilities/illness, volunteering (work-level hours), etc. Of course those criteria have the ability to be abused, so there'd probably need to be checks and more requirements set in place. I don't know immediately how to make it work, but I'd like to say I am for fixed living/minimum income."

It would be a fair comparison if you were talking about a few states adopting socialist policies, but the ENTIRE united states is unbelievably massive when compared to most other nations and socialism is impractical."

The U.S. has the highest corporate income tax in the world if you want to reel the corporations back you have to lower the taxes. I also personally hate the idea of raising the income tax.

PKA,3dpr0b,tmh2duggy,0,Sat Jul 18 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"For me I think that this capitalist go out and work hard and make a ton of money thing is slowly coming to an end. Don't get me wrong, its still possible, and people should pursue a good career, but with automation looming around the corner, so many people will be out of jobs.   If they automate the fast food industry, theres 3.7million jobs that are gone, 239k Taxi jobs that will go, 3.5million Truck driving jobs that will go, and here's all the other jobs that could very easily go.  Over 7million+ jobs gone, theres 17.5million people unemployed currently, add another 7million to the mix, and thats only with fast food, taxi and truck drivers, not including everything else.  With the progress of technology and the increase in learning algorithms, automation, robotics and ease of use UI, so many more jobs could be gone. And then were left with a major problem, most of them might not be able to work in another field, many without useful degrees, so your left with a huge influx of people all without jobs, what do you do?.  Just put them on welfare and allow them to skimp by, let them lose their homes, jobs and wait to see what happens?. Or do you try to create a more socialist society in which even if they are at the bottom, they are not that far behind. Even if there is no job they can still get by.  I'm sure there will be moochers who do nothing, but doing nothing all the time gets boring, most people want to work, and if theres no jobs there's a good chance that they will pursue better things, creating their own jobs, innovating new technology, new ideas, new creativity. Thats what we want, why on earth would we want 3.5million people serving us food, when we could have 3.5million people out there creating new ideas, new things.  Were continue to change and evolve, and were doing it at a rapid pace, it's silly to think that this old system will be able to work forever, and at sometime we have to change."
PKA,3dpr0b,j4390jamie,4,Sun Jul 19 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"Like Woody has said, automation isn't something new. Jobs have been replaced by machines since the industrial revolution.

PKA,3dpr0b,mikegus15,2,Sat Jul 18 13:00:51 2015 UTC,"Jobs have been replaced by technology since the dawn of man... People are ridiculous. When we had no nets to catch fish tons of people had to use their spears because it was less efficient. Then some dude made a net and that allowed a smaller amount to specialize on getting food and allowed the others to advance society. We shouldn't force automation but allow the free market to dictate what should happen. If the free market says that automation makes tons of things cheaper while allowing people to focus on less menial thing that's fantastic. But what about the 7 million who will go unemployed??!?!??! They aren't going to be replaced at the drop of a hat, it will be gradual and new jobs will pop up."
PKA,3dpr0b,Rtat,2,Sat Jul 18 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree, every time there has been a major job shift before the progress allowed for change in which humans were still needed, this time were cutting humans out of the picture here. If you can give me an article, or even what how you see things progressing and what jobs will become available, i'd be happy to admit i'm wrong.   But I don't think thats the case, its 4million+ jobs will the introduction of self driving cars, its 3.5million+ jobs in fast food industry by automation techniques there. I don't see any other jobs popping up that would ever be able to handle that.   Not only that but the american population from 1770 was 2,150,000(Industrial revolution began in 1712) by 1908 it was 88million (End of Revolution).   I couldn't find the amount of people who were in agriculture in 1712, but lets say it was 90%(thats really high by the way) and were take our population from 1770 that would be 1.9million in agriculture, so even if everyone 100% of people working in agriculture went into working in factories, that would still be 5million less jobs that what the automation of just 2 industries would do.  Ontop of that due to globalization and jobs people able to be done overseas it won't just be 7million people (fast food+driving jobs) that will be out of a job, it will be every first world country most likely upwards of 30million+ people, out of a job all within say a 5 year period. That insane, its nice to think that people will pull up there bootstraps and go from working on the farm to the factory, but thats not the case here, there won't be enough jobs to accommodate these people, and even if there were, there won't be enough within a 5 year period.   Just think about the crime rates and everything else that will shoot up when this happens, it could be incredibly dangerous on our economy.   Now like I said, if you can prove me wrong, or at-least show a route in which I might be wrong, please do, I would love to see the other side of the coin, but I just don't see how it would be possible."

Effective tax rates in Norway are 20-35% on income, 27% on capital gains and 20% for corporations.

In 2010 dollars, that's equivalent to $1.6 million for an individual and $3.2 million for a couple.

PKA,3dqudw,murderouspulse,2,Sat Jul 18 21:08:47 2015 UTC,Woody is a liberal independent.
PKA,3dqudw,Sandyrandy54,2,Sat Jul 18 18:59:18 2015 UTC,I think he's socially liberal and fiscally conservative but that's just my observation over the years.
PKA,3dqudw,RooLoL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"I think you might be right with social liberal, a mix between the different ideologies seems to be where Woody is."
PKA,3dqudw,tonybateman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:42:38 2015 UTC,Woody has said a few times that republicans seem to stand for a lot of the stuff that seems pretty terrible (or something to that effect) so I don't see him voting for them anytime soon. Though he's still independent overall I believe.
PKA,3dqudw,CanAWoodChuckChuck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"Woody says he is independent, but in actuality rn he is leaning liberal.  Just about his only view that he agrees with republicans is gun rights. Of course I'm not him so I could be wrong but that is what I've gathered."
PKA,3dqudw,tc405,0,Sat Jul 18 21:33:25 2015 UTC,Well I wouldn't say that one of the core tenants of Republicans isn't racism.

Your reddit name is yankeesfan13...  there are ten characters in yankeesfan...  10 + 13 = 23  The number after 23 is 24  Twenty-four has ten letters.  There are ten letters in ""Op is racist""  tl:dr; OP is a racist."

Actually, when I look into it, I found more proof:  My reddit name is yankeesfan13...  There are 7 letters in yankees  The player for the yankees who wears 13 has been caught using steroids 2 times.  7*2=14  That same player plays 3rd base  14+3=17  There are 17 letters in ""OP is actually Lefty""  Plus, to back it up, Lefty is a baseball fan.  If that's not enough, Lefty likes the Blackhawks, and most Blackhawks fans are bandwaggoners, and there are a lot of bandwaggoners who like the yankees.  td;lr I am Lefty and therefore I must be racist.

I'm gonna say a hard No. Someone is bound to get altitude sickness which is going to ruin it for everyone. I know this because I was that guy.

Hog hunting from a helicopter or a survival trip are the coolest because you're the only people doing this stuff. Take Kyle's boat to the Caribbean! Hike up the tallest peak in the U.S.! Unfortunately the adventure goes down a couple cool points when kids/the public are doing the same thing as you.   Edit: And as /u/calushonator said, fan meet ups are nice, but I want to watch a video of the hosts. I really don't care about seeing fan interactions on video whatsoever."

As far as the pricing, i personally would pay that much for an exciting trip, however as im sure you are awake, you are narrowing down the audience to a very small minority. Perhaps if you were to do an European meet up you might find a good turn out as people would understand it wouldn't happen nearly as frequently."

PKA,3dmm1q,Imbrokeson,5,Sat Jul 18 00:19:57 2015 UTC,I made another post with links to contact Six Flags about group outings. They say that with a group of 100+ you can get 50% admission and a private catered picnic.
PKA,3dmm1q,ten_inch_pianist,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"mm, i doubt many people will be able to pay $400 + travel expenses + hotel, sure, some will turn up but not many  gotta realize most of your viewers are in late teens/early twenty and $400+ travel and hotel and it would seem you have to rent a bike aswell, it is quite a hefty amount  and i'm talking about just from the states, if any Europeans/uk guys want to go, its even more again but then again  that idea is really cool though but i think the only people that would attend is locals + downhill mountain biking enthusiasts tbh"

PKA,3dmm1q,ivanjoyderpus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:23 2015 UTC,I wouldn't see people paying $400 realistically. There will be a few people who go but you won't get anywhere near the turnout for a paintball event. Something I think would be really cool was if you could rent out a field or something and have a projector play some fan favorite PKA episodes and have a sort of meet and greet. Won't cost much and easily accessible for more fans.

But apart from being 'that guy' who says stay away from the danger...  Depending on how long it goes on for it may still only add up to 4-5 minutes of biking unless you get it from all 3 points of view.   No idea what the water park is like but if you add in between-ride banter then sure. But if it's just GoPro shots of one of you going down a slide or swimming around it may not be too great.  Like if you montage it like last time with some biking, waterslides and then a conversation you guys had in line or beside the pool it could be amazing.   Just an idea."

PKA,3dmm1q,SouthPaw67,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't like PKA adventure ideas that are fan meetups.   I know it makes it easier to find companies willing to work with you when you're giving them some revenue for this event, but it seems like everything that would make it worth it for a company is too vanilla to count as a ""PKA Adventure"".   Let's say you do mountain biking and a dozen people show up (higher cost barrier and physically more demanding/risky than paintball, not near a major population center), that would essentially be a birthday party sized event for them.    Even if you could get the numbers needed to put on an event that a company would be willing to invest in, it feels so vanilla. It's not an adventure, it's an amusement park that has a physical component (and the only reason an amusement park was suggested in the past was to cater to Lefty). You're biking down trails that have been biked down thousands of times before, dozens (if not hundreds) of people have gone up there with GoPros and taken family videos.   The difference between mountain biking at a ski resorts and something like Uwharrie National Forest is like the difference between indoor rock climbing and going out to a mountain and climbing. The former, anyone can do.   If you saw a friend on facebook saying he did that, you'd go ""huh, cool. That'd be a fun family vacation"". The same wouldn't exist with the latter.     What I'm trying to say is that PKA Adventures that could have a fan meetup component aren't really adventures. Now, the problem is that you can't have a company help fund flying out somewhere unless they could make a profit out of it. The events that a company could profit on feel too vanilla.  That's just my opinion though, maybe it's because I'm from California and hiking and biking and stuff are pretty common out here.   Edit: to add some ""proof"". You might think your mountain biking tip would look like this, but it would probably look like this."

PKA,3dmm1q,GeelongJr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:02 2015 UTC,"For theme parks I would like to suggest Busch Gardens Williamsburg. Not too far from you and a lot closer for Kyle than Hershey park. Located 3 hours south of the capital, an hour east of Richmond, and not TOO far from the NC border. Six world class roller coasters, not a single one is a afterthought cheap kiddie coaster like Hershey park has a few. The food is produced in house by the park and is EXCELLENT. An average visit costs LESS than a visit to Six Flags and the atmosphere is leagues ahead better. Last fall I worked at the park for their Halloween event as a pirate and I plan to work during the event again this fall. I receive employee discounts and FREE PASSES. I can get six in FREE for a day and even 12 more passes with extreme discounts. If a PKA trip is to the park I would like to suggest a Sunday in October and arriving at the park in the morning, riding the coasters and eating lunch and dinner until the evening, then walk through the Howl-o-Scream mazes and zones until closing. I'll probably see you come through one of them.   If you are interested contact me for ""proof""."

Besides the water park being awesome, there is mini golf and a huge resort/hotel on the property next to the waterpark and bike paths. This spot is honestly perfect for you guys, its only and hour or so from New York and is close to the Delaware River which also has numerous activities that it provides. You guys could go hiking or cliff jumping in and around the river. Please take Mountain Creek into your consideration! Lots of people would be able to go and it has so many activites."

Canada's Wonderland, CN Tower, and Hockey Hall of Fame are not going to do this they are to big and make enough money as so with the leafs and jays are packed for every game. Toronto could have 2 hockey teams and still sell out both. There is no way to get them to Canada without some assistance (travel expenses).

I feel big in coach seating on an airplane. I don't think I should feel too big for an airplane seat, but I like my personal space way too much. I can't be in constant physical contact with the person next to me, it's super uncomfortable. If I were Chiz, or anyone 50+ pounds heavier than myself, I'd never fly. I couldn't bring myself to.

PKA,3div2d,attainableapex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"ya weight and frame is weird. just sharing here.  In the best shape of my life i was 16-20 years old; weight went around 165lbs to 180lbs depending on what sport but defiantly stayed around 180 ish most of the time, i remember doing 600lb leg press reps regularly and max bench of 215lb once, which isn't saying much for the bench but I never really worked arms much. ran a lot though, i mean a lot and biked quite often for long distances as well as swim. for a solid 3 years, i was doing two work outs a day for different teams, one for school and 1 outside. along with games/tournament on weekends and school on friday. that was the height of my sports but had been playing a lot before. I was in really good shape and was defiantly not even close to being fat. Peeked in high school defiantly but would have played in college maybe if i hadn't gotten injured and had had any time to do any homework/grades.  So i have been the same height (5'7"") since like 8-9th grade if that helps. I wore 34x30 at smallest at this time, 17in neck (large dress shirt most of the time). could where a medium shirt but barely (could see chest and what not) and large was a great fit, especially in the shoulders. wear a 9 1/2 shoe. Have large wrists with a snug medium glove. also when i was in high school large cloths were not ""cool"" so tighter, form fitting ( ya i'm a dude, ya i know it looked kinda stupid), cloths were what i was wearing. also wear a 7 1/4in hat, which is a large/xlarge hat. most if not all my bulk was in my legs, upper body was defiantly lacking comparably but i ran mostly so...   The bmi calc, even one that ""adjusts"" for larger frames says i should be at max 160lbs and wear a 30in pant. while i have replaced some muscle for fat and defiantly have gained weight now (35lbs) i think for my frame it would be crazy and i would look malnourished/ under feed. while most i think aren't the same size as me (as i find it harder than normal to find good fitting cloths now and before, and suits have to always be altered a lot, no matter how good) i don't think those bmi calcs are really what people should go by, more of % fat i think would be a better guide.  tl;dr: bmi calcs are not great, especially in my case, % fat is usually a better tell"
PKA,3div2d,pointless-post,6,Fri Jul 17 04:46:03 2015 UTC,If you are feel like you can barely sit in an aeroplane seat at 175 lbs then you are clearly more than 175 lbs.

It involves caches hidden throughout big cities, forests, country roads, etc. and the objective is to carefully find them. Inside are small items, but the rule is if one object is taken it has to be replaced by another object from the seeker. It would be funny to see the hosts put ""RSK"" notes in these caches. Nevertheless, although it sounds like a small activity it could provide for nice vlogs as the hosts traverse varying locations. There are even YouTube channels dedicated to this activity. If they are interested they can check out some videos online.  Here's an example.  http://youtu.be/JxmvEKy1aFI"

So maybe we pick one state to keep it not so crazy, but a state with a lot of shit so like California or Texas or New York.  Split up into various teams of fans and you have to do a giant Scavenger hunt essentially, figure out travel on the fly, all that stuff. But you'd need someone/some company to set up all the clues and make sure no one fucked with them and plan the whole event and help pay for it cause it wouldn't be cheap.

Coming from woody made it really funny.  Part of it might be the lag from Internet calls though so I wouldn't blame woody entirely."
PKA,3dfxdg,ChedduhBob,32,Thu Jul 16 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"No one is blaming him for interrupting. What's rude is that he will interrupt someone, then instead of letting them finish, he just continues to interrupt them.

PKA,3dfxdg,mka696,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I wonder if he consistently drinks coffee/gamma before shows to try to be more entertaining? It seems like he almost has too much energy a lot of the time, which could contribute to why he's always interrupting."
PKA,3dfxdg,dfg724,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:10:06 2015 UTC,He says during a lot of shows that he downs gamma sometimes to be awake for shows. I expect that's part of the cause. Doesn't excuse rude behavior though.

PKA,3dfxdg,Kevin1798,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean but i think there could be a slight lag in the audio. For example, say one person actually finished talking and theres a gap in the conversation. Murka, for example, might begin talking. Due to lag issues, to Woody it seems as though there is still a gap in the conversation that needs to be filled and so he speaks. As he is the one hosting the call it often gives him priority for some reason. I do however have an issue with Woody maybe being a little bit too ham fisted with the way he runs through the topics. Now and again it seems like he rushes the end of a topic even if there was still life in it in order to get through the list of topics he has compiled. Maybe step back a bit and let the conversation flow a bit more naturally."
PKA,3dfxdg,ShadowZexe,4,Thu Jul 16 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"This is true. I see what you mean when it comes the topics.

PKA,3difa6,TrymPet,12,Thu Jul 16 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"Your solution is to move the problem to PKN? I dont personally mind it, I listen to audio only and if theres something I want to see the video of I just go back and watch that little snippet. If you moved the videos to PKN then its even more of a problem because only patrons would ever see the videos. Atleast how it is now you have the option to go back and watch them.  On a side note i know everyone laughs at Murka for narrating the videos or images but as you said it really is appreciated and is a big help as an audio listener"
PKA,3difa6,TJUK37,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"I dont feel that its moving the problem, since PKN is intended to be watched with video and the target audience are patreons."
PKA,3difa6,TJUK37,3,Thu Jul 16 15:34:29 2015 UTC,The main issue with doing that is that your just taking content away from non Patreons
PKA,3difa6,TJUK37,0,Thu Jul 16 15:39:37 2015 UTC,But it's intended for patreons. If they move video to pkn they would make people want to buy patreon because now i feel that i don't get any added beifit of buying patreon.
PKA,3difa6,patheticlittlefuck,6,Thu Jul 16 15:48:45 2015 UTC,I really dont see anyone buying Patreon so they can watch the guys watch a video. Again all that this would do is take things from the non Patreons and that would just kick up a shit storm
PKA,3difa6,HashishOil,0,Thu Jul 16 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"well I buy patreon to watch video, it's so much more worth it to me imo.  But you're right on the last part, it's a video podcast, not a audio podcast.  OP will just have to skim past the video part if it bothers him."
PKA,3difa6,HashishOil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:33 2015 UTC,More people listen to PKN than watch (of course) and its only an hour long I wouldn't want them to watch videos at all during it because I want to get the most out of the hosts as possible. I don't think patreons would want that either.
PKA,3difa6,EKVestvik,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"The thing is that its easier to watch a 1 hour podcast than a 4 hour one.its easier to get time to watch it when its just an hour long, and if you decide to not watch pkn because they are watching videos you would only miss out on one hour of content, instead of four."
PKA,3difa6,EKVestvik,4,Thu Jul 16 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Wait... are you saying they watch videos for 4 hours straight? I'm confused.
PKA,3difa6,CruiseBiscuits,7,Thu Jul 16 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"Only the video gives the whole experience, and making the show more ""audio friendly"" would make the show worse.

The first step is give the mods better tools so they don't need to resort to tactics like this.   This is a reasonable response and relevant to this subreddit.  What is clear is that reddit users are pissed off with mods psuedo-shadowbanning, So if they implement better tools for preventing spam maybe the mods will stop.   A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles."

PKA,3djg9b,Kevin1798,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:25:32 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered how exactly Chiz became a part of PKA. Was he already working on WoodyCraft before Wings was released from PKA? Because I specifically remember Wings saying he didn't want Chiz to be his replacement the day he got kicked off and I always thought that was such a random request. I didn't even really think Chiz was great friends with the hosts, although to be fair at the time I had only been watching PKA consistently for 15 episodes (i know, sucky time to start getting really into it). All of the sudden it was as if they brought Chiz on the episode after wings left just to spite him. Now Chiz is manager and great friends with the hosts! Anyone know a full history of chiz and the hosts, maybe even /u/DrChiz himself?"

Ages ago, like during black ops 1, woody did a thing called commentator march madness where he gave a load of smaller channels a chance to compete on his channel for recognition, I think thats where Chiz started. Chiz also used to be very good friends with Lefty outside of the podcast. If you check out Leftys channel and search ""thats not why you called "" youll find a podcast that Lefty did with Chiz. Lefty and Chiz had a major falling out after Lefty left the show which is a shame as they seemed like good friends"

B96 works the same, only that the limited is higher, so you can pull 4250kg or 9369lbs combined GVW.

Your average SOG knife will have a lot of curves and angles to the blade, many of them unnecessary and just there to make the knife look ""cool"" (and an absolute bitch to sharpen btw). Kershaw knives are alright as long as you stick to life EDC type stuff. I bought a liner lock Kershaw a few years back (cant remember the model number off the top of my head) and there was a fair amount of blade wiggle after using it as my everyday carry for a month. I now carry a KA-BAR Dozier Design, its nice, conservative in appearence, lightweight and does the job. Kershaw knives do have a reputation for coming razor sharp out the box so props to them for that.  I wish I could try out Dollar Shave Club, I really do. Maybe one day theyll ship to Ireland  shit i let my secret out!"

PKA,3dce3a,Cyfa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think Murkah is better simply because of the amount of times Wings would complain, receive great advice, and then throw it aside.

PKA,3dce3a,Strackles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"I like murkas comedy better. Wings' comedy consisted of him being an idiot, ( he says sometimes on purpose but I doubt it ) and being really random and interrupting people about random stuff. Murkas comedy is usually a play off of what is happening in the podcast I.E. What they are or were talking about. I think it adds a more structured and stable comedic tone as opposed to randomness which would sometimes lead to very boring segments."

PKA,3dce3a,SonnyWane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"Good point. It just seems every time Wings is mentioned Murka's name is right there.

A prime example of this was the 'I'm down, cow', even though it was one of the funniest moments in PKA history, I just think it is a bit strange that he would say it so seriously.

PKA,3d8nwv,EKVestvik,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:18 2015 UTC,From my understanding of the incident the rider filtered to the front of the light. While for some people this can be frustrating it doesn't justify (the driver's) full on assault.

PKA,3d8nwv,THEcasanova,0,Wed Jul 15 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing he was doing some lane splitting, or riding up to the front of the line at the light. Annoying as shit, but no reason to punch him in the face.   Also, the biker is wearing a fucking helmet. And the dude punches it... As dumb as the football players who try and punch each other and just ended up hitting each other in the helmet or facemask. Gunna do more damage to yourself, champ."

PKA,3d8nwv,patheticlittlefuck,7,Tue Jul 14 11:01:49 2015 UTC,"The guy was an ass, but he was obviously under the influence of something, and even though he deserved an ass kicking, he still needs medical attention. He bounced his head hard and I read that he broke his ankle on the fall down."
PKA,3d8nwv,Sam_MMA,-6,Tue Jul 14 11:32:10 2015 UTC,"being a dick and assaulting someone under the influence isn't a excuse, he was driving so he was risking other people's lives as well.  after watching a replay, he barley even hit his head, at least not hard enough to hurt him, and he isn't the victim here, the bikers are."
PKA,3d8nwv,patheticlittlefuck,8,Tue Jul 14 11:54:06 2015 UTC,I never said he was the victim? I said just because he is an ass doesn't mean he should be subjected to further injury. The biker handled the situation exceptionally well. Two wrongs do not make a right.
PKA,3d8nwv,Sam_MMA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're talking about a 1,8 meter fall, with extra weight (the motorcyclist holding him during the fall), that shit hurts, you don't much force to get a concussion, and I'm pretty sure that guy did. Not defending him, but saying ""he barley even hit his head"" is not true."
PKA,3d8nwv,ekvivokk,-2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:52 2015 UTC,"you act like he had his head bashed into the ground..  he fell back, and you can see he wasn't standing straight he didn't fall over like a pencil, he was crouching and probably around 1 meter, the fall wasn't anything huge, re-fucking-lax."
PKA,3d8nwv,patheticlittlefuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:05:23 2015 UTC,"Have you ever fallen backwards and hit your head before? Since I can tell you it's not a good feeling, especially with again pushing you down.  I'm not defending him, I just don't like people thinking brains can withstand impacts, since they can't, and an unchecked concussion could be very bad for you."
PKA,3d8nwv,ekvivokk,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't say you were defending him, I'm just saying the impact wasn't as bad as you're making it seem, he didn't fall from 6 feet, he wasn't standing straight, and he didn't whiplash his head violently.  if he did hit himself you would've seen him concussed, and out of it, yet he was fine afterwards, talking and responding.  Thanks for the info though doc."

PKA,3d9gm1,SocratesSC,3,Tue Jul 14 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"yes that's the moment, I think he was still on the edge of whether or not he thought he was an asshole, and he didn't want to say it just yet.  imo, we all love kyle, but even a 20 is fine, I know you gave him 1.4k which he basically destroyed, but it's for the occasion, you're a slight asshole."
PKA,3d9gm1,patheticlittlefuck,5,Tue Jul 14 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think he had to give him any money. He had done enough for Jeremy imo but I love how he just casually lied and said he through a ""good"" amount of money in."
PKA,3d9gm1,itzKleenx,5,Tue Jul 14 18:44:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, I think he still felt unsure whether it was right or wrong.  I'd still say a 20 in the jar wouldn't have been to bad, JUST FOR THE OCCASION, don't do it for Jeremy, but for his wife, and family."
PKA,3d9gm1,patheticlittlefuck,9,Tue Jul 14 18:48:21 2015 UTC,Kyle also said in the last episode of PKA that he loves the drinking episodes and then 2 minutes later when Woody said he didn't like them Kyle said he hated them...
PKA,3d9gm1,joshhpayne,3,Tue Jul 14 19:08:41 2015 UTC,I think he meant he hates doing them but thinks the podcast turns out well when they do it

PKA,3d9gm1,HashishOil,4,Tue Jul 14 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"He want making accusations, he was just trying to see if anyone else remembered it.  He made the post looking for a timestamp to see if it was true. I don't remember it either but I wouldn't exactly call this an accusation"
PKA,3d9gm1,16Jack,4,Tue Jul 14 16:38:22 2015 UTC,No he did say that. I just can't remember what episode and time stamp. It was when he first told the story about it because he was saying he felt over dressed compared to the others.
PKA,3d9gm1,jonnyrotten97,2,Tue Jul 14 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"You should apologize, OP was correct. Here is the beginning of wedding talk on PKA 235 with bobby burns. And here is where Kyle said he through money into the tip jar."

PKA,3d9gm1,patheticlittlefuck,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:21:27 2015 UTC,"I remember this too. I'm not too sure why he has to lie about one or the other , plus on the ""am I an asshole"" for not giving him money , id say yes. Who cares if you payed for his MMA, you're a good guy.

PKA,3d7bsn,patheticlittlefuck,3,Tue Jul 14 05:46:47 2015 UTC,Woody probably has skin damage from spending a lot of time in the sun as a kid and teenager. A few of my relatives tanned a lot when they were young and when they were 40-50 their skin texture took a nose dive.

PKA,3dcuwt,JAB_REDDIT,5,Wed Jul 15 07:25:26 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. One of the things PKA used to have going for it was its unpredictability. When loading up a show i never really knew what the hosts were going to talk about. Now, if you went back and listened to the past 30 or so episodes you could probably condense the main topics into at most 7 sections. There has been far too much GOT and CIV talk. I love GOT, Ive read the books multiple times but my God I didnt start listening to PKA for a book club. Way back in 2014 when Kyle first started playing Civ I was intrigued and downloaded the game. It was the worse $30 Ive ever spent, Taylor perfectly sums up my opinion of Civ talk kn the latest episode. Something that not a lot of people address when it comes to the (for lack of a better word) degeneration of PKA is that there is no longer the YouTube community there once was. I used to listen to PKA to get the insise scoop on the goings on in the Cod community; back with the old live shows i really felt as if I were a part of sonething. Back in the day PKA was the most respected podcast in the community, it was an epicentre and so could get great guests every week. On a related note, just because a guest is famous ( ie Anthony Cumia or the to catch a predator guy, did a woody on his name there) doesnt mean theyll be any good. Often the more ""professional"" a guest is the more used theyll be to being on camera and theyll have their public facades built up, we dont see the real them. On the other hand, the best guest in the past 15 episodes at least was Filthy. He would make a great host (as long as he and Kyke signed some sort of NDA about Civ talk). Finally, woody should seriously stop trying to keep the show on rails as much. If you somehow read this woody, dont misinterperet this as hate. I know you want to make the best show you can and that leads you to controlling the conversation. However I feel that recently you stopped several topics before their time. Maybe stop treating PKA as a list of topics to be gotten through at all costs. Its not the end of the world if you dont cover all the topics. Thats my opinion on the current state of PKA."
PKA,3dcuwt,Kevin1798,3,Wed Jul 15 10:19:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. I used to look forward to my Saturdays for PKA and I would listen to it that morning if I wasn't busy. Now it's more ill catch it when I can. I think it would be better if they had another person as the host that wasn't the same as Woody and Kyle. Like you said it is a constant agreeing with woody fest. More or less its the same thing almost every week. What did woody and kyle do this week, hows the minecraft server, GoT talk, Civ talk, PKA questions, Mail monday type questions, Then some topics.  Those are my opinions on it though."
PKA,3dcuwt,Nugrun,3,Wed Jul 15 07:56:55 2015 UTC,"Wrong time to post (everyone is asleep) but I totally agree. Me and my friends used to watch the live stream and have a group convo on the funny parts. It used to be a segment of my week I looked forward to. Wings was awesome, lefty provided a different approach and tbh I even feel like the guests were so much better then. Hell even the view count shows that people are getting bored of it. I fucking love Murka but I wish we got Wings-Kyle-Murka-Woody at one time or another. I'll watch PKA now but those memories and the sense of the community was amazing (check out the RSK subreddit, the community was SO MUCH BETTER then) . Now it's been on the rise and I'm enjoying it more and my views have definitely been tainted by nostalgia but fuck I miss old PKA and the memories of it."
PKA,3dcuwt,mrw0rldw1de,2,Wed Jul 15 08:43:56 2015 UTC,at least I am not the only one. I know it's night but this rant was me skipping PKA 233 earlier tonight.
PKA,3dcuwt,mrw0rldw1de,2,Wed Jul 15 09:04:34 2015 UTC,Everyone's downvoting now but you're definitely right.
PKA,3dcuwt,Doughnuts3001,3,Wed Jul 15 09:07:56 2015 UTC,I agree 100% I highly doubt they add another host at this point because the money would be split yet again making everyone else lose money.  I just going to watch and hope something changes soon.
PKA,3dcuwt,astupidwhitekid,2,Wed Jul 15 10:49:34 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a different idea in their head of when the ""golden age"" of PKA was. Some people think it's now, some people think it was when it first began.   It's personal preference, if you enjoyed the more controversial episodes of PKA, that's cool man.   I think you might be more nostalgic towards the earlier episodes of PKA because that is relatively when you began watching. You might just be burnt out."
PKA,3dcuwt,SocratesSC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:50:34 2015 UTC,"I might have agreed with you that I might be burned out, but I am a fan of two other podcasts that have been running longer than PKA, and the hosts have not changed and I am not burned out on those. What I love in a podcast is a conversation about things, either current events or stuff going on in their lives.  PKA right now is not that. At least, not outside of GoT talk."

PKA,3d9rfb,TrymPet,14,Tue Jul 14 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"Surely the answer is subjective. I personally find these days my favourite. The professionalism has made the show just brilliant. Now don't get me wrong, the show has gone down a few notches on the ol' comedy metre since Wings departure, but in general I much prefer the show now for it's formatting, interesting guests and banter"
PKA,3d9rfb,callumcakes,6,Tue Jul 14 17:28:11 2015 UTC,"Basically the first 30. Great audio, they did 4 hours as opposed to the pathetic 3.5 now. They didn't talk about COD as much. Truly the glory days of PKA  /s"

PKA,3d9rfb,vanguard_anon,6,Tue Jul 14 18:31:22 2015 UTC,I think it might be viewers that joined reddit from hearing about it on the show and do not understand reddiquette
PKA,3d9rfb,Mrnickhimself,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:13 2015 UTC,surely they can remove the downvote..  people who are new won't automatically downvote anything that they don't agree with.  and it'll make it better around here.

PKA,3d9rfb,mcagent,4,Wed Jul 15 00:35:08 2015 UTC,Post ep 100 until Wings left.
PKA,3d9rfb,mrICL,4,Tue Jul 14 21:59:10 2015 UTC,The wings and lefty era (although the show is still great). Murka is a fantastic addition. I think that the addition of a fourth permanent host could potentially bring back these glory days if selected correctly.  There was a lot of conflict/contrast between host's perspectives during the wings and lefty era. I think this is what brought the podcast from good to great.
PKA,3d9rfb,TheHag,4,Tue Jul 14 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Hate to say it but I really think Wings would be hilarious on the show nowadays, he and Taylor would mesh well imo."

PKA,3d9rfb,br1an4,3,Wed Jul 15 00:21:47 2015 UTC,I personally think between 20-40
PKA,3d9rfb,dannyr22,2,Tue Jul 14 16:43:36 2015 UTC,its all subjective. personally i think in years when pka ends( or whenever it does) people will look back at this time(pka200-pka240) as the glory days
PKA,3d8kx2,Lucaayes,3,Tue Jul 14 10:14:24 2015 UTC,I dont get how everones gone from hating on Jared Leto's Joker to gushing over him... he had a 10 second clip at the end of the trailer. I liked his voice but he still looks a bit shit to me.
PKA,3d8kx2,TJUK37,3,Tue Jul 14 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"I like the fake teeth and all, but it's just the punk look of the Joker that's off putting. The tattoos are super weak and the hair is way too green, it's like they wanted to go for an edgy comic book version but it just looks like he got back from a Hell On Wheels fan club meeting."
PKA,3d8kx2,Cyfa,2,Tue Jul 14 13:39:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. I Mean they had to try something different from Ledgers Joker for obvious reasons but i just dont like the way they went
PKA,3d8kx2,TJUK37,2,Tue Jul 14 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah and I mean don't get me wrong I like that they had the balls to try something different, but like you said, different doesn't always mean better."
PKA,3d8kx2,Cyfa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"So far from what i've read on twitter/reddit everyones opinion seems pretty mixed on him. I personally like the way they've gone with it.

PKA,3dcwgt,Greasyas,2,Wed Jul 15 11:17:09 2015 UTC,Agreed. Allthough i do not always feel that they're dragging it out towards the end. Usually i think they do a good job. I just hope the hosts know that it DOESN'T need to be exactly 4 hours long.
PKA,3dcwgt,TrymPet,2,Wed Jul 15 08:29:25 2015 UTC,"no, more content the better. he was deintrested because he was piratically falling asleep because of the time zones.."
PKA,3dcwgt,KTMduke125,2,Wed Jul 15 16:33:50 2015 UTC,I like it being four hours because they only do it once a week. The guest can stay for as long as they wish and there has been a few times where the guest leaves an hour or two in.

Their is a PKA where Woody Vs FilthyRobot on that you can go watch it and it proves why you're wrong. But let me put it into perspective for you. Imagine being an illegal immigrant working at two McDonalds having children and not a social security card you cant switch jobs and you hate your job at McDonalds. Now Imagine no one supporting you. Lets go tell that guy what you said. Now lets take Woodysgamertag. What do Jobs, Gates. Musk, and Woody have in common. Well its simple their all Outliers. Gates is famous for his coding skills etc. When he went to college it was prime time for coding no one did it and he snuck into his College at night to learn to code for fun cause he liked it. He became very good at coding and made his legacy. Lets take woody started making Call of duty commentaries in 2010. That was for the same reason as Bill gates for fun never knew the outcome. If Woody never got into computer programing if woody wasn't born in the United States at the time he was. If woody didn't start uploading in 2010 would he be as successful no. Why because Time/place/action. 1975 Bill gates drops out of College. In the eighth grade Bill gates had access to computers thats 1968 he got addicted to programming. You see how their the same thing their Outliers. Telling a regular person to quit their McDonalds job in search of their own company would be stupid because a lot of them don't have an equal opportunity in life. Now I know I just did a drastic comparison but do you see what I'm saying. Its not all hard work a determination its sometimes the luck someones given being born at a certain place at a certain time. I will leave my source and my Book I recommend it is a New York times best seller and probably will change your mind on lots of things.  Outlier Malcolm Gladwell  Source http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/  Very Sorry I don't really write well but I'm very well spoken."
PKA,3d7qmg,Sam_MMA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:20:20 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't base our companies structures off of the needs of illegal immigrants. If you want to be successful you have 2 options.   Go out and find the next 'thing'. Start a company, innovate a product. Do something. Go to college and get a high paying job.   You take option 1 or 2 or you end up working on the bottom. It's not fair but that's how the world works."
PKA,3d7qmg,Rtat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:26:22 2015 UTC,I'd like to know how it isn't fair that the only way you're going to be making a lot is if you're worth a lot to someone else or worth a little to tons of other people...
PKA,3d7qmg,Sam_MMA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:37:21 2015 UTC,I'm saying it's not fair that it's pretty easy to be successful if you come from money. Some people don't the option to start a business/go to college because of their environment. It's unfair but it's the way the world works. Money turns the globe.
PKA,3d7qmg,joshhpayne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"I think Woody would still be successful, he had a good job, he just didn't like it because it was his ""prison""."
PKA,3d7qmg,ehImCanadian,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"illegal immigrant   If your an illegal immigrant you should be punished to the fulleist extent of the law, I'm a legal immigrant who got my citzeinship in Canada in the late 90s with my family....So you shouldn't even be in the country if your illegal, because it puts strain on Canadians and other immigrants who are trying to get into the country, an example of this would be illegal gun owners vs legal gun owners, legal gun owners really hate what illegal hun owners do because it makes them look bad.(School shooters and other crimes with gun).  Same Walton founded Walmart, because he hated work at J.C. Penny as a chasier and complained about the wages so he made his own company.  Yes of course time, place, and action are importent, but everyone born in the western world has that oppurnity to succed no matter what, no one is stopping me from creating a interent company example look at Uber, simple idea now valued at $40B.  *Note: I'm on an Ipad which is set to two languages so the auto-correct is off."
PKA,3d7qmg,ehImCanadian,0,Tue Jul 14 09:28:18 2015 UTC,Sam Walton got a 25k loan from his father to open up his own store. In the United States no Bank will give you a loan at the age he was with a JcPenny job. Without this 25k loan from his father in law he would have never been an Outlier and would have never had the success he had can't you see everyone at the top have had this Outlier ability. You can keep naming names all you want their not successful just cause they work hard their also Outlier.

I understand what they're going for: it had a high chance to spread around because of how provocative and sudden/random it is. The gamble here is: are Irishmen going to look at the site, have a laugh, and consider their proposal?; or is it going to be hated/condemned/thought of as stupid and get buried."

PKA,3d5v0p,ynnekf76,2,Tue Jul 14 02:07:10 2015 UTC,PKA 155 was ruined by everyone except wings. He wanted to put on a funny show but the others kept having a go at him for fucking hours. Yeah he was being childish but PKA 155 being bad was definitely not his fault.
PKA,3d5v0p,Pixelsplitterreturns,2,Tue Jul 14 23:16:57 2015 UTC,Sadly that ship has sailed because Wings has made his own Podcast the chances of getting Wings back on PKA is very slim.  PSA: Search the subreddit to see if these kinds of posts have been made before because it seems like we see one of these every week.
PKA,3d5v0p,-Replicated,2,Mon Jul 13 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"I mean this might just be me, but i found wings to be very unhappy with the weeky 4 hour long show. He would constantly be saying how long this is taking, and thats on camera, im sure he expressed how unenthusiastic he was off camera too. If your post was asking for him to come on the show as a guest i recall this being brought up on the show and they expressed they would like that but its all down to wings. If you were asking about him coming back as a host again i think that wouldnt add to the show and it wouldnt take too long for wings to get restless."
PKA,3d5v0p,Tydus93,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"the only time i will ever see him back on the show as a host is if he proves himself on TPS, showing up to the meets and getting stuck in.  i personally think that at this moment it'll probably be a no. who knows the behind the scenes though?"

PKA,3d5v0p,BigMamaCha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:41:32 2015 UTC,"How is this even a question anymore. They kicked him off, he doesn't come on the show anymore, and he's a member of an entirely different podcast. It's not that difficult."

PKA,3d5v0p,SirCornelius1,4,Mon Jul 13 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say that pka and the podcast shows are not part of the same community anymore. The Podcast show is much more of a gaming podcast than PKA is now. None of the guys on pka make their money playing games anymore, while everyone on the podcast show relies on streaming/YouTube as part of their income"
PKA,3d5v0p,ChedduhBob,12,Mon Jul 13 20:09:52 2015 UTC,I honestly believe that a big part of the PKA community has outgrown gaming simultaneously with the hosts.

PKA,3d5v0p,taxc,-1,Mon Jul 13 23:39:20 2015 UTC,I feel like the only people that keep making this post are the little kids who don't understand that things in life change and you have to learn to move on.  Wings had his stint on the show. It was cool while it lasted. He's found another podcast. Both are doing well.   They moved their separate ways and you need to understand that.

I would probably be just as pissed as you if Amazon wasnt doing shit for me after I didnt receive a very expensive order The customer service guys didn't really do anything to insult you or anything. we all know it wasn't their faults and they're just doing what they're told to do. they probably deal with this shit all the time though and have most definitely forgotten about it by now. I wouldnt feel bad about it now(if you are).    So yeah, you had the right to act like an asshole but you did it to the wrong people"

PKA,3d1g9i,xrambino23,14,Mon Jul 13 00:49:29 2015 UTC,And the layout even had Taylor on it the entire time
PKA,3d1g9i,smoke3x14,38,Mon Jul 13 04:17:52 2015 UTC,"Even tho the stat was wrong there are 2 things that will possibly result from this that I will find annoying.   Woody will rant about this subreddit for making such a big deal of this. The subreddit is (and has started) going to make a giant ass deal out of this even tho it doesn't matter, which will also justify Woody's point but at the same time he was indeed wrong.   In the end we get to be annoyed by the fact that Woody will use these posts as a distraction from the fact that he really was off target with that statement, and we get to suffer from more of these posts. Yay."

PKA,3d1g9i,username4125,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:03:42 2015 UTC,We should all just ignore murka saying he was moving a few episodes back or woody being unable to kept a straight face every time he brought it up...

PKA,3d1g9i,patheticlittlefuck,3,Mon Jul 13 12:13:54 2015 UTC,So I have to point out that Kyle said 80% before the podcast went live and literally as he was doing the show. If the thumbnail hadn't shown Taylor and if everyone hadn't said it on Reddit then it would have probably tricked a few people...
PKA,3d1g9i,JamesHayes101,2,Mon Jul 13 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kinda like that every time the PKA hosts decide to prank the fans.  If we believe it - we're gullible fucks. If we don't - we're paranoid fucks. Every time it seems like less of a ""prank"" (it would kinda have to be actually funny or interesting, in my opinion, to make it a ""prank"") and more of a way to point fingers at the naysayers that Woody dislikes."

He's a little more subtle with it so he doesn't catch as much flak but we're wise to your shenanigans.

PKA,3d7av3,charliesheen187,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:05:10 2015 UTC,"My opinion.   She never gets over the death of her husband and sees her son as the reason for her husbands death, and in her psychotic, depressed state believes that killing her son is the only way to get her husband back. It is also mentioned in the movie that she was once a writer and therefore we are thought to believe that she wrote the babadook book.   And as for the ending, I think it's meant to describe how depression never leaves, how we  can push it to the back of our minds and forget about it, stuff it in our basements but it still remains waiting to strike again.   With all that being said I'm curious to hear what Woody has to say."
PKA,3d7av3,JaysonBourne,2,Tue Jul 14 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"Woody made a post about it reads like this ""The Babadook was her grief from losing her husband. When she ignored it the grief just got stronger. Finally she realized that he grief was preventing her from loving her son and her love caused her to remove the grief from her system (via vomit) and deal with it. In the end she didn't defeat the grief/Babadook. Instead she learned to live with it. She kept it locked away in the basement and coped with it. Sometimes it was bad, sometimes it was more manageable. It never fully went away but she was able to live her life."""

PKA,3d9g2h,FernPlant3000,-1,Wed Jul 15 05:40:48 2015 UTC,"I do think it has got worse since Jordie left, it is way too predictable and everyone just agrees with each other. I personally didn't like Lefty but he was a good asset to show because he would disagree for the sake of an argument, same with Jordie. Jordie has a great heart but it was hard to see because he was going through a dark time in his life, if you haven't went/going through depression it is hard to understand his mindset. I would love Jordie to come back as a guest but I would also love it to be when Taylor can't make a show, I would love a Throwback to just Jordie, Woody and Kyle"
PKA,3d9g2h,TPSandPKA,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"Its true, I realized that he did matter when I began watching the original pka's its a shame he will never come back."

PKA,3d6zo4,JaysonBourne,3,Tue Jul 14 03:27:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't get that part either, throughout the movie you see the mom clench her jaw and grind her teeth most likely due to stress and depression. I think the tooth coming out represents her relieving her depression maybe? IIRC when her tooth fell out is when she was getting closer to killing her son so it may have been the starting point of her anger release and the murder of her son would have been the ultimate release of depression."
PKA,3d6zo4,AbacusFreak88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:04:18 2015 UTC,I don't know man. I was just dumbfounded when she started pulling out her tooth. I was like what the fuck. I thought it might be a foreshadowing to her throwing up. I don't know it just threw me off. It was the only part that bugged me because it was so unexpected! Which is good I guess? 😉

PKA,3d32pj,Silverhand7,7,Mon Jul 13 06:59:13 2015 UTC,I think Kyle said it's niche in the fact that a vast majority of people that play the game play it on singleplayer. Kyle said it can be hard at times to find peoe to play against when he just randomly tries joining a session when he doesn't tweet out that he is playing.
PKA,3d32pj,wvwildman,2,Mon Jul 13 13:59:33 2015 UTC,Yeah it is hard at time to find ppl online. I'm Agreeing with you that Kyle meant the Multiplayer Is a Niche part.

PKA,3d0zpg,__redruM,4,Sun Jul 12 17:41:19 2015 UTC,Well for the brief few seconds about the wings death. I was fooled right up to the point talking about who gets his channel. I just rewatched that ep still good.  Thier is only two real tricks they got most people. Nividia and Wings leaving the show. Wings leaving the show was the greatest  one. Everyone thought they were fucking with us because it wasnt long after the Nividia and no one thought Wings would leave. Also damn Kyles ;) lol.
PKA,3d0zpg,fathertimexx,9,Sun Jul 12 17:55:14 2015 UTC,You believed that wings died trying to finish his desk? I mean come on
PKA,3d0zpg,Pixelsplitterreturns,7,Sun Jul 12 18:33:51 2015 UTC,Being in a poorly ventilated room full of epoxy fumes isn't that much of a stretch.   Also I'm pretty sure Wings showed the hosts a picture of a propane heater inside his house not too long before the fake death
PKA,3d0zpg,Dre3K,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:37:51 2015 UTC,"It's the exact thing you would make up if you were joking. They played it as a joke from the beginning if you go back and watch it, I don't understand how anyone could believe it."

PKA,3d4h34,lordfinesse23,4,Wed Jul 15 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt one of the worst guests they've ever had in a while.  The problem was he was never engaged. He only spoke when he was asked a question, which is the worst type of guest you could have. He seemed disinterested in the topics except for the COD topics.  As you pointed out he used the word ""like"" so many times it was annoying.   Fearcrads was an entertaining youtuber imo in his heyday. But as a guest on a podcast he just didn't offer a lot.   The best type of guests are those that are engaged throughout like Jayztwocentz, boogie, even Filthy. But Fearcrads was a miss."
PKA,3d4h34,AidanLUFC,2,Mon Jul 13 19:53:29 2015 UTC,Also why did everything he say have an upward inflection on it...annoyed me once i noticed it..and its not a UK thing
PKA,3d4h34,LeTriggr,2,Mon Jul 13 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"Its not really his fault, its a UK thing. Most people over here use 'like' as a filler in conversation just like how imo most american use 'umm' as a filler"

Motherboard - One of the cheapest Asus X99 motherboard, which still had 8 ram slots and supported 3-way SLI. I picked Asus because they always keep releasing updates for BIOS if new processors come out.  Memory - a little bit more expensive, but that was just for aesthetic purposes.  SSD - the best value for your money  HDD - Best value for money if you are searching +4TB  Video Card - the best money for value high-end graphics card.  Case - actually cheaper than the Define R5, the reason i chose it was because it comes with 2 140mm fans and the case has great airflow because the hard drive bays are not in a usual spot.  Power Supply - Kept the one the other dude recommended, because there's no better one for better value from a reliable manufacturer."

You can make bad decisions, but that stems mostly from lack of knowledge about the game. If you really like Civ, then keeping learning about it--either through YouTube videos, the Civ Wiki, and experience.  Also, if you can, lower the difficulty. It'll make a huge difference. Even better, if you have an experienced friend who can guide you as play, take advantage of that resource."

Like it is has been said on this thread already, it is more the casuals who only catch episodes now and again, people new to the show, and people who have no clue this subreddit exists might have been fooled. Either way, they probably got quite a few people. Heck, there are probably audio only listeners out there who will be fooled because they never see the thumbnail."

We were always near the air film station in our white tent, people came by day to talk to us. And trying to find us on the field is next to impossible & so is having s conversation during a live battle :(  Yesterday was really the ""PKA Day"" it was all our fans in a big 100+ squad roaring maps. Hanging out with us. Today was like several hundred people and an official event, PKA/FPS Russia was just one small name out of a dozen paintball celebs/legends today.   I know we all feel bad.

After that I was hanging around looking for you guys and you guys probably had left. Don't feel bad or anything I don't want to seem like I'm trying to be a sob story.

The schools she worked at were in the poorer parts of town with a lot of Somalian and non native English speaking imigrants and alot of the time they just chose names based on english words that they either thought sounded nice or names that were popular in the area. My mom would tell us about her day after work/school and there were a lot of names that were not exactly desirable but definitely passable for everyday use. One time, however, she told me of a poor child with possibly the worst name I could imagine having as a kid or adult.  This kids name was Latrine, as in the toilet, spelled the same and pronounced exactly so. The parents had fit into the aforementioned demographic and had chosen the route of having just picked a name that they thought sounded nice and this poor kid had ended up with her name being possibly the easiest name to make fun of in the history of elementary school. She was also very autistic which didn't help her ability to socialize with the other kids at all. I only hope that they will get her a name change asap.  Not exactly what you asked for but I don't get to tell this story too much so Ill bite at the chance to do so."

PKA,3cyi4v,truthhurts__,10,Sat Jul 11 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"This sub exercises the rule that your account needs to be 5 days old (if not, then have 15 comment karma) and this is good in preventing trolls making new accounts to peer out from under their bridges after being banned. That's got to be part of it. So anybody from YouTube coming straight to r/PKA and creating an account to comment, no one will see their first comments. And that comes from me :)"
PKA,3cyi4v,alt_account275,4,Sat Jul 11 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"As a mod of a subreddit of about 10k users, that feature is so helpful"
PKA,3cyi4v,ChedduhBob,-3,Sun Jul 12 03:06:41 2015 UTC,"Good point, but the shaddow ban is def abused here. Also I don't think that rule is fair to new users. Many people here are new to reddit, and come here just for pka so when they create an account to talk about their favorite podcast their comments won't even show up and they will likely be discouraged from trying again. Horrible rule because Kyle and Woody scared of trolls."
PKA,3cyi4v,GoMLism,11,Sat Jul 11 23:28:38 2015 UTC,"So a few things here, and this is coming from someone who has moderated a sub with more traffic than /r/pka in the past. You seemed to be a bit confused on how reddit works.   Mods can't shadowban people from reddit. Only admins can shadowban from reddit There is another way to have a sort of psuedo-shadowban on the sub, and that is by having bots delete all of someone's comments. You have not provided evidence of them using this or abusing this. Reddit's ceo was talking about REDDIT shadowbans not individual sub bans. The whole point of reddit has always been that mods have control over how a sub is run and this includes bans, rules etc. As long as they don't break reddit rules it's fine. Site shadowbans are for spammers and people who harass people with alts.  Mods can use their subreddit bans any way they please the only way the users can deal with this is the community bringing it up or starting their own sub. You have not provided any evidence of them abusing power. Just because a post shows many more comments than are actually on display that doesn't mean many users are shadow banned. It can be individual comments deleted by the mods or reddit admins, and it can also be 1 user spamming every thread with multiple comments who is shadowbanned. I've dealt with my fair share of over zealous users who have posted several hundred pieces of spam in a day on multiple alts."
PKA,3cyi4v,HashishOil,4,Sun Jul 12 03:31:38 2015 UTC,This was posted earlier today with a lot less aggressive title.
PKA,3cyi4v,giricrak,2,Sat Jul 11 23:13:39 2015 UTC,This is not true. Automoderator or some other type of anti spam algorithm immediately deletes some comments from accounts which are new/inactive.  Try creating a new account and post a comment on here. You will not see it when logged off or when in incognito mode.
PKA,3cyi4v,aFullmetalTaco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:17:35 2015 UTC,I don't know if this subreddit has enough moderators to deal with all the alt account spam they would get if they just use normal ban.
PKA,3cyi4v,mcagent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:23:55 2015 UTC,"This is a good point. Worth noting that all new accounts are automatically temporarily shadowbanned on this sub, it seems."
PKA,3cyi4v,AyoJake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:48:13 2015 UTC,Wonder what woody thinks of this. Inb4 shadow ban.
PKA,3cyi4v,patheticlittlefuck,-1,Sun Jul 12 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"Probably the same mindset as me. Fuck haters, they're  fucking useless people. The obvious person this is directed at is /u/underscore_blues   Although he supposedly liked the show, it was never a positive response from him. Always nit-picking small negative things and always spreading a rumor.   I feel like I could hate a show and do the same thing he did for months and pull out "" I'm a fan of the show, sorry for not circlejerking everything they do "" card aswell. He was a toxic person, undeniably. And for months it was known.   Personally negative people should be removed. Even if I'm negative somewhere, fuck me. If people like something I'm trying to tear down I support them shadow banning me as a punishment.  This is /r/PKA where we love the hosts, not hate them."
PKA,3cyi4v,AyoJake,4,Sun Jul 12 04:32:53 2015 UTC,The hosts seem to want this reddit be full of yes men which to an extent it is. I disagree with things they say but I don't hate (I don't think at least) but how am I to know how much I can disagree with without being shadow banned cause woody thinks it's funny. Like I said how am I to know I won't get shadow banned for this?
PKA,3cyi4v,patheticlittlefuck,-2,Sun Jul 12 04:52:47 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take a genius to know when the line is crossed. As long as you have a point and aren't spurting out blatant negative bullshit, then you're fine. If you've watched the hosts they're not unethical people they understand. Even that poke at woodys failure to touch woodyslab a little everyday was taken lightly. ( cmon woody touch it )   Just don't be hateful without a reason. If the hosts suddenly start doing stuff like what was accused of, stealing and not providing the service in return. Great talk about it. If it's true most likely a response will be given.   Point is there is a line, you don't have to have a 155 iq like Kyle to see it."
PKA,3cyi4v,alt_account275,3,Sun Jul 12 05:01:34 2015 UTC,"Although he supposedly liked the show, it was never a positive response from him.

I feel like I could hate a show and do the same thing he did for months and pull out "" I'm a fan of the show, sorry for not circlejerking everything they do "" card aswell. He was a toxic person, undeniably. And for months it was known.    You call me out, mention me, so I'll defend myself. I did like the show for one.  And you're mistaken when saying I ""always"" did stuff. There were many positive comments that I left in the months leading to the ban. And you're spreading rumours yourself when saying I always ""spreaded a rumor"". Always, really, I was mistaken with one thing. You're a liar and you know it with that one. And from what I've seen with the recent Patreon threads, I'm not the only one who thinks like me.   always nitpicking   I remember on the show when they talked about it and half the examples they threw up were ""nitpicking"" themselves and they were mistaken e.g. I remember them saying I wrote ""fanboy"" yet I was calling out Lewis Hamilton fanboys in the r/formula1 sub, not even here. Woody doesnt mod there so it need not concern him, and it wasn't even a negative comment anyway.  Did you go by the word of Kyle, Chiz and Woody? Really? Because, yes, a sizeable number of comments of mine weren't good, but I also made very good comments also. And if you actually did your research, this was not a deal happening for ""months"".  I checked myself and the problem stretched only a few weeks.  That ""rumour"" that you speak of. Essentially, I assumed the $500 Patrons were real, and I said the money should be better spend on more trips. That's it. The funny thing is, and please take note of this, before Patreon we were allowed to say we wanted more trips, but now you somehow have to be a patron to have that opinion, and even then if you don't like it, cancel your pledge.  Also, shadow ban people like me? I liked the show, was on here a lot, and a simple ""Warning"" message from mods (cough cough Woody) would have been enough. I didn't realise there was anything wrong with my comments until it was pointed out to me, after I was banned."
PKA,3cyi4v,patheticlittlefuck,-1,Sun Jul 12 10:18:47 2015 UTC,"I assumed the $500 Patrons were real   don't assume.   I did like the show for one.   so why the fuck would you think patreon was a ploy to steal from kids? I mean you said you assumed, but if I recall correctly, it was a couple paragraphs of negative assumptions, on how people weren't getting what they were paying for, and the hosts are thieves.    before Patreon we were allowed to say we wanted more trips, but now you somehow have to be a patron to have that opinion, and even then if you don't like it, cancel your pledge.   Who says you have to be a patron to do anything?  If you want to suggest more trips, go for it. It would've been better if you had done that instead of assuming that PKA was ripping off fans.  Now where I said you were always doing it, is a bit of a exaggeration, it happened sometimes, I think your positive and negative comments were split 50/50. Sometimes I'd say, what a cool guy, fuck it have a upvote, other times, you could be quite an unrelenting dick, which is fine within reason.   Also what happened to you never coming back onto the /r/PKA forums?  I remember you saying something along the lines of -this is the last show I watch, and last time I come on /r/PKA -"
PKA,3cyi4v,alt_account275,0,Sun Jul 12 17:11:54 2015 UTC,Don't assume?  Don't assume I'm back here either. You mentioned my main account. I got a notification. I replied. Simple really.  Don't assume I've even watched any more of PKA. I haven't.  And you're blantantly misusing what I said to make it seem worse. Not going any further because it's not going anywhere.

PKA,3cyi4v,mcagent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:35:48 2015 UTC,It could be the same person twice. Or two people with their comments deleted who aren't shadowbanned. Or one shadowbanned person who made one comment and one person who just made a normal comment which was deleted by admins or the mods. It could even be 2 people who have had comments deleted by admins. Only the admins/mods would know
PKA,3cyi4v,Dre3K,-2,Sun Jul 12 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"Yes very common on this sub, mod doesn't like your opinion? You get shadow banned. I don't have stats but on the green stickied post at the top, it says there are 12 comments, only 9 show up, that means 3 people are shadow banned, 25% of the comments.   Someone I know has had about 6 profiles banned for basically criticizing harshly. It usually works like this, you make over 100 good positive comments and the 1 time you say something negative you get shadow banned. So if you comment enough, eventually you will say something that a mod may consider trolling or hating."
PKA,3cyi4v,TheUglyPotato,0,Sat Jul 11 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a load of shit.  Show some proof. It could be the original commenters deleted their accounts.   And who is this one person? Your friend?  Underscore_blues didn't only post negatively one time. It was constant.   People are allowed to have a opinion, just not constant hate. It's the same as people who criticize YT videos and say ""wow ---- I was only giving you feedback as help"" no, instead of hating offer a solution. Not just    Fuck the hosts they rob patrons and don't give them what they pay for. etc etc.   Unrelenting Hate has got to stop everywhere, and there's only 1 guy we know has gotten shadow banned, and it was well beyond justified."
PKA,3cyi4v,TreeQuiz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:46:30 2015 UTC,"I mod an active subreddit that gets a lot of trolls, I've been a mod there for about a year and 6 months (/r/codcompetitive). If I ban an obvious troll he is calling all of us idiots and spamming us with shit, making 5 new accounts and continuing. On the other hand if we shadowbanned this obvious with automod then he finds out in about a week.    If someone is just being a bit of an asshole but doesn't seem like a guy just looking to troll, normally we just ban him for a few days and tell him why and to cool off.     However these stats you are pulling may not be accurate. For example, they may have automod setup to remove a post that contain a specific word, this could be a link to the newest PKA/PKN early so that the patreon only information rule is easy to keep in control, this could be general hate words, or anything similar."

PKA,3cxlq1,momdildothrowaway,6,Sat Jul 11 18:25:24 2015 UTC,Yes. The furthest I've gone (and probably the furthest I'll go) is fantasizing about her and masturbating on her bed when she's not home.
PKA,3cxlq1,momdildothrowaway,4,Sat Jul 11 20:58:58 2015 UTC,Hmm well that implies that you find her hot and would like to have sex with her in a hypothetical situation. Correct?

I'm just curious if you have a clue about why this is since it differs from the majority of answers. We've got to keep in mind this is a very small sample size though.
PKA,3cxlq1,momdildothrowaway,2,Sat Jul 11 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"I think it happened when I switched to an all black school, where many people didn't want to be seen talking to me just because I wasn't black, everything just hit me at once. I developed severe social anxiety, depression, adhd, add, an incest fetish. I told my mom about these things (besides the incest thing of course), and she just looks down on me saying I'm a lazy piece of shit and I just want an excuse to get adderall and xanax. I asked to see a psychiatrist, but she thinks I'm faking, which is probably because I was this outgoing smart kid before we moved to this shit hole of a school. I kick myself every single day for not convincing her to let me stay at my old school. I could've lived a happy normal teenage life with friends, but now I feel like my heart is gonna beat out off my chest when I do something as simple as answer phone call, or walk in the store to buy something. To say I hate my life is a massive understatement."

You need to tell somebody you trust to 100%, I'd recommend a therapist of some sort, and let everything out. I'd check to see if the person I'm talking to has sworn secrecy (It's a normal thing in Sweden where I live but I don't know about other countries) and if she has I'd talk about the incest thing too. If not I'd get ahold of somebody to talk to anonymously. Good luck and trust me that things will get better. I'd love an update from you in a while to see how things are going :)"

I can't stand how woody has to adjust the reigns on his high horse when he hears about someone buying a car that is fun to drive. Not everyone sees cars as just a utility, some people have a passion for cars, and not everyone wants to eventually resale their car. I sure as hell am not going to give up my automotive hobby just to please woodys financial views. As long as you're not going into debt to buy something that you are passionate about and you have a steady income, woody shouldn't judge as harshly as he does. Not everyone wants to drive around a beat up Toyota every day.   Sorry for the rant, just thought the sport car segment was hard to watch, especially when he cut off Kyle.

PKA,3d03uo,iRef_oczoro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"Buying more real estate was a good investment though, thats probably why you respect his financial decisions. Also I don't see why you care about his opinion. It's just an opinion."

And I'm fine with his opinions, if he sees cars as a utility that should have the bare minimum amount of capital invested in it then that's fine. He can put his money towards other things that he enjoys. But he shouldn't be insulting someone for putting money into something like a car they enjoy."

PKA,3d03uo,MattR2752,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"Cars are not an investment to be sold later, so if anybody does see them like that, they have issues. Woody and Kyle are close friends, if Kyle isnt bothered by how Woody is talking to him then there is no reason for anyone else to be."

I spend a lot of my time on the internet, so I watch a lot of stuff. Between youtube and netflix, I've probably spent more time on the internet than most people. More than once I've shut off a show or switched to something else because it was just that painful. The Office comes to mind, but I've never had something like that with PKA.

In the end she didn't defeat the grief/Babadook. Instead she learned to live with it.  She kept it locked away in the basement and coped with it.  Sometimes it was bad, sometimes it was more manageable. It never fully went away but she was able to live her life."

PKA,3cu2vg,Jakecav555,2,Sat Jul 11 11:16:51 2015 UTC,"Did they say when? I don't think they should, incase they get ddos'd. I assume that would cause it not to count. Also... last I heard Woody sort of suggested playing Minecraft but Kyle didn't want to play it the whole time and Woody said he could just be there for part of it. I'd personally prefer they all be there the whole time however they do it. But that was said on one of the previous PKNs so I'm not sure if things have changed. Anyone know?"
PKA,3cu2vg,tonybateman,3,Sat Jul 11 11:54:26 2015 UTC,There's no way that all of the hosts will be there the whole time.

PKA,3cu2vg,tonybateman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:55:02 2015 UTC,"Listen more carefully. Woody wanted to break two records. One for the longest live stream of a game like minecraft, and also one for the longest podcast. also, not all podcasts are live so technically it wouldn't have to be a live show to break the record."
PKA,3cu2vg,ByyChase,3,Fri Jul 10 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just meant they shouldn't say the day or people will interrupt it. Didn't mean they should do it live. That would not be a good idea. And as far as the game goes I just think if Kyle won't be there the whole time if it's just Minecraft then they should play something else for the show instead."

PKA,3cykha,JaysonBourne,6,Sat Jul 11 23:55:55 2015 UTC,How does Woody losing subs hurt PKA? A new Pka channel would take ages to build when Woody has a partnership and the viewers already. The show is getting less viewers now because it is uploaded on so many other platforms compared to the old days when it was just Youtube. I bet it  has more views now then ever before.
PKA,3cykha,daniel2090,3,Sat Jul 11 23:40:17 2015 UTC,From a long term marketing perspective this is probably the right move but honestly I think they're just happy where the show is at and don't want to take time to build up the audience on a new channel even if it would benefit them by getting new viewers long term.
PKA,3cykha,Rtat,3,Sat Jul 11 23:38:18 2015 UTC,How is it being killed by Woody's channel?

PKA,3cykha,Pixelsplitterreturns,5,Sun Jul 12 00:09:10 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't, how does woody losing subscribers get it less exposure?    Do you mean less than it did, it gets broadcast to 1,000,000 subscription pages instead of 1,100,000 or whatever? Because on a new channel it would be broadcast to like 150,000 or however many people move over."
PKA,3cykha,SonnyWane,7,Sun Jul 12 00:18:10 2015 UTC,Woody's channel would then be the equivalent to the sahara desert.

PKA,3cxqk7,EPOSZ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:49:31 2015 UTC,Reddit has been spouting this off for years while never doing anything about it. How short is every reddit users attention span?
PKA,3cxqk7,tobieapb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"I think I agree. Shadowbanning should be only for bots and spammers.  However circumventing a ban is easy enough, so a reasonable/good way of stoping a troll or toxic person from spewing vitriol or poisoning a community is actually shadow banning. Because it delays their creating a new account or changing their username.  Since this is a gray area, subreddit's mods should come to a decision to shadowban a troll together."
PKA,3cxqk7,tobieapb,0,Sat Jul 11 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"Even if he is the co-founder and current CEO his is only an opinion (with great weight) but he does not ""owns"" the individual subreddits.  This is like the invention that grows beyond its inventors. The community decides if shadowbanning is valid or not. And my guess is that it should/will be on a cases by case basis. And by case I mean each subreddit.  If you reach a sub that says that one of the punishments for bad behavior is shadowbanning you were forewarned. Also Reddit can't neccesarily enforce how certain tools have to be used or applied without stepping on freedom of speech terrain. At the very least, the same freedom or speech and anti-censorship arguments raised against Pao."

Now they switched to a new one and now everyone gets to act like we actually did something when nothing's gonna change.

All that hate directed at one person might be considered harassment.  And you may say, ""oh well then he just shouldn't go to /r/fatpeoplehate, but he's got a big enough social media presence that he would be hearing about it non-stop from all sorts of other sources. I doubt that's a place he ever visits and he definitely heard about him being their ""poster child""."

PKA,3cz87z,Billy_Not_Really,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"So woody can take topic verbatim from that site as well?  For those who aren't aware though Voat is a reddit clone. Seriously. Reddit is open source code so someone took that code changed the name and branding then launched the website with a lot less user moderation, the emphasis on free speech I guess.   I don't think the world needs another site just to spew hatred but to each their own."
PKA,3cz87z,Zebzk,0,Sun Jul 12 12:06:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a problem in having a clone. It creates competition. If you compare Intel vs AMD, they both create processors, but both have to keep innovating to keep customers.  A great example is Twitch and YouTube. YouTube is creating YouTube Gaming, which basically competes with Twitch. It is rumored that it will allow streamers to encode video with 9000kb/s, but with Twitch right now the max is 3300kb/s. With this competiton, Twitch will surely increase this limit.  I believe that a minor reason why Ellen Pao stepped down as the Reddit CEO was Voat. It showed that the Reddit community searched for a alternative because of the censorship and unapproved actions."

Also she is essentially the exact opposite of what reddit, the population not the company, stands for. She mishandled many different situations and after over 200k (probably like 3/4 forged) of the reddit consumers petition to have you removed she should have gotten removed, no questions asked.   edit: just wanted to clarify that i was disarming what you expected woody to say, but imo woody will see the redditors side."

They had a falling out. Both sides said there point of view. Yes they both don't agree what happen. But Lefty never bad mouth him to other people.   And disagreeing on what they think happen or what was talked about is not back stabbing. If anything the PKA crew has talked more crap about lefty then he ever had when he was still on youtube. If anyone is doing this its PKA crew but i don't think they really are either they are just bitter to what happen still a bit.

PKA,3cuxp2,tobieapb,4,Sat Jul 11 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"One of the reasoms youTube is not an optimal option right now, is that not all views are monetizable. specifically mobile views.  Currently over 66-75 of views (depending on channel content and type) can be mobile. That means that you'd have to survive with a 25% of tour views. The fact that networks aren't blindly paying a fixed CPM ($ per 1,000 views on the counter) means that any video effort is done with the knowledge that there is little money to be made.  This does not mean that he is a moneywhore. But rather, that the positive feedback loop of doing it, geting community feedback, getting paid well and feeling good/high enough to motivate yourself to work on the next one, is not there.  I'd love to have those Woody videos again, but being honest youTube has poisoned the waters (shunning gaming, mobile views, etc). It seems that they want to come back from that, but only time will tell.  If they do, it is up to Woody to see if the money he has made in Minecraft is enough so that he does not wishes to do youTube hardcore and on a schedule."

In truth, he's set for life, he could have whatever he wants.  this post was just a piece of nostalgia that hit me, I remember coming home dead happy after it was a shit day, and just having a pure moment between myself and woody, where I could forget about everything, and just live in the moment.  I truly loved everything he has put out ever, and maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, but I think I wanted this post to be more of a reminder of his work, and just a overall, thank you.

PKA,3cuwmz,craigo2247,6,Fri Jul 10 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"Basically the same as Google Now for android users - (something you can activate by saying ""Okay Google"" or other methods depending on phone). In some cases, it's basically just a speech interpreter and it'll google your question. If your request is something common like ""call <person>, text <person>, open <app>, or set an alarm for <time>"", it'll do that for you, and it also has a good amount pre-programmed ways to respond to stuff like ""what's the weather like today"". Both Google Now and Siri also have funny easter eggs and other pre-programmed responses to jokes and references.  I think in general, Siri tries to behave more like a human depending on what you ask it, but Google Now essentially has the same functionality. I will say, most of the time, it's easier to just do/google the thing yourself without any speech interpenetration if you're at home, and it's usually awkward to tell your phone to do stuff in public lol, so most people only use it as a novelty.  Finally, to sprinkle in some bias, android master race :)."
PKA,3cuwmz,S0urPatchAdults,2,Sat Jul 11 00:06:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in depth response!  Yeah that's basically what I figured. And I agree, it's easier for me to just google something then use a tool like Google Now or Siri. My experience with Google now has usually been me using it around friends and then one of them shouting ""big dicks""."
PKA,3cuwmz,Nugrun,3,Sat Jul 11 00:18:16 2015 UTC,One thing that has really improved over the years for siri is Talk to text. It gets it right id say 9/10 times. unless you throw some weird slang in there. I changed my Siri to the UK one so she sounds british. aha

I feel like not many on the sub will get the joke - I made over a dozen emotes for Woody's Twitch streams, [purely out of the goodness of my heart ;) ], many months before Woody decided to get his sub button going and have had them ready ever since, although the running thing is that it's my fault that they weren't added for a while.

PKA,3cuwmz,patheticlittlefuck,0,Sat Jul 11 05:27:05 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's an inside joke for anyone wondering..  just fucking with you, I post that reply whenever I see you comment on anything, whether it be yt, or reddit, or twitch."
PKA,3cuwmz,S0urPatchAdults,2,Sat Jul 11 05:52:35 2015 UTC,"Indeed, indeed. I didn't think that you were genuinely mad at me and believed I was slacking on making emotes lol.

PKA,3cuwmz,vanguard_anon,17,Sat Jul 11 05:58:58 2015 UTC,"I fall deeper in love with Siri all the time.  Yesterday I learned you can say, ""Remind me to grab the charger from my car when I leave home"".  She uses the GPS on my phone, realizes I left my house, and reminds me.  While she does google things when she doesn't know the answer I'm finding that there are a surprising amount of things that she can do.  Siri sucked when she was released so I went years without noticing here and even switched to android.  Now  I'm playing around with her again and I'm super impressed with how far she has come.  I have no idea if Android's feature is as good but I'm told there is something about to release that's going to be cool."
PKA,3cuwmz,AyoJake,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:45:25 2015 UTC,Yeah the more I hear about Siri now makes it seem like she's turned into more of a personal assistant which is pretty damn cool. I've been pretty convinced to switch back to Apple and all these things I learn about Siri is just icing on top.

PKA,3crdz3,Viiro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:29:43 2015 UTC,That's what everyone said about Lefty getting kicked off.

PKA,3cs8bz,BuzzGaming,6,Fri Jul 10 10:24:01 2015 UTC,"Wax was an amazing guest, he needs to be on again, dude is actually well known he has worked on projects with ray william johnson and an epic rap battle of history."

PKA,3cs8bz,GoGoldorGoHome,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:46:36 2015 UTC,I remember when wings used that song in a black ops 2 video.  Most of wings old videos with wax songs were amazing

PKA,3cs8bz,-Replicated,3,Fri Jul 10 10:47:59 2015 UTC,It was an awsome episode. Totally worth a rewatch!

PKA,3cushi,sikuaka,4,Fri Jul 10 23:12:39 2015 UTC,Idk but wings needs to bring that series back

PKA,3cushi,FellowFucknard,0,Fri Jul 10 23:41:45 2015 UTC,Why is this getting downvoted.  This thread clearly breaks rule #1
PKA,3cushi,FernPlant3000,7,Sat Jul 11 02:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think its because the silent majority that browses this sub loves wings. In end its the people who rule a democracy, not the rules me friend!"
PKA,3cushi,murderouspulse,-7,Sat Jul 11 02:44:58 2015 UTC,maybe its because you're acting like a dick
PKA,3cs3t5,lolimdivine,4,Fri Jul 10 09:18:11 2015 UTC,"I want more wacky guests, they're fun."
PKA,3cs3t5,HitHard,3,Fri Jul 10 11:28:33 2015 UTC,"On Twitter, he told Taylor he would come on again soon.  Edit- http://imgur.com/p4XYkUr Screenshot of TMartn saying he would come on."
PKA,3cs3t5,wvwildman,4,Fri Jul 10 21:11:03 2015 UTC,He didn't really add anything to the show last time.
PKA,3cs3t5,IZosco,2,Fri Jul 10 09:43:24 2015 UTC,i think the reason that he didnt add anything to the show last time is that he was alot younger(19) than all the hosts and didnt have any real life expierences.
PKA,3cs3t5,gimmley,0,Fri Jul 10 14:43:23 2015 UTC,"I thought he was excellent on the show, but idk if he could be a host"

PKA,3cs3t5,IZosco,3,Fri Jul 10 14:13:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah he has done two episodes recently and I thoroughly enjoyed both of them, I thought he was not only hilarious but contributed to most conversations"
PKA,3cs3t5,Matt16assassin,3,Fri Jul 10 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"I think they're referring to Tmartn, not Tucker."
PKA,3cs3t5,kingtantan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:37:28 2015 UTC,Murka asked him he said yeah but this was weeks ago
PKA,3cs3t5,AVENGEDxGANGSTA,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:32:03 2015 UTC,Top 90% guaranteed. Why? Because the CoD talk would take up the entire show
PKA,3cs3t5,Ehvasion,-4,Sat Jul 11 00:36:15 2015 UTC,Please stop asking on the subbreddit. At least once a week people have posted a guest suggestion for tmar.
PKA,3cw6kz,sikuaka,10,Sat Jul 11 07:45:48 2015 UTC,I thought it was before I started watching it. I firmly believe it lives up to hype.
PKA,3cw6kz,TomothyWTF,3,Sat Jul 11 07:48:57 2015 UTC,Have you watched it?
PKA,3cw6kz,joystickjoe,4,Sat Jul 11 07:50:50 2015 UTC,"No, it's just you.  http://imgur.com/DqatAwt"
PKA,3cw6kz,cashjake,3,Sat Jul 11 10:02:47 2015 UTC,I always heard people talk about how great it is and tried watching the first 2 eps and never got into it but a friend convinced me to watch a couple more and now ive seen the entire show 3 times and just started the books. S1 E4 is where it gets good.
PKA,3cw6kz,DabstheGOAT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:06:19 2015 UTC,"I think so, it's also just not my kind of show"
PKA,3cw6kz,ImPower,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:06:35 2015 UTC,"I think a show can be overrated but still really good. I will watch the show as it comes out, but I don't freak out like the people on /r/gameofthrones do"
PKA,3cw6kz,ModWilliam,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:40:44 2015 UTC,Nope. Incredible source material and the production value is as high as any tv show ever.

PKA,3cu83j,PeachRainbowTea,0,Fri Jul 10 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"that was a thought of mine as well.  i wouldn't do it cause something you may have said might've struck another person negatively, I'd prefer it to be anon- and everyone just there cause they love pka."

PKA,3cu83j,ERIPPER35,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"Doors open 9, event started last time around 9:30 Rentals come with gun, mask, loader/hopper, and air tank"

PKA,3cu83j,fathertimexx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:29:15 2015 UTC,Cool man!  I'll be wearing jeans and either a black compression shirt or an orange t shirt. Maybe knee pads :)

I don't know, that ""Barack Obama for next pka"" post was pretty much the sarcastic indicator that it's getting annoying as fuck to see them."
PKA,3cu76g,patheticlittlefuck,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:37:11 2015 UTC,At one point their was a sticky? thread for all request but people kept posting separate threads any way.
PKA,3cu76g,wvwildman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:21:37 2015 UTC,Oh you mean to make room for the shitty posts halfway through the week when every second of the last weeks pka has been covered multiple times? Well we must have room for that
PKA,3cu76g,ThunderStun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:25:39 2015 UTC,People won't follow the rule and the mods won't enforce it.
PKA,3cqt3d,ryryck,25,Fri Jul 10 01:02:38 2015 UTC,I'd prefer a day in the life style video. Or two...
PKA,3cqt3d,CruiseBiscuits,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:06:26 2015 UTC,"Two might not make sense,  imo. One very long day in the life would be perfect."
PKA,3cqt3d,CruiseBiscuits,6,Fri Jul 10 01:15:02 2015 UTC,He should do as many day in the life's as he can. I can't get enough.
PKA,3cqt3d,Cambodio,9,Fri Jul 10 01:38:16 2015 UTC,Woody just seems like a giant coming out of that little closet door.
PKA,3cqt3d,flyingturtle29,12,Fri Jul 10 01:35:48 2015 UTC,I think a long video would be cool
PKA,3cqt3d,flyingturtle29,3,Fri Jul 10 01:05:49 2015 UTC,"I agree,  the longer the better. Let's see the flight,  let's see the course,  let's see you at dinner,  let's see everything."
PKA,3cqt3d,CruiseBiscuits,2,Fri Jul 10 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he would consider putting a GoPro on his mask and uploading that footage as well. I know Kyle will already be doing this with the scorpion tail thing, but it would be awesome to see Woody's POV, too."
PKA,3cqt3d,Indydegrees2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:56:57 2015 UTC,I wasn't impressed with what Kyle's videos turned out to be. He really talked them up.
PKA,3cqt3d,Radarplay,3,Fri Jul 10 02:42:18 2015 UTC,Day in the life!
PKA,3cqt3d,CommunistAngel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:18:05 2015 UTC,One long vlog a day!!!
PKA,3cqt3d,Stickyballs96,5,Fri Jul 10 01:20:36 2015 UTC,Day in the life!
PKA,3cqt3d,Stickyballs96,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:11:40 2015 UTC,Woody how many times have you hit your head in that little room?
PKA,3cqt3d,CucumberMilkshake,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:59:12 2015 UTC,I'd definitely prefer a long video. Too much is better than too little! I feel like the rafting and cliff trip was more like a vacation than a business trip. I'd like a vlog where you record everthing for atleast one of the days. It would be a really entertaining video.
PKA,3cqt3d,CrashFilms,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:03:20 2015 UTC,"Btw guys, this course is 10 miles away from me. I can confirm it's epic. If your close and have nothing going on, go hang out with the guys. It'll be a great weekend."
PKA,3cqt3d,RSK-senpai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:17:20 2015 UTC,Definitely gonna try and be there. I'm from Belgium but visiting my girlfriend in Wisconsin. It's an hour drive so I should be able to get there. The site store seemed down tho
PKA,3cqt3d,patheticlittlefuck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:23:30 2015 UTC,Woody finally started using the selfie stick! That makes me more happy than it should :)   And day in the life video would be better. Be sure to include lots of footage of you guys chillin out.
PKA,3cvbtt,Ramyou,12,Sat Jul 11 02:03:24 2015 UTC,Wow never herd this idea before.
PKA,3cvbtt,Nugrun,0,Sat Jul 11 02:09:33 2015 UTC,"definitely dry, but you're right, this has got to be one of the most cliche' answers I could think of."
PKA,3cvbtt,patheticlittlefuck,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:50:17 2015 UTC,?????????????????????
PKA,3cvbtt,Nugrun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:51:52 2015 UTC,"Because the whole point of the post was to keep it old school. Back in the day, those were some of the best episodes to watch, not saying that none of the episodes without wings or lefty are bad, but it would be nice to go back to the first golden age of PKA. Sometimes the most cliche answers turn out to be great episodes."
PKA,3cvbtt,zzFuzzy,3,Sat Jul 11 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"Lefty would not come on. Pretty sure at the end of that debacle he would have not have considered himself on good terms with any of the hosts.  With that said though, I am a big Wings fan. I am always hoping he has the time to come on."
PKA,3cvbtt,zzFuzzy,0,Sat Jul 11 02:40:56 2015 UTC,"I think the whole lefty situation was sorta blown out of proportion. Sure it was big enough for lefty to not be on the show, but whenever the host mention him their tone doesnt seem like they have any hate towards him. I hope he would come on for atleast half the episode, and I would love to see wings again like on 200."
PKA,3cvbtt,Cambodio,2,Sat Jul 11 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"Woody has never really said anything bad, but Kyle has straight up said some negative things about the dude.  It isn't a bad thing, but their whole thing about it was that they never knew Lefty. He was a friend of Wings, who even after Wings was gone, never opened up to them.  Of course I would like to see him on, cause I enjoyed him on the show (though like everyone he has his downs), I just can't see that happening."
PKA,3cvbtt,IZosco,5,Sat Jul 11 03:08:35 2015 UTC,Everyone wears a Chiz hat
