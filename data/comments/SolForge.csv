SolForge,3e1ptz,ItsNotLeon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:16:18 2015 UTC,It seems uncanny to me that he actually pulled it off. I didn't know this kind of over-the-top strategy was actually viable. It really surprised me that he managed it. I didn't know I'd be the only impressed one.
SolForge,3e1ptz,ComplA1n_Bot,3,Wed Jul 22 07:00:37 2015 UTC,you copied pasted a log into reddit instead of summarizing it and making our lives easier? People have been doing that for YEARS now...

SolForge,3dowu7,jermbug,2,Sat Jul 18 22:29:35 2015 UTC,Thank you all for your replies :) That sounds like an awesome deal.. i can't wait for the next one.
SolForge,3dmuua,diablo-solforge,8,Fri Jul 17 15:38:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't found them that frustrating, and I think they're below-average as a draft strategy.  They're auto-picks if you're in Darkforged, whereas the bound guys were auto-picks no matter what you were doing.  Darkforged aren't that different from drafting Abominations (and to a lesser extent Dinos and Robots) - if you decide to put yourself there, then you're there, and the value of your in-theme cards goes way up."
SolForge,3dmuua,themarkslack,2,Fri Jul 17 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think my read is pretty in-line with yours. They're powerful tribal, but I'm not sure they are much more than that. They seem like the second coming of the Shardbound series in draft, but with the stacking effects you can get with Abominations. It is brutal to get stomped by a Darkforged-heavy deck... but that's true of any really themed deck in draft that has high synergy."
SolForge,3dmuua,scarmichael42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:34:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that they're below average in the average case. It's just frustrating that in the best case they're one of the best, if not the best, lines of play you can see in draft.  Great point about the bound guys being autopick no matter what you're doing."
SolForge,3dmuua,Gardevi,5,Fri Jul 17 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting - I actually hold the exact opposite opinion. I really, really like Darkforged, what they bring to the drafting process and the actual draft games.   It's true that drafting them (especially the rare ones) does limit your options. It doesn't remove them, and there's a definite cost associated with drafting Darkforged. Plus, by now, so many people have drafted them that I've noticed that the algorithm puts them at a sort of ""top tier common"" status, along with cards like Ionic Warcharger and Swampmoss Ancient. You can get a lot of them, but it's not very likely.   But back to limiting options, not removing them. Let's say you have just one of the rare Darkforged, and you're in UT. Pack rolls around and the pick is between Darkstone Asir and Blood Boon. What do you pick? Well, The Darkstone Asir is an incredible source of board control... if you already have the Darkforged to support it, as otherwise its body is really weak. Of course, if it's fairly early in the draft, you probably pick the Darkforged and hope to get a critical mass. But more and more, I'm taking the Blood Boon here. Blood Boon is an incredible card that can make any creature a threat in rank 1 (a very important tempo-setting rank), and the Darkforged - while good - do require that critical mass in order to steamroll. I find I prefer taking good cards over just mindlessly picking every Darkforged, because it limits those times you take the darkforged, then the draft algorithm throws you a curve and you get very few. It's better to draft with some consistency, because Darkforged suck if you can't get that critical mass.   They provide interesting play patterns, both for and against Darkforged. There are constant choices in game whether you choose to jam Darkforged to try and get the big payoff from their abilities, or go a more conservative route and level the more reliable cards. Darkforged are all smaller than the average card, with exception to Darkshard Witch, which doesn't affect the board. The rares are the exception in this case, which are just shy of average, but average and then good when you play more. When I notice my opponent trying to amass Darkforged, I aggressively block them and level spells that can deal with the Spring Dryad-esque Darkforged - cards like Blood Boil and Blood Bindings effectively deal with large rank 2 or 3 Dusk Hammers  with just one play, while they had to play several small creature in order to pump the Dusk Hammer in the first place.   As for the comparison to the Bound cycle from Set 3, I can't speak to that comparison - I wasn't around for set 3 drafts. One thing I want to point out though, is that all of the Bound cards improve your existing board through board control while being underleveled and average/small size. The Darkforged have to be on-level to be effective, and they are small, and require a few to get up to the power level of the Bound cards. Not sure this comparison is apt.   tl;dr - Yes, Darkforged can be very powerful and one-dimensional.. but it's not free. It comes at several costs, and is controllable by both yourself and your opponents."
SolForge,3dmuua,Coachpoker,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"Seemed to me was no different than cards like that free-spell cycle (e.g. Stormspear) or my good pals the Ruthless Wanderers, just that you have much more options to build from with Darkforged.  Sure, it's a risk.  Lots of risky choices in draft, always has been.  Take the solid, or invest in something risky and see if your luck pans out.  Fun times!"
SolForge,3dmuua,vandergus,2,Fri Jul 17 17:28:28 2015 UTC,How topical...  http://imgur.com/Cf9WiVq  Current darkforged count was 5. I picked the Dusk Hammer cause I couldn't pass up the chance of four color darkforged domination. YOLO!
SolForge,3dmuua,mjjdota,3,Sat Jul 18 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"High risk high reward seems okay by me. I draft regularly, and I'll say that I remember getting smashed by Darkforged cards a lot more than I remember times when they are ineffective. But I'm sure both happen. In my own drafts they have been ineffective typically."
SolForge,3dmuua,vandergus,9,Fri Jul 17 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"It's hard to judge when they are being ineffective for an opponent because, in that case, they usually go unplayed. You may not see the 2-3 darkforged they speculatively picked early in the draft as they just sit in their hand. We only get the see the successful darkforged decks when they crush us, so it kind of skews our perception."
SolForge,3dmuua,Flooping_Pigs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"I just started a week and a half ago, and I 4-0'd a casual draft my first time because of the Darkforged cards.  My first pick was Shroudthorn Splicer, which I thought would be okay in a Grow-wide deck too. The other choices were kind of weak. Anyway, ended up snagging a Duskhammer, two Shamblers, and four Asirs."
SolForge,3dmuua,thefifth5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"In my experience, 5 darkforged is usually enough"
SolForge,3dmuua,thaddeus_v,3,Sat Jul 18 06:14:47 2015 UTC,"I've been using 6 as my target, which gives me a a nice rule of thumb: I'll grab darkforged N if I'm in pack N or earlier.  Obviously I'll break that rule if the other cards on offer are even worse, or if there's other synergy with the card (Umbraskin Yeti + Warlord, etc)."
SolForge,3dmuua,thefifth5,2,Sat Jul 18 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you are all about the number 5. ;)"
SolForge,3dobl5,YinKuza,5,Fri Jul 17 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"IMHO, best combo right now is aggressive T/U. They can drop a metric ton of 6/7s and 7/7s in level one, then just finish the opponent off in 2 or early 3 (and Dinosaur tribal is actually a thing).    With that said, all of the combos are viable, but the generally weakest faction overall is Nekrum. N still has some solid Heroics, but its list of commons and rare is very bad (with a few exceptions).    Strongest overall is probably T. Not too many amazing Heroics, but the selection of commons and rares is very good."
