soccerbanners,3cszth,ContigoSiempre,3,Fri Jul 10 23:59:07 2015 UTC,"Depay’s story is interesting, if not uncommon – that of the troubled child blessed with extraordinary talent. He had a testing childhood, as the son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother who separated when he was four years old. Any child who has lived through a parental break-up will know only too well the deep emotional pain it can cause; any study will speak of the damaging psychological consequences it can have. Depay is one of many who experienced this, and the effects clearly had an impact on his development that endures to this day: in 2012 he dropped Depay from the back of his shirt, reasoning that Depay is his father’s name and that he has no contact with him. Memphis is the name he would wear.   via FourFourTwo"

soccerbanners,3baxl1,hailthefsm,5,Sat Jun 27 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"One time, in a penalty shootout, we went through 21 penalties and got to the keeper for the other team. My teammate had just scored so we were up 6-5. The keeper hit it top left but I tipped it onto the crossbar and over... He was crying while my team started celebrating and I felt horrible. He was incredible as well, he had saved 4 penalties. We talked for like 15 minutes about the season and cup while they were presenting medals and I'm still friends with him today. We even played on the same team when he moved, but he always told me to never commit a foul in the box because he was terrified of the pressures of penalties after that shootout."
soccerbanners,3baxl1,jackgrealish,2,Sat Jun 27 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"That sounds horrible. I HATED taking penalties after that, and I always deferred penalties. It's crazy how easy they are to take in practice but the pressure just magnifies."

Mind you, I haven't seen the other thread and what people were saying and I'm basing my comment solely on what you wrote.  Here's an example: I found John Terry's tears after the 2008 CL final to be quite an enjoyable sight."
soccerbanners,3baxl1,jackgrealish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely get it, I support Villa, so of course I'm happy when a rival team loses, but to me, I celebrate the benefit that has on Villa's position in the table, not the despair it brings to other fans. I'm nowhere near perfect at this though. I was beyond happy when Germany beat Argentina because of how disappointed the Argentinians were, but I try to focus on celebrating the successes rather than failures.  For example, I play in goal for penalty shootouts often, and if I make a save, I will celebrate, but if the opponent hits it over or wide, I do not. I feel like it's no fair on an opponent to celebrate the fact that they just failed.  IMO at least, most of the comment streams are directed at insulting the penalty taker and laughing at her failure, not celebrating the German save, or win."

soccerbanners,37fhg2,Corporation_tshirt,10,Wed May 27 08:00:48 2015 UTC,Not ironic at all. They have; a) The jurisdiction b) The legal system and experience in anti-corruption.racketeering gained via dealing with organised crime c) Very little to lose - by not caring as much as the rest of the world about football they are in a great position to get their rubber-gloved hand up into FIFA's colon without fear of blowback. No European country could do this and expect to get a World Cup ever again.
soccerbanners,37fhg2,Deadcatb0unce,7,Wed May 27 13:24:16 2015 UTC,That probably helps. Other countries don't want to fuck with FIFA so their football doesn't get destroyed. Sports give money to the government and in most countries soccer is the biggest sport.

Last night he was still critical but the family was still hopeful. ""I talk to him all the time,"" said his mother. ""I once I was in a coma, I know he can hear us.""  After the sudden death of Gregory Mertens (24) the football world was again shaken by sad news. Tim Nicot suddenly fell down in the second half of a friendly football match in Hemiksem. He was immediately resuscitated by a player, a nurse and shortly afterwards by the emergency services. At the UZA he underwent surgery. His chances were highly uncertain and his condition last night was still very worrying. Doctors checked whether he would react to stimuli, but he did not for the time being. Nicot was held in an artificial coma for three days.  His closest relatives did not leave his side. ""We constantly talk to him. I had a stroke and was in a coma, I know you can hear people in this state,"" says his mother. ""I told him that everybody expects that he'll recover. And he knows that now on Facebook he has more than 4,000 likes. That should give him courage and strength."" His brother Steven (pictured right beside mother Sonja) even suggested a CD with ""silly songs"" in which Tim gladly went wild. ""A friend told me that he knows someone who was in a coma and responded to his beloved music.""  Thanks /u/TheNarrator23 for the translation."

soccerbanners,32dhiy,Italianjobe,2,Sun Apr 12 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah the problem with Milan lies in the management, they dont care about the club anymore at all and whatever good moves they make is canceled out by many bad ones. Imo they shouldnt have sold Ibra and Thiago, if Thiago Silva had stayed, milans backline wouldnt be so bad"
soccerbanners,32dhiy,Italianjobe,4,Sun Apr 12 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"I don't blame the fans for protesting, just a shame, im a big fan of the seria a and the 2 milan clubs falling seemed to cause the big decline in europe.

soccerbanners,32dhiy,logari123,3,Sun Apr 12 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely. I'm 100% for the selling of our club.

However, I dont think its ideal for the club to fall into foreign hands because who knows what could happen, just because the club may be sold doesnt mean the new owner will fix all the problems. The same goes with Italian owners but I think that a foreign owner is more of a risk"
