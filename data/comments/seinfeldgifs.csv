seinfeldgifs,3dpnnh,imgurisblockd4me,2,Sun Jul 19 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"Ward, I know there are tutorials out there, but what programs do you use to convert videos to gifs? What's the high level process for making them?"
seinfeldgifs,3dpnnh,WardCannon,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"Well i'll show the process..  First I watch the movie/show/YouTube video on VLC Media Player.  Then, I use VLC to record the moment I want the gif to be, and then import frames to layers from that clip in Photoshop. (Photoshop > File > Import Video Frames to Layers > Navigate to clip)  Make the gif (and if I need to use After Effects, save the gif and open it in After Effects)  Finally you get the final gif in Photoshop and save for web. (Photoshop > File > Save For Web...)  Does that give you a little idea? I hope so. If it doesn't, ask me some more questions, I'd love to help :)"
seinfeldgifs,3dpnnh,imgurisblockd4me,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that helps a lot! I usually just look for an existing gif and then work from there but I would love to make OC. Plus, using existing gifs lowers the quality each time it's exported from what I've read.    I've been using gimp 2 for small gifs and have been manually tracking the item I'm adding in for each frame (see here my gif I made for a twitch streamer).    Is there an easy way to move an object around in PS like with tweens in Flash as a comparable example?"
seinfeldgifs,3dpnnh,WardCannon,2,Mon Jul 20 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"So I've never used Flash, but I looked up what you meant. I'm pretty sure you can do that in Photoshop, though I've never done it.  Motion tracking can't be done in Photoshop, so the best think you can do is move the object frame by frame (which is what you've done). You can do these really well or really poorly, and it depends on the clip you use.  Here some examples of frame by frame manual tracking I've done: (1, 2, 3, 4)  After I started using After Effects, Motion tracking became a lot easier (obviously) and my upvote / downvote gifs got a lot cleaner.  After Effects can do tween animations very easily, it's as simple as selecting the object,  inserting keyframes and using the time-vary stop watch to change the position attribute over frames. So one frame 1 you have an object in a position, then turn on the time vary stop watch, go to frame 30, and move the object to the final position. If what you are moving is just simple text from left to right, it adds the sliding animation from point 1 frame 1 to point 2 frame 30. Example: http://i.imgur.com/SPqK2RP.gifv  Sorry for the long response time, I was at work"
seinfeldgifs,3dpnnh,imgurisblockd4me,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"Totally fine, I'm at work too lol. Yeah I was looking at getting the animation addon for gimp to see if that would make it easier. Going layer by later and copy, paste, move, merge takes a long ass time and I'm all about efficiency lol."

Naturally YouTube didn't like it, but I couldn't make Imgur take it unless it was shorter.  So I converted that small clip in VLC and hosted it on my server for Imgur to take.  I guess VLC didn't like it and it started getting choppy. Normally I'd make it in GIMP, but I'm liking this .gifv format and I've been trying to use it more, but it requires converting and hosting a smaller file somewhere, which ends up being the problem (mostly the conversion of the massive files that MakeMKV creates).  EDIT:  Just to clarify, I was hoping YouTube wouldn't care about me uploading it so long as I kept it set to Private.  I was incorrect."

seinfeldgifs,391fpq,ranhalt,7,Tue Jun 9 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"Finally, a question I have been waiting for.  (Before you read this, I realize now that the last line in this gif does not fade, which is a mistake.)  So I started experimenting with fade a while ago and liked it so much that I implemented it into my gifs by default. But the thing is, I work with my own standard, and it's hard to explain  Take these two gif as an example of my fading style: 1, 2    There are 3 things I look for when implementing fade into my gifs:    Silence (-20 Fade): When a character says anything, their mouths show the frame when they start the first word (First Text Frame), and finish the last word (Last Text Frame). If there are 4 extra frames after the Last Text Frame, I input a -20 fade. Meaning the text opacity goes from 100 -> 80 on frame 1, 80 -> 60 on frame 2, 60 -> 40 on frame 3, and 40 -> 20 on frame 4. Back to Back Lines that include a fade just means that the First Text Frame is right after the 4th Fade Frame. Camera Cut (No Fade): If the Last Text Frame is the frame right before a camera cut, I don't fade. The text will just stop abruptly so there will be no text after the camera cuts. In a lot of cases (the OP gif and gif #1) Back to Back lines are between a camera cut. Back to Back Lines (No Fade): Back to Back lines means that the Last Text Frame is right before the First Text Frame of the next line of dialogue. This happens if there is a clear break in how the sentence was spoken, or just to break up large segments of text (I do that quite often). I don't fade on Back to Back Lines, but I have seen it done using probably 2 frames to fade instead of my standard 4, but it looks ... unnecessary to me.   And that's how my fade works. Sorry that the posted gif is a little sloppy, that happens.  TL;DR: I do everything for a reason, and I make mistakes too  Edit: some changes"

seinfeldgifs,34byaq,SecretSantaClues,4,Thu Apr 30 05:20:43 2015 UTC,Everytime I watch Hulu it starts with a 2/3 ad commercial then continues to switch to 1 as the program plays. Then when the next episode comes it might be missing a few ads that would regularly be there if that was the episode I started my session with. I dunno the specifics but that's what it's always been like when I use it.

seinfeldgifs,34byaq,ive_lost_my_keys,5,Thu Apr 30 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"The biggest payday for them was during the final season of the show. With each of the three negotiating to get about $1 million an episode, which would be at the same level as Seinfeld himself. They originally tried negotiating for a share of back-end royalties, but Castle Rock Television, which produced the series for NBC, refused. So, they settled on taking the up-front salaries.  They would have surely made more if there was a season 10. The president of NBC at the time, Warren Littlefield, offered Jerry $5 million an episode, which would have netted him over $100 million. As we know he turned it down stating, ""I wanted to end the show on the same kind of peak we've been doing it on for years,"" Seinfeld said. ""I wanted the end to be from a point of strength. I wanted the end to be graceful.""   Warren Littlefield on Seinfeld's decision: He came to me and said, ‘I don’t have a life, I’m not married, I don’t have kids.’ We gave it everything we had, he was tempted, but in the end it was a quality of life decision.  Years later, Seinfeld and Larry David went to the other three co-stars and asked if they would participate in DVD commentary, behind-the-scenes, and extras for the DVD release. They refused until they were adequately compensated for the additional services.   Jason Alexander (George) recalls the events:    ""When the DVDs came up, we were being asked to provide new services,"" he said. ""We had no problem with the DVDs being released, but then they said, 'We want you to perform new services. We want to do interviews and create additional footage and additional material.' Why would we do that? They said, 'Because of the legacy of the show.'  ""Well, the character of George is not a millstone around my neck but I had to turn to my former bosses and say, 'I'm not invested in the longevity of the show. The longevity of the show actually is a detriment to me right now. It keeps me from getting certain kind of work. You have not made me a participant in the life of this show, therefore I am not inclined to give you these services.'  ""It took a while for them to understand. Frankly, I think they were well prepared to proceed without our services until the audience said, 'Don't do that.'   So after the DVD release was pushed, awaiting a resolution, a multimillion deal was reached for DVD royalities with three co-stars, allowing the release of an official DVD collection of the show's 180 episodes, plus newly filmed interviews and other material."
seinfeldgifs,34byaq,ive_lost_my_keys,2,Thu Apr 30 09:38:39 2015 UTC,"It's always really bothered me how the 3 of them were treated so ""poorly"" relatively speaking of course, when it comes to royalties. This show was just as much about them, maybe even more so, than it was about just Jerry."

seinfeldgifs,32g8nz,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"Counting-out game:       A counting-out game is a simple game intended to select a person to be ""it"", often for the purpose of playing another game. These games usually require no materials, and are played with spoken words or hand gestures.  Many such games involve one person pointing at each participant in a circle of players while reciting a rhyme. A new person is pointed at as each word is said. The player who is selected at the conclusion of the rhyme is ""it"" or ""out"". In an alternate version, the circle of players may each put two feet in and at the conclusion of the rhyme, that player removes one foot and the rhyme starts over with the next person. In this case, the first player that has both feet removed is ""it"" or ""out"". These are often accepted as random selections because the number of words has not been calculated beforehand, so the result is unknown right up until someone is selected.  A variant of counting-out game, known as Josephus problem, represents a famous theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science.

seinfeldgifs,32g8nz,Volfie,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:05:48 2015 UTC,"I donno about that. I just rewatched the scene and the pacing of the delivery sounds like ""Potato Man."" Not ""potato, man."" I could see Kramer saying ""potato, man"" but George says the same thing in the same way.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk8Q6MKnGfI  I slightly suspect this might have something to do with Potato Guy that lives across the hall from Elaine. Not that the game is named after that guy, but that it's a fabricated thing that the writers like. Like Kramer's weird allusions to Sweden."

seinfeldgifs,31g36m,bombaybicycleclub,3,Sun Apr 5 00:51:31 2015 UTC,What the fuck did Kramer do to get all his money?!?!
seinfeldgifs,31g36m,creepypriest,7,Sun Apr 5 07:23:52 2015 UTC,"From wiki:   In ""The Visa"", George comments, ""Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down $2,000 to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors, and have sex without dating. That's a fantasy camp."" This likely refers to Kramer's various strokes of financial luck over the course of the series, such as optioning his coffee table book about coffee tables to a major Hollywood studio in ""The Wizard"", winning $18,000 in ""The Subway"" successfully betting on horse races, and signing a contract with Calvin Klein in ""The Pick"". It may also indicate that Kramer came into money at an earlier, unseen time and is thus independently wealthy to some degree, explaining his not having to work."

seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,JPeterBane,12,Fri Mar 13 11:32:55 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you a question, what do you imagine are the political beliefs of the many Seinfeld characters?"
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,childsleaze,22,Fri Mar 13 14:40:59 2015 UTC,"I would put Jerry at apolitical all around. He just doesn't give a shit about anything.  Elaine is a middle-of-the-road feminist. She's non-religious;  pro-choice; pro-animal rights . . . but cares about money and the upper-class.  George is a penny-pinching Libertarian with a few right-wing tendencies, who isn't afraid to put on a ""tin foil hat"" once in a while.  Kramer is an unabashed Socialist who could even be persuaded to mingle with Communism from time-to-time. He wants equal rights, equal pay, and equal wackiness for all.  Edit: Elaine is totally cool with abortions."
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,Animorganimate,5,Fri Mar 13 19:34:06 2015 UTC,Well put! I agree with everything you said except Elaine being anti-abortion. She's absolutely pro-choice.
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,childsleaze,6,Sat Mar 14 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"That's my mistake all the way. I totally meant pro-abortion, but I must have been too excited to finally getting the opportunity to talk Seinfeld and politics."
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,Animorganimate,4,Sat Mar 14 04:04:25 2015 UTC,Apolitical all the way around.
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,innocentpleasures,2,Fri Mar 13 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"Elaine is a Republican, Jerry is a Democrat, Kramer is a Libertarian, and George has no idea because.....he's an idiot."
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,incarnatethegreat,20,Fri Mar 13 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say that Elaine is a democrat - remember the entire debacle with her and the moving guy?   ""I'm sure he's pro-abortion, right? HE'S JUST SO GOOD LOOKING"""
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,Baelix,7,Fri Mar 13 15:05:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's good to take a few steps back, look at the bigger picture, and establish that they're all idiots."
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,incarnatethegreat,3,Fri Mar 13 15:07:33 2015 UTC,Yes. Elaine is a women's rights Republican and she is angry because her political beliefs are at odds with her party's stance on women. It's what makes her slightly evil.
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,tricheboars,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:59:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Also, Elaine attends a lesbian wedding in the The Subway, as the best man. So it'd be hard to argue that she's not in support of the LGBTQ community. It's clear in multiple episodes that she cares about animal rights. I'd say she a Democrat."
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,childsleaze,13,Sat Mar 14 01:15:58 2015 UTC,I agree with this except Kramer. Kramer was in a union when he worked at the bagel shop and stood up for labor rights. I think Kramer might be a socialist personally.   And George might be a Republican. I have no evidence but he seems like he would be. However George sure does like his unemployment benefits!   I am super excited for this conversation to continue.
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,tricheboars,6,Fri Mar 13 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"Hahaha that's right! I forgot about ""takin' it to the streets!"" ""NO BAGEL NO BAGEL NO BAGEL NO BAGEL!""  George always complains about the system. However, if he's big on being unemployed and mooching off unemployment benefits, then perhaps he's less of a Republican."
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,incarnatethegreat,5,Fri Mar 13 14:55:23 2015 UTC,That makes George MORE of a Republican. Look at all the southern red States. Republican but takes more welfare than blue States.   Just imagine George doing his taxes.
seinfeldgifs,2ywf7v,tricheboars,-1,Fri Mar 13 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"I always figured government mooch money came from a Left-leaning political ideology. Well, up here in Canada it's like that."

seinfeldgifs,2yfsgx,dammitkarissa,3,Tue Mar 10 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna change my theory a little bit. I think as Rose was telling the story she too was remembering it. She even said it was something she hadn't thought about in a long time IIRC. I think as her story unraveled she realized there was never any closure. The point of not giving the stone away was so that she could let go of him. So that she could have that closure. Those memories, her story would become famous if the stone were discovered all those years later but they would no longer be 'hers.' She needed to let go, and that includes the stone as well."
