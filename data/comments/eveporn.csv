Like the prototypes or the Agressive Paintjobs of some ace frigate captain out in the boonies. I know it's not realistic to see any of this in the actual game, but for a game universe as large as eve, there are bound to be very specialized/one-off hulls. A Merlin outfitted with a novel sensor suite, or an outdated caracal retrofitted with a few oversized railguns for asteroid clearing. The luxury civilian Thorax of a famous artist, etc. Every in-game hull is identical in-game and I haven't seen any fan art tough on this at all. I'm mulling over ways to get raster renders and then work on them with AI/PS. I used to draw battleship profiles in MS paint and could produce something similar with my skillset today (Without the MS paint, I mean)."
