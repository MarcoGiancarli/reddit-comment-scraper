bluesguitarist,3ci614,bullyheart,5,Wed Jul 8 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"depends on the mood. my favorite is solo electric with a few pedals - some dirt, a delay, a tuner. Catfish Blues, Red House, I Can't Be Satisfied, songs where I can get a little heavier.  but then you have to play for the audience sometimes, and a couple of chords on an acoustic under the sound of the human voice is about as pure as it gets. im a little more folk-y than blues-y in my acoustic songs though  if i can get my hands on a dobro/resonator and play some old timey stuff, thats my favorite thing to do, even if my punk rock friends might think im crazy. and if someone says ""we're doing a song in G bring your harmonica"" i love that too"
bluesguitarist,3ci614,patton66,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:39:54 2015 UTC,"I like to do different renditions of pop songs because, most of the time, the songs I like aren't the ones the crowd wants to hear. But if you take something familiar and turn it into something you want to play, people latch on pretty well. An example, I did an open mic recently with a buddy where we just covered songs from the year 2000 (approximately) including hits from Brittany Spears, Nsync, and the Backstreet Boys. We adapted the songs to our musical preferences so they would be fun to play and everyone enjoyed it."

Anyway, I am glad Dr Blues aka /u/bluesnoodler_ decided to give room to finger pickers under their porch.  I was noodling and I came up with this. Let's say this might be the embryo of my first song. I even don't know if you could call that blues. Sorry for the out-of-tune sounds, I played this with my old beaten Slingerland Maybell and the intonation is so aweful past the 5th fret. I tried to correct it with a little bend but hey! the action is aweful too. Nevertheless, I love the tone of this guitar.  Summer is here in France, and I played this outside. A little companion came here by chance and joined the session, you can hear him (or her) playing with me if that makes sense.  Cheers folks!"

I have been composing many little tunes like this lately. Everytime I pick up the guitar to practice, some embryos are showing up, strange. I consider focusing on composing this summer. It makes me feel better, feel good. I also started singing but I am on the early stages, I'll might post something this summer though.   The only problem is this guitar. Man, I love the sound but it is painful to play and I cannot afford a Gibson or a Martin.   Anyway, thank you for this sub man! I already told you many times but without this sub I wouldn't have come this far even if it is not that far away. It's crazy how all the posts makes me improve.

I've been lucky enough to track down 3 Jensen C12n speakers from the late 60s at very reasonable prices, and they sound awesome. The biggest things to consider:   Make sure the speaker is the right diameter and resistance for your setup. Bring a multimeter and measure the resistance yourself, to make sure it's correct and that the speaker isn't blown. I made this mistake once. Find out whether the speaker has original cones. It's not an issue if they have been reconed, they will just need to break in to get that classic vintage sound. You also don't want to pay all-original prices for a reconed speaker.   You will be amazed how much changing the speakers affects your tone.  Edit: one other thing - check the date code on the speaker frame to make sure you're getting what's advertised."

bluesguitarist,3bn5z0,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed Jul 1 01:21:44 2015 UTC,Check out these top string voicings (this is E7 harmonized):  --4---5---7---9--11---12---14---16----- --3---5---7---8--10---12---13---15----- --4---6---8---9--11---13---14---16----- --2---4---6---7---9---11---13---14----- --X------------------------------------- --X-------------------------------------   So you get E7-F#m7-G#m7-A7-B7-C#m7-F#dim-E7. Throw these stabs in on some upbeats or between riffs.
bluesguitarist,3bn5z0,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed Jul 1 04:43:21 2015 UTC,I just spent about 2 hours listening to t-bone walker for the first time; I think I found the source of some of these chord runs !
bluesguitarist,3bn5z0,RaskolNick,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:56:51 2015 UTC,My favorite chord is the T Bone 9th chord:  https://youtu.be/m_RGBlxNGt8

bluesguitarist,3bkdsr,goldbot,3,Mon Jun 29 22:57:23 2015 UTC,"I've learned a lot in the past few weeks since finding this sub. I've been trying out the last few jams and I think my playing has greatly improved from recording myself and then going back and listening and trying to improve it.   On this track, I think I got lost somewhere between the major and minor pentatonics but feel like it still came out OK. I am working on improving the rhythmic aspects of my playing - when I improvise or come up with a line, I tend to stick to straight quarter or eighth notes and it comes out so bland. So I've been going back and replaying my licks with more interesting rhythmic lines.  Any tips or criticism welcome I guess."
bluesguitarist,3bkdsr,clockjuice,3,Mon Jun 29 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty good! The phrasing was nice and varied and you seem to play with the changes alright. As for mixing minor and major, you can always do this but major sounds especially good over  the IV chord and the V chord"
bluesguitarist,3bkdsr,bluesnoodler_,2,Tue Jun 30 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"No worries about mixing major and minor pentatonic -- you can do so freely over most blues.  If you find your licks are tired, you can breathe new life into them by doing stuff like bending into a note instead of playing it straight, sliding into a note, rephrasing it, etc. I dig your uncluttered style -- just keep playin' and using your ears!"
bluesguitarist,3bkdsr,danihendrix,2,Tue Jun 30 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"Great job man :D I could tell you were concentrating, being cautious at the beginning, but what a great foundation :) I agree with noodler, a few more techniques thrown in will do ya good. Blues loves bends :P what's your setup? Nice and clean anyway, look forward to the next one!"

bluesguitarist,3beo53,zoidbergular,4,Sun Jun 28 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"Had a much-needed vacation last week.. Played a lot of disc golf, saw RUSH in Boston, enjoyed a nice birthday with my girlfriend, and went to upstate Vermont to watch my sister get married. While fun, it unfortunately wasn't all that relaxing, and now it's back to work tomorrow....  Here's a recipe for mussels that I made last week:   1.5lb live mussels 1 shallot, diced small 2-3 cloves garlic, sliced thin 1  tomato, diced small 1/4c white wine (I used a chardonnay) 1/2c chicken stock Red pepper flakes, to your liking 1T butter 2T chopped parsley, for garnish Toasted crusty bread   Rinse mussels thoroughly in cold water, discarding any that don't close when you gently push on the shell (this means they're dead). Heat butter over medium-high heat, in a large stock pot or sauté pan. Soften shallots and garlic in the butter, then reduce heat to medium and add the mussels. Add the chicken broth, wine, and red pepper flakes. Cover the pan and steam for ~5min, until all the mussels open. Add the tomato, toss gently, and steam for an additional 1min. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately, with toasted crusty bread for sopping up the broth."
bluesguitarist,3beo53,tnecniv,3,Sun Jun 28 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds idyllic! dig the recipe -- sounds a lot like how they were served in a place I used to work. The cook would give me a saucepan with a whack of mussels and sauce, and I'd load 'em onto buttered rye and wolf out."
bluesguitarist,3beo53,TheBali,3,Sun Jun 28 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"RUSH in Boston   I am jealous! I saw them on the Clockwork Angels tour in Philadelphia, and they were fantastic! I wanted to see them again this time, but didn't want to play the ticket lottery."
bluesguitarist,3beo53,zoidbergular,2,Mon Jun 29 03:39:28 2015 UTC,I learned they were playing in Montreal the day before the show :( Obviously there were only bad/overpriced tickets remaining.
bluesguitarist,3beo53,tallpapab,2,Mon Jun 29 11:25:46 2015 UTC,"I saw them on Clockwork, and on the Time Machine tour as well! Time Machine was awesome and loaded with hits. Clockwork was good as well, bit they played a ton of deep tracks from the 70s and such that I didn't really recognize. This R40 tour is somewhere in between. The music is always spot on, though!"
bluesguitarist,3beo53,Splin7ers,3,Mon Jun 29 12:39:23 2015 UTC,Watching BattleBots on ABC tonight because my son's friend is on one of the teams.
bluesguitarist,3beo53,Splin7ers,3,Sun Jun 28 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"Confession time. I've never liked SRV until today when I listened to Dirty Pool on the radio as I was driving home under the sun. I stopped the car on the highway side, opened the trunk, fetched my records box and found Texas Flood. I got the magic now."
bluesguitarist,3beo53,Splin7ers,3,Sun Jun 28 19:50:57 2015 UTC,"The first time I heard SRV was the first time I saw him live.  Went to see Steppenwolf with some friends. Not a massive fan but what the fuck. There was no mention of an opening band on the tickets or anything.  Then this dude in a black hat and a Strat shows up on stage and proceeds to rip everyone's face off -- playing it behind his head, with his teeth, behind his back, riding it like a horse. Just flattened the place. When the smoke cleared, people were just standing around gape jawed. About a week later Texas Flood came out.   In a lot of ways the 80s were a grim time for music, so SRV was a lifeline for a kid like me, 'cause the blues were just about the most uncool thing a high school kid could be into at the time. Suddenly there was a renaissance, and it was SRV who crossed over and made it happen. There is a great video of a show at a bar in my hometown that was broadcast on local TV at the start of his career - Live at the El Mocambo. Check that out to get a taste of how powerful he was live."
bluesguitarist,3beo53,Splin7ers,2,Sun Jun 28 22:32:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for putting that in context. It's very interesting. I'll go check the Mocambo live show for sure.
bluesguitarist,3beo53,Splin7ers,2,Mon Jun 29 06:00:54 2015 UTC,"When I first listened to him about ten years ago, I was into the punk stuff and thought he's only the Steve Vai of the blues. I didn't realised there were much more to it. As you know my definitive love for the blues has been thriving since three months and I wonder every day where I have been all this time. I discover new records everyday that are old for y'all. I think it is also part of practicing the blues. Yesterday man, when I was driving home and re-listened to SRV I almost felt like a schoolgirl. Learning Pride and Joy is my next step by the way."
bluesguitarist,3beo53,Splin7ers,2,Mon Jun 29 06:08:10 2015 UTC,The hardest part to nail is that Texas shuffle in the intro. Otherwise the rhythm is a lot of upstrokes on the upbeats during the verses. Kinda the same thing you'd do to play ska actually.  A lot of the punks I knew back in the day transitioned into rockabilly/psychobilly stuff like the Cramps or Horton Heat.  Ever hear the Gun Club? Punk Blues pioneers: https://youtu.be/qtPKy3Yau7c
bluesguitarist,3beo53,tnecniv,2,Mon Jun 29 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"Hey Noodler, yeah!, of course, Gun Club was a big influence for me. Actually I realised that there were already some blues in the stuff I used to listen like Gun Club, Birthday Party and early Nick Cave's albums, PJ Harvey...strangely I never was into this rockabilly/psychobilly shit, the Cramps were good though."
bluesguitarist,3beo53,danihendrix,2,Mon Jun 29 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"Nick Cave is awesome. Dig his version of Stagger Lee. The Cramps were a total gas - great live show.   Check out Stevie's brother Jimmie too -- much more traditional. Less guitar hero, more old school cool."

bluesguitarist,3b7f6t,circleof5surecanjive,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:01:53 2015 UTC,Another really useful version that's easy to fret skips the low 5th in the first pattern. I've been picking up stuff from Joe Pass and he uses that variation a lot and adds 'colour tones' to it on the e and b strings. Only really works finger picking though.

bluesguitarist,3atx59,MpegEVIL,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"I did too. It was a small venue. He played two solid hours and was terrific. At the end he had a little reception line where he was selling his CD's. I bought one and traded a guitar pick with him.   The thing is, though, that I don't think he was too keen on trading the pick, but did so anyway—something that I find a bit entertaining. He said something about running low on those picks (while on tour, I presume). He's coming back around my area, so if I go see him again I'll have to pick up a whole package of his picks and make a little present to him :-)"
bluesguitarist,3atx59,mariox19,2,Tue Jun 30 20:34:29 2015 UTC,Pretty good example of showing restraint. Kind of easy to want to hustle through slower parts or jazz them up way too much. Just because it's slow doesn't mean it's easy.

bluesguitarist,3atocw,Ferrocile,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been getting into this type of style lately.  How did you develop/learn it?  I really like how you can get some creamy tones from using your hand vs a pick.  Your improv is worlds above my own, but I have seen some good videos on developing it.  You can play a single chord and have one target note in mind where you begin your run.  You then try different two-three note combinations every time.  It can really help you break out of your own habits.  That having been said, really nice playing."

bluesguitarist,3arxrl,tallpapab,3,Tue Jun 23 00:55:45 2015 UTC,It's hard not to get a little repetitive if you don't have vocals or another instrument. One major criticism is that you need to post more of your awesome stuff.
bluesguitarist,3arxrl,forchita,3,Tue Jun 23 01:43:26 2015 UTC,"That's some good work. You let it breathe, you make use of the chords change to build tension... My only criticism (excuse my self-educated guitarist language) is that sometimes you play too much on the beat. So the phrase gets too long and your bends are too predictable."
bluesguitarist,3arxrl,BillFuckingEvans,2,Tue Jun 23 02:40:31 2015 UTC,"Damn sweet tone and clean playing throughout. No criticism here. If it helps, one thing I like to do if I think i'm being repetitive, is to try and pick a new ""theme"" every time there's a turnaround. Play in a specific position, or explore a particular rhythm etc. I find it adds a little more structure, especially on longer tracks. Jimi does it well on his cover. I thought this was great though!!"

bluesguitarist,3als6b,Mikethrillmas,5,Sun Jun 21 20:00:40 2015 UTC,A bit of Lipton onion soup mix and a drop of teriyaki sauce added to raw ground beef makes the perfect burger.   I haven't played guitar or cooked anything good in over a week. I feel like a fraud.
bluesguitarist,3als6b,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:32:04 2015 UTC,How's the new gig?
bluesguitarist,3als6b,Mikethrillmas,2,Sun Jun 21 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty good so far even though it isn't my full time job yet.  While I'm grateful to be busy at all, I'm shooting for a ten year plan that ends in me somehow with a guitar shop of my own. A few years ago I worked in a little shop that had a bit of everything that really specialized in boutique effect pedals and I think I'll be chasing the dragon of how good that felt for the duration of my life. That or a 7-11ish store. In a perfect world I would have my 9-5, lock the doors and go upstairs and just party.   The deal around here is that until you have become a lifer at Boeing or Microsoft you haven't really made it yet. I know business owners never really do an eight hour day and call it quits, but it's something I would do if money wasn't an issue."
bluesguitarist,3als6b,chefjl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:06:41 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good plan. I am a leaf at the mercy of the wind.
bluesguitarist,3als6b,Splin7ers,2,Mon Jun 22 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"You're on the gravy list when I win this lotto scam I keep buying into. We are due for a blues revival any minute now, at which point Canada will finally be your personal estate."
bluesguitarist,3als6b,Splin7ers,2,Mon Jun 22 20:42:32 2015 UTC,B.C. bud for everyone.
bluesguitarist,3als6b,Splin7ers,3,Tue Jun 23 23:04:32 2015 UTC,"Here's an easy recipe for ya, and much like the pentatonic scale, it melds with a variety of dishes.    All'amatriciana Sauce:    4 pieces of bacon, chopped. 1 medium onion, diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes 8 Tablespoons olive oil 28 Oz can of crushed tomatoes 2 Oz grated parmesan    Bacon, onions, pepper flakes and a couple tablespoons of olive oil into the pot on medium heat.  Your bacon will slowly begin to brown, your onions will get soft and translucent, and the pepper flakes will release their capsaicin into the oil.  Roughly 10 minutes.  Next, add everything else, bring to a nice bubble, then put on a lid, turn it to low, and let it simmer for 15 minutes.  That's it.    Classically, this is served over bucatini pasta, but it's great on pretty much any noodle.  Want it for breakfast?  Add a 1/2"" layer of sauce to an 8"" skillet, crack in 4 eggs, top with parmesan, and put in a 400F oven for 10 minutes.   Baked eggs all'amatriciana!   How about a nice Mediterranean take on a cheap piece of fish?  Sure!  Chop up 1/4 cup of green olives and a half teaspoon of capers, mix it with a cup of all'amatriciana sauce, put the sauce in a skillet, put 4 tilapia fillets on the sauce, add a lid and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, until the fish is tender and white, then flip so the sauce is on top, and serve."
bluesguitarist,3als6b,pasher71,2,Sun Jun 21 14:47:32 2015 UTC,Damn that was mouthwatering just to read! Gonna try this
bluesguitarist,3als6b,worskies,3,Sun Jun 21 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"My best friend gave me one of this guitar as a gift. We met twice a year since he has moved far away from our place. Last time we met, I was still into punk and hardcore music. When he saw how I play the blues after three months of daily practice he gave me his ten years old CIJ Fender Mustang. This axe was his go to guitar. Tried to refrain him several times but no way, he really wanted to give this one to me. I am still confused and very happy at the same time.   Happy Father's Day r/bluesguitarist!"
bluesguitarist,3als6b,worskies,2,Sun Jun 21 21:38:32 2015 UTC,Mustang? Nice! Has the short scale so slinkier strings - easier to bend! It sounds like you have a very good friend. Keep them close.
bluesguitarist,3als6b,newaccount,2,Mon Jun 22 01:19:23 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right! I assume friends like him are rare.   The guitar is awesome and strange somehow. I'm not used to this shorter scale, I can see the potential though. It is way easier to bend exactly. There are a lot of sounds combinations. So far, I am verry happy with the stock pups, they sound fantastic for my fingerpicking droning hill country shit, which is surprising for a Japanese Fender."
bluesguitarist,3ak30l,tallpapab,3,Sat Jun 20 23:44:34 2015 UTC,Some really nice choices in there. Yes that harp sound like someone's ringing in over an old phone - a little disctracting! Otherwise nice choices which matched your laid back vocals.
bluesguitarist,3ak30l,dummyguava,2,Sun Jun 21 08:53:12 2015 UTC,"Not all that happy with this one. There's that awful clipping harmonica in the backing track (or did I somehow screw up the backing track?) Anyway, here it is such as it is."
bluesguitarist,3ak30l,bluesnoodler_,2,Sat Jun 20 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"I dig it! Yes, I battled with that annoying harp in the back track too -- I tried to soften it via EQ a bit. You have a great voice and them sweet phrases -- dug the turnaround stuff in the last couple of choruses!"

bluesguitarist,3afme4,tallpapab,2,Fri Jun 19 22:01:52 2015 UTC,Honored.
bluesguitarist,3afme4,ddshroom,2,Fri Jun 19 22:28:03 2015 UTC,"That 'Old School Blues' channel gets close but I feel like It never really nails it (in general, not that lesson in particular). The guy just doesn't have the deep pocket of the people he tries to teach or emulate.  Your mileage may vary. I should put my money where my mouth is and do some lessons. Although i've found the best teacher to be ones ears and a good record player  that lesson on Lookin' Good is a great one though. I love that tune. Not exactly how Sam did it but close enough and good feel."
bluesguitarist,3afme4,wellywoodfats,2,Sat Jun 20 13:09:49 2015 UTC,"I should put my money where my mouth is and do some lessons.   Yes! part of the impetus here is to promote people who take the time and effort to create and share learning materials, like Old School Blues guy here. There are very few people teaching what he teaches (believe me, I have looked around). If the cat could nail everyone's playing that he's teaching, he would likely be too busy! I look at it like the teacher is giving you the recipe -- it's up to you to cook it!"
bluesguitarist,3afme4,bluesnoodler_,2,Sat Jun 20 13:58:46 2015 UTC,"what are some good lesson topics, I think the stuff I'm working on might be a bit too specific for most people. I could just do some tips and tricks from a working player, things I've found that work well in a blues context, I would like to maybe do some on rhythm playing. Sadly it seems to be a massively under-developed part of many budding young players. Rhythm playing is 90% of what you do on gigs. And good rhythm playing informs good lead playing hugely"
bluesguitarist,3afme4,wellywoodfats,2,Sun Jun 21 09:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, rhythm playing is an excellent and under taught topic! I'll betcha you've got a ton of stuff up your sleeve that folks would find useful. Nobody ever talks about how to back a harp player, how to set up the backline with various axes, etc. How many cats set up their amp so the bottom 3 strings sound like ass?   I like Kid Andersen's Stuff People Play Wrong vids. We need more of that out there.  I have heard you man -- I know you have a lot of knowledge to share!"
bluesguitarist,3afme4,bluesnoodler_,2,Sun Jun 21 12:56:52 2015 UTC,"I loooooove backing up harp players. That would be a fun one to do. Quite a big topic though. Bit sized chunks would be good. things like  when to use a capo, knowing what rhythm style to use, having an arsenal of chord voicings, using partial voicings, horn line parts, fills, the most criminally butchered shuffle pattern ever (the E or A cliche guitar line, making it sound good).  I'm out of town for a few gigs but when I get back I'll make a list and plan some lessons."
bluesguitarist,3afme4,wellywoodfats,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds good man. There is a lot of information online, but not much wisdom as far as the role of being a blues guitar player in a band context."

I do really dig it when you do your own thing, but it is also nice to hear that facet of your playing as well. Been a real joy hearing you in these  jams! I look forward to it. Thanks!"

bluesguitarist,3a5rc3,dummyguava,2,Wed Jun 17 13:15:03 2015 UTC,Mmm nice.  I love slide guitar.  Wish I could play some. Some great licks there and the sound was great too.  Especially in the lower register.  Was it really from that cigar box guitar in the picture?
bluesguitarist,3a5rc3,johnkdevnull,2,Wed Jun 17 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Ha no! The picture was my first build - I've built a few - so I have a soft spot for it, even though it sounded shit! This jam was played lap style on my little parlor acoustic. Thanks for the track, it was a lot of fun!"
bluesguitarist,3a5rc3,johnkdevnull,2,Thu Jun 18 02:06:32 2015 UTC,Cool.  I know you can get great sounds from them.  I heard one guy in a forum post clips of his and with a little distortion it sounded absolutely awesome.  His had a long hex bolt and nut as a bridge!

bluesguitarist,3a4euk,BillFuckingEvans,4,Wed Jun 17 03:38:29 2015 UTC,"I gave a quick listen. Your playing sounds good, but the tone sounds tinny. I'm on my laptop so take that with a grain of salt."
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,bullyheart,4,Wed Jun 17 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested to hear what this sounds like through the neck pickup, with the crunch dialed back a little."
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,zoidbergular,3,Wed Jun 17 12:13:57 2015 UTC,"second this, Albert King did a more natural drive kind of sound, just a little bit of break up. He also used a phaser so be sure to check that out. Sweet licks though."
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,jealous_panda,3,Wed Jun 17 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"Too much gain eh? I just started messing around with distortion, thanks for the tip."
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,jealous_panda,3,Wed Jun 17 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"Took some of your much appreciated toan advice. Here's take 2 on the neck pickup, with less gain, some reverb, and I tried to get the albert king phaser sound without making it too spacey."
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,bluesnoodler_,3,Wed Jun 17 20:13:50 2015 UTC,That sounds good man! Very jealous of some of those licks. Definitely gonna throw a phaser in my rig tomorrow and play with it.
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,MikeFromBC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:02:09 2015 UTC,Hell yes! Sounds fantastic!
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,zoidbergular,3,Thu Jun 18 14:57:29 2015 UTC,I'm a total guitar noob. One year in self taught; so don't take my opinion seriously. But it seems to me like you went all in right at the start. I think you should build up to it with lower register notes before getting into the high ones.  Listen to John: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYLyXmAiIb0  Good playing though.
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,ColumbusII,3,Wed Jun 17 06:10:56 2015 UTC,"I think that where this is such a short track that start with a pretty big hit from the horns, it makes sense to lead off aggressively. To me, it would sound kind of awkward to force John's slow-buildup-approach into this song. That approach definitely has its places, but I don't think this track is one of them.  Also keep in mind that most of Albert's fills and solos are on the treble strings, and it sounds like OP intended to mimic his style."
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,carmour,2,Wed Jun 17 12:23:24 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with a lot of stuff that John says, even his greatest hero tends to do the exact opposite.  I think it's a matter of preference and style."
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,johnkdevnull,2,Wed Jun 17 09:00:10 2015 UTC,"John's advice is good, but it's only one approach. If you are going for a longer solo then sure, stretching things out and building it up is a good way to go.   Think about it though. If you do it this way EVERY time, what's the point. You gotta learn to mix it up. In saying that, the way John explains it is a tried and true method for building a solo. It's just one of em"
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,johnkdevnull,3,Wed Jun 17 10:59:29 2015 UTC,Great playing.  Loved the guitar tone too.  The only thing I could comment on critically is that there is some buzz in the recording.  You can hear it at the outset and at the end.
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,johnkdevnull,2,Wed Jun 17 07:54:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! Ya I noticed the buzz too but I didn't know what to do about it. I think I overdid the distortion so that might have made it worse.
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,carmour,2,Wed Jun 17 15:07:05 2015 UTC,It could be as simple as single coils too close to a computer monitor.  How are you recording it?
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,carmour,2,Wed Jun 17 15:10:01 2015 UTC,I'm going through a multi-effects pedal and then I just have an adapter that lets me plug into the headphone jack of my computer. One of my cables has known better days as well so I think I might start with that.
bluesguitarist,3a4euk,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed Jun 17 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"If you mean your Line-In (rather than the headphone jack :D ) then yeah that can be noisy, at least mine is.  You might be better with some kind of USB Sound interface to go in through.  In my case, I recently tried recording my Pod XT live through the output to my line-in and that buzzed just like this.  So I use the USB interface to record through which is virtually silent."

bluesguitarist,39zo1r,newaccount,3,Tue Jun 16 13:10:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was in a really bad way. I think the cause of death was an OD of prescription pills, with no way of knowing whether it was intentional. He was the Hendrix of the harp.

bluesguitarist,39ztu0,johnkdevnull,3,Tue Jun 16 03:08:05 2015 UTC,Nothing to criticise.  This was a load of fun all the way.  Nicely paced throughout.

bluesguitarist,39ysit,Splin7ers,3,Tue Jun 16 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"I posted this version because her left hand is shown well. This sub is about learning, after all. I also think she's good.  This comes from reading Amanda Petruxich's Do Not Sell at Any Price where she writes about this song.  Here's Geeshie Wiley's recording.  And here's another beautiful, professional, modern recording  A beautiful, haunting song."
bluesguitarist,39ysit,dummyguava,2,Mon Jun 15 22:04:22 2015 UTC,"I've just been learning this, and studying all three of the videos! I don't have any problems playing the licks/chords but the timing structure was very difficult to get a handle on. What ended up with is 4 bars of 4/4, one of 2/4, 3 of 4/4, 1 of 2/4, 2 of 4/4. I found the chocolate drops version the easiest to follow.  EDIT: Reading this back I realised that you can easily fit it into 10 bars of 4/4, and probably would make it easier. For me it feels like what I've written above. FWIW.  P.S. Well worth checking out the rest of ""IPlayBanjosNow"" videos. I love her cover of  ""I'll go with her blues""."
bluesguitarist,39ysit,bluesnoodler_,2,Tue Jun 16 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"That's awesome that you're giving it a go. I think you're further along than I am. Great tune! I'll check out IPlayBanjosNow's other videos on your recommendation.  EDIT: Those old blues players didn't stick to strict forms (as you probably already know). The whole 12 bar thing is relatively recent, I believe. Robert Johnson switches between 4/4 and 6/4 on Dust My Broom."

bluesguitarist,39to0x,tallpapab,3,Sun Jun 14 17:50:34 2015 UTC,You're doing great! You might benefit from simplifying a bit. Try leaving a few gaps and pay attention to timing. Keep up the good work.

bluesguitarist,39sv84,bluesnoodler_,6,Sun Jun 14 13:03:33 2015 UTC,"I am fuckiin' stoked about a new guitar I am picking up this week! I was a Strat man my whole life, but I found a couple years ago now that I had played my trusty MiM into the dirt -- fretted out beyond hope, krufted bridge, etc. Had I not been presented with a late friend's Gibson ES-333, the only (electric) axe I would have is my Chibson!  Now I love the Gibson, and it has deep sentimental value and is the nicest axe I have ever owned, but I have been going through serious Strat withdrawal of late. Everything on my Soundcloud was played on the Gibson (or the Chibson), so I have been Stratless that long! I still have trouble with the dainty touch required to play the shorter scale guitars -- I can't really dig in like I can on a Strat.  Anyhow, dropped by a client's pawn shop (I build web sites) on Friday and on a whim I asked if he had any Strats. Was told that I was right on time, 'cause a guy had just brought one back to trade it for some other piece of gear.   So he hands me the guitar - a sea foam green partscaster with a glorious tiger stripe Allparts neck with a satin finish and SD pups -- and because we're pals, it's $300! The neck alone would have cost around $250.   Picking it up tomorrow and I'm as giddy as a fuckin' schoolgirl."

bluesguitarist,39sv84,tallpapab,2,Mon Jun 15 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"Woohoo! New guitar!  Sounds like a sweet deal.  Pics or it didn't happen :D  I made a bit of a mistake when I bought a Strat of getting an HSS one.  So I don't get the really classic Strat sounds like the bridge single coil and the quack positions.  I still like it, but I'm missing out on some of the main reasons for having a Strat in the first place.  I'll rectify that some day but I'll have to rationalise the guitar collection first.  Looking forward to hearing yours."
bluesguitarist,39sv84,tallpapab,2,Sun Jun 14 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah my old MiM was SSH as well. I was playing in rock bands and stuff at the time, so it seemed like a good compromise. This one has a hotcoolrail in the bridge, so I can wire it to split or drop another single in."

I don't think these pups are popular. They are made by a guy working in Paris, he's famous in France.   I don't know how pups are made but he says he only works by hand and relics his pups for a few days. He'll made something closer to Jeff Buckley's sound in his live in Sin-é. That's what I asked for. I hope these will suit my blues but anyway I have my Baja that I love a lot for blues."

I mean it, last time I didn't know until I got the mic cables that my headphone adapter was shot. This will be my first decent set of stereo headphones to go with my decent recording setup.  Got a job starting sometime in the next five days doing legal cannabis caretaking. My hope is it allows me to work two days at the local 7-11 and breeze through the rest of the week, meaning I'm comfortable indoors while earning a living that isn't just squeaking by. This is the best news ever really, as I have been considering going back to school or  intense construction work  like drywall and fiberglass installation or maybe flooring. Fuck that, I'll be paying physical tolls for that forever probably.  Damn good week. Feels good to think about something other than stress."

bluesguitarist,39siaa,dummyguava,3,Sun Jun 14 09:34:43 2015 UTC,Nice. I like how you can hear the chords in the solo - i.e. if you took the backing track away I could still tell what chords you are playing over.
bluesguitarist,39siaa,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:53:16 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I've kind of got into the habit recently of playing these chord based lines.  One day I have to learn what they are called ;-)

bluesguitarist,39luy8,joeribraams,2,Fri Jun 12 20:32:31 2015 UTC,So can we do that without a permit?
bluesguitarist,39luy8,joeribraams,2,Fri Jun 12 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, you don't need a permit, although I guess the rules would be the same as those for buskers, no amplification, no drums, not between 11 and 9, stuff like that. Although it's in a park, so I guess it won't be a big deal anyways."
bluesguitarist,39luy8,bluesnoodler_,2,Fri Jun 12 23:01:04 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. I am looking forward. Do you play?

bluesguitarist,39k0fg,bluesnoodler_,3,Fri Jun 12 07:10:25 2015 UTC,I think that as long as you didn't hire session musicians to play it for you then that's fine.  :D    Wonderful results in any case.  Certainly no uninteresting bits there.

bluesguitarist,39jq9k,tallpapab,4,Fri Jun 12 05:18:15 2015 UTC,"Open E. - E B E G# B E  He's jumping the bass between two E's, so the D string becomes an E. That opening riff at 12 seconds uses the open B hammer to maj 6th open E riff that I'm addicted to:   e|-----0---------------0--------------0---0----0-----------0  b|-0h2-------------0h2-------------0h2--2----------2---0--- g#|  d|---------0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0  b|  e|-----0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0----   Or something pretty close, not 100% on the middle note of the triplet after the 3rd hammeron. Every note except that one and the second part of the hammeron are played on the beat.  If you strum an E chord in standard it's sounds the same as the strum he does just before the opening, so it's very likely the G is a G# and the A is a B, but he doesn't play them that often, so might not be but I'd be very surprised if it isn't - its such a major sounding background to the slide.  Great song, dude really, really owns it."
bluesguitarist,39jq9k,newaccount,3,Fri Jun 12 12:21:51 2015 UTC,Excellent! Thanks! Now that I look at the beginning it's obvious. He strums all the open strings and it's an E chord.

I've owned one for a decade, and use it once a year. 10 minutes a day is all I need to do to get better, smh.  Tthe song really gets two sounds going. The major 'rhythm' or background sound from the tuning and the use of the 6th in the intro, then the slide itself is all in E minor. That's why it's such an effective sound, the slide cuts through the mix, and when it goes out you really notice how separate it is. Smart playing, not to mention very skilful."

bluesguitarist,39jq9k,newaccount,2,Fri Jun 12 13:07:49 2015 UTC,"Nice, yep definitely open E. Thought maybe Open D by looking at positions/fingers but playing an e string confirmed Open E."

bluesguitarist,39gj6f,bluesnoodler_,5,Thu Jun 11 15:54:44 2015 UTC,Good question! I'd say that mainting order will be better but I myself noticed a month ago that the reddit search engine is not really efficient. That's why I refrained from posting to avoid potential redundancy. It's a pity I didn't note down what happened that day when I browsed the sub and found a video with keywords that didn't fit. Just my 2c.
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,Splin7ers,2,Thu Jun 11 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for weighing in! I know that the reddit search function isn't ideal, but I guess I would prefer order to chaos, as I feel like I might as well redirect the sub to Google if I don't maintain the integrity of the content. Still, I would imagine that very few people use the sub the way I envision it anyhow, so why bother? It's a quandary."
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,Splin7ers,2,Thu Jun 11 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"You welcome! It's a dilemma you're right. I'll choose order over chaos. Blues somehow is related to order. I've been experiencing that since I'm learning the blues, you know, time, rhythm, progressions, scales so on and so forth. It also changed my lifestyle to some extant. Order definitely."
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,Splin7ers,2,Thu Jun 11 17:59:19 2015 UTC,"I think I am leaning toward striving for order, only with a less hands on style, like if it was posted before, but a year ago and nobody saw it, then okay. A compromise position"
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,newaccount,2,Thu Jun 11 18:07:31 2015 UTC,The compromise thing sounds great.
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,Splin7ers,3,Thu Jun 11 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"As much as I like everything to be neat and tidy, you have to face reality:  Trying to maintain order is going to take more and more of your time, and you are going to start to hate modding the sub more and more. It's organic, it's going to grow and people are going to come in and out. People will post things they don't realise have been posted before, there's no magical cure to stop that happening.  You'll be fighting a losing war and one that gets more draining every month. I'd just let it go - within reason. If something gets posted again that was from a few weeks or a month back, let the guy know. If not, just go with the flow.  The other thing is that a lesson you posted with 500 subscribers is going to get a different reaction to the same lesson with 3500+ subscribers. This place will well over 5K, maybe even 10, by Christmas. Letting it go will not only have the potential for a lesson to be seen by that many more people; it'll also start a discussion with that many more people.  And congrats on the success, BTW. I was a lurker here for a long time and really appreciated your efforts. Great to see how many people have been just as inspired as me by what you've built!"
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,Splin7ers,2,Thu Jun 11 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I see your point -- I already don't enjoy bothering anyone about making sure stuff hasn't been posted before, and I know that likely nobody actually searches for ""slide"" or ""comping"" or whatever the way I pictured it anyhow. If I have to do that more often you are correct that I will find it sucking the joy out of modding the place. It is pretty cool how things have grown, so I am going to try and be less hands on and enjoy watching shit happen."
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,dummyguava,2,Thu Jun 11 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, /u/newaccount is right. I agree with him actually. I personnaly searched the sub every single day with keywords. I started with ""12 bar"", ""progression"", ""beginner"", ""licks"" and stuff like that.   If you think that people in general don't search the sub, would it be possible to create categories in the right side with ""slide"", ""comping"", ""fingerpicking"" etc? I'm just asking, I have no experience as a mod."
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,danihendrix,2,Thu Jun 11 18:55:05 2015 UTC,That is a good idea. I am glad to hear that you do search the sub! I appreciate the feedback!

bluesguitarist,39gj6f,tallpapab,3,Sun Jun 14 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"We should allow memes, they'll fix everything. We can have the largest blues meme collection on the Internet :p  But seriously I would stop it if you see right in front of you that it's been posted before but if I wouldn't put a lot of time into it. You created a great community and at the rate it's growing it will become difficult to keep up with. I echo what /u/newaccount says above."
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,tallpapab,2,Thu Jun 11 21:15:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting conundrum. As a little test I copied the target URL of a recent post into the search box. Then I hit the search icon (magnifying glass) and it did not find the post. Does search only search in the titles? (No. ""slide"" was not in some of the titles.) Searching for ""slide"" certainly brings up a great collection of resources on slide, but it's large (60 submissions on 3 pages). A new submitter would have to go through them all to figure out if their candidate had already been posted. So, this might have a discouraging effect. On the other hand that ""slide"" search might stretch to a fourth (unhelpful) page if duplicates are allowed.  Is there a way to make a comment ""sticky"" so that it stays as the first comment to a post? If so a sticky comment pointing to the original post might help."
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,bagofboards,2,Thu Jun 11 20:11:32 2015 UTC,"No. I tried again with the full URL and found it, complete with some sort of warning that it had already been submitted."
bluesguitarist,39gj6f,bagofboards,2,Thu Jun 11 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"OK. This time I tried submitting it as something new (with a different title). I got the warning about it already having been submitted. So, what's the problem here? Have peeps been clicking the ""submit anyway"" link?"

bluesguitarist,39048f,ColumbusII,2,Mon Jun 8 07:28:13 2015 UTC,"A bit of both; sometimes the groove comes naturally, other times I literally write it down noting what hits on the beat and what doesn't."
bluesguitarist,39048f,newaccount,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:10:10 2015 UTC,"Are you just noting what hits on the beat and what doesn't or are you trying to 'count' those off-beat chords as well? That seems to be the tricky part for me, because the way I play it feels right but I can't seem to determine exactly when to strum those off-beat chords."
bluesguitarist,39048f,newaccount,2,Mon Jun 8 09:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you count the off beats.  Generally in blues you follow a shuffle rhythm, with the ""one and two"" being more like ""one - and two"". How I usually think about is if you clap 3 times for each beat, but leave out the middle clap: clap - clap clap - clap clap - clap - so each beat is clap - clap. This is the classic Chicago style 12 bar rhythm:     1    &  2    &  3    &  4    & a|-2----2--4----4--5----5--4----4 e|-0----0--0----0--0----0--0----0   Then when figuring out the rhythms I pay attention to whether its on the first 'on the beat clap' or the second 'shuffle beat' clap, or in the space in between. Each of those can be broken into 2 smaller beats, like a quick up and down strum, and if there are any more notes it's played so fast that you just try to squeeze then in as quickly as you can - this is the case with a bit of SRV's work.  Most of blues leads follow the shuffle rhythm of one long note and one short one for each beat - even when played at twice the speed of the rhythm you still try and keep that shuffle flow - usually the down stroke of the pick is the long note, and you create the shuffle with the up stroke.  If you have windows media player, if you right click and select ""enhancements"" you can slow it down by 50% and keep the same pitch. This is a massive, massive help and I use it a lot."
bluesguitarist,39048f,newaccount,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry for the late reply!  The advice on using a 'slow down' feature has been really useful when it comes to understanding the rythm, since it's just too fast for me without that feature.  After a long time of trying to figure it out I was actually able to write something down. I feel like I got most of the rythm part down now.  What I'm still wondering however is how that standard shuffle rythm applies to this song in particular. Or was it meant more as a general rule of thumb?  Thanks for the advice! :)"
bluesguitarist,39048f,Shark__Sandwich,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:43:51 2015 UTC,The shuffle is a rule of thumb; not specific to this particular song. It's one of the things that is somewhat unique to all blues.

bluesguitarist,38xkdt,Splin7ers,2,Sun Jun 7 21:38:02 2015 UTC,Dommage! I thought I could ask you some blues advice in French to get a better comprehension :)
bluesguitarist,38xkdt,Splin7ers,2,Sun Jun 7 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry! I knew quite a bit of French as a kid - we studied it in school, but over the years it all kinda faded away. There are probably more Cantonese speaking people in Canada than French at this point. Essentially the province of Quebec and some Acadian on the east coast are the major French enclaves, and the Quebecois are often framed as angry xenophobes for trying to preserve a French culture there. They have had a couple of referendums on separating from Canada entirely (the answer: ""Non!"") and have political parties based on that idea."
bluesguitarist,38xkdt,newaccount,2,Sun Jun 7 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"Dommage stands for What a pity, I bet you wouldn't find that printed on a cereal box lol. We are aware here that some Québécois are considered as xenophobes, too bad. I think they have their own vision of the French culture, they would probably not agree with people here if that makes sense. We have many North American movies here which the original title is kept whereas in the region of Quebec they are always translated into French and sometimes these titles tend to be funny.   Btw, I noticed that you often use words I don't know the meaning and must look up in the dictionary. Are you a reader? If yes, what books would you recommend?"
bluesguitarist,38xkdt,Splin7ers,3,Sun Jun 7 20:38:07 2015 UTC,"If you want really good, poetic style check out Cormac McCarthy. But it's not happy stuff, and it's probably a bit difficult, but the guy is seriously good at putting words together that produce emotion. But it's really, really not happy. Blood Meridian literally gave me the most disturbing dreams I've ever had.  Another guy that despite being super famous doesn't get a lot of credit for how good he is at choosing just the right sentence is Stephen King, the horror author. I read a lot of his books ten years ago, and it really struck me how good he was at just putting one word after another to make you feel exactly what he wants you to feel."
bluesguitarist,38xkdt,Splin7ers,3,Sun Jun 7 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"These recommendations are fantastic man! Yeah, I read McCarthy's The Road. As you said, not happy at all but very deep and powerful. Unfortunately, I read it in French of course. I'll definitely grab a copy in English. As it is the only book I read written by him, I'll also check out Blood Meridian.   Same goes for Stephen King. I only read his books in French when I was a teen and stopped before college where I was expected to read more serious stuff. I'll check what he had been up to lately. Thanks."
bluesguitarist,38xkdt,Splin7ers,2,Sun Jun 7 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"I read a mountain of books as a kid. We had no TV in the living room, and my father was always handing me books to read. A lot of them were very old, so the kind of English you would pick up from them would sound old fashioned!  I had a friend from Chile who was trying to learn English, and we found that comic books and graphic novels were really effective because the images helped provide context, and the dialog is usually very easy to follow."
bluesguitarist,38xkdt,newaccount,2,Sun Jun 7 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"A mountain of books, no TV..you grew up in a sane environment man!  Thanks for the tip. I didn't think about that.

Try carefully counting it out and playing slowly. Refer back to a recording to check (a ""slow downer"" can help by playing the recording at a slower speed, but at the same pitch). Once you get it down, slowly increase your speed. Try to keep the rhythmic feel as you speed up. At some point it kind of clicks - then you lose it - then it kicks in again - then you lose it - then ...  You can do it."

Been trying DR strings and while they were ok tone-wise, I don't think they last as well as the D'Addarios I've been using.  I change mine about every two months."

bluesguitarist,38yrtf,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon Jun 8 00:01:20 2015 UTC,Criticism welcome
bluesguitarist,38yrtf,johnkdevnull,2,Mon Jun 8 04:31:54 2015 UTC,"I can hear your take a little clearer now on the speakers.  On headphones I can hear it perfectly.  Are you mixing on headphones?  Coincidentally, I watched a beardy guy called Fluff on Youtube yesterday who opined that mixing on headphones wasn't ideal because it is 'too detailed'.  I imagine he doesn't have to worry about annoying people though, since he seemed to live in a sound-proof basement.  Ideally I believe one should have neutral 'monitor' speakers for mixing.  Instead, I sometimes listen to my mp3 on different speakers and headphones before posting.  I have gone back to the mix once or twice in the past because of this.  Anyhoo, I don't have a lot of experience to back any of this up.  I'm just a Garageband amateur.  Your take sounds great.  Cool playing.  Classy tone and jazzy choice of notes."

bluesguitarist,38v0tk,GrilledSteeeze,5,Sun Jun 7 05:06:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome job man, real groovy! If i could offer one piece of criticism though, it would be to maybe work on building your solo up a little slower.  Around 0:20 you start ripping, but I think you could hold off for a little bit longer.  Think of it as you're telling a story, you don't want to hit the climax too early on.  I'm basically just echoing John Mayer's words in this video...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYLyXmAiIb0 but it has helped me a bunch. Keep killin' it though!"

bluesguitarist,38r663,Tired_of_this,7,Sat Jun 6 02:53:29 2015 UTC,"Hey there, new guy!  I highly recommend that regardless of your playing level, that you start with this awesome free course to get your fundamentals down:  http://www.justinguitar.com/en/BL-000-Blues.php  Go through that course man. Then come back and read this wall of text.  Intro  Blues has been around for over 100 years and is vast with many tributaries, from Delta finger style (and of course slide), rag time finger style  and Piedmont finger style and Hill country to Chicago, Memphis, Texas, Kansas City, West Coast, Jump, Boogie, etc  One can make a lifetime of study out of learning all of these styles and the particular vernaculars that go with them.  Having said all that, for a musician who already knows theory and how to play, it should be an interesting journey. Blues does not adhere to the conventions of western theory, but you can exploit it nonetheless. A blues often has 3 dominant chords in a row, so though you hear people call it a ""I IV V"", you could just as easily call it a ""V V V"", replete with the chord substitution avenues and melodic possibilities that presents.  The melodic tonality is neither major nor minor -- it is both, and the crux of that tonality stems from the tension between the major 3rd and the b7 found in the dominant chord. Blues mixes the major and minor pentatonic scales + b5, often in the same phrase. We are playing  1 2 b3 3 4 b5 5 6 b7  That is 9 notes to work with, and you can switch with the chords if you wanna get fancy. We also utilize the mixolydian mode, because dominant chords are built from it, and dorian, for that 6th flavor. You can also utilize dominant 7th arpeggios, m7b5 arpeggios, diminished arps and scales and whole tone scales. Almost all of those things can be found in those 9 notes, as well as a ton of opportunity for chromatics as well.  To Start  You should learn the basic rhythms -- shuffle, swing, straight 8ths. The progressions are mostly 12 bar, 12 bar with a quick change, 8 and 16 bar. The turnaround can be dead simple or fancy variations on 6 2 5 1, etc.  Chords are mostly dominant 7ths, 6s and 9s, and 13s. There is a lot to know about blues comping beyond the Chuck Berry type rhythm figure (Jimmy Reed man -- king of the shuffle) people think of. Minimal sliding voicings are preferred over giant 6 string chords. Check out these artists/songs to get an idea of the various styles/grooves to know:  Shuffle - Jimmy Reed  Minor blues - The Thrill is Gone  Minor blues with fancier turnaround - Stormy Monday  Tramp groove - Crosscut Saw  Riff based - Born Under a Bad Sign  8 (or 16) bar - Key to the Highway, Bring it on Home  This sub has over 1000 unique learning resources that I painstakingly sought out over the last 2 years in order to help people learn to play the blues. It is a searchable resource. If you utilize the search function here, you can find info on virtually any aspect of blues playing. Wanna learn slide? Type ""slide"" into the search box and you will find a bunch of slide lessons and resources. Want to know more about comping? Type ""comping"" into the search box, etc.   Finally, listen to a fuck ton of blues. You can't speak a language you don't hear!  I hope this helped. Wade through the sub, find a lesson and do that lesson. If you have and specific questions (they are better because you don't need to write a novel to answer them), people here will be glad to help. Enjoy the journey!"

bluesguitarist,38r663,dragon_guy12,2,Sun Jun 7 22:51:02 2015 UTC,Any Time
bluesguitarist,38r663,dragon_guy12,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:06:00 2015 UTC,"Learning 12-bar blues is a good start. You just pick a I7 chord them alternate with the IV7 and V7, e.g. a standard blues progression can be   I7-I7-I7-I7-  IV7-IV7-IV7-IV7  I7-I7-I7-I7 - I7-I7-I7-I7-  IV7-IV7-IV7-IV7 - IV7-IV7-IV7-IV7  V7-V7-V7-V7-  IV7-IV7-IV7-IV7-  I7-I7-I7-I7-I7-I7-V7-V7  That's only one example. You can also do 6ths instead, or 9ths, or add turnarounds, etc. It's all dissonance and freedom of expression. Just have fun with it."
bluesguitarist,38r663,dragon_guy12,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"Well that makes sense, from there it's just scales huh? I'm also interested in those ""random"" chords that are sometimes put into progressions like that. Is there a theory behind their composition or anywhere I can look into that?"
bluesguitarist,38r663,insomniacfc,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:54:19 2015 UTC,"Just a disclaimer, I don't know much theory yet, still got a lot to learn. However, Blues doesn't rely a lot in theory, just whatever sounds good by ear (which is true for music in general). For example, say you're doing Blues in E7. Normally B7 would be the V chord, but you can darken the B7 by adding a b9th, so B7b9. And instead of doing B7b9 for one measure, you can move between B7b9 and C7b9 for two measures. Again, it's all about what you want to do. Take a look at some song tabs by famous Blues artists (B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, etc.) And you'll find that the songs don't make much ""sense"" as far as theory goes, but they still sound good.  You should remember that Music Theory is derived from what people found generally pleasing in Western music; it's not meant to be followed strictly. Instead you can use it as a guide to make music that YOU want to make. If you want to throw a vi or a diminished chord in there, then go ahead, it's up to you. That's why Blues and Jazz are considered ancestors of modern music."

bluesguitarist,38ka00,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon Jun 8 00:50:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly I can't differentiate a mim to its American counterpart blindfolded assuming they're both well set, they feel and sound every bit as good at a quarter of the cost. That doesn't mean I believe some guys can't, I'm just not that refined I guess. I think I'll snag one of these kmise necks for my lousy tele clone next paycheck and I'll let you know how it works out.   I haven't had a working strat in a couple of years and somehow I identify as a full blooded Fenderist. There just isn't a suitable replacement for the versatility they offer, it's like having at least three guitars in one."

I'm ashamed of both of us here.  I'm slightly more inclined to find a strat on craigslist now than I am to piece this tele together. I spent the last day just getting the cold sweats thinking about them.  I've been thinking about this hot little mim two-tone burst I got with a tax return years ago that I had to sell . I had actual sentimental attachment to that thing. When I really think about it, after buying and selling so many guitars in my failed attempts at being a profitable guitar luthier and dealer the only one I miss even amongst guitars I never wanted to part with is that little strat.   Guitar cravings are sick. I tell myself that relentless consumerism is mostly unhealthy, yet when guitars are in question all that bullshit goes right out the window with me."

bluesguitarist,38i75c,Assburgers_And_Coke,2,Thu Jun 4 17:24:12 2015 UTC,I can do this for Ya. Lmk man. I just need to get some equipment which I should be getting within the month to record.
bluesguitarist,38i75c,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"No thanks, I just want to learn this style."
bluesguitarist,38i75c,Stubby9,2,Thu Jun 4 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"It's blues -- major and minor pentatonic + b5 with the occasional Mixolydian flourish.  It's a sophisticated sound mostly due to the chord changes.  If you dig more sophisticated sounds like this, you would dig Robben Ford, Larry Carlton, Herb Ellis, Barney Kessel, Cornell Dupree, Gatemouth Brown, Tiny Grimes, Pee Wee Crayton, Hollywood Fats, Ronnie Earl, Duke Robillard, Little Charlie and the Nightcats, etc  Edit: thanks for including the back track by the way! : D"
bluesguitarist,38gs77,BillFuckingEvans,5,Thu Jun 4 02:44:25 2015 UTC,"Man, that's so inspiring, peaceful and relax. Just wish it was longer."
bluesguitarist,38gs77,Splin7ers,3,Thu Jun 4 11:29:40 2015 UTC,Hey you got the multi track thing worked out! Great playin'!
bluesguitarist,38gs77,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jun 4 04:30:38 2015 UTC,"Ya! I'm using Audacity right now, but I'm thinking of switching."
bluesguitarist,38gs77,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jun 4 17:53:14 2015 UTC,"I got used to this thing called Cool Edit Pro. I got a cracked version in a torrent. Used it forever. Then Adobe bought it and calls it Adobe Audition, so I got it in the bundle with Photoshop, etc. I have Audacity, but haven't really checked it out. The interface doesn't look very intuitive."
bluesguitarist,38gs77,johnkdevnull,3,Thu Jun 4 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"Mmmm cool.  Very nice with the wah and the harmonics.  Great vibe and tasty, restrained playing."

bluesguitarist,38fcir,johnkdevnull,4,Wed Jun 3 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"Not long enough!  Edit: okay, after careful scrutiny I can say that although I know nothing about recording/mixing, that I feel that your guitar might have benefited from just a bit of moisture -- not grain silo size, just a bit."
bluesguitarist,38fcir,bluesnoodler_,3,Thu Jun 4 02:01:41 2015 UTC,Ha! What a cop out! That's some hard hitting criticism right there. Up Vote for you.
bluesguitarist,38fcir,tallpapab,2,Thu Jun 4 02:29:18 2015 UTC,Lol
bluesguitarist,38fcir,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:43:59 2015 UTC,So too dry?  Maybe an effect or something?  Is that the kinda thing you mean?    One problem I had was that the volume pedal parts came out quieter than the normal bits.  I compensated later in the take by playing those parts harder but it meant I had to fix the levels with automated volume changes in Garageband.  Maybe I made them too high.
bluesguitarist,38fcir,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jun 4 06:26:00 2015 UTC,"Just a wee bit of reverb. Again -- I know nothing about mixing/mastering, though perhaps upping the volume in the mix made some parts crispier.   Edit: sorry it took so long to respond, but it is currently 7:30 am here, so your response was at around 2:30 am here."
bluesguitarist,38fcir,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:35:46 2015 UTC,I'll give that a go.  Appreciate your input!
bluesguitarist,38fcir,BillFuckingEvans,2,Thu Jun 4 12:43:22 2015 UTC,"No worries man. I honestly suck at this criticism thing. I like to assist and encourage beginners or answer specific questions, but when it comes to cats like you I just enjoy listening. : /"
bluesguitarist,38fcir,tallpapab,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:50:29 2015 UTC,Thanks.  :D  I think it's going quite well though.  Loads of people contributing comments.  No one mortally offended -  yet.  lol.  Loads of info going back and forward.  It's all good.
bluesguitarist,38fcir,danihendrix,2,Thu Jun 4 14:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, it seems to be pretty productive! Where I might be able to weigh in more is when we are talking strictly about playing blues, which is more or less in my wheelhouse."
bluesguitarist,38fcir,Splin7ers,5,Thu Jun 4 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"Damn, I liked it. I was expecting more funk than sad from this track, but it worked."
bluesguitarist,38fcir,Splin7ers,3,Thu Jun 4 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you /u/BillFuckingEvans.  Lol, every time I use your user name it makes my comment sound sarcastic."
bluesguitarist,38dq93,danihendrix,3,Wed Jun 3 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, what have I started?  Criticism IS difficult.  First of all I thought it was great.  Well played, great tone.  So there isn't a lot left to say.  I can't hear anything wrong with your playing technique.  So this is really just about my musical taste and you, and other people could disagree but I thought some of your phrases were a bit regular and on the beat.  I would try to mix it up a little with faster and slower phrases.  Since you picked a lot of the notes in your phrases, maybe occasionally using legato would help you add variety."
bluesguitarist,38dq93,johnkdevnull,2,Wed Jun 3 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"haha I loved your idea :) My ego loves a stroke of course, but I also need the honesty to improve. Did you really think the tone was good? If so great, it was a preset on my recording unit with my soul food in there too.   I especially noticed I was flooding it a bit towards the end. I'm not very well practiced at playing off the beat if i'm honest. I have a bit of a fear of being out with some phrases. Need to remedy that.  I threw a fast lick in this one, but again I always find myself reverting back to on the beat. Not sure If i can't play fast enough disciplined enough yet. But I will keep trying!  Legato will be added :P  Thanks John, good points."
bluesguitarist,38dq93,johnkdevnull,2,Wed Jun 3 19:09:50 2015 UTC,I did notice that fast lick.  Very cool.  I'll be stealing that.  :P
bluesguitarist,38dq93,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jun 4 06:51:22 2015 UTC,Lol -- I honestly had to really scrutinize to find anything to say. I see people improving over time and I am excited to point out the positives. What I dug about this one is that Dani appears to be throwing some cool wide interval sequencing licks in his last couple of tracks. I recognize it because that is one of my usual tropes.
bluesguitarist,38dq93,bluesnoodler_,3,Wed Jun 3 17:28:31 2015 UTC,What do you mean by wide sequencing licks? I still suck at theory a bit :P But thanks as ever my man
bluesguitarist,38dq93,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed Jun 3 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"Where you play a scalar run by starting on a note, then playing a note in the scale like maybe a minor 3rd away, then you play the next note from where you started, play a note a minor 3rd away, etc.  I will find the time in the track where it happens..."
bluesguitarist,38dq93,CatConfectionary,2,Wed Jun 3 22:36:49 2015 UTC,"I love your playing, especially your fierce vibrato. If you could try and sync that potent vibrato with the rhythm more it would be hella more effective."
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,Splin7ers,4,Tue Jun 2 21:27:56 2015 UTC,"Following the criticism thread discussion posted by /u/bluesnoodler_, I'd like to have some constructive criticism about my attempt at covering this tricky song. I'd been playing this since Sunday and I have all my fingers bleeding.  Thanks."
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,newaccount,3,Tue Jun 2 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, that's very impressive! You've nailed the feel and the flow, which is the important part. The timing gets a little muddy at times, but its only been a few days so in a week or two you'll nail that as well.  The two things that will make it go from awesome to really jaw dropping are the thumb work and the riffs.   With the thumb it needs to be on autopilot, especially in the octave riffs behind where the voice kicks in. Let the melody play in triplets and hit the thumb just on the beat. It's hard, but it's more of a mental thing than a technique thing, if you can separate the two parts in your brain when you play it it suddenly becomes normal to play that way. It's incredibly effective, it gives the riff (and song) a massive sense of space and atmosphere and it also generates more momentum than quick triplets with both notes played in the same rhythm. Robert Johnson used to do it in his turnarounds, playing the thumb on the beat or on the beat and the shuffle and the melody as triplets, and Corey does it a bit playing this live. You do it in the main riff, adding a quick shuffle beat while going into the G bass note. If you can do that in the riffs, you'll take them out of the realm of the mere mortal and into something amazing.  Similar, with the licks you have to think about them as a separate instrument kicking in over the top, It sounds stupid, but sometimes it seems you can make things sound different through the force of will alone, maybe you play a tiny bit louder, or a tiny bit off the beat, but there's a way to really make it sound like a different instrument is playing that part.   I'm not sure if there's an standard way that works for everyone, I think you kind of have to work out how to get your own 'second instrument' out by your self. For me, I consciously change thinking from ""keep the rhythm on the beat"" to ""just fucking own this"". I'm usually a three finger picker, and after I really nail a lick over the top I usually find I've played it with just the middle finger, maybe with a bit of help from the index if it's fast. I guess it changes from a more flowing rhythm to a choppy staccato feel. So if you are alternating fingers, maybe try hitting the licks with just one finger to give the 'lead' licks a slightly different flavour than the rhythm licks, if you know what I mean.  But seriously good work. Give it another 10 days and you'll have fined tuned it up to a level anyone would be proud of. Think about how good you'll make this sound in 6 months! Congrats!"
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,newaccount,3,Wed Jun 3 07:00:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much man! It means a lot to me! I am able to play this tune today this way also thanks to your great site, I've learnt a lot from there.  I see clearly what you mean : I came to the point that my thumb is on autopilot as you put it in the main riff. I just realized with your comment that I play the other riffs with both notes played in the same rhythm because of some wrong habit I got from I can't remember where. I would be more careful and practice again with that in mind.   I think you are bringing me here to another level. I clearly get the meaning of the 'second instrument' idea. I also read that on your site for Lightnin' Hopkins Bring Me My Shotgun. Hopkins surely embodied this idea like no other. I'll also try to keep that in mind from now on. When I picked up my guitar two or three months ago just after feeling that I wanted to play blues seriously, I had begun with the three fingers technique but I slowly find myself using my thumb and my index fingers only. I even managed to come up with some groovy riffs à la RL Burnside this way. It gives much more vibe.  Well, once again thank you for your time and this constructive comments. I'll definitely keep that in mind from tonight. : D"
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,tallpapab,3,Wed Jun 3 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"No worries, as I said it's very impressive as it is and in a few months....wow!"
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,bluesnoodler_,5,Wed Jun 3 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no suggestions. I kind of zoned out on your sweet rendition. Touched my worried mind today. Thanks."
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,tallpapab,3,Tue Jun 2 23:42:38 2015 UTC,How's the rib?
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,bluesnoodler_,3,Tue Jun 2 23:51:04 2015 UTC,The rib is getting better. Should be just fine in a few days. Thanks for asking.
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,bluesnoodler_,3,Wed Jun 3 06:03:55 2015 UTC,Thank you for the compliment man! It touches me right into my heart. Loved your You Gotta Move version by the way.
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,dummyguava,3,Wed Jun 3 06:20:35 2015 UTC,This is great man! You really got the vibe! Pretty ambitious material! You have the Harris attack down. But -- be careful of the time and rhythm! You are in the pocket most of the time though. Tap your foot while you play to keep time
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,dummyguava,3,Tue Jun 2 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you man! :) I came to the blues thanks to Skip James and I love Harris' version, that's why I have some perseverance.   I listened to it again and I can clearly hear that my rhythm is sloppy sometimes. I'll take your advice and practice again.   I'm not searching for some excuse but my very old axe is beaten and cracked and the intonation is no good, it makes it really hard to play especially on the higher strings. My luthier says I got a pile of shit but I love the sound."
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,dummyguava,3,Tue Jun 2 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"It does have a beautiful tone. I learned on a piece of shit guitar with deep action, and I like to think it made me work harder. You remind me of myself!"
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,dummyguava,3,Wed Jun 3 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the action is deep that's what I meant but it has some good mojo. It's a Slingerland Maybell from the 30s I got for $150. It takes me into that era man!"
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,newaccount,2,Wed Jun 3 06:19:21 2015 UTC,Slingerland Maybell   Dude! Pics! I LOVE those old guitars. Google shows me a couple of options - is it the flat top or the archtop?
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,newaccount,2,Thu Jun 4 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, I didn't see that. Here it is!"
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,dummyguava,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"Very, very sweet. What a great looking guitar!"
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,dummyguava,3,Sat Jun 6 08:01:44 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite tunes to play, and I first came into it from Corey Harris version. It's a great version. I then incorporated some of Skip's and John Fahey and now it's kinda my version I guess. Anyway, nice. From memory Corey uses a slightly unusual tuning - are you using that? I ended up sticking with open G."
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,newaccount,2,Wed Jun 3 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess you have your version now. I'll be glad to listen to it. You're right, Corey uses an open Em tuning. I think it's Em : from a standard tuning, I tune the D string to an E and the B string to an A and you got it. I must practice again, I'm too young to add my flavor in it."
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,dummyguava,2,Wed Jun 3 06:23:59 2015 UTC,"I posted it to this sub a while back here. As for adding flavor, practice and it will come. I've been playing this tune for years - literally (and I still messed up a bit). I have an older version recorded too and it sounds quite different, but it's one of the things I love about this tune. Once you get the bones down there is lots of room to have fun."
bluesguitarist,38a1o9,newaccount,2,Wed Jun 3 07:03:10 2015 UTC,"Hey man, your version is awesome! I love it! Great tone, good voice. I see how much fun you have with this tune."
bluesguitarist,3899ds,bluesnoodler_,2,Tue Jun 2 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Lots of Dave van Ronk vibes here, very cool."
bluesguitarist,388epn,johnkdevnull,7,Tue Jun 2 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"No, I agree that criticism isn't always wanted.  So perhaps there could be a convention where the post title invites critique?  E.g.  Critique please: Jam #26 Submission"
bluesguitarist,388epn,tallpapab,5,Tue Jun 2 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"I like it! It's also a work saver! Just ask when you are posting. I like your ""tag"" there, so we'll run with it.  /thread"
bluesguitarist,388epn,Splin7ers,6,Tue Jun 2 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"One thing that I love about this sub is the encouragement. Several times it has prevented my just giving up. There is ample criticism to be found elsewhere on reddit. Then there's also my wife ...(rimshot)... But seriously folks, how about a [CRITICISEME] tag (or something similar) for when one wants some pointers?"
bluesguitarist,388epn,mariox19,4,Tue Jun 2 18:09:23 2015 UTC,":D  My main aim is to encourage people here, and I am sincere in what I say -- I'm not gonna blow smoke up anyone's ass.   My only reservation about the whole idea is that to have these kind of distinctions tends to narrow the focus elsewhere, like if you don't tag you entry then people will think ""well they didn't tag it, so they don't want my opinion"", so rather than freely offering their thoughts lest they commit a faux pas, they say nothing.  Still, we can float this and see what happens. The other problem is informing people of the whole thing, which beyond this thread will be an ongoing battle  Edit: I will announce the tag in the jam thread weekly. I will also put a blurb in the sidebar. We can try it for a month then we'll discuss how it's going and decide whether to keep the idea or 86 it"
bluesguitarist,388epn,tallpapab,6,Tue Jun 2 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"Great idea! I'm in, not to criticize but to receive positive criticism from you people.   I'd suggest to agree on a specific tag to use in the title for those who want to get constructive criticism.   I don't post jams for many reasons : don't have the skill, and don't have the gear for decent recordings but I practice everyday and sometimes some riffs (or licks, I don't know how to put it) would show up and I like it. Nevertheless, I don't know if it's good, I mean if that's blues enough or not and for what reasons so I would love to post links to those little pieces of music I can record with my phone and receive constructive feedback. It would totally fit that sub I think as that is also part of learning blues. In other words, jams are great, don't get me wrong but it would be great to have other types of recordings on here also.   For example, I'm currently learning Corey Harris' version of Special Rider Blues but have no friends to guide me on the right path. This song is tricky as hell for a beginner. I'd love to have some guidance.   Hope that makes sense. What do you think?"
bluesguitarist,388epn,ddshroom,4,Tue Jun 2 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely man. The main sort of plan here was to help people learn blues guitar. So just tag those posts, and people here will be happy to help"
bluesguitarist,388epn,johnkdevnull,3,Tue Jun 2 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"I think the person submitting the jam is going to have to elicit criticism. In other words, the initial reaction to a submission might only be stuff like, ""Great job, man!"" The OP will likely have to be prepared to follow up with specific questions inviting critique on some aspect of the playing.  Real criticism is not easy."
bluesguitarist,388epn,ddshroom,3,Tue Jun 2 20:58:08 2015 UTC,Real criticism is not easy.   Excellent point!

bluesguitarist,384au7,johnkdevnull,2,Mon Jun 1 19:24:49 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I like it much.  Not enough blues in it.
bluesguitarist,384au7,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon Jun 1 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"Dig it! Wouldn't worry too much about how much blues is in it -- you manage to keep the blend, and your licks are so much fun to listen to I'm just happy to hear 'em."
bluesguitarist,384au7,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon Jun 1 22:17:34 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Always nice to get positive feedback.  Any feedback is good though.  I'd be happy to get some critical responses.    Anyone want to have a go?   :D  I used to post to a guitar forum where people would critique your entry and I actually really appreciated it.  I got some great feedback about recording and playing.  Not a bad thing at all.
bluesguitarist,384au7,grouchyfrostgiant,2,Mon Jun 1 22:48:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. If people explicitly ask for it, I'm in. I know virtually nothing about recording/mixing, so I can't really say much about that to anyone, which leaves playing, which is a fairly subjective thing, but I can usually think of something.   How about a Critique Thread, where people post with the expectation that they are going to get unvarnished constructive criticism?"
bluesguitarist,384au7,grouchyfrostgiant,2,Tue Jun 2 01:41:24 2015 UTC,Sounds like a plan.

I guess just using the mic on the phone would be easiest, but I have no idea how to place it and keep it in place to get a decent frame, see what is being filmed, etc  Teach an old dog some new tricks!"
bluesguitarist,37y47e,Splin7ers,3,Sun May 31 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"You should consider getting a real camera. There is nothing wrong with the camera in your phone, but it is hard to mount, and as you mentioned, getting good sound quality will be a challenge. You would be better off with a cam that you can mount on a tripod, that has an external mic jack.   If you just can't do that, try something like this"
bluesguitarist,37y47e,newaccount,3,Sun May 31 14:06:58 2015 UTC,That Gorilla Pod looks nice and versatile. Does the HTC one have a front facing camera? It might be easier making instructional vids if you can see what's in frame as you are doing it. You could get a little closer.

bluesguitarist,37va9e,what_the_fuzz,10,Sat May 30 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"You can too with a bit of work in an afternoon or so you should be able to do an impression of him, at least enough to encourage you to keep going. Have you played in open e yet? This is a slidey B major routine I believe.  Derek plays in open E almost exclusively meaning he only needs to barre at any given fret to play a major chord; you cannot get this exact tone in E standard without impossibly using three slides at once. You need this advantage as a slide is a real handicap as well as a tool. Even if it's only on one finger all your other fingers have to dance around it, and because you have tendons in your hand that control pairs of fingers you can't do a lot independently with the other while one is confined. On that note I have seen one guy use two slides on the same hand very effectively. I believe he won guitar centers king of the blues contest or at least made it to the finals.  Derek is also a master of muting with both hands. If he wasn't muting so well with his right hand you would hear a lot of knocking as the slide bumps over the frets.  Listen to Elmore James and Duane Allman, that's where he got it. Granted he has built his own name since, he would be a real estate agent or something like that today without them.  Keep your tone below 9 and above 4. The sweet spot is different on all guitars it seems like. You'll know when you get it. It's also important to use the neck pickup exclusively as the bridge pickup on anything is going to run way too hot and sound very overbearing. It isn't that it isn't physically possible to make good slide on the bridge pickup, but if you want that same round and buttery tone he has you have to use the neck pickup. Another part of his round tone comes from using finger tips all the time as far as I'm aware. HE goes beyond the PIMA technique and uses his pinky as well.  When I say you can do an impression of him on day one, I mean you should immediately get the left hand part down. Learning to slide while only letting a single note resonate takes a lot of muting control and practice, even if your already good at harnessing pickup feedback from open strings it gets way harder when adding the clunky slide to your finger.  As far as slides go I believe personally that glass and ceramic slides are superior to their steel cousins. Not everyone agrees with that. When Duane Allman was sick in the hospital he used a glass pill bottle while sick in bed so he could just lay it across his lap.  One more point, and I say this alot, Keep an eye on your neck if you begin doing this. Tuning up adds a deal of tension and left tuned up it can damage your guitar over time. Read up on truss adjustments, they aren't anything to be intimidated by, just a couple clicks. It might be best if you have one to just dedicate a single guitar to open e. I get around this by playing in dadgad or open d meaning I don't actually add any tension to the neck and I have a lower end to select from.  Hope this helps somehow, I'm obviously obsessed with the Allman Bro's and will stop whatever I'm doing at the drop of a hat to talk about them! Check out Gov't Mule if you get a chance, very worthy spin-off."

So if I am correct, when such a track is in Cm, I should just stick to the C minor pentatonic over all the bars ?   I tried that with a backtrack in A last week. Obviously, I used the A blues scale over it and I don't know why this sounded strange over the D and E bars to my poor ears. Am I missing something ?   As you know it, I've been learning blues since two months and I am trying many things at the same time : fingerpicking acoustic Delta style (52weeksof blues), blues scales theory and various licks (from sources you throw here), different kind of rythmes (justinguitar) and I have sometimes the feeling that I know nothing like John Snow :)"

bluesguitarist,3739sm,aging_phoenix,3,Sun May 24 13:46:05 2015 UTC,"So, I ran across this sub because hearing Gary Clark, Jr play rekindled my love for the blues.  I grew up listening to Chicago style (Lightning Hopkins, Muddy Waters) and then Texas (Stevie Ray) at home.  Here's the odd thing. I played classical guitar from 7-13, and rock from 14-20, and then stopped playing. Why the F did I never play blues?  So now I'm trying to re-educate myself, and have my 35 year old Alvarez Yairi I'm fixing the action on and getting back into it.  I'm 50 yrs old, and picking up a guitar after 30 years is not like riding a bike.  It's a bit of a grind. My fingers are all fumbley, and not strong, and my left hand fingers are delicate f-ing flowers and have no calluses.  So, for discussion purposes:  What inspires you guys to play/listen to blues?

It feels like my natural voice when I play. Also, it's a life long study -- there are so many different styles and little niche vernaculars that go with them after over 100 years of the stuff that you couldn't be master of it all in a lifetime."

I had trouble with latency on my Mac using Audacity until I figured out how to use the 2i2 interface correctly for monitoring.  Anyway, back to AEM: During installation it runs some sort of algorithm to guage latency on the device. It issues some pings and times something. So, after installation it seems to sync the tracks OK. I'm pretty happy. I'm going to use it on trips away from my home ""studio"".  You might want to check it out. There's a free demo version which I don't think does the latency calibration. So, even to just check it out it's probably worth the $5."

bluesguitarist,36vi6n,bluesnoodler_,5,Fri May 22 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"He's got a looper pedal. So he lays down a pretty simple bass line into the pedal and then plays over it with some nice, sweet, laid back groovin. To get started learn a few bass lines, practice recording them with a looper (you need to get the timing right), then learn to play around with a blues scale over your bass line. The guy in the video goes farther with double stops and some other harmony, but the first two steps I mention will get you into a lot of trouble fun. Are you new to the instrument? New to blues guitar? You've landed in a good place here."

bluesguitarist,36rbtq,Splin7ers,1 point,Thu May 21 18:15:09 2015 UTC,Chord stabs? Is that a quick hammer-on kind of thing?
bluesguitarist,36rbtq,AcesMcCheese,1 point,Fri May 22 00:39:46 2015 UTC,"It is derived from the idea of ""horn stabs"" where the horn section plays a chord in a short rhythmic blast, so you just ""stab"" the chord for like one eighth note"

bluesguitarist,3695vp,danihendrix,3,Sun May 17 17:53:00 2015 UTC,"I am 32, living in France currently. I discovered the blues four years ago when I heard Skip James' 1931 recordings. Something happened at that moment and I've slowly began to change, drifting from the punk/metal world to the blues. I was kinda lost these last years, very angry and disappointed at everything. Then I discovered John Campbell's recordings last year and the change was completed. I searched for authenticity, I was hungry for that and I feel I've found it in the blues.   I've been practicing daily since two months and I cannot stop. I am only at the beginning of this adventure. I started to compose my own little riffs and I feel alive into the blues (if that makes sense)."

bluesguitarist,3618ev,RickMcCargar,2,Fri May 15 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was lucky to first see him live in the 60s, then saw him multiple times in each subsequent decade.  Spent a New Year's Eve at his club in Memphis.  He played a while with his band, then came to every table to say hello.   The man even played 100 shows a year in his 80s.  From share-cropper to chart-topper - He came a long way, and brought such happiness with him. A truly great man who will be sorely missed."
bluesguitarist,3618ev,samwilly67,2,Fri May 15 15:51:04 2015 UTC,I only heard him once but that was when I wasn't even born yet. My mom was 8 months pregnant with me 4th row from him.

bluesguitarist,361t0o,bluesnoodler_,8,Fri May 15 11:29:21 2015 UTC,"Note from Buddy Guy:   This morning, I come to you all with a heavy heart.   BB King was the greatest guy I ever met. The tone he got out of that guitar, the way he shook his left wrist, the way he squeezed the strings... man, he came out with that and it was all new to the whole guitar playin' world. He could play so smooth, he didn't have to put on a show. The way BB did it is the way we all do it now. He was my best friend and father to us all.   I'll miss you, B. I love you and I promise I will keep these damn Blues alive. Rest well.   All my love,   Buddy"
bluesguitarist,361t0o,serve_fidelis,3,Fri May 15 11:42:46 2015 UTC,"Buddy - beautiful musician in your own right and spokesman of the blues as well. In Texas that legacy is alive and well, and maybe it is important to remember that blues are from the people, by the people and for the people. You cannot hope that mainstream music industries can honor the memory of BB and those like him (and you). But that is not where he came from, and that is not the people that will honor him. Blues is played in our houses, and in small gatherings and in small venues. We listen to the recordings we love, and my own children surprise me with the knowledge they have of traditions in blues from a lot of places. We play the music we love, and there is a lot of accessibility to music of all stripes.  In humbleness and love, please keep playing the blues and keeping your own ideas and songs out there. BB was the Mayor of Bluesville, maybe, but people like you and some of the youngsters I see give me a lot of confidence. Play on! God bless you!"
bluesguitarist,361t0o,mariox19,6,Sat May 16 01:18:09 2015 UTC,"= (  I sincerely  hope he is wrong about that.   I saw BB a bunch of times in the 80s - like every summer he blew through town and me and my siblings and friends would go see him and dance our asses off through the whole set.  I really worry about the future of blues music and I sincerely hope that this little postage stamp in cyberspace contributes in some tiny way in keeping it alive.  BB was 89. He didn't owe us a damn thing when he passed away, but he left a great big hole in the blues that I fear will never be filled.  I am just super sad right now, and the phone has been going off since 6 am here at our sekrit HQ.  Be good to each other folks."
bluesguitarist,361t0o,BruinsMurph,7,Fri May 15 11:37:59 2015 UTC,"I sincerely hope he is wrong about that.   Well, he did qualify that by saying something about ""pure blues."" The blues players today have a heavy influence of both Rock and Jazz, so maybe that's what's he's referring to.  Is Buddy Guy now the last of the ""old timers""? (He's actually a half generation younger than B.B.'s peers.)"
bluesguitarist,361t0o,tallpapab,6,Fri May 15 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"Is Buddy Guy now the last of the ""old timers""?    Taj Mahal comes to mind. I think he's a few years younger than Buddy; but definitely old school"
bluesguitarist,361t0o,Rochefort,6,Fri May 15 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"just want to pop in to say that the blues is still being played out here in Oakland/Berkeley/SF. Every Friday evening I go to a local Berkeley BBQ joint and hear live Delta blues just like it's been done for the past eight decades or so. The crowd is mostly in their 20s and 30s. So take heart. BB is gone, but wont be soon forgotten. He left us with a great treasure of music and instruction. I encourage everyone to read his autobiography. It is sad to realize that he's no longer out there somewhere on his bus ready to play in the next town, but what a man, what great gifts he left us all."
bluesguitarist,361t0o,carmour,2,Fri May 15 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think the contemporary blues scene, while small, is thriving. My city has a number of blues bars where they have live blues 6 nights a week."
bluesguitarist,361t0o,otto6457,3,Sun May 17 15:23:22 2015 UTC,"I really disagree with what he says. I know plenty of players who are out there playing the real damn thing, and frankly it pisses me off to hear Clapton say this. Just because they aren't known to him, doesn't mean they aren't out there doing it :/ So sad and ignorant but obviously he is forgiven as he is clearly emotional.  The blues will never die god dammit."
bluesguitarist,361t0o,Hayden9001,3,Fri May 15 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"""The blues will never die""  I so hope you're right.  I fear its dying with my generation, (I'm 57).  I went to blues show last year and everyone was my age or older.  B.B. Was the first popular blues guy I ever heard and because of him I found so many others.  But I fear the next generation won't know the blues or where to look for it.  It makes me sad.  Especially today."
bluesguitarist,361t0o,carmour,9,Fri May 15 18:06:50 2015 UTC,I'm a seventeen year old kid who spends every night playing along to BB King records. My musical life is dedicated to the blues. I've seen many on the Internet a lot like me. We're out there.

bluesguitarist,35wubn,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu May 14 13:02:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I think my favorite song from that concert is ""You Don't Love Me"".  Dickey plays an extended solo that is actually solo guitar.   The album is a mixed with the guitar and bass more upfront, so it sounds amazing.  Berry Oakley plays a lot of guitar lines on bass to help out Dickey while they are still figuring out what to do as a band with Duane suddenly gone.    Remember that Dickey and Berry played together before Duane tried to steal Berry away, so they had a history of playing together so converting the songs was going to be easier for them than it might otherwise have been.  The results are uneven on the recording, but there are so many splendid pieces that it has quickly become one of my favorite live albums."

Downtown Baltimore you say?  Poor Boy what are ya doin' there? I'm mournin' the death of Freddie Gray.  They threw him in the back of a police van, And rode him around town that day, They dragged him out beaten and broken, Now I'm mournin' the death of Freddie Gray.  Poor Boy if you go down to Baltimore, Watch out for the police and their ways. Don't be tempted by lootin' and riotin' Don't want to mourn more than the death of Freddie Gray.

Keep my blues band for side gigs. My guitar teacher showed me Stevie Ray Vaughan and it went from there. All of Steve's influences really stuck with me: Albert Collins, Johnny Copeland, Freddie King and A. King."

bluesguitarist,35hqsv,FroggysAnalPoundCake,4,Sun May 10 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"Hey Folks, another Scot here. Been playing around 15yrs, on and off, but no where near as knowledgeable or skilful as someone who's been had a guitar this long should be. Really enjoying the tracks on this sub, it's given me a  wee boost of enthusiasm in my own playing. I enjoy the slower stuff, rather than rockier blues, but really enjoying the range of submissions to the jam tracks as many of them are not in a style I would seek out, so great to widen my horizons with.   I've been playing for years on a beat up old strat copy, but it's been suffering with fret pitting pretty badly the last few years. I managed to cough up for a cheap Tele clone recently, just getting used to it now.. feels like I'm learning to play all over again, the spacing and fingering is just off a little.. and the weight. This thing feels like a slab of granite compared to the strat clone. Cheap as hell, but it'll do."
bluesguitarist,35hqsv,Mikethrillmas,5,Sun May 10 19:38:42 2015 UTC,"26 y/o dude from New Jersey USA. Started playing at 14 in high school.

Lesson being, don't ever stop playing."

bluesguitarist,357005,Rythameen,2,Thu May 7 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, and absolutely. If I was playing with a bassist who stuck with the roots, then the audience would obviously just hear an A9. With just the solo guitar, however, I always just call it a diminished sub, as the ear processes sound low to high, It's amazing how much the feeling of that chord changes once you add in a low A in the bass. Fun stuff."

bluesguitarist,354fpw,DrPuffinStuff,2,Thu May 7 09:12:40 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I think he uses it or close variations on several of his songs. So I left it non-specific.

bluesguitarist,351q3z,HotRats92,5,Wed May 6 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"Hey man -- great playing! Really dug the way you dug into some double stop stuff and the pivoting licks. Can tell you've been listening to a bit of Clapton! If I must be critical, I'd say this:   Try peeling the gain back a notch or two -- like to the point where you might think it sounds a bit thin. That way when you dig in you'll get more dynamics.  Experiment with leaving space and starting phrases on an upbeat etc to switch it up a bit. Think a bit about ""call and response"" with your phrases. Post here more often for fuck's sake!"
bluesguitarist,351q3z,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed May 6 13:12:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome, your guitar sounds really good"
bluesguitarist,351q3z,zoidbergular,2,Wed May 6 12:33:14 2015 UTC,Great playing! By the way Hot Rats is one of my favorite albums. Long live Zappa! Let's not forget Captain Beefheart!
bluesguitarist,351q3z,Nappyheadedbro,2,Wed May 6 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"Great playing!  The only small critic I could think of is your right hand is too consistent.  There's a good amount of feeling coming from your left by your right is picking the same way just about every time.  By attacking the string more, maybe pick through a couple muted string before/after you pick the target string, picking under the string rather than at its side, hold the pick a little differently, change the pick's angle of attack (so instead of flat, go at the string as if you were trying to cut it with the pick).  The dynamic range is just a little flat.  Every note sounds the same.  And that works in some stuff.  But in the Blues you want a build up.  You want the voice of the guitar to change.  Most people use effects or change the volume knobs on the guitar/amps.  But the most effective is to change what you're doing with your right hand."
bluesguitarist,351q3z,DoxasticPoo,2,Wed May 6 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"You got it down. Just pepper in some dimension. The whole point of having a strat is making the most of the readily available volume knob, try to think of it as a clutch that needs to be adjusted as gas is given to it if that makes sense. Clapton was constantly tweaking between volume and tone swells. On that famous crossroads  riff he kept the volume so low it would almost cut out. It sounds gimmicky perhaps, but it is the only noticeable difference in you and him on this track. You made it to the elite ranks of guys that play really well.  A good example is at the 1:07 mark. Mind you nothing you did was at all wrong, but if you cut the volume down to 7 or as low as 4 or 5 you would have resolve to the end of that opening phrase you did, like a period at the end of the sentence. notice how infuriating that missing punctuation is  Ending a run on a quieter chord volume wise is the equivalent of ""phwew.""  Ending heavier can emulate swearing.  Think about a conversation you have with a friend. When people say call and response they mean to emulate these attitudes over the course of a conversation, which flare up a bit and has its ups and downs. There is something in our brain that wants closure. A really, really good example of call and response work is on Highway Chile by Hendrix. The guitar just finishes his sentences for him."
bluesguitarist,351q3z,Mikethrillmas,2,Wed May 6 17:12:21 2015 UTC,This track gave me a currently incurable Strat jones! My trusty MiM is fretted out beyond help and the bridge is mostly kruft. : (
bluesguitarist,351q3z,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed May 6 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. Part of being a fender owner is doing the constant adjustments and maintence it needs to make it the worlds greatest guitar. I think a really well set up  stock strat will always be my favorite guitar. Even though I have some cheap strat clones they just aren't  quite the same as my old mimburst. I just now realize I haven't  played a true strat in about two years, time goes by like an arrow.  You know I avoided fret leveling for years due to fear of irreparable damage afterwards. Well I got skunked last summer with a lousy tele clone on amazon that had fret tangs overhanging on the sides by a good deal as well as dents along the top. As it turns out leveling frets isn't too bad at all. So long as you focus and watch a tutorial before hand if you're  unfamiliar with the filing process that guitar could play like new. An all parts brand  bridge that works and looks perfect would cost around 20 bucks in your area if I had to guess."
bluesguitarist,351q3z,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Thu May 7 08:08:03 2015 UTC,"I am no Ed Roman, but I have leveled a few frets. Things are past that point -- needs a refret. I have a pretty good case of Strat Hands, and have ground my fave spots down so far there is just nowhere to go. : |  The other curious thing is this: my saddles and springs got krufted to the point where I thought I'd get a new set. Replacements from Fender didn't fit 'cause the MiM bridge is narrower than standard.   So, between a new neck and a new bridge/trem, I could get another MiM for the same dough.   Really I need two! Cause I have accumulated a trem fit JB and a stacked neck pup out of some higher end Yamaha shred machine  in the interim as well, and they need a host!  : P"
bluesguitarist,351q3z,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu May 7 11:47:25 2015 UTC,"I thought the tone was very good, and you definitely know your licks. The one critique I have would be timing, watch especially when you're transitioning from slower parts to faster, making that transition smoother will improve things. And don't forget to throw some stank face in there!"
bluesguitarist,351q3z,firagomusic,1 point,Wed May 6 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"I would work on playing the turnaround and incorporating some major pentatonic in there as well. Clapton mixes between both major and minor pentatonic all the time, and imo switching between the two tastefully is a great way to break away from sounding repetitive. I'd also work in chords, specifically dominant 7s. Knowing to play these all around the neck and in every position will prove to be very useful for outlining each chord in the progression either by arpeggiating or strumming. Also, not sure if you do this already but try and go out to any open blues night jams in your area as much as possible. Surrounding yourself with other players that are more experienced will push you to improve more and more. I just started playing out a few months ago and wish I would of started a lot younger. Keep it up!"

Truefire has some excellent video courses as well, for a $15 a month subscription you can definitely get your moneys worth."
bluesguitarist,34whyy,Nappyheadedbro,2,Tue May 5 03:19:15 2015 UTC,"% D  Holy shit! That was the fastest turnaround on a jam ever!  Great take man -- fantastic tone, snappy licks right in the pocket. All killer, no filler! Sounded a lot like Albert Collins at times."
bluesguitarist,34whyy,bluesnoodler_,2,Tue May 5 03:38:56 2015 UTC,Thanks dude! I took your advice about the finger style man.
bluesguitarist,34whyy,johnkdevnull,2,Tue May 5 03:46:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, week 22 already.  Nice take.  I really like the staccato style."
bluesguitarist,34tskk,Nappyheadedbro,4,Mon May 4 14:32:47 2015 UTC,Okay here is our first track   It's another one from www.bluesblast.com. It's called Uptempo Shuffle in A. Here's the link: https://soundcloud.com/bluesnoodler/uptempo-shuffle-in-a-back-track-for-rbluesguitarist-jam-22

bluesguitarist,34szgb,BillFuckingEvans,1 point,Mon May 4 16:07:38 2015 UTC,"Cheers, mate! It all started from a post on here about a Rev Gary Davis song.  Thanks for posting your version - I've been playing Clapton's Outside Women on the acoustic for a while, and really wanted to tab out one of his songs. It's not really finger style though, all those Hendrix chords! But then your version came along and bingo! I like the space you get in yours, it makes the melodies really stand out."
bluesguitarist,34szgb,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon May 4 16:15:20 2015 UTC,Check out /u/BillFuckingEvans and his awesome version posted here last week.
bluesguitarist,34s6od,TheELITEJoeFlacco,5,Mon May 4 02:39:39 2015 UTC,Not even in my wildest dreams I think I'd be able to play this and sing at the same time
bluesguitarist,34s6od,pandaslasher,3,Mon May 4 07:03:25 2015 UTC,"It's difficult for sure, but totally do-able! Took me quite a while, but I took it literally two Lines at a time until I could do a verse... Then worked the chorus"
bluesguitarist,34s6od,drdmento,1 point,Mon May 4 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"I've only just started playing (2 weeks) and have fallen in love with blues. I play 2-3 hours a day. How long do you reckon it would take me to get this down? Probably hard to answer.  Lets say a good player (2years) starts to learn this from scratch, how long would it take him?"
bluesguitarist,34s6od,clearvanity,-1,Sun May 24 01:23:48 2015 UTC,"With only two weeks of playing I'd say you have while to go before you can play this song. You need to learn the shapes of the chords he's playing, how to do slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, bends, and there are some barres in there as well. On top of that, you have to play with the correct rhythm. Not entirely simple for a beginner.  Try learning some of the concepts I pointed out and once you feel comfortable with them, put the song on your 'to do' list."
bluesguitarist,34s6od,worskies,5,Fri Jun 19 01:15:45 2015 UTC,Damn that's a sweet number! I must admit that I am not very well acquainted with Mayer's material. This sort of reenforces my theory that he is a lot like Clapton -- insanely talented blues player savvy enough to write killer pop tunes to make $.
bluesguitarist,34s6od,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon May 4 14:09:36 2015 UTC,You should become more acquainted then haha.
bluesguitarist,34s6od,ballinthrowaway,-4,Mon May 4 23:26:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I thought this was a video of John Mayer not Jack White  EDIT: Owf. Relax guys. It was a joke."
bluesguitarist,34s6od,LukeNukem93,2,Mon May 4 04:39:20 2015 UTC,I gotta admit that the hat had me thinking the same thing for a second.
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,Dubstantial,3,Sun May 3 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"Saw him a few times in the 80s and it was always an awesome show. Hopin' he's okay. 89 years old, diabetic and had a heart attack. The man doesn't owe any of us a damn thing at this point."
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,bluesnoodler_,3,Sun May 3 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"Only saw him twice, 2012 and 2013. By 2013 he was clearly unwell. Both times, however, the TONE on that guitar....left chills. Amazing. I recommend his autobiography, if you like the guy. Sort of light, but a fun read."
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,stonesman,3,Mon May 4 02:44:29 2015 UTC,Thrill Is Gone was one of the first songs my guitar teacher had me learn.
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,beneater66,3,Mon May 4 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna post what I did in the other recent BB thread.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kog1OeEG0fU  Blues Is King, is probably the best electric blues record of all time. If you haven't heard it, do yourself a favour. Absolutely outstanding album."
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,JilaX,3,Mon May 4 06:42:23 2015 UTC,"I finally listened to the whole thing, and I gotta say that it is in fact even better than Live at the Regal -- the only thing for me is that Live at the Regal is the one I learned to love as a kid, so it has that life long resonance. Which is great for me, 'cause I get to fall in love with this one fresh!"
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,bluesnoodler_,3,Mon May 4 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"It really is... Just an absolutely unbelievable performance.   He really was struggling at the time, though. Blues had fallen out of fashion and he was struggling to sell records, fill joints the same way he did early on, etc. It's just so powerful..."
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,JilaX,3,Mon May 4 15:15:54 2015 UTC,It is. You can hear him digging in with 100% sincerity. That's about as blues as blues can be. Heart breaking and exhilarating at the same time.
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,bluesnoodler_,3,Mon May 4 15:23:19 2015 UTC,"The first time I really paid attention (I say this because I'm sure I'd heard him other times and didn't know or care) to BB King was on the 2004 Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD. He came out and did Rock Me Baby with Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, and Jimmie Vaughan. Let's just say I started listening to him a lot more after that..  I missed a chance to see him in Virginia with Buddy Guy a few years back, and am still kicking myself for it. I have managed to see Buddy twice, though."
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,zoidbergular,2,Mon May 4 16:20:09 2015 UTC,"I don't remember when exactly I first heard B.B., but I remember finding a copy of ""Live at the Reagal"" at my local record store and listening to it over and over and over again.  In my opinion B.B. is not just an amazing guitar player, but the best blues vocalist to have ever lived.  He can put more soul into one note than I can an entire song."
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,Ferrocile,3,Sun May 3 20:18:43 2015 UTC,Live at the regal is and always will be one of my favorite albums.
bluesguitarist,34qdzl,tallpapab,2,Mon May 4 04:23:55 2015 UTC,I think I got my first B.B. King record sometime around 1970. I've loved his music ever since. Never saw him live.

bluesguitarist,34posq,bluesnoodler_,6,Sun May 3 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"Now, that's some quality alliteration.   Toronto, eh? Dissapointed about the Raptors collapse, or relieved you don't have to listen to people hype them up any more?   From Lillehammer, Norway myself!."
bluesguitarist,34posq,JilaX,6,Sun May 3 13:22:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit relieved to be honest. They are a respectable team though. Going to a game is a lot of fun, compared to say watching the Leafs.  Looks like the Jays are gettin' ready to suck this year, so at least we have one decent team.  Norway gets held up as a positive example in arguments about natural resources in political forums here, due to managing them better and keeping a lot more of the profit."
bluesguitarist,34posq,JilaX,4,Sun May 3 13:28:19 2015 UTC,"I've gotta admit, it does seem like the crowd is usually extremely hyped at Raps games.   can't say I follow MLB (Or NFL for that matter) much. It does seem you guys have a failure streak going in all ends, though.   But, hey. At least you're not Cleveland!"
bluesguitarist,34posq,Nappyheadedbro,5,Sun May 3 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"Lol! Yes, a Raptors' game is a full on party every time.   To be honest I haven't been following sports in general that much in recent years. Toronto will beat that out of you eventually!"

bluesguitarist,34posq,JilaX,4,Sun May 3 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"Norway seems like a nice place to live, i am jealous."
bluesguitarist,34posq,JilaX,5,Sun May 3 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"It's pretty great. You lack certain parts of the cultural aspect the US has, though. And the fastfood places... We basically only have B.K and McD of the big chains. Which are the shittiest ones. I want Whattaburger / Jack in the Box, dammit."
bluesguitarist,34posq,tallpapab,3,Sun May 3 14:46:37 2015 UTC,Hey -- isn't Norway where Seasick Steve made it big originally? I am astonished at how a grizzled old dude playing 3 string boogie could get so huge with young people.
bluesguitarist,34posq,tallpapab,3,Sun May 3 14:21:49 2015 UTC,"It is! There's always been a pretty decent blues enviroment in Norway. Lots of really good guitar players. (Although in recent years, more and more have become terribly boring Stevie Ray-alikes.)   As for the whole 3 string boogie thing making it big, I think some credit is due with a certain Mr. Jack White. His Death Letter cover and the other similar (more minimalistic) blues tunes really helped pave the way for Blues that isn't the trio with guitar focus/solo focused quintet with Harp and Organ/Piano to reach further into the mainstream."
bluesguitarist,34posq,tallpapab,2,Sun May 3 14:54:26 2015 UTC,Edit: never listened to that before. Petty great!
bluesguitarist,34posq,Nappyheadedbro,5,Sun May 3 15:28:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I have been asked to provide a face to go with the words and the sounds, so if you haven't eaten recently, you can assuage your morbid curiosity:  Action shot  In repose  Feel free to print those up and hang them in the closet to scare vermin away!"
bluesguitarist,34posq,JilaX,3,Sun May 3 13:42:42 2015 UTC,Nice shots. The one in repose is cool. Is that a classical guitar? Are you flipping us off with both hands? ;)  No pics of my ancient gob will be forthcoming. The one of me on my SoundCloud account will have to do (taken sometime last century (millennium)).
bluesguitarist,34posq,Nappyheadedbro,4,Mon May 4 00:10:52 2015 UTC,That's a 1972 Yamaha red label FG-75 parlor sized. I am demonstrating the F octave at the 13th fret!

bluesguitarist,34posq,JilaX,6,Mon May 4 11:23:40 2015 UTC,"Old guy out here in Berkeley, California. This area (San Francisco Bay) is great for blues and all kinds of other music.  I've been known to take my resonator out on the streets to the amazement of Swedish tourists. It's a little surprising to find people who have never seen or heard a resonator. I have to explain it. It's also a chance to give little bits of blues and guitar tech history.  I also like jamming out on the front porch with my son who lives nearby. My wife is an accomplished singer with a couple small groups. They sing standards and jazz stuff mostly, but she also sings blues from time to time. Yes, we have performed together a few times.  So, we're living the good life ... at least until the drought, an earthquake, or a fire gets us.  If I might add, this sub has really been fun for me. Long may it live and prosper."

Everyone was making pyramid hats out of straws. I remember sitting there with my brother and the old man with these stupid fucking pyramid hats on our heads, watching the Leafs shit the bed yet again, and that was it man! : P  Oh wait! -- It was Red Kelly who was into the pyramid thing.  The last time they won the cup, I was 1 year old."

bluesguitarist,34posq,tallpapab,5,Sun May 3 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"I'm from Lake Stevens Washington which is about a thirty minute drive from Seattle depending on traffic. I avoid the place as often as possible, but that's just because I prefer more open areas.   The lady does wildlife rehab which is far more interesting than anything I do really. Check out this  barred owl we let go about a month ago.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbHL4DPvUE8&feature=youtu.be  And this is /r/wildliferehab that she started awhile ago if anyone is interested."
bluesguitarist,34posq,johnkdevnull,3,Sun May 3 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"As a foreigner, Seattle has always seemed like a pretty cool city. That might just be my predilection for Grunge blinding me... I guess if you prefer Rural areas, any city is something you'd like to avoid?    The lady does wildlife rehab which is far more interesting than anything I do really.   Don't sell your short, now!   That is pretty cool though, I must admit."
bluesguitarist,34posq,Nappyheadedbro,5,Sun May 3 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"I love the nature here. We have a lot of forested areas and there are incredible mountains, I do get to see those quite a bit. I think that's where the real value is here. As far as cities like Seattle go, I think I get sensory overload or something. The city itself is a wonder and I don't have any actual bias against it, I just wasn't built to be compatible with city life.  I haven't even been to the EMP which contains this beast built by Paul Allen, savior of the Seattle Seahawks:  http://www.empmuseum.org/at-the-museum/museum-features/if-vi-was-ix.aspx  I could be there in an hour or so, I just don't have it in me. There are people everywhere and the real culture of it all is you're in a massive shopping mall that rains a lot.  Just being there for a few hours compels me to be one of those guys that lives in the woods and hunts rabbits and robs camp sights for a living. I still haven't decided that isn't my true calling in life.  Weed is legal and really cheap now so long as you aren't in a shop. Meat is pretty cheap compared to a lot of places in the world. Canadians sneak down here all the time to save on groceries. That alone might make the visit worthwhile."
bluesguitarist,34posq,johnkdevnull,5,Sun May 3 15:47:38 2015 UTC,": D  Yep, that is just awesome!"
bluesguitarist,34posq,tallpapab,4,Sun May 3 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"I was at this blues night 3 days ago... This usually never happens because blues is not very liked here in my country (and area).  It was an artist from Austin, Texas, Birdlegg... Damn he was so nice! Talking to everyone, thanking people for coming, really putting on a show. And his harmonica play together with the guitarist was so spot on.  Damn... I would be happy if there was more blues concerts around!"
bluesguitarist,34posq,johnkdevnull,4,Sun May 3 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"Austin, Texas, Birdlegg   Found 'em!  You didn't mention where you are, just that blues is not very liked there -- ?"
bluesguitarist,34posq,johnkdevnull,5,Sun May 3 16:35:21 2015 UTC,Yeah! Those where the guys... But it was crowded and everyone was in a happy mode enjoying the show! (that youtube clip felt like they played for empty chairs/ears :( )  I'm in West/South West of Sweden. Blues is generarly regarded as music for 55-60 year old not-so-cool guys and not popular at all.
bluesguitarist,34posq,readinghistory,4,Sun May 3 16:42:29 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that but happy to hear that there's enough of a market for a band to come from Texas to play!

bluesguitarist,34posq,danihendrix,3,Mon May 4 19:42:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. Caught Birdlegg at a street blues fest out here in Oakland a few years ago. The streets are a great place for blues.

bluesguitarist,34l5pm,Duco232,2,Sat May 2 08:56:54 2015 UTC,"Fantastic album.   For me it only comes second to one other B.B Album, ""Blues Is King"". In my mind it's just the best electric blues album of all time. I remember hunting down that CD when I was like 17, and just being absolutely floored. He made that when absolutely everything in his life was going straight to hell, his career, his relationships, everything. It was just rock bottom for him as an artist. And it just shines through, so well.   Check it out."

bluesguitarist,34c633,Seth39195,6,Wed Apr 29 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"Quick run down of the blues:  Blues has been around for nearly 100 years and it's developed many different styles and forms along the way. After the emancipation of slavery in the US, black musicians started creating forms of music by combining African style rhythms and melodies with traditional European instruments like violins, pianos and guitars. The first type of music that got popular enough to be played everywhere was called ragtime. It was a piano based form with highly syncopated rhythms.  In 1900, steel strings were invented, which made the guitar louder and also made the strings last a lot longer. They slowly started to become popular, and started making their way into the poorer rural areas of the country. They weren't loud enough to compete with a piano or a violin, so distinct guitar only music was created.  Different areas developed different styles collectively known as Country Blues, generally just a solo guitar or accompanied by a fiddle, harmonica or washboard The two best preserved early styles are:  Piedmont - named after the Piedmont region East of the Appalachians, Piedmont is pretty close to ragtime. It generally features really complex finger picking patterns with alternate basslines and uses a lot of chord changes. Piedmont guitarists: Blind Blake; Mississippi John Hurt;  Rev. Gary Davis; Blind Boy Fuller; Blind Willie McTell.  Delta: Named after the area between the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers, Delta blues focuses on emotion rather than complexity: it is a 'simpler', more primitive from, generally using one string basslines and one string melodies, often an entire song is played without changing chord. Slide guitar came out of the delta. Guitarists: Robert Johnson; Charley Patton; Son House; Bukka White; Ishmon Bracey; Tommy McLauchlin; Tomy Johnson; Robert Petway; Blind Willie Johnson..  Some guys didn't come from these regions so played slightly different styles: Blind Lemon Jefferson; John Lee Hooker; Lightnin' Hopkins.  In 1940, electric guitars started to appear, and the Great Migration saw country folk take their music to urban centres and new styles developed. Electric guitars made a guitar loud enough to be heard over drums and pianos, so the blues started to be played in band settings. The most popular style was:  Chicago - the band setting allowed the bass lines to be separated from the chords and melodies, and each started to become more complex and ornate. Early Chicago blues is simply electrified Delta blues played on more than one instrument. The biggest of these are Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf and Elmore James.  In the 50s, the Chicago sound started to get broadcast on the radio and started to be emulated and further developed by guys not in Chicago and was originally called R&B - the three Kings, Albert, Freddie and B.B. and Buddy Guy are the main players.  In the early 60's, the electric blues were being heard around the world, and exploded into every other form of music. From the 60s to to now, the blues became the basis of rock music: Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, the White Stripes, the Black Keys are all non-traditional blues groups. I could write 5,000 words on the impact of Clapton alone on music -he quit his first big band on the day it hit the big time because they started to play more pop than blues. I could write 50,000 on Hendrix. These later guys are all pure blues players or bands and all impacted music in big ways. There's just too many of them that really had an impact to talk about any one in any detail. But Hendrix changed things as much as Muddy Waters did when he took Delta to Chicago. You have to listen to Hendrix.  I look at blues as a language more than anything else. At the start a few people could speak it, over time more and more people started to speak it, but they were from similar areas so it still sounded somewhat recognisable to the early guys. In the 60s it went global, and you had all these guys with completely different experiences from the early guys speaking it and adding to the language. Somewhere in there, you'll find guys who speak to you in ways you didn't even know existed."

The ideas he has going on there - the C and D double stops, the small chromatic phrases - just show you how good music doesn't have to be complicated, and how 2 notes out of a chord can say a hell of a lot more than a full chord. Less is more."

Otherwise if you have an iPad or iPhone there are lots of free apps you can use to record that uses amp and effect modeling such as garage band. Otherwise amplitube 3 and guitar rig are great PC interfaces.

It was a memory of an old 70's rock band song.  Deke Leonard - Iceberg.  I used to play it in a garageband in my youth.  There were also a few early Brian May licks in there and a Kossoff one too.  :-/

bluesguitarist,33t2n0,CharlieThunderthrust,6,Sat Apr 25 10:11:17 2015 UTC,"You're going to have a really hard time finding tabs for any live srv...especially a song like dirty pool because you aren't going to hear it on the radio very often.   My ear wasn't too great for a while so I feel ya (admittedly I'm still far from great at it) but mines been getting better. One of the ways that I was able to do it was by learning other songs that shared similar concepts to the ones that I actually want to learn. Srv uses a few basic tools in literally every song he plays. I dont have an amazing ear but after learning a few songs of his, I can listen to others and know exactly what he's doing without even picking up a guitar or watching a video when those licks come up. Then it's only a matter of figuring out a few always wonky chord shapes (usually through vids) and a few new fills that I can then apply in the same way to the next song, without the video hopefully. I started with this guys lessons a while ago and I think they're great - crazy detailed and very accurate (also super long...)   https://guitarlessons365.com/stevie-ray-vaughan-texas-flood-video-guitar-lessons/  Probably not the answer you were looking for but I hope it helps. Video lesson might be a good way to dip your toe in to eventually learn the song you truly want to play   Edit: I just listened to the song a little more closely again. Most if not all of the beginning licks are slight variations from the video above for tx flood. Several of the chords are from riviera paradise as well, just moved up or down the neck but same shape. Both of which have a plethora of tabs and video lessons available"

bluesguitarist,33rbni,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:48:08 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's a Dunlap 222 brass slide. (Luckily the label is still in the slide or I wouldn't know who made it.) I like the brass slide on the resonator because it bites just a bit for that tangy sound. I use a ceramic slide on my solid body electric / resonator hybrid for a smoother sound that's a little easier to control.

Figure out each note one at a time by matching it on your guitar. It's tedious and requires patience, but yeah that's how you can figure stuff out. Your dad's pretty good by the way, impressive!  On a side note - I like your dad's glasses, do you know where he got those frames?"
bluesguitarist,33qp7d,jontarist,2,Sun Apr 26 17:25:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you, my friend. I'll send him the good vibes :) I heeded your advice (and his) and sat down to listen a ton. Slowed the track to half speed and it turns out it's MUCH easier than I thought. Just some Pentatonic wanking. As far as the glasses, I'm FAIRLY certain they're Ray Bans!"
bluesguitarist,33qp7d,jontarist,2,Sun Apr 26 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Yes...never underestimate the importance of your ear. Using your ears is what music's all about! Pentatonic wanking... yeah that's a good way to describe it. I know scales by feel, but asking me to describe it in any helpful way is pretty much a hopeless cause lol, I think a lot of guitarists are that way.   Yeah it's helpful to slow the track down. Patience is key when figuring stuff out by ear, and anyone can get better at it with practice.  Ray Bans huh? Yeah I thought they looked expensive. They look pretty cool though, I'll keep it in mind when I go glasses shopping. Thanks!"
bluesguitarist,33qp7d,warriorsoulman,4,Sun Apr 26 21:18:01 2015 UTC,"Your Dad taught everything YOU know...not everything HE knows. First of all, I've been telling for half your life that there's only one way to learn how I play, which is playing VOCAL lines on your guitar... Just songs that you're familiar enough with to navigate through like I did with My Guitar Gently Weeps ( https://youtu.be/uGCUo2VeUjg )... And second, I've also ALWAYS told you to forget the pentatonic scale when you're playing blues... If course it's in there, but you MUST USE MAJOR AND MINOR 3rds, Minor 7th arpeggios, anything that is NOT a collection of basic blues riffs stung together... You can say more with the same four notes played over and over again than you can from a flurry of show-off runs. I was teaching Jack this earlier... https://youtu.be/bBKs5zZO3NU ...Love you, kid.

bluesguitarist,33mir5,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Recording and composition of article  Dust My Broom:       ""I Believe I'll Dust My Broom"" was recorded by Johnson during his first recording session on November 23, 1936. The recording took place in a makeshift studio in Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, and was produced by Art Satherley and Don Law.  It was the second song that Johnson recorded and followed ""Kind Hearted Woman Blues"". As with most of his recordings, it appears that a second take of the song was recorded and assigned a reference number.  Stephen LaVere, who manages Johnson's recording legacy, notes that this take, along with several others, ""remain[s] unfound, if ever issued; destroyed after being recorded (if ever); or otherwise unknown to collectors"".

I just tabbed it out yesterday after learning it yesterday, so my timing isn't perfect, but it's close enough so that with the tab, you should be able to figure it out.

bluesguitarist,33bxys,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"It sounded pretty cool from what I could hear. I could say to maybe try to end phrases on chord tones to anchor your licks to the harmony. Also, if it's a toss up between finishing a run and staying in the pocket, then I would opine that it is more important to stay in the pocket. Some double stops and slides/legato will add more texture. I realize that you were playing acoustic and I couldn't really hear it, so that's about it. And I had to dig to find anything. I really enjoyed it and hope to hear some more!"
bluesguitarist,33bxys,bluesnoodler_,2,Tue Apr 21 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I'm flattered that you said that you really had to dig. I'm still messing up on slides very easily, so I'm not yet confident in using them a lot. I'm also not sure when it's appropriate to add them.  Also, I'm still educating myself with basic music theory, so can you please explain what you mean by ending on chord tones, or do you know other resources where I can read about them? Thank you for the input."

bluesguitarist,33b1jp,Alfordt,3,Tue Apr 21 01:45:35 2015 UTC,"Learn the language first, then develop your own style. It's important that your playing has a good grounding in the history of the blues IMO. Listen to the greats and soak in their styles. After a while you will start sounding like your self. It's just a natural progression.   Focus on phrasing and purpose in your playing - don't just riff, have a purpose with what you play"
bluesguitarist,33b1jp,wellywoodfats,2,Tue Apr 21 02:49:55 2015 UTC,"Additional question: in response to people suggesting to ""learn the language"", can anyone recommend some free online resources for that?"
bluesguitarist,33b1jp,yamsx1,3,Tue Apr 21 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"You are presently posting on a free online resource jam packed with links to free online resources!   When I say ""learn the language"" what I am saying essentially is to listen to lots of blues -- familiarize yourself with the various styles.  So, though jamming along to jam tracks is a great way to hone your skills, it is also necessary to learn from the masters, and that means learning some classic licks.  So if you are interested in improving your blues soloing, here are a few resources I have amassed here that hopefully help! This first batch is concerned with the scales and a bit of theory behind blues soloing:   This lesson is probably the single best explanation of basic blues soloing mechanics I have come across so far: https://youtu.be/DKe5jX-5pII Here are 2 really good lessons on learning how to mix the major and minor pentatonic scales, which is the crux of the tonality: Lesson 1 Lesson 2 Here is another great lesson on that topic: http://youtu.be/CvQRpwLa_SI   This next batch of lessons is about learning some licks to add to your vocabulary:  * This is what you find here if you search this sub for the word ""lick"".  You are bound to find something useful among those lessons!  I created this sub specifically for people like you who want to play the blues. To that end I have spent a lot of time amassing free learning resources for you to avail yourself of. We are also here to try and answer questions and offer advice, etc.  The truth about blues improv is that when you hear a blues player improvising, they are drawing both on licks they learned from others and licks that they invented just noodling on their own. This stuff gets mixed together and rephrased in your subconscious and becomes your ""vocabulary"".  If you want to get more sophisticated about it, you can also utilize arpeggios, the Mixolydian and Dorian modes, diminished runs, etc. I have gone to great lengths to put all of this information at your fingertips in a searchable subreddit -- all you need to do is actually search it, because that is exactly what I did to answer your question!"
bluesguitarist,33b1jp,bluesnoodler_,3,Tue Apr 21 17:09:55 2015 UTC,Great post. Thank you
bluesguitarist,33b1jp,yamsx1,3,Tue Apr 21 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"It really is just about listening to a bunch of blues and soaking it in. Some of my favourite albums for blues guitar are:   Girls Go Wild by The Fabulous Thunderbirds What's The Word by The Fabulous Thunderbirds Freddie King Sings by Freddie King Live At The Regal by B.B King Albert King - Live in San Fransisco Wednesday Night (get Thursday night too) Hideaway and Dance away - Freddie King Anson Funderburgh & The Rockets - Talk To You By Hand Truckin' With Albert Collins - Albert collins B.B King The Vintage Years (4 disc box set) West Side Soul by Magic Sam This Is Buddy Guy by Buddy Guy Junior Wells - Hooodoo man blues (featuring Buddy Guy)   This is but a drop in the well, and focuses heavily on electric guitar blues. But it's a great start... Listen to these, learn your pentatonic shapes, and try listening to their solos. USE YOUR EARS. it is SO valuable to develop your ears so you can learn stuff without the need for tab or a middle man. Blues really is easy to pick up by ear once you get into it"

bluesguitarist,33b8hm,bluesnoodler_,3,Wed Apr 22 12:08:59 2015 UTC,The Fabulous Thunderbirds were already in heavy rotation for me when Stevie came out of nowhere. I dig Jimmie. I dig Anson Funderburgh for that same style. And Duke Robillard. All killer no filler.

bluesguitarist,338mik,conchoso,3,Mon Apr 20 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"Nice job, as always, with the presentation on this.  You've definitely developed one of the most highly recommendable blues guitar sites that I've seen.  This will be my first time trying one of his tunes, I've never really been exposed to him before, but will start working on it later today.  Any idea if he used a thumb pick or a bare thumb?  And I saw it mentioned a couple times in the notes to pluck with the pinky.  Is that typical for him to pick with all four fingers?"

bluesguitarist,337cjv,danihendrix,3,Mon Apr 20 05:21:59 2015 UTC,"Hey man and welcome! Thanks for uploading and sharing :)   My feedback : I think the backing should be a touch louder, if you are planning on doing jams etc a fuller sound will be achieved with a better balance between lead and backing. I like the sound of your guitar, the drive gives it some good sustain I can hear and you have some nice licks. One thing I noticed there is that I think the backing is too slow for what you wanted to play. I could hear you physically slowing yourself down a couple times. Try the same things you were doing over a slightly faster backing and I think they will fit great.   It sounds as if you are recording live, if that's the case you may need to mess around with whatever is doing the recording in terms of position from guitar and backing until you find the sweetspot. Thanks again and good job, look forward to more"

bluesguitarist,32u6ue,beatlemaniac5,2,Thu Apr 16 21:10:50 2015 UTC,This looks amazing! I think the next step for me is building one :) Thanks.   The problem I have with my Tele is that the pickups were change for really high gain pickups. I can play metal with it. That's another reason I don't think comfortable with it anymore.
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,JilaX,3,Fri Apr 17 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"P90s are absolutely amazing for Blues. However, the ones that come standard on those Melody Maker's might be a bit hot (too gainy) for some tastes. It all comes down to the player though.   What amp are you using? A good Tube amp can make just as much difference as a new guitar can."
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,carmour,2,Thu Apr 16 23:52:33 2015 UTC,Haven't seen you in a while Jilax :P  P90s are great as long as you get the right ones. Some of the more modern ones just don't sound that great frankly.

bluesguitarist,32u6ue,JilaX,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your feedback! It's very interesting. As said earlier, my Tele has been heavily modified with high gain pickups to suit the style I used to play before I met the blues. I don't want hot pickups anymore even if I bet these P90s are not hotter than mine :)  I used a Marshall Valvestate amp. I just bought a Fender Blues Deluxe Reissue in a pawn shop. I didn't have time to test it out fully."
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,bluesnoodler_,2,Fri Apr 17 06:21:34 2015 UTC,"That Blues Delux Reissue is absolutely fantastic. I played one once at at a blue festival and it's absolutely killer!   My advice is just gonna be to go test out the guitar and see if you like it, at this point."
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,5trych9,2,Fri Apr 17 08:26:20 2015 UTC,"I found it for approx. $250. Here in Serbia, it is almost impossible to get this kind of gear yet someone sold it to this pawn shop. When I saw it I knew it was waiting for me.   Thanks for the advice, I will try to test out the guitar too if the seller allows."
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,Squidmaker,2,Fri Apr 17 09:30:10 2015 UTC,Hey man -- P90s are great for playing blues!   Here's an example of their wide open single coil sound: https://youtu.be/_4mMYqr__K0  and here's another: https://youtu.be/ZQHTGWMkeV0

bluesguitarist,32u6ue,carmour,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:39:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what the blues is if your looking for a different guitar to ""make good blues"". Blues music is something you feel, not imitate. Doesn't matter what the hell kind of guitar you're playing.   That being said, your tele is more than capable of producing great tones for the blues. If you need a ""change of scenery"", try changing the pickguard and knob colors, or paint the thing. Make it truly yours"
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,bluesnoodler_,3,Thu Apr 16 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is a common misconception. Blues like anything, has to be learned first by imitation.   He wants a different guitar because his current one holds connotations of punk rock in his mind and it doesn't feel right. He understands this is not a logical feeling but it is a feeling just the same.   I do agree it doesn't really matter what type of guitar you play. I play blues on a tele."
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,carmour,2,Fri Apr 17 04:17:21 2015 UTC,This is very interesting! I don't have any education in music and nowadays I feel that I need some instructions to play the blues. That's why I am more than happy to have found this subreddit because nobody is into blues in my area. People I know don't listen to blues. Nobody can help me besides all of you.  I met the blues when I searched for some old vinyls in my father's collection and found Skip James' 1931 recordings. Everything started there. I can safely say that this moment has changed something forever.  It's been two years I play and I feel that I am really learning how to play just now.
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,bluesnoodler_,2,Fri Apr 17 06:14:54 2015 UTC,"Listen to Jimi Hendrix, SRV, Rory Gallagher even John Mayer Trio.   I guess I'm a big advocate of not imitating certain artists, because then you tend to just copy their licks with certain variants. Start in a Maj. Pentatonic scale in the key of E and just fuck around. Listen to all these blues artists and mesh styles together to find your own sound"
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,carmour,2,Fri Apr 17 12:35:41 2015 UTC,I would contend that blues is a language and a tradition. Every single guy you mentioned spent many hours copying licks from the masters. They each then mixed and matched that vocabulary and made it their own. SRV played Albert King licks unadorned all the time and he would tell you that is what he was doing. You build your lick vocabulary by copping them from music you dig and by making up your own.
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,bluesnoodler_,2,Fri Apr 17 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"Why would you listen to blues rock and blues-pop artists if you want to learn blues? He's already at skip james. He should just mine the depths of that era. Go straight to the source and learn from the originators, not the guys who have watered down everyone who came before them.   Everyone starts with imitation, it's how we learn as humans. No one is original from day one. I've been playing and studying the blues for the better part of 10 years, imitation is the best way to start. Once you learn the language you use it to say what you want. But if you don't learn the language and just 'fuck around' then you have no basis of knowledge or grounding in the genre."
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,Squidmaker,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean by not imitating certain artists. Moreover those you mention had strong personalities. Imitating them can just ruin the blues you'd play.   Blues is really new to me. It's a new adventure. I guess I'll fall in some traps and avoid certain others. In the end, I feel comitted to play it with passion. I guess when passion is involved you cannot really fail. As for my own sound, I think it will take a lifetime to express things I have inside of me in my own blues. Lucky me, I am not in a hurry. I love to fuck around with my axe :)  Thank you very much for your comments."
bluesguitarist,32u6ue,carmour,3,Fri Apr 17 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"Blues is also a language and a tradition. It is my opinion that you must learn from the masters, and that includes copping as many licks as possible from them. Hendrix learned the blues as a sideman to bluesmen early in his career. SRV copied his licks from Albert King, Hubert Sumlin, Otis Rush etc. Same thing with John Mayer -- they are all ""imitating"" their influences. I can hear the licks they are playing and recognize the sources.  Listen to this Albert King and you can hear right away what SRV got from him: https://youtu.be/SyVhBfIFbiQ  You cannot play the blues unless you learn the language, and that means learning licks to add to your vocabulary.   Edit: I would also add that if all it took to play the blues was to ""fuck around"" in ""a Maj. Pentatonic scale"", then this sub wouldn't exist. I spent the last 2 years amassing learning materials so that people like you could come here and learn the blues!   Edit II: Still, there is also a lot of value in noodling around and coming up with your own licks, so do that too! While noodling, if you hear something cool, play it again a few times until it is internalized."
bluesguitarist,32q81f,Nappyheadedbro,5,Wed Apr 15 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"Part of me wants to dislike this because it's such a different shape than a ""normal"" guitar. But I love this. That blue and white looks amazing."

bluesguitarist,32l8fk,Nappyheadedbro,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"I use cheat sheets sometimes for specific keys sometimes, but I used to always need them. I was wondering if we could include a link in these threads to showcase what scales and modes are most commonly used from key to key, so a day one improv guitarist could play along. That makes sense right?  E is really easy because a lot of us have done it so many times, and is possibly the most accessible key for guitarists, if not it's tied with A and D."

bluesguitarist,32f7gu,Splin7ers,3,Mon Apr 13 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"Lol, no worries. I worked on it a while ago, had the thumb and chords worked out but just got a bit discouraged because it's a pretty difficult piece of music. After chatting with you I though I better get off my arse and finish it off, because it's a song I've always wanted to learn.  I'm nearly there, my thumb and chord changes are pretty good but the melodies are killing me. I try to always play the same bass lines the guys are playing, because it's the bass that gives the momentum and rhythm to the song. I work out what they do in the melodies, but when I play them I tend to do my own thing - a close approximation of the melodies rather than a note perfect  cover. There's always some phrases in a song that are so good you have to do it exactly like it is, but most of them you can improvise around the basic idea and create something that sounds pretty damn good. Add your own flavour to it.  But with this one...... The melodies add a second layer of rhythm and momentum that you absolutely have to nail or you end up with something that sounds like a bad cover. You really have to create that ""two instruments on one guitar"" feel to it. It's a genius piece of music, those opening slides in the interludes should sound discordant over the bass lines, but he makes it sound like another instrument has just come in to solo over the top."
bluesguitarist,32f7gu,Splin7ers,3,Tue Apr 14 06:56:14 2015 UTC,"I remember I told you I would love to learn this song when you asked for suggestions. Glad I gave you the idea to finish it lol.   I absolutely agree with you. Your analysis is great. And you are right, this feeling of two instruments on one guitar is absolutely necessary. You cannot really improvise. I learnt Seasick Steve's Hobo Low this week and threw some personal flavor in it. I was happy with the result but the song is simple and raw yet powerful. It calls for personal variations whereas Hurt's song is a pure diamond so the cover must be accurate.    I've started learning the song thanks to you and I must say that you once again did a very good job. I can easily understand the technical aspects I have so much trouble to reproduce. But I won't give up. Never. Blues saved my life and this song played an important part in that.   Big thanks again man."

Nothing really kicked in for me with this track.    What do people here usually do when the 'juices' don't flow?"
bluesguitarist,32d7ep,Nappyheadedbro,2,Sun Apr 12 20:33:49 2015 UTC,"I usually take a break, do something else and come back to it. The backing track on this one doesn't get my juices flowing so I'm sure the backing track is a factor when that happens."
bluesguitarist,32d7ep,bluesnoodler_,2,Sun Apr 12 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"I'll give that a go next time.  This time I tried slow, fast, excited, sad, clean, distorted, funky (which was a stretch), even tried slide which was terrible.  None really fitted.  So in the end I went for the clinically depressed sound, lol.  Usually I find it's the guitar tone that starts me off.  If I have a shit tone then it comes out shit.  This time it was the plodding tempo that killed it for me."

On the plus side to being stuck inside until the sun appears you have to be getting a ton of practice time in, and damn it shows. You're easily ten times better than I am as of now at this point in my life. I know a lot of of those licks, but it's the expression and different reactions that stands out. I love the way you kind of beat the shit out of one chord in a wicked bend(0:59), and then taper back like, "" Nah it's all good."" Not at all robotic or repetitive like I find my playing to be sometimes. Great job!"

bluesguitarist,324y8i,bluesnoodler_,2,Fri Apr 10 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand this. I understand the the notes in F Major can be played emphasizing the G making it G Dorian, but he doesn't mention this. He talks about playing F major ""a step down"" which makes sense. Then, when he starts playing he says ""Now we move up to F"" then to Dm. He puts up a URL late in the video, but Firefox gives me an error about HTTP 1.1 not being supported or something. Sounds pretty nice and jazzy though."
bluesguitarist,324y8i,tallpapab,2,Fri Apr 10 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"I just watched it again.  When he says he is playing ""a step down"" from G, he is simply finding the major scale where G is the second note, which is an easy way to find Dorian -- drop a whole step down from your root, thus making it the second note of the scale. G is the second note of F, which played over G harmony is Dorian in G.  When he moved up, he was simply playing F major/G Dorian further up the neck than where he started.   D minor is in fact F major, so pointless complexity added there."
bluesguitarist,324y8i,tallpapab,2,Fri Apr 10 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"But wait, since he's playing G Dorian (as opposed to F Major) he's emphasizing the G as tonic and playing with a chord progression in G. Since Dorian is ""minor"" (it has a minor third in it) then the relative would be Bb Lydian? I know, I should just shut up and play. The ""relative"" button on my fretboard page doesn't seem to be working. I thought I had it working before. Sigh."

bluesguitarist,31nid9,shaunsanders,10,Mon Apr 6 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"It's my site, but it's exactly what you want - http://www.52weeksofblues.com/.  Each week I work out a finger style blues song, tab them out and post them on Mondays (I went a day early this week because of Easter). I try to keep them in standard tunings, though there's some dropped D in there  Every song I've done - 19 so far - use the notes within the blues scale with an added major 6th for melody, and all of them use a blues scale with added major 6th and major 3rd for rhythm.  The blues scale is a pentatonic minor with an added flat 5th:  d|------------0-2 a|------0-1-2 e|-0--3   I suggest learning the blues scale, and the major scale, then look at how some of the masters used the interplay between the minor based blues scale and the major scale to create sounds that you like. Blues = ambiguity created from playing with the gaps between major and minor.  Also: learning the names of the notes on the fretboard isn't essential, but it just makes everything else so much easier. There's 12 notes, and they repeat. If you know the names of the strings that's 5 notes you already know, so there's only 7 to go. If you can tune the guitar you know that 5th fret E string = open A string, so 5th fret E string must be the A note. Use that a basis and it'll take a few hours max to work out the names of all the notes up to the 5th fret on every string. It'll take a week at most for the whole fret board based on the first 5 frets (1st fret A string = 6th fret E string, 1st fret D string = 6th fret A string = 11th fret E string) so just get it done. So many benefits,  and simply no down side."

bluesguitarist,31nid9,Meandmybuddyduncan,2,Mon Apr 6 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! This sounds great.  How do slides fit into it all? Is a slide just a way to accentuate blues songs, or is it its own monster that needs to be factored in while learning?"
bluesguitarist,31nid9,newaccount,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"It's a different skill that can be used to access different sounds. Slide playing uses the same theory, but the guitar is tuned to an open tuning - G, D and E are the most common. Ths means that playing all the strings on one fret makes a chord, so you can play slide on two or three strings and have it harmonise. There's been a few posts about slides - either use the search feature, or send /u/bluesnoodler_ a message. He has a gazillion resources and will point you in the right direction."
bluesguitarist,31nid9,tallpapab,2,Mon Apr 6 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"A slide can also be used in standard tuning (see Roy Rodgers, for example). A slide is also used with a guitar-like instrument called a lap-steel, and with some guitars (like Dobro) with square necks that are designed to be played laying across your lap.  There's a nice list of videos in the comments to a recent similar thread.  P.S. when used on a guitar the strings are usually a little heavier and the action set a little higher.  EDIT: In standard tuning"

I've met more than a few excellent guitarists that just don't touch the stuff. So you got that going for you.  Altered tunings are fabulous, and you shouldn't waste any time experimenting with a couple of them today that do not involve tuning the strings any higher than standard, for the moment anyways until you know your guitar is set up for it. I suggest DADGAD as great introduction point.  Because five of the strings are being lowered by a whole note, you need not worry of additional neck strain. I would not recommend an open tuning like open E major (EBEG#BE) for instance without prepping the right guitar first for the added tension.   Here is a pretty little Irish/Celtic tune called Morning Dew Here is the same tuning, now bluesier  That about describes what dadgad tuning can do. It's definitely a limited tuning compared to standard, but it's also the only way to make it sound exactly that way; it can't be done in standard quite like this, especially when you do try tinkering with slides. I posted the links because it's important to hear first, and then play. We've all been copying each other for a long, long time. Even the best musicians just rearrange chords and scales that existed long before they did.  Keep reading up on theory throughout your entire life as it isn't too much like riding a bike. It's really easy to confuse all the Greek-Modes. It's also important to not get too hung up on anything theory related beyond making yourself comfortable with chord and some scale voicings.   (How do you shut up a guitarist? Put sheet music in front of him.)  Plenty of guys don't know shit about theory beyond knowing what notes sound like, like Tommy Emmanuel."

I remember hearing him for the first time when I was in high school - and he's only 4 years older than I am. In my opinion, everything after Wander This World got way too mushy ""soft-rock-ish"" for my taste, though."

The kind of person who mutely clicks little arrows in this sub isn't likely to be forthcoming about why. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing, because their rationale is likely to be twice as idiotic as the act itself. There is also reddit ""fuzzing"" the numbers with an algorithm, which plays Hell with small subs and renders the entire concept of voting pointless. The numbers are never real, so I don't know why they bother having voting at all."

Covering them up is probably something an agent told him to do. 2 - it probably helps with the lights because, while we see it as indoors, he's looking at the god damn sun. I wrote a paper on him a year ago for a college course and watched a lot of interviews with him and he's always come off as sincere.  EDIT: I will say that I saw him at Radio City this past February and the show was not good. It was so loud that all of the sounds just blurred together into a muddy mix. At one point it just sounded like ""Wooobbbb, wooooobbb, woooobbb."" AC/DC was clearer than that when I saw them. Having it at Radio City made it even worse because he totally wasted the opportunity to use the natural acoustics."

bluesguitarist,30pxg2,attacktheradical,4,Sun Mar 29 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"I learned to play by listening and watching, and played by ear with minimal theory knowledge for decades. Then I learned a whack of theory. I soon realized that my ears had sorted a lot of things out already. Still, I now have to catch up on practical application, like internalizing inversions for at least major, minor, diminished and 7ths, minor scale modes, etc -- could keep you busy for a long time.  If you mix the minor and major pentatonic scales (plus the b5), you get the following 9 notes:  1 2 b3 3 4 b5 5 6 b7  The only note missing from the major scale there is the major 7th. So all the major scale modes are in there, etc. Blues mixes major and minor tonality, often in the same phrase, often over dominant chords. It defies western theory.  Modal flavors that you hear often in blues are Mixolydian (change with the chords!) and Dorian, and some diminished. But there is a lot more you can do over a dominant chord, and blues is often 3 dominant chords in a row.  Because I learned the blues by ear and played that way for so long, I'm not really thinking scales. Mostly I am accessing all the licks and phrases I internalized in an improvised flow. Where theory is coming in is knowing where I can slip in a diminished lick or subs while comping, things like that. So it is becoming more of a concern the more I see practical uses for it.  Edit: too many words"
bluesguitarist,30pxg2,bluesnoodler_,3,Sun Mar 29 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"I - in theory - know a fair bit of theory, but I've never known it well enough to apply it in real time. i.e. I can sit down and work out what the ""appropriate"" scale should be for a given chord, but in real time it never happens. But I've been playing a long time, and I realize that when I solo, especially for blues, I often will be using these scales anyway. I don't just stick to the blues pentatonic, although that's often the starting point, but I also play ""around"" the chords shapes. You'll often be using the correct scales that way, even if you don't know you are."
bluesguitarist,30pxg2,dummyguava,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:20:34 2015 UTC,Which scales do you use in addition to the pentatonic?
bluesguitarist,30pxg2,dummyguava,2,Sun Mar 29 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the thing. I don't really know, and it's not how I think when I solo. I guess you could say I start with the mixolydian and then add notes - in fact all notes can show up. It's more which notes are emphasized or resolved, which often ends up being a note in the chord or from the underlying melody.  I'm not advocating not knowing theory and scales - there are plenty of times I get caught short, and I really should get a handle on theory better."

I'll switch scales on chord changes. Sometimes to an arpeggio, fun with 7th chords. Sometimes switching between major and minor. I'll add other notes from the diatonic scale, particularly with a minor blues. I've worked a bit with Dorian mode, but I'm luke warm about it."

I like the stainless one a little better than the glass one. The harmonica was an experiment. It works, but only as a lap slide. Can't fit a finger in there. It's hard to switch from playing the harp to using it as a slide. The steel bar was given to my by a friend. I'd need to polish it more though. The differences between the others are pretty subtle. The thin glass one is lighter which is nice sometimes, but sometimes heavier is nicer. There's another thing I'd like to try. I'd like to take a metal (tube) slide and cut it in half at an angle so that it would fit between a couple knuckles. A local guy (Sam Wilson) does this."

bluesguitarist,30le0t,bluesnoodler_,2,Sat Mar 28 12:33:41 2015 UTC,"Kool! Nice sort of mix between Ride On and Jesus Just Left Chicago. Lots of great variations on the chromatic walk down/up, and delicious tones! Dig it!"

bluesguitarist,30hdz5,Mikethrillmas,6,Fri Mar 27 16:17:08 2015 UTC,"I used 2 acoustics. A Taylor dreadnought and a Recording King resonator. Both were recorded with a Rode nt1000 going into a Studio Projects preamp. There's very little processing on them, just a little compression on the acoustic guitar stereo sub. Both guitars were tuned to D minor. The electric is my 3 string cigarbox, fuzz is a Scott McKeon germanium fuzz. No edits were done. Thanks!"

bluesguitarist,30csly,greenstainedbrain,2,Thu Mar 26 09:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad to see all the Rory stuff here recently. Growing up in Ireland I somehow avoided him for years, despite my Dad being a big fan of his and there being a stack of vinyl in the house. It was only as I became competent on the guitar (and honestly with a bit of an inflated ego) that I was swatted back down watching his virtuosity on an acoustic guitar. In the 20 years since I've become a huge fan and of course studied his playing in depth. I even managed to learn Unmilitary Two-Step by ear with years of painful and staggered study of the piece."

bluesguitarist,305cwf,bluesnoodler_,3,Tue Mar 24 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"I love the unplugged set, life by the drop is one of my favorites due to its straight forwardness compared to a lot of his other super technical songs. He was just turning his life around, and everything was looking so bright.  What's really crazy about his untimely death is that the last seat on the helicopter was for his brother Jimmy Vaughn, and Stevie asked at the last minute if he could have it. Imagine living as Jimmy for awhile after that."
bluesguitarist,305cwf,bluesnoodler_,2,Tue Mar 24 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"Yeesh. I remember that day. I was working alone, minding a buddy's collectibles shop when they announced it on the radio. I put the ""Back in 5"" sign in the door and just sat there numb. I mean, it's not like I knew the guy personally, but it just bothered the Hell out of me, having made it through the 80s largely due to SRV.   Jimmy is great as well, but largely under appreciated due to little brother's massive success. The Fabulous Thunderbirds were already pretty popular before Stevie got big. But they were more of a retro concern, and Jimmy would never wear a kimono or play Jimi Hendrix -- he was a sharp suit, slicked back hair kind of bluesman, playing minimalist Texas style blues. So no real chance for crossover appeal, save that one tune (Tuff Enuff)."

Apparently it was absolutely dazzling how well he played like them.   Never found any clips of it, sadly."
bluesguitarist,305cwf,bluesnoodler_,2,Wed Mar 25 02:09:20 2015 UTC,"I know that he was in a band called The Chessmen with Bramhall Sr, then Texas Storm. They opened for Hendrix and the story goes Jimi broke Jimmy's wah, so he gave him his."

There was five bands I listened to exclusively in the 90's, and I just obsessed over them in the most unhealthy ways. They let me clock out of my McJob early when I squeaked that I wasn't feeling well and I was done with the dishes. I think not knowing him or seeing him perform live made it worse for me personally knowing I wouldn't make that rite of passage all long-haired stoners with black tee shirts were supposed to make.  The thing about guys like that is it's easy to assume they're immortal because they live like lions among men. I wasn't around when John Lennon died, but I don't think I know anyone that was around that couldn't tell you exactly where they were when they found out even though they probably don't remember what they had for breakfast."

bluesguitarist,303mhj,MN588770,3,Tue Mar 24 04:50:15 2015 UTC,"The main issue you are going to have is learning to play with your fingers. Get your thumb to do the E A and D, then fingers on the others. Most old guys only use their index finger, or maybe two, but it's really what comes comfortable to you.  Start with say a 12 bar in E, playing chords and hitting with your thumb on the beat and your fingers 'strumming' chords or picking out chord tones. When you get comfortable, add some blues scale licks on the treble strings. Thumb independence is the key to acoustic blues but it takes a while. You want to be able to keep a steady as a rock bass going and riff on top of it.  I've got a website - 52eeksofblues.com - just for fingerstyle acoustic. There's a bit of a mix, but maybe have a look at Saturday Blues by Ishmon Bracey. It's probably a good place to start to get your thumb working on auto pilot while concentrating on the melody."

bluesguitarist,303mhj,newaccount,2,Tue Mar 24 13:31:23 2015 UTC,I am new to the blues (electric and acoustic as well). I've discovered your site 10 days ago via this sub. Let me tell you I play 100 times better than before! My best friends asked me last weekend if I sold my soul to the devil because they couldn't believe how much I improved.  I would be extremely happy to learn Mississippi John Hurt's Richland Woman Blues...it's a very beautiful song.
bluesguitarist,303mhj,Splin7ers,2,Tue Mar 24 13:43:03 2015 UTC,"Lol, good to hear!  I've actually been working on Richland Woman for a while, but there a few spots I'm not quite getting. I started writing it up a month maybe 6 weeks ago, but moved on to easier things. It's an 8 bar in C F and G - it follows the same progression as Midnight Special albeit in a different key - but the note choice and execution is just on another level. I have a heap of trouble with the slidey/open string thing he does  - Last Kind Words does something similar and IMO it's an easier song to play. I can't even get that right!  But I'll finish it up and post it in the next few weeks - I've got Statesboro Blues and a guy called Maxwell Street Jimmy lined up for the next few weeks, so maybe 3 weeks?"
bluesguitarist,303mhj,newaccount,2,Tue Mar 24 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"Hah, I must say I was maybe not aware of what I was asking. I can feel that Richland Woman Blues is difficult but I don't know it by experience since I am a beginner. Well, I can't wait your version no matter when to see if I can play those tunes. Statesboro Blues is awesome too! Thanks a lot!"

bluesguitarist,303mhj,newaccount,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:59:33 2015 UTC,Oops - the picking hand! You play the bass 3 strings with your thumb and let your fingers pick the high strings - that way you can get your thumb bouncing between two bass notes to set the rhythm and leave your fingers free to make it interesting. Sorry to freak you out!
bluesguitarist,303mhj,newaccount,2,Tue Mar 24 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"Oh haha, that makes much more sense I actually already do this when finger picking on my Strat, so that's great. Can you suggest any artists I can get into?"
bluesguitarist,303mhj,Nappyheadedbro,2,Tue Mar 24 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit fan of Taj Mahal's acoustic stuff, but he's pretty good -that said they all kind of are! John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins. Someone like Ben Harper who is more folk than blues has some nice songs that are good to start finger picking with. Also I'm a big fan of Floyd's acoustic stuff - get a tab for 'Is There Anybody Out there?'. Not a blues rhythm, but really good finger picking song."

bluesguitarist,3007n3,GregSkinnard,2,Mon Mar 23 12:36:05 2015 UTC,Saw him open for Rush in 1983. He deserved much more exposure in the U.S.
bluesguitarist,3007n3,jedman,2,Mon Mar 23 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"""Kickback City"" is one of his meatiest riffs, in my opinion. But I love his version of, ""Goin' to My Hometown."""

bluesguitarist,3010gp,newaccount,3,Mon Mar 23 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"Story time: back in the early 2000's I was a bit off the rails - young, dumb and full of anger and whatever else I could get my hands on. Was massively into the most anti social and aggressive music I could find. I was driving one day, listening to a community radio station that would play the music commercial stations don't go near with a ten foot pole (3RRR for anyone in Melbourne) and this song came on. I drove straight to a record store and bought the album. Changed my life.   ITunes tells me the only band I've listened to more than Gillian Welch is Sonic Youth. She's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you get into this music it will touch you like not much else can. Enjoy!"
bluesguitarist,3010gp,Duco232,3,Mon Mar 23 16:56:05 2015 UTC,Man I love Gillian Welch. 'The way it will be' gets me every time...

bluesguitarist,2zqf30,johnkdevnull,11,Fri Mar 20 19:44:27 2015 UTC,"That's a pity.  All the posts I've read have been respectful and supportive of contributors.  I guess you must see the 'underbelly' as the admin.  I'd rather it was public, but don't take any shit because of that.  If it's giving you grief then you do what's necessary.  Nobody here wants you to get hassle from what you are doing.  Great job by the way!"
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,Bulkatron,2,Fri Mar 20 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you! -- I studied AutoModerator in depth last night, and have concocted a scheme that should make things easier to deal with into the future."
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,ddshroom,6,Sat Mar 21 12:42:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, this is my favorite sub on Reddit. I've been in love with blues music since scrolling through my dads records and finding Albert Collins, Buddy Guy and BB King among many others. My first show was Jimmy Thackery when I was 12 and I knew I was going to play blues guitar when he grabbed the beer bottle from my dad and started playing slide.  Lately, I've had to face the sad fact that Blues music in general, is on a decline. It's rare nowadays to find unique blues musicians and even more rare to find a blues show in my city. Try searching the 'Blues' section of iTunes and you'll find generic 'Chicago Blues' compilations or BB Kings 'Best of', but it's rare to find up and coming artists that captivate you like the legends did.  My point is this. This sub is a place that can spit out future blues musicians and promote blues music in a way that just isn't being done anymore. Who knows which 12 year old kid stumbles upon this sub, records along to the jam of the week and begins a journey with blues music that keeps the genre strong well into the future.  Most of Reddit is a wasteland and the popular this sub gets, the more that creeps in. In a way, it means that this sub is working and becoming increasingly more popular.   Thanks to the /Bluesnoodler_ for moderating and hopefully we can find a way to clean up the sub enough to keep it running, as I enjoy checking in every day."

bluesguitarist,2zqf30,RandomPrecision1,3,Fri Mar 20 20:06:33 2015 UTC,You my friend have nothing to apologize for! You always bring smiles with you! I figured out some cool tricks with AutoModerator last night that should help big time.
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,tallpapab,3,Sat Mar 21 12:45:18 2015 UTC,Good.
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,Splin7ers,6,Sat Mar 21 13:04:07 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there's a way to opt out of the trending subs thing.  That's how I found this sub,  so cool,  but there's really no faster way to destroy a good sub than by exposing it to the front page. Mainstream reddit is a wasteland."
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,stanleyfarnsworth,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, I have found that AutoModerator can help in a big way. Waded into it a bit last night and I believe the new setup should make things a lot more manageable."
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,stanleyfarnsworth,5,Sat Mar 21 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"I know if this would address the root issues, but have you considered hiding downvotes in the CSS?  A lot of subs that encourage users to post their stuff do that.  It doesn't prevent downvoting if someone disables the sub style, but it's at least like, a chicken-wire level level of walling it off."

Maybe I should stop inviting folks on /r/blues and /r/guitar to check us out? It would be a shame, though, if we pulled back too much into a shell."
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,MN588770,2,Fri Mar 20 20:13:57 2015 UTC,No worries my friend! Got some new angles that should make things a lot easier to handle. It would be foolish to cut the place off.
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,ballinthrowaway,4,Sat Mar 21 12:43:51 2015 UTC,"I am desperate dude! I just discovered this sub, a week ago and I've been lurking here since day 1. I've already learnt thanks to you some basics with the link you gave me at justinguitar.com and started to enjoy my first jam in the key of E. I am even planning on buying tomorrow a loop pedal to increase my little level of skills. This sub gives me strength man! Forget the haters and go on please..."

bluesguitarist,2zqf30,Nappyheadedbro,3,Sat Mar 21 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"The thing that really stung was seeing a couple of beginners post their jams, get down voted into the dirt and then delete their own entries. The other stuff comes into my inbox. I posted just about everything for a long time, so you can scroll back a few pages and start leaving nasty shit on any entry and it will end up in my inbox.  I have done a lot of pruning."
bluesguitarist,2zqf30,2fingers,3,Sat Mar 21 12:32:13 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Well it sounds like you've got a place that a lot of people love. It'd be a shame to let douchebags ruin it.

(Garageband - Preferences - Audio/Midi - Audio Input.  Audacity - Preferences - Devices)  In both these DAWs I set the Input to my POD and output to 'built-in' output.  I.e. speakers. Otherwise if either of these programs have been run while my POD was off then they revert to the system input (built-in mic). Maybe worth having a look at these DAW settings?"
bluesguitarist,2zenyg,johnkdevnull,1 point,Wed Mar 18 06:35:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for your help. I've been fussing with the setting of the input device in System Profile and in the DAWs, so far without success. Maybe there's a permutation that I missed."
bluesguitarist,2zenyg,johnkdevnull,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:31:26 2015 UTC,I think from my limited experience that the DAW and the system can have different Input settings and it is the DAW setting that is relevant.  So I'd look at the output settings of the firewire interface since that is what is left.  Since you seem to have the right DAW input settings and the right M-Audio Input settings.  Maybe show us a screenshot of the M-Audio Output tab?
bluesguitarist,2zenyg,johnkdevnull,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:35:51 2015 UTC,Thanks. Here is the output panel. I tried with the System Preferences set to built in and to 410 and neither worked even though the DAW was set to the 410. Maybe there is a hardware problem somewhere. Dunno.  P.S. I thought the output panel was referring to output from the computer through the interface to the jacks on the front panel e.g. headphones - as opposed to output from the interface to the computer.
bluesguitarist,2zenyg,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:07:22 2015 UTC,Can you get any sound via the headphone or speaker sockets on the m-audio?

bluesguitarist,2yrc1d,StarTrekMike,2,Thu Mar 12 04:16:29 2015 UTC,It was just a blues backing track under what he always does for the most part. It isn't exactly expressive. A whole lot of tension and atmosphere is built in the rest notes.

But I like the Speech Level Singing (SLS) approach most so if you can find a teacher who does that could be worth a try. Take everything with a grain of salt though, I don't think any single approach is golden. Be open to new ideas, i've watched a tonne of youtube videos and online lessons and found them extremely helpful but there isn't that feedback loop you get from a one on one session. Best of luck!"

Albert King is an electric player for one thing, so you aren't looking to learn 2 finger Piedmont style or ragtime or Delta.   If you dig Albert, you'll dig Stevie Ray Vaughan. You'll probably also dig BB King and Freddie King too. And Otis Rush. Put those artists into Spotify and you'll hear all kinds of similar artists.  Edit: also check out /r/blues and /r/bluesrock to sample lots of different blues."

bluesguitarist,2yhw7y,blarghusmaximus,2,Tue Mar 10 02:01:47 2015 UTC,Love it.  Some day there will be a truly viable glove that emulates long finger nails well. As of now we have those tip things normally associated with banjo and other bluegrass players that are pretty different than flamenco hands once you actually try them on.  I always wonder how these guys go about the non-guitar hours of life with these claws. I've been trying to grow them out like that since the 90's and it's immediately frustrating when I notice they make first contact when I touch something.
bluesguitarist,2yhw7y,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:23:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagine myself walking around with my picking hand held aloft like a surgeon, lest it be contaminated on my way across the operating theater. I knew a pro classical guy, and he shellacked his nails with some strengthening polish. Told me he had to learn to wipe his ass with his left hand to avoid scatastrophe."
bluesguitarist,2yhw7y,Mikethrillmas,2,Tue Mar 10 12:06:02 2015 UTC,"We should also invent a glove that emulates normal finger nails to go on top of this guys hand so he can wipe with confidence again. I'm kind of stuck on this invention idea at the moment. I mean if he can't wipe right anymore, what else has he quit doing?"
bluesguitarist,2yhw7y,Mikethrillmas,2,Tue Mar 10 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"I dunno, but he had a haunted look about him. How about a memory foam glove that can recall those lightnin' in a bottle licks that only emerge when you're thinking about something else like laundry or grocery lists?"
bluesguitarist,2yhw7y,Mikethrillmas,2,Tue Mar 10 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"I think that is when a musician accidentally gets a taste of what people capable of well-honed meditation do after a lot of training. I remember reading this awhile ago and wondering about the bottled lightning effect:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12661646   Dr Josipovic has found that some Buddhist monks and other experienced meditators have the ability to keep both neural networks active at the same time during meditation - that is to say, they have found a way to lift both sides of the seesaw simultaneously.   And that kind of ties into this:   Every time Steve Nash goes to the foul line, he shoots five or six free throws. Sure, there’s the two that really count, but the NBA’s all-time free throw percentage leader always takes several imaginary shots before getting the ball.  He says it helps him not only visualize the ball going through the net but also gets his brain and body prepped for the upcoming motor skill.  After almost 3,400 regular season attempts, his 90.4% success rate seems to work, even if Dwight Howard isn’t interested.   Different than the monk version of meditation where the mind is supposed to be cleared entirely, but still a practice of not letting your mind run around like the stray dog it wants to be.  I like the term lightning in a bottle, and if you really could take a hit whenever you wanted it, you might own the world. I practice guitar mentally a lot, but I'm not too sure how much it actually contributes to my progress."

bluesguitarist,2xlemw,bluesnoodler_,4,Sun Mar 1 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"Two pianos pieces are debated as being the basis of Mississippi blues: Frankie Carl's Sunset Serenade  Although that version was recorded in the 50's, the Glen Miller Orchestra recorded it in '39. I prefer this version, because it's played but the orchestra conducted by the guy who wrote the piece, so it's likely closer to his version of it.  The other is a boogie woogie from 31 by Charlie Spand Hard Time Blues.  My money is on the first piece, it's slower and has a bit more in common with Mississippi Blues."
bluesguitarist,2xlemw,newaccount,2,Mon Mar 2 11:29:22 2015 UTC,"Nice find here.  This looks like it will be one of those tunes that I'll have to start learning the same day I heard it for the first time.  In fact, I think I have heard a version of this before from Stefan Grossman:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91u_0PccY4c  but I didn't find his version nearly as inspiring (as usual) with him just talking and cracking some jokes over the music rather than singing.  So before I found your link here, I found two other tab versions that are also only ""mostly right"":  http://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/misc-mississippi-blues-tab-g-s348800  http://www.guitarcats.com/guitar-tabs/willie-brown/mississippi-blues  Of course none of these three tabs mention that he's playing with a capo on 3rd fret.  Also found these lessons which may help:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gpRhBO6S8  Also, it seems that this Willie Brown is not the same as this Willie Brown: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(musician)"
bluesguitarist,2xlemw,conchoso,2,Tue Mar 3 00:23:17 2015 UTC,"it seems that this Willie Brown is not the same as this Willie Brown   Do you know of Kid Bailey? He recorded in one day in 1929 and disappeared. He's meant to be the Robert Johnson Willie Brown, which is the Willie Brown in the link, but he doesn't sound like that Willie Brown!"
bluesguitarist,2xlemw,newaccount,2,Tue Mar 3 08:06:00 2015 UTC,There is a pretty good version replete with vocals from Rory Block:  http://youtu.be/Vgbh2N9AJlE  My older brother used to play a really swanky arrangement that had more parts than most I've heard. He didn't capo the neck and just played it in A. I learned the main riff and turnaround from him but have yet to tackle the boogie part.   Thanks or digging up those other tabs! Between 'em all we probably have the whole thing. Once I think I know it I'll contact my brother to see if he has anything to add.  Cheers
bluesguitarist,2xlemw,conchoso,2,Tue Mar 3 00:34:39 2015 UTC,"Found two more tabs, the first one is a pretty fancy version:  http://lanotepicking.wifeo.com/documents/mississippiblues.pdf  http://www.acousticfingerstyle.com/mcwill/misipbls.pdf  But again, as usual with these old pre-war blues classics, everyone is tabbing out their own version of the tune instead of what was actually recorded."
bluesguitarist,2xlemw,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:19:36 2015 UTC,I had no idea there were this many versions out there! Nice spelunking.
bluesguitarist,2xlemw,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"You're a really good guitarist if you did the stuff I heard on your soundcloud. You mentioned this was your grail in another post, is this tune really giving you trouble?"
bluesguitarist,2xlemw,Mikethrillmas,2,Mon Mar 2 01:17:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's me on my soundcloud! lol -- but that's a whole different skill set than this requires. You are mapping out a steady 12/8 alternating bass line with your thumb while finger picking some pretty damn fancy shit on top. It is considered as they say in the lesson the ""graduating"" tune for learning Delta style finger picking.  Here is the great Stefan Grossman valiantly playing a halting arrangement of it: http://youtu.be/91u_0PccY4c  Here is Rory Block actually pulling off the vocals over what appears to be an abbreviated version: http://youtu.be/Vgbh2N9AJlE  Did you listen to the original? The guy is essentially playing piano on the guitar. Maybe it sounds easier than it is."

I'm not sure if it's 10 or 15 watts, but it is a howling little amp with a tone comparable to a high-end fender amp.  My Friend puts an orange tiny terror through a cabinet and that really knocked my socks off. Sounds good with anything."
bluesguitarist,2xlwvq,Mikethrillmas,2,Mon Mar 2 03:37:00 2015 UTC,"Even a 5w champ gets loud.  A modeling amp gets you95% of the sound with some different amps, effects, distortion, tuner, line out, headphones, MP3 input...  Go listen to a few different ones and see what you like.

The 1x12 cab is beautiful too, tons of bass. This little 5 watter is loud. I haven't played it outside of my living room yet but all the neighbors know when I'm throwing down."

I liked what I heard and you got talent bro! Keep rippin'!!!!!
bluesguitarist,2wx8ih,Nappyheadedbro,3,Tue Feb 24 02:58:52 2015 UTC,Been stuck in a rut with my blues playing and any feedback on how to improve would be appreciated
bluesguitarist,2wx8ih,hackalama,5,Mon Feb 23 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"Just off the cuff, I'd recommend more vibrato and sustain on some of those notes. It would add a lot more character... Also, vibrato is a great way to pause and think about what you want to do next without making it sound lime you're pausing."
bluesguitarist,2wx8ih,johnkdevnull,3,Mon Feb 23 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"Hi, You have the old EC Les Paul tone there.  Very nice.  I would suggest practising your bends, making sure they come up to the note.  If you have difficulty with that then you could always try a lighter gauge of strings.  Another way to breathe more life into it is to practice your vibrato,  That really sweetens the notes as they ring out.  Try listening to Paul Kossoff (Free) or the master - BB King.  On the plus side you have very good timing and some excellent licks."
bluesguitarist,2wx8ih,bluesnoodler_,3,Mon Feb 23 23:01:28 2015 UTC,Sounds good man!  You're feeling stale?  First thing I'd suggest is working on bending to pitch and applying vibrato.  Here's a good lesson on string bending: http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Deep_Blues_Bending_%E2%80%93_Essential_Techniques_for_Blues_Soloing  Here's a vibrato lesson: http://youtu.be/FgP9Qy9BBks  And this lesson will really up your game.

bluesguitarist,2wxen6,johnkdevnull,3,Mon Feb 23 23:32:03 2015 UTC,Damn this is really great!  That tone is something else it reminds me of early Clapton. What pickups do you use?  Fantastic playing as well.
bluesguitarist,2wxen6,HotRats92,2,Mon Feb 23 23:47:47 2015 UTC,Thanks very much.  This is a US Deluxe fatstrat.  It has the noiseless neck and middle single coils but I think in this case I was playing through the stock bridge humbucker. It's an ok humbucker but I attribute my tones mainly to my Pod XT.  Always been a Line 6 fan.

I just know your voice now, in much the same way I could probably recognize tallpapab or danihendrix or some of the other regulars here. Just as I could recognize most of the famous blues players within a couple of bars. The one guy I'm sick to death of hearing is me! lol"
bluesguitarist,2wwozm,HotRats92,2,Mon Feb 23 20:24:52 2015 UTC,Only just checked this sub out and I'm liking it a lot! I loved the /r/guitar jams so it's great to see them being carried on over here.  I'm using a partscaster strat which has a classic player 60s body with cs69 pickups and a 50s style mexican neck.  I'ts plugged into a yamaha thr-10 amp on the brit-hi channel and then I'm recording into reaper with a usb cable.
bluesguitarist,2wwozm,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon Feb 23 20:26:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, that was epic! :D  Nice to see you here - welcome!  Great tone and lots of killer playing there. You really found the pocket and tucked right in there a few times with those rapid fire licks! Dig the fact that you tried all kinds of interesting stuff - octaves, modal flourishes, etc. It's a looong track and you kept it interesting throughout.   Your chops have grown exponentially since you were doing Zappa covers a while back! You're a fuckin' beast!"
bluesguitarist,2wwozm,johnkdevnull,2,Mon Feb 23 22:30:20 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I've been focusing mainly on Hendrix for a long time now. It started when I realised my rhythm playing was really lacking and I worked on Hendrix style chords and fills and then I started trying to learn his lead playing. I do still love Zappa of course.  You're doing an awesome job with this subreddit! It's really cool to have a place just for blues.

Or try playing pentatonic major of each chord a bit to outline the changes.  Edit: you should find some good ideas in this lesson: http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Deep_Blues_Blues_on_the_Move_Transitional_Blues_Licks  Edit II: also, bear in mind that the last E before you go to I is performing a different function than the rest of them. You could sub it with a m7b5 arpeggio or a diminished run or whatever to exploit the tension."
bluesguitarist,2wwzwm,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:33:52 2015 UTC,"thanks for the comment! so what you're saying is in E, while the A-B is repeated I could solo in E- mixolydian, but then over the last B play an Em7b5 ?"
bluesguitarist,2wwzwm,bluesnoodler_,3,Mon Feb 23 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"You want to play A Mixolydian over A and B Miolydian over B etc.   For the diminished vibe, try playing   D string: 10th   G string: 11th   B string: 10th   E string: 11th   instead of the last B"

He bought the body (and neck) from some guy in Dolores Park, SF for ten bucks. He then put on hardware, strings, electronics, etc. and put it up as a reward on the kickstarter for his album ($400). Naturally, I couldn't resist. This is the guitar I use most of the time and on most of the recordings. Artinger: This is a hand made, carved top, chambered sweetie. It was expensive (you don't want to know). Classical that I built in 1986. It's the one on Lagrima and for rhythm on Fields of Gold. Republic Resonator that I use for slide mostly. It's what I used on Rollin and Tumblin. The amps: My son's big VOX. It could destroy the neighbors. The little Yamaha that I've had for decades. It's the one I use most of the time. The little Danelectro Honeytone that I use for portability. It's fun. Recently I used it to play at a friend's open art studio event. Just wandered around his large space playing and talking to folks. In the foreground you can see the mic that I use to record."

Most of this was recorded playing my Artinger through an M-Audio large diaphram condenser mic to an M-Audio interface and onto my Mac. The first go round (after the intro) was recorded on my Android phone using Midio. I was playing Dolores, the guitar that my son built from a gutted out hollow body he bought in Dolores Park in SF. He added all the hardware and guts. I played it through my little portable Honeytone Amp. What do you think of the different qualities? High Price v. Cheap.

bluesguitarist,2vyzzh,Mikethrillmas,3,Mon Feb 16 02:35:34 2015 UTC,"For all of us kids at home lets break down the lesson a bit and show just how versatile and important these chords are. I'm reminded of the scene in Spinal Tap. ""D minor is the saddest of all the keys.""  Well the chords in this rotation are:  E: x7999x - E9:x7977x  A7: x0757x/x0768x  B:7998xx/7977xx  ""These are bluesiest of all blues chords.""  Really and truly, these are the bricks that built the blues. You could build a billion blues songs without exaggerating out of these. Songs tend to love 1,4,5 patterns so we'll just throw this in.  D7: x57575  Try making your own rotations up, think of these chords as legos meant to be pulled apart and reassembled. Plenty of people have made careers out of rearranging these chords.  I really wish I had youtube when I was first starting out. I could have skipped all kinds of grief."

bluesguitarist,2vsmh9,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Fri Feb 13 20:31:41 2015 UTC,Check out Republic Guitars
bluesguitarist,2vsmh9,Rythameen,1 point,Sat Feb 14 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"First up ""Dobro"" is a brand of guitar, bought out some years back by Gibson. Their current models aren't great value for the money. The style of guitar is called a Resonator.  There are two types of resonator - round necks played and held like a normal guitar and square necks which you play on your lap and can only play slide on.  It depends on how much money you have to spend, and it's one of those cases where a little bit extra goes a long way.   The cheaper end of the scale are the Gretsch Roots Series - Alligator, Box Car and Bobtail - starting at around $400 US. Anything less than this is a piece of shit not worth looking at. They have an absolutely awesome tone for how cheap they are, but they are a cheap guitar and probably will not age well. Fender and Dobro also have some cheaper models, but the Gretsch's just blow them away,  The next step are Republic guitars, $500+. They are pretty good value for money, a much more solid instrument than the Gretsch's, but can be hit and miss for tone. Although it's a better quality instrument, the slightly cheaper Gretsch's sound better in my opinion, although they will have more rattles and fret buzz. There is also more variance of tone among models - one I very nearly bought was called a ""Hell Hound"" and was comparable to the tone of the cheaper Gretchs.  Up a little more - around $700-800 US base price but you can get them cheaper if you don't get it through a music shop, and you can get a Gretsch Honey Dipper (which is what I bought a few months ago). I got one from a store that allowed a free adjustment, so I got the action lowered (I don't play slide often) and got rid of a few buzzes. Definitely recommend one of these."

bluesguitarist,2vpoce,IAmTriscuit,4,Fri Feb 13 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"It's a really old song - 1928 - but maybe check out Ishmon Bracey's Saturday blues. It's acoustic, and there's two guitars, but the structure (12 bar) is the same as B&B and there's a 'main riff' that changes every time.  The two guitars can be hard to work out, but I've tabbed it out for one guitar here. It's for finger style, but pretty easy to adapt for electric play. Crank your axe up to 10 and go to town like Jack White would!"
bluesguitarist,2vpoce,newaccount,2,Fri Feb 13 09:31:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks a lot for your help! I haven't actually gotten to sit down with it yet, but this is what I was looking for, and your tab looks really helpful. Can't wait to try it out when I get home."
bluesguitarist,2vpoce,newaccount,2,Fri Feb 13 12:58:07 2015 UTC,"No worries, one of the things that sets Jake White's work apart from others is that he plays an older style of blues. He's got more in common with guys from the 20s than guys from the 60s."
bluesguitarist,2vpoce,bluesnoodler_,2,Fri Feb 13 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"Jack White is deep into Son House, Fred McDowell, Junior Kimbrough and similar artists  For contemporary artists, check out the North Mississippi All Stars."

bluesguitarist,2vmepp,jonsoloo,3,Thu Feb 12 05:05:59 2015 UTC,"It all depends on whether you play electric or acoustic, but the answer is Lightning Hopkins.   No matter whether you want to play straight acoustic finger style from the 20s or distorted to hell stadium rock, Lightning Hopkins has you covered.  But if you gave us the style you want to play we'll be able to give you a list of songs that you should check out. (But lightning Hopkins is the answer!)"
bluesguitarist,2vmepp,newaccount,1 point,Thu Feb 12 07:13:42 2015 UTC,I'll definitely check out lightning Hopkins lol  I'm definitely open to both but electric is mainly what I'm interested in.  In regards to style definitely a mix of Albert King and although he's not essentially a blues player but I love John Mayer's style.  He's a good mix of everyone
bluesguitarist,2vmepp,newaccount,2,Fri Feb 13 05:39:54 2015 UTC,"Someone that hasn't been mentioned is Hubert Sumlin - Howlin' Wolf's guitarist for most of his career. Not as flashy as others, but he's one of the most solid rhythm players in the business - and by rhythm I mean riff based rhythm playing. He was one of the more creative guitar players, just making up the coolest grooves you have ever heard. Besides his famous work like Smokestack Lightning, hs other stuff is just super tight and super smart - Howling for my Darlin'.  It's not tricky guitar playing, if you know your way around a fret board you'll pick up the basics of a song in 10 minutes, but it just so effective. All the guys you want to play like grew up wanting to play like Hubert Sumlin."

I'm not doing any lecture, just showing you where it is on the guitar and providing the tab. It's not flawlessly played, but close enough so that you can make progress quickly on your own.  As I know them longer, I'll play them better. That said, they are very close to the originals.  This is the full-speed demonstration.  This is the link to my handwritten tab.  I got this as close to the original as I could, hope you enjoy it.  Here are the others, all off the 1969 self-titled Allman Brothers Band album:  Black Hearted Woman  Don't Want You No More  It's Not My Cross To Bear  There are dozens more from the ABB, Marshall Tucker, Eagles, ZZ TOP on my channel."

bluesguitarist,2vc8cg,tallpapab,2,Mon Feb 9 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"The looper pedal is nice for practice. In this track I play a short intro then hit the looper pedal to start recording. When I'm done with 12 bars of bass line I hit it again to turn recording off and it starts playing it back while I fart around for a couple times around. Then I hit the pedal again to record a simpler rhythm track for 12 bars. Once more I hit the looper to stop recording and it plays back both layers, the bass line and the rhythm. You can hear both and a few bars later I come in with the solo. I went on for quite some time this way, but mercifly faded it out before too long. Any one else use a looper? If so can you share ideas for using it?  EDIT: I use a Ditto Looper from tc electronics. Others?  EDIT: The hard part was getting the timing on the first loop. The looper itself seems to sync subsequent loops with the first."

I've been using my ditto a lot lately and loved it, but I've been starting with rhythm and it gets real messy real quick. Need to learn better bass lines :)"

bluesguitarist,2uv9ah,chris88alfonso,6,Thu Feb 5 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"Hey there.   If you wanna hit the jams, here's a few tips (source: I ran a jam for a year and a half run at one point, and have witnessed/participated in countless jams):   Hit the jam first and scope it out. See how it's run, like do you write your name on a board and wait? etc. Pay attention to the tunes that get played. Pick one you like and learn it -- get the rhythm down because you are going to be expected to play rhythm for the other players. Not all jams are created equal. There are plenty of assholes running jams out there, hoping a novice will show up so that they can be a prick to them. Another good reason to scope out a jam before you show up to play. Talk to the jammers too -- they will give you the straight dope. A lot of jam leaders will expect you to understand stuff like ""It's a shuffle in G with a quick change"", or ""It goes I IV II V"". If you don't want to get caught off guard, pick a couple of tunes like Born Under a Bad Sign, or The Thrill is Gone or Sweet Home Chicago and learn them. That way you can say ""let's play this one"". Turn down behind any vocals and never step on them -- if there is someone singing, don't be noodling. A good sense of etiquette is more appreciated than killer chops.  Pay attention for physical cues. You don't want to be staring at your hands when the guy nods you in to take a solo. Also, after one turnaround, look up and around to see whether they want you to take another round or hop back onto rhythm. Be a nice person. It's a small world."
bluesguitarist,2uv9ah,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Feb 5 16:20:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you bluesnoodler. This is what I needed. Yeah, I think I will go around first and see the venues to get an idea and just bring my guitar just in case. But that was one of my main fears. I don't want to step on anyone's shoes. I want to be respectful and learn."
bluesguitarist,2uv9ah,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Feb 5 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"Glad you found any of that helpful! Yes, if you indicate that you are new to the whole thing, most people will be happy to help you get into it. By and large jam folk are good folk, and they will try and make it a good experience for you. Enjoy!"
bluesguitarist,2uv9ah,newaccount,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"Learn the blues scale, add the major sixth to it:  e|----------------------------------------------0 b|-------------------------------------0--2--3--- g|-------------------------------0--2------------ d|---------------------0--2---2------------------ a|--------0--1--2--4----------------------------- e|-0--3------------------------------------------   When you play the minor 3rd, bend it towards the maj 3rd, or hammeron to it.  e|------------------------------------3b--0 b|---------------------------0--2--0------- g|----------------------0h1---------------- d|-------------------2--------------------- a|----------2----/4------------------------ e|-0--3h4----------------------------------   Enjoy!"

Check out some lightning Hopkins tunes or lessons. He makes the bluesiest sounds you have ever heard, and never goes away from those 6 or 7 notes!"

bluesguitarist,2uunrv,ddshroom,2,Thu Feb 5 10:57:06 2015 UTC,"Zakk sounds all phasey -- couldn't really make out his licks. Bonomassa sticks to the bridge pup and cuts through the murk.  Zakk is one of the bluesier metal guys, in that he often rips the minor pentatonic in 3 note per string patterns and has a proclivity for lots of pinch harmonics ala Billy Gibbons. I think that's why I always dug him. I'm not real big on the ""neo classical"" thing, 'cause there's not enough rock and roll in it for me.  Bonomassa can shred like a beast, but he has stuck with the blues 'cause that is his bread and butter since he was a child prodigy. He is also a very savvy tonemeister and he can't help but cut heads -- probably had a million dudes try to smoke him out when he was ""Smokin' Joe"" the 12 year old blues wonder.   Would be interesting to see Bonomassa jam with Wylde in his comfort zone, like an Ozzy number.  Here's an interesting pairing: John Mayer vs Gary Clark Jr: http://youtu.be/RyFs13mMtPo"
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Feb 5 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"John Mayer - there's a lot about him I want to hate, but you can't hate a guy who is just so good."
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,newaccount,2,Thu Feb 5 13:04:04 2015 UTC,"Lol - true.  Hilariously, my first exposure to John Mayer happened by accident one day. My wife was watching some stultifying daytime talk show -- Ellen. Housewife programming. I am across the room futzing with the computer or something. I hear a bunch of women squealing on the TV, and then a band starts playing, so I check out the TV to see this guy in what looks like paisley printed yoga pants playing guitar. Before I could get past this bizarre tableaux, dude is ripping some decidedly Hendrixian sounds out of his Strat. I am like ""who the fuck is this guy in the yoga pants, and why is he playing those licks, and why is he on Ellen getting screamed at by a bunch of housewives?"".  So I looked him up on Youtube and found a clip of him playing Machine Gun and thought ""why is this guy so popular with grown women, yet here he is playing Hendrix?"". Then I heard one of his pop tunes on the radio and I had an epiphany -- he is Clapton 2.0! Can play the blues, but makes $ writing shmaltzy pop music. Then I read the infamous Playboy interview that made the world think he's a douche. It is impossible not to think so having read it. But that interview is ancient now. I have since seen other ones where he seems like a perfectly alright dude.  I still want to hate the guy, but as you say you can't hate a guy who is so good. Don't have any of his sides or anything, but I am glad that in some way he is helping keep blues happening."

I've got to admit I didn't rate him at all until one of my mates set me down and made me listen to his non-radio songs. The guy is up there with the best of them."

bluesguitarist,2uunrv,Ihatecheese86,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"All the great metal legends could have made it as a blues legend if blues was marketable at the time. These two are two of my all time favorites in their respective genre; I love these two guys because they are having as much fun as possible doing what they love, and in the process both have really crafted their own signature sound. I can always if it's an Ozzy song or BLS just by hearing a few seconds of the guitar work, despite the fact a whole lot of metal guitarists sound identical to one another. Just the same as ton of blues guys sound like one another, but Joe always puts his ""you know its Joe f__ing Bonamassa mark"" on all of his work.  Joe smokes Zakk in this vid, but man it would be fun to see Joe step into the metal realm for a duet."
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,newaccount,5,Thu Feb 5 07:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think Zakk's tone killed him a bit here; Joey's guitar tone was just so sweet and Zakk's was muddy and a lot of the micro harmonics got lost. I couldn't really hear what he was doing cleanly a lot of the time.   Not sure if all the metal legends could cross over to blues and be rated as high as they are.  In the same way, I doubt many of the blues guys could be metal legends. The defining aspect (if we have to simplify it down to just one defining feature) of metal is technique and with blues it would be note choice.  Here's an argument: Jimmy Page (who I rated very highly) probably couldn't make it as either - his blues technique  relies a bit too much on pure speed, and his metal technique is too sloppy.  He is the perfect rock guitarist, top 3 in anyone's list, and he'd be top 50 in either straight blues or metal, but probably not the top 10 in either."
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,JilaX,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:07:41 2015 UTC,"I think I like this video so much due to how polarized these two talents and their pickups are (zw emg vs. joe b duncan) .   I'll agree that usually most guys major in one genre, but Zakk specifically really is a great guitarist of many trades all memes aside, this video doesn't really showcase it. I'm not sure if it's the crybaby making zakks guitar sound worse than it should or the recording; those emg active pickups in person have outstanding bite that doesn't show through in this video and are very crisp compared to this thin muddy tone.   This just goes to show that the guy that is playing next to Joe isn't going to sound as good. He never seems to make mistakes, he's always in the right settings at the right time. Audible chocolate."
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,JilaX,2,Thu Feb 5 09:00:30 2015 UTC,"The EMGs sound like crap. Sorry man, they always do. You can get away with it in a studio, but live they're atrociously bad."

Top class guitar player, there's no doubt, but he's never quite done it for me. Then again, I gave up the electric years ago so probably have missed a lot of his work."
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"All the great metal legends could have made it as a blues legend if blues was marketable at the time.   I would contend that being a great metal player doesn't tacitly imply that one is a master of blues. They are two entirely different disciplines. I know quite a few shredders, and those cats are awesome but they couldn't play the blues to save their lives!  But yeah, both of these guys are brilliant! This video is a ton of fun."
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Thu Feb 5 09:22:21 2015 UTC,"True that they are very different, but metal definitely stems from blues roots. I mean if you don't have those basic principles down I'm not sure how you can advance too far."
bluesguitarist,2uunrv,Ihatecheese86,6,Thu Feb 5 12:54:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is that blues is more than the minor pentatonic scale -- it's a vast genre with many sub genres and styles that one person couldn't master all of if they lived to be 150. If I can play Yngwie licks, sweeping minor arpeggios and tapping lines on diatonic scales, that does not somehow impart the ability to play like Blind Blake, mapping out a bass line, harmony and melody at the same time with incredibly advanced right hand technique, nor does it afford me an innate understanding of the vast vocabulary of blues vernacular as far as comping in one of the many established styles like the tramp groove we are jamming this week, or playing some sophisticated jump lines, etc.  Most electric blues also involves improvising. Metal is not improvised -- it is carefully planned out. That is why the cats I know who are shredders have a hard time trying to play blues: they haven't listened to enough blues to have handle on the various genres, so they literally don't speak the language, don't have the requisite lick vernacular, and they haven't spent enough time improvising to be deft on their feet. Blues is a vast language with a rich tradition. You can't fake it. Having chops is nice, but if you haven't studied the blues, you can't play them. Have a wade though the lessons on this sub and it will quickly become evident that there is more to the blues than playing the minor pentatonic scale and bending strings. Electric blues players are playing both the minor pentatonic and the major pentatonic mixed (+ b5. That's 9 notes) as well as dominant 7th arpeggios, m7b5 arpeggios, diminished/altered/whole half/chromatic runs, tritone subs, etc. Then there is the art of blues rhythm. Or of course playing slide.  The one metal player who is studied and made a truly successful crossover into blues was Gary Moore, who was an absolute monster at playing blues.   Watch him trade licks with BB King here. Clearly Moore has done his homework. I doubt very much that any living established metal guy could do this unless they too spent several years listening to.studying blues:  http://youtu.be/iUaevnP1LLg  Edit: holy fuck am I ever pedantic! Sorry about that -- must be the 8 coffees in a row!"

Ishmon and Tommy were mates hanging out in Jackson, and Ishmon actually dragged Tommy along when he made his test recording for a talent scout. As a result, the recording company wanted to record both of them, so the first two songs I can find that use this line were both recorded on the very same day in the very same studio!   It's likely it was a common lyric used by bluesmen around Jackson Mississippi in the early to mid 1920's, but I don't think we'll ever know who first came up with it. Killer line, though!"

This was one of the first videos I did, so the playing is a bit rough, and I combined his and Dickey's parts into a single guitar to try to capture the essence of both...  And here is a link to the tab I wrote for it."
bluesguitarist,2ucq88,RickMcCargar,2,Sun Feb 1 01:57:22 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I've been looking for tabs on this forever.

bluesguitarist,2u97kx,Meandmybuddyduncan,2,Sat Jan 31 11:47:15 2015 UTC,Do you have any tips about playing through those chord changes like that? The voicing was great
bluesguitarist,2u97kx,bluesnoodler_,2,Sat Jan 31 15:36:29 2015 UTC,"I started off with a I-IV-V progression, and the beauty of that is you can translate chord shifts in the pentatonic scale you're playing in.   So If I'm in the key of G with the root of the scale on the third fret of the bottom E string, my IVth note C and Vth note D are on the 3rd and 5th fret on the A string. The minor pentatonic scale allows me to walk up and down, or into changes. So I could play a chord based on that IV or V, or walk up/down.   I'm not the best with music theory and some or all of what I described may be 100% wrong and make no sense lol, but that's how I interpret that scale."

bluesguitarist,2u9hkl,BirdVive,3,Sat Jan 31 01:50:27 2015 UTC,Keep the nylon strings and play slide on that. It has a very distinct sound that I really enjoy. I have a half sized nylon string guitar that I practise on and slide sounds really cool.
bluesguitarist,2u9hkl,DenialTwister,2,Sat Jan 31 14:12:53 2015 UTC,I've done so before many times on my classical guitar back home.   Go ahead.
bluesguitarist,2u9hkl,Futski,2,Sat Jan 31 10:45:12 2015 UTC,the re-tuning doesn't mess up the nylon strings?
bluesguitarist,2u9hkl,Futski,2,Sat Jan 31 12:41:44 2015 UTC,Not so much that I consider it an issue. Mine handles Open G fine.
bluesguitarist,2u9hkl,StoogeKebab,2,Sat Jan 31 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"I've tune a friend's one (classical guitarist) from standard to Spanish or Vestapol and back whenever I need to perform and haven't got my own guitar (It happens quite a bit when he's on and I get asked to perform unexpectedly). It's old (his uncles, 50 years) and the strings are at least 3 years old, so maybe that would factor in, but if there's nothing else, based on my personal experience, changing tunings on nylon strings should work alright."
bluesguitarist,2u9hkl,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Sat Jan 31 13:07:00 2015 UTC,Definitely don't use steel strings on a guutar meant for nylon ones. You will destroy it.

bluesguitarist,2u4vdt,diggerB,2,Thu Jan 29 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of free recording programs you can use: Audacity or Reaper. Download the jam track from Soundcloud, open it up in recording software and put it into a multitrack session.   I use a POD, so using Amplitude I can't help you with!  Hopefully someone else can help you with that.  Cheers"
bluesguitarist,2u4vdt,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jan 29 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"A RockSmith cable might introduce a little latency, but Audacity has a shift tool which will make things right, after you lay down your track. I put on headphones with one cup on my ear the other off so I can hear the guitar. I play through and amp and mic, though. I'm not sure how you're going to listen to both the backing track and your guitar  while recording with the RockSmith cable. Good luck. I'm sure you'll figure something out. Maybe someone else here will have a better idea."

bluesguitarist,2u4vdt,readinghistory,1 point,Fri Jan 30 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"I don't have a whole lot to add, since bluesnoodler and tallpapab have covered the main points, but I use Audacity and a Rocksmith cable to record my takes on the jams with no complaints. I haven't noticed any latency on my current computer, but on other computers in the past I've just nudged my track over a bit like tallpapab mentioned. The biggest drawback for me is that I can't hear what my guitar is going to sound like amplified and with effects until I play the track back. I just turn down my speakers a bit so I can hear the sound of my strings over the track while I'm recording, which works well enough. I look forward to hearing your jams in the coming weeks!"

bluesguitarist,2tsu5z,polyology,2,Tue Jan 27 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"Heh - that's the ""Jimmy Reed"" B -- the D is the minor 3rd of B, so it works!  Otherwise, you are essentially playing a power chord with the open E and the B note on the A string 2nd fret, 'cause the B is the 5th of E. Same deal with the open A and E note on the D string 2nd fret.  When you bounce to the 4th fret on the A, you hit C#, the 5th note of the E major pentatonic scale. When you hit the 5th fret on the A string, you hit D, the 5th note in the E minor pentatonic scale.  Same deal when you move it up to A.  Hope that makes sense!"
bluesguitarist,2tsu5z,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"So it is a I IV V in E.   I still don't understand how a D can be substituted for a B. I can hear that it works but I don't know why. Why can't I substitute C for the A as well then, since it is the minor 3rd of A? That doesn't work. So does the minor 3rd substitution only work for the V? Does it follow that there is a minor something substitution for the IV and yet another one for the I?  Trying to understand the logic behind this."
bluesguitarist,2tsu5z,bluesnoodler_,3,Tue Jan 27 04:01:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see the problem - when you get to the V, you are playing at the 2nd 4th and  5th fret on the G string under the open D. You should be playing the 4th, 6th and 7th! That's the Jimmy Reed B!  edit: alternately, you could play the B barre chord there and bounce your pinky on the 6th and 7th fret."
bluesguitarist,2tsu5z,StupidAnalogy,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"if you play the A as the (I) chord, the D as the (IV) chord, and the low E as the (V) chord, you have a very common 12 bar blues progression.  Any chance the tab is wrong?"
bluesguitarist,2tsu5z,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Sat Jan 31 04:11:33 2015 UTC,"No, tab is correct. I've been playing that run for years.

It's a tribute to Fuller's guitar style, so every half bar has a new idea in it. It's a showcase of open position dynamic rhythm playing.  I need help working out what he does behind the main notes in bar 10 of the main progression. He sets it up in the previous bar with the A to F# in the bass, then plays a few notes very quietly behind the A & D; A & C# that I can't work out. Later on he plays higher notes, but I would appreciate it if anyone could let me know what he's doing in the first go round. Could just be the open D, but I've been trying all week but can't get it.

bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,jaypeejay,3,Sun Jan 25 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"Hey. So, starting on the V would indicate starting the tune with a turnaround. Otherwise, that's a pretty incomplete thing to work from!  As for 16 bars, think Key to the Highway/Bring it on Home to Me. Don't get what you were to expect after doing that as an ""intro"", save another 16 bars.  And yes, shuffle in G is what it sounds like (check out Jimmy Reed as your shuffle guide).  Sounds like the dude calling the tunes could have been more helpful. Once you have the various ubiquitous grooves and their variations under your belt, you can pretty well figure out wtf is going on when encountering that kind of thing. If you scope out a jam first, then you can suss out what tunes they are doing and do a little home work. Or learn a few classics on your own."
bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,bluesnoodler_,2,Sun Jan 25 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Hey. So, starting on the V would indicate starting the tune with a turnaround.

Don't get what you were to expect after doing that as an ""intro"", save another 16 bars.   Yeah we were doing some old blues song, can't remember the name. Still unsure how it worked.

bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Sun Jan 25 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"Hey - as /u/TheGreek41 pointed out, starting at the V does in fact mean starting at bar 9. I was in fact wrong there. : /"
bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"When you said start at the turnaround that's actually what I assumed   So:  V(X1) IV (x1) I (x1) V(X1)  I suppose that means my understanding of the definition of turnaround is a bit off. How would you explain it, if you don't mind."
bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,ddshroom,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:45:31 2015 UTC,"That is the last 4 bars, while a turnaround is the last two bars.  Have a look through these to see a few different ones."
bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,TheGreek41,2,Mon Jan 26 12:16:37 2015 UTC,Great questions. Answered above.
bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,bluesnoodler_,2,Mon Jan 26 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with almost everything here, but if someone said ""Start from the V,"" I would assume that means starting from bar 9 of a 12 bar blues instead of the turnaround, which is usually just the last two bars. Good luck man!"
bluesguitarist,2tmpvo,was-not-taken,2,Mon Jan 26 04:22:13 2015 UTC,D'oh! That is actually the right info. Bar 9.   I happily stand corrected!

bluesguitarist,2tl2pb,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:09:59 2015 UTC,The boxes around the comments are standard throughout reddit. I might try and see what it looks like (picks). I like the hard geometry of the triangles against the serif font.

Duane Allman really just strings licks together, while Dickey plays more of a thoughtful melody.  Most useful? Not sure why I would think about them in that fashion.  I've done a lot of licks/solos and songs since I started to relearn to play after having a couple of strokes, and they were all useful in that regard."
bluesguitarist,2tgxea,clockjuice,3,Sat Jan 24 01:35:20 2015 UTC,I liked some of the double stops and country-ish licks that you threw in here and there! I'm looking forward to hearing more.

bluesguitarist,2tgxea,tallpapab,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:27:41 2015 UTC,"Live and learn. One cheap trick to try is to put your phone close to the laptop and away from the amp, maybe somewhere close to your ear so that you might get what you hear while you're playing.  EDIT: Keep at it.

bluesguitarist,2t9t20,original_nam,6,Thu Jan 22 12:11:31 2015 UTC,"It's known as ""a quick 4""."
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,was-not-taken,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:57:24 2015 UTC,The only other person I've heard use that term was a jazz double bass player who I used to run into at jams. I take it that in the jazz realm that is the standard vernacular?
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:10:06 2015 UTC,I learned it while sitting in with blues bands. It's an efficient way to point out that the tune you're calling varies from the most common twelve bar arrangement. I'd say that the quick 4 arrangement is the second most common 12 bar blues arrangement. Until now I assumed it was limited to the blues player's vernacular - thanks for the info!
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,was-not-taken,2,Thu Jan 22 19:52:06 2015 UTC,Yes. Quick Change. Here's a famous example.
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,tallpapab,3,Thu Jan 22 17:26:06 2015 UTC,Quick change is in fact the official name for it!
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jan 22 12:19:06 2015 UTC,"I've only heard ""quick to the four"", so it's cool to read these other responses."
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,robhutten,2,Thu Jan 22 23:26:45 2015 UTC,Never heard 'quick to the four'.
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,was-not-taken,1 point,Fri Jan 23 08:49:49 2015 UTC,"I suppose every region has it's own vernacular. I Googled ""quick to the four"". One of the hits is ""Mandolin for Dummies"". ""Blues Guitar for Dummies"" uses the term ""quick four"".  I've only been to blues jams in my home town. It took me a long time to understand the musical terminology used on stage by musicians who have no theory background. It's somewhat analogous to an oral history vs. a written history.  I wonder if I would understand the local vernacular on a stage in a city 2,000 miles away?"
bluesguitarist,2t9t20,robhutten,1 point,Fri Jan 23 09:12:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it must be regional to some extent. ""Nashville charts"", for instance.   I used to play Andean folkloric music with guys from Peru. They used solfege for everything and counted out the music in ""sentences"" rather than bars, lines of phrases. It was a great experience."

bluesguitarist,2t69t1,JilaX,2,Thu Jan 22 15:55:47 2015 UTC,"Lol.   Yeah -- that's a hard row to hoe. I found that a routine really helped, like a daily agenda. The more I filled my days with positive stuff, the less I got restless, bored or down. Dwelling on my problems or the urgency to fix them just caused despair, but simple shit like having a morning routine full of good behavior like ""drink juice"", ""eat my Wheaties"", ""go for a walk"" etc put me in a positive frame."

bluesguitarist,2t0yx5,tdnelson1225,3,Tue Jan 20 06:32:38 2015 UTC,"There are tons of great open position licks in E. If you can riff out at the 12th fret, just play those same licks and pretend the nut is your index finger (or the 12th fret). Maybe start by accenting the chord -- play an E7 chord and try lifting your pinky off of the B string and hitting the high E at the 3rd. Give it a little bend and release it. Bounce your index on the G string for that major 3rd flavor.  Here's a lesson on open position E licks: http://youtu.be/0-1BVY4oRZM  Here's another one: http://youtu.be/32djpMHPrTc  And here's a long, super basic one: http://youtu.be/W1hcSM6FNLg"

bluesguitarist,2sopda,rko1985,3,Sat Jan 17 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, you would switch with the chords, so A mixolydian, D mixolydian, E mixolydian. Dominant 7th chords are built from the mixolydian mode (5th chord in the harmonized major scale, 5th mode), so it will always sound good over them.  Another standard strategy would be in say A to play A mixolydian over the I, A pentatonic minor and/or Dorian over the IV, and both over the V. There are also spots where you can slip in diminished or altered runs, as well as m7b5 arpeggios.   Here are several lessons on using mixolydian in your blues:  http://www.maximummusician.com/bluesrhythmguitarmixolydian.htm  http://youtu.be/zKA9oD0kRyY  http://youtu.be/xqR1agXkHw0  http://www.guitarhabits.com/the-mighty-mixolydian-scale-over-a-blues/  As far as solos go, here is the deal: when you mix the major and minor pentatonic scales together, which is done all the time in blues, the mixolydian mode is already in there, because the major 3rd and b7 are both there. So any lick using those notes is essentially using mixolydian, and there are jillions of them. BB King exploits the major 3rd, b7 sound all the time."
bluesguitarist,2sopda,bluesnoodler_,3,Sat Jan 17 03:46:15 2015 UTC,"hey thanks, i know you wrote a response on the other tread with a video. the first video you posted here is excellent. it really sounds good and illustrated perfectly how to do it. the way he played in the other video didn't sound good. it just sounded like noodling, but the way he plays in this video in this thread, it sounds really authentic and bluesly and it clearly showed how to execute the concept."
bluesguitarist,2sopda,bluesnoodler_,2,Sat Jan 17 04:01:06 2015 UTC,You're welcome! :D
bluesguitarist,2sopda,tallpapab,2,Sat Jan 17 04:56:56 2015 UTC,Get a harp player. Mixolydian is the secret sauce to playing cross harp for the blues.
bluesguitarist,2sopda,Zibabbidibow,1 point,Sat Jan 17 04:10:59 2015 UTC,"If you're playing A mixolydian over I, switch to A Dorian (or D mixo, same scale) over the IV, as it has more notes from that chord in it. Emphasize 1, 6, 4, and minor 3 (AC#EG, IV7 arpeggio). Over the V, I would just play the A major scale with maybe a little chromatic thrown in. Again emphasize chord tones."

bluesguitarist,2sl9or,iCCup_Spec,2,Fri Jan 16 03:15:52 2015 UTC,"It will all come with a lot of practice. In this case, if you pay special attention to ear training (for example: http://tonedear.com/chord_progressions.html), as well as rhythm training (for example, put the guitar down and just clap your hands along the progression's rhythm while humming or naming the chords as they go by), eventually you will hear it and even feel it.  If you really can't get started with that rhythm exercise, it can help to ask a musician friend to do the clapping and naming in front of you a few times. Then, you'll be able to do it on your own."
bluesguitarist,2sl9or,WoJiaoMax,2,Fri Jan 16 04:03:42 2015 UTC,"Wahahaha. Thanks for the link. I'm going to try it for a while to see if it helps. edit: In a realistic jam session/track, do you listen to the bass or rhythm guitar solely for progression?"
bluesguitarist,2sl9or,iKidCudi,1 point,Fri Jan 16 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on the track, but if you can make out the bass it helps a lot. I usually listen to the bass for the root note, then the rhythm for the type of chord."
bluesguitarist,2sl9or,bluesnoodler_,2,Fri Jan 16 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"If you are having trouble discerning the changes, try counting the bars. You should be able to more or less feel it when the changes happen."
bluesguitarist,2sl9or,bluesnoodler_,1 point,Fri Jan 16 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah if I focus on counting the bar, I could hear the changes. But where I am now, I think I need to predict it coming in order to utilize it. For example, I get loss within one jam track so much that I wouldn't know if, in a quick change I-IV-V, a bar 2 just happened or bar 5. Correct me if I'm wrong, but more experienced blues players always know what bar is occurring? Would you say this is a necessity for intermediate skill level or beginner?"

bluesguitarist,2sib1s,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jan 15 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"I approached it after learning a lot of Travis/Atkins style. That made it seem a lot easier. The trick with the Scotty Moore is to play it uncomfortably slow, then accelerate it a little each day. I'm not going to lie, it took like 6 months to get it to a fast rockabilly speed. I still can only play it at half the speed with a thumb pick."
bluesguitarist,2sib1s,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jan 15 17:42:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for that -- was starting to wonder whether I inadvertently fried that part of my brain!
bluesguitarist,2sib1s,rackmountrambo,2,Thu Jan 15 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's just unfathomably hard to keep it straight at speed. Always play songs with this at the end of a set, you're not playing a song right after it.   Building up took a long time and it sounds stupid and is absolutely useless for like three of those months, you just have to focus on the endgame. By the time I could play it at a good speed, everybody I jam with couldn't stand it any more haha"

I think Ringo is even in there on a few tracks. It really rocks."

bluesguitarist,2sdcdj,kahn265,2,Wed Jan 14 12:33:37 2015 UTC,"Muddy Waters did a London sessions album also with essentially the same line up. I've read that Muddy wasn't happy with it though. He felt that they British blues guys didn't get his behind the beat style of playing.    In my opinion, for what it's worth, the Howlin Wolf London sessions album is the better of the two."
bluesguitarist,2sdcdj,poekicker,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:53:36 2015 UTC,"Great album. Apparently the record company didn't want to fly Hubert Sumlin over, but Clapton refused to be part of it unless they did."

They couldn't really hang imo, and as much as they liked to think they played the same style of blues, they really didn't. Not a diss, just my 2c (may be backed up by the opinion of Muddy and Sonny Boy II ;) )  It really wasn't a great album imo"

bluesguitarist,2sdcdj,newaccount,1 point,Wed Jan 14 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"TIL. Yeah thats it, I got one of those cheap ""Gold Collection"" CDso f Muddy's years ago, and it had Honky Tonk on it. All the songs were live with very polite audiences, so I figured it was from a European tour. The version they do of Honky Tonk is just sublime, perfect note placement, behind the beat slides, it had it all. There's a few versions on you tube but none are the one I grew up with."
bluesguitarist,2sdcdj,bluesnoodler_,2,Thu Jan 15 07:52:47 2015 UTC,"Working the bars along the sort of beach front strip in my town growing up, I heard live music every night, mostly blues bands. Got to the point where I knew the repertoire of pretty well every band, down to the banter between tunes.  Songs I never need to hear again:   Mustang Sally  Walkin' the Dog   A good blues set should have a variety of grooves to keep things interesting. Some bands are better at certain things and not as great at others, so will emphasize their strong suit but still mix things up with some different things.  Rather than list a bunch of songs, it's a good idea to look at the various grooves/styles and find repertoire to meet those requirements. So, you might start your list like this, then find material that fits the bill:   slow blues minor blues shuffle stop time rhumba 8/16 bar straight 8s (rock and roll) jump/swing funky ?   etc  If you find a few tunes to list under each style, you'll have 2-3 good sets worth of stuff that you can mix and match. Also, you will be ready for things like ""Everyone is dancing! We can't kill this buzz with a slow number!"" etc  Edit: found a set list from a gig many moons ago:   I'm ready Let the Good Times Roll Just a Little Bit Champagne and Reefer Born Under a Bad Sign Crosscut Saw Thrill is Gone Route 66 Hoochie Coochie Man Bright Lights Big City"
bluesguitarist,2sdcdj,carmour,2,Wed Jan 14 13:44:48 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of truth in the range of grooves and feels. In saying that, there really is a huge amount of ways in which you can do swing, shuffle, or funk numbers.   Grooves aren't everything though and not all blues lyrics are made equal. Finding tunes that aren't done to death that still have good lyrics can be a challenge.  I would hazard a warnign that straight 8s isnt actually straight 8s if you listen to most rock and roll records, they're swung by at least one of the members, so you end up with a straight swingish thing (somewhere in between) eg rock around the clock, johnny b good, little queenie"

I like to play all relative modes on minor blues too, not much fond of major blues! but yeah when it's minor I modulate relatively between Aeolian,Phrygian and Phrygian dominant and Dorian of course. When it's major I only know about the Mixolydian mode along with the major pentatonic and a few passing tones. Thanks for watching."

I particularly fond of Woooo Rosa, very Son House sound.  I bought his Songs Famed For Sorrow And Joy album so I can vouch for that one being really good."
