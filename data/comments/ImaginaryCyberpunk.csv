A rescued derelict from a great war in a world dominated by corporations that pollute all the same even after sea levels have risen to ruin the world's coats, the Fat Lady is a roving blackmarket. Moving in and out of international waters, she peddles illegal and suspiciously sourced technology, materials, and weapons.

I wish I could just 'not' do that pal.""  ""No, I mean the coffee, there are way better ways to wake up. You're in the middle of Hong Kong and you spend time every day getting smelly coffee when there is incredible, good for your tea up here waiting. Clears the mind and heals the body son of Jack. That black stuff just gets you all jittery and wild eyed."" Joeng waved his thumb over the panel and let the machine scan it. In less than a blink of an eye billions of records were accessed and choices made. Data logged and the all clear signal was sent all over. The door below let its single light cycle from unblinking red to an inviting green. Chinese hanzi below greeted the Detective as he walked into the elevator to be scanned and cleared before coming up.  Jackson sipped his coffee before stepping on.  ""I like the hunt. Some days its the only case I get to solve. The case of Java, the Coffee Demon."" He wore his cleaner jeans today. A shirt older than the building he walked into and with letters that could have been any number of punk or rock bands from the last 20 years. As soon as the elevator doors close he pulled off his jacket. The metal buckles and near its end leather could sometimes play with the scanners. The price he paid to look like a relic. He new the machine would give pause and he would have to sit a few minutes longer as it tried to reason out the drink he had in his cup. Coffee, American coffee was just never programmed into the database of items to be allowed into the precinct. And each morning he came in with one it  had to access an exception list and OK him again. He was beginning to think somebody in the office just had it in for him and wanted to chuckle at him each day.  Joeng was deep into his second log file by the time he made it through the several levels of security check points and scans. They both knew you could never be too careful but it still bothered them just the same.   ""Anything good?"" Jackson said in place of a good morning or hello.  ""Nothing special. Hookers are wearing rooster feathers in their hair again. I guess that's new. Oh, and your favorite body mod is back on the hot list.""  ""Great, more tongue splitting."" Jackson took another sip and logged in.  ""Joeng, you see this?"" ""What?"" He pushed back from his console, unplugged and spun around. Jackson opted to never use a deck and still pulled up work on an older 3D holo machine. So Joeng had to undeck to actually see his screen. His feed was from a sector drone doing routine facial scans in the Red District.  ""Congrats, you found the last non-cyber enhanced hooker in Hong-Kong. We got all day to look at hookers Jackson.""  He hit a few strokes and pulled up still images. Jackson half grunted. ""No, look at her face. I've seen it before. ""  ""I swear if you tell me she's been in your dreams all night I'm dumping that coffee and requesting a new partner."" Joeng begins as he starts pulling his rig back onto his head.  ""I'm serious here, and something is wrong, I've seen that face before but not here.  I think it was back home in Chicago.""  ""So what, hookers look the same across the water as they do here."" ""But not exactly the same, that's nuts."" Another quick sip started and ended his sentence.  ""Nuts maybe, but not illegal. Calm down."" ""Joeng, I know. Yeah people can look like someone else, but a straight up clone? Who does that for hookers? That costs too much money.""  With his rig back on his head, Joeng paused momentarily before re-jacking in. ""Hey, its a business. People, companies clone and copy merchandise all the time. This is no different. Yeah its tacky but that's allowed too.""  Jackson begins making a call with his old hand unit. ""Im telling you that's her exactly and that aint right. If we got a Copy Shop in town then we are in big shit. I'm calling a buddy in Chi town and seeing if he can help me.""  ""See, a nice cup of tea and this day would have been fine. Now you're really gonna play ""Guess Who"" with street walkers on two different continents. I told you coffee gets you all hyped up."""

Composition  Artist obviously has a lot of technical skill, but the composition failed here.  It feels like it should be the very left part of a wide landscape painting about 5 times bigger with a half dozen more characters in it.   Posing  For the characters being center screen, their poses sure are awkward.  Guy is in action as if he's about to launch off to the right, but his legs are cut off, dampening that effect significantly.  Girl's pose doesn't make much sense in general, it's basically just showing off her bare abdomen and underboob.  It has no action to it, which contrasts strangely with the weaponry and the guy's action pose.  Inconsistent Internal Logic   Trenchcoats, scarves, long hair and anything else long, protruding, or dangling that can get caught on things or in machinery are all terrible for combat.   Obviously having no clothes and thus no armor on your abdomen or pants on is a poor choice, maybe she's a GITS style cyborg/android though, who knows.   Swords... pretty impractical, but who knows, maybe cloaking or advanced ballistic armor that makes bullets useless has made swords relevant again. Handguns instead of rifles going into combat.  Impractical for anything but impromptu combat.  Handguns are inferior in fire rate due to recoil and capacity and inferior in armor penetration and damage on target.  There's very few advancements that would change this relationship between handguns and rifles as any significant handgun enhancements would also be applied to rifles."

ImaginaryCyberpunk,2lvdlq,otakuman,2,Mon Nov 10 16:39:54 2014 UTC,"Alot of the cityscapes are made by photoshopping actual images of cities together into something of your liking. Or some people draw out basic shapes and buildings and such and then shop over bits and pieces of pictures of windows and buildings and overlay them on top of the shapes they drew.   Another way is to make an actual object in 3d with like Maya or 3ds max (be it a building or vehicle of somesort) and overlay textures and such in photoshop.  Some objects are created and rendered entirely in a 3d package. While some are completely painted out.  Check out matte painting and speed painting tutorials.  This tutorial might be up your alley, i dont have my headphones at work so I can't tell what they are saying but it looks like they are using the techniques i described."

ImaginaryCyberpunk,2lvdlq,PiippoN,1 point,Tue Nov 11 00:42:18 2014 UTC,Photoshop is the way to go. It has a reputation as the image manipulation program but it's a beast when it comes to digital painting too.

It runs a cut-down version of Photoshop, but it's more than enough for a beginner, and you can draw right on the screen with pressure sensitivity (normal tablets are useless for art).   So, if you have the cash, a pen-based screen, like Wacom or the Note is worth your money.   Other than that, Photoshop is great, but there's nothing wrong with Gimp either."
