CalgaryFlames,3e4w2l,Polymarchos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"Well, his Vezina trophy voting record alone is amazing. One win and constant top 3 - top 10 finishes. He was consistently a top goalie in the league for wins and sv%, and has the best GAA season on record (04). His career wasn't as long as other Hall of Fame goalies, but he was almost always at the top of the league when he was playing, and he was HEAVILY used (70+ games a season). Given that, he has an outside shot in a weaker year, but it's unlikely.   Had Gelinas' goal counted (#itwasin), and Kipper won his deserved and rightful Cup and Conn Smythe, he would definitely be HoF worthy. So basically, he is a HoF goalie, but that goddamn no goal call fucked him over."
CalgaryFlames,3e4w2l,alivirji,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:29:27 2015 UTC,Mark Howe and  Igor Larionov made it.  Anyone can.   Unfortunately Kipper never had the attention of the sports writers especially in the East.  He probably would have needed to win a cup.
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,Waldo76,8,Tue Jul 21 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"It's almost a futile effort ranking our prospects after Bennett at this point. It's so tough to rank D against forwards and both of them against goalies, especially when an undrafted guy like Morrison becomes one of our best prospects. Not to mention trying to rank talent versus NHL readiness (e.g. Kylington vs. Wotherspoon).    I just love that we now have several quality prospects at every position."
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,canadam,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:55 2015 UTC,Go Poirier go!
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,95accord,3,Tue Jul 21 22:43:22 2015 UTC,"No Bill Arnold? I would think he is defintely in the top 10, his development seems to be the good ""slow-cooker"" style, it's takign a while, but he is becomign a complete centre this way, so when he makes the NHL jump he will stay and be consistent AF."
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,Dramon,5,Tue Jul 21 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"No Jankowski, Kylington, or Andersson either. Rafikov might deserve a spot too. It's just too difficult to put a top 10 together."
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,canadam,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:17 2015 UTC,Do you think we'll see more Porier in the NHL this year? As a bit more of a regular call up? Or will he be about the same as last year?
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,BcD-,3,Tue Jul 21 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"I'd rather he stay in the AHL for a while. We already have a log jam of NHL ready forwards, and a pretty set top 6 (Boyz N Da Hud, Bennett-Backlund-Frolik, Raymond and Byron as extras in case of injury). Poirier will get top line minutes and responsibility in Stockton, and will have more time to refine his skills at both ends of the rink. He's only 20 years old, and even Gaudreau didn't enter the league till age 21. We have been spoiled by Monahan and Bennett, but most players need 3-4 season after their draft to come into the NHL, even 1st rounders. Poirier has a ton of raw skill, and is doing really well in the AHL, but his brief call up and development camp have shown that he still needs to refine his game before making the big club. Also, depending on if we can afford to re-sign Hudler, there might be a top 6 spot ready for him next year."
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,alivirji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"So at this point he's ""ready"" for a bottom six role, but will do much better development wise in Stockton?"
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,BcD-,3,Tue Jul 21 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"Kind of. All of this is my opinion, but the way I see it is that he has NHL skill, and has proven he can score in the pros (42 points in 55 AHL games in his rookie season is really good). However, he is a top 6 player, not a bottom 6 player. With his high speed, high skill, offensive style of play, he needs top 6 minutes to succeed/develop properly. Since he won't get that in Calgary, he'll be much better off in Stockton. He is ""ready"" for a bottom 6 role in Calgary skill wise, but he needs to refine his skills and 200 foot game to be truly NHL ready. The AHL is the best place for a highly skilled, unrefined player like him to develop. The reason the Red Wings are so good at development is that they keep their prospects in the AHL until they are 100% ready to step into the NHL in the role they need. We can't make the same mistake we did with Baertschi, where we called him up too early based on his unrefined yet very large amount of offensive skill, and then stuffed him into a bottom six role when we realized that his 200 foot game wasn't ready for the NHL yet.   We have no need for Poirier yet, so it's best to keep him the the AHL until he is 100% ready. He is still very, very young."
CalgaryFlames,3e387v,alivirji,2,Tue Jul 21 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think he's gotta get some call-ups, even for a bottom six role, just to stay familiar with the NHL level of play and recognize where he's got to get his game to."

CalgaryFlames,3e387v,winkylems,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"If he comes to play at camp, I wouldn't be surprised to see him crack the opening roster. We talk about having a log-jam at forward, but really we're lacking real scoring threats as it stands. To close out last season, the top line carried the team - we can't expect that to happen, especially with other teams coming prepared to play against them.  Realistically, I think we have two scoring wing spots open for the taking. Assuming the lines look like:  1) Gaudreau - Monahan - Hudler  2a) ??? - Bennett - ???  2b) Colborne - Backlund - Frolik  4) Bouma - Stajan - Jooris  In this scenario:    The line I've labeled 2b would get the toughest minutes on the team, and probably put up TOI similar to the top line  Line 2a would get more sheltered minutes (to help Bennett develop) and would need to be a secondary scoring line.    Looking at the players we have, Raymond and Jones would naturally slot into the LW and RW spots, respectively. However, if those guys don't bring it out of camp, or if Jooris doesn't, there could be a wing spot open. That would open up opportunities for Ferland, Poirier, [Byron], and Shore.   We have a ton of good depth wingers, but we're lacking secondary scoring. Poirier is one of few Flames prospects who is talented enough to fill one of those slots."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,Tigers_3Iron,10,Mon Jul 20 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"Im going to go against everyone here and say a first and two young guys seems like a ton for JVR.  Two upper end young guys, or two mediocre prospects and a second in my mind.  I may be way off though.  Tell me why!"
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,theFlamingRaven,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"Proven top-six talent is very tough to find. While you can really hit with first round picks, most don't turn into anything great. That drafting analysis /u/TIFUByJoiningReddit has been doing over in /r/hockey shows that only ~60% of players drafted between the 11th and 30th picks play more than 100 NHL games.  Two prospects or young players may or may not fit into an NHL line-up, and that's risky in itself if you're Toronto and departing with a player like JVR. I think you need a first rounder in their to add more upside for the Leafs."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,canadam,-2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"They won't tell you why because he's a shiny object in their Nintendo games.  The team as assembled is the way forward. If there is a deal involving lesser prospects and a vet, fine, let's see what he can do."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,Aplicado,11,Tue Jul 21 00:53:38 2015 UTC,Raymond and Egghead for JVR. LOL

CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,Svenka,9,Tue Jul 21 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"He fills a hole in our lineup on the left side behind Johnny, and his contract is reasonable. I'd be interested if the price made sense, but I wouldn't overpay for him. Talking to Leafs fans about it is almost absurd... guys were suggesting Bennett +, but those are the same fans that said Phil would bring in multiple 1sts and top prospects."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,Circlesmirk,12,Mon Jul 20 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"JVR is on a very good contract, so the asking price for him would be very high. However, there's zero chance the Leafs would receive a prospect of Bennett's caliber for him. I could see at first and two B level prospects."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,canadam,4,Mon Jul 20 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"I agree... something like Granlund, Sieloff, and a 1st? I could probably live with that."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,Circlesmirk,2,Mon Jul 20 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I personally would think that's reasonable. JVR's numbers aren't out of this world. He would be a great 2nd line LW for us, but I can't see him being more than that."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,canadam,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:46:27 2015 UTC,Why not a 2nd and Jankowski?  I don't want to become one of those teams with no 1st rounders.
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,marbsarebad,4,Mon Jul 20 23:51:33 2015 UTC,That assumes they'd take a 2nd and Jankowski - personally I don't think they would.
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,canadam,6,Tue Jul 21 00:02:16 2015 UTC,"Meh, I'd rather keep Djanko Unchained personally. He is an exciting prospect with high boom or bust potential,  and he's been showing lately that he's moving more and more into the boom category. That top tier 3rd line center that we are going to need. Imagine a center lineup of Monahan-Bennett-Backlund-Jankowski. That looks so nice to me."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,Pretty_Fly_For_A_,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:54 2015 UTC,Janko is still a first tier prospect for me
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,JESUS_WALKS,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"It's not absurd. JVR was a second overall pick (higher than Bennett) and has turned into a bona fide NHL all-star on a terrible team who has trended upward every year. Still  young and much bigger than Bennett. JVR is also on a great contract and fills a hole that the Flames have.   I'm not saying its absolutely necessary for the trade, but its not insane. Everyone overvalues prospects."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,rodionbonaparte,8,Mon Jul 20 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"1) JVR hasn't lived up to expectations of a number two overall pick. He scored 30 goals and 61 points in his best season - not outstanding - while playing with Kessel. In his six year career, he's scored at 0.61PPG pace. He's not a bona fide all-star, he's a bonafide top-six forward that could slide into the first line LW spot on some teams.  2) JVR is 26, and he's 6'3"" and 200lbs. Bennett just turned 19 and he's 6'1"" 185lbs. The size difference already isn't huge, Bennett will inevitably fill out, and he plays with the tenacity to make it seem like he's 6'4"" and 210lbs.   3) Bennett was the number one rated player by central scouting at the time of the draft. His ceiling is that of an elite player. After missing almost an entire season with shoulder surgery, he put up 24 pts in 11 games in junior. He then proceeded to look like a full-time NHLer in the NHL playoffs. He's one of the highest ranked prospects in the NHL, and he is worth more than a 2nd-line LW power forward.  Most people overvalue B and C level prospects. Prospects with franchise-level talent are almost impossible to come by, and they aren't overrated."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,canadam,4,Tue Jul 21 00:01:40 2015 UTC,"100% agreed, Bennett for JVR straight up would be a bad deal for the Flames. There's honestly not a lot of deals involving Bennett that would make much sense, especially given the price paid for Hamilton, who is way more valuable than JVR."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,RDC123,4,Tue Jul 21 03:59:31 2015 UTC,How great would it be if we dumped Engelland and MayRay's salary in the process? I hope Treliving makes this work
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,TJYoshi,3,Tue Jul 21 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"He would definitely  solidify our top 6, I haven't watched him enough to see how his 2 way game is but he would add fire power to that left side.  I really don't have a clue what the trade would be, I could only think 2016 draft picks and maybe 1 middle of the pack prospect, It'd be kind of a wierd situation because Leafs are pretty keen on a rebuild so I doubt they'd take any of our aging forwards or defense and Treliving has been pretty adamant about not trading away prospects or assets."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,iChron,6,Mon Jul 20 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"Of course he would be worthwhile, but the cost would be stupid.  We would be set at forward for the next 10 years, though (as well as defence).  Edit:  forgot he was 26.  So set for like 5 years.  The cost would involve a 1st and a prospect at minimum"
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,marbsarebad,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:06 2015 UTC,"Pass. We don't need to trade a 1st or more for a guy who's very overrated offensively, a possession blackhole and a defensive liability in general. Have some faith in our prospects."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,DestroDertell,4,Tue Jul 21 12:00:44 2015 UTC,I think a trade of next year's 1st + Markus Granlund and say Tyler Wotherspoon would be enough.
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,MattFiresideChat,3,Mon Jul 20 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"I'd try to do it with a different D prospect, but I think you're right in the ball park."
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,Circlesmirk,2,Mon Jul 20 22:30:43 2015 UTC,I'd be fine losing Wotherspoon if it meant JVR the other way.  He's one of my favorite players.
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,marbsarebad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:25 2015 UTC,maybe a 2017 first plus those two? a mid-to-late first rounder wouldn't be bad to give up
CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,raftman23,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think he would fit, I would think we would need to trade away one of our younger forwards (Jooris/granlund/shore?) and a pick for him though. We already have a log jam of forwards competing for a job and wanting to be paid 1 way contracts. As explained here:  http://flamesnation.ca/2015/7/20/look-at-all-those-forwards-d9d9cb75-4a20-4010-a7d8-2fab4809d896  I don't want us to give up our first, we can not fall back into the routine of consistently trading away firsts, that was a contributing factor to us getting into a mess."

CalgaryFlames,3dzs10,CerealisDelicious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:44:28 2015 UTC,Widemen is selling fairly high with his performance last year. Him and a prospect should be more than enough without throwing in the 2nd and salary retention imo.

He's the best forward (skill/work ethic) that Toronto has. I've actually (living in Leafs/Habs country) had many discussions on him this summer. I have argued that Toronto should demote Dion of Captain and that they should name JVR. JVR is at a prime age, he's a big building piece that the Laughs could build around with some of their younger core, Kadri, rielly etc.  Just breaking down his stats here:  Last season he was 27th in league goals, and 58th in points and he shoots the puck A LOT! 20th in the league. He's a big bodied kid who would slot in right away into our line up.   Who would we use as bait? I think they are definitely going to want to get back playable players and a pick."

CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,bluntoclock,5,Mon Jul 20 14:52:18 2015 UTC,"Deals done through arbitration are only for one year right? So it doesn't really matter what we pay him if it's a one year contract since we have lots of cap room this year and not next year.  Give him 1.75m to 2m for this year, sign him next year to whatever we can afford, if we can afford it after signing Monahan, Gaudrea, Gio, etc."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,rpawson5771,4,Mon Jul 20 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"It can be for one year or two years. The party being filed against (in this case, the Flames) can request either from the arbitrator."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,bluntoclock,2,Mon Jul 20 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"Safe to assume that the Flames would want one year? Great way to get a second look at Bouma's true value, but more importantly one small step towards dealing with the impending cap issues of next year."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,teckhz,5,Mon Jul 20 14:52:27 2015 UTC,I bet if bouma is willing to take 1.75 or something then the flames would be fine with 3-4 years.
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,rpawson5771,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think one year will be the request. I think any longer takes Bouma to UFA."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,Dramon,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"A one year deal accomplishes a lot of things, obviously what you mentioned, but also if they choose to retain him this contract is a way of saying ""you did an amazing job for the roles and responsibilities we gave you, let's see you do that again and then you get your pay day"""
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,bluntoclock,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"And, if he performs well next year, the payday will be much bigger than it would be this year given our cap problems will be behind us in 2016-17."

I expected him to be looking for an AAV near Stajan, plus or minus 1 or 2 hundred thousand.   If the Flames can sign him for 3 years at a shade over 2 million, that would be a really nice signing.   Bouma will likely regress this year but he is definitely a big middle six winger. He is definitely worth a shade over 2 million right now."

CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,coldb_too,2,Tue Jul 21 02:48:56 2015 UTC,3yr/6.3 (2.1 per annum) Sounds perfect to me.
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,alivirji,7,Mon Jul 20 17:32:24 2015 UTC,"Arbitration allows only for one or two year deals. I think he deserves a 1 year prove it deal to show his last season wasn't a fluke. Also, we need to be careful on the cap for all the raises we need to give out next season."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,larsy87,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"If I were him, I'd be pissy, because last year was a 1 year ""show me"" deal, and now the brass wants another one? At this rate he'll end up a 40 goal scorer, riding nothing but show me deals."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,alivirji,7,Mon Jul 20 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"If he wants a long term deal, he should expect to be paid for his long term performance. Since he's really only had 1 good offensive season, it was would stupid to sign him long term expecting that production. If he wants to be paid as 30-40 point player, he needs to prove that it wasn't an anomaly of a season that was enhanced by playing with Backlund and having a high shooting %. If he replicates his success this year, then we pay him 3rd liner money long term, and he'll deserve it. If he regresses, we pay him 4th liner money long term. If he wants a long term deal right now, we pay him 4th liner money long term right now, since he's definitely proven his worth as a 4th liner, but not yet as a 3rd liner long term.   Unfortunately for guys like him (bottom 6 players who came into the league late), long term deals are hard to come by. I really like Bouma as a 4th line heart and soul guy with a touch of offense, but it'd be stupid to over pay him for one good, statistically defiant season. If he didn't have such a good season, he'd be getting a long term deal right now, but since he had a break out season, a long term deal at the value of a 3rd liner is off the table until he proves it for another season."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,chodes_r_us,3,Mon Jul 20 19:05:23 2015 UTC,I really don't understand everyone's freak out over Bouma getting paid 1.5 or 2 mil. Its 500k. You literally can't get a single player for that amount since league min is 550. I've said it before but a player making around 2 mil long term will never cripple a franchise. We're not talking Bickell size contract here. I still think the ideal is 4 years at 2 mil
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,alivirji,4,Mon Jul 20 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"Those 500k differences add up. 2 players who are overpaid by 500k can be the difference between re-signing Hudler next year or letting him walk (ex: he wants 6 million but we can only afford 5 million). We are going to be a cap-pressed team before long, and giving out long term contracts to bottom 6 players is the worst thing a cap team can do, because those contracts are hard to trade, and usually those players are replaceable.   Boston giving longer contracts to 'heart and soul' guys like Kelly and Paille is what caused their cap troubles that lost them Hamiton. Chicago overpaying Bickell made them lose Oduya. In the salary cap era, long term contracts should only be given to true top 6 forwards or top 4 dmen, because those players make up your core and are hard to come by. The bottom 6 and 3rd pairing can easily be filled up with rookies on ELCs or discount signings. This strategy is what has made Chicago a dynasty, despite three separate cap-forced team makeovers. It's also why drafting is so essential in today's league.  I'm not saying Bouma is easily replaceable or not valuable, but paying him more than 2 ELC contracts worth is an overpayment, unless he can prove that he truly is a 30-40 point player. Otherwise, 1.5 million is plenty for a guy like him."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,chodes_r_us,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"Right that's one way to look at it but I would rather ""overpay"" someone by 500k and be smart about FA signings ie no Raymond and no Engelland and all of a sudden you have more than enough cap space to sign a Hudler. I think those are much more devastating than paying a heart and soul guy like Bouma peanuts in terms of full time NHLer salary. I mean shit if you can get a guy that is a reliable bottom six that doesn't take stupid penalties and has an offensive upside he's definitely worth 2 million long term. Especially if the cap goes up (which it eventually will)."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,alivirji,4,Mon Jul 20 21:27:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, but wouldn't you rather be both smart about FA signings AND not overpay? You can't really justify one mistake by saying it's not AS bad as another mistake."
CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,chodes_r_us,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"Sure but I've never ever heard a guy making 2 mil be called overpayed by their fan base. Bickell's 4 mil?

CalgaryFlames,3dy6u0,chodes_r_us,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"I mean let's look at the core of our bottom six: Backlund is at what? 3.3 ish, Bouma at 2 ish, jooris will be under 2, Jones will be gone by next year with Shore replacing him (another 1ish). Stajan's contract is probably the worst of the bunch if we're being frank and even that one isn't franchise crippling.  At the end of the day I just don't believe it's worth the fight to save pennies when the real dollars are lost making stupid FA signings."

He was asked to ""prove"" himself last season and did and I think it's a disservice to ask him to ""prove"" it's not a fluke.  He exceeded a lot of expectations to the point in which I think we missed him in the playoffs.   2.5 is a bit much IMO though."

CalgaryFlames,3dvtqu,voteharvey,3,Sun Jul 19 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, love it. Thanks!  Although seems like a ranking out of 10 would have been easier than out of 5 (since you're using quarter points).  The scale is also a little confusing to me when you state that 2.5 is average NHL level. Since almost all of the prospects have ratings higher than 2.5, it would imply that they are all already better than an average NHLer... which obviously isn't the case since most won't be able to even crack the lineup."
CalgaryFlames,3dvtqu,Roughly6Owls,2,Sun Jul 19 23:44:28 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking as well -- the scale and it's context points need some revision.
CalgaryFlames,3dvtqu,Roughly6Owls,2,Sun Jul 19 23:57:18 2015 UTC,"a mid rating like that is a skill that a 4th line player would have. Below that is AHL level. You can have an average or below average skill or two, but still be a very good player. 3-3.5 is more 3rd/2nd line ability and anything over 4 is top notch.   I will refine that for next year when I do this again.   Usually for a player to stick in the NHL they need to have more things in the 3's than in the 2's. A player that would have 2.5's across the board would be your 1 time cup of coffee guy that plays 1-2 games and is never heard from again."
CalgaryFlames,3dvtqu,Maxim403,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:04:26 2015 UTC,"Also, it is their raw tools. Players can have good tools and not put it all together. Players that have higher ratings should be breaking into the NHL soon. Whether they stick is another thing.  Look at Sven for example. He has a lot of skill but couldn't figure it out."
CalgaryFlames,3dvtqu,Maxim403,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"A player that would have 2.5's across the board...    So a 2.5er should be described as a consistent AHL player, not as an NHL-average player -- your rating system should have David Wolf right around the average for most of the metrics based on what you just said, but he should probably also be higher than Pavel Karnaukhov, who you said in your own review needs at least a couple years of seasoning -- with how you've written the reviews, there just isn't room for that -- Karnaukhov's already above the NHL-baseline of 2.5 on average.  I'd like to make it clear now that I'm not trying to sound hostile. I really appreciate what you've done. Your writing is concise and well-done. I understand that you worked hard on this. However, I have a passion for numbers and how they work, and I do think that this could be a better resource in that sense. What's the point of ranking people on a 1-5 scale when you assigned only a single value below 1.75 in the entire group of 24 prospects (by the way, it was Kylington's defensive skill)? I didn't do the math, but a quick eye test suggests that only Riley Bruce (19) was below the the average score of 22.5 (which is 2.5*9) by more than one full point -- DeBlouw and Ollas Mattsson receive honourable mentions for their 22 and 22.5 respectively.  Put another way: compare Karnaukhov to Nakladal's review -- Nakladal's numbers add to 25.5, Karnaukhov's add to 25, every single number for both of them is between 2.5 and 3.5. Why is one of them potentially a seventh defenseman next season even if he might not have a high ceiling, while the other needs three-four years to be a fourth liner?  Or, you can compare Andersson (28.25) to Nakladal, if you want to stay within a position -- again, Nakladal's NHL-ready, and Andersson isn't, by your own review.   Maybe the problem is that Nakladal basically fucks up every defense ranking, because if he's correctly placed and no one else is truly ready for NHL time then there's a disconnect somewhere, because I'm pretty sure that Nakladal's only ahead of Bruce and Ollas Mattsson and maybe (barely) Gilmour in terms of sum ranks.  This is a point of contention for professional movie reviewers (when was the last time the Calgary Herald ranked a movie as 1 star?), video games journalism (the 0-100 or 5 star scale often is 70-10 or 3.5-5 stars), and all sorts of critique."
CalgaryFlames,3dvtqu,Driize,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:24:22 2015 UTC,"I know it has it's flaws.  A guy like Nakladal isn't what I would consider a full time NHL player for example, a bubble guy basically like Potter or Diaz from last year.   It is also hard to quantify ""readiness"", that's why I put that separate from their talent. A player can be talented but need refining of those skills.   None of the players stood out as complete disasters either, believe me I am very critical of players, but the Flames do seem to have an almost absurd amount of depth and talent. Most of the walk on players would have had 1's and low 2's except Hawkins, Bailey and Pitt. I didn't bother writing them up because they are not likely going anywhere."
CalgaryFlames,3dvtqu,95accord,2,Mon Jul 20 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Hey man this is awesome, thank you!  Quick question re: Kylington, you have his skating at a 3.75/5 - I've read on a bunch of other prospect websites that his skating is considering beyond elite. Was there simply a bit too much hype about his skating? Or is 3.75/5 considered elite?  Really like the reads though, great work!"
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,baatolo,15,Sun Jul 19 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"Neither Gillies nor McDonald are likely to be ready for the NHL next season.   Treliving was reportedly exploring the market for a medium term goalie, before Talbot and Jones both got moved.   The subsequent cooldown of the market likely meant Treliving also would not get the desired return for Hiller immediately.   Signing Ramo allows Treliving to wait on the market for a bit, and see if it heats up again during training camps, preseason, and the early regular season. That market improvement may mean he gets the desired return.   If no other goalies become available and one of the Flames goalies can't be moved early, the signing gives the team a known tandem that know each other and the team is comfortable with. And Treliving then has flexibility to pursue a medium term goalie all season in preparation for next year. And he'll do so with more information on all three goalies, his goalie prospects, and the state of the goalie market around the league."
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,rpawson5771,9,Sun Jul 19 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"If anyone moves it's likely to be Hiller - he's a little pricier, but Calgary can easily retain his salary, and odds are there will be a team or two looking for a veteran to either backup or mentor their younger goalies.  I don't really understand why GMBT resigned Ramo - sure, he may have been better than Hiller down the stretch, but this leaves us in a pretty uncomfortable situation. We can't send Ortio down, period. Young goalies nearing the end of the pipeline are valuable to pretty much every team. Someone will grab him."
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,Kellervo,11,Sun Jul 19 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly. The sample size for Ortio is too small and Hiller is inconsistent. Whether it's 2 or 3 goalies, none have proven they're elite. We need another Kipper if we want to get to that next level.   edit: Now we have more options though."
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,coldb_too,2,Sun Jul 19 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"The mention of Kiprusoff tugs on my heart strings.

CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,MasteroftheHallows,7,Mon Jul 20 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"Here's my break down on the Ramo signing.  It is a No Lose deal for the Flames orginization.  Regardless of how the line up is at Game 1, the Flames will be stronger. Here is why   Signing Ramo to one year  doesn't effect our long term resignings of players we need (Gradeau, Monahan etc) It gives us the best possible combo of Ramo, Hiller or Ortio in net come game 1. If Ortio doesn't look good in Training camp, then we can send him down through waivers with more cofindence he won't be picked up. If Ramo or Hiller suck it up, well we can trade or cut them.  By letting him walk, the Flames get nothing. By signing him, the Flames have a chance at getting something. If he doesn't play better then Hiller, we can trade him for anything, even a conditional 7th rounder. Signing Ramo gives us a least a trade chip."
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,Buksey,2,Sun Jul 19 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"It is a Lose deal if the Flames lose Ortio for nothing (waivers). But I guess that's my whole point, and maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. But it feels like we're signing Ramo (for a year) and giving away Ortio.   I'm starting to think I've overestimated the value of Joni Ortio..."
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,Buksey,3,Sun Jul 19 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"The way I see it at the moment is Ortio is going to be back up woth Hiller and Ramo fighting for a job. Now if Ortio plays in preseason, and doesn't impress that might almost be the best option for the Flames.  If he is unimpressive, than either he doesn't have what it takes to be a #1 option and we can focus on signing someone else; or when he is sent down other teams won't want to pick him up because he is risky. Remember, any team that picks him up would have to keep him on their NHL roster and have to figure out a goalie situation.  Trevling has done good so far in decision making. If he thinks Ortio is NHL ready and our future, he will find a way to protect him."
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,rpawson5771,2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"I trust Treliving to have his fingers on the pulse of the goalie and waiver markets before he attempts to send Ortio down, if he does."

CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,ThatObviousDude,0,Sun Jul 19 22:12:58 2015 UTC,Ramo proved himself in the playoffs. Hiller choked. Keep Ramo.
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,DestroDertell,3,Sun Jul 19 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"Ramo Save% in the playoff: 90.6  Hiller's: 91.9  I feel like some people just ignore Game 76-81 which was basically the opposite of chocking. I would even say Hiller carried us to the playoff with a Save% of 94.27 (95.24% at even strength and 95.37% ajusted, if you're curious)."
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,teckhz,4,Mon Jul 20 01:21:23 2015 UTC,Hiller played very well in the Canucks series. Ramo played average in the ducks series.
CalgaryFlames,3duy9s,MattFiresideChat,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:11:14 2015 UTC,"Ortio has been borderline terrible at the beginning of the last two seasons (He started in the ECHL 2 years ago because he was terrible). The Flames can't have a goalie that has the same problem that Iginla used to. Ramo is insurance on whether Ortio can come into the season prepared or not.   If Ortio does come in prepared and looks good, I would expect 1 of  Hiller/Ramo to get moved to a team needing a goalie after camp."

However, I'm doubtful that all those players can have breakout seasons together. I'm not sure we can score enough goals to allow for all those breakouts!   I'll be happy to eat my words though."
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,alivirji,3,Sun Jul 19 03:13:19 2015 UTC,Most of these players that are going to have a breakout season came off a really good season or struggled with injuries and are coming in to their prime.   I believe
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,alivirji,12,Sun Jul 19 04:56:24 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I agree that they all can have breakout seasons. I just question the likelihood of all of them having them in the same season with only a couple regressions."

CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,voteharvey,4,Sun Jul 19 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"I love the optimism, but you just listed off 10 players that would possibly have 20+ goal seasons. That would almost be an NHL record and would be the most of any team since like the 70s or maybe 80s. To recap your predictions;  Monahan: 30-35  Johnny: 20+  Huds: 25+  Frolik: 20+  Joe C: 20+  Backs: 20+  Mayray: maybe 20+  Bennett: 20  Brodie: 20  Dougie: 20"
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,voteharvey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:39:06 2015 UTC,Note that I mentioned maybe and possibly to those. Mainly because of injuries. These players I named have the skill to score these amount of goals. The matter of injuries really affect it. Especially for Backlund.
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,jibbybonk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that they all have the potential to, but realistically if we have half those guys put up 20G, we will be among the best in the league.

CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,metalhead4,6,Mon Jul 20 01:28:23 2015 UTC,"I am going with a bit more negative approach in my prediction.  The team will regress as a whole. We have brought in 2 major players who have played in different systems than our own. They will be given important minutes, but will take time to adjust to our style of play. As a result the whole team will be regress just a bit.   We won't see our team work effectively together until the end of the season. Coming to the end of the regular season we will be in a similar spot as to last year. We might make it, but it will come down to the last few games.  I sincerely hope I am wrong though."
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,theFlamingRaven,5,Sun Jul 19 06:11:47 2015 UTC,"Very reasonable.    However, I feel their styles and attitude already mesh very well with the flames style and don't feel the on ice changes will be all that difficult for them to adjust to.  If anything I actually feel the change is going to be what pushes them to new and better perfomances from both of them."
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,kapxis,5,Sun Jul 19 09:37:16 2015 UTC,There are a lot of guys competing for spots on this team. Earned not given rings through that dressing room. I don't see much regression to be honest. Hartley won't allow it. Management won't allow it. This team is all about hard work and one off season isn't gonna change that.
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,spumpkin914,3,Sun Jul 19 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"Very fair, very reasonable prediction.  I do see what you're saying.  I do however think that Hartley is the reason this team blends so well and I see him bringing the new guys in and having them working fluidly in training camp.  I think that Dougie will thrive better than Frolik in the early stages of the season, by the end though I think we will all have Frolik ragers."
CalgaryFlames,3dssqx,coldb_too,4,Sun Jul 19 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"Hope Raymond can step it up again also. I was going to pick his name as my jersey at the start of the season, but just never ended up doing it.  Guys always on my NHL 15 team though ;)"

CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,marbsarebad,5,Sat Jul 18 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"Ramo, Hiller, and Jones are also off the books next year, which opens up about 12.3 mil in cap space alone, and I'm sure there are others. We will be fine."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,superdude99,7,Sat Jul 18 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"trade widemen (pls) , his value will never be higher"
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,vayuu,4,Sat Jul 18 04:07:33 2015 UTC,"$32.5M - $35M to sign Gio, Hudler(?), Russell, Monahan, Gaudreau, 2 goalies, Colborne, and other RFAs. That's $4M-$4.25M AAV for 8 positions, with Gio, Monahan, and Gaudreau all poised to make more than $4M AAV."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,rpawson5771,5,Sat Jul 18 04:50:26 2015 UTC,"But all of Colborne, Ortio, and most of the RFAs aren't going to touch 2.5m, much less 4m. Russell won't make more than 3.5, unless BT's feeling really generous.  EDIT: List of RFA's needing to be re-signed:  Roster Forwards: Colborne, Granlund, Shore, probably Bouma, Byron, Ferland and Jooris depending on the status of contract talks.   Roster Defense: Wotherspoon. Nakladal's a UFA next season.  Roster Goalies: Ortio.  Non-roster Players: Agostino, Arnold, van Brabant.   I don't see anyone in this list making more than 3m next year unless Bouma or Colborne puts together a 50 point season -- I just don't see anyone else who'll get the NHL exposure (i.e. top-6 minutes, competing with Gaudreau/Monahan/Hudler/Frolik/Backlund/Bennett/Raymond/Jones) to do so, unless Jooris/Frolik have crazy chemistry and become our #1 shutdown line."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,Roughly6Owls,3,Sat Jul 18 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"Good points, as always. I stopped at the average to re-sign each spot because I didn't want to speculate how much each player would make, other than Gio, Monahan, and Gaudreau probably being >$4M.    I think this could be a bit of a challenge, but I think Treliving is more than capable of rising to it."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,rpawson5771,5,Sat Jul 18 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"It seemed unfair to be like ""well, we've got 4m/player"" and then mention only the guys making more than that, without mentioning that most of the players being mentioned won't get even close."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,Roughly6Owls,2,Sat Jul 18 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I certainly didn't mean for it to come across that way, but I'm glad you called me on it."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,rpawson5771,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"There's no way Russell makes less that 4 million on his next contract unless he has a horrible year. UFA top 4 defensemen demand a lot on FA and unless there are tons of top 4 guys in FA next year, he might even be able to push 5 or more.   Just look at Wideman's salary. He got 5.25x5 and is a similar skill level to Russell. Anything less than 4.5 is a steal for Russell and would have to be a hometown discount.   Granted he might go for that just to stay close to home, but to say he will take 3.5 and anything more is ""being generous"" is a little off."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,enag7,2,Sun Jul 19 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"Wideman isn't really comparable -- he was a defenseman who averaged ~.5PPG (251p in 535g) over his career before he came to Calgary. Russell's currently at .31PPG.   There are lots of other stats that go into contract negotiations, but points are one of the most important metrics -- keep in mind that Mike Green made far more money in free agency than any other defenseman who wasn't paid by Edmonton.  If Russell actually deserves four million, we'll need to let him walk. We can't afford to pay every one of our top-5 defenseman more than 4 million. There'll be replacements in free agency -- there always is."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:12:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think that you can just dismiss Sekera just because he was signed by Edmonton. Most people felt that he would get around that much. Even if you don't want to count that, just look at last year where Orpik got 5.5/year. While I agree that points get you money easier, there are plenty of defensive-minded guys that get paid in FA.   If we do let him walk we would need to replace him, unless someone really steps up next year. And while there will be replacements in FA they would likely be more expensive or a significant downgrade over Russell.   At 4 million per year I think we have to keep Russell. There are enough teams that are spending 4+/year on their top four and succeeding that I would say it would be worth having. The Rangers, Habs and Kings (if you count when the had Voynov) all have top 4 with player making north of 4 million. Maybe if the cap fails to go up we might get him for 3.75/year but I honestly feel that getting Russell at 4/year isn't that bad for us and would still make him tradeable if we need to move him."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,enag7,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:10 2015 UTC,"I think Russell is gone after this year. He's a good character guy, but he's also small and a possession sieve, two things GMBT is really seeking to correct. And he'll be at least $3M when cheaper options like Wotherspoon and others are ready for the NHL."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,radiomonkey21,2,Sat Jul 18 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a possibility. His inclusion in the leadership core muddies things, but the consideration of a young player or recent addition being able to step into that group should also factor in to the decision."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,rpawson5771,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"I really don't think his absence would be detrimental. Neither would Wideman's, honestly. By the end of next season, one of Monahan, Backlund, Gaudreau, Bennett or Hamilton will be worthy of an 'A'. Giordano is the constant."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,radiomonkey21,4,Sun Jul 19 08:41:28 2015 UTC,"Well we have a damn good GM with a really good business background, I dont think we need to worry about cap issues."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,bretttacular,4,Sat Jul 18 05:03:45 2015 UTC,"It's way too early to be concerned about this. We still have a few months before the beginning of this season.   As others have said, we get Jones off the books next year and likely won't be re-signed.   Hudler may take a slight pay cut or re-sign for 4m since it seems like he loves playing here.   As for Hiller and Ramo, I expect one of them to be dealt or waived early in the season (if not before) because we currently have 3 NHL goalies. I don't see us carrying 3 goalies for very long.  I could also see Raymond waiving his NTC to go somewhere that he'll get more minutes because I expect him to bounce between the 4th line and press box for most of the season.  There's also the possibility of Wideman waiving his NTC as well to go somewhere, but may not be as likely.  BT knows what he's doing. We will be fine in terms of cap space."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,BN_Flames_Fan,4,Sat Jul 18 07:31:09 2015 UTC,"I correct you, you are wrong."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,kingdom529,2,Sat Jul 18 06:59:03 2015 UTC,No. Most of the cap crunch is being caused by players that will depart next season and the year after.   No big deal. It'll just take a shuffling of some players.   I would expect all of  Raymond Jones Engelland Smid Stajan Wideman Hiller Ramo  to be gone after this season.
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,MattFiresideChat,2,Sat Jul 18 10:28:14 2015 UTC,"Here's how things will likely break down after this season  Defense   Giordano (7.5)-Brodie (4.65)  Hamilton (5.75)-Wideman (5.25)  Russell (3.25)-Morrison (1.0)  Wotherspoon (1.0)  Total - 28.3  Goaltending   Hiller (4.5)  Ramo (3.8)   Ortio (1.0)  Gillies (1.0)   Keep one of the two starters and one of the two rookies for say 5 million.   Forwards (some of these are estimations that are in the ballpark)  Gaudreau (6.25) - Monahan (6.25) - Frolik (4.3)  Poirier (.863)-Bennett (3.194)-Colborne (2.0)  Bouma (2.5)-Backlund (3.575)-Shore (1.5)  Ferland (1.2)-Arnold (1.0)-Jooris (1.5)  Total - 34.132  Total for everything is 67.432 and that's without Hudler.

CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,MattFiresideChat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:48:10 2015 UTC,Where do you see Stajan and Raymond going?
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,rpawson5771,2,Sat Jul 18 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"trade both, or worst case on May-Ray is to buy him out which would cost .833 mil per season for 2 years. Not ideal but it's a possibility. Stajan does have value in the league similar to a guy like Shawn Horcoff. Decent 3rd/4th line center that can work with young guys.  Or hope for an expansion draft and problem solved."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,MattFiresideChat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:55:05 2015 UTC,I never even thought about how an expansion draft could open up a lot of caps.
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,peanuts421,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:35 2015 UTC,"Hiller, Ramo, Ortio, Jones, Russell, Hudler, and anyone else who signs 1 year deals (our arbitration guys, possibly) will be off the books -- that's twenty million gone, ignoring Gio, Monahan, and Gaudreau's salaries.  So, we'll be in cap trouble, but only if both of these things happen:  A. Our farm team can't replace Jones, OR Russell and one of those three goalies -- I think it's likely we retain one of them, and I think everyone hopes that's Ortio. B. Based God Treliving can't dump some of our worse contracts with a year left on them -- Engelland's making more than Russell, Smid and Raymond are making almost as much as Ramo and doing far less for us (though I have hope for MayRay), Wideman's currently the second highest paid player on our team -- moving any of these guys in the next year would basically guarantee we can sign both Gaudreau and Monahan while only losing Jones. Bollig's contract is only 1.3m, but it sort of fits here because it's hard to argue he's worth more than Ferland right now (except in intangibles -- dat beard dawg). At the end of the day, after paying Bollig's replacement on the fourth line (which we have to do because someone has to play there), we likely only save max 400k."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"Even if we can't trade away the bad contracts, Hudler gets 5.75M$ and Giordano gets 9M$, we're still in good shape if we buyout Raymond's and Smid's final year."
CalgaryFlames,3dpci3,DestroDertell,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"Jones, Hiller, Ramo and  Hudler come off the books for a combined almost 16 million in space. Also, if Smid is LTIRed, we get another 3 million. That should be barely enough to sign Monahan (5 million raise), Gaudreau (5 million raise), Gio (4 million raise), Russell (1.5 million raise) and Colborne (1.5 million raise). There's also the possibility of bridge contracts, but I think Monny and Gaudreau have already proven themselves and we'd want to lock em up cheap before they become REALLY expensive.   Retaining Hudler will be the tough one. If we can trade Raymond and/or Wideman, and/or Engelland, then we can retain him. Problem is that the first 2 have NTCs, and the 3rd is pretty untradable.   Still, we should be fine. We'll be manageably close to the cap next season, but then we should be fine starting 2016/2017, while retaining all our key players. There'll be very little loss of talent due to cap issues, at least for the next few years."

Burke came in and then he had to change to 27.  So I'm sure SOME players keep their numbers for that reason but I'm sure most keep their junior number / a number that has a meaning of they want."

CalgaryFlames,3dmwg5,youKnowIt101,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:38 2015 UTC,Anybody have a lot k to the full presser?
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,DestroDertell,5,Fri Jul 17 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"The only point I disagree with you a lot on is this one:   Russell's 0.52 p/60 at even strength is nothing special.   While most of your points are fair, this one is a bit of a stretch. You're comparing him to top pairing dmen when you say ""nothing special"". He acquits himself pretty well when you stack him up against other actual 2nd pair d.  When you stack him up against guys like Seth Jones, Vlasic, Gardiner, Sekera, Petry, Hamhuis, Kulikov, Braun, Martinez, Edler, Seabrook, Campbell and Phaneuf  etc. He looks more like a good 2nd pairing dman in terms of point production, or a bad 1st pairing dman in terms of point production, considering he outproduced all of them (not sure about even strength, but applies to almost all of them.)"
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,juridiculous,5,Fri Jul 17 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"Kris Russell's 0.52 even strength p/60 ranks 102th in out of the 129 defensemen who played 1000+ minutes this season. I'm not saying it's a bad number, but saying it's nothing special is not a stretch. Especially in the sense that it doesn't excuse his possession numbers."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,juridiculous,2,Fri Jul 17 20:00:57 2015 UTC,"I think your sample of 1000+ minutes skews things quite a bit. Russell's numbers are an outlier for a number of reasons.  Normally I'd agree with you that 1000+ of evTOI is a good watermark for ""this is the amount of minimum evTOI a 2nd pairing Dman should have"", but Russell hit that mark at 60GP, so did Brodano and Wideman. The Flames were basically rolling 2 D pairings all year.  He had 1483 evTOI, good for 13th in the league among D. Wideman was 12th. Brodie was 5th, and Gio was 99th (pro-rated to 80ish GP would put him in 17th.) No team should have their top 2 pairs in the top 20 TOI.  Let's not forget that Brodie had 0.57p/60, even with much better possession numbers. He was 95 out of 129. He's nothing special."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,juridiculous,3,Fri Jul 17 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"What kind of sample would you prefer? I chose 1000+mins because I wanted more accurate info - pretty sure there's a few AHL players out there who scored some assist in the one game they played this year.  According to war-on-ice.com, Brodie had 0.61p/60 at ES so I'm not sure where you found 0.57. He also faced tougher competition and he was buried in the d-zone with a -8.44 ZSORel%, the opposite is true for Kris Russell with his +8.01 ZSORel%.   BTW, not trying to say Kris Russell is nothing special because of his number of ES points. The reason I brought it up was to compare him with Wideman as it gives the later an significant advantage over him."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,juridiculous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"I was using stats.hockeyanalysis.com - they say 0.57. I don't know which one is better/more accurate. It's still a low number.  My preference would have been 1250+ TOI (only 60 skaters met that threshold). He's clearly on the low end of production for this sub-group. And rightly so... I mean I like the guy, but he can't hang with the likes of Weber, Doughty, Subban, Pietrangelo, etc.  He's a second pairing D guy that got forced into a top pairing role, and he acquitted himself well in that situation.  ZSORel% doesn't carry much weight with me for 3 reasons in point production for Flames players, because:   Centers have to win the puck for zone starts to matter. Our centers mostly sucked this year. If they aren't winning the draw, where you start is irrelevant, because you're heading back into your own zone anyway. The Flames were 26th in FO%. It didn't matter where the puck was dropped, they probably weren't coming up with it anyhow. The Flames had a better defensive zone FO% of 48.9 (of 1824 faceoffs) than offensive zone FO% of 46.6 (of 1677 faceoffs). Meaning they were more likely to come up with the puck in the defensive zone off the draw than in the offensive zone."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,alivirji,2,Fri Jul 17 22:19:28 2015 UTC,"Don't overvalue face-offs. While there is a correlation with points, it's not as great as one would expect."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,NewmanTheScofflaw,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:04:04 2015 UTC,Interesting stuff.
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,MattFiresideChat,5,Sat Jul 18 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's unfair to rate Russell when he has to play with Wideman. Wideman has always been meh defensively. Both analytics and the eye test have proven that. Russell's bad stats could just be a skewed by playing with Wideman. Of course, to be fair, we'd also have to assume that Russell's offensive numbers are a result of Wideman as well. Still, I think Russell is a good 4th dman, but as a team, we should strive for the defensive depth to have him and/or Wideman on the 3rd pairing. I guess we'll see this season how well they play separately.  But by the eye test, Russell is most definitely a top 4. His patience and passing are eerily beautiful to watch. Also, the way he positions himself to lure players into shots that are either blocked, or force to go wide or be easy to save is awesome. (side note, that could also help explain his possession stats)."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,kapxis,2,Fri Jul 17 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"Just a quick question, since I generally agree with you analysis, unless you addressed it and I missed it in the text what effect on Russell's possession stats are affected by Wideman. Because in terms of restructuring, I would send Wideman down one line and keep Russell up because he is more middle of the road defensively and Wideman is too offensively minded."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,teckhz,3,Fri Jul 17 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"Well, to more-or-less sum up my 4th point: Even if Wideman is too offensively minded and a bad possession player himself, Russell was slightly worse at suppressing unblocked shot attempt (-0.06) and scoring chances (-0.04) and Russell's superiority with suppressing high-scoring chances is even smaller (+0.01). Meanwhile, Wideman's offensive superiority obvious in both ES points (1.14 vs 0.52) and scoring chances (+0.68 HSCF60 and +1.06 SCF60)."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,teckhz,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, if the Flames retain Giordano, I would like the Flames to move both Wideman and Russell at some point and allow some of the kids to have the opportunity to play in the NHL. The Flames have 4 guys that are extremely close to being NHL ready (Spoon, Morrison, Kulak, and Culkin) and they will need the opportunity to play in the NHL to take the next step in their development (either to solidify them as NHL players or to move them out of the organization if they don't cut it)   Then we have Hickey, Andersson, and Kylington coming up soon after, so the whole defense corp needs to be shuffled just like the forwards were."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,chodes_r_us,2,Sat Jul 18 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the effort and summaries on this.  It's hard to figure out what to focus on as legit, even with the explanations.    Watching Russel it always feels like he has fairly good awareness, makes good passes and doesn't try to overstep his skill level causing turnovers.    Still, i'm more than happy to take everything into consideration and will always appreciate these kind of in depth write ups as something to consider when watching the games. Curious how i'll feel watching games now if these things will change my outlook on the players.  Can't wait for season to start."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,canadam,2,Sun Jul 19 10:21:55 2015 UTC,"Even when his blocked shots aren't taken into account, Russell managed to be a big negative in the very weak possession game we had.   I don't really understand this statement. Shot blocking is his biggest strength. Of course even when his biggest strength isn't taken to account he's going to look worse."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,chodes_r_us,4,Fri Jul 17 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"The opposite. The logic behind blocking shots being good is it prevents shots from reaching the net. Fair enough.   Problem is, if you still allow a huge amount of unblocked shots and scoring chances relative to the rest of a poor possession team like Kris Russell, then it doesn't matter if you're good at blocking shots."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,chodes_r_us,2,Fri Jul 17 18:54:35 2015 UTC,"So maybe your sentence should say ""Even when his blocked shots are taken into account, Russell managed to be a big negative in the very weak possession game we had."""
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,chodes_r_us,3,Fri Jul 17 19:05:15 2015 UTC,"No because corsi count blocked shots as a negative and people believes his corsi is misleading because of his shot blocking skill. In this context, saying ""Even when his blocked shots aren't taken into account, Russell managed to be a big negative in the very weak possession game we had"" is not wrong."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:28:33 2015 UTC,OK so the other four guys on the ice aren't to blame for the fact that a shot was taken towards our net?   Would you rather a guy get out of the way of a shot or block one when the opposing team shoots?
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,Aplicado,3,Fri Jul 17 19:05:23 2015 UTC,You would have had a point if he fared well relative to his teammates. They're doing better with him off the ice in a fenwick sense.
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,chodes_r_us,2,Fri Jul 17 20:04:01 2015 UTC,"I get your argument about Russell's possession stats, and yes, we do overrate him on this sub. He's a 4-6 defenseman though, he stepped up when we needed him, and he has obvious leadership qualities.   This part here though is ridiculous:   3) has a front office that makes the lack of care about analytic obvious and shows it with their moves 4) they just hired Dave Nonis as adviser 5) he would probably like to make one of his division foes ""weaker"" and Russell is the type of guy most executives love to have on their team   Anaheim is not a bad possession team, DAE NONIS?!?! is just dumb, and I've never ever seen a trade strategy that is designed to make a division rival weaker."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,chodes_r_us,0,Fri Jul 17 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"1) Well, they were 15th on 5vs5 Corsi, Close. Most teams below them are either rebuilding or they have a front office with a similar mindset concerning analytic (like the Rangers iirc).   2) Nobody would trade away picks solely to make a division foe weaker for a single year, but I still see Kris Russell as a guy they'd want on their team."
CalgaryFlames,3dnej3,dddamnet,7,Fri Jul 17 19:09:20 2015 UTC,Did you know that prior to Calgary Kris Russel had a .536 Fenwick with St Louis. What are your thoughts on that? Lucky season? What about his 56% GF differential this year? Clearly goals and preventing goals have no part in how an actual hockey team performs but its a little curious don't you think?

CalgaryFlames,3di966,nexxai,5,Thu Jul 16 14:14:47 2015 UTC,"My takeaway:   Should he not make the Flames and given he just turned 18 that is the most likely outcome, he does have to be offered back to AIK in Sweden's second division, which has him under contract.  However, it's not a sure thing that's where he would end up.  Treliving said the Flames have already begun discussions with AIK and I assure you they're not talking about the price of Lutfisk. Presumably the Flames will try to work out an arrangement with AIK so that they can keep Kylington in North America, either in Stockton in the AHL or with Brandon in the WHL. The Wheat Kings own his rights after recently drafting him in the CHL Import Draft (where interestingly he went 60th, same spot he was picked in the NHL draft)."
CalgaryFlames,3di966,cpbrowner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"I said this a couple days ago -- I think the org wants him in Stockton.  That being said, Kylington and Bennett should just be young gun friends on the line-up and be 1/2 for the Calder next season. That would be better."
CalgaryFlames,3di966,Roughly6Owls,4,Thu Jul 16 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"Treliving seems to place a high value on flexibility in his operations, so I'm glad this signing gives the team some flexibility with regards to Kylington. I don't think there's a wrong place for him to be next season, except for the NHL."
CalgaryFlames,3di966,rpawson5771,4,Thu Jul 16 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"I know every prospect for every team more or less says the same thing, but I still love hearing statements like this,  ""Calgary is a great city.

CalgaryFlames,3di966,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:54:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see him go to the whl and play top end minutes. If he goes to Stockton, he's probably down the depth chart there and won't get nearly the ice time he will in Brandon. If he goes back to Sweden, I could see a similar issue as with him going to the ahl. He would most likely be pushed down the depth chart because they're trying to win, not develop an 18 year old. If he's in the whl, the flames could also keep a much closer eye on him that if he was in Sweden and that'll help him in his development."
CalgaryFlames,3dizjq,trent-henderson,14,Thu Jul 16 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"It was in his best interest. He's uried under our clog-jammed LW position. He'd never play top 6, and Ferland, Bouma, Raymond, Byron are all better than him. In other words it was nice to have a beast like him with a badass name play a couple games, but I'm not overly sad to see him go."
CalgaryFlames,3dizjq,WeedWackHerHedge,4,Thu Jul 16 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"He was one of the best players in Adirondack - third-best points per game among forwards behind Granlund and Poirier, and of course he hit everything in sight. He plays a similar role to Ferland, but his AHL performance was better and he was a solid scorer in the DEL.   It would have been nice to see him get a better chance at the NHL level, especially if he or another player could switch to the right side. Having both him and Ferland in the lineup would put a lot of pressure on opposing defences."
CalgaryFlames,3dizjq,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:32 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I still think this guy has a place in the NHL.  Just not with the flames at this particular point in time.

CalgaryFlames,3dfm0f,cpbrowner,5,Thu Jul 16 00:43:35 2015 UTC,I worry that Bouma is going to price himself out of the Flames willingness to pay.

CalgaryFlames,3deks6,Rooster697,9,Wed Jul 15 18:19:25 2015 UTC,"So he's likely still playing with AIK, although I suppose there's always a chance that he impresses like crazy in training camp."
CalgaryFlames,3deks6,Circlesmirk,5,Wed Jul 15 18:27:28 2015 UTC,If he dominates the rookie tournament and does well in the pre-season he very well may stay up. But let's not get our hopes up
CalgaryFlames,3deks6,Rooster697,6,Wed Jul 15 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"Based on the comments people had on him in the development camp, that's unlikely unless his off-season includes some crazy training."
CalgaryFlames,3deks6,Roughly6Owls,5,Wed Jul 15 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's highly unlikely. Still though, it will be nice to have him play in rookie camp and Penticton"
CalgaryFlames,3deks6,Rooster697,3,Wed Jul 15 18:44:17 2015 UTC,"The AIK contract is only a one-year term, so I think he'll likely play out the season there then maybe finish off the year in Stockton (I believe the timing of the seasons allows for that)."
CalgaryFlames,3deks6,Circlesmirk,3,Wed Jul 15 18:53:11 2015 UTC,"The AIK contract is for two years, and was just signed in March."

I think he should play wherever he would get the most ice time to develop, which looks like WHL at this point.

CalgaryFlames,3deks6,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jul 15 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, he still is unless he plays with the NHL club. The out in his contract doesn't allow him to play in the AHL or the WHL."

CalgaryFlames,3deks6,cpbrowner,3,Wed Jul 15 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, he can't simultaneously have a SHL and a NHL contract, which means his AIK contract was probably voided (likely by some exit clause regarding being signed by a drafted team, i.e. legally).  This means he'll either be in Brandon (WHL, owns his import rights) or Stockton (AHL, our feeder organization). He can go to either, but if he goes to Brandon he can't move up to the AHL until he's 20.  Or maybe he goes to the ECHL? I'm not sure exactly how that works."
CalgaryFlames,3deks6,superdude99,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's why I don't think he'll go play in Brandon, he'd be stuck there for the whole season (and the next?). He might spend some time in the ECHL though"

Even Bergeron's CF increased significantly with the presence of Hamilton. This isnt even the only analysis I've seen showing the positive impact he has on his former teammates. Further more a 55.16 CF60 without bergeron is actually great if you consider how bad the rest of the lines in Boston were this year.  Furthermore, this guys CF/60 count seems to be off.... everyone else has Bergeron + Hamilton at about 64, 76.35 is just an absolutely insane number and would make them the best combination in the league by far."

CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,iChron,10,Thu Jul 16 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"Man these advanced stats are killing it for me.. they act like its a fucking robotic computer program.  Can we also remember that he's 22 years old? No shit he's going to have better stats with one of the best centers in the league, thanks tips! Brodie didnt turn into a real impact player until 23 and that was his 2nd year pro. Hamilton already has 3 behind him  These stats have gotten ridiculousn if thats all people can analyze"
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,iChron,3,Thu Jul 16 07:13:47 2015 UTC,"good players play well together. I'm sure engelland would benefit enormously from playing with Bergeron. so would gio and Brodie. advanced stats help paint the picture, but they aren't everything."
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,raftman23,3,Thu Jul 16 05:46:51 2015 UTC,Advanced stats and analysis like this makes me cringe.
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,Rideyn,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"Well no shit. We know we aren't getting a Dman that will magically fix our possession problems immediately. But he will help fix it along with Frolik, a healthy Gio and a older and wiser Monahan and Johnny. We are getting a very Young, very Good Dman that has a huge amount of growth still and can one day form a amazing pairing with Brodie. He was traded because we needed to solidify our D core now but also solidly it in the future and right now he's a very good 2nd pairing D man with the potential to be a top 2. We aren't looking for him to be 54-56 Corsi wise.  But if he could be 50-53 and bring up the guys he plays with to 50 then that's all we need. That would give us two good possession pairings and with a Monahudleau and BENNETT-Backland-Frolik possision line we have two good sets of 5 that will be playing 30-40 minutes a night. Much better then last year."
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,WeightOfTheheNewYear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I would assume that Gio and Brodie would remain the first pairing anyway."
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,MattFiresideChat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:15:31 2015 UTC,Of course he's a second-pair dman. No disrespect to Hamilton but we have our top pairing already
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,jad35,2,Thu Jul 16 04:49:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Hamilton + Russel is great for line 2.  And Engelland + whichever young blood they want to test/develop for line 3. ( I think this is perfect chance to trade wideman )"
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,kapxis,3,Thu Jul 16 07:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Wotherspoon or Schlemko/Wideman, actually. Give that line some sheltered minutes. Normally you'd be pairing Wotherspoon with a more defensively oriented guy, but this way he might get some good PP time."
CalgaryFlames,3dgx1x,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:41:13 2015 UTC,"I like that also,  but still think now is the time to trade wideman.  He's stock will never be higher and he's too good/paid too much to hang out as 3rd line defensemen.  And we have so many good defensemen looking to crack the roster/get minutes now.  May as well make space and keep engelland there to teach/back them up.  I view Engellend as getting replaced by others also, just not this year unless we have some amazing showings."
CalgaryFlames,3dcjet,Waldo76,3,Wed Jul 15 05:09:19 2015 UTC,To clarify; QO's were signed making these 1 year deals.
CalgaryFlames,3dcjet,donksdonksdonks,3,Wed Jul 15 05:14:34 2015 UTC,"I really hope Arnold doesn't get impatient and leaves before Stajan moves on. The kid put up a pretty good season in the AHL before he went down to injury, and he's a beast at faceoffs.  Our center depth is pretty awesome right now, especially with Janko looking pretty good at the Dev camp. WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIT THEM ALL?"
CalgaryFlames,3dcjet,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"If the rest of our roster (Jooris, Colborne, Bouma, Byron, even Hudler) is any indication, we're just gonna shove 'em on the wings."

We have tons of Cs and a few really good LWs, but after Poirier our RW in particular drops off really fast."
CalgaryFlames,3dcjet,Komskies,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Some of them will probably move to the wing, not as much depth there. It's becoming more and more common for centers to play on the wing. I agree though, we need to make sure we have space for Janko and Arnold, both will be high quality bottom 6 players."

CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,laureth-23,10,Wed Jul 15 01:08:45 2015 UTC,why do you need arguments in favour of publicly funding privately-owned stadiums? any historical analysis of the last hundred years shows conclusively that it's a terrible idea. john oliver made a video about an argument that was settled years ago.
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,raftman23,5,Wed Jul 15 01:26:35 2015 UTC,The Flames are also one of the most profitable franchises in the league.  Even with the dollar tanking they should still be comfortably in the black.  Best I'd give them is a somewhat favourable rate on the West Village or possibly give them the land and garnish earnings until they pay it back and then some.  No way should we be giving them it for free.
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,fknSamsquamptch,5,Wed Jul 15 01:37:42 2015 UTC,I forget where I saw it but there was an analysis of publicly funded stadiums dating back to the early 1900s. pretty much none of them ended up making the money back for the city. I have no interest in funding billionaire oil barons so they can make even more money.
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,raftman23,7,Wed Jul 15 01:47:55 2015 UTC,"Anyone that views it as a net financial gain is kidding themselves.  The only cogent argument is that it is a prestige investment that raises quality of life.  Pretty much only for people who go to sporting events or concerts, though."
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,fknSamsquamptch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"Because it keeps happening every time, and the only leverage the owners have against this is blackmail strategy - to move the team. I, for one, would back down if it meant moving the team, I have no spine. I'd like a great argument to include the positive side of public funding, so that I can feel better of myself. There has to be a good, solid one out there. And if not, I'm an NDP canditate for a seat in the next election. And oh man, you don't wan't this.   That's why."
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,raftman23,7,Wed Jul 15 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"lol you think they're actually going to give up on 30+ years of building their brand just for 200 million dollars? the flames reside in one of the most pleasant hockey markets possible. the ownership group has tons of roots here--the flames, stampeders, and hitmen (which will all benefit from a new sports complex). moving the team would require a major restructuring of the way the owners do business, not to mention all the difficulties that come with building a new brand. i'll play this game of chicken all day long."
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,tempz77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:47 2015 UTC,Only positive is shit would likely happen quicker. I think the city playing hardball has delayed things for sure. Just look at Edmonton and the progress they've made since the threat of a move was made. But fuck those threats that is all hot air. Bettman is there to make his owners money. No way profitable teams get relocated into untested markets.   We can wait it out.
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,radiomorning,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:14:35 2015 UTC,Yeah if they really think Vegas is their best bet for expansion then they are not going to vacate a market like Calgary anytime soon.
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jul 15 13:00:41 2015 UTC,"John Oliver's point is good -- cities shouldn't be signing contracts that end up bankrupting them just to keep a big entertainment business there, which is what's happening in Glendale and Cincinnati -- at the end of the day, hospitals and schools and emergency services are more important than a hockey team, so if you're finding yourself cutting funding to those things so that your arena can have a pool in the luxury suites, there's a problem.  However, there is a difference between funding a business with the expectation of getting a good return for your investment (in Calgary's case, I believe Ken King is offering to build some public city owned amenities, such as a track and field stadium, in exchange for public funding) and funding a business that won't provide a return on investment, just so they don't leave (what happened in Edmonton, cause Katz is a douche canoe).  John Oliver is complaining about the latter, not the former."
CalgaryFlames,3dbqz3,Masterdindin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"Well, these guys who are extremely rich can comfortably buy the arena and still make a profit. It's one thing to have public services, but these are private individuals who ask for no small amount of money for funding the stadium. Money doesn't grow on trees or come out of thin air.  Should the Flames have a new stadium? Yes. Should taxpayers have to bear the cost because some rich guy who earns thousands of times more than most people do their entire lives is being a cheapass? No. The Flames are great but it costs money for tickets/merchandise etc. and it's not like fans wouldn't pay for those things already. Tell me, what would taxpayers have to gain from this, does it contribute to the public good? No, as much as I love the Flames, it does not.   The only way it this will ever end up affecting most people is a pinch in their wallets. This is an avoidable expense and not a necessity. If people want to donate to a very rich person so they can build a stadium that they already can cover fairly easily, go ahead. But they government shouldn't be doing this."

CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,fknSamsquamptch,9,Wed Jul 15 01:42:39 2015 UTC,"Trade Jones since it's his last year and his value is high.   Trade Wideman and Raymond if they waive their NTCs. Wideman's value will never be higher, and we need his cap space to sign Gio/Monny/Gaudreau/Hudler. Raymond simply doesn't have a spot with us and we need his cap space.   Re-sign Schlemko. He was a solid bottom pairing possession guy for us, and if we are trading Wideman, we need someone to anchor the bottom pairing with whichever rookie makes the team or Engelland."

CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,businesstravis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"I think my first move is trading for a young RW to play on the top line. Mark Stone might be a solid target (depending on pot ratings), maybe Nyquist. Ideally shipping out a goalie, would part with Hudler (i know i know), Jones, Backlund to make that kind of deal.  Might need to pick up a new young goalie as well depending on how our prospects stack up in game."
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,businesstravis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:38:40 2015 UTC,"I picked up Nyquist and Turco at the start of NHL 15, teamed them up with Backs and they ripped up the second line for a season and a half."
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,Waldo76,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:50:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest EA undervalues the entire flames roster. I've never seen Monny get above 84 overall even after 9+ seasons of him playing on the first line, (if I recall Raymond was 83 overall early on for comparison). Maybe I'm spiteful, but I like to stick with the current flames roster and not make any moves and win as the underdog while giving the middle finger to EA."
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,Shodspartan100,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:19 2015 UTC,"That's why I dropped some of the flames players to the QMJHL and remade them myself with Johnny at a solid 85, Monny at an 89, and more. Also had to recreate kipper of course ;)"
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,businesstravis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:17:14 2015 UTC,I'm halfway through 16-17 on NHL 15 and Monny's an 89 and Johnny's an 86
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,Waldo76,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:09:50 2015 UTC,"Very strange. I've started over quite a few times but it doesnt seem to matter if I keep him on the first or second lines, or send him to the AHL.... he just doesnt get any better. Did you do anything in particular? Play all 82 games in the first year or something?"
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,businesstravis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've played every game, so that might help. I also tossed Johnny the puck before scoring an empty netter quite a few times to boost his stats.   In my season Monahan is looking scary. He's still on the upswing, is the best scorer on my team and is at 89 despite being 22 I think by this point? Could definitely see him getting to 93 or 94 by the time things even out. Though I'll probably be onto NHL 16 by then."
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,Blank747,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"Go get Zach Fucale, he is a goalie for the future and hiller/ramo can hold out until he is ready. Also Montreal has price so they are willing to shop him."
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,bluntoclock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:00:33 2015 UTC,Trade all my firsts from 2018-19 onwards for firsts in 2016-17.  Always fun to draft a bunch in your first year and have a stacked prospect cupboard.
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,WeightOfTheheNewYear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:58:21 2015 UTC,Yeah then it takes 5 years for the #3 overall pick to become a bottom 6 guy and then he regress to depth forward for three years despite playing on the third line and second PP unit and then you trade him because fuck it you have better prospects in the system and he miraculously becomes a 1st line winger once you trade him
CalgaryFlames,3dapgc,bluntoclock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"Haha all true.  But to be fair, I never said drafting in the first round was effective, just that it was fun."

CalgaryFlames,3d6mcl,threedeadypees,5,Tue Jul 14 00:08:01 2015 UTC,Monahan is a stud. His hockey sense is amazing and he can finish with the best of them.  I don't think 40 goals is out of the question for Monny in the near future.
CalgaryFlames,3d6mcl,Dont_Hurt_Tomatoes,4,Tue Jul 14 03:42:59 2015 UTC,Great video as always. Probably my favourite goal is the one against the Sharks around 13:44. He wins the faceoff against a top faceoff man. Goes to the net. Pushes off against the defenceman to get some space. Bangs in the rebound.
CalgaryFlames,3d6mcl,fknSamsquamptch,5,Tue Jul 14 00:29:47 2015 UTC,"I think my favourite was his vs Arizona at home. 3rd last game of the season and the Flames were tied in the third. The play he makes to chip it around the Coyote and Hudler (who did a great job of tying his man up) was beautiful alone, then he stops up and snipes it. Beauty!"
CalgaryFlames,3d6mcl,Newtothisredditbiz,4,Tue Jul 14 03:38:11 2015 UTC,Monahan is absurd at finishing.  After the first season I thought maybe his Sh% was flukey... sure don't anymore.  I can't remember the last Flame that was so damn clutch in scoring positions.
CalgaryFlames,3d6mcl,Mowglijoe12,5,Tue Jul 14 02:42:18 2015 UTC,"I thought he has always been so good at getting open and finding pucks from just outside the crease. I thought maybe in his second season teams would find ways to shut him down, but if anything, he's learned how to make space for himself better instead of just sneaking in unnoticed.  He is a great finisher, but he also puts himself in great position for so many tap-ins."

It's not the hardest in the league, but it's off his stick so quickly and with such little windup that it fools goalies a lot of the time. Makes me think his two seasons shooting above 15% aren't just good luck."
CalgaryFlames,3d6mcl,juridiculous,5,Tue Jul 14 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"Makes me think his two seasons shooting above 15% aren't just good luck.   For me, it's the fact I never see him shoot from beyond the face-off dots and that he finds ways to get shots from just outside the crease that makes me think that.  Monahan is exceptionally good at getting open right near the net and he's got the hands to finish. He's like the hockey version of a star NBA centre — soft hands from in close."
CalgaryFlames,3d6mcl,Mowglijoe12,5,Tue Jul 14 07:02:53 2015 UTC,"I never see him shoot from beyond the face-off dots   I also never see him take slap-shots, but this explains why."

CalgaryFlames,3d5ido,KingMalric,6,Mon Jul 13 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"Is there any precedent for the city getting some revenue back? If so, I think it would be a wise investment. Plus, I have to think Calgary is the exception to the rule with having an arena in close proximity affect local businesses. I'm pretty sure Melrose stated they closed their doors because the Flames were doing poorly and no one was hitting up the Red Mile anymore.  Nenshi's done a good job in my opinion making smart decisions for the city, so I'm certain he won't just bend over backwards for Ken King. Likewise, Ken King seems invested enough into the city that he wouldn't try to use relocating as leverage. I'm confident they could get a deal done."
CalgaryFlames,3d5ido,bumbuff,10,Mon Jul 13 18:18:08 2015 UTC,Melrose owners had a poor business plan.  Bars should never expect to survive off of spikes caused by events.    I own a bar.  Regulars get me through low times. Treat them well.

Nenshi has no more power than the 14 councillors who are on council with him. He could be dead set against any funding for the new arena, but if 8 councillors vote in favour it would go through anyway."

Certainly practically he couldn't prevent anything from happening, but I imagine if he made a strong case for why using public funds would be bad for Calgary and the other councillors decided to push it through anyways, they would likely receive some blowback from voters.  Or not, I don't know. He didn't really turn the tide on the 'developer-slate' in the last election like I was expecting him to, so maybe he's not as influential as I figured."

It's to the point now where the the league probably makes more money using a vacant L.A. market as a threat than it would if they put a team there.  The NHL is in a different position. The NFL's L.A. threat would be like the NHL having no team in Montreal. But for most NHL teams apart from the Sun Belt clubs, there isn't anywhere they can move where they can make more money."

Both of those cities are already making moves to new arenas and when they do get them Calgary will have the oldest arena in the league by a decade.   After Edmonton's ownership tried to pull the threatening to relocate bullshit a few years ago and everyone laughed at them for it it seems like most NHL owners have realized that threatening to leave doesn't really work."

CalgaryFlames,3d5ido,PMHerper,3,Tue Jul 14 13:20:07 2015 UTC,"Oliver has a good point here, which is that taxpayers shouldn't be paying the majority of money for arenas that aren't providing a public service other than having a sports team (i.e. a business) in the city -- cities don't pay the majority share of cinemas or bars to be built, though they might provide tax credits. Sports teams need to be worth the money put into them -- there's no way that teams should be prioritized over the services that governments and only governments provide: hospital, school, or library funding are good examples.  Katz's shit with Edmonton is a perfect example of the kind of bartering that should never be happening -- as mentioned by Oliver, movement threats are petty and only punish the fans -- there's no evidence a sports team assists other businesses longer term.  Ken King, IIRC, has been negotiating about building a new sports (track/field) facility for the city (like the Foothills facility) in addition to the arena that the Flames will build -- this type of value-adding proposition seems like the correct way to negotiate if you actually want city funding and truly want to be community focused."
CalgaryFlames,3d5ido,RDC123,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:38:07 2015 UTC,"Very eye opening from John Oliver, as usual. I've been vocal about supporting public funding for arenas; maybe out of ignorance, maybe out of misinformation. Honestly, the only way public funding should be used is by purchasing a portion of ownership over the building. That way the city can recoup its cost from revenues over time and earn a profit down the road. If the city is paying for it, the city should own it."

CalgaryFlames,3d6a78,RDC123,2,Tue Jul 14 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"It isn't particularly common, either, particularly where the tort system in Canada doesn't make a separate proceeding as economically viable as it is elsewhere. As a practical matter, the timeline I've usually seen is for someone to file civilly, wait to see the result of the criminal proceeding and if the criminal system will do their work for them, then either proceed or drop depending on the outcome and extent of damages (i.e. if it's a big brain damage case or whatever you likely keep going regardless.)

From wikipedia: >The facility was designed by Graham McCourt Architects. While they set out to design a unique building, the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team.[17] The roof of the building was designed to be a reverse hyperbolic paraboloid, allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one-third when compared to traditional arenas,[18] resulting in reduced heating, lighting and maintenance costs, plus the floating roof can flex to compensate for the city's frequent temperature fluctuations.[17] When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped."

CalgaryFlames,3cxga7,laureth-23,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:03:27 2015 UTC,"But going from 16 to 211? There's got to something more than size at play here, no?"
CalgaryFlames,3cxga7,HarfNarfArf,3,Sun Jul 12 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"Oilers fan here. I grew up with Tyson, and his brother and that group of friends. He was always a great hockey player, especially when his size was less of an issue. That said, he is pretty solid for his height. The real knock I have heard on him, from his time in junior and from his own mouth, is his skating. It's something he has needed to develop a lot more.   That said, very happy and hope he can stick with a team and get signed, even if it is with Calgary (boo). Hope he has a great camp for you lot!"
CalgaryFlames,3cxga7,enag7,2,Sun Jul 12 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"I was totally stunned to see him not drafted last year, and then let go from the sharks as well. I wouldn't be surprised to see become a Tyler Johnson type player in a few years."
CalgaryFlames,3cxga7,Polymarchos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:05:47 2015 UTC,Why exactly did he drop so far so fast?

CalgaryFlames,3cuhk7,newfie_hiscock,10,Fri Jul 10 21:54:28 2015 UTC,It's a quality hat
CalgaryFlames,3cuhk7,locoenchilada,11,Fri Jul 10 21:58:25 2015 UTC,Kind of looks like Deryk Engelland too.
CalgaryFlames,3cuhk7,magic-moose,9,Fri Jul 10 22:20:39 2015 UTC,The resemblance is uncanny

CalgaryFlames,3cty41,jigglefest2,5,Fri Jul 10 19:51:48 2015 UTC,Not a problem. It's a lot of fun to cover and talk to the players and watch some hockey after a few months off.   I will also be doing some prospect profile articles starting tomorrow which will break down my opinions on what types of skills they have etc.   Here's an example from last year's dev camp.   http://www.firesidechat.ca/prospects/sam-bennett  So there will be in the neighbourhood of 25 of those give or take a few that are just my snapshots of what I think their current skill sets are.
CalgaryFlames,3cty41,MattFiresideChat,3,Fri Jul 10 19:58:33 2015 UTC,God. Damn. :D I'm working shift work right now and it's awesome having this available to read at work. Thanks again man!

CalgaryFlames,3cty41,MattFiresideChat,3,Fri Jul 10 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"Good to see Bennett back out there. I was a little disappointed that he didn't dress for the scrimmage yesterday, but he was probably doing some strength training or something."
CalgaryFlames,3cty41,notlogan,5,Fri Jul 10 21:32:18 2015 UTC,Also Baillie will go to the Penticton tournament in Sept.
CalgaryFlames,3cty41,Newtothisredditbiz,4,Fri Jul 10 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"Also the other standout walk on, Brandon Hawkins, is not eligible to play in the Pentiction tournament because he is committed to an NCAA team.   Same as Jankowski, Gilmour, and Hickey."
CalgaryFlames,3cty41,marbsarebad,5,Fri Jul 10 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"Hickey will be playing for Team Canada U20 in August:   From Aug. 1-6, 40 players – three goaltenders, 13 defencemen and 24 forwards – will participate in practices on Aug. 1-2 before playing two games each against the Czech Republic (Aug. 4 and Aug. 6) and Russia (Aug. 3 and Aug. 5) at the Markin MacPhail Centre.   It'll be interesting to see him among top juniors.  McDonald will be there too."

Now for 22 year old Mikesulls to go and see some prospects play and hopefully see Monahan and 18+1 year old Sam Bennett. And also try to get pictures with various players while not having any of your friends there to help you out or hold the camera. Yayyy, today shouldn't be awkward in the slightest."
CalgaryFlames,3csatv,mikesulls,3,Fri Jul 10 12:00:34 2015 UTC,HEY 18 YEAR OLD SAM BENNET WANNA TAKE A SELFIE
CalgaryFlames,3csatv,larsy87,4,Fri Jul 10 15:45:51 2015 UTC,thanks again for attending these development days and relaying the information.  Is this/the fireside chat podcast your main gig or are you taking time off of work to go?
CalgaryFlames,3csatv,donksdonksdonks,8,Fri Jul 10 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"I work by myself as an interior designer, and one of the perks is that I can take a week off to cover things like the development camp. My co-host is a professor at sait."

He might not be a truly great hockey player, but he's a truly great person and it was a pleasure to watch him in Calgary.  Big Ern is a guy I'd like to see return to the Flames org someday in a non-playing role."
CalgaryFlames,3cr3ev,magic-moose,5,Fri Jul 10 03:00:09 2015 UTC,Has he said anywhere that he's playing? So far it's just joining the organization...
CalgaryFlames,3cr3ev,larsy87,2,Fri Jul 10 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"Still unsure in what capacity, but I'm assuming an AHL deal."
CalgaryFlames,3cr3ev,Fishsauce_Mcgee,5,Fri Jul 10 04:12:06 2015 UTC,"One of the best experiences I've ever had was getting to play paintball with/against the entire Calgary Flames pre-season camp. Most guys showed up in outdoorsy clothes and took the rental gear. A few guys brought ghillie suits and their own paintball guns they had just bought for the event. Big-ern showed up in full tactical swat team dress, with a crazy paintball gun, paintball grenades, smoke grenades, and some firecrackers for good measure. He was a beast on the field and gave no quarter. Awesome dude!  For those wondering, this was part of a team-building event that they did with the military in Calgary during the 2013 pre-season.

CalgaryFlames,3crbc9,patrickthebeerguy,5,Fri Jul 10 03:38:57 2015 UTC,I will always remember him for getting the game winner in Kipper's last home game. Such a great goal in a great game.

CalgaryFlames,3crbc9,ChellMiller,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:50:11 2015 UTC,This was another one of my favourite gestures to the crowd
CalgaryFlames,3crbc9,BoHoKnows,-15,Mon Jul 13 03:40:08 2015 UTC,You call someone who ends another players career with a dirty hit a true champion? The man didn't even reach out to Andrew Alberts to apologize.
CalgaryFlames,3crbc9,EatMopWho,6,Fri Jul 10 09:07:28 2015 UTC,Was it really that dirty of a hit? I mean yeah for sure it's unfortunate what happened to Alberts but I don't think the hit itself was any worse than say Hamhuis' on Bennett in the playoffs. McGrattan was tough as nails but never a dirty or malicious player and I don't think hurting Alberts like that was in any way intentional. In my opinion it was simply an unlucky situation where his arms came up and happened to catch him in the head which sadly resulted in a concussion. You can't seriously discredit his career or dispute a fan's regard for a player based on one mishap though.
CalgaryFlames,3crbc9,Wolff_Fucker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:24:56 2015 UTC,"No kidding, it was right at the beginning of the game too. Full of energy and went in for a hit. There's really no good view of it, hard to say whether it was dirty or not."
CalgaryFlames,3crbc9,HgFrLr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:12:12 2015 UTC,I agree with saying McGratten isn't a dirty player- however accidents happen and I do believe he should have formally apologized to this poor guy as it was kind of a dirty hit with his hands too high. (Did he apologize though? Idk)
CalgaryFlames,3cr31o,FalsePerm,6,Fri Jul 10 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"Gilles didn't even bite on that fake, great focus"

CalgaryFlames,3cr31o,jamesbn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard of him either before today. As it turns out there are two players named Brandon Hawkins both American and born in 1994.  I'm pretty sure this player is this guy, he is a 21 year old RW, shoots right, 5'11'', 201 pounds. He went fourth overall in the 2013 USHL draft. Played one season there for Sioux City scoring 48 points in 54 games.  After that he left the USHL for the NCAA and played for Bowling Green State University where he scored 30 points in 39 games and was named the best rookie RW in the NCAA.  On top of this shootout goal he also scored in the scrimmage. Seems like a pretty good player, will be interesting to see if the Flames end up offering him a contract in the future."
CalgaryFlames,3cr31o,notlogan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:28:02 2015 UTC,"Filthy goal, how has he been otherwise?"

Had a great year last season, lead the team in scoring as a freshman, played a decent two way game (which was a concern coming from juniors, sorta had a Phil kessel-esque reputation coming here to BG, proved a lot of doubters wrong this year). Looking to continue his scoring contribution and improve in the defensive zone this year."

CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,BoHoKnows,3,Fri Jul 10 04:36:52 2015 UTC,he was more of a guy that dealt with drafting I think
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,Galaxy91122,2,Fri Jul 10 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"He was very good at the draft, and that's about it."
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,marbsarebad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:44:30 2015 UTC,He was good because he listened to Todd Button. That's why our 2010 and 2011 drafts went so well even though Weisbrod wasn't there for 2010 and was very new for 2011. It's also why we continued to draft well over the past 2 years.
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,alivirji,2,Fri Jul 10 07:43:07 2015 UTC,He wasn't around yet for the 2011 draft. He was still at the Boston draft table and later said how the Flames picking Gaudreau made everyone there furious.
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,CuggyofHouseAbby,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:04:46 2015 UTC,"Lol if it made them furious, they should have picked him in the first 3 friggin rounds lol."
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,alivirji,6,Fri Jul 10 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The way the Flames/Todd Button snuck in the Gaudreau pick was a brilliant move, They hid all their viewings of his games so no one would know they were scouting him. They deliberately did not talk to him or his advisor. The Bruins though they would have him with a 5th rounder. I'll see if I can find the article. It really shows how much work and effort goes into every draft pick, even the late rounders.   Edit: found http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Scouts+subterfuge+played+role+Flames+snaring+Johnny+Gaudreau+2011+draft/10203624/story.html"
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,CuggyofHouseAbby,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"How he ended up going that late with those stats (even with his size), I'll never understand."
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,Polymarchos,2,Sat Jul 11 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"All I know is that he was the guy entailed to drive to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere to watch future #1 Centerman Mark Jankowski play for a small, Canadian high school."
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,sdenoon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:28:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone outside of the Flames management group knows exactly what Weisbrod's role entailed. Unless you can find some summary from the Flames site from when Weisbrod was here, you'd have to ask him or Jay Feaster."
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,rpawson5771,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:50 2015 UTC,"He was actually awful and a big reason why Feaster was fired, he hitched his wagon to Weisbrod's hockey decisions. Weisbrod didn't defer to Todd Button, Todd Button reported to him. He was primarily responsible for the ""hockey"" stuff, player personnel choices, the guys they zeroed in on in trades, drafting, etc. Jay Feaster handled contracts.   Weisbrod chases after players he likes with a one-track mind, often to the team's detriment. We were constantly connected in trade rumors to a small group of players. For example Matt Read from Philly for whatever reason. He convinced Feaster and the Flames Cervenka was a centre, we signed the guy out of Europe and he shows up to camp and tells the coach he doesn't like centre and prefers wing.   Notice now in Vancouver several years after the faux Boston Iginla trade, you guys signed Bartkowski which made me chuckle.   He had ""smarter than everyone else in the room"" syndrome. The 2012 draft, (Jankowski) was entirely his doing and the rumors were that he was held back during the 2013 draft. He was the guy feeding Feaster the ""Jankowski will be the best player from this draft 10 years from now"" lines, and all the silly stuff about Berra, Ramo and Cervenka being the ""Best players not in the NHL"""
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,CuggyofHouseAbby,2,Fri Jul 10 13:57:48 2015 UTC,I think its fair to say that Jankowski is looking like a 1st round pick as of this year. We may have gone off the board in 2012 but Jankowski has so much skill abd potential that I see him making the Flames in the near future. Thats just my opinion though.
CalgaryFlames,3crhbw,TheHelicoblair,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:51:51 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for any of this information?

Trade rumors about being linked to guys like Matt Read, from numerous rumors back from 2012-2013 and was regularly reported from media sources on twitter.

I'm also a Kings fan/ Flames fan living in Calgary, and I found out the Kings will give you pretty killer prize if you send them pictures in Kings gear in Alberta. On their site its in the social tab under 'Vacation like a King'"
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,Plant_pot,4,Thu Jul 9 20:35:08 2015 UTC,There's also http://www.myebus.ca/ which is cheaper in my experience. They're both pretty comparable otherwise. I think they even pick you up at the same place downtown.  I'd check both for the day and see which is the better deal.
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,hideyoshisdf,3,Thu Jul 9 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they're the same company, websites are identical and they pick up and drop off from the exact same places. Ebus is half the price ($35 vs $70), but the seats are smaller (4 per row instead of 3) and you don't get the complimentary snacks and drinks. Plus iirc red arrow shows a movie"
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,Kovaz,3,Fri Jul 10 21:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll be coming from LA.  I'll have to remember this when I go up to Calgary.  Thanks.  EDIT: be"
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,hurricanebarker,3,Thu Jul 9 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"Upvoted for Red Arrow, they are the bomb and only stop in Red Deer and have movies and snacks and it's cheap!"
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,Polymarchos,4,Thu Jul 9 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say Red Arrow as well. I used to live up in Edmonton with family down in Calgary, while I usually needed my car when I came back down to Calgary the few times I didn't Red Arrow was a godsend. Not bad price wise (although I have no idea how it compares to LA bus prices), and it goes direct.  The other two options would be Grey Hound, which I believe costs more, isn't direct, and doesn't have Wifi, and flying, which will probably cost pretty close to what it cost you to fly from LA to Calgary in the first place and still leave you a few miles short of Edmonton."
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,MarcusBrody96,3,Thu Jul 9 22:31:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, Greyhound looks like it's an option since it's only $50 CAD round trip.  A similar trip in the States would be twice that.  Plus, it looks like there's a trip at midnight, which will let head back to Calgary without having to stay in Edmonton for the night."
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,alivirji,3,Thu Jul 9 22:41:10 2015 UTC,I was planning on driving up there for the Dec 29th game but I'll be spending the night because I plan to drink heavily.
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,blink0r,2,Fri Jul 10 06:45:51 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to drive yourself, take a greyhound bus. It's pretty cheap and quite simple.   Otherwise a flight is your best option. I suggest using google flights, as it always seems to have the best deals."
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,g_gundy,3,Thu Jul 9 20:10:42 2015 UTC,I just booked a return flight from Regina to California during the first week of September for $349 canadian after taxes and fees.  If you get lucky you can find a KILLER deal.
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,alivirji,2,Thu Jul 9 23:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'll be flying from LAX to YYC, but the bus is more for that one day I'll be spending in Edmonton in the middle of the week or so I'll be spending in Calgary, and right now the bus from Calgary to Edmonton for that one day trip is winning like it's Charlie Sheen."
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,jonos360,2,Fri Jul 10 04:42:35 2015 UTC,"What's the travel time on Greyhound from Calgary to Edmonton?  This might be doable, esp. if I don't need to get a hotel in Edmonton."
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,captain_housecoat,3,Thu Jul 9 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's probably just as fast on the Greyhound as going via plane. Edmonton's airport is stupid far from the actual city and with waiting before/after flight and cab rides you're talking the same amount of time for like triple or higher the money."
CalgaryFlames,3cprfg,captain_housecoat,2,Thu Jul 9 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  I'll probably take Greyhound regardless since it's only $50 CAD and I can catch it right after the game.  Granted, I'd still get back to Calgary around 5:30-6AM, but I'll at least be able to get some sleep on the way back."

CalgaryFlames,3coji3,MasteroftheHallows,3,Thu Jul 9 17:54:14 2015 UTC,Janko looks like he's going to be good. Thanks Feaster! (Or who ever was in charge of drafting him)
CalgaryFlames,3coji3,Pretty_Fly_For_A_,5,Fri Jul 10 05:05:41 2015 UTC,"Here's my thoughts from today  Forwards  -I thought Smith & Karnaukhov were alright. Need alot of seasoning, a year in the minors should fix that  -Very impressed with Magipane & Baille. Great skill & speed but need to improve on strength & overall game for sure  -Klimchuk looked solid out there, really versatile. Great stick and great hockey smarts. Good speed & strength too  -Janko & Porier were the best of the group as expected. Janko controlled the pace whenever he had the puck and was good on defense as well, even on the boards. His size probably helped with that  -Porier was speedy as always but I think he improved on his offense alot. He made alot of great plays instead of just rushing or trying to get a quick shot off. I thought his game away from the puck was also good.  Defense  -I thought Anderson & Seiloff were alright. You could definitely see Anderson's potential but he needs to sharpen his game, probably needs to work out more and because it's also July. Seiloff wasn't good or bad but I think he's still a couple or years off if he'll ever make it  -Impressed with Kulak, good on the offense walking the line & even jumping up a little and decent on defense  -Kanzig was pretty good too. Solid on all parts but I think he still needs a year to harness his size. He improved alot though, might see him next year  -Also liked Kylington, lots of raw potential but I think like Anderson he needs to sharpen his game too. If he has a good year next season & straightens things out I think he could be a dark horse  -Morrisson looks close to NHL ready. All around solid, even game especially on defense. Decent when on the offensive blue line, but with his shot he doesn't really need alot of creativity. Best defenseman at camp and I think he and Nakladal will be great extras when they get their chances this year  Goalies  -As expected, Gillis was the best. He had a few highlight saves. His angles and reflexes were great, but breakaways were a different story. Probably didn't play the puck alot cause it wasn't 5 on 5 but he could improve on that  -Somewhat dissapointed with MacDonald, gave up a few softies and his reflexes & movement wasn't too sharp. But he's a project so we can be patient with him, besides he played pretty good in Junior  -The other two were okay, saw some potential  Coaches  -Conroy has got a great dad bod going on. He's still got that million dollar smile. Could probably tighten up on the wrinkles, though. You're not that old, Craig  -Gelinas is a total stud, looks as if he never stopped playing. He's got a good Beckham thing going on with his hair too. 10/10, it was in"
CalgaryFlames,3coji3,the_troy,3,Thu Jul 9 19:13:27 2015 UTC,Any more details on Poirier?
CalgaryFlames,3coji3,MasteroftheHallows,3,Thu Jul 9 19:46:31 2015 UTC,"Like I said his creativity/awareness improved but I think his hands did too. Lots of nifty little plays. Also great at carrying the puck & passing. I think he had 2 dazzling goals, one in the game and 1 in the shootout and I think he scored another but it wasn't as flashy. Still needs to round out positioning & board plays, just needs more experience and strength. He'll be in the NHL for sure one day, might make the team this season even"

He was an anchor to our 2nd line and I'd be happy to have him signed and in Calgarys system
CalgaryFlames,3coji3,MasteroftheHallows,2,Fri Jul 10 02:47:53 2015 UTC,"I thought he was great. Kind of like an older, right handed Magipane. Needs more seasoning, though, but I think and hope we'll sign him"
CalgaryFlames,3coji3,MasteroftheHallows,2,Fri Jul 10 04:04:46 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear it. Fingers crossed. What is he playing? He spent most of this season playing on the RW  With Huska in Addy/Stockton, and Lambert going to Buffalo, and half of our players over-age/ready to move on(Morrisey, Bowey, Merkley???, Draisatl, Chartier) it's looking to be a rough season in Kelowna. :("
CalgaryFlames,3coji3,alivirji,2,Fri Jul 10 04:38:17 2015 UTC,"There wasn't really alot of positional play since it wasn't 5 on 5 but I hope he spends the next season in the minors.

I can't remember who said it, maybe Feaster, but it was something like, ""Ten years from now, we will look back on this draft and Jankowski will have been the best pick.""  I'm not saying I agree with any of it, because I am still here waiting to see him in the NHL.  Just hope he can keep up with his development and really make an impact in the future.  Either way, I am excited with the Flames progression and growth over the last couple years."
CalgaryFlames,3cpdyd,Druxo,3,Thu Jul 9 21:25:00 2015 UTC,My excitement for him has really skyrocketed since the start of the Frozen Four a couple months ago. He's really elevated his game and I really hope that face-off percentage can carry over to the pro level.

CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,kapxis,8,Wed Jul 8 17:37:44 2015 UTC,Janko played about as well as he did yesterday. Rang quite a few off the crossbar. Mangiapane was better today. Not as easily knocked off the puck. A lot of compete in his game. Still needs to get stronger.
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,marbsarebad,9,Wed Jul 8 21:52:06 2015 UTC,started off with some passing and stickhandling drills

CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,RocksteadyNBeebop,9,Wed Jul 8 21:53:22 2015 UTC,Like to hear more about Kylington if possible today.
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,fknSamsquamptch,5,Wed Jul 8 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"His skating was a lot more fluid today. Having an easier time crossing over and skating backwards. He's very good offensively, just very raw on the defensive side."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,RocksteadyNBeebop,8,Wed Jul 8 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"From what I've been hearing on other boards Kanzig was one of the most improved skaters out there, one guy saying he was one of top 3 best skating defencemen.    A 6'8"", 250 lb, smooth-skating, gritty, defensive defenceman is the stuff of dreams."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,Kellervo,6,Wed Jul 8 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"If you didn't look at the # or the fact he's a giant, you would not be able to discern him from guys like Culkin or pretty much any of the other guys. He has done a lot to improve his foot speed, although he could always get better. I interviewed him today, and he even said that he is going to be focusing more on his skating as well as his passing ability. He seemed to be a little more relaxed this go around and comfortable talking.  If he gets a little faster he should be a decent 3rd pairing option down the road."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,gaganminhas,2,Wed Jul 8 22:00:34 2015 UTC,"That is really good to hear. After watching him a couple times with the Hitmen, his passing stood out to me as something that could use more work."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,locoenchilada,3,Wed Jul 8 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"It was me who was raving about his skating improvement on HF, he had imho the third best footwork and skating out of the early group (behind Hickey and Nakladal) unfortunately I had things to do this afternoon so i missed the late group.  Now I don't think he is ever going to be Elvis Stojko (sp?) out there but he was definitely superior to the walk ons, Bruce (No surprise there) and Seiloff.  I was living in Puerto Rico the last year so I really haven't seen Kanzig since I took in a split squad pre-season game in Edmonton right after he was drafted and the progression is phenomenal.  He was tripping over himself every shift in that game and I honestly had no hope that he could turn out.    To re-hash for the others I overheard Conroy talking about Kanzig and what a physical freak he is and that he is the hardest working player he has ever seen.    I am excited about our future because for the first time ever the scouting and drafting is finding players like this, that will defy the odds and overcome exceptional hurdles because of character and hard work.  Imagine if Kylington can improve his defensive game like Kanzig has his skating?  Step aside Karlsson."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,superdude99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:29:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, definitely much appreciated.  Do you think Kanzig's improvement has almost rendered Seiloff obsolete?  Seiloff was projected to be a pure shut-down D, if Kanzig doesn't suck dick at skating won't he immediately surpass Seiloff on the depth chart?"
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,Dramon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"I don't want to jump to conclusions based off of a few drills, Kanzig just really impressed me with how much he had improved in the skating dept. and Conroy was saying the same thing.  As far as I know Kanzig still has work to do on his skating and his puck moving and offensive game still need work (look at his jr. stats, not exactly Bobby Orr stats).  However, with his improvement on skates I wouldn't be surprised if he was cracking the AHL and taking some minutes from more established guys (Seiloff)."

He was tripping over himself every shift in that game and I honestly had no hope that he could turn out.   To be fair I thought Kanzig was toast after last season's camps. His skating was somehow even worse than it was in his first camp, so the fact he's come so far in such a short time is excellent. He really is working on his skating."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,newfie_hiscock,8,Thu Jul 9 14:40:23 2015 UTC,Is janko still playing strong ?
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,95accord,6,Wed Jul 8 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, pretty much the same as yesterday although he rang more off the posts/crossbar instead of having them go in."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,donksdonksdonks,7,Wed Jul 8 21:55:33 2015 UTC,I'll sticky this -- it's getting me pumped hearing about our guys.
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,Cowtownboy,6,Wed Jul 8 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"Wonder how Morrison, Andersson, and Kylington are doing?"
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,locoenchilada,9,Wed Jul 8 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"Andersson looked a bit better today, not quite as raw as he did yesterday. He needs to get in better shape, but he seems really interested in doing so, he just is at the start of the journey. Anyone who has started getting in shape understands that feeling.   If the Flames didn't have 7 D-men already, I would have expected Morrison to have a spot in the starting line up. He is the most polished of any of the defenders there. I wouldn't be shocked entirely if he stole a spot.  Kylington is dynamite with passing, shooting and skating forward. He is somewhat weak defensively and skating both from side to side and backwards, although that's not a big deal to fix that. Excellent player, and if he only becomes average defensively he will be a force. He is also really skinny, like Gaudreau skinny. Needs to put on a little weight."
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,locoenchilada,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"Hearing that about Kylington makes me happy. A good, solid pass is one of the best feelings ever, and can make a difference VERY quickly."

CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,MasteroftheHallows,4,Thu Jul 9 02:07:03 2015 UTC,Wondering on some more insight to Porier and Smith if you could. Thanks for these write ups.
CalgaryFlames,3cknkd,Ihran,9,Wed Jul 8 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"Poirier was a lot more energetic today. More focused on getting pucks on net. His speed is always there, but his shooting wasn't quite as good yesterday. He flashed some good hand eye coordination on the ""tipping the point shot"" drill.   Smith is a lot faster than this time last year. His skating is average/above average now, where it was a slight problem last year. His stickhandling and passing are also improved. Still a work in progress, but he is right on track to become an NHL player like a Brian Boyle type guy."
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,Circlesmirk,9,Wed Jul 8 17:20:16 2015 UTC,And you all laughed at me when I told you Agostino could turn into something. Reminds me a lot of a bigger Ryan Callahan.
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,rorydaniel,4,Wed Jul 8 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see it happen, but I'm reserving judgement until he's able to show something at the NHL level."
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,canadam,2,Wed Jul 8 17:51:26 2015 UTC,"The thing I like most about Agostino is that his level of focus is unbreakable, which will be an amazing trait to have during playoffs (and the season of course) when other teams players are chirping at him trying to knock him off his game."
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,Dramon,4,Wed Jul 8 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"Out of all those guys Poirier has the best chance to make the roster right out of the gate, and is the guy who I'm most confident about."
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,DaCodster,3,Wed Jul 8 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"Especially since LW looks a bit ""chumpy"" past Johnny and Ferland. Poirer could quickly outpace Bolig or MayRay."
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,jonos360,5,Wed Jul 8 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"Well, Poirier is technically a left-handed RW.  He's always played RW."
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,marbsarebad,2,Wed Jul 8 21:06:30 2015 UTC,Ah I misread his position! Thanks for politely correcting me :)  Still... probably some room on RW. Maybe he takes Jones spot? Or since Raymond was playing RW sometimes maybe that one?
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,jonos360,2,Wed Jul 8 21:15:59 2015 UTC,He's killing it in the ahl - he needs the challenge of the big league.
CalgaryFlames,3cklx8,95accord,0,Fri Jul 10 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"Poirier has the highest ceiling and raw skill, but he isn't NHL ready. He has to refine his defensive game some more before he can be effective in the NHL.  And that's completely fine, since not everyone is Sam Bennett or Sean Monahan who were NHL ready before they were 20. Even Gaudreau played 3 years after his draft before entering the league!  In terms of NHL readiness, I'd say Wotherspoon, Agostino and Granlund are the closest, followed by Arnold and then Poirier."

(Actually got kicked out that time, but the Flames were getting pumped by the Yotes so it wasn't that bad. One of my 18 year old friends was buying beers for my friend that was not quite 18. Security put a stop to that, and at some point I held my 17 year old friend's beer so they gave me the boot. I still recall him looking at my ID saying ""you're barely 18...anyway, you held your friends beer so gtfo. Then he gave the option of tossing my full beer or drinking it. I chugged it and got a nice little cheer from some people witnessing the great moment.

CalgaryFlames,3ckgl8,DestroDertell,2,Wed Jul 8 17:53:54 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it's an incredibly easy way to get content created for sports journalists. Who needs to exert the effort to write compelling articles when we can get clicks by putting numbers next to team names every damn week?
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,kappyknows,19,Tue Jul 7 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"Bouma is a very interesting player. Despite his horrid possession stats, I still think he's a very valuable player for a winning team to have. Having a player who plays with all his heart, fearlessly blocks shots, goes into the dirty areas, sticks up for his team mates and hits really, really hard is pretty great to have, especially if they can chip in 20-30 points of offense consistently. Bouma provides all that, and, on multiple occasions, we've seen his play pump up the team tremendously.   HOWEVER, his role on the team should never exceed a bottom 6 winger, and preferably a 4th liner. You can only ignore stats so much for intangibles, and Bouma is statistically not good, as evidenced by the article. His surprise and frankly unsustainable career year should not be used to justify him being used as a top 6 winger at all, and he shouldn't be paid more than 2 million imo. I'd be surprised if he ever beat this season's point totals. He will probably a 15-25 point 4th liner at best, which is great to have, but not worth more than 2 million (and even that is a bit much). He's basically a modern enforcer.  I also find it ridiculous that people are calling to keep Bouma and let go of Byron. Byron is much better than Bouma. He's small, but he plays big (he has a ton of hits, and even pissed off Doughty through out the past 2 seasons with his play), and, as shown in the article, he's one of the best players on our team at suppressing shot attempts. He also helps his teammates' possession a ton when he's on the ice (he's basically one of our best possession forwards). People always point to his failed breakaways as a reason to hate on him, but the fact that he gets those breaks is great. The finish will come with time and practice (and luck), but even if it doesn't, he is still a very versatile player. He plays any forward position, in any situation, is one of the best PKers we have, and he scored at 0.45 PPG last season (2nd line worthy) and 0.33 PPG during this down season (9.7% shooting percentage this year vs career average of 13.4%). For reference, Bouma scored 0.44 PPG this season with a much luckier shot percentage. Byron can play anywhere in the bottom 9 and succeed. He has both offensive and defensive prowess, and he fills our biggest area of need - possession wingers. He definitely deserves a spot on the team over Bouma if we are forced to choose between the two, especially since Byron is gonna be much cheaper."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,alivirji,8,Tue Jul 7 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"I think Bouma's role on our team moving forward is similar to, say, the one Prust had in Montreal - grit, an element of agitation, while not being completely outclassed at the actual game like so many enforcers of yore. His role as a PKer is likely going to diminish in the next couple of seasons with Backlund and Monahan hopefully both fully healthy.  However, we also have Ferland, who is younger, will be cheaper (for at least a couple years) and has more upside. We also have Byron who's significantly better at possession.  In short? Bouma's nice, a good character player, plays his heart out - but he's not the only one who does it, and we have a younger player that could likely fill his role in a season or two."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,Kellervo,4,Tue Jul 7 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"The way you say it, it almost, almost makes sense to trade him right now, while his value is very high.   Almost"
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,alivirji,4,Tue Jul 7 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better myself. I love Bouma but like you said he is a modern enforcer, consistent points but poor possession. Personally, I have been a huge Byron supporter. I think we have to lock him down, he was injured for much of the latter half of the season but his play is amazing. I still think his 2 minute man handling of Marleau and Thorton in their own zone which lead to Hudler goal is one of my favorite moments of last season."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,NewmanTheScofflaw,3,Tue Jul 7 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"Byron is an unreal fourth liner and PK guy.  He doesn't rack up the points, but he gets the puck moving in the right direction consistently (and maybe he'll finally learn a breakaway move hahaah)."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,fknSamsquamptch,4,Wed Jul 8 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"God I hope Bouma scores 25 goals at a 25% sh percentage so you guys can all pull your hair out and keep screaming ""unsustainable"""
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,chodes_r_us,4,Tue Jul 7 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Man, I hope so too, I love Boomer. That'd be fucking awesome."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,alivirji,2,Tue Jul 7 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"Well, its basically the concept of regression to the mean. People do worse and better than their average but should be judged in the long term to repeat that. Falling for what is currently seen and observed is what leads to terrible contracts. I would have said the flames would have just a hard time making the playoffs next season if not miss completely but roster additions have moved us up one level in general performance. But on an individual level Bouma's performance last season is uncharacteristic. He could get great stats again but the chances are statistically small, therefore unlikely."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,NewmanTheScofflaw,2,Tue Jul 7 20:25:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I know what regression to the mean is and how he has a historically low shooting percentage. I'm willing to bet Boumas never had the chance to play top six offensive minutes even in junior. He was drafted for his physical presence and defensive play. He reportedly worked on his shot all off season so I know everyone's saying he's gonna regress etc etc but I'm optimistic he's gonna beat 15 goals again this year. 15% shooting percentage isn't unheard of. I'm not willing to discount the fact that he may be a late bloomer (offensively) so I may be the minority but I really hope we sign Bouma to a four or five year deal even up to 2.5 mil AAV if thats what it takes to get it done
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,chodes_r_us,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:55:57 2015 UTC,"unsustainable    No kidding. These fancy stat proponents really get on my nerve. When one of them publishes predictions before each game and beats the bookies for a season, I'll listen.  But for now, it's like they'll find or make up a new stat to support or dis whatever player they are talking about.  Goals/assists/wins. The rest is noise for the sake of noise."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,Aplicado,5,Tue Jul 7 19:42:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, while it is really important not to cherry pick stats, especially with fancy stats, possession metrics have shown a strong correlation with team success since they've been recorded, so they do have merit. They just aren't an end all evaluative tool."
CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,alivirji,2,Tue Jul 7 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"Unsustainable is the layman's saying for regression to the mean. Which in Bouma's case, minus off season improvements, is true. It is true for any player who exceeds their long term averages dramatically. There is a chance, extremely small probability, that he does as well but the only way you increase the chance is either favourable conditions or pray. In terms of favorable conditions you have him play with much better players (which happened this season at times) and have him play favorable lines.   It is true that at least most stats guys aren't really stats guys and often they underestimate the concept of regression to the mean. For instance, often CORSI regression is ignored but is equally possible in the long term. There is a lot going on but statistics are powerful but difficult cognitively to get right, if not then you have noise and poor decision making, leading to terrible contracts or missed opportunities."

CalgaryFlames,3cfwvi,lancemeszaros,9,Tue Jul 7 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the article is demonizing Bouma, just highlighting why the Flames might not want to overpay (if he's asking for a big payday).

""Nobody will question Bouma's work ethic or willingness to block shots, for example, to help the team. The problem is the reason he piles up so many is because he spends too much time - relative to his teammates - chasing play in his own zone.""   He is also a 15+ goal scorer    ""Another red flag is that he shot 15.4% last year after scoring on just 6.1% of his shots as a rookie. It's possible he'll score at a better rate than he did in his first year, however, I don't think he woke up one day a much better shooter and is now 2.5 times more efficient than he was as a rookie.""   and a leader in the lockeroom   I have never heard anyone suggest he was a leader in the locker room, especially as a second year full timer. Where did you hear this?"
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,MattFiresideChat,15,Tue Jul 7 15:18:46 2015 UTC,janko looks good  Here are some links to 5 videos I took today (I'll edit as I get more uploaded)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka2411aO9N4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63coA4JVlg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W16kjpc6NLo  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIktc9cENss  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRcfyD7eHI
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,canadam,4,Tue Jul 7 16:37:55 2015 UTC,Love to hear that. I assume his skating and puck control stand out? And is he showing some offensive flair?
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,patefacio,4,Tue Jul 7 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"yes, to everything. He completely undressed on of the goalies in one of the drills, kind of like the Colborne move, but it was all in close."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,canadam,3,Tue Jul 7 18:33:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Jankowski was the best player on the ice in my opinion."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,teckhz,2,Tue Jul 7 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"Just because this is the top comment, I dd break down everyone below, but they are at the bottom."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,alivirji,7,Tue Jul 7 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"top 3 guys thus far are Janko #1 by far, Klimchuk and Hickey"
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,fknSamsquamptch,3,Tue Jul 7 17:04:58 2015 UTC,I'm not surprised to hear that. I watched all three of them a bit this year and was super impressed with them each time - especially with Hickey.
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,alivirji,3,Tue Jul 7 17:07:22 2015 UTC,Does this imply that Bennett isn't one of the best 3 guys so far? Or are you ignoring him?
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,But-Seriously-Though,6,Tue Jul 7 17:16:56 2015 UTC,"no, Bennett's was just okay in the morning. A little lax compared to his usual motor."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,alivirji,5,Tue Jul 7 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Treliving probably told him to chill. I read somewhere that BT said he didn't like kids going all out at development camp, because they need to focus on development and not making an impact right now (save that for training camp). Since Bennett is almost a lock for the roster, there's no reason for him to over do it right now."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,canadam,4,Tue Jul 7 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was part of the reason for reducing camp by a day.  Focus is more on the off-ice stuff."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,alivirji,2,Wed Jul 8 01:55:05 2015 UTC,What's your read on Klimchuk and Hickey (especially Hickey)?
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Rooster697,6,Tue Jul 7 19:23:58 2015 UTC,"Klimchuk will likely spend the year in Stockton with a recall or two maybe later in the season. He looks like a more reliable version of Glencross.   Hickey looks like the next TJ Brodie, except bigger. He's a force out there. If I had to guarantee a player becoming an NHL player from 1 day of a development camp, Hickey would be the one."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,superdude99,3,Tue Jul 7 23:01:21 2015 UTC,"Our defensive prospect pool has just exploded over the past 2 years, it's incredible"
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"Pats season ticket holder here (also an oiler fan but I come in peace just wanted to see how your camp was going) watched Klimmer for 2.5 years every home game and he is not at all Glencross like, he doesn't really enjoy the physical aspect of the game, honestly he's kinda injury prone so I was happy to see him stay away from that,  that being said he doesn't play scared and will take a hit if he absolutely must. He's more of a less skilled Hudler if you want to compare him to a current roster player. At least he was when he was with the pats, I don't wanma tell you your wrong, maybe he's changed his game since the WHL trade deadline or in order to make the flames, it wouldn't shock me if he did."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Circlesmirk,-5,Wed Jul 8 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. You can kinda tell which picks last year were Burke picks and which were Treliving, and Hickey seems like a BT pick. Definitely a steal in the 3rd."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Roughly6Owls,4,Wed Jul 8 00:07:20 2015 UTC,I mean - how can you actually tell that? Burke has drafted some great players with other organizations.
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Circlesmirk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, just a hunch. I feel like Smith and Carroll were Burke picks, based on his #truculence mentality. Both were still very good picks, but they were a bit different than what BT seems to go for. I never said Burke didn't draft well tho."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,patefacio,5,Wed Jul 8 02:21:56 2015 UTC,"Carroll was a Tom Webster pick, the Flames let him pick whoever he wanted as it was the final pick before his retirement. Seems like a great pick nonetheless"
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Kellervo,10,Wed Jul 8 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'll break down each of the players in each group  Group A  Sieloff - He has a really good shot, but is very average outside of that. Not much different than Ramage except his shot.   Klimchuk - Very linear player that does what needs doing. Very accurate shot, picked many corners. His shot will make him a 15+ goal scorer in the NHL.   Andersson - Not very noticeable at either end of the ice. Not surprising because it's his first camp.   Carroll - He will be an NHL player at some point. Good depth mucker with skill. Think Ferland.  Hathaway - I don't recall seeing him.  Mattsson - He didn't stand out much, which is neither good or bad.   Toth - Walk On Goalie. He was okay.   Smith - He's bigger than this time last year. Still could get slightly faster, but he's right on track.  Kanzig - The most improved player from last year. His foot speed has improved and looks competent and composed defensively.  Jankowski - By far the best player today. Hands are as quick as his mind and he uses both effectively to give the defense and goalies fits. He is fast on his feet as well. Nice to see. Can't wait to see him in a Flames jersey.   Marcotte - Looked skilled, but didn't stand out as being particularly special.   Karnaukhov - See Marcotte.   Bruce - He's strong, but needs a lot of work like Kanzig did when he was picked."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,canadam,3,Tue Jul 7 22:34:56 2015 UTC,My cousin constantly taunts me about us taking Janko over Maatta...I hope I can shut him down one day!
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,patefacio,2,Wed Jul 8 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"You will, Janko looks like he'll be a good NHLer soon."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,canadam,0,Wed Jul 8 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"I mean, there's an argument that the primary reason Janko shouldn't have been a first round pick is because he probably could've been safely picked in the sixth or seventh round -- that won't change regardless of his NHL calibre, even if he turns into the best player in his class -- and it's a pretty good argument. There's a reason teams usually reserve high-schoolers to the late round picks."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,patefacio,4,Wed Jul 8 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"It's not a good argument at all though, as he was ranked in the 2nd round and Montreal was rumoured to have him as their next pick on their list too."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Cali-kins,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to claim I'm familiar with the context of the 2012 draft, but with three years of hindsight and ignoring the fact that Jankowski's actually turned out really well in college and that I'm cautiously optimistic for him, I'm finding it hard to see why David Jankowski was an honourable mention (i.e. expected to go undrafted, but not a crazy off-the-board pick in the 6th/7th, and he did go undrafted) this year having outscored his brother on the same team in the same league, while Marky Mark was ranked in the second round and actually deserved to go there.  My initial post was wrong, and professional scouts were much higher on him than I thought: he was ranked 43rd overall by NHL's scouting services. But Maatta was ranked 8th, while Gaunce was ranked 13th, and Matteau, Sissons, Skjei, and Frk were all top-20 and on the board. I still feel that Jankowski, whether he works out or not, can be considered an objectively bad pick because there were less risky options available that still projected to be top level players -- in the context of last draft, it's almost identical to the Bruins passing on Barzal or Connor for Senyshyn, and I feel that lots of people will consider Senyshyn a bad pick whether he turns out or not."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,canadam,2,Wed Jul 8 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong... I wanted Maatta. But if the scouting staff truly believed Jankowski to have the higher potential as a player, then I fully support their decision to draft him where they did."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Circlesmirk,8,Wed Jul 8 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"Group C   Nakladal - Was traded into group B. Looked like a 27 year old player at a development camp. If he didn't stand out, there would be a major problem.   Studnicka - Did not notice him  Kulak - Looked like a player that has an NHL game under his belt. Very composed. Better by a long shot.  McDonald - More composed with less wasted energy than last season. Looks good. Having him and Gillies in the pipeline will help significantly.   Lomberg - Did not notice  Foguth - Did not notice  Dombrock - Did not notice  Dienes - Did not notice  Hawkins - He and Baillie were the best of the walk ons. Very fast with a good shot and nose to the net.   DeBlouw - Good bounce back in his final development camp. This year is a make or break one. He was a stand out a few years ago and then fell off the map. If he continues the play he had today through the balance of the season, he will earn a contract."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Wolff_Fucker,6,Tue Jul 7 22:36:26 2015 UTC,Did anyone else see Glencross in the stands there? That was a surprise.
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Newtothisredditbiz,8,Tue Jul 7 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"Given his attachment to the Stampede, not surprised. Probably taking a break from the rodeo!"
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,GrooveTherapy,6,Tue Jul 7 19:49:26 2015 UTC,Apparently Monahan was there too?
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Newtothisredditbiz,6,Tue Jul 7 19:48:52 2015 UTC,I spoke to him and Kris Russell for a few minutes.
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,WeightOfTheheNewYear,3,Tue Jul 7 19:50:17 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Nice guys?
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,superdude99,8,Tue Jul 7 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they both were. Monahan is bigger than I expected in person, and Russell is smaller."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,WeedWackHerHedge,3,Tue Jul 7 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Me and my boyfriend were at chinook mall and while i was buying a slurpee from whatever store is by the foodcourt i saw him yell ""holy shit your Sean Monahan"". He got a picture and said he was so polite and more than willing to do so. Just a classy guy. While i walked out i bumped into someone and he thoroughly apologized like it was his fault. My boyfriend mentioned as soon as they walked away, that it was Mikael Backlund. From my experience they are just both great guys. Apparently Backlund took the pic as well and just did not care that somone else was getting the attention"
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Roughly6Owls,8,Tue Jul 7 22:48:44 2015 UTC,"group B  Gillies - Steady as always. Is a bit quicker on his feet and laterally than before.   Poirier - Was traded for Nakladal and played in the afternoon. Fast as always but was missing a lot of his shots.   Soustal - Did not notice outside one awesome play.   Bennett - He did not have a great day. Not a big deal.  Hickey - He's going to be an awesome player some day. Learned a lot from Eichel and Oksanen in BU in how to approach things off the ice, and it's paying dividends on it. Stellar play.   Fram - I did not notice him much  Mangiapane - He's a skilled player. Reminds me a bit of Agostino, although not as polished, which is to be expected.  Jutzi - Did not stand out  Proulx - Did stand out as being a terrible skater with a poor shot. Linden Penner territory of bad from a couple years ago.   Myers - He is big and fast. A good combination for a D-man. Need to see more."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,alivirji,5,Tue Jul 7 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"Kylington, Arnold, Andersson, Mangiapane, Smith, Jankowski, and Hickey. Well, and Bennett obviously."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,WeightOfTheheNewYear,4,Tue Jul 7 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"Great list. I'll add Nakladal, Poirier, Carroll, Culkin, and Hathaway"
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,CuggyofHouseAbby,10,Tue Jul 7 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"anderson hasn't been too bad, not noticeable though.  Mangiapane has skill but is a little weak, gets pushed off the puck easily.   Carroll is looking good  Janko is the best player out there  Bennett is doing alright (he's Bennett, he's going to be one of the top guys even if he's just doing okay)  Klimchuk is picking corners with ease  Hickey and Kanzig are the top d thus far. Gillies is shutting the door."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Rideyn,8,Tue Jul 7 17:01:19 2015 UTC,Janko best player...oh my god. There is hope!
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,iChron,6,Tue Jul 7 18:30:21 2015 UTC,The guy has crazy skills. The question is whether he put bulk on that skinny frame and play well in game situations.
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Rideyn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:49 2015 UTC,re with both a tablet and transformer book and will be giving updates on players. If there's anyone you want to kno   Thanks for doing this man. What have they been doing?  Drills?  Scrimmage?
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Rideyn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:11:32 2015 UTC,drills only today. They'll be doing a scrimmage on Thurs
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,Rideyn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:34:13 2015 UTC,Anything noticeable about Wolf? Word from Adirondack last year was he was one of their best players.
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,locoenchilada,4,Tue Jul 7 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"Group D  Baillie - He and Hawkins were the best of the walkon forwards not only this year, but the last two years. That includes Josh Jooris, who was very good. Both were more dynamic than Jooris was in his first camp. If they continue their play, it'll be very difficult to not consider offering contracts.   Morrison - If the Flames did not already have 7-8 guys in the NHL as we sit right now, I'd say he would be a strong challenger for an opening day roster spot. He might even earn one if he keeps it up.   Kylington - Raw skill. Very high end skill. He needs to improve defensively and with skating backwards, which at times he got caught flat footed, but that will come. Spoke to him after the thing was over and he is a very personable player. Very confident in his own abilities and knows exactly what he needs to do to improve.   Culkin - Is 100% and his shot is coming along good. He will be competing for a spot in the NHL. All of Kulak, Culkin, Wotherspoon and Morrison are NHL ready, there just are not enough spots for them all.   Pitt - I didn't notice him much.   Clark - He was better than some of the walk on goalies that we have had in the past, but not someone worth signing.  Gilmour - He is steadily improving. Looks a little more solid than last year.   Marchment - Feisty forward with some speed and good hands. I could see him being signed to an AHL deal like Garnet Hathaway was last year.   Wilkins - Did not notice him."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,locoenchilada,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:36:41 2015 UTC,Would not be surprised if Morrison made Wideman Expendable this season and Wotherspoon beat out Engelland for the 6th spot.
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,donksdonksdonks,2,Wed Jul 8 01:04:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it could happen, it's just those damn contracts. Yet they both have 2 years left I believe so retaining salary wouldn't be a bad option."
CalgaryFlames,3cfmou,donksdonksdonks,3,Wed Jul 8 05:25:26 2015 UTC,Baillie
CalgaryFlames,3cglbo,speno87,7,Tue Jul 7 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"We did get less than we should have on that trade regardless. However, Klimchuk looks really promising, he could definitely be a top 6 winger if he can get over his injuries fully, and Agostino had an amazing 2nd half of the season in the AHL this year, so he could definitely pan out. I'm sure we'll sign him. Hanowski was let go of tho."
CalgaryFlames,3cglbo,alivirji,2,Tue Jul 7 19:26:13 2015 UTC,"Agostino was qualified,  he can't walk unless he doesn't want to play  next season"
CalgaryFlames,3cglbo,Pretty_Fly_For_A_,3,Tue Jul 7 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"Agostino looked pretty good in Adirondack last season, hopefully he pans out"
CalgaryFlames,3cglbo,Rooster697,0,Tue Jul 7 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of surprised Hanowski was let go. I remember him having a really good first half of the season, was it two seasons ago? He was on fire in the A, but then got injured. I guess the flames lost patience with his inconsistency and he got bumped in favour of fresh blood."
CalgaryFlames,3cglbo,Suneal,2,Tue Jul 7 20:20:54 2015 UTC,His skating was always going to keep him from being a fulltime NHLer. If he doesn't get picked up by another team (about 50/50 IMO) I'm certain we would sign him to an AHL deal so he can lead the farm team. Word has it he was a great mentor and leader on the farm.
CalgaryFlames,3cglbo,Moose11,0,Tue Jul 7 20:27:50 2015 UTC,"I read last year he couldn't even play on the 2nd PP unit in Adirondack because of his footspeed, they used McGrattan instead"

CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,jonos360,12,Tue Jul 7 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"We have superior defensive pairings no question and even though people say our offence isn't as good, our first line definitely were not pushovers last season. With the addition of consistent newcomers like Sam Bennett, Dougie Hamilton and Michael Frolik, the entire team has nowhere to go but up. If Ramo can elevate his game to near what Kipper did for the Flames for a long time, we should be a thorn in Edmonton's side for a good amount of time to come."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,Chronixx,14,Tue Jul 7 11:03:36 2015 UTC,"No kidding we were 6th in the NHL in goals.   Most points/goals by defenseman as well.  The common narrative about the Oilers is always ""exciting, talent young players"" yet finished 26th overall in GF last year. Just wait by Halloween they will be eliminated from the playoff race and the fans will be blaming the coach and the goalies. Like they do every year."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,CuggyofHouseAbby,5,Tue Jul 7 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"Ad god forbid McJesus isn't leading the league in goals, or has an off-night with the rest of the team by December. Edmonton is a powderkeg of expectations, ready to explode and hail jerseys from the bleachers."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,DefinitelyOrMaybeNot,16,Tue Jul 7 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"Edmonton is stacked in offence, or should be, with a plethora of top 10 picks. That said, I doubt all of them will consistently reach the level they could have had they not been picked by Edmonton.  The answer to McDavid is to use our ""brick wall"" move, where we use our top defensive pairing, DOUGIE FUCKING HAMILTON and force Russell to block everything, including McDavid himself. We will also use our ""Fuck the nucks"" move, where Ferland will drain McDavid's Jesus power by checking him into McTavish hell"
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,AznSparks,6,Tue Jul 7 08:20:06 2015 UTC,"Ferland is best used against irrelevant D-men (see: entire Canucks D-core) and Edmonton's is hands down the worst in the league. I'd say throw the Ferland line out against everyone but McDavid so we can get a very physical cycle going, then throw out Hudreauhan against the weakened/tired/bruised line.  Have a Frolik/Backlund/Bennett (?) line on McDavid's ass all game, keeping McDavid out of dangerous territory. Put whatever combination from our top 5 D out, they can handle it. That line is gonna cause so many turnovers and drive McDavid and McLellan bonkers.  Boom. McDavid is neutralized, Oilers D get punished, Hudreauhan gets space."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,HKizzle,2,Tue Jul 7 14:59:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully Ferlys Mom doesn't say that he can't hit McDavid. I really wanted him to smash Daniel and Henrik last year and it didn't happen :(
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,DefinitelyOrMaybeNot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"As much as we're in love with the offensive firepower that Monny, Huds, Gaudreau, Bennett can/will bring to the Flames, we should recognize that Backlund, Frolik, Monny, can play great defensive, responsible, 2 way hockey. And with one of the better defensive squads in the league, defense will likely be winning us more games than 3rd-period scoring rallies."

CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,HKizzle,2,Wed Jul 8 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"True, but Stajan is great at back checking and provides good support on a rush going the other way. What I could see with these lines on is a good rush-counterrush shift."

CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,juridiculous,6,Wed Jul 8 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"One possibility I can see happening is with all the offensive excitement of McDavid, the other forwards get too focused on making pretty, skilled plays and nobody wants to go in the corners or play D; a problem that already exists in EDM that I see getting worse.   I think the Flames are still the better team but the rivalry will be good."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,But-Seriously-Though,3,Tue Jul 7 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"the other forwards get too focused on making pretty, skilled plays and nobody wants to go in the corners or play D   I don't think that's a future problem. I think it's a current (and continuing) problem for the Oilers."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,MattFiresideChat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"Another possibility is the hype wraps up other teams and they put to much focus on McJesus, and then we sneak in with the Eberles and Halls of the world and beat guys that way... Truth be told there's no way to tell, my opinion as an oilers fan which is obviously the anti christ of most of yours bias wise, is that if mcdavid can play like a 1st line center this year we finish ahead of the Flames, If he can't (and that's very possible) you guys beat us, your D will give us hell but outside the top line Im not really scared of the Flames forwards. Our D is still bad but had improved tremendously, same with goaltending, we also should take into account that we get to play for a coach that isn't bat shit crazy and won't use swarm style for 82 games. All in all its gonna be a great rivalry going forward and im excited so see what happens this year and in years to come, both teams should be very good and both fan bases will always be convinced they are better. Good luck this year, except when you play us. Let the down votes begin.  Edit: good lord how do I change that flair"
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,lancemeszaros,9,Wed Jul 8 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"The Oilers lack depth. The Flames do not.  Contain McDavid as well as their team contains our first line and allow the depth to do the balance of the damage.   The Oilers will be better, but they won't be good."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,locoenchilada,4,Tue Jul 7 10:42:32 2015 UTC,"Oilers have the better top 6, Calgary has the better everything else.  Games against them will focus on using our bottom 6 to shut down their top 6, allowing out top 6 to pick apart the rest."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,Aplicado,8,Tue Jul 7 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"I still think, even with the addition of McDavid that we are still the better all-around team."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,Shodspartan100,-1,Tue Jul 7 08:06:17 2015 UTC,"Madness. Better coach? Nope. Better top line? Ours is more proven. Better defense? Hahaha. Better goalie? maybe Talbot is good/maybe crumbles with the shitty D up there.   Edmonton's 9 year rebuild won't just cease when McJesus plays the first game. Train wrecks take time to untangle, and will still have residual culture issues that don't just disappear. Old boys gonna old boys club until Katzy cashes in after the arena is up."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,locoenchilada,2,Tue Jul 7 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"We do have a better coach. McLellan is great, don't get me wrong but if he wasn't able to coach San Jose to a stanley cup with the insane amount of talent they had on that team in the last 5 years, then he's not good enough. He'll make a huge difference to Edmonton, but Hartley is better. The two top lines are pretty good but again the Flames have the edge unless McDavid really does prove to be a fire extinguisher. As for defense and goaltending, hands down Calgary. Talbot has been pretty good but that was with good defense back in New York. Edmonton's defense is their weakest part of the team so past goalies like Scrivens and Dubnyk never really got to build confidence and experience in the crease."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,CuggyofHouseAbby,2,Tue Jul 7 22:29:10 2015 UTC,You might shadow banned man. You should look into that. I have to approve every comment you make.
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,DefinitelyOrMaybeNot,6,Tue Jul 7 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"Their team is still junk. 2 new back up goalies from teams with amazing defenses. Burned a 1st trading for a cement feet AHL defender who isn't ready, but hey he was an Oil King.  Their problem was never goaltending in a vacuum, it was lack of quality defenseman and really poor defensive commitment by their golden child first overalls.  Overall I think they just need about 4 more first overall picks and they might be ready to compete"
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,SteakSauceAwwYeah,2,Tue Jul 7 13:04:06 2015 UTC,4 more defenseman that can play defense would probably help more. Not sure how they're ever going to get them though.
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,BN_Flames_Fan,2,Tue Jul 7 16:08:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really have anything to add to discussion asides from the their goalie, Talbot. I follow the Rangers very closely, so I had the opportunity to see the team play when he started. I see a lot of comments about the defense being stacked in front of Talbot but I don't know if this is necessarily true...though I don't know if it's because I'm biased given the fact that I'll notice things here and there a non-fan wouldn't otherwise.   I foresee Talbot being a bit shaky for the first while. When he started with the Rangers, he wasn't really doing all that well for maybe ~2 weeks worth of games, but quickly adjusted his game. And so I wonder if he would be able to do the same thing in EDM...not necessarily doubting his abilities, but rather, having to deal with being on a new team + new coaches + constant starter, it might take a bit of time for him to adjust.   In any case, he improved his game very quickly (I mean, I think a two week turn around time is really good). Although you could attribute that to the goalie coach, Benoit Allaire, I feel like there has to be some innate ability/talent/whatever you want to call it that would have allowed him to adjust THAT quickly as well. Moreover, when he got comfortable, there were times where the Rangers' D would go completely out the window...and he'd be the one saving our asses. A really good example of this would be the Rangers/Panthers game (I think some time around march?) He had about 39 saves (the SOG weren't shitty by any means, either) and was honestly one of the only reasons why we stayed alive that game.   Any ways, I've just come to really like the guy, so again, perhaps I am a little biased. But I still wouldn't undermine his ability to do well...  Other than that, I still see Calgary being the better team. Given that they've been rebuilding/playing as a really solid unit for ~2-3 years now + Playoff experience (and without Gio!), I think they'll just have a better idea of what to do. Yes, the offense of EDM might be scary but...I dunno. I get the feeling they'll be going through a ton of adjustments after wiping out the coaches/head guys/changed players/etc. I certainly do not see them doing as bad as last season (third last, I think?) but I don't see them making the Playoffs or anything like that either. If anything, maybe they'll be a little bit like the Flames in the 2013-2014 season (ranking wise). I know for the past many years they've talked about rebuilding, but I think last year really was their ""rock bottom"", and I don't think they'll have anywhere to go but up at this point."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,juridiculous,5,Tue Jul 7 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"Edmonton's downfall is always putting their top draft picks on their 1st line. They don't give them the time to mature and develop into quality NHL players in the AHL or with sheltered minutes in the NHL. If they do the same to McDavid, they will most likely be picking first overall again next year."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,spumpkin914,7,Tue Jul 7 09:26:50 2015 UTC,"Well now they have 4 1st overall picks, so they've been forced to add depth to the second line."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,tehReno,3,Tue Jul 7 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"Oilers suffer from a lack of leadership. They have tons of first round picks who are piled with all the hopes and dreams for the whole team on their shoulders and nobody to properly lead. Their only saving grace might be McLellan, but we will have to see how the team reacts to him. Flames will still rule this season."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,iChron,3,Tue Jul 7 14:03:04 2015 UTC,Oilers suffer from a lack of leadership.   I am going to hold judgement on this - since this off season they turned the box upside down and shook out all the assholes.   The Good Ol' Boys club in Edmonton is gone....I am looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,Beloche,2,Tue Jul 7 14:52:42 2015 UTC,"Their team is literally just 2 lines of fire power and that's it.   They haven't had trouble scoring, They only have trouble keeping a lead or playing catch up because their D and goalies are basically non-existent. That's almost been their curse from having to pick #1 so many times is they are forced into taking another high skilled forwards. Getting McDavid is 100% positive obviously but it still doesn't fix their lack of forward depth and D. Talbot's numbers are surely to drop this year although he will be an improvement.  Edmonton is built right now for scoring and scoring only. We've realized in these past couple of years how important it is to roll 4 lines deep, Having a good reliable shut down line that can pitch in with some secondary scoring."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,theFlamingRaven,3,Tue Jul 7 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"The kicker is that they sucked at scoring last season.  The Oilers were 26th in the league in terms of goals per game (The Flames were 7th).  A part of the problem was probably that, last year, the Oilers really did not care where they shot the puck from.  They racked up a lot of weak perimeter shots and, as a result, their possession stats don't look bad.  Still, they really failed to take the puck into the slot and do the dirty deeds necessary to score goals.  Last season, Edmonton was built to take shots, not score goals.    The Flames should not take the Oilers lightly next season.  Chiarelli actually appears to be a competent guy and the Oilers have, arguably, taken bigger strides forward this off season than even the Flames.  There are still some big areas of concern though.    Forwards: The top 6 is stacked with high profile draft picks.  Some of those players are not living up to their projected potential, but there's the possibility better coaching could suddenly turn those top two lines into the offensive powerhouse you speak of.  I consider it a long shot.  It's going to take time and an injection of grit to turn those kids into the players they were supposed to be.  The Oilers' bottom six forwards are still not very good.  The Flames are a very top-heavy team that falls off dramatically after the Monahan line, but their bottoms lines don't even come close to the depths of suck the Oilers' bottom six are in.    Defence: The Oilers' blueline is still a steaming pile, albeit slightly less fragrant than it was.  Chiarelli has added Sekera, who will improve the Oilers' first pair considerably, but the bottom four are still AHL quality. Nurse is challenging for a spot and will probably be very good, but not for a couple of years.  Chiarelli added Griffin Reinhart, who could be a good defenceman in a few years, but also isn't ready yet.  Defence is still a major weakness for the Oilers, especially when compared to the beefed up Flames' blueline.    Net: Scrivens and Fasth had great career sv%'s before last season.  A small sample as sheltered backups made them look much better than they really were.  Cam Talbot looks even better than they did, but that's still based on a relatively small sample size during which Talbot played mostly backup games.  He could rise to the occasion and be a big upgrade for the Oilers, or he could suck.  It's almost impossible for him to suck as bad as Scrivens and Fasth did last season though.  My money is on goal-tending being much improved for the Oilers this season, even though Chiarelli should be looking for a proven starter.  The Flames have two proven starters in Ramo and Hiller.  Talbot might be better than either of these guys, but the odds do not favour this.    Bottom Line: The Oilers are going to be better than they were last season.  I doubt the Flames will sweep the season series again.  That being said, the Oilers still aren't a playoff team.  The rebuild finally seems under way in the former city of champions, but it still has a long ways to go.  MacT tanked this team hard for McDavid, and cleaning up his mess will take years, even with McDavid on board."
CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,DestroDertell,2,Tue Jul 7 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Another question on the topic; Is anyone even slightly intimidated by the Oilers?  I can see them taking one,  maybe. MAYBE, two games from us this year.  Which in hindsight would have been taking us out of the playoffs last year. The Flames are better though.  We will be under the radar in terms of hockey in Alberta, which may be ok.  This Battle of Alberta will be better... not the 80's though"

CalgaryFlames,3cehnt,patrickthebeerguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:38:04 2015 UTC,Their team is stacked with high forward picks. Totally lack defence and despite having a few good goalies they look terrible. Dubnyk was as Vezina nominee in Minn but got shipped out of Edmonton. Any goalie would look horrible with no defence in front of him. Calgary may not have McJesus but our team is meshing well and we have depth. Plus we have what may be the leagues best d!

One day I'd like to do a hybrid analysis of the draft, and what those traded draft picks became.  The organization has done a great job identifying talent and bringing them in for low risk draft picks, which would not normally return a player of much value.  Specifically Colborne (4th) and Russell (5th), and to a certain extent Shore (4th- ish) and Bollig (3rd). Great asset management right there."

CalgaryFlames,3cdnkp,iChron,3,Tue Jul 7 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"Nakladl I think will start in the AHL. Not that that's a bad thing, just gives him a chance to get used to the north american game. That's the beauty of him being on a 2-way contract.  Smid, I hope we see some news on him soon. I wonder if his career is actually finished. It would hurt me to see him go out like this.   Engelland, I think will be used as an extra D-man if Wotherspoon has an unreal camp and makes the jump.  All that taken into account, I see our D pairs lining up like this.  Giordano - Hamilton  Russell - Brodie  Wideman - Morrison  Extra: Engelland, Wotherspoon"
CalgaryFlames,3cdnkp,locoenchilada,7,Tue Jul 7 02:56:28 2015 UTC,You think they'll break up Gio and Brodie? I see it more as Gio/Brodie with the occasional Hamilton tossed in. Maybe powerplay/pk.

CalgaryFlames,3cdnkp,Mr-Rocafella,5,Tue Jul 7 03:27:21 2015 UTC,I see Hamilton playing the top because like Giordano he's [Hamilton] is very mobile. Giordano and Hamilton have potential to be even deadlier than Brodie - Giordano.

Nakladal is waiver exempt because this is his first year with an NHL contract (I think). If we sign him next year with a 2 way contract he would not be waiver exempt because of his age."
CalgaryFlames,3cdnkp,jibbybonk,2,Tue Jul 7 05:08:36 2015 UTC,"Nakladal's waiver-exempt for one year or until he plays one NHL game, whichever comes first.  So if he comes up, he's staying up."

I think the key thing to remember is that the ""base"" of the jersey is nearly the same across sites (assuming you are buying licensed ones, and not knock-offs). The key difference is the customization job.     FOR LICENSED JERSEYS    If it's not too late by now, check out http://www.icejerseys.com/   They currently have a July 4th sale where you can save 25-30% off your purchase (depends on how much you spend). I managed to pick up a customized Premier jersey for about $145 (and customized authentics at $275), which is pretty good in my opinion. Not to mention, I think they actually stitch the names and numbers on, as opposed to shop.NHL.com which heat-presses it on.    Some other sites   www.coolhockey.com www.sportsk.com www.rivercitysports.com  These are sites on the side bar over at /r/hockeyjerseys. Again, it's better if you wait for a promo for these sites (coolhockey and rivercity will have them; sportsk is less likely) because you can usually save anything between 15-30%. Since it is the off-season and you might not get the chance to wear the jersey as much as you'd like at this point, it certainly wouldn't hurt to sign up for their emails or just check out what they have once in awhile. Coolhockey (and IceJerseys) tend to have quite a few promos, and will often have something on a holiday (eg. Canada Day, Fourth of July, Christmas, Black Friday, all that). I've signed up for Rivercity's emailing thing, and they send out sales fairly often as well. I've just had a terrible postal issue with them lately, and while it wasn't their fault (it was Canada Post, mostly), ergh...I might not buy from them again (their communication isn't the greatest in my opinion). But other people have had great experiences with them, so maybe I was just a bit unlucky this time. Sportsk doesn't ever really have sales since the stuff is so marked down already, but I love looking at their site moreso for the ""non-typical"" inventory they have (eg. vintage jerseys/sweaters, patches, older teams, etc.)   I actually avoid shop.NHL.com   I know people buy from them, but I would avoid them because (i) they're usually a lot more expensive than other sites, especially when you take promo codes into consideration, and (ii) their customization job is not that great. Unlike many other sites that stitch the names/numbers on (eg. IceJerseys, CoolHockey, and I think sportsk.com), the NHL site just heat presses them on. Now, it wouldn't be so bad, but at least on my jersey, it's a bit ""warped"" and they placed the name/numbers WAY too low. Someone was kind enough to gift me this jersey, so I honestly have nothing to complain about and I do really love it. But I think it's still fair to mention it, especially since they do cost a good chunk of money + may as well look for the best quality thing out there.    FullMoonJerseys on eBay sells cheap and legit stuff   http://stores.ebay.ca/fullmoonjerseys/ The reason why they're so cheap is for a variety of reasons, I think: (i) A lot of players are no longer with the team, (ii) might be some odd sizes, and (iii) I've heard that they occasionally sell jerseys that have slight factory defaults (eg. stitching on one arm might be a little off or something). I've occasionally seen blank jerseys, so there might actually be something off with the jersey. But if you're worried about it, I'm sure you could always send them a message and ask them about it. Any ways, even though some of the players might not be on the team anymore, I know some people like them. OR, if I'm not mistaken, they also use the heat-pressed stuff to pop the name plate/numbers on. I'd still ask them, but if this is indeed the case, if you're really up for a little project you can actually remove the letters yourself (look this up, because people have done it...they either use heat to re-heat the glue or acetone, I think).  Once these letters are removed, if you can find someone who will customize it for you a bit cheaper, it might be worth doing this than buying a completely new one (depends, but maybe could get it at around $100-120). Again, it depends on what you're up for. The only downside is that shipping costs is a bit killer :/.      KNOCKOFFS     I haven't really looked so far into this, but, I know aliexepress is a VERY common place to get these jerseys. However, there are TONS of sellers selling them, so make sure you really pick someone you think is trust worthy + ask them any questions you may have. Because still, even if they're really cheap you don't want to spent money on something that looks like complete shit or falls apart after two wears or something.      OTHER RANDOM THOUGHTS/RESOURCES     Could try eBay? But again, you have to be super careful about what you're looking at.  /r/hockeyjerseys has a lot of sources, but don't ask them about knock-offs. Their focus is on licensed stuff (whether it's the replicas or authentics).  And...yep. Sorry I didn't mean to write so much. I've done a fair amount of poking around for jerseys and this is what I've kind of learned so far. I think the thing to keep in mind is, you should never have to pay full price for a jersey (well, maybe the only exception would be if it was game-worn or signed or something). But yeah. Sometimes it's not fun waiting around for sales/promos, but if I could save like ~25% on a jersey, why not.    Good luck!"
CalgaryFlames,3c9j0u,SteakSauceAwwYeah,6,Mon Jul 6 07:37:36 2015 UTC,do you want nhl licensed and authentic or are you fine with a knockoff that you can barely tell the difference on?  I use aliexpress if the knockoff is your choice
CalgaryFlames,3c9j0u,platypus_bear,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:54:52 2015 UTC,Aliexpress is great. I got a chargers jersey and its great condition
CalgaryFlames,3c9j0u,Ninjygingy,3,Tue Jul 7 05:22:04 2015 UTC,Icejerseys.com has the best value for money i've seen. You save a few tens of dollars but the quality is identical to what you'd see at jersey city.
CalgaryFlames,3c9j0u,Mastered_Baiting,2,Mon Jul 6 06:46:23 2015 UTC,"You have a choice. You can get a real authentic jersey that will last even if you wear it lots.  You can buy a cheap knockoff jersey that will last only if you treat it gently and rarely wear it.   Official jerseys can be found browsing the nhl store or http://www.flamesport.com/store/department/1/Calgary-Flames/  No advice on where to find knockoff jerseys, Ive never bought one of them. I know you can get cheap clothing made from China sent straight to you though, might be worthwhile checking out some foreign places online."
CalgaryFlames,3c9j0u,jibbybonk,2,Mon Jul 6 05:31:25 2015 UTC,"I'm looking to buy a new Jersey here too, does anyone have any idea if there will be a new alternate this year? I think it's usually leaked by now if there are any changes to the jerseys for next year."
CalgaryFlames,3c9j0u,Waldo76,3,Mon Jul 6 07:19:53 2015 UTC,I use nhl.com - I like authentic jerseys as opposed to fakes.
CalgaryFlames,3c9j0u,locoenchilada,2,Mon Jul 6 04:23:16 2015 UTC,I would look into coolhockey.com in the future. They do a lot better job on their customization than nhl.com does.

CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,berto_14,19,Sun Jul 5 21:13:04 2015 UTC,Arbitrator: well Paul your hands do appear to be made of stone
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,jad35,8,Sun Jul 5 22:56:11 2015 UTC,If Bouma is over $2mill we are over paying. My predictions are as follows  Bouma - 2 years 1.8  Byron - 1 year 1.1  Jooris - 2 years 1.25  All 3 are significant increases over their previous contracts
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,Waldo76,3,Mon Jul 6 00:03:15 2015 UTC,Thing is I feel like we're offering Bouma ~ 2 million and that's the reason he filed for salary arbitration.
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,WeedWackHerHedge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:04:47 2015 UTC,"Trie has a rep for playing hard ball in negotiations, I bet he is offering around 1.2 mill which is about a 60% salary increase, QO was a 10% increase if im not mistaken."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,Waldo76,2,Mon Jul 6 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, these numbers are far more realistic"
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,logan_izer10,6,Mon Jul 6 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"Not all that uncommon, especially if they got low-balled with their qualifying offers.   Hopefully this doesn't result in us over-paying."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,locoenchilada,6,Sun Jul 5 21:33:27 2015 UTC,I feel like we'll end up overpaying Bouma.
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,WeedWackHerHedge,3,Sun Jul 5 21:40:56 2015 UTC,Me too.   I also feel like Byron might think he's worth more.
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,locoenchilada,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"Byron's actually one of the best penalty killers on the team, and he's a positive possession player. If we're choosing between either him or Bouma, Byron's the better option for addressing needs. Unfortunately his size is a problem, in that he's never going to be a guy that keeps opposition players from taking liberties with our young kids."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,Circlesmirk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"Hes become expendable  with the addition of Frolik. It's nice to have lots of PK guys,  but our elite pk winger will be Frolik now, and he is far more deadly in the offensive zone."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,Pretty_Fly_For_A_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:48:20 2015 UTC,Byron's gonna be asking for north of 2 million. I'd bet on it.
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,WeedWackHerHedge,7,Sun Jul 5 21:47:45 2015 UTC,He'd be worth it if a) he could stay in the line up and b) Convert on 30% of his breakaways
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,WeightOfTheheNewYear,2,Sun Jul 5 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"If he came to camp and blew everyone away? Maybe he could be worth it. I like what he brought (other than the scoring, yeah) last year, but this will be the most stacked Flames camp in, well, since I can remember. Good luck, Byron."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,catsfive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:56:34 2015 UTC,He would lead the league in scoring if he any finishing ability.
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,Mikcaxi,2,Mon Jul 6 06:25:10 2015 UTC,"They can't get low-balled with qualifying offers -- they're set at a percentage (110/105/100, depending on the value of the contract) of the last year of salary for the previous contract. As in, they have to be that."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,Roughly6Owls,5,Mon Jul 6 00:44:23 2015 UTC,Hrm. I wonder if the arbitration includes a metric for every breakaway shot missed by Byron.
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,Daft_Funk87,11,Mon Jul 6 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"After careful consideration, the arbitrator rules that Byron owes the Flames $500 for past services."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,rpawson5771,0,Mon Jul 6 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"My guess is that they will get...  Bouma - 3 years @ 2.90 million  Byron - 2 years @ 1.70 million  Jooris - 2 years @ 1.25 million    Salary arbitration will benefit Bouma because I'm assuming we're offering him south of $2.5m and I wouldn't doubt that he's asking for around $3.0m but I think the Flames will get the better end of the stick with Byron and Jooris. Both Byron and Jooris missed significant time due to multiple injuries this season, scoring 24 and 19 points respectfully. Jooris is coming off on one decent season, where he was a healthy scratch for about 9 or 10 games total. I think if either of the two of them get a contract for more than 1.75 million they're being overpaid."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,WeedWackHerHedge,5,Sun Jul 5 21:40:26 2015 UTC,"There is no way Bouma gets 2.9 million, that is absolutely outrageous."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,fknSamsquamptch,2,Sun Jul 5 22:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little pricey, but outrageous? Not at all."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,WeedWackHerHedge,8,Sun Jul 5 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"This is a guy who has had one pretty good season, playing a lot of it on the second line with Monahan and Backlund as his centremen.  He isn't likely going to have those minutes or opportunities again.  15.4 shooting percentage is likely going to drop to probably 10ish.  Possession black hole.  He's going to have to improve a whole lot just to have similar production next year."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,fknSamsquamptch,2,Sun Jul 5 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"It's not completely outrageous when you look at egghead,  raymond and smids contract. I like Jooris and Bron but they are completely replaceable. Bouma is important to us, he's not gonna put up 50+ points but he  is the type of player we cannot replace easily. If be happier with a lower 2's for 2 year but upwards of 3 is not the end of the world"
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,iChron,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:34:54 2015 UTC,I'm thinking 1.9 - 2.3 would be fair.  Higher than 2.5 and I won't be happy.
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,fknSamsquamptch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:59:19 2015 UTC,"Engelland, Raymond, and Smid were all UFAs when they signed their deals. Bouma is an RFA. One shitty contract does not justify another.  Bouma is easily replaceable; his name is Micheal Ferland and he's already better. Turner Elson is a potential replacement. There are tons of Boumas out there, and overpaying them is how teams get stuck in cap hell."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,smokedfish,2,Mon Jul 6 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. In Ferland's regular season appearances he was okay, not anything decent. I don't know what Ferland's long term consistency is. I am not sold on Ferland besides being a Bollig replacement yet. With Bouma, Ferland, and Jooris there will be a regression towards their historical averages. Byron, not entirely sure because I think he does well, great skating but lacks shooting. Still haven't seen what he can do fully. More than 2 mil for Bouma is overpaying, more than 1.5 mil for Jooris is over paying. Might as well rank Byron similar to Jooris."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,NewmanTheScofflaw,-1,Mon Jul 6 07:31:18 2015 UTC,"Holy what have you done for me lately. Michael Ferland is not already better.   Let's see him finish 7th in the league in hits and 6th among forwards in blocked shots before we anoint him as good as Bouma. Keep in mind Ferland played 26 regular season games for us and was fairly pedestrian.  Bouma is the best grinder, bottom 6 type player we've had since Prust or Yelle and you can't just pick a random plug from the AHL team as the heir apparent. Just because a coach or a GM calls Elson a ""Bouma type player"" doesn't mean he will be that good."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,CuggyofHouseAbby,2,Mon Jul 6 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"excessive hitting means you never have the puck excessive blocked shots mean you never have the puck not having the puck is bad   Okay, I'll rephrase: Ferland is already at the very least as good as Bouma, with more potential. That still makes Bouma replaceable.  ""Best grinder"" isn't an award to be proud of because the league is filled with grinders, and a single grinder is not essential to team success. If he is, then your team has a major problem, and isn't close to contending. Bouma is a good option for the fourth line and nothing more, and if he gets paid more than that, he needs to walk."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,smokedfish,2,Mon Jul 6 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"I'm admittedly just reading up on arbitration mechanics, but I think arbitration awards can only be for one year or two years, not longer than that. Do you mean you think Bouma will sign for three years @$2.9M before his arbitration award?"
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,rpawson5771,3,Sun Jul 5 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't know about length. I still think it will be 2.9 but for 2 years."
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,WeedWackHerHedge,2,Sun Jul 5 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"This is correct: arbitration awarded contracts are one year, with an additional year extension possible if the team/player so desires."

The arbitrator award can be for 1 or 2 years, as requested by the Flames in each individual case"
CalgaryFlames,3c8c33,rpawson5771,2,Mon Jul 6 13:10:47 2015 UTC,"I would add to this, these hearing are ugly and can cause hurt feelings. There was an infamous incident of Tommy Salo crying after his arbitration hearing. The team does not hold back on why they think a player is only worth X amount of dollars."

Maybe Harper will chuck in some federal funds, but Calgary's enough of a Conservative stronghold financially that I doubt he'd do it for re-election reasons."
CalgaryFlames,3c8sy1,lancemeszaros,18,Mon Jul 6 00:09:08 2015 UTC,you seriously want the city to fund the arena? the evidence points almost universally towards tax-subsidized arenas being a terrible investment.
CalgaryFlames,3c8sy1,canadam,5,Mon Jul 6 03:13:38 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I agree they're a terrible investment unless the city retains ownership of the arena or the funding is made via loans instead of handouts.

CalgaryFlames,3c8sy1,Waldo76,3,Mon Jul 6 03:19:11 2015 UTC,The federal government has sternly given a stance that they won't fund arenas and stadiums.

CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,StupidNedFlanders,5,Sun Jul 5 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"Probably won't be used again, Kipper will probably get that ""Forever A Flame"" tribute with 34. Plus it seems to be a standard in the NHL where a goalie either has number 1 or a number in the 30's."
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,TheWalkingHyperbole,4,Sun Jul 5 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"If Iggy gets that stupid ""Forever a Flame"" shit... it deserves to be retired, damn it!"
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,Preconscious,7,Sun Jul 5 18:37:50 2015 UTC,Iggy's 12 will 100% be retired.
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,fknSamsquamptch,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"Apparently they are no longer retiring numbers, only doing the ""Forever a Flame"" thing."
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,Preconscious,3,Sun Jul 5 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought they were doing both for some reason, must have misread. Hopefully they'll realize Iggy is worth changing that for."
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,Butterblanket,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:48:14 2015 UTC,But there's no way any player would take 12 so may as well just retire it.
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,Ninjygingy,2,Sun Jul 5 23:40:37 2015 UTC,I think he'll probably stick with 63. He wore 93 in juniors so maybe that?
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,tilldeathdoiparty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:38:47 2015 UTC,Burke only allows players to wear #2-30
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,Ninjygingy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:48:16 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I forgot about that rule. Byron has had 32 for a few years will be change as well then?
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,tilldeathdoiparty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"Most likely he would, it could be #2-35, too but I know that's the max"
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,Litreacola,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:23:36 2015 UTC,Jooris is 86 tho.

CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,DaCodster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:58:21 2015 UTC,Just give him 93 he's the second coming of Gilmore.
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,jeffwhit,2,Mon Jul 6 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"Then he should wear 39, like the Doug Gilmour* who actually won something."
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,DaCodster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:57:27 2015 UTC,Good point
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,RawRnR,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:09:06 2015 UTC,Jooris was #87 last year so I don't see this rule being in effect.
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,tilldeathdoiparty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:06:12 2015 UTC,86 but I'm pretty sure they'll change it this year as he'll be a roster player. Last year I don't think they expected him to stick
CalgaryFlames,3c7r57,barn_yard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:00:20 2015 UTC,Ask yourself how you would feel with an Iginla #24 jersey. Would you feel good about committing your support before he was a proven player? Or would you prefer to own one with the #12 on it because that's the number he made famous in his career here?
CalgaryFlames,3c5uyq,Waldo76,12,Sun Jul 5 02:47:09 2015 UTC,No fucking Rafikov AGAIN!  Has he committed crimes or something?  How fucking hard can it be for a professional athlete to get a visa?
CalgaryFlames,3c5uyq,fknSamsquamptch,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:41:16 2015 UTC,"He's Russian.   Good luck getting any Eastern European from a country with any Russian ties into the country, let alone someone right out of Russia. The Canadian government is waving its dick around, pretending that this is actually hurting the Russians, when in fact it is just hurting ordinary people.   That's a longer story. And much more ranty. But the tl;dr is that the Canadian Government hates Russians."

CalgaryFlames,3c5uyq,notlogan,4,Sun Jul 5 04:59:58 2015 UTC,I remeber Baillie was so good in NHL. What happened?
CalgaryFlames,3c5uyq,rpawson5771,4,Sun Jul 5 05:23:38 2015 UTC,"He has gone undrafted for 2 years now, looks like injuries led to an underwhelming draft year and then this year he got passed over again despite scoring 76 points in 68 games for Kelowna.  He was coached by Huska (head coach of Adirondack this year) for 3 seasons in Kelowna so maybe he has some first hand knowledge of how good this kid is and believes he can still make it."
CalgaryFlames,3c5uyq,captaindigbob,3,Sun Jul 5 05:33:04 2015 UTC,He's not excited about 15 of the 42 invitees

Maybe even Brandon Bollig, he's super active on Twitter."

I'd love an AMA, but I doubt a currently active player would say much, both because they have too much respect for their team and peers to say anything bad about them, and because player contracts usually have a bunch of vague stuff about ""must represent the team in a positive manner"" and whatnot."
CalgaryFlames,3c55uv,pyro5050,3,Sat Jul 4 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"well... we could just be adults and not ask loaded questions to get dirt, but instead to get a better understanding of the team from a positive light."

Monahan's more of a sure thing, but he's not as dynamic. I think Bennett will be ever so slightly better than Monahan, but realistically I think they'll both be equally important. I think we'll see Monahan getting tougher shifts and more PK time, while Bennett gets to rack up points in easier situations, but neither will clearly be the #1 over the other guy.  Really great problem to have though"
CalgaryFlames,3c5dan,Kovaz,3,Sun Jul 5 02:16:51 2015 UTC,Really hard to say at this point. I'm fine with either taking the role.
CalgaryFlames,3c5dan,rpawson5771,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"I think both have the potential to be a #1 center in the league. I think Bennett will center a more offensive top line, while Monny will have a more defensively responsible role as a 1b or #2 line center. But that depends on line mates quite a lot.

Edit: and then...I scroll further and see you say the exact same thing later on..."
CalgaryFlames,3by56b,chodes_r_us,4,Sat Jul 4 11:36:03 2015 UTC,Uh what? Try maybe four first overall picks wasted? You're starting to sound like an oiler apologist Ali my man.....
CalgaryFlames,3by56b,catsfive,4,Fri Jul 3 04:00:31 2015 UTC,"wasted   I really hate this thought -- the Oilers first round picks are literally the only draft picks that have worked out for them. The reason they've been a terrible team is not because Taylor Hall or Ryan Nugent-Hopkins was ruined. The Oilers don't ruin their first rounders. They just have terrible scouting for everything else, so they have basically no prospect pipeline, and they haven't surrounded their first rounders with a roster that can support them (partially because they can't draft worth a damn outside the first round)."
CalgaryFlames,3by56b,Buksey,2,Fri Jul 3 04:21:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's scouting as much as signing. Who wants to come play for such a toxic ownership group?? Look at this year's draft, basically. The Oilers were runners up in deal after deal. No one wants to sign for these cocksuckers and their fans are, thankfully, starting to get sick of it. Seems like the scouts are doing great, really, but the puck never gets pocketed because no one there has the class or whatever else it takes (that the Flames seem to have in spades) to get talks moving and contracts signed. There's been a lot of ""in Sutter we trust"" and ""Treleiving, BOOM"" stuff here, but, I think the most unheralded boom-stick on the Flames might be King."
CalgaryFlames,3by56b,catsfive,5,Fri Jul 3 04:56:34 2015 UTC,"No, it's definitely a drafting problem as well -- your own RFAs are almost always cheaper than UFAs, and at the worst younger players have more trade value than older ones. So, when the most talented player in your system outside the first round since 2000 is Jeff Petry, who's no longer an Oiler and cracked the line-up at 26...  Here's a list of every Edmonton Oilers draft pick. After 2000, they've drafted like eight players outside the first round who cracked any NHL line-up and stayed up for more than two full seasons. Almost all of those guys (Brodziak, Greene, Stoll, Winchester) played more of their career somewhere else -- the only exception is Zach Stortini, who's basically the definition of 4th line enforcer and played 257 games.  Worse is that, ignoring their drafting in the last couple seasons (where it's too early to tell), they don't even have that many guys who're potentially going to join that 'elite' group. Jeff Petry's one of the only ones (Anton Lander, Chris VandeVelde, Martin Marincin, and Tyler Pitlick are other ones, but they've got a long way to go)."
CalgaryFlames,3by56b,chodes_r_us,2,Fri Jul 3 11:27:17 2015 UTC,"Really, they haven't been amazing scouting in the first round either. When you are picking in the Top 3, it is fairly hard to miss on a pick. By the time you get to the draft, every sports pundit and scout knows who the best 3 options are and 1 usually stands out above the rest."
CalgaryFlames,3by56b,alivirji,2,Fri Jul 3 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"Ignoring their first overalls, they've selected...  Sam Gagner: a 6th overall pick for all the right reasons (stat-line), but playing with Kane was the reason he didn't work out. A pretty reasonable mistake (Marner or Strome has the potential to work out like this, TBH -- Marner got to play with two over-age players, one of whom was Domi, and Strome had the McDavid effect -- when McDavid was injured Strome was scoring at .6 less PPG).  Alex Plante/Riley Nash: yeah. Bad picks. Pacioretty and Backlund were more impactful and picked later.  Eberle: I don't think there's anyone in the 2008 draft selected after 22 who'd be worth trading Eberle 1 for 1, except maybe Carlsson (WSH, D). We picked Nemisz this year...  Paajarvi: eh. Ellis (NSH, D), De Haan (NYI, D), Kulikov (FLA, D), are all better players right now, but I think there's an argument that Paajarvi was actually ruined by poor development -- he might still get out of the AHL, but I think throwing him into the Oilers line-up too early screwed him up a bit.  Klefblom's looking like the best prospect out of the bottom ten picks in his year.  I think it's hard to argue with Nurse at 7th either -- sure, Ristolainen and Horvat have spent more time in the NHL, but I don't think I'd trade Ristolainen for Nurse straight up as the Oilers, and Horvat's not a defenseman.  Draisatl at 3rd is a tough argument, especially since they're both so young -- Bennett vs. Drai will be a battle of Alberta argument for as long as they're each on the teams, I think. Obviously Bennett looked great in the NHL for the playoffs, but Draisatl fucking killed the WHL last season -- he was obviously above that level of competition."

There's also the O'Reilly offer sheet thing where we would have had to give up big draft picks, but Feaster and Weisbrod did their due diligence on that and were justified in thinking that wasn't the case... something about him playing in Europe or something voiding that stipulation and the league actually agreeing with this before the offer sheet was made - and then after the fact saying the draft picks would have to be given...

CalgaryFlames,3bw6pd,nexxai,3,Thu Jul 2 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"With the Hamilton and Frolik signings, Treliving seems to have bought into the idea that possession matters. If so, then Byron makes sense as one of the extras put into the lineup, and resigning Schlemko would be a priority.   Last season's acquisitions - Bollig, Engelland, and Raymond - would all be out.  Jones is almost surely to be traded. After Hudler's comments about wanting to be the Flames' Zetterberg and sticking around, it seems he wants to stay and that would definitely have some benefits."
CalgaryFlames,3bw6pd,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:13:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the end of the year, Treliving mentioned that puck possession was an area of focus for the team. So far I think he's done an A+ job of addressing that area.    As much as I would like to see Bollig, Engelland and Raymond gone, I honestly can't think of anyone who would be willing to take any of them.    Unless we can get a return for Jones that includes a right shooting RW, I would say we should hang on to him for now. He fits in real nicely on the third line with Bouma and Stajan (or Backlund). Maybe by the time Jones' contract is up, Smith (or Poirier) will be able to fill in.    Hudler does want to stay, and is coming off a career year. I doubt his trade value will ever be higher than it is right now. Any trade involving him would have to be seriously worthwhile. If he stays, that's fantastic. If he leaves, we would probably get a damn good return too. But I can't think of a team that would be looking for a Hudler-type player (and who would have the pieces necessary to make a trade that benefits the Flames too)."

If it can't be done by trade, then people will have to go on waivers.   I like what Jones did last year, but with an expiring contract, they can either trade him for a pick or lose him for nothing next summer.  With Hudler, playoff teams are always happy to add offence.

CalgaryFlames,3bw6pd,TJYoshi,2,Fri Jul 3 02:17:02 2015 UTC,u/DarrenCP Do you see Bennett starting the season on the wing again? Or will they look to have him play his natural center position in a more sheltered role?
CalgaryFlames,3bw6pd,Circlesmirk,7,Thu Jul 2 19:34:14 2015 UTC,"It's an excellent question and may depend on what the personnel looks like come training camp (e.g. who is still here). I have no doubt that Bennett ends up at centre eventually but making that move now -- with Monahan, Backlund and Stajan already in that spot -- would freeze out Markus Granlund, who has yet to be tried on the wing.   I still think Granlund will become a very nice NHL player so in addition to the look of the roster in September, how he shows at training camp may dictate if he gets a chance for one of the bottom two centre jobs in which case, they leave Bennett on the wing. It's going to be one of the training camp storylines to follow, for sure.  (And when he does get there -- if it's this year, I would expect him to be broken in similarly to how they broke in Monahan -- sheltering him, a luxury Hartley has with Bennett and Monahan also in the stable.)"
CalgaryFlames,3bw6pd,DarrenCP,2,Fri Jul 3 02:23:17 2015 UTC,"I can't believe that we get to talk about ""log jam"", and ""sheltered minutes"" and ""options"" when it comes to centre.  What world are we living in right now as flames fan?"
CalgaryFlames,3bw6pd,Rfilsinger,3,Fri Jul 3 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"I may not be Darren (in case you had trouble with that). But I see Bennett bouncing back and forth between wing and centre, mainly due to the log jam and it might be a good way to ease him in and build his confidence by getting a lot of points.  That's just my guess."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,Circlesmirk,7,Thu Jul 2 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'm guessing:  1) Gaudreau - Monahan - Hudler  2) Bennett - Backlund - Frolik (the erection line)  3) Bouma - Colborne - Jones  4) Ferland - Stajan - Jooris  extras: Byron, Bollig, Raymond  1) Gio - Brodie  2) Russell - Hamilton  3) Engelland - Wideman"
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,blink0r,4,Thu Jul 2 18:27:18 2015 UTC,My only concern with this is that Backlund's line is probably your best shutdown line... which doesn't really make it a great fit for Bennett. And Engelland/Wideman would get feasted on by even 3rd and 4th lines...
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,takingabbath,2,Thu Jul 2 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"The great thing about Frolik is that he's so versatile. Yes, he could be used as part of a shutdown line but he's able to put up some decent points with the right linemates. All Stanley cup contending teams have at least two scoring lines (TBL has the Stamkos line and the triplets, CHI has the Toews line and the Kane line). The BBF line can be used as a scoring line to add some depth behind Hudreaunahan, but if a shutdown line is really needed, Bouma can replace Bennett on the LW.    The Bennett-Backlund-Frolik line makes me excited because I can see Bennett putting up a ton of points playing with those two.    I'm not a fan of an Engelland-Wideman pairing either, but if used properly they could be serviceable. Our top two pairings are capable of eating serious minutes in a pinch, meaning you can deploy Engelland-Wideman in the offensive zone and maybe on the PP (although I can only see Wideman taking a spot on the second PP pairing with Brodie. Engelland has no business being on the PP). Remember, Chicago won the Stanley Cup while basically only playing 4 defencemen."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,TJYoshi,0,Thu Jul 2 19:39:32 2015 UTC,Bennett would be ideal next to Johnny and Jiri
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,illPoff,4,Thu Jul 2 21:34:48 2015 UTC,Too small of a line I think
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,Roughly6Owls,5,Fri Jul 3 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"With charts, because I like charts and there is still no one using them (sub, plz) -- I'm gonna to suggest an alternative line-up that's a little ballsy, but might work out, partly so that I don't parrot everyone else posting.     Left Wing Centre Right Wing    Gaudreau Bennett Hudler   [X] Monahan Frolik   Bouma Backlund Jooris   Ferland Stajan Jones    [X]: Colborne or Raymond, or whoever we like better coming out of training camp of the other guys hanging around -- Byron/Granlund/etc.  Depth options: Shore, Granlund, Bollig, whoever's in the AHL and has improved since last season.  This line-up gives us two lines that worked very well together (BBJ/FSJ) in the playoffs, and in theory act as excellent defensive lines, with Monahan and Frolik with the extra player as an excellent two-way game that can fill in on the offensive zone and on the defensive side. This allows us to use Gaudreau/Bennett/Hudler as the utmost offensive players in the league, giving them sheltered minutes and letting them go crazy offensively.  Of course, this depends on Bennett being ready for those offensive minutes and clicking with Johnny/Jiri: otherwise, we're better off just leaving Monahan with the other two.    Left Defense Right Defense Goalies    Giordano Brodie Hiller   Russell Hamilton Ramo   Schlemko Wideman Ortio   Wotherspoon Engelland/Nakladal     Not pictured: Smid, who is on LTIR.  Our top pair is dynamite -- just let 'em play.  Our second pair is interesting -- either Russell plays like he did with Wideman, and Hamilton's just less liable to make mistakes (and hopefully pulls Russell's possession out of the gutter), or Hamilton gives Russell the ability to show us what he's got and be a little bit more flexible -- Russell's got the foot speed to be less of a stay-at-homer than he was when Wideman was his main partner.  Third pair gets sheltered minutes (I'd argue that Wideman needs them, but they'll likely benefit Schlemko as well), but Schlemko will get some extra minutes to show us his high possession numbers weren't flukey... with Wotherspoon waiting to show us what's up if he falters.  Smid/Wideman will be a terrible pairing -- Wideman's not good enough defensively to be tied to an Engelland/Smid anchor. If Smid is playing by training camp at the end of the off-season, I'd actually prefer to play Brodie with Wideman and Russell with Engelland/Nakladal.  Not actually commenting on goalies. They're just there for completeness. Raise your eyebrows at them."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,Roughly6Owls,3,Thu Jul 2 19:04:17 2015 UTC,Teach me your charting ways... :)  I would love to see Engelland out of the lineup. It absolutely allows more creativity and freedom with the other pairings.  I'm also very intrigued by the Bennett on the top line idea... but I'm reluctant to just give it to him out of the gate.
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"You've got to think of the lines as something else -- maybe it's ""Scoring"" (G/B/H), ""Two-Way"" (X/M/F), ""Defensive"" (B/B/J), and ""Checking"" (F/S/J), because they're not traditional 1-4s: I'd argue that this set-up would give us two #1.5 lines (Bennett and Monahan -- depending on how good Bennett is out of camp, this could easily be #1 and #1.5), and two #3 lines (Backlund and Stajan). FSJ in particular deserve more than 4th liner ice-time."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,fknSamsquamptch,2,Thu Jul 2 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. If I were Bob, I'd have my #1 scoring line (Monahan, Gaudreau, Huds), a shutdown line (Backlund, Bouma, Frolik?), an opportunistic development line (Bennett, Colborne, Ferland?), and an energy line (Stajan, Jooris, Jones?)."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"Stajan/Jooris/Jones puts two of our... two righties on the same line -- try Jooris/Bennett/Colborne (which I actually like a lot, if Colby can put it together) and Ferland/Stajan/Jones (admittedly, I also loved that line in the playoffs).  I'll admit that Backlund and Frolik seem like they were made to play together: BBF (which is a like that lots of other people identified) would be hot. Basically the only reason I don't have that is because I wanted to put Bennett with Gaudreau/Hudler to provide a different list than everyone else, which means Monahan needed linemates."

CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,JESUS_WALKS,2,Thu Jul 2 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"Bennett's a center. He'll have a full development camp and pre-season to learn systems and responsibilities. It would be silly to play him on the wing. Develop him in the role you want him to play.  And Bouma's massively more productive than Colborne... I don't know how you can make the case that Colby deserves a higher depth chart ranking than he does. Frolik, I can see... but he's a RW so you'd be arguing to swap him and Jones rather than Bouma."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,TJYoshi,5,Thu Jul 2 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"Bouma is not a top 6 player. Bennett is. We have enough centre depth to allow Bennett to play wing for a season or half before he shifts to the centre position. His game isn't as refined as Monahan's was at the same age (when Monny made the team). Wing is a great place for young centres to ease into the league (eg Teuvo), and Backlund is a perfect mentor for Bennett imo. And Colborne is better offensively than Bouma. Don't let a ridiculously high shooting percentage playing with Backlund and a career season that stretches back to his Junior days make you think he's anything more than an (amazing) bottom six player. Colborne has way better raw skill, and thrives much more in a top 6 role (see: playoffs and 2014 on Monny and Hudler's line)."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"Colby may have more skill, but he doesn't seem to cash in on it very often. Bennett is absolutely a top 6 player, but in my mind lines 2/3 aren't anything more than shutdown/sheltered. It's not an indication of skill, so much as it is of role. Bennett needs a season to ease into the league... but he can do that playing sheltered competition on a 3rd line with 2 strong wingers, rather than playing next to Backlund against the toughest competition in the league."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,winkylems,2,Thu Jul 2 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"There are two forms of sheltering - easy competition and ok linemates, or really good linemates despite hard competition. Gaudreau went the latter route, and I think it's best for Bennett to do that as well. He has the skill to match with higher competition, and Backlund/Frolik allow him to make rookie mistakes without consequence. It'll also develop Ho's defensive game more.   However, I think both our ideas have merit. We'll just have to see which one sticks."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,konradical_,3,Thu Jul 2 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"If there was a way to do it your way while still allowing Bennett to play his natural position, I'd be 100% on board. I personally prefer to see him develop as a center from the start... but I do see the merit of your position."

Schlemko actually has decent possession numbers, and Wideman is too good of an offensive weapon to waste by having him paired with Engelland with one of them on the wrong side.

CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,kapxis,2,Thu Jul 2 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"I still like Hamilton being separated from Gio.    Not only would it turn into a 1a/1b situation and ensure coverage for teams that have multiple scary scoring lines, but I think it would fit for playstyle too.  Sure, Gio times his offensive zone entrances nicely and our forwards give him great consistant coverage - but Gio also knows that Brodie will hang back and bail him out if something goes wrong.  Hamilton, however great he is, seems more like a Gio player to me - where he may need someone who could hang back and bail him out in order to give him the freedom he needs to spring in and get a point.  That's why I'd rather see him stick with Wideman, or Brodie himself (and put wideman up on the first defensive line? ...yuck).  It would act a bit like an anchor for Gio but I feel he'd be able to pull someone up to his level moreso than Hamilton could at this point.  Anyway, Gio/Hamilton makes sense handedness wise, but it could be too much of a good thing on the same line."
CalgaryFlames,3bw2ug,tehReno,3,Thu Jul 2 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe you do Brodie and Hamilton then? They'll be playing together for the next decade at least... sounds like they could be tailor made for each other. Personally, I think Gio's the strongest defender on the team, with Brodie being second... one of them will have to play with Wideman unless BT has a few more tricks up his sleeve... I'd rather optimize Gio's offense by pairing him with Hamilton, and let Brodie cover for Wideman."

Slower though, if you're positioned correctly.   I'm not sure really where Wideman fits then.  He still seems to me like he'd have some trade value - although he goes up to a cap hit of 6 mil, which is pricey for depth D on any playoff bound team.  At least he did fairly well last year (his best as a Flame for sure!).  It's a fundamental shift in how he plays/see's the game but, maybe in his mid 30's he can learn to be more of a stay-at-home guy, which will help keep him near the right place at the right time.  God it feels weird to be a ~30 year old and talking about how these guys should learn to play a slower style since they can't keep up anymore.... Life in pro sports would be weird."
CalgaryFlames,3bxff4,Svenka,2,Thu Jul 2 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"I'll be surprised if Cundari makes it to the NHL, and sticks consistently. Seems like a career AHL'r to me."
CalgaryFlames,3bxff4,locoenchilada,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"Nah. He'll most likely play in the KHL later in his career. His playstyle doesn't fit 6 and 7 pairings, and he's not good enough for top 4 pairings."

CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,locoenchilada,8,Thu Jul 2 15:08:51 2015 UTC,Found the poker shark.
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Dramon,4,Thu Jul 2 15:40:50 2015 UTC,"he's still only 24 and has put up very promising numbers.  There is zero risk in picking him up and i have a very hard time seeing 29 other teams turning him down.  He's a cheap cap hit and if it doesn't work out, he can just be sent through waivers again.  I trust treliving and i believe he is going to deal one of the goalies (probs hiller), prior to the start of the season."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,sergeant_meowenstein,2,Thu Jul 2 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"As I've pointed out, there is some risk - you'd have to waive or trade your own backup to make room for him on the roster and if Ortio struggles then you have to make another move to acquire a new backup."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,sergeant_meowenstein,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"not necessarily, there is a 23 roster limit for a reason.  You can keep a goalie as a healthy scratch until you get your goal tender situation figured out (one could temporarily send a player on a two way contract down)."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,sergeant_meowenstein,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:04:42 2015 UTC,Well the 3-goalie idea is far from ideal and they're likely going to have to move someone somewhere in order to give Ortio a roster spot and stay under the 23-man limit.
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,SgtFinnish,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"As a permanent solution i agree, but if it's a temporary experiment it would be the most ideal solution."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Suneal,3,Thu Jul 2 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way: if nobody picks him up if we  waive him, I will eat a hat."

CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,catsfive,2,Thu Jul 2 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"He could start the season in the AHL, then be called up worry-free when either Ramo or Hiller are traded during the season.   He only needs to clear waivers if he gets sent back down"
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,TrckRdr,5,Thu Jul 2 15:31:51 2015 UTC,He'd need to clear waivers before getting to the AHL.  Everyone is considered on the NHL roster until they're moved elsewhere.
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,MasteroftheHallows,2,Thu Jul 2 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, makes sense. Then I think our best bet is start the season with all three goalies and try to move one of Ramo of Hiller as early as possible. Because I really don't want to lose Ortio"
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Waldo76,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"It's possible but far from ideal -- goalies need to play in order to stay on top of their game, rolling three guys doesn't make a ton of sense for any extended period of time.  Not to mention it takes a roster spot away from someone else."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,marbsarebad,2,Thu Jul 2 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"More to the point, to me, the question is really ""Is there a legit destination for Hiller over the summer?"""
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,marbsarebad,2,Thu Jul 2 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"I heard one dubious rumour that Crawford may get traded to Winnipeg, in which case Chicago could be a good trade partner. But nothing other than that, and I don't honestly see it happening."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,bluntoclock,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:06:12 2015 UTC,No offense to you but that rumor is laughably ridiculous
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,bluntoclock,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:21:44 2015 UTC,I'm so confused. The research I've done shows that waivers don't take effect until 12 days prior to the regular season. Do you have a source that shows different?
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,bluntoclock,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:15:35 2015 UTC,"The 12 days prior to the season starting is training camp and I'm pretty sure there's a rule you have to invite all players under contract to camp (except maybe players on ELC's, I can't remember).  But anyways ya, there's really no way around it - Ortio will have to clear waivers before going to AHL."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,RawRnR,2,Fri Jul 3 11:12:53 2015 UTC,A bottom team would 110% pick him up.  Our only chance at this point is emergency re-calls.
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,tehReno,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:12 2015 UTC,Like who though?  Most of these teams have already addressed their goaltending.  And we would still have to send him down at the beginning of the season for him to be available via emergency recall.
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Shanghai1943,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"Anders Lindback is definitely not ""addressing"" goaltending.  Buffalo would take him.  Any team in the league could take him and put him on their farm team.  I've seen it happen before.  As long as he didn't join the NHL team he is still eligible to go back the AHL without going through waivers again.  Hell, even Boston would take him at this point."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,teckhz,2,Thu Jul 2 15:30:21 2015 UTC,"I think you're forgetting they also picked up Lehner?  And no, anyone who wants to send him to the AHL at this point would have to put him through waivers first."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Shanghai1943,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:34:46 2015 UTC,"Lehner is far from a garaunteed number one, and Lindback has been notoriously underwhelming.  I'm sure Buffalo would have no problems running Lehner-Ortio as a 1A/1B situation to increase their odds of finding a true starter in the near future.  And ARZ would jump at the chance to replace Linback, who is an average back up with no ceiling, with Ortio, who can play in the here and now, and has great potential."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,teckhz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:46:54 2015 UTC,"IMO the Sabres rebuild is done, they're going to want to compete for a playoff spot this season.  I could see them having some interest in a veteran backup to play behind Lehner but I highly doubt they give the net up to a pair of 24-year-olds.  Lindback is still playing behind Smith and signed a one-year ""prove yourself"" deal in Arizona.  I think they'll see what he can do before going out and acquiring someone else."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"If lindback was the flames goalie and ortio showed up as available, you don't think the flames would pick up ortio over lindback?  Lindback was the best backup available for arizonas price and purpose. They're rebuilding and they would love a more or less nhl ready young goalie with promise.  Buffalo IS still rebuilding, but regardless your point doesn't stand. Buffalos current back up of Chad Johnson is hardly the ""veteran"" presence that would lead them to a playoffs push. Why not have two promising goalies compete in the crease? What's the downside and how is it any worse than having Chad Johnson as your back up."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Shanghai1943,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"If lindback was the flames goalie and ortio showed up as available, you don't think the flames would pick up ortio over lindback?   Arizona is maybe ONE team that could have some interest but still, what do they do with Lindback?  They're not a team that can afford to waive him and send him to the minors and there isn't a ton of demand for backup goalies at the beginning of the season.     Buffalo IS still rebuilding, but regardless your point doesn't stand. Buffalos current back up of Chad Johnson is hardly the ""veteran"" presence that would lead them to a playoffs push. Why not have two promising goalies compete in the crease? What's the downside and how is it any worse than having Chad Johnson as your back up.   It's not like Ortio and Johnson are their only two options, I'm saying I could see them trading for a more veteran presence to play behind Lehner, not another question mark who may or may not be available via waivers at some point.  And besides, if they were so concerned about Johnson, why didn't they make an offer to Ramo then?  Or Enroth?  Or Lindback?  Or Neuvirth?  These guys are arguably ALL upgrades on Johnson too or at least have the potential to be."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,catsfive,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"why didn't they make an offer to Ramo then?   If they wanted a veteran back up for a playoff run, why didn't they indeed? Perhaps they're still rebuilding after all...  Buffalo didnt take Enroth, Lindback or Neuvirth because those are stop gap options and Buffalo can afford to be patient. They DID take Lehner, who is more like Ortio than any of those other options. Besides, a FREE Ortio is greater than picking up one of your old back ups (Enroth, Lindback, Neuvirth)."
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,pilgrimhobo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"If they wanted a veteran back up for a playoff run, why didn't they indeed? Perhaps they're still rebuilding after all...   Well I don't expect them to compete for the Cup or anything this year but with the additions of Eichel, Lehner, Kane and O'Reilly their days of top-5 draft picks should be over.     Buffalo didnt take Enroth, Lindback or Neuvirth because those are stop gap options and Buffalo can afford to be patient.    So we agree that they need to upgrade at backup, I just don't think the best way to do it is to bank on what may or may not be available on the waiver wire 2 days before the season starts.     Besides, a FREE Ortio is greater than picking up one of your old back ups (Enroth, Lindback, Neuvirth).   Sure he is but what happens when Ortio doesn't get waived, you end up with none of them and you're forced to start Chad Johnson 30-40 games next season?"
CalgaryFlames,3bvn85,Circlesmirk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:04:00 2015 UTC,The only thing I've found questionable this past week has been the signing of Ramo. Ortio/Hiller battle would be awesome.

CalgaryFlames,3btmoa,Rooster697,6,Thu Jul 2 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"This article brings up a good point. We won't be the plucky overachieving underdogs that we were last year, especially after the big offseason that we've had. With that being said, I think that second in the Pacific is a definite possibility.    LA will probably have a better season than they did last year, but they'll still be missing Williams, Richards, Regehr, etc. Not to mention that they have a reputation for sneaking into the playoffs only to become unstoppable once they get there.  I can't help but think that Vancouver is trending downwards right now. Same goes for SJ.    Arizona and Edmonton are trending upwards, but unless one of them does what we did last year and vastly exceed expectations, I can't see them being contenders. Edmonton may sneak into a wild card spot.    Anaheim will probably win the division again. Although I think the Flames could finally break the curse of the Honda Centre.    Is it early to be making predictions? Absolutely, there's still 3 1/2 months before the season starts. But I need to pass the time somehow."
CalgaryFlames,3btmoa,takingabbath,5,Thu Jul 2 03:21:05 2015 UTC,I think next season will be a massive disappointment if we don't break the Ponda Curse :P

CalgaryFlames,3btmoa,takingabbath,3,Thu Jul 2 03:31:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  not making playoffs would suck. All the stats guys would be happy though I think"

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Calgarydan98,14,Wed Jul 1 17:08:15 2015 UTC,Nope. You're bang on. Frolik and Backlund together could be absolutely dominant.

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,fknSamsquamptch,6,Wed Jul 1 19:33:48 2015 UTC,That BJB line is a hot 4th line.

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,RawRnR,3,Wed Jul 1 17:13:05 2015 UTC,I still have no idea what we're doing about goalies.
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,fknSamsquamptch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:26:48 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we'll maybe waive Hiller and bury him in the AHL if we can't move him. Or maybe we move Ramo and this was just a sign and trade kind of thing? That would be cool.
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,tempz77,3,Wed Jul 1 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"You know that Hiller's statistically the better goalie, right?  No way he's the one who's waived."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't word that properly, I don't want us to waive Hiller. I'm just trying to think outside the box on how signing Ramo AND protecting Ortio will work."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,tempz77,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"So who would be waived then? The guy they just went out and re-signed? I don't buy that. Either Hiller is moved or waived, there's no other route that makes sense."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,RDC123,0,Wed Jul 1 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"I think if Hiller's not moved, it's possible we just run with Ortio's 600k sitting on the bench...  It's also maybe possible he spends all year in Stockton and never gets called up? I think Ortio might avoid waivers that way, but I'm not a waiver-expert."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"On the bench where? Bench as in press box? That's a phenomenal way to completely de-rail his development.   He has to clear waivers to get to Stockton, I can't see that happening."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,RDC123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're jumping on me for this -- I didn't sign Ramo, I'm not sure what Treliving has planned.  However, yes. If Ortio can't be moved to Stockton, and one of Hiller or Ramo can't be moved, I think we could start the season with Ortio sitting in the pressbox as a healthy scratch. Certainly a poor way to develop a goalie, I agree."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:51:15 2015 UTC,"How am I jumping on you?   Ortio isn't going to be sitting in the press box for a season, that's how you kill off a promising prospect. That leaves two options, move Hiller or move Ramo (or I guess move Ortio, that would be surprising but possible). I can't see the Flames signing Ramo just to put him on the trade block/waiver wire. That leaves Hiller as the odd man out. They could wait it out through camp if there aren't any good offers, maybe Hiller looks incredible and Ramo stumbles, but it's hard to see them carrying both into the season."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,RDC123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, but Ramo will be a better goalje next year. Hillers old and Ramo will be good for another 5 years."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Svenka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:09:03 2015 UTC,"There's nothing that suggests that at all -- Hiller's no spring chicken, but he's not even close to the oldest goaltender around, and there are guys (Luongo, Lundqvist, Brodeur last season) who have been around for a long time without problems."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:15:03 2015 UTC,"But Hiller isn't a Luongo, or a Lundqvist. He was an over average goaltender and wasn't a top goaltender in the league during his prime. Hiller is inconsistent, and for the future Ramo will be a better pick."

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,-1,Thu Jul 2 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"Ramo has been super consistent ever since he arrived in Calgary. This 1 year is a bridge. If he does well, he'll be raised maybe 4 more years to back up Ortio possibly."

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Mikcaxi,0,Wed Jul 1 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"Well, ""I'm hoping"" is probably not the best way to put it. I'm OK with Hiller and he deserves to be one of our goalies next year. But us signing Ramo is so unexpected and you have to assume that means he's going to be part of our goaltending tandem next season too.   I just really don't want to lose Ortio."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,tempz77,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"lose Ortio   How come? Is it an expansion draft issue? Or a CBA thing? I thought we could carry 3 goalies (as crazy as that might be), at the expense of an extra forward or d man. Like, could be eat pop corn up top until a goalie injury or something?"
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Aplicado,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:41:47 2015 UTC,We could carry three goalies but it wouldn't make sense to do so. Goalies generally dislike being part of a 1a/1b scenario. Three way splits are generally disastrous. Why would Ramo sign here to be part of a 1a/1b/1c?   And it goes further then just games when you carry three. Think about practices. Normally you'd have a goalie in both creases and they'd get a full practice. With three they end up splitting practice time too.
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,tempz77,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree   Mentioned it being crazy. Could it be crazy like a fox? I don't care who sits in the box be it engeland or Shore or Ortio (who could absorb a lot from the wise oldsters sitting beside him. We'd have nice trade bait if another team loses their starter in Hiller or Ramo, with Joni waiting to go. If we lose one, we have him waiting. If he sits there all year, playing 10 games he's been brought in slowly and knows the system.   If any gm this year could pull it off, Treliving could."

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,blink0r,3,Wed Jul 1 17:08:42 2015 UTC,I don't know much about Frolik. Is he second line winger material?
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,fknSamsquamptch,9,Wed Jul 1 17:42:14 2015 UTC,Second line production. First line defensive skills. Poor mans Hossa.
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,winkylems,0,Wed Jul 1 17:56:51 2015 UTC,Ferland/Bouma - Bennett - Frolik   Yay/Nay?
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,3,Wed Jul 1 18:11:19 2015 UTC,"Bennett - Backlund - Frolik although I do like the idea of Bennett playing with Hudler this year, since Huds is so good with rookies."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,TJYoshi,2,Wed Jul 1 18:27:53 2015 UTC,I like the on-ice chemistry that Jiri and Johnny have. I wouldn't split that up.
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"Technically we could run Gaudreau/Bennett/Hudler, and that could be our offensive line, and then we've got Bouma/Backlund/Frolik as a shutdown line."

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:57:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure if it would be a good line -- I haven't seen Bennett enough to know his playstyle, but Gaudreau/Hudler need a playmaking center.

CalgaryFlames,3brsko,donksdonksdonks,3,Wed Jul 1 20:29:09 2015 UTC,I don't know how we got this deal done. That is a reasonable contract. I thought he would command 5.5-6 million. He's a strong two way player and solid numbers. I'm fucking pumped! Let's just hope this doesn't turn out to be like last free agency)  (now to unload some contracts from the last years signing period)
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,fknSamsquamptch,2,Wed Jul 1 19:47:58 2015 UTC,BUT AT WHAT COST?!
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,donksdonksdonks,9,Wed Jul 1 17:06:04 2015 UTC,BT did it at the low low price of 1.475 Engellands
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,enag7,3,Wed Jul 1 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"Man I had almost no faith in BT after the Engelland signing and Bollig trade.  I liked the Hiller signing, that one worked out really well for us.  Been pretty lights out since then (still slightly perplexed by our goalie situation, but we'll see what happens)."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,TJYoshi,3,Wed Jul 1 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"I don't blame him for getting Bollig/Engelland... I don't think anyone (including him) knew how the team was going to do, and they need to meet the cap floor somehow.  Something must be happening with the goalies, unless he is really confident that Ortio won't get claimed on waivers or wants to roll with 3 goalies on the roster"
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,CuggyofHouseAbby,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:33:18 2015 UTC,I still kinda hold Bollig against him only because he traded a pick away for him. I feel like it was too much overpayment for a guy that Chicago needed to move for cap space.   But otherwise I agree that he's picked up his game a lot more as he's grown into his role as GM.
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Galaxy91122,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"I think they signed goalies to prepare for the next buyer. Talbot/Jones/someone won't work out and a team will come to buy Hiller or Ramo, and we'll have all the leverage in those negotiations"
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,theFlamingRaven,2,Thu Jul 2 02:58:16 2015 UTC,Don't get the hate for these two on this sub. Both were very good in the playoffs ( http://imgur.com/omTc8dx never forget ) and Engelland was better than Russell-Wideman against Anaheim. He's a very good bottom pairing defenseman.
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Galaxy91122,2,Wed Jul 1 19:19:34 2015 UTC,I don't like that term at 5 years but he's a solid player
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,MattFiresideChat,7,Wed Jul 1 17:11:21 2015 UTC,He's only 27 so I'm not too worried
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,theFlamingRaven,3,Wed Jul 1 17:22:13 2015 UTC,What do you not like about the term? 32 when it's over?  31 when he's due for a trade!
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,AKAdyje,2,Wed Jul 1 17:40:39 2015 UTC,It's more so cause of all our young guys we gotta re-sign
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,theFlamingRaven,2,Wed Jul 1 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"We have 30 million coming off the books in the next two seasons, so there isn't much to worry about.  Hudler is only going to take 3 mil more than he's making to keep (or slightly less maybe)  Gio is going to be 3-4 million more  Gaudreau and Monahan will be 4.5 each more  It's not a big deal. Moving/walking away from Ramo/Hiller/Jones next offseason will free up 12 million which accommodates the raises for all of Gaudreau/Monahan/Hudler and we would still have 7 millon in cap space."
CalgaryFlames,3brsko,Buksey,2,Wed Jul 1 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I think there is quite a bit coming off the books next year though, Hiller, Ramo, Englland plus a few more I'm sure.  I'm at the point of #InBradWeTrust"
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,Thumper17,15,Thu Jul 2 02:35:07 2015 UTC,Why doesn't no body ever have Bennett as a centre
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,gaganminhas,2,Thu Jul 2 03:03:21 2015 UTC,He'll get his time as centre. Need to let him experience more of the NHL first.
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,gaganminhas,7,Thu Jul 2 03:15:17 2015 UTC,Why? Monahan played centre his first year. Bennett is capable . That one-two centre punch is vital in winning a cup
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,takingabbath,8,Thu Jul 2 03:29:10 2015 UTC,"Monahan played some pretty sheltered minutes in his first year, at a time when the Flames were pretty shallow at centre. He was thrust into the #1 centre role last year as a result of injuries. Granted, he thrived in that role but I think that's the exception rather than the norm.    I don't mean to say that Bennett couldn't also thrive in a similar situation, but he's a young centre on a team that has tons of centre depth. Pairing him with strong possession players like Backlund and Frolik (not to mention our now stellar D-core) will give him the best chance to succeed, I think."
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,winkylems,2,Thu Jul 2 03:41:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I think this opens up the option to trade a centre down the road, once Bennett can make the move."
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,Rooster697,2,Thu Jul 2 07:28:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but we'll be in a different situation next season then we were two years ago. I don't think we should play Bennett at centre because that would probably put him on the 3rd or 4th line. I think he should be a 2nd line winger for next season, until he's more accustomed to the NHL game"
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,gaganminhas,0,Thu Jul 2 03:40:59 2015 UTC,I think it would be ideal to put Backlund as a 3rd line centre and Bennett as our 2nd .
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,Ninjygingy,2,Thu Jul 2 05:22:54 2015 UTC,Yeah it happens alot where young NHL centers won't play center for the first 2-3 years until they get a feel for it and better at certain areas (I.E faceoffs)
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,takingabbath,5,Thu Jul 2 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"Bollig is still among the forwards, but I don't know how much ice time he will see this season. The less the better as far as I'm concerned."
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,takingabbath,0,Thu Jul 2 02:56:46 2015 UTC,"Bollig, England + for a RW prospect or low round pick?"
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,theFlamingRaven,8,Thu Jul 2 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone is going to want those two. Maybe BT can convince a cap floor team to take a contract or two off our hands (Arizona comes to mind). If he can conjure up some more of his GM wizardry and offload some of those guys, my next Flames jersey will have his name on the back."
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,marbsarebad,2,Thu Jul 2 03:25:20 2015 UTC,Throw Hiller in the mix and maybe
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,Howboutchadontt,-1,Thu Jul 2 04:19:07 2015 UTC,"That will never, ever happen."
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,Roughly6Owls,6,Thu Jul 2 15:12:22 2015 UTC,Kenny Morrison is a possible d man to make the team.
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,BootRacer,5,Thu Jul 2 03:26:21 2015 UTC,I really want the Flames to sign Schlemko... Any news on him? He's a UFA right?
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,Svenka,6,Thu Jul 2 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"Schlemko's currently up for grabs -- I think we'll see the Flames pick him up if Smid is projected to be on LTIR for the entirety of next season, or if we trade him."
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,PMHerper,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:35:19 2015 UTC,I really hope so. He had excellent numbers for a 3rd pairing guy. Afraid someone will grab him for cheap

CalgaryFlames,3btu70,rpawson5771,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:40:52 2015 UTC,We have a lot of extra forwards. Maybe Engelland and some of them can be packaged for some RW prospects. Smid might be able to be shipped to Arizona or some other cap floor team.
CalgaryFlames,3btu70,Svenka,2,Thu Jul 2 02:56:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think a team will be willing to take Smid with him being so prone to injury, but we might be able to trade Engelland to a team, but it would be difficult. I'd love to somehow get rid of Raymond as well."

CalgaryFlames,3brz8v,ImVenasaur,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:38:15 2015 UTC,You could tell his time here raised his stock and shows how much potential he still has if he has the right environment to work in.
CalgaryFlames,3bs5nu,canowhoop,3,Wed Jul 1 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"Ceiling: 3rd-4th line defensive forward that can put in major time on the PK. Has a proven track record of faceoff wins, especially in the defensive zone.   Floor: Career AHLer.   I'm learning towards somewhere in the middle, but closer to the ceiling. He does have offensive skill, just has been put into more defensive scenarios. Only recently got put onto Binghamton's PP and did significantly well considering the short time he had there."
CalgaryFlames,3bs5nu,JVMJRDOT,3,Wed Jul 1 19:49:48 2015 UTC,This guy should have been playing in Ottawa last year had it not been for smith and legwands brutal contracts. This is a solid signing and given the right opportunities grant is going to be a big asset for the flames in the defensive end and especially on the PK.
CalgaryFlames,3bs5nu,InternetBear,3,Wed Jul 1 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"Big 6'3 , 206 lbs, 25 years old. Depth signing. Scored 21 AHL goals last year"

CalgaryFlames,3bra77,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jul 1 18:03:30 2015 UTC,Bingo.
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,captaindigbob,3,Wed Jul 1 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"So, either we're shopping Hiller and we're pretty confident we've made a deal,  Or we're pretty confident that Ortio's either got a lot of value and we'll get a good return for him, or he's got so little that he can be safely waived."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,XXVariation,11,Wed Jul 1 14:56:27 2015 UTC,I highly doubt he would clear waivers
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,Suzaku94,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if, knock on wood, Ortio's injury recovery wasn't as successful as was previously thought. I hope he is O.K. but that is the only reasoning outside of having a Hiller deal lined up that makes sense to me."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,michaelmac26,3,Wed Jul 1 18:55:53 2015 UTC,I personally wanted Hiller/ ortio :/ I'm very confused by this... I REALLY hope we don't get rid of ortio though. So hyped for that train
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,fknSamsquamptch,2,Wed Jul 1 16:50:07 2015 UTC,Hiller must be on the block
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,fearlesscontender,2,Wed Jul 1 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm, one more year in the pipes for Ortio?  Who could be in the market for Hiller?"
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,Buksey,2,Wed Jul 1 14:51:59 2015 UTC,"He signed for 1 year, at 3.8 million"
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,RDC123,2,Wed Jul 1 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a little shocked by this, I didn't expect Ramo to stay due to the goalie situation. Happy, but confused. Could we be looking at a Hiller (or Ortio) trade? Other option is Trevling overruled Burkes 3 Goalie statment."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,Buksey,2,Wed Jul 1 15:11:06 2015 UTC,Or place Hiller on waivers and eat the cost
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,RDC123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:14:44 2015 UTC,"True. I never really considered that. Off the two, I would rather see Ortio stay up."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no way Ortio clears waivers anyways. Hopefully they can get a return for Hiller, he's still a solid goalie."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,RawRnR,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"Three goalies wouldn't be the worst thing in the short term. The Flames have cap room this season, and they can take a longer look at how Ortio performs as an NHL backup while sorting who between Ramo and Hiller stays for next season.  Once the trade deadline approaches, they could get a pick to rent one of the goalies out.  The downside is the Flames have 14 waiver-eligible forwards plus Bennett. One more of them (or a defenceman) will have to be exposed if the Flames keep three goalies."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,Renslip1,2,Wed Jul 1 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"If Hiller is getting traded, that would be great. The battle between Ortio and Ramo should be great. I really look forward to what Ortio has to bring after seeing his unreal performances last season for the Flames"

CalgaryFlames,3bra77,donksdonksdonks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:54:08 2015 UTC,Do we have to waive Ortio at the start of the season to get him into the AHL?  Or can we just start him there?
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,AKAdyje,3,Wed Jul 1 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"He will need to clear waivers to go down to the AHL, all players are considered on the main roster until they are assigned otherwise. That's when waiver eligibility comes in and he would run the risk of getting claimed"
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,MarcusBrody96,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is really surprising. I don't see much point in keeping him around if we still have Hiller. I really want Ortio to get a shot at becoming our starting goaltender."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,NewmanTheScofflaw,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:02:09 2015 UTC,YAY!  But what is happening with our other guys? I won't celebrate until I know this.

CalgaryFlames,3bra77,NewmanTheScofflaw,7,Wed Jul 1 16:02:21 2015 UTC,You'll be glad to know it's only $3.8 million.
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,teckhz,2,Wed Jul 1 16:10:13 2015 UTC,His last paycheck was almost 3 mil and he improved. I guess I was over reacting.
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,SkiFreeSasquatch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:15:24 2015 UTC,Not a huge deal since it's only 1 year.
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,lancemeszaros,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"Well, either Hiller or Ortio is on the move. The one year deal is a little confusing. None of our prospects outside Ortio will be NHL ready after next year, so I'd expect to resign Ramo again after next season."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,Chronixx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"This signing makes no sense.  If they're keeping Hiller then there's no point in signing Ramo period.  If they're on the verge of trading Hiller for a good return (it had better be not less than a first-round pick) then Ramo's just there to be a one-year stop-gap so they can test Ortio at backup before giving him the starting job.  That makes sense, but then why bother signing him for $3.8 mil?  That's ridiculous for a goalie that's basically replacement level.  Thankfully they're not close to the cap and it's only one year."
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,tehReno,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:51:45 2015 UTC,This is the best news to me so far.
CalgaryFlames,3bra77,blink0r,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:26 2015 UTC,"I have been calling this all along.  You do not let someone with the value that Ramo has go to UFA.  You sign him to a number he likes, and then you deal him or Hiller.    Flames are in control with this now, they have 2 goalies of decent value that they can deal, 3 if you include Orts in this, but I do not think they will deal him.    This signing just puts BT further in the drivers seat.  It was a good signing, even if we do not use him.  It is a signing that could cost us literally nothing."
CalgaryFlames,3brqgv,lancemeszaros,5,Wed Jul 1 16:47:22 2015 UTC,please treat Frolik well!!
CalgaryFlames,3brqgv,imfromwinnipeg,6,Wed Jul 1 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"For those not familiar: 27-year-old RW, came off a $3.3 mil contract, 19 goals and 42 points in 82 games last season, held pointless in the playoffs, had the second best fancystats on the Jets of any main roster player with a 55.15% even strength CF%.  Looks to be a solid pickup, depending on the price."
CalgaryFlames,3brqgv,fknSamsquamptch,2,Wed Jul 1 16:55:39 2015 UTC,His statline is similar to a right-wing Backlund.
CalgaryFlames,3brqgv,wireframe88,3,Wed Jul 1 17:01:09 2015 UTC,And similar to Hudler when the Flames acquired him.
CalgaryFlames,3brqgv,marbsarebad,0,Wed Jul 1 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"He puts up better #s than Backlund, though.  Can you imagine if they play him with Backs and Bennett all year?  Talk about sweetening the Calder for Bennett."
CalgaryFlames,3brqgv,fknSamsquamptch,2,Wed Jul 1 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"Better goals, exact same point/60 with very similar usage."
CalgaryFlames,3brqgv,MDexm,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:19:07 2015 UTC,Calder votes will be mostly reserved for McJesus. I'm thinking Sam will need to punch in at least 10 more points than Connor and lead him most/all of the season to have a chance.

CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,trent-henderson,-2,Wed Jul 1 19:04:04 2015 UTC,"Calgary goaltender Joni Ortio is waiver exempt for four years (or 80 NHL games) because he signed his first deal when he was 20. However, Reto Berra signed his first NHL deal when he was 26, he was only waiver exempt for his first season."
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Waldo76,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"...Yeah, he signed his first deal at age 20, and was exempt for 4 years. He's 24 now, and those 4 years are up."
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,trent-henderson,2,Wed Jul 1 19:21:25 2015 UTC,http://www.spotrac.com/nhl/calgary-flames/joni-ortio/  shows his first professional contract was in the 13/14 season. and that he is entering his 3rd year? Maybe the site has the info wrong.
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Waldo76,2,Wed Jul 1 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looks like it does. He signed an ELC in 2011.  http://flames.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=557748"
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,trent-henderson,5,Wed Jul 1 19:28:29 2015 UTC,"Yea looks like I was wrong.   http://www.generalfanager.com/players/384  Shows that he is entering his 5th year of professional play. So he will have to clear waivers. The part that also confuses me, is that can't you delegate your players to AHL prior to the season starting and they will not have to clear waivers at that point? Only if they get called up during the season and sent back down. Can anyone confirm?"
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Waldo76,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:37:04 2015 UTC,This is what the flamesnation.ca guys are thinking will happen -- I'm not smart enough re: how waivers work to confirm it though.
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:05:29 2015 UTC,Looks like waivers are in effect 12 days before the regular season. Perhaps Ortio could be assigned before then?

CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,catsfive,-2,Wed Jul 1 23:05:10 2015 UTC,Ortiz is on a one way deal now therefore he is eligible for waivers.
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Iphone4Lyfe,2,Wed Jul 1 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"The type of contract has nothing to do with waiver eligibility. The difference between a one-way and two-way contract is the amount of money the player earns. In a one-way contract, the player earns a set amount of money regardless of where they play (NHL or AHL). In a two-way contract, the player earns a different amount depending on where they play."
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,trent-henderson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:23:09 2015 UTC,1 way deals do not impact waivers. All they do is guarantee the player the NHL salary.
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Waldo76,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:21:22 2015 UTC,Ortio does not have to clear waivers to come up to NHL. He does have to clear waivers to go back down though.
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,demsnapples,3,Wed Jul 1 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"-Dump the cap baggage  -Perhaps another splash trade  -Goalie situation  Forget the goalies as first priority, Hiller & Ramo's deals end this year  meaning a better chance for a trade. Ortio is also young, no need to rush him into the bugs. Instead focus on creating cap room so we can be active at the deadline if we're good enough. Especially since these expensive players are expendable (Smid, Egghead, Wideman)"
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,MasteroftheHallows,3,Wed Jul 1 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"We've got to deal with our goalies.  Otherwise, Brad'll make his job easier for next season if he can get assets for Smid, Engelland, Bollig, or Raymond."
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jul 1 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"I really don't think anything needs to be done at this point. We have the depth, let everyone go into camp and earn spots. Ortio/Gillies will be a good AHL Combo. Ramo/Hiller can work hard on their contract years to see where they go from there."
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,Waldo76,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"Sign our remaining RFAs, minor moved here or there  I don't expect any more major signings or trades at this point.  Thinking the lineup could be (bottom 6 is a mystery)  Gaudreau - Monahan - Hudler Bennett - Backlund - Frolik Bouma - Jooris - Jones Ferland - Stajan - Colborne  Gio - Brodie Russell - Hamilton Wotherspoon/Engelland - Wideman"
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,tehReno,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"Now that they have resigned Ramo, they are going to use that as leverage to deal a solid goalie, for prospects or picks.  I do not know which will go, but one will.  As much as we need to dump Eggheads contract, no GM in their right mind will pick up that much cap hit, and honestly, we do not have anything to add in as a kicker that we would be willing to part with.  I could see Jones going for prospects/picks, since we picked up Frolik now.  Jones is a solid 2/3 line winger for a team that needs a bit of a pickup.  He is made of glass, but I think he got a tempering this season.  I could see him dealing somewhere south...someone that needs a cheap, big body for a year.  Outside of that, I am just waiting for the Young Stars Tourney.  Trying to book the time off for it and spend the weekend at my Dads in Penticton."
CalgaryFlames,3bs7qn,NewmanTheScofflaw,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"I think today's moves are clear Brad Treiliving already knows who he's gonna re-sign at the end of next. He knows the cap situation. So you'll see at the max huds, ramo/hiller and wideman re-signed. As well as the ending entry contracts of monny and Johnny.   The cap situation still scares me though. It can kill teams and we haven't even peaked yet."
CalgaryFlames,3bs1qh,Ninjygingy,3,Wed Jul 1 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"Flames fan here who happens to live in Winnipeg.  Frolik was awesome here and a fan favorite.  He is very versatile and can be moved up and down the line up.  Pk, Pp ,1st to 3rd lines he can pretty much handle anything and puts the team first.  Never heard a grumble from this guy.  The people in Winnipeg have been bummed out about losing him especially since he signed for less then 5mil.  I think most would have taken Frolik over Strafford.  I like this deal and cant wait to see the Flames here in Winnipeg's home opener! Woooo.... Go Flames Go!"

CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,Buksey,2,Thu Jul 2 15:48:59 2015 UTC,One can hope.
CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,teckhz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"This was posted in another thread elsewhere. In 2016 we have Jones Huds, Ramo and Hiller coming off at ~16 Mill. In 2017, Wideman, Engelland, Raymond, Bollig (iirc) and Smid are UFAs freeing up another 16 Million.   That would give, as off right nows cap, the Flames roughly 23 Mill in 2016 to resign players. Gio may take up about 6-7 Million of that.   Jones is now expendable with Frolick, and players like Poirer coming up, so he could be shipped at trade deadline. I also wouldn't be suprised to see Ramo or Hiller gone by then too. With Wideman and Engelland having only 1 year left after this season, it could be possible to trade them in 2016 off season to free up even more cap room."
CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,Buksey,2,Wed Jul 1 19:41:39 2015 UTC,Remember that Gio already makes 4M so he likely only takes 3-4.5M of that assuming he gets paid 7-8.5M
CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,catsfive,2,Wed Jul 1 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"Right! That is a good point, and puts a in a slightly better spot."
CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,bumbuff,0,Wed Jul 1 20:49:05 2015 UTC,"Remember before the CBA was signed (bringing us the cap, etc.) the Flames gathered all the players together and just opened the books, showed everything that they had, just so the players would know what was really going on? There were a lot of rumours flying then, etc. Well, that should be a regular thing. When a team signs a bridge contract or whatever with someone, that would really help everyone be a lot more comfortable."
CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,kapxis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents: I'm not doing them the math, but I see Bollig contributing more and being more valuable than Raymond and may possibly stay after next year.

CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:04:38 2015 UTC,"Be cool if that turns out right, but i feel otherwise about him.  I think his ceiling is low and he has a tendancy to take bad penalties at bad times.  And with Bouma and Ferland able to do the role of smashing guys better, and having a higher offensive ceiling. I don't see either him or Raymond sticking around.  Unless Raymond gets a chance to play with Bennet and Frolik and has a stellar season."
CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,larsy87,-1,Fri Jul 3 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"Next off-season is going to hurt: we're looking to re-sign Hudler (4), Russell (2.6), Jones (4), all three goaltenders (8.9), Giordano (4), Monahan (.95), Gaudreau (.95), Colborne (1.2), and Granlund (.76). This means we'll have about 27 million dollars to retain all these guys, though that's actually only about seven million in space to give these guys raises (plus whatever we gain from players who we don't re-sign -- I'm expecting at least Jones and four million off the goaltenders won't be retained). Possible, but much more comfortably possible if we can get rid of one of our two-year contracts that we're as not happy with (Engelland, Smid, Bollig, Raymond, Wideman) -- all of these expire in 2017, which is unfortunate because that's the year after all of our cap problems are solved."
CalgaryFlames,3bsc3i,Mr-Rocafella,2,Wed Jul 1 20:46:51 2015 UTC,None of this makes any sense. Why are we signing 3 goalies?

Comparable contracts (and they're attractive comparables -- Giroux last season, Cammalleri in 07/08, Callahan in 12/13) and statistical analysis suggest Frolik was worth about 4.89 to 4.96 million per year.  In one sentence? We underpaid."

CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,6,Wed Jul 1 17:11:40 2015 UTC,I think this says A LOT about how players view the Flames. We seem to be a place where players want to goto and stay. Hamilton and him both signed for less then what they really could've gotten.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Buksey,4,Wed Jul 1 17:15:23 2015 UTC,Looks like at least Frolik and Hamilton believe they can be important parts of a competing team for the next five years.

CalgaryFlames,3braea,Fythian,2,Thu Jul 2 01:06:00 2015 UTC,It's been fairly sane in terms of money and cap hit for forwards so far. Probably a combination of the minimal cap increase and weaker crop of UFAs available.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,rpawson5771,2,Thu Jul 2 01:07:35 2015 UTC,Pretty much every UFA available today is on my do not touch list.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,tempz77,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:59:39 2015 UTC,Ya free agency frenzy is always madness and more often then not seems to end in regrets. But we did get Jiri Hudler on July 1st. Goal is to find a similar value guy.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Buksey,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:07:50 2015 UTC,"The more I look at the UFAs, the more I hope the Flames don't do anything. There are no players out there that I think would be a better fit than players we already have in the system. This year seems weak for a UFA crop. Let other teams toss money at them, we can save our cap room for a trade later to push us into the playoffs."
CalgaryFlames,3braea,fknSamsquamptch,3,Wed Jul 1 16:16:19 2015 UTC,Apparently we're front of the line for Frolik.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,nexxai,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:47:09 2015 UTC,Done deal.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,TJYoshi,3,Wed Jul 1 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"The Flames only have ~7 mil left in cap space... thank god we didn't take on a bad contract. But how are we gonna re-sign Russell, extend Gio, and have room to sign Hudler and the kids next year? Suddenly we're a cap strapped team"
CalgaryFlames,3braea,donksdonksdonks,3,Wed Jul 1 17:31:14 2015 UTC,"Hudler, Jones, Hiller, Ramo expire next summer (2016, -$16.3 mill), and Raymond, Bollig, Wideman, Engelland, and Smid expire in 2017 (-~16 mill) so we will be getting some space there assuming we can develop our own young guys to replace them on cheap contracts. Put Smid on LTIR and it'll help a bit sooner.  Not a terrible position, but not a cap floor team anymore either"
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Buksey,2,Wed Jul 1 17:42:20 2015 UTC,The only ones I see being extended or resigned out of all those would be Huds and Ramo or Hiller (depending on this upcoming year). Jones and Wideman would be maybe.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,6,Wed Jul 1 17:46:16 2015 UTC,"With Frolik being signed, if one of our RW prospects (POIRIER PLZ) flys out of trading camp and cracks the line-up, don't be surprised to see Jones get moved at the deadline ala Glencross last season."
CalgaryFlames,3braea,TJYoshi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:02:09 2015 UTC,"Next year, we'll keep one of Hiller or Ramo (preferably Ramo), and we'll probably re-sign Hudler and let Jones walk. But Hudler will be looking to cash in, so i don't think there will be much savings there. But in 2017 I'm sure we'll let all of them walk, that will clear up a lot of room"
CalgaryFlames,3braea,tempz77,3,Wed Jul 1 17:47:52 2015 UTC,Lol Kessel to Pittsburgh.   Think I like the Frolik deal. Just bizarre how he's the highest payed forward now.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,locoenchilada,3,Wed Jul 1 17:59:37 2015 UTC,Diaz signed with the Rangers. Nice knowing ya Raffa.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,theFlamingRaven,3,Wed Jul 1 17:59:54 2015 UTC,TSN has like 80 talking heads on set today and no Scott Cullen in sight. What a plug.

CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jul 1 15:02:41 2015 UTC,Flames close on Frolik!!!!!!!
CalgaryFlames,3braea,teckhz,2,Wed Jul 1 16:47:08 2015 UTC,Bob Mackenzie has just said we're front-runners for Frolik. FROLIK.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jul 1 16:47:13 2015 UTC,I feel like Treliving understands now the team truly needs to improve in possession to succeed.  Hopefully it's a reasonable contract
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,3,Wed Jul 1 16:48:51 2015 UTC,"If it's expensive, I'll be sad.  If it's reasonable, Treliving wins draft day and free agent day."

CalgaryFlames,3braea,Beta1224,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:15:08 2015 UTC,Why Sekera? Where would he slot in?  I wouldn't want any of these 3. Let's try to keep the team young.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:35:49 2015 UTC,"Sekera assumes we have Smid on LTIR -- he moves ahead of Russell on the depth chart.  It's a combination of things -- one, Sekera's off the market, he can't go anywhere else.  Two, we've got disgusting depth, we can fully trust all six of our defensemen to play more than 20 minutes a night if we need to.  Maybe it's too much money tied into defense (which is possible), maybe it's too greedy. I don't think it's likely Calgary makes the highest offer to Sekera -- but he'd be a massive upgrade on Schlemko."
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Beta1224,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:30 2015 UTC,I think we need to keep with our D. I don't want to see Russell on a third pairing. He is way too valuable

CalgaryFlames,3braea,Fythian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:50:21 2015 UTC,What's our cap situation looking like will we still be able to afford Monahan and Gaudreau to long-term deals next year after the Gio contract extension? What about the 18 year old?
CalgaryFlames,3braea,theFlamingRaven,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:28:54 2015 UTC,"We're sitting at about 64m right now, before re-signing Jooris/Bouma/Ferland/Byron."
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:38:19 2015 UTC,I guess that would likely mean Monahan and Gaudreau would both get similar bridge deals next year then.  I think the team will have to make some tough decisions next year.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,bsellis14,3,Wed Jul 1 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"We've also got Giordano, Russell, Jones, Hudler, Colbourne, and both our goaltenders to extend/lose the cap hit on next season -- that's more than 25 million coming off the books, though only the goaltenders and Jones are unlikely to be re-signed IMO.  Considering Frolik is an upgrade to Jones and he's 300k more, I don't see Jones returning after next season."
CalgaryFlames,3braea,MattFiresideChat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"Wiseman, Jones, and a goalie are all very likely gone next off season. That should free up enough space for Monahan, gaudreau and gio"
CalgaryFlames,3braea,newfie_hiscock,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:46:14 2015 UTC,Does our deal with Dougie look even better seeing Sekera sign for similar?  Younger and better in my opinion!

CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it does. Hamilton's in elite company with regards to how much he's accomplished so young."
CalgaryFlames,3braea,newfie_hiscock,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:32:03 2015 UTC,So this pretty much says that Hiller is on his way out? Because we cannot run 3 goalies next year.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:34:34 2015 UTC,Gaudreau-Monahan-Hudler  Frolik-Bennett-Colborne  Bouma-Backlund-Jones  Ferland-Stajan-Shore   Extras - Raymond Bollig Jooris Byron   Giordano-Brodie  Hamilton-Engelland  Russell-Wideman  Smid  Hiller  Ramo  That's a fairly stacked team with a bunch of guys that are on the farm that could jump in at any moment. I think Raymond is going to be dealt to anyone needing a 3rd line winger in the coming weeks.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,CuggyofHouseAbby,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:32:09 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if wides/egg will be traded depending on the teams evaluation of Spoon's development.  Given Hartley's track record I'm assuming he would rather keep Spoon close and hopefully in the lineup.
CalgaryFlames,3braea,AlleyBj,2,Wed Jul 1 23:53:41 2015 UTC,Don't forget Wideman has the NMC. He may want to stick out the season in Calgary and decide at the deadline if be thinks Calgary is his best bet for glory

CalgaryFlames,3brap7,fknSamsquamptch,8,Wed Jul 1 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"That's not the rumored extension, that's the rumored starting point in negotiations from Gio's camp."
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,rpawson5771,8,Wed Jul 1 15:24:15 2015 UTC,No way he would ask for that AAV AND term at his age. Just a stupid rumour.   He isn't worth that at 33. He needs high AAV and 4 yrs or less or longer term and a AAV under 7.
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,tempz77,2,Wed Jul 1 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"I read this and was like, ""Oh, God, no, no, no, we still need a winger damnit..."""
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,catsfive,7,Wed Jul 1 16:12:26 2015 UTC,8 years??? That feels way too long
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,locoenchilada,5,Wed Jul 1 14:57:04 2015 UTC,This is an agents asking price -- I don't think he'll be quite so expensive.
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,Roughly6Owls,3,Wed Jul 1 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"He wants PK's contract, apparently"
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,jshare,2,Wed Jul 1 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"If Gio is looking for that kind of contract, I'm happy to let him play his contract year to hopefully drop his value.  That's a little insane for an older guy."
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,theFlamingRaven,2,Wed Jul 1 15:32:13 2015 UTC,This Gio's last big pay day and he's knows it and he knows his value. I think he'll get the maximum number of years but more like 6 or 7 AAV or a much shorter term (2 or 3) at 9.
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,Fythian,2,Wed Jul 1 15:36:08 2015 UTC,"Too long. The number of players  who are worth that as they approach 40 (the tail end) can be counted on one hand. I have no issue with the AAV, just the length. I'd top out at four years, if he wants longer he'll have to go down in price."
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,Polymarchos,2,Wed Jul 1 16:56:34 2015 UTC,I'm totally with you. If it was something long term with a 7 AAV with 9 now I wouldn't mind it but 9 AAV is insane for that long
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,dddamnet,2,Wed Jul 1 17:19:05 2015 UTC,I highly doubt we're going to pay him 9 mil a year AAV

For the record, your maximum contract length/dollars for Giordano are in sync with mine. I hope the Flames can sign him for those terms."
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,mikesulls,2,Wed Jul 1 22:10:04 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, I thought his birthday was in June for some reason.   My bad man, I'm just nervous about this contract extension.   I would like to think my contract idea is fair for both sides."
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,rpawson5771,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think it is fair. Treliving has to sell Giordano and his agent on the idea of renewing year to year after that if he's still playing at a competitive level, like other organizations have done with aging players."
CalgaryFlames,3brap7,mikesulls,2,Wed Jul 1 22:21:56 2015 UTC,I'd like that but I think Gio is looking for his pay day. I just want him to make somewhat of a compromise to help keep our young core together and not be screwed over when it comes to signing our young guys.

CalgaryFlames,3bnja5,Thumper17,3,Tue Jun 30 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"For offer sheet purposes, it would have an AAV of 6.9M (5.75 AAV * 6 yrs = 34.5M, divide that by 5 = 6.9 AAV) so Boston was probably not capable of matching that and would lose him anyway  Considering they came out with 1st, 2nd, 2nd, instead of 1st, 2nd, 3rd... I'd say everyone got a better deal than going the offer sheet route."
CalgaryFlames,3bnja5,Polymarchos,2,Tue Jun 30 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"I can't see why Boston wouldn't match that. Just cause it's 6.9 AAV for compensation doesn't mean the whole deal isn't 5.75 million. Boston could afford that. And even if Hamilton wanted out and refused to sign, why wouldn't they get more for him? He's worth more than that, even if it's better than compensation."
CalgaryFlames,3bnja5,catsfive,2,Tue Jun 30 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yea, Boston trading him was less of a cap issue and more of a 'fuck  you we don't want you on this team'. Unless we're missing something Boston is shit stupid. We basically traded our first rounder for Dougie. And we don't get that 15th pick unless we lose to Anaheim. And we don't get those seconds if Baertschi isn't a bitch and Curtis didn't want out. Every time I think of who we got and for what, I damn near brick my pants."

CalgaryFlames,3bpeq4,winkylems,6,Wed Jul 1 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"And 18 year old Sam Bennett is just 19, so he'll probably grow a couple inches more and full out his frame. Monny might also gain another inch or so and add some pounds. So we aren't a small team at all, especially with Hamilton now."

CalgaryFlames,3bpeq4,mikesulls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"Despite the other three Stewart is probably a possibility to sign with us.  The only organizational flaw, currently, is RW, and Stewart fills that hole.  He's a decent scorer, and he already has the hard-working gritty mentality that the Flames covet.  Also, he won't be very expensive and he probably won't want much term (he better not).  Frolik and St Louis would be WAY too expensive, even though they would provide more points, they lack the two-way game and character that Stewart provides.  For me, it's between Stewart or Williams for UFA pick-ups this offseason.  Anyone else is no-no."
CalgaryFlames,3bpeq4,BN_Flames_Fan,5,Wed Jul 1 02:39:56 2015 UTC,Frolik is actually a pretty good two way player and has solid defensive play.
CalgaryFlames,3bpeq4,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:44:43 2015 UTC,"He is and would probably be a good fit, but considering the overall FA talent he is going to cost way too much. I think we're better off giving some of the younger guys more chances to get NHL experience and prove themselves. Look at what that did to players like Jooris, Colborne, Granlund, and that irrelevant guy Ferkland."
CalgaryFlames,3bpeq4,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jul 1 05:37:42 2015 UTC,"Stewart may be to Burke's liking: after the draft he was talking as usual about the need to add size and muscle on the wing.  However, Treliving is the GM, and he seems to have a better grasp that Stewart is a black hole in terms of possession. The Flames should pass.  Frolik is a better bet from a posession standpoint.  At this point, the Flames have 14 waiver-eligible forwards plus Bennett. Poirier, Wolf, and perhaps others may be pushing for spots. The Flames don't need more bodies, they need more skilled bodies.  I don't see any UFAs offering a big improvement on players they have, with the exception of Bollig and Raymond."

CalgaryFlames,3boir0,barn_yard,16,Tue Jun 30 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah but we have a youthful core this time, and management have been clear that we are a rebuilding team, not one trying to patchwork something together around Iggy before it's too late.  We all have expectations now because of last year, and it would suck to see us regress, but I think BT and crew have been very cautious about letting that success go to their heads, letting it change the game plan. The game plan is the same, and that is building the future of this team, not mortgaging our future to try and buy success today.  With that in mind I share your caution, not trying to get too far ahead with my expectations. Just excited to watch these young guys continue to grow under the leadership of some awesome vets."
CalgaryFlames,3boir0,radiomorning,8,Tue Jun 30 21:42:26 2015 UTC,"Except: No Sutter this time. That's a big, BIG plus"

CalgaryFlames,3boir0,NewmanTheScofflaw,5,Wed Jul 1 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"Well aren't you just a breath of fresh air.   But really, I think we;ll be way better. Back then our D core may have been good, but our forward group was all built around Iggy. We have way more depth on our forward group now. Also a way younger team. Positivity my friend!"
CalgaryFlames,3boir0,mikesulls,2,Tue Jun 30 22:19:04 2015 UTC,"I definitely appreciate the caution. I think the core players are still trending up with this squad, unlike 2009 when players were starting to fade (Phaneuf, Regehr, Iginla) - of course, that fade is a lot easier to see with the benefit of hindsight. Plus I think the coaching staff here is better equipped to keep this roster on an even keel than Brent Sutter and his staff in 2009 were.    Also, Iginla scored 50+ in 07-08, not in 08-09 leading into the 2009 off-season when Bouwmeester was acquired and signed."
CalgaryFlames,3boir0,rpawson5771,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"No - flames are younger, faster and arguably way more talented (although lacking a goalie right now). The team is all buying into the system, locker room cancers are absent and management will not mortgage the future for past-their-prime players. Always good to temper the excitement, but things are looking way more positive then they were back then. Besides that they were making desperation moves to try to break through the first round and pushing off the inevitable collapse."
CalgaryFlames,3boir0,stacksOFFstacks,4,Tue Jun 30 21:42:06 2015 UTC,I mean Hiller posted a .918 last year so its not like he's brutal by any stretch of the imagination. Wouldn't be surprised to see that number go past .920 behind Hamilton and co this season though
CalgaryFlames,3boir0,chodes_r_us,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:04:09 2015 UTC,Phaneuf was already sucking and tbh i thought JayBo came after the White trade.  2009 we were literally looking for spare parts to quickfix depth issues. We should have rebuilt then but did not.
CalgaryFlames,3boir0,Chronixx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:54:56 2015 UTC,"Our team can only get better from this point. Back in 09, most of the players you mentioned had peaked.

CalgaryFlames,3boir0,weendex,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"I don't like using the phrase ""rebuilding"", but instead ""building"".  In 2009 we had already built a contender. We weren't ""building"" a team anymore, we were simply going for broke, all eggs in the 2009 basket. Why not? We had a veritable superstar in his prime with solid support, a top notch defensive core, and a systematically perfect goalie. That was the year we ""went for it"".  Turns out that's a huge huge risk that rarely pays off, you can't just pick a year or two and decide to go for it. There is no point in time when ""this is it, we go for it NOW"". It's simply a game of always building for the future.   The current situation is a far better approach, as far as I, the random internet flames fan, am concerned.  Hamilton was a great long-term pickup. I don't see that as a pickup for our playoff contention next year, but instead for many years to come. The ""build"" process should never end, and I'm hoping that the trend continues with these long term pickups, and significantly less short term ""immediate boost"" signings. The phrase ""rebuild"" needs to be dropped from our vocabulary. The process we are in should never stop. It's just build."

CalgaryFlames,3bnlev,tempz77,4,Tue Jun 30 17:41:45 2015 UTC,This is a perfect fit. Brandon went 53-11-8 last year with one of the youngest squads in the dub. Kelly Mccrimmon is a great coach for a young defender to learn from. The CHL is where this kid needs to be playing to learn the north american game and get his confidence back. It would be like when we drafted Backlund and brought him over for a very successful WHL season in Kelowna. Just have to convince him.

CalgaryFlames,3bn1ud,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:24:59 2015 UTC,"It's worth considering how many UFA years are bought with a longer deal. RFA years aren't worth as much.  Brodie signed for five years at $4.65 million AAV. That included three UFA years if I remember correctly. Hamilton has played three years, so has four RFA years remaining, I think. On that basis, Hamilton should be getting paid less than Brodie. However, given Hamilton's projected improvement (he just turned 22) the greater threat of offer sheets, and the lack of built-up loyalty to his new team, Hamilton will make more."
CalgaryFlames,3bn1ud,Butterblanket,2,Tue Jun 30 16:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's the whole projection thing and the hype around him, which is justified. It's not the best for us, but I get where Dougie is coming from, if he ends up like Doughty or Subban, he is gonna want to be paid. I think he knows if he's not gonna get a deal from x, he's gonna get it from y."
CalgaryFlames,3bn1ud,Kellervo,2,Tue Jun 30 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"But the words of an actual teammate would indicate the picture painted by the anonymous GM aren't true. And makes it seem clear that the trade was not about Hamilton's clubhouse deportment but about money, and the (probably accurate) Bruins' belief that he was never going to develop into the type of player worthy of the salary he's seeking.  Boston's concern is that Hamilton cares much more about offense and his power-play duties as a puck-moving defenseman, and isn’t ever going to fully embrace the all-around responsibilities of a No. 1 D-man in the defensive zone.   This kind of stands out to me because I just don't get Boston's thought process. They decided to try and sell high on him but they ended up selling him for the equivalent of pennies on the dollar.   In the league today, a blueliner of his caliber at any age would get a king's ransom, to say nothing of the fact he's younger than his peers."

CalgaryFlames,3bnar4,lancemeszaros,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:28:05 2015 UTC,"If you guys want to focus on ""work ethic"" and ""toxic presence"" then we can hire Sweeney and Neely to run the team.  Personally, I'd rather get talented players that can help the team win.  Semin has been proven to drive the play and help make his linemates better, while playing on a terrible Canes team.  He can do the same up here, and he'll get better results on a better team, and we are desperately lacking in top RW.  The team should not pick him up for a long-term and/or $7 mil AAV deal, but I don't think anyone will be after he was bought out.  If they can pick him up on a 3-4 year deal worth ~$5 mil AAV that would be solid."
CalgaryFlames,3bnar4,CleetusVanDamme,5,Tue Jun 30 17:48:45 2015 UTC,That would be solid.   solid     *Retarded
CalgaryFlames,3bnar4,lancemeszaros,0,Tue Jun 30 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"Things like ""worth ethic"" and ""toxic presence"" are just buzzwords.  Why?  Because if they actually mattered then they'd affect a player's on-ice performance.  If they don't affect his performance then they don't matter.  Semin has consistently been a possession driver, which on top of being a RW makes him exactly what the Flames need the most right now.  He has talent.  Let him use it on a good team instead of on the Canes and it'll pay dividends.  Don't pick him up on waivers because $7 mil AAV is stupid unless they're an elite scorer, which he's not.  But he's nowhere close to being Setoguchi either."
CalgaryFlames,3bnar4,CleetusVanDamme,5,Tue Jun 30 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, I disagree with a lot of what you're saying. ""Work ethic"" is not a buzzword. And a player who is widely known to consistently play the easy routes, not battle on the boards, not play the body, and dog-fuck on the backcheck, is exactly the type of player this team could do without. The Flames are at a point now where their established system is starting to pay off, and Semin is not the type of player that would work in this system.    But the thing I disagree with most is the money/term. If you could score a guy like that for $3million MAX for one year, then I'd perhaps consider it. But an oft injured, streaky forward, who has underperformed lately, who just got bought out by his former team, does not deserve 5m/3-4years. He just doesn't, and he won't get that here."
CalgaryFlames,3bnar4,lancemeszaros,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"If his work ethic is so toxic, if he's such a soft player, then explain how he's able to routinely drive possession?  That's what I mean about it being a buzzword: if it doesn't hurt his performance (like in Semin's case) then it's not worth caring about.  If it doesn't hurt his performance, then you'll be judging him on his performance anyway.  $5mil/3-4 years would probably be the max offer.  I'd like to see him for cheaper, obviously.  Anyone does with the cap in place.  But I think his image has been hurt more by the team he was on then his own performance.  Thus, moving to a better team, like Calgary, would allow him to contribute in a big way."
CalgaryFlames,3bnar4,lancemeszaros,2,Tue Jun 30 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"Lmao ""possession"" is a fucking buzzword you idiot.   There's a reason every team he has been on has been happy to get rid of him. IIRC he was on the 4th line amd benched multiple times in Carolina.  He is insanely talented but has major motivation issues and a victim complex."
CalgaryFlames,3bnar4,catsfive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"Last season at 5-on-5, Carolina took 55.89% of all shot attempts when Semin was on the ice, compared to 52.76% when Semin was off the ice.  For unblocked shot attempts, it was 54.59% on, 52.22% off.  For scoring chances (high danger shots on goal) it was 54.44% on, 52.4% off.  And when Semin was on the ice, Carolina scored 45.31% of the goals, versus 40.52% when he's off the ice.  In other words, in every measurable sense the Hurricanes were a better team when Semin was on the ice.  This is measurable, this is a skill.     But wait, you ask, what if it's just his teammates?  Well we can look at that too.  Jeff Skinner was his most common teammate on the ice; Carolina had 57.5% of the shot attempts when Skinner and Semin were both on the ice, but only 54.8% when Skinner was on the ice without Semin.  Same with is next common teammate Ron Hainsey: 56.5% with Semin, 55.5% without.  Justin Faulk was even at 55.8% each.  In fact, of all of Semin's teammates who played at least 200 minutes 5-on-5 with him, only Eric Staal had better numbers away from Semin: 53.9% with and 56.7% without.  Skinner, Hainsey, Nash and Liles all benefited from having Semin on the ice with them, and as mentioned Faulk was even.  4-1-1 sounds good to me.     So why wasn't Carolina a better team? Because 5-on-5 they had a team shooting percentage of 6.2%, which was second-last in the league.  Semin can't change whether or not his teammates score or whether the opposing goalie makes a save.  They also had a 5-on-5 team save percentage of 90.9%, tied with Dallas for second-last in the league.  Semin can't change whether or not his team's goalies can save the puck.  He can do his best to deny the opposing team shot attempts and give his team as many chances as he can and that's what he did.  That's what it means to drive possession.  That's the skillset that Semin has, and we can observe and measure it.     So why is Carolina looking to dump him?  Maybe it's because he's a $7 mil cap hit for three more years.  I can agree with that line of thinking; he does drive possession but he's not an elite player and probably doesn't deserve a $7 mil cap hit, but at the same time that's their own fault for signing him to that.  Maybe because he's already 30 years old and they want to get younger.  That's understandable, but not by itself a fault of Semin.  Maybe it's because he has lackluster personal stats at only 6 goals and 19 points, which are career lows.  Again understandable, though players who drive possession don't necessarily score a lot themselves, they give their teammates chances to score.  Plenty of legitimate reasons to buy him out even though he's a good player.  But also keep in mind that GMs aren't infallible.  If they were, Dougie Hamilton would still be a Bruin.     Give him a 2-3 year contract, that way if he doesn't pan out he's not that big a hit to the team going forward.  Hopefully for cheap; in hindsight I agree ~$5 mil would be high.  But if given the opportunity (i.e. not being on the 4th line or benched) he can certainly make the team better, especially on a team with a lack of depth on RW like Calgary.  Just understand that his skillset at this point in his career is a possesion driver who makes his linemates better without necessarily putting up goals himself.  You know, like Backlund."

CalgaryFlames,3blca0,Roughly6Owls,2,Tue Jun 30 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"Franson's a good possession d-man. Last season, he was arguably the best defenseman on Toronto, with good offensive skills.  His foot speed looked really poor at the end of last season and he struggled in Nashville, but I've also heard he was nursing an injury and he went from 20 minutes a night to 8, so it's not a surprise his point production dropped.  He's worth a lot of money, but I think he's going to have a lot of suitors, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him signed and overpriced come October."

If I'm reading the relevant CBA info correctly, they'd basically be a combined $4,516,666 cap hit if they're both buried, which is really, really hefty for two AHL players but it's not like they're starved for cap space right now.  Maybe bury Engelland, send Smid on a ""conditioning stint"" when he's healthy and keep Smid as the 7th D, assuming nobody will take either of them.  Diaz is a UFA so he's only relevant if they re-sign him."

If there is anything we learnt from Bruins is that you don't just pick up guys to win tomorow. You have to think about long term agreements with Johnny Hockey, Bennett, Monahan, Gio. 21m in cap space is large for now but 2017-2018 it'll be gone. I like where we are now, unless Franson isn't super expensive.   I might be just too worried. But Cody Franson more than 2.5 mil per year is troublesome, more than 4 mil is a bad deal possibly."
CalgaryFlames,3blca0,NewmanTheScofflaw,2,Tue Jun 30 04:22:03 2015 UTC,"Good thing about Franson is he's 27 now, so signing him to a 3-4 year contract should be fine.  He won't decline too much.  I do agree that they shouldn't break the bank for him, as tempting as it would be."

CalgaryFlames,3blca0,BN_Flames_Fan,2,Tue Jun 30 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"An interesting note to this --  Engelland has played RW in the past (on Pittsburgh), and achieved his half of goals in his career high season for goals (6...)  while there.  If he moves up to the 4th line RW/13th forward, our depth chart on defense looks like this:    LHD RHD    Giordano Brodie   Russell Hamilton   Smid Wideman   Schlemko (?) Nakladal   Wotherspoon Morrison    (And Diaz, maybe?). Additionally, we deepen our RW slot a little.  So, if we make that move, and split Giordano/Brodie so that Brodie actually plays on the left (dropping Smid off the depth chart, whether he's injured or not), I think we've got a good spot for Franson playing beside Brodie."

CalgaryFlames,3blap7,Roughly6Owls,2,Tue Jun 30 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to throw out names that I think we should take interest in. In no particular order.  Drew Stafford, Patrick Eaves (who is from Calgary), Jack Skille.  What do all of these guys have in common? They shoot right, and they play on the RW. I'm not saying we should sign them all, but these are good short term options - which also have potential to flourish into mid-range contracts.  This free agency pool is kind of lacking any star-power, kind of obvious when Frolik is one of the most coveted names.   These are guys I'd have no problem with us signing, as the price would likely be very feasible."
CalgaryFlames,3blap7,locoenchilada,2,Tue Jun 30 05:02:36 2015 UTC,"Jack Skille was actually on my list at one point -- the argument for picking him up was that he'd be much like an Erik Condra-style pick-up, cheap depth and a couple extra points... the problem is just that he's a worse version of Condra. Possessively average playing against 4th liners in Columbus, hasn't broken twenty points in his career, and played in the AHL as recently as last season. At least Condra consistently gets more than 15 points (four seasons in a row, if you pro-rate the 12 point lock-out season.  Patrick Eaves is... interesting. He made 650k last season, so he actually missed my net. He's been a borderline NHLer for like five seasons, playing in the AHL as recently as last season. But somehow he got to almost 30 points last season? AHLers who don't score. Possessively decent with playing at Frolik/MSL/Vermette levels of competition (though for less time)... I want to see a Dallas fan contribute here, get an eye test. Because Eaves looks like a great player... if you ignore the last four seasons before this one. I'll do some more research on him.  Here's the worries with Stafford, as one Winnipeg blogger put it.   There is some concerns though with Stafford's two-way numbers being nothing short of a catastrophe, even when singling out just his minutes as a Jet.   Ok, so this is exactly what we don't want -- we've got possession-poor forwards coming out of our ears.   What's even scarier is that underlying numbers indicate that Stafford's success last season is likely to regress next year.   Yeah. Read the full thing here at Jets nation -- Garret Hohl does some excellent analysis."
CalgaryFlames,3blap7,locoenchilada,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:50:22 2015 UTC,"Jack Skille was someone I mulled on for a while. I wasn't 100% sure whether or not I should put him down, for those reasons. He was sort of on the lesser side of my interest.  Eaves was a victim in Detroit, never really getting consistent play time - so I think it's hard to gauge how good he still is looking at those numbers. What I see from his numbers in Dallas, is this.   Eaves went to an offensively minded team in Dallas, throw anyone in that situation they're sure to put up points. But his responsibility with a +12 on a team that finished with a goal differential of 0, (257 for, 257 against) is intriguing.   With 27 points in 47 games, that translates into 47 points in 82 games, according to the math. Do I think Eaves can put up 47 points? Potentially, I see him peaking as a 30 point guy, which for 650k a season, is pretty attractive.  I see those points on Stafford, and that article outlines it very well. I felt that he was going to command too much money, and at that proposed cap hit of 3.3 mil, I don't really see him fitting with us."
CalgaryFlames,3blap7,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"Burke recently said something interesting: with free agents, it's not the price that hurts you, it's the term.  Right now, the Flames can afford the contracts of Engelland and Raymond on the books because they're far from a cap team. When the Flames' young stars start their next contracts, Engelland, Raymond, Jones, etc, will be gone or close to it.  The danger for the Flames is that if they sign a UFA now, the term may stretch into a time when cap space is at a premium. UFAs are nearly universally inefficient when it comes to cost versus performance. The Flames won't be able to afford dead weight on the books much longer.  The other thing Burke mentioned with regards to free agency is that they were looking for more muscle on the wings. As much as he likes Gaudreau, he thinks players like him play better with linemates who can crash and create space for them.  If Treliving is on the same page, this means the Flames free agent targets will be cheap, short-term, and heavy."
CalgaryFlames,3blap7,voteharvey,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:53:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid. I agree for the most part.   However, I am a little concerned about whether or not we can continue to score at the same pace that we did last year. I know we were among the best in the league, but that wasn't really because the team is an offensive juggernaut... it was because our entire top line had a year way above expectations, we got huge production from our D, and we got a lot of goals up and down the lineup from players that were not expected to score (or even make the team). I dunno if we are going to get such huge seasons repeated from all of our players again.  That being said, I'm hopeful that some of the other guys in the lineup continue to progress and help shoulder some of the load without us needing to bring in much from free agency. I'm just not sure that I'm ready to believe that we won't need more offence.   Frolik: probably too $$$ Beleskey: unproven and probably too much $$$ + term for what you'd end up getting I think Williams might be the most interesting, but only if we can get him with short term (2 or 3 years) and for 4-5M. I hadn't really considered Erat, but for the right price he could be worth taking a look at. Could definitely help fill that 2/3 RW gap. Something like 3Mx2 would be solid. Hope BT takes your advice and looks into this. Ward seems like he would be a good fit, but would only want him for a couple years. Don't want to sign anyone to big retirement term contracts. He had a good numbers last season which may make him too $$$ anyway unfortunately. I like the idea of Condra on a 1yr deal with basically zero risk. Provides some injury insurance and even if he is a bust and sits it doesn't matter. I would be tempted to take a flyer on Semin (or Richards?) but only if we could pick him up on a 1yr deal. No loss if he doesn't work out, and best case scenario he either contributes a little to help spark the second line or gets flipped at the deadline for a freeroll draft pick.  Maybe a cheap 1yr for somebody like Parenteau wouldn't be bad either. Boyes is also really interesting. Unless there is some weird reason behind his buyout, he would be high on my interest list at under 3M"
CalgaryFlames,3blap7,teckhz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"So, let's talk about defensemen. Honestly, the defensive crop this season is actually not terrible, despite people complaining about it -- 1st pairing guys almost never make free agency anyway, so we can't complain about the lack of those guys.   The Flames are in an interesting position (especially now, with the rumours of Franson) where we've got five guys who can play more than 20 minutes a night (Russell/Wideman/Hamilton/Giordano/Brodie) -- our blueline is fucking stacked. With Wotherspoon and Nakladal being waiver-eligible (assuming Nakladal plays a single NHL-game), in addition to Smid and Engelland possibly sitting on the blue line, we've got a log-jam happening right now. Honestly, not a bad situation, but it does mean we need to think about acquiring UFAs.  Let's go back to that possession chart -- this time we've got every defenseman who made more than 700k, except for some names near the bottom who are new UFAs cause guess who didn't get qualified (Hi, Sena Acolaste)!  No real stand-outs, lots of clutter. Schlemko and Diaz are both noticeable as blue circles down there at the bottom... Again, lets take out the guys who'll never play again: Ballard (concussion issues), Gonchar (ancient... surprising number of guys who I removed for being 37+), Regehr (retiring), Fistric (performance based buyout), Ellerby/Conor Allen (outliers because they played less than five games), Souray (LTIR after a career ending wrist problem), etc., and we're also going to add our guys (Brodie, Hamilton, Giordano, Wideman, Russell, Smid, Engelland) to the chart.  So, now we're left with something like this -- I didn't spend as much time as I would've liked researching the less well-known names here, but we can see some important points:   Sekera, Franson are being valued for a reason -- they're possessively better than Oduya while playing in similar deployments, and they're four years younger -- Franson could be signed to a league maximum contract (term) and still be younger than a lot of the free agents hanging around. Zbynek Michalek and Barret Jackman have some tough deployment and perform well there. Both worth looking at, especially if Franson/Sekera are gone. Schlemko and Diaz are the best third pairing guys here. Other interesting choices, primarily for depth at low-value: Andre Benoit, Mark Barberio, Matt Irwin, John Moore, Yannick Weber. Any of these names should cost less than 1.5m, and some of them should cost less than 1m."

CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,locoenchilada,3,Mon Jun 29 20:45:48 2015 UTC,Nice! Thank you.
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,superdude99,4,Mon Jun 29 20:45:56 2015 UTC,If Hamilton isn't QO'd we riot! I'm not concerned whatsoever though.
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,gottabekb,3,Mon Jun 29 20:48:37 2015 UTC,Weird I thought that ramage would get a qo after he played the last game of the season. I guess he became expendable over the past few days
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,teckhz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:15:25 2015 UTC,The past few days didn't make him expendable. He was expendable because they don't think he will ever be good enough to make the roster.
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,gottabekb,4,Mon Jun 29 21:24:32 2015 UTC,You still need to fill out your ahl and echl roster and I thought he really picked up his game
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,teckhz,2,Mon Jun 29 22:03:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I agree with you. That's why he isn't expendable just because we have more defenseman. Clearly management thought he had no future here."

CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,AudioJunki,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"Can someone give me a brief description of a QO, I understand we propose a contract but what terms, minimum money, etc. Thankfulness"
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,locoenchilada,9,Mon Jun 29 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"A player who is no longer considered to be entry-level, but does not qualify as an unrestricted free agent, becomes a restricted free agent when his contract expires. A player may only declare himself to be an unrestricted free agent if he is over the age of 27 or has played in the league for a minimum of 7 years. Qualifying offers  The current team must extend a ""qualifying offer"" to a restricted free agent to retain negotiating rights to that player. Qualifying offers are for one year contracts. The minimum salary for the qualifying offer depends on the player's prior year salary.  Players who earned less than $660,000 in the previous season must be offered 110 percent of last season's salary. Players making up to $1 million must be offered 105 percent. Players making over $1 million must be offered 100 percent.   If the qualifying offer is not made, the player becomes an unrestricted free agent. If the player rejects a qualifying offer, he remains a restricted free agent. If the player does not sign before December 1, he is ineligible to play in the NHL for the remainder of the season.   Possible outcomes  If a player accepts a qualifying offer, he then signs a one-year contract with his current team under the terms of the offer. If the player rejects the qualifying offer, or has not yet accepted it he is able to negotiate offer sheets with other teams. Qualifying offers are required for a team to retain a player's rights, but in most cases the player and team will agree to a contract differing from the qualifying offer. Should the player sign an offer sheet with another team, his current team is notified and can no longer negotiate a new contract or trade the player rights to another team. The current team has 7 days to make a decision whether to match the offer sheet, or decline and receive draft pick compensation from the team making the offer sheet.   Accept The player remains with his current team on a contract identical to that of the offer sheet. With the exception that the current team does not have to match any clauses restricting their ability to trade or reassign the player like a ""no trade clause"". The team is not allowed to trade the player for one year. Decline The player becomes a member of the team with whom he signed the offer sheet under all the terms of said offer sheet. His now former team claims draft picks from the player’s new team as compensation. Compensatory draft picks are determined by the player’s new salary on a sliding scale.   For example:   In 2008 a team that signed a restricted free agent to a salary averaging $2,615,625 to $3,923,437 per season lost a first-round draft pick and a third-round draft pick to the player’s former team. Signing a restricted free agent to a contract worth over $6,539,062 per year costs a team four first-round draft picks.   At any point during the negotiation process, if the player has been in the NHL for longer than 4 years (less if the player signed his first contract after the age of 20), either the player or his current team may file for salary arbitration as a means of settling a contract dispute. At this point the player may no longer sign an offer sheet. The deadline to file for salary arbitration is July 5 with cases being heard between late July and early August.   Salary Arbitration. Both the player and his current team submit their expectations for the player's salary for the coming year. The team cannot request a reduction in salary of greater than 15%. The arbitrator hears the case from both player and team and renders a verdict. The verdict sets the salary the team is required to pay the player. After the arbitrator's verdict is rendered, the team must make a decision within 48 hours of the verdict being rendered. If the team accepts, the player is signed to a new contract at the salary set in the verdict. Should the team decline, the player then becomes an unrestricted free agent.   A team can take a player to arbitration once in his career. Players may request salary arbitration as often as they please."
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,SgtFinnish,2,Mon Jun 29 21:11:09 2015 UTC,That was coherent and informative. Thank you.
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,FalsePerm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:45:41 2015 UTC,"Equal to their salary made last season.   Different than aav, if a player was on a 3 year 875000, 875000, 900000. Then to qualify you'd have to offer them the 1 year 900000.   It gets to be a bad thing to qualify when a players qualifying would be more than they are worth."
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,AudioJunki,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"That was amazing, thank you. When we make these offers are we just expecting one year? Or did we potentially offer Hamilton a proper contract?"
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,FalsePerm,2,Mon Jun 29 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Qualifying offers are usually just to hold your rights. They are only worth 1 year, if a player accepts it. It also affects ufa eligibility so they can get a little complicated.   Teams usually qualify a player just so they have more time to negotiate a proper contract. That's when other teams can come in past July 1st and offer sheet the player. If they accept the offer sheet you get compensation, but that's only because you qualified the player in the first place. If you didn't qualify the player by July 1st they become a ufa."
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"We offered Hamilton a contract, but it was a one-year contract worth the 105% of his last year of his last contract (he made 832 500, so we offered him 875 000). He'll sign for more than that."
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,Dshens,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:19:26 2015 UTC,Any idea when we will start to see numbers?
CalgaryFlames,3bjqyy,Rooster697,5,Mon Jun 29 21:28:15 2015 UTC,There are no numbers yet. We'll see them when the players sign their contracts

CalgaryFlames,3bj19p,minikyle,8,Mon Jun 29 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to think Sweeney ""didn't fully know how offer sheets work""."
CalgaryFlames,3bj19p,rpawson5771,0,Mon Jun 29 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"Feaster didn't cough O'Reilly cough. I know its a different situation, but since offer sheets are so rare, and he has only been on the job for a couple months, you could make a case that he doesn't know every detail. Meanwhile Burke has been on the receiving end of an offer sheet (Penner to EDM from ANA) and had that insight."
CalgaryFlames,3bj19p,Dramon,13,Mon Jun 29 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"Feaster's offer sheet was after a brand new CBA was written up and the wording was confusing as hell. Amendments were made BECAUSE of that potential fuck up to avoid future confusion. But no one seems to take that into consideration and multiple GM's later (as in, during the summer of that season) and said they read it and interpretted it the same way Feaster did."
CalgaryFlames,3bj19p,rpawson5771,2,Mon Jun 29 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, and the wording is complicated, and I'm not hating on Feaster, I liked Feaster. Just saying sometimes you don't know every rule, or you interpret things differently than others and the O'Reilly Offer sheet was an example."
CalgaryFlames,3bj19p,Waldo76,2,Mon Jun 29 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"You're kind of assuming both sides don't know how offer sheets work though. Because of that calculation, there's really no reason for any team to extend an offer sheet longer than five years, unless they're comfortable with the bump in compensation going the other way."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,Waldo76,7,Tue Jun 30 00:28:15 2015 UTC,"Stajan is really our third line, has been for a while.  I'd also put Arnold above Reinhart in Stockton."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,fknSamsquamptch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"I put stajan on the checking/energy line which is traditionally the 4th. But you right, in terms of TOI I would imagine his line would be higher than Shore's.  As for Stockton, I think you may be right there. Arnold really is a better 2 way player than Reinhart."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,fknSamsquamptch,2,Tue Jun 30 01:03:15 2015 UTC,"I think Reinhart is a AAAA player (meaning generally too good for the minors but not good enough for the pros).  I don't think he has the tools to be an effective bottom six guy, and I am 99% sure he won't be a top six guy.  Arnold, like you said, is a good two-way player (strong on faceoffs, which the Flames could really use) and seems to have chemistry with whomever he plays with (from Gaudreau to Wolf).  I think Arnold is 4C in Calgary in less than two years."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,Buksey,6,Tue Jun 30 01:09:17 2015 UTC,I think Nakladal starts in the AHL. Right now he is waiver exempt till he plays an NHL game. It makes more sense (barring a crazy good training camp) to have him in the minors while he gets accustomed to the differences in the NHL game (smaller ice etc).
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:29:07 2015 UTC,Sometimes you get guys who can make the jump right away (Soderberg) -- I think there's a chance (call it less than 20%) that Nakladal's in Calgary at the start of the season.
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,peanuts421,2,Wed Jul 1 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"A fourth might be a lot for bollig. I'd take a half a two six of jd for him, just get that cash off the books."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,teckhz,3,Tue Jun 30 00:43:19 2015 UTC,I'll chug half a two six of JD to get him off the books.
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,chodes_r_us,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:04:52 2015 UTC,I mean he's making 1.25 million. I'm perfectly fine letting him sit in the press box for that price and have him fight Lucic a couple of times a year.  The real problem is that Engelland contract..... Man that thing sucks especially considering if we had him off the books a legitimate run at Franson would make sense
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,SgtFinnish,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:38:46 2015 UTC,Maybe Sweeney needs another tough guy?
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,rpawson5771,3,Tue Jun 30 13:13:01 2015 UTC,I have no idea what the lines will look like. I expect Bennett will be given every opportunity to play center. I'm not sure if Shore is a regular every day player. I'm not sure if Raymond makes the cut ahead of Jooris or Bollig.    It will be fun to see this sort itself out at camp. Another competitive camp to set up another competitive season. Is it September yet??
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,blink0r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"I could see the flames getting rid of Raymond to make room for other players,   absolutely."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,Rooster697,2,Tue Jun 30 17:39:34 2015 UTC,I think you have our AHL and ECHL teams mixed up
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,Rooster697,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:32:29 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? Roster wise? Or team Names? From what I understand, our new AHL team is Stockton heat, while the Adirondack Thunder have been made our ECHL team."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,Rooster697,5,Tue Jun 30 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"Isn't the Calder Cup the AHL trophy? Also, how does sending AHL players to the ECHL add depth to the AHL team? These things confused me"
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,rpawson5771,3,Tue Jun 30 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Your right! I missed the mistake, corrected it thank you! Stockton will compete for the Calder!  As for ECHL adding depth, its just like how the AHL adds depth for the Flames. If we have an injury we call up a player from the AHL to replace him. Doing this caused our AHL team to fall out of the players last year since they had no real depth chart themselves to be pulling quality charts from. Now they will be able to pull players in the flames system from the ECHL."

CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,winkylems,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"Now that we've added Frolik, I wonder if we could see  Gaudreau - Monahan - Hudler  Bouma - Backlund - Frolik  Raymond - Bennett - Poirier  Edit: Poirier is a right wing  Ferland - Stajan - Jones"
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,alivirji,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"These are my ideal lines (based on possession numbers and chemistry between players):  NHL:  Forward lines:  Gaudreau - Monahan - Hudler  Bennett - Backlund - Colborne   Ferland - Stajan - Jones/MayRay  Bouma - Jooris - Byron  Shore and Bollig as healthy scratches. Shore in particular needs to earn a spot like Jooris and Ferland did (not that he's had a proper chance yet, but he is still a rookie). Bollig will be a regular scratch. Preferably one of Raymond or Jones are traded and the other takes the 3 RW spot.   Defensive pairings:  Gio - Hamilton   Brodie - Wideman   Russell - Schlemko   Engelland  Wotherspoon, Morrison and Nakladal have to earn their spots, there shouldn't be a spot waiting for them. If they make a strong push for a spot, then we can trade one of our veteran dmen. Also, the top 5 are pretty fluid.   Goalies:  AHL:  Forward lines:  Klimchuk - Granlund - Poirier  Agostino - Arnold - Smith   Wolf - Reinhart - Carroll  Elson - Marcotte - Hathaway  Defensive pairings:  Wotherspoon - Morrison   Kylington - Nakladal  Culkin - Kulak  Cundari  Kanzig and Sieloff can take take top line minutes in the ECHL.   Goalies:  Gillies  Carr   I think that this gives us some great organizational depth at almost every position. The only think we need is a top 6 RW. Also, we should ship out MayRay, Jones and/or Wideman to make room for a top 6 RW FA (Stewart, Stafford, Frolik , Hodgson or PAP) and make room for rookies throughout the year (particularly in Wideman's case)."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,chodes_r_us,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:06:39 2015 UTC,I say leave Kylington in Sweden for at least 1 year. Costs us absolutely nothing.
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,alivirji,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:41:30 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, but Hakan Loob (former Flame and Kylington's team's president of hockey ops) said that he should come to North America ASAP to get adjusted to the NA game, since he already definitely has the skill and size to compete in the AHL. It makes sense for his development."
CalgaryFlames,3bkohz,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:45:56 2015 UTC,Personally I think Jones is way better than MayRay especially if you look at possession numbers since MayRay is a possession black hole. The problem is that Raymond has a no trade clause so he's not going anywhere.  Those signings last summer Treliving made are looking pretty bad now (except for Hiller). God I wish we hadn't signed Engelland for that much. It'd make more sense to go after Franson now if he Engelland wasnt on the books but if we sign Franson were going to have one expensive d core...
CalgaryFlames,3bl7wq,Mikcaxi,5,Tue Jun 30 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"I agree.  What I hope is tomorrow we see Ramo's rights traded to San Jose (or someone) for a conditional middle pick.   Hiller and Ortio can duke it out for No1 spot, and Hartley can play the hot hand again. Depending on Hiller's play we can; dump him at the trade deadline, resign him for another short deal or see what FAs are available next season.   Ideal situation for me. Hiller plays ok and traded, Ortio wins starting role, and we trade/waiver a serviceable back up."
CalgaryFlames,3bl7wq,Buksey,2,Tue Jun 30 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"No point in trading for Ramos rights, he's UFA on Wednesday."
CalgaryFlames,3bl7wq,skankyspanky,2,Tue Jun 30 04:53:09 2015 UTC,"A team like San Jose that saw all the best goalie options get traded or sign might be willing to trade for an extra day of negotiations.   I could've seen a trade like, he doesn't sign we get nothing but if he signs for 4+ years we get a 3/4 rounder."
CalgaryFlames,3bl7wq,Buksey,7,Tue Jun 30 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"We ARE keeping Hiller and letting Ramo walk.   At this point I really don't see them signing Ramo.  He, suddenly becomes the best FA goalie out there, though."
CalgaryFlames,3bl7wq,marbsarebad,2,Tue Jun 30 03:18:33 2015 UTC,This is what makes sense to me. Just don't see the benefit to trading Hiller for a low pick and keeping Ramo.  Thats not an upgrade.
CalgaryFlames,3bl7wq,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"No, you're not. There's a lot of people who 'feel' like Ramo was the better goalie, the more clutch goalie, etc., or that Hiller lets softies in, and that because of that the Flames should be selling Hiller for peanuts, but the stats just don't really back that up."

CalgaryFlames,3biv0e,Aplicado,2,Mon Jun 29 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"I've told this story a few times on /r/calgaryflames, but I might as well do it again.  It was a Flames/Hawks game five or so years ago.  Me and my roommates decided to PPV it (you had to at the time).  Like one minute into the game our feed goes black, we're all pissed.  I go to my laptop and start streaming some garbage quality stream in my room.  Flames quickly build up a 4-0 (I think, might've been 5-0).  The feed clicks back on right near the end of the first, and Chicago immediately scores.  End of period, time for FlamesTV fluff intermission piece.  This time, it is on Conroy's family.  And thus, the legend of Conroy's smoking hot wife was born in our house.  I think three of us saw it, and we all were claiming to everyone else that she was an absolute knockout.  The Shithawks slowly came back into the game and beat us.  We saw every single Hawks goal on the big screen, but missed every Flames goal.  We were pissed.  Afterwards, everyone else wanted proof of Conny's wife's babe-itude.  A couple weeks later I found the clip on the Flames' wobsite and everyone agreed.  Moral of the story is that Conny's wife being a natural 10 made the Phaneuf rumours that much more intriguing (considering Phaneuf looks like a troll)."

CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,Frightenstein,7,Tue Jun 30 00:49:47 2015 UTC,"Are you comfortable with Ramo as a number 1? He can be pretty inconsistent and Ortio hasn't proven himself yet, but I do think he deserves a good look this year."

CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds a little bit like you're just trying to confirm your bias...  Here's Hiller's Hextally chart over the last two seasons. Red is bad, blue is good. Grey is league average. Here's Ramo's.  One of those guys (the Swiss one) is statistically above average in medium and high danger areas and average for low danger shots. The other one is basically the picture perfect league average goaltender. Maybe Hiller gives up easy goals, but that means he's performing way better than Ramo everywhere else to still come out ahead statistically."
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,Shanghai1943,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:48:39 2015 UTC,"and Hiller's rebounding control, shoot me pls"
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,Chronixx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"Hiller lets in soft goals. Honestly I feel like they're just as good as one another, but Ramo is younger and has room for improvement."
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,BootRacer,5,Mon Jun 29 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"We will probably keep Hiller because he has more experience. Considering we have two young goaltenders (Joni Orito and Jon Gillies) that need mentoring I see us keeping Hiller. Hiller has played 385 games compared to Ramo's 129.   On the flip side I do want to see Ramo stay, he is a great goaltender and I'd like to see them give him another shot this year. Hopefully they can make a deal."
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,WeightOfTheheNewYear,3,Mon Jun 29 22:08:11 2015 UTC,Ramo isn't a fresh chicken though. He's played in different leagues and is a veteren player. And has really adapted to his role in Calgary.
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,BootRacer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:55:36 2015 UTC,"True, and I'm not doubting his ability, I'd like to keep him best case scenario. However realistically I see BT and crew keeping Hiller over Ramo because Hiller is signed for another year"
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,AKAdyje,4,Tue Jun 30 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"If Glencross fetched a 2nd halfway through the year his contract was up, Hiller can undoubtedly retrieve more than a 6th. I'd say a 3rd at worst."
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,yodude19,2,Mon Jun 29 19:55:05 2015 UTC,"Hiller is a decent #1 goalie, he isnt worth a player with minimal chance of making the NHL, in maybe 5 years time. Not an even trade."
CalgaryFlames,3bjhmj,SgtFinnish,0,Mon Jun 29 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"I think he'd fetch more then a 6th personally. I'd rather have Ramo, he's younger and has more upside."
CalgaryFlames,3bjc1p,bsellis14,4,Mon Jun 29 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"Hodgson, PAP and Stewart (yea, I know he wasn't bought out) are all decent options to fill the 2RW role. Of course, this is only if they are signed to cheap deals. They all have pretty good upside."
CalgaryFlames,3bjc1p,alivirji,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"I guess it just depends what they're looking for, whether its a veteran presence for the playoffs or another young guy with some potential."

A 26 year old right-hand shot who has never scored less than 37 points (even in the lockout season), on a potenitally low-cost/short-term deal is a steal. Oilers history be damned.  Throw him on the wing, see how he does."
CalgaryFlames,3bjc1p,Kellervo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:27:39 2015 UTC,Where does he fit in our lines?
CalgaryFlames,3bjc1p,theFlamingRaven,5,Mon Jun 29 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"He's a terrible C - poor in the dot, not the greatest defensively - but I could see him being a solid winger. He's good for 40 points even put with poor linemates and really isn't that dreadful (case in point - he had the second highest SAT-Rel on Arizona).  His development has been completely derailed but at this point he'd probably be a cheap alternative in case we miss out on Frolik."

His most common linemates were, in order, Zdeno Chara, Patrice Bergeron, Reilly Smith, Brad Marchand, Carl Soberberg, Loui Eriksson, Milan Lucic and Dennis Seidenberg. If you’re expecting the Flames out to outshoot the opposition badly just because they’ve picked up Hamilton, and not all those other guys, you’re in for a disappointment.   Yah, but still...."

CalgaryFlames,3bfabg,Roughly6Owls,6,Mon Jun 29 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"Treliving called Boston as soon as the season was over and stayed in touch with the Bruins, which eventually led to trade talks really heating up on Thursday and Friday.   You've got to be impressed with how Treliving put in the work long before the trade was put together. This wasn't a seat-of-the-pants move, but something they had planned and worked towards since before the trade deadline when they traded for extra picks as trade capital."
CalgaryFlames,3bfabg,fknSamsquamptch,5,Mon Jun 29 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"Going further, his deadline work to acquire picks (currency, as he described them) was the real groundwork for the deal.  I was not impressed after last year's draft, but pretty much since then he has been lights out."

CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,gaganminhas,10,Sun Jun 28 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"If we signed Oduya we would have a veritable log jam at defence, which would be great imo. We'd be able to run 3 lines for the entire game:  Giordano -  Brodie  Oduya -  Hamilton  Russell - Wideman"
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Rooster697,18,Sun Jun 28 19:03:47 2015 UTC,Would we play a goalie at that point?
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,SgtFinnish,8,Sun Jun 28 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"Oduya's a defensive stud, I just think he'll be too expensive for what he'll be bringing to the table: two time stanley cups as a top-4 blueliner is a pretty impressive resume that's matched by only a few players in the league right now. Combine this with fitting awkwardly in the depth chart, and I just don't see why we wouldn't pursue better options.  He's left handed, so he'll be behind Giordano, but definitely in front of Russell. In this timeline, we likely play Brodie with Giordano just like last season (because otherwise the left side is even more crowded), so our depth chart looks like this:    Left Defense Right Defense    Giordano Brodie   Oduya Hamilton   Russell Wideman   Smid (?) Engelland   Wotherspoon Nakladal    This assumes we don't retain Schlemko. Nakladal can be in the AHL until plays a single NHL game, at which point he becomes waiver-eligible. Wotherspoon starts the season waiver-eligible, so he's either the 7th man or in the pressbox all season.  This means we'll have have some combination of Wideman (5.25), Smid (3.5), Engelland (2.92), and Russell (2.8) as our bottom pair. That's 14.5 million dollars, almost 20% of the cap, sitting in the bottom of our defense chart, with only the smallest of those four salaries coming off the books next off-season (also probably the least desirable... Russell).  Obviously Smid being on LTIR could fix this a little, but 11 million is still 15% of the cap tied into guys who're either in the pressbox or playing 12 minutes a night.  So, considering our top pair is making ~8m, Hamilton's likely making 6.5 or so, and Oduya's 100% making at least 5m, we're looking at a conservative estimate of about 34 million to tie up our defense, with Giordano looking at an almost 100% raise next season. That's just not feasible (I'll check what other teams D-cores cost when I get back, if there's desire)."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Roughly6Owls,4,Sun Jun 28 20:34:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, $34 million in defense would be absurd. By comparison, here's what the most expensive d-cores cost.     Team Cost     $28,150,000    $26,707,142    $25,925,000    $22,150,000    All these teams have 6 defensemen signed, except for Vancouver, who have 5."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,trent-henderson,2,Mon Jun 29 02:52:24 2015 UTC,"And that 34 million doesn't include Wotherspoon/Nakladal's salary at the moment either.  Anyway, thanks for doing that!  If we're looking at signing a defenseman from free agency any more, we have to drop the cap hits of two of Wideman, Smid, or Engelland, whether that's by trade or LTIR. Even dropping Smid and Engelland and replacing them with one Oduya-level guy would have us looking at around 30m for seven defensemen."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Roughly6Owls,2,Mon Jun 29 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, Smid and Engelland costing nearly $7 million is a giant anchor for the team. It's a good thing the Flames aren't near the cap this year or they'd have to explore offering picks to the Coyotes to take them off their hands.  I wonder how injured Smid actually is, or whether it's possible for the team to agree to keep paying him to stay on LTIR. He came back from the IR for a few games in January then mysteriously left for the rest of the season."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Newtothisredditbiz,3,Mon Jun 29 03:59:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Smid and Engelland have some pretty bad contracts.  Smid'll play if he's medically cleared to, so it depends on how he recovers from his vertebrae surgery -- that being said, I've seen estimates (only from this sub, mind you) that put his recovery time at 6-9 months post-op."

CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Roughly6Owls,7,Mon Jun 29 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"I would love to get Oduya, but only if we can somehow get rid of Egghead or Smid. Otherwise, we'll be paying about $6.4 million to two guys to sit in the press box for two seasons."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,trent-henderson,2,Sun Jun 28 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with that kind of defensive depth, we can afford it, and I also think getting them off the cap is easy enough. Send them down- if you're not worrying about them getting picked off on waivers, who cares?  There's very little UFA action in terms of forwards, I hope that Treliving seriously goes after Oduya or Sekera."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,jeffwhit,4,Sun Jun 28 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"Sending them down would save the team about $1.9M ($4.5M cap hit vs. $6.4M) in cap space, while still paying out $6.75M in actual salary. Probably a tough pill to swallow for ownership."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,rpawson5771,6,Mon Jun 29 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"If we sign Oduya, Kylington wouldn't get any more time with him than he would now, given that Kylington is bound to stay in Sweden for at least one more season, if not two or more.    If the Flames want to sign Oduya for other reasons, then by all means. But the Kylington angle shouldn't factor in."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,rpawson5771,3,Sun Jun 28 19:56:37 2015 UTC,I would say a top six winger should be our priority at this point. When we are able to move Eng and Smid then maybe we can pick up another defensemen. That is assuming prospects aren't ready to come up and start contributing.
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Waldo76,2,Mon Jun 29 00:29:47 2015 UTC,"I like the Idea of adding depth and experience with a UFA but I think Oduya might not be best suited with Calgarys approach to a d-core that's able to jump into the rush, offensive zone cycles, and wheeling the puck on the rush. He could however be the safe man back on any pair but I think that's taking away from last years productive mentality on the back end."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,bikinistealer,6,Sun Jun 28 19:32:59 2015 UTC,Oduya's spent his entire career covering for Seabrook or Keith's pinches -- he can definitely do it for Wideman.  Him fitting into our system isn't so much of a problem.
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Roughly6Owls,2,Sun Jun 28 20:22:02 2015 UTC,I kinda get what your saying but he would really help the PK
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"He doesn't put up points, but he can skate very well, which is more than you can say for Engelland."
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,LouisV_,2,Sun Jun 28 19:36:23 2015 UTC,Under two conditions:  1 - we sign a top 6 right winger first  2 - he signs for cheaper than I think he's going to ask for
CalgaryFlames,3bfd3m,NewayZ,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"No. This is a ridiculous idea.  We have a good top six right now, even if we subtract Wideman. Gio is a number 1, Brodie and Hamilton also have the numbers to be number 1s.   Russell or Wideman (but hopefully Russell so we can dump some salary) will be the number 4, with a significantly better partner than last year (because, the one who falls to the second pairing is still arguably a number one).  Schlemko, Diaz, T'Spoon, et al. can be your 5, 6, and 7. Even Engelland or Smid won't do much damage down there (but I hope we get rid of their contracts, too). We still have other guys we picked up that we haven't even seen yet, Morrison and Nakladal.  What is most important right now, is not spending a billion dollars on another defenseman, but get a 2RW. That's now where the hole is. Oduya would be far too expensive."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,MattFiresideChat,19,Mon Jun 29 06:10:52 2015 UTC,No. We are getting into exactly the same trap we were in last time we were in this position circa 2006. We are signing veterans to plug holes that need to be plugged with young players. This is a young mans league more then ever and we should not be getting older but staying young. Leaving holes in the line up for rookies to step up and battle for. Our goal for next year should not and will not be to win the cup. It should be to start sifting through our prospects and keeping the ones who can make us better and shipping out the ones that are expendable. We should be looking to build upon our success this year by repeating it. Getting Hamilton doesn't bring us closer to winning a cup in the next two years but it brings us closer to repeating our success next year and building the team up for a competing for the cup In three. Hamilton sped the rebuild up by year. Not three.
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,WeightOfTheheNewYear,2,Mon Jun 29 06:32:51 2015 UTC,"In 2006, we were trading our future assets to fill holes and doing so poorly. Signing UFAs wasn't the problem.  We can afford to sign a free agent, we just have to make sure that they're not going to jeopardize our ability to retain young talent in the future. Smart free agency acquisitions are a part of being a successful club.  That being said, I really disagree with who we're discussing here -- I think we need to be looking at more budget options so that our cap space can continue to be an asset instead of a barrier to making trades work."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,Roughly6Owls,10,Mon Jun 29 06:55:12 2015 UTC,"Martin St. Louis   God please no. We're still rebuilding, not that close yet. No need to go after a grandfather who'll be retired when we actually become competitive."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,lcfiretruck,2,Mon Jun 29 06:33:44 2015 UTC,I'd support that if it's A million or less a year. He could be invaluable to Johnny Hockeys development.
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,Thumper17,2,Mon Jun 29 06:41:34 2015 UTC,"less than A million a year for St. Louis? You're dreaming dude. His cap hit was 5.6mil last year, even considering that it's going to be a new contract off free agency there's zero chance he's that cheap."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,lcfiretruck,2,Mon Jun 29 08:21:24 2015 UTC,"He's 40 and he may have gotten 52 points, but in seasons prior he was in the 80's. He still has a few years in him, but those years aren't worth 5.6 mil.   The highest offer he could possibly get is 3 mil, and that's from a team eager to hit the cap floor."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,Thumper17,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:32:51 2015 UTC,Lol its free agency. People get paid an absurd amount. A 50 pt scorer is definitely gonna get 5 mil a year. He might even get a raise for a year or two
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,chodes_r_us,2,Mon Jun 29 13:15:51 2015 UTC,How so?  To me he's a washed up player who completely abandoned his teammates in Tampa.  I don't want that kind of player/person to have any kind of impact on our young guys.
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,Rideyn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:01:17 2015 UTC,"First, he's coming off a 52 point season, hardly a washup, especially on our second line.  Second, He knows how to play in the league as a small player. A veteran influence is always awesome, but a veteran that has that experience with your own issues is worth much more then that.   If they don't give St.Louis some sort of offer then I'll be extremely surprised."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,Thumper17,3,Mon Jun 29 07:31:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I'd be extremely surprised if he even gets looked at by us.  He doesn't fit in with our team at all, we don't need more veteran leadership and he would just take a roster spot away from one of our young kids that needs the experience."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,Rideyn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"This is a totally silly conversation. If St. Louis could be signed even for one year at a reasonable price, it is an absolute, 100% no-brainer YES. Even if he only played 10 minutes per game, what he could do in the locker room would be positively epic. As it is, St. Louis has already reached out to Johnny and even had dinner with the kid. We've got so many young players that St. Louis would be the perfect guy. You'd never want to disappoint either Gio or St. Louis being out partying."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,catsfive,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:52:45 2015 UTC,I'm confused. The Flames aren't competitive now? Note I don't want to sign St. Louis but just wondering what you think competitive entails.
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,CuggyofHouseAbby,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:20:33 2015 UTC,competitive as in able to compete for the stanley cup.
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,lcfiretruck,5,Mon Jun 29 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"I rather we try to build a team that competes for a decade than might compete for the next two seasons. Plus, don't forget the cap issues. I think we are done with big signings if we want to avoid losing guys we can't afford next year. The rest goes down to development and coaching. Also nothing in the ufa market is interesting all are okay and will cost too much not because they are hot but because after a hot draft everyone is in a frenzy to bid up prices. I like things how they are I want to see Emilie Porier or other recent top picks make it through and develop into a franchise player than get an expensive veteran under a 2 year contract before they retire and end up costing us a young possible franchise player. Just look at the position Boston, Pittsburg, LA are in. We are in the cap era my friend, the cap is God."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,NewmanTheScofflaw,2,Mon Jun 29 06:53:24 2015 UTC,"Some questions I'd like to see you answer:    in what timeline do you think Oduya isn't going to be ridiculously over-priced as the most successful (in terms of hardware) UFA defenseman hitting the market this season?  Similarly, what indications do you have that Michael Frolik won't be overpriced, considering he's priced himself out of negotiations with Winnipeg? (I'm not so sold on Martin as far as over-pricing goes either: Petry set the bar really high and I think MTL overpaid to have some piece of mind.) Different question, with a similar outcome: why do you want Stafford or St. Louis? Stafford's a possession catastrophe (though not as bad as Stewart), St. Louis' isn't much better... but he's also getting older and time's bound to hit him hard at some point.   We need to have money under the cap to sign our core (Gaudreau/Monahan, Gio, possibly Hudler, all due for raises) this time next year. That's priority number one -- without those guys, we're back to 2009. Having cap flexibility afterwards (i.e. not using our space just because we have it right now) is an asset that we should be loathe to give up -- otherwise we're a bad contract or two from being in cap hell with Boston (Hamilton v. the other slots on their roster) or Chicago (Saad v. Sharp) problems. We can't just go hard and overpay for a free agent without also dumping some of our worse contracts -- you've identified this as being a problem, but I don't think your targets are actually realistic with regards to over-pricing (or actually filling the need we have). I think we could afford to overpay one guy, but only if we got rid of some of our more offensive contracts -- Engelland's is front and centre here in my opinion.  I don't have time right now, but tomorrow I'll pull up a list of free agents that I think could actually fill that middle-6 RW slot and not be over-priced (other than Justin Williams, who I think is a good choice if he's not signed longer term than 3 or 4 years). I don't think our defensive problem is actually much of a problem, and I can talk about that as well."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,Roughly6Owls,2,Mon Jun 29 06:58:35 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.   With Oduya, everything would come down to term, which is part of the reason why I listed 4 guys. There likely could be another 5-6 options as well. For me, I don't want to break the chemistry of Brodie/Gio and Wideman/Russell because they work really well together, and I don't like the idea of Engelland being the #4. Worst case is that all the UFA D-men that would be upgrades are looking for too much term or too much dollars. In that case, you run with what you've got.   I think all of Stafford, St. Louis, Williams and Frolik will be overpaid as well. I don't like the idea of having Colborne as the 2nd line RW, but it's not a big deal if that's the case. If you can get a legit 2nd line RW, that would be better. Term is key in this situation because you don't want to block the kids either. That's why I suggested MSL as the best option because he would only want 1 year and is good for 50+ points (had 52 last year in 74 games)  Possession is a problem with both Stafford and St. Louis, but it isn't the end of the world. I know we aren't exactly desperate for offense having so many weapons at the ready, but you can never have enough talent in the playoffs.  The Flames currently have 21 million dollars in cap space, which will likely whittle down to 12 once RFA's Bouma, Hamilton and Shore are signed (2, 6, 1). After this season 8.5 million gets freed up from  Jones and Hiller. The crunch will happen with what to do with Raymond, Smid, Engelland and Stajan, which is another 12.75 that can be moved. It shouldn't be hard to dump their contracts like how the Flyers did with Grossman/Pronger for Gagner to buy out. And you can move Wideman's 5.5 and replace him with either Morrison or Spoon. Those dollars can easily go to Gio + Gaudreau + Monahan + Hudler. Gaudreau and Monahan will likely see an 8.5 million dollar increase in pay, along with a 3 mil increase to Hudler, and 3-4 for Gio. All in for those guys it's about 15 million, which is possible to afford just by losing Jones + Hiller along with 2 of Raymond Stajan Smid Engelland."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,mikesulls,2,Mon Jun 29 07:36:40 2015 UTC,"Free Agency is the worst time to sign players. The only moves I would make would be for depth players for for guys willing to take a 1-2 year contract. Most likely not going to happen. This is still a rebuild and we want to be competitive for years. Next year is a huge year for us in terms of signing players. We will most likely be a cap team in 1-2 years. We need to sign Hamilton Monahan, Gaudreau, Gio, and Bennett eventually. That would easily take up 30+ million in cap space defending on what kind of contracts we want to make.   I'd want to sign Frolik to 3 years but he would never go for that. Free Agency is a nightmare that I want no part of. Look at the players we added last summer who we can't wait to move (Engelland and Raymond). I'll pass on making big bids on players who will be extremely overpaid."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,TJYoshi,2,Mon Jun 29 07:42:51 2015 UTC,"The only other move I'd like to see this offseason is signing Williams. His possession stats show that he's a beast, and we need a RW."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,LouisV_,4,Mon Jun 29 07:59:35 2015 UTC,"Hamilton certainly makes us better, but I think you're jumping the gun. While the rebuild is running ahead of schedule, we are still in it and should keep that mind set.  The last thing we need is big contract veterans taking the roster spots from our prospect pool, it stimys growth in the system.  Signing Frolik, who's a Czech like Hudler coming off some career highs, would be a nice addition. I think the Jets will retain Stafford, and Oduya will ask for more cash than he's worth.  In the offseason, I'd like to sign a top 6 RW, add some depth to the roster in both ends (preferably right handed), ship smid or engelland, and look into the goaltending situation as I'm not 100% sold on Ortio and Hiller's playoff performance vs Anaheim has shaken my faith slightly.  I'm more than pleased with the rebuild so far, and am confident we will be a contender in the coming years.  In Treliving, we trust."
CalgaryFlames,3bhe3q,CuggyofHouseAbby,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:03:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure why some posters are clinging to the idea of a long-term, painful rebuild when that old plan, trajectory, is now obsolete. Monahan was not assumed to become a #1 C, 30-30 guy in his 2nd year. Our D was not expected to be the highest scoring group in the league. Treliving's worry at the start of last season was where goals were going to come from! Things are different and the plan needs to be updated to match reality.   O&G companies in Calgary aren't starting projects with expectation that they will earn $100/barrel anymore and the Flames aren't 3 freaking years away from being competitive.   There's buzz, not consensus but buzz, in the hockey world that we have the best D in the west. We have a lot of young, elite pieces that are producing now, on their ELCs. Seems to me the time is as good as any to capitalize on that early production. Not slowly plod along and sit on our hands while the core just gets more expensive. The rebuild ends when Monahan, Gaudreau, Gio get 6 mil+ contracts?"

CalgaryFlames,3bfxz4,Waldo76,2,Sun Jun 28 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"The reason why the Yotes made the Pronger trade is because it puts them closer to the salary floor without having to actually pay for his contract, since it was insured.  Engelland is actually making $250k more in salary than his cap hit because of how his signing bonus is structured.  He won't be attractive to a basement team like the Yotes until 16-17 where his salary dips to $2.75 mil.  Smid's contract is even worse because it's backloaded and he's halfway through it.  So although he's a $3.5 mil cap hit, he's making $3.75 mil in salary this season and $4 mil in 16-17.  That's the exact opposite of what the Yotes want, and it's doubtful they'd accept unless we retained salary."
CalgaryFlames,3bfxz4,lancemeszaros,2,Sun Jun 28 22:54:34 2015 UTC,"Short answer: yes, they could go to the Coyotes.  Long answer: just because the Coyotes need to pay people doesn't mean they want to pay bad people too much money to play for them -- there are enough teams in the NHL that need to shed cap that the Coyotes will be able to pick and choose the guys they want and will be able to get teams to pay for the privilege of dumping bad contracts.  Because of this, any deal involving either of these guys would require other assets going to the Coyotes -- they're not just going to take Engelland and a 6th for a 7th."
CalgaryFlames,3bfxz4,Roughly6Owls,2,Mon Jun 29 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"At this point, the Flames have plenty of cap room and it's not necessary to move them except to keep them off the ice. However, they can do that by sending them to the minors.  Next season, Monahan and Gaudreau are due raises, plus Giordano, Hudler, and Russell will need to be extended if they are to stick around.  It will be cheaper to move Engelland, Smid, and Raymond later as their contracts will all have one less year remaining."

CalgaryFlames,3bds76,Waldo76,11,Sun Jun 28 07:03:56 2015 UTC,"I've seen reports that the Jets are trying pretty hard to retain Stafford, which implies to me that he's asking for a lot less than Frolik. I'm going to link to a very well-written stats article from a Winnipeg Jets blogger, who comes to many of the same conclusions I do/have in other posts, but does better math to make those conclusions.  If you don't feel like reading it, here's some quotes that get across the major points.   There is some concerns though with Stafford's two-way numbers being nothing short of a catastrophe, even when singling out just his minutes as a Jet.   To simplify that statement, what he's saying is that Stafford, even when you ignore his time in the Buffalo dumpster, is a bad two-way (read: possession) player. This isn't inherently bad (Ovechkin and Iginla are also bad two-way players), but your team is better if you've got good two-way players in the same roster slots, and you have lots of problems when you have very few good possession players (which is us right now, by the way). In the past five years, Chicago and Los Angeles have been some of the best possession teams in the NHL -- current stats suggest that good possession correlates very well to success.   During his time as a Jet he shot at 16 percent and the Jets shot at 11 percent with him on the ice. Stafford has historically been a 10 percent shooter with his team shoots at 9 percent with him on the ice.   Stafford's product as a Jet compared to his production in Buffalo should not be taken as evidence that 'he finally got to play with good players', and any team that picks him up should not expect him to become a 60 point player next season (which is what 19 points in 26 games pro-rates to in an 82 game season). Statistically, Stafford far outperformed the standard he's set for himself in the NHL over 9 other seasons (even including the two 50 point ones with decent Buffalo squads in 2010/11/12) and his teammates somehow became better snipers while he was on the ice.  So, to summarize, if we were a good possession team who could afford an anchor or two, I'd say Stafford would be a low-risk pick-up in the 3.5m range. But we're not -- we're a bad possession team who needs better defensive forwards and we don't have goal-scoring problems right now, so we shouldn't be targeting Stafford."
CalgaryFlames,3bds76,Roughly6Owls,2,Sun Jun 28 13:04:04 2015 UTC,Too old.  He's going to be asking over 5 mill. which is a lot for a player thats going to be in a 3rd line.   We already have enough leadership veterans and trying to stack on young guns.
CalgaryFlames,3bds76,Svenka,2,Sun Jun 28 12:49:03 2015 UTC,"Would Stafford sign a 3-4 year deal? If not, it's a non-starter. If he would accept that term, I would still think long and hard before offering him anything. I think we have too many bodies up front as it is."
CalgaryFlames,3bds76,rpawson5771,2,Sun Jun 28 14:48:19 2015 UTC,"Frolik would be a much better fit due to his age (27). Former 10th overall pick.  A solid two way game; awesome defensively, good possession driving numbers, and still puts up 40+ points. Similar to Backlund. Shoots left but has always played on the RW. He would be a great fit on our 2nd/3rd line, creating depth on our weakest position behind Hudler.  Stafford is also a reliable two-way, but with his age, he could start his decline within the next 2-3 seasons, which is exactly when the flames want to be at their peak cup contending form"

I would argue it means the same for forwards, as Hall, Eberle, and RNH aren't exactly crappy. Reinhart still has a year or two to go before he gets good enough to be a top defender (and at that, it's still an if) and so does Nurse.   Edmonton also has a new coach which for that team has to hurt how well they gel at first.  They will be better--but so will we, and our team will be much more cohesive because a lot less changes have happened.   LA is hard to read right now--last year's season could be a fluke or the start of a slump."
CalgaryFlames,3bd122,Blucheese99,6,Sun Jun 28 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"Formations aren't as important in hockey, as in there aren't as many as in football. Just know that players generally don't just float without skating or don't know where they're supposed to be. Every player has a role on the ice and his teammates know where he's supposed to be. It might take a while to know what these roles are, but watching hockey in person really helps. You'll see how they do line changes on the fly (where players hop on and off the bench without stopping play) and get used to the speed of the game. Also,  the players are all usually facing the puck,  so if you lose track of it, just watch where the players are looking."
CalgaryFlames,3bd122,Rooster697,2,Sun Jun 28 02:05:44 2015 UTC,Would explain why egghead gets danced around so much
CalgaryFlames,3bd122,magic-moose,7,Sun Jun 28 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"Hockey does have formations and set plays that are run off of face-offs, similar to football, but they play a relatively small role in the game because play goes on for minutes (sometimes tens of minutes) without a stoppage.  For example, it's fairly common to see set-plays off of a face-off when your team is in the offensive zone.  If your team wins the face-off, a couple of quick pre-arranged passes can move the puck to a dangerous position in just a second or two while other players attempt to set up a screen so the goalie can't see the shot coming.  Scoring is generally difficult though, and most set-plays fail to produce results.  When they fail, play continues and the more typical improvisation within the framework of a system ensues.    Teams have systems that structure where players go and what they do, but these systems vary from team to team.  One team might use positional coverage when defending in their own zone while another might use man-on-man coverage.  To what extent and how teams collapse in towards their own crease varies considerably.  Different teams will position their players differently when advancing through the neutral zone (the space between the blue lines) or trying to stop the other team from doing the same.  Some teams will aggressively forecheck (chase and harry the puck carrier) while others will line up in the neutral zone to make getting through very difficult.  To get into the offensive zone, some teams attempt to carry the puck in a high percentage of the time while other teams use the ""dump and chase"" method (flip the puck in first, race in, and then try to recover it in the corner) almost exclusively.  When in the offensive zone, the tactics used may vary from line to line on the same team.  One line might have particularly large player who can set up an immobile screen in front of the opposing goalie, while another line might focus on rapid passing plays and sudden cuts into the slot (the area closest to the goalie's crease).     Similar to football, players do specialize in their positions, but not to the same extreme extent that football players do.  It is typical (more-so on some teams than others) for defencemen to move up in rushes or go deep into the offensive zone on cycles while forwards come back to cover for them.  If the opposing team gets possession of the puck and creates a rush, many forwards are at a disadvantage, but good two-way forwards can be effective when defending.    The fact that play can go on for several minutes at a time without a stop means that a significant portion of the tactics teams use are just to keep changing the players they have on the ice and, ideally, making it hard for the opposing team to do the same.  If your team can set up shop in the offensive zone and just stay there, it's relatively easy to rotate your players out one at a time while your opponents just get more and more gassed.    I honestly don't know if this is helpful or not.  I'm just scratching the surface, and you would probably need to write entire books to adequately explain a sport like hockey.  The best thing you can do, besides playing hockey, is to watch it. Figure out the rules.  Watch what players do and try to figure out why they're doing them that way.  Hockey is a game of centimeters and seconds.  At the NHL level, players do make mistakes, but rarely big ones.  Any patterns you see in their behaviour are probably there for a very good reason."

This is due to Winnipeg being a Canadian hockey city with a recently restored team (It's like having your fun parts  taken away and then put back on) and due to the Winnipeg White-Outs similarity and shared history with the C of Red.  Oh--the C of Red is us. More specifically us acting like a star powerup (from Mario) for our team. We yell really loud except when it's focus time for the goal tender or a player on a breakaway, in which case we pretend we're watching golf. Players from our team talk about how great the C makes them feel, players from every other team fear it."

CalgaryFlames,3bd122,MasteroftheHallows,3,Sun Jun 28 02:16:01 2015 UTC,"Let me make some basketball analogies. The Flames are like the San Antonio Spurs, we don't really have a #1 superstar in the league, but our team runs like a machine. We are like the Golden State Warriors and their 3pt shooting, you can never count us out, ever, down 4-0? We'll find a way, because of this, we are as exciting to watch as Lob city. We are a young club, building up to become a cup contender.  Hockey is a team game unlike basketball can get sometimes (unless you are the Spurs or GState), therefore formation is less important (no zone, man on man defense like in basketball, it's more of, our team forms a box, and prevent shots to the net). Players you need to know are, Captain Mark Giordano, Johnny Hockey, Moneyhan, Jiri Hudler. Engelland is a pylon, Stajan is Franchise. Fuck the Ducks, Fuck the Nucks. Praise Scorch."
CalgaryFlames,3bd122,BN_Flames_Fan,2,Sun Jun 28 05:18:39 2015 UTC,Thanks I really liked the analogy. It helped a lot.
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,nexxai,8,Sat Jun 27 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, I love the shit out of these articles. Keep'em coming"
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,juicy_truth,3,Sun Jun 28 01:12:22 2015 UTC,Again great read and thanks for keeping us updated with educated and in-depth articles.   It appears that most of us myself indexed are over the fricken moon about Hamilton. And clearly that comes with good reason. I'm wondering Darren if there was any inside rumors going around regarding a blockbuster trade? If so do you have any inside scoop about any future ones coming this week?   And completely irrelevant out of the free agents who should we lock up now in your opinion. I'm still high in Bouma and Jooris.
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,newfie_hiscock,2,Sun Jun 28 02:04:49 2015 UTC,Just letting you know Darren didn't post this and doesn't frequent this sub often

CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,newfie_hiscock,2,Sun Jun 28 11:56:06 2015 UTC,Dought?
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,kissarmygeneral,2,Sun Jun 28 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"Very well written. Hamilton is a rare breed, right up there with Jones and Ekblad (and possibly Hanifin?) as one of the best young dmen in the league. He would have instantly improved any team's top 3."
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,radiomonkey21,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:09:58 2015 UTC,"Please excuse my stupid questions, but Hamilton is still an RFA, right? What guarantees are there that he signs a new contract here? Is it possible for a team to offer sheet him?"
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,FongChowPei,3,Sun Jun 28 02:18:33 2015 UTC,"He is RFA. The Flames own his rights and have an exclusive window to negotiate with him until July 1. Afterwards, teams can sign him to an offer sheet. The Flames have ample cap space to match.   If teams offer something outrageous, the Flames can let him walk and take compensatory picks. Anything over $5.478 million per season gets them a first, second, and third round pick — slightly worse than what they gave up, but in that range they will almost surely match.  If the offer is over $7.3 million, the Flames would get the same picks plus an additional first rounder.  If the offer is over $9.1 million they would get four first round picks.  However, the Flames are on good terms with agent J.P Barry and they have already spoken. Treliving has said he anticipates a fruitful negotiation, indicating that he had some idea what terms were being asked for before the trade was completed. It would have been easy for him to ask Don Sweeney at the time of the trade.  Signs point to a deal getting done before July 1, before any offer sheets can be tendered."
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Sun Jun 28 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation!  So although there's a good chance he signs, there are no guarantees. He could potentially just play out the season and hit the open market?"
CalgaryFlames,3bc1io,FongChowPei,4,Sun Jun 28 03:42:04 2015 UTC,"No. He has no contract, so he can't play until he has one.   He's also not eligible to become unrestricted for several more years. Even if he chooses to sign for just this season, the Flames would still own his rights next summer, and for several more summers to come.  There is no realistically probable way he does not play for the Flames for the next several years."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Galaxy91122,18,Sat Jun 27 15:08:54 2015 UTC,That is a steal and a half. I saw a ton of mock drafts where he went top 15 of round 1
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,18,Sat Jun 27 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"Nice pick, Calgary. I was hoping the Lightning would take him with our early second.

CalgaryFlames,3bb511,jigglefest2,14,Sat Jun 27 15:17:05 2015 UTC,Yes! I can't believe we got him so late
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,JESUS_WALKS,12,Sat Jun 27 15:09:35 2015 UTC,"We have a ton of time to develop this guy, and think of the pressure that would have been on him had he been a first rounder for someone. This way he doesn't have to be that guy right away and can actually be honed into the player were hoping for"
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,rpawson5771,7,Sat Jun 27 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"Kylington thinks he's about two years away, and the Flames have his rights for 4 seasons until he needs to be signed to an ELC. Definitely no need to rush him."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Roughly6Owls,6,Sat Jun 27 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"Not only that, if you leave him in Sweden, you don't eat into his ELC at all, so we'll get a more developed player, cheaper, for longer."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Roughly6Owls,6,Sat Jun 27 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"Good pick. Sad that we missed Bracco, but Kylington wouldn't have been at 76."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Newtothisredditbiz,4,Sat Jun 27 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"I think Bracco has so much potential, but am pretty impressed with the upside of the two defensemen the Flames got."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Roughly6Owls,7,Sat Jun 27 16:41:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's super hard to complain about Kylington/Andersson. Treliving's obviously of the opinion that you build a team from the crease out, and our defensive prospects were a little weak this year outside of Wotherspoon."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Newtothisredditbiz,3,Sat Jun 27 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they both have huge upside. Treliving and Button have talked about the necessity for speed and skill in todays game, and talked a lot less about drafting for size since the season ended.  These guys fit that bill."

CalgaryFlames,3bb511,johnx1990,3,Sat Jun 27 15:30:57 2015 UTC,Sooo pumped! He was who I wanted at 15!
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,rorydaniel,3,Sat Jun 27 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about this one. thrilled to have the guy but there's a reason he's dropped so far. However, Harkins also dropped to like 47 so it's not too bad."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,CleetusVanDamme,4,Sat Jun 27 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"Some big question marks for sure, but that late it might be worth the risk. He was ranked very high for a very long time. He had an off season."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Aplicado,2,Sat Jun 27 15:18:02 2015 UTC,I did some reading. The knock on him was attitude/compete level stuff. And consistency. Thankfully he'll be mentored on a team which has proven very capable in helping defensemen reach their potential.
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,rpawson5771,8,Sat Jun 27 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"...and guys who know how to be pros. Come in and Baertchi it up, and you'll be Baerchit'd. No need of room for punks."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Verassen,2,Sat Jun 27 16:29:25 2015 UTC,I think his splashy 16 year old debut caused him to be overrated a bit. We picked him at an appropriate spot I think. And that's not a commentary on his lack of potential.
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,johnx1990,2,Sat Jun 27 16:29:01 2015 UTC,I think if they picked him up at 15 there would be some questions. At 60 with another d man picked up a few picks earlier I think it has the potential to be a great pick if you don't let the hype he once had be the bench mark for how we rate him going forward.
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,MasteroftheHallows,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, there's also something about Swedish defenseman that makes me a bit more satisfied with the pick. Especially since we went with 2 of them. They always seem to turn out pretty good."

CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Mowglijoe12,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"Not surprised that he fell so far down the list, excited that we picked him up but weary. This kid has the physical tools to make it to the NHL and be a serviceable third pairing defenseman (floor) or even become an all-star, his skating is unbelievably good but his cons outweigh his pros from what I've read and seen. He has some of the worst mitts for a puck moving defenseman and his hockey iq/decision making skills need to improve. He is sound when it comes to his positioning but he can never make the right split second plays when it comes to being hemmed in his own zone and 200 ft down the ice."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,miner88,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:24:50 2015 UTC,Just saw a video with him - his name is pronounced chill-ington. Elite level confirmed.

CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Rfilsinger,-5,Sat Jun 27 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure how to feel about this. Trading our next two picks for a guy that nobody wanted to take through the first 59 picks seems questionable. I would've preferred to take two players at this point in the draft rather than one and I would've preferred a forward as well. Either way I don't think I'm too upset over this one, I'll wait and see how things go again.  Oh well, hopefully Kylington works out and can fill in for Gio in a few years."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,Buksey,5,Sat Jun 27 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"Treveling swinging for the fences here... super risky pick but at 60 is much much better than 15th, 42nd, 53rd etc. Maybe he is a bust but maybe he works out his issues and gets to where some scouts originally saw him as... Erik Karlsson 2.0.  I think management is seeing the NCAA free agents as more of a source for free assets. Hopefully they can pick up some forwards there."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,enag7,4,Sat Jun 27 15:25:11 2015 UTC,I can't say taking a guy most people had in their to 20 at 60 is super risky.
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,teckhz,6,Sat Jun 27 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to prohected upside. Kylington was a projected Top 15 and could still have a decent chance of having a career in the NHL. Most 3rd+ rounders rarely play more then a handful of seasons, if they crack the line up."
CalgaryFlames,3bb511,blink0r,-3,Sat Jun 27 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"Which is why I would rather have 2 small chances rather than one. I have no issue with getting him at this point, but trading two picks to get one is why I'm not the biggest fan."
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,Fythian,7,Sat Jun 27 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that we sign Setoguchi to a 4 mill X 6 year contract.   But seriously:  The obvious one who will be gone:  Setoguchi, McGrattan, Potter.   The others who I think will most likely/definietely be gone:  Ramo, Byron, Diaz, and some random AHL players.    BUT, now let's discuss who I think we should trade away for assets if possible. I expect some would be really hard to move based on injuries, cap hit and quality of player:   Bollig, Raymond, Smid and/or Engelland, and Wideman.    Also I read somewhere that Hiller would be the Sharks plan B if they couldn't get one of Talbot, Lehner or Lack so we might be able to trade Hiller and re-sign ramo to 1-2 years."
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,mikesulls,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:04:45 2015 UTC,"Raymond is pretty much untradable, Smid is on LTIR and is likely unofficially retired anyway so maybe he can be traded to a team with salary floor issues like Phoenix, but he's pretty much out of the picture anyway. Wideman is probably very tradeable after this season, but I think he has value here so there better be a good reason to trade him, as we don't need the cap space yet.   I think in net we're pretty much committed to having Hiller/Ortio at this point. I can't see a team who has a need for Hiller, and Ortio is now required to clear waivers so he will be staying up almost for sure. It could be good. Hiller isn't a 65+ game starter in my opinion, and  Ortio showed promise during his 6 game stint, and may have looked even better if the whole team didn't collectively shit their pants in Anaheim, like usual, during his last game of the stretch."
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,jeffwhit,2,Sun Jun 28 11:10:25 2015 UTC,"I really want Ramo, but, I see the logic in this, sadly"
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,catsfive,4,Sun Jun 28 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"To me, the players to keep are Jooris, Bouma, Ferland, and Hamilton. Should be in the area of 11 million cap hit, 6 for Hamilton, and average of a bit less than 2 each for the trio of forwards.  It's sad to say but I think Byron, Diaz, and Ramo are all going to hit the market. :("
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,rpawson5771,3,Sat Jun 27 23:19:41 2015 UTC,I think Shore will be the only additional player re-signed to the ones you already named.
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Sun Jun 28 00:02:26 2015 UTC,Arnold and Wolf too.
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,rpawson5771,2,Sun Jun 28 01:56:13 2015 UTC,I was just looking at the main roster. I'm sure some of the non roster RFAs will be back.
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,TheWalkingHyperbole,2,Sun Jun 28 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"Before this weekend, I didn't think Diaz would be hitting the market. Now, I think Diaz is hitting the market. Acquiring Hamilton means a spot will be filled. We've also signed Nakladal, of course Wotherspoon will be trying to force a spot, have Smid, and Schlemko will want to be re-signed. Spots are becoming scarce."
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,takingabbath,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:48:29 2015 UTC,This is the type of problem you want to have as a GM though. Internal competition can bring out the best in your players.
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,marbsarebad,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"Schlemko getting re-signed is completely dependent on Smid's health. If Smid is going to spend most or all of the season on LTIR, Schlemko is definitely going to get signed. If Smid is healthy, there's no room for Schlemko.  Gio - Brodie  Russell - Hamilton  Smid - Wideman  Wotherspoon/Naladal/Engelland  Something like that.  EDIT: I just realised that with those pairings, each defensive pair would have about an 8.5 million cap hit, assuming Hamilton signs for about 6."
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,takingabbath,2,Sun Jun 28 00:00:16 2015 UTC,I wonder if Byron will be able to score on the free market?
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,Hashis_H,2,Sat Jun 27 23:44:09 2015 UTC,He's a relatively reliable bottom six guy who's good on the PK. I bet somebody will pick him up. I doubt he gets more than a couple mil/yr though.
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,Rideyn,3,Sat Jun 27 23:49:58 2015 UTC,whoosh
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,lancemeszaros,3,Sun Jun 28 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Sad to look at that list and see McGratton as an UFA, I know his time of playing is over but I do hope he stays with the team in some way in the background."
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,catsfive,3,Sun Jun 28 04:54:55 2015 UTC,"The ""Untouchable"" Tier: Monahan, Gaudreau, Backlund, Bennett, Brodie, Giordano, Hamilton, Stajan.  These players should not be traded under any circumstances, either because they are and/or will be key players on the team, or the return on them will never realistically be enough to fill the hole made from them leaving.  In Stajan's case, his contract ($3.125 mil cap for 3 years for a bottom 6 center, and a NTC) will severely limit the return.  No point dealing him, at least not right now. The ""Thanks, but..."" Tier: Jones, Hudler, Bouma, Russell, Wideman.  All of them are solid players, but the team could potentially have a chance to sell high on them.  With the exception of Bouma, all of them will be UFAs when their current contracts expire.  Jones, Hudler and Wideman are in their 30s already, Russell is 28.  All of them except Jones has had the best offensive performance of their NHL careers last season, for Jones it was his best since 11-12.  This means all of their respective trade values will likely be as high as they ever will be again right now.  Again, I understand that we're talking about three of our top 6 forwards and our second defensive pairing from last season.  We should not simply kick them out the door unceremoniously for a terrible return.  But understand that all of them could potentially fetch a high return this summer.  Of the five, Wideman and Bouma are the least likely to move, because of Wideman's NTC and cap hit and Bouma being an RFA.   ** Side-note on Wideman: has anyone considered moving him to RW?  I mean, he's not exactly Byfuglien so his impact on defense wouldn't be missed.   The ""Oh god kill it, kill it now"" Tier: Engelland, Smid, Raymond.  Engelland and Smid have negative value to the team, even when Smid's healthy.  They literally make the team worse every time they step on the ice, and they are taking up a roster spot that a better player could occupy for a fraction of the cost.  Yes, you think Engelland looked okay near the end of the season and in the playoffs.  That's because he was playing with Brodie most of that time with Gio injured.  For Raymond, he can still be a serviceable bottom 6 player, especially with good center like Stajan, but his cap hit is atrocious for that role.  Unfortunately, his NTC will make him hard to deal. The ""I know everyone has a giant C, but..."" Tier: Every other center not listed.  The team has a ridiculous amount of natural centers.  Like, a boatload of them.  Meanwhile, the team is weak on the wing, especially right wing.  Seriously, we have Jones as the only natural RW, with Poirier and maybe Smith as the only notable RW prospects.  While the aforementioned untouchables should be left alone and I already discussed Hudler, all those young center prospects can be used to sweeten the deal on a potential trade, either to get rid of one of our boat anchors or to try and get a solid winger in return.  Yes, we all love Colborne/Jooris/Shore/Granlund/Byron/Arnold/Reinhart but there's only so many roster positions they can take, especially if they can't comfortably transition over to the wing. The ""Meh"" Tier: Everyone else.  They don't make the team actively worse (or at least in Bollig's case, is at least cheap enough that it doesn't matter too much), but probably won't fetch a good return either.  If someone actually comes calling then entertain an offer, but if all we're getting is a late-round draft pick or a bottom 6 AHLer then don't bother."

CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,jeffwhit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"Important points (from my perspective) re: defensive depth...   Wotherspoon is no longer waiver-exempt. If we want him, he's gotta stay with the big boys. He's left-handed. With Nakladal as a new signing on the back end, Diaz is 95% gone. Diaz was originally signed as depth, and we're now sitting on a ton of depth guys -- unfortunately he's the guy who doesn't have a contract (along with Potter, but Potter was even more of a 'only for injuries' acquisition). The only timeline I can see where Diaz is re-signed is one where Engelland is traded... and I don't see who'd take him for anything, considering depth defensemen aren't worth his 2.9m contract. Nakladal's going to be getting a look in the big club this season -- he wouldn't have left the Czech Republic team he was on otherwise. He was a 'defensive defenseman' in the Czech league, and he's right-handed -- which means the only person on the roster he's competing with is Engelland. Accordingly, this means Engelland should be sweating. If Hamilton plays on the right side with Giordano, [implying that...] Brodie plays on the left side, [then] Smid is completely redundant -- on the depth chart, Wotherspoon's below him and trending upwards, while Russell's above him and will be our #3 LHD (behind Brodie/Giordano). If Brodie plays on the right side (like he did this season), Engelland's completely redundant -- Wideman's above him and moving into the #3 spot, with the aforementioned Nakladal situation happening below him. Schlemko's an upgrade on Smid, but I'm not sure if he's an upgrade on Russell -- can we afford to run both Schlemko and Wotherspoon as healthy scratches (like we did with Potter and Diaz this season) in the event that Russell becomes our #3LD? Unlike Potter, Schlemko won't cross the waiver wire without someone taking him (we know this because of how we got him). Schlemko's a good depth option, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him signed as the 'in-case-of-injuries' guy this season, but I'm not ready to get too attached, in case Treliving/Hartley don't see a way to hold 8 defensemen on the non-waiver-exempt roster."
CalgaryFlames,3bcmuz,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:28:31 2015 UTC,Everyone's forgotten we signed NCAA defenceman Kenny Morrison too. He's a long shot for the big team but he's got the potential to push past Wotherspoon who absolutely needs to start his NHL career soon if it's going to happen.

CalgaryFlames,3bc69u,marbsarebad,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:48:49 2015 UTC,I think Williams would be a great signing as long as the term isnt more than 3 years.

Like, even when he was on Buffalo, and Buffalo wasn't trash, he wasn't a good possession player.  You can be a good player without driving possession -- Jarome Iginla doesn't drive possession, Alex Ovechkin doesn't drive possession -- but having too many guys who don't push play down the ice means you're playing with training weights on."
CalgaryFlames,3bc69u,Circlesmirk,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:57:59 2015 UTC,Still better than Chris Stewart though.

CalgaryFlames,3bc69u,Roughly6Owls,3,Sun Jun 28 12:18:27 2015 UTC,"If you were here for the earlier part of the off-season, you will know that I've thought a lot about what the Flames needed to do in free agency. I've looked at lots of stats and garbage, and if you're interested in watching me deep dive, you can look there. This is a more current re-hash of the same material...  My agenda last month was Frolik, then Franson, then a bunch of defensemen, then Williams.  My new agenda, now that we've been taught how to Dought, removes every defenseman from that list... with the corollary (i.e. relying on the fact) that we don't trade anyone from our top-5 guys (Wideman/Russell). We'll get to that later.  The Flames have said they want to add players who are strong in possession, and I agree with Treliving that it should be an area of focus. (They've also said they want to add young guys, but really, we're looking at the shittiest free agent pool in the last five years, the young guys will have to wait unless we get some trade-bait). That means we don't want Iginla's, who score well but don't really drive possession. We want guys like Kopitar and Bergeron, rather than Pacioretty and Martin St. Louis.   The best guy on the block for this if you look at past performance is Justin Williams -- he comes from a possession-driven system, out of one of the best possession teams in the NHL, and has consistently scored more than 40 points a season for more than five years (if you pro-rate the lockout season). He's said he's looking for a deal in the 4-5m AAV range, which is outside the dollar value the Kings could give him as of this moment, and he's looking for around three to four years of term -- that is, his last contract. He's also not chasing money right now -- he wants another cup, so he's only going to be talking to contenders. Maybe Calgary's a contender now? He's got a history of playoff performance, including three stanley cup rings (one with Carolina, two with LA) and a 7-0 record in game sevens, in which he's scored fourteen points. The problem, as there is one with every free agent this year, is that JW is 33. Signing him would make him the oldest player on the team (and more than a year older than anyone not named Jonas Hiller). Considering we can get him for no assets and he's likely less expensive than Frolik, he's my first choice. I'd be looking for something in the range of 4.3mx3y, and I think he'd agree to that too if he felt that Calgary'd be able to get him a cup within three years. Next up is Michael Frolik: I don't think it's exaggeration to say that MikeFro is probably the most attractive unrestricted free agent at any forward position this year, and possibly the most attractive unrestricted free agent period (depending on how you feel about Mike Green or Cody Franson). Worse yet, he knows it -- reports say he's testing free agency to fish for higher offers than what Winnipeg's offered him. Statistically, he's slightly worse than Williams, but still solidly a top-6RW (though he's top-6 like Backlund, not top-6 like Hudler -- which is important because that's why he shouldn't be paid what he's looking for). He's won a cup (CHI, 2013), but he was very much a depth player, not part of the core. You've got to believe he's got more tread on the tires (at 27 instead of 33) than Williams. Originally he was my first choice, but it looks like he's going to be costing more than 6m AAV on a long-term deal... That's the kind of deal you regret if the player gets worse, and I feel like Treliving's going to be looking at our big contracts for next season (Hamilton right now, with Gaudreau/Monahan/Giordano/possibly Hudler coming up) and be a little bullish on throwing out massive contracts to free agents. For those reason's, JW's surpassed him on my list. After these guys, quality gets worse -- next up, we've got Eric Fehr, the 29 year-old, 30 point/middle-6 doppelganger of the two guys above -- the poor man's version, if you will. He's said he's testing free agency, as have the Capitals, and their fans are prety positive on the guy. I think we could lock him up to a 3.2mx3y deal, which would be a 100% raise for him, and everyone would be really happy with it, and I think he'd be a very similar player and occupy a similar slot to David Jones -- but because we don't have RW depth, there's actually a spot on our roster for two of those guys. I'm not sure if that's good or not... He's a centre who plays a lot of the wing in Washington, so I think he'd basically be a winger here. Worth mentioning that his upper body appears to be made out of glass -- some injury problems, especially with his shoulders and elbows. Martin Erat's an interesting choice... why is he on my list? Because he's a surprising defensive force. If we want possession players, Erat could be a low-budget, low-risk pick-up if no one else takes a flying chance on him. Don't think I'm trying to pretty up a chimp here -- Erat's 33, and offensively he's bad -- his best years are far behind him re: point totals. But he was a possession positive player on the Coyotes. That's not a trivial accomplishment. There's no way I sign him for more than what I'm giving JW, which means Erat's getting a paycut, but Mike Ribiero proved this year that even old dogs can have bounce back seasons. Stewart/Stafford: I don't want these guys. Remember when I was talking about guys who get points without driving play? These are the guys I'm talking about, and they're not even amazing at generating points without help from other people on the roster. We can't afford to add possession-poor forwards to our roster, we're swimming in them.   In the next post, I'll talk about trading a defenseman and then what we should look at."
CalgaryFlames,3bc69u,Roughly6Owls,2,Sun Jun 28 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"So, trading a defenseman/picking up a defenseman.  We've got a 56 point Wideman sitting on our blue line. He's making 5.25 million until the 2017-18 season. That's more money than anyone else on our team, by about 750k. We've also got 6.5 million dollars tied into Smid and Engelland for the same period.  Here's some selected names on a chart -- they're the Flames blueliners, plus some free agency names that I like or that other people like. In general, we want our players to be blue coloured (see Hamilton, Giordano, Brodie) and in the top half of the graph (which means they're playing against top-lines for lots of minutes every night, which would suggest they're strong defensemen).  If either: A. Smid goes on LTIR for next season, one of Engelland or Wideman is moved. We don't get a defenseman who's better than Schlemko/Engelland/Nakladal in return; or B. Two of Engelland/Smid/Wideman are moved. We don't get a defenseman who's better than Schlemko/Engelland/Nakladal in return; we should look at getting Franson or Sekera (with Jackman or Michalek as a clear second tier choice) out of free agency. I'd prefer Wideman at 5.25 to either of those guys at 5.7 or 5.8 (remember that Petry just signed for 5.5), but I think those two (both of whom are under 30, by the way) might take a deal at under 5m AAV if you locked them up long-term -- that type of stability just hasn't existed for Franson because he's been getting dicked around by Toronto for his entire career, and 4.7m AAV is a almost a 50% raise for Sekera.  Let's talk about that second tier -- Jackman and Michalek, my honourable mentions. Michalek's 32, which is actually on the young side for UFA defensemen this year (ew), but last year he was very successful in very hard deployments -- the problem here is that I'm not 100% sure why the Blues didn't like him, and I know he's had at least one concussion, and historically he's nothing special on offense. All thos question marks make me less ready to jump on him than Franson or Sekera.   Jackman's interesting because he's a LHD -- he's actually a better fit for the team if we move Russell than if we move Engelland or Wideman -- he's good in his own end, but not so much when on offense, and he checks off a lot of the Burke #intangible boxes tm as well, like being a leadership presence, being a physical guy, and having some truculence."
CalgaryFlames,3bc69u,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:48:08 2015 UTC,"Awesome information, you seem to know what you're saying, so what is your opinion on a short term contract with Sean Bergenheim?"
CalgaryFlames,3bc69u,Fythian,2,Sun Jun 28 07:42:26 2015 UTC,"Bergenheim's a little bit like Erat -- doesn't score enough points to be worth $$$$, but he's got good possession stats so he might actually be worth a phone call if we can get him really cheap ($).  The reason he's not on my list is because he's a left-handed shot, and unlike Erat (who is also a left-shot, but primarily plays RW, which is what Hudler and Poirier do as well), Bergenheim's a LW and has been all his career. We're so deep on the left-handed side of our roster that Jooris and Jones were basically the only forwards that played on our NHL roster last season who were right-handed -- in my opinion if we're already at the lower tiers of our desirable free agents, we should be picky enough to look for positional need."
CalgaryFlames,3bc69u,catsfive,2,Sun Jun 28 12:37:37 2015 UTC,"I think Frolik or Stewart are the only UFAs that really make any sense for the Flames to chase.  Defense is pretty set unless some awesome deal for Wideman comes up but somehow I feel like he won;t be willing to waive his NMC.  In net, the Flames have been rumored to be looking for a change but it seems like they aren't going to get it. The 2 biggest UFA goalies left are Ramo and Fasth.

CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,Roughly6Owls,5,Sat Jun 27 22:54:25 2015 UTC,REALLY LIKE what we did in the second round!  Wow this is turning out to be a promising draft.
CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,Renslip1,5,Sat Jun 27 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty happy with this, yeah. I think Kylington was worth the flyer pick."
CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,MrCopacetic,7,Sat Jun 27 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"Dropped so much. He was top-10 at the start of the year and dropped in the rankings, but he could still turn out to be really good. A lot had him projected to go first round. Some even wanted us to take him at 15.   Really pumped. And I love the sounds of this Andersson kid."
CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,Roughly6Owls,3,Sat Jun 27 15:40:48 2015 UTC,Sweden has a reputation of producing really solid D-men. Plus there is no rush to get him to the show.  Pretty happy to snag him at 60

Kirill Kaprizov, Russian LW. Parker Wotherspoon (yes, Tyler's brother), Defenseman. Paritally because of the connection, partially because he was supposed to go in the late second round. Filip Ahl, LW in the SEL. Possible Swedish sleeper. Michael Spacek, Czech forward playing against men. David Kase, Czech forward in the second tier of the Czech pro league. Ryan Pilon, Provorov's line partner in Brandon. Nikita Korostolev, Sarnia (?). Amazing shot, needs skating work.   Unfortunately, we don't have too many massive fallers for forwards -- Bracco and Kylington were basically the end of them."

Kylington is a risk but I was willing to risk it for the biscuit with him. We've had a great draft day. Reliving has really impressed me. We got 1 player I wanted that I thought would go way earlier and surprised with Hamilton and an impressive Andersson.
CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,Trickitt,3,Sat Jun 27 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"Apparently Andersson had the third hardest shot at the Combine, behind Eichel and Guryanov.  So that's nice."

CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,Roughly6Owls,2,Sat Jun 27 17:46:46 2015 UTC,Big time. Still in a bit of shock my friend. Such a good feeling.
CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,Roughly6Owls,2,Sat Jun 27 17:53:33 2015 UTC,I'm definitely in shock. Pretty much feels like we won some kind of lottery.

CalgaryFlames,3bb6qr,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:28:04 2015 UTC,"So, picks for the 6th/7th round that I find interesting.   Radovan Bondra. No relation to Petr Bondra, unfortunately. Slovak, plays for the Kosice U20 team. I think he's worth taking at 6th, considering he showed up in some rankings at 120. Denis Godla. Currently plays for the Bratislava KHL team, looked great for the Slovaks at the WJC. You could replace this with any other goaltender, honestly. Veini Vehvilainen has a sweet name (although he might not get picked cause no GM wants to walk up and say it), and we like Finns, and he catches right like Jonas Hiller (as opposed to left, like the rest of the world). Strong choices for those reasons. Adam Musil, Nathan Noel, Glenn Gawdin (>) Pius Suter, Tyler Soy, Anthony Richard. Centremen, slight bias to the top half of these names, not that theres much of a difference between them. Safest position to pick cause they move to the wings easy, all CHL boys. Gawdin, Musil, Soyare WHLers, Noel and Richard are QMJHLers, Suter's from Guelph. Honourable mention to Keegan Koelsar, so we can have all the Keegans."

CalgaryFlames,3bboh4,Ninjygingy,4,Sat Jun 27 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"Schlemko still needs a contract which I'm hoping he will get. Solid waiver pickup last year and actually drove possession the right way on the 3rd pairing.  Engelland definitely should be the 7th man if Schlemko does sign. If not, it's going to be a race between Engelland and Wotherspoon, and perhaps Morrison."
CalgaryFlames,3bboh4,rpawson5771,3,Sat Jun 27 18:16:30 2015 UTC,"He should be. He's behind the other three D on the right side (Hamilton, Brodie, Wideman). If the group as it stands now is the same group that starts the season, Engelland is not an every game player.    EDIT: I'm mixed up. In the Gio-Brodie pairing last year, Brodie played the right side didn't he? I seem to recall it was an adjustment for him playing on the left with Engelland on the right after Gio went down."
CalgaryFlames,3bboh4,Euneek,3,Sat Jun 27 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, TJ is on the right"
CalgaryFlames,3bboh4,Resolute45,2,Sat Jun 27 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"trade wideman, his value is higher than it will ever be right now"
CalgaryFlames,3bboh4,Jumpanator,2,Sat Jun 27 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"Engelland could be, but it will only happen if Wotherspoon or a FA pickup convinces him that he belongs in the lineup ahead of Engelland.  And given Deryk was playing 20 minutes a night to end last year - even if necessitated by injury - I would say not to bet on it.  At least not right away."
CalgaryFlames,3bboh4,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:50:15 2015 UTC,"If Wideman isn't moved, that's how it should shape up.  I do think there are a few good reasons why he should be traded, mostly because his value is likely never going to be higher.    Trading Wideman would also create a bit more competition for a spot on the third pairing, since Wotherspoon, Morrisson, and (hopefully) Nakladal aren't far from being NHL regulars.  If one of those guys can usurp Engelland that would be great news for the team going forward.  If not then Engelland is a serviceable third pairing option, at least in the short term.  That would also mean one of the three young guns can jump right in when an injury occurs.  This is all assuming Smid will be out long-term."
CalgaryFlames,3bboh4,Fythian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"I'd be very concerned with having Engelland on the third pairing. Wideman is terrific offensively, but not great at driving possession (winning puck battles, getting the puck out of the zone, etc.). Engelland of course is a possession black-hole. If those two are paired up, one of them will have to play on their unnatural side and make things even worse.  It would be much more ideal if Wotherspoon or someone else can step in on the left side and push Engelland to the seventh spot."
CalgaryFlames,3bazrs,Incompatibert,13,Sat Jun 27 14:16:07 2015 UTC,The return was absolute trash as well -- a third and a 2016 seventh.  Someone was saying Lehner would be setting the price for Talbot and Lack... guess not.
CalgaryFlames,3bazrs,Roughly6Owls,11,Sat Jun 27 15:01:51 2015 UTC,What about his dad? He's still going to be at Canucks games right?
CalgaryFlames,3bazrs,Newtothisredditbiz,4,Sat Jun 27 16:50:01 2015 UTC,Hope we never hear of his legend or his father ever again.
CalgaryFlames,3bazrs,rpawson5771,3,Sat Jun 27 16:25:37 2015 UTC,What was the reasoning behind trading Lack? Seems like a great goalie and person. And like you guys said the return was bunk.
CalgaryFlames,3bazrs,Renslip1,6,Sat Jun 27 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"Canucks had three goalies who were not waiver-exempt. Miller, Lack, and Markstrom.   The Canucks wanted to hang on to a veteran starter, and a little-known fact is that Miller had better numbers against high-danger shots than Lack did. So it came down to Markstrom and Lack being shipped out the door.  Benning said he wanted to recover a 2nd or 3rd round pick, and nobody was offering that for Markstrom. He's been an excellent AHL goalie but has shit the bed so far in the NHL. So with Lack providing the higher return, he was traded."
CalgaryFlames,3bazrs,Newtothisredditbiz,3,Sat Jun 27 16:49:04 2015 UTC,"It was a similar situation as ours with Hiller, Ramo and Ortio. Miller was inked for a bigger salary so harder to move (and arguably the better goalie) and Markstrom (iirc) was going to have to clear Waivers to be sent down (again). This left Lack as the odd man out. With his proven success at the NHL level, it made him a decent trade chip too."
CalgaryFlames,3bazrs,Buksey,2,Sat Jun 27 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like Miller is on the decline. With injuries and inconsistent play, thought they might try to hang on to Lack."

CalgaryFlames,3bb5ef,BootRacer,7,Sat Jun 27 15:12:36 2015 UTC,Good. It never made sense to me anyway.
CalgaryFlames,3bb5ef,g_gundy,2,Sat Jun 27 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"I understand why. Talbot has excellent upside and is young enough at 27 to hang around for awhile.  After Hiller, the Flames' goalies are awfully inexperienced. You hope Ortio is good enough to back up this season, and start the next, but with his short NHL track record you can never tell. Even if he is ready for those roles it's good to have internal competition and a fall-back.  What happens next season if Ortio is the starter and gets hurt?  That said, the Flames can't afford to trade all their draft picks and Hamilton should make enough of a difference keeping the puck out of the Flames' zone that they can be a bit more patient seeing how their goalies develop."
CalgaryFlames,3bb5ef,Newtothisredditbiz,4,Sat Jun 27 16:57:58 2015 UTC,"Talbot isn't very experienced either. The guy has less than 60 NHL games and backed up one of the best goalies in the league behind one of the best defense cores in the league.   Yea the guy has great potential and looked great last year (so did Ortio by the way), but it remains to be seen if he can handle the workload of a starter. Lots of guys have looked poised to become a starter after a couple great seasons only to falter out of the gate.  Meanwhile, we have Ortio and Gillies (who I'd argue have at least as much potential if not more) and Ortio in a position where he has to be in the NHL this year or we lose him to waivers. That means you need Talbot to be your starter which is a big risk PLUS you'd have to give up significant assets to get him.   I see it as high risk, minimal reward. Ortio/Gillies are our future as of right now and Hiller (though very average) makes a decent stop-gap until they're ready."
CalgaryFlames,3bb5ef,g_gundy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"All very true. Add the fact that Talbot is UFA at the end of next season and would need to be extended to be worth the while.  I'm not saying the Flames should have pushed hard for it, just that there are reasons they should consider adding another option in net to hedge some downside risks."
CalgaryFlames,3bb5ef,Newtothisredditbiz,7,Sat Jun 27 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"Probably for the best, given the asking price. Happier with Kylington in the prospect pool due to using our second and third rounders."
CalgaryFlames,3bb5ef,rpawson5771,2,Sat Jun 27 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"That asking price was quite low, oilers did pretty well to be honest."
CalgaryFlames,3bb5ef,WarmBagOfLotion,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:01:39 2015 UTC,It certainly ended up lower than the chatter yesterday suggested it would be. I wonder if Sather is kicking himself for not taking the first rounder that was rumored to be offered?

Hiller will have shady moments throughout the year (which is natural for most goalies) and Joni, being a young & inexperienced player, may not be able to bail him out every time.

Basically, they overvalued the 15th against the 16th and the 52nd against the 57th relative to the 33rd against the 45th (the difference between these picks outweighs the difference between the other two)."
CalgaryFlames,3b9y81,SgtFinnish,2,Sat Jun 27 17:49:39 2015 UTC,I guess Sweeney and Neely are Flames fans!
CalgaryFlames,3b9y81,coldb_too,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:22:43 2015 UTC,I think it has a lot to do with Treliving being a well respected man.  People want to make deals with him.  I'm starting to miss Feaster less and less everyday.

CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,Roughly6Owls,5,Fri Jun 26 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"The 2nd was our second, so our pick from Glencross is the only one left.  Still good though."

CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,MrCopacetic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:26:04 2015 UTC,Close enough though. Basically Baertschi.

CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,MrCopacetic,2,Fri Jun 26 21:07:04 2015 UTC,Glencross was dealt for Washington's second and third.

Have you heard of Danny DeKeyser? Jeff Petry? There's more than that, but college UFAs are very good players sometimes and he can probably play in the AHL still.

It's not a perfect idea, but if we could get 2 nice prospects for him that'd be pretty cool."

CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,nexxai,12,Sat Jun 27 00:34:50 2015 UTC,Is it too much to suggest that Hamilton will likely be a better defenseman and have a better NHL career than any defenseman available in this draft?
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,Southern_Point,12,Fri Jun 26 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""any defenseman available in this draft"" (Hanifin: I'm looking at you), but certainly better than any player that would have been available at #15."
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,CleetusVanDamme,7,Fri Jun 26 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"The other big thing is that with Dougie the flames window for contending is starting to look to be around 2017-18, and it could be open for 3-4 years after that with some proper good GMing"
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,canadam,5,Fri Jun 26 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"Draft picks are always a gamble. Hamilton is an NHL played d man with a big upside. At 15, we wouldn't have gotten a blue chip defenseman. It's a good deal."
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,Resolute45,6,Fri Jun 26 20:01:34 2015 UTC,Personally I think he likely will be.
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,DefinitelyOrMaybeNot,2,Fri Jun 26 19:37:18 2015 UTC,"Hanifin is crazy highly regarded, but he is going to be long gone for us.  I think we were hoping Provorov would fall to us at 15, but I'm far happier with Hamilton, who is basically a sure thing.  But who knows who comes out of nowhere in this draft though.  Brodie was a fourth rounder, for instance."
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,Resolute45,3,Fri Jun 26 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be ""Calgary traded away three picks and gave away Superstar, First liner, 2nd liner"" Or they could turn into three AHL guys. 1 in the hand is worth three in the bush."
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,NewmanTheScofflaw,2,Fri Jun 26 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"As others have noted, we basically traded 15OA, Baertschi and Glencross for Hamilton.  That's just nuts, even if Boston hits a home run on the draft."
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,Resolute45,2,Fri Jun 26 20:00:46 2015 UTC,To be honest most rumours have it pegged that Dougie Hamilton wanted too much money from the Bruins and they are already in a terrible cap situation. They had their hands tied behind their backs.
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,superdude99,3,Fri Jun 26 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Their hands were tied in terms of signing, but for a player of Hamilton's calibre, they should have done a lot better in a trade.   If Hamilton continues to develop the way he has so far, we are potentially looking at a trade that will be mentioned in the same breath as Gilmour to Toronto or Neely to Boston."

CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,scurfit,3,Fri Jun 26 19:36:50 2015 UTC,Really happy to see the fucking Bs ::spit:: lose such a talented young defenseman.
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,mikesulls,3,Fri Jun 26 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"I like it. A lot. Especially considering I don't think the draft class was deep enough that the Flames could get a quality player at 15. Hamilton is surely an upgrade on ... checks TSN's latest mock draft ... Joel Eriksson Ek, a centre who put up 4 G and 2 A last season at Farjestad in Sweden."

The good news is that we're now set for defenseman until we can no longer afford Hamilton and Brodie."
CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,_86_,3,Fri Jun 26 19:45:04 2015 UTC,I think you put him in 2nd Pair and play Wideman in a more Offensive style versus weaker 3/4 lines and Pps

CalgaryFlames,3b87v3,SkiFreeSasquatch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:46:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was so excited for this so-called deep draft and was kind of disappointed that we gave up so many picks to get him. But after considering all of the variables, how good Hamilton is already and his future development, I am super happy with this trade. The best part is how pissed the other side's fans are about it, it shows how great of a player he is. It makes up for the whole Phaneuf blunder in my eyes."
CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,marbsarebad,21,Fri Jun 26 19:36:44 2015 UTC,Yeah! I was starting to get excited for the draft. Fuck that! We got Dougie Hamilton now! Who cares about the draft?
CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,BN_Flames_Fan,5,Fri Jun 26 19:45:13 2015 UTC,You gotta assume that one of Wideman or Russell are being shopped now.  No way is Dougie playing on the bottom pairing.
CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,Kellervo,7,Fri Jun 26 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"Who needs a bottom pairing if you have four guys capable of playing 25 minutes a night?  But seriously I could see Wideman moving now. Hamilton makes him expendable.  Best case scenario I think is to keep them all, and use the ridiculous amount of time our top 4 can munch to help ease Morrison/Wotherspoon/Naz into the big leagues."
CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,fknSamsquamptch,4,Fri Jun 26 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"Okay picture these powerplay lines:  Gio - Hamilton Brodie - Wideman  Mix and match Gio and Brodie as you choose, but those are two amazing d-pairs for the powerplay.  Probably the best two powerplay d-pairs in the league, and probably by a wide margin."

CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,Roughly6Owls,3,Fri Jun 26 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"Our defensemen, put into an approximate depth chart and sorted by handedness.    LHD RHD    Giordano Hamilton   Brodie Wideman   Russell Engelland (ew)   Schlemko/Wotherspoon/Sieloff Nakladal/Morrison    By my estimation, it looks like Russell's been made redundant. Though of course, when Brodie can play either side, BT'll probably take the best offer for whoever (which'll likely still be Russell, considering he's on a 2.8m contract, but Wideman also scored 56 points so it's not like he's shitty)."
CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,blink0r,8,Fri Jun 26 19:58:14 2015 UTC,I'd much rather have Russell than Wideman.   Wideman gets traded today for a second rounder. Calling it now.
CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Russell as well -- he's younger, cheaper, and we don't really need the offense Wideman brings considering we now have three better defensemen who scored more than 40 points last season (Gio = 48, Hamilton = 42, Brodie = 41). However, like I said, I think we play this one by ear (or maybe even trade them both) -- I think the Flames could sell really high on both of them.  I like Wideman to Edmonton for 33rd -- He played more (avg TOI) than anyone on their blue line last year, and scored 56 points. They've said they want defensemen. I could definitely see them jumping on that."

CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,Jgb714,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Bottom pairing? The top pair will probably be Brodie and Hamilton then gio and wideman/Russell. Russell makes almost nothing, it wouldn't make sense to move him"

CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,SobaTzar,2,Fri Jun 26 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"So? If it makes you feel better call Brodie Hamilton the second pair then. With two d men like that you break them up. Look at Chicago, Keith and Seabrook are clearly their top two dmen, but they don't play together so that one is almost always on the ice. I would be 100% shocked if Hamilton and gio are on the same pairing."
CalgaryFlames,3b88zw,motivate18,4,Fri Jun 26 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"No, Gio and Brodie have such awesome chemistry there's no way they'd be split.  It's either Russell - Hamilton or Hamilton-Wideman."

CalgaryFlames,3b9n2s,Kovaz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"Gonna piggy-back on this top comment. Some other things I haven't seen mentioned:    CalgaryPuck is probably the biggest Flames forum, lots of discussion there. CalgaryPuck user sureLoss is the best news source for general hockey news I've found. Any hockey news that appears anywhere is posted there immediately, so quickly that I don't look anywhere else. Another user, Anthony Cook, makes these awesome highlight packages on youtube. He's good at capturing not just the goals but also good defensive plays and offensive plays that don't end in points. Ex: Johnny Gaudreau Part 2"
CalgaryFlames,3b9n2s,fknSamsquamptch,3,Sat Jun 27 14:24:17 2015 UTC,"Copypasta from one of my previous posts where someone asked a similar question: note, this is mildly outdated.  Alright here's some primer info.  Let's start with our best player, our captain, Mark Giordano.  Gio is basically the textbook example of a late bloomer.  Never drafted, got signed by the Flames out of college.  Played some games for the Flames, but didn't like his new contract offer so he went to Russia to play in the KHL for a season (very risky move).  Came back the next season and steadily began his march towards his current position.  He currently leads all defensemen in points while playing against the toughest competition and having right near the most defensive zone starts in the league.  He is an all-around defenseman, strong play at both ends of the rink.  He is a decent pick to win the Norris trophy as the league's top defenseman this year.  We've got Hudler, the leader of our forward corps.  He is not injured, he's been experiencing flu-like symptoms lately.  He is having a career year and looks to lead the team in scoring.  Our other keystone on defense is the young TJ Brodie.  He plays alongside Giordano and has found more of a scoring touch this season (he still lacks a bit of finish when shooting, but he is excellent at skating the puck all the way from the defensive zone to the offensive zone).  Brodie seems poised to take over the helm of number 1 defenseman once Gio eventually succumbs to old age.  Next, our rookies.  Sean Monahan and Johnny Gaudreau lead our solid young crop of forwards.  Monahan is building off a strong rookie season where he scored 22 goals, and looks to top that this season.  He has greatly improved his two-way game; he was used to check the opponents top line for the vast majority of this season (due to Mikael Backlund's abdominal injury).  He was quite sheltered last season, so even if he does not record more points, this is a huge improvement for Monahan.  Johnny Gaudreau has lived up to his college hype and has emerged as a Calder trophy contender this year as one of the league's top rookies.  He has ridiculous stick-handling and amazing vision of the ice.  He is one of or the smallest player in the league, but his great vision and general elusiveness make him very hard for opponents to check.  He is sneaky; currently seventh in the league in takeaways.  He is clean; zero penalty minutes with 50 games played.  He is currently second in rookie scoring.  He is one of the biggest reasons to get excited about the Flames' future.  Sam Bennett was drafted 4th overall by the Flames, despite being the top-rated player for most of the season by Central Scouting.  Brian Burke (president of hockey ops) says he is our organizations' top prospect.  Another player of note: Mikael Backlund.  While he is not a premier scorer, he is our best forward in terms of puck-possession play.  He had a career year last season but was unfortunately hampered by injury this season (and now illness).  He is by far the best Flame at skating the puck into the offensive zone.  He isn't extremely fast or amazing at stick-handling but he somehow avoids the neutral zone trap better than almost anyone.  Dennis Wideman is a journeyman defenseman who has regained his confidence, his work ethic, and consequently, his scoring touch.  In terms of team history, we were one of the top teams in the late 80s, alongside our biggest historical and geographical rivals, the Oilers.  We won the Cup in '89, our only Stanley Cup victory.  Our current biggest rival is the Canucks.  We won our last game against them, but we have an abysmal record vs. them recently.  We had a story-book run to the Cup in '04, eventually losing to the Lightning in game seven.  We very nearly won in game six, with the alleged ""IT WAS IN"" moment, but no goal was called on the ice and the play was not reviewed.  We eventually lost that game and game seven.  During that series the ""C [sea] of Red"" came about where our stadium would be flooded by red jerseys and tee shirts.  The ""Red Mile"" down our largest bar district, 17th Ave, also became popular with revelers.  Team historical greats include Al MacInnis: over a point a game as a defenseman (with over 800 games played for the Flames) and a 100MpH shot with a wooden stick.  He is often cited as having likely the hardest shot of all time if you adjust for the advantages of modern equipment (Iafrate being the other).  In my opinion, he is the best player to ever wear the uniform.  Lanny Mcdonald led the team to their only cup and also holds the club record for most goals in a season with 66.  Jarome Iginla leads the team in games played, goals and points.  He eventually was traded during the lockout season to pursue a cup.  We all love him and his iconic forehead crease.  Miika Kiprusoff (Kipper) leads the team in goaltender wins.  Expect his jersey in the rafters in the coming years.  In terms of overall team outlook, we are an up-and-coming team that was recently in the draft basement but is playing into a playoff spot.  We have quite bad possession stats, but somehow we always come back to win in the third period or overtime.  Holy shit I just wrote a small essay.  EDIT: Just to add, the Flames botched their talent in the late 80s/early 90s to a massive degree.  A mildly disgruntled young (and already producing) Brett Hull was traded for scrap parts.  Later, Gilmour was traded to the Leafs (alonside Jamie Macoun) for more garbage.  The Flames failed to match an offer sheet by St. Louis on Al MacInnis, which sent the Flame (probably a top five or six d-man of all time) away, and with him, the franchise."
CalgaryFlames,3b9n2s,Aplicado,2,Sat Jun 27 05:25:54 2015 UTC,"Scrap parts.   I would trade 90 goal Wayne fucking Gretzky for a cup every fucking time. Hull wasn't guaranteed to be great, and those scraps brought veteran stability for the cup.  Kids these days."

CalgaryFlames,3b9n2s,jigglefest2,2,Sat Jun 27 03:50:05 2015 UTC,I actually independently came to those two conclusions already! The 'nucks were embarrassing during our 2011 series
CalgaryFlames,3b9n2s,catsfive,2,Sat Jun 27 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"Ill try to answer all of your areas :)  My favourite play of the flames (which was before my time) is Theo fluerys OT winner against the oilers in game 6, I can't remember the year ('86 I think)  Another amazing play is ""the shift"" by iginla in the '04 playoffs.   Best players besides the ones you listed, I'd go with fluery, Vernon, kipper, and haken loob.   Worst players: we went a long stretch without a good first round pick. We had some busts such as Irving, nemisz, and some would say Sven baerschi.  Rivals: fuck the oilers and fuck the canucks. We also like to hate the kings and the ducks, but not as much.  Upcoming prospects: we have a very promising goalie prospect named Joni ortio who is Finnish (like kipper) who will likely be playing in the NHL next year. On defence we have sieloff, Morrison and wotherspoon. Forwards we have Emile porier & Morgan  klimchuk as the main two, Marcus granlund is also up and coming.   It was a quick recap of your questions, if you have any more, don't hesitate to ask me :)"

The '04 series vs. Vancouver was one for the ages because it went to 7 and we won in OT/their rink, and I think at the time most Flames fans really had.. low expectations I suppose? Being a sixth seed and all. That group defined grit and toughness, they were incredible. Iginla was like a super hero, a leader. He will always be adored by Flames fans.  Worst players? Nobody really stands out. Fans kind of turned on Phaneuf after his rookie year I guess? He was gifted as an offensive d-man but he really lacked defensively and was pegged for doing stuff with Conroy's wife or something. He was shipped out to Toronto for a bunch of players, including Matt Stajan who we now refer to as ""Matty Franchise.""  Rivals are basically anyone in the pacific division but Vancouver and Edmonton obviously stand out. Vancouver especially since they have been a good team for so many years now and we match up well against them, but I think the rivalry with Edmonton might flourish again with McDavid/Reinhart coming into the fold.  Future: Most of our team is around that 22-25 age and fans from other teams say Calgary has potential to be very scary. Bennett, Gaudreau, Hamilton, Monahan, Poirier, Wotherspoon. Lots of good kids. The way Calgary plays is really something - heart, grit, teamwork, 60 full minutes. Last year we were truly exceptional at comebacks in the 3rd period.  The C of Red is really, really incredible.   This video always hits me in the feels when I want to relive the '04 run as well.  And who could forget Montador's winner vs. SJ in '04 R.I.P.  Fleury's OT winner + celly in 1991  Gelinas OT winner vs. Vancouver Game 7 in '04  Gelinas OT winner vs. Detroit Game 6 in '04  Gelinas was truly fucking incredible that year, bordering on magical. He was a wizard.  Stajan scores the goal that defeats Vancouver in '15  Gaudreau forces overtime vs. Anaheim in '15 with virtually no time left  Backlund's OT winner vs. Anaheim Game 3 in '15  Incredible shootout deke by Schlemko vs. Boston in '14-'15 better known as ""The Schlemko"""
CalgaryFlames,3b9n2s,Nine-Foot-Banana,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:39:58 2015 UTC,"04 is when I became a Flames fan. I was 13 and chose the Canucks as my team to win in the first round. (I live in Ontario and wanted a team to cheer for). Queue game 7, Flames beat Nucks in OT and since I had no real allegiance i jumped onto the Calgary bandwagon and rode it all the way here 11yrs later. All the hardships I endured because I loved Iggy and Kipper are now worth it. This team is playing with such fire right now."

Stajan is like Rich Peverly in that he's just a great dude and everyone wants to see him do well.  We hate the Canucks more than the oilers because they're actually a threat and canucks fans are douchebags whereas oil fans are just sad. I think we all want to see the Oil get better again and a return to the Alberta graveyard where touring teams lose up there and down here before winning in Van.  We love Bob Hartley. We like but are suspicious of Brian Burke. The jury is still out on treliving but his stock really climbed today.

We have a huge fan base within the city, probably one of the strongest in the league %wise, but we have very few full-time fans outside the immediate area.  The Oilers are older and had a dynasty to get them fans.  The Flames might've been in the same position had the Oilers not been one step ahead of a very, very good Flames group from the late 80s to early 90s."

I think he was on a WHL team if I'm not mistaken. I remember the buzz about the kid every time he stepped on the ice. I'm younger than he is, by maybe 7 years or so.  EDIT: Yeah! He was on the Racers. I just checked it out. We lived in EDM at the time, but cheering for the Oilers never stuck with me. I remember once we also went to an Oilers/Minnesota game and I cheered that the Oilers lost. LOL. It was the WHL days, I forget their team, but my dad bought me a pennant from the Minnesota team. Their logo was a small boy angel with wings and his skates untied. That pennant hung in my bedroom until we moved to SK."

CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,cpbrowner,16,Fri Jun 26 14:25:13 2015 UTC,WHAAAAT?!? DOUGIE HAMILTON? DETAILS PLS COME ON TWITTER
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,SgtFinnish,12,Fri Jun 26 19:13:26 2015 UTC,Yeeeeeaaah Babbbbbbyyyyy! You need to make some updates to the graph. My suggestion:  1st DOUGIE  2nd FUCKING   2nd HAMILTON!
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,locoenchilada,6,Fri Jun 26 19:46:13 2015 UTC,DONE. Real good idea haha
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Rightside19,12,Fri Jun 26 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thinks Ottawa completely fleeced Buffalo in that trade? I mean a 21st pick, for a goalie that wasn't going to see much ice for you, and Legwand."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,thoriginal,7,Fri Jun 26 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Could very well work out on Ottawa's end in this deep draft. Lehner could be a bust, but it's an immediate upgrade for Buffalo. Lol Lindback."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Driize,2,Fri Jun 26 14:48:10 2015 UTC,plus gets rid of a bloated contract and frees up ~5mil cap space.  e- mobile is hard
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,WeightOfTheheNewYear,2,Fri Jun 26 15:21:11 2015 UTC,Gotta sign Hoffman
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Rooster697,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:45:31 2015 UTC,Hoffman is signed.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,3,Fri Jun 26 17:07:11 2015 UTC,No he is not.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Rideyn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:53:36 2015 UTC,Fuck I'm getting Hammond and Hoffman mixed up.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,BN_Flames_Fan,5,Fri Jun 26 18:19:41 2015 UTC,I think we won't know who wins that trade until three years. Buffalo could have very well won but Ottawa could have won. Or it could both be a lose lose trade. It's a high risk high reward move by Buffalo
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,3,Fri Jun 26 15:19:58 2015 UTC,Yeah we will have to wait and see if Lehner becomes the next Bishop first haha.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,fearoftheduck,3,Fri Jun 26 15:05:37 2015 UTC,"This is going to be one of those trades that we won't know for a while -- If Ottawa gets a Jessiman out of #21, no one will look back on this and think Buffalo got fleeced. On the other hand, if Ottawa gets Erik Karlsson out of #21, everyone will wonder what Buffalo was thinking."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,AznSparks,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely makes things interesting when it comes to Lack and Talbot too, their price just jumped for sure."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,powerful_owl,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"I think this will be a trade that works out for both teams. Ottawa got a 1st rounder (whether or not it pans out) for Legwand, who didn't really work out in Ottawa and Lehner, who was 3rd in the depth chart despite being clearly better than Anderson.   Buffalo gets a solid goalie in Lehner who may or may not be a #1. Either way they need another goalie. I'm interested to see if they will re-sign Lindback and go with the 1a 1b or ride Lehner as their #1 and use Johnson as backup. They also get Legwand to add some experience and leadership to a young team, not a great player and in his late stages of his career, but can help out the Sabres. He will probably slot in as a #2 centre to add some stability to their young guys."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Dramon,8,Fri Jun 26 18:32:36 2015 UTC,"What the fuck Soderberg got 5 years, 4.75 AAV. That's disgusting.   Backlund deal was UNREAL when you compare it to that."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,MasteroftheHallows,5,Fri Jun 26 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"Soderberg had the highest assists/60 in Boston, other than Bergeron, in the last two seasons. He gets some shit that he really doesn't deserve.  Combine that with possibly playing on a line with the best triggerman sniper in the NHL (Tanguay has a career 18.91% shooting percentage... on 1500 shots), and you've got a dynamite second line."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,The_Art_of_Dying,7,Fri Jun 26 18:26:06 2015 UTC,Could someone point me to an ELI5 level explanation on how the draft/trade system works.  It's never been a bit of the game I've paid much attention to (preferring watching Canadians beating the shit out of each other and so on) but I want to know more.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,MasteroftheHallows,2,Fri Jun 26 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft  Sorry for not better explaining, I myself don't know the format 100% and have wrist problems so I can't type a huge amount"

CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,WeightOfTheheNewYear,5,Sat Jun 27 00:27:42 2015 UTC,"So the ""aggression"" of acquiring talbot was probably a distraction from the possible true trade of dougie to keep others from bloating the price?   What I wonder now is, do we get rid of a dman and/or a goalie as well and the talbot trade is still in the works?"
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,ThatGoalieKid,6,Fri Jun 26 19:50:11 2015 UTC,I've been pushing for us to pick Kylington but Dougie is so much better
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Fythian,2,Fri Jun 26 20:03:30 2015 UTC,And look what ended up happening!
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,alivirji,2,Sat Jun 27 15:35:34 2015 UTC,I just woke up oh my god!!! It was my bday yesterday honestly this is awesome
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,5,Sat Jun 27 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"Dang, Edmonton got that Connor McDavid guy. I was really hoping we could scoop him up with our remaining second round draft pick."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,alivirji,4,Fri Jun 26 23:21:55 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT!   GIO-brodie Russell-Hamilton Wotherspoon-Wideman  Our Defence just got a million times better.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,rorydaniel,2,Fri Jun 26 19:49:09 2015 UTC,I would say arguably the best in Canada right now.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,alivirji,4,Fri Jun 26 22:50:09 2015 UTC,"So the Flames got Hamilton without giving up a roster player and are pushing for a goaltender.   Does this signal to anyone else that the Flames are moving to the final phase of their rebuild?   I mean, they have a good crop of forwards and now a very solid defensive core. The only questionable part is goaltending."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,enag7,5,Fri Jun 26 19:57:23 2015 UTC,"So, anyone else think trading Wideman would be really smart (assuming we get a good deal)? If we retain salary, then a 56 point right handed dman could be worth a high 2nd or late 1st. With Hamilton on the right side, we really have no need for him (Gio-Brodie, Russell-Hamilton, Schlemko, Engelland, Wotherspoon, Morrison is really good)."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,AKAdyje,3,Fri Jun 26 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"(I've been saying this for two weeks, even before he became completely expendable)"
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,theFlamingRaven,3,Sat Jun 27 00:00:38 2015 UTC,I've been saying that since the goddamn deadline.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,heidamazeballs,6,Sat Jun 27 00:05:31 2015 UTC,If the Flames could trade up tomorrow and get one of J. Roy or Kylington I would be one happy man.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,TheHowlingFish,3,Sat Jun 27 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"Or Bracco or Sprong. We got a young, big, elite right handed dman today, so now we just need to solidify the right side with some high end skill (regardless of size), and we will basically be loaded at every position."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,trent-henderson,2,Sat Jun 27 05:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, I expect us to pick a forward in the second round. Hell maybe even move up to get Sprong. Picking defensemen now isn't as big of a need. Unless there's someone that falls that the scouts really, really like, you pick by positional need with the next pick. The talent gap is too small and unpredictable at this point to not try and balance out the farm system."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Rfilsinger,2,Sat Jun 27 07:21:34 2015 UTC,Yes please.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,DaCodster,4,Sat Jun 27 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"This is especially special for me. I had the opportunity to watch Dougie Hamilton for a couple years when he was playing for Niagara. He is such an exciting player and was one of my favourites on the Ice Dogs. Now, he can be one of my favourites on the Flames.  Nice sidebar pic btw."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,donksdonksdonks,4,Fri Jun 26 20:10:38 2015 UTC,Would be nice to have a pick with Konecky and Connor still available!  But.................DOUGIE FUCKIN HAMILTON!  Edit: scratch Connor

CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Rooster697,4,Sat Jun 27 01:47:54 2015 UTC,"So I was at the Draft, Boston got booed the worst, Toronto was the 2nd. Sorry my mistake, Gary Bettman got booed the most. The Calgary table looked really quiet haha not much page flipping or typing. Was sitting beside eichels best friends/entourage, there was sighes of relief when Edmonton didn't pull any crazy moves and took Mcdavid. Travis Konecny had an entire section of family friends cheering him on haha. It was pretty rowdy n fun"
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,teckhz,3,Sat Jun 27 03:58:00 2015 UTC,"NYR have been offered a 1st rounder for Talbot. Not from Oilers or Flames. Dallas, SJ and Florida still involved. 1st isn't a deal maker."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Rooster697,5,Fri Jun 26 17:10:18 2015 UTC,Good.  I would not want to pay a 1st rounder for him.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,alivirji,3,Fri Jun 26 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"Hope it's possible to trade late into round 1. Love getting Hamilton, but would also love to pick in round 1 in this draft."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,WeightOfTheheNewYear,2,Sat Jun 27 00:29:24 2015 UTC,"depends what they're looking for and who's available. if Barzal falls further or Connor, it might be worth it, but at after those guys the skill level doesnt really drop off that much. for that reason I could see them just waiting it out and taking whos available"
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,DaCodster,3,Sat Jun 27 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"There's still a few good players available - kylington, Roy, Merkley. I hope we trade up for one of them"
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,teckhz,2,Sat Jun 27 02:17:56 2015 UTC,Merk is gone
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,teckhz,2,Sat Jun 27 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I posted that comment after the 29th pick. If we could get kylington, Roy, or sprong without giving too much that would be awesome."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:07:22 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing, we should package some later picks with our 2nd for an earlier 2nd"
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,teckhz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:17:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather trade Wideman.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,3,Sat Jun 27 05:41:12 2015 UTC,If calgary can get a trade for some second rounders I will be so happy. There are so many quality guys left. Guys like Spencer who we were projected to take with our first second rounder aren't going to be picked until 55-65.  If we could grab 30-45 pick we would be set on D.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,teckhz,6,Sat Jun 27 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"""@DarrenDreger: NYR are meeting now. Flames are pushing hard for Talbot. Oilers, Stars and Sharks still in mix. Two 2nds plus get it done?  But WHY?!? If NYR is asking for a 1st rounder then no way this gets done. I don't want to be giving more than one of our 2nds away either. I hope we're just blowing smoke to drive up the price.   However I do trust BT. Just the thought of Talbot coming in is fucked. Sounds like Ramo is out the door cuz no deal is close, so Hiller or Ortio would be our the door next. Probably Hiller.   If that's the case our cap would drop even more, who would we sign or trade for to bring it back up?"
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Dramon,3,Fri Jun 26 14:28:41 2015 UTC,It just doesn't make sense to me why we are going for him.Not that I think Talbot is bad or anything but his sample size is small and he's just been a backup his career is not what we need. Also the price is too high for him.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,bsellis14,4,Fri Jun 26 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"If we traded two of our 2nds for Talbot I wouldn't be too upset, but anything more than that is crazy. Talbot looks promising so I wouldn't mind running with him and Ortio next season. We could sign Williams or Beleskey to 2-3 year deals to bring our cap back up."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,marbsarebad,7,Fri Jun 26 14:39:44 2015 UTC,Beleskey is asking for WAY too much money. More money than what Hudler is making. Not okay.  Let's see what Williams is asking for.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,AKAdyje,2,Fri Jun 26 14:40:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I totally agree about Beleskey. As long as we only sign him for like 2 years though it shouldn't affect us too much.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,rpawson5771,2,Fri Jun 26 14:42:28 2015 UTC,But why would we sign a player who wants that much money with so little to show for it?
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,bumbuff,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"True, in terms of cap hit though it wouldn't really affect us if the term is short. The only negative I see is that it gives the wrong message to the rest of our players as to what we would be willing to pay them."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,donksdonksdonks,2,Fri Jun 26 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Signing expensive, bad contracts is how you get halfway to being stuck in Philadelphia's version of cap hell (See: Grossmann), and signing long-term, worthwhile contracts (Monahan, Gaudreau, Giordano) is how we'll get the other half (from Chicago, LA, or New York's version of cap hell).   We can avoid this whole situation starting by just... not signing Beleskey . The Anaheim sub doesn't want him signed for more than 4m, and they saw far more of his games than I did and have a hometown attachment. No way I want him for more than Anaheim's GM would pay."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,RayPing,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"No I totally agree. I don't want Beleskey for any more than 2.5/year, which isn't going to happen. I was just saying that signing him to a 2 year deal wouldn't kill us."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,WeightOfTheheNewYear,2,Fri Jun 26 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, Treliving isn't just doing these trades for this year, but he is also keeping in mind that he has to re-sign Monahan, Gaudreau, AND Bennett next year. He would like to have a lot of cap space to be comfortable for those signings, as well as any extras. Treliving is look at how his micro transactions will impact the macro part of his decisions."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,rorydaniel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:57:48 2015 UTC,Bennett has 2 years left
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,2,Sat Jun 27 07:04:44 2015 UTC,I don t get the asking price for a 27 year old goalie who was decent behind one of the league's best defense.  Tree better not give the Rangers 2 2nds for him.  He better not.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,WeightOfTheheNewYear,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:32:11 2015 UTC,I'm with you.

CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,superdude99,2,Fri Jun 26 17:31:28 2015 UTC,"This is also management saying, ""we like our young players that we have currently"""
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Rooster697,2,Fri Jun 26 20:28:10 2015 UTC,Well so far no one has really fallen yet. I am surprised how high Zacha went though but I guess some people had him ranked pretty high
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Galaxy91122,2,Sat Jun 27 00:18:44 2015 UTC,Watching Boston mess up their 3 picks makes this even sweeter.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,rpawson5771,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:00:16 2015 UTC,They messed them up
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,superdude99,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:23:05 2015 UTC,"They got progressively so much worse. Zboril was a fairly good pick, DeBrusk? Okay a bit of a stretch. Then suddenly the last pick which came out of fucking nowhere. I haven't seen much of him, but his stats are completely unimpressive. Nobody I saw had him ranked or mocked into the first."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,superdude99,3,Sat Jun 27 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"Senyshyn's a solid second rounder -- lots of speed, and that's about it...  It looks like the Bruins just had nothing prepared for those other two picks, and they paid for it. I expect their entire team is pissed about that Senyshyn pick."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,canadam,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:31:49 2015 UTC,That's exactly what it looks like. Theybwere unprepared. They picked the guys they were on their radar for their second picks. They didn't have three or four guys at the 12-20 ranges which is ridiculous
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,gaganminhas,2,Sat Jun 27 02:53:44 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we can trade and get a late 1St. Or atleast two seconds. That would be nice.
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,canadam,2,Sat Jun 27 01:24:00 2015 UTC,Anyone remember the last time the Flames fleeced a team as bad as we just did?
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,3,Sat Jun 27 02:04:46 2015 UTC,honestly no
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,WeightOfTheheNewYear,2,Sat Jun 27 04:20:56 2015 UTC,If we can pick a projected first rounder tomorrow Tre is a god

CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,teckhz,2,Fri Jun 26 20:11:04 2015 UTC,Here's one for you guys. Do we make another push for O'Reilly?
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,6,Fri Jun 26 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"For the cost he will be, pass. Think our biggest concern is acquiring a RW and D."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,Roughly6Owls,4,Fri Jun 26 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"Well ROR can play RW, but I agree, it would have to be a deal most likely involving the 15th and a prospect like Poirier."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,mondo911,5,Fri Jun 26 15:32:11 2015 UTC,And I want to keep Poirier in our plans
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,teckhz,4,Fri Jun 26 15:33:50 2015 UTC,"I do too, but I would love to have ROR. He's a young, bonafide top six player - on the fringe of a first line player. Also a great possession driver."
CalgaryFlames,3b72k4,blink0r,2,Fri Jun 26 15:56:34 2015 UTC,I would definitely trade our 15th pick and decent prospect like poirer for ROR in a heartbeat

CalgaryFlames,3b9brf,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Sat Jun 27 02:26:26 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for Beauvillier, but he's gone.   Now I'm hoping for Jeremy Bracco, a small, supremely skilled forward who put up phenomenal stats with the USDP. He could be Gaudreau 2.0.   The Flames have said their top priority is adding skill and this guy has more than most players in the draft.  If not, there are some intruguing defencemen: Roy, Kylington, Andersson.  So many teams went off the board the first round there should be some surprisingly good players left around in the second."
CalgaryFlames,3b9brf,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Sat Jun 27 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"If Bracco is available, I'd be ecstatic of we take him. Now that we solidified our right defensive future, a highly skilled RW would be a perfect fit. And he's not THAT small, he's 5'10"", Kane/Johnson size. Stats wise he's a top 10 forward in the draft tho. I don't think he'll fall that far unfortunately, although the off the board picks make anything possible now."
CalgaryFlames,3b9brf,catsfive,2,Sat Jun 27 03:40:46 2015 UTC,"53rd pick plus a third rounder to the Bruins for David Pastrnak, Tuuka Rask, and the tears of every fan in Boston."

CalgaryFlames,3b9brf,Roughly6Owls,2,Sat Jun 27 02:39:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The Flames need a bottom pairing that can play more than three minutes a night and with Wideman they can spread out the minutes more evenly and keep the top guys from getting too gassed.  Hopefully one of Wotherspoon, Morrison, Nakladal, Schlemko, or someone else can push Engelland to the seventh slot."
CalgaryFlames,3b9brf,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Sat Jun 27 03:50:23 2015 UTC,Wotherspoon's also no longer waiver-exempt -- he'll be in the pressbox or in the line-up next season.

CalgaryFlames,3ba0vo,SmokeyNevada,3,Sat Jun 27 05:25:17 2015 UTC,"Gio and Brodie shoot left, Hamilton and Wideman shoot right.  As great as Gio and Brodie were together last season, I can see Gio-Hamilton and Brodie-Wideman as the top 4.  Russell will probably be paired with Engelland, and Smid when he's not injured, which is really sad because the poor guy will get absolutely shelled on a nightly basis dealing with boat anchors as his partners.  I'd much rather they find some way to toss Engelland and re-sign Schlemko, using Russell-Schlemko as a shutdown pairing.  That would let them roll close to even minutes for all three pairings, based on zone starts."
CalgaryFlames,3ba0vo,lancemeszaros,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:43:36 2015 UTC,AMAZINGLY! That's how I see it
CalgaryFlames,3ba0vo,WeightOfTheheNewYear,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:54:38 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling we're gonna trade Wideman now that we have Hamilton. If it gets us a higher 2nd, I'm completely for it. A career season at age 32 is exactly the time to sell high. We could also trade him in the early season if Wotherspoon, Nakladal or Morrison are ready to take up his role with Schlemko.   As for the lines, I really like your 5v5 pairings, but on the 2nd PP, Brodie has way more offensive upside than Russell, so he should be there. On the 2nd PK, both Russell and Hamilton are much more reliable defensively than Schlemko and Egghead. I can see Schlemko taking our Hamilton's PK spot, just so that he can be used more on 5v5/PP, and because Schlemko is actually good defensively, but I can't see Russell not being on the PK.   Smid should be LTIR or bought out. As much as it pains be to say, his injuries have made him way too slow to survive a regular role in today's NHL, and we already have a slow, tough 7th dman in Engelland. And if we want to succeed possession wise, then we need to play Engelland as little as possible, and thus Smid doesn't really have a place."
CalgaryFlames,3b9zht,laureth-23,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:07:40 2015 UTC,"He didn't see a future with Boston . This guys a stud man. The amount of points and minutes he played before turning 22 is amazing. He's was much needed, we have a top pairing dmen for the next 10 years+"
CalgaryFlames,3b9zht,gaganminhas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:17:07 2015 UTC,"I think he probaly just didn't like it there, Maybe being from Toronto , maybe being young and forced into too much pressure and responsibility, Alot of players thrive on that but at the same time it could be a lot to handle for a younger player that isnt used to it and lets be honest Boston fans arn't always the kindest of people, maybe that got in his head a little bit after each mistake, maybe a whole lot of other things but by the sounds of it was more assett management on Bostons part, Everyone there is pissed but when you hear that they couldn't come to terms with a deal they were comfortable with could tell you he didn't want to play there and was hoping to get a 2-3 year deal and hit UFA, Instead of waiting for him to jump ship in 2-3 years for nothing might as well invest in some early draft picks now that could be ready to play in 2-3 years instead of him just leaving.   As much as everyone says Boston got fleeced on the trade, I think their GM was backed into a bit of a corner and got what he thought was best in the long term for the team. Everyone has been talking about how deep this draft is (I know their picks are still questionable) but it seems like he went all in this year to make it a quicker transition into another cup contending team.  I mean we saw it happen with Baertchi - I don't consider him on the same level as Hamilton but he still showed promise and we had to give him away for a 2nd rounder because we really had no other choice and needed to capitalize as much as we could from it."
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,Suzaku94,9,Fri Jun 26 19:55:27 2015 UTC,I think this would be a great time to trade Wides.
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,trent-henderson,8,Fri Jun 26 20:04:18 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think he had great chemistry with the young guys and compliments Gaudreau's play style. Our offensive defensemen are what keep other teams on their heels

CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,logan_izer10,5,Fri Jun 26 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"Agree. If you could flip him for great value, do it. But I don't know if I actively pursue his dismissal"
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,Kopeke,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:29:49 2015 UTC,exactly. tbh i think his value has reached its peak. i say flip him at the draft for a first rounder.
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,existential_poop,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:49:02 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if we got a first rounder for him.
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,DaCodster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:52:43 2015 UTC,Trade back into round 1 maybe? That would be nice. This would make today even better.
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,NewmanTheScofflaw,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:51:40 2015 UTC,Not sure you can get anyone much better thats the issue. He may have peaked but he is an offensive styled defensemen with chemistry with our forwards. Hamilton trade made sense because there was a gap in the defensive core. But Russell and Wides are good defensemen. You create a hole unless you get a proven player in their place. Wideman couldn't get you anything more than a bottom half 1st rounder and the rate of success drops off very quickly then.
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,trent-henderson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"We don't need anyone better. We have Gio, Brodie, Hamilton, Russell, Engelland, Smid all under contract, and Wotherspoon is going to be looking for a spot."

CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,Roughly6Owls,4,Sat Jun 27 08:16:33 2015 UTC,"Guys, use the tables -- the mods made them pretty for just this occasion.  Here's a depth chart based on usage, handedness, and age at the bottom (i.e. Nakladal > Morrison), assuming we don't make any more trades and re-sign Schlemko.    Left Handers Right Handers    Giordano Hamilton   Brodie Wideman   Russell Engelland   Schlemko Nakladal   Wotherspoon Morrison    Things I notice -- Nakladal appears to make Engelland redundant, while Russell's got more value as a trade piece than as our third line defenseman... but he also makes retaining Schlemko unlikely if we can't move him today.  So, my prediction: if the Flames don't trade one of Wideman or Russell today, Schlemko moves on. :("
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,logan_izer10,3,Fri Jun 26 21:39:39 2015 UTC,I say   Gio - Brodie  Russel - Hamilton  Wideman - England/Schlemko  With Wideman as a PP specialist
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,juridiculous,6,Fri Jun 26 20:00:05 2015 UTC,"Gio/Wideman on PP1  Brodie/Hamilton on PP2.  (Russell was so slow on the PP breakout, and is more suited to the defensive side of the game, so this gives everyone a better utilization.)"
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,doubtfulalpha,2,Fri Jun 26 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"True, I'd still say he's a damn good player all around. Super clutch sometimes."
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,APoopCramp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:50:14 2015 UTC,Personally I'd switch up Russel and Wideman there.
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,chodes_r_us,3,Sat Jun 27 00:50:37 2015 UTC,Gio - Hamilton  Brodie - Wideman  Russell - Engelland  (Let's be honest Engelland isn't going anywhere under Treliving) Russell's speed could probably cover for Engellands speed issues and Engellands size covers for Russell's smaller stature  Brodie gets to play with  50 point defenceman. So jacked for this
CalgaryFlames,3b8bgh,TJYoshi,2,Fri Jun 26 20:11:13 2015 UTC,Brodie was already playing with a 50 point defenseman

I initially wanted us to pick Konecny, Merkley, (Both went later than expected) or Roy, or even taken a chance on Kylington (Both still available).  Our blue line seems solidified for a while, but another D prospect would be great.  Otherwise, with such an apparently deep draft, I think they should draft positionally (RW) and improve our prospect pool."

He could still walk after a year.. I would much rather invest in prospects or look for something else we have a need for. eg. Top 6 forward
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,TheFifthsWord,7,Fri Jun 26 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"I think I might be less upset if it is a 2nd and a conditional second, or one 2nd this year, one next year. If we give up two 2nds THIS year, I will be pissed."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,superdude99,2,Fri Jun 26 15:15:28 2015 UTC,I would be fine with that too. We have a lot of draft picks this year for a deep draft. Use them as they are intended and draft or trade up in the draft.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,TheFifthsWord,5,Fri Jun 26 15:25:51 2015 UTC,"Given the Flames talked to Talbot prior to any trade, I would think the Flames would not be pursuing him unless the meeting gave them confidence that he fits the teams plans and could be re-signed. The Flames aren't walking into it blind at least."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,rpawson5771,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:32:09 2015 UTC,If we get him for 2 seconds I'll be happy. I'd rather have him and Ortio next year and flip Hiller for a top 6 forward

CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,jeffwhit,3,Fri Jun 26 15:18:34 2015 UTC,The best you could possibly expect for Hiller is getting one 2nd back.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,marbsarebad,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:50:50 2015 UTC,Talbot looked good because he played behind one of the best defense in the league.  He's gonna suck with us.  I guarantee it. This trade is 100% counterintuitive to the rebuild.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,canadam,2,Fri Jun 26 15:26:40 2015 UTC,Not 100%. He's a young goalie that has shown some serious potential. Finding guys like that has the ability to help a rebuild.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,marbsarebad,0,Fri Jun 26 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"He's 27, and only played 57 games in his career, behind the best rangers team in nearly 20 years.  Plus, we have no idea if he'll re-sign.  Two second rounders in a deep draft is worth waaaaaay more than 1 year of a mediocre goalie, especially since we gave three fucking goalies already."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,canadam,2,Fri Jun 26 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"I assume since they're already talking to him, that if a deal was made he would re-sign. And 27 for a goalie isn't old. I agree the Rangers have great team defense, but goalies are always wild cards. Remember when we traded for that Kiprusoff guy?"
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,marbsarebad,-3,Fri Jun 26 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"They're not allowed to talk contracts with him, so that is am incorrect assumption.  Also, stories like Kippers are once in a blue moon, and I don't think this is one of them.  *we also only spent 1 2nd round pick on kippers, which I would gladly spend on Talbot, not 2"
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,Pretty_Fly_For_A_,3,Fri Jun 26 16:42:31 2015 UTC,Actually a great number of goalies dont hit their stride until their late 20s.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,marbsarebad,-2,Fri Jun 26 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"But not ""best goalie in franchise history"" kind of story.  Talbot might be a good goalie in the league, he might not, he might not even re-sign with us, and I don't think that is worth 2 second rounders while we're in a rebuild."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,canadam,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"I know they're not allowed to have specific contract talks, but they're allowed to gauge his personality and broader interests. I'm certain that they use indirect language to establish his interest in re-signing. It would be naive to think otherwise."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,rpawson5771,2,Fri Jun 26 18:28:08 2015 UTC,"The Flames have an idea if he would re-sign with them, since they have met and talked to him without completing a trade yet."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,marbsarebad,-2,Fri Jun 26 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"No, they're not allowed to talk about contracts or money.  They can only talk about his fit with the team.  What if he comes out at the end of next year saying he wants 9 mill, too?"
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,rpawson5771,2,Fri Jun 26 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"I never said they talked specifics on contract terms like dollars or length. I just said the Flames talked to him, and based on that discussion the Flames would have some idea on whether he would re-sign with them. As opposed to no idea. Fit with the team would include where he would fit in the team's short term and long term plans, and how the Flames envision using him in that timeframe.    If he comes out at the end of next season and says he wants $9M a year, then the Flames did a bad job not re-signing him right away after January 1 and presumably gave up too much to acquire him.    What if the Flames acquire him for two seconds, then flip Hiller for a second? And then the Flames extend him to a four year contract for a $4M AAV (3/4/4/5)? And then he goes on to win the Vezina, a Conn Smythe, and a Stanley Cup cup over those 4 years? I don't think those things are very likely, but I also have no idea (there's that phrase again) if they'll happen. Just like you have no idea if he'll walk away after next season demanding a $9M contract."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,marbsarebad,-2,Fri Jun 26 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"That sure is a LOT of ifs.  At this current moment we have 3 2nd rounders already, 2 decent goalies and a goalie prospect looking for his break.  We do not, in any way, need Talbot."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,rpawson5771,2,Fri Jun 26 18:16:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are talking a lot of ifs. The difference is that you are talking about ifs like they are absolute certainties (""I guarantee (Talbot) is going to suck with us"" ""This trade is 100% counterintuitive to the rebuild""). Which is what I take issue with.    Also, stop counting Ramo as a goalie with the Flames. He's gone to UFA in 4.5 days.    Finally, as mentioned several times, consideration of this trade involves looking beyond the immediate time frame. We don't need Talbot now. We need another NHL goalie starting next season, and probably for 2-3 seasons after that as well. Acquiring one via  a trade this offseason is just one option to explore."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,WeightOfTheheNewYear,3,Fri Jun 26 18:20:39 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that BT is just in on him because Edm is and he wants to drive up the price. That was the early rumour. It would be a great Ploy. But I don't we need Talbot who has played all of 38 games in the NHL.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,rpawson5771,2,Fri Jun 26 15:15:46 2015 UTC,57 regular season NHL games + 2 NHL playoff games.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,WeightOfTheheNewYear,5,Fri Jun 26 15:30:44 2015 UTC,Sorry he played 38 games last year. I strand corrected. I still don't want him. If we are going with a unproven asset then let's go with the younger cheaper option in Jones.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,Roughly6Owls,3,Fri Jun 26 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"We're not going to get Jones in the division, unfortunately.  I also am a little hesitant about taking goalies out of LA -- look how Bernier and Scrivens turned out."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,WeightOfTheheNewYear,3,Fri Jun 26 15:57:55 2015 UTC,Well Bernier carried Toronto to almost a playoff spot last year and Scribbles is a good goalie with horrible D in front of him. They are hardly bad goaltenders
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,Roughly6Owls,3,Fri Jun 26 16:01:15 2015 UTC,"They aren't bad goaltenders, but everyone's talking about how Talbot is overpriced because he plays in front of the Rangers D -- Jones plays behind Drew ""Perennial Norris Nominee"" Doughty, and Jake Muzzin/Alec Martinez aren't slouches either."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,WeightOfTheheNewYear,2,Fri Jun 26 16:05:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not worried about the defence Talbot or Jones have. I'm looking at age and Ceiling. And I bet the same package that Talbot is going for would get Jones and probably a third. If we are going to gamble on a player then let's do the high risk high reward gamble. Not the high risk meh reward.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,marbsarebad,0,Fri Jun 26 16:08:13 2015 UTC,It wasn't a rumor.  It's what we were all hoping.

CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,g_gundy,2,Fri Jun 26 15:38:03 2015 UTC,Uh...why???  This doesn't make sense to me at all.
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,Roughly6Owls,2,Fri Jun 26 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this is part of a package deal, one where we're taking back a big (but worthwhile) cap dump -- Marc Staal's my dream choice (or McDonagh, but if he's not untouchable Sather's an idiot) to save the Rangers from cap hell, probably sending back Russell (unfortunately).  I'm really hoping it's not 2 2nds for Talbot straight up, unless we've also got Hiller going to Edmonton for the 33rd."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,Kellervo,2,Fri Jun 26 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"Uhh, there is no way in hell New York would give us Staal or McDonagh as a 'cap dump'. Those guys are the cornerstones of their blue line, we'd be giving them even more for one of those two than we would for Talbot!  I think it's more likely that we see a package deal, as the analysts are saying we're not offering our 1st and that it's off the table."
CalgaryFlames,3b76nc,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:05:08 2015 UTC,"I'm using cap dump in the sense of a large contract attached to any player, not necessarily a bad player with a contract that is too large for what they contribute, and I did say that it would be part of a package deal.  Staal's playing on their second line and being paid 5.7m to do so -- he's an amazing player, but for a team that might want to make some moves and needs to lose some cap for flexibility, he's got value leaving and staying.  A trade that brings Staal to Calgary would probably look something like Russell (50% retained)/Ortio/45th/52nd/Prospect (say, Sieloff, or Klimchuk) for Staal/Talbot. We'd be adding a lot of value."

Imagine Ortio, but older, more experienced, and (mostly importantly), way better.   Ramo/Hiller/Ortio have given us league-average goaltending, but Talbot can be dominant."

I love his dry sense of humour, fuck these rumors of trading him. I want him re-signed for another couple of years. He's only 31 and just won the Lady Bing, he's definitely got at least another 2-4 years of being an elite player."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,SkiFreeSasquatch,9,Fri Jun 26 01:26:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this sounds dumb, but why would we need him? We already have a ton of goalies, right?"
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Senortroll,4,Fri Jun 26 01:44:46 2015 UTC,"Presumably if another goalie lands here, it means both Hiller and Ramo are on their way out. We'll see how it plays out."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,rpawson5771,8,Fri Jun 26 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be upset if they were. It's unfortunate to say but the difference between a really good hockey team and a great one is a top tier goalie. Hiller and Ramo are great.. They're NHL level goalies, but they're not top tier.. They're not Kipprusoff.   There is a reason we were the comeback kids last season.. and it's not because our goalies never let anything in."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,DMann420,6,Fri Jun 26 02:17:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think having a great goalie is overrated. Chicago has won three Cups with average goaltending.   An elite goalie with a .925 SV% lets in a goal every 13.33 shots. An average goalie with a .915 SV% lets in a goal every 11.76 shots.   Now, you could spend millions of dollars more in salary and trade sizeable assets for that elite goalie, or you can find a way to reduce the number of shots that your goalie faces by small handful of shots per game. Instead of allowing 26 shots, for example, find a way to allow 23 or 24 and you'll allow the same number of goals: 2.  Basically, someone like Kris Russel or Lance Bouma blocking two or three shots per game gives you the same result as landing an elite goalie."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Fri Jun 26 04:40:29 2015 UTC,"I'd hardly say Crawford is average goaltending. I know his regular season stats are not magnificent, but the guy is one hell of a competitor and just has that attitude you need for a goalie. He's a playoff goaltender. The kind that will make the saves when it matters, but not always be the best when it doesn't kill the team to let one in. Kipper had that same determination, unfortunately we never had a really good team around him besides '04 when we all know it was in."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,BN_Flames_Fan,2,Fri Jun 26 08:14:35 2015 UTC,"Probably could've picked better names than Russell and Bouma if you're talking shot suppression, something they both struggle mightily with."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,fknSamsquamptch,2,Fri Jun 26 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"I thought about that, but while they suck at shot attempt suppression but they're pretty good at suppressing actual shots on net via blocking."

CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Vylan24,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:07:29 2015 UTC,What you're saying is pretty contradictory.   If a goalie lets in a goal every 13.33 shots then you'd have to prevent 13 shots to let in one less goal. It's alot more expensive to pay two really good defensemen than just one really good goalie.
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,DMann420,2,Fri Jun 26 04:47:53 2015 UTC,"If i'm understanding what he's saying, I think it's that it would be cheaper to invest in a D/F that suppresses an extra two shots/game, than a goalie who make two extra saves/game.   Basically allowing 24 shots per game with average goaltending and better shot suppression is more cost effective than elite goaltending and lesser shot suppression."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,juridiculous,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:03:02 2015 UTC,"This is all theoretical though. If it was all a numbers game then we would use computers to find prospects, not scouts. Save percentage is an average of all the shots against them. What's important is having a goalie that can be a brick wall in the games that matter, and those goalies usually have a high save percentage.   1 goal per 13 shots or whatever can mean anything from a dozen shutouts and a couple really bad 4 goal games to exactly 1 goal per 13 shots.. It's just a number and it's not nearly as important as having a goalie that can handle the pressure and stay consistent. Look at Luongo.. He is a great goalie (Jesus forgive me), but he can't handle pressure for shit."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,DMann420,2,Fri Jun 26 05:18:34 2015 UTC,"An elite goalie lets in a goal every 13.33 shots. No goalie at all (a completely empty net) allows a goal every shot.   So yes, if you have no goalie at all, you would need to prevent 13.33 shots per goal saved, relative to having an elite goalie. But I assume you have a goalie of some sort in net - an average one in this case.  The key thing in that case is the difference between an elite goalie (13.33 shots per goal) and an average goalie (11.76 shots per goal). That difference is 1.57 shots per goal.   So if your opponent had an elite goalie and you had an average one, you could outshoot your opponent 13 to 12 and at the end of that period you'd be tied 1-1.  If you had no goalie, you'd have to outshoot them 13-1 to get the same 1-1 result.  Edit: a couple of words."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:27:00 2015 UTC,Think of how shot quality affects your argument... Are the extra shots being blocked of the same caliber as extra saves that an elite goalie is making?  Extra shot blocks are probably of the type that weren't going in anyways.
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,iggyiggyiggy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"Extra shot blocks are probably of the type that weren't going in anyways.   Do you have any evidence to support this? Even if you assume that is 100% true and shot blocks prevent zero goals, it doesn't change the fact that good team defence prevents shots on goal, and thus prevents goals.  A good possession player, say a Mark Giordano or Mikael Backlund, can help your team get the puck to the offensive zone where your opponent isn't going to take any shots at all — blocked or unblocked. A player who is good at defensive zone coverage can keep opponents to the outside, reducing both the shot quality and quantity.  Think about it: a .925 SV% goalie by definition stops 92.5% of shots. A .915 SV% goalie stops 91.5% of shots. The difference is a single percentage point.  If you reduce the number of shots against by a single percentage point, you will save as many goals as if you had an elite goalie, relative to an average one.  Edit: spelling."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"I respect the argument you're trying to make, but there are some mathematical errors here:   Lets just assume there are an average of 30 shots against per game: and thus a .915 goalies lets in 2.55 goals per game. If you reduce shots against by a single percentage point, you will have 29.7 shows against per game (see where you made your mistake here), and with the same goalie will now allow 2.52 goals against per game If your goalie gets a percentage point better (from .915 to .925) you now only allow 2.25 goals against per game (much better!)   I also 100% believe that the extra saves that an elite goalie is making are on extremely high quality chances. So you would absolutely have to adjust for that as well if you're comparing it to shots that a dman can take away."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,iggyiggyiggy,2,Fri Jun 26 20:03:43 2015 UTC,"You are right. I botched the math. You would need to reduce the number of shots from 30 to 26.47 to have the same 2.25 GAA.   And with that, I'd have to concede that's a bigger defensive gap to cover. I do maintain, however, that you can more reliably reduce goals against through better defensive play than by pouring resources into hunting that elusive elite goaltender.   All but the very best goalies are inconsistent. Corey Crawford, for example, had his numbers bounce from one year to the next, posting .924, .917, .926, .903, and .917 save percentages over the his last five years as a starter. He's been great and he's been hot garbage, but he has two Cups because he has a great team in front of him and he's been good enough.  A good goalie is essential. A great goalie is not.  Hiller, by comparison, has ranged between .924 and .910 over the same period.   I also 100% believe that the extra saves that an elite goalie is making are on extremely high quality chances.   So you are saying an elite goalie allows the same number of soft goals but stops more of the difficult ones?   According to War on Ice, the top goalies in terms of stopping shots from high-danger areas last season were Anttii Raanta, Andrei Vasilevsky, Keith Kinkaid, Calvin Pickard, and Jake Allen. (Minimum 240 minutes.)  You need to go down to tenth to find Carey Price, who is sandwiched between Braden Holtby and Roberto Luongo. After Luongo comes Reto Barra, Cam Talbot, Devan Dubnyk, then Joni Ortio.  Anyways, none of this matters now because the Flames are not trading for Talbot now that they traded their picks for Hamilton!"
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Newtothisredditbiz,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:07:35 2015 UTC,That's just not how it works man.. A goalie isn't some board counting shots and once 12.33 shots are made then it opens up and lets the next shot in. Some goalies make shutouts with 40 shots against them.
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,DMann420,3,Fri Jun 26 05:30:14 2015 UTC,"We're talking about averages. A goalie with a 40-save shutout one night (1.00 SV%) is going to let in 4 goals on 20 shots another night (.800 SV%). At the end of the season it averages out to number a that's usually between .900 for the shittiest goalies to about .930 for the most elite ones.  If you're the Buffalo Sabres, who allowed 35.6 shots per game, it won't matter if you have a .925 SV% goalie tandem. You're still going to allow an average of 2.67 goals per game.   A team like LA, who only allowed 27 shots per game, is going to allow an average of only 2.295 goals per game if they have an average goalie tandem with a .915 SV%.   When all is said and done, the team that suppresses shots better is going allow fewer goals and win more games."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Newtothisredditbiz,-1,Fri Jun 26 06:11:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said man.. It just doesn't work like that. It's not robots fixed in place taking shots and a board opening up every 12 shots and letting one in. Different teams have different skills and different play styles.. Sometimes your defense is built to combat that style, sometimes your defense gets danced around. Goalies have good days and bad days.. The numbers game is elitist and generally NEVER works.   Otherwise you could just look at the goalie and look at the average amount of shots a team makes every game then win 100% of the bets you make on the games."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,DMann420,2,Fri Jun 26 06:18:54 2015 UTC,"Except it does work like that, man.  Buffalo allowed the most shots against last season, followed by Toronto, Columbus, and Arizona.  The teams that allowed the most goals last season were Edmonton, Buffalo, Arizona, and Toronto.  Notice that where those teams are in the standings.  If numbers are ""elitist"" and NEVER works, why do teams look at SV% to determine who's a better goalie? Why do teams try to reduce the number of shots against? Why do the teams that score more goals and allow fewer goals win more games?    Otherwise you could just look at the goalie and look at the average amount of shots a team makes every game then win 100% of the bets you make on the games.   Again, you fail to understand the concept of ""average."" If a player averages a point per game, that doesn't mean you will win 100% of bets he will score a point every game. It means that some games he scores more than a point and some games he scores zero, but over 82 games, he will have scored 82 points."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Fri Jun 26 06:47:27 2015 UTC,"That and as a rebuilding team we should be pulling in assets for longer term. Hiller and Ramo both have some decent games left in them, and they could help another team that's struggling between the pipes. If we could get picks/prospects coming back the other way, I'd count that as a win."

CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,mikesulls,2,Fri Jun 26 03:25:18 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the point in signing Talbot. If we sign him then we trade Hiller and let Ramo walk, which I understand, but what for how long are we expecting to keep him? I'd hate to see us trade away our young talent like Ortio or Gillies in the future. Maybe we could trade for Talbot and sign him to another 2 years and see how Ortio stacks up but I'd hate to have some awkward goalie situation like Vancouver's shitshow. I guess our situation is a little different, and maybe I'm putting too much expectation on Gillies and Ortio."
CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,metalhead4,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:55:28 2015 UTC,Maybe they want to ship Hills and Rams and have Talbot and Ortio? I'd like to see Ortio get a shot as #1 though.

CalgaryFlames,3b54rh,g_gundy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:33:20 2015 UTC,I just don't see Talbot as having that huge of an upside. I think both Ortio and Gillies have a higher ceiling so all this move does is give us a marginal upgrade on Ramo/Hiller at best and a lateral move at worst. And he's only got a year left so there's potential to lose him for nothing.   This just doesn't make any sense to me.
CalgaryFlames,3b5fdl,BN_Flames_Fan,6,Fri Jun 26 02:59:43 2015 UTC,Schlemko will most likely be signed because a guy coming off waivers twice last season is going to be cheap. So therefore I see him playing on the bottom pairing with Egghead or one of the rookies

Maybe also resign Schlemko for cheap.   Also, I'd like us to maybe trade Wideman and sign Green (Calgary native) if the cost is fair. We could get a decent return after Wideman's year.   Ideally our D would look like:  Brodie  --  Gio  Green --  Russell  2 of (Schlemko, Wotherspoon, Morrison and Nakladal)  While, it might make our bottom pairing fairly weak, we need to give these guys some NHL experience and see if they can fit at this level."
CalgaryFlames,3b5fdl,Roughly6Owls,3,Fri Jun 26 05:14:16 2015 UTC,The contract Green gets this offseason will make Wideman's look like a bargain.

CalgaryFlames,3b5fdl,AudioJunki,2,Fri Jun 26 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"I would love to see Egghead or Smid, or both traded, but realistically see that happening. Both are getting paid too much for what they're worth. Who's willing to take in the extra salary?  As for Green, I don't see him as an upgrade from Wideman knowing Wideman fits in with the team and you never know how Green will fit in.  I agree with your bottom pairing. As a rebuilding team, those guys need NHL experience. I don't know about Nakladal's contract, but both Morrison and Wortherspoon should be able to go back and forth between the AHL without waivers, if I'm not mistaken."

CalgaryFlames,3b5fdl,Roughly6Owls,2,Fri Jun 26 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"I can see the team perhaps signing one more depth defenseman during free agency, as it seems the team expects Smid to be ready to go for training camp. I think the top 4 is set. Smid, Engelland, Wotherspoon, and Nakladal will probably compete for time on the bottom pair. Morrison is a dark horse, but I wouldn't be surprised if he spends the whole year in the AHL - and if not, doesn't appear in Calgary until the second half of the season."
CalgaryFlames,3b5fdl,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:04:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't like the signing of a depth defenseman. I think we have 3 depth options in Wortherspoon, Nakladal, and Morrison.

However I believe it is in the best interest of the rebuild to roll with what we have, regardless if we sign Schlemko or not. Right now we have our top 4 as:  Giordano -- Brodie  Russell -- Wideman  While it isn't the best top 4 in the league, it's pretty damn good for a rebuilding franchise.  Then our bottom 2 we can use a combination of Egghead, Smid, Wortherspoon, Nakladal, Morrison (if he's NHL ready) and Schlemko (if re-signed). That should give the young guys some NHL experience."

CalgaryFlames,3b4nl6,Polymarchos,2,Fri Jun 26 03:26:00 2015 UTC,Yeah but statistics can be made up to prove everything. 75.7% of people know that
CalgaryFlames,3b4nl6,bsteinm,2,Fri Jun 26 13:24:52 2015 UTC,"Considering this is written by Scott Cullen, who is an absolute genius....... it means that the Flames will pick the worst player ever........Cullen has never been wrong.  So.........the 15th pick is just like previous year and all other picks in the middle of the draft. It's a mid round pick which apparently sucks.   I would hate to draft someone like Erik Karlsson at 15.  Because according to Scott Cullen, we are doomed and cannot have a good pick. Plus look at that Corsi, fuck the Flames. They're the worst team ever.  Oh yeah, and Scott Cullen says that our pick sucks despite whoever we pick. And he is smarter than anyone else so fuck you."
CalgaryFlames,3b4nl6,BN_Flames_Fan,2,Fri Jun 26 09:26:27 2015 UTC,"""Yeah, first three picks and fifth have a 100% success rate, but fourth doesn't because Calgary picked Sam Bennett fourth last year. What's that you say? Fifteenth this year? The worst of all time!""  Fuck yourself, Scott Cunten."

CalgaryFlames,3b4jd1,mikesulls,2,Thu Jun 25 22:22:38 2015 UTC,Hopefully this means that the rumour of asking for 9 million a season isn't true. I love the guy but I am not up for making a contract like that unless its for 3 seasons max.
CalgaryFlames,3b4jd1,chodes_r_us,4,Thu Jun 25 22:23:18 2015 UTC,I'd be OK with 8.25 AAV for 4 years 9-9-8-7 Doesn't screw us long term and Gio gets paid like one of the best defenceman in the league (which he is)
CalgaryFlames,3b4jd1,TweetPoster,2,Thu Jun 25 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"That's fair! When I was making predictions of what he would ask for I was expecting a 7.5 AAV so I was floored by the 9AAV estimate. I just hope we don't make the contract so long that we become one of those teams in the future that needs to unload a young player because of cap issues. Sure, we're okay now but when we need to pay Mony, Gaudreau and Bennett, we'll be close to a cap team. I'd hate to be a team that's worried about offer sheets."
CalgaryFlames,3b4hio,Chixduggit,6,Thu Jun 25 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"price on him is gonna be wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too high, obviously id love to have him but hes not worth the cost"
CalgaryFlames,3b4hio,Galaxy91122,3,Thu Jun 25 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true, actually. I think that a history of injuries and playing on Carolina has depressed Skinner's value a lot, and that he's probably going to cost much less than someone of his scoring talent at his age would normally.  Maybe still more than the Flames want to pay, but definitely less than someone that young could be worth."
CalgaryFlames,3b4hio,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:16:03 2015 UTC,I agree. Curious as to what it would take in compensation.

CalgaryFlames,3b2oen,Dramon,4,Thu Jun 25 18:26:00 2015 UTC,Looks like I'll have the potential for a California road trip in March.  Now to start saving.
CalgaryFlames,3b2oen,MarcusBrody96,7,Thu Jun 25 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"Well, we're in Anaheim 3 times this year, so it's either three chances to make history for both teams.  I think if we lose all three again Anaheim would officially have the longest home record in sports history against a team."
CalgaryFlames,3b2oen,marbsarebad,6,Thu Jun 25 15:22:03 2015 UTC,Can't wait for Ferland to run over Bieksa in the first two games of the season.
CalgaryFlames,3b2oen,cpbrowner,5,Thu Jun 25 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"That's implying he makes the team out of training camp.  He's one of those guys that we still don't know about yet.  But, I too hope Ferkland the Irrelevant dishes out some punishment to Bieksa (for the rest of his career)"
CalgaryFlames,3b2oen,marbsarebad,9,Thu Jun 25 17:25:17 2015 UTC,Yeah there's no guarantee that Bieksa makes the team.
CalgaryFlames,3b2oen,teckhz,2,Thu Jun 25 19:16:10 2015 UTC,Time to plan a road trip or two.
CalgaryFlames,3b2oen,hose_monkey,2,Thu Jun 25 17:23:39 2015 UTC,Pretty pumped that our biggest road stretch is only five games long. Hopefully that'll give our road record a little bit of a boost from last season!

He talks about how he has always been a leader but it was hard to be a leader on a team as stacked as Detroit, so he wanted to come to somewhere like Calgary where he could be a leader."
CalgaryFlames,3b1ex1,SgtFinnish,6,Thu Jun 25 04:49:53 2015 UTC,Fuck that! Make them want to be Detroit's Hudler!  I might have a mancrush on Hudler. Maybe.

CalgaryFlames,3b1ex1,Pretty_Fly_For_A_,2,Thu Jun 25 16:53:29 2015 UTC,And the difference between a Full Blown Edmonton Rebuild and what we're doing is that we are keeping our leaders and our mentors to make sure our young guys progress the right way. There is very little that i would trade arguably the best player on arguably the leagues best line for. Imagine the regression we could see in Johnny if Huds isn't there to keep his head on straight and also to absolutely launch his passes off the bar and into the back of the net.
CalgaryFlames,3b1ex1,SgtFinnish,2,Thu Jun 25 18:51:54 2015 UTC,http://gfycat.com/SomberMarvelousCanvasback#  I think this is more than enough to prove trading him won't be worth it.

It's been pretty great watching him become somewhat of a household name. Last I saw him was about a month and a bit ago.

CalgaryFlames,3b0ojv,TweetPoster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:56:41 2015 UTC,It's also pretty incredible that he is the youngest on that list and already number 5 in votes. I think he might have this trophy in the bag in a couple seasons.
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,SmokeyNevada,18,Thu Jun 25 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"What Ekblad did this year was pretty incredible for any first year player, regardless of age, so there is certainly reason behind him winning it.  There is no reason for Stone to have gotten more votes than Johnny.  The kid's got Hockey right in his name!"
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,Jumpanator,18,Thu Jun 25 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"Ekblad is 100% deserving, regardless that I wanted Johnny to win. At least Stone didn't win. Him getting second was bullshit."

CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,Zerxek,7,Thu Jun 25 00:20:58 2015 UTC,Really thought this was the award the Flames had the best chance at. I guess the criteria for the award need to be updated so that the handicap for 18 year olds is explicit.
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,rpawson5771,9,Thu Jun 25 00:24:00 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm more peeved Stone finished ahead of him. I wasn't aware going on a hot streak for 1/8th of the season outweighed being fuckin good for the entire season.
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,Kellervo,9,Thu Jun 25 02:39:26 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware going on a hot streak for 1/8th of the season outweighed being fuckin good for the entire season   Sens fan here, I want to say ""I come in peace"" and all that jazz, but I do take exception with this statement for it's factual incorrectness. I'm not going to bother saying who was better or weigh in on the Calder voting in any way. I don't know if you were just using hyperbole, but 1/8th of the season (aka ~10 games) is not correct.   I won't break it down too much, both over the last 44-46 games (>1/2 the season) here's how the rookie scoring panned out among top contenders from Jan.1st onward (an arbitrary date since I already had this data typed out for another thing):    Name Games Goals Assists Points    Mark Stone 46 18 29 47   Johnny Gaudreau 42 12 21 33   Mike Hoffman 46 16 14 30   John Klingberg 46 7 22 29   Filip Forsberg 46 12 16 28   Aaron Ekbad 46 7 12 19    As you can see, we're talking over half the season, and point differential between Stone and everyone else is immense. We're not dealing with a couple points, that's a 14 points differential, and nearly 1.5 times the total goals and points. I will grant you that Gaudreau had a better first half, but then again so did Forsberg and he wasn't even a finalist. The simple fact of the matter is that the first half of the season, like it or not, is a lot less relevant for two main reasons: (1) It's rarely regarded as part of the all-important playoff push since players aren't under the same level of pressure to perform, and (2) when voting for these awards there is an inevitable recency bias, so end of season performances are far more impactful on the voters perception.  This isn't necessarily directed at your comment, but instead toward the general sentiments of your board. Perhaps some stuff you weren't aware of with Stone since you don't watch enough of the Sens (likewise, I won't comment on Gaudreau's performance since I don't feel I've seen him enough).    Stone's ""slow start"" is almost entirely down to early coaching. We had Paul Maclean at the helm for the first ~30 games and he relegated Stone (and Hoffman, Wiercioch, etc..) to depth positions and sometimes healthy scratches literally without justification. Stone made the best of it, I suppose, since he literally had the lowest even strength ice time per game of all Sens players under Paul Maclean (including less than Lazar, Greening, Smith, etc.). He was getting barely over 10 minutes a game and put up and acceptable 11 points in 25 games prior to Maclean's December 8th firing. He didn't have a ""hot streak"" from Dec/Jan onwards he had an opportunity under Cameron by being given top-6 minutes with competent linemates. Many of Stone's stats weren't just among rookie leaders, they were among league leaders. First off, his key ability to steal pucks was exemplified by tying for the league lead in takeaways at 96 with Ryan O'Reilly, and keep in mind this is after being shafted for ice time early on where I'm sure he could've managed on or two more to take sole possession of the lead in that category. But even points-wise, let's look at the points leaders from Jan. 1st:     Name Games Goals Assists Points    Jamie Benn 46 24 31 55   John Tavares 45 23 31 54   Alex Ovechkin 45 36 15 51   Mark Stone 46 18 29 47   Sidney Crosby 43 17 29 46    Not exactly bad company to have.  My point is, I feel many of you are misjudging Stone and what he managed to do this year, likely blinded by the awesomeness that is Johnny Hockey. There were (at least) three great Calder candidates this year, and as much as each of us wanted our own guy to win, I don't think it's incorrect to say that all were genuinely worthy. There wasn't a ""wrong"" choice among the finalists. If you're going to mad at Stone for anything (and likewise us at Gaudreau), it should be that having the two forwards up top alongside 1 defenseman likely split some votes between Stone/Gaudreau, presumably strengthening Ekblad's ability to come out on top :P"
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,Omega613,7,Thu Jun 25 05:14:53 2015 UTC,"I do appreciate the post, and I apologize if my response is nowhere near as wordy as I'm presently typing on a phone.  I do know Stone posted some really gaudy stats down the line, but a lot of it really does boil down to those last ten or so games.   Of his 47 points in 2015, 19 of them came in that time frame, which is pretty much the reason why I didn't feel he was as deserving. That's almost a third of his entire output, he wasn't even in in the top 10 of 2015 scorers when he suddenly turned it on. What he did was admirable, but until he posted that streak he was well behind Johnny in terms of PPG. If he had kept going at his clip from the rest of the season (or even just the rest of the post-Walrus season) he never would've come close to Johnny or Forsberg.  Another thing that tends to be under played is just how vital Johnny was to our own team. He quite likely saved our season with his hat trick against LA, and unlike Forsberg he didn't taper off, and unlike Stone it didn't take him a third of the season and a coaching change to kick ass. He was consistently great through the entire season. In fact his best games almost all came in the last month and a half of the season, but he got little attention due to Stone's own streak.  I might just be being a salty homer, but I still stand by my opinion that Johnny was the better of the two. If Stone can somehow replicate his streak to end this season, I'll swallow my words, but as it is Johnny has been more consistent throughout the year. I just don't think Stone should be above Johnny when he was behind him for the bulk of the season."
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,Kellervo,5,Thu Jun 25 06:05:05 2015 UTC,"I'm open to have a small and civil debate if you are, and I really appreciate the reply, although my stance isn't honestly that Stone>Gaudreau (in terms of their season, not as players, that's a whole separate/impossible debate!), it's that they're interchangeably impressive in my opinion. I don't dispute Gaudreau's accomplishments, and honestly I don't know enough about him or what he did to make that judgement. My point/stance is that Stone had a tremendous season - all 82 80 games, not just his finish, even if his ending was particularly strong.    ...a lot of it really does boil down to those last ten or so games. Of his 47 points in 2015, 19 of them came in that time frame, which is pretty much the reason why I didn't feel he was as deserving.   You're setting some pretty arbitrary conditions across some small sample sizes, but sure let's have a glance. In his final 14 games Stone posted 19 points (9 goals, 10 assists, 1.35ppg) - I assume that's the streak you're looking at? Prior to that, in 2015, from Jan 1st to mar 15th he posted 28 points (9 goals, 19 assists) in 32 games. In that span, he was 19th for scoring across the league (with Ovi leading the pack at 41pts in 33 games, for comparison). Gaudreau, in that span put up 22 pts in 30 games. So Stone, while not top 10 in the league, was still among the top 20 and still held a sizable lead over other rookies. But Gaudreau also had some small sample size hot streaks of his own, for example his 9 points in 6 games (1.5ppg) from March 3rd-13th - do we discount those as ""hot streaks"" as well? Seems a bit silly.  But so far you've been using Stone's late season point streak as a strike against him, when from another perspective it's something that can be used as an argument in his favour. Both Ottawa and Calgary found themselves battling to get into the playoffs down the final quarter of the season. Gaudreau's consistency is truly commendable, but when his team needed him most he wasn't able to elevate his game and put up those points - Stone did. Stone's point streak wasn't a product of the team success, but rather the team success was a product of Stone's efforts. As one example of this, Gaudreau had 1 game-winning goal in the final quarter (and his only one since Dec.28 2014). Stone had 5(!) in his final 27 games which is more than JG had all season. Stone developed into a leader on the ice and pushed Ottawa into the post season by being our best forward by miles.   Another thing that tends to be under played is just how vital Johnny was to our own team. He quite likely saved our season with his hat trick against LA, and unlike Forsberg he didn't taper off, and unlike Stone it didn't take him a third of the season and a coaching change to kick ass. He was consistently great through the entire season.   I have little doubt that JG was instrumental in your playoff berth, but as I mentioned above Stone was as well for us - as far as I'm concerned they're a bit of a wash in that regard, but I think our end of season win streak is well documented and Stone's impact in that was pretty important (alonside contributions primarily from Karlsson and Hammond). But here I get the sense that my previous comment about Stone's ice time didn't really sink in. Gaudreau might have been more consistent across the year, but he was also given more consistent situations (ice time/linematesde/deployment/etc.) in which to succeed - so that much was to be expected and goes beyond the control of the player. But I honestly haven't looked too closely at the season in this regard, so let's split the season at the 2014/2015 mark, where 2015 will be separated using brackets:  Even Strength:    Player Games Points TOI/Gm (minutes) Points/60 Off.Zone Start % Relative    Stone 34(46) 11(32) 10.95(13.56) 1.77(3.08) +4.9%(+1.1%)   Gaudreau 38(44) 18(14) 12.88(14.60) 2.21(1.37) +13.92%(+17.32%)    All Situations    Player Games Points TOI/Gm (minutes) Points/60 Off.Zone Start % Relative    Stone 34(46) 17(47) 15.08(18.35) 1.99(3.34) +8.5%(+6.4%)   Gaudreau 38(44) 30(34) 16.58(18.57) 2.86(2.54) +22.6%(+25.1%)    In terms of points totals once you factor in TOI, neither player was actually very consistent, where Stone improved as the year went on while Gaudreau faded (the latter in contrast to your claims). Looking at the ES P/60, it wouldn't be completely unfair to say that Stone's 2nd half was better than JG's 1st half, AND Stone's 1st half was better than JGs 2nd half - it's just down to when the performed best. Stone was also given tougher zone starts all year (and played plenty of PK), and those starts actually got slightly tougher as the year went on (while Gaudreau's got slightly easier). The differences between their points/60 minutes in the first half aren't especially large, and when you consider the linemates (bottom-6 linemates vs. top-6 linemates), that's not exactly a chasm or surprising. But instead of actual point totals, let's consider consistency as a property of how often you're chipping in offensively rather than how much: Stone never went more than 4 games without a point (1 streak of 4, 2 of 3 games without a point), meanwhile JG started his year with a 6 game pointless streak (but also then only had 3 games without a point for two streaks). Stone was always putting up the points on a consistent basis just like Gaudreau - but some better linemates, better zone starts, and higher ice time led to more of those games being multi-point games (for Gaudreau all year long and for Stone in the latter half). None of this is meant as a slight against Johnny, but instead as a counter argument to your perspective, in particular against claims of JG consistency/Stone's alleged inconsistency. I have little doubt that in other measures JG comes out on top, and he's a very special player of which I'm very jealous.  We can each spend all day cherry-picking stats to support our own beliefs, but ultimately the more I hear/read and look into it the more I'm convinced that both players had (roughly) equally impressive seasons, but each for very different reasons. And honestly, the Calder voting reflected that. Sure, I guess Stone edged out Gaudreau by tiny amount, but the reality is that the difference is negligible at ~5% - and BOTH of them ""lost"" to Ekblad so it's pretty much irrelevant."
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,Omega613,3,Thu Jun 25 07:42:25 2015 UTC,"Even if you buy into Stone's production being primarily late-season, that almost makes the argument for him, since it's pretty easy to contend that Stone had just that big an influence on their playoff run. Just look at that last game. I think both players were 1 and 1(a) winners. I know Ekblad was awesome, but I don't see how two greatly influential players on two playoff teams don't win over a defenseman (albeit a great one) in this type of vote. I think it honestly just comes down to draft status influencing the perception of the voters."
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,vincey12,2,Thu Jun 25 13:34:05 2015 UTC,"Very well said. I'm a HUGE gaudreau fan. (Might have been one of the first to get his Jersey) but Stone was light's out when he was given ice-time.     Ekblad won because of the difficulty to achieve the level of success he did as a first year defender. However, Both Goodge and Stone are equally impressive with that they've done this year.   As a goodge fan, I see why Stone won more votes.  But I also see how saying 1/8th of the season is hilarious hyperbole."
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,sarrrrk,3,Thu Jun 25 14:17:22 2015 UTC,Being that good at NHL defence at 18 is pretty damn impressive. I'm not super miffed. If it was another forward that won though....
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,Thumper86,7,Thu Jun 25 00:51:27 2015 UTC,Total east coast bias. Horse shit.
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,WeedWackHerHedge,8,Thu Jun 25 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"Nah man, this rookie race was tight as hell. I can't fault them for picking Ekblad."
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,setrataeso,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"True, but, still doesn't change the fact that basically, had Ekblad and Stone been west coast teams, and if Johnny had been on, say, FLA or OTT or whatever, the vote would absolutely have been flipped in Johnny's favour, period."
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,catsfive,3,Thu Jun 25 17:00:00 2015 UTC,What the fuck
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,InfiniteBR,3,Thu Jun 25 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"I wanted and thought jonny deserved it, thought stone would actually take it home... wtf happened rofl"
CalgaryFlames,3b0khh,crossfire999,6,Thu Jun 25 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"Forwards split the vote, and Ekblad was 18."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,dddamnet,14,Wed Jun 24 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"He's starting high, he knows he will not get this."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,PMHerper,11,Wed Jun 24 20:19:47 2015 UTC,He probably didn't even ask for this -- this is probably just his agent's number.
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,Roughly6Owls,5,Wed Jun 24 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"Headline written to drive views, NBD.  Gio's lost some pretty valuable UFA years to a home-town discount contract -- he deserves to cash out on that loyalty. I could see the Flames doing something like 7x6, something like 9/9/9/6.5/5/4.5 for salary structure. That deal will take him to the twilight of his career and let him possibly sign another cup-chaser contract if he wants to."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jun 24 20:30:06 2015 UTC,"The contract above is $43M over 6 years, so a $7.17M AAV. But yes, that contract meets the CBA requirements."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,0,Wed Jun 24 21:26:46 2015 UTC,So can we do this? Or will cap it be AAV like /u/alivirji said?
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,teckhz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"The cap hit is equal to the total cost of the contract (in this case, 42 million dollars) divided by the number of years of the contract (in this case, 6). So the cap hit of this contract will always be 7m/year, even though he's making more than that for three of the six years."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"Cap hit can't be front loaded, I'm 100% sure. 7 million es very fair."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,alivirji,9,Wed Jun 24 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Gio, 9 per year with any kind of term is crazy. The first ask is usually high, so hopefully they settle around the 7 for 7 zone."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,SkiFreeSasquatch,6,Wed Jun 24 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"7 years would be terrible.  He's 31 already and although he's amazing now, there's no telling for sure how long that will last.  I don't mind $9 mil a year as long as it's just 2-3 years."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,lancemeszaros,2,Wed Jun 24 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah 9 for a couple would be alright, but that's a pretty unusual contract. Doubt we'd see it. 7 for 7 can be somewhat front loaded to pay him lots now then fade off on a few years can't it?"
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,SkiFreeSasquatch,5,Wed Jun 24 20:22:23 2015 UTC,You could do something like:  9+9+9+7+6+4.5+4.5 under the current CBA. That would be $49M over 7 years for a $7M AAV.
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"Cap hits aren't allowed to be front loaded, only salary paid. Cap hits are AAV.   I think a ton of people are still underestimating Gio. Yes, he's 31, but he has amazing conditioning and has consistently been Norris level great for 2 years now. He's taking the whole summer to properly rehab all his injury prone areas, and his conditioning is really great.  A ton of elite dmen have their prime in their 30 through to age 40. 8  3x 4 or 7 x 7 are realistic, especially since even if he regresses some after 3 or 4 years, he'll still be a great top pairing dman, and not to mention our captain. Plus, cap increases will make it seem cheaper later on."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,alivirji,5,Wed Jun 24 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"It makes zero sense to give him a max contract that will pay him as en elite defensemen until he's 39 when you consider half of that contract is guaranteed regression. Yes players have proven they can be in their prime between 30 and 40 but there's an extremely sharp dropoff at 37 unless your name is Borque, Lidstrom, MacInnis IE first ballot HHOF. Even at 36 there's less than half a dozen guys who have had elite seasons in the last ten years. And that includes names like Lidstrom, Pronger, Chara.  TLDR if we're giving him term the value needs to be right."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,tempz77,3,Wed Jun 24 21:42:34 2015 UTC,"On top of all that there's also the fact that teams constantly get screwed over by handing out lengthy contracts to older players, god forbid something happen to him in when he's 35/36 we could easily end up in a Pronger like situation."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,Hyperion4,2,Wed Jun 24 21:59:51 2015 UTC,"You bring up a great point. Especially considering he's been playing at this elite level for only two seasons now, and injuries led to him missing 18 games and 21 games in those two seasons respectively. Sure those injuries could easily be freak one offs, but it's entirely possible his body isn't capable of playing at that high of a level for a full season."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,tempz77,3,Wed Jun 24 22:17:42 2015 UTC,"Term is definitely the trickiest factor in this deal. Remember, Giordano is still under contract next season. He'll be 33 by the time he starts playing under this extension. 3 years takes him up to the end of the season when he's 35. So I would think any seasons past age 35 will drive down his AAV significantly."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:06:41 2015 UTC,"Again, cap hits in the NHL have always been AAV."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:57:00 2015 UTC,Yea but former bonus/incentive/retirement rules based contracts have allowed for an essential front loading of contracts.  Not anymore tho.
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,alivirji,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"The contract structure is more restricted under the latest CBA, yes. But AAV has always been calculated the same way under both NHL CBAs under a salary cap. Total contract amount (less performance bonuses, and formerly deferred money) divided by contract term = AAV."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:23:56 2015 UTC,Yep! You are definitely more right than me here.
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,alivirji,3,Wed Jun 24 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"A term longer than 5 years would concern me, regardless of dollars."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it could be worse (see: Chara, Zdeno)."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,juridiculous,4,Wed Jun 24 21:53:53 2015 UTC,A perfect example of why a term of more than 5 years concerns me.
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,3,Wed Jun 24 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"Ya, but he signed his 7 year deal at 35, which is much different than signing a guy at 31.  I think a better analog is Dan Boyle's last (6 yr) contract with the Sharks. link"
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,juridiculous,3,Wed Jun 24 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"This extension for Giordano doesn't kick in until he's 32, and he won't be playing under it until he's 33.    But yeah, 7 yrs for a 35 year old? Awful."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,rpawson5771,3,Wed Jun 24 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"doesn't kick in until he's 32, and he won't be playing under it until he's 33.    I forgot about that part... still, two years less worse than Chara."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,juridiculous,7,Wed Jun 24 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry Gio, we love you, but that's downright crazy. He's 31 years old, how many of those years would be worth 9m, I'd say 1-2 at most. He's only had 1-2 good years (only 1 for Noriss contention), and we don't know if he will be able to reproduce this success. Also, he is slightly injury prone, but nothing like Davy Jones. Anything over 7-7.5m (with 6+ years) is too much."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,crossfire999,3,Wed Jun 24 20:37:02 2015 UTC,His last season was basically just as good as this one.  He had better defensive numbers and only slightly worse offensive ones.
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,fknSamsquamptch,3,Wed Jun 24 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"I don't mind paying the guy, he's an integral part of this team. But if we're giving him term too the price needs to be right. If my math is correct he will be 33 first regular season game he plays for us on this extension, and 32 when it kicks in. A scale like this would be appropriate IMO:    Cap Hit (millions) Term Age in Final Season    $5.50 - $6.00 7 yrs 39   $6.00 - $6.25 6 yrs 38   $6.25 - $6.50 5 yrs 37   $6.50 - $7.00 4 yrs 36   $7.00 - $8.50 3 yrs 35   $8.50 - $9.00 2 yrs 34    If he wants that max contract he needs to make his cap hit for the next 3-4 years super appealing."
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,tempz77,2,Wed Jun 24 20:35:16 2015 UTC,My guess is they settle on 7.5-8M for 5-6 years
CalgaryFlames,3azlw1,Galaxy91122,2,Wed Jun 24 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"If he can play a full season maybe,  but he hasn't played a full season since 2010.  Trade him. There are a few young defenseman around.  We'd probably pick up a top 4 defenseman, a prospect or two and a first rounder."

On the other, backing up the truck for a defenceman that will be 33 before he plays a game under this new contract necessitates that the contract be somewhat sensible.   Gio has missed ~20 games per season and with his closest comparables making $6.5-$7M per season (while being much younger in Doughty/Karlsson) I would expect to see $8M+ only if the term is on the shorter side (2-3 years).    Personally I'd like to see something in the range of ~$7M AAV over 5-6 yr deal for Gio, factoring in that he was underpaid on his last contract and the leadership that he brings."

CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Newtothisredditbiz,7,Wed Jun 24 00:31:17 2015 UTC,Ya no shit eh. Lets get another averaged sized center... we have a real shortage!
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,wreck-sauce,2,Wed Jun 24 00:48:58 2015 UTC,I think rolling 4 scoring lines is the future of hockey. We can always use another skilled centreman!
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,joseville,7,Wed Jun 24 00:51:45 2015 UTC,"True, but the scouting reports of White say he's not particularly skilled.  Flames management has said their two top priorities are offensive skill and the speed (both physical and mental) to play today's fast-paced game. If that can come in a bigger package, all the better.  White is reportedly below average in all three areas."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Newtothisredditbiz,8,Wed Jun 24 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a terrible philosophy to take the 'safe-bet to be an NHLer, but he'll be an average one' in the first round of the draft -- in the game today, basically the only way you get elite top-2 defensemen or top-3 forwards without massively overpaying is by drafting them, while the bottom of your roster is much cheaper (and easier) to fill out with trades or free agency. I don't want to see the Flames drafting the guy who (BUTTON SAYS THIS IN HIS ARTICLE) projects to be a career middle-6 player with our first rounder. That's just a losing proposition.  Gimme Sprong with major attitude problems over that."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Roughly6Owls,7,Wed Jun 24 01:56:01 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Not to mention we already have a guy in Arnold who's basically the same player as White. Gimme Sprong or Boeser over white every day of the week
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,chodes_r_us,3,Wed Jun 24 02:29:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%.  Also, from what I've read, the 'safe player with fewer skills' is a mythical beast. Players who score less in junior are less likely to reach the NHL or have successful NHL careers.  There are all sorts of draft busts, but the guys who get drafted as 'safe,' sure-fire future Brandon Bolligs fail at a greater rate than the guys who are Brett Hull clones with Brett-Hull defensive problems."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Newtothisredditbiz,3,Wed Jun 24 02:35:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that does seem to be the case -- and especially for forwards, high scoring underage years are the best indicator of 'eliteness' -- especially in the modern era, where being a face-puncher is becoming less and less of a career path, the vast majority of forwards that stick around in the NHL are basically just good at scoring in junior (basically this graph shows the average number of games played (the colour) by every NHLer who scored at a certain PPG (the y-axis) at a certain age (the x-axis). White blocks are areas where there historically haven't been that many players, and you can see the area that overwhelming produces long-playing players is closer to the white areas).  I mean, even looking at recent drafts, the team that picked Nikolaj Ehlers at 8 (104 points in 63 games) is looking a lot happier with their first rounder than the team that picked Virtanen at 6 (71 points in 71 games)."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:45:17 2015 UTC,"I love that graph.  As a Vancouverite, I can tell you that a lot of fans and bloggers here are choked with that Virtanen pick, especially with Virtanen still scoring just 1.04 PPG in his draft plus one year and Ehlers scoring 1.98 PPG."

What an idiot! I understand value based drafting, but I just don't see the flames taking a third straight first round centre."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,NOSaints,4,Wed Jun 24 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"I do think you should always take the best player available, especially seeing as prospects often don't make a real impact for four or five years. Who knows what the roster then will be.  Also, having a better player at a stacked position gives you an asset you may not have if you draft a shitty player just because he's a fills a position of need. If you're choosing between drafting the next Sean Monahan and drafting the next Deryk Engelland, you take the next Monahan even if it means you have to trade someone or move a centre to the wing.  The problem with Colin White is that nothing suggests he will be the best player available at 15. He is a player with what looks like a third-line ceiling who as you say will have to compete against at least three better centres for a job."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"Picking a center is never a bad idea. Also Backlund could be expendable in the last year of his contract and could bring back some nice assets. That being said, we better not draft Colin White."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,teckhz,4,Wed Jun 24 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"Huh, not viewable in Finland. I understand, but WHY THE FUCK COULD I WATCH THE FUCKING AD THEN?!"
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,SgtFinnish,2,Wed Jun 24 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Just taking part in a mock draft on reddit here, and we ended up going with konecny at 15 because he has the capability (according to his bio) to play the RW, where we lack in depth. What fell to us was mostly centres"
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,jigglefest2,4,Wed Jun 24 01:49:18 2015 UTC,"Drafting for need isn't really smart -- your prospects won't be playing next year unless you get very lucky or you're drafting in the top five (Pastrnak in Boston was the only guy other than Ekblad who played more than one regular season game this year after being drafted in 2014). Considering that, you're better off drafting the best guy you can and filling the holes when you get there -- if your drafting was good, your prospects will be desirable, and you'll be able to swap them for players in different positions with similar levels of skill."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jun 24 02:00:20 2015 UTC,Yeah we felt like he was our best option as well. But I understand where you are coming from for sure. I have another first rounder coming up at 25 so I'll use that logic accordingly haha
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,jigglefest2,2,Wed Jun 24 02:07:46 2015 UTC,"Konecny's a good bet anyway at fifteen -- he's offensively skilled and he plays hard -- but you shouldn't be forcing yourself to draft RW and D because you need RW and D -- if Crouse falls to 15th on draft day, I don't see the Flames passing on him over Merkley just because Crouse is a left-handed shot."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Roughly6Owls,2,Wed Jun 24 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"Very true. Kylington was available at 25 so I took him as well because of what I have heard on this sub about him. You seem to have quite a bit of knowledge on this upcoming draft, would you say that the flames should move up, stay put, or move down?"
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,jigglefest2,3,Wed Jun 24 03:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think that there's a large 'shelf' of players who're all available at around the same skill level coming up where the Flames are picking: there is 1-2 (obviously), then 3-6 (Hanifin/Provorov/Marner/Strome), then 7-20 seems a little more fluid -- Werenski's been ranked from 6-11, Meier's been ranked 8-26, Barzal's been ranked 6-17, Crouse has been ranked 4-15, Zacha's been ranked 4-24, Connor's been ranked 6-14, Rantanen's been ranked 7-19, Konecny's been ranked 7-33, Svechnikov's been ranked 7-23, Merkley's been ranked 11-19, Roy's been ranked 10-27... all of these guys are very, very similar levels of skill -- the fact that all of them are ranked up to ten spots differently by different analysts shows that: if there was more differentiation then they'd be ranked a lot more clearly. Even further down, Sprong, Kylington, Chlapik, Bittner, Beauvillier, have all been ranked from top-20 to after 45th.  Because of this large group of very similar players, I wouldn't be sad to see the Flames trade 15th down to say 19th or 20th. I'm not sure if there's a trade to be made there, but if someone has their sights set on some specific guy, then I think there's enough players around that'll be very similar that it's a good bet to just get another asset out of a team.  If the Flames want to move up, they need to be sure they're getting someone in the top half of that group. Werenski/Crouse/Zacha/Barzal/Rantanen. I think it's more likely that we get one of these guys because they fall, and not because we trade up (I don't think we want to give up the assets to make one of those trades).  In summary, I think that the Flames select fifteenth unless they get an offer from someone like Winnipeg to move up, in which case I think they should take it and flip the picks."

CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,jigglefest2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:32:55 2015 UTC,"Geez, from the comments here you'd think there's never been a center to play wing before.  Hudler and Cammy come to mind from our own team, it's not like White would be locked into the pivot."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Moose11,2,Wed Jun 24 04:03:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but there are so many players I would pick before Colin White."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,teckhz,2,Wed Jun 24 16:14:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I think the Flames are of the same mindset.  Treliving has gone on record saying he's looking for skill and offense, neither are traits I attribute to Colin White. Even his name is boring.  If they're serious about going for the most skilled players with the highest ceiling, that may open us up to Kylington though."
CalgaryFlames,3aw60x,Moose11,2,Wed Jun 24 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind Kylington, but I bet we could get him with the 20th pick or something. If we want him I would trade down and try to pick up a fourth 2nd rounder."

That being said, if they actually want a goalie, I think conventional wisdom suggests they take the highest one left (likely still going to be Samsonov) at 33, or even trading down that pick for 38-45."

CalgaryFlames,3aupr1,newfie_hiscock,3,Wed Jun 24 01:45:48 2015 UTC,fuck marchand
CalgaryFlames,3aupr1,JESUS_WALKS,2,Wed Jun 24 04:15:01 2015 UTC,I mean only to bring him up as an option. All I know about him really is he has a big nose and how to spell his name.
CalgaryFlames,3aupr1,peanuts421,0,Wed Jun 24 02:07:51 2015 UTC,Solid comeback! We really need more people like you on the internet to let the rest of us know when we spell someone's  name wrong. I really would not want to be heralded as a poor speller after all of those years of education I have.   Really thanks for pointing it out to me.
CalgaryFlames,3aupr1,newfie_hiscock,2,Wed Jun 24 10:15:07 2015 UTC,No problem
CalgaryFlames,3aupr1,peanuts421,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:24:03 2015 UTC,Best part about this is we already locked Backlund up at an ALREADY low price
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,Svenka,14,Mon Jun 22 17:52:01 2015 UTC,That'd be nice.  I think the Brodano pairing would do even better on international rinks given their skating and puck moving abilities.
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,sergeant_meowenstein,9,Mon Jun 22 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"and with gio and brodie being underrated as usual, everyone thinks bouwmeester and letang should replace them.. lol wtf.   you want to replace the best defence pairing in the nhl for 2 over average d men.."
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,sergeant_meowenstein,9,Mon Jun 22 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"'them' as in brodie and gio? i understand replacing brodie, but not gio.  Bouwmeester is on the decline and Letang is still a pretty good player.  It wouldn't be the end of the world if Letang took Brodie's spot, but the Brodano pairing would be perfect on the bigger ice surfaces. Getting hard just thinking about it. mmmmmmm"
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:32:59 2015 UTC,I don't understand replacing Brodie. By next year he'll be a 50+ point d man and a complete beast.
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,sergeant_meowenstein,11,Mon Jun 22 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Letang's a RHD, already a 50 point scorer, and has been in the Norris conversation for about four years -- he's not a bad choice, especially considering Brodie/Giordano are both LHDs."
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,HKizzle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"agreed.  Also if Brodie made the team, he'd most definitely be gio's partner, assuming he isn't the 7th dman/in the press box.  The proven chemistry between the two would probably give them an upper hand in camp if they were both to be invited"
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,Rideyn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:44:21 2015 UTC,but the gio brodie combo
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,fknSamsquamptch,2,Tue Jun 23 18:07:14 2015 UTC,"On top of that his skating is almost as beautiful as Bobby Orr's, it's majestic. He would kill it on a wide open international rink."
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,Roughly6Owls,3,Mon Jun 22 20:14:11 2015 UTC,That would be incredibly fun to watch!
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,alivirji,3,Mon Jun 22 18:42:49 2015 UTC,I'd replace Seabrook with Vlasic.
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,SgtFinnish,3,Mon Jun 22 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"Seabrook is 30, Vlasic is 28. How is Seabrook the guy who can still improve?  Especially when they're both definite top-pair guys."
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,shmelvis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, for some reason I thought Vlasic was way older. Nevermind then."
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,DaCodster,5,Mon Jun 22 20:31:47 2015 UTC,Nope. They're projected to lead Flames to Stanley cup!
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,Blank747,2,Mon Jun 22 21:29:08 2015 UTC,They can lead us to the Cup and then play in the World Cup the September after!
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,CanadianSandGoggles,3,Mon Jun 22 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"And the young stars team could potentially have Mony, Johnny and Sammy so lots to be excited about."
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,shmelvis,3,Mon Jun 22 20:58:05 2015 UTC,But they'll be to busy with the nhl playoffs.
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,Blank747,2,Tue Jun 23 01:23:25 2015 UTC,I think this is the new tournament they announced. Different than the world championships that currently happen during playoffs.   But I could be mistaken.
CalgaryFlames,3aqfwr,trenchdick,3,Mon Jun 22 19:24:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the World Cup of hockey will be held in September, not April."

CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,ImVenasaur,4,Wed Jun 24 23:54:50 2015 UTC,"MayRay and Wideman are gunna be trade bait, and im guessing we will take merkley if hes still available because a right winger would be amazing right now."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,stacksOFFstacks,5,Mon Jun 22 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know man. I've seen Merkley slide in the last couple weeks, he has fallen off the table a decent bit. He's now slated as falling after #20 pick. Names like Oliver Kylington, Travis Konecny, and Jeremy Roy have seen a rise.  I'm not so sure the Flames will pick Merkley."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,ImVenasaur,3,Mon Jun 22 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"I really want OK's injury to be no big deal, all signs point to Karlsson 2.0 if he can reach his potential."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Rooster697,2,Mon Jun 22 19:01:37 2015 UTC,well we will see. If not Merkley then konecny.
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,CuggyofHouseAbby,2,Mon Jun 22 19:51:16 2015 UTC,Konecny will likely be picked before we choose
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,konradical_,2,Mon Jun 22 23:27:55 2015 UTC,"I've seen Merkley slide in the last couple weeks, he has fallen off the table a decent bit. He's now slated as falling after #20 pick.   Just curious by who, and why? Prospect rankings shouldn't be a hot or not list, no one's played for weeks and most for months. Merkley at least was in the Memorial Cup but there is no reason he'd be ""falling"" unless teams are leaking their inner rankings to media types like Bob Mackenzie and he's just ranking him lower than he did before based on consensus."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Roughly6Owls,4,Wed Jun 24 13:01:11 2015 UTC,We will draft Zrobil or Kylington. We will trade for a top 9 forward too
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,superdude99,6,Tue Jun 23 04:12:09 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting that the Flames take Svechnikov or Chabot, unless Connor, Meier, Rantanen, Barzal, or Zboril falls from where they're expected to go. I think Kylington or Sprong have an outside chance of being the Flames pick, depending on whether Kylington's injury is considered an acceptable risk or if Sprong's attitude is considered an overblown 'problem' -- if either of those things are true, then Kylington and Sprong would've been ranked much higher than the late 20s - early 30s that they're finding themselves in.  I'd love to see us trade down -- something like 15th/Raymond/Russell for 19th/Mantha/Ouellet. I think that after ~12, there is a large 'shelf' of talent that's all at approximately the same level of skill (F: Merkley/Konecny/Svechnikov/Sprong/Bittner/White/Ek-Eriksson/DeBrusk/Harkins/Boeser/Dergachev, D: Chabot/Zboril/Roy/Kylington/Carlsson -- all of these names are all over the bottom 15 picks), which is why we have ten or twelve different players that people want and could feasibly expect. Because of this, all of these players are expected to be similar levels of NHLer (or at least, similar possibilities of NHLer), so trading down a couple spots because we're confident that at least one of our guys will still be around is nice."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,WeightOfTheheNewYear,3,Mon Jun 22 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"Konecny, Roy, or Zboril. I'd be in heaven if Werenski fell but that's not gonna happen. Hopefully ship off Raymond and/or Engelland with retained salary if need be."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Tobinat3r,2,Tue Jun 23 17:17:44 2015 UTC,I'd be very pleased if we were able to move either of those guys.   The chances of that are slim I think.
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,enag7,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:20:03 2015 UTC,I'm high on Z and Roy.  I want them. I'm not big on merkely or Kohechny. I'd love Werkenski to drop to us. But when he doesn't I want Z or Roy and I hope Kylington drops to the second round.
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,mikesulls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see the Flames pick Roy, if none of the higher ranked D are available. I think I'd choose him over Zboril as well.  Also would love to ship off Raymond, Engelland, or Wideman."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,enag7,2,Wed Jun 24 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"Well if the past two years are any indication we'll take the player I really don't want them to pick and he well be a total stud and prove me wrong.   So expect Kylington and expect to see him on the second pair comfortably next season.  In all honesty I would want to see us trade down, except for maybe Barzal drops (which he could considering injury). Everyone in the first two rounds seems to be fairly even.   In terms of players I want us to take that would easly be in our range, I would want one of Meloche, Chabot or Carlsson and Svechnikov or Sprong or maybe White if he falls far enough."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,cpbrowner,3,Tue Jun 23 13:10:12 2015 UTC,You didn't want to draft Mony or 18 year old Sam Bennett? I was the exact opposite. Who did you want us to draft those draft years?
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,cpbrowner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:36:41 2015 UTC,"Money didn't seem like he had a high enough ceiling. So I wanted Lindholm or Barkov if he fell to us, but mostly Barkov so I wasn't overly annoyed by us ending up with Money.  Last year I was really sold on Draisaitl. He looked like a total stud in the WHL and looked like he had all the pieces to complement Money really well. I got to watch him about 5 times so I had a decent read on him as well. Plus I loved his name. So fun to look at."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,thenomad69,2,Wed Jun 24 01:38:25 2015 UTC,I haven't devoted much time at all to do my research this year unlike other years (busy summer and I'm fucking hooked to The Witcher 3) but I'm going to be using this resource throughout the week:  http://flamesnation.ca/2015/6/22/the-big-list-of-nhl-draft-resources?utm_content=buffer5de4c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,superdude99,2,Wed Jun 24 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"That's a sick resource. I haven't got the Witcher 3 yet, played the first two though. Is the new one sick?"
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,alivirji,2,Wed Jun 24 16:30:41 2015 UTC,Oh my god man it's taken up so many hours this past month. Endless fun. Never played the 1st two myself tho
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,chodes_r_us,2,Wed Jun 24 18:16:24 2015 UTC,I'll have to pick it up when it's super cheap then. That's sick.
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,alivirji,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"Considering that it appears that the 3rd overall pick is in play, what do you think would be have to give up to aquire it? I think a stud like Hannifin is exactly what this club needs, obviously it won't be cheap, but I think we would improve quite a bit by making a trade for him."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,chodes_r_us,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"we  would probably have to include Monahan, Gaudreau, Bennett, or Giordano, so no way should we make a move for it."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"Chabot, Zboril, Konecny, Meier, Kylington, Roy. Any of these and I'll be happy. I hope we can trade for another 1st and snag 2 of em (Wideman with salary retained + 53rd pick for 19th OA from Detroit maybe, since they need Rh dmen).   If Sprong falls to 45 i'd be ecstatic, but I doubt that would happen.   I also hope we trade for Franson's rights and sign him for less than 6 million.  Dude is a huge Rh 2nd/3rd possession dman."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,chodes_r_us,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:58:10 2015 UTC,You're not scared at all about the fact Franson was sitting in the press box in Nashville because he was too slow? I'm terrified of signing him because of how expensive he's gonna be and how hard he could bust if he can't keep up to Hartley's system....
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Roughly6Owls,2,Mon Jun 22 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"He isn't slow, he's actually a great skater. It's just that the right handed depth of Nashville (Weber, Jones) made it so he never got a chance to succeed. No PP time, shitty teammates and low minutes. He never got a chance to learn and adapt to the radically different system, and Nashville was too tight in the central race to give him the chance (including the playoffs). He was a top 2 dman in Toronto and his underlying numbers support that. He was scoring almost as much as Wideman did before the trade!"
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:59:03 2015 UTC,I'll be honest I haven't watched Franson enough to make a complete opinion on his skating but I do know that if you're taking your fancy stays relative to Toronto you're gonna have a bad time.  I'd love to see you make a statistical argument for signing him at 5-6 mil a year for 4+ years ( cause that's what he's gonna cost) based on his time in the western conference.
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Roughly6Owls,2,Tue Jun 23 06:04:52 2015 UTC,"Here's your statistical argument, I hope you love it. Adjusted for both playing on Toronto and playing against his opposition, here's Franson's possession numbers. For comparison, Jeff Petry's fancy stats chart looks like this (again, adjusted for playing on Edmonton and against his opposition). For some more perspective, here's Wideman's chart. One of these guys just signed a 5.5m AAV contract for five years, another one has been signed to 5.25m AAV, five year contract for three years. Tell me which one of those charts implies Franson's worth less than either of Wideman or Petry?   Here's a chart with some selected names on it. On this chart, in general, good defensemen will be coloured blue and exist in the top half of the chart (the x-axis has more to do with usage than how good the defenseman is) -- look at Giordano compared to our other defensemen for proof of that. Notice where Engelland is relative to everyone else for the 'bad defenseman' standard. Notice how Brodie's been pulled closer to Engelland because of Giordano's injury. Again, considering Petry's contract and how much we're paying for Wideman, why wouldn't Franson, much closer to Giordano and Subban than Wideman, be worth more than 5m AAV?  Traditional stats: Franson's been a 30 point guy for the last five years on Toronto, while Petry's been a 20 point guy for the last three on Edmonton. Again, signs point to Franson being worth MORE than the guy who just got paid about as much as you're asking for. Taking his time in Nashville and expecting that to be more indicative of his play than the last five seasons is naive."
CalgaryFlames,3aqe6k,Newtothisredditbiz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:20:50 2015 UTC,Huh I do love it good job! Well you've convinced me. I'm down for replacing wideman with Franson. What do you think trade wideman at the draft and sign Franson?

CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,WeedWackHerHedge,17,Sun Jun 21 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"I had him on my team in NHL 15 and he did good, so i think we should trade for him"
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,Senortroll,2,Sun Jun 21 22:26:38 2015 UTC,"I did the same, with great results"
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,tilldeathdoiparty,5,Mon Jun 22 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Mine did too but he was overshadowed but my top line of stamkos, tavares and mcdavid"
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,Senortroll,2,Mon Jun 22 00:43:45 2015 UTC,Yea having okposo on my(our) second line would be a complement to the first line
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,tilldeathdoiparty,13,Mon Jun 22 01:37:59 2015 UTC,"The issue with the Islanders is that it's kind of hard to divorce their good players from Tavares, because Tavares is so good that he warps their team.  Look at what happened to Matt Moulson when he went from Tavares' left winger to anywhere else -- he went from Gaudreau levels of production to Bouma levels of production.  For this reason, I think Okposo's going to be over-priced for what you end up getting out of him -- he's a good player, but I think the Islanders will want more than a first and a middle-6 player."
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,Roughly6Owls,12,Sun Jun 21 22:19:08 2015 UTC,Okposo's production was virtually identical during Tavares' injury.
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,fknSamsquamptch,9,Sun Jun 21 23:19:28 2015 UTC,He's a great player and would be an amazing pickup but I think that the price would be very high.  The Isles fans in the /r/hockey thread are saying that unless its a top 10 pick they would want more than a first rounder. I doubt that 15th overall and a fourth liner would net a 1RW who is only 27
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,notlogan,4,Sun Jun 21 20:38:08 2015 UTC,Nope. Rebuild through the draft. Our time will come if we are patient. Glad our management team is embracing this philosophy.
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,dddamnet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. Patience will build a competitive team for years to come. If things are rushed, we might have a good team for a season or two, but then what?"
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,bobovski,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. BUT, I think the best would be to package some of the 2nd and 3rd round picks to get back into the 1st round. If not, if the Islanders would talk a combination of 2nd/3rd rounders it might be worth it. Probably not realistic though."
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,vincey12,5,Mon Jun 22 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think a deal could be made without giving up our first round pick.  A couple of our second rounders would be a decent start.  The big question is if the Isles want a roster player back or if they're looking for more prospects.    If it's a roster player they want then David Jones with half retained salary could be enticing.  A good bottom 6 winger who can jump into the top 6 for short stints and a cheaper contract than Okposo's, and could be re-signed for pretty cheap too.  Throw in a lesser prospect like Hanowski, Carrol, or Kulak and that might get it done.  But if it's a solid prospect they're after someone like Granlund, Ferland, or maybe Max Reinhart would get the conversation going.  Overall I think Okposo is a good player that could be reasonably aquired and that would make an impact both short and long term for the Flames."
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,Jumpanator,3,Sun Jun 21 21:26:18 2015 UTC,It's worth pointing out that the Isles are pretty much sitting out of the draft this year. I'd have to think a first rounder would go a long way; personally I think the Flames cupboards are so full that we could throw down our 16th for Okposo and not end up feeling it in a few years.
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,businesstravis,2,Sun Jun 21 22:41:25 2015 UTC,"The cupboards really aren't too full anymore. Monahan, gaudeau, and Bennett aren't there anymore."
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,teckhz,3,Mon Jun 22 04:15:23 2015 UTC,He's a good player but the price will be too high. I think it's a first rounder plus a roster player and probably a mid level prospect. Then you hope you don't get in a bidding war with another team.
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,SofaProfessor,2,Mon Jun 22 04:15:39 2015 UTC,Problem is he might cost one of those five.
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,Polymarchos,2,Sun Jun 21 22:38:41 2015 UTC,If we could do it without giving away the 1st or one of our top 6 forwards I would. I really like him as a player
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,AbsoluteIKeatI,2,Mon Jun 22 00:52:55 2015 UTC,I was playing NHL 15 in GM mode and the computers some how had Okposo on the flames 1st line hahah
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,zenfate,4,Mon Jun 22 03:13:13 2015 UTC,Nope. We are still rebuilding. While our forward core looks good out defensive core for the future looks bad. There are a lot of good d Prospect in this draft and trading a chance at them so we can strengthen a small problem when there is still a large need that needs fixing is stupid. Getting Okoposo is a move a good team does to be great a la Anaheim Getting Kesler last year. Okoposo does not take us from being a okay team to great or even good. Look at Dallas they have all the fire power in the world and still missed the playoff because of defence. Our issue is now depth at defence. We have the tools offensively for the future. Monahan/ gaudreau Backlund and Bennett form a offensive core that will be elite once guys like Porier and Granlund stick with the team and mature.  Meanwhile we have Brodie and Worherspoon. Then who? Morrison was a signee and I reserve my judgement on him once I actually get to see him play. We need Defence. And we need to keep the first and seconds we have to stick up on that defence.
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,WeightOfTheheNewYear,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:57:26 2015 UTC,Completely agree with this. If we can even trade for another first rounder and spend them both on Dmen I would be extremely pleased.
CalgaryFlames,3amyvd,MrCopacetic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:19:45 2015 UTC,"The Flames have a lot of depth on center.  A lot.  The team is comparatively weak on wing, especially right-wing.  While Monahan, Backlund and Bennett should all be considered untouchable for trade purposes, the team can certainly leverage the rest of their depth at center to improve on the wings.  Building through the draft would be nice, but the team's lack of depth in right wing prospects (I think Poirier is the only one who has a shot at a regular main roster spot) means that they probably should and can afford to build that up through trade or free agency.     With that said, let's look 3 years ahead and ask where Okposo would fit on the team.  He'd be a 30/31-year-old, his contract expires in 2016 so he wouldn't be $2.8mil anymore, and of course there's the question of how good he is away from Tavares.  If they can snag him for depth centers then cool, otherwise he may not be worth it.     One thing is for certain though: if they do want to get him, then they should get him this summer.  Waiting a year gives him the benefits of playing with Tavares for another season, which will make his market value on free agency all the higher.  Acquiring him now gives him another season playing with the team, which will let them more accurately gauge his real talent level."
CalgaryFlames,3alw1e,OTPHJ-,6,Sun Jun 21 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"He was a health scratch for a lot of the season in Adirondack so that guys like Nolan Yonkman and Sena Acolatse could play. He also had to play a few games as a winger due to some problems with callups for injuries not being able to get to Adirondack in time.   I have no idea why they mentioned that he has an offensive upside, he had 5 points in 48 games, giving him the lowest P/PG among any prospect our team has.   This was an accurate writeup for 2013-14 when it seemed like he was our best defensive prospect but now he has been passed in the depth chart by: Wotherspoon, Culkin, Kulak, Ramage, and Morrison. So I think at this point the chances of him making the leap to the NHL are pretty slim."
CalgaryFlames,3alw1e,notlogan,3,Sun Jun 21 18:01:53 2015 UTC,I've been researching a lot of teams prospects for the mock draft and I looked at his stuff and sort of laughed at the fact they mentioned offensive upside.
CalgaryFlames,3alw1e,MacerV,3,Sun Jun 21 15:05:32 2015 UTC,"Sieloff has had a tonne of bad luck with injuries the past couple of years that have robbed him of crucial development time.  Because of that I don't think he'll be an NHL defenceman ""sooner rather than later"" but I do believe he'll get there, it just might not be until he's 24 or 25.  The log-jam of defensive prospects doesn't help his situation either, so I think starting the year in the ECHL would be good for him, much like it was for Kulak this past season.  There is certainly no reason to give up on the guy yet."
CalgaryFlames,3alw1e,Jumpanator,2,Sun Jun 21 21:31:47 2015 UTC,"I think that the main way for Sieloff to make  the NHL regularly is to be moved as a forward. He doesn't have the ability to make stretch passes with regularity and isn't that big to play the banger D-man role. If on the other hand he was moved up front, you would basically have another Lance Bouma type guy (sans scoring) that knows how to play defensively.   Not sure that he'll ever be more than a temp call up guy."

CalgaryFlames,3alzh3,lancemeszaros,3,Sun Jun 21 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"Glencross is never going to be a top-6 forward on a Stanley-cup-competitive team.

Backlund has been given a lot of leeway to prove he's an NHLer, I just don't think he's qualified. Not on this team, anyway. I see a fragile, unconfident journeyman.

I think Glencross is an apt example - we don't see it as fans, but it's happening in the room. He's going to be seen by the boys, as a player who's simply in the way. We could get help from this contract, a really important piece to add, a strong team.   That's my opinion; I don't think Backlund is a good NHL player on this team. He could rip it up on another team though, that's for sure, and benefit us hugely if we deal him.  *Oh, and that ridiculously stupid penalty that cost us that game 5, really cost us the game, didn't help with my opinion of him either. Fucking knucklehead."

If you think he's too fragile to be a 3rd liner but you're ok with a GM paying a ""too fragile to be third liner"" 3.5 million dollars a year than I don't understand your point at all.   From what I understand you think he's a great deal at 3.5 but he's a terrible player? Where you by any chance the GM for the /r/hockey mock draft?"
CalgaryFlames,3aj0cy,laureth-23,-1,Tue Jun 23 06:21:37 2015 UTC,"No, I think he'll be a journeyman NHLer, or will just be plain broken down.

That's what I'm talking about."

CalgaryFlames,3aj0fc,chodes_r_us,9,Sat Jun 20 17:41:02 2015 UTC,There good players but we aren't at the stage to be trading for players like them. We still need to instill a core group of players. In a couple of years is when we should be taking on guys like this.
CalgaryFlames,3aj0fc,gaganminhas,4,Sat Jun 20 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"See I actually think we've got that core especially with Backlund locked up.  Monahan, Bennett, Gaudreau, Brodie, Gio, Backlund  That's a group of players you can build around. If you trade Vancouver's pick for Sharp it ends up being Baertchi for Sharp. I'm struggling a little bit to see where Granlund fits into this core and we'd be filling a need (right handed shots). Both those guys easily have four or five years left in them and I really hope were serious contenders in three ish years so that's why I don't think it'd be the worst idea in the world.  I mean it's not like Sharp is 38 and thinking about retirement any time soon..."

CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,jigglefest2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:35:10 2015 UTC,So Jiri is an UFA after next season? How many of you think we trade him this off season? Definitely food for thought.
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,blink0r,0,Sat Jun 20 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"It's not that great, I mean they have TJ Brodie's contract wrong. It's not 4.65 per year he is making 3.9 mil next year so that he won't be making more than Giordano. Then after that it raises to 4.838 mil per year for 4 years.   Smid, Engelland, Stajan, Bollig, and Wideman's contracts are all also wrong. It looks like the site takes a contract then just shows the AAV over the length instead of how much is actually being made per year.   NHL numbers is still the better resource for cap info and it has a breakdown of bonuses."
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,notlogan,2,Sat Jun 20 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, who really gives a crap about what their actual salary is that year? All I care about is the AAV cap hit. Since the new CBA doesn't allow front or back loading of contracts, the yearly salary doesn't matter to fans."
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,alivirji,3,Sat Jun 20 13:19:12 2015 UTC,The new CBA does allow front and back loading of contracts. It just specifies exactly how much salary can vary from year to year (35%) and that no single year can be more than 50% below the highest year of the contract.
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,rpawson5771,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:12:26 2015 UTC,Yea but that's for salary. Cap hit is just the AAV iirc. I might be wrong tho
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,alivirji,2,Sat Jun 20 14:24:24 2015 UTC,Cap Hit is (and always has been) always the total value of the contract (less performance bonuses) divided by the number seasons for the contract. That's the same under the old and new CBA. Front loading and back loading under either CBA never changed the AAV.
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,rpawson5771,0,Sat Jun 20 14:26:16 2015 UTC,Are you sure? I remember there was a ton of controversy over cap escaping/restructuring during the lockout because of the loopholes in front loading or back loading the cap hits.
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,alivirji,0,Sat Jun 20 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. By limiting the term of contracts (7 years for free agents, 8 years for re-signing with an existing club) and salary variance, the new CBA severely limits how effective structuring contracts with front loading and back loading could affect AAV.    The famous example of course is the 17 year, $102M Kovalchuk contract that got rejected. AAV for that would have been $6M. Of course, Kovalchuk was making $95M in the first 10 years of that deal, and then had 7 years tacked on at $1M each to lower the AAV.    Even the Kovalchuk deal that eventually went through ($100 M over 15 years, $6.67 AAV) that paid $90M over the first 10 years and then $10M over the final 5 years, could not happen under the new CBA. Both due to term, and due to salary variance."
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,rpawson5771,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"Ooohh I see! So basically he could retire after the first 10 years getting 90 million, but the cap hit is only 66.7 million over that time. Makes sense."
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,alivirji,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this as well. Oh how we all miss Capgeek...  Also, Hockeys Cap is showing what the cap hit is so they do have it right."
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,rpawson5771,0,Sat Jun 20 04:43:43 2015 UTC,"There's a button to toggle between cap hit and salary. It shows the exact numbers you describe for Brodie. It seems to show the others OK as well, except for Wideman at $600K for next year. Bad typo there.    If one of these knockoff sites could get the waiver eligibility calculator that Capgeek had, I'd be pleased."
CalgaryFlames,3ah1xf,rpawson5771,0,Sat Jun 20 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"General Fanager and Hockey's Cap are updated to show the Backlund deal already. NHLNumbers, not so much."

CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,TLA_Dick_Slappin,11,Fri Jun 19 19:04:58 2015 UTC,Heading into his senior year of NCAA hockey after being on the national championship team last season. So he's coming along. Hard to say if he'll ever pan out as an NHL player with the Flames or where his ceiling is. I personally like his chances - I could see him being a good bottom six center who can move up the lineup in short spells. Time will tell.
CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,rpawson5771,8,Fri Jun 19 19:06:48 2015 UTC,Won the NCAA championship as the teams best defensive center. Underwhelming point production but he's always been seen as a project. He could always have a breakout offensive year next year but at this point I think he projects as an above average big defensive center.   Definitely shouldn't give up on him. Chances are he'll play a couple of years in the AHL as well so I wouldn't expect much from him for another 2-3 years
CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,chodes_r_us,2,Fri Jun 19 19:08:22 2015 UTC,"Providence is notorious for being super heavy handed on the defense, and Jankowski was specifically placed in more defensive scenarios to work on that aspect of his game, since being a center it is very important.  Considering the points the points he put up while performing his defensive assignments is a good sign. Still we'll next years training camp."
CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,Dramon,4,Sat Jun 20 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"I watched a bunch of the Providence games on their way to the championship title and thought Jankowski looked great out there.  Easily their best defensively responsible forward, a faceoff wizard, and really slick hands. I think he could be a perfect 3rd line centre for us."
CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,AC666,5,Sat Jun 20 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"I think he'll have a pretty similar career to Backlund.  He'll get in the NHL, not put up a lot of points, but be defensively responsible and have good possession numbers.  He will be completely ignored by the league for what he does, and he will always have to live with the fact that he was a ""bust"" for a first-round pick...even though he will have a decent career as a middle six possession center.  OR he could prove us all wrong and come out swinging next year.  Providence is notorious for being a low-scoring defensive team, so maybe Jankowski isn't given the opportunities to show his offensive skills.  I wouldn't know because I've never been able to see him play due to stupid college requirements that don't allow them to attend training camp or development camp."
CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,marbsarebad,0,Fri Jun 19 19:29:30 2015 UTC,It's adorable how many of you guys don't realize he's a long term project.

CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,rorydaniel,5,Sat Jun 20 00:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yes he's a long term project, but even as someone who was a proponent of the pick (at the time) you're kidding yourself if you think he's progressed the way the Flames expected. Going into his senior years he's yet to have a single season at even a PPG. Hardly what you want out of a first round pick long-term project or not."

CalgaryFlames,3aflvs,iChron,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:44:58 2015 UTC,We drafted him for positional need instead of BPA as a long term development investment which was a mistake.  We have a lot of options for bottom 6 centers and our top 6 should be pretty solidified with Monahan and Bennett in the next year or so.  He's gonna really need to impress people in training camp (Can NCAA players partake in training camp??) or impress people with his last season or else I don't think we will sign him.
