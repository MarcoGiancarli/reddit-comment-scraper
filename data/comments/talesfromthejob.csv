talesfromthejob,3bdv1r,ScottSierra,2,Tue Jun 30 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"It might be.   In his case, when the building was up for sale before my boss brought it, he lead a group of people trying to convince the other tenants to buy the building collectively and turn it into a co-op. The problem was that they offered a price to the owner that was both insulting and laughable. Then they wasted money in suing that owner claiming that she was discriminating against them because they were minorities trying to buy the building from her.  The case were tossed out when the court discovered what their bid was. There is 28 apartments in this building and each apartment was willing to part with between $800 to $1000 each and that grand total was the stupidest offer I have ever seen. That building is in a middle-class income bracket and the market price is no where near their offer. He convinced the group to all sorts of stupid mischief that didn't work to convince the owner to succumb to their wishes. So the owner sold it to our owner and the group kept up on their mischief for two months until everyone stopped but three of them. I guess the rest noticed that we actually spruced the place up and was going to keep sprucing the place up as long as they stopped hindering us.  2 of 3 has mellowed out and moved on with their lives. A lot of that group has moved on to buy their own houses and the leader is holding on trying to re-achieve that glory he had in the past.  This dude has his own house that his wife and kids live in. He just refuses to let this apartment go because he didn't win yet.    I don't know if that being an [curse word] or being crazy. Hell, I even had a few court cases with him and with the craziness of that case, the judge offered him to the 10 grand to just leave the building and he refused it. Everyone in the courtroom including the people he brought for emotional support was dumbfounded over that. .... maybe one day I'll drop that story here. I dunno. He's both crazy and an [curse word]in my opinion. I can't ever say that to his face being that I must be professional but I really wish that I could.   [edit]I probably will release it here.

I go out there and ask them to show me. The gas turns on but not the igniter. I ask them to turn off the switch and then plug the stove in. They complain saying that no stove needs the plug. It's just a ploy from the electric company. I ask them if they use matches or a lighter and the response is conspiracy related. It takes a while to explain how the stove works before his daughter shows up and yells at him. It's her apartment, he is visiting and she is fine with the stove.

talesfromthejob,3b8kxf,SomeUnregPunk,2,Wed Jul 1 22:43:57 2015 UTC,"No pilot light. The oven is turned on by a thermocouple and the stove is turned on by an electric igniter.  The only other way to use the stove would be turn the knob on and to manually lite it with a lighter or match.      There is this crazy conspiracy that he completely believes in that involves pilot lights, matches, lighters, stove manufacturers and the gas company. The conspiracy is that the gas company is trying to suck all the money out of it's customers by creating the pilot light. And to stop them from using the electric stove that he has, the electric company has these hidden fees that increase the monthly bill for every customer that has an electric stove. And the match and lighter manufacturers artificially keep their prices high to support the gas and electric companies.     When I pointed out to him that there are refillable butane lighters and matches the can be used over and over again, and how a gas stove with electric igniters work, he called me crazy and a liar. His daughter fixed things by asking me to look like I'm fixing it, then plug the stove in and tell him that I installed a manual grinding spark wheel that will ensure that the gas and electric company is cheated out of their elaborate handiwork.

If someone acts like it's a big hassle, they should keep their ID in an easier place to access and keep the mentality that they might need to pull it out at any point.

Well then I guess we can let your Parole Officer and Attorney know that you never attended these groups or individual sessions. And if that's the case, then you would certainly be Non-Compliant in your program. Is that correct?""   That would be a good way to lose your job and land your employer with a huge lawsuit.  If he attended the sessions, lying to his parole officer could have potentially landed you in some seriously deep shit if he had his parole revoke because of it and your employer got sued as  a result.  Probably leave you open to be sued personally too.  Edit:  for my downvoters - ever worked in healthcare and had to deal with penal system/parole officers? There are a shitload of rules & regulations.  Deliberately falsifying info or lying can and will land you in a whole heap of trouble.  Yes they guy is an asshole for trying to avoid the debt, (that is a matter for debt recovery through the courts) but if OP had followed through on her threat to lie to his parole officer that he hadn't attended the sessions as retribution for not paying his fees - the company she/he works for would be fucked.  Heavy fines and most likely loss of any govt. contracts they had for providing that service, also possible blacklisting by insurance companies."
talesfromthejob,37d80h,ademnus,3,Wed May 27 04:46:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't downvoted you (and those who did should explain for themselves why) but I suspect the reason is that it isn't so much this guy is threatening to lie to the parole officer. If I am reading all this correctly, Jose is claiming he never got any services, so if that were true it would mean he never attended the groups or sessions which would put him in violation of parole. Obviously, jose DID attend them and his fellow couldnt say that to the parole officer but he's trying to get Jose to admit he DID get something that he owes money for. Does my explanation make sense?"
talesfromthejob,37d80h,impablomations,2,Wed May 27 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"I do see what you mean.  From the clients point of view - it seems you have to pay in advance, so I can see why he might be confused/pissed off having to pay for something that he hasn't yet received.    Addiction patients fall under mental health laws - a mental health worker doing the same thing could face prosecution and dismissal for gross misconduct. OP should remember that he's an addict - a mental health issue, and probably has difficulty thinking logically.  At the end of the day - OP still threatened to lie to a patients parole officer over a civil matter because she hated him.  Even the act of threatening him like even - even with no intention to follow through, is coercive abuse.  I worked in forensic mental health and have seen people sacked on the spot for similar behaviour."
talesfromthejob,37d80h,impablomations,3,Wed May 27 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right unfortunately. I wouldn't be able to actually lie to his parole officer, though I would be able to tell his PO that he is Financially Non-Compliant because he had a huge balance on the account still due. However, telling this particular client that he'd be Financially non-compliant, wouldn't have had the desired result. This guy was more then just an ass hole, he was a stubborn, disrespectful, cocky asshole. At any time, he would try to work around us and try to get things for free or discounted. He was not a joy to have in the office, and we were glad when he was finally discharged.   Telling the guy the above, got him to realize that he was in the wrong, which he already knew, and was a faster end to the conversation then telling him he was financially non-compliant and having to explain what that meant, why he wouldn't be able to be discharged, or get his paperwork because of that. It would have turned into a long argument and I was not in the mood to deal with that kind of struggle."
talesfromthejob,37d80h,SomeUnregPunk,2,Thu May 28 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying this to be a dick - this is a genuine piece of advice.  Whatever you do, don't even threaten someone with that again - it can and will land you in serious trouble.  In the mental health field (which addiction would fall under) it is classed as coercive abuse.  If he decided to take it further and complain - it could cost you your job.  I know he might have been acting like an asshole, but you have to remember these are people with serious mental/addiction issues and try not to take it personally when they do this shit.  Did your employer not provide any training on how to deal with these situations?  If not, they should have.  They shouldn't expect you to deal with situations like this, especially being the person on the 'front line' so to speak without adequate training.   It would have turned into a long argument and I was not in the mood to deal with that kind of struggle.   It may sound harsh but that's your job.  He probably picked up on that and that could have made it worse.  We had a guy with serious anger issues.  Other staff couldn't be bothered and would just restrain him and put him on lockdown when he kicked off - I talked to him calmly and patiently and his interactions with me were so much different than with some of the other staff.  9/10 times I could calm him down with no further action needed.  Eventually he started coming to see me when something was bothering him, instead of just exploding.  So it payed off in the long run and made all our jobs much easier.  A little empathy, calm & patience can go a long way, and make your job lot easier in the long run.  If clients like that see you as an enemy or someone they have to battle with - then their interactions with you will reflect that.  But if they see you as a friendly face, someone who empathises with them (even if you don't - it's about how they feel about you), they'll be more likely to give you less shit and comply.  Remember, they are addicts with mental issues - when they act it it isn't necessarily directed at you personally."

It is not cheap to run for office so the rat race sucks more time out. In my cynical view, I would have to say that money talks the most, nowadays.   That said, if you want to speak your mind, I would say that you should call the D.C./state capitol office and just give a short, succinct bit on the topic. Just say ""what"" and ""why,"" thank the intern and let the call end there. It'll end up as a tally mark on a weekly log, but when the official notices a lot of opposition, they'll take it into consideration if it looks like it'll affect reelection.

Under new management, we started to look like your company.  Before, engineers who worked 45-50 hours a week were treated like gods, we got overtime on top of salary, AND had our breakfasts catered, and lots of other freebies.  (The company owner also owned a skybox in the local minor league baseball stadium.  They catered food and drinks to us there as a thank you.)  After the purchase, all that shit was cut.  Except the expectation of long hours.  Oh, and innovative new projects were also cut.  We were expected to buy OEM and slap our names on those products and make them all work together in a system.  The new owners were surprised that these various systems were not ""plug & play"", and required lots of work to integrate them properly.  It finally came to a point where one of our very senior engineers asked HR why we were not being paid for overtime hours, and got a shrug in response.  The next question he asked HR was, ""How many hours a week do YOU work?""  When the HR guy said, ""40"", the engineer said, ""That sounds fair.  That's what I'll do too.""  From then on, the job became a 9-5 job as every single engineer in the company switched their hours.  Management tried to implement bonuses, and brought in a nice Starbucks coffee machine and stocked a room with carbohydrates and sugar - but it was no use.  Too little, too late.  Over the last four years the new company realized that their newly acquired division was losing money, and had no new products to sell.  They then figured it was because our sales force sucked, so they fired them all, and hired new.  To pay for the new hires and the severance pay, they sacked part of Production and part of Engineering.    That made them bleed red even more, so they started laying off parts of Engineering.  10 here, 20 there.  About three times a year.  They laid me off in December, along with 40 others, including some of the engineering heavyweights who brought the company a long list of patents, and who invented the basic platforms the company used."

They want an Android application that makes it easier for you to make calls on the go, etc. We waffle about on what he REALLY wants (that is, does he want an APP, does he need help with the Android DEV tools, or whatever).  After nearly a week of broken conversations and hearing about this guy's product breaking when someone updates their system because of their app's design (Seriously, who uses a perl<->java<->Scala bridge because they hired a Scala developer instead of a friggin' perl developer) we eventually come down to: He wants me to write an app, but I don't get any of the API details for their backend so ""just make it generic"". He's got this really odd idea of what the core requirements should be, so I go ""We're doing a requirements document. Give me a few hours and I'll whip it up.""  Four revisions of the requirements doc later, I'm ready to go non-linear. After checking and double-checking all the details, I get an email from him:   What do you need so we can get going on the code?   My reply? A huge block of CYA:   Signed/dated letter with the version of the requirements you're agreeing on included, preferably scanned to PDF, but a photo is fine too.   Radio silence for a week. Then, at 9PM a few days ago, I get this cryptic voicemail:   So I uh, don't know, uh, if those requirements, are really, the ones that are, uh, most uh, uh, important to what we, uh, need for this. So, uh, I need some more time, uh, to think about it.   I'm not getting paid enough to answer calls at 9PM local time.

I've dealt the best I could with everything....then yesterday happened.  It was such a small thing really.  I've been told in the past to ask the production manager if we can do things that customers ask for that aren't in the catalog. I was told this specifically when I was asked by a customer if we could print a 40X60 print and mount it in 4 hours and I told her that our minimum turnaround time for mounted big prints was 2 days (as it says in the catalog) and production got mad that I turned away business.  I said no problem, I can shoot an email back and ask.  So for 3 months I've been telling the customer,"" I'm not sure I'll have to check with the production manager to see if it's something we can do.  I'll give you a call back as soon as I find something out.""  Yesterday a customer asked if we could do something...something we have done in the past...and I called back to production, didn't reach them so I told the customer.  ""I don't want to tell you wrong so let me make sure with my production manager and I will give you a call back shortly.""  I send the email and an hour later my coworker gets called on her direct line.  My manager tells her that the production manager told him that we need to stop emailing and calling back to ask if we can do things that aren't in the catalog.  So my manager called up to tell her to tell ME that.  I called back to my manager and told him that he himself told us that the production manager wanted us to call and check on EVERYTHING.  He told me ""the catalog is law"" and hung up.    Ihave a folder on my desk right now...of EVERYTHING that has gone on.  I have copies of my training stuff.  I have printed out copies of the emails I've sent about suggestions and problems.  I have everything in there that I've done to benefit the company, tried to do to benefit the company, and that has been told to me.  So I sent and email copying the production manager, my manager, and the operations manager and said that there has been some confusion at the front desk regarding this issue and asked if they could send an email telling us exactly what we should and should not be asking production about.  No response.  I'm at the point where I feel like I have to have a folder to protect myself from the bullshit....and as far as I'm concerned...I'm GETTING that email confirmation of what they want because I'm not going to have anymore HE said/She said garbage.

I can ignore the bullshit...but I'm not going to get in trouble daily over something that I haven't been told otherwise on.

talesfromthejob,20evb2,penguin_2,7,Fri Mar 14 16:43:03 2014 UTC,"It sounds like you're already doing pretty much everything you can. Keep documenting your manager's actions because it sounds like he's the type to throw you under the bus when the shit hits the fan. Keep emailing your boss and his boss when you get contradictory information so that there is a record of his incompetence as well as your own competence. If he verbally asks you to do something inane, ask him to email it to you so that there is a record."
talesfromthejob,20evb2,roadsiderick,6,Fri Mar 14 19:00:37 2014 UTC,"If your manager balks at emailing requests to you, then you send a confirmation email to him for each verbal request he makes.

talesfromthejob,20evb2,London440,3,Fri Mar 14 23:05:41 2014 UTC,"Start looking for a new job without quitting your current one. Submit your resume, try to get interviews that you can squeeze in around work hours. Try to find a new job that meets your criteria (sufficient pay, not too far away, a job that seems like it will last). Even if it takes a long time to find, it sounds like that will be your best bet at improving your situation.  Aside from that, as other posters have noted, document everything.   Best of luck to you."

I applaud this, but as long as you work for this company, this will be a part of your daily, weekly, monthly routine. For this company and many others, the business model that promotes quantity over quality will always be plagued by the issues you describe.   The real tragedy here is that your talents (customer service, quality assurance, process efficiency, leadership, business acumen, just off the top of my head) are being wasted by this company that has, at the very least, stalled, or at worst, is circling the drain.  Keep innovating and keep covering your ass; this is gonna be key in finding a new job when you and your boyfriend end up where you're gonna be. I might also recommend a book called 'What Color Is Your Parachute'. There's a 2014 edition made for job seekers and those who are wanting to change careers. Seems kinda silly in parts, but it asks some tough questions. $11 on Amazon.  You have a lot to offer a small business, all the way up to a Fortune 500 company. The solutions you're offering this business, other companies would pay consultants for. Don't let these idiots zap your energy and time. They've mismanaged a stable, home grown business to the point where they'd rather do cold calling than work on the quality of their product. They're not gonna last."

talesfromthejob,1xjhq5,aaiceman,1 point,Mon Feb 10 22:53:29 2014 UTC,I worked in a highrise and the building management took firedrills seriously.  You had to watch fire safety videos within the first 30 days of employment.  Fire drills involved everyone in the building walking down stairs and getting to the various gathering sites. Fire inspectors would survey each floor to verify that only the minimum necessary staff was staying on the floor (only 4 people for phone coverage and security). They would kick out people who didn't follow the drill. The company on that floor was cited and fined.  A lot of people complained about how it hurt their legs to walk down 40+ flights of stairs.  Some floors (floor 7 to 12) didn't completely evacuate the building. They gathered in hallways near the stairs. Perhaps your drill was arranged like one of those floors?

I went through a very similar 2 year span that nearly killed me, and had to get obnoxious not to get a raise but just to get them to stop abusing our group with regard to hours.  (we were salaried workers and right after 9-11 because we were in NY the (new) department head suddenly announced that they wanted us all in the office 7 days a week / 12 hrs a day, alternating between an evening and day shift ""until further notice"". When pressed about compensation we got: ""I'm sure there'll be something"".  All to be ""around"" in case the software in the downtown data center goes down and we needed to tell someone which code to move where.  Nevermind that we had a backup data center in Princeton, and nevermind that we could do perform all these duties from home.)  So I got obnoxious and made some legitimate threats about quitting and going public (company owner = prominent politician).  Turns out no one else in the company had any idea the dept. head was doing this to us.  Higher ups shut it down fast (to their credit).  This also means there was probably no way in hell our large dept. was going to get compensated for the extra work.  I'd hazard a guess that some middle manager is enjoying the fruits of your labors.  Maybe you should slow down your productivity a bit to give you time to apply for more work out there.  Depending on your location there should be jobs for you.  You're a catch for any company!"

talesfromthejob,1x9uz1,HeadacheCentral,2,Sat Feb 8 04:34:27 2014 UTC,"This. I learned the hard way that loyalty in companies is a one way street, coworkers feel loyalty to each other and feel loyalty to their company and pride in their work. Companies feel nothing and live on people who they can squeeze just a little bit more work out of. This company, specifically your boss and their boss, don't give a damn about you. Don't give a damn about them either and make a choice that is better for you.  Catalogue everything you've done and how you've enhanced their processes. Start turning that into an amazing resume entry and then start shopping around for something else. People are always looking for admin work."
talesfromthejob,1x9uz1,KelMage,2,Sat Feb 8 06:24:10 2014 UTC,"This is depressing because your managers are just clueless to the point it hurts the company.   I was in a similar position like a year - 1.5 years ago. My department lead picked up on that and hired someone to support me in that position. From there, things got rolling, responsibilities got discovered and expanded and now we are expanding to 5 people and our work is a huge asset to our devs and admins - and currently we are working on providing access to our work to the entire company because it's simple to do and will result in a rather silly level of effectiveness.   I'd expect similar effects from giving you people and power just from how you describe your work. Automate this, automate that, give someone a configuration interface other there. Sometimes you recognize the good managers and leads by a will to give up control in a controlled fashion and the bad ones because they keep the wrong part of control."

If it's that bad, if you really can't handle it, you've got to move.  If you bought a house along already existent and heavily traveled railroad tracks, right next to a busy intersection where the train blows its horn, are you going to start calling the train company every time a train rolls through?  Having lived directly in the flight path of a smallish regional airport was more of a nuisance than anything.

But yea,  sometimes people just get too familiar with rides and get lax in judgement.  One time at Five Penants we had a ride stoppage.  Someone took out their camera while on the lift hill of Batman (that ride is the worst I fucking swear. Every problem revolved around that damn ride).  So at the top of the lift hill, they stop the ride, and Security or a Rides Supervisor has to go up and collect the camera.  So I strapped up to the safety line, climbed the stairs to the top of the lift hill, and confronted the guest with the camera. He coughs it up, I verify there is pics on it that is from this ride. Now at this point I'm supposed to take the camera and get off the lift hill. Then let the ride run and after it's done, escort the offender to our office and ban him for 7 years.  Instead, as I turn to begin my decent, the car starts moving and the ride starts up.  Now im sure you've never been 80 feet up in the air on a roller coaster when its moving, but that thing shakes like Michael J Fox.  So I'm holding onto the rail for dear life, making sure no part of my clothing somehow snags on the car and drags me with it.  I get down to the ride platform and ask the ride operator what the fuck she was thinking.  She says ""What, you were done up there. We have a line.""  I hate people."

talesfromthejob,173yn7,LordDVanity,8,Sat Jan 26 01:58:36 2013 UTC,"His sons, my step-brothers.  The eldest was an absolute Jesus-freak. Called my mother a fornicator and my sister and I heathens. Somehow his father escaped this guy's scorn.  Next eldest was an acid head. He was perhaps just a little less pious that his older brother. He was doing the books for his father for a while until he was caught embezzling funds to pay for his acid. His dad finally fired him and he went for a looong time without a job. He was renting from my mother and step-father. Finally got kicked out of his apartment, as well. Don't know whatever happened to him.  Third in line was a psycho. When he moved in with us he would hide needles in my mother's wash towel. Bought a Saturday night special and left in on the dining room table. I came home from whatever I was doing at the time and found it. I happened to bave some starter pistol blanks. I loaded up the gun and found him across the street hanging with his crew, bragging about having a gun. I pulled it out and pointed it at him. He called bullshit and said it wasn't loaded. I popped off a round into the air and he shit and pissed his pants. He was also an absolute garbage-head of a drug user. He ended up ""rediscovering"" his piety, went to church, married a drug-addicted black woman 20 years older than him. He took over his father's company after he retired but ran it into the ground so badly dad had to come out of retirement to save the business. Years later he then ""rediscovered"" he liked drugs, left his wife, quit his job. Don't know what happened to him either.  The youngest was a delicate little boy. Very pious. Also called my mother a fornicator and adulteress (again his father escaped this righteousness) and my sister and I heathens. I suspected he was destined to be gay. Years later he was ""molested"" by a camp counselor. He apparently liked it because he eventually ""came out"". That was after his church tried to ""cure"" him of his homosexuality.  My step-father ended up cheating on my mother with his ex-wife. They both finally figured out he was a snake and both dumped him. In fact, they are now travelling friends and go on vacation to Mexico a couple of times a year.  TL;DR: I got blisters on me fingers!"

talesfromthejob,16p0lp,zalloy,3,Thu Jan 17 10:33:10 2013 UTC,"This guy took an interesting approach. Sure, one should be able to legally sub-contract work out, but he just went about it the wrong way.  By going about it the way he did, he breached the usual contract terms of company security, proprietary & intellectual property, non-disclosure, and probably a few others that I haven't thought of. It's mostly because he subbed out his work without the blessing of the company that they have a problem with it.   The catch-22 is that if he had gotten the blessing of the company, then the company may have simply decided to sub out his work directly to the Chinese company, and cut him out of the transaction completely, because then they'd realize they were paying this guy, and he's chilling all day, Redditing and watching YouTube, while the Chinese workers are doing his work. I'm sure the company would much rather pay the Chinese company $50,000 instead of whatever they were paying this guy.   Also, this guy had probably left himself open to a pretty serious lawsuit for the breach of contract stuff. Hope he's got a good lawyer."

Going to make a quick over-emphasis that seemed to help them.  You Borrow From some body, this is you receiving it, and Lend To some one, this is you giving it to some one else.  It is also OK to say that they borrowed from you, or that they lent something to you.   In the above example you would would be lending the truck to the boss. Not ""borrowing to"". Just mentally add ""to"" or ""from"" to the sentence if you are feeling uncertain as to which to use. :)  Oh, and if it was a simple tired mistake, sorry. :-P but maybe some one else will find it useful."

talesfromthejob,16nu3u,AmbienDreams,5,Wed Jan 16 21:23:25 2013 UTC,"I used to work at a granite fabrication shop. There was always a fridge stocked full of beer for anyone to take. We'd all be half in the bag running forklifts, operating computer controlled bridge saws, grinders, polishers, routers, and circular saws all day long. Out of the 6 of us that worked there only 3 of us had drivers licenses but we all ended up driving the company trucks anyway when we had to go out on installs with the finished product.   Not only did the owner not give a fuck, he was the biggest instigator of the drinking games and pranks. One time I came back from an install to find my moped proudly perched on top of the 30' high building. It was a fun time, no one lost any fingers or limbs and we turned out a quality product in a very timely manner. There were no safety protocols whatsoever though, I was the only one that wore safety glasses and I had to bring them from home.  I enjoyed it because it was like being in the wild west. It was you VS the work and you could tackle it anyway you saw fit. No right or wrong, just results. If you feel like having a beer or smoking a joint on the job light up and pass it around. On the other hand I'm glad I got out of it because we were basically cheating death on a daily basis.   Interesting times."

You can't drink and run power tools!""  I told them to relax. I never run power tools unless I'm drunk. And out the door I went.  Yes. Yes, I ran power tools.

Binge drinking, not so much. As in Europe, people were brought up with booze. It was just a normal part of life, not some forbidden fruit. There are many tales of the two or three martini lunch. It was how business was done. Pre-prohibition factories would hire boys to lug buckets of beer to them to keep the workers happy and productive.  I used to work in London and as only one of two Murkins there I was shocked when everyone stood up and went down to the pub for lunch. There I was, sitting at my desk, with my sandwich and a bottle of water. I ended up joining in on the tradition and have never looked back To this day I go down to ""the pub"" and have a good meal and a drink or two with my lunch. I go back to work in a much happier mood.

I basically waved my foot in a semi-circle around the sled to keep the dog away. The (human) bitch yelled ""keep your foot away from my dog!""  I was like - listen, I don't mind dogs, but if your dog bites my kid in the face I will stomp it to death. If you keep your dog off leash, and your dog runs after children, growling at them, prepare to have your dog kicked in it's tiny awful face.  So... this is probably not the sub for either of our rants really, but fuck people who can't control their dogs.

If I have a small child on the ground and a dog comes up to them, I'm not going to try to tell my kid to run away, I'm going to kick the dog because it is acting agressivly.

And she knows to keep even our dogs on leashes (they're older, and haven't kept up their training for a while).   So yeah, I feel for your point. Such owners are the worst.

But if you let your dog run free in a park, and it decides to start running after someone barking don't be surprised if they take it as a threat on their life.  I don't dislike dogs, I like them to be honest. But I do not like being chased by one. People say things like ""it just wants to play"" and ""running away makes it excited"".

Heck, I know there is at least one chemical commonly used in some scented cleaning products that I have actually passed out from under a minute of exposure to! Heck, some I don't even have to breath, just touch somewhere that has had the cleaning or other solution with the fragrance in it used on it recently. It is really miserable to be like this, because everyone just assumes you're being ""picky"" too.  For example, yesterday I was at the doctor's office. In the waiting room, I suddenly started coughing violently, and I looked around, trying to figure out what it was, then saw a woman on the other side of the room who had taken out a hand wipe of some sort and was cleaning her hands and the arms of her chair with it. In under a minute, I had gone from fine to coughing so hard I still have a sore throat from it a day later.   So yeah. You have to be around it every day, I get that.

talesfromthejob,y20ba,leilanni,18,Sat Aug 11 17:51:01 2012 UTC,"My mother did mystery shopping and got me a few gigs.  This is a long post but there are several stories here.  At one burger chain, she was instructed to purchase any ""suggested sells.""   It was Christmas, and they suggested she buy a gift card.  So she did.  They then suggested she buy another.  She bought $100 in gift cards.  She offered to give them to the company but they declined.  They changed the policy about suggested sells.  Once she did a 2 AM shop at a fast food shop.  As she was eating, a customer walked in, one of the employees saw them, jumped over the counter, and assaulted him.  She wrote in her report she won't go back to that location or do any more shops after 10 PM.  All in all, mystery shopping for fast food won't pay the bills.  You basically get free meals- and you don't get to pick what you want, nor cut the tomatoes if you don't like them.  She got a call recently asking her if she'd like to do a shop in another town.  120 miles each way.  She'd get $7, and a free hamburger.  She declined.  The one way she did make money was checking out product placement in grocery stores.  Manufactures rent shelf space for their product.  She'd go in, check how many ""facings"" their products had, how many were on the shelf, what products were next to theirs, if they had any in the back room, and how high off the ground they were.  She was working for 5 different manufacturers, going to the same stores.  She was paid by the store, so stopping at one store she got paid 5 times.  She was also paid mileage, so she got mileage from 5 different companies.  Once she mystery shopped for an auto manufacturer.  She was instructed what kind of car, options, things like that, an to try an negotiate.  When they had the contract prepared, she pulled out a letter from a VP of the corporation informing they were to put all of the paperwork relating to the sale in this fed ex envelope, it listed all manner of documents, the salesman would get a commission on the ""fake"" sale, but if any of the documents were missing the dealership would be in severe trouble from the manufacturer.  She said they had a fit, called the corporate office who confirmed it, so they complied."

Once, she had a gig in a home improvement store for two weeks sitting in a chair by the lawn mower products waiting to see if anyone would appear to look at one particular brand of oil.  She'd ask if they looked at the product, and if they said yes, she offered them a $100 gift card to do the survey.  Two weeks and no one looked at the product.

talesfromthejob,u1vx5,teenagehaiku,16,Wed Jul 18 18:34:09 2012 UTC,"tldr; The story behind the story is so completely f'ed up that I can't believe it myself. The biggest WTF here is that Derp still has a job.  The original story is a generalization of Derps typical behaviour. But it was inspired by a particular event:  Derp was given an assignment to create a report. We use M$ SSRS a reporting tool which makes reporting wysiwyg easy. The application was originally his own project over the past 3 years, he had inherited it from an offshore team (relevant). For the last 3 years solely under Derp bugs were slow to be fixed and new features created new bugs to the extent that users stopped asking for new features and cancelled existing feature requests. Management took this as a good sign, he was keeping he scope limited and working on the real bugs. However eventually this project was taken away from him, and out of the hands of our team. The new team reviewed the code and immediately trashed it. They had it replaced in about 6 months, all bugs and new features included. Some of the bugs may have been from the offshore team, but I wonder. You might be wondering why this person was never fired. There are two reasons for this, 1) the nature of our employer is that the only fire-able offensives are HR related, and 2) he attends the same hard-line church as the president, as persecuted people they have to stick together. Anyway since Derp ""knew"" the data, he was given the tasks of creating reports. Perhaps I should say ""report"".  Anyway he knows nothing about SSRS so I am asked to give him a quick lesson. As I begin an overview he inquires about taking a break for lunch and leaves, for the next two days he doesn't have the time to meet with me for 15 minutes. He then complains to our manager that he needs some software and new hardware to run the software before he can complete the task. I get blamed for this (because I didn't explain the softare to him). It is at this point our manager forces him to sit with me for 15 minutes. I give him an overview, show him a few completed reports. I then inquire about his report, and after this I create his report. 3 inner joins, I leave out most parts of the where clause adding only a single condition. I use this to show him how to add ""parameters"" to the where clause. On a hunch I saved off the report to my own disk. I don't work closely with him so the rest of the story comes in pieces. Apparently he had created a stink with the other group that replaced him. Derp claims that he needed an extra table to finish the report and they would not create it. I know the dba from the other team and ask him about it, who explains all of the data is there, and that Derp isn't making any since. Going back to Derp, Derp explains that the data is so complex and large that it would be more efficient to have his own table and use an import script. So I tell Derp to ask the dba to create a ""View"" using ""nolock""'s if necessary. I trust that the dba of the other team can create this safely. About a week later I find that there was a disagreement between our management and the other teams management. This caused quite a few meetings and hurt feelings between the groups. Derp had insisted on using ""nolock""'s unless he can have his own table. The dba heard that Derp was using nolocks and tried to kick him and our team out of the project. This hurts the funding of our group, and breaks the original agreement to give them control of the project, so management stepped in. The dba on the other team didn't want to fight the battle so he threw up his hands and gave Derp his table. Derp spent a week on perfecting the import script to load the table. The import script was originally written by another member of our team, Derp managed to rewrite it for his new table. Once Derp had the table and data populated he was ready to create the SQL for the report. He found some code through google which used a cursor to go though each record of the table. One record at a time he used multiple in-line if statements to include or exclude a record to a temporary table. By temporary table I do not mean a @table variable nor do I mean a #local table not even a global ##temporary table. No I mean a permanent table called ""temp"". Derp had problems with the iif statement, so he asked co-worker Herp to help. Herp showed him how to pass parameters using a stored procedure. He placed the stored procedure in the loop, which broke the cursor. So Herp suggested that he use a loop instead of a cursor. About a week later I am asked for help which is my first chance to see his code. What I see is a While loop looping though the id's of the records. (1 to max()). For each id an if statement determines if the record exists, if it does Then the ""temp"" table is created, the data is selected into ""temp"". A series of IF(Exists(SELECT FROM temp WHERE IIF(column = @sqlParameter,1,0) = 1)) THEN INSERT INTO temp2.....; DROP TABLE Temp  If you're not familiar with SQL then just imagine 20 children crying, the code is similar to that.  Okay fast forward 1 month. Management calls a meeting and asks the entire group to stop what we are doing and help Derp out. Derp has got the report sort of working but need help creating some more stored proceedures. Also there is a stale data problem we should look at. Derp then tells us that he needs each of us to create some stored proceedures. Basically 1 for the year, 12 for each month, 52 for each week. The daily reports would come later. They would be named sp_getDataWeek1.. Herp and Herpina start to consider a code generator. I interrupt and I ask Derp to explain the entire report. Derp then explains three table joins in the most complicated way possible. This is when it hits me. Derp doesn't know SQL at all. The code he's worked on for the last 3 years had a database abstraction layer. Things he has said over the last 3 years start to make since. He thinks that data comes magically from a Database to Visual Basic. This is the first time he has ever heard of SQL. I then explain to him that what he needs is called an inner join. The team agrees, he protests and says we do not understand the data, so I pull up the original report, run it showing the team that indeed the problem has been solved. I emailed the report to Derp thinking that the problem was solved. Silly me. The next day Derp asks the group about how to delete a temporary table, a problem that would easily be solved with a commit. Herp suggests using the commit (Herp is a dumbass). I interject and ask what he is going. Again Derp is working on the same report. I explain again that an Inner Join is all that is needed. Derp concedes slightly ""..perhaps an Inner Join will work but I don't want to do it that way, because it is not the correct way to solve the problem. The correct way to solve the problem is to solve each subset of the problem then to combine the results. This is basic computer science."" (In his head: First get first data, determine if data should be in report, if data should be in report add to a table repeat process until each record is considered 1 time.)  He was being condescending and stupid at the same time. So I have my revenge: I explain to Derp that the language he is using is call SQL and SQL has solved this type of problem decades ago. Derp makes a remark that the team is out to get him and is unwilling to help, he then goes to lunch. He hints that management is going to come down on us pretty hard once he explains the situation to them. So here's where the story ends: I give the report I created months ago to the other group. I ask them to delete the table, the import script, and any other tables called temp*, I then apologise profusely for the time spent on this report, and ask them to come directly to me for all future requests. I then tell management that we found an easy solution to the report I use a term they like ""quick win"". Lastly I tell Derp that the report has been submitted and that all future reports will be assigned to myself and that he should request a new assignment."

But if it is more complex, as some of our clients' are, it could take someone with only a little bit of tax knowledge a fair bit of time to file their taxes.  People go to a tax office because of the ease of it. Sure you could spend time hunting a deer for dinner, or you could just go to the super market and pick up some already dead cow."
talesfromthejob,sp2qp,plonce,-9,Wed Apr 25 02:38:55 2012 UTC,"Well, it's in your interest to make it sound as daunting as possible since you work for a tax preparation firm.  I've done ""complex"" returns involving multiple businesses, estates, holdings, etc, and it's never hard doing the taxes myself.  Anybody can do them, it's as easy as tying a pair of shoelaces.  Get your receipts and forms in order, fill in the boxes, done."

talesfromthejob,skk6k,kilamumster,1 point,Wed Jun 20 21:24:16 2012 UTC,I read the headline and was perfectly willing to go out and hit more people and post stories about it here.   Then realised it's not what you meant.   Guess I should start apologising to people in my office.  Might wait a bit. Some of them are still mad.
talesfromthejob,ro41r,DFTBAwesome,11,Sun Apr 1 16:46:06 2012 UTC,"Don't you like it when someone says they were able to do something before when you know for a fact it was never possible? ""You used to carry this and I used to be able to do that and just last week this was here and...""  No, it wasn't. I've been here for years and we've never carried that, you've never been able to do that, and nothing was ever over there. You're mistaken."
talesfromthejob,ro41r,I_Magician,2,Sun Apr 1 20:04:18 2012 UTC,"Off topic, sorry- but are you a nerdfighter?"
talesfromthejob,ro41r,breathesrain,3,Mon Apr 2 01:02:20 2012 UTC,I am. 100%
talesfromthejob,ro41r,killstructo,5,Mon Apr 2 03:22:32 2012 UTC,I thought people in Canada were super nice.  Apparently the assholes must being going out of there way to go to your gas station.
talesfromthejob,ro41r,plonce,1 point,Sun Apr 1 17:04:52 2012 UTC,"People can be such animals.  Sorry you have to deal with that shit.  But as for the garbage, I think there's 3 things every service station needs to provide free of charge as a show of good will towards existing and potentially future clients: Free windshield wash, free garbage receptacles, free air for tires."
talesfromthejob,ro41r,killstructo,3,Mon Apr 2 01:03:49 2012 UTC,"I think the trash at her gas station is free, she was talking about that big dumpster that the company uses to throw away boxes and such."
talesfromthejob,ro41r,quaggas,2,Mon Apr 2 02:21:41 2012 UTC,"Free air, man.  Near where I live there are two gas stations.  One charges for air, one doesn't.  Why bother charging when there is another place five seconds away that has free air?"
talesfromthejob,ro41r,thedeepfriedboot,1 point,Fri Apr 27 04:40:03 2012 UTC,"Usually the air is free for customers or if you ask nicely. The cashier usually has a remote to turn the air on. They are not going to argue over $0.25 and loose a customer. However, if you show up and start being a dick to them, they will make you pay for it."
talesfromthejob,ro41r,fixalated,1 point,Thu May 3 01:49:03 2012 UTC,"It must be something special at the station you have seen this. I manage 20 gas stations and there is no remote for it, we have multiple types of machines and none have a remote even as an option.  I'd have to even say we may break even on those machines charging fiddy cents, the initial cost is quite a bit and maintenance costs suck (cut off hoses,water vapour freezing in lines or in the compressor head, scrappers stealing the air chuck for the bronze, etc)"
talesfromthejob,ro41r,thedeepfriedboot,1 point,Mon Jul 9 12:50:13 2012 UTC,"Wow, those locations must suck. The place I went to basically had a garage door remote with a wall mount bracket to activate the unit. Do you work for franchised national stations like Chevron or Shell, or are you working for a 3rd party station?"
talesfromthejob,ro41r,fixalated,1 point,Mon Jul 9 19:32:59 2012 UTC,"It's an independent chain of stations, but I wouldn't judge it or whether or not they have a remote for the air pump, but I'll mark your vote of ""must suck"" none the less.  The station where you threaten boycotting over a quarter may have installed a type of remote system typically used in aftermarket remote door locks systems for cars. All you would need to do is wiring in the receiver to a relay. Beats having you open your change purse and having the moths fly all over...."
talesfromthejob,ro41r,Ddraig,1 point,Tue Jul 10 05:08:01 2012 UTC,"The guy that refused to pay the 1 penny makes sense to me. There is a unit I the gas pumps that has to be calibrate (can't think of it right now) as it can cause it to jump, before it has even pumped any fuel."
talesfromthejob,ro41r,fixalated,1 point,Mon Jul 2 19:09:38 2012 UTC,"That's more when a pump starts, typically when the check valve at the bottom of the pump is faulty allowing fuel to drain back slightly. When the next customer picks it up to fuel it refills what drained back.  Overpumping a penny is just being too forceful with the trigger. remember some pumps spit out over 10 Gallons a minute, it's like filling shot glasses with a fire hose.  Why can't these people be happy with 19.98 or .99 I'll fucken never know."
