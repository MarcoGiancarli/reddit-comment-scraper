continuityporn,3d2leq,slammyfart,6,Mon Jul 13 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"It seems like the end might be, but the head bob seems to match almost perfectly."
continuityporn,3d2leq,BindeDSA,2,Mon Jul 13 03:23:26 2015 UTC,no it seems like near the end of the gif it's cutting the corner of the building in the MoS scene but that happens almost immediately in the BvS gif. Coz the end of the gif at the top in MoS is clearly a horizontal movement but in MoS it's vertical.
continuityporn,3d2leq,slammyfart,3,Mon Jul 13 12:11:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely a horizontal sweep at the end of MOS - he scans along the windowline on more of one side of the building. In the BvS trailer there's just a very slight vertical bob there. This may also be nitpicking, but in MoS, he appears to be a lot closer to the wall on his left (from his perspective) whereas from the BvS clip, it looks like he's standing very near what would be the the wall to his right (the left side of the building in the shot).  All of that said, minor details, and it's decent continuity."
continuityporn,3d2leq,TheHYPO,2,Mon Jul 13 13:47:31 2015 UTC,MoS has more heat vision than shown here but the camera is facing zod so it's harder to match up visually but I suspect the correct sync is with some different frames.
continuityporn,3d2leq,23423423423451,3,Mon Jul 13 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"Or it's possible they simply didn't go shot-by shot and line it up precisely, but rather did whatever looked best for the BvS shot."
continuityporn,3d2leq,TheHYPO,2,Mon Jul 13 16:36:38 2015 UTC,I think it's really setting off my OCD coz i dont even want to click on it to check what you've said but I'll take your word for it
continuityporn,3d2leq,slammyfart,8,Tue Jul 14 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"As close as it maybe, I dont think its the exact same scene.  In the MOS gif, he's shooting a constant beam, never stops.  In the BvS gif, as the beam goes through the corner, it stops and then starts again like 5 floors underneath from where it started. Also (assuming the gifs are synced in timing), in the MOS gif, he looks down, up, and then to his left. In MvS, it seems like the beam goes down then up in a half circular pattern up ending with him looking to his right, you can kinda see what the outside of the building looks like. I may be completely wrong and this might be the same scene and amazing gesture of continuity but I wouldnt say they nailed it."
continuityporn,3d2leq,Johnnybgood92,24,Mon Jul 13 02:40:42 2015 UTC,"It's the same. the reason is stops for a second is because his head flicks faster than the beam could melt the building. once he slowed his head down, it made it all the way through."

continuityporn,3b2x5c,lyonsames,38,Thu Jun 25 15:13:59 2015 UTC,I don't buy that the entire story was planned out.    It would be just as easy to look back on your work and take that minor character and flesh him out later.  Breaking Bad did this all the time.  Neat that the writer did strive for consistency though.
continuityporn,3b2x5c,Ninjabackwards,8,Thu Jun 25 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, I do think that Oda was planned that from the start. The reason why Rayleigh was shown so early is to connect Shanks to him, therefore connecting Shanks to the Gold Roger (that would be the reason why Shanks has Gold Roger's Strawhat). It's very unlikely that Oda just thought up of Shanks being on the Pirate King's crew on the chapters just before he revealed that the strawhat actually belongs to Gold Roger. Therefore, Oda was intending for that minor character to be the vice captain of Gold Roger (he actually said to Toei Animation that Buggy should refer to that ""side character"" as vice captain. But, I also believe that Oda hasn't planned up EVERYTHING. Some very small details (like names of characters, names of islands, etc.) are just thought up by him as he is drawing it (e.g. he may have intended for the vice captain to appear on a very early chapter, but I don't think he already knew what his name was going to be on that time he drew him). I also think that the main plot is already planned very carefully.  TLDR: Oda planned for that minor character to be the vice captain of Gold Roger to connect Shank's strawhat to Gold Roger"

continuityporn,3b2x5c,Captain_Condoriano,3,Thu Jun 25 21:12:08 2015 UTC,Did the same thing with the introduction of Jinbe :)
continuityporn,3b2x5c,Undeadninjas,4,Thu Jun 25 20:54:58 2015 UTC,"The only thing this means is that they went and grabbed an unnamed character that was shown in an early chapter, gave him a name and title that fits with the role he was portraying, and went with it.  Or alternatively they were thinking, ""We need a Vice Captain to the Pirate King here... is there anyone we introduced early in the show that could fit that description?"" and then filled in the details.   It's nice when they do that, but it doesn't mean they had it planned out."
continuityporn,3b2x5c,TotesMessenger,4,Fri Jun 26 03:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think that he was already intending for that character to be the vice captain. My arguments:   Why else would he draw that character with a very distinct facial hair? He drew him that way so that he can be easily be recognized when he introduces him in the future. Also, why else would he explicitly say to Toei Animation that Buggy must refer to that minor character as ""vice captain""? The animation studio might mistake that detail for being a minor, changeable detail. When he said that to the studio, he obviously already knew that that character is a major one. I think it's unlikely (but possible) that he hadn't already planned for Shanks and Buggy to be the Pirate King's crew members. He used Buggy's flashback as a detail to connect Shanks to the Pirate King, therefore making it possible that Luffy's strawhat originally belonged to the Pirate King.  edit: wrong formatting"

continuityporn,37eqyc,tha_dood,9,Wed May 27 22:26:34 2015 UTC,How could you even see the rope through your tears in that scene?
continuityporn,37eqyc,benkenobi39,8,Thu May 28 07:45:21 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons that I fell in love with this movie was this tiny insignificant detail. I assume that these two scenes were not shot on the same day, since they take place on two different sets. The audience would never even notice this detail since it is easily explained away. For instance, there are several minutes after his escape in which he could have removed the rope and several scene jumps where he could have removed it off camera. We as the audience would have been none the wiser and not at all upset with it's disappearance. However, the fact that it remains on his leg creates a wonderful continuity and throws extra emotion into the scene. What I mean to say is that the rope's continued presence gives insight into Will's character's metal state. So I guess the rope isn't insignificant after all."

continuityporn,37eqyc,johnchapel,-1,Wed May 27 22:26:06 2015 UTC,"Continuity porn is like in Simpsons Season 2, Homer recounts his first date with marge where she taught him french and he said ""Por Vu"", then in mid Season 3, he recounts another story later in life where Marge is pregnant and he proposes with an Onion Ring and goes ""Marge, Por Vu"".  A dude putting on a hat and then wearing it later in the film isn't continuity.  edit; also basically everything in Community and Arrested Development is a shmorgasbord of continuity porn."

continuityporn,35rnfp,nojustno,3,Wed May 13 16:15:51 2015 UTC,"Squirrel (The Duke) (from Adventuretime wikia):       The squirrel is briefly shown in ""The Duke,"" and is known as one of Jake's enemies because Jake will not publish his letter in his newspaper column ""Begs the Question."" Whenever this squirrel appears on the screen, it seems that he plays the same quick-tempo song. He has a high-pitched voice. He is seen reading a newspaper article, but becomes angry when he sees that his letter was not answered. He tries to make Jake notice his letter after dropping it, but this fails when Jake just walks over it. At the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty, the squirrel, disguised as the turtle chairman of the meeting, plots to kill Jake with the help of Marquis of Nuts, who was trying to kill Finn. Jake claims not to know the squirrel at all, making him even more angry. Although the outcome of the battle was not revealed, Finn and Jake most likely won.

continuityporn,353rkd,Vonman,2,Thu May 7 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"I realise i'm replying to this 12 days later so apologies (this sub isn't the most active unfortunately) but the faulty step is more than a gag, it's a story device on more than once occasion too.   The ones that immediately pop to mind are when Claire is trying to take a family picture with everyone lined up on the stairs but believes the faulty step will somehow ruin everything and tries to fix it, she even admits to how illogical the idea is but carries on and makes it worse so they have to abandon the idea of doing the picture on the stairs. Then there's the episode where the Earthquake hits, which comes after Phil fixes it and it breaks again and he's running around trying to fix everything before he lets Claire out of the bathroom (she gets stuck there in the Earthquake). And in the episode where Claire is sick and Phil does all her chores, he feels inadequate because he can't find a faulty smoke alarm in his house that keeps beeping and tripping on the step makes him feel even worse, a smaller example but it adds to the story.  I think it's meant to represent some kind of inadequacy in Phil and Claire's lives, everything about their family, work and love life but there is always a faulty step along the way that trips them up."

continuityporn,34yuy2,rain_wizard,2,Wed May 6 08:22:21 2015 UTC,"Late to the thread, but I feel like you're not getting the best possible explanation of what a non-decimal base actually is here.  This is the way digits work: the first digit in a number is n-times the base raised to the zeroth power (i.e. 1). The second digit is n-times the base raised to the first power (i.e. n). The third base is n-times the base squared, etc. Then you add them all together.  So in base 10, when you write 6429, you're writing 9*100 + 2*101 + 4*102 + 6*103, or 9 + 20 + 400 + 6000 = 6429  In base 8, however, when you write 6429, you're writing 9*80 + 2*81 + 4*82 + 6*83, which is 9 + 16 + 256 + 3072 = 3353 in base 10."

continuityporn,348qo4,autowikibot,2,Wed Apr 29 14:39:02 2015 UTC,"Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy:       The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (also known as the Cornetto trilogy or the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy)   is a series of British comedic genre films directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright and Simon Pegg, produced by Nira Park, and starring Pegg and Nick Frost. The trilogy consists of Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World's End (2013).  The name originates from a ""silly joke"" during the promotion of Hot Fuzz.  Wright had written in the use of Cornetto ice cream as a hangover cure for Frost's character in Shaun of the Dead based on his own experiences. Within Hot Fuzz, Wright included a brief couple of throwaway scenes that called back to the Cornetto joke in Shaun. On the promotional tour of Hot Fuzz during production of The World's End, one interviewer pointed out the use of Cornetto in the first two films, to which Wright jokingly stated they represented a trilogy comparable to Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours film trilogy.     Following this, Wright took serious consideration of thinking of the three movies as a trilogy, and wrote out The World's End to complete themes set out in the earlier films, including placing a Cornetto reference in the film. Each film in the trilogy is connected to a specific Cornetto flavour appearing in each film.   Shaun of the Dead features a strawberry-flavoured Cornetto, which signifies the film's bloody and gory elements,  Hot Fuzz includes the blue original Cornetto, to signify the police element to the film,  and The World's End features the green mint chocolate chip flavour (though only shown by a wrapper caught in the wind) in a nod to aliens and science fiction.  According to Wright, Wall's, manufacturer of the Cornetto, were ""very pleased with the namecheck"".   Wright considered each of the films a ""Trojan horse"", ""genre films that have a relationship comedy smuggled inside a zombie movie, a cop movie and a sci-fi movie"".  Thematically, Wright saw each of the films containing common themes of ""the individuals in a collective [...] about growing up and [...] about the dangers of perpetual adolescence"".  Wright reworked the script of The World's End to culminate and conclude on these themes.  The films are further linked by a common set of actors. Wright, Park, Pegg, and Frost collaborated previously in the TV series Spaced from 1999 to 2001. Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Rafe Spall, Julia Deakin, Patricia Franklin, and Garth Jennings appear in each of the films as well as other projects by Wright and Pegg. Clark Collis observes in Entertainment Weekly that the films also feature ""a running gag involving garden fences"".

Cramming all of a year's South park into 3 months instead of splitting the season in half means we miss out on up to the minute satire for a majority of the year.
