After you played throu the game with all 3 different choices, it becomes clear that you are stuck in a loop, as your real body is in a sort of coma/dream-trip.

gamemusic,3djk8d,DawsonJBailey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:03 2015 UTC,I think the fact that it made no sense and that it was so obtuse and esoteric in every aspect is the reason I liked it. It's sort of a little less of a game and more of an experience.
gamemusic,3djk8d,orcusmalorcus,3,Fri Jul 17 11:24:50 2015 UTC,Its worth it just for the gun-play alone.
gamemusic,3djk8d,holben,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, this game isn't so bad.  It has a steep learning curve and it is a very niche title, but it is also a rich and unique universe.  If you dig the aesthetic, it might be worth the time it takes to learn."
gamemusic,3djk8d,Cosmic_Bard,3,Thu Jul 16 23:56:40 2015 UTC,"That's cuz the game isn't bad, at all lol. It's not well polished maybe, and its not your standard heres a gun, shoot them bad guys action fps maybe. But it's a rather unique title that had a lot of enjoyable elements that could've used some more polish."
gamemusic,3djk8d,cosmicturtle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:25:46 2015 UTC,It seems like it's a case of trying to do too much with too little.

gamemusic,3djk8d,Sundeiru,3,Fri Jul 17 04:11:09 2015 UTC,It was in dev for around 7 years or so. What game needed is bigger budget and someone experienced to guide eva along the line.

The game was an FPS with a lot of good ideas, but none that were executed well.  It's an... interesting game, but not a good one.  Even so, I think I put about 70-80 hours into it."
gamemusic,3djk8d,Sundeiru,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"What platform(I'm assuming PC)? General synopsis? Also that description you gave reminded me of Pitch Black for Playstation because it seemed so strange at the time i played it. I wanted to like it and did to a point, but was majorly confused throughout. Idk."
gamemusic,3djk8d,LobsterDoctor,3,Fri Jul 17 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"http://store.steampowered.com/app/91700/  It is a PC game, created by Streum On and published in 2011. The plot is... weird.  Your character is part of a unified task force / clan / brotherhood with the goal of maintaining order in a world strewn with chaos and corruption in a cyberpunk future.   While out on a combat deployment, your team was attacked, and you are the lone survivor.  Crawling back to base, you slowly come to realize the significance of that attack and have to sort out meaning based on the context of future missions and how people react to you back home.    Or at least, that's my interpretation.  Things make less and less sense as you progress, until the very end when it all comes together. I liked the game for the things it tried to do.  Lots of different play styles are viable, and available to the player from the begining of the game.  It incorporated RPG elements and a boatload of stats that you can raise however you want. The game also allowed you to create your own difficulty in terms of enemy behavior and spawn rates.  For example, you could have tons of weakened enemies with poor vision and mow them down Serious Sam style.  Or you could have a small number of strong enemies and take a stealth approach.  The game gives you ranged and melee weapons, shadowrun style technology, and magical powers to tackle different missions with however much difficulty you want.    All in all, the game is rather short, taking maybe 8-10 hours on my first play through. Your character's cash, experience, and tech tree carries over, and there are several missions that have branching paths.  Completing each path once unlocks additional content.  Edit: Here's Jim Sterling's description of hacking in E.Y.E. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI1BFarGm4Y It's a pretty effective explanation."
gamemusic,3djk8d,Sundeiru,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:41 2015 UTC,Ok so after a good googling (giggity) I discovered that I may not have remembered the name of the game properly. It was a sci fi 3rd person action adventure shooter for the original Playstation with Bosk looking aliens sometimes. EDIT: FADE TO BLACK WAS THE NAME OF THAT GAME!
gamemusic,3djmrb,PUSClFER,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:33 2015 UTC,Its a shame... I was planning to think about things today.
gamemusic,3djj5c,LuigiBrick,2,Thu Jul 16 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely an underrated track right here.  I think a lot of folks were hoping for something more intense, but I think this still works; sounds like you're entering the enemy's territory, but they haven't detected you yet. You know they eventually will; it's just a matter of when the chaos starts."
gamemusic,3djj5c,Mudkiprocketship3003,2,Fri Jul 17 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"It's a solid track, but it feels like they really built on it and made it work in the later New Super Mario Bros. titles."

gamemusic,3d9be9,arcticfire1,12,Tue Jul 14 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"Getting to Metropolis Zone was a treat.  Pretty late in the game, so you had to work to get there.  But the payoff was that intense music.  Oh, man.  What a thrill that always was as a kid.  And it was such a change getting past it and hitting Sky Chase and having that super chill, flighty song afterwards.  That soundtrack told the story of the levels perfectly.  I can't imagine how they composed it all so perfectly."
gamemusic,3d9be9,Turious,3,Tue Jul 14 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"The Metropolis Zone/Sky Chase dichotomy was perfect. I only got there once, I remember thinking how nice it was to have a slower level after Metropolis. The pacing really was top notch."

It doesn't even use PCM samples or the PSG! It's all FM synths, including FM percussion. This OST uses the YM2612 really well.  I recommend listening to the 50hz version as it is the original. Tracks 00, 02, 03, and 04 are amazing."

gamemusic,3d9be9,drakethatsme,5,Tue Jul 14 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"You're right, Thunder Force IV is a nice soundtrack."
gamemusic,3d9be9,Colorfag,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"Segas first party games always seemed to make amazing use of the FM chip. I dont think many, if any, third parties ever made as good music as Sega did on the Genesis."
gamemusic,3d9be9,TheArcanos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"That's because SEGA hired those who knew how to make FM instruments and compositions. Well, they did use a very similar chip, YM2151, before the Genesis on their arcade machines.   I usually refer songs to their composers but there are plenty of third parties that made great music.   TechnoSoft, imo, made great music like SEGA. Listen to Metal Squad from Thunder Force IV. Actually, listen to the whole TFIV OST, it's kick ass from both metal to chill music. I also recommend TFIII and their other games.  From now own, I'll just list the name of companies, but I'll give you a website that lists Genesis music by rating. This is the website's list by rating, they have a javascript player so you could play music on the page of a game.  Anyways, on to the somewhat short but not full list.   Konami Sunsoft Compile Capcom Namco Data East TechnoSoft   There's more, but it's mostly dependent on the composers, not the company.  I posted this above in a different post but listen to this third party Time Trax's OST by Tim Follin. Easily the best thing that came out of a Genesis back in the 90's for that genre. Listen it in 50hz as it's the original. Track 00, 02, 03, and 04 are my personal favorites.  EDIT: I would also like to add that it also depends on the sound driver the composers are composing on, as some of them, like GEMS, are very limited in terms of instruments and effects."
gamemusic,3d9be9,Pata4AllaG,11,Wed Jul 15 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"Emerald Hill: Bright, bouncy and fun. A great way to introduce what's to come for both music and gameplay.   Chemical Plant: Fast-paced techno-vibe, this song is as heart-pounding as the Zone it accompanies.   Aquatic Ruin: Latin groove, exotic, mysterious and playful, but with a sense of danger. Speed and water, a strange combination of themes, this song perfectly captures the feel of this Zone.   Casino Night: Swanky, sleazy shuffle. This song elicits flashy neon lights and jackpots, the feeling of ""hit it big"" or ""be left with nothing.""    Hill Top: For the most part, a cool, breezy, free-flowing tune. The finial point of the song (just before it begins to loop again), sounds like what a hiker might do as he gazes over a cliff he just about walked off of, sort of a ""Yikes!"" moment.   Mystic Cave: Spooky, creeping, growling bass line, lots of shimmer and glitter. The wavy synths make it sound like a Halloween novelty ghost toy is singing to you.   Oil Ocean: Arabic scales, with both bass and melody providing equal parts haunting and challenging.   Metropolis: Thumping, determined beat. Really conveys the sense of machinery, sparks and gears.   Sky Chase: Lofty, flighty tune. Soft and easy-going, both the level design and the song are a chance for the player to catch their breath after the three-Zone gauntlet of Metropolis.   Wing Fortress: Triumphant, daunting and heavy.    Final Stage: Unnerving and chaotic.   Stage Boss: Threatening and powerful.  Final Boss: A ""big brother"" to the Stage Boss theme. Absolutely menacing.   Special Stage: Dreamlike, ecstatic. How a racing tune should sound.  Ending Theme: Majestic, somber."

gamemusic,3daval,cantbecool,5,Tue Jul 14 21:10:14 2015 UTC,The SNES and Genesis era...there was never a pair of consoles so completely opposite in their sound reproduction. So few multiplatform games on both systems sounded equal. They always extremely favored one system over the other.
gamemusic,3daval,Mozgus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:35:43 2015 UTC,I specifically remember Y's III had a wildy different sounding score depending on which system you bought it on.  The best one IMHO was the PC-Engine version.
gamemusic,3daval,Viceroy_Fizzlebottom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:24:48 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, Ys III. I agree really. The PCE made the OST sound really badass. I'd say that the original PC-88 version is great as well. The Genesis stayed very close to the PC-88 music wise with better percussion and stereo use (very similar synthesizers). I felt like the SNES version was lacking instrumentation wise and sounded flat at times compared to the other versions.  There is this guy who has decent comparisons of Ys III's music on his channel (although the retro consoles are emulated, so they might not sound as great as it could). Here is a comparison of Valestine Castle."
gamemusic,3daval,TheArcanos,4,Tue Jul 14 22:54:33 2015 UTC,"This sounds emulated, don't get me wrong, the Genesis is definitely capable of playing at that quality, but it's missing the ride cymbals (or it's simply inaudible) in Go Straight. Emulation tends to sound harsher.  This is the OST recorded from actual hardware. This was recorded back when the uploader did not have an audio mod on his Genesis (to give it the best quality possible), so it doesn't sound as clear as it could be."

gamemusic,3da700,ShawnS52,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"I know it seems terrible to do this, but I hate auto tagged music. When I buy a digital album, I always organize every single ID3 tag by hand, sorted in folder by album. It keeps everything nice and neat. In physical media, I put them on a shelf and organize them in an A-Z order. When dealing with Vinyl, I order them from Z-A on a shelf. I also like to rip my game CD's for on the go listening, as I have a smartphone with alot of external memory. I like to also manually tag all my ripped albums. If you were to see my dedicated music folder on my hard drive, from digital purchases to ripped audio from my personal collection, you would see it all organized alphabetically by folder name. Each folder is named with the album it goes with. My biggest concern about ID3 in general is when two or more artists collab on a song. The artist information gets really messy."
gamemusic,3da700,Balto_Husky,2,Wed Jul 15 10:44:59 2015 UTC,"No way, I'm the same. Any time I try a new program I make sure auto-tagging is OFF before I let it near my music. Maybe it's curmudgeonly but I like to tag things myself, my way. I hate dealing with Artist vs. Album Artist tags too. I always end up with a huge clump of ""Various Artists"".   Your collection sounds immaculately organized though! I really need to do the same with mine and start putting it in series folders. For example, a Street Fighter folder that has the dozen remix/arrange albums I've gathered over the years."

I have my music folder all organized immaculately, but within that folder is a folder named ""#0 - To Organize"" that sits at the way top. I go through that folder at least 2 hours a day, and move all the organized, freshly re-edited ID3 tagged music into their respective folders in my music folder. The best advice I have for you is to move your entire unorganized lot of music into an Organize sub folder and get to work on that one song at a time. It's hard work, but it pays off in the end."

The overall style of the music is the same throughout as befits a fighting game, but the stylistic changes in each track really show each character's personality. I find Akihiko's and Rise's to be particularly good examples, but it's evident in every character theme. Meguro consistently puts out quality tracks, the man is talented."

I'm hard pressed to find a game made in the past ten years that ends with as much satisfaction as this one."
gamemusic,3cxrd1,ricobanderas,9,Sun Jul 12 03:10:28 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:  Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain songs, such as ""To Far Away Times"", to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before Chrono Trigger, reflecting that the song was made in dedication to ""a certain person with whom I wanted to share a generation."" Mitsuda tried to use leitmotifs of the Chrono Trigger main theme to create a sense of consistency in the soundtrack. He also suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, regular Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene."

gamemusic,3cwgsg,Classic-Game-Junkie,4,Sat Jul 11 10:39:44 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on this: For the Gruntilda's Lair music, it was impossible to put all versions of the track into the same MIDI file, so there needed to be multiple versions of the track, each containing tracks from only areas that were close by. This also meant that the tracks for some areas appeared in multiple versions -- as well as the one you demonstrated, the Click Clock Wood lair music also needed its own version with the Furnace Fun lair music, which wouldn't have fit into the one you demonstrated."

Thinking back I guess most of the music only used 1-2 instruments at a time even though they were all great tracks. Damn, that makes Kirkhope even more impressive."
gamemusic,3cwgsg,Kodiologist,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:11:44 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting topic, but speculation about how something is implemented, without inspecting the source code or machine code or asking one of the programmers, is a risky business."
gamemusic,3cwgsg,holyice7,4,Sat Jul 11 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"In this case most of it has come from the source himself, through several interviews Grant Kirkhope has given. But I do make sure there's a disclaimer on each video stating that some of the information is speculative. Plus thanks to annotations I can always update a video if it's found to be inaccurate."
gamemusic,3cwgsg,Kodiologist,2,Sat Jul 11 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"Jeez, that thing you did with Audacity was a bit unnecessary. XD  The files with all instruments playing actually exist. X3  Apart from that, an explanation on the difference between sequenced and streamed formats (that sequenced music is a series of low memory calls to singular sounds, and stream is a high memory recording of unique sounds) could have been better.  On all, good video.  It's something I'm sure a lot of people that weren't interested in the music never really appreciated."

Mostly for texts so they wouldn't keep repeating.  While different reactions (SNAAAAAAAAKE!) are always fun, my personal fave were the codec ringing sounds. Simple, sweet and made it easy to pretend I'm a secret agent"

gamemusic,3cqtve,Birdrun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:29:33 2015 UTC,"I use the Mario coin sound as my text notification, enough to get the attention but not loud/long enough to be annoying."
gamemusic,3cqtve,matcap86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:15:52 2015 UTC,The ! sound is obnoxious but the Codex call sound works perfect.

gamemusic,3cqtve,SkyCoffee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:26:36 2015 UTC,Ive got the Final Fantasy Victory Theme for my ringtone and the xbox achivement tone for my alerts.  Makes me feel like ive acomplished many things throughout the day.
gamemusic,3cqtve,Wille304,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:29:21 2015 UTC,"I used the Kefka laugh as my notification sound for a long, long time. I've since switched to the FFVI ""you've saved your game"" sound effect. Less obnoxious to the people around me."

gamemusic,3cqtve,bookishboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:18:57 2015 UTC,"I use the Jinjo whistle sound from Banjo-Kazooie for my notification sound. Someone else said having something like that changes the way you hear it. I was playing BK a while back and whenever I heard that sound effect I got that slight anxiety to check my phone, they're definitely right!"
gamemusic,3cqtve,the_fern386,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:34 2015 UTC,I've been using the victory fanfare from final fantasy VII for years. Never gets old
gamemusic,3cqtve,sirrtaver,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:37:07 2015 UTC,F-zero X opening for notification alert.  But just the very first riff.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMEkPmJrKz8
gamemusic,3cqtve,HalftrackDeagle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:07:58 2015 UTC,For text messages I use the jingle from Duck Hunt that plays when the dog picks up and shows the ducks you shot.
gamemusic,3cqtve,beigemore,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:14:50 2015 UTC,Ringtone: Song of Storms (Ocarina of Time)  Notification: 1-up get (Super Mario Bros.)
gamemusic,3cqtve,alphaProto,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:35:57 2015 UTC,I've had the theme from Super Mario Bros. 2 (converted from MIDI sheet music so it sounds like a piano) as mine for about 3 years and I'm not changing it any time soon.

gamemusic,3cqtve,SupremeMaster007,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"I use the League of Legends chat notification for my texts. It's so funny seeing people's confused looks thinking they got an in game message,  or thinking their game is open."
gamemusic,3cqtve,paparo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:14:55 2015 UTC,"I use the Zelda OoT chest open jingle for texts, the Street Fighter III ""KO! You win!"" For emails/voicemails.  For my ringtone I use ""Ohh baby, A Triple!"""
gamemusic,3csbnh,juasjuasie,3,Fri Jul 10 11:09:02 2015 UTC,That was awesome.
gamemusic,3crr1x,st12vn,2,Fri Jul 10 06:22:31 2015 UTC,That was an exceptional cover.
gamemusic,3cs88o,Brother_Of_Boy,2,Fri Jul 10 10:22:36 2015 UTC,yeah this is prolly my favorite ninja gaiden remix next to ninja gaiden 2's remix that ashane did named ninjascape

gamemusic,3cqbfe,RebeccaETripp,2,Thu Jul 9 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"IMO this is a really bad medley. It's not even much of a medley. It's a small part of each song with a pause between each track, with no connection between them."
gamemusic,3cqbfe,Henry132,2,Fri Jul 10 00:37:09 2015 UTC,Agree. This is a medley.
gamemusic,3cqbfe,mecartistronico,0,Fri Jul 10 00:58:46 2015 UTC,"Well, the guy who made it is only 16, so I imagine he'll get better at transitions.  Personally, I was impressed."
gamemusic,3cqbfe,Henry132,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:41:12 2015 UTC,He's not even playing himself. It's just a midi. Not even sure he made the midi arrangement himself beyond cutting together existing midis.  And age is completely irrelevant.
