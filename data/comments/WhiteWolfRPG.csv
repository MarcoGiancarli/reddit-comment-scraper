WhiteWolfRPG,3e3ydm,YouAllMeetInATavern,8,Tue Jul 21 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"Magic is inherently only for a select few. Technology can be used by anyone. The inherent difference is tyranny (the other magical traditions) versus equality (technocracy). A world of chaos (aka: high magic) is antithetical to a world of order (aka: low/no magic). Magic is not evil, but it's horrific to imagine if magic ruled the universe rather than physics.  In my games, the Technocracy believes it is a force for good in the universe. A hidden guide and protector of the common man against the other magical traditions, demons, vampires, werewolves, etc. Granted, they are a soul-sucking secret conspiracy group that has already succeeded at taking over the world via its shadowy mega-corporation, but they would claim their heart was in the right place at the time and still is.  I like to introduce NPCs that are Allies or Contacts of the PCs, but are unaware of their supernatural nature at first and likewise, the players are unaware that the NPC is a low-level member of the Technocracy (the NPC might not even know that name, ""I work for Endron Oil as an Engineer.""). For example, a guy named Neil Ortega who is from a science background, he is a chemist and wants to help clean up the environment. He doesn't believe in god or the supernatural, he believes there is an order to the universe and it's called Physics. He loves the same sports and activities as the PC he's attached to and happens to have the Gift of Magic. The Technocracy is aware of this and is helping him to channel his gift into technological applications -- new ways to clean oil spills, for example using an experimental chemical. His research group are made up of similar low-level technocracy members and several are even gifted as well. His job is not to hunt down werewolves, he is doing the bread and butter work of the Technocracy.   What does the PC do when he discovers (or suspects) that his friend is a member of the dreaded Technocracy. How does he convince him that they are evil and the supernatural is real? How does Neil react to that? He might be very sympathetic to his friend if it's presently well or think his friend is crazy. Most likely if it's presented poorly, Neil might believe in the supernatural, but realize it's dangerous and not know what to do next. What if his friend convinces him that the Technocracy stands against supernatural kind? Neil might go talk to his supervisor about his ""special friend"" who thinks he's a werewolf... :-)"
WhiteWolfRPG,3e3ydm,UnpricedToaster,4,Tue Jul 21 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"Technology is the protector of the masses. Most are still loyal to the idea behind the ""declaration of ivory tower"": The governor of men will be men himself.  Common people is unprotected against fluctuations in reality and the only thing they have to secure themselves is the stability of reality. Which they form with their worldviews. That's why Technocracy is fighting against ""reality deviant""s.  I once played a renegade Technocrat. A guy who still believes in Technocratic ideals but disapproves their methods. He had to seek sanction among mages -still defending his view on dangerous consequences of magic. He didn't survive long as expected."
WhiteWolfRPG,3e3ydm,Scoloti,3,Tue Jul 21 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's a protection/liberty thing.  The technocrats offer a better life but they hide the truth.  But then again who's to say their paradigm is wrong?  Who's to say they aren't doing what's best for the world?  And not every technocrat is in on the secret, in fact few are, so the average guy is just doing his job fighting those crazy guys who think magic is real.    So really it's pretty easy to give a technocrat party motivations that are pure, and also make technocrat antagonists that a player may not see as evil.  In a game i played i met someone working for them but when she realised i was a mage she started to freak out because to her i was a crazy fanatic, and she worked for the good guys.  It's all political, even from a meta perspective.  Nobody is right so it's easy to show the moral grey areas."

The site itself seems to be half-nonexistent, but there's a few things in this rpg.net thread talking all about this game.   Incidentally, they call their setting the ""World of Damnation,"" like ours at first glance, but darker, with vampires manipulating mortals, werewolves stalking the streets sometimes hunting vampires, and mortal wizards work to research their craft and defend humanity against the supernatural onslaught.  ""One of the more popular legends tells the story of the Biblical Kaiyne. Cursed to be immortal he sets up the first city, Enoch and raises his family.""  Also, their vampire's blood magics are called thaumaturgy. Hardly White Wolf's invention, but if you're making a politically oriented, Vampire themed game, you might want to make an effort to distinguish yourself from the competitor who predates you by 20 years and continues to put out books of that style.  Oh, and what does their game offer that similar ones don't? ""That's easy. In our games we have a very simple system which allows for targeting and called-shots. Many other LARP games (roleplaying games for that matter) do not allow for ""called shots"" or targeting. In our game, you can target a single person/object/creature or many and the system tells you how much more difficult it will be to hit that many targets without over-complicating the game."""

From what I have read about playing Malks, I always thought I should make a character first and a derangement second to avoid making my character become a Looney Tune stereotype. But the direction I intend on going with my character's derangement is that every now and then, he still has these flashbacks of his lynching. While they do torment him severely, it also serves as his reminders in fulfilling his greatest ambition: to ascend to a noble status and ensure that all those beneath him know their place. In life, he was able to at least tone his traumatic images down a notch by drinking bottles of booze. But since his Embrace, booze can't even give him a buzz. Blood can't provide him even a slightly similar result. He'd go so far as to bang his head to make them go away or something else.   That's the idea I have anyway. :)"

WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,VerifiedBank,8,Mon Jul 20 23:04:14 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the skills and (more rarely, imo) attributes overlap slightly.  With regards to presence and manipulation, remember the attributes are also split into Power, Finesse and Resistance.  Presence (Power) is something about the way your character looks, the way they carry themselves, the weight of their speech. A low presence character is unlikely to stand out much, people won't pick them out of a line up. A high presence character draws people in, just looking at them they should have a sense of power or influence about them.  Manipulation (Finesse) is more of... an active use? Your character wants something and they move people, they say the right words, they flash the right smiles to the right people. A low manipulation character might upset people by accident, they might be too shy. A high manipulation character knows what people around them want, they might plan several steps ahead, looking at the ramifications of their actions and changing things subtly to get what they want.  In this instance, I really recommend just looking in the core nWoD book. It gives a sample text for each, some examples of who would have high or low of the attribute and how it is used."
WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,thenagainmaybenot,4,Mon Jul 20 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"I like to look at it as means versus ends. World of Darkness has several ways to accomplish the same social task which works really well (imo) for fleshing out the details of a social scene.   Presence is great for characters who command attention, and Manipulation is key for characters who need more fine-tune social control.   Expression governs your ability to convey your thoughts eloquently. Socialize is your ability to mix and integrate with people. Persuasion is your ability to convince someone to do or believe something.   All skills can qualify, but what skill used determines the nuance of the scene. A speech rousing the people to take up arms would be Presence + Persuasion. A toast would be likely be Presence + Expression, but Socialize might work as a substitute; is the character using their articulation and word play, or their experience with the crowd and a good anecdote? You might even substitute Manipulation for Presence if you're trying to give a happy toast with a backhanded slight to another party member."
WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,thenagainmaybenot,3,Tue Jul 21 05:18:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly! They might overlap, but by using a different skill/attribute you get the job done in a slightly different way. I had a similar thought, but my comment was already rather long :P"
WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,malonkey1,6,Tue Jul 21 14:01:06 2015 UTC,The short version?  Presence is your ability to command attention. A person uses Presence to get their way by demanding it.  Manipulation is your ability to convince others of something. A person uses Manipulation to get their way by convincing others that it's a good idea.
WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,bonreu,4,Mon Jul 20 23:55:45 2015 UTC,"I see the difference between Presence and manipulation in this matter as Presence makes them think you know what you are doing, what you will do will be the best thing that can be done, while manipulation would be convincing them that what you are saying is the best thing. But that's just my 2 cents"
WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,nifara,4,Mon Jul 20 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"So, the way I see it:  Presence is the force attribute, so it's all about raw simple effect. It's flashing a smile to flirt, looming over someone to intimidate and being a damn cool guy to persuade.  Manipulation is about finesse, so it's about careful and precise influence. You flirt by subtly building someone up (and maybe making them feel inadequate if that's how you roll), you drop the right hints in conversation to suggest you can make bad things happen and thus scare the shit out of someone, and you persuade someone by explaining things in a way that appeals, playing to their weaknesses and picking the right topics to discuss.  The best example of the difference between the two can be found in the rules for seduction. Seduction opens with a Presence roll - you check each other out across the bar. There's no time for cunning or subtlety, it's all about raw charisma and appeal. Once you make contact, however, it becomes manipulation - can you worm your way into bed with your target? Can you say just the right thing at just the right time? Can you make it seem like their idea?  As for the oration: giving a speech as a form of entertainment would be Expression. That would cover formal oratory, dinner party speeches, comedy gigs and so on. The impassioned speech made by the firebrand preacher to a single member of his congregation would be Persuasion, but the prepared sermon for the whole church is Expression. Neither use would fall under Socialise, which is more about understanding the social rules and parameters of a situation and using them to your advantage."
WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,DeadpoolNakago,2,Tue Jul 21 05:49:37 2015 UTC,"One way I try to differentiate between the attributes, in a mechanical sense:   If the roll is contested, then use the power stat (Presence), if the roll is uncontested, use the Finesse stat (Manipulation)  Its not an all across the board application, but it's helped me in considering how to use each one and in which situations. I've kind of, too, gotten to the point where Wits and Manipulation vs Intelligence and Presence sort of blur the line with me.   As for the skills, especially the ones you listed and the specific situation, they're already established in the books. But, still, if you want to have something on the spot, check for specialties and see what they mention.   You nail expression pretty good as acting, musical performance, speech writing, etc. A monologue I'd consider to be expression. Persuasion I'd use more for debate type formats and situations. One on one interactions and convincing someone to do something. A stump speech in this case i'd call persuasion. Socialize I'd consider more, like, mingling and for information dissemination and gathering."
WhiteWolfRPG,3e066w,Zifnab25,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"Even in nWoD, the attribute system needs work.  I tried house-ruling a system comparable to physical combat.  You ""attack"" with your finesse trait and do ""damage"" equal to power, which your target can ""soak"" with Resistance.  So when making a speech, you'd roll Manip+Expression and do Successes+Presence in ""damage"", hoping to exceed the target's Composure as Difficulty.  The system ended up being too far off what was traditional, and I scrapped it, going with a fast-and-loose ""Roll what feels good and I'll figure out something based on your successes"" approach.  The TL;DR; is don't spend too much time thinking about it.  If a trait sounds like it works, use it.  If it doesn't fit, say ""I'm the ST, and it doesn't work"", and leave it at that.  Don't worry about overlap and don't loose sleep over players trying to min-max social rolls.  I've yet to see the game suffer because players were too eager to talk their way out of a situation."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyk73,uberguby,9,Mon Jul 20 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"The White-Wolf Wiki has a page dedicated to the timeline of the original World of Darkness. It's not really interactive, and it's still a lot of reading, but at least it breaks it down chronologically and focuses into blurbs rather than stories and walls of text.  Keep in mind that no list is going to be perfect. Much like Dark Souls, a lot of lore in the cWoD is speculated on by the fan base. One instance that always sticks out is the description of the Capuchin, a mysterious Giovanni from their clanbook, where the first letter of each line in his paragraph spells out ""LAZARUS"", one of the most powerful Cappadocian elders that escaped the Diablerie and massacre of his clan. The suggestion being that they're the same person, but as far as I know there was never confirmation.  There was also a ton of retconning done throughout the run, rending some older resources obsolete and changing events. The site tries to give citation or references when it can, but it's not always possible."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyk73,Gratiano,4,Mon Jul 20 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, so much of cWoD's history has changed due to the mutable nature of reality, where the technocratic revisionism has literally retconned out a lot of events and creatures."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyk73,Lynkis,4,Mon Jul 20 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"Reeeeealy now? (Not meant to be read sarcastically.) I was under the impression that the past was one of the few things that was concrete in Mage as far as the consensus goes -- you could change it by traveling back in time, but it wouldn't be subject to cosmic majority rule."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyk73,YouAllMeetInATavern,5,Tue Jul 21 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"It....depends.  The New World Order has a faction called the Ivory Tower that focuses on manipulating academia. They deal heavily in Revisionism, altering the perception of historic events to suit their current paradigm.  For example, let's say for the sake of argument that there were Ancient Aliens that helped the Egyptian Pharaohs construct the pyramids. This might have been common knowledge for thousands of years, until the early 1700's when the Order of Reason began to white-wash supernatural occurrences from the public consciousness. They systematically spread the statement ""Egyptian construction was all done by human ingenuity"" while also going through known records and removing any references to Aliens, with a good amount of Mind and Time magic thrown in for good measure. Done over a suitable amount of time, everyone forgets about the Aliens, and the world takes one step closer to anthrocentric stasis.  The question, then, is whether the Aliens ever helped at all then? It's literally the old ""If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to witness it, does it make a sound?""  Almost nobody that's part of Consensus Reality was alive during the Pyramid construction. Vampires don't impact the Consensus. There are very few examples of Mages who have survived long enough to remember the time period, with Voormas the only example I can think of off the top of my head. So theoretically, if 99% of the population believes Humanity did all the hard work building the Pyramids, then Consensus Reality dictates that's what happened. The Technocracy functionally performed time travel, without the risk of massive Paradox Backlash by manipulating the perception of humanity inch by inch over a long period of time - their specialty.  However, I'm inclined to agree that it doesn't work that way. I think the Revisionists are largely around to manipulate perceptions, not of the past, but of the future. They're just another arm of the Technocracy's propaganda division, telling people that the world ""has always worked this way, and thus it always will work this way"".  In my view, it's more about enforcing paradigms, whether political or economic or whatever, rather than removing specific events. As far as I know, they've never just removed a single event from history like that, but I could be wrong."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyk73,Gratiano,4,Tue Jul 21 01:19:24 2015 UTC,"I would agree with your view for a few reasons; none less important than the fact that history gets really crazy if consensus applies to it as well.  Have the books ever explicitly weighed in on this? I don't recall seeing anything the last time I took a spin through, but could have missed it."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyk73,YouAllMeetInATavern,2,Tue Jul 21 04:22:38 2015 UTC,"I mean the sheer fact that magic is forgotten at all is a pretty strong example of this. There was the ascension war, wasn't there? How much did that impact ordinary life?"

I had read a number of books before then, but this was the first time I ever really felt immersed in the lore on a larger scale. You start off as a illicitly sired vampire and your elder is killed and you're thrown into the setting and left to figure things out on your own. Every character has their own motivations and backstories that are mostly true to the spirit of the setting. It's on Steam (but it rarely goes on sale and you WILL have to use the fan patch) and it's some really immersive storytelling and one of the most rewarding video games I've played."

There is no way to avoid getting hulk-smashed by the Statue of Liberty (or an equivalent).   I don't think it matters if you're a mage or any other kind of supernatural creature, you're probably not going to survive that kind of firepower unless you have something like Juggernaut's Gait like new Vampires.

It's like the dawn of the rifle. For a little while it was all trench warfare and tactics where people frequently died on both sides, then it was all about who shot first from a safe place. If that metaphor makes any sense at all. And the more I think about it, the more it occurs to me that Storyteller isn't the best system for keeping such powerful combat interesting.  Probably why Exalted was a bit of a letdown."

I hope to see more!  edit: That said, is this actually attempting to insinuate the rules are ""broken""? A lot of this doesn't sound like it would come into play in a ""real game"". Every RPG I've seen has powers that are ""game breaking"" if you take them out of context of the actual narrative being told and the themes of the genre :)  Example: Wish from PF/3.5"
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyyr0,PraiseCaine,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's pretty broken, yeah. Almost every game I've played for NWoD has been in a city. The ability to lift skyscrapers and buildings (or whatever else) to thwack your enemies with is pretty bullshit, both from a game design standpoint and a story standpoint. It doesn't help that Satiety is a rather easily refilled resource and that by spending it you get massive bonuses to do crazy things which become even crazier when you're low on Satiety."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyyr0,shomaxt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"You do realize that you would have to specifically buy items like this and use them in a specific combination to get this kind of effect, right?   So, if you're playing a game where those purchases make sense why does it matter?   Now, if you're not playing a game where those purchases make sense, why does it matter?  That's why I pointed out the PF/3.5 example I did. Wish is an amazing thing mechanically in that it is literally ""anything"". However, it's still limited by the DM because they're the ones overseeing the game being played and the narrative being told.   So when I see someone say ""if I do these things with these mechanics in a test environment it would allow X"" that doesn't actually really matter to me. Talk to your ST! If that's the kind of thing they're all about, do it! Have a super powered smackdown fest and drop a statue on that dudes head. If it's not the tone of the game being run, be a responsible player :D!"
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyyr0,PraiseCaine,3,Tue Jul 21 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though. A lot of the powers used by Beasts are like this in some degree in that they can do downright crazy things, even by themselves. Unbreakable gives free 3/2 (4/3 at low satiety) armor at all times, spending satiety on it makes unarmed attacks deal no damage to you, and anything that doesn't do Aggravated does Bashing, in addition to making it so you can only become neutralized when full up on aggravated. Relentless Hunter allows you to heal super quickly, and makes you go first in combat when at low satiety. By spending 1 point of satiety with this power you either regen all of your bashing and lethal damage or heal aggravated damage up to your lair dots. Then there is the trio of on demand aggravated powers that kill pretty much anything. Or the grappling ability that turns you into the Kraken.  It isn't that ""these things only appear in a test environment,"" it's that all of their powers are very much applicable to standard settings and are extremely powerful by themselves. I used the city setting as an example because its the most likely place for a game to get played, and Beasts can pull off crazy things in that setting (like lifting skyscrapers) with little effort. Sure, the ST can limit things and what you're allowed to do, but at that point you're not playing Beast as it was designed anymore. Saying that it is all up to them is a patch on a larger problem."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyyr0,shomaxt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you, to each their own and whatnot. The ""City"" environment is 100% the most common scenario for a Chronicle to take place in, however the point i'm making is if you're actively trying to lift skyscrapers then you're either going to be falling into two categories.  1.) You're in theme and damn it feels good to be a gangster.   or  2.) You're actively purchasing items with the intent to take actions counter to the theme/narrative being told and you're not being a responsible player.   If it's item 1? Damn right, rock it. If it's 2...why are you being ""That Guy""?   As for the others you mentioned, armor is great! However agg is plentiful so the downgrading ""all but agg"" is less important.  Initiative boosting powers have existed in almost all of the prior game lines, and the world didn't explode either."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyyr0,PraiseCaine,3,Tue Jul 21 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"Whether ""I'm trying to be that guy"" or not, its that the system allows for such things in the first place, especially in a game with a ""cross-splat"" focus. If Beasts were the first WoD game ever made, I'd be cool with all of this. If it happened in its own little slice of the setting (like Demon) I'd be cool with this. The thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to be played where some players are another splat and other players are Beast, leading to a large power imbalance. In every group I've ever been in where that was readily apparent, things with south because it caused some folks to have all the fun and others to have none of it. And the thing you actively lift doesn't have to be a skyscraper, it can be things more apparent to the situation. Like a vampire's safehouse, something probably much smaller and far more in the range of character creation. Lift it, throw it, hasta la vista vamperinos.    As for ""the other powers,"" I realize that those powers I listed are pretty cool.... by themselves. In Beast, getting one Atavism involves getting a lot of power under one umbrella, and atavisms are cheap.  All in all, I think Beasts just get too much stuff that crosses the line for a game that is supposed to be about cross-splat play. Even in their own game, it seems to me that they'd be able to subvert most obstacles because of their power level."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyyr0,shomaxt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, you just really sealed the deal. ""Trying to be that guy"" is explicitly the core of this entire discussion.  ""The system allows this"" is not inherently the point, as I referenced with my Wish example.   ""Should I do this?"" is the actual core issue here. Sure, you can mechanically build something that can lift houses. That's pretty sweet. Mage can build things that can rewind time and Back to the Future you depending on how things get rolled out."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dyyr0,PraiseCaine,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I've always been of the opinion that if an option allows a player to be ""that guy"" then that option shouldn't exist in the first place. Besides that, this is more of a game balance issue than anything. Giving players or NPCs the ability to do crazy shit typically doesn't end well. Especially in a game that focuses on Cross-Splat play. I dislike the idea of a mid-tier Beast destroying a vampire elder, or warping the game around them to the point that they must somehow be dealt with or the rest of the party suffers because of their inability to keep up at the same pace. Its one of the reasons why, when I brought it up to my ST he made the decision to not include them in any of our games. Both of us disliked the idea of having to dis-canonize them from our setting, but otherwise they would start causing some power issues, especially if someone in our group wanted to play one. I've read on other forums that other STs have decided to do the same because of the problem.  If you and your game think you can handle it, please, be my guest, have fun. Enjoy it. My ST and I believe differently."

Hell, my first statted Beast was an Eshmaki who was a giant spider, and I casually picked up Looming Presence, with the intent to buy Cyclopean Strength pretty soon anyway. My problem is that just two basic and complimentary abilities like this become absurd at the mid-story level."

WhiteWolfRPG,3dvkr7,Murder_Boners,3,Sun Jul 19 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"You mean in 1e?  They were my favorite Order in Awakening, though it's hard to remember if that's from the corebook or the extra details in the Silver Ladder supplement. It might also be because the Enlightenment is my favorite era in history, due in no small part to the idea of Enlightened Monarchs.  The Silver Ladder are Enlightened Monarchs.  Magic isn't a democracy, this isn't Mage the Ascension. Magic is the right of special individuals who have seen the Truth, and thus can manipulate the Lie. If you haven't seen the Truth, by what right do you command those that have? How can a blind man argue colors with someone who can see? It just doesn't make sense.  So, it's only right that the blind masses are guided by the Enlightened Mages. This doesn't mean you cast off the poor souls, whose only sin was being born blind. You guide them and protect them, and hopefully one day they will be able to see the Truth as well.  That's the Silver Ladder's mission statement: To push the masses towards enlightenment.  They do this subtly, by building on confidence and belief. By encouraging the masses to think and act for a greater goal, rather than passively letting the Lie rule the world. The Silver Ladder doesn't want a nation of bored, lazy, empty slaves. They want a nation of exceptional, empowered individuals who have the potential to see the Truth. They don't want to keep anybody down, they want the masses to rise up. Their core philosophy isn't one of elitism, where only a handful of Mages rule over everyone else, they dream of a true Mageocracy where every single citizen is enlightened and involved.  It's not their fault that the reality of the situation hasn't quite caught up to their dream. Right now, it totally looks like the Silver Ladder are an old boys club, determined to keep power and lord over everyone else, but it's only because there are still sleepers who empower the lie and couldn't possibly understand the responsibility of Magic. Once everyone is Awakened the Silver Ladder's methods will look more sympathetic."

WhiteWolfRPG,3dtcg0,bladethebetrayer,5,Sun Jul 19 06:51:51 2015 UTC,"The most useful things you can do right now are all perception related. All of your Life/Entropy 1 will let you find weaknesses in life forms, Prime/Entropy 1 will let you identify weaknesses in enchanted objects and magic that other mages cast (eventually with higher levels of both you will be able to cast general countermagic), and Spirit/Prime 1 will let you do the same with anything spirits do. The problem right now is that your spheres are just too spread out to do much more than perceptual stuff with anything but life, so I'd look into figuring out how to get the maximum amount of use out of that Life 3 that you can.  Modifying plants to produce large seeds with concentrated pockets of hydrogen effectively nets you fireballs if you want to go that route. Fruit can be modified to contain alcohol or activated THC, so with a little social push you can get people to talk about whatever you need them to. If you're willing to go totally off rails and create life that's never existed before, combining things like the blood vessels on a Regal Horned Lizard with the Tetradoxin of the Puffer Fish and a circular bone structure will get you a ring that can shoot poison with a fair degree of accuracy. My advice to you in general for mage is not to start with what Spheres can do, but rather what needs to be done in order for you to accomplish your goal and then work backwards to see what Spheres you need."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dtcg0,EatZelda_ShitAwesome,2,Sun Jul 19 07:43:39 2015 UTC,"Would that living ring be a paradox-magnet, though?"
WhiteWolfRPG,3dtcg0,Tipop,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe, it'd depend on the exact shape and presentation that went along with it. You could say that it's a toy that you got from someone and that you like wearing it, that alone would probably make everything about it except its initial creation coincidental."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dtcg0,EatZelda_ShitAwesome,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"I love making up rotes. life3   Advanced understanding allows the mage to radically alter simple organisms (turning a tree inside-out); transform one into another (changing fruit into insects); or – with Prime 2 – conjure them from raw energy.  Working with his own Pattern, that mage can work substantial alterations on himself, growing gills, claws, armor and so forth. He remains essentially human, but begins to master the definition of “human.” Meanwhile, he also gains the ability to heal damage to other complex organisms, put them to sleep, or inflict harm upon their living Pattern forms.    So a neat rote for someone focused on entropy, prime, and spirit would be one where patterns are very important.  entropy1, prime1 life3 ""Black bruise"" the mage cast this rote allowing him to see the living pattern of another, and more importantly where it is already weak. the next blow from the mage will do massive life damage as it targets what is already fragile. If the spell is vulgar, the damage is aggravated, if coincidental, it's merely lethal.  prime1, life3, ""Animorph!"", The mage examine the pattern of a living thing, and determines how to modify that pattern... giving a cat wings or a frogs prehensile tongue, or a scorpion tail, (or the mage, for that matter) It takes time to pull out the threads of this new pattern and reshape the entity and this is almost guaranteed to be vulgar. More subtle effects would to give yourself hawk eyes, or owl eyes, or gills... but would still be an obvious modification if others saw you."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dqht0,mpaulhuffman,12,Sat Jul 18 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"specifically in the Dark Ages?   The book you want is Dark Ages: Mage. The tl;dr is that, in the dark ages, Paradox didn't exist. If magic failed, it failed. It just happened to fail more often with non-mage witnesses.  By the Renaissance it had become the Scourge, which sometimes helped and sometimes hindered. It wasn't a universally negative force.  In 1645, the use of overt magic at the Battle of Naseby tipped the scales, causing Scourge to become the Paradox familiar to modern mages.  Even if Paradox existed in the Dark Ages, it wouldn't have been as much of a force as it is in the modern day, because most sleeper witnesses believed in magic. Paradox comes to the fore when beliefs clash: ""magic's not real"" + obvious magic = paradox, hence the name."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dqht0,VonAether,5,Sat Jul 18 16:24:15 2015 UTC,"You're essentially going for ""If someone saw this, they wouldn't go ""OH SHIT, MAGIC,"" even if the effect itself would be impossible.""  My players have, for instance, used Correspondence to teleport by having themselves appear in an alleyway after a car drove by to obscure people's view of the alley. Maybe he was there the whole time, who knows?  Another player, a Son of Ether, used Matter to make a tile floor a frictionless surface that looked like it had just been mopped. Hey, you slipped on a wet floor - no magic there.  These are both modern-day examples, but the principles are roughly the same across the board - consider who's able to see you (including cameras and the like) and what viewers would consider plausible. In the dark ages, for instance, a priest/monk would have a very different standard of believability than your average woodworker or serf, and in a different way than some pagan cultist.  And 'crazy powerful' is a tad inaccurate - mages are pretty starkly limited in what they can cast based on their spheres, arete, and the amount of time available to them. Small, subtle effects should be the norm."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dqht0,ThePletch,4,Sat Jul 18 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"Remember that casting magic in plausible ways, like the slippery floor example, can make a spell coincidental, but simply hiding something vulgar, like the teleport example, only removes witnesses from the equation.

Sometimes, it's as if they enter a fugue state and wind up at an Elysium. Other times, they simply cannot take another step towards a neighborhood without suffering excruciating pain.  -A Setite (or other) sets up an auction rumored to include items and information that could potentially destabilize the city, but too many owe him/her favors for anything to be done about it overtly.  -A Native American Kindred rises from torpor and begins hunting white Kindred, carrying on a vendetta that dates back to colonization. Something seems to be aiding him/her, something the locals can't identify or explain.  -Kindred have been suffering the Final Death during the day, being reduced to ash as if they were exposed to the sun. This occurs no matter how well protected they were.  -Rumours abound that one of the local Kindred might not be Kindred, but a name is never named.  -A pack of lupines have suddenly taken a keen interest in a local elysium, threatening a decades-long tenuous peace. Then again, there was that dead ghoul found there a few weeks back...  -A small coterie of thin-bloods has suddenly grown very powerful, and threatens to upset the local order. How did they gain so much power so quickly?  -A Malkavian seer has come to the city, searching for ""the childe that will forestall the calamity"". A Sabbat pack has arrived to kill the childe, and is somehow able to track the Malkavian without trouble. Only one problem - the childe has yet to be Embraced, and any Kindred could be the sire.   -A traveling revival preacher has stopped in town for a few days. His events draw hundreds and the upswell of faith in the city is having negative repercussions for the local Kindred. Unfortunately, this preacher is also a hunter and is recruiting locals his cause.  -One of the PC's wakes up with a very large chunk of his/her memory missing, and the sheriff pounding on the door. The coterie needs to find out what happened, or they may all end up staked for the sun.  -A small mortal child, maybe 4-5 years old, manages to walk in to an elysium and begins talking about the mortal lives of every Kindred present as if she were a direct witness.  -The Kindred of the city have begun reacting to moonlight as if it were sunlight. Only those who have been Kindred for 50 years or less seem unaffected.   -A non-Kindred immortal approaches the PC's with an offer of employment. It seems he has a grudge against a local elder.  -A fledgling of extremely potent blood is found by the PC's. What do they do with him/her, and what is the sire up to? And why can't anyone figure out which clan they belong to?  -A Nosferatu finds...something...buried beneath the city, and unintentionally brings it up to the surface. It begins attacking Kindred, leaving them drained and in torpor. Only that Nosferatu has encountered it and been left alone, but now she's in hiding and not even the other Nos can find her.  -A few local Kindred have had considerable good fortune lately, elevating them to some prominence. A trio of Assamites arrive in town not long after, and present themselves to the Prince. The Prince declares them to be under his protection, and orders that none interfere with their mission (which is never stated).

WhiteWolfRPG,3dl4ss,blasezucchini,4,Sat Jul 18 11:37:09 2015 UTC,"Some basic plots that I've run early in Masquerade games:   A serial killer is on the loose, threatening the Masquerade by potentially bringing down the FBI. Turns out the killer is a new experimental 'super ghoul' made by members of the Sabbat. A Setite, seemingly entirely benevolent, sets up shop and opens a rare book shop in town.  A ravenous, newly-Embraced Kindred is found near to Elysium, but there is no idea who Embraced him/her. An Archon is coming to the city and the court is abuzz with WHY. A woman inadvertently summons a demon trying to revive her child, who was killed in a Sabbat raid. The demon is bound to dead bodies, and is body-jumping in order to get an artifact that can free it."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dl4ss,elmerg,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:10 2015 UTC,"Heh, a seemingly benevolent Setite? When did the knowledge that man was not meant to know come into play? And was he just testing to see what knowing this would do to someone?"
WhiteWolfRPG,3dl4ss,DeathMonkee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"The Setite plot is still ongoing, but the Setite was involved in the exile of a powerful Ravnos hundreds of years ago, who end up in the area where the city is set, and is now in torpor/sealed away, leaving him under the city. The Setite using his benevolence and trading for occult information to ingratiate himself to the city, and surreptitiously gathering information on odd happenings in the city, to lead him to the torpid exile. He believes that his magic can bring the exile under his heel completely, primarily as a powerful slave/servant. Ultimately the 'Setite does something benevolent' plotline could be used in a number of ways: he's trying to wheedle local secrets to sell to the Anarchs or Sabbat; he's trying to find objects locally to add to his power base; any number of things.  As far as the serial killer plot and not knowing what the details of the killer is, it's not hard to hear about the FBI coming in and investigating, which would easily cause potential issues of feeding and utilizing influence (and if they have appropriate lores, might know that Hunters might come along with the FBI if something hinky is going on). If players are investigative types they might look into it in order to prevent that (or be assigned to do so, especially if normal influence comes back negative), and stumble their way into finding oiut the Sabbat plot for the super-ghoul experiment. When I ran it, there was a Jack the Ripper-esque method to it, and the killings actually implicated a local Kindred, and the PCs were sent to investigate it and stumbled upon the further plot."

WhiteWolfRPG,3djr2r,trudge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'll admit my LARP game back in college had a fair degree of action in it (which mostly involved a crowd of players throwing PRS at a handful of STs), so I may miss the distinction in anticipated style here.  Since you're working with a smaller group, and you're in a tabletop setting rather than a LARP, you can typically focus on individual players a bit more.  One thing my old STs used to do was have a rotating backstory-themed arc for each chapter.    So player 1 may be the ""focal"" character in the first three games, having conspired to bring the other three people into his cotorie for some purpose or conspiracy (maybe you're trying to smuggle an out-of-favor Sire out of the city beneath the view of the new Sire / visiting Archon).  And by the end of the first three games, we resolve that initial attempt while delving into player 1s grander story.  Then player 2 needs something - maybe his character wants to embrace a still-mortal girlfriend - and so the players intrigue to win the right to a new childer from the court.  And then story arc three may be a Sabbat incursion or terrorist plot, which ties in to player 3's story (because he's got friends/enemies in the Sabbat, and maybe they've decided to bother him in particular).  You don't need to confine yourself to Elyssium.  If a player says ""We're going to book the Red Eye to Chicago, because we need to do something there"", you may run a game that's just a night trip to Chicago and all the logistics and politics that involves.  You may be crawling through the sewers, looking for a back door into a rival's sanctuary.  Through it all, have some kind of main metaplot story that touches everybody.  Maybe this arrived Archon is here in search of a particularly significant relic (an authentic Book of Nod that needs burning), a particular mortal that needs to be turned for some higher-up's prophecy, maybe the Sire you smuggled (or failed to) out of town in chapter 1 is part of a larger political movement among the clans.  And over the course of the individual player story-arcs, you move closer to uncovering/resolving this greater agenda.  Resolving that is your big Chronicle Ending, and should get you a good 10-15 games down the line."

Work out your character's motives, and how they feel about their newfound freedom. How they feel about their lost life (and relationship to the fetch).  I find that usually informs how you'd pick your kiths, seemings and put dots on the sheet.  I find fitting characters to dots a lot harder than fitting dots to characters, so yeah.  So a wordy comedian who got captured because he offended a fae performing a show but managed to escape by making a humourous pledge with a loophole and wants to get his life back...you could probably stat that up really easily.  Or a flighty teenager who wandered into the secret garden by accident and literally burrowed their way out of arcadia under their keeper, but they've lost their youth and don't want their old life back!  Things like that, find a concept you like and then build around it - it'll fall into place really easily."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dfgq8,XenesisXenon,2,Thu Jul 16 01:09:16 2015 UTC,"This is very good advice. I've been known to have difficulties making Changelings, because I start at by picking Seeming, kith and court."

The technocracy and the traditions, I feel like if I was a mage my views would be somewhere between them.  I really like how the syndicate is at least supposed to be looking out for the good and welfare of the common man, what I don't like is the technocracy just attacking anyone supernatural, even if they are seriously the ""good guys"".  I also much prefer the spirit paradigm over the dimensional science paradigm."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dci1a,Isva,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:39:29 2015 UTC,"All the factions of the technocracy consider themselves to be the good guys. How aggressively they after the supernatural is up to the GM, really- if you're running with a full blown ascension war then that's fair enough, but at the same time there is plenty of potential for there to be less aggression. What they consider to be the problem is supernaturals causing harm to the masses, and vulgar stuff that damages the consensus. It's not like they'd necessarily go after some tarot reading mystic, but they care significantly more about someone publicly throwing fireballs around.  There's no reason you can't take a wholesale chunk of the technocratic paradigm and attach it to a non-Union character. You'll have a few holes to work around, but nothing impossible- how you get funding, why you aren't in the technocracy, how you deal with the Traditions, etc."

I mean seriously, you're going to hunt down and kill a Child of Gaia theurge and her kinfolk kids? Number 1, fuck you.  Number 2, Go ahead and have a real fun time trying to kill the wyrm, stop the weaver, and rescue the entirety of existence from dying.   It bothers me that the technocrats claim they're out protect the common man but the way they go about it reminds me of the nazis, but instead of killing jews it changelings, changing breeds, anyone else ""abnormal"", and anyone with the recessive genes to produce said abnormals."

WhiteWolfRPG,3dci1a,Isva,2,Wed Jul 15 10:18:20 2015 UTC,"I think the piece of information you are missing is the fact that you know more than the characters: in your example, it is quite possible that the technocrats never even heard of the wyrm, and that even if they did they would probably chalk it off as something that exists /because/ the garous exists.   In the WoD information about supernaturals is hazy at best: a garou will probably kniw that vampire exist and are dangerous, he may have heard about the fey beign weird and some rumors about humans that do things they should not be able to. But nothing specific.   The technocrats are the same: getting only part of infos about other supernatural creatures and jumping to conclusions by seeing mainly the dangerous minority pretty much like many examples of real world racism. The only difference is that the technocrats have really big guns, are SURE of beign right and have pretty much nobody to stop them of taking action / nobody strong enough to make them hear reason."
WhiteWolfRPG,3dci1a,AnatoleSerial,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:18 2015 UTC,"Like I said, that depends on how the technocracy is run in your setting. They don't have to be the crazy people who do all of that. That's just one way of running them. If they are all crazy murder machines who'll gun down anyone with any mystical inclination, then that's up to your ST, but that isn't necessarily the only (or even the most common) outlook.  Also, just saying, but if you're running in Mage cosmology, then the Wyrm/Weaver stuff isn't really relevant."

WhiteWolfRPG,3d7f9y,wolfman1911,6,Tue Jul 14 07:39:56 2015 UTC,"In the werewolf handbook it says that werewolves age at half the rate of humans once the make their first change. So a werewolf that changes at 20 can easily live another 120 years.   (Average life expectancy (x) - current age (y)) * 2(werewolf aging) + y = life expectancy (x-y)2+y=__ (80 - 20)2+20= 140  Where as some one who made there first change at 50 would only expect to live 110 years  (80-50)*2+50=110  Keep in mind that were wolf's don't age like humans. A werewolf who is the equvilent of a 50 year old man can still be in top physical shape. Werewolf age very rapidly at the end of their life's but stay fit up to that point.  Also it seems like there is special benefits to more powerful werewolves as well in terms of aging according to the previous posts. I think I remember reading some where that 10 dot pl werewolve are immortal but not sure.  In addition, torpor doesn't reduce the age of vampires. If anything it enhances it. Torpor allows vampires to thin their blood and thus be able to feed less often, and on humans again as well as gaining more control over the beast at the expense of some power.  Sure they sleep for a long time but their sleeping can be very intense at times with some serious hallucinations and even something akin to Astral travel. Think decades long spirit journey."

WhiteWolfRPG,3d7f9y,EvanEdwards,6,Tue Jul 14 07:40:34 2015 UTC,Effective lifespan.   With most of their memories red-washed from a long torpor it's basically like starting over new.
WhiteWolfRPG,3d7f9y,Renxasis,12,Tue Jul 14 07:57:18 2015 UTC,"Their memories are not washed out in 1e, they are just uncertain and instable unless the story calls for them to remember.  It's a trick to allow players who don't have intimate personal knowledge of French culture in 1137 in a town near Nice to have had their character there.  Plus the ST (and player) can inject twists into their background (""As you look into your glass of wine, it strikes you that you've heard her voice before, speaking French.  You look up and realize that <new PC by new player> is your forgotten childe, and a rush of memories and emotions flood your mind.""  The PCs remember what is important for the game, including new things as needed.  More importantly, fog of ages is not in 2e."
WhiteWolfRPG,3d7f9y,EvanEdwards,4,Tue Jul 14 10:48:14 2015 UTC,Hasn't the torpor-amnesia mechanic (fog of eternity?) been removed in WtR 2nd Ed?
WhiteWolfRPG,3d7f9y,RichoDemus,5,Tue Jul 14 08:59:36 2015 UTC,"What I meant was - vampire's are up and active for a few hundred years before torpor, then they sleep a while, and when they wake up, a lot of their stats have been reset.  While the character is immortal, it seems like torpor and awakening are something of a death and resurrection cycle.  I like the mechanic, because it prevents elders from accumulating outrageous numbers of dots, and it allows players to create ancient characters with starting character budgets."
WhiteWolfRPG,3d7f9y,Seulja,6,Tue Jul 14 11:58:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's the scary part of elders. Their stats don't completely reset. If their Blood Potency drops low enough that their max trait dots is lower than their actual dots, they only lose the dots that put them over maximum. So, if a BP 8 has 6 dots in Strength and drops to BP 2, Strength only drops to 5 dots. An elder who has gone through torpor three or four times could conceivably wake up with 5 dots in damn near everything. (VtR 1e pg.99-100; specifically the example on pg. 100)"
WhiteWolfRPG,3d7f9y,EvanEdwards,5,Tue Jul 14 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"Not only do elders not reset in the way you describe (Seulja explains in a sibling response), there's the elder book coming out soon (late this year? early next?), so we'll have all kinds of information in A Thousand Years of Night.  The Rollicking R is on it.  It's confirmed to be about vampires older than mortal empires who are vibrant and active, leading some to speculate that they don't suffer torpor in the same way.  It's also implied that they have a different relation to their Touchstones (they'd have to!)"

At Sothic Turns, you get Mummies that live, eh... a few years at most? Although, if they're ridiculously careful, a Mummy on a Turn is effectively immortal. And then, with Apotheosis, they are ageless. They can still die, and stay dead, but they don't die of old age or disease.  Prometheans can keep alive and kicking for a theoretically infinite period of time, provided they go back to the wastes now and again.  Werewolves, near as I can tell, live longer than humans, but not by much. They still age, although their wolfish side offers them a bit more vigor in their later years.  As for Beasts? I think there's a hard limit of a few centuries based on Lair, but then they can achieve Inheritance, one of which (Incarnate) provides immortality and godlike power."

When I write I prefer to have crossover chronicles just to enrich the world the players are entering into. To be honest I think it's a great strength of WoD because each group has it's own niche it specialises in, werewolves with spirits, Sin-eaters with Ghosts, Vampires with the material world, Changelings with Dreams, the hedge, and the other supernaturals, Mages with just about everything. And I think the ability to have crossover games enriches the world massively and makes the players work more to achieve political balance or supremacy."

There were no Changeling PCs, but my group saved a Changeling from a Hedge Mage and later explored a Changeling Market (similar to the ones in Neverwhere and Hellboy 2).  Only the two Werewolves and the 2 Djinn made it to the Lovecraft-inspired Apocalypse, but every splat's input was important to the game."

You get to blur the lines between ghosts and spirits, Geists and totems, fetishes and mementos, etc. The similarities between Sin-Eaters and Spirit-Ridden make a cool point of contention. And because of the way Sin-Eater krewes are fascinated by different cultural beliefs/religions, I could see them getting in with a Werewolf pack and appropriating a bunch of their rituals/customs.  I also like Changelings as crossover characters with pretty much anybody. I like to play them as paranoid opportunists with a giant espionage network (similar to how Demons turned out), so it would make sense to have them putting their noses in everybody's business. Big vampire population? The Winter Queen's worked out a non-aggression pact with the Vamp Prince, promising to help protect the Masquerade in exchange for safe passage for the Freehold's citizens at night. Werewolf pack in town? Summer Court has promised to lend them some soldiers in a fight against the Pure in exchange for their assistance in taking down a True Fae exile that hangs out in the woods.

Often I play the game of ""I want this splat, but how would I do it in the current game I'm playing"".  I don't have a particular problem with crossover, not really but if it happens I like it to have a certain gravitas, that ""you're a long way from home"" feeling.  I've ran Changeling, Mortals and Demon games and played Vampire and Mage as well. Changeling works pretty great for crossover and that paranoia gives them a lot of drama fuel for when they encounter something so completely alien it doesn't even resemble the Fae.  Demon I think is going to crossover with a lot of things as well for the same reason, but I haven't actually inflicted it on my players yet. :P"

After some interrogation, it comes to light that this young man seems to have become a ghoul from a drug he bought from a pharmaceutical company, not from any vampire.  Back at his apartment he had one of the little pink pills left, if one of the party consumes it, it re-acts badly with the vitae within them; it causes the loss of one vitae, which they vomit forth.

WhiteWolfRPG,3d5kow,kusagakamui,2,Tue Jul 14 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Vienna: 1946  A world in ruins. A nation at the cross-roads. A masquerade in tatters.  The secret excesses of Der Ewige Reich nearly destroyed the Masquerade/Veil permanently (think Hellboy/The Keep/Wolfenstein/etc.). Now Vienna is divided four ways - a French, American, British, and Soviet sector.  Amidst the rubble, the Tremere scurry to re-organize, and to dig their comrades out from under the rubble of fallen chantries. All the bombing raids destroyed the wards that once kept Vienna a Tremere only city.   Nearby, Linz was planned by Hitler to become the greatest Art Museum that the world had ever seen. The many looted treasures were gathered there, sealed in salt mines. Many of those mines have yet to be catalogued.  The Allied governments know. The American Majestic Council of Twelve, organized by Harry Truman, knows. The British Ministry of Shadows, colloqially hidden under the name Laundry Services, knows. L'Armee Sauvage, a demi-tribe of French resistance Garou/kinfolk, knows. The NKVD Spetsialny Direktsiya, under the supervision of Lavrenti Beria, knows.  They know that there are secret nazi occult weapons labs waiting to be plundered. They know that there are 600 years of gathered thaumaturgy and alchemy, unguarded. They know that the shadow people of Austria - the vampires, werewolves, mages- are desperate for order, stability, peace, willing to trade treasures to ensure medicine and food for their family.  They know that Vienna is the cross-roads of Europe. A city of great beauty and arcana, of opera, home of the coffeehouse, home of Mozart and Freud and Klimt. They know that Vienna is a spy's paradise.  They know that a new powder keg is shaping. Even know, the shadows of the iron curtain are forming.  From across Europe, Camarilla carpetbaggers swarm. In exchange for Camarilla aid, the Tremere have agreed to allow Vienna to be an open city. Toreador artists, Ventrue businessmen, Malkavian psychiatrists, all find opportunity in Vienna.  Likewise, it is a time of weary reconciliation in the Garou nation. The shamed Get of Fenris must accept the aid of American Glass Walkers and British Fianna in banishing the thousands of banes begotten by the Holocaust.  Vienna is the site of a show-down between two factions of the Technocracy about what society should be. An industrial utopia of the masses? A capitalist free market society? World War 2 was the first great civil war of the Technocracy, between the Utopians, the now-discredited Eugenicals, and the Western Timeline. Shall the Sons of Ether be re-admitted?  And in the darkest kellars of Vienna lurk nightmares. Cybernetic nazi abominations. Demons bound into the flesh of unfortunate Jews and Romany. Turkish Djinni, long confined since the siege of 1688. And worst of all, the dead end fanatics of Aktion Werwolf- a mixture of sadistic fascist vampires, dead ender Get of Fenris, and mad barabbi Sons of Ether- plot nothing short of the end of the world, or, at least, a way of starting a third world war.

The method you described is exactly how a Wretched is created, albeit with recycled Promethean parts. One of the books talks about how some mortals may be able to recreate the original Demiurge's work, but ultimately it is still the same Lineage despite not being made by a Promethean of that Lineage. If the ST really wants it to be a new Lineage, then the Promethean would be the Lineage's Progenitor.

It means you don't need a stat block and it's very easy to figure out their competence in most areas. 1-5 dice in off-focus area, 2-10 dice in on-focus areas. Beyond that, I give them a motive and off you go!  And if I need the derived stats, I can just use the dots to calculate it. For most of them it works out to dots = thing. Edit: Cross posting from myself elsewhere: Basically, I've been assigning the dot ratings of people on the fly of 1-5, then deciding a handful of areas of expertise to get the skilled multiplier.  Quickly deriving stats:  NPC:   Pool: Dots Specialty Pool: 2x Dots Health: Dots + 5 Willpower: Dots Defence: Dots Initiative Mod: Dots Speed: Dots + 5   If they're not important enough to have a sheet, it's still a good way to get some roughly average stats. If they need to be a combat flunkie you can always just hand them a style merit and some gear, too. Anyone in the 3-Dot range is going to be quite competent in what they do, especially if there's lots of people of that proficiency."

WhiteWolfRPG,3czkzv,LeRoienJaune,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"My advice: Steve Jackson's GURPS had a series of NPC books- Rogues, Warriors, Supporting cast- which has reasonably well fleshed out NPCs for any setting. Just convert a few that you think will be likely or probable.  The NWoD books, and Precinct 13, and Dogs of War also have some generic NPCs.    In a similar vein, I have also found that Trail of Cthulhu has a good NPC set in the supplement The Armitage Files. There's also some good stock NPCs in The Esoterrorists 2nd edition.  In general, other than a focus skill pool, the NPCs should have 2-4 for their dice pools.  A quick and easy formula for Mooks: 4/3/3 attributes, 9/6/3 abilities, 15 merit points  A quick and easy formula for more plausibly competent characters: 5/4/3, 13/9/5, 20 merit.  Significant and noteworthy figures (tough gang lords, major leaders, local celebrities): 7/5/3, 15/10/6m 30 merit points.  Or just go from the dice pool:  1-2 DP: Barely competent, untrained. Relying upon luck and a vague recollection of what is done in the movies.  3-4: Basic competence. A course or past experience. An infrequent visitor to the gun range. A subject studied in college but not used in every day life. Young thugs and rent-a-cops should have this for their combat dice pools.   Examples: Grad student (academics), car enthusiast (crafts), news paper reporter (investigation), life guard (medicine), political activist (politics), tech intern (computer), lab assistant (science), conspiracy theorist (occult); high school jock (athletics), commercial trucker (drive), MMA enthusiast (brawl), army private fresh out of basic (firearms), hiker/camper (survival); dog walker (animal ken), volunteer counselor (empathy)  5-6: Competent. Most police, hardened criminals, have this for their combat pools. Law school graduates (politics), new doctors in residency (medicine), the musician of a bar band (performance).   7-8: Professional. Extensively trained and uses the skill on a daily basis. Will have a local reputation for competence. This is the highest talent level that the PCs should be able to find on short notice. The well regarded geneticist (science). The drug dealer with great connections (streetwise). A specialist surgeon. SWAT, Army Rangers, Marine Recon Battalion. Realistically, this is the max combat dice pool that you can expect for criminals- and such will be the chief enforcers and the hitmen.  9-10: Top of the field. The NPC is good enough to be known world-wide. If it's a skill like politics, then they are an eagerly sought political consultant. Combat wise, it's Navy SEALS and similar special forces. Subterfuge is a legendary con-man like Jordan Belfort."
WhiteWolfRPG,3czkzv,popeguilty,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:33:34 2015 UTC,"Similar to the dicepools concept is the Stock NPCs rules from the new V:tM LARP rules. Stock NPCs have a rating from 1-5. They have [Rating] health levels, can't retest with willpower, have a test pool of [Rating x 2] and [Rating] Skill specialties which grant +5 to tests involving the relevant Skill. Skill specialties can also, with the appropriate supernatural type, be spent on specific Disciplines, which grant the appropriate Discipline at [Rating] dots.

WhiteWolfRPG,3cyikz,malonkey1,3,Sat Jul 11 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"You are correct. In second edition prices are constant, so the second dot of the merit costs the same as the first dot. To buy all five merit dots would cost 5 experiences total"

If you have 2 dots in martial arts, it costs the same as a 1-dot merit.  You can extrapolate the rule from these specific examples."

WhiteWolfRPG,3cyikz,Consecro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:51:32 2015 UTC,"I've been playing under the impression that the costs are as follows. Merits: 1st is 2, second is 4, third is 6. Total is 12 exp. Attribute: 1st is 5, second is 10, third is 15. Total is 30. Have i been playing wrong, or am i simply understanding wrong."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cyikz,XenesisXenon,3,Sun Jul 12 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"It depends on the edition.  In first edition, costs scaled with dots (so, the 4th dot costs twice as much as the 2nd dot).  In 2nd edition, the costs were switched to static, so each dot costs the same."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cyikz,EvanEdwards,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:22:24 2015 UTC,ELI5? Im under the influence. I might understand this tomorrow if your to busy to explain to an idiot right now.
WhiteWolfRPG,3cyikz,Consecro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"So, in first edition, the cost for an attribute is 5*level.  So, when buying Strength the second dot costs 10, the third dot costs 15, the fourth dot costs 20, and the fifth dot costs 25.  In second edition, they revamped the experience system.  Experience points were replaced by Beats and Experiences.  You earn some number of Beats in a session, and whenever you accumulate five Beats, they convert into an Experience.   Now an attribute costs 4 experiences (notice the ""*level"" is missing).  When buying Strength, the second dot costs 4 experiences, the third dot costs 4, the fourth dot costs 4, and the fifth dot costs 4.  It actually works out to be about the same number of sessions to build up the experiences.  Taking Strength from 1 to 5 in 1st edition cost 70 experience points.  Taking Strength from 1 to 5 in 2nd edition costs 16 experiences, which works out to 80 beats.  Since you earn beats in 2nd edition at about the same rate as experience points in 1st edition (I think), it takes about the same amount of play time."

WhiteWolfRPG,3cvtlh,capukee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"I've typically let players spend their experience in downtime between sessions, yeah. Otherwise it's a pain to update the exp and sheets mid-game. I find it gets in the way, personally.  You don't necessarily need to award freebie beats/experience but it doesn't matter if you do or not, as long as you're consistent (e.g. if you always award an extra beat for a downtime period, you should always do that)."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cvtlh,XenesisXenon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:28:38 2015 UTC,"For 1e, I never awarded exp for down time for its own sake. The players are typically going to use that time to pursue their own interests. If any of my players do some good RP'ing or do anything else that warrants exp, then I give it to them.   For example, if I tell the players that there will be about two weeks in-game that nothing is happening, that's their cue to find something for their characters to do. If they do some exp-worthy stuff, they get some. If they just say okay and twiddle their thumbs, we jump two weeks ahead and no exp.   I award bonus exp as a reward for story involvement, character development, good RP'ing, etc. - which means they have to earn it. I was never really satisfied with the 1e exp system. It never gave a good idea of just how much exp to award for anything. The 2e beats system appears to be an improvement, though I haven't run a game with it yet (my first 2e game starts tonight, so I hope it's better!)."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cuekz,Daendis,5,Fri Jul 10 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"You don't need to guess, but most opponents in WoD games are not mindless goblins or gnolls. You don't need or want generic 'bad guy' stats because ideally you will have unique antagonists for your games. That Sabbat overfiend or heavily mutated Black Spiral Dancer should be fleshed out beyond whatever generalized stats the main rulebook provides.  However, if you really need cannon fodder stats, just come up with some general health levels, Melee/Brawl/Firearms/Athletics stats and their physical and mental traits, since that is all you will ever really use."

WhiteWolfRPG,3cuekz,DeadpoolNakago,3,Fri Jul 10 22:25:35 2015 UTC,"The Hunter books I think have ways to design enemies form the supernatural groups.   Conversely, if you just want to make supernaturals withut having to own/look at books, just make stats for enemies that are 2-3 attribute points better than you PCs, and attribute these imbalances to ""super powers"" All the splats have some form of Strength, Dex, or Stamina bonuses. And, really, the ones PC mortals can beat are honestly going to be pretty terrible representations of their groups. Its just that a supernatural should, for the most part, beat a single mortal 9 out of 10 times. And not just from combat, but just from the extra abilities that can end a combat immediately."

WhiteWolfRPG,3cuekz,DeadpoolNakago,3,Fri Jul 10 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"Well depends if they know what they're dealing with. If they think the sickly old man with the cane is easy to take on, they'll be surprised he's actually a mage using life magic to degrade his physical features to look like an enfeebled old man.  But if they know the supernatural is real they better not be fighting one unless they have a plan. just fighting on the spot with no plan should end in disaster."

WhiteWolfRPG,3cuekz,TheGreyPope,3,Sat Jul 11 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"One thing I'm toying with is a easy/medium/hard stat line. If you can, get a hold of your PCs armor, defense, and attack values. Then average them and find a standard deviation.  Then, with that, you can have a range of Attack and Defense stats you need to challenge but not overwhelm your PCs. Want some mooks? Give them Attack and Defense values below the St. Dev. Want average guys? Give them values wthin the St. Dev or at the Average. Want a harder big bad? Go above the St. Dev.  If you're not good with maths, Microsoft excel can do that work for ya. You just need to keep info handy.  Alternatively, if you are using a splat it helps to ID what skills and powers actually have an impact on combat. Just an Example. A vampire with majesty has access to the level one power of ""Awe"" but it has no relevant applications in combat. So knowing the combatant has access to that power means nothing. But the level three ability of entrancement does have relevance.  Also, I'd say send equal or 1-2 enemies more at you PCs than there are of them. Especially if your PCs are supernaturals. There are several ways for X vs. 1 fights can just end immediately."

WhiteWolfRPG,3cr4v0,Gratiano,7,Fri Jul 10 03:10:06 2015 UTC,"It would be tough to compare. Second Sight isn't a full-blown corebook with a new creature, it's just a supplement for mortals with supernatural powers. Half the book is composed of mechanical powers and the other half gives suggestions about how humans could gain these powers. There's also a small chronicle at the very end.  Here's a sample of the powers if you want to take a look.  Otherwise, like I said, most of the psychic powers in Second Sight are consolidated into the GMC Rule Updated which is free, if you'd rather look at those."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cr4v0,blasezucchini,2,Fri Jul 10 03:34:41 2015 UTC,That sounds like exactly what I would want. The issue I had with Geist was taking four disparate characters and forcing them to create some weird creation myth and such.

WhiteWolfRPG,3cr4v0,XenesisXenon,7,Fri Jul 10 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"If your still running nWoD and not GMC, use Second Sight. It is not actually a bad system for psychic powers, though a few tweaks might need to be made to make it more fun.  If you are using the GMC system updates then look up Second Sight for ideas if nothing else, but use the GMC psychic merits as well as the psychic merits that have been getting posted on Onyx Path Open Developement(if you are okay with that kind of thing), they are alot more.......not simplistic but they flow smoother in play; less rules to wrangle I guess.  I recommend at least using this tweak, no matter which set of psychic merits you decide to go with.:   ""Inherent Style""  To clarify, a guy over on RPG.net made a little homebrew game called Xia, where some of the cool supernatural wuxia powers were marked with ""Inherent Style"". Basically, if you were using them to do something you could accomplish anyway, they were free. If they give you some mechanical advantage, the price is not waived in that instance. So, to use Telekinesis as an example: if you want to pull a nearby remote to your hand so you can change the channel, it's free even if you haven't activated Telekinesis for the Scene. If you want to move furniture or something, cough up the one Willpower. That's legitimately one of the best ways to beef them up with minimal effort - the stupid stuff is free, the important stuff costs some dough.  That simple little tweak doesn't sound like much, but it makes playing a psychic alot more fun, and it lets you play around with you power alot more too."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cr4v0,DeathMonkee,3,Fri Jul 10 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really awesome little tweak. Reminds me of a NWoD discussion I saw elsewhere where people were basically in agreement that Supernatural powers were cool when the small, basic, everyday uses didn't use up your fuel but when the chips were down and you needed a show of power in any way, bring on the magic fuel (Mostly in reference to Vampire 2.0/Demon NWoD)."

As written, psychic powers do not have the same mileage that a vampire can get out of it's abilities, for example.(though this is a bit intended by game design, as a vampire is a full supernatural creature, while a psychic is not.)

She's obsessed with him and doesn't want him associated with his ""dangerous"" friends.   Best way to do is to NOT have her physically harm any of them. But constantly mettle in and ruin their plans. Needless to say, ""breaking up"" with her won't be enough to end her obsession. Hopefully these are the kinds of characters that will think twice about harming someone like that, and try to outsmart and outmaneuver rather than resort to violence (because that's just too easy).   1b)   Or... I saw that one of your PCs is a child-vampire. Make the obsessed person believe that the PC is HER child. And she needs to keep her child away from these ""dangerous"" people (the other PCs).   2)  The ghost of someone they kill in game. He manifests to them in a later scene all pissed off. He continues popping up and always at the worst moment. Need to get away from the cops? Oh shit the ghost just turned off your engine.   Eventually the character responsible will have to make amends. Maybe by helping the ghost settle unfinished business with family/friends/etc.  3)   A character that the PCs know and like -- works really well if this character was a mentor and/or a father-figure to another character. But unfortunately, he's oathbound to the big bad guy for whatever reason. This character feels strongly about honor, even if he wishes he didn't have to do what he does. Earlier on, before hostilities escalate with the big baddie, he may ""left them off with a warning"". But once things start to escalate, he would reluctantly have to fight the characters."

I will probably just say there aren't any metal detectors, because it would be an arbitrary obstacle that detracts from the importance of the scene.  I suppose my question is more about the nature of the Unfleshed.

The Cons of MES are, bizarrely, the draw of having fewer players. I have several friends who have lots of anxiety issues and would never play in a game of more than 5 people. Also, there's having to work with the addenda and not being free to use what i want.

Also, you could do a linear regression on height since we can kind of assume a few (x,y) coordinates between size 5 and 6. Which comes out to Size = ((Height+2)*2)/3  Size 5 is about a human around 5.5 to 6 feet tall. Size 6 is a human around 7 feet tall.   So our x=size and y=height  We got then two coordinates (5,5.5) and (6,7). Our slope is 1.5/1 so we have y=1.5x + b. SOlving for b we have 7=1.5(6) + b. That's 7= 9 + b. b=-2  So that leaves us with y = 1.5*x - 2. Its obviously not great at the extreme of 1. A size 1 creature would be less than 0 feet tall. But moving forward from 2 its ok.  So my terrible formula says ""height = 1.5size - 2"" Lets say we have a 13 foot tall creature. It'd be 13 = 1.5size - 2. We solve for size: 15= 1.5*size, size = 10.  So size can be calculated to be ((Height+2)*2)/3  Its kinda taking a shotgun to a precision task, but its a start."

Considering the vampire can spend blood to boost Strength further, and to get automatic successes from the vigor dice, that might actually be an effective strength of 34.  I was asking about size because there's a demon form that grants +4 size, and with the huge size merit, it can hit size 10.

WhiteWolfRPG,3cn7b8,ArgentThane,2,Thu Jul 9 05:24:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you got the metaplot down but if your players are playing as Neonates realize that you have just set the scene for a campaign spanning the links of Paris to Transylvania, not an easy distance to transverse for vampires during that day and age. You also are painting with broad strikes and I would focus on the everyday living for your vampires.  You also stated that you wrote their characters which sounds as if you didn't let them pick their clans. I'd advise letting them at least pick what clan they come from. As first time players, explain that each clan has the 'traditional' powers of movie vampires all the way from turning into a bat to seducing their prey. See what each wants to play and go from there to add story. Also I suggest remembering that 'high clan' is subjective on your location. And if the character picks a low clan, make it so that politics disfavor them. With no Camarilla or Sabbat, it all boils down to clan so don't take that choice from them. (Tremere are hated by Gangrel, Tzimisce, and Nosferatu but backed by Ventrue. Toreador and Nosferatu hate each other. Ventrue are opposed by the Lasombra and the Brujah).   My players are comprised of a Venetian Ventrue merchant, an 'alchemist' Romanian Tremere, an Irish Gangrel heretic, and a French Toreador courtier. The game is set in Prague and I don't let them travel very much as it is insanely difficult for neonate vampires with the threat of werewolves, bandits, sunlight, and sustenance, not to mention that they have to have ghouls to protect them, food to feed those ghouls. So keep that in mind with the plot you create that huge spanning campaigns are fun but the Court of Love is a huge distance.  Giovanni Chronicles is a great way to break players in to the dark ages and offers a metaplot heavy story.   Other smaller and local things to do though are as follows: A city is experiencing growing pains and a new district is being built with all the perks that may contain. Churches, tradesmen, and houses will be built. Sabotage or help either faction to keep business in the 'old' district where the Prince wants it or the 'new' district where someone of 'insert' clan is offering the players domain and fresh feeding grounds.  The Tremere need constant supplies as they hole up in their chantries and are requesting the player's aid in the form of glass, parchment, and blood. The first two supplies come easy enough but the blood not so much... it must be delivered by the vessel and they need 20 living bodies. Will the players strike out their own humanity in exchange for a possible boon of magic? How do they get their hands on 20 living people to hand over to the Tremere. And if they do it this once, will they do it again?  A botched feeding attempt has led a local woman to be labeled a witch as her husband awoke to one of the players feeding off one of the family. Accused of inviting in this demon, the 'witch' faces public trial by sundown and is to be burnt. Can the players silence this spectacle before a full on witch hunt begins or the attention of the Inquisition is brought on them."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cn7b8,Romero021,2,Thu Jul 9 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"When I say I wrote the characters, I designed the sheets, and let them pick from a pool of what they wanted to play. I intentionally limited it due to magic making things pretty wonky, and as new players, I don't want them to rely on magic to overcome everything. So no Cappodocian, Tzimisce Koldun, Tremere, Abyss Mysticism, et all, initially. Maybe, if they role play right, down the line, they can get clan magic. After their first characters die, I'll expand after that and let them choose within reason from the 13/14 and the countless bloodlines.  I also had plans to mostly start in Eastern Europe with Jurgen on the front lines. Where the Tremere are fighting for survival, but only backed because Jürgen needed allies, then as Hardestadt is building the Camarilla,  have them travel to London and the Baronies where Mithras has outright banished them, and try to sway him to not rule as a God, openly as he has done, but obey the Masquerade.

Ghouls as player-owned NPCs for a vampire game I'd rule that they can have 1 dot in any physical discipline, but beyond that they can only have disciplines that the player can use. 2 dots of retainer would grant them someone roughly equivalent to a starting player character in terms of mechanical ability. 1 dot would give them someone with only one dot in potence (or vigour, whatever) and a starting character with no freebie points to spend. If they really want to put all their eggs in one basket and have 5 dots of retainer represent one hench-as-fuck ghoul (rather than the ""one 2-dot ghoul, plus three 1-dot-ghouls"" that I'd go for) I'd have to play power levels a bit more by ear, but I'd probably lean towards 3 dots getting an extra 10 freebie points, 4 dots an extra 10 again, and 5 dots getting another 10 yet again.

Aether is really hard to acquire especially new demons who don't have any sort of support network built. I've taken to asking my players some character development questions at the start of each session in exchange for either some willpower or aether and they almost always take the Aether. The Cipher seems pretty intimidating and you're not wrong. The way I started is by looking for an inspirational quote that I felt was relevant for their final truth. I built interlocks by taking two powers and trying to overlap them somehow but without just making a better version of either of the two base powers. It will take a while for players to get their first interlock so you have some time to work on this but; any interactions with the godmachine lets players roll for cipher information so be wary of throwing angel after angel at the party. Cover checks are going to be entirely on your judgement, try keeping the character's high concept in mind and asking ""is this something a ""blank"" person would do here?"" If yes then no worries, if no then consider rolling. Manipulation is for whatever reason a really key stat for players, I recommended all of my players put at least 2 points into it since so many embeds and exploits run off it."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cid6p,tyler2790,2,Wed Jul 8 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, Could you go into the cipher a little deeper? I've read about it alot but i still feel i need the ELI5.

WhiteWolfRPG,3cid6p,tyler2790,2,Wed Jul 8 15:28:07 2015 UTC,"No problem I'll go into the cipher first since admittedly its kind of daunting. The Cipher is storywise a path of enlightenment that a demon follows on their journey to ""hell"". the cipher is made up of 4 Keys the first of which the player picks in accordance with they're incarnation (destroyers have to have pick a cacophony embed etc.) Following this you pick a final ""truth"" for the demon; the truth isn't an answer or a solution but more typically it's a guidepost, something that the demon can identify on their journey that clarifies or confirms the path they've been going down.  Mechanically following the 1st key being chosen you the ST choose 3 more embeds that you think thematically follow the ""truth"" you've chosen. Select the order you want them in and they become your 4 keys for the character (You may end up changing the order or even the embeds entirely I know I did quite a bit). Once you've locked in what the keys are you create the imbeds the unique combination powers of two different keys. Imbeds are entirelly your creation you'll be in uncharted waters so to speak so don't be afraid to change them if they aren't working like you thought. I'll list the Imbeds that I've been pretty happy with so far in my game.  Humogenous Memory + Hesitation = You First  Causes a group of targets to all wait for someone else to go first  Special Someone + Right Tools Right Job = Is there a Doctor? Fate intervenes and insures there is a professional around of the proper type for your current problem.  Right Tools Right Job + Strength Through Adversity = Battleworn Glory The more damage a tool has sustained the more powerful the bonus the object provides.  Not all powers work together super well and I've gone back and editted interlocks more times then I can count so don't be afraid to scrap or change something if it's not working even if a player already has an interlock. Good Luck."

I've tried to just add one thing that the demons are able to do a session, for instance last session I informed them on pact making, glitches and their demon form being able to change as they grow in power.  I found the best way to pick a ""truth"" is to just go looking for inspirational quotes on various subjects for a Guardian you could look at quotes on defending, action, consequences. Also ask your player what they want their ""end game"" to be so to speak so you get a sense where they want their character to be when they are reaching their peak as a demon. Finally, their Truth is technically, the last thing the player gets from the cipher so don't be afraid to wing it for a bit till you settle on something.

WhiteWolfRPG,3cfjoc,PraiseCaine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"Great tooling! :D  So I'm only a super-noob leatherworker, but the people who taught me taught me to transfer designs by putting the design over damp leather and then tracing over it with a blunt-edge point, leaving creases, instead of actual marks. I mean obviously graphite-transfer works too, and maybe you chose it specifically because of some reason, but fyi in case you hadn't ever heard of that technique!"
WhiteWolfRPG,3cfjoc,CorvidaeSF,2,Tue Jul 7 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"The tandy kit I got suggested tracing the design onto tracing paper, then using the tracing paper over the leather to get an imprint. We did the graphite transfer in order to skip one of the precise tracings, to try to keep the lines straight."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cfjoc,CorvidaeSF,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:14:11 2015 UTC,Yeah with something complicated I can see the concern about it losing detail between transfers
WhiteWolfRPG,3cfjoc,Invisibru2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"A fine point stylus will leave a very shallow impression on cased leather, and can be scuffed out with a ballpoint stylus if there are any errors. It's also a little easier to see than graphite lines. Still, do whatever works for you, and whatever gives you the most control. Source: I'm a custom leather worker.   Looks great!"
WhiteWolfRPG,3cihw0,drekstorm,5,Wed Jul 8 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose to settle you into a low humanity rating but not make it too easy to fall to humanity 0.   I'd assume one of the points of Vampire is the descent from being a fine human into a monster. Of course, the game isn't fun if its just a race to 0, so as your character gets acclimated in a society that pays little mind for the welfare of anyone else he/she should stabilize at a low enough point where you are aware of losing your humanity but would need some extreme measures to actually cross that path.   TL;DR its a game about maintaining humanity, so you should at least have to sweat becoming an npc."
WhiteWolfRPG,3cihw0,DeadpoolNakago,3,Wed Jul 8 04:30:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Look to the story telling as the descent happens. Humanity loss shouldn't be something easily glossed over and should provide large/major junctions in the story. Even on a failure that causes the Vampire to descend doesn't mean that the Vampire is unaware of the descending, that they've become more ""accustomed"" now to the monster that resides inside of them and of course how that affects them. While they might be able to easily murder at Humanity 4, they might still strive to better themselves and actively seek to prevent themselves from descending further.  I'd recommend introducing Vampires as NPCs with a much lower that normal Humanity rating as examples of what they are capable of doing as they ride the monster. Humanity 3 means that you can openly just kill just cause. Even 4 needs a ""reason"" though it can be more broad. 5 means killing to end a life such as beheading a Sabbat member after he's been dropped into torpor. I would advise against anything lower than a 3 as it is very difficult to play that level of open murderer and be a ""productive"" member of society."

WhiteWolfRPG,3ci655,DeadpoolNakago,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"Actually sounds pretty cool to me! I am no expert in crunch, though. I'd make Auspex 3 (Spirit's Touch) require Wits + Investigation. The reasoning here is that your mind is being filled with rather quick bursts of sensations corresponding to each of the five senses. Your goal is to remain alert and observant enough to pick out important details in these visions, which is very similar to a mundane Wits + Investigation roll. You can totally allow Intelligence + Investigation instead if the visions are really confusing/abstract, since Intelligence + Investigation is rolled to solve riddles/enigmas in mundane rolls. Crafts doesn't make sense to me. You don't need to know how to put together an AK-47 to interpret the psychic resonance left by the murderer who used it. It's a mystical and not scientific process. Your alterations of Majesty were especially fitting in my eyes as well.   Always remember: it's not a sin to allow different dice pools for the same power, as long as it makes sense.   Hope you found this post useful! :)  EDIT: I'd love to see what other alterations you made. Could you please show me?"
WhiteWolfRPG,3ci655,GottaGoFeast,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:53:53 2015 UTC,Wits + Investigation makes sense as its listed in the Big black Book as the combo for a crime scene investigation. I shied form using it just to  keep the mechanical balance of wits v intelligence uses in game. though its maybe not the big a deal.  As an aside to this too: I actually find it interesting how many times powers like the disciplines show up in Mage as rotes with the Mage rotes very different from what was in VtR.

WhiteWolfRPG,3cfw2g,malonkey1,7,Tue Jul 7 21:36:31 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, you're right!  They do look like supervillains.  I mean, the Hungers are all based around classic villain archetypes, so it makes sense.  They would act like supervillains, to an extent, just weird ones without spandex costumes.   Tyrants: the evil overlords Collectors: the thief villains, always planning a clever heist Predators: sadistic thrill killers  Nemesis: the anti-villain, who pretends to do good, but is more interested in vengeance than justice Ravagers: the nihilists who ""just want to watch the world burn.""

I thought that since she has a cult and the gangrel has a liking to animals, maybe make it appear as if she was pursued by a a hunter with an attack dog, trying probably to use her humanity against her. And since they had hunter problems, she will probably not suspect things right away... All while using a small dose of presence to pull some feelz out of her.  She could pass for a mortal but then since it is a sabbat game the other would probably try to snack her her and make her break her disguise. Better to play the serpent of light card since I also have one on the table. :)"

WhiteWolfRPG,3ce37s,Sabawoyomu,5,Tue Jul 7 11:53:57 2015 UTC,Lots of very unfortunate and unintended subtext in the writing. It's mostly been cleared up by the revisions.
WhiteWolfRPG,3ce37s,XenesisXenon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:46:18 2015 UTC,Really? Like what? I didn't notice anything but maybe they had already revised it..
WhiteWolfRPG,3ce37s,Sabawoyomu,5,Tue Jul 7 15:40:28 2015 UTC,"There were a few things going on.  The gist of it is that there are two themes they were playing with, and they don't mesh well together.  1 - Beasts as a stand-in for minorities.  2 - Reveling in being a monster  There were some fairly strong (and, IIRC deliberate) parallels between Beasts and minorities and between Heroes and bigots.  Except the Beasts actually were causing harm.  All the time.  They had power and influence, and they were generally popular everywhere they went (Social bonuses with the supernaturals).  They're a pretty terrible fit for minorities, as it reads that the minorities are causing harm, and we should just be OK with that.   And the Heroes had no choice - They were essentially being mind-controlled into being bigots.  The book was explicit that they had no option but to hunt Beasts because of external influences.  Which, when combined with the sneering tone the book took towards them, was just a bit uncomfortable (I saw it described as Victim: The Blamening, which did make me chuckle).    A description I saw here (either this sub or /r/rpg) was that it's a game where you play as gay people, fighting against oppression.  Only the homophobes are right, because you're literally causing hurricanes that are killing people."

WhiteWolfRPG,3ce37s,Sabawoyomu,2,Tue Jul 7 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"(and, IIRC deliberate) parallels between Beasts and minorities   No, Matt's said repeatedly it was not his intent."
WhiteWolfRPG,3ce37s,Ginnerben,4,Tue Jul 7 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"I've not seen him say that anywhere public (and I thought I'd been paying attention to the campaign).   That said, if he didn't intend those parallels then the rewrites were even more necessary than I thought. When your Heroes include a fedora-wearing, M'Ladying neckbeard, your Beasts include a feminist that punishes men and you publicly compare people who sympathise with Heroes with MRAs (I believe the exact quote was ""but what about the Heroes"") and you're not intending to make a statement, then I'd suggest that you're struggling with self awareness and your own personal biases.  That's not something I thought I'd say about Matt. I've seen him commenting on these issues before and he seems very aware."
WhiteWolfRPG,3ce5h9,capukee,2,Tue Jul 7 05:16:45 2015 UTC,"Skin Thieves have a specific Totem that they can change into. So if their Totem animal is a dog, they can only turn into a dog. I would say from the text it's specific to breed as well, but I can't find any specific passages that confirm that.  They need a Talisman to transform, which is typically the skin of the animal that they transform into, but it doesn't have to be. Creating a Talisman is not an easy task so you can't just skin a new dog and be ready to transform. It takes time to dedicate it.  TL:DR you can only turn into your Totem Animal, breed restrictions are up to your Storyteller."

WhiteWolfRPG,3ce5h9,AtlanteanSteel,2,Tue Jul 7 10:57:38 2015 UTC,I have the book they are presented as both antagonists and protagonists just like the second sight book.  But once you figured out that there was a skinned dog in the neighborhood it's gonna be easy to spot the dog wandering about again.
WhiteWolfRPG,3ce5h9,ELTepes,2,Tue Jul 7 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"Skin Thieves can only change into their totem animal.  You're probably thinking of Body Thieves from Immortals who psychically exchange bodies. They can technically be protagonists but they lost morality so fast that you wouldn't be able to really play one for long by the original rules. The move to Integrity over Morality in 2nd Ed likely makes it easier to play a Body Thief, at least for a longer amount of time."
