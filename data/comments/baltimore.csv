baltimore,3e43gy,Bmorewiser,2,Tue Jul 21 20:19:23 2015 UTC,Can someone with a legal background chime in?  It doesn't sound legal to garnish money from an entity that wasn't a defendant... to me at least.
baltimore,3e43gy,BmoreInterested,5,Tue Jul 21 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"Not too familiar with this case and I literally JUST graduated law school, but here's my understanding:  Plaintiffs, kids, sued cops for fucking with the kids. Cops have a contract with the city which states the city will represent the cops, and will pay out any damages awarded against the cops, for any actions the cops take within the scope of their employment (this is a legal term of art). City settles with plaintiffs for 150k.  City then has to go vote at the board of estimates to approve spending the money.  SRB refuses to vote for spending the money, arguing that the cops acted outside the scope of their employment.    Settlement agreement now void, the kids and the cops go to trial. The city represents the cops.  The COPS are the defendants. The kids win. City appealed on behalf of the cops, lost. The defendant-cops owe the kids 200k, therefore, per the contract, the City owes the plaintiff-kids 200k. City refuses to pay. Court orders M&T to garnish the City's funds.  M&T does so and charges the City $150 processing fee.   So, what's the argument? The City contracted to pay out whatever damages were won against the cops.  Typically, when a defendant refuses to pay, the remedy is for the court to levy (seize) the defendant's stuff, either bank accounts, real property, what have you.  However, here, the City isn't a defendant. It wasn't found liable of anything. The cops were, the city just promised to pay on behalf of the cops.   So the issue is whether garnishment is proper against an indemnified third party (a party who promise to pay up on behalf of the defendant). I can't imagine this is a very novel or complex issue, indemnification happens all the time in many contexts.   EDIT: Thinking about it further, the issue seems to stem from the ""scope of employment"" clause in the contract. We have to know more about what happened at the trial, but if the cops were found liable for damages to the kids, AND it was determined that they weren't acting in the scope of employment as cops, then the city has a good argument that its not responsible for the money.  I don't know, this is confusing."

baltimore,3e43gy,thepulloutmethod,2,Tue Jul 21 23:22:46 2015 UTC,"It's not that at all. It's an extremely complicated legal issue, but it's complicated because of the interplay between various state laws, historical anomalies that make the city police force part state and part city actors, traditional notions of respondeat superior liability, municipal immunity, and all sorts of other things. It's all complicated but not intentionally so, just incompetent legislation and a strange history."

The MD general assembly basically took the BPD out of the control of the City during the Civil War, because it was worried the confederate-leaning City would use the BPD against the Union.  It's been a quasi-state agency ever since."

baltimore,3e22jr,Veyron109,5,Tue Jul 21 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"The unrest that day began outside Mondawmin Mall, a transportation hub for students getting out of several nearby schools...  Officials said they had seen a flier on social media that Mondawmin would be the scene of a ""purge"" — a reference to a move in which authorities allow a period of unrest...  As dismissal loomed, the Maryland Transit Authority shut down its Mondawmin subway and bus station, and police commanders sent dozens of officers to the mall.  Goodwin, the schools police chief, emails district officials: ""The decision to shut down the Mondawmin Mall hub was made by MTA officials without any notification to city schools.""   IMO, this is one of the main reasons that the riots started. The police took this threat of a ""purge"" too seriously and shut down the Mondawmin transportation hub, trapping a huge groups of students there and dispatching a large police force in riot gear, totally escalating the situation.  I remember watching Colin Campbell's live stream on Periscope and hearing kids on the phone saying that they couldn't get home because the buses weren't running. Some kids had just ended up there because it is a big transfer point for the MTA, multiple bus lines stop there as well as the metro.   There's no way to know what would have happened with this ""purge"" if the BCPD hadn't taken it so seriously, but they undoubtedly escalated the situation with terrible decision making by the higher ups and no one ever talks about it. I hope this article can bring some of that to light."

I'm sure they had a small laundry list of records they requested from that day. I don't know Maryland's public records law, but the city usually has a certain window of time to respond. So if this footage was released, chances are that means some of the other things they and other media requested like mall footage if it exists might start showing up in the next week or so to be compliant with that window.  Edit: Looked up the Maryland law. It looks like agencies have 30 days to comply, however, they can take longer if it takes them longer to locate and obtain the record. So we don't know when the Sun filed their request, but we also don't know when the city acquired surveillance footage as part of its investigation. But the fact stuff started to come out now means you might see several things come out in a short time frame."
baltimore,3e22jr,Boyhowdy107,5,Tue Jul 21 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'm happy this video is out because it shows that the police response was sparse, unorganized, and mostly inadequate to stop it before it got out of hand. I understand after many officers were hurt in the initial melee at Mondawmin Mall they were hesitant to move on the violent rioters, and they organized too late to quell the already out of hand over tones in the streets. If there had been units authorized to offensively hunt the violent actors from Mondawmin this could have been squashed before it started. Once a large crowd was seen moving down city streets, they should have been headed off in the run down homes sections of the area before they reached the main intersection where businesses are located. They will be a lot less willing to burn their own homes down then a ""faceless"" business like CVS. Hard lessons learned, and I agree Batts is more responsible than SRB for things getting out of hand.   Yes SRB needs to go, but it was Batts in control and responsible for this debacle, and it was job to report to the mayor what was happening as it unfolded. I am not defending SRB here, she fucked up plenty, but I k is for a fact it was mismanagement down the ranks that led to this national embarrassment. Once SRB was involved all she could do was sit and watch to see who was gaining ground and who was losing it, and once the fires started popping up outside the main area of North and Penn it was too late and all she could do was call for reinforcements from the Governor.   I would like to know who commanded those troops and reinforcements to guard downtown and let the city burn overnight, and I'd like to know who exactly is at fault for the delayed response for outside reinforcements - Batts probably. I don't know the protocol for mutual aid down there, but I'm pretty sure it has to come from Batts or SRB. Can anyone shine light on those questions?"

baltimore,3dze9x,neobaltimorian,26,Mon Jul 20 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"As a state employee, I can tell you that the DBM publishes the salary scales here http://dbm.maryland.gov/employees/Pages/SalaryInformation.aspx.   You may not be able to negotiate very much. Generally the salaries are set at a bit above the base for your classification. You also won't be able to negotiate your days off. You'll probably start at 2 weeks but you'll get another 6 paid personal days a year plus 10 or 11 holidays. You'll also pay a pittance for your health care, way less than the private sector and even less than federal employees. Besides your 401k, there is a guaranteed benefit pension. That means that every pay period, the state puts money away for you (you don't get to opt out) and gives back when you retire. It's a totally sweet deal and all you have to do is stick it out till 20 yrs or age 59. It's unlikely that you would get relocation $$ but you can probably take Christmas week off, as long as someone is left in your department. Your personal days will arrive every January and are yours to use throughout the year, but while you can carry over your vacation and sick days, you can't carry over your personal days. The state personnel web site is an open book. Just go to the above DBM page and start there. Welcome, we surely need all the IThelp we can get."

Same with benefits, including time off. I doubt they'd pay relocation, but that's usually position specific. The state is very much about making things as equal as possible with the basics. You can ask how quickly your position moves up grades to get an idea of what to expect, but it's not guaranteed if there are budget freezes. We do get a nice amount of holidays and my department at least is very accommodating about time off. You do also get free public transit access with your state ID."
baltimore,3dze9x,kiipii,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"Typically government jobs are very limited in what they can offer. Usually no room to negotiate benefits, and as mentioned, pay is limited within a certain grade. You can write a nice letter detailing your previous pay and experience, demonstrating that you might have a faster learning curve coming on etc. and shoot for a couple of steps higher. If you were scheduled to have a raise soon from your current work, let them know that as well. One thing worth a shot if they don't negotiate pay is an early review. Rather than wait a full year to possibly get a raise, see if they can do it in 6 months."

baltimore,3dybvc,chashiineriiya,15,Mon Jul 20 15:10:06 2015 UTC,Related...  I'm sure many of you are not aware that MD 404 is one of the most dangerous roads in the state. I can count about ten fatal accidents this year alone on that road. Saving lives is important too.  This: http://www.wusa9.com/story/news/local/maryland/2015/04/21/triple-fatal-tractor-trailers/26116579/  is not at all outside the norm unfortunately.

baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,10,Mon Jul 20 23:19:04 2015 UTC,"If it's about safety and not improving infrastructure then I'm curious as to what measures have been implemented on a local level that aim to reduce speed on this stretch.   No doubt adding a median between lanes will help prevent head on collision. But I think the effect of a widened road will be increased speed in the improved area and its immediate surroundings.   Just think that more active enforcement of speeding, passive measures to reduce speed (cameras, chicanes, etc.) and adding a median/bollards fits the bill more than major improvement like this. Especially if it's projected go cut only 8 minutes of travel time."
baltimore,3dybvc,Keedy_Black_AMA,11,Tue Jul 21 00:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'll address just a few of your points. I drive this road quite frequently as it is the most direct route from North OC (my home) across the bridge, which is where a lot of my work takes me.   This is SHA right-of-way. Local levels of interference are prohibited. People already travel 70+ mph on the road in its 2 lane configuration. A dual carriageway will absolutely increase safety for those who are driving in traffic with the speeders. There is so much freight traffic on this route that half of your suggestions are moot and are likely to create more problems than they solve. I can tell you that there is usually too much traffic to do much speeding on this road currently. Safety is paramount to 8 minutes of travel time. And it's going to save me a lot more than 8 minutes to get home during the summer. More like 30-40. Much of the cost is related to environmental regulations (Critical Areas & 100-year flood plains). I'm glad there are a lot of environmental provisions, but it should be considered when we are talking about cost.   Now, we can discuss an alternative approach to improving traffic that Delaware took: alternate routes. Lots of em. But would you rather improve and develop 4 rural routes or 1 rural highway?"
baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,5,Mon Jul 20 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that on the sections where it is a two lane road, you will ALWAYS get stuck behind a tractor trailer and SOMEONE will try to go around it, risking head on collision if they're not careful."
baltimore,3dybvc,Timey_Wimey_TARDIS,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:35 2015 UTC,"This is not going to save ""30-40 minutes"" that's ludicrous  When you take in to consideration that there will be more redlights added, the short distance, and that the project is already partially complete there is no way that 30, much less 40 minutes are being cut off anything.  Edit: the 404 project only covers 11 miles, and some of it is already done."
baltimore,3dybvc,hideisalive,0,Mon Jul 20 23:06:25 2015 UTC,I mean that's me timing it a few weeks ago on a Thursday afternoon. From 50 past Starr rd all the way to 328.

baltimore,3dybvc,hideisalive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:16:22 2015 UTC,No that's how long of a delay I often encounter along that stretch of 404 right now.
baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say that 4 rural roots makes more sense than 1 rural highway because it provides more interconnectivity. More areas would benefit and it provides additional routes instead of a singular option.    local police cannot enforce speeding on this section of road? Perhaps local officials can point at these issues and encourage the SHA to enforce speeding infractions.  so then someone needs to enforce the speed limit. Added lanes won't necessarily increase safety. A median would increase safety as well as larger shoulders. Adding additional lanes at the expense of shoulders or medians wouldn't.  I'm not sure how traffic calming measures won't serve to calm traffic. Shouldn't matter whether a 16-wheeler hauling freight or a Smart are driving.  sorry, going to go with the hard data on this instead of your anecdotes. Any facts on crash statistics on this road too compared to other rural roads in Maryland? I can't seem to find anything other than news reports on individual crashes.  critical areas should absolutely be respected."
baltimore,3dybvc,Keedy_Black_AMA,3,Tue Jul 21 12:12:30 2015 UTC,"I agree that 4 routes makes more sense, but in a way this is already one of many alternate routes to avoid US 50. So it's a little of both I suppose. They are adding a median. That's the main point of the project. You can't enforce the entire road all the time for speeders. That's akin to removing drug users by hiring more cops. Doesn't work that way. ""Traffic Calming Measures"" is a nice buzzword. What do you mean specifically by traffic calming device? Roundabouts? Rumble strips? Narrow lanes? And yes this road is notoriously dangerous. Good luck naviagting SHA website, but here is a safety-oriented press release from O'Malley's time: http://www.mdot.maryland.gov/News/Releases2014/2014May21_Gov_Lt.Gov_Announce_MD404_Widening.html"
baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,3,Mon Jul 20 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"Obama's stimulus also gave funds to this road too back in the day.   There are literally cameras that take pictures of people speeding and send them monetary fines. 24/7/365.  I didn't specifically lay out measures, like a chicane, because you mentioned the amount of trucks on the road and nitpicked it. But other things like rumble strips, community gateways/singage, surface treatments, speed bumps, woonerf-type improvements through towns/residential areas that give space to pedestrians. Roundabouts would be nice too."
baltimore,3dybvc,Keedy_Black_AMA,0,Mon Jul 20 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I didn't think baltimoreons were still allowed to talk about speed cameras. Guess you guys worked that out. (Sorry, used to live there had to jest).  Anyways, you are on point about traffic calming devices, but that'd almost the trouble. This road goes through exactly 0 populated places and is flat as hell. Those features are a tough sell, even to myself."

baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"The majority of crashes are conflicts at intersections that could be addressed with traffic calming measures and turn restrictions. Widening isn't going to solve these issues, in fact it will likely worsen them in places."

baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"Have you ""studied"" the road? What does that even mean? If you're an engineer and have actually studied the road, I'd be interested in seeing the data that leads you to the conclusion that a median, traffic calming, and turn restrictions wouldn't reduce crashes, and that widening is somehow the only answer.   I've certainly driven 404 frequently over the past 15 years, and daily for several of those years."
baltimore,3dybvc,bmore,7,Mon Jul 20 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"Yes I absolutely have studied it through my work. And I drive it very often. It is the fastest way from my house to the Bay Bridge.   And pretty much all of those ideas you have are implemented in the dualizing process. (J-turns, medians, acceleration and deceleration lanes) etc. So what's your point?"
baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"That the dualizing itself is unneeded, costly, and will only induce demand on a road that prioritizes traffic to Delaware instead of Maryland beaches and businesses. If they were just implementing the safety measures, I'd be more supportive."
baltimore,3dybvc,bmore,8,Mon Jul 20 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"Many 404 travelers are going to MD beaches, trust me. Many aren't even making it all the way and instead use it to avoid using 50 to get to 113 or 13. And even if they are going to Delaware, the safety affects Maryland drivers. And, playing devil's advocate, are you saying that if Virginians used 404 the most we shouldn't care about their safety as much? That's a bit harsh and not very humanistic.  This is rural Maryland. Induced demand? You might have a point in Queen Anne's County, but that's about it. Even then, much of the land along 404 is preserved, which was part of 404's planning process (which reaches back to 1985 FYI. Yes this has been on the board for 30 years.) Talbot's zoning regs are so strict that it'll never happen and Caroline could honestly use the demand, if it ever were to occur on the scale required for real economic development.  And DE isn't dualizing 404. Just thought I'd point that out."
baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,0,Mon Jul 20 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"Almost everything you said here basically backs my disinterest in widening this route. Your safety query isn't really relevant because I'm fine with the safety improvements, just not the widening.   We should be discouraging 404 as a beach route to MD beaches because we have improved 50 for that purpose.   I think you're talking about sprawl in your reply to me about induced demand. My point is if we improve 404 and reward use of that road as a speedway to the beach, more people will choose it as a speedway to the beach, filling capacity again on that roadway instead of choosing alternate routes.  DE isn't dualizing 404, so again, what exactly is the point of widening the road to funnel it later on?  And finally, I know this has been on the books for 30 years. Things change over time, and it seems more like a bad idea now than it did then."
baltimore,3dybvc,bmore,5,Mon Jul 20 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"That's fine if you take what I've said as a reason not to widen the route. Traffic engineers see it the other way.  From a mathematical standpoint, creating more viable alternate routes is the most cost-effective and least impactful (I thought this was a word, guess not Chrome...) method of reducing congestion. Way more reasonable than widening roads. And that should be the ultimate point of 404 for sure. A safe, alternate route for travelers across the shore, regardless of season.  To be honest, I'd be fine with dualizing 404 to mirror MD 90. And a flyover from Southbound 50 would go a long way to help traffic on 50 itself.   Things change over time, and it seems more like a bad idea now than it did then.   I see we have come full circle."
baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:41 2015 UTC,A 50 flyover makes loads more sense to be prioritized over the 404 dualization.  Haven't traffic volumes on 404 in the past decade barely changed?
baltimore,3dybvc,bmore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"They're widening US 113 for the same reasons, and people are hating on that, too, unfortunately. They're right - there isn't really enough traffic to warrant widening, but there's certainly safety issues that result from a high-traffic, two-lane non-divided highway. And to me, that means widening is a godsend.  I take 113 to work daily. People don't like getting stuck behind tractor trailers or other slow people (some drivers slow down once they reach two-way traffic) so they try to pass, sometimes unsafely. I don't think the dualization can come fast enough. I like the other traffic being behind a jersey wall...  I also take MD 12 to work, and people try to unsafely pass there too, but there's definitely not enough traffic to warrant any changes to 12 at all."
baltimore,3dybvc,_zhang,4,Mon Jul 20 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"You and I had an exchange about 113 before. I think two lanes the whole way is the right move, but I disagree with the piecemeal 10 year plan. Do it all at once or don't do it. Spending all this time only confuses people, even locals."

baltimore,3dybvc,jwhardcastle,8,Tue Jul 21 13:46:30 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell, yes the red line is, as infrastructure goes, better than nothing. But the NPV of a better-designed, more integrated system would be much much higher than the wimpy little red line. Its a waste of time and resources and has already wasted a lot of time. By the time the red line was imagined it was already out dated and inadequately designed. I don't like WHY Hogan cut the red line, but I do like that he did."
baltimore,3dybvc,seanlax5,8,Mon Jul 20 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"You do realize that the red line was a once in a generation chance to improve public transport in the city right? The city has nowhere near the resources to build underground rail by itself.  It took years of planning by the city and state, plus a transformational election with a progressive president who had supermajorities in both the house and senate.  This allowed billions to flow into public transit around the country.  This opportunity is now gone and Baltimore missed out. It was better than nothing and now we have nothing."

Law is a practical field.  Sure, philosophy (or more specifically, policy) is relevant in determining what the law should be, but it's irrelevant when determining what the law is and how it applies to any given set of facts. That's probably why people respond poorly.  They're trying to talk about how to apply a formula and you're trying to talk about how the formula was derived.  I'm just guessing, though.  Either way no one should treat you poorly."
baltimore,3dybvc,thepulloutmethod,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:43 2015 UTC,What about people who have literally been reading about the Red Line since Glendening. I mean we aren't exactly casuals...
baltimore,3dybvc,hideisalive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:26:05 2015 UTC,Well not everyone lives in Baltimore.  Plenty of people drive on 404 much more often than twice a year.

There is no ""backroads"" way around the bridge."
baltimore,3dybvc,Slowhand09,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"Im pointing out how stupid it was to play it off as anything but pandering to two types of people:   The small minority of people who actually travel across it for work everyday. The large amount of people who see this, travel across the bridge maybe 5 times a year and seriously consider Hogan and hero for such a life changing maneuver without considering the effects of lower state income and nothing to make up the difference."

And your reply seems to pander to the ""sour grapes"" crowd as it isn't related to the Redline or widening 404 discussion.  It just looking for more wood to stoke the fire."
baltimore,3dybvc,Slowhand09,8,Tue Jul 21 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"Not convinced, the cost of the line was going to be absolutely insane as discussed by many other threads on this subreddit. While I was looking forward to the line because I enjoy using public transport, the cost for the state was going to be crazy. If it has been moved to full street level movement instead of underground it would have been as inefficient as the light rail and potentially led to another deadzone like there is on part of the light rail downtown. I don't know what the solution to our problems are, maybe build the city up more around the beltway so that it can be easily accessible by highway, granted those are a CF too.   Maybe we could encourage staggering of work hours? Maybe jurisdictions around Baltimore could change the start times of classes to spread out the number of people on roads at one time? Maybe the city could try to find the project itself with federal aid? Who knows."
baltimore,3dybvc,Goodmorninworld9,3,Tue Jul 21 13:41:18 2015 UTC,deadzone like there is on part of the light rail downtown   The stretch on Howard Street? I've been stopped on the lightrail on Howard for 15-20 minutes at time.

You knew this would happen if Hogan got elected but you (or at least the majority of you) did nothing to stop it."
baltimore,3dybvc,DBH114,-17,Tue Jul 21 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"Well let's be blunt - after how Baltimore residents have been behaving in the past few months with the explosive murder rate and the crime crisis, do they really DESERVE the Red Line?  Seems like they need to focus on basic public order before demanding amenities like new public transit lines.  It's kind of like people in Aleppo demanding a new sports stadium or something; it's simply not the most pressing need."
baltimore,3dybvc,welfarecuban,16,Mon Jul 20 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"What kind of logic is that? Because 0.05% of the population are murderers, the entire city should be punished? It's a project 10 years in the making that wasn't supposed to be done for another decade plus, but one year of a crime spike and we should just scrap everything."
baltimore,3dybvc,slinkymaster,-10,Mon Jul 20 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"You're asking for the whole state as well as the feds to pitch in to finance this project.  When people from other areas look at Baltimore, what do they see?  They see chaos, crime, violence, depravity, murder... this does not make them more inclined to ""support"" Baltimore or its ambitions.  It makes them perceive Baltimore as a foreign country, one with which they have no real connection.    The people of Baltimore need to behave more like the inhabitants of a first-world developed city, rather than those of a violent third-world slum, and then cooperation becomes a lot easier across municipal lines."

baltimore,3e023x,46718,5,Tue Jul 21 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"Not quite.  A debit card is akin to cash.  Once it is lost, it is very difficult to recover.

One note about the embarrassing marketing for the game...FS1 actually ran an ad for the quarterfinals in Baltimore during the Mexico/Costa Rica game yesterday. That's right...the crack marketing team had an ad running on the 19th for a game played on the 18th.
baltimore,3dxzqo,zaviex,7,Tue Jul 21 00:11:29 2015 UTC,I was there in 2013 and it was decently crowded. Turnout seemed a good bit worse this time around
baltimore,3dxzqo,predictionpain,4,Mon Jul 20 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"In 2013 though the US played El Salvador, and their fans came in droves. The 2nd game on the docket in 2013 was also Costa Rica vs. Honduras, so quite a few of those fans as well from the area.   There are far more immigrants living in the general area from Central America than from Cuba, Jamaica, or Haiti, so that also had a lot to do with the difference in attendance between the two years.  However, this area should be able to sell out a US Soccer home game on its own. The lack of attendance doesn't do much to help the stadium's chances of hosting a World Cup qualifier or quality friendly for the US national team I wouldn't think."
baltimore,3dxzqo,zaviex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:54 2015 UTC,I forgot about that. I was in traffic for 2 hours outside the stadium with El Salvador flags waving all over the place. I had no clue how many of them live around here until then.

I know the last time the Gold Cup was in town attendance was better, but 40,000 tickets sold is not terrible for a soccer game in the U.S.  If they want to sell it out they should really lower the prices for the upper levels.

Just want to nail every little thing down.  edit: Also, do they run late at night as well?"
baltimore,3dyqis,sensesmaybenumbed,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:17 2015 UTC,Don't worry about those suffix indicators really. NS/FS are where the stop is located in relation to the intersection (nearside/farside) but you'll see the bus stop sign easily enough.

I think each side makes some pretty hefty assumptions. In the video the speakers talked about coming from poor neighborhoods yet cleaning up after the protests and unrest. There was a sign talking about stop littering. The speakers talked about meetings that were held where residents of poor communities talked about how to make things better. But none of that gets seen or broadcasted outside of the area, so assumptions get made that the people in those areas aren't doing anything. (because people outside of those communities believe that if there was something noteworthy going on, they would have seen it)"

(It was sold to a new owner partway through my lease) and I'm pretty sure there's some non kosher stuff going on.  Example:  someone tried to break into the house about 3 months ago through the front street level window, which is now compromised to the point that the window is both broken and comes out of the frame... And the landlord refuses to fix it.  But they did replace a water heater that was leaking in the basement.  (Because water damage trumps security apparently).  We never mutually agreed on a new lease when they took over and I don't even know legally what my actual lease terms are and she told me this morning that she is increasing my rent again (second time in 7months) and I feel like it might not be legal to do that..."
baltimore,3dvu88,flannel_smoothie,34,Sun Jul 19 23:58:48 2015 UTC,This is all illegal. You are probably able to Get out of this lease and recoup damages. Stop talking about it on Reddit and contact BNI and a lawyer

baltimore,3dvu88,no_butseriously_guys,-6,Mon Jul 20 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"Haha good on you to link basic lease laws. You are incorrect in that you stated that ""it's all illegal"".  When a rental property is sold, the lease applies to the new landlord, unless there exists a special provision by which said lease ends.  However, a landlord may not increase the rent mid lease unless a new lease is offered and accepted."
baltimore,3dvu88,flannel_smoothie,9,Mon Jul 20 13:07:22 2015 UTC,"So you agree with me that his landlord's practice of arbitrarily increasing the rent is illegal, as well as not keeping the dwelling fit for habitation?  The lease applies as written until one party breaks the lease (edit: or it expires).  This is a classic situation where a landlord bullies a tenant out of their home.  I'm really not sure why you chose to nitpick what I said since you literally agree with me."
baltimore,3dvu88,no_butseriously_guys,-4,Mon Jul 20 13:09:17 2015 UTC,"Dwelling not fit for habitation is a stretch, as the window may not be fully repaired but still serves it's main purpose (keeping the weather out).   Since they repaired the water heater, it also tells me that they are protecting their asset rather than worrying about future break ins. Like you said, they most likely want to tenant to move out, but they can't ""force him"".   Your blanket statement made it seem like the OP can go to court and just say that literally everything the landlord is doing is illegal, which is simply not the case.   The correct answer was below, where the new landlord has to abide by the terms of the lease, cannot increase rent mid-lease, and OP needs to put his rent in Escrow to put pressure on the landlord to comply with the Lease."
baltimore,3dvu88,Joker1337,16,Mon Jul 20 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but I expect it isn't legal unless your lease makes it so explicitly.  When she bought the property, she bought the leases too.  She can either terminate the lease according to the conditions of the lease, or take the lease as-is.  She doesn't get to renegotiate it with you, she either knew the terms of your lease when she bought the place or she didn't and she should go after your former landlord.  You need a real lawyer, but I'd get my ducks lined up to fight if I were you."

If she doesn't like this and tries to evict you, no judge will go for that.  Plus the process takes months.  Keep paying your agreed upon price.  Also, in some places, if shit is crazy broken, you can withhold rent.  PLEASE talk to a lawyer before you do this though, as this was the deal in California, but probably not all places.  Like everyone else is saying, contact BNI!"
baltimore,3dvu88,Timey_Wimey_TARDIS,3,Mon Jul 20 07:12:48 2015 UTC,Rather than witholding rent I would talk to a lawyer about holding it in escrow. I looked into this a while back when I was renting. The basic premise is that you pay your rent to the court and the court will pay your landlord once they fix the living situation.  EDIT ok apparently a lot of people have the same idea
baltimore,3dvu88,ThorsteinStaffstruck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:10 2015 UTC,Never withhold rent.  Pay on time and keep records. Uphold your end of the agreement.

The minute you miss a payment, she will initiate eviction process.  That's all I'm saying.  There are a lot of other things you can and should do for yourself here. Withholding rent is not one of them."

baltimore,3dvu88,stikkykitty,3,Mon Jul 20 00:10:32 2015 UTC,When someone takes over a pre existing lease they have to abide by that lease until it ends or you sign a new lease stating you agree to the new terms. Also I would suggest you start putting your rent into an escrow account and take them to court. Have receipts for anything you have to fix yourself and have proof your rent is in escrow till you work out a new lease. The fact that your security is compromised is an issue that can get you out of your lease if you so choose. I would start filling court papers asap and stop paying then directly when you go to court and prove your rent is in escrow till the issues are fixed they can not evict you. They can try to take you to court but they cannot evict you with out court first so don't let them hassle you.

This was a strong arm robbery by a guy whom I know, and have went to a party once with, but I (and the people at the bar) only know him via an alias.   He knows that I'm legally blind (macular degeneration in both eyes), and I guess it made me a mark for this, since he knows I have issues identifying people due to the vision.  They were closing the bar up, and he took my phone from my hands, quickly followed by a strike.   I blacked out, so I dont know how long it went on for.

After regaining my composure/yelling at them, I saw that they only had bad attitudes and no weapons so I told them to beat it or they'd be sorry. The girl was especially angry and profane. Once I saw that she was the only one really threatening me, I was able to scare the rest of em off.  I admit I made the mistake of not using the buddy system. But seriously? A pack of pre-teens running around after 10pm around Remington? Where are the parents? The police station is only a few blocks away. I don't often see cops walking the streets, but maybe one on patrol might see a pack of kids and think, ""Hm. This is pretty odd. Those kids shouldn't be out."" Being placed in a defensive situation in which I might critically injure a child is not good for anyone involved.  All in all, I escaped with minor injuries and they didn't get my wallet/phone/keys."

I work directly with Baltimore city youth in the summer and it's an incredible experience getting insight to their lives and giving them real life advice and helping them make good decisions. The future of the black community is the kids and only they can start repairing the culture."
baltimore,3dubl3,alexbaha,3,Sun Jul 19 22:14:31 2015 UTC,I think you're definitely onto something. Lack of positive role models is a huge issue. But doing that is very small scale. You can only impact the lives of a handful of people per year (assuming < 100% of the kids you work with buy in). That's great and should be a cornerstone of the process.   But what can be done that's scaleable? There are millions of impoverished folks in this area. How can we lift a sizable number and break the cycle?

In general I've found NY drivers are more aggressive to pass slower traffic but much better at defensive driving/general awareness of their surroundings. Baltimore drivers block the box, blow red lights, and fail to signal which aren't habits you'll see in NYC, possibly due to better ticket enforcement.  Overall the quality of drivers is much lower here IMO."

You can go online or call and get a one week extension.  Depending on the bill amount and season, it may take 2 or more months for actual cutoff, but they sometimes show up the day after TON expiry.  Also- the big problem with repeated lateness is that if you are late 3 times in one year, they will charge your bill a deposit amount equal to two months service. After being on time 11/12 times, you get it back with a little interest. You can request the deposit be split I to 2 or 3 payments."

baltimore,3ds9mo,aresef,4,Sun Jul 19 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Yes actually. ""Replace what breaks"" is pretty much the policy in place. The city can't afford to overhaul the entire system at once, so they just wait until something breaks, and then replace it.   This is why the ""repairs"" seem to take forever. Because they're not repairs. If the city just wanted to get water flowing again when a main pops they could do that in a day. But since they have to dig up the street anyways, they're using the opportunity to do a good job and replace the whole section."

baltimore,3drh61,BmoreGrrl,11,Sat Jul 18 19:28:11 2015 UTC,It's like they are daring cars to hit them.    I've seen people quite literally beg cars to hit them as they jaywalk.

If you slow down then an endless stream of people will start crossing the street and you get stuck waiting, conversely if you are a pedestrian if you wait for cars to slow down or stop you will never get to cross, so everybody just fucking goes all the time.  I love it.   I moved to DC after living in Baltimore for years and a lot of people thought the way I walked through the city was crazy because I wouldn't wait for lights or crosswalks and would just go whenever I thought I had time to make it.  People also felt that I didn't slow down enough for pedestrians.  I miss driving in Baltimore, its great, all cities are a bit of a free-for-all when you drive, but Baltimore was the most fun by far.  I never saw a single traffic stop the entire time I lived there."

baltimore,3drh61,flannel_smoothie,3,Sat Jul 18 19:19:08 2015 UTC,It's a newer law here so most folks aren't aware of it and pedestrians rarely use crosswalks. My coworkers have made fun of me for always using crosswalks.  There have been types I've been scared to stop at a crosswalk assuming I'd get rear ended. When I moved back to Baltimore from California (where pedestrians don't even bother looking up because crosswalk laws are followed closely) I definitely had to readjust.
baltimore,3drh61,PitBullTherapy,3,Sun Jul 19 01:04:22 2015 UTC,"It's pretty bad. Lots of drivers expect pedestrians to stop for them (or just don't even look) and vise versa. interestingly enough, there's no blanket jay-walking law in MD. You just can't cross at a controlled intersection with the hand signal nor can you ""impede"" a vehicle. Otherwise, it's legal. That being said, if a pedestrian gets hit, and they're not in a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) their chances of winning a lawsuit are slim. Maryland is a contributory negligence state, which means, with some exceptions, that you can't win if your own negligence at all contributed to your injury."

AThough one thing I do admit is the state law there is enforced so they do yield for pedestrians at crosswalks even if the stupid things are placed half a mile up the road away from a damn traffic light. On the flipside this makes the pedestrians and bicyclists in that city take on a whole new air similar to Bmore residents who just vault into the street, but slightly worse"

It's fun and good for Baltimore, but they stay away because it really is meant for more touristy, kitschy kind of souvenir stuff with the occasional tiny side area belonging to a pop-up gallery space that is a fraction of what the gallery scene is like during any other time of the year. The food and drinks are also pretty damn expensive, not in the price range for college kids.

baltimore,3dpp5z,ksweeley,2,Sat Jul 18 06:20:31 2015 UTC,"This is truly unfortunate for the city, but I highly doubt has much to do with the riots. Getting around Baltimore just sucks. Trying to build this place as a 'tourist offshoot' of DC is just pathetic, and after the 2008 economic crash it was obvious that was not going to be a good plan.  What we truly need to be investing in is making this a 'world class' city for people to work and live. But we'll never compete with areas that have proper public transportation, which is a shame."
baltimore,3dpp5z,a-ko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"I also doubt this has to do with the riots as well.  Otakon announced in 2013 that they are departing Baltimore for D.C. simply because they need more exhibition space. I've been attending Otakon since 2001 and more recently with 30,000+ people attending Otakon, the BCC is very very crowded and it's very hard to navigate through the masses of people in the BCC who attends Otakon.  Otakon warned Baltimore City over 5 years ago that they needed more exhibition space but the city apparently didn't care or ignored Otakon's warnings and now it has come around to bite the city in the ass.  I think it could be likely that the Firehouse Expo also might need a larger convention center to exhibit in and that's why they are moving out of Baltimore.  The BCC isn't very large when you compare it to the convention center down in D.C. which is much larger and is the reason why Otakon is moving to the D.C. Convention Center in 2017.  Baltimore will be losing an estimated $30 million in economic impact money with Otakon leaving and downtown retail and food establishments will be losing a lot of annual income from Otakon attendees, hotels will be losing out on business from Otakon attendees because every single downtown hotels have been fully booked on Otakon weekend and now multi-million of dollars will be lost with the Firehouse Expo leaving Baltimore."

The problems we face are much deeper than just locking up bad guys. Simply focusing on yesterday's shooting, while necessary, is short-sighted. True leadership requires an understanding that only a collaborative, thoughtful approach that works to create an educational system for our children to prepare them for life; establishes services and programs that provide assistance to families so they can live healthy, nutritional lives in affordable housing in sustainable neighborhoods; and provides an economic plan that creates jobs not only for the highly educated and entitled, is the only way to root out violent crime. Creating a safe environment for all these things to occur is the first important step."

The plan is to push the traffic from HP up Central and onto 40.  If the city is clever, they might be able to get the Water Taxi stop from Locust Point into Harbor Point to handle a ton of the traffic.

baltimore,3dl0vx,BmoreInterested,2,Fri Jul 17 03:13:30 2015 UTC,"Right now I feel Baltimore's primed for ""progress"", or ""growth"" when you look at selective metrics. As seen in the last released demographic data, millennials and professionals are moving into the city and increasing their numbers, but blacks are fleeing by and large. Baltimore could be in a cumulative ""negative growth"" spiral for years yet even as individual metrics push against it.   The riots and the murder spike don't help these trends. This will cost Baltimore some residents and business but the hope is that these are only short term hits. We'll see.   Most disconcerting of course is that thanks to recent events we're at least four years behind in building out a transit network. Worst case is that Baltimore is four years out from starting another 15 year process for transit development. Hopefully someone in this town can get creative in the interim but this is all conjecture."
baltimore,3dl0vx,stackolee,7,Fri Jul 17 15:43:42 2015 UTC,"I think this article is a good advertisement and says a lot of good things for transplants and middle class folks who are out of college with their degree and are upwardly mobile but it says nothing about the other side of Baltimore   The unemployment rate amount blacks between 18 and 24 in Baltimore City is like 40% and with the way unemployment figures are calculated, it's probably more like 60%.   What happens to these people and their communities? How is Baltimore primed for growth when we have thousands of unemployed people with relatively few skills and relatively few opportunities for work.  So yeah, primed for growth if you are a certain type of person and I'm not mad about that at all, it's just a reality I think"
baltimore,3dl0vx,otherfuckinTerps,4,Fri Jul 17 11:55:28 2015 UTC,"This is a global problem though, a very small percentage of the Earth's population owns the vast majority of it's resources. As time goes on labor becomes the less important factor of production. Capital becomes the only thing that matters. Unless you have a sea change in the way wealth is distributed or legal rights to property are effectuated, those who presently own capital will continue to flourish and those who only have their labor will by and large stagnate.   If only there was a presidential candidate who supported a basic income. . ."
baltimore,3dl0vx,lenoxavegoon,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"You're completely correct. Baltimore city is slowly circling the drain right now. Unemployment in the black community is mind boggling and will only rise as more companies pull out or hire from the counties. A large number of middle class whites are leaving the city every year and taking their tax dollars with them (I might be off by a few percentage points since this is a 2014 stat but only 35% of Baltimore city residents currently pay income tax).  Little by little the unemployment will continue to rise while tax income degrades and crime surges. Less jobs + little hope = crime. Crime near my office building is sky high with 9 armed robberies within 3 blocks of us on the street in the last 2 weeks. That's more than we had last year total.  When I was first hired nearly half of my office lived downtown- now none of them do (they've all moved to the county). People can pretend Baltimore is going to get better but it isn't. We have horrible politicians who are running the city in to the ground, a divided police force, massive unemployment, obscene taxes, a disappearing middle class and we're surrounded by states with cities that are more friendly to companies with lower taxes, a more educated work force and larger population."

Pandora came from Columbia, Exelon is moving their regional HQ to Harbor Point, Amazon built a massive facility, CareFirst bought the Canton Tower and moved a ton of people from Baltimore County, The old Phillips plant is now filled with new companies, Mill #1 came onto the market with a new healthcare company, The incubator spaces around town have been swamped (and keep getting taken over by the ones that make it big), Several EdTech companies moved over the last 2 years from NYC to Baltimore, We've seen high demand for the biotech parks (especially UM), and the Port has been expanding.

There's a reason there's been a huge surge in millennials moving in and it has nothing to do with police, weed, or roads.  It has to do with amazing neighborhoods, tons of stuff to do every minute, great places to eat and drink, and a critical mass of people all motivating each other to do better.  It's sad to hear this sort of viewpoint because it means your opinion of the city is most likely what you see on the news."

The dude is absolutely, obnoxiously aggressive and stands in the middle of the road during green lights causing everyone to swerve. He's going to cause accidents or get run the F over.  Get him off the street."

baltimore,3ditfk,kostic,5,Thu Jul 16 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"""We have a math problem.""  Kevin Lindamood is such a force.  I really admire him.  He's so right.  The B-DAT system is such a joke; resources are too thin on the ground.  People have to be street homeless and at the absolute limit of their health before they're addressed and even then there isn't enough housing to go around.  The response from the mayor's people is so typical.  ""We've listened to you, and we don't have to defend our policy!""  What assholes."
baltimore,3ditfk,yowheez,2,Thu Jul 16 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"This is sad beyond words.  This is one of the richest nations in the world.  This city administration lacks vision, empathy etc - hopefully it will be held accountable at the ballot box."
baltimore,3ditfk,46718,18,Thu Jul 16 18:06:34 2015 UTC,You can't force people to stop using drugs or drinking alcohol or magically cure their underlying mental illnesses or to even get up every day and aspire to do the right thing.
baltimore,3ditfk,spalunk,7,Thu Jul 16 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"But you can house them for less cost to the community.  Housing FIRST!  Addiction, mental health issues, and general well-being are easier (though not easy) to cultivate if a person has the stability that permanent supportive housing provides.  You wouldn't have to force most people, just support them."
baltimore,3ditfk,yowheez,9,Thu Jul 16 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"This still assumes that they want to change their situation. Stability and support might be the missing link for some, but I think a lot of these people are totally content to live in a tent, beg for money, and get drunk/high as much as possible.   ""Here's a shitty little room to live in and a manual labor job that pays 8/hour that you have to go to every single day for 8+ hours"" isn't exactly the best offer in the world."
baltimore,3ditfk,spalunk,4,Thu Jul 16 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"I know this is anecdotal, but I just finished up a year-long stint as a case manager at a community health center as a case manager and, yes, there are people who do not want help, but the vast, vast majority of street homeless and unstably housed people would absolutely jump at the chance to get housed.  And you know what?  The fact that some people don't want help doesn't mean it should be withheld from people who want it.  Frankly, that's a dick thing to think."
baltimore,3ditfk,yowheez,3,Thu Jul 16 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"The government should actively try to hire the homeless to do menial but very necessary jobs in the city. Picking up trash, for example. Somebody's got to do it. And provide a dorm room and food with a small stipend in return for the work. If you are a crappy worker, then you can get kicked out of the program. If you are homeless and want to work, the government should be there to employ you.  The tough problem seems to be dealing with those with psychological problems, who cant work because of said problem. Some folks I see out there, I don't have much hope when it comes to the system curing their mental disorders."
baltimore,3ditfk,TheBrainReigns,3,Thu Jul 16 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"The buildings need case managers to connect people to services in the community and make sure people can be adherent to appointments and therapies.  Housing is a much better platform from which to deal with issues than a tent under an overpass that the city might destroy at-will.  And I'd rather live in a city where people who a truly incapable of caring for themselves have free housing!  It cost Salt Lake City only $11,000 per person to house AND provide services to their homeless population versus $20,000 that it costs to provide services to someone who is street homeless.  The compassionate thing is actually more cost effective."

baltimore,3ditfk,TheBrainReigns,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:57:51 2015 UTC,"I've thought for a long time the city should have a program where you can bring trash and they'll just pay you for it, like per pound or something. Then people who wanted to could earn some money and we'd counter this city's polluting tendencies.  But someone would probably just start breaking people's things so they could steal it and turn it in for trash."
baltimore,3ditfk,CrisisOfConsonant,2,Fri Jul 17 01:54:22 2015 UTC,Wanting and working for are two totally different things.
baltimore,3ditfk,spalunk,5,Thu Jul 16 21:38:56 2015 UTC,well you also have to consider who's going to hire a homeless person? Especially in a down economy where there are many applicants for jobs.
baltimore,3ditfk,TheBrainReigns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:20:42 2015 UTC,"The point is, we shouldn't be getting rid of these encampments when the shelters are full because if we get rid of an encampment they'll just scatter everywhere else."
baltimore,3ditfk,otherfuckinTerps,2,Thu Jul 16 21:11:40 2015 UTC,I actually think the city should actively make areas where its legal to camp there. So many city owned lots. You could actually create a situation where the homeless can potentially become stewards (to some small degree) over certain parcels in the city.
baltimore,3ditfk,TheBrainReigns,5,Thu Jul 16 23:16:22 2015 UTC,"They really couldn't even if they wanted to. Anything like that would infuriate the people who lived around it (and probably tank property values). Any part of the city they put it in would cause people to come out against it. This is a case of ""not in my back yard"". The only places that they might be able to get away with it are in the real ghettos. And the homeless wouldn't live there because they wouldn't be able to generate enough income to eat. And that's cause all kinds of other inequality."

Lots of people show up every month, and every level of board game interest and proficiency is represented. There was even a table playing an RPG at one of the last few. Come by and check it out. You and your friends will not be disappointed.  You can find more info at http://brewsandboardgames.com/ or on their Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/BrewsAndBoardGames.

baltimore,3ddgmi,sometimesiwatchtv,6,Wed Jul 15 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"The massive garage is already built, but not yet open to parking in it yet."
baltimore,3ddgmi,BmoreInterested,9,Wed Jul 15 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Noooooooo!!!!  I'm going to miss cheap ticket Tuesdays.  Glad I saw Jurassic World and Mad Max there.  The next theater will be cool, but expensive!"
baltimore,3ddgmi,BmoreGrrl,14,Wed Jul 15 12:30:35 2015 UTC,The new Cinemark in Towson does $6.50 movies on Tuesdays and parking in their garage is only $2 validated if you're looking for alternatives.
baltimore,3ddgmi,NoFunPat,3,Wed Jul 15 13:01:32 2015 UTC,"I went there a few times on Tuesdays when a movie I wanted to see wasn't shown at The Rotunda...but I get a bit pissy about paying for parking and driving to Towson.  Guess it's now the best deal in town since my favorite theatre is gone.  No worries, it's better than paying full price and the seats are super comfy!"
baltimore,3ddgmi,BmoreGrrl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"The garage across from the Bahama breeze is free and Towson also recently changed the street hours meet the higher demand. Free after 6 in the public lots. Watch out for the private ones though, they look similar and are right next to the public"
baltimore,3ddgmi,otherfuckinTerps,7,Fri Jul 17 13:55:59 2015 UTC,Would have been nice if Alamo was the company moving in here.  Winchester and Ashburn are just to far to drive for a show.
baltimore,3ddgmi,biophazer242,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"They should be everywhere. We can have all sorts of stupid development happening here, why not someone put together $3M or so and import an actually enjoyable moviegoing experience?"
baltimore,3ddgmi,Autumn_Sweater,4,Wed Jul 15 18:31:13 2015 UTC,Sucks. I used to go here all the time. The screens and seats sucked but the tickets were cheap and you could get a soda and popcorn for like 6 bucks. Can't wait to pay 15 for some goat cheese appetizer at the new theater /s
baltimore,3ddgmi,wee_bey,3,Wed Jul 15 15:38:48 2015 UTC,BUT TUESDAY!
baltimore,3ddgmi,yowheez,3,Wed Jul 15 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"Damn.... The best theater going experience I've ever had was when I went to see Inglorious Basterds at the Rotunda by myself when I lived in the neighborhood: It was 4pm on a Wednesday, I was the only person in the theater, and I snuck a flask of rum in to accompany my popcorn and coke.    I've never been so engrossed in a movie as I was that afternoon, it was awesome.  Always loved the Rotunda but that day took it to a whole other level.  Sorry to see them close..."
baltimore,3ddgmi,badgrafxghost,3,Wed Jul 15 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"Bummer, always liked this theater. Also my friends living next door to it helped."
baltimore,3ddgmi,soulexpectation,2,Wed Jul 15 13:00:34 2015 UTC,I thought it was sort of in the plans already to close when Cine Bistro was completed. It seems weird to have two movie theaters in spitting distance of each other.
baltimore,3ddgmi,zim2411,2,Wed Jul 15 14:54:58 2015 UTC,"I remember when they said they were going to put in a pinball arcade! I was so excited. And then no news for a long time. I emailed the owner and he just said that things changed and it was no longer happening. And then shortly after that they announced the Rotunda renovations, so I guess that's what killed the arcade. And now it has officially killed the theater, too! Bummer. I don't expect to be able to afford/want to go to the theater that's being built, either....  As of this morning the sign outside of the Rotunda still says ""open during construction"" so I guess it was very suddenly that they decided to close."

baltimore,3dgf0r,ozymandiane,7,Thu Jul 16 01:51:24 2015 UTC,I took MARC every day for several years.  A bad day on the train still beats the hell out of driving the Beltway.
baltimore,3dgf0r,hymie0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:37:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip. Is there any kind of monthly commuter fee? What I saw was $12 trips.
baltimore,3dgf0r,Marceline_A,3,Thu Jul 16 02:44:25 2015 UTC,"I did this for about a year. Monthly pass from penn to union in DC was $175 when I did it. Significantly cheaper than paying for the $7 one way if you're commuting every day. Keep in mind that the MARC is frequently late or cancelled... I ended up finding another job because I couldn't do the commute anymore, but I think I depends on how close you'll be living to Penn and how close work is to Union!"
baltimore,3dgf0r,hymie0,2,Thu Jul 16 04:28:32 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the question.  You can buy a monthly MARC pass, or a ""Transit Link"" that is a monthly MARC/Metro pass.  I don't know what a ""monthly commuter fee"" is, and I don't know what ""$12 trips"" are.  I didn't go through Penn Station, so if it's something specific to Penn Station, I don't know."
baltimore,3dgf0r,lrcolvin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:48:16 2015 UTC,I guess I meant like a monthly fare card for commuters. When I looked up pricing it said a trip from Penn to Union was $12.
baltimore,3dgf0r,earlsmm,6,Thu Jul 16 02:57:25 2015 UTC,Penn to Union station is $8 not $12. The weekly pass is $60 and the monthly pass is $216.00.
baltimore,3dgf0r,bobcat7781,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:49:51 2015 UTC,One of the added perks of the monthly pass is that it is also good on the Baltimore Light Rail and Subway as well as MTA buses and WMATA Metro buses
baltimore,3dgf0r,openmyth,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:11 2015 UTC,"I don't use it on a regular basis (or recently) so I can't cite prices, but they do have weekly and monthly tickets at reduced rates."
baltimore,3dgf0r,darcerin,2,Thu Jul 16 02:49:39 2015 UTC,$216 for commuter train or $327 for TLC with unlimited metro rides.
baltimore,3dgf0r,darcerin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:10:15 2015 UTC,See if your job also gives you commuting incentives. I get about $100 from mine to cover commuting costs.
baltimore,3dgf0r,amisure,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"I commute from Annapolis, and I listen to the traffic report every morning. I feel for you - every morning there is an issue on the Beltway! Our commute hasn't been bad on 50 lately, but that's only because it's summer. Once school starts up again, the stupidity on the roads starts. Ugh."
baltimore,3dgf0r,BmoreInterested,7,Mon Jul 20 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"I've been commuting to DC from Baltimore for the past few months and haven't had any major issues. The MARC train is pretty reliable, the longest delay I experienced was about an hour and that was only once.  I would suggest signing up for Guaranteed Ride Home, which is a free car service you can use up to four times a year IIRC in case something extreme happens with the train, you miss the last train or you get stranded somewhere.   Another trick to remember is that if you buy a monthly ticket you can use that ticket for comparable stops on the different lines (i.e., Penn, Camden, etc). So if there's an issue with the Penn Line but the Camden Line is fine you can at least get to Camden Yards and then take the light rail or bus from there instead of having to wait in DC."
baltimore,3dgf0r,bohmore,3,Thu Jul 16 02:47:15 2015 UTC,"Pro-tip:  Amazon has unlimited kindle books for $10 a month.  If you're a reader, it makes the trip down a breeze.  I go from Penn a few weeks a year, and haven't had any issues.  It's also nice to return on the Camden line for games.  All-in-all, you'll save money (doubly so if you can ditch a car), live in a vibrant and diverse neighborhood and city, and probably have a better life overall.  There's also something wonderful about Penn Station around the holidays."
baltimore,3dgf0r,BmoreGrrl,3,Thu Jul 16 03:26:12 2015 UTC,"What is it about train stations & airports around the holidays? Maybe I watched Planes, Trains & Automobiles too many times but I love them too."
baltimore,3dgf0r,me_elmo,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:48 2015 UTC,People do it all the time.  I say join the masses!
baltimore,3dgf0r,aresef,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:14:15 2015 UTC,"I've been using the MARC train for 26 years. I catch it at Odenton on the Penn Line, or sometimes I catch it at Savage on the Camden line. You can relax, eat, read a book, snooze, it's great. Driving used to stress the heck out of me. Backups would be to drive to Greenbelt to catch the Green line on the DC metro. The express trains from Penn Station are the fastest, and I think it's worth the money. If your employer allows you to take a transit subsidy, that saves you money in taxes too.  trains are sometimes delayed, but less often than the massive backups on I95, the BW Parkway, or the DC Beltway."
baltimore,3dggk2,MazelTough,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:23 2015 UTC,"You can find these for even cheaper through local auction liquidators.  I used to sell ones previously owned by DC Government for $100 regularly.  Edit:  Check out Govdeals.com if you're interested.

baltimore,3dggk2,messenger_shitlord,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:13:43 2015 UTC,"The ink in non oem cartridges is $10 each cartridge, oem print heads are $50 each. That's $350 for print heads assuming the ones in the printer are bad and $70 for ink plus shipping. 7# paper 150 feet by 24"" for $25."

The neighborhood is nice now, if a little rough around the edges, but there's lots of community buy-in (joining the neighborhood assoc., street and alley clean-ups, cultural festivals).  The corner places are a little pricier.  It's the 3 story places with parking, new kitchens, a 2-tiered roof top decks, etc that are getting up there.  They're all on Baltimore."

Thousands of children are out until late at night (11pm) just screaming and playing. Kids constantly hang out on our stoop and knock into the door somehow freaking the dogs out. There's trash everywhere even just after sweeping and plenty of rats in the alley. Also both of our cars have gotten pretty banged up and scraped in the last year. Still, no muggings or break-ins and the house is really nice inside. And again, our neighbors are awesome."

ESPECIALLY HENDERSON WEBB ... suck major ass. seriously. please. take this advise if nothing else. the reason steeplechase doenst get the robberies and stuff is because its so well lit and out of the way for the crappy apartment people (rossbrooke mainly - do not fucking live here) which is up the road further. they are lazy and would rather break into cars nearby then come down the road a quarter mile to steeplechase.   xo"

Towson bar scene is all underage college kids getting plastered, which isn't exactly ideal in my mind. Because Hampden is away from Towson University but still in a college town, the bars there are usually pretty bustling, but with a much more appropriate crowd. Plus it's on 15 minutes south of Towson."
baltimore,3ddg71,Mysecretpassphrase,8,Wed Jul 15 12:59:06 2015 UTC,"Not totally true. I live in West Towson, and the bars I frequent are full of people like me. (49, upper middle class). You find the bars with the people you feel comfortable.  OP: you won't want to live in Hunt Valley unless you're renting a room, bc $$. Hamden is a good choice for a good social scene for young people. As for cycling - we have great roads just north of the city - and Twenty20 bike shop is in Hamden and has lots of good group rides from their shop. Joe's Bike Shop is just up the road in Mt. Washington. Both great shops. If you're a mountain bike rider, Loch Raven and Patapsco Valley State Park have awesome trails. I race MTB and occasionally road bikes. Look me up when you get here if you want to learn the trails. Join the Baltimore Bicycling Club (BBC)- well worth it. If you're a bit more competitive minded, join the Kelly Benefits cycling club. I've ridden for them as well as the BBC.  Welcome to Baltimore. Stay away from any area with blue flashing lights on the tops of street lights."
baltimore,3ddg71,CaptInsane,2,Wed Jul 15 16:00:48 2015 UTC,"West Towson is worlds apart from (not West) Towson, though. And it's super expensive. East-most Towson near Parkville doesn't seem as collegey, but I don't hit bars anymore"
baltimore,3ddg71,Mysecretpassphrase,5,Wed Jul 15 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"There are no bars in West Towson - its is all zoned residential.

baltimore,3ddg71,timmytroll,3,Thu Jul 16 12:47:12 2015 UTC,I'll also suggest Hampden and Mt Vernon. Mt washington is cool too but has less of a scene. Fells point to Hunt Valley is prob 25 min during rush hours too as you'd be going against traffic both ways. Definitely avoid Towson unless you're idea of a 'bar and restaurant scene' is chasing shots of fireball with natty light while hanging out with 19 year olds.
baltimore,3ddg71,timmytroll,3,Wed Jul 15 15:48:35 2015 UTC,Mt Washington is a great area. I would definitely recommend it but stay away from Willowbrook. I currently live there and the maintenance there is pretty awful. Hampden isn't too much further south and pretty great too. The commute from there is about 15-20 minutes depending on when you leave in the morning. (I work in Hunt Valley also) Good luck on your search and congrats on the job.
baltimore,3ddg71,nfw22,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So other than the Willowbrook specifically being a bad apt, you like the area? There are a few other places around there that I think I want to look at."
baltimore,3ddg71,TYsir,2,Thu Jul 16 18:15:21 2015 UTC,Yes it's a great area. Close to everything. You can go north to Towson and Hunt Valley in 15-20 minutes or south to downtown in the same amount of time. I have a friend who lives in the Belvedere Towers that absolutely loves it. It's a bit more pricey though.
baltimore,3ddg71,schlossenberger,3,Thu Jul 16 18:54:05 2015 UTC,"These all seem like good places that would fit your budget. As far as landlords to avoid; Alex Fagella.

baltimore,3ddg71,monsda,6,Thu Jul 16 12:52:21 2015 UTC,"For all that youre looking for I think Towson would be a great choice, it has turned into more of a college town but it is fairly quiet when the students are gone.  there are a number of chain and local bars downtown, Robert E lee park and loch raven reservoir are both very near by great for biking. The Towson mall has really anything you could be looking for  The Falls Road lightrail station is actually right next to Robert E Lee (I live nearby) I use it all the time to get to orioles/ravens games and into the city, it may be less expensive to live in Lutherville/Timonium and youll still have access to the lightrail which is a $3 trip it runs from the hunt valley mall down to Camden yards and to BWI if need be"
baltimore,3ddg71,k47su,2,Wed Jul 15 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the job!  Mays Chapel would be a nice place to start looking.  I've been working in Hunt Valley for the past 4 years.  Lived off Warren Road for a year in an apartment I wouldn't recommend to anyone, now I live in PA and commute 45 minutes which I wouldn't recommend either lol.  I'd say stay away from anywhere the bus stops extend to.  Mays Chapel is as nice as it is because the bus stops don't go up there.  Head down Warren Road or Cranbrook there are a TON of cheap apartments but they're mostly section 8.  For your $1,200 budget you should be able to get a 1-2 bedroom apartment in Mays Chapel or somewhere just as nice."
baltimore,3ddg71,BmoreGrrl,2,Wed Jul 15 15:07:46 2015 UTC,I know a guy who lives near me in Ednor Gardens.  He works up in Hunt Valley and zips to work in ~25 minutes.  Heading north on I-83 in the morning is smooth sailing unless there's an accident.
baltimore,3ddg71,Hazcat3,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"Are you open to roommates? A lot of Baltimore housing is rowhomes. Some of the big rowhomes have been subdivided in to apartments, if you do want a 1 bedroom. There are also apartment buildings around, but I'm not as familiar with those.  Like others have said, Hampden would be a great neighborhood, and fit all of your criteria perfectly. Hampden itself is very hip, with lots of new and unique restaurants, it's by the light rail, for easy public transit access to the city.  And like one poster said, avoid Towson. Towson is a mix of college kids and suburban families. There are hardly any people in their mid 20s to 30s. I lived there from like 24-26 and am much happier living in Canton."
baltimore,3ddg71,imthewalrus610,2,Wed Jul 15 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"I live in the Bel Air area, which is about 25 min of back roads to the Hunt Valley area. It has a good bar scene, more rural, lots of rental options both through complexes and private. A little More upscale of an area and safer then some areas of the city."
baltimore,3ddg71,imthewalrus610,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:04 2015 UTC,29 years old....how about Mt. Vernon?  You can walk to Penn Station light rail for work and still have a city life.  Many apartments in the area have high reviews and are within your budget.
baltimore,3ddg71,baltimel,2,Thu Jul 16 02:18:44 2015 UTC,Woodberry is west of Hampden but closer to the light rail stop that would take you to Hunt Valley. Cool reclaimed factory for apartments there (or maybe condos). Also a place on Union Ave. A minute walk to the light rail for work and 10 minute walk to the Avenue in Hampden to go out. Easy access to Druid Hill Park for biking.
baltimore,3ddg71,BmoreInterested,2,Thu Jul 16 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"I work in Hunt Valley, and for a little while I had an apartment in Bonnie Ridge Apartments in Mt. Washington.

baltimore,3ddg71,art_comma_yeah_right,2,Thu Jul 16 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of my complaints are probably similar for other places.  One time, when they had a fire alarm go off, a maintenance guy just came into my apartment in the middle of the night.  I was upset, because he wasn't with the authorities, and the manager told me maintenance could get here faster than the police or fire department, which was BS.  That was a one time thing.  Nothing really broke.  It wasn't particularly fancy or fashionable, but I didn't mind.  Just wanted a decent safe place to live, and I would say Bonnie Ridge qualifies.  I looked at other places in Mt Washington and I settled on this one, and I think it was a solid decision in hindsight."
baltimore,3ddg71,ViolentEastCoastCity,2,Fri Jul 17 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"In order from best to ok choice: Hampden, Mt. Washington, Charles Village, Towson. Or, you could suck up the commute and live in Canton. I used to live there and commute to Timonium. it's not too bad as long as you find a good way to get to 83. I took Fayette."
baltimore,3ddg71,jpw111082,2,Fri Jul 17 12:03:06 2015 UTC,"So Mount Washington is a pretty cool area to live in, but I'd try to get an apartment that isn't in a complex.  I'll admit that's my personal preference, but some of those complexes built in the 60s-80s feel run down.  Obviously places like craigslist will help you on that.  Other neighborhoods to consider would be Hampden/Woodberry/Wyman Park (1 more exit down 83).    Also check out the Jones Falls Trail through Clyburn Arboretum (very pretty, but can be a bit short of a ride inside) and down through Druid Hill Park for good biking."
baltimore,3ddg71,CaptInsane,3,Wed Jul 15 12:28:04 2015 UTC,"Hunt Valley itself is pretty nice, and also Cockeysville nearby. I being in Cockeysville, a real commuter type of town.   Also, the NCR or North Central Railroad Trail is there, which is a pretty nice bicycle trail."
baltimore,3ddg71,cassbria,3,Wed Jul 15 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as a city resident I'd recommend Hunt Valley itself if it's an option (no idea what rent or apt. availability is like). Here's a pic of the NCR trail. It goes forever, it's gorgeous, scenery varies, etc. And if you can spare yourself the commute from elsewhere you'll thank yourself. There are only 2 or 3 ways to get there from further south (I-83, York Rd. and Dulaney Valley Rd. - all of which can be jammed during rush hours). Plus there are tons of bars on the York Road strip between Towson and Hunt Valley."
baltimore,3ddg71,CaptInsane,4,Wed Jul 15 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"I'm from Cockeysville growing up, and it's a very nice place to live if you have a family. Cockeysville and Hunt Valley share a zip code, so it's basically the same place. Hunt Valley is a pretty wealthy area. There are a couple small bars up there that are fun, like Koopers, Padonia ""Ale House"" Station, Hightopps, the Still, Ryleighs, etc. Just be mindful of the apartments you look at in the area; many are section 8 and have, over the years, brought in some less-than-desireables. There are some apartments out in North Ridge and Mays Chapel that are pretty nice, depending on your price range (these are about $1000-$1200). I went to party in the North Ridge apartments once; they are really nice inside, spacious. Close to hunt valley. 20 min from downtown."
baltimore,3ddg71,jkeyser14,2,Wed Jul 15 13:28:40 2015 UTC,You could look into Mt.Vernon as well. It has plenty of nightlife and everything is walkable. You also have easy access to 83 for your commute to work.
baltimore,3ddg71,otherfuckinTerps,2,Wed Jul 15 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"Do you want an apartment or condo? I think for a lease you could find either in that range for the size you're looking for. Towson is a great area and covers a pretty wide range of place (mid to high-end). Stay away from the circle: the new apartments there are super expensive and full of college kids. There are some nice condos on Goucher less than a mile up from the mall. Also, keep away from the Loch Raven apartmnts; the Village is nice (I live near there) but the apartments on the other side of Loch Raven Blvd are super shady.  Lutherville area is great, but some of the apartments I've seen are pretty rundown/outdated. The closer you get to Hunt Valley the more expensive it'll be so Cockeysville will be at the higher end of price"
baltimore,3ddg71,Fearless11,3,Wed Jul 15 12:55:04 2015 UTC,"I live in the Towson complex that's probably the closest to the circle - definitely no problem with college kids here (I'm guessing due to the price), but I wouldn't recommend it due to traffic issues!

With the internet age this is quite possibly the most useless (yet highly paid) jobs in any company.  And typically they know nothing about the departments they are hiring for and choose terrible candidates to bring to managers anyways.   The department said in a statement that it was making the move to ""overhaul and streamline"" its operations and to address ""long-standing issues"" in human resources.""  They said the current structure — with human resources workers at each facility — creates ""duplication of services, overlap, communication problems, and disincentives to any economies of scale."""
baltimore,3de0s2,yesitsmeitsok,2,Wed Jul 15 15:35:22 2015 UTC,What does the internet age have to do with such a face-to-face job?
baltimore,3de0s2,GFfoundmyusername,8,Wed Jul 15 15:54:33 2015 UTC,Most of it can be done using the internet or software. No need to read resumes or process candidates when there are hr systems that do exactly that. You can even probabaly have the system schedule a call back and send an email with the details. Hell why do you even need face to face. Let the manager choose the candidate from the list of names and the system automates and schedules the interview.  That's probabaly a few jobs there eliminated.
baltimore,3de0s2,GFfoundmyusername,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"HR systems work (most often badly), but they require reps to actually use them.  Besides that, who determines the need for hiring, submits the job requirements, posts the job, attends career fairs where we get a lot of state workers, and that's not even going into issue resolution, benefits coordination, etc.  I don't think I'd mind if he was just getting rid of vacancies, but I dislike seeing one state agency after another laying off workers.  A few hundred so far..."
baltimore,3de0s2,KLynch10,4,Wed Jul 15 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"In my org the hiring is determined by budget and a decision from the director and manager. The job requirements were written some time ago using a hr consulting company. The rest is taken care of by the system. Manager post a job requesition, submits it to the hr sysyem, job is then posted to the web, then applicants flow in. The manager does the interviews and hr handles the on boarding with paper work and answers any questions you may have that are found in the handbook or on the hr system's site. Unless it's a new position, then the consulting company is called. But that rarely happens.   Job fairs are a place I suppose you can use an hr rep. But we can do better. You can have the intern hand out pamphlets, answer questions and point them to a computer where they fill out an application. It's not ideal but we're not too far off from that. Let's be honest no company is searching for ceos at job fairs.   It also depends of the job and the size of the company as well. But in this age you really don't require a large number of people to do HR related things."

What absurd rules, due process and having the employer find a valid reason to fire someone? This is especially important in a state such as Maryland which is at-will, meaning your employer can fire you for any reason whatsoever with extremely little recourse available to the worker. An employer would be free to fire people for made-up issues and simply replace them with their own sycophants which is especially troubling when the employer is a public entity.  It's something they negotiated for and the employer agreed to it. The government doesn't need to create any additional laws to enforce or change contracts.

There's honestly just as much correlation between ""ability to concealed carry"" with ""Violent Crime"" in that data set as there is ""areas where population density is lower"".  From the same data, you can say that being close to the Mexican border significantly reduces murder rate than living further away from it. (San Diego's murder rate per 100,000).  You could also say that concealed carry living in El Paso, Texas increases your chance of getting raped versus living in a tightly gun-controlled area such as New York City.  And Burglaries per 100,000 in NYC is lower than anywhere else in that list. Yet it has some of the toughest gun control legislation in the country. So you're less likely to get your house broken into in NYC and not owning a gun than living in Texas and owning a gun. But you could also correlate this information to the amount of apartment buildings that have security guards and badge ID systems in that area versus Texas, as well.  The realities of trying to extrapolate any meaningful information from murder rates and such unless you're looking at pure, raw 'chance' of a specific subgroup is meaningless.  There are so many incredible variables at play, even down to the simple 'culture' of the people in the cities themselves."

baltimore,3df9jl,elcad,4,Wed Jul 15 23:53:14 2015 UTC,"To me, the conversation on concealed carry and gun ownership is a separate conversation to safety of one's personal self in a given area.  It sure would make these people feel safer; but at the same token they only feel this way because they are scared. And scared creatures, whether people or animal; make irrational decisions.  It's the same reason that I don't do crazy rock climbing. I'm scared of heights. That very fear would likely cause me to misjudge movements and fall. Someone who isn't afraid of heights has a significantly better chance.  What I'm hoping to prove by linking to the data is that gun ownership and carry laws do not correlate nor cause a particular area to be safer. It was an added bonus that this particular chart had a variety of crime types, as one of the most argued points when you bring up places like the UK is that murders may be down, but violent crime is up [as a direct result of people not being able to own guns].  When you shoot down that argument, another argument comes up that ""well, these areas are far more homogenous than the US so clearly they won't be as violent."" As if somehow different races cause crime. You know what causes crime? Systematic, piss poor treatment of minorities and other unfortunate people.  Amusingly, Los Angeles is more homogenous (whites) than London (http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06037.html , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_London#Ethnicity). And New York City, a reasonably safe city according to the above rates, is less homogenous than both (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City#Demographic_profile)."
baltimore,3df9jl,a-ko,2,Thu Jul 16 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately these folks won't look at raw data. The raw data completely disproves any notion of overall statistical safety by their warped views.  What we don't have is good raw data on gun ownership, which is truly unfortunate. I'd love to see the following data breakdown:   What's the average longevity of a particular gun being owned by a person? How many people purchased guns through private sales? How often were guns stolen from inside a home? What's the accidental misfire rate? What's the accidental misfire rate that causes serious injury or death? How many legally owned guns are used in crimes?   Among other things such as being able to trace guns back to the original owner and cite them for negligence if their guns are used in a crime. If you illegally sold your weapon, allowed someone else to 'borrow' it, if you didn't keep it within a reasonably protected area, and when it goes missing you've appropriately reported it as such to the police.  All of this data would be pretty critically important, yet gun advocates feel very strongly about these issues.  For the record, I don't mind guns as an object. But the rabid ""DAMN GUBMINT CAN'T TAKE MUH GUNS!"" attitude REALLY puts me off to a lot of folks and that community. So I don't get that involved. I'll shoot, buy, keep for myself, admire the weapons for their mechanical and technological beauty; and stay far, far, far away from the crazy fucks who think the US government has bugged everything in their house."

Think of the girl who got her head bashed in while running on Eastern Ave.  As Americans we have the right to defend ourselves and a firearm is often the best means of defense.  Now I do think Shall Issue CCW would help lower crime rates in other parts of the state.  Criminals who know their potential victim could be armed might think twice before attacking them.   Shall Issue CCW is the norm in America and it only a matter of time before MD Law will have to accept it.

Look at homicide rates in the 90's in Baltimore compared to the past decade. Aside from a few spikes here and there homicides have been on a downward spiral. This is also the trend for the country as a whole.   Maybe concealed carry, or open carry would lower homicides or maybe they would increase them, or maybe road rage yelling matches would turn into homicides, or maybe a bar fight ends with a bullet to the back. There are a ton of variable but based on humans and our nature to get angry with each other (especially in confined areas like cities) I am partial to less guns in public overall."

If people knew that I was using weaponized leprosy, I think I would be safest.  Sure there could be an accident, but that is just the risk that everyone must deal with so I feel safe.  And when I really think about it, the best defense is a suprise offense.  I'm pretty sure you agree there is some sort of line in what arms people many have.  Why should anyone agree to your imaginary line over their own?    So why does not the UK count?  I've been to all the places you listed and the UK, and Texas was way more alien then the UK.    People here shot up the streets and shot at people they know have guns all the time.  That is what most of the murders here are.  I don't see how adding fuel to the fire is supposed to help.

baltimore,3df9jl,art_comma_yeah_right,5,Wed Jul 15 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"It does seem like the only reason responsible people can't carry in Baltimore is because of all the irresponsible thugs who illegally do carry (and ""can't"" is too absolute, but suffice it to say it's not an easy permit to attain). Which is horrendously unfair. But I doubt more responsible carriers would have much of an impact on the bulk of gun violence, which seems to occur between conspirators of illicit activity, for the most part. Aside from the occasional innocent bystander, a lot of these victims seem to be willingly engaged in situations where getting shot is a heightened possibility. Those people aren't likely to go the legal route (if they're too paranoid to fill out the census, I doubt they'll submit to background checks and live scan fingerprinting), and more firearms in those situations will only yield higher body counts rather than assailants backing down for fear of getting shot defensively. If most violent crime victims were Stephen Pitcairns, I'd say yes. But that's clearly not the case, and more weaponry for people so constantly predisposed to violence is probably not the answer to diminishing that violence."
baltimore,3df9jl,otherfuckinTerps,4,Wed Jul 15 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think the violence would go down in Baltimore because most of that is systemic. If you are a law abiding citizen, you will likely not get messed with in the city aside from the typical mugging or theft or stray bullet that we see in every major city. A carry permit won't change that type of crime. The people who are commiting these acts of violence likely wouldn't qualify for a permit anyway and the people they are killing wouldn't qualify for them either so a permit wouldn't do shit.   However, the people who live in the city have a right to defend themselves and the ones who want to and want to be legal about it are fucked because they can't carry. Honestly, I'm a fan of open carry and that goes against all of my other progressive leanings.   Maryland should switch to shall issue and cut back on the weapons bans. Hogan won't do that though."

baltimore,3d9qvg,ATRIOHEAD,3,Wed Jul 15 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Here's some detail about the city owned garages, from a Baltimore Sun editorial last year:     What Mayor Rawlings-Blake is proposing is quite different. For starters, it amounts to swapping one city-owned asset for which there is a viable private market, parking garages, for another asset for which the private sector is not well suited, recreation centers. (The Rawlings-Blake administration, during recession-induced rounds of budget cutting, touted privatization as an answer for the city's aging recreation facilities as well, but the feasibility of such a scheme has proved limited.) The city envisions a deal that would net as much as $60 million in profit and would retire the $24 million in debt owed on those four facilities, which would itself free up money for maintenance on other garages or construction of new parking in other neighborhoods. As for the fact that the city would be giving up revenue-producing assets, the finance department estimates the loss would net out to about $728,000 a year after factoring in reduced maintenance costs and the return of the garages to the property tax rolls.  And in contrast to other cities, the mayor's plan doesn't affect street parking or garages outside of downtown. She is talking about selling four garages used primarily by tourists and office workers that account for about 3,000 of the 49,000 spaces in public and private garages and surface lots within a mile of the Light-Pratt intersection. Rather than creating an effective monopoly on public parking, as some privatization plans do, this one would leave significant competition in place, which should limit the extent to which it would affect prices even without legislative controls on parking rates.  But therein also lies a potential pitfall for the proposal. If the market limits the possibility of rate increases, and the garages are already well run, as the city insists, why would private operators pay anything like the $84 million the city expects them to fetch? The four garages currently generate a profit, though city officials could not immediately say how much. Would such a deal to pay off for investors without a fundamental change in the garages' economics? They are already privately operated and have already made the shift from cashiers to automated payment technology, which means a new owner would not be taking over for some bloated government bureaucracy. A private owner would not be able to finance capital improvements through tax-exempt bonds, as the city can, meaning long-term maintenance costs could be higher. And a private entity would have to pay property tax, which the city does not.  That said, Baltimore has every reason to explore a deal. If the city can really get as much for these garages as the Rawlings-Blake administration thinks, it would likely be a good deal. But City Council members need to stop focusing on the visions of rec centers dancing in their heads and instead prepare themselves to apply diligent scrutiny to the mayor's proposal, once it is introduced as formal legislation, to make sure that taxpayers' interests are protected and that we don't wind up selling simply for the sake of selling."

Exactly, if the garage revenue is only 728k a year, how do they think they can sell for 84MM? 115 times the garages yearly revenue?"
baltimore,3d9qvg,Biggie313,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:19:49 2015 UTC,Edit: I think they are saying that they are going to get huge tax income streams to help make up the lost revenue.  So that 728K = Lost Revenue - (Tax Income + Maintenance.)  So lost revenue is probably north of $1M (maybe as high as 2M?)
baltimore,3d9qvg,Joker1337,3,Tue Jul 14 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"Still, even if the revenue was 2M a year, they are still expecting to sell for way too high. Who would invest in a business that will take 42 years to start making money."

I took a look around for you but didn't see you, so I can tell you now what I would have told you then had I seen you: it's a public nuisance and you're rude to fly it around in a busy public place. The pesky noise alone should be enough to consider whether the benefit to you is worth the cost to everyone else who's trying to enjoy the park. But moreover, it's inherently heinous to operate a surveillance tool in a public place. Yes, I know that it's legal, but to even create the appearance of performing public surveillance is a violation of social norms and makes people uncomfortable. To fly drones in a public place is selfish. Ultimately it isn't a huge issue, but because flying the drone gives a small benefit to you alone at a small cost to many people around you, you should seriously consider doing so in more secluded settings where you're not creating such disproportionate disruption and discomfort."

For decades Baltimore County fought tooth and nail to keep blacks out. Executive Dale Anderson flatly refused to build federally-mandated subsidized housing in the 60's and 70's which played a role in concentrating poverty in the city (this is recounted in Not In My Neighborhood).   In the nineties, for whatever reason, that fierce opposition crumbled, and African Americans began a westward migration out of the city. Crucially they largely left the crime behind. The rates of crime in these newly African American areas are far lower than the city."

The dividing lines between census tracts of different racial compositions also don't seem as severe as being on one side of a block or the other.  You're right, race is often a proxy for socioeconomic class.  Housing segregation policies are less prevalent today than 50-70 years ago, but I found the map sobering because of how little progress we seem to have made in desegregating neighborhoods by bridging the gap in economic opportunities among racial groups."

baltimore,3d4hx2,finsterallen,16,Mon Jul 13 13:29:13 2015 UTC,"Pasting this here:   The Mayor’s task force on smart cities has released a draft report that includes discussion on broadband and they have requested public comment by July 19. You can link to that report at http://baltimorebroadband.org/  We need you to write to your elected officials emphasizing the importance of this issue.  Here are suggested talking points:  Fast broadband is now essential like other utilities such as electricity and water  Broadband is broken in Baltimore  ·       This interferes with economic development, modern education and public safety ·       20-40% of city residents do not connect to the Internet resulting in economic injustice ·       Baltimore Broadband Coalition survey shows broad dissatisfaction by city residents in their choices Elected officials must get involved with this important issue. What is critical now is moving from words to effective actions  An entity should be established to lead the city’s effort. This can be city government itself but would more appropriately be a non-profit organization recognized, supported and facilitated by the city.  ·       There must be effective leadership, delineation of entity scope and adequate funding ·       Entity will lead city effort to deploy fiber optic infrastructure and oversee fiber network operations Create a balanced broadband plan.  All must benefit.  ·       Initially target our schools and libraries and areas of concentrated aggregate demand for broadband as identified by the Baltimore Broadband Coalition ·       Provide low cost connectivity options for those with low incomes ·       Create free Wi-Fi zones in public spaces such as within parks or areas of large public gathering and around schools and libraries ·       Offer commercial stakeholders and anchor institutions connectivity options superior to existing choices Work towards an open fiber infrastructure promoting competition among Internet service providers  Understand that deployment of fiber requires public and private investment. Fiber deployment like other infrastructure is expensive but is necessary and economically wise.   You can access the email and mail addresses for the City Council at http://www.baltimorecitycouncil.com/members.htm  You may contact the Mayor at mayor@baltimorecity.gov or through http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/OfficeoftheMayor/MayoralOffices.aspx  Please copy baltimorebroadband@gmail.com on your submissions.

baltimore,3d4hx2,maxgreen,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:58 2015 UTC,"This is what the city needs. Low cost, high speeds, breaking down barriers to education and access to information, and drawing more tech start ups into the city. We need to get rid of the monopoly and have fiber in every home, on every block.   Little known fact: The current cost of installing a ""blue light camera"" on a street corner is approximately $60,000. Why? Primarily because they require high speed fiber networks to function properly. Without existing infrastructure, the city has to build out from existing fiber networks utilized for cameras. Without fiber throughout the city, the ""dream"" (or campaign promise) of cameras on every corner cannot be realized. I'm not necessarily for mass surveillance in the city, but I do believe that we need more cameras as both a deterrent and tool to catch criminals."

The same year WiMAX was introduced in Baltimore, Network World was already warning the technology was in trouble. By 2011, the magazine had officially declared WiMAX dead."

baltimore,3d4hx2,nattybones,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:40:00 2015 UTC,I did some more googling and apparently its getting/is shut down this year.  The real question is how much money in tax breaks / direct funds did Baltimore give Clear(Sprint) to install all the towers?
baltimore,3d4hx2,Timey_Wimey_TARDIS,2,Mon Jul 13 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"At the time, Clear was independent but partially owned by Sprint, but was an indep. company trading under the abbreviation CLWR. I'm Waaay more interested in the blatant strange relationship between Sheila Dixon and Comcast, just before the last contract was awarded."
baltimore,3d4hx2,a-ko,2,Mon Jul 13 18:12:08 2015 UTC,"I had a Clear modem for almost two years and it worked fine, if a bit slow relative to a hardwired connection. The problem was the lack of a 4G standard at the time. WiMax was up against LTE. Like all other standards wars (VHS x Betamax, Blu-Ray v. HD DVD) one technology won out, the other consigned to the dustbin. The same problems don't apply to fiber or Wi-Fi, so with enough support they could make a big difference."
baltimore,3d4hx2,a-ko,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:15 2015 UTC,I'm frankly surprised the issue is being addressed at all since Comcast has a monopoly sanctioned by the City. Comcast must have decided to pay them less.
baltimore,3d4hx2,a-ko,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"I fail to see any issues that aren't in existence almost anywhere else. It has taken a ton of effort and time for any municipal service anywhere in the US to take off. And there hasn't been proven economic development anywhere related to high speed internet.  For example, Chattanooga, TN has had Gigabit fiber services to every resident for < $100/month for years. Longer than any Google Fiber deployment. Yet every business around there continues to spring up in places like Huntsville.  On that token, it'd be hard to convince anyone that municipal service quantitatively helps local business."
baltimore,3d4av4,MDPolitics,13,Mon Jul 13 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"Hogan ran on a platform of tax cuts and state highway expansion.  His views on public transportation are basically ""let's consider more buses.""  How is anyone surprised at his actions now?  My biggest surprise is that he didn't kill the Purple line too.  If the people of Baltimore thought that Hogan was going to do anything to bolster their ailing city, they were delusional at best.  To be fair, I have doubts that Brown would have given the go ahead on the Red line."
baltimore,3d4av4,animeguru,12,Mon Jul 13 13:06:35 2015 UTC,the people of baltimore weren't the people that voted Hogan in. The state did as a whole. I haven't seen the individual numbers but i doubt the city voted for Hogan
baltimore,3d4av4,zaviex,13,Mon Jul 13 13:18:22 2015 UTC,"Baltimore supported Brown; Hogan got about 25% of the vote in the city.  Interestingly, Baltimore had the lowest voter turnout in the entire state.  My post was more about the article itself... ""Hogan risks losing ground in Baltimore..."" as if he cares at all given that the rest of the state is in his pocket.  If SRB and the people of Baltimore want to cry foul, Hogan isn't going to care in the least.  It certainly isn't going to sway him from his course of letting the city bleed out."
baltimore,3d4av4,animeguru,3,Mon Jul 13 13:25:26 2015 UTC,I mean thats not very interesting. I would venture Baltimore always has the lowest voter turnout in the state

My firm will be present as well. EDIT:  I would also like to note that there are strict rules about the internship course.  I believe the internship has to be somewhere which has at least three full time employees doing non-administrative work, so working for a one or two CPA business may not be sufficient.

The Nexus 6 is a lovely simplistic phone without any carrier bloatware which is nice and it is unlocked. Even if you aren't happy with the service, you can still use the phone on any service. I've had great service so far, and love the fact at home if I need to make a call I can turn off data and use Wi-Fi. Due note though: you can airplane mode on and wifi only, but you can only make calls, not receive them. The speeds should be fast enough for what you intend to use them for. I payed for 6 gbs now, and I'm about a little over 1 with 24 days left. I keep a couple podcasts and music local to reduce data usage and turned off background data. I think if you could adjust to having some stuff local and would like to proactively reduce your data, I'd so go for it. But if you like your unlimited data and use more than 6 gbs of data each month, keep sprint. It is definitely a transition from using data freely to watching what I use.

You seem like a great parent.   That being said, I think the problem you'll face is finding a charity that will take younger volunteers. It may be a liability issue. I'll give you a list of trusted providers that I can vouch for:   Back on my feet Baltimore. If you guys are athletic - or want to be - Back on my feet helps homeless people change their lives by training them to run. Volunteers run with them to show them that we care. Also, endorphins do everyone good. My sister and I volunteer and I can't recall any age requirements: http://baltimore.backonmyfeet.org/ Our Daily Bread Employment Center: Our Daily Bread is a place where homeless people can go for a hot meal, training programs, and other resources such as shelters. This place is operated by Catholic Charities so if they don't take minor volunteers, they'd definitely know who does: http://www.catholiccharities-md.org/our-daily-bread/ Helping Up Mission: https://helpingupmission.org/ Esperanza Center: http://www.catholiccharities-md.org/immigrants/   Lastly, you can call United Way's call center. They connect people in need to various resources. They would be able to help your search. Call 211."

I have mixed feelings about Helping Up Mission, because they require people who use their shelter to attend religious services.    Maryland Food Bank is another good organization.  It's not direct client services, but they feed A LOT of people and can always use the help.   You may also consider making monetary donations in their name and talking about why.  Healthcare for the Homeless does excellent work."
baltimore,3d4ju9,yesitsmeitsok,3,Mon Jul 13 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"My opinion:  Taking kids down to a soup kitchen isn't going to change their behavior.  Parenting is  24/7 job.  Your children's behavior is a direct result of the behavior you exhibit around them, to them.    Perhaps you should reflect on how you go about solving parenting issues, how you talk to your children, how you talk to your spouse, how you treat others and see if there are some things that you're unknowingly instilling in them?  Do you make frivolous purchases?  Do you waste food?  Have you taught them to be polite and vocally thank you for things?  Do you have them do chores?  The best way to instill the value of money to kids is to have them work for the things they get, imo.  And if they don't want to work/help around the house, then they don't get anything, possibly punished.  Its not a hard concept, but it is hard to enforce.    Far too often it seems people are just looking for a way to feel good about themselves like the vocal cause-of-the-week downtowners on this sub  rather than actually make a difference.  Sometimes it does more harm than it does good (extreme liberalism)."

No, we're not perfect, and I'm not banking on any sort of community involvement to change our kids, just enrich them. Our kids are great, but one missing element community service. My son was in scouts for 3 years and it was great, but didn't perfectly hit the mark in that respect     To further complicate things, my wife and I just got married last year. My son and her daughter are from previous marriages. Our custody situation is great and the relationship with the other parents is positive, but we don't have 100% time to instill our values."

BRT isn't an awful idea, but it's certainly no match for light rail, and most importantly you can't just change a BRT route. A BRT system that would be the equivalent of the Red Line would require tens of millions of dollars (possibly hundreds) in infrastructure spending along the alignment for dedicated lanes, signs, stops, lights, etc. You can't just up and change that like you'd change a standard bus line."

I'm totally with you that bmore really could have used an east-west rail, and that that would be the better solution. BRT in general, in Baltimore, I do think should be examined. Trying to mimic the Red Line with BRT would be tough. Certain stretches you could perhaps make bus only, but not the entire thing. But I feel like many roads in Baltimore are needlessly one way, two lane streets. My opinion is take the lane now before the city repopulates. I always think about the stretch between downtown and Charles village. Seems like you could take some road here and make it bus only. I think I've heard of technology where when the bus approaches a light, it actually triggers the light to be green. That kind of thing would be nice too.   While writing this post, however, I'm coming back to bus tracking. This alone would make buses much more efficient in this town."

I think BRT would definitely work better on one way configured streets with at least 2 lanes since at least one lane could still be used for vehicle traffic. Parking could also easily be maintained on both sides of the street, with the BRT using the rightmost lane.   I've watched the patterns of how people drive in general in Baltimore, and I've noticed that many people completely avoid the right most lane whenever possible when they see a bus in it because they don't want to get stuck behind a bus."

And people here will never understand nor experience its convenience."
baltimore,3d2plj,pirate14,13,Mon Jul 13 01:24:50 2015 UTC,Recommend joining a social league: http://baltimoresocial.com/ will make sure you are on a team. http://www.baltssc.com/ aka BSSC is the biggest league but they are hit and miss when they can get you on a team and there leagues aren't that great.  Everyone in both are really social and go out after games etc.  Good Luck!

Hopefully it has tolerable food and had a kitchen open past 11. Go there often enough. Like after work or like at 9 on a weeknight when you don't feel like cooking. If you aren't a creep and are lucky you should have friends in like a month  Edit: This is in addition to all of the other options posters are talking about. The key is you have to have confidence to go out alone and not feel uncomfortable. Eventually you will make friends. Get to know bartenders at at least 3 different bars too. Like they know your name and know what you order and shit. They always know tons of people you can meet.

Trivia night is Monday I think so you can go either play by yourself at the bar or see if anyone will take you on their team. They brew all their own beer and make their own pizza.

I only briefly looked but found this top post in a thread about legality:   No carrier will knowingly allow you to ship any alcoholic beverage unless you are properly licensed. It is my understanding, though, that it is illegal to ship via USPS but only against terms of service if you use UPS or FedEx. Therefore, it's highly recommended that you use a private carrier because you stand to get in a lot less legal trouble if the carrier decides to come after you. I'm not sure if the private carriers can do anything besides refuse service to you in the future. That being said, I've never heard of anyone getting in trouble for shipping alcohol."

baltimore,3d1i9i,art_comma_yeah_right,10,Mon Jul 13 00:48:26 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it's based on a relatively small number of mass / school shootings elsewhere in the country, while having no apparent bearing on the quantitatively greater Baltimore gun violence (even our few mass / school shootings recently involved shotguns - possibly the most ubiquitous firearm in the civilized world). Nobody uses assault rifles to kill people in the city, and rarely do they seem to need more than one or two bullets at a time, so the ban on assault rifles and the new lower max capacity on mags are kind of odd choices. You can still buy all this stuff in CO - home to both Columbine and Aurora. Why are we reacting to another state's incidents and not our own?"
baltimore,3d1i9i,Beer_O_Lantern,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:16:33 2015 UTC,"and rarely do they seem to need more than one or two bullets at a time   Why do you say this? Because the victims are only hit a few times? There was a drive by shooting on my street and 8 bullets were fired. The victim was only hit in the arm and survived. With more bullets available before reloading, perhaps he would have been hit somewhere life-threatening. I only know it was 8 bullets fired because I heard it happen.   My point being: we are only told the final hit, not how many bullets were needed to get that hit."

baltimore,3d1i9i,narcedmonkey,6,Mon Jul 13 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"SB281 made it a requirement to be licensed to own a handgun.  This was sold as a way to stop straw purchases even though the current system required the purchaser to go through an extensive background check and attest under penalty of felony that they were not committing a straw purchase.  How any level headed person can think that requiring a license to exercise a Constitutionally Protected right is Constitutional is beyond me.  Also the license takes weeks to obtain, requires the licensee to be fingerprinted, requires expensive and hard to find classes and itself costs a good bit of money money.  All of this disenfranchises the poor who often live in areas where they most likely need a gun for protection.    SB281 also banned an entire class of weapons just because they looked evil.  This class of weapons is almost never used in crimes and is nothing like the military weapons they resemble.    Basically SB281 was a huge anti-gun circlejerk rammed through by O'Malley who wanted to run for President and Frosh who is an anti-gun weasel."

You need a license to do plenty of things in this country, many of which don't give you the ability to kill people. Obviously people are still going to get guns illegally, but claiming that the law shouldn't exist just because people can break it is stupid. Do you think we should get rid of all drug laws too?"

On this I agree with the Leftoids: focus on treatment instead of imprisonment.  But we should then re-direct 100% of the liberated law enforcement and prison resources to going after violent crime and property crime.  We'd have the same number of people in jail, just more of them would be violent offenders who were serving closer to 100% of their original sentence."

The right to bear arms shall not be infringed, right? The black market is only black because laws prohibits completely unfringed gun trade and ownership. But the black market itself is completely lawless, and in a sense, completely free from regulation from an outside entity.

That ""biased"" source provides legitimate sources for all of its claims.   That's great that people have defended themselves with their guns before, but you are way way way more likely to harm yourself or others unnecessarily the moment you purchase a gun.  It's funny how facts work. Usually against whatever side the right wants to take on issues."

baltimore,3d1i9i,Beer_O_Lantern,2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:15 2015 UTC,"We were talking about homicides by firearm, yet you bring in suicide and all other firearm deaths in with your statistic - when the wording punseen used included only homicides (funny how both of your attention to detail is lacking). Maryland is 3rd in the US for homicides using a firearm.   I don't think that restricting the law abiding makes the homicide rate lower, and I think that giving the law abiding more sensible access to CCW permits will improve the average individual's safety. You can ""not carry"" all the time - but denying someone else's ability and right to protect themselves is selfish and inconsiderate."

Tupac was, and still is, a controversial figure among politicians and police officers, especially due to his and his families politics.  People really underestimate how hated the Shakurs are. Tupac may be dead, but the politicians that made his life a misery are mostly still in office. It would be a hard sell, you may know what Tupac was like as a person, but the general public could be easily convinced he was just a scumbag not worthy or honoring. All it needs is one media blitz."

I think it should be noted that Hassan Giordano identifies as a ""Conservative Independent"" and is a commentator on Fox News Radio and the Examiner.com.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrgiordano  With that in mind is it shocking that he and Mayor Blake would disagree on policy?

The existing subway was supposed to be paired with five other heavy rail lines. The existing light rail was supposed to have at least one other complementary line. The Red Line was supposed to be the first salvo in a full transportation network, with a Green and Yellow line to follow. But they all died the same way.

baltimore,3cwuhc,UnreasonableDoubter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:54:31 2015 UTC,I'd definitely love access into the city by metro. Just thinking about the possibility of being able to not have to drive from Ellicott City to get into the city gets me excited. A shame that'll probably never happen.

baltimore,3cwuhc,Squid4Hire,10,Sun Jul 12 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"Strong public transportation would help Baltimore City grow from a mediocre rust belt-style city to a city that rivals Washington DC in size. The immediate benefit here is that we could offer DC-like travel capability for a fraction of the cost of living and rents for businesses for a period of time. There are a great many people that don't want to live nor work in DC because it's just that much of a nightmare to deal with traffic and it's just too expensive to live near there in comparison.  Not giving Baltimore decent public transportation is going to seriously hurt its ability to compete in the future business market, as millenials are preferring to live in cities than to live in the suburbs.  Even Silicon Valley giants are moving to San Francisco because ""talented employees"" in their 20s and 30s want to be closer to culture and things to do (http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/17/americas/san-francisco-tech-hub/)  In short, if you're pro-business, at all, you are pro Baltimore and pro mass transit. This is the future, and Baltimore just missed the opportunity because of bullshit, short-sighted politics."
baltimore,3cwuhc,a-ko,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"I think Baltimore is actually bigger than DC if we are being technical.  But yes, In all the years I lived in Baltimore I never rode the metro because it was basically useless - it didn't go anywhere.  DC might have what appears to be a better metro system, but let me tell you - as somebody who lived in Baltimore and moved to DC a number of years ago - the system here isn't that great either.  There aren't enough stops near things people want to get to.  Try getting anywhere if you live in NoMa.....you can't, there is no metro stop there and even the street car thing they are setting up there so far has no connection to a metro station so you would still have to walk blocks to Union Station to get a metro connection....  Want to get to Georgetown (where there is high end shopping and restaurants and a lot of rich people)?  no metro access (because originally they wanted to keep outsiders out of the neighborhood).  The closest metro stop involves getting off at Rosslyn which is in Arlington, VA and then walking over a mile across the Francis Scott Key Bridge back into DC which REALLY sucks in winter. aside: although, as far as I am concerned Rosslyn, Courthouse, Pentagon City, Crystal City, and Alexandria city are all part of DC even if they are technically in Virginia - Fuck, Alexandria city used to be part of the District and has actually been around longer than DC, but was returned to Virginia in 1846 mostly for issues of maintaining the port and the massive slave trade industry that Alexandria was a key player in at the time.  For those interested, DC used to be a perfect square, it didn't stop at the border of the Potomac river.  The District of Columbia was made up of two counties: Washington (east of the Potomac) and Alexandria (west of the Potomac).  That is why it is ""Washington, DC"" because what we call DC today is the portion of the District known as Washington.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_retrocession   Then there is the fact that there are constant delays and problems...ask people who live along the red line what they think of the metro system - people who rely on the red line have often been hours late to work recently due to delays.  Last summer the yellow line caught on fire and multiple people were injured and one person died of smoke inhalation.  There was the fatal metro train crash the year before... If you ride certain lines at certain times it is so crowded you can't even move and if you don't start migrating to the door a few stops before yours you have no chance of getting off the train before the doors close.    DC still has a lot of work to do when it comes to public transportation.  Both in terms of reliability and accessibility.  It would be nice if the hours were better too.  But I do agree with you, even if Baltimore had a metro system only as good as DC it would be a HUGE improvement to the city.  I remember I had lived in Baltimore for months before I even knew there WAS a metro system because I had never seen a metro stop.  Eventually I saw the one downtown near all the bank buildings - I think it was Charles Center - and walked down there just to see if it was real.  There were almost 0 people in it and it didn't take you anywhere worth going.  It was a single line that basically just ran north/south.  Combine that with the single line light rail that also only runs essentially north/south and you start to wonder...what happens if you live in east or west Baltimore and need to get downtown for work?  You better find an alternative to the metro/light rail.  It is quite literally useless to you.  Baltimore is still a driving city.  It doesn't even have a heavy cab system....which probably explains the large number of hack-cabs utilized in the city."

baltimore,3cwjvi,finsterallen,4,Sat Jul 11 13:08:48 2015 UTC,"I firmly believe the first step to fixing anything in Baltimore is audits - find out how much money went where and what was received for it, find what works and what doesn't work, see the full picture and then make policy form there.  Without audits, we have no clue what we really have adn the discussion is all spitballing.  The only real audit that has been done in the city in recent memory is the 2 year to completion audit of Parks and Rec (was supposed to take one year).  That said, I don't really care who is mayor so long as they are effective.  Crime spiked under Schmoke (nice guy tho, liked his harm reduction ideas, I am anti War on Drugs - it is a failure), had hopes for O'Malley (but his quest for higher power, bullshit heavy handed policing and stats manipulation killed that, his tenure as gov sucked too IMO), SRB is incompetent and a very poor communicator. The best recent mayor was Dixon, despite the gift card thing (I think that was really all that prosecutors could get to stick, she was clearly dirty with developer money, I imagine the gift cards were just a bribe of some sort, not really intended for poor kids), Dixon lowered crime, fixed roads (SRB spent the $8M set aside for roads projects on teh Grand Prix track), made recycling more available and profitable, helped begin the bike lands and the Circulator, all good things.  In the absence of a viable alternative, looks like I'd vote for Dixon.  And she's correct - SRB's failed leadership is what got us here now..."
baltimore,3cwjvi,46718,2,Sat Jul 11 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of just saying ""audits"" will fix everything. What exactly are you expecting to find? Some sort of ""GOTCHA!"" of a Politician or executive pocketing money funding lavish expenditures rather than the money going somewhere useful?  Take the data on the Baltimore City schools, for example. The top earners are in the MOSTLY $100s range, with the ""CEO"" sitting in the low $300s. http://data.baltimoresun.com/salaries/baltimore-city-public-schools/updated-2015/?showvals=true&NullVariableName=&sortby=Total%2BEarn&sortdirection=DESC  When you really think about it, these salaries just aren't that ludicrous. ""Software Engineers"" and ""Software Architects"", and a wide range of IT jobs in the DC area easily eclipse those salaries with sometimes far greater benefits (http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Software-Engineer-l-Washington,-DC.html)  So it's not like we're 'wasting' a ton of money on people. I know to someone making $30,000/year $150,000/year sounds like a lot of money, and it can be; but around these parts? Shit that's upper middle class.  You're not even doing 'decent' in this area unless you're over $100K."
baltimore,3cwjvi,a-ko,2,Sun Jul 12 17:23:00 2015 UTC,"First, I am not looking for a ""gotcha"", although they do exist - remember the recent police/towing company scam?  The transportation head selling bus shelter ad space for his own pocket?  What about teh no bid and steered contracts - water meter replacement, video phone systems etc? And what about when programs do not work, do not reach the goals intended?  How do you re evaluate and change w/o audits? Why authorize additional funding for failed programs w/o audits and fact checking? Audits are an important tool to help diagnose what works and what doesn't.  Its not the salaries per se, its the accomplishment of goals and what it takes to implement them.  The school system is a poor choice for arguing against audits - they are incredibly bloated and wasteful; I know because my wife taught in teh city for 11 years BCPS, seen it all first hand.  Money is spent, but very little reaches the classroom; it is a disgrace. And again in my 15 years lkiving here, BCPS is multiple millions in the hole.  Audits have to be done to see what is happening, what has happened and to get an idea of how to begin fixing these deficits and hopefully make programming and expenditures more efficient.  You check your bank accounts to make sure you aren't being wrongly-fully charged, yes? IF you don't, you should.  I've had my info stolen twice now, caught them same day, but it still takes a while to completely unravel and it is an impact.

Worth noting that the ""sic semper"" part was written before Marylander John Wilkes Booth assassinated Lincoln, but the sentiment is clearly the same.

I had asked them once about these people that come to my door and they said that they never come out in the field to ""correct"" your bill. if they're actually at your door its because you called them or they're there to tell you to pay or get your lights turned off.

But I quickly did my research and corrected my mistake.  This time, I told the young ladies I wasn't interested, yet they argued that I was doing something wrong.  Again, that was their mistake.  I spent more time than I should have explaining that -- if BGE was concerned about something they sent me in a bill that I missed, then they should contact me again via mail, email, and/or calling and address the situation with me directly.

I just have to put my BGE code on a card and send it in...  The large print uses scary words like YOU MUST and DEFAULT and DEADLINE.

I would guess that this isn't much more than the regular cost of doing business to a company like that, which makes most of their money by preying on unsuspecting residents, but heck, if it makes the scam a little bit harder to make money on, it's worth it to me.

I know this is the Baltimore sub, but there's a lot more MD than just Baltimore, and the city makes poor use of the state and federal money it already receives, out of proportion to what it generates.    Those taxpayers outside of Baltimore who voted for Hogan did so precisely because we did not appreciate the O'Malley legacy of levying additional taxes on the whole state to offset financial mismanagement.

baltimore,3cslew,TheBrainReigns,3,Sat Jul 11 03:50:50 2015 UTC,"the gas tax is puny. It covers about as much of road costs as user fees cover public transit costs.   Now when it comes to diverting gas tax funds to public transit. I'm all with you there. Gas tax revenue needs to be the only funding mechanism for roads in the state, and it should never be poached. Public transit spending should be a mixture of user fees and money from the general fund."
baltimore,3cslew,46718,2,Fri Jul 10 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn;t O'Malley (and prior governors) continually raid the transportation fund to augment the general fund, hence the reason to raise teh gas tax (took the money for other things, not roads etc) adn this is why there is a lockbox on the transportation fund now, so that it cannot be raided (but it can if the governor declares and emergency)."

baltimore,3cslew,46718,0,Fri Jul 10 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the raise in gas taxes was due to the transpo fund raiding ( that's why it is lockboxed now, which it was not before) and the toll increases were due to the costs of the ICC."

baltimore,3cslew,Turnerbn,9,Fri Jul 10 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"Baltimore needs audits sorely anyway - only recent audit completed was for Parks and Rec and that took two years instead of the allotted one year. BCPS are $60M in the hole (could be as high as $108M), and people bitch abput Hogan not authorizing supplemental funding (he didn't cut the already allotted funding, just the supplemental) when they don't instead turn to the BCPS and ask them where the money went.  The city's agencies NEED audits - find the problems and fix them.  Think about it - would you give of loan a friend or relative money if they squandered a large sum, got in a huge hole and couldn't tell you what happened or how they would prevent it in the future and fix the current negative situation? No, you would not send the money w/o accountability - that's insanity."

baltimore,3csb0d,TheBrainReigns,5,Fri Jul 10 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"The words ""well regulated"" had a far different meaning at the time the Second Amendment was drafted. In the context of the Constitution's provisions for Congressional power over certain aspects of the militia, and in the context of the Framers' definition of ""militia,"" government regulation was not the intended meaning. Rather, the term meant only what it says, that the necessary militia be well regulated, but not by the national government.  To determine the meaning of the Constitution, one must start with the words of the Constitution itself. If the meaning is plain, that meaning controls. To ascertain the meaning of the term ""well regulated"" as it was used in the Second Amendment, it is necessary to begin with the purpose of the Second Amendment itself. The overriding purpose of the Framers in guaranteeing the right of the people to keep and bear arms was as a check on the standing army, which the Constitution gave the Congress the power to ""raise and support.""  In keeping with the intent and purpose of the Bill of Rights both of declaring individual rights and proscribing the powers of the national government, the use and meaning of the term ""Militia"" in the Second Amendment, which needs to be ""well regulated,"" helps explain what ""well regulated"" meant. When the Constitution was ratified, the Framers unanimously believed that the ""militia"" included all of the people capable of bearing arms.   http://www.lectlaw.com/files/gun01.htm"
baltimore,3csb0d,narcedmonkey,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"This isn't a legal argument, because that's out of my league.  But given this interpretation, it seems to say that anybody can own a gun without the government making any rules about it. Its asking militias to regulate themselves, basically, with no top down checks on whether or not this is actually happening. Its very hard for me to imagine this interpretation working well in the U.S. I mean, asking for self-regulation is kind of a joke.   I know this is a taboo issue for anti-government gun owners, but I think if there was a way you could monitor who was firing a gun, and when it was fired, and this system was accurate, then you could loosen or get rid of a lot of gun laws because you simply couldn't get away with the act of murder."
baltimore,3csb0d,TheBrainReigns,0,Fri Jul 10 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Most gun owners aren't anti government. They want the 2nd Ammendment to carry the same weight as Ammendments 1-27  Let's take the SCOTUS ruling on gay marriage as an example. SCOTUS ruled that gay marriages are recognized in all 50 states, IE: if you get married in WA that licensure carries over to MD, or HI or any of the 50 States.   With the recognizition of gay marriage as a ""right"" why is it that SCOTUS has not given the same recognizition to the right to keep and bear arms as deemed by the Constitution?  *Edit, only 27, not 29."

Thats the problem with CCW. Unless the person is a highly trained individual, giving guns to people who are already paranoid(face it, you are very paranoid if you feel the need to take a gun with you everywhere) will result in unnecessary deaths or a way of life where pissing someone off results in a gun in your face.   I have no problem with guns and people being able to have guns in their homes.

baltimore,3csb0d,bmoreos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Correlation and Causation my friend.  First of all, the ranking you linked to claims to be based on ""gun violence rates,"" but if you actually read the article the listed states are simply ranked based on the CDC's age adjusted statistics for gun deaths per 100,000.    Secondly, a state's gun death rate is the result of many factors, most of which have nothing to do with the small percentage of people (even in shall issue states) who have CCW permits.  In fact, in almost every state, the majority of gun deaths are suicides, a factor that is influenced primarily by the gun ownership rate rather than the CCW rate.  Also, there is the simple truth that the crime rate anywhere is largely the product of a complex combination of socioeconomic factors that have nothing to do with CCW.    If you look at your top ten list, every state on there either has very low population density (meaning a high gun ownership rate) or a very high poverty rate.  I don't have time to look up and cite all the sources, but just looking at your top four and using the stats from the article, Louisiana and Mississippi are the 3rd and 1st poorest states respectively, and Alaska and Wyoming are the 50th and 49th densest states and both have gun homicide rates that are well below the national average.  Edit: Notably omitted from your list is Washington DC, which is barely even a may issue jurisdiction.  If it were included in your rankings, it would be first.  What's that? You say it would be unfair to include DC because it is an exclusively urban area with a high gun death rate that isn't balanced out by any of the high population, low crime suburbs that drive down the gun death rate of most states without large proportions of firearm suicides?  Well that's kinda the point, isn't it?  Shall issue CCW isn't the driver of the gun deaths in the states you listed any more than the may issue regime in DC causes their sky high firearm homicide rate."

Romjue provided his account when he testified during a federal civil rights trial in June 2002: Several men were in the Blazer. The driver of the SUV, Prince George's Police Sgt. Joseph McCann, said he and another man in the truck—Davis—wanted to talk to him about his girlfriend, Katie Nagel. Nagel was the niece of Clark R. ""Bud"" Price, who at the time was the second in command to Prince George's Police Chief John S. Farrell. Nagel had argued with her father, left home, and spent five days at the home of Romjue's older brother. Price asked Harry ""Buddy"" Robshaw to put together a team of officers to watch Romjue and try to get information from him about Nagel. (Romjue testified that Nagel had told him that her father beat her when he was drunk.) Romjue provided this account of the encounter with the officers in June 2002 when he testified in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt in the federal civil rights trial against Davis, Robshaw, McCann, and Cpl. Stephen Piazza: Believing he had no choice, he agreed to talk to the officers, who were out of their jurisdiction, had no arrest warrant, and did not suspect the teenager of any crime. Davis got out of the Blazer, grabbed his arm and put him in the front seat of the SUV. McCann drove to a parking lot in Howard County, leaned toward the teenager and said, ""If you don't tell me where Katie is, I'll break your kneecaps, and you'll never walk again,"" Romjue testified. The teenager started crying and tried to leave the SUV, but Davis, in the back seat, pulled him back and slammed his head against a window two or three times. Later, Piazza grabbed him from behind and choked him. After about five hours, at around 1 a.m., the officers dropped him off at his home, Romjue testified.

baltimore,3ct66x,ccemtp,2,Fri Jul 10 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"I did Slide the City on Hillen Road a couple of weeks back.  I see Urban Slide responding to a lot of people commenting to stay away because it sucks saying that they are a different company so it won't suck.   Trying to not get long winded with this, it does kind of suck, but if you go there expecting it to suck a bit and just want to have a little fun it is not terrible.  I read all of the terrible reviews before I went (after I bought my ticket) so I kept that in mind and I had fun for the most part. I did waste money because I bought a triple slide and could only go down twice.  The wait will be long, you won't actually get to slide the whole way, it is just not possible.  If the hill was steep enough that you could slide all the way you have no way to stop at the end, so you will have to keep getting up during the slide and push yourself again.  People get hurt, because people who have a real good slide going have a chance of running into a person on the slide that stopped and is trying to get going again. Don't think I will ever do it again, but I don't regret going and neither does anyone I went with."

baltimore,3cpag5,n0tmandatory,3,Tue Jul 14 01:15:19 2015 UTC,cheaper ingredients cooked way ahead of time   I don't know what restaurants you are going to but I have never experienced this at any restaurant I have gone to for restaurant week. It isn't as if the restaurants are forced into participating they choose to as a way to potentially increase their customer base. Sure a lot of people only go to the places because it is cheaper but for many it is a way to check out places that often cost more than they are willing to pay just to find out they don't like it. If you can get a delicious meal for $30 that usually costs $75 why wouldn't you do it.  I guess the view from up on that ivory tower must be a little different than for those of us down here with the common folk.
baltimore,3cpag5,ViolentEastCoastCity,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"I have definitely experienced it. I once received 2 shrimp and 4 mussels over a slice of fennel as my RW entree at Gertrude's. Not even bulked up by something cheap like potatoes or rice. I've also noticed that at some places the math doesn't add up, you'll spend an extra buck or two over just ordering things individually. But if you choose carefully, there are restaurants that really do use it as a showcase and put out a great menu that is definitely worth $30."

All of the sources seem to cite this 175,000 doses figure. Considering that Baltimore has 48,000 (at least) addicted to opiates I don't see that amount of drugs lasting more than a week or two, much less ""moving the market"".

baltimore,3co3h7,Stealing_Fire,2,Thu Jul 9 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work like that (IMO).  175k doses of what?  Also, is everything sell-able or narcotics?  Is it possible they just grabbed a bunch of stuff.  Also, doses are what you and I would take.  However, a junky could be taking 5-100 doses in a day.  What are theses ""doses"" of?  Again, do we have an inventory of what was actually taken?  I'm just skeptical, I'm not saying you are wrong.  Also, depending on the drug, ""doses"" could be $1 or could be $30+."

baltimore,3coyd6,cjmook21,7,Fri Jul 10 14:35:33 2015 UTC,I'm not a planner but I walk all around the area often. It may be close to the north avenue stop on the line but from a pedestrian perspective it feels like it's pretty far from the north avenue stop. Also it would allow access to Remington a north entrance to Reservoir Hill and Druid Hill Park. It seems like a wasted opportunity to me.
baltimore,3coyd6,hawkgamedev,3,Thu Jul 9 18:31:44 2015 UTC,I agree that it's always felt like a dead zone on the light rail that doesn't make sense.
baltimore,3coyd6,Oriolesphilly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if you were talking from somewhere on 28th St that would be at least 10 blocks, depending on your cross street."
baltimore,3coyd6,v62grfe,7,Fri Jul 10 23:45:58 2015 UTC,"What's the point of the North Ave stop, though? Does it really get much ridership from Bolton Hill or Station North folks?  It's so desolate and removed, from a pedestrian aspect. Very evident from a Google Maps perspective, too.  I'm wondering if it exists mainly for the the park-and-ride.  Would totally be OK removing the North Ave stop in favor of the OP's suggested 28th Street stop."
baltimore,3coyd6,Flame_Sniper,3,Thu Jul 9 20:30:13 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it's for proximity to the bus lines on North Ave. The Mount Royal Station serves Bolton Hill (for the most part), but would be too far of a walk for anyone riding the No. 13 bus given the road configuration in the vicinity."
baltimore,3coyd6,hawkgamedev,2,Thu Jul 9 20:50:51 2015 UTC,"It gets plenty of use from Bolton Hill and North Ave. It's also not very removed from a pedestrian perspective. I walk from there at least once a month, and there's always other people walking around there. It's very close to MICA and places like the Wind-up Space and Red Emmas. Most of the light rail stops are about the same distance from busy thoroughfares. The North Ave stop gets quite a lot of passengers. A 28th St stop would get less use. Although it is super annoying to ride the light rail from Charles Village."
baltimore,3coyd6,v62grfe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:32:38 2015 UTC,Hmm. Thanks for the perspective. I'm still perplexed by how to get to it as a pedestrian easily from the Google Maps perspective.
baltimore,3coyd6,TheSchneid,7,Tue Jul 14 22:43:17 2015 UTC,"So that's too close to north Ave... But the mt royal stop is literally like 150 yards south of the north Ave stop? It makes no sense that Charles village/ Remington/ Hamden/jhu didn't get a stop that wasn't a 30+ minute walk. From where I am, it's about a 25 minute walk to north Ave, and a 40 minute walk to cold spring. I often just uber to a ballgame instead of taking the light rail since it costs 5 bucks more but saves me an hour of my time. Doesn't make any sense, especially how Remington is just getting denser and denser. Shit I might even take the light rail to work if I didn't have a half hour walk to make before I wait for a train."

baltimore,3coyd6,Stealing_Fire,6,Thu Jul 9 21:10:10 2015 UTC,"The rail lines around here are really poorly engineered. The North Ave Station is already pretty close to Res Hill if you look at the map (no farther than one that would be equidistant between Res Hill and Remington), however, a wyman park stop would be nice. What the light rail really needs is another ""line"" that follows the same tracks downtown, but branches off before north ave and goes over toward Johns Hopkins and eastward (we want college kids on public transit,  lots of $$$).  The redline was poorly designed too. We definitely need an east-west rail line, but instead of going through an expensive tunnel, it should be elevated downtown (think of the J/Z line over Broadway in Brooklyn NY). It could run through Patterson Park, thus servicing the neighborhoods both north and south of there. Out on the west side, we should get the county to pitch in and send it to UMBC, Catonsville, Ellicott City and, if we can get Howard County to pitch in, Columbia.  Honestly, where the red line was going wasn't very wise if they were trying to make real money off of it. There should be a big vertical transit  station at Howard St. and Baltimore St downtown for transfers.   Now all we need to do is find some state politicians who actually give a fuck about this city."

In fact when the master plan for unified transit was drawn up it was call the Yellow Line.   So far as the Red Line is concerned. It may be moot at this point but construction in and around Patterson Park would've jeopardized federal funds. I would imagine running an elevated line above or straddling the park would draw the same response.   An elevated line may work in the Inner Harbor. Perhaps on Lombard so it doesn't interfere with views on Harborplace, but I seriously doubt Fells Point would agree to an elevated line through their district.    Honestly, where the red line was going wasn't very wise if they were trying to make real money off of it.   I don't think the line would've been directly profitable. The ""money"" at play would've been the increase in property values in areas around the line."

Oh, I was thinking that it shouldn't go through fells at all, rather north of fells around upper fells or butchers hill. I think the best idea would be to have it run along baltimore st above the subway downtown and along the north edge of (or maybe through) patterson park.   Why do you think running it through patterson park would have jeopardized fed funds? Even if it did, a tunnel under patterson park would be a lot cheaper than the long tunel under downtown and fells.   But yeah, it's moot until state politicians decide baltimore is worth their time. And I'm pretty sure they're too short-sighted to realize the potential this city has."

Even if it did, a tunnel under patterson park would be a lot cheaper than the long tunel under downtown and fells.   If I remember correctly one of the conditions the feds have was that the light rail work couldn't remove land from a public park. I couldn't quote you the exact rule, but this is why the Red Line couldn't run on Eastern. It would've eaten land from Patterson Park."

baltimore,3coyd6,Talltimore,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"The only flaw I see in your plan is that the county doesn't want a public transit line. Take the current bus lines, for example, follow the lines into the county. Along those lines, every town is now shit. Since the city handed out housing vouchers, people hopped on the bus and followed it to Catonsville, Elkridge, Glen Burnie, Pasadena, edges of Ellicott City, Randalstown, Reisterstown, Owings Mills, Towson etc. Whether this is the true cause of the decline in these areas is irrelevant, it seems that is the common feeling about the situation. I don't think you'll find too many residents of Columbia or Ellicott City that want a light rail line coming any where near their house."
baltimore,3coyd6,jowybyo,5,Thu Jul 9 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"Eh, I really don't know much about the county, although I wouldn't consider the towns you mentioned to be in particularly bad shape. If they used to be better, they probably are in decline because they're suburbs of a city that's been in decline for some time now. Either way, an east-west line, even if it's only within city limits, would be a start. The counties might hop on the band wagon later if it seems to work out."
baltimore,3coyd6,Stealing_Fire,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the city has been in decline. If anything, it has much less suck than it did 30 years ago when all the aforementioned towns were much nicer than they are now. The change started with the city knocked down a bunch of Section 8 housing (for gentrification) and gave all those people vouchers to find housing elsewhere. It was enough for them to move out of the city to these other places. It's still happening."

From a mass transit POV, those areas should be gold mines but they are not."
baltimore,3coyd6,john_the_resonator,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:00:44 2015 UTC,Because the metro and subway are way better than the light rail. Probably also has a lot to do with population density and higher income.

While nothing struck me as problematic, it wasn't until we looked at ratings did we have a better understanding of what to expect.  He finally chose Roland Ridge Apartments.  It's run by Southern Management.  It's clean and the rent is extremely reasonable.  Southern Management gets strong ratings on their buildings.  While I know it will be hard to find a place from a distance, focusing on the company will make it easier.   I would definitely recommend checking out Southern Management and then decide from their properties.  http://www.southernmanagement.com/"

It doesn't have a ton of character, to be honest, but when moving from a whole other area it was easier for me to pick a big mgmt company. And there is an extra charge for cats but it's not much.

He's extremely bright and competent, and had some really good ideas for reforms of the BPD. He's only been here for three years.  The Freddie Gray and riot problems are longstanding, systemic issues that no police commissioner could have fixed in that amount of time.  I don't think any commissioner alone could do it, period.  These are symptoms of problems that are bigger than just the chief of police.   The saddest thing is we're almost invariably going to end up with someone far less qualified and capable than Batts, all so the Mayor can make it look like she's doing something.

But even if they had grounds not to pay, they probably will do so anyway because he could drag it out, cost the city a large amount in fees and costs, and probably spread dirt on SRB, whether justified or not.

baltimore,3cl7do,CactusInaHat,11,Thu Jul 9 12:34:47 2015 UTC,"Batts appeared on Midday to discuss the riots, and he noted that it wasn't his first rodeo. He counted nine separate riots he dealt with while in law enforcement, many of which while he was in a command position. All I could think of was, ""jeez, you seem to attract this trouble, don't you? Maybe we'd be better off with a police commissioner with no riot experience.""  I feel a bit for him. Batts inherited a fundamentally flawed police department, but being dealt a bad hand doesn't excuse bad performance. Count me in the group that believes if situation at Mondawmin was managed better, the riots probably wouldn't have happened. That's directly on Batts from my perspective, even if he wasn't able to defuse the culture that made ""rough rides"" commonplace in the city."
baltimore,3cl7do,stackolee,5,Wed Jul 8 21:01:39 2015 UTC,What exactly do you think could've been done differently at Modawmin to prevent escalation? Genuinely asking to learn.
baltimore,3cl7do,BmoreGrrl,10,Wed Jul 8 21:57:32 2015 UTC,"Two big things:    Don't close down Mondawmin Mall. In particular don't close down the bus depot. That trapped a lot of people in one place. I seriously doubt the majority of them were intending to ""purge"". On Midday Batts completely dodged the question of who shut down Mondawmin. He seemed to imply bus service was cut off as an indirect consequence to so many police arriving at the mall, which is even worse. Tactics-wise whoever was calling the shots should've known how much effect that would have.  I don't believe that ""purge"" was going to happen. It was just an Instagram meme. But giving the police the benefit of the doubt that it could happen, why set up at Mondawmin? It was much too big a space to police with the officers they had. The ""purge"" invite said they were going to end up on Pennsylvania and North, why not set up there? There are multiple streets better suited for that type of crowd control."
baltimore,3cl7do,46718,21,Wed Jul 8 23:31:48 2015 UTC,Allow the students to remain on buses and arrive home safely. Don't use Twitter to incite violence and rumors about gangs.

I hope the next major Commissioner starts opening the Baltimore PD as an outreach for the community it serves.

I don't think Batts could have handled it any other way though. His hands were tied because of Ferguson. Tensions were high, and any use of force by the police might have been countered with gunfire.   Another thing police are upset about is that so many people are filming them whenever they appear anywhere in uniform.   Officers walk around areas, surrounded by clouds of phones.  When they respond to calls, people film them from all around. Officers get aggravated because people won't stop filming, and sometimes loudly yelling about the fact that they are filming. So the police ask the person who just called 911 if they want to go to the station to finish up/file a crime report. Oddly enough, not many people are keen in jumping into a BCPD car/van at the moment, so many cases are just dropped right there. The way some of the officers want to respond is by stopping patrols. Batts, obviously, won't/can't allow that to happen.   I think the simple answer is to just attach a camera to each cop.  Seems easy.   Source: Family members are BCPD"

""Protesters"" will push to see what they can get away with--once you show they can do almost anything without a reaction, they will.  The problem is not that police are being filmed--it's that they can do their job, have people complain about it, and then get hung out to dry by the higher-ups who are supposed to have their backs.  Someone with a warrant and a weapon runs from you and resists, people then start filming you as you take them down and arrest them, and you could lose you job and get sued for everything you own while your own people sell you out to save their own asses.  That's why they're pissed about being filmed.  They don't want to risk their jobs/lives in communities that then turn on them when they try to stop crime there, and I don't blame them.  If West Baltimore wants a soft police department, they can't then be surprised when crime explodes.  Yes, it's a good thing they let the city burn; it really prevented escalating gunfire.

Some are upset about that sure, but I think what people were most upset about is when they killed him in the van.   I meant the actual riot itself could have turned into a shootout, not that it would have no effect on the future.  And it isn't the community turning their backs on the police, its dozens of jerks."

Even if he was hurt, if he was breaking the law, I do not think they used excessive force to apprehend him. Thus, no charges filed for tackling him.  I am making the assumption that Mr. Gray had more than the injury to his spine, but the details the sun leaked about the medical report do not mention any other injuries, so I could very easily be wrong."

I know it is not entirely up to the police to fix that relationship, but maybe the police can be the ones to make the first move. When trying to earn a communities trust back you can't wait for them to come to you and say, ""please teach us to trust you.""  There is a simple way to avoid lawsuits. Don't kill people except in self defense, or in the defense of innocents. If someone asks for medical assistance, give it to them. Don't arrest someone after you find out they have a legal knife on them, or, learn the actual laws in the city you police.  Cops aren't being fired or sued for patrolling and questioning suspicious individuals. They tackled Mr. Gray to arrest him, and no one is in trouble due to the way in which he was apprehended.

I trust the police can tell if a knife has a spring in it.  Here is the law, for anyone interested.  § 59-22 Switch-blade knives.

Sometimes  helping someone with an emergency is simply making them feel safe and protected again.

Plus, he was attacked by a group of ""youths"", who unlike a solitary mugger are likely to still be in the area and are easy to identify if the police were to actually respond to the scene and do a bit of canvassing.  If BPD are so undermanned that they can't treat a mugging as an emergency, then I think it is time to make some changes.  Edit: words"

It can't even be construed as credible. Passing it along to the public in the guise of a ""credible threat"" is blatant propaganda designed to scare people, nevermind completely unprofessional.  As I was watching the twitter feed during the riot, I noticed they insisted on calling everyone they mentioned ""criminals"". Everyone, it seemed, was a criminal. Forget about being professional enough to call people suspects before they're convicted in a court of law. Whichever officer or dispatcher is running the BPD Twitter apparently doesn't bother with trials, you're a criminal if they decide you are.  And I'm not even going to get into the whole ""you don't want us to beat the shit out of people for looking at us wrong so we're not doing our jobs"" horseshit.

It's not even the first time it's circulated through Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.  2014 -- Louisville, KY - A local high school football game was postponed as a result. Police found the source of the image, who pretty much did it just to have a bit of ""fun"".  2014 -- Jacksonville, FL  2014 -- Oklahoma City, OK  2014 -- Albany, GA  The image circulated within Baltimore last year as well. That was not the first time either. An image was circulated in 2013 subsequent to the release of the first film.  These stupid rumors get thrown around all the time. In 2006 in Los Angeles, there was a warning that one day, gangs would be hunting for anyone wearing a white t-shirt on a particular day. As with all the other supposed incidents here, nothing happened.  I'll also point out that every surrounding county (Howard County included) stated that very day that they could not substantiate the claims of any threat. Kevin Kamenetz (County Executive) and James Johnson (Baltimore Co. Police Chief) themselves held a press conference that very day in which they iterated (and then reiterated in another conference later that same day, subsequent to the start of the days events) that the claim, and the associated rumors -- aka: ""The Purge"", ""had been investigated, and that they are unsubstantiated [...] There are no credible threats.""  This was mismanagement from the top-down, poor execution from the ground-up; and it was all driven by a PR campaign to spread fear for the purposes of giving an excuse to carry out the actions that were observed that day by city officials (within which I am including the Mayor, the City Council, and Public Safety officials)."

This is going to sound stupid, but if you're a fan of the Orioles, you knew 10 years ago that we were getting Dave Trembley as a new manager and, by golly, he was a lot better than Sam Perlozzo! Everyone loved him, he could do no wrong. And Andy McPhail! What a wizard in the front office, turning those trades, etc.   I'd like to say that without the benefit of foresight, Dave Trembley is not Buck Showalter. I'd also argue that Andy McPhail did not have the baseball acumen of Dan Duquette. Without these organizational changes to really evaluate what could be improved, the Orioles would still be having losing seasons every year.  Now, I'm sure you're saying ""This isn't baseball! that's a ridiculous comparison!"" I challenge you to stand back and look at what's going on; is Batts the right fit? Has he made strides to improve Baltimore? Is there a Buck Showalter of Police that can show us how things can be better than Batts could ever show? We won't know unless Batts leaves, otherwise, we're going to have more status quo from Batts as time goes on, and who knows if that leaves Baltimore in the Loss column for another few seasons."

Further leadership changes are needed though - remember FG was swept up as part of a crack down ordered by Mosby (responding to community group complaints).

It’s a very delicate balancing act. Because while we try to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well. And we worked very hard to keep that balance and to put ourselves in the best position to de-escalate and that’s what you saw this evening.   It's crystal clear to me that the mayor's comments are a pragmatic recognition that giving people space to practice their 1st amendment right to protest also means giving people space to destroy."

Also I don't even like SRB as a mayor but there are so many other issues to criticize her for we don't need to focus on out of context sentences in a speech given during a fucking riot.

baltimore,3ckd25,DanielPedberg,3,Wed Jul 8 16:17:45 2015 UTC,I would take the MARC train from BWI train station (free shuttle between the airport and the train station) The MARC train will take you directly to Union Station  it takes about 40 minutes from station to station and they run at least once an hour.    tickets run $7 one way (add $5 if purchasing the ticket on the train)
baltimore,3ckd25,GilroyMD,2,Wed Jul 8 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"They are 8$ now... sorry to break the bad news to you, but it is still a pretty good deal!  The MARC is pretty much your only option for a singular train to Union station."

baltimore,3ckd25,v62grfe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:10:54 2015 UTC,"MARC is a quick, cheap option but if and only if your flight is arriving at a time lining up to the schedule which mostly runs 6am-10pm ish Mon-Fri (check the MARC's schedule online for specifics.$ The Saturday-Sunday schedule is a bit dicey for early morning or late night arrivals. It also doesn't run most holidays.   If you are arriving at a time MARC is not in service, you can take the WMATA bus that goes to Greenbelt Metro (you'll have to google this a bit), or you can take Amtrak.  Amtrak uses the same rail/station as the MARC.   BTW, this question is probably much better for a DC subreddit. BWI is the second-closest airport to DC and lots of residents use it. For us Baltimoreans, besides the MARC, we also have the luxury of the very convenient light rail or a $20ish Uber or $30ish taxi depending where you go in the city.  We still welcome you though, hon.

baltimore,3cfwez,wheelsee,5,Tue Jul 7 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's the wrong way, and I do recognize that it could help, but I don't think it would make much of a dent with the issues at hand. Allow me to explain why, and If I may propose an alternative...  I think police officers have more of a responsibility to - regardless of where they are from - know the area that they are assigned to, be familiar with its nuances, and actually interact with the community.  Yes, a cop on Pennsylvania Avenue is probably not going to be very well liked. However, I'd be willing to bet that if said cop would be willing to put in the time and effort to try to work with people, make themselves more presentable (not in the aesthetic sense, but in the manner of their approach and dealing with people as just another person rather than the ""Us vs. Them"" approach that permeates through departments nationwide), then things might change. The community may be more willing to speak with them as opposed to being immediately hostile upon sight. I'm not asking every cop to get out of the car and hoop with the neighborhood kids, but I am asking that cops not roll through Northwest Baltimore (or ""sketch-town"" as some of my co-workers seem to like to call it) with the sole-intention of busting heads.  The fact of the matter is that the exact opposite of this has been the situation for a long time. An oft-stated colloquialism states that the definition of insanity is the practice of engaging in the same action over and over again whilst expecting a different result. It is more than evident that what we have is not working, and we need a change. I just don't think that pulling officers exclusively from Baltimore City and the surrounding areas of Baltimore County is going to put a dent in the issue - especially when the new officers get absorbed into the current culture that is already established by their peers and the leadership present."
baltimore,3cfwez,Dr_Midnight,5,Tue Jul 7 20:57:42 2015 UTC,Your argument was about not policing where you live. I gave an argument how it's a personal decision.  The point of him living in Carroll county was to clarify that he does not live here. If you look at his facebook you'll find more posts about Texas than anything else. He is mentally an outsider to the residents and this city.
baltimore,3cfwez,belvebeer,-6,Tue Jul 7 21:15:36 2015 UTC,"Until you have qualified residents of the city lining up to get police jobs, then this is just a totally irrelevant point.

baltimore,3cfwez,dmasterdyne,0,Wed Jul 8 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"lt for much of this sub to understand. Go ahead and google it, since you're currently taking it as a literal statement.   I understand   I'm sure the rest of the random memes about obama or the baltimore leadership are enough to ""prove"" he's a piece of shit bully racist bigot literal-puppy-killer.   Hyperbole (since it seems like your trying to have a real discussion here I thought I'd point that out to nip that in the bud).   Did you ever post something making fun of republicans? Or Bush? Or some wacky christian belief?    No, again, this is not because of the beliefs I hold, but because I understand that those things are viewed by other people who may not be on my friends list (as is the case here). Also, I think it is important to point out again that as a public servant one needs to be hyper-aware of this, that is, if you want to be considered competent, one must act professionally. If you want to be carpenter, a designer, a chef etc, post whatever inane crap you want to social media. If you want to be a politicain, a police officer, or any other public servant, then you have chosen to make a sacrifice for the greater good of society. That's the way this works. A person who works for the citizens of Baltimore (or anywhere) needs to be aware of this. It's 2015.   People like you give cops impossible standards to attempt to live by, while giving criminals extremely lenient ones.   Ah I see you've come to a reasonable conclusion from our long intimate relationship. First, I do have standards for public servants, many of which do a great job, in this case it's serving and protecting. I'm a white guy that's been living in Baltimore city for 15 years. I'm educated and have no criminal record whatsoever. Oh I could tell you some stories of the shit interactions I've had with BCPD. Now, I'll be fair, I've had plenty of good experiences as well, but I do hold police to higher standards, that is supposed to be part of the honor that comes with that badge. I have 2 close friends who are cops, one in the county and one in the city. They're good people, they understand this.   If by impossibly high standards, you mean reaching out with empathy and professionalism to a citizen who was just mugged who you've sworn to protect, then I have to conclude that I think your standards are disgustingly low. I'm not talking about anything abstract here, I'm talking about this specific cop.  To your second point:   while giving criminals extremely lenient ones [standards]   I'm not sure I understand what your trying to say there. How does one have low standards for criminals? I'll try to address this anyway; Earlier I stated that I've witnessed cops doing questionable things in my tenure living in the city, well, that goes both ways, I've see citizens of Bmore, predominantly those of poor socioeconomic backgrounds, do things that are frankly uncivilized and criminal. I've see 22 year old white bro's exhibit similar behavior, fuck them. As with this cop, personal decisions and behavior have consequences. From this perspective, there is no right or wrong, only actions and consequences.  So let me ask you this:  Is there a such thing as a bad cop, ie - are there police officers that are corrupt? Do they exist?  Should police officers be held to higher ethical standards than people who are not public servants?"

I just got home from work where I can reddit from a keyboard instead of my phone, and I was about to start picking apart each photo on the officer's FB page to explain why I'd chosen the words that I did. Ha. reddit gets my knickers in a bunch sometimes as well.  You're right, discourse on this sub can and often is awful. I think that just plays into the natural demographic of this area and to the demographic of the people that use reddit. That overlap of makes this sub what it is. Anyway, I do see you're a regular and often have insightful comments.  Maybe The Sun will pull another article from this thread. I do think that the cop's facebook page is symbolic of the current controversy. It's not that he chose the wrong career path, it's that someone with that attitude should not be in charge of protecting good citizens of Baltimore City. His FB posts reinforce the stereotype (true or not) that is the attitude of the BCPD. Again not that it is or isn't true, but the way it's perceived. Much like the way 'thugs' was being thrown around 2 months ago. Thoughts?"

The anti-cop tone of the previous comment aside, I think the point was that once you factor in the generous benefits and large amount of overtime pay, the average police officer is compensated significantly more than their base salary would suggest.  As for the question of are our cops under or over compensated, the best way to determine that is usually how easy it is to recruit and retain qualified people.  Given the stories we have been hearing about the exodus from BPD, I would say they are probably underpaid, or at least managed in such a way that doing the job is not worth the compensation to many officers."

Think about the guy at Kinkos who wants to murder the customers who can never figure out how to copy something correctly and screws up all the print settings.  Or the IT guy who wants to burn down the building because the users won't stop downloading malware.  Everybody gets frustrated in their job when the people who don't know their job do something silly or stupid.  BUT, police are not just some computer guy in your office, or some wage slave at Kinkos.  They are (hopefully) heavily trained, public servants.  If Kinkos shuts down we can go somewhere else.  If the cops shut down, we're kind of fucked.  TL;DR: So yeah, it's victim blaming, but I understand where it comes from even if it is unprofessional and shitty.

When I take that 0.033 and add it back into their rate I get 0.0933 against a BGE rate of 0.0942.  So over the course of the year that's $15.  I dunno, that doesn't sound worth it to me.

I immediately found a new doctor. I do want to say, this was MY experience with her - she has many awards and is recommended by multiple people. For me, she was not... good. She made me uncomfortable.   However, I can't say nicer things about Dr. Taro Adachi, who also previously worked for Mercy. He's kind, professional, and listens.

The added benefits of tourists using the bus to get to BMI and Ft McHenry and you have something that should have been an easy decision without the need to save it.

baltimore,3cd1ii,bmore,2,Tue Jul 7 15:04:51 2015 UTC,"Well said - an infrequent service is barely better than no service at all. For all practical purposes, most of the time there will be no Banner Route or CCC at large, because it will not be frequent enough to be worth waiting around for.  Plenty of cities have tourist-type circulators that look great on paper (photos of shiny buses, maps with lots of colorful lines), but I almost never end up taking these circulators because they don't run often enough to be useful. They may as well not exist.  The CCC was a wonderful exception to the typical useless-tourist-bus fad, but I guess not anymore. :-( The saving of the Banner was a pyrrhic victory: they should have focused all resources on keeping the existing Purple and Orange routes frequent (i.e. by scrapping the Green, Banner, Purple extension, and Harbor Connectors) but I guess they decided to dilute all the routes to a level of uselessness. So on a map it'll still look like there'll be a comprehensive CCC (all the colorful lines will still be there), but it won't run often enough to be useful."

baltimore,3caul3,wheelsee,56,Mon Jul 6 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"I had my truck broken into just off Calvert. The guy was still there picking through my things when I came back to the vehicle. After shouting and a brief tussle I chased after the guy down the calvert.  We both ran right by a parking enforcement officer.  Shortly after that I gave up the chase and went back and asker the parking enforcement lady if she could stick around to talk to the police. She immediately put her hand in her chest, I assume blocking her name or id number - I couldn't tell because I never saw it - and practically ran back to her little vehicle saying ""I didn't see nothing"".  So I call the police and walk back to the truck.   A female officer arrives pretty quickly. When she gets there she's just like the detective from OP story. She doesn't care at all about what the guy looked like, where we went, what he took etc... she laughs at me telling her about the parking enforcement woman...  All she cares about is that I had said on the phone that I was robbed on Calvert but actually the vehicle was just off Calvert and technically parked on 23rd. So this case wasn't her responsibility! The dispatcher should have alerted somebody else...  Gee thanks. I did get a police report number out of her to turn into my insurance company which is about all the use the police were to me anyway."

They wouldn't give a fuck about the community whatsoever and just treat it like its a war zone. I know a lot of police in Baltimore aren't city residents, but there is enough of them who are. You bring the state in and they're going to treat the entire city like its a bad neighborhood rather than focus on the actual bad neighborhoods.   I'm sure most of us have friends and family that do their best to never step into city limits and think we have drug dealers on our corners and murderers everywhere.

From what I've read, Camden is actually getting better (not that it's there yet). The exact wrong thing to do was to ""stop policing"". They are using methods that involve policing on foot patrols where police actually interact with the communities (good police work, working with the community instead of against it), in combination with new technology sponsored by the state of NJ.

Now that being said, I've lived in Baltimore for 15 years since college, and I've been aware that these root issues need to be addressed (I'm sure you are too, and we're not the only ones). I've even been a part of initiatives to help where I can (community govt, Sarah's Hope, Green Spaces etc). In that time, I have seen an overall degradation of the poorer neighborhoods, and in the most blighted neighborhoods, things have been getting much, much worse (culminating in events this past Spring). From what I've experienced, corruption is the driving factor, from all parties (from criminals, to politicians, to law enforcement and beyond). I think technology can limit corruption.

The city council controls the BPD budget, but  it's continuously mentioned in articles that it is in fact a state agency.  In fact, the city council tried and failed a few years ago to bring the BPD under their control so that they could have a say on what's going on inside the agency.   Late Tuesday afternoon, Baltimore City Solicitor George Nilson said the letter the city sent claiming officers aren't city employees is just ""lawyerspeak"" because technically, he said, the city Police Department is a state agency but the city pays for it.   http://www.wbaltv.com/news/city-claims-officers-not-city-employees-in-response-to-suit/30948020"

baltimore,3caul3,46718,2,Mon Jul 6 20:07:50 2015 UTC,"But that's the problem the city has had for years though... the Mayor and council have no real authority over the agency, so the BPD takes city suggestions under advisement and can ignore it at will.  With no real authority, the city has had their hands tied behind their backs when it comes to police reform.  Also, the city can put someone up for Commissioner, but they can't fire them directly.   No other city in the state has that arrangement that I know of."

It takes an average of 2 hours to respond to a call (many minor crimes cannot even be responded to) and at one point there were only 6 officers on duty in central last week.

baltimore,3caul3,e2hawkeye,28,Tue Jul 7 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"Since we're sharing awful police stories, I guess I'll give it a go!   I've had to call 911 on 5 separate occasions.  On each occasion I received a busy signal.  I've had to redial several times to get an operator.  On each time I was placed on a fairly long hold.  I recall the last time I was on hold for around 8 minutes before speaking to an operator.  Thankfully these were not imminent, life threatening emergencies but imagine people who were bleeding out or had a gunman in their house dialing for help.   One time, I immediately got an operator when I dialed.  I was so surprised that they answered so quickly.  Unfortunately, I was directed to Baltimore County 911.  I had to keep telling the operator that I am in the city not county.  The operator insisted that I reached the right place so I gave her the location when she asked for it.  ""Oh, that's in the city not the county, please hold"" I nearly lost it when she said that.  This is worth mentioning because I was on Patapsco Ave getting gas and saw a man laying face down unconscious across the street.  At least EMS got there pretty quickly. On one occasion, I saw a man get into a fist fight with a cab driver on the corner of Light St and Redwood St.  While I was stuck in traffic I witnessed the man swing at the cabbie then the man laid on the floor in front of the cab so the driver couldn't leave.  I tried calling 911 but guess what happened?  Luckily, I saw two police officers on the corner of Light and Lombard so on the green light I floored it to inform the officers.  I told the officers what was going on to which the officers replied, ""where?"" I got out of the car to point and the officers said, ""I don't see nuffin'""  I kept telling them where the incident is occurring but the officers kept playing dumb. At least the guy gave up and left. One time I called the MTA police on the behalf of a foreign lady who had her purse stolen from one of the buses.  This was after the 911 operator told me to call MTA police instead.  I called them and the officer transferred me to his sergeant and the sergeant actually told me he was not going to file a report and not bother with it because the woman forgot the bus number.  She can recall the date, time, and the bus route it happened in but that wasn't enough for him to do shit. I can't count the number of times I've seen a squad car run a red light without turning on it's sirens or how many accidents they nearly caused. I can't count the number of times police officers used their sirens just to cross the red light because they were too impatient to wait.  They turn off their sirens once they cross the intersection.  If you're going to misuse your power, at least be discreet! Last week I was on an intersection and I took a right turn into another street.  I had the green arrow that gave me right of way while on the other intersection both lanes took a left.  A car comes racing down and while the guy is supposed to stop for the red light, he takes a left and nearly crashes into the cars who had the right of way that were turning left and nearly crashes into me.  There was a squad car sitting on the median with two officers facing and witnessing the whole thing.  The two officers did nothing.   I have more stories to share but I have to get back to work.  I am really pissed off at how poorly our city is managed.  I keep hearing all of the magnificent things that are occurring in other counties.  The crime in Prince George's County is at an all time low.  This morning on NPR I heard Anne Arundel County actually has a surplus of money for their sewer system so water rates will decrease.  Howard County can afford an annual budget upwards to $1 billion.  Meanwhile in Baltimore City... ugh.  If anyone is down to protest their incompetence, I am down to join the cause."

baltimore,3caul3,BaronVonYolo,6,Tue Jul 7 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"-Our 911 dispatchers could use some improvement for sure.  You're not the only one who I've heard of having those problems.  -MTA is actually a state agency and not controlled by the City, so you'd have to organize a different protest for them.  -Concerning the traffic stuff...while it certainly is possible that the officers were just impatient or lazy (and it wouldn't surprise me at all), there are a number of other factors that you have no way of knowing about that also may have come into play.  As far as running lights with no/limited lights and sirens...for many emergency calls you want to arrive quickly and try to avoid scaring off the suspect.  Burglaries, armed persons, and drug calls are a common example of that.  If you pull into the surrounding area with your lights and sirens going off, the suspect is going to hear and see all that and then pop out the back or ditch whatever contraband he has before officers can set up a perimeter.  So you try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourself as an officer when you're on the way to those types of calls.  Obviously the officer should attempt to respond safely and not cause an accident, though.  A lot of calls aren't emergency in nature, but it is still a priority to get to them as quickly as possible and take care of it before too many calls start to back up or something major happens.  If traffic (especially down town) is preventing that from happening, then an officer is probably going to go through some lights with limited/no lights and sirens unless it creates a dangerous situation.  Lastly, a lot of times you'll see some officers sitting somewhere and assume they're just doing nothing, like your traffic example, but there are any number of reasons they could be sitting there.  This city likes to be reactionary and have stationary posts in areas where there have been recent crimes. An officer at a post like that is unable to handle calls or even leave that area unless a serious emergency pops up.  Or the officer could have been waiting for a tow truck to arrive, looking/waiting for a victim of a crime, waiting on a crime lab, guarding a crime scene, or doing anything else that requires them to be exactly where they are."
baltimore,3caul3,stennyfrigs,9,Mon Jul 6 21:07:01 2015 UTC,Hmm... I guess you could be right.  We never know what circumstances officers face.

You've never once seen a BPD officer pull into a Royal Farms gas pump because police don't get gas at Royal Farms.  And I doubt you've seen them go through a BK drive through either.  BK typically gives officers (and firefighters, military, and paramedics) a discount if they go in, but not through the drive through.  And we all know how cheap city police are.  Nice try, though.  Anything else you'd like to lie and exaggerate about?   how the fuck is blowing red lights a manner of ""not drawing attention""? everyone in the fucking block stops and goes ""wow that asshole just did that.""   They do not want to draw attention from the suspect inside the house or not in sight of the officer.  I would think someone could use a little common sense to figure that out, given the context of my post.   all of these fucking things that your imaginary diligent cops could be standing around waiting for are fine. why don't they fucking say ""sorry, I'm busy at the moment, let me use my expensive-ass crypto radio to call another human being who can help"" instead of ""fuck off, I didn't see anything""?   Yes, totally imaginary.  No officer has ever had to wait for a tow truck, find a caller, or hold a crime scene.  Complete fabrication on my part.  And again, if you had read what I actually said, it was in reference to his point about the officers doing nothing about the reckless driver.  You can tell that because I said ""like your traffic example.""  This is where reading comprehension comes into play.   when the day comes that someone makes these complaints, and the response of the average BPD officer is ""this sucks, here is who to call when you see shitty behavior"" instead of ""no you're just a clueless civilian who doesn't understand the SUBTLE INTRICACIES of standing around next to 7-11"", that will be the day we have a worth-a-shit police force.

If he hadn't exaggerated his point in an attempt to prove that there was absolutely no way the officer could have been doing what I had stated then I would have believed him.  But he probably assumed that if he had just said ""pulled into Royal Farms"" then I would have responded ""how do you know there was no call there?"", which is why he added the gas pump in to ""solidify"" his story.

BK typically gives officers (and firefighters, military, and paramedics) a discount if they go in, but not through the drive through. And we all know how cheap city police are. Nice try, though. Anything else you'd like to lie and exaggerate about?   this is great.  shit that I've seen with my own eyes can't happen because of fast food discounts and the fact that they parked at a gas pump -- note I never fucking said they bought gas, moron.  blow red light -> sit on fat cop ass parked next to gas pump -> fuck with facebook.  what possible call did they receive that makes this tactic necessary?  also, is this how cops respond to actual meaningful investigations as well?  with defensiveness, accusations, and bad faith?  no wonder you guys can't get your shit together.   They do not want to draw attention from the suspect inside the house or not in sight of the officer. I would think someone could use a little common sense to figure that out, given the context of my post.   news flash, genius:  cell phones exist.  cops acting sneaky?  word gets around.  I would think someone could use a little common sense to figure that out, given the context of your job.   Yes, totally imaginary. No officer has ever had to wait for a tow truck, find a caller, or hold a crime scene. Complete fabrication on my part. And again, if you had read what I actually said, it was in reference to his point about the officers doing nothing about the reckless driver. You can tell that because I said ""like your traffic example."" This is where reading comprehension comes into play.   you dodged the point, again, because you're an idiot.  given the existence of a police officer whose sworn duty is to stand around and wait for someone, why does this officer say ""fuck off, I didn't see anything"" (this is a direct quote I personally heard a cop say to a woman trying to report a crime) rather than ""I'm busy""?  try to focus up here -- I know you like to talk about reading comprehension; time to demonstrate some.   Maybe you can call your pal Jamal Bryant who you like to defend and you guys can stand and block some traffic together? I'm sure that will help things out.   bet you just can't wait to kill him with the inside of a van, eh?"

You could have at least pretended that there were no parking spaces and he went in to get a coffee or something.  But you somehow managed to see him blow the light, park in front of the gas pump, and then play on Facebook.  Please tell me more of this made up story.  It's really getting interesting.

No, I did not dodge the point.  Your trouble reading and following a basic conversation strikes again.  The part you quoted me was in response to the person who claimed that the cops did not do anything to apprehend the reckless driver.  He did not confront them.  There is no opportunity to say ""sorry, I'm busy"" because there were no words exchanged at all.  Meanwhile, it's interesting that you think I should have somehow known about your also likely imaginary officer saying ""fuck off, I didn't see anything"" before you mentioned it so I could address it.  I bet it was the Royal Farms Facebooker, wasn't it?  My bad on that one I guess.   bet you just can't wait to kill him with the inside of a van, eh?   Nope, I don't hate him.  I feel sorry for all the people he suckers out of their money though.  I'm guessing you're one of them given your previous comments about him.  I'm sure all that money you give him is going right back into the community and will get you in the express lane to heaven."

Not I'm too lazy to look up the non-emergency number and wait a few minutes to speak with an operator.  That way 9-1-1 stays open for people having heart attacks, someone been shot or is shooting, someone is dying, ETC. instead of them having to wait for others to get on with whatever non-emergency people call for."

Five minutes later I found myself surrounded by 7 officers, including a lieutenant openly accusing me of being either on drugs or insane. After questioning my house guests as to my sanity, despite multiple witnesses to the gunfire, the southwest district proceeded to blow off the call and leave without action.

Of the 4 times I've been robbed in the city, twice the officers accused me of stealing my own stuff so I would get insurance money.   After I caught the burglar (with no help from the police) I called the police and showed them the evidence. I also showed the evidence to his employer. The police told me they couldn't arrest the accused then, I had to go to the police station to file the charges first. Then they could arrest him. The employer had no choice but to fire the accused at once. If they knowingly allowed a criminal to continue working for them, bad things could easily happen.  So basically, the police lied to me, and there is a burglar roaming around somewhere because the police are incompetent."

baltimore,3caul3,XxCloudSephiroth69xX,5,Mon Jul 6 23:38:05 2015 UTC,Welcome to my life. As a private investigator in Baltimore I deal with this every day. Southern and Southwest are the only ones I know that close like that. It's actually more like 7-9 most days. You have to go around back at Southern if you want to talk to an officer. Security may be an excuse at SW but they're behind bullet proof glass at Southern.  Don't waste your time leaving a message or business card for an officer. Every district is supposed to have a Communications Sgt . If you absolutely need to speak to a specific officer emailing that Sgt is about your only hope.
baltimore,3caul3,ccemtp,7,Thu Jul 9 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"About 4 years ago, my company re-located my office from eastern Baltimore to the inner harbor. As a way to try and save money on parking, I would park on S. Eden and Eastern. One Friday evening, I had to work later than usual. I walked to my where I parked and found some shattered glass and an empty space. I called 911 and reported the issue, then called my wife to come pick meet me. At the time, we lived in White Marsh. She was able to make to me in less time on a Friday evening in October than it took the cops to come to the scene of the crime, which was less than a mile from the nearest police station. When they finally did get there, I was met with apathy and annoyance from the officers.  I waited for my wife for 45 minutes and another 15 minutes after that for the police to arrive. It took them ~one hour to come and get my statement. The police in the city are a joke. They don't give a fuck about serving or protecting; just getting their paycheck and eventual pension.  I say this as the son in law to a retired police officer from Baltimore."
baltimore,3caul3,XxCloudSephiroth69xX,4,Mon Jul 6 21:00:25 2015 UTC,"In case you were wondering why it sometimes takes police a long time to get to certain calls, it's because 911 does not work like a deli.  Calls don't get dispatched in the order they are received.  They are prioritized according to a number of factors.  Serious crimes (murders, shootings, stabbings, robberies, etc.) always get dispatched first, then ""in progress"" calls (disorderly conduct, trespassing, shoplifting, etc.), then lastly the ones for reports (burglaries, stolen autos, larcenies, destruction of property, etc.).  Before the recent schedule change, there were typically a total of 4 officers handling a sector and 3/4 sectors in a district...so when it gets busy it takes time.  This department has had manpower issues for years.  I understand it sucks waiting, but the police arriving quickly isn't going to get you your car back quicker."

baltimore,3caul3,stennyfrigs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say.   There's more most of the time.  There's another shift that was added and there's a lot of overlap in officers who are working, so during peak hours on certain days it could be up to 8 or more in each sector.  This depends on a lot of factors though.  Injuries, suspensions, vacations, transfers, etc. tend to build up and leave patrol shorter some days still.  A lot of the drug units (and every unit, really) were scaled back to put more officers in patrol."
baltimore,3caul3,XxCloudSephiroth69xX,4,Tue Jul 7 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately most districts just don't have the manpower right now to keep someone at the front desk for 24 hours.

baltimore,3caul3,jvnk,4,Wed Jul 8 05:08:22 2015 UTC,"This argument rests on the notion that he needed to defend himself. In this case, and as is with most muggings, they are more interested in relieving you of your possessions and being on their way. He gave up his bike and was unharmed. Contrast this with producing a gun before 15 individuals already in the process of attempting to mug you. All it takes is one miscalculation and you're dead or mortally injured, perhaps even by your own weapon.... over a bike that has zero resale value.  It may be beneficial in some scenarios, but the vast majority of people will never be in a situation where a gun means the difference between life and death. The idea that you should be rolling around strapped in preparation for such an event strikes me as flawed and frankly counterproductive. The logical conclusion of that train of thought is to practice MAD in our daily lives and interactions with strangers in public. Is that the kind of ""security"" we should be striving for?"
baltimore,3caul3,Slowhand09,4,Mon Jul 6 16:12:46 2015 UTC,Wrong.  This argument rests on the notion he should have the CHOICE to decide to defend himself regardless of the odds.  The state should not make him a victim just because the thugs decide to.  Your logic basically tells everybody to just surrender to criminals.  Hypothetical question: your mom/sister/girlfriend/wife is armed and able to defend herself.  A group of criminals approach and indicate they are going to sexually assault her.  Should she defend herself?  Should she have the choice? edit: I was a boy scout.  Be Prepared was our motto.

The state should not make him a victim just because the thugs decide to.    Nope, the gun laws in this area in particular has nothing to do with my point, and as far as I can tell had nothing to do with your own per your original comment.    Your logic basically tells everybody to just surrender to criminals.    No, my logic is that statistically speaking, the necessity of a gun is vanishingly small and that need only continues to shrink. In this case, introducing a gun into a situation has a higher chance of making things worse than making them better... and again, in this case, it was over a worthless bicycle.  I know it feels good to imagine being armed in such a scenario, but the reality is far more mundane. I do fully acknowledge the utility of guns, as per my earlier comment. I just think we should be looking at root causes and not reactionary measures like being armed at all times."

It could also potentially bring bodily harm to himself and/or get himself tied up in legal disputes over a bike.

You can be wealthy, healthy, white, male, educated, well raised, genetically gifted, etc. All examples of people who are more privileged than other people, it just so happens that white privilege is one of the more powerful privileges and that most of it is based off of slavery and genocide during the early days. Being good looking gives you certain privileges, for you to deny the fact that privileges exist is indicative of you being unaware. It's just a reality in this country, but we will root it out. Acknowledging it exists doesn't perpetuate racism, revising history like Texas is doing is what does that. It does away with all history of how we got to this point and why we have the problems we do. It doesn't provide people with the context for why things are the way they are, and that leads to racism. When people grow up not knowing about Jim Crow and the elimination Era or the Drug War and all they see is blacks at the bottom of the barrel they become racist.   You can try and act like blacks don't face systemic racism unlike any other group, like Texas does, or you can hop on the reality train and lend a helping hand."

Just because wealth happens to be unequally distributed according to race doesn't mean it is best to actively try to reverse it by discriminating against white people no matter how wealthy they are.

Without fixing the mistakes we made in the past that betray those ideals, we are not the America we say we are or the America we were born to be. We are a lie.  It wasn't a few decades ago, blacks have been the most consistently and harshly terrorized and oppressed people since we became America. What you call favoritism I call atoning for our Father's sins(against America) that handicap us today.  Other individuals that you speak of don't have the obstacles that blacks do, and they likely never will. What we can do is help bring balance and equality to the black community and become the America we are supposed to and claim to be.   Not to mention that as a country that still runs on white supremacy we show favoritism to anyone who can pass as white anyway. People like you think it's over, it's not over till white supremacy is completely wiped away and we are all equals.

Racism is ""Discrimination or prejudice based on race."" I'll shop at this place because someone of a certain race owns it or in the alternative avoid this one seems to fit the bill. Maybe we should make maps of businesses owned by white, Korean, Chinese, Pakistani etc so we can all only shop from places that someone of our race owns.

These people abused you for years and you're naive enough to think they will immediately start to break bread with you? It will be different this time? Get real man. You don't need their help. Turn Baltimore into the next Hong Kong.
baltimore,3cgi2r,WalterMerrick,-11,Tue Jul 7 20:06:49 2015 UTC,So let me get this straight... you'd rather see Baltimore become a dependent territory instead of striving for solutions to solve social and economic issues in America? You should move to Texas.
baltimore,3cgi2r,WalterMerrick,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Okay champ. Let me give you a snapshot of the type of people you would be working with to ""strive for solutions"".   Police Chief- Beholden to the Police Union, meaning drug legalization, reduction in # of police officers and stop and frisk are off the table. This would make the city more dangerous than it has to be and increase the cost of living as well. It would also increase arrests, making finding a job or profession more difficult for POC.   Mayor- They run the gambit here. O'Malley is a crook. He increased property taxes to absurd levels, set up a surveillance system that would make Stalin blush and locked up more people than Chairman Mao. In addition, he supported a minimum wage, increasing unemployment, cost of goods and services which would of course go to pay city worker salaries, 2/3's of which are unnecessary. This also hurt POC the most. Dixon is a thief and the new Mayor, Notorious SRB, said she won't even protect private property in the event of a riot. Insurers are already starting to cancel coverage here in light of this response. Not to mention the amount of people looking to get out of dodge now that they know property will not be protected by police. So long tax base and hello uncertainty. Maybe the police and Mayor should stop protecting us from ourselves, i.e. drug war, and start to do what they were hired to do, protect property and lives.   Teacher's Union- Overpaid babysitters who teach at schools with horrible graduation rates.   So tell me, how would you deal with these entrenched bureaucracies while drastically reducing government violence?"
baltimore,3cgi2r,wanderingman,-9,Tue Jul 7 20:50:25 2015 UTC,"Yea, so Texas is about 25 hours west. So If you leave now, you'd be able to find a bar seat next to someone that'll listen to your ""secession solutions"" and whatever else you find to be reasonable."
baltimore,3cgi2r,WalterMerrick,2,Tue Jul 7 21:09:28 2015 UTC,Of course you didn't refute my points so you deflect. Nice try slick. Never argue secessionist theory with someone whose family is Quebecois.

baltimore,3cbfup,baltimoresports,9,Mon Jul 6 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"So I've always been confused by this. Why is gentrification so bad?  I figure there are 3 main points of view on this.   Long term resident who makes less than the people moving in. Resident who moves into a gentrifying area early on. This also includes long term residents who can afford to live there after gentrification. Resident who moves in after gentrification is almost complete.   For person 3, they get to move to the neighborhood they want and it'll be pretty decent because gentrification has brought enough money and resources into the neighborhood so it's safe and desirable.  For person 2, they get to buy a cheap house and then have the equity in their house go up. Their net worth probably skyrockets. They've made a good investment.  For person 1, their house values go up (but any mortgages they have stay the same). Their property taxes go up, but I have to imagine cost of living doesn't go up that dramatically. In Baltimore your property taxes can only go up like 4% per year. Even so people could become unable to afford it. Luckily they should be able to sell their house for tons more than they paid for it. So they might be forced to move, but they'll be receiving a figurative boat load of cash to do so.  I guess it would suck for poor people who rent in the neighborhood. But over all it seems like a good thing to happen to neighborhoods, even for the people who have to move out."
baltimore,3cbfup,CrisisOfConsonant,4,Mon Jul 6 20:33:04 2015 UTC,"I think person 1 is where the issue lies. There are times when neigh orhoods gentrify and there are so many ""person 1's"" that are forced out the area loses its heritage and character. I am personally usually gor gentrification but it needs to be done carefully otherwise tj e city will end up being whitewashed and will be without any character."
baltimore,3cbfup,jabbadarth,0,Mon Jul 6 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't for person 1 in that case, the problem is the neighborhood looses some character. But in losing that character it tends to lose a bunch of crime and poverty as well. So I kind of view that as a wash (although I know others will view it differently)."
baltimore,3cbfup,CrisisOfConsonant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"The poverty doesn't get lost, it just gets moved to the periphery.  ""Out of sight, out of mind"" is not a good strategy."
baltimore,3cbfup,shroom_throwaway9722,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:37:20 2015 UTC,So it's better to be poor in one place than get a cash infusion and be mildly less poor in another place?  Not gentrifying doesn't make any one any less poor.

baltimore,3cbfup,shroom_throwaway9722,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:18:01 2015 UTC,I think gentrification by definition redefines communities. Just because the people who move into an area are different it doesn't mean they don't form a community.

baltimore,3cbfup,bmore,3,Tue Jul 7 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"What about renters who can't afford to buy, have rents skyrocket, and are forced into neighborhoods further from where they work, perhaps forcing them to buy a car they can't afford or ride public transit system the state refuses to invest in?  Generally I agree gentrification is a good thing, but this fourth person seems to get screwed."
baltimore,3cbfup,CrisisOfConsonant,3,Tue Jul 7 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"I kind of think renters are always screwed. And them having to live in a shitty neighborhood, well if the neighborhood wasn't gentrified it would have been a shitty neighborhood as well, so there's really no difference.  And I don't have a lot of experience with gentrification outside of Baltimore. But if you want to find a shitty neighborhood with depressed rents, you can find them all over Baltimore. I'd say you're never more than 5 blocks from the ghetto in Baltimore. So there'd have to be a hell of a lot more concentration of gentrification before forcing a long commute would be an issue."

But having seen what happened to the upper west side, then park slope over my lifetime, I understand.. What starts out as ""secret"" and ""a find"" becomes bougie, snobby, and overpriced pretty quickly... And suddenly it's easy to understand why people hate hipsters.  This is such an interesting collision point-- race, class, and society..and the change an influx in capital can bring to an area."
baltimore,3cbfup,Joker1337,17,Mon Jul 6 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"Nope, the hipster hate still makes no sense. I've lived in Baltimore city for nearly 30 years and it's the yuppies and hipsters transforming Baltimore for the better; not those alleged ""long term residents"" who are being displaced. If they are long term residents, why aren't they cashing in on the increase in property values? They must not be too ""long term"" if they don't have a mortgage here."
baltimore,3cbfup,spalunk,4,Mon Jul 6 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm sure several of my neighbors who have been there for decades rent the house they live in (living paycheck to paycheck.)  It would suck for them to watch the neighborhood improve and then suddenly find they cannot make rent anymore."
baltimore,3cbfup,ATRIOHEAD,10,Mon Jul 6 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"Everyone, including yuppies and hipsters, knows that a downside of renting is that your rent can be raised beyond what you can afford. That's a caveat of being a renter. Landlords can also sell their property to someone who doesn't want to rent it out. That's how it works."
baltimore,3cbfup,ATRIOHEAD,2,Mon Jul 6 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone knows it, that's very true.    I'm saying that poorer people cannot always buy a house. They move into a house, they build a semi-safe neighborhood by chance / grit / values.  Then sometimes, richer people come into the neighborhood  because it is a safe community which is underpriced and buy it up.  Then those poorer people are driven out by rising rents."
baltimore,3cbfup,spalunk,6,Mon Jul 6 18:36:26 2015 UTC,I don't know that the scenario is quite how you're describing it. It seems that many of these communities improve despite their long term residents rather than because of them.

baltimore,3cbfup,spalunk,4,Mon Jul 6 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"debate of the times:   should the gov't draw the line at consumer protection, or be even more active and step in to somehow establish or provide long-time-consumers w/ rights that historically (and economically, per the law) only belong to those who take risks by investing in property?    i, for one, saw the writing on the wall and stopped renting years ago (a decision that has paid back just like i thought it would) in order to buy what i could afford. not all people are able to see the situation from above however. kind of a catch-22 no? i can def sympathize w/ these families, but would i vote in their favor on keeping them around if it were my neighborhood? to me, the trend says ""no"", and especially when considering the effectively one-way nature of ""gentrification"" as we've seen over the last few decades."
baltimore,3cbfup,ampetertree,2,Mon Jul 6 18:30:21 2015 UTC,excellent point; long-term residency just doesn't pay dividends like ownership does.

baltimore,3c8xz8,shamrockjew,9,Mon Jul 6 01:38:15 2015 UTC,"Well, they are right in AAVE. Have you tried explaining that while ""I be doing"" is ok when talking with their friends, they should use the more traditional forms when in school?"
baltimore,3c8xz8,spkr4thedead51,13,Mon Jul 6 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"Of course. I talk about how terribly I spell, speak, and write when I'm not ""on the job"" as a teacher. Nothing wrong with speaking in a dialect. However, we also talk about the socioeconomic, historical, and cultural issues that led to ""AAVE"" and how that if I say ""Start your warm up"" and a student says ""I'm is!"" there is a lot of history that led up to that moment."

baltimore,3c9fid,nonamebeats,2,Mon Jul 6 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"I've received invaluable assistance from a local organization called Public Justice, in regards to similar disputes. They act as a free go-between from you to a lawyer, so there can be significant turn around time, but its more than worth it. From my experience, you are in the right and your landlord is 100% wrong, possibly to the tune of multiple times your original security deposit. Don't take my word for it though. Their website is: http://www.publicjustice.org/  edit: reading this back, it sounds really weirdly canned/infomercially, but it is sincere. I have no affiliation with this organization other than being helped by them. Because of recent events, I had to do a lot of research regarding landlord/tenant law in both MD and Baltimore specifically. Many Baltimore City statutes supersede state law and are even more in favor of tenants. Googling something like ""Baltimore city tenant's rights"" will yield many useful resources. If you are interested, I will go back and find specific websites that were useful to me.

I say this because much like Preakness, the city knows that Moonrise brings people not from the area to Park Heights so they ramp up police presence.  And Park Heights isn't that bad to begin with honestly. It's your typical inner city neighborhood that's been impacted by generations of drug abuse, low enployment, housing vacancies. That may ward off many people to enter there but it's not like your car will be stolen if you leave it there all day. That being said, I would park in one of the pay lots at Pimlico because that's probably easier anyway.   As for hotel, if you are willing to spend a little you can't go wrong with getting a hotel downtown and enjoying the water and theven surrounding attractions. If you don't want to do that, I would get a hotel in Owings Mills or Pikesville up in the county. They are close to the venue  (ten minutes or so to Pimlico) but are located in the County where it's super safe and much cheaper than downtown. Randlestown would be fine too. All close and safe.   Whatever you do, stay a day before/after and go around town. Inner Harbor, etc. You can find more info on the side bar. If you take Park Heights south from Pimlico you'll run right into the areas affected by the turmoil a few weeks ago. Mandawmin Mall, CVS, etc. Nothing to worry about there like what happened but they are rough neighborhoods. It might be interesting from a perspective standpoint since you are from out of town. I would check them out and see that Westside isn't the Gaza strip like they'll show you on Fox/CNN  Enjoy Baltimore!"

We need a full reformation of the American police system if we are ever going to end the abuses against the public it's sworn to protect.

baltimore,3c1i0p,theevamonkey,7,Tue Jul 7 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"Look, to be perfectly honest, I'm not on anybody's side on this, as I see it, there are shitty cops who exceed their authority, and there are shitty citizens who have taken advantage of the situation to loot and steal.  I saw some people saying that it was fake, and some saying it was real.  I don't believe everything I read on the internet, not even from news sources, not even from reputable news sources.  Remember when the Washington Post ran a lengthy, detailed article with the other passenger in the van, who claimed Freddie Gray deliberately banged his head against the van walls, only to have it come out that it was completely false?  Remember when everyone reported that Gabrielle Giffords was dead?  Remember when everyone was looking for the DC sniper in a white van?  News gets things wrong.  The image looked suspicious, and as I see it, given the events, and because Photoshop is a thing, I see it more likely that someone would doctor an image in this way to stir up anger with police, rather than police officers being dumb enough to detail their van in a manner that's just begging for a huge controversy and/or someone's immediate firing.  So, all that being said, I'm skeptical about something like this, so as I do have a very particular set of skills, I took a close look at the picture and found two things that suggested to me that the image might be fake.  First, anything a first semester drawing student could tell that the lettering does not sit properly in 3 dimensional space.  Either it's very crooked or it's badly done, because it has a completely different vanishing point from the rest of the door.  Secondly, I quickly put it into an image analyzer to see if it could tell that it was added to the original photo, and while it was not conclusive, it did find a bit more artifacting around the lettering than what typical compression would cause.  TLDR, it seems very illogical to me, and there are some details of the image that make me question its authenticity, despite WBAL's report verifying its authenticity."

baltimore,3bzkwc,finsterallen,29,Fri Jul 3 12:46:45 2015 UTC,"..and I wonder what Comcast got in return for giving Dixon's sister business. Highlights of piece:   People remember the theft of gift cards meant for underprivileged kids at Christmas, the one offense for which Ms. Dixon was found guilty, but that was hardly the only thing she did wrong. Here's a brief recap:  •In 2006, when she was City Council president, Ms. Dixon publicly pressured Comcast to steer more business to a company called Utech. What she did not mention — or disclose in city ethics forms — was that her sister worked for Utech, which turned out to be a sham minority business that did not actually perform the work it was assigned on city development deals.  •For six years, starting just after she became council president in 1999, Ms. Dixon employed her former campaign chairman to manage the council's computer system. He was paid at least $600,000, most of it without a contract. Ms. Dixon's staff instructed him to submit invoices in amounts below the $5,000 threshold that would have required them to be approved in public at the Board of Estimates.  •In 2003 and 2004, Ms. Dixon carried on a romantic relationship with developer Ronald Lipscomb, who was married, and she received thousands of dollars in gifts from him even as his firm sought tax breaks from the city. The two went on lavish vacations together, including a trip to New York just hours after Ms. Dixon voted to support a tax break for one of his company's biggest projects."

When I say world class I mean the upper echelon of legendary DJs it was somewhat more electronic oriented but think Deep Dish and Josh Wink along side Sven Vath, Paul Van Dyke, Derrick Carter, DJ Sneak, Cajmere/Green Velvet. It gets deeper though. Saturday nights often were headlined by people like DJ Spen, Teddy Douglas, Karizma, DJ Pope and Oji. Baltimore was going on back then. Prior to that Baltimore has Club Fantasy, O'Dells, Cignel. All were ground breaking clubs where people actually danced all night instead of taking selfies. We had some other amazing less known DJs some you can still find and you may know of them Michael Joyner, DJ Mandrill, and one of my personal favorites Marc Allen who is probably the best DJ from Baltimore, Jerome Hicks, Michael Malpit(DC guy but played up here also amazing)  then there's Baltimore club music which is now New Jersey club. Baltimore has such a rich history of dance music. I could go on about this for months."

The gay friendly Grand Central has a lot of club dancing space (as did?/does? Club Hippo), also in Mt Vernon.

I rented from the  Enterprise located at Eastern Ave and S Central, one in Ellicott City, and another at BWI.  Out of the 3, the airport was cheapest.  I only rent Enterprise because they seem to have the best deal. You can see for yourself by getting rates from Enterprise from different locations and you'll see the prices vary.   Lastly, you can rent from Dollar Rent a Car and use their Lock and Low program.  They chose the car but you pay a low flat rate."

baltimore,3bxhii,TK2895,7,Sun Jul 5 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"Police enforcing anti social behavior ordinances, e.g., double parking unless ACTIVELY unloading/loading a vehicle and for an allotted time(s), littering fines, loitering fines, reckless driving/speeding, disorderly conduct (i.e., kids running rampant, acting a fool).  A comprehensive and thorough plan for the uptick in property crime, with an emphasis on vehicle and home burglaries.  Increased code enforcement re: weeds, trash and clutter in backyards and alleys.  Get cops out of their cars and supervisors off the desk. We are in desperate need of an engaged community policing effort.  Solar lights in PP for after dark safety.  Light a fire under Spinello's ass."
baltimore,3bxhii,DoFunStuff,6,Fri Jul 3 12:26:11 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more with you on the need for consistent, fair, and active enforcement of these and other ordinances. (One of my biggest pet peeves is when I'm driving home from work downtown and people are parked in the left lane of Pratt Street, between President's and Broadway, and no one is enforcing the ""No Parking"" signs.The traffic and safety issues it causes are enormous.) Following many of the neighborhood groups on social media, I can't believe the recent increase in property crime and the complete disregard and apparent feeling of impunity that these criminals have. Security cameras and other deterrents do nothing to stop them. I have had my own vehicle broken into twice and feel anxiety leaving my home for more than a few days (for vacation, etc.). I think that REAL community policing is one component of a larger plan to combat this uptick.  Code enforcement is a no-brainer and the most important and basic way to better our neighborhoods. I'd hope that very few in our community enjoy having unattractive, unsanitary, and unappealing neighborhoods. My solution to this begins first with organizing cleanups, not just in the nicest and most affluent areas of our community, but in all areas of the district. My wife and I plan on cleaning up the area surrounding the 7-11 on Broadway this week because nobody else will do it. I think that after we create standards for every community and show that they are realistic and beneficial, codes will be respected and enforcement will become meaningful to all residents. Maybe I'm a dreamer... haha. Real community policing. Not community policing for show and damage control. I've heard some point to the apparent difficulty and inconvenience of requiring police to do 15-30 minutes or more of walking neighnorhoods they police and meeting with residents. To be frank, I think that these excuses are absurd. I could go on for days about this one, but, in short, I want to know and trust those officers policing my neighborhood. I know that we have a few bad officers on the force, but I also know that some of them feel overworked and unsupported. I know (or hope) that they want to good and want reforms that enhance their relationship with the communities they serve. We have people all over our communities (cops, politicians, developers) that are out of touch and blinded by self-interest. Solar lights are a great solution that should have been implemented years ago. Oh, yes."

Harsh federal sentencing guidelines and the lack of parole in the federal system also mean they have a lot of leverage in plea deals.

baltimore,3btyhj,eternallurker,4,Thu Jul 2 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"Well you're right. They are two very different kinds of arson, governed by different laws. The big wildcard as I see it is whether they decide that CVS was ""occupied"" or not, which will mean the court may have to decide if other looters and rioters were occupants in a public building or not. If not, I can't see the punishments being even remotely comparable. Both are likely to be in federal court. And assuming it's one guy or group responsible for the church arsons, he's looking at multiple counts. On top of that, he's facing a stiffer punishment both because speculation at least puts this as an easy hate crime and because Congress passed a law in 1996 adding stiffer penalties for burning churches."

baltimore,3bwc2g,flyingturdmonster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking for visibility, but I know that in Virginia (where the law is far more favorable to landlords than tenants) that the end date for a fixed-term lease (any lease with an explicit start and end date, as opposed to a month-to-month) is considered de-facto notice to vacate. Any lease clause requiring advance notice of any amount is unenforceable. It is not in the statutes explicitly, but there is case law that directly addresses it. Given how tenant-friendly Maryland law is, I'd look to see both in statute and case law whether his notice to vacate clause is actually enforceable."

baltimore,3bwc2g,GilroyMD,4,Thu Jul 2 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"60 days isn't uncommon, actually, because he can't legally evict you without 60 days notice in most cases.  Your best option is to hustle and find a replacement tenant, because he can't collect double rent. Otherwise, you can just not pay the last month's rent; you'll probably get hit with some small fees but if you've got a full month's security deposit, it'll pay for the outstanding rent balance in the end.

When I really realized how far apart our cultures were-- how we didn't have a similar ""fundamental American"" culture, it really becomes easy to see how divided this country is.  The point is not the black and white, hipster/young urban poor person thing.. The point is understanding how different cultures really don't understand each other-- But that bridge is not uncrossable-- And that does take guts and hard work, and yeah, I'll take a cookie for that.  Even your different response to this than most (incredibly positive) shows how far apart we are. If everyone were to take this level of effort to bridge cultural divides, we could have much greater understanding of each other.  But snarky comments like yours are just as much a part of the problem as anything.  Do you want to continue being a hater, or do you want to help the world?"
baltimore,3bvtkr,69chainz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"i just don't understand what you are suggesting. yes, there is a divide.

baltimore,3bvtkr,donald-rump,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"I am saying it's harder to be friendly to neighbors when they are very different from you culturally and class wise-- there's distrust and just simple differences and fear that take work to overcome, and yeah, I think that's hard for people c2015 with people who are ""like"" them, let alone people who aren't.     don't you think you should always be friendly to your neighbors, regardless of whether you live in baltimore or not?   This is a straw man argument. I never said otherwise, and it's harder than simply ""just doing it"" you know?  It's even harder when the people aren't like you-- and that's where the most animosity in this country arises-- between people who don't understand each other's context, be it religious/not, black/white, rich/poor, apple/android, whatever.  Crossing those divides in understanding is the hard work-- and yes, being friendly beyond being polite is in a small way crossing that bridge, and I believe something that will yield dividends.  I have to take solace in the fact that the overwhelming response to what I wrote/said has been very positive-- over 1200 people read that post, and 90% of the feedback has been positive feedback.

How is that not you saying ""My mere presence is better for 'those people' than actually providing food, shelter, medical care, legal aid, supplemental education to people who would not otherwise have it""?   Here's a challenge for you: why don't you go to soup kitchen or needle exchange, talk to the folks there ""like people"", and ask if they'd rather have access to those services, or have some white guy move onto their block because it's cheap and he thinks it's a less ""waspy"" form of tourism, talk to them occasionally, and blog about how good it is that the talks to them like ""people"".  Let us know how that goes.   Seriously dude, I know you're new to Baltimore, but this comes across as ""There are no actual systemic problems in Baltimore in need of actual solutions; the real problem is that people who live there haven't met me yet, or had me blog about meeting them.  Once I talk to them like people and tell the internet about it, they're realize that things like the complete collapse of blue collar industry, systemic racially based police abuse, the highest heroin addiction rate in the developed world and a school system that essentially fails the vast majority of its students are in fact, not real problems and were caused only by a lack of conversations with bloggers."""

That's what makes this hard.    you look like a tourist while living in the ""gutter""   To be honest, I kind of am-- because I am the kind of person who wants to see everything and experience lots of cultures-- I was always a tourist stuck ""at home"" which is why I strained at the leash so much.  I love learning about other cultures, and that doesn't mean waspy white person going on a 10 day european holiday in the tourist capitals and calling himself ""multicultural.""   You are promoting the young white liberal fallacy-- move to a ""safe"" area and then volunteer. You are reenforcing social boundaries, and coming in as a ""white horse"" volunteer.  I argue that moving next to people who are not like you, introducing yourself, and just learning about each others worlds as much as possible is just as, if not more helpful to society overall.  I think ""volunteer a couple days a month"" is far more ""touristy"" than living a few doors down from drug dealers, and then talking to them like people.  Yes, I am making myself a bit of a target.  Yes, I have an alarm on my house. Yes, I am careful about exactly where I go at night, alone.  I may not be able to stay here for a long time--my girlfriend doesn't feel completely comfortable yet, and I can't blame her-- people look at her a lot differently than they look at me. There's plenty of work to do when it comes to respect for women from all cultures, but especially in poor communities.  Ultimately, I truly believe that being myself and living next to people who are not like me, being nice, learning about them and what they care about-- who they are-- will benefit all of us, even if its just for a short time.  And you know what? If the absolute worst happened-- If that small but not impossible possibility occurred--If we were killed during a home invasion because we ""looked soft"" and the alarm company sent people to the house only to find our dead bodies, then I will have died living in the world I want to live in-- then so be it.  That's what's under every warning like this-- poor black people could rob/hurt/kill us, right?  Yes, the statistics show the increased likelihood of that-- I'm not stupid. I have seen a lot of race and violence shit first hand.   But I think Americans let fear guide us far too much, and that's as much of a problem as anything else in this country."

I disagree with this point. These kids need more than a white friend.  They need someone to help them build a marketable resume. They need someone to help them practice for interviews. They need someone to coach them on what to wear to interviews. They need mentors, not just a friendly white guy chatting with them on his stoop while living the life they know they have no chance of attaining. That's not helping them move up and out of the depressing and dire state of poverty, its just showing off."

Good area, getting better, close to Hopkins, and you can still find cheap places that either need a bit of TLC or full reno on the cheap. Hampden is also a very nice place with plenty of affordable housing still, and I think that area is going no where but up.

I saw on FB and Twitter on the final night of the curfew a request for a social experiment. Two groups were African American, one was at Penn & North, the second at Greenmount & Eager by the jail. A third group was all white and was located in Hampden.  When the curfew began, police immediately rushed into the two groups of blacks in full riot gear and made arrests. However with the group of whites in Hampden, police there gave multiple warnings to that group that the curfew had begun and if they did not leave, arrests would be made however the officer in charge told this group that the police did not want to make any arrests. When there was a very small group left and they were planning on leaving to go home, the police asked if they would like a ride home.

So I was there when the first policer officer came up to say they didn't want to arrest anyone, and he did ask everyone to go home.  Some protesters were slightly vocal, but all in all it was very respectful from both sides.    I started walking home around 9:55, and saw a number of large police vans head to the protest (presumably to transport the protesters to jail).  I assumed a few of the protesters planned to get arrested on principal, but by the time I made it home, I saw the protest was over and there were no arrests.

baltimore,3broiu,TheBaltimoron,7,Thu Jul 2 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"I was quite surprised to see how popular Sheila Dixon is in Baltimore City as of this year, 2015.  I was in Sandtown-Winchester for a march in honor of Freddie Gray and protesting against police brutality and Sheila Dixon was there, she was immediately bombarded by local community members urging her to run for Mayor, they told her they do not want Rawlings-Blake re-elected."
baltimore,3broiu,ksweeley,13,Wed Jul 1 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think this has as much to do with how much Dixon is liked as it does with how much SRB is loathed.

baltimore,3broiu,joedeertay,12,Wed Jul 1 17:34:56 2015 UTC,It really is that Dixon is liked. She didn't become mayor by accident; she'd been a fixture in city politics for 20 years and people loved her. Gift cards were never going to change that.
baltimore,3broiu,todareistobmore,8,Wed Jul 1 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"Dixon was a better mayor than SRB currently is.  Dixon has always had strong ties with Baltimore's diverse black community; SRB seems to disdain the poor/working class.  Yeah, Dixon was in bed with developers (they were the only money game in town at that time), but she was a far better leader and people person than SRB has proved to be.  Dixon brought Baltimore profitable single stream recycling, bicycle lanes adn the Circulator; SRB gave Baltimore the Grand Prix (loser), HorseShoe Casino (loser) and the riots & curfew (real big loser)."

Her administration was implementing programs that helped the entire city, especially the high poverty areas of the city.  I must say looking back, the timing of the discovery of Dixon stealing gift cards was pretty suspect to me because Dixon was truly at a high-point as Mayor, a.) crime was noticeably lower and b.) the programs she implemented as Mayor was showing results and benefits that helped the city as a whole."
baltimore,3broiu,ksweeley,22,Wed Jul 1 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"You are confirming my beliefs though. You are operating on the mantra of ""she just stole some gift cards but the rest of the stuff she did was awesome"". But its not that she just swiped a few subway cards on her way out of a store one day.  She solicited the cards under the guise they would be used to help the needy, aka, lied that she was helping ""poor"" people for her own gains. Manipulated financial statements by not disclosing the donations. Violated economic policy by ""misappropriating funds"".  She lied to the public, lied to her own office and lied to the rest of the city government. If there was a candidate with no prior record of office who did all these things, would you vote for them? Hell no, you'd think they are a scumbag. But since their are not better options, she is the default choice.   Classic giant douche vs. Turd sandwich situation."

baltimore,3broiu,ksweeley,3,Wed Jul 1 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"Your comparing apples to oranges.

I liked what he had to say during the protests and he seemed to genuinely care about his district and the Baltimore community as a whole.   Seemed like a good guy. If Scott doesn't run then I would expect Dixon to win easily. I haven't seen anyone mention it here but I thought I remembered from when she was mayor that she actually grew up in a rougher area of Baltimore and that's one of the reasons why she connects well with people from those areas vs. SRB who, as others have mentioned, views those folks as a nuisance etc."

baltimore,3bw8zl,locker1313,11,Thu Jul 2 18:15:12 2015 UTC,They didn't win the GRANT  They got an appropriation to APPLY for the grant.  The time that residents would have to move is irrelevant since they haven't RECEIVED the grant.  This is a non-issue.

As far as developing Baltimore, I think she's been a plus for the city.  Even things that are considered knocks against her (Grand Prix losing money, Horseshoe), at least she was trying and wasn't (as far as we know) corrupt about it.  She was dealt horrific budget problems and all things considered navigated it as well as anyone else would have.  She also hit a lot of bad luck with the Democrats blowing the gubernatorial election (Hogan has no desire or motivation to help Baltimore out with funding).    Compare the feeling towards her if today we never have the riots (Gray's death is out of her control) and the state Red Line funding gets approved (Republican gets elected governor, out of her control)- it's a very different world for SRB's popularity.  Nature of politics.      My point is, now that my emotions and anger over the riots are over (I was screaming for her to step down)- she might honestly be the best the city is going to do.

Dixon understood the importance of quality of life issues and cut through the government red tape better than most other mayors. She didn't put up with nonsense.

baltimore,3bt3j5,UmbrellaCo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:06:16 2015 UTC,It's the cutting down part that would be the issue. Not replanting. I'm assuming the tree is on city property (or right of way) so cutting it down would be similar to cutting down a tree in the park.   It's likely one of those rules on the books in case someone gets any bright ideas. Or perhaps somebody did cut down a tree on public property at one time.
baltimore,3bt3j5,KingBooRadley,8,Thu Jul 2 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"You can get it replaced for free.  Treebaltimore.org has a form that you can  submit and your existing tree pit will be replanted.

Drivers will be paying less to use bridges, tunnels and roads on Wednesday. The $6 cash toll to cross the Bay Bridge will drop to $4.  Many of the other discounts taking effect will require an E-Z Pass. For example, the discount of using the pass will go from 10 percent to 25 percent for the Baltimore Harbor and Fort McHenry tunnels. That discount also will apply to the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge.  Meanwhile, a sales tax on gasoline will increase from 2 percent to 3 percent.

They'd put it into something to benefit the whole state, like highways or some shit"
baltimore,3bqo8a,CaptInsane,21,Wed Jul 1 12:47:27 2015 UTC,It's almost like a strong Baltimore City improves the entire state.   Weakest chain in the link kind of thing.
baltimore,3bqo8a,Keedy_Black_AMA,-6,Wed Jul 1 13:03:23 2015 UTC,"The whole light rail system is a useless piece of shit though. It's slower than driving, even in heavy traffic. Try going from Hunt Valley to downtown; it'll take you over an hour on the light rail. The city needs a real metro system, like DC or NY"
baltimore,3bqo8a,Nintendoholic,26,Wed Jul 1 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"DC metro area has 5.8 million residents.   NYC metro area has 20.1 million residents and the highest rate of public transit riders in the country.   Boston metro area has 6 million people.   Baltimore Metro area has 2.5 million.   Let's ignore the fact that driving from Hunt Valley into downtown likely takes 45 minutes each way during rush hour due to congestion. But you're paying for convenience. Gas alone is going to be what a monthly light rail pass would cost and riding a train is far from an active activity like driving. You could read a book, get some work done, or just relax. Add insurance, cost of a personal vehicle, and repairs you're paying more than you think.   Baltimore doesn't need a real metro system. They need an appropriate public transit network that's flexible and can evolve with an a transforming city. I believe for the city itself light rail is a great answer to that. If light rail is so shitty as a technology why is DC building the H St. Corridor? Why is Boston adding onto the green line in Somerville? Why is Portland, OR adding a light rail line to it's existing system?  I would agree that light rail is a poor choice as a technology to reach a far suburb like Hunt Valley. That doesn't make the entire system shit though."
baltimore,3bqo8a,CaptInsane,14,Wed Jul 1 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"Everyone agrees that a full-fledged, multi-line Metro system would be great for Baltimore. However, nobody wants to 1) pay for it, 2) deal with the traffic/noise during construction, or 3) let ""those people"" have easy access to their neighborhoods"
baltimore,3bqo8a,bmore,-4,Wed Jul 1 13:56:44 2015 UTC,"They still have that access with the light rail and buses, even in places like Hunt Valley"
baltimore,3bqo8a,aresef,15,Wed Jul 1 14:07:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that line was originally conceived as real subway and a direct connection from Towson through Downtown to BWI. Racist Baltimore Countians prevented it, leaving us with the on-the-cheap line we have now."
baltimore,3bqo8a,theartfuldubber,6,Wed Jul 1 13:30:01 2015 UTC,"The light rail system is incredibly useful. I live in Mount Washington, have to get to Penn Station every morning to go to work in DC. Even if I had to pay for the light rail (MARC pass means I don't have to), it'd be worth it to get to a couple blocks walk from the station without having to risk missing my train due to backups or whatever the fuck on 83. Free parking and no traffic jams on light rail.  It also provides easy access to downtown, Camden Yards, RoFo Arena, Penn Station, Hunt Valley Town Center and BWI.  The city will never have a real, comprehensive subway system as planned in the 60s and 70s because of NIMBYists and the fact that so much underground space is spoken for, not to mention an obstinate governor's office determined to siphon not just transit, but road money from the city.  Does the metro/light rail system have problems? Yes. For one, there's not a very strong connection between the two. That's something the red line would have fixed. East and west Baltimore are left high and dry from much of the benefits of rail transit. You can't get from, say, Canton to Penn Station or Timonium to CMS with any kind of ease via transit. That's something the red line would have fixed. There are only two (arguably three) real connections to MARC, only two with anything to do with the Penn Line. The Red Line would have connected with the West Baltimore MARC and a now-in-question Bayview stop for the Penn Line."
baltimore,3bqo8a,stevetheserioussloth,2,Wed Jul 1 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"At Artscape two years ago my wife took the lightrail home since she didn't want to have to park downtown.  They stopped the service while she was still on the train, I left Artscape, rode my bicycle home to Hamilton, got in my car and went and picked her up. The light rail was down for another hour AFTER I picked her up. I LOVE using public transport in other cities, but in Baltimore it's a joke."
baltimore,3bqo8a,ATRIOHEAD,18,Wed Jul 1 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"It's almost like ... we need to invest in Baltimore's public transit instead of more highways.   I'm not saying the red line was problem free, but in a city where the east and west sides are increasingly isolated by self feeding cycles of poverty, it seems like any chance you can get to increase mobility for those without cars would create real facilitation for local businesses/local families. That's something that's foreign here in an age of dumping money into the harbor tourism projects."
baltimore,3bqo8a,CaptInsane,3,Wed Jul 1 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"access to the light rail (and service once on it) is truly so limited that too many of these types of stories abound for a city with such potential, IMO."

It went into extra innings so it was pretty late at night when he left. I think the light rail shuts down around 12 or 1 am. He was kicked off somewhere near Charles St (kicked off because the rail shut down for the night). Needless to say, he had to wait at this light rail station for over 45 minutes with drug dealers and hookers everywhere while his wife tried to find her way to it in the car (pre over-abundant GPS, but I think he had a cell phone)"

baltimore,3bqo8a,POZKNOWS,4,Wed Jul 1 16:02:36 2015 UTC,Because gas and roads are overly subsidized by the government and if we had to pay the true cost for these things we'd stop making such terrible planning and environmental decisions.
baltimore,3bqo8a,itsgametime,0,Wed Jul 1 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"Because fuel efficient cars use less gas and therefore we are all paying less total tax than we used to be.

baltimore,3bq403,paddlebawler,6,Wed Jul 1 12:07:40 2015 UTC,But it does greatly reduce the chance for criminals to become repeat offenders.
baltimore,3bq403,Boyhowdy107,3,Wed Jul 1 13:20:24 2015 UTC,I would imagine life in prison might do the same.
baltimore,3bq403,CatnipFarmer,5,Wed Jul 1 13:38:02 2015 UTC,Patrick Byers was already in jail when he ordered the murder of Carl Lackl  Jeffrey Wroten and David McGuinn were murdered by prisoners who were already incarcerated.   Being locked up didn't stop an inmate serving a life sentences from repeatedly stabbing a CO at North Branch a couple of years ago.  We also can't forget good ole Tavon White who ran a criminal enterprise from inside the Baltimore City jail.   Incarceration does not always protect us from the worst of the worst.
baltimore,3bq403,paddlebawler,3,Wed Jul 1 16:18:12 2015 UTC,Why continue to feed and support a person who would willingly do this to another person? What does their existence do for anyone in society?
baltimore,3bq403,Boyhowdy107,4,Wed Jul 1 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"Well, along those same lines you could ask why spend any more money than we have to on human filth? And the odd thing is, thanks to our criminal justice system, it costs more to execute than to lock them up and throw away the key. Appeals are expensive as hell, and whether we like it or not, we're unlikely to be able to streamline the process when you're talking about issuing the ultimate punishment.  Well, that and I really don't like knowing there are some cases out there (in light of new DNA evidence) where we've killed the wrong man. These assholes might be an open and shut case, but I'd rather us do away with it just to be safe, because inevitably through some clusterfuck of bad luck and shit lining up the wrong way, some innocent man (or woman, but probably man) might be killed who doesn't deserve it. Just my two cents, anyway."

Representatives of city agencies that work with Baltimore’s historical monuments and other public artwork, including the Department of Recreation and Parks, would also participate in the commission’s work, and legal research would be conducted to understand any requirements that might be associated with the items.   The commission will gather information on how other cities have handled similar questions regarding historic monuments – looking at Confederate-era statues in American cities, as well as elsewhere around the world. The commission will also invite public input to be part of its evaluation, perhaps through public hearings or a one-day symposium on monuments. Once the commission members are selected, Mayor Rawlings-Blake asked that it aim to report its recommendations within six months."

baltimore,3bo3rn,Bmorewiser,21,Tue Jun 30 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"Or about having memorials to celebrate men that fought also, to protect their homes from the Yankee invader.  It's also important to not let Baltimore forget its history.  In the Civil War, this city was part of the South - it just got occupied before it could do anything organized about it."
baltimore,3bo3rn,Bmorewiser,0,Tue Jun 30 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"That's some strong revisionist history there chief. There was no Yankee invasion. Baltimore is, and was, part of the United States. And just because Baltimore and most of Maryland was for the southern cause doesn't mean we should celebrate that fact and erect monuments to men who championed racist ideals and a treasonous cause."
baltimore,3bo3rn,Bmorewiser,16,Tue Jun 30 23:47:25 2015 UTC,No one can argue seriously that the Confederacy wasn't founded on racist principles. But the difference between treason and revolt is the winner.

baltimore,3bo3rn,yesitsmeitsok,-3,Wed Jul 1 11:29:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, we must celebrate the men who fought for the ideals of white supremacy and black subordination.  The German American Bund's heroes should be celebrated as well. They're part of Maryland history as well; many Germans lived in Baltimore and those that fought heroically in defense of their native lands should have monuments dedicated to them as well. Fritz Kuhn would be an excellent in Druid Hill Park.  While we're in the monument mood, we should also erect monuments to display the valor of the doctors of Hopkins who performed unethical human experimentation by purposely infecting people with STDs. They valiantly braved the perils of accidental infection to debilitate and sometimes kill people who thought they were receiving professional medical care. This is an important part of Baltimore history, too! :)"

baltimore,3bo3rn,Bmorewiser,-4,Wed Jul 1 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring why those statues were erected in the first place. It's not a straw man. Like it or not, many of those statues celebrate the men who fought to preserve the institution of slavery. They are not statues that condemn that fight, they were not erected as a solemn reminder of our racist heritage. You can't ignore those things because they are decidedly inconvenient facts and recreate a new narrative that the statues should exist for some vague historical reference. That dog don't hunt."
baltimore,3bo3rn,yesitsmeitsok,6,Wed Jul 1 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"But we are not arguing over if those statues should or should not have been erected in the past, we are arguing over if those historical monuments should or should not be destroyed in the present.

baltimore,3bo3rn,Bmorewiser,-4,Wed Jul 1 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"I don't see them as separate at all. You want these statues to remain for historical reasons, but want to gloss over the actual history of why they are there in the first place."
baltimore,3bo3rn,yesitsmeitsok,4,Wed Jul 1 16:07:06 2015 UTC,Absolutely not! Being able to talk about that history that put these monuments here is exactly why I want the statues to stay where they are.  I wish Baltimore never supported the Confederacy and these statues never existed in the first place. But I don't support removing them just because they represent something we wished never happened.
baltimore,3bo3rn,AnalogHumanSentient,0,Wed Jul 1 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"So you think there is a net positive to be drawn from having the statues exist because it generates conversation about the past. That's not an unreasonable thing.   But, many others want the statues gone because they have not, until today, generated any such discussion. Instead, they stand as unwanted reminders that many whites in the not so distant past (and perhaps today) feel allegiance to a racist ideology. In other words, it would be great if the statues did spark some commentary and debate and a better historical understanding of this city's past, but they don't.   They are inanimate statues. They just sit there and people attribute whatever meaning they wish. For many, perhaps even the majority of people, the meaning those statues hold is antithetical to progress and offensive."

He lost, and conceded to the North. One of the most stunning things he did post war was take communion with a  black man. Now, that may not see very progressive in our eyes, but in many churches in the south black people were not allowed communion. He was present when a black man approached the pastor and asked for it. No one moved. Robert E. Lee approached and took it simultaneously. That act helped the south on their path of healing. It was very heated in the south at this time. Now, I know this doesn't change the publics view on the General, but it might for you in a little way."

We aren't going to open a Khan amusement park and roller coaster anytime either. Rommel and Lee both drank from their parties metaphorical koolaid, no doubt. The difference between the two is that Lee was given respect and honors on both sides post war, to the point of monuments in the north. Things have changed and for the better.

They were Americans who took up arms against the United States.  Traitors, by definition.  Removal of statues that celebrate the slaver army, it's generals, it's ""glory in defeat,"" etc. are an obscenity that we've tolerated too long.  Relegate them to museums, where they belong."
baltimore,3bo3rn,FUCKING__GNOMES,5,Wed Jul 1 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"On the general white confederate soldier.   ...that many did not even consider slavery the major motivation to enlist, or even one at all.   Source  And as far as the traitors bit, yes thats what they were.  However in the still shaky union people were generally more allied to their state over the Union.  While they may have turned their back on the Union, many only went to serve the confederate army because they could not turn their back on their state, and thus staying ""loyal"". Look at  Winfield Scott Hancock and Lewis Armistead, they were both West Point graduates and nearly brothers yet because  Armistead was from NC he defected and fought for his state.  Neither of them wanted to fight each other but they had to follow their allegiances. Eventually Armistead would die at Gettysburg while Hancock lay wounded."
baltimore,3bo3rn,bmore,10,Tue Jun 30 23:47:05 2015 UTC,"Both are true.    My point is we have plenty of records supporting the argument that common soldiers fought in defense of slavery.  And of course, the army and ""nation"" they served, waged war explicitly for slavery.  I understand that many fought for other reasons, not saying all.  But the facts don't support the idea that slavery was a minor issue, rarely mentioned by common soldiers, etc.  That's just not true.  Similarly, many--most and especially at first--northerners did not fight because they were outraged by the moral obscenity of slavery.  But many did, too, and especially later.  It's complicated shit.  Regardless, the idea that we have to suffer the presence of monuments glorifying slavers---and there is no question about Taney, or Lee, etc.--is ludicrous in 2015.  Shall we also tolerate glorification of King George III?  No.  We put that stuff in museums.  edit:  verb tense, typo"

Admittedly, that was just a quick ballpark average of the percentage figures listed on the side. That said, as the main economic driver of the South, slavery benefited everyone, whether they owned slaves or not. I can assure you that no one was fighting for states' rights, unless you consider secession to be a right. A cursory reading of the declarations of secession can tell you that. In fact, the South was very much against the idea of states' rights as a concept, considering that one of the grievances include the failure of the federal government to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act in non-slave-owning states--effectively putting more value in federal laws over state laws.   It's time to put the old ""states' rights"" revisionist canard to rest. Those soldiers might have been conscripted, or following orders, but  no one was fighting for states' rights."

Because all of the fighting between the north and the south before the war about States rights was directly linked to the questions of slavery. There were other issues, like tariffs and taxes, but those issues related to the slavery-driven economics of the south versus the industrialized north. There have been efforts to paint the war as about other things, but really look no further than the constitutions of the southern states and you will see that Slavery, and the idea that blacks were less than human, was the driving force behind the war.  And even if Slavery only benefited then1%, we fight wars for those rich fucks still to this day. We didn't invade Iraq to spread democracy, eliminate wmd's or anything else. We went over there to secure oil. Same thing back then. The soldiers may have believed they were fighting for states rights, but they weren't.

Commanders told The Sun that they asked officers to ""hold the line"" as part of an overall deployment strategy to create a barrier between rioters and police operations and potentially vulnerable people. If officers broke lines during a face-off with rock-throwing protesters, for instance, they could be isolated and surrounded by mobs.

Batts said lives come before property - but whose lives were at risk during any of this? Besides police? The cops just stood in a line, they didn't protect anything but empty pavement and their own station as far as I remember (which actually did come under assault April 22 as we were reminded in the WBAL segment today).  So why weren't they ordered to actively engage in protecting property? Trying to hit hotspots before the critical mass led to looting? They surrounded the stadium to protect it.   I would love to hear from a military strategist on this. The looter forces were extremely mobile groups that could move a block in under a minute. Did they have a central command and control operation giving them orders? If not, couldn't they have been effectively disbursed with a few quick shows of force?   Once the looting started it seems to me they should have gone in rubber bullets blazing - unless they they actually thought they would be out-gunned in a massacre. Is it THAT bad in Baltimore?"

baltimore,3bn879,BmoreInterested,6,Tue Jun 30 16:19:18 2015 UTC,If we followed their entire tax structure the market would eliminate a bulk of the vacants on its own.  Unsurprisingly there's a big correlation with the gentrification within DC and them lowering property taxes to the lowest in the region.
baltimore,3bn879,slinkymaster,5,Tue Jun 30 17:03:53 2015 UTC,Same thing was said for the 1980s turnarounds of Boston and SF - lower tax rate to stop disinvestment and spur reinvestment.
baltimore,3bn879,46718,2,Tue Jun 30 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, do you have a source for this? My impression was that gentrification followed the massive amounts of money flowing into the federal gov't after 9-11."
baltimore,3bn879,ibbieta,3,Tue Jun 30 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"That may have had something to do with it, but I think the main cause was simpler than that.  Real estate values soared during the 00's, and the cities attracted a lot of interest from young first time buyers and real estate investors.  The whole reason I moved here back in '01 was because the living was so cheap here."

baltimore,3bn879,firingsolution,2,Wed Jul 1 03:07:17 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a loaded question. I mean you need to increase job opportunities, invest in infrastructure, improve police relations, promote positive family structures, etc.   Gentrification doesn't fix any of these things for the incumbent residents of the neighborhood. They just get pushed to another less desirable place to live, with the same issues they had before."
baltimore,3bn879,westsideozzie,3,Wed Jul 1 03:29:27 2015 UTC,"Not exactly... It's basically a tax on the land, and not structures.   You pay the same amount of taxes regardless of what's on the land.   Right now, people with vacants pay less, because the value of the house or building is factored into the tax rate, and a vacant house isn't worth jack. With a land value tax, a blighted house owner pays the same amount as the normal house owner next door. So they either have to make the land useful, or they're screwing themselves.   Of course the value of the land (based on location) is factored into the tax rate.  E: Nevermind, not the tax rate, the overall amount of taxes paid."
baltimore,3bn879,megalomike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:32:25 2015 UTC,is there any kind of back of the envelope score on how this would affect the annual revenue? these are very attractive rates.. beautiful even.. but if the budget gets cut by 40% there are troubles ahead.
baltimore,3bn879,JesusOnTheDashboard,9,Wed Jul 1 11:32:30 2015 UTC,"The only people who would be negatively affected by this type of tax reform are folks who own blighted houses or vacant land, and refuse to build and make it useful. Homeowners and building owners would pay less in taxes, and hopefully some of the savings would be passed on to renters. Should give credit: xpost r/geolibertarianism."
baltimore,3bn879,westsideozzie,4,Tue Jun 30 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"I love this idea in theory, but aren't a lot of these vacant building owners in arrears already?  I wonder if the saying ""you can't get blood from a turnip"" applies."

baltimore,3bjs8r,WEIGHED,-18,Tue Jun 30 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"He should be prosecuted, but I think the other poster is just pointing out that property damage is not ""violence"" in of itself."
baltimore,3bjs8r,bmore,6,Tue Jun 30 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yes it is.  violence  noun  behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something."
baltimore,3bjs8r,WEIGHED,-20,Tue Jun 30 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"And as we don't know the intent, the property damage is not necessarily ""violence.""  I would argue arson has far more potential for human damage than other property destruction and could be considered violence as such, but again, property destruction in of itself is not violence per law or the definition you cited."
baltimore,3bjs8r,bmore,11,Tue Jun 30 04:47:04 2015 UTC,"Setting a building on fire (whether intentional or not) can easily cost people inside or nearby, and firefighters their lives.  Manslaughter comes to mind if not worse, had someone died.    Luckily they didn't, but I feel no sympathy for scum that does shit that can cost innocent people their lives."
baltimore,3bjs8r,WEIGHED,-13,Tue Jun 30 05:05:08 2015 UTC,"Where did I say I felt sympathy? By the way, Manslaughter is not always a crime of violence."
baltimore,3bjs8r,bmore,3,Tue Jun 30 11:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think you need to read and understand what violence is, it's not just physical abuse."

baltimore,3bjdig,Bobbled_It,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:46:32 2015 UTC,It made the morning rather awkward. Showers and bathroom use and such. Though the workers I talked to were apologetic and appeared to be working as fast as they could.
baltimore,3bjdig,terrorfrog,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:48:05 2015 UTC,"yeah, at least the workers were nice, not much they can do in certain situations. I leave for work well before 7 am though so regardless I was out of luck regarding the morning shower :(  when they did the city pipe in our front lawn, they severed our underground comcast cable. They told us not to call comcast because they would deal with it directly so it would get done faster. I shit you not, it took over a month for them to get it sorted out. No internet for a month... luckily I went out and spliced it after it happened. Good enough for reddit, but not youtube or netflix :("

baltimore,3biky6,ampetertree,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:23:59 2015 UTC,"The general consensus is that this is far from over, and round 2 will be worse than round 1. Construction, reality, supply, sales, restaurant, mechanics shops, anyone with a large amount of liquid tangible property that can't be moved quickly or 100% secured feels at risk and is afraid.   This has been enhanced by the pissing match between the police force and the mayors office after the events of the aftermath unfolded, with the police union and the mayors office basically calling public press briefings to take shots at each other. Our only saving grace so far is a level headed governor."
baltimore,3biky6,AnalogHumanSentient,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"I would really like to know what businesses are saying this.

baltimore,3biky6,ampetertree,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of smbs in both Baltimore City and country that Ive looked into placing FIOS for; most of the time they want you, or the whole office complex to chip in for a Demarc hub.  Meaning they want potentially a couple grand investment (depending on size) before their willing to talk.  Comcast is usually already in place, so they go with Comcast for their ISP, and maybe use a different voice carrier.  I'd love to see Comcast get ANY competition.  I'm all for Baltimore City building it own Wifi network, and offering it free to the public.  Don't want to use it because ""oh the government is watching me"", get it from a commercial provider like Verizon or Comcast."

baltimore,3biky6,Dharma_Lion,0,Tue Jun 30 00:30:24 2015 UTC,Not sure. I trust Comcast much more than I trust Google though.
baltimore,3biky6,wheelsee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:25:02 2015 UTC,I can't imagine why.  THey are both in the business of monitoring and selling your data.

baltimore,3biky6,wheelsee,2,Wed Jul 1 14:39:18 2015 UTC,I think they may be dropping rates now as a good will gesture to preempt the expiration and subsequent exodus of customers.

baltimore,3biky6,Whiski,2,Mon Jun 29 16:06:51 2015 UTC,My neighborhood is pretty crowded by WiFi signals... I have 22 that my phone can detect and you can't get above 10mbps from more than 15ft away from the router from all of the interference. I switched to 5ghz and get my full 50mbps anywhere I get a signal now :) If that's an option for anyone you should try it out if you're having issues.
baltimore,3biky6,jld2k6,2,Mon Jun 29 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"The difficulty is that higher channels have limited range, and horrible building penetration, making it impractical in some applications. But I agree: if you can use it, use it."
baltimore,3biky6,Dr_Midnight,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:23:05 2015 UTC,True. My signal doesn't reach my whole yard like it does on 2.4ghz (not a very big yard). It's mainly benefited me because as long as I have a signal at all I'm getting my 50mbps whereas I could have 90% signal on 2.4ghz and be lucky to have 8mbps lol.
baltimore,3biky6,jld2k6,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:34:52 2015 UTC,I dont rely on wifi luckily I use powerline adapters for PC and conosles so streaming is more reliable
baltimore,3biky6,luckynmbrsev,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:45:13 2015 UTC,I used to install those for people when working for Dish to hook their boxes up to their internet (sling links) I love those things. I never got to test the bandwidth of them though. Do you get full speeds using this setup? Are yours setup where you just hook one into the router via Ethernet and plug it into the wall then come out via the outlet into ethernet in the rooms needed like the ones I used? Dish wanted people to have their boxes hooked up to the internet so bad that we gave them away to customers for free. I always thought that was neat and always hated that I never picked any up for myself. Most people have no idea this technology exists and are amazed to find out.

baltimore,3bkgtn,jabbadarth,6,Tue Jun 30 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"Movies on the hill  normally I wouldn't recommend a movie for a first date but in this case you get an amazing view of the Baltimore skyline and you can impress with a packed picnic dinner. Bring a bottle of wine (disclaimer; drinking is illegal in public in Baltimore but if you bring plastic cups and don't make a scene you will be fine) and a nice spread and enjoy a nice night outside.  If that isn't your thing I would suggest heading to Fells Point to check out some live music. Slainte is huge and has music on it's main floor most weekend, cats eye is a dive but has live music every night, woody's has no music but has a good rum selection with some fruity ""tropical"" drinks and, IMO, the best view in Fells Point. Honestly you can't really go wrong anywhere along thames or broadway and just walking around outside is nice too."

baltimore,3bk3ix,kiled_by_death,13,Mon Jun 29 21:37:11 2015 UTC,"Mt. Washington is a quiet, nearly suburban neighborhood that has some good looking houses and a few cool buisness. It also has a light rail stop, which is pretty nice. That leads me to some things about the city: 1. The public transportation is horrible. You can try to get around without a car, but you will never truly get to know all the neighborhoods without one (at least through public transit). That gets me to point #2: Baltimore is truly a city of neighborhoods. Each neighborhood has its own, usually awesome, thing going on. These neighborhoods are spread  out from each other surrounded by an ocean of  devonstatingly poor  areas. Fact #3: Baltimore is an extremely poor, and segregated place. Too many of this city's neighborhoods are places filled with vacant houses, broken homes, and shattered, impoverished, people. If you are living in one of those awesome, but segregated, neighborhoods I talked about , you could, and many people do, avoid these poorer neighborhoods and people your entire time here. However, many Baltimoreans, included new residents like yourself, feel (and many are taking proactive, steps to accomplish this ) that we collectively are starting to make this beautiful, yet sick, city healthy again. Which takes me to tip #4: baltimore, despite its problems, is an optimistic, quirky, charming city. Most of us take great pride in this place and hope to make it the city we all dream it is.   I hope you like it, and there  are lots of specific tips in the sidebar."

There is a Shoppers on Smith and of course, Whole Foods at the mill on Falls. You also have grocery options if you go south on Falls. Other MW people may throw out some other grocery ideas.   Close bars will always be Mt. Washington Tavern and Nickel Taphouse right in the heart of the tiny MW business district. Both are great and I go to both fairly often because I can walk. Outside of this, you're close to many drivable options, particularly the vast array of bars and restaurants in Hampden. It's a super short trip down Falls to hit The Avenue. There is a pretty big Hampden presence on this sub and they can help you with the best Hampden spots.  Go to Mt.

baltimore,3bj3hf,bmore,6,Mon Jun 29 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how it is not a sunk cost?  Here's how I see it:  Baltimore spent $288 million to research the Red Line.  The federal govt offered to pay $1 billion towards construction.  The city/state would still have to pay an additional $2 billion.  The decision is ""do we spend $2 bil and get $1 bil fed grant to complete this project"" vs ""do we not spend $2 bil and let the $1 bil go to another state.""  The $288 million is a sunk cost, because it should have no bearing on that decision."

If you are renting, replacing it with your own might help for a few different reasons; most notably, if you have a wifi router from comcast it is likely broadcasting as a Hotspot, which will eat some of your bandwidth.  If you'd prefer to cancel with comcast, then depending on your bandwidth needs you might consider DSL service. You should have better luck getting higher-tier connections in that area (the county is lousy for such service), and there might be more options for providers. You'd also be able to buy your own equipment.   The other option would be satellite service from Hughesnet,  but that will still be pretty low speed as well as subject to the same pitfalls of satellite TV service."
baltimore,3bfx1v,jagrove425,4,Sun Jun 28 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. Based on limited information it sounds like an equipment problem. The gateways they provide are usually crappy (modem/router combos don't do a great job of either task). The Motorola SB6141 is a great modem which operates on 12 channels to mitigate bandwidth problems. A good router can be found for $100-$200, I currently use the Asus Rt-N66U and would recommend it. Having both is important given all the interference with the close living proximity of a city.  If OP does own their equipment they should try plugging in over Ethernet directly to the modem. If they're not seeing the speeds they're paying for then Comcast need to boost the signal or send a tech to investigate the cabling in your house."

If you're paying for 105 and even there speed test doesn't show it then you need to get a tech out there. Now when he's there and their speed test is only showing 40-70 you need to get Comcast's phone support on the phone. Sounds like an issue with the lines which the standard techs will avoid at all cost unless you push them.     The speed drop after a few weeks is likely lazy techs swapping lines... Really common in apartments. Basically there is a bad line and a good line right next to each other and instead of running a new line or fixing the bad one they just swap the two and who ever called them out gets the ""good"" connection and the tech gets to quickly close out a ticket."

Essentially, one of the houses in the area had some sort of strange ping-back that caused interference probably in more houses in the area than just mine.

From anywhere on your network, you should be able to hit that IP.  Also, when you're speed testing, make sure that you're doing so over Ethernet.

baltimore,3bfx1v,MDJdizzel,2,Mon Jun 29 11:40:43 2015 UTC,"Just looked up your router, which sounds like the culprit since your wired speeds are correct, and there's a couple of things:   Your router is new but it's a budget router which lacks many features found on new equipment such as gigabit ethernet ports and 5ghz wifi Your router only operates on 2.4 ghz spectrum, which means you're likely getting a lot of interference from neighbors. Having a dual band 2.4ghz & 5ghz router will probably get you better signaling. It's the city and everyone lives in close proximity, you need a good router if you expect top performance. You can try to adjust the channels your router operates on to get optimal performance. Your neighbors may all be operating on the same channel as you which would increase interference.

They've since bumped me to 150 for no added charge, and speed tests routinely come in at 170-180ish.  I used to think I was badass, until my parents moved to Ellicott City and got Fios 500/500, which speed tests at about 550ish.  That's some humbling shit.

I live in a college town in Jersey and my internet went from 70-90 Mbps mid semester to 120 Mbps when everyone left for summer. So there's not much you can really do.   Other Options:  Did you check Optimum and other cable providers in the area? If you get a internet plan that promises a speed and not a estimated speed that might fare your better.  Check to minimize the number of cable splitters in your home. If you look at a coax splitter, you'll notice a ""-7 dB"" or something similar.

baltimore,3bggz1,unrighteous_bison,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:57:03 2015 UTC,"People taking public transit have, on average, much longer commutes than those who drive.  New York is a prime example. It takes a long time to get from one borough to another via the subway/buses.   Washington's roads are still congested despite a pretty decent metro system.   As long as people chose to live a long way from where they work, they have to suffer long commutes."
baltimore,3bggz1,DXBtoDOH,4,Mon Jun 29 09:02:03 2015 UTC,"i disagree. when it works , public transportation definitely saves time.  and people don't ""choose to live a long way from where they work"" ... they live where they can afford to, often compromising their ""distance from work"" for offering their kids better public school districting. just because many of these people/families have had to buy cars and get used to commuting to the suburbs where they can afford to live, doesn't mean also then mean they can (by default) also afford to drive to the city for work and park there as well. that requires extensive commuting time, parking fees & vehicle maintenance...all of which could be offset for mass quantities of city employees with public transportation options.  finally, you seem to say ""they"" a lot, and honestly it implies a ""you vs them"" attitude...which i personally think stinks.  sorry if that offends you.   this article clearly states that staying ahead of the curve is key. keep an eye on LA. it's changing big time, and fast (go and see for yourself, if you haven't). IMHO, Baltimore dropped the ball big time w/ this red line decision. public transportation is a city's life-blood. Baltimore will continue to ""improve"" where it already is, but there's a gaping wound that we're not addressing and public transportation would help a lot and revitalize so many neighborhoods all around the edges of the ""donut hole""."
baltimore,3bggz1,ATRIOHEAD,2,Mon Jun 29 13:28:47 2015 UTC,"Public transportation can save time when you have a critical population mass and the transportation links serves the major residential and commercial areas, ferrying people back and forth.   The unfortunate reality of most American cities is that they do not have the critical population mass to justify large scale investment in public transportation. The region is still very low density compared to New York or your typical European city.   Take the case of Baltimore. There is a metro line. Many of those stops are in underpopulated areas and certainly hasn't spurred investment in those areas. If the red line had been built, how many people would have bothered to drive or take a bus from Columbia to the nearest station and then taking the rail to the city center? How does it help the vast majority of the commuters who aren't commuting from city to one area in the suburbs or vice versa, but from one suburb to another? From Hunt Valley to Columbia? From Bel Air to Towson?  There's a light rail line but many people still elect to drive because when they factor getting from their house to the station, parking, waiting for the light rail, taking the rail into the city, getting off, walking to their office, it adds to more time than driving.  Public transit definitely helps those who can't afford car ownership, but on the other hand something like the red line would have only opened up few commercial areas to commuters from elsewhere.   The unique issue with American public transportation is that people are quite snobby about it. They (oops, sorry, Americans) will say they'll be happy to take a commuter rail or light rail to work, but sniff at taking buses, even though buses with a dedicated right of way can be quite efficient and low cost, and far more flexible than investment in heavy rail.  I love public transit. I take them all the time when I can. But I can also see why something like the Red Line would only end up serving very few people (relatively speaking) compared to the cost. And for revitalizing areas? There's a Marc station in West Baltimore. What has it done for the surrounding area? Practically nothing. The metro stops along NW Baltimore? Practically nothing. It's too easy to look at Washington and say, look, metro access = gentrifying areas. That won't work in Baltimore so much because Baltimore doesn't have either the urban population mass and the critical number of jobs in key urban areas to justify the heavy investment in public transit. It's not New York. It's certainly not Los Angeles, which, despite its sprawl, has a higher population density than Baltimore and much more congested roadways as well."
baltimore,3bggz1,DXBtoDOH,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"great response; thx for that! so if i really zoom out and try to absorb all of this, basically public transportation infrastructure funding should come after we have more jobs available in the city? when i speak to friends and colleagues in DC, everyone points to the fact that DC works like Baltimore doesn't b/c even the ""poor"" work way more and have a higher percentage of employment than here in Bmore. i also agree w/ your comment on people being snobby about transportation across the whole country. we still over-celebrate the whole ""needing to have a car"" thing and it bites us in the ass every time someone who can't really afford to have a car takes one on, IMHO!"

Also, don't leave anything in your car. Nothing"
baltimore,3bh97j,ohyea56,2,Tue Jun 30 03:10:50 2015 UTC,"How much of your life have you lived in TX?  I am a recent transplant who has lived most of my life in Houston and Austin. Several family members in DFW, so I have spent some time there too. I agree that a general perusal of the sidebar is a good place to start. I also agree with the recommendation of looking in the Fed Hill area given your work location. Fells and Canton are cool but have probably the worst highway access of the city.  But back to my observations as a longtime Texas resident, in no particular order:   Baltimore is old. I'll probably mess up the history here, but the city of Baltimore was founded in 1729. It annexed Fells in 1797, when Stephen F. Austin was 4 years old. This means there is a lot more history here, e.g. the first basilica(?) and the first public library in the US are in Baltimore.    Related to the age of the city, the housing is old. I live in a building built in the late 19th century, as do many other people I know. It is not remarkable for its age. In Texas, at this point, a house built in the 1980s would be considered old. Another related point here is that housing can vary a lot from unit to unit, based on when and how it was remodeled.   Also related to the age, the city is dense, as it was built well before horseless carriages became all the rage. There are lots of pedestrians because there is lots of stuff within walking distance and the infrastructure is set up for pedestrians. This means you will in all likelihood walk as a form of transportation more than you do now. A corollary to this is parking is not free and abundant. From time to time you will here people talking about not wanting to move their car because they got a great parking space. You will come to think this is a sensible thing to do. You will also think 3-4 miles is really far away, as in ""I Live in Fells and would like to spend more time in Hampden, but it's just so far away.""  You will probably need to adjust how you drive. Pedestrians expect cars to yield even if they are walking in the middle of the street, or walking while your light turns green.There are lots of buses pulling in and out of traffic. In short, the mindset that everything is set up to maximize efficient movement of individual automobiles doesn't work here.   Related to the walking, you will notice that Baltimore is racially and economically diverse because you will see so many other people out walking. There is a lot of segregation based on those factors just like there is in TX, but because of the density, you can't pretend like it doesn't exist. People are generally gregarious on the streets. There are much fewer beggars than say, the drag, they are much nicer, and they will sometimes ask for a modest amount like a quarter.  One cumulative effect of all these points is that Baltimore is noisier than the places I've lived in TX. I had to get a white noise machine to drown out street noise.   As someone else mentioned, it only takes one ""wrong turn"" and a distance of a block or two to put you in an area that is outside your comfort zone. I am of the opinion that this is mostly harmless, at least in daytime. The other interesting thing here is that you can be in fancy part of town, walk a few blocks and be in the hood, walk a few more and be in another fancy area.  Longer term residents in their 20s and 30s are very sociable, and excited to share their Baltimore knowledge with you. Obviously this was never an issue in TX, since I was not a stranger there, but I've been struck by how friendly people are once I tell them I'm new to the area.  You pay more taxes and many things cost more. No way to avoid this, adjust accordingly.   Mexican food is indeed weak from my limited exploration, good ethnic food seems generally to be out in the burbs, but again, I haven't been here that long. Fed hill, Fells and Canton seem to be the places to go for good food- I've never had a bad meal in any of them so far.  This was my first winter in a place where all the plants lose their leaves. It was bleak at times and I was happy when the trees got their first buds. My allergies were the worst I've ever had though. The roads seemed well maintained after snowstorms, sidewalks could remain icy for a while in places.  This seems like enough for now, let me know if it raises any more questions. I've tried to be neutral above, but full disclosure, I really like it here so far."

She said she never had to swap wardrobes from summer/winter before. Also, the mid-Atlantic has horrible allergy issues, especially in Spring and Fall. Prepare to experience a whole new level of misery in April that you've likely not experienced prior. Zyrtec works for me. You'll spend a lot of time trying to find the best crabcake, when all along it is at Koko's pub. My suggestion is to not go there until you've had many others' as it'll ruin the rest for you.   My SO asked me ""what's with Mario"" everywhere?"" It is in fact ""Boh"" - the iconic image of National Bohemian beer, which isn't even brewed here any longer but Baltimorons still claim it as their own.  The inner harbor is for tourists. You should only go there when people visit you from out of town.  Fells Pt. has more bars in it per block than anywhere else in the country, IIRC and is always fun, but not 100% safe. Little Mexico is in Fells Pt. and is growing daily. Papi's has the best Mex you'll find. On that note, it is really difficult to find what you will consider good Mexican food in Baltimore, according to my SO.   Hopefully you'll have a car? The best spots in Baltimore are not in the City. The surrounding county to the North, and Patapsco Valley to the SW are awesome.   Don't get tricked into going to DC for fun. Also, DO NOT, repeat DO NOT lump Baltimore in with DC for anything. We really hate that.  Start buying purple. Get to know what ""52"" relates to, and look for a re-labeling of ""27"". Do not cheer for the Steelers, or Patriots.

Baltimore really isn't a ""7 nights per week kind of party town as NY and DC are though. It is a little more laid back in that respect. Thurs/Fri/Sat usually rock pretty good, but we are sleepier than the two big towns to our north and south. Fells Pt. really is a lot of fun for a younger person such as yourself. Federal Hill is up and coming. Hamden is also a good call and a little farther from much of the bad element that can be found in Baltimore.

baltimore,3bft8x,HeyThereImMrMeeseeks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:28:37 2015 UTC,"Initially it wouldn't activate. Once I got on wifi and downloaded the newest firmware and the newest Republic app it activated nearly instantly. However, newest firmware (4.4.4) isn't rootable, so getting the phone activated I screwed myself out of being able to have root.  I didn't port a number over to their service, so I cannot give a view of that.  The Moto G is a nice phone, but initially it killed apps like crazy because of the memory configuration. Because I don't have root I couldn't apply a fix, so I froze random things like Google Search just to be able to use the phone normally. YMMV."
baltimore,3bft8x,jjk2,3,Mon Jun 29 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"I use Virgin Mobile on a $30/month (auto payment discount) plan where I get unlimited text/data (they slow speeds after 2.5gb) and 300 minutes. Another feature I like is I can add 1gb of hotspot for $5/month or 2gb for $10 at any time, which I've used on a few occasions while traveling or during jury duty. They operate on Sprint's network which is decent for what I need. Cell service inside of buildings can be problematic sometimes but you'll have the same issues with TMobile unless you use wifi calling.  Another MVNO to check out would be Cricket which operates on AT&Ts network. The service will be more reliable but it's slightly more expensive than Virgin and they cap network speeds.  If you end up choosing TMobile, check if you're eligible for their ""Wifi CellSpot"" router, which is just a rebranded $200 Asus router they offer to their customers for a $25 deposit."
baltimore,3bft8x,smallteam,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:35:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks this is really helpful. Assuming similar call quality Virgin Mobile is 5 dollars cheaper and 200 more minutes.   I'm not sure what the value of the Wifi CellSpot is, it just lets you make calls over wifi when at home? I thought smartphones could do that on their own? I guess the key is it makes the quality better by prioritizing it.  How would you compare Sprint's call quality with T-mobile or Verizon (I could be wrong but my sense is if you are in a city they are all good, it's when you get into more rural areas that Verizon and ATT really shine)?"
baltimore,3bft8x,Mamrot,2,Sun Jun 28 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"I've never use TMobile so I can't comment on their cell service definitively but from what I've heard it's similar to Sprint, if not a bit faster due to using GSM vs CDMA for their 3G tech. As for the Sprint network vs AT&T or Verizon, the coverage is almost as good (only spot I haven't had service was in Upstate NY towards Canada), but service inside of buildings is poor due to the higher frequency spectrum that Sprint/TMobile operate on. TMobile actively supports Wifi calling which mitigates the problem but it hasn't made it to Virgin mobile yet as far as I'm aware.  As for the router, the call prioritization is the selling feature from Tmobiles stand point. I'm not sure how much it really improves call quality over a regular router. The reason I mentioned it is because you're essentially getting to use a slightly modded $200 Asus router which has the latest wireless standard (AC instead of N) for free, so it's a nice perk. It's worth noting that while Wireless calling is a supported feature on a lot of phones now, not every carrier supports it yet like TMobile does.  If price is your biggest concern than you might potentially also want to investigate options such as Ting or Republic wireless that offer pay for usage plans that emphasize you use wifi. Google's new MVNO has a similar philosophy but requires you have a Nexus 6 which isn't for everyone/fairly expensive.  There are a ton of 3rd party options in the wireless space, it just depends on what you're looking for when it comes to balancing coverage/speed/data usage/price."
baltimore,3bft8x,threezus,2,Sun Jun 28 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"I have Virgin and I've never had a call quality issue (although most of my friends are text/IM/email people, so I don't spend very much time on the phone at all). Like /u/NoFunPat says, it frequently sucks inside large buildings, but so does the service with every other carrier I've ever had.   My one issue them is that if you have any kind of problem that you need a person to resolve, their customer support is hellish. Possibly actually the worst I've experienced. You may never need to call them, though, so YMMV."

baltimore,3bdfso,Kylearean,3,Sun Jun 28 06:07:04 2015 UTC,"I'm considering purchasing a home defense handgun myself.  i grew up around guns and have had some personal firearm training.   which handgun do you recommend?  I don't have PCP'd out psychos in my neighborhood, so the massive stopping power of a 357 would be probably overkill.   But i do need that ""someone's just kicked in the door and is coming up the stairway, I have 10 seconds to arm, aim, and fire.""     I also have two small children.   I think storing the gun above the doorframe that they cannot reach would be the fastest access, a trigger lock is probably too slow in rapidly evolving situations.    open to recommendations."
baltimore,3bdfso,theartfuldubber,4,Sun Jun 28 12:52:37 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, the ""which handgun should I buy"" is a shockingly open ended one :) My universal recommendation, which is accurate as any universal recommendation can be, is a Glock 17. They're ubiquitous, they're kinda boring, but they are that way because they work every time , they're trusted by countless law enforcement agencies, and they have an excellent track record. I recommend 9mm because it's a friendly cartridge that has adequate stopping power (cue the .45ACP guy that thinks anything less than a cannon is a pea shooter), the full frame has a high capacity (go across state lines and buy a high capacity magazine since they don't trust us with those anymore). The most important thing as stated below is PRACTICE with it constantly. It needs to be muscle memory to operate. I personally have a Ruger LCR .357 as my nightstand gun because I prefer revolvers due to their inherent simplicity in that ""3am, mind is foggy, just want something that points and shoots every time"" scenario. I know I'm giving up capacity, but there are other options in the house as well. If you practice with it, are comfortable with it, and store it securely, it's ""the right gun"" for you.  As far as storage, a biometric safe that is VERY easy to get to but very hard to open for someone that isn't you is my recommendation. And bolt that mother to the biggest beam you can find."

baltimore,3bdfso,sweckz,2,Sun Jun 28 14:02:38 2015 UTC,Glock 17 or Glock 19 are strong choices. If you get the 19 it is easier to conceal if one day average citizens are allowed this right to defend their lives.

baltimore,3bbe0p,pho75,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"You must not be paying attention. If you haven't noticed, things have been changing fairly quickly over the last 10 years. Dash cams, mandatory reporting, statistical analysis of stops, arrests, and race-based oversight. Policy changes that include significant punishment, including up to termination, for failing to report violations by other officers. Cops getting fired for being rude (Riverari) and getting prosecuted for getting unjustly physical or not playing by the rules.  There is a lot left to do, but it would be ignorant to suggest that nothing's being done. Don't you tire of trotting out the same schtick in thread after thread?"
baltimore,3bbe0p,5aiah,3,Sat Jun 27 18:33:10 2015 UTC,Much of what you said is treating the symptom but not the underlying disease. More police need to come from the communities being policed and and cops need far better training than they have now. I'm guessing that what the other poster is suggesting is that we would still be ignoring the main problem with the few changes you speak of.
baltimore,3bbe0p,Bmorewiser,5,Sat Jun 27 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"the communities that are being policed aren't exactly chocked full of kids who grow up wanting to be cops. Also, drug use disqualifies you under state law and regulation, which is a problem since most kids try weed a few times. You can lie about it I guess.   That is, of course, part of the problem but it's not something that can be fixed in the short or even reasonably long term."
baltimore,3bbe0p,XxCloudSephiroth69xX,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:58:55 2015 UTC,Using weed a few times won't disqualify you from being a police officer in most places as long as it wasn't within a certain time prior to your application.  Using weed a few dozen times might.  Departments will even allow some harder stuff as long as the use wasn't within the past 5(?) years.  I forget the exact cutoff.  Depends on the agency.
baltimore,3bbe0p,Bmorewiser,2,Sat Jun 27 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"Looks like the regulation was changed. When I last looked 5 times with weed was presumptively not ""experimentation."" Now it's 20 times for pot before age 21 or 5 times after age 21, but none in the last three years. If anyone cares the Reg is under comar 12.04.01.16"

baltimore,3bbe0p,5aiah,-2,Sun Jun 28 00:23:35 2015 UTC,A two pronged attack can solve the first problem. Stop the rampant abuse of those communities by the police and force the black leaders to stop the attack on police in the black and hip hop cultures in order to preserve themselves.
baltimore,3bbe0p,Bmorewiser,3,Sun Jun 28 00:59:49 2015 UTC,"Great, now how do you plan to accomplish either of those things. That's like saying, this wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't a problem. Its great in theory, but not that helpful in practice."
baltimore,3bbe0p,5aiah,0,Sun Jun 28 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"Well as I'm not an elected official I can only try to spread ideas. My thought would be to make policing something you have to study for in college and something you can't income tax along with other perks. You should have to live in the city.   My thinking is to start programs like that at HBCUs first before expanding them to other places. The Italians and Irish have historically been a big part of the police department, I'm thinking getting policing into black culture would lead to more recruits, especially if they see that it's about being highly trained and not just being a criminal with a gun which is how many blacks see them now.   With that black leaders would be automatically forced to push policing(the right way) as a way of self preservation and controlling their destiny, as well as gaining power.   I live near Morgan's campus and know a few teachers, administrators and department heads but beyond that what is there for me to do. I throw ideas out there and hope they stick to someone.

Conservatives can talk all they want, but they have zero say in the goings on in this city. So I'm not sure why we are even talking about it. Hell, we haven't had a republican in an important office since the 70s in Baltimore so who cares if they can't see the problems.  And the cause and effect here isn't all that clear anyway. Is it bad cops that cause more crime, or is the intrenched criminal element that has led to bad cops? It's almost certainly a bit from column a and a bit from column b, don't you think?   Also, when Erlich was governor he ordered a massive house cleaning at state police. Things that usually got swept under a rug became grounds for termination, staying silent became grounds for termination, saying offensive shit became grounds for termination or loss of rank. Many of the old guard were transferred to desks. That agency looks totally different today because of policies Erlich put in place.   So it's entirely possible that while so called republicans don't make police accountability part of their platform, in practice they seem less likely to tolerate shenanigans."

He said money saved by not doing the project could be put toward a better bus system or other infrastructure projects.   Very disappointing to read this from Basu. Given that the $2.9 billion for the Red Line has now shrunk to the $230 million of the city's original contribution and the mysterious lump sum Hogan swears he awarded Baltimore in Thursday's decision. He's essentially making the argument that $2.6 billion dollars wouldn't have had any positive economic impacts."
baltimore,3b9bja,stackolee,8,Sat Jun 27 12:47:05 2015 UTC,"except the money will instead go to projects in western maryland and the eastern shore.  this was a calculated political move by hogan.  he doesn't care about baltimore, because he doesn't get the cities vote....however he gets many votes in western maryland and the eastern shore.  i laughed out loud when he said he liked public transportation and this wasn't politically motivated."
baltimore,3b9bja,gothaggis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"He was pretty smart to give a little something to every county in Maryland. It pretty much nullifies whatever support existed for the Red Line in the General Assembly. Sure a majority of the representatives may be in favor of building the Red Line, but they're sure as hell not going to take money away from their constituents."

baltimore,3b9bja,green_marshmallow,7,Sat Jun 27 14:11:58 2015 UTC,"Disappointing but consistent. Basu's public position appears to be arguing that lower property taxes, a new arena, and a crackdown on panhandlers are the only policy changes needed for Baltimore to magically be a functional city with strong state support."
baltimore,3b9bja,todareistobmore,3,Sat Jun 27 16:44:47 2015 UTC,"Well I'm with him on the lower property taxes, everything else is just bizarro land."
baltimore,3b9bja,stackolee,2,Sat Jun 27 17:50:55 2015 UTC,"Well the money for that 2.6 billion has to come out of taxes. By saving the money and lowering taxes, you make the city more attractive to businesses."
baltimore,3b9bja,Shiningknight12,3,Sat Jun 27 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"Funny story: the gas tax was passed implicitly for funding the state's contribution to the Red and Purple Lines. That's not going anywhere. Hogan's decided to use that money for road work in the counties. In fact its a graduated tax, so not only is it still in effect, it will continue to increase for years to come.   The $900 million of federal funds will be spent too. Just in Texas or Boston for their pending rail projects, not in Baltimore. As federal tax payers, we'll help to contribute to their mass transit projects!  The $1 billion in public/private partnerships would not have been tax money. As I understand it, the private investors would've gotten their money back by taking a cut of fares for decades.   That really just leaves the $230 million Baltimore City allocated for the Red Line. Our taxes haven't gone up for this yet since Baltimore City hasn't started collecting. That may go away, fund other transportation work, or in all likelihood disappear into the general fund.   So yeah, tax wise Baltimore's going to be helping out everyone else's transit projects for years to come."
baltimore,3b9bja,stackolee,0,Sat Jun 27 22:54:58 2015 UTC,This assumes that the transit line comes in on budget. Every transit project I am aware of has ran heavily over-budget. And Baltimore would be the one paying for any overages.

baltimore,3b9bja,Timey_Wimey_TARDIS,7,Mon Jun 29 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that building the red line by tunnelling under harbor east and fells point is a terrible idea. That's the kind of project that you say is going to cost 2 billion but takes 10 years and 2 billion more than you expected because of tunnelling under historic parts of the city. I think that money could be much better spent to improve the state of transportation in the city NOW than pouring money into a paining multi year project that may not ever come to completion. How about improving the light rail we ALREADY HAVE. I only used it once because it took me an hour to get somewhere it could have taken me 10 minutes to drive to or taken an Uber for only a few dollars more. They should also expand the circulator routes. I would have loved to have one pick up in Hampden and go downtown, would have saved me 140 bucks a month on parking. Canton neighbors would probably love to have a route from Brewers to Harbor East, so many people there walk to work because they don't want to pay 140  a month for parking. I think it was good to nix the red line while we are still not fully vested in it, but also they need to come up with alternative ways to invest that 2 billion to improving Baltimore transportation."
baltimore,3b9bja,stackolee,6,Sat Jun 27 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm really sad about this common misconception. There is no $2.9 billion. Most of that money was use it or lose it and Baltimore lost. The feds will only give $900 million for the Red Line, we can't transfer it to another project. The $700 million from the state was instead given to the counties. The public/private partnerships will never happen now so that's another $1 billion gone.   There's only the $230 million the city planned to contribute, and I'm pretty sure that's not a lump sum sitting in the general fund. It was probably intentioned to be paid over five years and may be entirely contingent on funding the Red Line too. In short Baltimore lost EVERYTHING.   Also to your point about the Circulator. Yes that project needs to be saved, but its problems are its own. The Red Line didn't cannibalize funding for the Circulator. Instead it was bad bets on cutting-edge technology and good old fashion corruption."

How about improving the light rail we ALREADY HAVE.   I know many people who depend on public transportation, whether it's bus or light rail, would 100% agree with you.  It doesn't make sense to build something new without fixing what you already have.  I don't really depend on public transportation as a choice.  I can take the Charm City Circulator or the regular bus to work but it's so slow and so crowded that I found its faster to walk 2 miles to work rather than waiting for a bus for 30 mins and ride it as it sits in traffic.  I wish I can comment on the light rail but I've never ridden it before. I've heard horror stories but I have no experience.  Lasty, I think we can learn a lot from Los Angeles.  They used to have awful public transportation services but now it's really improved.  They developed a great bike infrastructure, subways, trains, and busses.    One simple method they used for solving traffic caused by busses is they illuminated bus stops on every block and now it stops every half mile.  They also developed lanes where only busses can go. It's rediculous that busses literally stop every block.  Some would argue that stopping every block helps the disabled but that's what MTA mobility program is for."

I got on at Timonium Business park and road to University Center/Baltimore Street.   Overall it is not terrible.  But I am going to be honest that I did get a little burnt out by it. I am pretty certain I have witnessed everything on the train at this point, verbal fights, physical fights, people vomiting, people peeing (yep peeing and that was during the morning commute).  People being mugged for their phones/computers.  That is a big one I want to stress to you, if you do ride the light rail, be very very aware of your surroundings while using your stuff.  I saw about five people robbed, the worst was an elderly women getting punched in the face by teenagers for her laptop.  I made it a point to only use my phone while the train was moving once we came into a stop I put it in my bag. Thing is, it is very easy to get on and off the light rail without purchasing a fair so that brings some rift raft.  I know I kind of went on a rant about terrible things, but in the years I rode it, worst that happen to me was getting harassed by a couple of pervs (I am a female).  Really just mind your own business and be aware of your surroundings and you should be fine.  Since you are only riding to Centre Street you are not going as far into the City as I did.  And another thing to take into account is service honestly sucks. The joke about MTA is that stands for ""May take awhile"" so plan extra time for your commute.   Hope that did not fully turn you off from using it, no matter how annoyed I got with using it, just seeing the parking lot 83 is sometimes in the morning and not paying 200+ a month to park in the City made me keep using it."

In theory it seems like I should be a target, but not so much as a malicious glance in my direction. Not on the MTA bus routes I've used, either.  I've only ever seen:   Some idiot playing with a lighter and briefly trying to light a seat on fire until I started moving towards the seat with a clipboard, to put it out (turned out not to be necessary) A bunch of drunk high schoolers from some county private school (forget the name) taking over the back car, spilling beer cans, and generally making the commute miserable for everyone else   The Light Rail can only get safer and more successful as more people ride, so please do!  (On the other hand, roads get more harmful as they get more busy, and driving is already more likely to get you killed/injured or harm someone else, statistically, than virtually anything else you do, so there's a downside to not taking the Light Rail as well)."

Putting someone into permanent housing costs the state just eight thousand dollars, and that’s after you include the cost of the case managers who work with the formerly homeless to help them adjust. The same is true elsewhere. A Colorado study found that the average homeless person cost the state forty-three thousand dollars a year, while housing that person would cost just seventeen thousand dollars.""

Giving them a home isn't going to solve anything if they don't recover from addiction or receive help from mental health professionals.  How good can a person be with a home if that person is unemployable?  Now we can say we should address those issues too.  The problem is, there are many resources from public and private organizations.  I've see the work they do on a near daily basis. Although they work hard to help, it rarely ever works.

Underlying health problems are constantly aggravated by the stress of homelessness.  With housing first, bam, that's out of the way and doesn't eat up anymore energy.  Other services can be more effective and hopefully people graduate and move on.  If someone doesn't, whatever, it's still better to pay someone's rent for life than to let them die of uncontrolled DM or and overdose at 60 under the overpass while we march on by to get some $20 cider and pit beef at the farmer's market.    edit: Check out info from the Corporation for Supportive Housing as a starting point if you're into this kind of stuff"

baltimore,3b7rgr,sllewgh,5,Fri Jun 26 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"Not all vacant homes are uninhabitable (though many are). Solving homelessness would not be costless, but the cost must be weighed against the social and economic cost of homelessness, including the cost of housing the homeless on the taxpayer dime in a shelter, hospital, or prison. Other benefits factor in as well- if the house were simply let vacant, for example, it still costs the city an average of 1,472$ per house per year in fire, police, and other services.   Providing housing won't solve the problem on its own as you rightly point out, we also need to provide jobs.  It's a start, though."

The one thing that makes a person homeless is not having a home.   Regardless, you're not wrong, homelessness is a complex issue in need of many solutions. All the problems you listed are easier to deal with once you give someone a home, and perhaps impossible to deal with without one.  If you're homeless, addiction, mental health issues, diabetes, or HIV aren't your biggest or most pressing problem. Lots of things need to be solved in conjunction."

I hear all the time how Baltimore and Maryland ""can't afford"" heavy rail, but other US cities seem to have no issue with finding the money and will. Los Angeles is in the midst of a rapid Metro expansion. In the 15 years since Bmore's Red Line was announced, LA has built one heavy rail line and two light rail lines. And two new lines and three extensions are under construction. I know LA is much bigger and younger than Baltimore, but they're even more of a car town than us! And I hear all the time: ""This is the last new rail line we'll ever see; we need to take what we can get"". Bullcrap. What about finishing that pathetic fish hook of a subway line? What about rail to Towson? What about better connecting our existing lines? What about bus hubs?

baltimore,3b70jv,paper_flames,0,Fri Jun 26 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, whether the red line exists is a policy, not an engineering, question. The governor killed the project because Republicans are generally opposed to spending money on mass transit."
baltimore,3b70jv,paper_flames,4,Sat Jun 27 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem, IMO, is that once again a potentially huge benefit to this city that may have changed the entire face of Baltimore for decades has been shut down due to short sighted ""fiscal responsibility"". I am all for taking care of tax payer money but at some point someone needs to take a leap of faith and do something monumental not just for the revenue but for the city and the people that live here or will live here. At the rate we are going Baltimore is being shackled the being ""charm city"" (which isn't necessarilly bad) but why couldnt we be that and more."
baltimore,3b70jv,JesusOnTheDashboard,5,Fri Jun 26 15:19:23 2015 UTC,What exactly do you think the studies did?  This has been taken into consideration and the route was adjusted accordingly.  You MUST know about the normal utility pit studies if you're really a surface engineer.
baltimore,3b7q0r,sklein382,14,Fri Jun 26 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"The Right Rail exists solely as a trojan horse. Their goal is not to improve the Red Line but to kill it outright. To this end they used divide and conquer as their primary method of attack. I've heard them in action, they'll glom onto any alternative approach regardless if it meshes with their plan. So if you say ""busses would be better!"" they'd say ""yes they would! The MTA didn't even consider that!"". If you say ""I think this project will be expensive"", they'll say ""yes it will! The MDOT is dramatically undercounting costs!"". If you say ""the underground tunnel won't work"", they'll say ""of course it won't! The MDOT didn't plan for that at all."" They'll agree to any criticism, any revision, all the while knowing that any change to the approved Red Line route would jeopardize subsidies and kill the project.   There have been a number of Right Rail members who've chimed in recently, the Baltimore Brew has been one of their ardent supporters and gave them more space to gloat this morning. This piece is actually pretty typical. The author doesn't sound concerned at all that the ""Right Rail"" plan is deader than the Red Line, he's elated that the Red Line won't happen at all. Mission Accomplished."
baltimore,3b7q0r,stackolee,14,Fri Jun 26 17:51:04 2015 UTC,Fuck the Right Rail Coalition directly in their NIMBY assholes.
baltimore,3b7q0r,Talltimore,0,Fri Jun 26 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate a bit; in some respect, isn't the planner's decision to routing the Red Line through Canton the opposite of NIMBYism on their part. Rather than routing the line to serve the most people (in the center of the greatest population), they are choosing to place the line along a waterfront road (with no significant population on one side) and stops at Safeway and Target. I have no idea what these stops would have accomplished, and I have to imagine that if they had used a road like Eastern with a stops like Patterson Park that would serve Canton equally as well and while serving areas further North much more effectively."
baltimore,3b7q0r,Talltimore,12,Fri Jun 26 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"The stops were placed around Safeway and Target (and Bo Brooks, and the Can Company, and just a few blocks from the Square) because those are all destinations.  Transit is pointless without destinations.  Maybe you can make the argument that we need transit that better incorporates residential and retail/entertainment, but the red line was only the first part of that.  The red line would have given people east and west of the city a way to commute through the city to huge employers (SSA on the west, and Hopkins on the east) as well as giving everyone in between a way to also move easily east and west.  Right Rail didn't want ""undesireables"" in their neighborhoods so they did a ton of concern trolling to make it look like they just wanted to help those poor people way north of Patterson Park get around.  Look at the images in their plan: a giant fucking diverted loop essentially saying Stay the Fuck Out of Canton."
baltimore,3b7q0r,plinth19,-2,Fri Jun 26 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"I will agree that this was likely their goal. However that doesn't make all of their ideas without merit.   Their motivations aside, I personally disagree that Safeway and Target are destinations. They are just stores meant to serve the local population. Can Company is arguably a little more of a destination, but maybe to only 300 employees of Millennial Media.  The real destinations are things like Downtown, UMD, SSA, Hopkins, Bayview, MARC, I-95."
baltimore,3b7q0r,federal_thrill,5,Fri Jun 26 18:17:53 2015 UTC,Target is a huge destination.. It is one of the few places in the city with flexible hours where you can buy basic necessities beyond corner store fare.
baltimore,3b7q0r,TheBrainReigns,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:38:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but do we need a train to get to that?"
baltimore,3b7q0r,plinth19,4,Fri Jun 26 19:54:16 2015 UTC,What happened to change your opinion?  An hour ago you said Target was not a destination.  Now you're agreeing that it is.
baltimore,3b7q0r,woodchuck312,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:06:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, and I guess I am being a little confusing. What I am trying to say is that my belief is that a rail destination should be a large and unique destination for a large amount of people that removes a significant amount of vehicle trips from the road.  I agree in that I recognize that Target is a destination for many people who need to buy necessities, however I disagree with the premise that it (or anything in Canton really) is a sufficiently large and unique enough destination to justify being a stop on rail transit. If we are trying to get people to stores, there has to be an easier way than this.   I just don't believe that it would remove a significant amount of vehicle trips compared to a rail system focused on getting commuters into the city. I think trying to solve for too many things is what caused the costs to spiral out of control. I am not against having mass transit rail lines, I just think they have to be more focused.  I feel like I have been commenting a lot, what do you think?"
baltimore,3b7q0r,Talltimore,2,Fri Jun 26 20:27:37 2015 UTC,Many many Baltimoreans need public transit to get to things like Target. Something like 40% of Baltimore households are carless.

baltimore,3b7q0r,Oriolesphilly,4,Fri Jun 26 17:33:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is in their own ""fact"" sheet:   The Red Line average speed is estimated at 18.8 mph. In rush hour, it will be even slower. Baltimore’s North/South Central Light Rail is faster than the Red Line at 22mph and is poorly used by commuters because it is too slow. Our Metro subway averages over 32mph.   They can't use the same line at two completely different speeds, which would mean widening the tunnel.  Widening the tunnel means doing EXACTLY WHAT THE RIGHT RAIL FUCKERS BITCHED ABOUT HAPPENING IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD.*  *My irritation is not directed at you, but instead those Right Rail shitdouching fuckfaces."
baltimore,3b7q0r,bmore,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"Using the existing tunnel path, with a new tube to allow overtaking, and then the red line splitting back into its original alignment at Shot Tower would have made a fair amount of sense.  I still think the most sense would have been made by going on the surface with a dedicated rail through downtown.  Eliminate all the underground risk and go ""beep beep"" past all the people staring at bumper to bumper traffic on Lombard."
baltimore,3b7q0r,TaeKurmulti,0,Sun Jun 28 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"This is the first i have seen this webpage. I took it to mean it would be light rail from Bay View to Lexington Market.   So those 3 exisiting Subway stops would transition into light rail which would go from Bayview out to Woodlawn. The Subway would be from Owings Mills to Lexington Market.    This scenario connects the transit lines all together with Lexington Market being the meeting point, it is interesting.    Am i misinterpreting their map?"
baltimore,3b4rhd,aresef,30,Thu Jun 25 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"Even with all of the potential shortfalls and budget issues with the red line the fact that Baltimore, a city of 600,000 people, has no real mass transit options is a huge problem. Maybe this wasn't a cure all but it would have been a step in the right direction. We shouldn't live in a city where you are required to have a car to get around to most of it."
baltimore,3b4rhd,jabbadarth,34,Fri Jun 26 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"I think one of the big problems with the Canton opposition is the perspective of those that live there. They treat the neighborhood like a suburb where they can walk to eat...and drive to their jobs in the suburbs. Here we have a light rail line that would give you access to by direct route or connection to Mount Vernon, UMD, downtown, Fell's Point, Greektown, Hampden, Station North, and enhance quality of life. But the response is pretty much ""black people will come here, and that's bad"""
baltimore,3b4rhd,Oriolesphilly,16,Fri Jun 26 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"They treat the neighborhood like a suburb where they can walk to eat   Absolutely, and the developers developed it that way too. That new shopping center with the Target is a prime example. What it should  have been is multi-use. You build apartments above the stores. This is the new modern city design. But the developer instead decided to plop suburbia right into the city, and wasted so much potential new housing and income and taxable revenue.  And nobody who lives there realizes what it could have been."

baltimore,3b4rhd,BmoreInterested,2,Fri Jun 26 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"Canton Crossing's lack of apartments has nothing to do with the feasibility of building on a contaminated site. When Exxon sold the developers the site they stipulated that it could not be used for any sort of residential. I guess they didn't want to take the risk (however remote) that someone would live there get cancer and they would have to defend themselves. They found a buyer who was willing to agree to those terms. I don't love the way it turned out either, but there was enough interest from national retailers to make the development finance-able and office would probably have been all spec."

Certain parts of the city have cordoned themselves off into Ivory Tower-type neighborhoods. They feel like the Red Line would demolish the barriers between themselves and the urban blight of the rest of Baltimore. So let's be honest: it probably would. And that would be the point.   But from the Cantonites' perspective, you can easily see what their motivations are even if you don't sympathize with them."

That's the theory anyway."

To me, the largest of those was the fact that it didn't address the disconnected nature of getting around the city.  You can't get from one transit line to the other without a lot of time and effort.

baltimore,3b3s41,TheSchneid,4,Thu Jun 25 22:22:08 2015 UTC,My educated guess is that the tunnel is a deal killer because its too close to the inner harbour and no contractor would dare go near it for fear of all the headaches it would cause.
baltimore,3b3s41,BmoreInterested,2,Thu Jun 25 22:22:40 2015 UTC,That is interesting..  I wonder (and I'm not kidding) but what about like a monorail that was above?

baltimore,3b3s41,BmoreInterested,3,Thu Jun 25 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"It's not monorail, but here in San Diego we have overhead light rail lines running through the Mission Valley section of town that are similar in footprint to monorail. They work well here, but I doubt they'd fly in the sections of Baltimore that had issues with surface light rail.  It looks like the red line was already planning to use aerial tracks in sections, so I'm sure it was discussed. If SANDAG tried to add overhead light rail lines in a similarly dense / gentrified neighborhood of San Diego I'm sure they'd get shot down, too.  Anyway, my point is that Hogan has made a fucking terrible decision here."

baltimore,3b3s41,Oriolesphilly,0,Thu Jun 25 19:24:50 2015 UTC,I don't disagree....but the truth is that a light rail isn't as efficient as a subway. Nor is it as enticing to people that will actually help the cities tax base.
baltimore,3b3s41,clebo99,9,Thu Jun 25 19:33:34 2015 UTC,The light rail stops are in the worst places though. How the fuck is there not one accessible to Hopkins students. Why is the north Ave stop and the Mount Royal stop like 100 yards from each other.
baltimore,3b3s41,TheSchneid,14,Thu Jun 25 19:38:18 2015 UTC,NIMBYs.
baltimore,3b3s41,clebo99,5,Thu Jun 25 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"Actually it was mostly cost, in the Blue lines case. They could build it for a third of the price by following the old railroad line through the middle of nowhere, rather than routing it through Hopkins and other areas where there were actually people. There was little effort to ever route it that way, though if they'd really tried the NIMBYs certainly would have put up one hell of a fight, and possibly won anyways."
baltimore,3b3s41,ABCosmos,4,Thu Jun 25 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"So it's been a while, but as I remember it the Light Rail had already shifted planning away from Towson after serious Baltimore County opposition but before the cost estimates were made.  In that sense, it wasn't really about anticipated costs.  Maybe someone else can chime in on specifics though."
baltimore,3b3s41,unrighteous_bison,4,Thu Jun 25 21:48:54 2015 UTC,When Towson Mall was being planned it was originally going to be a depot for busses to feed the light rail. Towson shut down that idea pretty thoroughly.
baltimore,3b3s41,clarkbmiller,2,Thu Jun 25 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think that in the light rail's case the alignment had more to do with the existing rail line for cost effectiveness. Then the NIMBYs jumped in, like with the elimination of the Ruxton stop."
baltimore,3b3s41,stackolee,8,Thu Jun 25 20:00:43 2015 UTC,Yup......That was a big part of it.....Which again is too bad that some people were short-sighted.
baltimore,3b3s41,rigiddigit,4,Fri Jun 26 15:26:34 2015 UTC,Same reason it doesn't go to Towson. White people don't like it when black people can enter their neighborhoods at will.
baltimore,3b3s41,clarkbmiller,5,Thu Jun 25 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"As a Light Rail rider, trying to think where you would put a stop that would be convenient to Hopkins students? Lot of acreage between the University and the fixed lined they had to build the train on."

baltimore,3b3s41,UmbrellaCo,3,Fri Jun 26 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"It needs signal priority first of all. The light rail should never sit at stop lights. Europe laughs at us.  And it probably needs a reduction in downtown stops, but new ones at Remington and Cross Keys. Then a real link (e.g. east tunnel entrance next to LR stops) to the Metro at Centre and Lexington St stops. An east entrance at North Ave to serve development there (instead of the underside of 83). Eliminate the service stop in the middle. Get rid of a few county park and ride stops to speed it up too. Rebrand it as a 'blue line' to the metro's 'green' and treat them as a connected system instead of two separate parts. How many people don't know the metro exists? It's awesome.  Making it go more places, faster, will make a whole lot more people ride it."

IIRC, this was done as part of a deal with the state @20 or so years ago. I'm drawing blank as to why. Maybe it was the blizzard in the 90's?

By whom? To what end? And how was anyone harmed?  The article you link doesn't tell us Dick about what happened. We don't know who the source was, why he was believed (or even if he was believed) or why they released the info in a press release. All it says is that the info turned out to be false.  Playing devils advocate for a moment, the police were almost certainly overwhelmed at that time trying to discern truth from fiction. There were thousands of tweets, Facebook posts, and other rumors of impending trouble and many of those were also repeated by city government. In other words, it seems the police were allowing information to flow through it without vetting it for truth. There was all sorts of stupid shit getting bantered about, including claims that terrorists were going to blow shit up in the name of ISIS.  And perhaps there's good reason for that. Imagine this threat was true and it's later discovered that the police kept it secret. People would go apeshit. Same if the purge came to fruition. The department was stretched so thin it would have been impossible for them to discern truth from fiction in a reasonable time.  And even if it was known to be a lie, but was issued to try and draw attention away from Gray and diffuse anger at the police, so what? The entire city was trying to prevent riots.

And please show me where I cried about Mosby's presser. I have pointed out the hypocrisy in her efforts to silence defense counsel after holding multiple press conferences that served no legitimate purpose aside from getting her face on the news. I stand behind those comments.   She helped create this media circus and is evidentially intent on using the case to further her political cause even if it's not consistent with her obligation to do justice. I find that despicable. Her job is done in the courtroom, not the courthouse steps. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but she has an obligation to protect these officers right to a fair trial, which includes not feeding the media frenzy in my judgement.  I have also chastised her assistant for the vitriolic pleadings that lead only to the conclusion that they are being written for the media much more than the court.   But we digress.  I don't even comprehend how you can attribute the police stating there is a gang threat as anyway related to causing the riots. How do you link those two things? What evidence is there that the one influenced the other? It's frankly absurd to try and boil down the cause of the riots to a single thing, much less something like this.  In fact, per the news, the result may have been that gang leaders came out and tried to stop the violence. Subsequently, I think we learned that it was all bullshit, as those drugs were looted and have since flooded our streets. But nevertheless there were ""gang leaders"" coming out publicly against the riots and that seems to be a good thing to me.   And does the article say the Feds said it wasn't true before or after the statement was made? Not that I think that matters much.   I'm not even claiming it was true. It was probably flimsy from the outset, but so was all the other intelligence police were getting at the time. They could have filtered things more carefully, but what if some of these crazy threats were true? Could you imagine the reaction to the PDs failure to warn people - or its officers - of a threat they knew of but failed to do anything about.   And it may have even been total bullshit from the outset, but I sincerely doubt the PR people knew that when they repeated it. At worst it's a stupid cop making up a stupid rumor. If that's what happened he should be fired.  But there are no crimes on the books that I can think of that would cover something like this. Misconduct in office, maybe but I doubt it. If an officer totally concocted the rumor and put it in a report under penalties of perjury (unlikely) then it be perjury. But the reality is, as much as you might wish it to be so, there's nothing here that even suggests a crime, nothing that remotely would suggest the police were guilty of inciting a riot, and nothing that suggests anything other than the typical actions of a police force that is only marginally competent on good days."

First off, gun laws should be less restrictive in Maryland. If police focus on target hardening (which they should in a city like this), violent criminals would probably be less inclined to try some shit because they might wind up getting shot. Mainly, CCW should be legal.   But think of it this way - those crimes are much harder to make profitable than drug dealing. You can't commit $1k of burglaries every day and get away with it for very long. And all those narco cops? Well, they'd be available to tackle real crime. Crime against individuals.

Especially when you know that 175,000 number is going to include a lot of (if not mostly) the low-powered stuff attached to a shitload of Acetaminophen or the like.  Thinking a typical hydro script is 60 pills (2-a-day, 30 days), this is less than 3000 script bottles.  Then knock out half that for weak shit that no one can get high off of without immediately killing their liver and you're probably down to 1500.

baltimore,3b33yx,Stealing_Fire,2,Thu Jun 25 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"Ok let me explain a bit more clearly, because ""consent to committing a crime"" isn't a great way to phrase it.   The reason statutory rape laws exist is because juveniles lack the psychological ability to make serious choices reasonably. This is probably due to their prefrontal cortex (the impulse control center of the brain) not being fully developed, in the way that an adult's is. I believe that if neurological incapacity is the basis of creating one law, it should be the basis of creating other laws as well, such as laws dictating whether or not juveniles can be charged as adults, or whether or not they're responsible for their behavior at all. Now granted, if a 16 year old shoots someone, we have to do something. But is locking them away for years and years, purely as punishment, really the answer? How can we treat them as an adult in one context of the law, but not in another? It seems to be incongruent. If you have a reason to believe it makes sense, I'd certainly take it into consideration.   E: a word  E2: I'd like to add that maybe statutory rape isn't the best example. There are plenty of others, such as voting, driving, joining the military, smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol. Why should juveniles only be legally responsible for their action when it's a matter of punishing them, and not granting them rights/liberties?"
baltimore,3b33yx,XxCloudSephiroth69xX,3,Thu Jun 25 20:35:46 2015 UTC,"I think there's a large difference between not carefully evaluating the long term consequences of smoking and drinking and knowing right from wrong.  It's not ""wrong"" to smoke, drink, or have sex (16 is the age of consent in MD by the way), but we as a society have determined that juveniles lack the ability to correctly decide that at their age because the effects of those activities will not come into play for a very long time and because smoking and drinking could still cause developmental and growth problems as a juvenile.  Additionally, those activities don't really hurt anyone aside from themselves.  It is always wrong to violently attack someone, and you can't tell me that a 14-17 year old does not know this.  The only times juveniles are charged as adults are for violent crimes like armed robberies, shootings, serious aggravated assaults, murders, etc.  If you haven't figured out by 14 that it's wrong to commit a serious violent crime and physically hurt someone else unprovoked then you're better off in jail."
baltimore,3b33yx,Stealing_Fire,0,Fri Jun 26 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty well thought-out reply, thanks.    I think there's a large difference between not carefully evaluating the long term consequences of smoking and drinking and knowing right from wrong.   Here's the thing - from my point of view (that neurological incapacity should be the foundation of laws regarding juveniles), it all ties into the same psychological process - the decision making process. It's not so much that they don't know what's right and wrong, it's that they're incapable of fully understanding what that means, or why something is right or wrong in the first place.   One possible thought process is like this: ""I've been robbed, beaten, etc. plenty of times, so fuck it. Wrong stuff happens. Why should other people have it better than me?"" They aren't particularly good philosophers. Their world view has been shaped by a practically 3rd-world ghetto, and they don't even have a fully functional brain to balance it out.   Not to mention that with broken window policing, they've been told ever since they first broke the law with their buddies that they're criminals, causing them to just kind of accept that as fact (see labeling theory).  As I said, we can't just do nothing when a teenager shoots someone, but some type of psychiatric rehabilitation would probably be far more effective than 15 years in prison. They might even be able to contribute to society in some way. Let's face it - prison is just a big party where sociopaths can meet each other, and bring less antisocial people further down the path of evil through their manipulative tactics. One of my childhood friends became a sociopath, I've seen it happen. They just meet other sociopaths and gain ""strength in numbers,"" or find kids that aren't really that bad, and make them think doing bad things is cool or fun.   I'm just glad the feds are cracking down on solitary. Talk about a quick way to make the problem even worse..."

baltimore,3b3cbn,daltondynamite,6,Thu Jun 25 17:06:33 2015 UTC,I am a member of the rowing club which is in the Middle Branch Park. We've had things stolen out of our cars and a dead body or two wash up at our dock. I have personally witnessed people trying to steal our boating equipment but have never witnessed any violence by any means. We're usually out around 6-8pm but I would never go out there much later than that. Cherry Hill is notoriously a bad neighborhood and bad side of town. Maybe you'll find someone in this sub that lives over there but I commute to Middle Branch Park 3x a week.  During the day it's fine but you wouldn't catch me out there at night. Question - why are you moving to Cherry Hill out of all the places you could go in Baltimore? That's probably the last place I'd move to.
baltimore,3b3cbn,zblaxberg,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"I'm moving there because I'm broke and out of 10 apartments that I looked at and could afford, the one in Cherry Hill was the nicest. Thanks for your input."

If your driving to work and hitting the trail on foot, you'll be less likely to come walk in the foot print of the statistically higher foot prints for violent/aggressive crime. Just good people fishing off the docks, families, the rowing club is impressive, and canoe groups going out with Rec/Parks.  be aware of your surroundings anywhere you live, but the Gwynns Falls Trail is ridiculously safe in terms of violence.  Petty property crime is all that you'll see.  I know the trail well. Worked as a parking ranger just on the Gwynns Falls Trail and later park administrator of the parks.   One of my former bosses was senior level administrator at the highest levels of Baltimore city government (10 years ago) lived in an apartment in cherry hill. He loved it."
baltimore,3b43hr,maybebalto,7,Thu Jun 25 20:22:21 2015 UTC,The commute from Baltimore to Columbia is not the most pleasant. Lot's of traffic. I'd recommend looking for housing near Columbia. Catonsville and Ellicott City are areas closer to Baltimore. I'll ask redditors with more experience in those areas fill you in on whether they'd likely be a good fit for your family.
baltimore,3b43hr,Hazcat3,2,Thu Jun 25 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"This.  If you were at UMMS (U Maryland Medical System I assume) and were doing the baltimore campus, I'd say Roland park.  However, a lot of people I work with there live in ellicott city, and I'd say that would be the best bet for either downtown or columbia.  Unless your wife owns a liquor store in west baltimore, the tensions aren't an issue, and she'll be fine."

I'm sure there are many other nice neighborhoods, Roland Park, of course, Mt. Washington, and others. Medfield will be more affordable generally speaking."

baltimore,3b43hr,rhoran2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:13:13 2015 UTC,"When I was commuting from Hampden to Columbia it took me an hour. Traffic was bad-ish, not like D.C. beltway bad but still, lots of cars and it wasn't fun. I did travel during rush hour though. I always think avoiding 95/295 whenever possible is a good idea.And 70 during rush hour. Also all it takes is one accident and the 45 to an hour commute doubles."
baltimore,3b43hr,Hazcat3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:13:58 2015 UTC,hmm the last time I did a google direction search it seemed like the commute from columbia to baltimore was only about 30-45 minutes. I guess I will search again and look at the time differences.    What times are rush hour?
baltimore,3b43hr,Hazcat3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:48:59 2015 UTC,Might depend on where from and where to. Being at Federal Hill eliminates 20 minutes or so because it's quite close to getting on 95 if you go that way. It's a fun area though I don't have the impression it's geared for families generally speaking.
baltimore,3b43hr,otherfuckinTerps,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:52:53 2015 UTC,You took 40 right? By far the best way to get from Columbia to Baltimore in rush hour
baltimore,3b43hr,sydtron,4,Fri Jun 26 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"What are your recommendations for places to live either inside the city area or in the surrounding counties that would not be more than a 30 minute commute?    I'm not too good at which suburbs are optimum commuters into the city, but you definitely want to be in the suburbs given your background. You might not get your money's worth out of living inside the city.   . How are things there versus what is being reported in the news?   Overblown. People are 70% good, 30% bad. The riots were that 30% bad being brought to the forefront by a pretty minor fraction of the people that live in Baltimore. More people were out cleaning up the day after than burning it down the night before.   Koreans are a dime a dozen in Maryland and if someone is a dick to you, it's on the individual and not common among the city or the state. No one is really going to look at you sideways for being multiracial.    Is 85K a decent salary for the city area?   85 for the household is pretty decent for the area, for sure.   Are there any money sucks that I need to watch out/plan for? HOA fees? Parking costs? extra taxes ect?    Taxes vary county by county, Baltimore City certainly has the highest but it's not night and day. Maryland gets most of her revenue out of property/income tax -- sales tax doesn't apply to groceries or some services -- so the area in which you live will have the biggest impact on your take home. Given your income, I think you'll be more concerned with neighborhood feel than going by who takes the most out of your paycheck."
baltimore,3b43hr,baltimel,2,Thu Jun 25 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"If you live in the city, go with Locust Point... good for families and close to 95 South. I used to commute to Columbia everyday, and it usually took 30 minutes to get there and 45 to get home. And that was all the way near the mall. I'd say the benefits of city living outweigh the commute. Outside the city, check out Catonsville, Halethorpe, Columbia, Clarksville, or Ellicott City (which has a large Asian population)."
baltimore,3b43hr,rhoran2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:23:44 2015 UTC,I was going to suggest riverside which is right next to locust point.
baltimore,3b43hr,underwatertrees,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:15:11 2015 UTC,"First, as others have said, the kind of tension you're talking about isn't an issue. You'll be hard pressed to find anyone who will blink an eye at a caucasian man married to a Korean woman.   Ditto to Ellicott City and Catonsville. From what you've said, it sounds to me like you'd be happiest outside of the city itself. Ellicott City has a charming downtown of its own and a nice small town feel. The only down side is that it can be expensive and the traffic can be... intense. The same is true for Catonsville. It's nice, but a little pricey with lots of traffic, but that's because so many people like living there. (I'm a city dweller myself, but I can see the appeal.)  You can certainly live just fine on 85K in the county, assuming you're not carrying a big debt load. I would recommend renting for a year or so. It's a hassle to move twice for sure, especially with a baby, but even adjacent Baltimore neighborhoods can be very different from each other - not necessarily good and bad, but different character and feel.   Other areas to consider are Elkridge (very suburban, but generally more affordable), and some of the areas down 97 closer to Annapolis. I don't know those areas as well - maybe others can pipe in here - but that would give you access to both Baltimore City and Annapolis."
baltimore,3b43hr,elcad,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:12:11 2015 UTC,"Check out Dickeyville.  Quiet with lots of trees and parking, with quick access to the city and to 70 and 695.  Pretty much a world a part and worth a look for just for the novelty and beauty. Also it's close to Route 40 which seems to have become the the asian shopping area.  Like at least 5 full sized asian grocery stores, between the city and the next county over.    Does UMMS have different areas of operation or is it just the downtown location?"
baltimore,3b43hr,JesusOnTheDashboard,2,Fri Jun 26 03:20:36 2015 UTC,"My wife and I like Dickeyville too.  We're looking for a 4br house and there are a lot of nice, larger houses there.  I like the wooded lots and proximity to the park. My concerns are that it's so isolated from the rest of the city, and there are some sketchy neighborhoods close by.  I'm also not a fan of having those apartment buildings so close."

Consider swapping in the American Visionary Art Museum on Key Highway, across the street from the terrible restaurant Rusty Scupper. It isn't free to get in, but it sure is worth it.  Also, consider popping by Camden Yards to peek at the best park in baseball and maybe visit the two museums there, Sports Legends and Geppi's Entertainment Museum. Not far from there is the Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum.   The subway is useless. The Charm City Circulator is free (if a bit of a coin flip for reliability) and the light rail basically goes just north to south.

It's for untrained artists, tends to be 'Venice made from 10,000 toothpicks' and other obsessive type art. Saw an amazing stitchery exhibit there one year. A woman who escaped the Nazis did needlepoint and other stitching/sewing to create very large tableaus of her experience. There's nothing like seeing a little girl with yellow yarn hair hiding in the field from Nazi soldiers.  Take the free purple line to the Inner Harbor and you can visit the aquarium and take a water taxi ride across the harbor to the museum. You can take it to Little Italy for dessert at Vaccaro's as well."

I prefer the BMA because it has more modern stuff, but if you get a kick out of antiquities definitely go to the Walters. Can't help you on the Mexican food.

The street was littered with cigarette butts and I saw more empty liquor bottles on the streets then I saw on Bourbon street in New Orleans.

They assume that this war established the u.s. Government as a moral compass, as they believe it to be some altruistic endeavor. When it wasn't.   When in reality this same government was more than happy to send a specific race on death marches and violently expelled them from their lands, not even thirty years removed.   Even after the civil war the fed government persisted in imperialist adventures, and has fought numerous wars over oil. All the while extrajudicially kidnapping people and torturing them. It happily supports countries that oppress women and gays, and doesn't even bat an eye.   This same government has even kidnapped and experimented on its own citizens.

baltimore,3aufia,DoFunStuff,5,Wed Jun 24 02:34:00 2015 UTC,There was a guy in this thread somewhere who said he does legal work for the prison in Jessup where they make a lot of the license plates we use. It's also common knowledge that many prisons use license plate manufacture as one of the prison employment programs.  All that aside I do think it's inappropriate for any government agency to issue anything with a traitorous governments flag on it. Especially a government who only existed to allow slavery.
baltimore,3aufia,roadslaya,4,Wed Jun 24 15:01:33 2015 UTC,it's inappropriate for any government agency to issue anything with a traitorous governments flag on it   I couldn't agree more.  This is why I would like to know for certain that my tax dollars (and not simple 1:1 fees) are being used to produce these tags.
baltimore,3aufia,Dharma_Lion,2,Wed Jun 24 15:04:49 2015 UTC,I can't offer proof. I just happen to be of the opinion that if it comes from the government I've been taxed for it in some way since that's usually what happens to be true.

It's pretty easy to get a plate series there (easy money for the state), but the state rejected a plate design that used the Confederate flag. The group who wanted it sued saying that was a government restriction of free speech. I don't think the case is settled yet, but sounded like the court was leaning toward siding with the state. That case precedent might come up if MD gets rid of it and some people are mad about it.  Edit: looked it up. The court officially sided with the state on this one."

Perhaps a KKK hood for those who might want to be more overt.

While the flag has a negative history to it to some, others consider it their heritage and a memorial to fallen relatives. We're talking about the Sons of the Confederacy.

While the flag has a negative history to it to some, others consider it their heritage and a memorial to fallen relatives.   Sporting the flag doesn't mean you're a racist, but it is undeniably a symbol or emblem of racist ideals and slavery to just about everyone that sees it. Claiming ""southern pride"" because a family member fought to preserve the institution of slavery avoids these negative connotations precisely how? Why are people proud that their great great grand pappy died trying to preserve the awful institution of slavery?   My only knowledge of the sons of the confederacy came when I was in high school down south. I went to a mostly white school in the burbs and we went to the city to play a black school. Kids from my school drove up flying the stars and bars from everything imaginable. There was a small dust up, but the Sons of Confederacy had some asshole on TV claiming, just like you seem to do, that there's nothing inherently racist about that flag. That is utter bullshit that is completely divorced from all reality.   You cannot even think of the civil war without thinking of slavery - it was the predominant issue underlying the war at its inception and throughout the long campaigns that followed. That flag represents those ideals  and any attempt to claim to the contrary is unrealistic nonsense. I don't care if you call it heritage or not, that flag is emblematic of the same ideals it was emblematic of 200 years ago - the supposed inferiority of blacks and the values of the institution of slavery."

The Confederacy was a failed political state and slavery was not a benefiting system to its victims, the war was about Slavery and not a mythical ""state's rights "" argument, and its not even militarily accurate as many of the generals vilified in the movement for the Confederacy were a hell of a lot more successful at fighting the war in a defensive fashion than the celebrated hotheads that are popular for charging up hills or attacking undefended towns to slaughter women and children.

I'm agreeing with all your points, all I'm saying is that Jubal Early and many others attempted to rewrite history (after the fact) to change what the way was actually about.  The state's rights argument happens way after the war was over. In reality, the South was strongly against states rights, because it meant that Northern states could choose not to have slavery."

It lasted 4 years and for the most part, was never a functioning entity. A prime example is the self imposed Europe blockade in 1861, on the hope that this would force Europe to intervene and recognize the South. In reality, it encouraged Europe to invest in their oversea colonies for luxury items (killing the market for cotton) and Europe was NEVER going to risk alienating the North because they depended on the US for food at the time.   We could look at the railroad system of the South in which the government never invested into to just streamline the rolling stock...or the financial markets that the South destroyed by printing insane amounts of paper money to the point it was worthless...or the lynching of Unionists throughout the South (particularly in Texas)...I just don't get what people are basing their antebellum crap on."

But the president of the Baltimore police union noted that the policy mandating seat belts took effect April 3 and was e-mailed to officers as part of a package of five policy changes on April 9, three days before Gray was arrested.  Gene Ryan, the police union president, said many officers aren’t reading the new policies — updated to meet new national standards — because they think they’re the same rules they already know, with cosmetic changes. The updates are supposed to be read out during pre-shift meetings.  The previous policy was written in 1997, when the department used smaller, boxier wagons that officers called “ice cream trucks.” They originally had a metal bar that prisoners had to hold during the ride. Seat belts were added later, but the policy made their use discretionary."

This procedure should be evaluated on an individual basis so not to place oneself in any danger.  That the seat/restraint belt is placed securely around the waist or upper body of the arrestee to prevent the arrestee from maneuvering out of the restraint and possibly causing injury to them or others.   Seat belt policy reminders were part of roll call safety briefings at least as far back as the city having to pay dondi johnson's family more than seven million dollars because the cops killed him with the inside of a van.  So no, the officers would not be 'completely in the clear', and the department as a whole was indeed responsible for the safety of their prisoners, and none of these policies are new."

baltimore,3avcn2,SargonOfAkkad,4,Wed Jun 24 10:20:24 2015 UTC,"In a statement, Mosby denounced the release of the report and said her office did not release it to anyone. She has sought a protective order to keep evidence in the case out of public view. ""I strongly condemn anyone with access to trial evidence who has leaked information prior to the resolution of this case,"" Mosby said."
baltimore,3avcn2,stevetheserioussloth,6,Wed Jun 24 11:35:13 2015 UTC,"State's attorney Marilyn Mosby doesn't want it released to the public.  (Gee, I wonder why.)  Someone with a copy of it apparently let The Sun's reporter read it."
baltimore,3avcn2,SargonOfAkkad,4,Tue Jun 23 23:42:59 2015 UTC,"Actually she said she would release it if she could also release ""all discovery"" (which usually includes evidence that is inadmissible at trial)."
baltimore,3avcn2,monsda,12,Wed Jun 24 01:29:56 2015 UTC,"Just to follow up on your ""Gee, I wonder why"" -- Mosby already said that they wanted everything released or nothing until the trial happens. The purpose is because, as the state attorney, they have legal restrictions that the defense doesn't have as far as keeping evidence confidential. That means the defense can selectively release information/evidence that is beneficial to their case and possibly push some sway onto the public before the actual trial happens."
baltimore,3avcn2,TAU_equals_2PI,3,Wed Jun 24 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"Mosby already said that they wanted everything released    What she actually said is ""all discovery,"" which would include stuff that's inadmissible at trial like officers medical records, home addresses of family members etc."

baltimore,3avcn2,TAU_equals_2PI,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:21:39 2015 UTC,"As someone pointed out either here or in another comment thread, the medical definition of homicide is less than the legal definition of homicide.

It sounds like just an unfortunate accident."
baltimore,3avcn2,machine_restart,-5,Wed Jun 24 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this is where the Sun is supposed to post scans / anonymized copies of said report.  No proof, no truth.  Otherwise one must assume the most sinister of intentions of this ""leak""."
baltimore,3avcn2,SargonOfAkkad,12,Wed Jun 24 13:49:50 2015 UTC,"Not if the reporter was allowed to see the report in its entirety.  What you're saying would be true if only selected passages were leaked to the reporter.  A source might reasonably insist that the Sun not post actual copies, for fear it could identify him as the source of the leak, and cost him his job.  I think I remember cases where slightly different versions of a document were provided to different individuals, and the leaker was identified by which slightly different version appeared in the newspaper."
baltimore,3avcn2,ampetertree,6,Wed Jun 24 13:58:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe the other witness was right after all, the other transport witness then changed this story.   A prisoner sharing a police transport van with Freddie Gray told investigators that he could hear Gray “banging against the walls” of the vehicle and believed that he “was intentionally trying to injure himself,” according to a police document obtained by The Washington Post.   Probably why she wanted to block the release of the report"
baltimore,3avcn2,Bmorewiser,4,Wed Jun 24 01:35:35 2015 UTC,It's a fairly common tactic for arrestees to try to injure themselves in order to go to the hospital instead of prison.

But I think it would be premature to rule out the possibility that Gray caused some or all of his injury himself. It's certainly not likely, but it's also not unheard of for people in custody to bang their heads on shit. The high energy part seems to make it less likely that he intentionally broke his own neck, but who knows. I'm not an accident reconstructionist (and neither is the medical examiner I'd wager). There is still a lot we don't yet know."

Selected specifically because of their aromatic qualities, these Pacific Northwest varieties contribute a pungent blend of grapefruit, stone fruit, and floral notes. A generous malt bill and a solid dollop of honey provide just enough body to keep the balance in check, resulting in a remarkably drinkable rendition of the Double India Pale Ale style."

If you want to actually and reasonably talk about these things, I'd be happy to.  But if you're just going to swing in and call a person you disagree with a brain dead hack for not other reason than you disagree with him then I really won't give your comment much respect.  I don't know why we can't disagree without respecting another's viewpoint when there is nothing terribly offensive being said. I have a firm position on where I stand with the trade deal that I came to after a lot of thinking and research. Should I also call anyone who disagrees with me a brain dead hack? Is that how this sub should be, a binary system of a circle jerk or insulting others who might disagree as brain dead?  So, if you want to talk about legitimate problems let's do so, but at least with some level of respect and maturity."
baltimore,3aum97,belvebeer,3,Tue Jun 23 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"Thats quite the shift from what you were implying with your Illuminati Jew comment two posts ago   As I said, it was in response to your comment. I only followed your tone.   What exactly is your stake in advancing a trade deal that Sebators had to enter a secure area just by themselves, take notes and otherwise classified and shielded from the public?   Stake? I guess there is a small personal stake of general goods and services being cheaper to buy, but to be honest I'm really not too motivated by that personally.   I think though that it would be important for strategic relationships with other countries in East Asia. Additionally, I think that the purchasing power will increase for everyone, allowing more fruits and vegetables to be bought and consumed by poorer families. I think that service industries will also see more business as people generally have more disposable income due the cheaper goods elsewhere, generating more activity in the economy.  There will be job loss, especially in the front end of this deal, and I'm not sure how they should go about fixing that. Sure, a young factory worker could go and learn a new skill/trade, but the 40+ worker who is not anywhere near ready to retire is not in the same position. I think we have to help those people, but I am not sure how yet.  As for why it is secret, it is because it allows negotiations to be made without outside lobbyists attacking them for one representative or country bringing up any idea, and limiting their influence (there is still influence, but not as much as an open bill). If this were to be secret when actually being voted on, and the public couldn't see it, I would not support it in any way and think it pervasive. But I don't see the secretiveness of it any different than the Iran negotiations. It's a necessary part of negotiations with foreign countries, I feel.  The fast track does make it easier to pass mostly because it limits it from being amended by lobbyists and legislators. If every trade deal came back different from each country, we'd never have one accomplished. With so many different sovereign countries, we sacrifice a lot of control that we're used to. But that is an unfortunate reality.   Sometimes, brain dead is the nicest thing you can call someone.   I am being sincere here, I'm sorry you feel that way."

Oh I could go on and on about the decider, but hate is not something usually based on facts. It's based on subjective opinions of how much you really think someone is an asshole, like someone who steals the presidency in 2000, is a corporate shill, never attended a soldier's funeral, allowed torture, the Iraq war raised the federal debt by about $4 trillion, causing massive domestic spending cuts, cut income taxes mostly for the rich, cut Pell grants for poor students, told Brownie he was doing a heckuva job with Katrina, I could go on and on but I'm getting tired typing."

A lot of these newer cars are being stolen and/or broken into.

Today it's a symbol of hate, I really feel that most people display this flag have no idea what it means. However, I feel that statues and monuments are a completely different story.  My ancestors fought for both the union and the confederacy. On the union side, they were immigrants who were in this country for like 3 months and needed money. The one who fought for the CSA were from Mississippi and Virginia. They were extremely poor and didn't join the war until the Union was in their back yard.  I only bring this up because it really pisses me off when fucking racists use my ancestors to promote an anti-black agenda and it really pisses me off when other people compare my ancestors to nazi's when they didn't own slaves.   If you had family in America from before 1862, it's extremely likely they fall on one of these two sides."
baltimore,3aqryk,sydtron,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:20:07 2015 UTC,The vast majority of CSA soldiers were poor farmers who were forced to fight. They had no stake in slavery.

That's all I was saying.

The Confederates lost, just like every other evil that pops up -- be it the Nazis, the Stalinists in Russia or the Khmer Rouge. Countries founded on the principles of human rights violations don't lose, nor do they earn a place in history. You can read about them in books, but monuments to tyranny should be torn down.   Was there this much hand-wringing when people were tearing down statues to Stalin after the Berlin Wall fell, or is it just special to America that we romanticize awful human beings?"
baltimore,3aqryk,sydtron,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I disagree with your first statement but for the sake of argument let's go ahead and put that aside.    This wasn't us fighting the Nazis, or communists.  This was Americans fighting other Americans.  Bothers fighting brothers, e.g.  Most of them were fighting for their homes and family and many of them had a history of patriotic duty (Lee).  If your state suddenly declared secession and you had thousands of soldiers marching towards your home, you wouldn't try to defend it?  I'd like to say that I would fight for the union, but honestly, I don't know what I would have done.  Some people are so incredibly narrow minded and are convinced the entire world is against them."
baltimore,3aqryk,SonofTydeus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"This wasn't us fighting the Nazis, or communists.    It was fighting people who were just about as evil. Making a new country because your old one says black people aren't property isn't exactly a wholesome act.    If your state suddenly declared secession and you had thousands of soldiers marching towards your home, you wouldn't try to defend it   If my state seceded because they thought the most important part of government was ensuring that I could own black people as farm equipment, no, I wouldn't have tried to defend it. It's an indefensible position to fight for a country that unironically thinks black people are less than human.  We romanticize people who were evil and fought for evil causes. They claim heritage, but the heritage of the CSA was founded on evil.  Plus, there's the whole illegal secession thing. If those people didn't want to be killed by the government, then they shouldn't have broke the law WOKKA WOKKA WOKKA /s"

baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,4,Mon Jun 22 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, black lives matter.  But it's absurd to revise history to avoid offending modern sensibilities. At one point in our history we decided that Confederate Soldiers deserved to be honored and remembered for their sacrifices. They fought for what they believed in. They lost their lives protecting their homes and their families and their livelihoods. They were defending their right to own slaves, which, to modern sensibilities, is cruel and awful. But does that negate all of the other honorable parts of their fight?  I don't think so.  And I think it is pure ignorance to deface public property because you don't like what it stands for."
baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,-3,Tue Jun 23 15:14:41 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, it is a monument that stands for people who fought to break this nation apart, who fought for the right to own other people as slaves. There should not be monuments to them. There should not be rememberances of them. Commit them and their sins to the annals of history. They should not be lionized anywhere, much less in our majority-black city."
baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,7,Tue Jun 23 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"I seriously cant tell if these comments are satire or not. Destroying the history of Baltimore city as a reaction to a shooting is just crazy. You may not like it, but Baltimore does have a strong history of support for the CSA in the civil war and it is better to be confronted with that history than try to tear it down.  “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.”"

baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,-8,Mon Jun 22 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, ultimately I would like to see the statue put in a museum or, even better, have a modern statue erected right next to it that better reflects the values of our City.  That this ode to the CSA stands alone is insulting, however, because it is not what this City stands for any more. It should not be on public property by itself with the stamp of approval by our local government.   But no, it should absolutely not be destroyed."
baltimore,3aqryk,1hourphoto,13,Mon Jun 22 20:44:43 2015 UTC,I think up-rooting it and hiding it away in what I presume would be the Historical Society because you don't think people should be exposed it has the same effect.  The fact is that Baltimore was on the wrong side of history in the civil war and we owe it to our past to confront that rather than hide it.
baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,-5,Mon Jun 22 20:48:08 2015 UTC,"Right but it should not be put in a place of reverence.  Which it is, standing by itself in a highly visible spot on top of Bolton Hill."
baltimore,3aqryk,1hourphoto,9,Mon Jun 22 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"That isn't a particularly important place just because it's near MICA...  Its not like it's in the middle of a park, it's off to the side of a road by some rowhomes. Even if it was it still wouldn't be appropriate to destroy a piece of history just because we would rather forget that Baltimore was on the side of the Confederacy."
baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,-4,Mon Jun 22 20:58:35 2015 UTC,Right I'm not saying destroy it...I'm saying don't make it look like this statue represents Baltimore City in 2015.
baltimore,3aqryk,aresef,6,Mon Jun 22 21:00:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think it comes off that way at all, a war memorial is a very far cry from flying a flag at a statehouse.

baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"Right, but I was just offering another example.  Anyway, I'm not advocating that we pretend the Civil War never happened, that slavery shouldn't happen. However, we are under no obligation to build monuments to the fact that it did. Historic sites like Hampton provide education on the way people lived then, but they do not celebrate the fact that the Ridgely family owned slaves."
baltimore,3aqryk,noahsense,3,Tue Jun 23 21:58:40 2015 UTC,And no one is advocating for building monuments.  I'm just against the destruction of existing historical sites.
baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,-2,Tue Jun 23 22:29:54 2015 UTC,Is a monument a historical site? I don't think it is. It is an object on public property that represents a message the government has no obligation to convey.
baltimore,3aqryk,ReilaReborn,2,Tue Jun 23 22:42:21 2015 UTC,And that the government has no obligation to destroy to soothe your hurt feelings.
baltimore,3aqryk,aresef,-2,Tue Jun 23 23:01:11 2015 UTC,But the government also has no obligation to endorse the soldiers of hate. The Supreme Court ruled on as much just a couple of weeks ago in a case about Confederate flag license plates in Texas no less.
baltimore,3aqryk,Slowhand09,4,Tue Jun 23 23:06:07 2015 UTC,Not destroying something does not mean endorsing it. That comparison would only be valid for the building of new monuments.

The irony is that many people will argue against destroying part of our history while being totally ok with the wholesale removal of black history from the history books. ""It was about states rights! Not slavery"" and the Tuskegee Syphillis study are just two things that come to mind.  Perhaps these statues aren't offensive to some white people but they are completely offensive to most people of color who have ancestors who were slaves."
baltimore,3aqryk,Slowhand09,3,Tue Jun 23 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"Studying and understanding history is completely inconsistent with destroying it.

While the city is home to two HBCUs and has the Baltimore Scholars program at JHU (full disclosure: a relative, a professor emeritus, is involved in and contributes to that program), that does not negate the fact that if you are born black in Baltimore, you have an astonishingly lower chance at success than if you are white. There are parts of the city with lower life expectancy than North Korea. There are large swaths of the city without access to healthy food.  O'Malley's zero tolerance policing didn't put foot patrols in Roland Park. It victimized black neighborhoods, arresting people on bullshit offenses, giving them a choice of three options: find some way to make bail (good luck with that), stay in jail until it's time for your trial (and lose your job) or plea out.

Let's be real, the Union did not fight to end slavery and Lee freed his slaves in 1862.

I ask rhetorically why a culture with a rich history would burn their heritage.  I am opposed to destroying Baltimore's Confederate statues for the similar reasons. This is the history of the city, wrong as it may be. This is how our immediate forebears wanted to be remembered, and that the ""virtues"" they championed turned into stark indictments in the fullness of time is the sweetest irony . Defacing or removing statues doesn't absolve any sins, it's just a cheap attempt at collective amnesia.  Its not like there's a movement to replace the offending statues.  ""Tear it down"" is plain shitty. How about taking Wyman Park's lead and commissioning a statue to offset the Confederate one? How about creating, and make positive art as a response? Destroy your own fucking neighbor, please stay out of mine."
baltimore,3aqryk,fireberts,2,Mon Jun 22 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"I think you have an extremely naive point of view calling these monuments and history wrong. The mid 1800s were a much different time and people lived with different mind sets. The average confederate soldier probably saw joining the war as a way of maintaining the way of life he knew and enjoyed (including slavery). We think of slavery as wrong today but those were significantly different times over 150 years ago. I bet slavery was often viewed as just being ""the way things are."" You can see older people displaying these tendencies today even, granted not about slavery.  Shoukd we call a monument to German soldiers who died in WWII wrong? Sure there are many cases of horrible acts of brutality but I'm willing to bet the average German soldier was not that bad of a person. He was probably someone you and I could be friends with. He didn't hate the Jews or anyone else. Maybe he got caught up in the brainwashing of the time and thought he was defending his country he loved.  Analyzing history in a modern context is a waste of time. You really have to consider the time period."

But I do think people should know that Baltimore City is home to 3 confederate monuments out of 4 Civil War monuments total, and I do think that these monuments lack context. Baltimore was a deeply conflicted place in the Civil War. While Confederate flags are common throughout Southern and rural Maryland, I think Baltimoreans like to see themselves as Northerners. But we weren’t, and these monuments display that. For me, that history is relevant to Baltimore today and we shouldn’t forget it because it’s uncomfortable, and we should be aware of how that legacy plays out in 2015 and each year on Martin Luther King Jr. weekend at the Lee-Jackson equestrian statue."""

If we need a statue up in a black majority city to say ""Oh, maybe we shouldn't start a war that causes the most significant loss of American lives in the history of America because we think the most fundamental underpinning of government is guaranteeing the right to own human beings as farm equipment"" then maybe we might ought to re-think this whole society thing. Plus there's the whole Fugitive Slave Act, which debunks the ""states right"" theory because nothing screams states rights like ignoring what another state thinks about human beings because your farm equipment ended up across a border.  Besides, aren't we being overly sensitive if we get upset that there could be a populist movement to rid ourselves of such statues? Cuts both ways. Someone is going to have their feelings hurt, and complaining about the other side having their feelings hurt is a little too comical."

Butler, who had entered the city, under cover of darkness and during a thunderstorm, from Annapolis via the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.[5] During the night, Butler and his men erected a small fort, with cannon pointing towards the central business district. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the Federal Government under threat of force. This fort and the Union occupation persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannons, and a small Grand Army of the Republic monument remain to testify to this period of the hill's history."

There's a difference between memorializing the event and triumphing the ideologies.  But, that difference is a lot like 'common sense'; everyone understands it but it's different for everyone.  At the end of the day, it was Americans fighting Americans.  The Generals of the Confederacy were Americans, and in many ways they themselves were honorable even when their ideologies were not.  It was a different time.  It doesn't make the views any less abhorrent, but to me it's the difference of catching a 3 year old with his dick out in public vs a 10 year old vs a 45 year old man.  It's not a good thing to do, and it's not ok, but those doing it were more ignorant than we are today.  Remembering them as Americans is, to me, important.

I don't want to make people cheer that moment, I want them to see it, viscerally. In life-size.   I think this captures the issue of context here. Imagine two statues. One is of firehoses being turned on protesters, a whole dramatic scene immortalized in stone. The other is just a statue of the men who used the firehoses, standing on a pedestal, with an inscription that reads ""DEDICATED TO THEIR CAUSE"".    That's the problem here. Using the Jackson/Lee statue as an example, there's no context to consider. They are literally put on a pedestal. The inscription out front regards them as Christian soldiers and gentlemen. The quotes that wrap around the pedestal are done in a way that the only words visible in the front are ""PURPOSE * * * SO GREAT"". It'd be ideal if this statue served as a lesson on the folly of the Confederacy, the preservation of the Union, the evil of slavery, and the inherent flaw in humanity that can cause seemingly otherwise honorable men to fight valiantly for an inhuman cause. But it doesn't. It honors them and their cause.    Instead of a proud memorial, why not have a statue of Lee shirtless, on the ground, his back covered in whip scars? Or, if that's too extreme, why not at least add a full memorial of a slave auction right behind every statue of Lee proudly riding his horse into battle, thereby showing what it was he was fighting for? Or maybe just a statue of Lee, alone, horseless, no pedestal, sinking into a pool of quicksand shaped like the Confederate flag, head hanging just below eye-level of an average onlooker?    I agree with everything you say about capturing defining moments rather than hiding them. If we hide the blemishes of our history, we never learn from them. I just think that current Confederate statues, memorials, parks, street names ... these honor that past rather than capturing the moment and context in a way that we constructively learn from."
baltimore,3ar0js,ArthurRiot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think this idea would be melding person with political cause, though.  If it were the statue of Jefferson Davis, then ok, I get it.  But soldiers... Schwarzkopf was a general, who wasn't there to create governmental policy.  He was supposed to just protect the Union.  During WWII, German and Allied soldiers would respect each other's fallen, even when their government's wouldn't.  Maybe I separate them too much, that's possible, but I think that there's a difference between a soldier and a politician.  Once a soldier becomes a politician (Ike, Washington, Grant, McCain for example), that line blurs pretty badly.  But I don't think Lee or Jackson ever did anything beyond military.  All this said, there is still a great point you make; when the statue goes outside simple representation of moment and into representation of who a person is, it gets murkier.    But this is really something I want to say; it's different making a statue vs naming a location after someone.  Having a statue of Reagan is very different from naming an airport after him.  Or a street.  those are honors, not historical acknowledgements. Street names?  Sure, fuck that.  Rename the streets.  Parks?  WTF.  But statues?  those, to me... they SHOULD evoke this type of passion."

Generals, fighting a war.  One side wanted to be recognized as an independent nation, the other wanted the country to remain unified.  The reasons for that war happening were political, and ideological.  But the war itself was not.    On both sides, everyone was American.  Both sides were fighting 'for' America.  And neither sides' view of how people should be treated still exists today; both have evolved.    Statues are one of the most functional pieces of everyman art in existence.  They are public, large, and accessible (hopefully).

I also don't think anyone is 'celebrating' these statues (well you never know, I suppose) any longer. They stand as a reminder of another time. Reminders don't always have to be positive. I'd also beg to differ about those who founded the country, there was a pretty heavy abolitionist movement then yet they still chose to allow it.

We almost exclusively create statues to celebrate individuals though.    They stand as a reminder of another time.   Maybe to you, but when we use the same avenues to celebrate greatness (naming statues, parks, airports and highways) that we use to honor the past, don't you see how that is confusing? We have very few statues to our shameful events (I would guess less than 1%) which is why these feel less like remembering history than honoring it.

baltimore,3ar0js,DXBtoDOH,2,Tue Jun 23 14:25:32 2015 UTC,"Baltimore was a very pro-Confederate town at the onset of the Civil War. Only the Northern forces and some pragmatism among some of the politicians prevented Maryland from seceding, in fact, the governor at the time did everything he could to avoid a secession vote/referendum, which likely would have seen Maryland vote to join the confederacy.  While Baltimore is now known as an industrial, or rather, post-industrial city, for much of its history it was primarily a trading and mercantile city and much of the city's trade was with the South. After the Civil War Baltimore retained strong links with the southern states as their major port and trading hub, so many ex-Confederates moved to Baltimore and kept the memory of the Confederacy alive. At the time the monuments were constructed, much of the city's elite had grandfathers who fought for the Confederacy. This was bolstered by the remnants of Maryland's old plantation gentry in the surrounding counties, southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore. Maryland was definitely a ""southern"" state up through, say, WWII. Jim Crow existed in Maryland, including Baltimore. Baltimore was home to one of the first, if not actual first, legally allowed deed restrictions barring sale of property to African Americans, which wasn't overturned by the SC until the 1940s. Baltimore schools were segregated.   So, yeah, Baltimore does have a pro-Southern history."

Here immortal Poe illumined living letters with his lyre; Here Lanier's uplifting measures taught the world a fresh desire; Here the tradesman and the statesman, here the gallant hearts of yore Came to build a beauteous city -- Baltimore, our Baltimore!  Here the charm of parks and gardens, here the spirit of the home; Here the music of the morning in the wind across the foam. Here the teacher and the prophet, here the sermon and the song, Keep the higher beauty burning and the nobler purpose strong: Here the church and here the temple teach our hearts their hallowed lore; Here hath Science wed with Healing -- Baltimore, our Baltimore!  God of grace, thou great Jehovah, make us grateful, keep us true, That these gifts of light and leading may enchain our hearts to you; That in clearer vision growing men may follow still the gleam, As a righteous city blossoms in the golden years of dream: Here where Art and Learning beckon, Justice pleads for rich and poor, God to guide, and man to worship -- Baltimore, our Baltimore!"

baltimore,3anx4d,Redding30265,3,Thu Jun 25 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, mice in the old row homes are common. Keeping your house clean is good of course, but keep in mind that if your neighbors are filthy there's not a whole lot you can do about it. They will attract the mice, and the mice will find their way into your home through the walls.  If you decide to do a big deep clean with a professional, remember that it's just as important to keep things clean on a day-to-day basis. Don't leave food out. If you have a pet, this applies to them too -- have set feeding times, and put away anything that they haven't finished. Put grains, cereal, etc. in sturdy food bins, glass is good.  Your best bet is to buy some of the cheapy snap traps. Bait them with peanut butter or something else sticky that they can't just pick up without setting the trap off. Put out a lot of them. Don't fuck with humane traps. They're pests, and a vector for disease. Kill them. The snap traps are pretty cheap so if you're squeamish you can just put the whole thing in a bag and toss it. But if it gets bad enough you will get hardened and pry those dead assholes out of the trap and reset it.  Worth noting that if you ever have evidence of a rat that has made its way into your home, that is a serious safety risk. If you contact 311 for their Rat Rubout program they will send someone out to eradicate them. (Again, this is only for rats that are inside your home.)"
baltimore,3anx4d,theycallmecrabclaws,2,Mon Jun 22 04:01:00 2015 UTC,"Local exterminator told me he wouldn't take my money to eradicate mice ""if your neighbors aren't clean they will come in.""

baltimore,3am3zz,SawdustDandruff,8,Sun Jun 21 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"Moving from Florida to Maryland these are the snow things everyone took for granted and didn't think to tell me when I would ask:   Don't turn your car on to melt the snow on it when the tailpipe is still under snow.  Gasses will go into the cabin of the car. During winter turn off the water to your outdoor water spigot and open the spigots so the water drains out.  This is to keep them from freezing, bursting, and the leaking when spring comes.  Also don't leave the hose attached to the spigots.  The attached hose makes it more likely that it'll freeze. People shovel the snow not because it's annoying to have to trudge through snow, but because if you don't shovel the snow it turns to ice in a few days and becomes very slippery to walk on.  And once it's ice it's very difficult to remove until it melts.    My friend back in Florida asked me why I even needed to shovel at all and I forgot that I used to not know why.  The other tips just involve driving slowly and not making any sudden turns when the roads are snowy and icy.  You will lose control of the car.    EDIT: Those are all things I learned by making the mistake myself."

As far as snow goes, you shouldn't have to worry too much. Baltimore doesn't get that much on the average winter. This last year had the most I've seen in my seven winters here. If it's an inch or two, just drive a little slower and be a little more sluggish starting, stopping, and taking turns. No big deal! If it's much more than that, MICA closes (whether studios stay open or not is another matter). No real need for things like snow tires or whatever - we don't even do that back home in Massachusetts - just keep a car cleaning brush in the trunk, and it doesn't hurt to have a shovel even if your landlord is SUPPOSED to do it."

Frank and Claire's place from the first couple seasons of House of Cards? Exteriors of that were shot in Bolton Hill. Other nice neighborhoods nearby include Charles Village, Station North, Hampden and Mount Vernon.  Snow exists. Be prepared, get ice scrapers and stuff. Be sensible. The city is known to look the other way for the technically illegal but socially acceptable lawn chair method of saving street spots you spent your valuable time cleaning.  Transit is an option to get to MICA. It's off the UB-Mt. Royal light rail. Light rail runs north to Mt. Washington, Timonium and Hunt Valley, south to downtown, the stadiums and BWI. MICA is also close to Amtrak and MARC service at Penn Station. MARC can get you to DC for $8 each way.  Every summer is Artscape, a street festival that MICA is one of a number of hosts to. It includes street performances, exhibits, food and music. This summer, for example, they have P-Funk and Michael Franti & Spearhead among the acts on tap.  Sports: this fall, with luck, the Orioles will still have quite a number of weeks left to play. The Ravens are also great fun, but tickets are crazy pricey. Swing up to Towson for cheap, fun times at a college football or basketball game.

If you have a car with a trunk, don't keep it there, because large amounts of snow are heavy, and the truck is inaccessible until it has been cleared.  *Side note: ALWAYS CLEAR YOUR ROOF.

baltimore,3aprvg,bmoreddit,11,Mon Jun 22 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"Lee means nothing to me; his name is just part of history.   But at the same time, I can understand why people, especially those whose understanding of the civil war is limited to a few days lecture in school, might take offense to having a park named after the man who led an army to protect the institution of slavery. Certainly, the politicization of these issues is unfortunate, but it's also somewhat inevitable. I think Black people are tired of being told that racism doesn't exist, or that the problems in their community are not attributable to centuries of racist policies that trace back to slavery and Jim Crowe. To some, the name of the park is a meaningless historical anachronism, to the educated it's probably just seems to be in recognition of a controversial man's contributions to the city, but to others it's a reminder that many people just don't care about the difficulties black's have faced and continue to face.   Rightly or wrongly, Lee is a symbol for many of the racist policies that pervaded this country and his veneration serves as an unwelcome reminder. If renaming the park might provide a symbolic, though perhaps pyrrhic, step forward then I'm all for it."

He was an American hero in the Mexican-American War and then spent 3 years in Baltimore designing and supervising the construction of Fort Carroll to further protect the Port of Baltimore.   He only joined the Confederate Army to defend his home state of Virginia and historians suggest he was actually against slavery despite the leader of this petition clearly grouping him in with confederates as a de facto racist despite the fact it was 18fucking60. He initially accepted a promotion to Colonel for the Union before Virginia seceded but then had to resign from the US Army. In response to being asked to defend Washington for the Union,   ""Mr. Blair, I look upon secession as anarchy. If I owned the four millions of slaves in the South I would sacrifice them all to the Union; but how can I draw my sword upon Virginia, my native state""  People need to realize the park is named in his honor for what he did for the city of Baltimore, not what he had to do for his home state of Virginia.

Clearly Lee is overwhelmingly known not for building Fort Carroll, but for leading the army of the Confederacy, which was founded on the principal of white supremacy and fought to defend the right to own slaves. It is not necessary to parse Lee's biography to suggest we should be giving places of honor to ANY leaders of the Confederacy. As someone who lives in this neighborhood, I know the name makes a lot of us uncomfortable, and I know several African-Americans who avoid or refuse to go into the park because of the connotations of the name. What's absurd is that Americans should be made to feel uncomfortable in their own public parks because they're named after people who led armies fighting to enslave them."

The only reason the south seceded was because Lincoln became president and the south feared his presidency would lead to the abolition of slavery. That is absolutely it.   You suggest slavery was one of many state rights the war was fought over - I'd love to hear what other state right was so important and so threatened by Lincoln that it deserved starting a civil war over?"
baltimore,3aprvg,gbatt1024,-4,Mon Jun 22 23:29:18 2015 UTC,"Obviously their number one ""right"" they tried to protect was slavery, and that it should be determined by state. My poorly worded argument was mainly that it is more complicated than solely saying they fought on the principle of white supremacy. Slavery and cotton were the entire basis of the South's economy and way of life. It was far more about money and their livelihoods than hating black people. The only reason the North started to come around to abolishing slavery was the influx of European immigrants willing to work for next to nothing which eliminated their dependency on it. The South at the time however still was dependent upon the entire institution."

These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.

Maybe she wanted to honor him for building Fort Carroll. Maybe she wanted to do it for his good work leading an army fighting to defend slavery. Or for that army's efforts to re-enslave free blacks in land they captured in the north. As I said, Lee is OVERWHELMINGLY known in history as a representative of the Confederacy, just as the Confederate flag is a symbol of same. You can argue forever about what they mean to YOU, but broadly, they are undeniably symbols of a nation that fought for the right of one race to enslave another.

baltimore,3aprvg,paddlebawler,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:46:24 2015 UTC,"Lost Cause of the Confederacy:       The Lost Cause is a regional American cultural movement, based in the South, seeking to reconcile the traditionalist white society of the antebellum South that they admire, to the defeat of the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War of 1861–1865.  It forms an important minority viewpoint among the ways to commemorate the war. The United Daughters of the Confederacy is a major organization that has propounded the Lost Cause for over a century.  Supporters typically portray the Confederacy's cause as noble and most of its leaders as exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry, defeated by the Union armies through numerical and industrial force that overwhelmed the South's superior military skill and courage. Proponents of the Lost Cause movement also condemned the Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, claiming that it had been a deliberate attempt by Northern politicians and speculators to destroy the traditional Southern way of life. In recent decades Lost Cause themes have been widely promoted by the Neo-Confederate movement in books and op-eds and especially in one of the movement's magazines the Southern Partisan.  The architects of the Lost Cause acted from various motives. They collectively sought to justify their own actions and allow themselves and other former Confederates to find something positive in all-encompassing failure. They also wanted to provide their children and future generations of white Southerners with a 'correct' narrative of the war.
