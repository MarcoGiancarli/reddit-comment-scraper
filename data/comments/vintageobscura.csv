vintageobscura,3duth2,chem-farmer,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"From Discogs:   ""Four young Turks from different Anatolian villages met and became friends during the 1960s, discovering in common their taste both for the traditional music of their land and for the new kind of music that Europe called ""pop"". Their names were Murat Ses, Cahit Berkay, Taner Ongur, and Engin Yorukoglu, all of them skilled musicians playing traditional Turkish instruments, to which they had added guitar, piano and organ by the time they launched themselves as a group in 1967. The Mogol (Mogollar in their own language) immediately leapt to the top place in the Turkish Hit Parade, an honour that had normally been reserved to British and American successes. Their kind of music, based on the exotic folklore heritage of Anatolia, enriched by modern rhythms merged with the impassioned strains of the Turkish national idioms, stimulated the formation of numerous other new groups. Even to the limits of the remotest Turkish villages, Anadolu (Anatolian) ""pop"" has achieved an immense public following."""

vintageobscura,3d92h4,mindlesspleasures,2,Tue Jul 14 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"The Feminine Complex are a relatively obscure all-girl 60’s psych/garage band from Nashville, Tennessee. It almost seems too good to be true. And for many it is. Often dismissed as a hoax from even usually reliable sources such as Allmusic.com; ‘An obscure and quite possibly fictitious all-girl 60’s garage band from Nashville, Tennessee’.   However, if it is a hoax - it certainly is an elaborate one. What little can be found about the band on-line include anonymous reviews adamantly testifying to the authenticity of the band:   ‘The Feminine Complex was a real band, I heard them play on numerous occasions. The album was also real, I used to own a copy that I purchased when it came out. I understand that studio musicians were used on the album, but since this is still a practice by major artists, including Alabama, this doesn't make it any less real. It was definitely them doing the vocals. It was released in 1969, I obviously could not have purchased it then otherwise, so it definitely was not a hoax. The original album was professional and polished, but they were better live, because they were pretty, they were professional, they were entertaining, and they did not take themselves too seriously. Going to their shows was a blast, and no two shows were ever the same. They were one of the first all girl groups in rock 'n' roll and if there were no other reason than that, the album is well worth buying, but the album has a certain charm,  and if you like sixties music, then you'll like this album.’   Not to mention, a host of photo’s and a credible enough biography:   ‘The greatest garage-pop record you may never have heard was cut by a group of Maplewood High School girls' basketball teammates in 1969. As The Feminine Complex, they put out a single LP, Livin' Love, before calling it quits and moving on with their lives — only to be rediscovered a quarter-century later and reissued in 1996 by TeenBeat Records impresario Mark Robinson. The LP version was recut with session players and features Famous Flames-style horns; but the demo version features the teen bandmates, revved up and eager to prove their prowess to ""not bad for a bunch of girls"" disbelievers.’   However, as difficult as it is to discern what can and cannot be believed on-line the most compelling and believable source is from ‘Nashville Scene’ editor-in-chief Jim Ridley who is described as ‘not only been with our little rag for the better part of two decades — he's also a native Middle Tennessean and longtime local-music aficionado’ who writes a detailed and definitive piece about all-things Nashville rock ‘n’roll whilst dedicating the last quarter of the article to dispelling many of the rumours that abound about this enigmatic band:   Listening to Livin' Love 26 years after the fact, it remains an utterly engaging document of the Feminine Complex's incredible potential. However, many of the band's male peers saw them as little more than a novelty. Ask any veteran of the local rock scene then what he thought of the band, and his response will likely be, ""Well, they were good for girls."" Pat Patrick, for one, gives the group a little more credit: ""They were breaking new ground all around. They were tight when they played live. It was so unique, though, that, of course, the first reaction was, 'Man, they're good for girls.' At that point, you never saw a female bass player or drummer, you just didn't. I remember the bass player blew me away.""  Ironically, to the best of anyone's recollection, Livin' Love largely features the instrumental talents of session musicians. (Williams, for her part, remembers having to show her bass licks to a studio pro.) The playing is definitely slick, but Lee Hazen's engineering and Rick Powell's snappy production deserve a mention in and of themselves: ""Time Slips By,"" which closed the album, was a triumph of studio wizardry, brimming with psyched-out guitar effects and primitive feedback. Most remarkable of all was the fact that this mind-altering stereophonic action only served to enlarge Mindy Dalton's pop sensibilities to near-epic proportions.  Indeed, even if the members of the Feminine Complex didn't play on their own record, Livin' Love still proved that Dalton had developed into a fine vocalist and an excellent songwriter - which the local music scene clearly lacked at the time. Songs like ""Are You Lonesome Like Me"" and ""It's Magic"" suggested a womanly sophistication far beyond her 18 years, while ""I Won't Run"" was a supremely catchy pop tune, pure and simple. Williams, who had contributed the equally infectious ""Forgetting,"" remembers being fairly impressed by Dalton's lyrics. After hearing some of her songs, ""we'd go, 'Wow! What have you been doing?'""  Unlike many of their male counterparts, none of the members of the Feminine Complex went on to pursue careers in the music business. Nor did their band experience serve as a revolutionizing or liberating force in their lives. They all went on to the kind of lives led by so many other female baby-boomers: They got married and raised families. (Dalton, however, did manage to combine both music and domesticity for a while; she spent the better part of two decades playing in a band, Dotson and Co., with her husband at the time.)   It is an interesting article if you’re interested in that kind of musical history and the rest of the article can be read here: http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/burnet/nashrock.html  In other music related trivia the song 'Love Love Love' was included in the soundtrack to a weird little film from 1997 - ‘Six Ways to Sunday’. The film stars Debbie Harry (‘Blondie’) as an incestuous over-bearing mother; Isaac Hayes (‘South Park’) as a cop whose song ‘What a Friend We Have in Mother’ is on the soundtrack also; and Adrien Brody (‘The Pianist’) as an inept hommie gangster wannabe. And if you have difficulty believing this also here’s the trailer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlmBKkd_Yxo  The film can be viewed on Youtube also but is only recommended if you like your comedy ‘bible black’."

All I know about Montage is this: They formed in Denver in the early seventies. Dad said they covered bands like Blue Cheer and Iron Butterfly. They had a manager/booking guy and once toured for six months so I imagine demos were recorded in the process. They would play from Tuesday through Saturday in one bar and then move on to the next city. There were five people in the band. Two of them were women and three were men playing guitar, bass, drums, and electric organ. I received the information through oral transmission so it not be completely accurate."

He was a friend of Bob Dylan and a large enough influence to earn a mention in his first album.  Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies is an Appalachian folk ballad that's been performed by just about everyone.

Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat….”  With this in mind I’ll leave the rest to the ‘arch-drude’ Julian Cope from his POSTPUNKSAMPLER:  “Denmark’s finest punk band, the Sods generally did ‘Punk’ very well, a smorgasbord of white reggae, Siouxian guitar noise, Wire ramalama, but all performed with enough conviction to achieve a believable hybrid; even the Sods’ name was a clever enough catch-all. Herein, they skank and stutter like De Presse covering the Ruts, a Malcolm Owen-as-Strummer bark doubles as lead vocal whilst proto-J. Div extraneous noise hoses the backing track and urbanizes the proceedings. Later, as Sort Sol, the same quartet successfully converted to genuine serious grey-button-down Post-Punk”"

Stinky Toys played at the now legendary ‘100 Club Punk Special’ at London’s ‘100 Club’ in 1976 supporting the Vibrators, The Damned, Buzzcocks (the previous night’s line-up was Subway Sect, Siouxsie & the Banshees, The Clash, Sex Pistols).

The song sounds like ‘Television’ had Debbie Harry from ‘Blondie’ sang lead vocals. Though obviously not as good as either of those aforementioned bands. But as they say – imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.    However it is rumoured that the Blondie song ‘Denis’ is about Jacno (real name – Denis Quillard) http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/dec/09/remembering-jacno  And one last piece of useless musical trivia – the Uruguayan born lead singer Elli Medeiros is now an actress, chanteuse and sometime paramour of film director Brian De Palma (‘Blow Out’, ‘Scarface’, ‘Body Double’)"

vintageobscura,3b9ujo,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:12:59 2015 UTC,"Sevdalinka:       Sevdalinka (pronounced [seʋdǎliːŋka]) is a traditional genre of folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sevdalinka is part of the Bosniak culture,     but is also popular across the ex-Yugoslavia region, especially in Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. The actual composers of many sevdalinkas are unknown.  In musical sense, sevdalinka is characterized by a slow or moderate tempo and intense, emotional melodies. Sevdalinka songs are very elaborate, emotionally charged and are traditionally sung with passion and fervor. The combination of Oriental, European and Sephardic elements make this type of music stand out among other types of folk music from the Balkans. Like a lot of Balkan folk music, sevdalinka features very sombre, minor sounding modes, but unlike other types of Balkan folklore it more intensely features minor second intervals, thus hinting to Oriental makams and the Phrygian mode. As a result, the melodies are noted for leaving a strong melancholic feeling with the listener.  The singer will often impose the rhythm and tempo of the song, both of which can vary throughout the song. Traditionally, sevdalinkas are women's songs, most addressing the issue of love and longing, unfulfilled and unfortunate love, some touch on a woman's physical desire for her loved one, and some have comic elements. Currently they are often performed by men as well. Traditionally, they were performed without any instrument, hence their elaborate melody. As with most old folk styles, it is pure assumption what the sound of original melodies were like, as in modern days their interpretations are fully aligned to the Western chromatic system due to instruments used for accompaniment (whereas Oriental modes often use intervals smaller than a semitone). Modern interpretations are followed by a small orchestra featuring the accordion (as the most prominent instrument), the violin, nylon-string guitars and/or other string instruments, occasionally (such as oud, saz or šargija), the flute or clarinet (occasionally), upright bass and the snare drum. In modern interpretations, between the verses, an accordion or violin solo can almost always be heard.

The Sacramento outfit did play quite a bit live in California in the last half of the 1960s, and did a lot of unreleased recordings in 1968 and 1969 that never saw the light of day. This condition was remedied in 2002, when an astounding full, double-CD of tracks was issued, Gotta Survive, mostly taken from those unissued late-'60s sessions. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-nuisance-mn0000307045  It's pretty extraordinary for a band who never even released a record to have a two-CD package prepared in their honor more than 30 years after they disbanded. That's what you get with this double-disc set, largely devoted to unreleased recordings by Public Nuisance from late 1968 and early 1969 http://www.allmusic.com/album/gotta-survive-mw0001893156"

Or we could do clips first, see what what samples we grab and then we work a plot out from there, a whole new genre of film, we use background music to tie it together so the cuts don't freak the watcher out."

vintageobscura,395b3p,mindlesspleasures,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:40:49 2015 UTC,As Rudi Protrudi from the (80’s-present) New York 60’s rock revival band ‘The Fuzztones’ has pointed out -  a lot of this music is now in hindsight called ‘garage’. In the 60’s it was not called ‘garage’. There was no such term. You heard this kind of music on the radio along with everything else – it was simply called ‘Top 40’.
vintageobscura,395b3p,MLein97,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:42:03 2015 UTC,"Technically, this wasn't on one of the major labels so it wouldn't be top 40 as we know it today, but it would be a top 40 sound because that was the only choice. Granted it was top 40 of each station or market and not clearchannel top 40 where it's nationwide and it's not actually top 40 because of how the top 40 charts are set up in favor of the majors. Here's what the top 100 best selling singles of 1967 looks like.  This actually was a demo single which the band recorded and self released on their own and with the demo single the band was hoping to be picked up by a major. Garage is more like local band that is actively trying for national success, like indie bands, in the era before the Zeppelin model was popularized where you do live shows and album focused work instead of doing the singles model. Kind of like college radio singles bands that rise up that way to stardom."

vintageobscura,3852ce,weareonlynothing,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"Parson Sound was one of the earliest and most radical experimental rock bands of Sweden and the nucleus of a lineup that went on to become International Harvester, Harvester, and eventually, Trad Gras Och Stenar. With their expansive intake of styles as diverse as West Coast psychedelic music and the Velvet Underground's minimalism while still retaining a hint of their Swedish roots, Parson Sound created an unusual sound similar to early Krautrock, though predating its beginning by a year. The group began in Stockholm in the spring of 1967 shortly after a visit to Sweden by minimalist composer Terry Riley to perform his classic ""In C,"" as well as a new work with Swedish school children called ""Olson III."" Guitarist Bo Anders Persson, a student at the Royal Academy of Music who had already experimented with tape music, participated in the ""In C"" and was deeply inspired by Riley's open-minded aesthetic in contrast to the stifling atmosphere of the university. Persson started Parson Sound as a free improvisational group with cello player Arne Ericsson, also from the Academy; bassist Torbjörn Abelli, a music student at the University of Stockholm; and radio journalist and poet Thomas Tidholm, who met Persson while working on an article. Thomas Mera Gartz, previously the drummer for the psychedelic beat group Mecki Mark Men, soon joined the group and in the next year, others came and went in the loose collective, including Urban Yman, Bengt Berger, Bjorn Fredholm, and Kjell Westling. By summer 1967, Parson Sound was performing before audiences in cafés, clubs, and festivals and they also gigged a couple times on Swedish radio in September and December of that year. Parson's repetitive and hypnotic riffs were quite similar in sound to the Velvet Underground in its more improvised phase, so it was only fitting that in February 1968 they were part of an Andy Warhol exhibit at Stockholm's Museum of Modern Art. Eventually, the group coalesced around Persson, Abelli, Tidholm, Ericsson, and Yman and by summer 1968, they had changed their name to International Harvester to further refine their sound. This group would eventually become Trad Gras Och Stenar, while several of Parson's alum went on to another progressive experimental group, Arbete Och Fritid.   from http://www.allmusic.com/artist/parson-sound-mn0000863499/biography  I don't like allmusic.com that much but their biography of the band was decent"

vintageobscura,3624qs,Th3dynospectrum,19,Fri May 15 13:43:41 2015 UTC,"I have the good fortune of being an old fart who lived during a time when you could spend a rainy day driving from used record store to used record store finding really cool records for just a few bucks.  I also worked at several record stores and was constantly surrounded by other people who were just as hungry for new sounds and got off on turning other people on to music as much as I did.  The early '90s were a great time for this as a lot of people were ditching their records and replacing them with CDs.  I could spend $4 or $5 on a record that looked interesting and if it sucked, I'd just trade it in toward credit on something else.  I think the younger generation is very, very lucky to have access to all this incredible music available to them instantly.  But I have to say, there's just something about the hunt, the spending hours getting dusty fingers flipping through stacks of records that is just better than clicking links on youtube.  Record stores were special places and I am happy to see them make something of a comeback in the past few years.  It was pretty grim there for a while when it seemed like every single music store was going out of business.  That said, I am totally, utterly grateful for the fine folks who have these obscure, rare, bizarre records in their collection and post them for the world to hear.  While I miss the hunt, I'm quite happy exchanging that for the sheer quantity music and the money saved."

I found this well trying to find a list of artists that played at the Troubadour Folk Club in London because I was on a Martin Carthy (this is my favorite of his outside of that album if you're new to him as well) kick at the time and they were mentioned on this site.
vintageobscura,33mlm7,MLein97,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:18:41 2015 UTC,"Here's their wikipedia page and here's their slightly more popular track Bullets Don't Have Eyes (amazing horns on this one) which wasn't released until more recently (2002) when a compilation of singles and unreleased tracks was released.    The track Outcast was released in 1964 on Eastern records and was arranged by the guitarist Jimmy Oliver who played guitar in the Drifters 54-57, Jimmy Oliver And His Soul Twisters (1965), a solo track which appeared on this compilation which might peak some Obscuria hardcore fan ears, and some other arrangement work and was produced by Juggy Murray Jones (who's more famous for Sue Records). I haven't gone through all of either of these guys stuff yet, so no comment on if the less known tracks are worth telling about or if it's actually decent.  Now back to the track it was covered by the Animals in 1966 on Animalisms and I found this track by looking through a list of Lou Reed's favorite singles (do Recommend, even if you're not a Velvet Underground fan, not exactly all obscure, but a neat snapshot of the era) and he actually considered this song the 2nd greatest (pop styled) song of all time, which is neat. Hope you enjoy it."

vintageobscura,33h394,qkk,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"This is from my favorite mbira record, ""The African Mbira: Music of the Shona People of Rhodesia"". From the liner notes, written by Maraire:   Subject: Discipline   Title: ""Respect"" The words ""Ndini baba"" mean ""I am the father."" The mbira player says ""Hey, you people, that's not it."" The basic pattern is ""Listen to me, I am the father."" With a text of only one line or sentence (""Inwe handizvo, ndini baba""), the singers can exchange patterns, and the girl's voice is heard changing from basic sounds and taking the leading statement ""Imwe handizvo"" while the mbira player is subdued, singing wordless sounds. The mbira player takes the role of a father, telling the young that they should respect their elders."

I think mainly that is becasue it is still under 10K subscirbers. Make this 100K and I feel we would get ""obscure"" Pink Floyd b-sides and things like The Sonics and Link Ray.

vintageobscura,32wy51,pfannkuchen_ii,3,Thu Apr 23 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"I could post all sorts of Pink Floyd B-sides, but the former guidelines to this sub were focused on unheard artists, and not on obscure songs by famous artists.  Even super-obscure songs by Floyd like ""Crumbling Land"", though, have 40,000 views on them.  The thing is, ""obscure"" is a moving target.  It's a relative term.  What's ""obscure"" to me?  Something I haven't heard before.  Today I finally got around to listening to some Bob Welch Fleetwood Mac.  Now, the Bob Welch era is the most obscure era of Fleetwood Mac, but there's no way that this music is actually obscure.  There's also the self-selecting nature of this group.  To many, many people, the Residents are about the most obscure band they can imagine, and in absolute terms, there's something to be said for that.  However, I'd wager that most people hanging out here are pretty well aware of the Residents, are people who are looking to go beyond that.  And I really love that.  I love that you can come here and find the deepest of the deep, super crate digger stuff, unheard Patrick Cowley stuff, Miguel Salerno, whatever.  At the same time there's something about this philosophy which goes against the fundamental nature of reddit.  Which is that reddit's voting system is designed to reward the first person to say the obvious thing.  Popular posts get upvoted, unpopular posts don't, and something that's ""obscure"" is by definition unpopular.  The other thing that I sometimes feel conflicted about is the ""vintage"" part of it.  You know, like Varese said, ""The present day composers refuse to die"".  Something that's coming out today is simply going to be far more obscure than a record that came out in the '70s.  There are probably more people who know about Dion McGregor right now than know about, say, Megumi Wata.  I'm not really happy about that.  I think somebody who is doing wonderful, creative work now, it's hard for them to get heard, especially if they're weirdos, because you have to promote yourself and you have to compete with everybody else who's put out a record since approximately 1960.  I feel like the present needs our love as much as, if not more than, the past."

VO is based around an aesthetic of older less known music becasue the other subs mostly deal with present bands and specifically as a platform for lesser known musicians to promote their work. I feel the vintage part cuts out self promotion and leaves people who just want to share. This isn't to say self promotion is terrible rather in subs like that, the tone changes."

vintageobscura,32wy51,raoulduke25,9,Thu Apr 23 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"Obscurity changes depending on time and location. For instance, if I were to tell you about any regional musical scene, unless you're from there, it's going to be obscure. Along the same lines, even hits can be obscure if the artist failed to produce a legacy. This song was a number one (1) hit for a short while ages ago but unless you remember that time period or know the genre really well, this artist is pretty obscure."
vintageobscura,32wy51,Quickswitch79,3,Fri Apr 17 12:40:44 2015 UTC,"Very good point. Most people are going to listen to artists from their native country and a handful of others. I imagine that as the main demographic on reddit are North American and European, artists from the lesser known European countries and places such as Vietnam, Japan etc simply won't have ever been heard of before.   It take a good few years as you're growing up to listen to the all main artists from the main genres that most people are into, then listening to what your parents were into, then exploring the genres you're into the most and listening to the ones who never made it big, and then when you've finally done most of that then you start wondering what the rest of the world listens to.   That's why I love it here, I feel we're only at the tip of the iceberg in terms of songs/artists we've yet to discover :-)"
vintageobscura,32wy51,vizionheiry,6,Sat Apr 18 08:43:58 2015 UTC,I can't articulate or quantify it but I'm glad that most of the musicians in this subreddit are unknown to me.
vintageobscura,32wy51,Lilas_Poinconneur,4,Fri Apr 17 19:07:40 2015 UTC,"""Obscurity"" is mainly about the listener. To the average person, a band like Big Star is pretty obscure, although in the grand scheme of things, they're one of the starter ""Rock Music: Digging Deeper"" bands. I think pretty much everyone on this sub is a pretty hardcore music listener, so that's why I think that the current rules are a pretty great estimation of obscurity.  Under 30K Views on Youtube video and related videos by the same artist. Under 50K listeners on Last.fm.  Under 30K views on YouTube is really hard to do, simply because of how easily a video can spread after being posted somewhere like this for example. Or you can just navigate to the artist from a related video, without even actually searching for them."
vintageobscura,32wy51,MLein97,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:51:43 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of those things where we have to make a list we have to do it proactively before it's an issue and we link the list on the side.   I'd advise just a collecting of lists and linking the lists on the side as a recommendation.    For example with Psychedelic anything on this list is banned, this list (maybe not everything on this list), this list, or this list. Then you ban bsides (or all albums) based on greatest artists of all time (all genre) lists, but you add an exception if it's never been submitted to reddit before and it under X number of views because well certain artists are still more accessibly on the internet, some people have trouble finding stuff and we should still let people be exposed to the stuff because a lot of it is still really obscure.   Although my personal rule is that if it sounds like it smells like old vinyl and is below a certain number of views and never submitted to reddit before.    Edit: Totally forgot about what the submission screen says, keep with that, but make it more prominent."

Bailey was born in Belmont, a suburb of Port of Spain in Trinidad, but grew up in Les Coteaux, Tobago, with his grandparents. He began to sing at a very early age and he wanted to be a singer although his grandfather told him he must be a lawyer.  He won the Road March in 1974 and 2001 with ""Bassman"" and ""Stranger"" respectively. He won the Calypso Monarch in 2000 with ""What's Wrong With Me"" and ""Scratch Meh Back"". Shadow is also known for his unique dance in which he jumped to the tempo of his music in ""skip-rope style"" with both feet in the air at the same time. He won the Trinidad & Tobago Humming Bird Medal (Silver) in 2003.   He was the second to win both the International Soca Monarch and the Trinidad Road March competitions simultaneously, a feat he accomplished in 2001 with his song ""Stranger"".

It's about this rocket scientist, Quatermass - I think this is the third series featuring his character - who gets involved in the discovery of an alien spaceship buried under London which has been there apparently for millions of years. They find strange skulls, esoteric markings, strange happenings in the area after the discovery... Legitimately good show, though the ending is a bit wacky.

vintageobscura,2ylqax,oneofmywhitefriends,2,Tue Mar 10 21:13:17 2015 UTC,"This song was released in 1958 in Yugoslavia, both on a 78rpm record as well as on a 10 inch LP album. The album was called ""Duško Jakšić sings melodies by domestic authors"" - in 1958, many singers and musicians were still playing it safe by churning out cover versions of current international hits. Duško Jakšić, who is best known for singing ""city songs"" (a sort of traditional folky ballad) and chansons, I believe was the first to release an album featuring featuring music composed exclusively by Yugoslav composers.  Unfortunately, this is one of two good songs on the album - the rest of them are really dreadfully boring and sound like they were written in 1940, not 1958. This one stands out because it was written by Darko Kraljić, who wrote many Yugoslav evergreens which are still loved today and is widely regarded as one of the best pop songwriters of Yugoslavia.  The song is about a man who meets a woman with a strange and unusual name, ""Plavetna"" (a poetic way to say ""blue-colored""). He falls in love with her after pondering her name for a bit."

vintageobscura,2ygmzq,mindlesspleasures,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"Métal Urbain was one of the first French punk groups, formed in 1976 in Paris.  They were heavily influenced by The Clash and The Sex Pistols on one hand, and on the other by an electro approach related to Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed. They relied on heavily distorted guitars and replaced the traditional rock rhythm section of bass guitar/drums with a synthesizer and drum machine, a then-unique approach that foreshadowed the experimental possibilities that were explored by later post-hardcore bands such as Big Black. They were also known for their radical image (the color scheme of albums always being a stark black, white and red), and subversive lyrics sung in French.

This is a sub for submitting short, album length themed playlists of exactly 12 songs. Please check it out!"
vintageobscura,2x7wtl,Dont_Believe_Me_Ever,1 point,Thu Feb 26 10:02:26 2015 UTC,YES! More City Pop!

I just started a new subreddit called /r/12songs and I'd love to get some VO'ers to join and submit a playlist. This is a sub for submitting short, album length themed playlists of exactly 12 songs. I'd love if you folks checked it out, everyone here has great taste."

vintageobscura,2x1lsd,g_yore,3,Tue Feb 24 22:50:24 2015 UTC,I love this group - really interesting sound. Lead's voice is slightly similar to Hendrix's I reckon
vintageobscura,2x1lsd,OnlineAlbatross,2,Tue Feb 24 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally agree about that Hendrix similarity. You're on a tear with the song posts, got bit by the music bug today? Can't keep up with ya."
vintageobscura,2x1lsd,OnlineAlbatross,2,Tue Feb 24 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, I just let my Itunes shuffle to see what it could come up with. Quite a few postable songs it seems :)"
vintageobscura,2x1lsd,RKcerman,3,Tue Feb 24 23:50:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I love Black Merda! Their catalogue contains some fantastic songs, my favorites being Reality and Cynthy Ruth. Thanks for posting this, always a pleasure to listen to them."
vintageobscura,2x1phz,g_yore,2,Tue Feb 24 23:16:06 2015 UTC,"This guy is the best. Really underrated jazz musician. Evolution is a classic album, and his work with Jackie McLean is top notch."
vintageobscura,2x0aiq,bnr55,2,Tue Feb 24 17:19:02 2015 UTC,thank you for a fabulously funky start to my friday!!
