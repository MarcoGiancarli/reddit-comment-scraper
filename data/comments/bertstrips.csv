bertstrips,3e09y0,PimpCheese,10,Tue Jul 21 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"i didnt realize people really like those nickle&dimey mobile games this much. Is it that fun? or is CoC not that microtransaction heavy as many of its breatheren? i dont know well but i fear well. Hell even Blizz got in on there with Hearthstone but at least it doesnt ask for ""gems"" to continue playing more daily games."
bertstrips,3e09y0,BobSagetasaur,12,Tue Jul 21 11:02:39 2015 UTC,It's not micro transaction heavy. You can spend the gems you pay for on anything or nothing. You don't need to pay any money to enjoy it.
bertstrips,3e09y0,Thakrawr,5,Tue Jul 21 11:51:48 2015 UTC,"You can decide to buy gems and use these games for the following things:  -Straight up buy ressources -Double the production rate of ressources(2x, lasts 24hours) -instantly finish a building instead of waiting for it -train your army faster(4x, lasts 2hours) -create your spells faster(4x, lasts 2hours) -buy more builders(up to 4 additional ones, you start out with 1 I think?) Each builder can only build 1 building at a time. -buy a shield(meaning your village can't get raided for 12h, 24h, or 7d; each of those come with a cooldown time, 5d, 10d and 35d respectively).  This means you can either progress slower than people investing money or you need to grind more to keep up with them. It's not strictly ""pay2win"", in the sense that an enemy doesn't have a direct advantage during a raid/war. There's no special premium items that boost your attack strength or whatever, so if you get paired up with someone of your strength(thanks to usually mostly working balancing), the only difference is they might've invested less time into the game to get where you are. I think the way they solved it with the builders works fine if you just save up the gems you get from playing normally(getting achievements gets you gems, among other things)  Also, the grinding is actually fun IMO. Raids and wars are basically the purpose of the game anyway."
