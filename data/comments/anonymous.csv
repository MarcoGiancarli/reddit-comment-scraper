anonymous,3e53g3,NinjaNetizen,2,Wed Jul 22 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"trufax, it would be interesting - from an observer standpoint. theyd have to set up a c&c center though. and since the IPs of the cars are reportedly fixed itd be easy enough to trace traffic.  now a global network of satellites.. that'd be really interesting. ostensibly, theyd all have to be wired to the internet. so theyd all have access to global machines. instead of a bunch of cars reporting to one c&c you could have multiple swarms of botnets coordinating via satellite. and thats to say nothing of the injection/hijacking possibilities if you could reach everywhere on the planet.  of course, as always, pure speculation and hypotheticals :^)  but think if you were the first person to actually get control of a satellite? Assange(Mendax) was only rumored to be able to do that. its a famefags wet dream."

What's their sauce on that ""100"" number?  And how is it exactly 100? That's a little fishy. Given how well known SF is, I find it hard to believe they arrived at an exactly round number.

anonymous,3e4xeq,bopollo,2,Wed Jul 22 00:01:32 2015 UTC,"The video also says the RCMP should have handled the confrontation with McIntyre according to Treaty 8 protocols, a reference to the agreement signed in 1899 between the Crown and First Nations in much of northeastern B.C. as well as part of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories.   How would they even know he was a First Nations member when he was wearing a fucking mask? Jesus, some anons are dense.  And despite the absolutely retarded comment about jihadi networks, I agree.

anonymous,3e0mj2,bjt23,3,Tue Jul 21 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"i dont see anything wrong with the article so im going to post it here and go through it piece by piece, personally i think the journalists stick to what has been told to them and dont speculate at all   Some RCMP websites appeared to go offline on Sunday but it's unclear if the online activist group Anonymous had anything to do with it.   This seems ok with me, the actual report followed by a statement saying its unclear if it was Anonymous.   Yesterday Anonymous vowed to target the force after an RCMP-involved shooting in Dawson Creek, B.C. on Thursday left one man dead.   This is more reporting, it could be speculation but they actually link to @youranonnews and the tweet says what they say it says   The websites for both the B.C. and Dawson Creek RCMP, and the force's main site, were inaccessible for many people on Sunday.   This is more reporting, the sites WERE inaccesible     Today the group posted messages on some Twitter accounts noting the problems, but did not appear to claim responsibility.    There is another link to @covertanonymous which says simply a tweet saying the site is down just like it says in the article   A spokesperson with RCMP headquarters in Ottawa said any problems with the force's website were due to maintenance issues.   This is a quote from someone from RCMP headquarters, so this is just more reporting   The RCMP said it was not familiar with any threats made by Anonymous and that the group had nothing to do with the website being down.   yada yada reporting   However, Mounties in B.C. said they were aware of Anonymous's tweets and are reviewing them, as is B.C's Independent Investigations Office, which has taken over the Dawson Creek investigation.   quoting officials, so more reporting   On social media, users who claim to be part of the online group say the man killed in Dawson Creek was affiliated with Anonymous. Meanwhile the BC Coroners Service said the earliest it will release the victim's identity is tomorrow.   people on social media actually did say this... and the coroners actually did say that so still no speculation"

When (if) they drop the weapon, you are to remove the weapon from their reach. This can be done by a partner, or yourself. Usually by kicking it away from them as you keep your weapon still pointed at them in case they are armed with another.  Did he kick the weapon away? Was that kid unarmed?"

I hate all this computer shit and was actually a little relieved when the FBI finally took me down, thereby sparing me from the obligation to read another million words of e-Morlock jibber-jabber about Romas/COIN and Odyssey and persona management and whatever else the public is just going to end up ignoring until it’s too late anyway.

Useful idiots gonna get used, I guess.   SEE ALSO: Whistling in the Dark: Narcissism and the Grandiosity Gap.   [...] The narcissist often strikes people are ""laid back"" - or, less charitably: lazy, parasitic, spoiled, and self-indulgent. But, as usual with narcissists, appearances deceive. Narcissists are either compulsively driven over-achievers - or chronic under-achieving wastrels. Most of them fail to make full and productive use of their potential and capacities. Many avoid even the now standard path of an academic degree, a career, or family life.  The disparity between the often meagre accomplishments of the narcissist and his grandiose fantasies and inflated self-image - the Grandiosity Gap - is staggering and, in the long run, insupportable. It imposes onerous exigencies on the narcissist's grasp of reality and social skills. It pushes him either to seclusion or to a frenzy of ""acquisitions"" - cars, women, wealth, and power.  Yet, no matter how successful the narcissist is - many of them end up being abject failures - the Grandiosity Gap can never be bridged. The narcissist's fantastic False Self is so unrealistic and his Superego so sadistic that there is nothing the narcissist can do to extricate himself from the Kafkaesque trial that is his life. The Narcissist explains away the yawning abyss between his omnipotent and omniscient self-image and his drab, pedestrian life by attributing it to outside forces which conspire to keep him down – or by regarding it as an ineluctable, albeit unwelcome phase in his ultimate ascendance and self-realization.

anonymous,3diptw,Richard_Glass,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:19:32 2015 UTC,you've ruined the fun. I don't like you.
anonymous,3dkqs8,ShadowNexus,4,Fri Jul 17 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"This was...interesting:   Even if sites like Reddit continue to allow members to hide behind screen names, they should know, in the Reddit system, who they are: Full name, age, birthdate and maybe even address. If Reddit does this, it will not only cut down the number of attacks, it will likely scrub Reddit of much of its disgusting, hateful and racist content.   Seriously? I can't think of anything more conducive to trolling than a big fat pen of naive kids and ""solid citizens"" spouting their weak-ass bullshit opinions under their own names. ""Nice people"" posting in good faith are the only ones who'll end up victimized because trolls are main demographic technically competent enough to game the system. As if it's any big fucking deal for a malicious actor to forge documents in support of coughing up a ""full name, age, birthdate and maybe even address"". Better yet, steal someone's identity and let the games begin. Basically, it's nightmare waiting to happen.  Nobody's ever truly anonymous around here, anyway. If anybody serious really gave a fuck about monitoring or outing our IDs, we'd all learn the hard way soon enough. Don't kid yourself: at best, we're all being tolerated. Mostly though? Nobody cares.  Here's something I've found useful when thinking about creating a persona for posting pseudo-anonymously: In Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting, she developed a checklist of ""101 Questions for the Actor"" to foster the illusion of a consistent character. Even if you're posting as a variant of your ""real self"", you should always maintain the frame and never say anything outside the parameters of a salted profile (with a consistent writing style) that rules out the real you. Being able to write your real opinions in an instantly recognizable way without giving people the ability to pick you out of a line-up really takes some effort. lol    Character Development: ""101 Questions for the Actor""  One of your jobs as an actor is to flesh out and create a total life for your character. You must become completely comfortable inhabiting the language and actions of your character. To aid and assist you in this task complete the following questions as your character would. Your answers must be based on facts and clues given by the playwright (given circumstances). There are no right or wrong answers except for specific information given by the playwright. Questions not answered with information provided by the playwright can be based on your own intuition, creativity and imagination. On a separate sheet of paper answer the questions as completely and in as much detail as possible. [...]   Full list of questions here. Seriously, it's worth doing.     Damn, I never knew this had lyrics...TIL. Kathy Kirby: Spanish Flea. lol"
anonymous,3dkqs8,acusticthoughts,0,Fri Jul 17 04:12:47 2015 UTC,Are you suggesting that since some people will break the rules we should have no rules?
anonymous,3dkqs8,acusticthoughts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:41:49 2015 UTC,"No, I'm suggesting that requiring real names would only hurt honest people acting in good faith because it lowers the bar for random fucking scumbags to ruin people's lives. Malicious people aren't going to give one single fuck about this unenforceable rule and the ""chat environment"" will be even worse than before.   But hey, it's not like the bar is all that high already. I can tell you right now the people who are going to bear the brunt of a ""full visibility forever"" policy are children. For example, as a 36-year-old man, it's likely you made it through your entire youth without getting doxxed, SWATted, preyed on by pedos, mocked on Youtube, or otherwise bullied, harassed and/or stalked by mean-spirited strangers online. It's also likely you did things as a teenager that make the adult you cringe: ridiculous political views, awkward social skills, bad haircuts, being a fan of dumb music, scraggly 'stache, going through a ""rebellious phase"", fanboying about Arnold's quads, whatever-- that would have gotten you a significant amount of negative attention from online psychopaths looking for victims.   Now aren't you glad you were able to avoid all that drama, and the three employers interviewing you this week in MA for a job in the solar power industry have nothing to judge you by besides your professional Facebook page, eight years of Reddit posting history, and your LinkedIn profile?   If you were in any way a normal kid, odds are you should be.  TL;DR: Honest people have their entire identity at risk; bad actors risk nothing because they're 100% guaranteed to hack, fake, or otherwise con their way into the system. Seriously, it's troll paradise."
anonymous,3dkqs8,acusticthoughts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"It's already that way. As you showed, you can easily piece the life together of someone that is open like myself. All of my profiles connect pretty quickly - but the truth is that I still benefit greatly even with that risk. I've made a conscious choice to connect myself because I'm hoping that my simple, calm - but smart self will add up to something powerful. Let the troll attack - since my online presence is so long, broad and old it is better defensible.  I could be hacked in thirty seconds I'm sure. Being a 6'0""/210 male makes me less worried about physical risk...not entirely fair. There are many reasons for anonymity, so many. Maybe Reddit isn't it anymore..."
anonymous,3dkqs8,acusticthoughts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"It's already that way.   Not quite: each of us chooses how open we want to be. Mandating that kids and vulnerable people of whatever variety--women, people with autism, the mentally ill, unpopular opinion holders, etc--give their home address to a wide-open site like this would be disastrous. We should be teaching people to be less revealing online and MORE wary around strangers, not forcing them into a position of complete insecurity.   Being a 6'0""/210 male makes me less worried about physical risk...not entirely fair.    Oh man...go read about what happens in SWATting. If you tried to fight back--or even explain yourself--when some sick fuck throws a team of officers with guns pointed at you, your size and physique might be a lethal liability. Nobody deserves to be victimized by that kind of abuse of power.   Let the troll attack - since my online presence is so long, broad and old it is better defensible.   Firstly, you'd never, ever say that if you had any idea what people can do--you could literally lose everything you have overnight. Secondly, have some fucking empathy and think of the vulnerable.  If you want an example of what the Internet does to people who have mental issues, lack boundaries and don't know when to quit, go look up Chris-Chan, Kathy Sierra and Zoe Quinn. It's easy to feel contempt and dismiss the significance of what happened with ""oh, that could never happen to me"". But what if you had a mentally-disabled son? A histrionic, depressed daughter? A bipolar wife? Odds are you'd be grateful their name, address and/or SSN wasn't on file around this hellhole--and you'd pull their blogs, channels, and all the rest of their obnoxious bullshit offline as fast as you humanly could. They didn't have that filter, and paid the price.  Also if you'll notice, being anonymous doesn't make you incapable of having a real conversation. I don't keep a Reddit account at all and am behind multiple layers of obfuscation--technical and otherwise--but the posts I make here aren't anything I'd be too terribly ashamed of if you forwarded them to my family or colleagues. There's a lot to be said for the idea that ""the true test of a man's character is what he does when no one is watching"". Bottom line: there's literally nothing I do online or off that's so bad it could be used to blackmail me. My venting here hurts no one--and if I offend you, nobody's making you read it.  IMO, the answer probably lies in creating small, heavily-moderated communities tailored to specific interests on the one hand, and unfiltered anonymous free-for-all darknet fourms on the other. Reddit is too big for the former and too commercial for the latter. Who knows? In any event, I should probably fuck off and spend my time on something productive like learning Mandarin.  Anyway, you seem like a nice enough guy...good luck with the solar stuff and don't skip leg day. lol"

anonymous,3dkqs8,AddictedReddit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"You have a much higher chance of dying in a car wreck than being doxxed    Oh really? Depends on how you define it. The OPM hack--that is, the OPM hack everybody's talking about--was pretty fucking bad:   ""On June 23, FBI Director James Comey estimated that the personal information of 18 million people had been stolen. As of this writing, more than 21.5 million people have been affected. That includes a few million people who didn’t apply for clearances but who were listed in clearance paperwork. Spouses, family, friends, children. And not just social security numbers, birthdates, fingerprints, and SF-86 forms, but interview notes, too.""   Yep. The AFF dump at Hell outed four million people, many of whom registered for a sex site with their work e-mail. See also: the wonderful world of carding markets, revenge porn and Minecraft trolling. 4chan, 8chan, darknet shit...all kinds of boards that specialize in nothing BUT fucking people over for fun. Not to mention the more adult pastimes of financial blackmail and information brokering in the service of election rigging and industrial espionage.  Sure, life on the internet is a balance. But with all the shit I've seen? Posting under a real ID (or IP) anywhere just isn't worth it. Rule of thumb: the more I know about you and the less you're able to know about me, the better."

All ranting aside, I honestly believe that the pervasive sense of arrogance and entitlement in the so-called ""hacking/activist community"" is not only unwarranted, but a detriment to learning to the point of being a handicap.   With billions of dollars going into advanced classified cryptographic/technological research all over the world, anyone who's self-taught--no matter how much time they spend on it--barely knows jack shit about anything. Seriously, we all know jack shit. If people got a knack for learning how to STFU and listen, they wouldn't be such an embarrassment. All these motherfucking technicians who strut around like they're engineers...smh.   And even if you're capable of finding your own exploits and coding your own fuzzer, so the fuck what? Compared to the senior analysts at NSA and elsewhere, you're nothing but an entry-level student. Beyond that, what do any of us really know about geopolitics and history? What gives us the right to be secure in our belief systems when hardly anyone even bothers to crack a book any more, choosing instead to regurgitate someone else's talking points foisted off on them through pre-digested mass media propaganda? Easy answers are for fools and suckers. It's no way to live.  TL;DR: We'd all be better off learning how to STFU, get some fucking humility and give respect where it's due.   FWIW it's not like I'm claiming to be any better. As Adorno said, the splinter in your own eye is the best magnifying glass. Sorry if it came across like I was being a cunt to you in particular; I didn't intend it that way."
anonymous,3ctvyl,NinjaNetizen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:44:47 2015 UTC,"A question: since even the smartest people are always learning more, at what point should someone decide that they know enough to teach others, whether by giving a talk or writing a book or whatever? Obviously it can't be ""when they know everything,"" because that never happens. And some topics (especially in tech) are timely, so if you wait too long, the whole topic is obsolete.   Sometimes your posts sound like you think people should learn everything they can, but not spend any time teaching, which I think sounds selfish. People teach/talk/write for reasons other than famefagging, don't you think?"
anonymous,3ctvyl,Richard_Glass,2,Sun Jul 12 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"Sometimes your posts sound like you think people should learn everything they can, but not spend any time teaching, which I think sounds selfish.   Eh, I don't know. It's tricky: as a student I always feel like if you can pick up a subject yourself, it's disrespectful to waste anybody's time by asking them to step you through the basics. But on the other hand, if you can hold your own in an advanced discussion, you owe it to yourself to find a mentor who has a perspective worth hearing--i.e. things you can't get out of a book or a Youtube lecture. So as a would-be instructor, you have to ask yourself ""if I don't want to baby-step lazy noobs, what do I bring to the table for anyone else""? God knows I'm grateful for people who've taken the time to mentor me and humor my conversations--or at least allow me in the room while they're holding forth. lol   People teach/talk/write for reasons other than famefagging, don't you think?   Yeah, not necessarily good ones. Namely, control.   If  ""to inform is to influence"", infecting the world with your ideas is its own reward. To put it bluntly, where does education end and indoctrination begin? Nobody at NSA is giving out free graduate tuition for the pure love of learning. Admiral Rogers spelled it out in a speech to students last February: ""I hope that you all realize that you are here as an investment. Quite frankly, we are expecting a return."" Yeaahh.  So basically this with advanced degrees instead of lollipops and treacle tarts. lol  But it doesn't end there: there's a whole school of thought about ""self synchronization"", i.e. getting members of your network to brainwash themselves by having everyone stay current by reading the same stuff. It's part of ""information dominance"" theory--as demonstrated by the Information Dominance Corps' creepy self-synchronization portal here. It's a vestigial form of distributed intelligence, really. And it was quite an eye-opener to realize that the whole idea of noopolitik is a return to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher kings. If you look at the impact the Highlands Group has had on fostering the tech sector, noocracy doesn't sound so far-fetched after all. And never forget the Internet itself came out of RAND in 1962--and here's a clip of Herman Kahn and Tony Wiener shooting the shit about using big data for social control in 1968. Incredible stuff.   Anyway, here's an awesome reference on the subject:   INFLUENCE: THEORY AND PRACTICE   ""During the Korean War, Chinese captors of U.S. prisoners employed an unexpected and relatively successful compliance program. The Chinese, somewhat afraid of post-conflict  repercussions for coercive torture, pursued techniques of “social influence” to secure behavioral compliance as well as lasting indoctrination. Although they failed in their primary objective to permanently alter beliefs and attitudes, their process illuminated the success in influencing individual behavior by interpreting and controlling aspects of group social dynamics.   To cope with the daily flood of life’s information, humans have developed cognitive processes to quickly filter decision-making requests according to probable importance. If determined routine, the person allows learned decision-making shortcuts to guide his response. A range of psycho-social principles of human behavior underlie this “automaticity” and they can be deliberately triggered, or suppressed, to increase the likelihood of generating predictable behavioral responses in an individual.    This thesis includes a broad survey of the major theoretical and practical foundations of psychology, propaganda, and marketing. It identifies the psycho-social principles that most influence a person’s likelihood of complying with behavioral “requests” and examines a broad selection of social influence efforts for their presence. Finally, this thesis concludes by assessing the ability of influence principles to secure enduring effects.""   See? The ultimate irony is I'm so self-saturated with this shit the merest prompt has me spewing PDF links all over the place without having to think twice about it. Oh well. ""STFU and keep reading"" indeed. lol"

How hard would it be to change all the passwords to something idiotic and plant porn links on Pozzi's desktop? Phony receipts and invoices are trivial to fake. Is this really everything, or was it curated and cherry-picked for audience consumption? Has anyone bothered to do any verification? All I'm saying is it's important to remember this was an anonymous document dump, not a forensic disk image admissable as evidence in a court of law.  Another question: how many people were given the full dump before it went public, who were they, and why? IIRC, about 20-30 minutes after it leaked, around a hundred people were sitting around with their collective thumb up their ass complaining they couldn't open the torrent because it was corrupted while Christopher Soghoian, Jacob Appelbaum, Wikileaks/EFF et. al. were already on to the fine print. Not that it's a huge deal, it's just kind of annoying that someone was playing the ""let's privilege the gatekeepers"" game.  Finally, who is Phineas Fisher and why is he famefagging so much? What's the point of giving LE so many writing samples and drafting up a ""how to"" manual when every word out of your keyboard can--and will--be used to find and fuck you?

This paper explores strategies for making those infrastructures more resilient in the face of such attacks (or natural disasters). The authors focus on three key infrastructures: provision of electric power, telecommunications (both voice and data), and information systems, with greater attention on power and telecoms. They explore the idea that ''neighbourhoods must fend for themselves'' with a deliberate policy of diversification and decentralisation of power and telecommunications, based on the principles: 1) locate backup power in individual buildings, or at telecom Central Offices (COs) or Points of Presence (POPs), 2) provide a secondary, heterogeneous source of telecommunications access for the ''neighbourhood'', and 3) provide redundant and resilient implementation of information services provided to or accessed by the neighbourhood. Subsequent analysis suggests that attention be focused on redundant provision of the ''last mile'' interconnection of individual organisations with backbone networks supplying power and telecommunications.""

Odds are anyone skilled enough to cause the ""technical difficulty""  known as Stuxnet could have easily found multiple ways to make the stock market choke.   As if anyone that technically competent would give YAN a heads up the night before so they could tweet hints about it! On second thought, maybe that's exactly what a highly-skilled state actor trying to push a narrative and frame schmucks might do. Stranger things have happened, lol.  TL;DR: Occam's Razor says YAN didn't know shit and the media is just scaring up a bogeyman.  Bonus track: Doris Day: High Hopes. lol"

The current Islam crisis was sparkpluged by Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran in 79. The Third Reich was SP'd by guess who and the Soviet Union was SP'd by Lenin. The 60s civil rights movement was SP'd by MLK.  After a while the revolution gets critical mass and can live without the Spark-plug BUT...  If you can kill the spark-plug BEFORE that - the revolution can be destroyed! Sometimes it just peters out... MLK and JFK were killed too late, in fact it was a great career move because they are both now secular saints.  I sincerely believe - AND I CANNOT PROVE THIS AT ALL - that the powers that be have developed a system to identify SPs and kill them before they can make trouble.

Dr Turbiville approaches the topic, using only open and unclassified sources, from an historical perspective discussing numerous cases where government forces have targeted leadership. His paper culminates in a more lengthy review of Mexico’s targeting insurgent leadership in the Guerrero Province in the late 1960s and Russia’s more recent campaigns in Chechnya.  [...]  Ultimately,  targeting  leadership  must  take  into  account  the enemy organization and its motivations. If an organization is “driven” by a charismatic leadership, as in the case of Guzman and the Sendero Luminoso, then effectively targeting the leadership can be decisive. In other cases where ideology for a “cause” is more important than leadership, removing leaders will have less strategic impact. In this latter case, targeting may be effective tactically or operationally, but to be truly effective in a strategic sense, the operations must be linked to comprehensive agreement or conflict resolution.""

It's one of the most controversial stories about early hackers, given that his primary tool was Social Engineering - he got people to give up their passwords/give him access. There was a rather Hollywoodized movie about it as well (Takedown/Track Down) that has been branded factually inaccurate.  The book The Art of Deception was written by Mitnick as well as Steve Wozniak (of Apple fame). There is also a documentary about the story that was distributed by 2600 Magazine called Freedom Downtime.  It's a really fascinating tale, I'd even venture to call it one of the epics of hacker culture."

anonymous,3bhyum,NinjaNetizen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:49:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. But on the other hand, motives make a difference: are you hacking to prove your mastery over computers and systems, or are you hacking to gain tailored access to information? Are you randomly selecting targets of opportunity, or are you targeting specific people and resources? If the latter, it doesn't matter how you get there. There's no shame in using existing methods if you aren't hung up about the stigma of being more technician/artisan than engineer.   Besides, why commit CFAA felonies when you could just convince someone to hand you what you want voluntarily? Why intercept comms when you could be welcomed into the network with open arms and handed resources 24/7? Why steal classified info when you could just ride the Pentagon City Metro at rush hour and keep your fucking ears open? Rhetorical. Being capable of combining technical means with sound analytic techniques and human intelligence is ideal, but without good HUMINT you're absolutely crippled.   Professional SE is in a league unto itself, and it's rare you'll find anyone willing to talk about it. Many Fortune 500 companies rely on firms specializing in global human intelligence (HUMINT) field collection. It's a neat loophole for 100% legal industrial espionage-- the dirty little secret is if someone hands you data voluntarily, the liability is on them, not you. TBH anyone trained at that level isn't going to find Mitnick particularly impressive. Anyone making that many sloppy Mickey Mouse fuck-ups is inconceivable, and you can't always rely on targets being that soft.

I was basically with you up until the end. I don't think there's anyone ""pulling the strings"" -- if there were, the government would be a lot more organized than it is. ""The government"" isn't one huge, homogenous thing. It's a gazillion different agencies acting with varying degrees of (in)competence, having turf wars and disputes with each other. It's a huge, expensive mess.  So when the government abuses its power, I think you have to start by figuring out which agency/agencies are in charge of that specific thing, and whether there are other agencies that are supposed to rein them in, but maybe aren't doing their job. Then go from there. You'll never get anywhere just blaming everything on ""the government,"" let alone some shadowy mystery person controlling everything."

Another interesting read:   Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA   ""Wedge - The Secret War Between the FBI and CIA, a nonfiction book by American historian and policy analyst Mark Riebling, explores the conflict between U.S. domestic law enforcement and foreign intelligence. The book presents FBI-CIA rivalry through the prism of national traumas—including the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, and 9/11—and argues that the agencies' failure to cooperate has seriously endangered U.S. national security.""   That said, national security policy as we know it today wasn't created in a vacuum. The establishment of USCYBERCOM as a sub-unified command in 2008 and the declaration of information operations/cyberspace as the fifth domain of warfare required a radical, massive wielding of influence. And yes, you can put faces behind it: there's absolutely no way to minimize the impact of Andrew Marshall's Highlands Group and all their affiliated colleagues from RAND on the military cyber industrial complex as it exists today.

I read these memos a long time ago when they were more easily avaliable, and their contents are appalling. Unfortunately, while the memos have been successfully leaked and exposed in the documentary, ""Capitalism, a Love Story,"" the banking aristocracy is bent on concealing them once more in order to let us forget about them."
anonymous,3b52z1,NinjaNetizen,4,Fri Jun 26 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"first I want you to step back and think about the fact that you are referencing a blog as a reputable source. Then ask yourself, if this person has such compelling evidence and research methods, why aren't they being published by mainstream media outlets?  Secondly the USA is not widely considered a plutocracy, but rather an oligarchy; in the form of dynastic presidencies. The reference to plutocracy most likely comes from the fact that you can literally buy laws (known by a softer term - lobbying).  Furthermore that blog is reaching: it condemns people for wanting to obtain more money. True it's greedy, but nobody complains about Bill Gates do they? That's extremely hypocritical. Apple hasn't donated a single cent to charity, yet control a market share with an arguably insecure technological infrastructure - that those same citigroup people probably use.  They're unfairly singling out their pet hated group from the herd, just to condemn bankers. I'll take a stab and guess you think we should abolish the federal reserve as well?"

I simply looked that blog up, and I suggest that everyone takes it with a grain of salt. I should have said something about that. Although I will say that such memos are in existence, and that they brag about the aristocracy's keen ability to influence government and politics. I would suggest that people take an interest in the memos and try to come to a conclusion on their own after doing some research on them. I've read them myself a long time ago, and I will continue searching for the actual pdf files just incase Citigroup missed a spot.  I'd also like to say that fiat currency does little to help the economy, but it can be sustained for a while so long as subprime lending is kept to a bare minimum, but unfortunately too many people were given subprime loans before 2008, which caused the economic crisis of 2008.

You're literally blaming these people for making money and having the sense to use it wisely (in the effect of making more money - for the record I believe lobbying should be outlawed and financial crime should be zealously prosecuted). Yet those who are irresponsible with their income are given a pass. And don't start about living wage. If there is better pay/housing prices somewhere else: MOVE.

The fact of the matter is that society's weakest were preyed upon by clever loan sharks who knew that the poor could never pay back their excessive loans. And it's disapointing that you refuse to break out of the idea that I'm generalizing the rich as whole, since the idea that the occupy movement is blaming people for making money is so vehemently repeated in the mainstream media.

I'm saying that people were advised by trusted financial institutions to take out risk-laden loans and buy homes in an effort to invest, when in reality foreclosures made prices so horrible that people ended up sitting in worthless homes while paying massive debts.

Here's a free PDF copy of a book which should help your critical thinking:   Age of Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion  Americans create 57% of the world's advertising while representing only 6% of its population; half of our waking hours are spent immersed in the mass media. Persuasion has always been integral to the democratic process, but increasingly, thoughtful discussion is being replaced with simplistic soundbites and manipulative messages. Drawing on the history of propaganda as well as on contemporary research in social psychology, Age of Propaganda shows how the tactics used by political campaigners, sales agents, advertisers, televangelists, demagogues, and others often take advantage of our emotions by appealing to our deepest fears and most irrational hopes, creating a distorted vision of the world we live in. This revised and updated edition includes coverage of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, recent election campaigns, talk radio, teen suicide, U.F.O. abductions, the Columbine shootings, and novel propaganda tactics based on hypocrisy and false allegations.   Worth a look, IMO."

TOR connection to a VPN --> OK  VPN connection to TOR --> GOTO JAIL  Source: The grugq--""OPSEC for hackers""  Using TOR on your real-ID laptop is a huge mistake too. Create better compartments by using TAILS/Tor on dedicated-use throwaway laptops with no hard drive from networks unconnected to your real ID.

[...] the Internet activism and protests that played out in the events leading up to and during the Jasmine Revolution demonstrate that although the Internet activists were just as vulnerable to being subjugated by the more politically shrewd, the “False Promise” myth may be just that, a myth. Activists may avoid falling victim to the “False Promise” if they understand the role of information warfare and the supporting technologies to further their objectives.   God damn it. ""Subjugated by the politically shrewd"" indeed. I've always said if you don't make the effort at getting a sense of the broader historical context of what's really going on, you're fucked.  And isn't this cute, they talk about how operators can strategize how best to ""turn you off"":   As discussed earlier, cyber provides a high level of control that enables operators to turn off the effects of operations, thus returning disrupted services to normal operations. However, it may prove to be far more difficult to turn off the cyber militia that carried out the attacks. This is highlighted by the events surrounding the Arab Spring when at the conclusion of Ben Ali’s reign in Tunisia, Anonymous continued to assist in revolutions throughout the Middle East and elsewhere. Further analysis may be warranted to determine the optimal model to organize, build, employ and transition for UCW operations.   Mindblowing. So yeah. Put two and two together about Sabu, Brown, Hammond, and the rest of it. And the more they codify this ""cyber militia operational planning"" into an art and science? The worse it's going to be for you unless you open your eyes. I'm not saying you shouldn't be proud of your role in helping Tunisia--but as this whitepaper makes abundantly clear, you shouldn't have any illusions about who was really running the show.  TL;DR: Don't be a patsy. Fix your OPSEC and don't let anyone use your idealism against you.

TL;DR: If you all don't get your shit together and get religion about security, Anonymous will just keep getting used, co-opted, jerked around, betrayed by sell-outs, rounded up and jailed every time the USG needs to trot out a convenient media bogeyman.   Once again, Dulles said it best:   There are many virtues to be striven after in the job. The greatest of them all is security. All else must be subordinated to that.  Security consists not only in avoiding big risks. It consists in carrying out daily tasks with painstaking remembrance of the tiny things that security demands. The little things are in many ways more important than the big ones. It is they which oftenest give the game away. It is consistent care in them, which form the habit and characteristic of security mindedness.   In any case, the man or woman who does not indulge in the daily security routine, boring and useless though it may sometimes appear, will be found lacking in the proper instinctive reaction when dealing with the bigger stuff.  No matter how brilliantly given an individual, no matter how great his goodwill, if he is lacking in security, he will eventually prove more of a liability than an asset.   Oh well. Even if you don't consider those passages ""words to live by"", I hope they at least give you something to think about.  Bonus track: Lord Kitchener - Take De Phone Out Me House. lol"

Instead of going with my gut reaction and saying ""kill yourself, you gullible dumbfuck"", I decided to contribute something useful which ought to help you with your critical thinking:   Age of Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion   Americans create 57% of the world's advertising while representing only 6% of its population; half of our waking hours are spent immersed in the mass media. Persuasion has always been integral to the democratic process, but increasingly, thoughtful discussion is being replaced with simplistic soundbites and manipulative messages. Drawing on the history of propaganda as well as on contemporary research in social psychology, Age of Propaganda shows how the tactics used by political campaigners, sales agents, advertisers, televangelists, demagogues, and others often take advantage of our emotions by appealing to our deepest fears and most irrational hopes, creating a distorted vision of the world we live in. This revised and updated edition includes coverage of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, recent election campaigns, talk radio, teen suicide, U.F.O. abductions, the Columbine shootings, and novel propaganda tactics based on hypocrisy and false allegations.   More from Pratkanis and Cialdini here. Educate yourselves or fuck off."

And it doesn't seem to have much to do with what they accomplished for Anonymous, or their financial situation, or anything else beyond how good their supporters are at social media. And sometimes even that doesn't explain it.   So someone like w0rmer, who definitely made mistakes but seems like a decent person, got nowhere near the support he deserved, while everyone fawns over Matt DeHart despite his story sounding very fishy, and there's this extreme hatred for Sabu which IMO is disproportional to his actual role.

A video obtained by the Guardian reveals how an ""extreme-scale analytics"" system created by Raytheon, the world's fifth largest defence contractor, can gather vast amounts of information about people from websites including Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare.   Raytheon says it has not sold the software – named Riot, or Rapid Information Overlay Technology – to any clients. But the Massachusetts-based company has acknowledged the technology was shared with US government and industry as part of a joint research and development effort, in 2010, to help build a national security system capable of analysing ""trillions of entities"" from cyberspace.

But they’ve learned no such lesson. That tactic continues to be the staple of how major US and British media outlets “report,” especially in the national security area.    Why doesn't anyone realize that's exactly what he's doing with ""Unofficial Sources"" by taking anonymous submissions from, quote, ""mid level bureaucrats trying to tell the truth"" and any other malicious actor who knows how to manipulate the hole-riddled amateur-hour shitshow known as SecureDrop?

Are you acting to do the right thing, or are you acting to advance yourself and show off what a great person you are? Fuck the latter and everything about it.   A lot of these dumb motherfuckers need to learn the fine art of dropping a dime and taking care of business while staying invisible. You can get a lot more done if you shut the fuck up and don't tell anyone than if you're blabbing around about it to fix your self-esteem. So yeah, caring about reputation, credibility, and ""standing in the community"" is a sucker's game. Let your own opinion of your actions be enough.   IMO, the first hurdle is to root out the bullshit and hypocrisy within yourself. Greek and Roman philosophy delivers. Once you're straight with yourself and live as honestly and honorably as you can, it doesn't matter what the world throws at you. Epictetus said it best:   There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.  Now, the things within our power are by nature free, unrestricted, unhindered; but those beyond our power are weak, dependent, restricted, alien. Remember, then, that if you attribute freedom to things by nature dependent, and take what belongs to others for you own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you take for your own only that which is your own, and view what belongs to others just as it really is, then no one will ever compel you, no one will restrict you, you will find fault with no one, you will accuse no one, you will do nothing against your will; no one will hurt you, you will not have an enemy, nor will you suffer any harm.  Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself any inclination, however slight, towards the attainment of the others; but that you must entirely quit some of them, and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would have these, and possess power and wealth likewise, you may miss the latter in seeking the former; and you will certainly fail of that by which alone happiness and freedom are procured.  Seek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing semblance, ""You are but a semblance and by no means the real thing."" And then examine it by those rules which you have; and first and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power, or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.

Most people don't have time to listen to every random nut that starts blabbing at them. If you haven't already distinguished yourself from the hordes of random nuts, why would anyone pay attention the next time you have something interesting to say?  Or to put it another way, since you link to so many PDF's -- there are many reasons why those papers list the authors, instead of all being credited to ""anonymous."" It's not only for the authors' egos, but so that readers can understand each paper in the context of a body of work.   I would also argue that people who are really good at what they do (in any field) wind up getting recognition whether they want it or not. And that can be a real mindfuck if you weren't expecting it and don't know how to handle it. (See: rockstar suicides.) So I think this ""staying invisible"" ideal is not attainable, or even necessarily a good idea."

That said, it's likely the media blitz is politically driven, as is the ""OMG China!!"" OPM leak. I'm sorry, but I thought it was common knowledge Israel compromised 100% of the USG's personnel records over ten years ago? Did everyone just sweep that fun little tidbit down the old memory hole, or what?   Another flaw in their reasoning: if OPM were compromised by a nation state, how the FUCK is their database getting leaked on the darknet by the same script kiddy forum that mirrored the AdultFriendFinder database? If a government actor were planning to blackmail employees with it, it's unlikely they'd turn it out into the wild as part of some sort of asymmetric thing, isn't it? Are they hoping the skidz will do all their dirty work for them for free?  To be fair, the first thing I thought when I heard there was a humongous personnel breach was that [redacted US agency] did it. What if someone from * cough * angling for more funding set up an embarrassingly obvious scenario precisely where they knew the contractor would find it?  At this stage in the game, nothing would surprise me.   In my opinion, both of these so-called ""scoops"" seem manufactured to get the natsec establishment dullards whipped up into a self-righteous frenzy over nothing--and as usual, everyone's crapping their pants right on cue; mission accomplished. And you have to love the irony of John Schindler's wailing and moaning about potential blackmail when he's the kind of pathetic dumbass who can't even manage to keep from getting fired from the Naval War College for distributing pics of his sad old hot dog to groupies on Twitter.

anonymous,39j19r,Richard_Glass,9,Fri Jun 12 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"Reddit has turned to shit. Reddit may have had very good or legitimate reasons as to why they banned those subreddits, but they failed majorly on one of their primary goals of ""transparency.""  And since they did not explain their actions adequately, of course people are going to assume the worst. It also hurts their position significantly that they have not defined what constitutes harassment. They are kind of playing a ""I'll know it when I see it"" thing which we all know kind of fails big time because that tends to boil down to if they like the group or not.  One other point of interest is I have read a few instances where the admin of an unpopular nonPC subreddit gets banned. This leaves only the mods.  It will continue over time, but without an admin some mods will drop out and there will be no knew ones to take their place.  So what eventually happens is there is maybe one mod left. That single mod can't police the subreddit 24x7 for reddit rules. He or she simply can't keep up. So the users will start breaking the rules, and now the admins have a perfect excuse to ban the subreddit they hate.  All they have to do is ignore requests for replacement admins.  Also /r/FPH missed out significantly on an excellent trolling opportunity.  All of their pics were getting deleted from imgur because some SJW was reporting them all. Imgur following their own rules just started to delete them all. /r/FPH blamed the imgur staff as opposed to recognizing what was really the root cause (rules+a reporter).  What they could have done would be to search imgur for pics of fat people, post on their subreddit, watch them get deleted and break out the popcorn as imgur's user base starts to get pissed at imgur for deleting their photos for no good solid apparent reason what so ever as far as they can see."

You want free speech, go to the darknet forums and talk about whatever you want.    Reddit has turned to shit   It always was. FACT: outside of /r/askhistorians, /r/credibledefense, /r/chess, /r/remath and a sprinkling of thoughtful people holding down the fort while swimming in shit everywhere else, Reddit is a remedial garbage dump for cretins (and the marketers who love them).   Fuck, I should be learning Mandarin.  Relevant: THE CULTURE INDUSTRY   The term culture industry (German: Kulturindustrie) was coined by the critical theorists Theodor Adorno (1903–1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895–1973), and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter ""The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception"", of the book Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944), wherein they proposed that popular culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods — films, radio programmes, magazines, etc. — that are used to manipulate mass society into passivity. Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the mass communications media, renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their economic circumstances. The inherent danger of the culture industry is the cultivation of false psychological needs that can only be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism; thus Adorno and Horkheimer especially perceived mass-produced culture as dangerous to the more technically and intellectually difficult high arts.   TL;DR: Eat a dick."

""Offensive CI operations  – CI folks call OFCO – are clandestine CI activities run in support of DoD military national security objectives and programs against individuals known or suspected to be foreign intelligence officers with connections to foreign intelligence or international terrorist activities. And they’re run to counter the foreign intelligence operations, espionage, against DoD national activities and, of course, terrorist operations against DoD or national.  These are very tightly controlled departmental activities run by a small group of specially selected people within DoD. There are only four organizations in the department that can run these operations – Army Counterintelligence, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and now DIA with the center [Defense CI & HUMINT Center].""   -- Toby Sullivan, Director of Counterintelligence for USD/I, 5 Aug 2008;  see Federal News Service transcript here. For detailed information concerning DoD OFCO see DoDI S-5240.09, OFCO (U),  29 Oct 2008.   Dictionary definition:   Offensive Counterintelligence Operation (OFCO).  A clandestine CI activity conducted for military, strategic, DoD, or national CI and security purposes against a target having suspected or known affiliation with FISS [Foreign Intelligence & Security Service], international terrorism, or other foreign persons or organizations, to counter terrorism, espionage, or other clandestine intelligence activities that threaten the security of the Department or the United States.

The idea of a decentralized, politically-motivated ""Anonymous"" network was fleshed out in the form of a Wired Magazine short story in 1998 by the same intelligence community analyst and information operations kingpin who literally invented the word ""cyberwar"" in 1993.   Face it: the government co-opted your shit. They needed a way to circumvent the attribution problem, and Anonymous just happened to get twisted into fitting the bill. For example, this whitepaper mentions OpTunisia by name:   Anonymous as a potential USG surrogate in clandestine/covert operations: ""Unconventional Cyber Warfare: Cyber Opportunities in Unconventional Warfare."" CASE 3: ANONYMOUS– NON-STATE ACTORS AS CYBER MILITIAS  Another seminal work from 1997, ""In Athena's Camp"", spells it out in plain English:   IN ATHENA'S CAMP: PREPARING FOR CONFLICT IN THE INFORMATION AGE   The information revolution — which is as much an organizational as a technological revolution — is transforming the nature of conflict across the spectrum: from open warfare, to terrorism, crime, and even radical social activism. The era of massed field armies is passing, because the new information and communications systems are increasing the lethality of quite small units that can call in deadly, precise missile fire almost anywhere, anytime. In social conflicts, the Internet and other media are greatly empowering individuals and small groups to influence the behavior of states. Whether in military or social conflicts, all protagonists will soon be developing new doctrines, strategies, and tactics for swarming their opponents — with weapons or words, as circumstances require. Preparing for conflict in such a world will require shifting to new forms of organization, particularly the versatile, hardy, all-channel network. This shift will prove difficult for states and professional militaries that remain bastions of hierarchy, bound to resist institutional redesign. They will make the shift as they realize that information and knowledge are becoming the key elements of power. This implies, among other things, that Mars, the old brute-force god of war, must give way to Athena, the well-armed goddess of wisdom. Accepting Athena as the patroness of this information age represents a first step not only for preparing for future conflicts, but also for preventing them.   TL;DR: So yeah, the ""newfag"" script is a lot older than the oldfags realize."

Think about it: it's in the USG's interest to encourage people to famefag and get the word out. What better way to get extremists out of the West and scare up more defense funding with a terrifying new bogeyman to boot? Fear is a growth industry, and shitty OPSEC is its own reward.  Seriously though, FUCK hashtag activism. You want to know who #broughthomethegirls from Boko Haram?

More here; see also a documentary about Executive Outcomes on Youtube. New company page here:  PRIVATIZED SPECIAL FORCES: SPECIALIZED TASKS, TRAINING, EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTION (STTEP)  Anyway, here's a fantastically relevant quote from W. Somerset Maugham: if any of you moralfags care to explain to me why it isn't 100% true, I'm all ears.   You say that Cesare Borgia suffered the just punishment of his crimes. He was destroyed not by his misdeeds, but by circumstances over which he had no control. His wickedness was an irrelevant accident. In this world of sin and sorrow if virtue triumphs over vice it is not because it is virtuous, but because it has bigger and better guns; if honesty prevails over double-dealing, it is not because it is honest, but because it has a stronger army more ably led; and if good overcomes evil it is not because it is good, but because it has a well-lined purse. It is well to have right on our side, but it is madness to forget that unless we have might as well it will avail us nothing. We must believe that God loves men of good will, but there is no evidence to show that He will save fools from the result of their folly.   --W. Somerset Maugham, Then and Now  ¯\(ツ)/¯"

People are already talking about who should play Chen in the movie, lol. The article isn't directly Anonymous-related, but it's relevant because:  1) It's by Adrian Chen, who has written about Anonymous (and Goatse, and reddit, and other interesting things).  2) It briefly mentions ""Anonymous International"" a/k/a Shaltay Boltay which we've discussed here, and  3) It's a great description of what a well-run trolling operation can do:   It was a highly coordinated disinformation campaign, involving dozens of fake accounts that posted hundreds of tweets for hours, targeting a list of figures precisely chosen to generate maximum attention. The perpetrators didn’t just doctor screenshots from CNN; they also created fully functional clones of the websites of Louisiana TV stations and newspapers. The YouTube video of the man watching TV had been tailor-made for the project. A Wikipedia page was even created for the Columbian Chemicals disaster, which cited the fake YouTube video. As the virtual assault unfolded, it was complemented by text messages to actual residents in St. Mary Parish. It must have taken a team of programmers and content producers to pull off.   Anonymous used to do coordinated ops. On a smaller scale than this, but at least some coordination, and thought, and planning went into it. Now it seems like someone gets an idea for an op, and rushes into it on his/her own, without asking anyone else's opinion or doing any research. Hence all these stupid, ineffectual ops that fizzle out after a single YouTube video.  So I think there's a lot to learn here, about what Anonymous can do better, and about what governments are already doing. Learn how to troll, because it takes one to know one!"
anonymous,38gbxl,NinjaNetizen,2,Thu Jun 4 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"So I think there's a lot to learn here, about what Anonymous can do better, and about what governments are already doing. Learn how to troll, because it takes one to know one!   I'm sure most of you have seen articles about the US doing the same thing overseas, but there's something even weirder going down internally in intelligence community IO circles not many people know about. A lot of people affiliated with the Information Dominance Corps believe in the RMA concept of ""self-synchronization""--which basically amounts to self-indoctrination/mild voluntary brainwashing by everyone in the group agreeing to read the same sources of information--as seen in the public Facebook page here. In other words, it's all about creating a decentralized autonomous network that gets people to work in the same direction without any direct leadership involvement.  For the theory behind it, read Swarming and the Future of Conflict and The Strategic Implications of Information Dominance. The very definition of ""Information Dominance"" itself is sobering:    ""We think of dominance in terms of ""having our way""– ""Overmatch"" over all operational possibilities. This connotation is qualitative rather than quantitative. When dominance occurs, nothing done, makes any difference. We have sufficient knowledge to stop anything we don’t want to occur, or do anything we want to do.   IMO, the whole game plan is more than a little fucked up because a lot of the smartest, shrewdest, most ruthless people out here have been deliberately inculcated in a very specific strategic world view that's sharply at odds with typical mainstream government bullshit. Between the formation (and massive funding) of Cyber Command, the official declaration of Cyberspace as the Fifth Domain, the creation of the Highlands Group and the Military Cyber Professionals Association, these motherfuckers are on a roll. And as far as I can tell, there's absolutely nothing to stand in their way.  What can the part of Anonymous that's not actively being shaped by covert government groups take away from all this? Always remember the maxim: To inform is to influence. Be careful what (and how) you read because it shapes you into becoming who you are. As always, active analysis and an unwavering commitment to critical thinking beats passive media consumption every day of the week.

More media exposure for the conference, or is there something deeper going on? It's an open secret government CNE analysts and agency technocrats think of uneducated semi-skilled carders as being less than dogshit. If Sabu is doing this to ""redeem himself"" and get respect from the intelligence community, he can fucking forget it.  He doesn't realize it, but government information operations professionals have made cynically exploiting hackers' psychological vulnerabilities into an art and science. Here's an excerpt from the 2014 report ""Strengthening DoD Cyber Security with the Vulnerability Market:""   ""In the world of vulnerability discovery, a major motivation amongst researchers is their reputation. In the hacker community, an individual’s reputation ranges from the lowest revered status of ""script kiddie"" to the highest ""elite"" status. John Arquilla, a professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, recently estimated that only around 100 ""elite"" hackers are in the world today (Carroll, 2012). By leveraging reputational exclusivity and the egos of security researchers, the DoD could incentivize individuals to participate.   Unresolved daddy issues much? I can't imagine living under the combined weight of all that condescension, hostility and contempt would be worth any fee. All I know is being asked to work for basically a pat on the head and a peanut gets really fucking old, fast.   I'm not sure what the correct cyber analogy is here, but it's probably something not unlike this.  TL;DR: If Sabu wasn't such a self-serving shitbag, I'd honestly feel sorry for him.

This POS article does nothing but pine about how some random net denizens that may or may not form a collective intelligence, which may or may not share interests or common goal, which may or may not take directives from people in a group, is bullshit.  Basically there is no way to define ""anonymous"", it does not exist other then an idea groups of people may logically come to agreement with. And yet, this idiot Fruzsina Eördögh, a media writer .... writes an article about Adam Klein whose study was about the media, which studied how the news (which is again the media,) reported on anonymous from 2012-2013. How far the same shitstained rabbit hole do they go.  All of this to report that others reported people in anonymous may be viewed as pranksters. Wow! And this here alone makes one laugh until they shit themselves :  Mr. Klein found “a stark disparity between the news media’s interpretation and the hacktivists’ own words and actions,” he wrote. “As a dissident group, Anonymous runs the risk of becoming marginalized and trivialized by journalists as the next circus-like spectacle.”  OMG, Anonymous runs the risk of becoming marginalized? Who exactly runs this risk? Who cares and how would the media decide or know who of what and where even feels on the subject.  This article is the perfect example of writing something to try and make people think a way of a group, the meat and potatoes of this article is nothing but air.... their basis of truth is a fallacy where it's appealing to some quasi-educated media types, offering nothing in terms of even trying to find anyone that would ""identify"" as part of the Anonymous collective logic to verify it's thesis.  /tldr, media reporting on a study by a guy who studies media whose report was about media's opinions of the Anonymous collective identity, wondering if they are worried about how peeps feels on them as a collective.

You can get booted off of AnonOps for ironically calling someone a nigger (a historical part of internet lexicon, along with faggot).  Free information? Everything is piracy now.  Sharing of ideas? That still kind of happens, actually. Hell we both are here now discussing the sad condition of the final boss of the internet.  To me, Anonymous stood for (if anything) a metaphysical representation of the phrase ""Don't tell me what to do"".  Can't use foul language? Fuck you, I'll do it.  Can't troll e-attention whores? Fuck you, I'll do it.  Can't embarrass shoddy IT services? Fuck you, I'll do it.  Can't ignore the seemingly horrible problems everyone whines about on the internet?

Anons are confined to posting silly YouTube videos calling for change pretending to be an advocate for justice.   Stop getting distracted by trees (or faggots, lol). Look for the forest.

This current system of banking only creates more debt. Money literally equals debt. If everyone in America paid off their debts, individuals, companies, and the government, there would be no money in circulation. What kind of currency is that?"
anonymous,377shl,NinjaNetizen,1 point,Mon May 25 17:48:22 2015 UTC,"Money literally equals debt   This is unequivocally not true.  It is 100% a problem of not understanding nor caring about about budgets and financing. It may be due to social expectations or some other factor, but for some reason everyone thinks that you have to go out spending money whilly nilly the entirety of your young adult life.  Take a look at this article: http://www.fool.com/teens/teens01.htm  It bases its calculations off of $100 per year. Now imagine $1,000 per year (factor of 10). That's completely feasible with a summer job. You will just have to buck up and realize you can't have as much fun as you want if you want to end up ahead in life."
anonymous,377shl,NinjaNetizen,1 point,Mon May 25 19:14:46 2015 UTC,"Ok you see what I mean is, where the currency comes from. As in every dollar printed has a variable of ""x"" attached to it. Every single dollar in circulation has debt attached to it the minute it was created. All because when it boils down to it the currency that the American government relies on for its economy is borrowed. That's right. Borrowed at a debited amount. And that's just with the currency in circulation (paper money) which is roughly around 3% of Americas economy. 97% being virtual... 97% of money pulled outta thin air, that have ""interet"" attached to it. Now remember this is happening on a global scale. It's crazy to think that this system of ""federal reserve"" is still recongnized as something that's need. When it couldn't be entirely further from the truth. It hinders everything. How can you expect growth and change to be the outcome of debt. Money=debt how do you not understand this concept. If a currency requires you to go into debt in order to print that currency's money is just ludicrous how do you not see this?"

anonymous,377shl,NinjaNetizen,1 point,Mon May 25 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I am using it wrong. However, you cannot really have one without the other. Americas currency is more or less an economic loan given by the federal reserve in the form of treasury bonds. Where I am getting at is that you cannot really play in a ""world market"" where most of the players have already banned together. Players that own the major banks that own the currencies that cycle this perpetual debt. Sure every currency is backed by a value that is determined by say gold, or silver. But at the current rate debts are just another form of slavery. Banks understand this. Thus they have created the rules for how money is manged, created, and printed. What the fuck.

anonymous,36yptf,MarePueri,2,Sat May 23 23:44:24 2015 UTC,"That's a cute wiki. It's interesting that the work of obvious fanboys of an organization that cuts the heads off of people it finds to be apostates deny supporting the ISIS ""caliphate"". I mean pragmatically sure it's trying to play some coy game ""technically"" so the reddit admins don't ban it or block IPs, or perhaps even the same thing with law enforcement or intelligence agencies monitoring traffic. But let's be real, you're an obvious ISIS fanboy, as are whoever else is on that sub. Admins aren't stupid and can block it anyways since free speech doesn't mean you get to promote terror on someone else's server; neither are intel analysts so what's the damn point? It seems to me if you support an organization such as ISIS you would be opposed to anyone denying ""the caliphate"" for reasons of personal convenience, especially such as, ""I'm hoping to keep my reddit account."" It seems that would be placing the rules and will of the world over that of ""the caliphate,"" which such an organization would probably consider apostasy.   So the question is are you an apostate? If so, do you think you deserve to have your head cut off? These seem like difficult theological dilemmas that would only come up by circle jerking for such a fucked up organization.   But I digress. I have to assume I'm just feeding some sort of strange troll account because surely any sort of actual activist wouldn't think their ""technicality"" would be worth anything.

I'm not posting my own links to Reddit anywhere now; started my own subreddit, but there wasn't any payoff, so basically I hardly ever check in.   Not clear on what happens after you manually approve a comment; am I un-shadowbanned, or am I shadowbanned unless a mod decides to approve each comment, or what?"
anonymous,36r5rm,raincoaster99,1 point,Sun May 24 09:23:31 2015 UTC,"When you're shadowbanned, it's site-wide, and only the admins can undo it. You'd have to message them (maybe from another account? Not sure) and ask about it. It's completely random whether they'll reply and/or unban you.  Mods can only ban you in subs they moderate, and we can remove/approve comments from shadowbanned users. When you're banned from a sub you've posted in, I think you're supposed to get a message saying you're banned, so it's not technically a shadowban.   one of the mods there has concluded Matt Dehart is a kiddie diddler and he will not allow other points of view   It's pointless to talk about ""points of view."" A detective swore under oath that Dehart ""coerced a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct . . ."" But he's presumed innocent until proven guilty. Hopefully he'll get a fair trial and the truth will come out.

I see no reason to believe, based on the government's handling of this and other cases, that he will receive a fair trial, and the least we can do is keep an eye on it.  You are effectively defending that admin's right to jump to conclusions, but not mine to apply critical intelligence. This is logically inconsistent.

If you want this regulated so bad, it would actually make sense to have the businesses state owned. This is just a pretty dance around the word communism.  Capitalism in itself isn't bad. Its bad people who take advantage of a system designed to reward hard workers and bright thinkers.  It's also a consumer driven industry. People naturally want to get the best deal, this should - ideally - force prices to be competitive. There's also the cost factor: when you say workers have to be paid a certain amount, you do realize the price of the end product will go up to reflect that? Money doesn't appear out of thin air.  edit: after reading more, cryptocurrency is too volatile. It has no material backing, a dollar today could be worth 25 cents tomorrow. IRL currency is backed by precious commodities. Not to mention, where are you going to get this cryptocurrency you reward them with? Again, money doesn't appear out of thin air."

The issue is getting companies to comply - how easy would it be for this system to become corrupt? It essentially relies on public moral outrage - as well as the value of the reward: cryptocurrency, which is nowhere near being recognized as a stable 'currency'. Its main value is darkmarket transactions because it can't be traced.  Not to mention in its current state, it's not even developed, so it technically falls under a Personal Army request.

The reality of the world is that the majority of interracial violence is black-on-white. A century ago whites were 28% of the world's population. Now we are about to be under 10%. White countries the world over are being ""punished"" for slavery and colonialism, but the reality is that black and arab countries are far more guilty of this crime. For example, the crimes of the Turks include the Armenian holocaust. The crimes of the blacks Africa include the mass murder of the millions of white slaves the Barbary slavers took. The only reason blacks are around to complain about systemic racism is that we allowed them to marry, gave them health care, and kept them alive when we enslaved them. The Barbary slavers sodomized each and every woman and boy until they were no longer attractive, and worked everyone unfit for sexual abuse to death in the sun until they died. You can go to Africa today and witness the lack of white descendants of the Barbary slavers. They were completely wiped out, down to the last victim.  The white race has done nothing but benefit every race that is not their own. In return, blacks and arabs commit crimes against us on a massive scale. Tens of thousands of white women raped per year by blacks in America alone. Thousands murdered. 1400 girls systematically raped in Rotherham, one city, where whites are still a majority! We are being wiped out, and are disallowed from having what every other race has: an ethnic homeland of their own.  It is not ""supremacist"" to suggest that whites be allowed to have the same privileges that every other race as: homes without hostile foreigners running them out of their capital cities.

That isn't to say the billboard hackers didn't do something wrong. But the fix and getting the owners to top off their security protocols is worth a hell of a lot more than any of the investigative effort put forth on it. It is a wast of tax dollars."
anonymous,364gf0,ConcordApes,5,Sat May 16 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"I can.

The billboard operators didn't care about their security when an actual security researcher was telling them to fix it. And according to recent tweets, it still isn't secure.

If something else pops up on the radar and falls into their laps, they will pounce on a wrapped gift.  But beyond that, they give you a lecture about leaving stuff visible in your car and the need to secure it, and then go on their merry way."
anonymous,364gf0,ConcordApes,2,Sat May 16 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"As as side note, I think it is a mistake to think that local police departments in major metropolitan areas no longer have the sophistication to investigate, track down and prosecute computer crimes.  There are bound to be just as many tech savvy computer geeks on the police force as there are in the general population.  And we are getting to the point where the officers with 10 years on the force have grown up with tech.  There is bound to be at least one person on each middle to large city's force that knows their shit.  And the ability to issue subpoenas is more than enough of a tool to snag most of the script kiddie hackers out today.  The only question is if you are are a big enough fish to fry."

The offices getting hurt by it are the ones that don't have the funds for a successful backup plan.  There has been a small handful of successful strategies to prevent offices from getting infected. And it has been based on the experiences of offices that have been hit by email viruses in the past.

anonymous,35otqy,OswaldWasAFag,2,Tue May 12 12:45:34 2015 UTC,"Its a public perception shaped by nearly a decade of media exposure in very specific ways. Since there is no membership, no organization to speak of, 'Anonymous' makes for an excellent shield, or 'glove' by other groups that wish to remain unknown. This of course can include government departments, identity thieves, terrorist cells, activist organizations, script kiddies, you name it.   And because 'Anonymous' reputation has been established thanks to the media, public perception will always be of teenage shut-ins and angsty college drop-outs, (ect) regardless of whoever did a particular deed."

anonymous,35otqy,FBIthrowaway2346,1 point,Tue May 12 08:08:14 2015 UTC,"yeah fuck you and your soap box. but you seem honest so ill return in kind.  because all of it is reactionary nowdays. all of it. there is no foresight and discussion. its people seeing what happens in the media and reacting to it - thus reactionary. simply put, the majority of Anonymous has become an easily influenced non-thinking circlejerk.  call it gmos, or police brutality, nobody fucking cares about the discussion. its just knee-jerk reactions. everyone wants to complain but nobody wants a fucking solution. thats why all you get is drop-out/no-jobs who have nothing better to do than sit on the internet and complain about their problems and shovel all the guilt on capitalism or muh gubbermint/the state.  and eventually enough of them get riled up to the point where some nameless idiot downloads server-testing software from sourceforge and gets their ass v&.  simply put, its literally turned into a culture of google-genius'. the meritocracy that once governed has decayed. Anonymous is idiots. dissent is b&. thats why nobody serious follows. thats why its a laughingstock."
