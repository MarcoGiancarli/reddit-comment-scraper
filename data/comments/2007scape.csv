I'm just worried that potentially a 50℅ land expansion will be not only time consuming, but also opens the potential for new bugs and possibly broken training methods.   Also considering the fact OSRS isn't perfect at the moment , is it really correct to add something when there is a host of issues plaguing a lot of players. I voted yes to Zeah and originally it looked nice on paper. The more I think about it and the more I look at some of the issues in the game, the more I regret voting yes. I don't think this is what we need right now.  Fixing what we have before adding something new in my oppinion is what is needed, especially if the new content is going to be huge and will take months to develop."

Not to mention there are endless ways to make existing content better and add new things on the map we already have.   My biggest fear considering Zeah is that it will be bug-ridden, abundant with overpowered leveling and money gaining methods that grants overpowered equipment, ultimately changing the OSRS I used to love into a completely different game."

2007scape,3e341p,Frozzie,0,Tue Jul 21 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"My concern with Zeah is that unintended consequences of the update are unlikely to be addressed quickly, if at all.   Much of the ""damage"" associated with Zulrah could have been avoided if the boss drop table had been changed earlier. The relatively small change they did make was seemingly insufficient and perhaps a case of ""too little, too late"".  NMZ magic persisted as an ""overpowered"" training method for months before it was fixed as a bug. AFK NMZ melee was not even addressed in a survey/poll until relatively recently. Even now, we are awaiting more data in regards to the consequences AFK NMZ melee has on the game.   If ""bugs"" and ""unintended"" mechanics were fixed more quickly without polling, we would have fewer of these issues. I have the utmost respect for the OSRS dev team, but I think it would be in our collective best interests if they acted more quickly in response to unforeseen consequences in future."

Zeah will probably be riddled with bugs and glitches and whatnot. They shouldnt release new content until zulrahwyverns are nerfed and skilling is given a buff.

Maybe a village in the Lumby Swamp.    Maybe we could expand the Lumbridge forest and add a new town inbetween Lumbridge and Draynor    We could have new places in Mort Myre swamp.  We could give Meiyerditch a purpose.  Theres a huge empty desert on the map.  Maybe we could have a big town in the Wilderness? maybe it could be a safezone to re-equip.  We could add multiple new islands to make using ports useful not just for Karamja  There could be an outpost on white wolf mountain.  I'd like us to expand barbarian Village onto the mountain behind it.  I'd like to know why we have to add a whole new continent instead of just expanding on the one we have. /u/modmatk

There is plenty of broken and unused content that players would love to see revamped or made more useful.  The nice thing about this is updating old content is in most cases going to use less time than creating entirely new content meaning more frequent updates and a happier playerbase."

2007scape,3e2eop,ModMatK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"Due to antifire potions and the sheer cost of dragon/onyx bolts.  Range has 2 options for decent DPS, crossbows with diamond bolts (e) and the blowpipe.  There really is not much variety at all.   I know Mod Maz said that updating bolt tips would add over 700 new items to the database.  However, if you limit the update to only runite bolts, that drops the number to 90 objects. If you further limit the inventory icons to a single icon instead of stacks of 1,2,3,4 and 5 bolts. the further drops it to only 16 new objects added to the database.  Which may help reduce the amount of work greatly while giving range 8 new types of bolts.  that increases range's variety by 5x.  granite maul needs to be fixed, perhaps fixing pid will do the trick? from what I understand blast furnace also needs some fixing. black chinchompas could use with a removal of the ""release"" option in the wilderness since angry players who get pked essentially destroy their only loot before they die.  Which kind of nullifys the point of the wildy rejuv update. ents need to be buffed i remember seeing a comparison and they are actually slower than legit woodcutting which doesnt seem right since the whole risk vs reward thing. green blue and red dragons are not assigned as high level slayer targets players have been asking for a while since you guys are adding them to nievs slayer cave?  im not well informed on this sorry if its wrong. I believe players have suggested that battle axes could use with some buffing as they are much slower than scimitars but hit very similar.  nmz and splashing but you guys are already working on that   Those are just off the top of my head but you guys should make a thread or something asking players what content is broken, unused, or needs buffing im sure there is plenty!  Perhaps make a reddit thread and the top 10 most upvoted responses could be voted on officially for player priorities."
2007scape,3e2eop,rudyv8,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"I think the majority of those fit nicely into the QoL updates. We will  be looking at the slayer assignments as part of the slayer update in August so I'd expect the dragons to be sorted then. The blast furnace also just received a fix, although I think there may still be an issue with the strength XP.   The first point is a bigger question though. I like the idea of having different tips for runite bolts only. Seems much more manageable."

There is a reason that when they were originally implemented the tips could only go on untradable, hard to get bolts that have a low range attack bonus.  It's also not going to significantly increase range variety. A much better and much easier step would be lowering the alch value of onyx bolts."

There's no reason I can see for this, he even acknowledges if you have a clue in your inventory when you talk (just to tell you to use it on him) For older clues, if you have the emote items equipped as a double agent dies Uri will apear without having to do the emote again. This behaviour is absent on (I think) all new Uri clues For riddle clues, when you talk to the NPC (or w/e) it just automagically deposits a casket in your inventory. You don't even have to click through and actually talk to the NPC. I'd prefer the behaviour of older clues where you have to talk and it skips the casket and gives a new clue or your loot When killing the Armadyl/Bandos minions, their drop code seems to be slightly buggy. They'll die, have their death animations, and then the loot shows up a few seconds later than you would expect. They also share a drop table for some reason. I would expect a hammer from the Bandos one, and feathers from the big armour plated chicken, but it's just random For elite challenge clues, the mechanic for solving them is different. Instead of getting an extra 'challenge scroll' added to your inventory and having to talk to the NPC to enter the solution, you open your original clue, enter answer, then talk to NPC again. I guess this isn't really a bug, but it's not consistent with any other clue tier and it's annoying if you switch between types I haven't had any 3a weapons yet"

Why are they necessary to determine whether nerfing NMZ & splashing is the right call? The way I see it, even if 5-10% of users are actually using these methods (a figure which I think was quoted by the OSRS team; I might be wrong (although it seems to be pretty much everyone in my experience)), this is still 5-10% of people that are getting almost the same benefits that they would get from botting combat skills/magic. They are still afking for large amounts of time while gaining experience. Is it because it would require a lot of dev time to nerf, or because you want to determine how exactly to nerf them, or because you are hesitant at the current time to change something that's already in game, or something else entirely? Edit: Or maybe it is because you doubt the nerf would be able to pass a poll?"

2007scape,3e2eop,ModMatK,0,Tue Jul 21 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"Well heres this. I started playing since the day of release on oldschool and i'm ~113 combat. I've had several friends who started playing near the beginning of the year and they're already at max combat, with the time saved to buy 99 range magic and prayer. It is used by almost everybody. It doesn't make any sense not too. 95k in every melee skill every night? Seriously, I cannot imagine why you guys don't think this is an issue against the integrity of the game. If it really is coming down to the issue of removing these two afk methods would make a lot of users quit the game, for the simple fact a lot of these people playing oldschool are either in college or graduated with a job. The argument that people don't have time to play and would like an alternative method to leveling is a valid argument, because well it means more revenue for you guys. Obviously vital to the longevity of the game. You guys need to be a bit more clear with what is going on. A lot of what people dont understand is that the team working on oldschool is tiny compared to the live game and it sucks you guys get as much flak as you do"
2007scape,3e2eop,Sma11ey,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:06 2015 UTC,I have to ask: Why does it matter who or how many people that do splash and NMZ? Surely regardless of how many people who do these things they are very overpowered and unbalanced ways to gain xp while remaining afk almost all the time?
2007scape,3e2eop,Mentosfruitcore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:57 2015 UTC,Mainly because there are 50% of the community who don't see it as a bad thing - hence why a poll won't work. If we are going to make a decision on it I want to make it based on facts rather than emotion.
2007scape,3e2eop,ModMatK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:03 2015 UTC,Mainly because there are 50% of the community who don't see it as a bad thing   I don't think that's necessarily true. time and time again people have shown they vote for their self interest not the game. most people voted no because they want to benefit from 6 hour afking regardless if it's bad or good. I reckon the % of people that genuinely believe 6 hour afking is good for the game is much smaller than 50%. this is why polling nerfs and fixes is flawed. you seriously need to stop looking at that poll already and take action. you've done once before with nmz magic. you can do it again.

I think it is a fact that 100% AFK is possible without risk in NMZ or with splashing without putting in effort. One should actually play the game to be able to get into higher levels, regardless of what skill. That's what you do when playing games. You even said very clearly in one of the latest Q&A streams that you don't want to devalue content and that you need to put in effort to achieve things.

2007scape,3e379s,why84,17,Tue Jul 21 16:41:33 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good idea for Rs3
2007scape,3e379s,JonBargan,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:37 2015 UTC,How about a boss that inhales your membership.
2007scape,3e379s,Bane_of_Minorities,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:59 2015 UTC,How about a huge monster that literally inhales gp.   The gp vaccum boss. Rare drop is  a pet vaccum that follows you around and vaccums up your dropped items. I'd for sure it it while firemaking so it will suck up my ashes
2007scape,3e379s,Dabandplayrs,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:06 2015 UTC,if it sucked up all those coins i left on the ground i wouldve been a zillionaire.

2007scape,3dysqz,Walrusasauras,15,Mon Jul 20 18:07:35 2015 UTC,fm isn't that click intensive. it's no construction.
2007scape,3dysqz,Jabroniiii,15,Mon Jul 20 18:10:27 2015 UTC,Construction became a lot less click intensive when they added that you can you use your keyboard to go through chat dialogues.
2007scape,3dysqz,DoctoryeIlow,3,Mon Jul 20 18:28:32 2015 UTC,How? I do not know of this.

2007scape,3dysqz,Kyledabaws,7,Mon Jul 20 20:25:01 2015 UTC,It can be pretty click intensive if you do the G/E or Falador PvP world method for fastest exp.
2007scape,3dysqz,Cudabear,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:26 2015 UTC,I am noob.  Could you plz give me a free explanation?
2007scape,3dysqz,brand_new70x7,13,Mon Jul 20 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"You know how you always step one square west after lighting a fire?  Well, start on the west side of the G/E like normal, on the closest tile to the bank you can light a fire on.  When you're halfway through your inventory (approx on the stairs of the G/E), start forcing your character to firemake the other way by running over each new fire you make and lighting the next fire to the east.   This will allow you to finish your inventory where you started, right next to the bank, meaning you're getting almost the fastest experience possible."
2007scape,3dysqz,Cudabear,3,Mon Jul 20 19:02:10 2015 UTC,What does the pvp aspect of it do though?  Thanks for your time.
2007scape,3dysqz,brand_new70x7,8,Mon Jul 20 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"No trouble.  The white knight castle (respawn point if you've completed Recruitment Drive) gets a bank chest in PvP worlds.  This, coupled with the fact that it's one of the larger safe areas where you can light fires, meant people would use this place for this kind of efficient firemaking.  That said, the G/E replicates this kind of requirement perfectly."
2007scape,3dysqz,Cudabear,2,Mon Jul 20 19:15:59 2015 UTC,Is using a bank chest in PvP faster than having a noted stack in your inv and using them on the GE banker?
2007scape,3dysqz,Natinals,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's the same, but there's probably less mis-click potential at the PvP chest since G/E has so many people standing around."
2007scape,3dysqz,Cudabear,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"I see.  Thank you for your help.  You can call me bae-lorian note if you want, or ya know..  Bae for short."
2007scape,3dysqz,brand_new70x7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:48 2015 UTC,Or you could just take 3 seconds and run back to the bank.
2007scape,3dysqz,Fetai,3,Mon Jul 20 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"yeah, but that 3 seconds x thousands of inventories to get 99, or even more to get 200M, saves time over the long run."
2007scape,3dysqz,Cudabear,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:14 2015 UTC,Or skip Arthritis and level Carpal Tunnel instead...

2007scape,3e33hu,BioMasterZap,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"Didn't Mod Maz comment on this again just the other day? Even if it is just Runite, it will still require reworking of the enchant spells and bolt pouch and wouldn't be a simple job. It kinda seems like asking for 5 new items in a construction hotspot maxed out at 7 and then asking for 2 more instead when they tell you why; whether it is 2 or 5, both require a rewrite to make it work. Bolts seem to have a similar issue, whether it is all bolts or just runite, it still will need to rewrite a lot of things to account for the differences.  Also, I personally don't want to see the runite bolts get all bolt tips. Most the bolt tips aren’t used for a reason; not just because they are low damage but because their effects just aren’t that good. All I really see this doing is providing a stronger version of Ruby and Diamond bolts and devaluing adamant bolts; which seems a bit counterproductive since I think the goal is more to provide alternatives to those two, not make them better.  That being said, I did have an idea while back to introduce new combination bolt tips that would have revised version of the old effects. This would still provide more diversity, but without adding stronger ruby/diamond or adding dead content."
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:22 2015 UTC,"I always wonder how delusional people have to be when they think this is a good idea.  Here are the only significant effects:   People use rune diamond instead of addy diamond People only use rune ruby only at corp Void melee/Z spear is devalued because of the above Jade rune will be entirely OP or nerfed to uselessness   Why are you pushing so hard for a bolt update that will simply change the range attack bonus on diamond (e) bolts and possibly unbalance corp hunting? Jagex put the tips the way they did for balancing reasons.  If you can think of any other (actually significant) uses for these new bolts feel free to tell me. Also, it would be pretty lazy for Jagex to just use one icon for these bolts but 5 for everything else in the game...."
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:40 2015 UTC,"Saphire bolts drain prayer and add it to your own good with pking + smite. Dragon bolts (e) can be antifired out of.  Adding diamond bolts spec to rune would give range a semi powerful spec right now its silly that addy bolts are the go to weapon for pking because of the price + bullshit dragon/onyx bolts have rendering them useless Pearl bolts do the water spec that is increased damage and even further increased on monsters with fiery garments.  Could be useful for certain slayer tasks and maybe even cerberus.  More powerful than diamond bolts in those situations giving them a niche use.  This use would probably give them a decent profit margin for fletching too.   Not to mention that this would also make them more powerful than diamond on tzhaar monsters. They will also likely be cheaper than diamond, giving them a guaranteed niche use for firecapes. Jade bolts would be good for pvp because if you actuslly have audio on you will hear the spec before it happens giving you some time to switch weapons. The stun effect is long enough to maybe combine with a melee spec or another weapon combo. Crossbiws are also inceeadibly slow at 3.6 second intervals between hits, giving opponents time to eat 2 sharks between hits.  If thr jade spec activates they cant eat as much food as fast, drasticslly allowing for a better KO potential since your opponent cant telly or eat (or drink prayer for that matter if they are low) Topaz bolts lower mage level by what you hit, would be very useful for clan v clan fights or even just brid v brid fights.  Yeah you can just super restorr but you have a limited number of sips especially if therrs a risk of being tbed.  Eventually you are gona run out of restores. If you arent careful about watching your restore pots while dealing with topaz bolts, it may result in you getting smited especially in deep wildy by mage bank when youe tbed.  Also, people don't usually bring restore potions to castle wars and other PVP style non-risk minigames. emerald bolts could have their posion upped from 5-7 for the difference from mith to rune. not massive but since some bosses cannot be venom'd and at max get posioned for 6. Having the ability to posion for 7 may seem more desireable to some players.    those are just my ways of seeing how the bolts may be benificial"
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"I guess my answer is    Topaz bolts lower mage level by what you hit, would be very useful for clan v clan fights or even just brid v brid fights. Yeah you can just super restorr but you have a limited number of sips especially if therrs a risk of being tbed. Eventually you are gona run out of restored and it may result in you getting smited especially in deep wildy by mage bank when youe tbed.   this kind of delusional.  Diamond (e) would be better to use with smite because of the increased damage. Dragon (e) is still heavily used. Pearl might be useful but in all likelihood the DPS would still be worse than other options.  It's not clear how much of a benefit they provide. The last thing Jagex wants is more stunning in PvP.  However, I rest my case with the last two bullets. lol."
2007scape,3e33hu,SophisticatedCause,3,Tue Jul 21 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"I know that the ""chance of special"" is different with each bolt tip. Im not 100% sure if topaz spec more often than diamond but i do know diamond only have like a 10-15% chance of spec in PVP.  if topaz have higher chance to special and drain mage therefore stopping barrages/entangles.  It may be more benificial than diamond bolts to some players."
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:55 2015 UTC,Oh shit but super restores completely negate the effect (and the effect of sapphire) so I guess they would be useless just like dragon (e).....  No one is going to use topaz. I promise you.
2007scape,3e33hu,SophisticatedCause,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"Castlewars is a prime example where people would use this. Just because something appears useless to you doesn't make it indeed useless, each situation is different and not everyone carries super restores with them."
2007scape,3e33hu,SophisticatedCause,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:28 2015 UTC,or they dont have enough restores and run out over the course of the fight.
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you are so excited about a bolt update that would accomplish less than just lowering the alch value of onyx (e).  If you actually believe that sapphire bolts or topaz bolts will have any use, take a step back and reconsider your position on the issue."
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:37 2015 UTC,Edit: For some reason confused pearl effect with sapphire. Regardless both types of bolts are useful.  Pearl would be very potent against fire creatures.   Fire giants -Tzhaar creatures - including jad i'd think. Other future fire creatures.
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:47 2015 UTC,saphire bolts lower your opponents prayer by 5% and increase your prayer by a few points of what you hit as well.  I believe its pearl or opal bolts that have the effect you are talking about.  either way you have a good point.  People may use those bolts to fight jad if they hit better than diamond.  Niche uses for different scenarios
2007scape,3e33hu,SophisticatedCause,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"Fixed, honestly got confused between the two."
2007scape,3e33hu,200m-ehp,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:12 2015 UTC,onyx (e) are already at alch value.... its becoming very apparent that u have no knowledge of bolts or anything you are talking about.  Not sure if stupid or troll....
2007scape,3e33hu,SophisticatedCause,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:55 2015 UTC,Again. Think this through. If you lower the alch value the price of onyx (e) will drop. The price can't drop anymore because the price is already at alch value. Lower the alch value so that their price drops and they become cost efficient.
2007scape,3e0wbg,BioMasterZap,46,Tue Jul 21 02:36:20 2015 UTC,"i lik the mole one the most, the gap between snakeskin boots and 20m worth ranger boots is far too big."

But a new boots for rangers is something that has been on my ""to suggest"" list for a while. But yah, jumping from a 1k +3 boot to a 20m +8 boot is a bit much.

Mole is great for rangers, it's a mid-level monster and these are mid-level range boots, it'd make sense that they come from hide, and they probably wouldn't be worth a ton but would definitely revamp the mole a bit.

2007scape,3e0wbg,namniz,4,Tue Jul 21 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you are serious or sarcastic, but I know PvM has had a lot of updates and I am looking forward to see some other updates like Skilling myself. But I don't think that just because PvM has gotten other things that these old bosses should be neglected, especially if it can help fill gaps."
2007scape,3e0wbg,namniz,3,Tue Jul 21 07:58:26 2015 UTC,I like the ideas for giving some of the bosses more unique drops that can be sold but I don't think we really need more range armour. I wish I could give a better idea but the only thing we need imo is new BIS mage armour which I wouldn't want to come from any of these bosses.
2007scape,3e0wbg,Skewered_Planets,4,Tue Jul 21 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"Glad you like the concept. I actually didn't realize I made all the drops ranged focus until a few minutes ago though. I agree that mages need a higher tier armor; I'd love to see something like infinity with melee defences like splitbark and a decent prayer bonus.  However, Rangers could still use more gear as well. Both rangers and mages need a good prayer set; melee has a lot of prayer gear and rangers really has none unless you think +1 bonus counts (it doesn’t really). That is what I was going for with the King Dragonhide; a slightly buffed black d hide and a decent prayer set for rangers. Rangers also could use their own ammy, which is where kq drop came from, since fury is more a melee thing and mages have occult.  And I think I explained why I think rangers could use a new set of boots; melee and mage don't have nearly as big a gap as rangers. I mean imagine if we had rune boots at 10k with +2 str and then dragon boots at 10m with +8 strength; that would be a huge jump, like rangers currently have...  But yah, while there are gaps, I agree that these bosses may not be best way to fill them. I do like the King Dhide idea though and would like to see them get something."

2007scape,3e0wbg,Some_Wiseguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"I know that PvM has had a fair amount of content this year so far and I am looking forward to some skilling updates myself. But just because PvM has had some new bosses doesn’t mean the old ones should be neglected. I wouldn't want to see this idea discarded or voted down solely because PvM already had updates, just like I wouldn't want to see a Firemaking update skipped because Construction had an update. Just like there are many skills, there are also many things to PvM as well. Also, for what it is worth, adding new drops to existing monsters would require far less dev time than making a new boss since they just need new item graphics and to code them in; so I'd expect this would be a rather small job they could do alongside bigger updates, like skilling."

2007scape,3e0wbg,DracoKnows,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:46 2015 UTC,I think pets are enough to keep people going to these bosses and preventing them from becoming dead content.   I'd like to see them focus on more stuff for mid ranged combat. Something the players level 50-70 can do for middle of the road gear. It seems like almost all new content is just high level stuff that offers best in slot items.
2007scape,3e0wbg,SoleyRS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"My issue with pets is they are more of a prestige things. It is nice when you can kill bosses and get its ""big drop"" for some profit. For these bosses, that isn't much of a thing anymore, which is why I'd like to see them get some unique content again. Also, it would give ironmen a reason to kill them =P  I agree about more mid-level content. I actually just realized that all three my suggested drops were ranged focused... But yah, there are a lot of gaps in combat. Ranged and Mage both need a good prayer set besides void. Rangers could use a unique amulet like melee has fury (sorta) and mage has occult/3rd age. Mages also need more low tier armor between wizard and mystic... And I think I went over why rangers could use more boots. new boss drops may not be the best way to add this, but I do like the King Dragonhide idea for a prayer set; it would be nice to see a more costly dhide."

2007scape,3e0wbg,Invictaq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:12 2015 UTC,"I did mention about the Visage in the main post, but the problem there is KBD isn't the best way to get one. If you really want a visage drop, you are probably better off killing wyverns for the 1 in 10k drop than killing kbd for the 1 in 5k. The idea with the King Hides isn't that it will be a rare drop that makes bank, but a rare drop that will make that trip a bit more profitable and something only the KBD can drop."

I go there late at night with my friends (when rs is very inactive) and hop to at least 20 worlds before finding an empty one. Then after banking, we come back to see our spot taken and we have to hop again. He is only 70 ranged and I am only 1 def, so with our combined weaknesses we find the KBD to be a suitable boss for people of our low levels. If for some reason a new dhide was released for him, I could see us without a boss to kill together for a while. P.S. What does the KBD have to do with prayer?"
2007scape,3e0wbg,ii_social_guy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"It is already rather popular and I can understand your concern. These bosses may not need new drops, but I would like to see them have something unique again. If done right, the new unique drops wouldn't cause a ton of new players to kill the monster, but give those who already wanted to kill more of an reason to do so since that is something that only that monster drops.  As for what the KBD has to do with prayer... About as much has it has to do with D Meds I suppose. I heard how the RS2 Queen Black Dragon had Royal Hides that made a slightly better version of Dragonhide and kinda liked the idea. Since I didn't want to intrude on the attack bonus of armadyl or the defence bonuses of karils, I went with prayer since it is something rangers could use."

I was using the cost of tanning not only to add a bit of a monkey sink, but to control the minimum price of the King Dragonhide armor. You have the price of the hide to consider, then adding 15k on top of it. This would mean the coif could not drop below 10k, the chaps below 20k, and the body below 30k; and that is assuming the rare hide drop itself has no value.

2007scape,3e0wbg,imnumber4,2,Tue Jul 21 08:42:25 2015 UTC,Whoops my bad. Mistook unique for untradeable :/ anyway i think there should be more untradeable content as in counters te entire 'Lets farm x for y drops' situation. I also think there should be more untradeable endgame content (like overloads are untradeable in rs3). That way people have to go out and Hunt for the item themself rather than farm zulrah or stake tilk they have the money. (And up the prices)
2007scape,3e0wbg,ahkpls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:20 2015 UTC,"I agree about the positives of untradeables, but there can also negatives. One thing I like about RuneScape is that I can choose how I earn the items I want and don't have to get it myself. If I want something like Bandos, I could kill the boss for it, or kill another boss to make the money, or do slayer, fish, smith, or collect fungi even. When you start to add untradeables, it limits the player's freedom, which can be especially bad if the new untradeables are best in slot.  A good example of what I mean is Chaotics from RS2. They were a pretty big upgrade over the existing tradable weapons, but you had to play Dungeoneering to get them. A lot of players didn't care for Dungeoneering, but they still wanted and needed those weapons to do the things like enjoyed like bossing. And while the Extreme Potions did give more value to herblore, it also made a mess of training prices since everyone suddenly needed high herblore.  So yah, untradeables content is good, but it needs to be done carefully. I think the balance should make it useful enough that players want it, but not strong enough that players need it. A while back I did post an idea of Specialty Weapons, which were level 80 upgrades of things like Darklight and could very well have untradeables factors to them; I think my original idea was a tradable upgrade it though. But that idea introduced new best in slot weapons, but only against certain monsters like Demons; and the weapons would only be slightly better than the Abyssal Tentacle so it wouldn't be a major change, just something useful.  So that is my thoughts on untradeables; sorry for making it a small essay. I would like to look more into untradeables rewards in future ideas, but for this one I wanted to give these old bosses some unique drops again to make them a bit more worth hunting."

I am curious about the remaining skills and what methods and rates you are looking at.  Mining you can powermine exactly as normal, so an easy 99 at minimum 50k exp an hour. How does smithing work on ult, and what hours are you expecting for 99?  Cooking I'll assume is not too bad. Another user mentioned 100k exp/ hour?  Farming... How does this work on ult, and what kind of exp per week do you tend to gain? I imagine this bottlenecked by access to seeds? And then is farm the main way of getting herbs? Or do you farm things like Chaos druids? And then seconds? Very curious here.  Crafting you have the charter stores with glass blowing? Is this correct? Fletch I assume you'd just cut logs and fletch on the spot, then... Alch? Drop?   Slayer you just train as normal I guess, just a matter of time.  Prayer. What efficient methods for prayer are there? Kill a load of bones, tele to house and use on alter? Tele to ecto and use there?   Construction I've seen an ironman outside rimmington cutting oaks, using servent to plank-make. He said this was maybe 40k an hour. Is this what you're looking at to 99?  Magic you could probably just buy runes from stores I'm assuming.  Finally runecrafting. I'm going to take a wild guess you need to farm a monster for noted pure essence until you have enough for 99, then just run all of these? I can't imagine what your expectations rates would be when you include resource gathering.  I find it so interesting you doing this, although I know I wouldn't be able to handle it at all. I admire your dedication. I really hope you don't mind taking the time to explain how training your stats works on ult!"

Though, I like that it gives a sense of security for the general direction of the game. If things were my way, we'd have no G.E or F2P worlds, but things aren't my way, see?  So, by me saying I allow NMZ and splashing, I'm absolutely not saying that the game should be plagued by bots, or not have polls, or that every skill in the game be AFKable. At no point was any of that said. Now go back to your hole where you RMT your character into wealth and lose it all in Duel Arena and leave me alone."
2007scape,3dzpgf,petruskax,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:47 2015 UTC,"You are saying exactly that, because that's the only the they are in the game, they never received 75% approval, they weren't voted in a Dev blog and if you haven't given any justification as to why one skill or a few should be completely afkable to 99 and the rest shouldn't.  And whatever nonsense you decided to right about the duel arena at the end is nor relevant or sensical."

However, that ""many"" don't choose the options that are best for the balance and longevity of the game. The players are not defining balance in the game, they are choosing what to add to the game.

2007scape,3e2v8u,imnumber4,3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:21 2015 UTC,No. Make the original version of the damn boots for once just stop trying to make new things it always turns out poorly.

If you put a jewel on them the jewel will be very small to fit properly onto the small boots. This will make them unnoticeable. If they want it to be noticeble they gotta put a big jewel but then it will look out out of place.   It's probably better to change the whole model because we can seperate ragefire boots from infinity more clearly and visibly.  I'd rather not have glaivens become ranger boots with an emerald on top."

It's usually better to just use the points on more skips instead of wasting it on a helm that gives some extra defence bonuses and a few other attachments (which are useless until 93 because all of the tasks the attachments are useful for are skip tasks anyways).  I can't ""make up"" stuff like this hoping for people to fall for it because no one believes stuff like this, since they're generally too stubborn to accept what is and isn't ""efficient"", especially when it comes to slayer."

2007scape,3dzqps,celery_under,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"It does. The bonuses provided to the helmet aren't worth it for the 400 points you have to spend on it until 93 slayer whenever you unlock smoke devils. The defence bonus is generally useless because you're either praying against the monster or your SGS will outheal the damage you take anyways. The black mask is obviously a must have, but the helm provides very little benefit to an efficient slayer before level 93."

2007scape,3e1ksw,potassiumpony,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly the problem isn't that it isn't using multiple cores, it is that it doesn't use the graphics card.  It would probably be easier to rewrite the rendering code to use the GPU than it would to try use multiple cores.  Using multiple cores would not even improve it that much either. At best you increase the speed by the product of the number of cores. In reality I imagine there isn't a lot that can be easily parallelized anyway. So we're talking a theoretical max speedup of say 4x if you had code that perfectly utilized threads. This is literally impossible though, stuff is too linked to do this, especially in games.  Switching to the graphics card would though. The theoretical speedup is now only limited by the speed of your graphics cards. For a game like RS, really any graphics card even a few years old should be able to run anything at all in it at 60+ fps. Rendering on the CPU is literally one of the most computationally expensive things you can do.  But really, it would be too much effort to try to parallelize the code. It would almost certainly introduce bugs and race conditions. Switching to rendering on the GPU would also require significant effort, essentially rewriting all rendering code. Extreme amount of effort.  Basically we are stuck with what we have. You just have to deal with it I'm afraid."
2007scape,3e1ksw,malloc_more_ram,0,Tue Jul 21 10:36:26 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, your processor most likely has 2 or 4 cores (duo/quad). The ""i5"" doesn't mean you have a 5-core processor.

The yellow dot is where you need to stand on the island, and the other dot is where Zulrah will be. The colour of the Zulrah dot indicates Zulrah's colour (Red is melee (weak to mage), blue is weak to range, green is weak to mage).   Sorry, not sure what the yellow lines mean."

I think this is because it was meant to tie into the new Gnome Storyline which needed more buildup first.  And for people asking what is there to add... Well, I don't know. Maybe resolving the plot of an army of monkeys and a fleet of gnome ships preparing to go to war with the entire world... Also, Quests are about more than rewards and the D Scimmy has nothing to do with continuing the plot. I mean did anyone expect Fairy Tale line to give new Dragon Daggers or longswords, yet it continued Lost City.

Agility's another ~100 hours or 4 days, mining ~60h/2.5, Magic even bursting is gonna be just about 50 hours/2 days, Herb ~1.5 days, Thieving a day and a bit, etc.  Throughout you'd need to be doing farm runs, these rates assume 100% efficiency (no choosing more afk/cheaper over xp, 100% focus), and don't take into account a single second spent making money to fund all this.    So unless you estimated that someone spend 24 hours a day playing, they're not getting this cape in a month or two."

2007scape,3dxkr8,BioMasterZap,5,Tue Jul 21 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"It doesn’t bring more content to complete; the Diary Cape is existing content and requiring it for Music Cape doesn't make it new. I have been working towards a Diary Cape, but I still hate that it is required for the Music Cape. I hate it more so because the Music Cape is viewed as lesser to the other capes when it really isn't. There is no problem when easy 99s like Cooking trim capes, but can't one of the non-skill capes get a reasonable trim requirement; that would be too easy -.- As someone who prefers to do things like Quests and other completionist content over just grinding 99s, it is rather annoying to see every cape I earn have its trimmed locked behind the hardest to get cape in the game."
2007scape,3dxkr8,BioMasterZap,20,Mon Jul 20 13:24:52 2015 UTC,Trimmed capes are of the highest reward in game. The music cape has no relation to skill and therefore should not be trimmed by a skill cape to avoid association. Anyone who has a quest cape would automatically get the quest cape if all holiday track were unlocked fast tracking them to a trimmed where other trims have to be acquired by a specific set of activities per cape. This leaves only the AD cape to act as the second cape. It is not about better or worse. It is about mechanics to ensure consistency not status to acquire and item with the stats of a trimmed cape.
2007scape,3dxkr8,Beznia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't see how Quest and Music is too easy compared to Fletching and Cooking. But either way, requiring Achievement Diary Cape to trim it is overkill and makes it the hardest cape in the game to get. Maybe it is worth just releasing the cape without its trim and polling it, like what was done for the quest cape trim. Personally, I am tired of seeing every non-skill Cape of Accomplishment require the Diary Cape to trim."
2007scape,3dxkr8,viishied,3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am tired of seeing every non-skill Cape of Accomplishment require the Diary Cape to trim.   The only other cape is the Quest cape. Who cares if it's going to be the hardest cape to trim, don't be mad that you won't be able to get it on the release day, it might take you a year or two."
2007scape,3dxkr8,Insane212,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with it is that the achievement cape is the pinnacle of difficulty.  If/when I ever get one, it will represent probably a good couple thousand hours of work.  It's far and away the hardest thing to obtain in the game.    THEN this new cape comes along as a reward for unlocking all music tracks, and we're told that to trim it you must have the Achievement Diary cape.  This makes the music cape (t) the new hardest thing in the game to get.  And that's crazy to me.   I don't know how long it takes to walk around and unlock all music tracks, but I do know that it pales in comparison to the Achievement Diary Cape.  Now let's say I finally finish this multi year project of getting an achievement cape, and during that time I made sure to grab the holiday music tracks, so here I am with my green and white representation of thousands of hours of work, and I can go spend a couple more picking up the Music Cape (t). Now the Music Cape (t) is undeniably the most prestigious item in the game, but only because it requires the Achievement Diary Cape.  The time investment for a music cape (t) is about 99% achievement cape, and 1% music cape, if I'm being generous.    Can you understand why it seems insane that the achievement cape trims the music cape?  That all that work amounts to some black lines on a different cape?  The Achievement Diary Cape deserves to be the hardest cape to obtain, and the music cape certainly does not.  It's like if you required specifically 99 slayer in order to trim the cooking cape.  Yeah, technically that Cooking Cape (t) would be more prestigious than your slayer cape, but it'd be ridiculous that the cooking icon is sitting in the middle, while 99 slayer is represented only in some additional red dye around the edges.    tl;dr (but please read the whole thing) I feel that the Achievement Diary Cape is trivialized if it just becomes the trim on an infinitely easier to obtain cape, which becomes technically the hardest to achieve cape, solely because it requires the achievement cape.  The Diary cape is the source of all the difficulty, and the diary cape is what should be mainly represented on the most prestigious item in the game.   (*yes, I understand that most 3a items are rarer/more prestigious/""harder to get"", but I'm ignoring them for obvious reasons.  Technically everyone could get an Achievement Cape, but 3a is limited to the number which actually exist.)"

The diary cape is a prestigious cape, showing you are a player who has put hundreds, if not thousands of hours into your account, completing challenges and rounding out the skills of your account.  The diary cape should be the highest achievement in the game until the max cape comes out. The music cape was a way to get the air guitar emote into the game as requested by the community.  While it's a nice gimmick cape, it should not take the place of the hardest to obtain cape in the game, as it is a joke.  Obtaining every music track can be easily done by getting quest cape and then walking around to a couple different areas for the rest.  Music cape should stay trimmed with quest cape and/or skillcapes, not the hardest to obtain cape in the game.  You polled the change for Ibans staff being changed from Upgraded Ibans Staff to Ibans Staff (u), this is something that needs to be polled.  You'll see that the community thinks then.  /r"

2007scape,3dxkr8,Insane212,11,Mon Jul 20 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"My issue with this is how little credit you give the Music Cape. If you were to start a brand new account, I bet you could get a 99 like Cooking before you unlock all of the music tracks. And while the tracks don't list requirements like Quests or Diaries, that doesn’t mean they aren’t there. You not only need to walk around to get the tracks, but also need skills, quests, and luck to unlock them all. Furthermore, new music tracks are added with some updates and if the Music Cape if anything like the old Quest Cape, you will need to unlock them before you can put the cape back on.  While there is a fair bit of overlap between the Music Cape and Quest Cape, I don't think that is enough reason to consider it ""too easy"" and give it additional requirements over other capes. It doesn’t seem right to deny the Music Cape a reasonable trim requirement because it is ""too easy"" while you can get trimmed capes through easy 99s like Cooking and Fletching. I mean I don't see the Cooking Cape requiring the Runecrafting Cape to trim because it would devalue other capes; yet that is kinda what you are doing to the Music Cape...  If you still think all music tracks and a Quest Cape makes the trim to easy, do something else then. You say you don't want to use skill capes because music is not a skill, but all these capes are Capes of Accomplishment. And to be honest, that is all trim is really, showing you have do a second accomplishment. Personally, I see nothing wrong with it trimming if you have any other Cape of Accomplishment, since taking the time to go and unlock all the music tracks is as much as an accomplishment as taking the time on any skill."

It matches the 3rd Age melee armor pretty well, and so it should be a prestigious reward, regardless of the method of getting it.  If people want to complain so much about how it is obtained, change the requirements to trim it to something like:   Compose and record a new piece of music for OSRS in order to trim the Music Cape.

2007scape,3dxkr8,Scymnus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:34 2015 UTC,Its just Trim. Theres an untrimmed Music cape for players not owning a Diary cape. Is the trim really that big of a deal?
2007scape,3dxkr8,Sunstriker_Rs,3,Mon Jul 20 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Silly decision to gate it behind Achievement diary cape. Do you have the numbers on how many people have that cape?   I don't mind really, ill get both eventually but i think it's ridiculous, the other way around makes sense (Music cape to make Achievement diary cape(t) but obviously you can't do that post release)."
2007scape,3dxkr8,Sanguinary_Squirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:27:17 2015 UTC,idk how the number of people that have a diary cape is relevant.   don't think it's silly tho. makes perfect sense to me. you trim the quest cape with diary cape and music cape is the same type of thing as quest cape so ye.
2007scape,3dxkr8,yunk10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:46:10 2015 UTC,"I think trimmed music cape should require quest cape only, trimming the quest cape aswell, because quest, achievement and music are in a class of their own as they aren't skills, effectively making it possible to trim the quest cape without diaries.  I get the reasoning behind this, because one would be able to get the stats of the trimmed cape easier than before. But really though, who gets 99's for the stats of the cape?  Requiring the hardest cape to trim one* of the easiest is a bit excessive, considering the idea at first was to simply unlock all the tracks to get the trim.  Edit: Excuse the wording/sentencing and whatnot, haven't quite woken up yet."
2007scape,3dxkr8,RoopLuv,7,Mon Jul 20 11:47:07 2015 UTC,"The argument against that seems to be that the trim would be too easy, since quest cape unlocks nearly every track as it is"

Personally I'd prefer a music oriented requirement, such as using an instrument (snake charm?) in each area of a map and playing a small part of the tune correctly until an NPC appears (musical Uri) letting you know you did it correctly.   This would require dev blogs, polls, dev time and possibly new music tracks."

If i'm working for aesthetics, they need to be in line with other aesthetics of a difficulty. Adventuring the game, completing every quest, and playing every minigame to 100% unlock every music track is already quite a substantial chore, taking longer to complete than half the 99's in the game. I really feel you're over weighing the value of this cape, and undermining the effort of players who've achieved the diary cape. My 2 cents."

Why does every new update have to cater to top tier players? What the hell is wrong with one cape being easier to get? It will be less prestigious and that's fine. It would be a nice goal for mid-level/casual players instead of just another thing we don't have time to accomplish (like the Diary cape, which it will basically represent. We already have a cape for that. Why do the Diaries also need to be showcased in the trim for the Quest and music capes?)  I dislike this idea also because it's inconsistent with how Skillcapes work as of now. Any skill can trim any other skillcape, regardless of that skill's relative difficulty or time commitment. It should be the same with these ""adventuring"" capes. Requiring the Diary cape to trim any of them is like requiring a Slayer cape to trim any other skillcape..."

2007scape,3dyptl,csisdank,2,Mon Jul 20 17:23:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the noob question, but what's going on in the picture? I see 183k magic XP, does crystal math labs update this every hour or something?"
2007scape,3dyptl,Silly_goosed,4,Tue Jul 21 00:44:57 2015 UTC,He has gained 0 exp in a lot of skill yet has gained a lot of ranks. That can only mean that some accounts higher ranked than him were banned. Most impressive number is 637 ranks gained in hunter.
2007scape,3dyptl,Audaxx,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"Oh shit that makes sense, thanks man :)!"
2007scape,3dyptl,Silly_goosed,4,Tue Jul 21 01:24:58 2015 UTC,"Basically Mod Weath is back banning bots, whenever you gain ranks without gaining experience it means an account has been banned and removed from hiscores resulting in free ranks.  Crystalmathlabs is a website that tracks experience gained."
2007scape,3dyptl,funnyf,-4,Tue Jul 21 01:35:59 2015 UTC,Splashing 24/7   Absolutely disgusting.
2007scape,3dyptl,hdb444508,-5,Mon Jul 20 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"I know right, they ban people for autoclicking high alchemy but this is okay."

2007scape,3dyptl,hdb444508,5,Tue Jul 21 01:09:23 2015 UTC,"Technically, he isn't macroing at all when he splashes, autoclicking alchemy on the other hand is a form of macro."
2007scape,3dyptl,UGSim,18,Mon Jul 20 18:25:54 2015 UTC,thanks for restating my comment man
2007scape,3dyptl,Rayban_1995,0,Mon Jul 20 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"If you didn't make it sound completely sarcastic with the question marks, I wouldn't have made a comment."

2007scape,3dyptl,Incodite,6,Tue Jul 21 08:23:19 2015 UTC,Don't question Mark. He's done nothing wrong.
2007scape,3e2uya,Markanaya,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Toadflax - 1,740 * 218 =  379,320 Grimy Snapdragon - 3,660 * 26 = 165,360 Grimy Lantadyme - 1,130 * 176 = 198,880 Grimy Dwarf weed - 1,680 * 156 = 262,080 Grimy Cadantine - 1,660 * 216 = 358,560 Irit - 870 * 151 = 131,370 Avantoe - 1,650 * 127 = 209,550 Cash - 335,000  It's too much work to calculate the rest, but that there is enough for a bond.

2007scape,3e2uya,tom2727,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking it was close but I had a hard time figuring which herbs were which.  Nothing else screamed easy cash.

It may be a setting you have to turn on, hopefully someone else can give a bit more information."
2007scape,3e2uya,RockLobster17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:28 2015 UTC,You need OSBuddy Pro for the bank value.
2007scape,3e2uya,Jackz0r92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay cool. Well in my opinion, even  for casual players, os buddy is a fantastic investment."
2007scape,3e2uya,rsb_matt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:51 2015 UTC,I use OSBuddy but I'm not seeing that option anywhere. Maybe it's Pro only?
