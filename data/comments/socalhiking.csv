socalhiking,3dwkjb,chuckq4yoo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:18:12 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly no where, since many trails will likely be closed after two days of pretty decent rain?  You'll probably have to check with the local rangers who oversee whatever trail you're thinking of."
socalhiking,3dwkjb,IAmTheWalkingDead,2,Mon Jul 20 05:05:19 2015 UTC,Crap.. true. Well if anything the day after or sometime this week is a possibility
socalhiking,3dwkjb,dima55,-3,Mon Jul 20 05:17:10 2015 UTC,Heh? Nothing will be closed.
socalhiking,3dwkjb,IAmTheWalkingDead,3,Mon Jul 20 06:26:33 2015 UTC,"Have you seriously never heard of trail closures before, after it rains? You know, because when the trails are saturated with that water and are muddy, the people in charge of maintaining the trails don't want hikers and mountain bikers and horses trudging through the mud really disrupting the composition of the trail, thereby leaving it in shit condition when things dry up?  Some trails will definitely be closed tomorrow. Across all of southern California, who knows what ones. It's all going to depend on how much rain certain areas got, what kind of usage particular trails typically get, who maintains the trails (state park rangers, local county park rangers, a city parks department, etc.), and what their assessment of the situation is.  So it's best to check with the people in charge before heading anywhere. Many agencies post trail closure notices after rains on their websites or on Twitter."
socalhiking,3dwkjb,feartrich,0,Mon Jul 20 06:37:03 2015 UTC,"Santiago Peak probably. There's also a bunch of places you can visit near where you live.  If you have time, consider Baldy or San Jacinto. Or if you really like the Chantry Flats area, then go all out and hike Mt Wilson, but that can take a while."
socalhiking,3drkmf,foukru,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:47:59 2015 UTC,"I did this one a couple years ago. IIRC, we went up the devil's backbone trail and down the ski hut trail.

socalhiking,3dmzn1,ezmass,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:34 2015 UTC,You could camp at Onion Valley and day hike the Kearsarge Pass.  The trail goes by 4 or 5 beautiful alpine lakes and you are rewarded with some amazing views from the pass.  Shorter options out of Onion Valley are Golden Trout Lake or Robinson Lake.  There are also some short hikes and cool rock formations to check out in the Alabama Hills.

socalhiking,3dgpqh,maximus321,4,Thu Jul 16 03:23:53 2015 UTC,I've camped on the summit of Baldy.  I would recommend bringing a bivy bag instead of a tent and just sleeping out in the open with all of your crap in your backpack.  It get's ridiculously windy up there.  There was nobody up there the time I did it the Saturday before Memorial Day a few years ago.  I don't think it gets very crowded because of the aforementioned high winds.
socalhiking,3dgpqh,erin_said,2,Thu Jul 16 05:35:35 2015 UTC,"i camped there this past weekend. there were maybe 10-15 people who spent the night at the summit, including the party that arrived after sunset and stayed until sunrise at 5:30. bring ear plugs, not just for wind but also people. boy scouts are out in force in the san gabriels due to SGW closing. you could try dawson peak for more solitude but you'll lack the 360 degree panorama."
socalhiking,3dgpqh,star_pilot,2,Thu Jul 16 15:33:50 2015 UTC,"I slept on the summit at the end of July last year on a Friday night. They were having one of those moonlight barbeque events at the Notch so I ate dinner there and then humped to the top, made it about midnight. There were two other guys already camped, one on the ridge heading for Dawson and the other near where the ski hut trail starts, so I staked out the biggest windbreak right next to the sign. Then promptly had to move to the second-biggest windbreak after the first one reeked of piss.  Trying to sleep on the summit was absolutely fucking miserable. I was sleeping out in a bivvy, and between the wind, the bugs, and the full moon I might have gotten ten minutes of uninterrupted rest before dawn."

socalhiking,3dgpqh,summiter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:38 2015 UTC,Will do.  Mainly curious about whether it gets crowded  up there.  Is the summit a popular camping spot?
socalhiking,3dgpqh,summiter,4,Thu Jul 16 03:49:18 2015 UTC,"Not so much 'popular' due to hard ground, high winds, lower temps, and unprotected spaces.  Most stay near the ski hut or on the ski hut trail ridge above the bowl.  On the summit there are rock igloos that shelter tents from winds - if there are any left, used to be around 7 - and those fill up quickly.  Or plan to arrive hours ahead of time and build your own.  You can camp just below the summit on the Backbone trail.  In fact, in the early 1900s when Baldy Village was the Big Bear resort of the day, they built a ""summit inn"" in that little hump.  You'll recognize it - it's a fairly flat hump dividing the final slog from Harwood to the summit.  edit:  approx here 34.288364, -117.644149"

Basically, the doubletrack stuff.  No singletrack is allowed/sanctioned.  They welcome people to hike and ride until sundown but the gates close at 6pm and if you don't plan on spending the night then you should park outside the main gate.  Original Post: I've seen people post a couple of videos on youtube re: MTB there but the word ""Preserve"" in its name normally implies that there's no MTBing.

Online permits were booked solid about a month ahead so we got up super early and were second in line for a permit. After waiting a few hours, we discovered that it's all on a lottery system, not first come first serve. We didn't end up getting our permit nor a permit for any of our other desired places. Live and learn.   Not to worry, we had a backup plan: Shepherd Pass. You're pretty much guaranteed a permit for this trail because it's a long steep slog. The trail starts at about 6k feet on the valley floor and climbs up to 12k feet at the top of the pass. Not exactly relaxing. We had three days to do it though, so it ended up being really enjoyable backpacking trip at a leisurely pace.

socalhiking,3cmn5i,Irtrogdor,2,Thu Jul 9 13:29:48 2015 UTC,They're both worthwhile goals and there are numerous ways to both peaks. The view from San Jacinto will be more dramatic with the significant relief from the Coachella Valley. My criteria would be how far of a drive is it and what are my specific interests as far as mileage and elevation gain.
socalhiking,3cmn5i,mrshatnertoyou,2,Thu Jul 9 04:23:26 2015 UTC,There are 6 free campsites near the trail head to San Jacinto and even one literally a few hundred feet from the trail head.

Have you ever checked out Thomas Mountain across the Garner Valley? There's some pretty nice yellow post sites over there, too. Not as dramatic as San Jacinto but way less busy. This was the view at my last campsite, looking towards San Jacinto. The other side looking out towards San Diego has cool views, too. On a clear day it's possible to sea the ocean."

We'll probably be spending some time exploring up here.   I will definitely put Thomas Mountain on the list.

I go up to Thomas because it's only about 35 miles from my front door to my campsite, so it's an easy escape and it's free =) It has some really nice big incense cedar trees and a very peaceful feel to it. It was fun for me to be perched up on San Jacinto and speck out my campsite on Thomas. We live in a really awesome spot on earth. So many beautiful places near by.   Enjoy your exploring!"

Also, I know it says on the website you need a fire permit for a gas camp stove but I don't think it's an issue. I was there for 4 nights last week and had a ranger drove by everyday and nobody said a word about my stove. One more thing (!) There is a spring that has been piped and on tap about 1/2 way to the camps on the same road. It was fully functional as of last weekend. I kinda ran low on water so I just drove down a bit to the spring and refilled all of my 1 gallon containers. You'll see it on your left about 3 miles in. Just past the practice rock climbing area."

Both are going to be significantly longer than Baldy, but way more enjoyable in my opinion.    If you do choose Baldy, just go out and back from the Ski Hut Trail, the fire road is not very interesting until you get to the Devils Backbone."
socalhiking,3cmn5i,staycruzin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:43:51 2015 UTC,"I've done both recently and if we're strictly speaking views from the top, then Jacinto is the winner hands down IMO. Awesome views going up and down as well.   Baldy was an awesome hike as well but the view from the top wasn't that great. However, I really enjoyed hiking through the Devil's Backbone on the way up and the Ski Hut trail on the way down. Baldy was also way more challenging I think."

Mostly, I'm curious about the logistics since their site isn't clear. I've read that the hike can go to Devil's Backbone, but from the website, it sounds like you just hike to the Top of the Notch. Or can you hike wherever you want?  And it looks like the BBQ starts early. Do people BBQ, then hike? Or hike then BBQ?   And was it crowded?  Thanks for any info! I just like going into things knowing what to expect. :)"
socalhiking,3bjqd6,fuckyeahhiking,2,Mon Jun 29 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"not OP, but from what I understand the ""sanctioned"" event portion is like a group hike up to the notch where there's food and refreshment and then people who wish often group up and continue on to the backbone/summit."

socalhiking,3bjqd6,fuckyeahhiking,2,Tue Jun 30 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"Hey! So there's really no group hike or anything. I bought tickets for a few friends and we hiked from the the ski lift parking lot, taking the fireroad up to the notch. You pick up your vouchers in the white trailer near the parking lot after showing them your printed out confirmation. We arrived at around 6:30pm-ish and made it to the Notch at around 8-ish. We had one friend who was not a seasoned hiker, so we frequently took breaks.  Once we made it to the top, we presented our meal vouchers and got to go through the buffet once. You're only allowed one pass at the buffet but they definitely load your plate up to the max, so there's no real worry about hiking down on an empty stomach. Dinner is no longer served at 9pm. After dinner, our friend group did a really short hike to Desert View where you can see the Palmdale lights behind the mountain. As we were heading back, there was another group of hikers who were heading up to the Devil's Backbone trailhead. I doubt they were trying to summit it since they didn't have tents and it was already 11pm.   You can either hike down the way you came (~45mins) or pay $12 for a ticket down the ski lift. It definitely doesn't have to be a demanding hike, but if you want to take some novice hikers out for a great meal with beautiful views, this is your place. My friend took some decent pictures and when I get home, I'll try and post them. If I forget- feel free to message me"

You'll also need an adventure pass they're $5 for just a day pass and $30 for the year I think, it's been a while and I haven't renewed mine.

socalhiking,3bdqfl,Chodi_Foster,2,Sun Jun 28 15:48:17 2015 UTC,"I've done it several times in a sedan. A few times I've had to stop partway there because the road sometimes gets washed out by rain. Most of the time it's passable, you just have to be careful with the potholes and dips. When you get to really big dips, drive across them diagonally to reduce the relative slope.  If you've done other hikes of comparable length and elevation gain, then it should be no big deal. There aren't any horrible crazy steep sections. You do have to watch out for downhill mountain bikers taking the singletrack a bit too fast. There isn't much shade in the last few miles, so wear a hat and sunscreen. There also isn't really anywhere to fill up water along the way."

When you reach old camp, there's a stream nearby that I've never seen not flowing (but I haven't been up there in two years, so YMMV).

I would recommend the grant grove area in kings canyon. That area is kind of detached from kings canyon and you really just drive straight through sequoia to get there. I went a couple weeks ago and on Saturday we didn't get to the campsite until about 4 and we were still able to find something. We stayed at azalea and it was really pretty and much more secluded than a lot of the sites in sequoia. That being said I've heard the Dorst campground is really pretty. But I think it just opened last weekend, so we couldn't go when we were there. We hiked in an area right as you got into kings canyon when you drive from sequoia. It's like two miles down a dirt road and there were sequoias all around us and we found some pretty meadows with no one else around. Hope this helps!"

I won't be around this weekend to join you, but I hope you and whoever else shows up have a great time.  A nice route to take is the Burma Road Trail and bear left at the first trail junction that you can (right after the porta potties) and follow that to the Ailor Cliff Trail.  The area next to Ailor Cliff is super steep and sandy, but really neat.  Once you get down to the bottom you should just be able to continue following the trail down hill until it hooks up with the Burma Trail again or the Peppertree Trail (I always forget which one it hooks up to) and then climb back up to the top."

I personally like going Devils backbone up and ski hut down as the least awesome part of the hike is walking the fire road and I'd rather do that in the morning when I'm stoked to be hiking rather than finishing up the past 3 miles on fire road when I'm hot and tired.

As of 2015, approximately 340 miles (550 km) of trail have been completed. When finished, the Bay Trail will extend over 500 miles (805 km) to link the shoreline of nine counties, passing through 47 cities and crossing seven toll bridges. It is a project of the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG).  The Bay Trail is a collaboration between elected officials, government agencies, private companies, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups and the public to increase access to the edge of the bay. It provides recreational opportunities for hikers and bicyclists; offers a setting for wildlife viewing and environmental education; and serves as a bicycle transportation corridor. The Bay Trail provides access to points of historic, natural and cultural interest, and to numerous recreational areas, including over 130 parks. The Bay Trail consists of paved paths, gravel trails, bike lanes or sidewalks.

I saw one guy kick someone out of an empty campsite because there was a reservation on the site - nevermind that it was 7 PM and the other person never actually showed up.

I've done it several years with no problem getting a permit.  It's the Yosemite valley that gets overly crowded during the summer.  Take a look at trails originating from Tuolome Meadows and you won't be disappointed.

socalhiking,3apxrf,StupidDrunkGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:55:01 2015 UTC,The Mountain Fire didn't burn such a popular and iconic trail though :(
socalhiking,3apxrf,feartrich,3,Tue Jun 23 01:45:18 2015 UTC,"I totally disagree. The Mountain Fire burned Saddle Junction, Skunk Cabbage, the PCT and the entire South half of the mountain. I really don't see South Fork as being more iconic than Devil's Slide. If you were a regular San Jack hiker it was a devastating blow. If you never got a chance to see Skunk Cabbage before it burned you don't know that it was home to Southern California's only high country marsh meadows and home to some of it's biggest and oldest trees. It was a little slice of the Sierras and theres really nothing else like it outside of that range anywhere near here."
socalhiking,3apxrf,tylorjams,-2,Tue Jun 23 02:17:32 2015 UTC,Seems like they just held the fire at the 38 and let it burn into the wilderness. Structures > trees $$$
socalhiking,3apxrf,scottawr,2,Tue Jun 23 07:13:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so cynical about firefighters and their methods. They make stands at highways because it's effective and it's safe. It's true that structures and human lives are always a priority over wilderness but in this particular case making a stand at the highway made perfect sense considering the fire was/is burning in an North Easterly direction toward the highway and away from the mountain. A lot of hotshots have lost their lives defending wilderness areas where there are no structures and I think they deserve a little more respect than that. Beside all that as I said before, these fires are a natural process that is critical to the health of the forest. Pulling out all the stops to stop a forest fire just stops the natural clearance of dry, dead wood and underbrush that when allowed to build up causes massive hot burning wildfires that tend to totally sterilize the ecosystem instead of low fast fires that tend to leave the older trees alive."

socalhiking,3apxrf,tylorjams,2,Tue Jun 23 01:52:44 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it will be much different. Seems like most people who day hike San G do so via Vivian already and there is a permit cap for backpackers on that trail. I think a lot of people will go elsewhere. This is why I don't really backpack in the local mountains during the summer, I'd rather get up before dawn or take a vacation day and head up to the Sierras."
socalhiking,3apxrf,StupidDrunkGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:10:04 2015 UTC,Why do people think that they are permanently closing trails? I am sure a few canyons full of trees survived.
socalhiking,3apxrf,tylorjams,4,Mon Jun 22 20:53:41 2015 UTC,"After a major fire, burnt out trees pose a significant hazard, as they are prone to fall without warning. In addition, ecosystems are fragile in those first few years after the fire. So land managers tend to close trails for recovery.   How long depends on a lot of different factors, but 5 years isn't out of the question."

Rattling lets you know where they're at.  It's the silent ones that you almost step on that are, IMHO, a bigger danger.  In San Diego I've actually seen as many rattlesnakes on pavement as I have in 10 years of hiking.  I generally hike busy trails though.

socalhiking,3aphfi,DonnieRobbs,2,Mon Jun 22 13:11:29 2015 UTC,The road going to Agnew Meadows will be open to personal vehicles so you won't have to take the tram down. The only issue you might run into is the weather. Usually the forest service closes the road to agnew meadows when the snow starts to acculmulate and they don't usually plow it in the winter. Early October should be ok but the later you go the more you risk running into stormy weather. Of course weather can be hard to predict months in advanced. Just check the weather and call the rangers about the road when it gets close to your hiking date.
socalhiking,3aphfi,mtnbikerdude,3,Mon Jun 22 20:08:49 2015 UTC,Thanks!!! So is the trail generally open provided the road is? It's not a hard and fast closure schedule but just weather dependent? I think I will stay at Mammoth Mountain and just hope for the best. If it's closed there's plenty of other options.
socalhiking,3aphfi,mtnbikerdude,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"Well the trail is open year round. I have met people that have snowshoed from the ranger checkpoint to the lakes. If the road is closed and there isn't snow, you can always hike to the lakes from the ranger checkpoint but that will add maybe 3-4 miles before getting to agnew meadows. But generally I have read the forest service closes the road mid-oct. (Although the road didnt close until Nov for 2014)  Plenty of options in the Mammoth area. Again, if it starts to snow heavily then the roads to the Mammoth Lakes will be closed (you can still hike to the lakes).   That time of the year will be very beautiful too. You will start seeing some nice fall colors on the trees."
socalhiking,3aphfi,scottawr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks again. I think my best bet is asking the rangers when I want to go. If it's a no go, then I'll find a shorter hike somewhere."

He was a long distance walker that was walking the coast from Mex to Can, with a Catalina stopover, and he had stealth-camped on Blackjack Peak the night before we met him at Blackjack campsite...  Parsons, Blackjack, and Little Harbor are all good campsites to consider if available.  That island is very rugged, actually - they aren't big on switchbacks there.  Very rewarding though."
socalhiking,3an9qx,52hikechallenge,2,Mon Jun 22 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"Both Blackjack and Parsons landing are amazing. I prefer Parsons landing because it is on the beach and close to the water. If you do go to Parsons landing make sure to bring snorkel gear because there is tons of stuff to see just off shore. Also you can do day hikes around Parson's in which we found a few buffalo ""nest"" which was exciting. We only saw 2 actual buffalo though."

Car camping tends to be noisy and filled with people, but the gear is inexpensive but ""heavy"".    If you go backpacking, you're generally away from the crowds and the noise. You hike in X miles and you can camp anywhere that is flat. The downside to this is, the lighter gear you buy, the more expensive it is.  I've done a lot of solo trips, and I've met some great people. Some of them I exchanged numbers with and we go on day hikes and backpack together. If you take the backpacking route, I can help you with gear and few trails to hit up, or even company you on some trips."
socalhiking,3akc2l,shawntran90,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"Solid general rundown and agree with everything. I just want to add some of my opinions. I'd say start with car camping. Borrow as much equipment as you can (maybe your family has some still) and hit up a site most likely a public one because they're cheaper/free. See if you like it. Serious. I've brought some people, and they just could not handle it whether it was bugs or running out of cigs; some people just don't like camping. After, if backpacking sounds appealing, then there are plenty of resources here on reddit; but my two cents would be to hike first. Start with short, well-established trails and work your way to longer, wilderness trails while slowly adding weight to carry. I dredged up some old knee injuries trying to backpack right off the bat and I regret not taking my time. Anyways, I'm sorry to hear about your friends, but pretty much all of the outdoorsy people I meet are super nice and friendly and it kind of rubs off on you which makes you appreciate the community.

socalhiking,3ah6he,I_want_candyy,2,Sun Jun 21 03:53:57 2015 UTC,"I was just there last weekend, if you want seclusion, but still want to be in a campground it's pretty nice in the grant grove area in Kings Canyon. We stayed at Azalea and it wasn't too bad. There were definitely people around but it was nothing like what we drove though while coming up through sequoia. Plus there are still groves of sequoias around. I've heard Dorst Creek is a really nice area and is just opening this weekend. So we didn't get to see it when we were there. Good luck! And make sure you get there early to reserve a place if you're staying at a campground!"
socalhiking,3ah6he,I_want_candyy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:52:55 2015 UTC,Azalea looks really cool. Did it offer scenic mountain views?
socalhiking,3ah6he,Existanai,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:59:27 2015 UTC,From our spot we couldn't see mountains. I'm not entirely sure about the other parts of the campground though. We did find some big rocks to climb on to of and watch the sunset from so that was cool.
socalhiking,3ah6he,bassheadjones,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:20:42 2015 UTC,aww okay I'm trying to find some mountain views or something! thanks for the suggestion though
socalhiking,3ah6he,bdsmchs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:06:25 2015 UTC,"I've stayed at Azalea in a beautiful spot with boulders. We walked down the hill from our site to a creek, continued up to a hill with nice views. You might be hard-pressed to find a first-come first-served spot in the National Park in the summer that has an ideal scenic view."
socalhiking,3ah6he,Flatline42,2,Sun Jun 21 09:01:49 2015 UTC,"If you want to be near sequoia and kings canyon parks, camp in the national forest between them. There is a campground just off the General's Highway called Big Meadow. The sites are first come first served, and I rarely ever see anyone camped there. Aim for the last campground (there are 4 I think), which is right next to the creek and just before a bridge.   I used to make my parents take me to that creek every year when I was a kid to slide on the rocks.  It is where I would go if I couldn't go to Lodgepole or Stony Creek."
socalhiking,3ah6he,tuhtuhtuhtyler,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, skip the park and hit up sequoia national forest instead. It's closer and has way less people. There are tons more camping opportunities as well, and still groves of sequoias to check out."

Got a ton of great photos and underwater video, definitely going again this year!"
socalhiking,3adn83,TheLordSnod,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:38:03 2015 UTC,Thats awesome! The second day we were at Gibraltar we kayaked down to lava wall to go check out the sea caves. It was great! We didn't stay too long b/c a couple of people were tired from kayaking all the way to our camp spot the day before and wanted to get back to  our campsite to relax and drink some more.  Good call on paddling back to two harbors to get more water and beer. Did you and your friend have any trouble with loading up gear/water/food? Everyone in our party had a single kayak but it still felt like we overloaded our kayaks even though we did use all items we brought out with us. Thanks for posting!
socalhiking,3adn83,TheLordSnod,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"We were pretty packed down with gear. Filled both storage hills on my kayak with everything but I had a huge dry bag with my sleeping bag and clothes that I strapped to the back of the kayak on top.  We each basically had a large hiking backpack, a second regular sized back pack, and a large dry bag, plus about 4 gallons of water and a 12 pack.  That lasted for the first Two nights.  Probably could have lasted us the whole trip but we wanted more beer so the trip to two harbors was worth it haha, plus we got to see some cools stuff when we went there too"

Cleveland NF is a big place - really depends where you go: Palomar or Mt Laguna are very nice spots but they are both way down in San Diego county requiring a longer drive. IF you don't mind the drive, its definitely worth it - these areas both have very unique micro-climates for SoCal: Palomar is pretty lush as it gets more rain than anywhere around here and Laguna is a huge alpine meadow area, up on a mountain that overlooks the desert.  San Gorgonio is wilderness area - you'd have to hike in to the woodsy campsites and the ones on the edge of the Wilderness area are all along a busy highway so they tend to attract a lot of RVs with noisy generators. It not all that bad and if you prefer a shorter drive I'd head up to that area."
socalhiking,39yif1,nem0nem,3,Mon Jun 15 21:22:50 2015 UTC,"I wanted to add that San Gorgonio is kind of strict, you can't have fires and I believe requires a permit."

As far as Cleveland, I was thinking more North towards Palomar than Laguna, maybe even Dripping Springs in the Agua Tabia Wilderness. But looking at the drives it doesn't seem like it makes as much of a difference as I thought where in the forest I go, same 3.5 hours ish. So maybe we'll just bite the bullet and take the drive.   And San Gorgonio still seems like an option... hmmm decisions decisions"

I also filled my 3L hydration pack of BCAA water mix, along with 1.5L of regular water in a nalgene. I think I only drank 3.5L of my water for the entire hike.

Took Fire Road 3N02 to the junction with the PCT headed towards Cooper Canyon. Took that trail for about a half mile. At the saddle of the trail around Point 6903 we thought, what the hell...let's tackle 6903. Good god did it kick my ass. Just brutal. The hike down the Northwest Side wasn't any better. Picked up the ridgeline and followed it to Point 7003. Had lunch there. On the way back, we took the North side route around 6903. Much better. At the junction with 3N02 and the PCT, we took the PCT.

You do need a permit which you can get by searching mill creek ranger station. You definitely want to cut weight in your pack. Take at least 4 liters of water good emergency supplies and rain shell. I'll be doing San Gorgonio via south fork trailhead this Saturday @22 miles and my favorite way up is aspen grove @25 both trails I do as day hikes, but I'm a slow (relative I know)  and steady hiker with a couple years experience doing these hikes."

It's a good 20+ mile day so it's certainly lengthy but people day hike it regularly. My advice would be to cut down your pack weight tremendously. 35lb is absurdly heavy for a day pack. You'll gain and lose a mile of vertical distance going up and down and it's a killer on the knees. All you should need is water, food, rain gear and emergency supplies. 5-10lbs tops.

socalhiking,39f2tu,hotdogfever,2,Thu Jun 11 08:40:24 2015 UTC,"It certainly has hints of a tilt-shift - a narrow depth of field isn't common at this sort of distance. But other than that tree in the extreme foreground, the entire image is about equally focused which is what you'd expect. My hunch is a long exposure time that caught smaller movements of close object and not the same movements on objects that were farther away.  Alternatively, it could be a very long lens focused near infinity which throws trees nearby out of focus.  It's hard to say without the metadata.  Regardless, this is a great shot that offers a unique perspective on a familiar object."

I'm deterred in that many of these apps/sites are 'reinventing the wheel'.  To make me use something it needs to be very non-intrusive and easy to use - an extension of my planning and not a separate process.  Here would be my requirements: Search an area around a GPS point, via online mapping software.  Select the route I completed and fill out a brief, <10 question survey for my specific trip.  Alternatively, if I want to plot more data, I want an app that tracks in real-time (MyTracks is similar but leaves a lot on the table): Start the app, start a new trip log... GPS plotting automatically assigns my route to one already in the database so route description, route length, elevation, etc. are pre-populated.  The app would reference point-specific weather sources (NOAA) and auto-populate my trip with correct temp/precipitation/wind/etc.  When it uploads to your online server(s) a brief survey of less than ten questions to pull trip-specific user experience:  sample questions: how were the trail conditions () clear () washed out () overgrown () ... was there snow cover?  () yes () no () some were natural water sources available?  () yes ()no () some how many people were on the trail?  () none  () few  () popular  () crowded are there animal/fire/conditional warnings in effect (select all that apply)?

[] parking permit required [] backpacking stove permit required [] overnight camping permit required [] wilderness permit required [] ... any new developments (optional)? [ [ [ ""text box"" [ [    From the pre-formatted questions, users should be able to use the app's search feature to filter on - in addition to the common criteria - routes that have, say, no snow cover... or water sources recently available... or filter out routes that have animal warnings."

socalhiking,396z28,sts24,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"The only day hike you can do without a Whitney Zone permit is to hike the Whitney main trail as far as Lone Pine Lake.  That's about a 6 mile round trip.  If you can snag an unclaimed day use permit from the Lone Pine Visitor Center, I would suggest hiking as far as Bighorn Park.  It's quite pretty and not that much farther than Lone Pine Lake.  The campgrounds at the Portal are nice and the canyon it's located in is pretty.  The trailhead area attracts a crowd on summer weekends though.  Just something to keep in mind."
socalhiking,396z28,uscmissinglink,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"I think you can also do the Boy Scout Lakes via the Portal area (you just take the Mountaineers Trail instead of the Whitney Trail. The fork is about a mile from the portal.  EDIT: Looks like only Lower Boys Scout Lake is doable without a permit. Let me take this opportunity, though, to point out that the day permits are actually not terribly hard to get if you wanted to venture into the Whitney Zone. The ranger told me that, as long as you have a small group, you have a very good chance of getting a permit as a walk-up (and for free) almost all year."
socalhiking,396z28,tiredofpegging,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"Lower Boy Scout lake can be reached via North Fork of Lone Pine Creek, and it is outside the Whitney Zone, but I would hesitate to call that a real trail.  Edit:  For anyone that reads this and gets an idea that the North Fork to Lower Boy Scout sounds ""doable"", please Google search ""Ebersbacher Ledges"" and know what you're signing up for."
socalhiking,396z28,uscmissinglink,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"You can still hike up the trail quite a ways without a permit. I don't recall how far exactly, but at least to the first lake.   Beyond that I think you need to go elsewhere. There's horseshoe meadows not far to the south of Lone Pine which is a great spot for hiking and gives you that high elevation experience as well."

A giant horseshoe shaped meadow with a ""beach"" of course sand and a ""lake"" of sage and a little stream meandering through. Lots of different hikes there, and only a little south of the Portal in the Eastern Sierras (you get there via a side rode off of Whitney Portal Road).  I was there 8/30. Here's a picture."
socalhiking,396z28,socalpilot7,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"You can do the Meysan Lakes trail which goes around the other way.  From there you can climb Lone Pine Peak and a few other peaks.  No permit for day hiking, but you will need a permit to camp up there but they are easy to get.  I went up there the day before I did my first Whitney trip.  It was pretty cool, very low key for the area."

socalhiking,393wq5,oildig,2,Tue Jun 9 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool that you guys could make that connection.    Just curious though, why do you sign summit registers?  I used to feel strangely compelled to sign them, but then at some point I realized that I don't care whether anybody knows (or believes) that I was ever there, so I stopped signing them.  Is it because you enjoy reading through them and want to contribute?  Or is it just to document your accomplishment?"
socalhiking,393wq5,oildig,3,Tue Jun 9 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"I like to sign registers for a few reasons. First off, they're a collection of local mountain history, sometimes dating back many decades (even further on remote peaks). I like adding to this tradition and reading the entries.  Secondly its an added layer of safety. If I'm lost on the mountain, there will be some sort of record of where I planned on going and the conditions that day.   Also I love that the registers aren't owned by any organization. they just pop up organically and everyone for the most part seems to respect them."

socalhiking,38zdlr,Oldpenguinhunter,2,Mon Jun 8 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, about 1/4 mile before the bridge.  Basically, you want to follow the trail until you start gaining elevation to go up to the bridge.  At that point just stick to the river.  The little stream that flows into the San Gabriel is on the left hand side of the river.  It may not be flowing now because of the drought, but its a pretty sweet little gulch covered in moss with a fig tree in there.  There's a pool about 18-24"" deep with a 45'-55' water fall dumping into it.  You can climb to the top, but it can be a bit sketchy.  There's remnants of an old rock cabin there as well, probably left over from when they were building the bridge."

Not exactly a hiking trail, but the trail network there has a lot of nice scenery through the wetlands. There are more hiking opportunities in the hills (Aliso/Wood canyon, for example) if you want some uphill. Keep in mind that Southern California is almost a desert so trails are either beach/wetland or sagebrushy/coastal woodland that is generally pretty dry and exposed. If you're up for a day trip, the Angeles forest has some nice trails that are more mountainy and more similar to what you would find in the Sierra."
socalhiking,38zf3o,VesperStorm,5,Mon Jun 8 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"You could do San Jacinto. Given enough time, just about anyone could.  But depending on your expectations, it could ruin you for hiking. San Jacinto is steep and high, which means you're dealing with endurance and thinner air. In other words, what may be a fun hike for experienced hikers, may be possible, but miserable for a new hiker.  If you're the sort of person that needs to and likes to train for a main event, find some training mountains. Here are four suggestions. Just pick the peaks that come before San J.  If you're just interested in hiking, in general, understand that it's not always about elevation or elevation gain. Hiking, for a lot of people, is about getting outside and away from the traffic of the 405.  TL/DR: Don't set yourself up for failure by starting with the hard stuff. Unless that's your thing, in which case, you can totally do it so get going."

You think my endurance is there or keep training a bit more in your opinion?"
socalhiking,38zf3o,seaoframen,2,Mon Jun 8 05:19:38 2015 UTC,"Flat land endurance is different from mountain endurance, so the best way to train is to hit the trails.  Choose a trail that looks interesting to you and go!  A word about elevation though.  If you've never hiked at altitude before, more specifically if you have never hiked above 9000 feet before, it would help to know the basics of altitude sickness - how to spot it, what to do if you get it, how to avoid it.  Most people seem to be fine up to 10,000 feet, but I've seen a few guys get hit pretty bad at 9000 feet and each time it was made worse by their not understanding what was happening to them."

socalhiking,38zf3o,festafiesta,2,Mon Jun 8 04:20:59 2015 UTC,It's one of the most difficult trails in the entire country. It requires lots of training on similar steep hikes and proper planning.

It's a paved road all the way up the lower ski lift station, assuming that's where you're starting from, so no, it's no different than most other mountain roads. Don't know if there's still snow up there at this time of the year.  If there is, and you fall, you could die.  If there isn't, and weather changes when you're not prepared for it, you could die.

If you drive a semi, yes. If you drive a car, not bad at all, just a little curvy. 3.) Water, water, water. It's starting to get hotter (if you hike mid day) and it's a decent hike. You can certainly dehydrate out there.

That one has most of the plants on there and nice color pictures. Plus it is a field guide so easy to carry around.   There is the ""Flora of the Santa Ana River and Environs With References to World Botany"" which is a guide for plants in the Santa Ana River watershed.   And if you wanna use an online guide check out http://www.calflora.org This is a very comprehensive site that has pretty much all native and invasive plays in CA. It has a handy ""what grows here"" feature where you can click on an area and it will give you a list of plants that grow in the area. It's useful for when you don't know what the plant was but you have a picture of it.   Edit: Whoops, my guides were for plants. Forgot that you wanted biomes and animals. But I believe the National Audubon society has those books too."

'Nature Guide to the Mountains of Southern California by Car and on Foot' is very 80's and not huge on detail but nicely focused. 'Flora of the Santa Ana River and Environs' is more regionally restricted but by far the prettiest and most detailed plant identifier I know for here.  For edibles, there are a few but 'Edible and Useful Plants of California' is the one I have that looks best. Also 'Temalpakh' (Cahuilla plant usage) is very cool for historical interest, but I wouldn't try eating these without a lot more research."

What you are implying is that there is a mass governmental conspiracy to collect fees and secretly keep them instead of using them appropriately. Really? Come on.    However, apparently I had nothing better to do with my time on a Saturday morning than prove someone was wrong on the internet. I'll link you a document you can peruse on your own, but I'll quote ONE page that is examples of the projects the money went towards:     In partnership with the NPS, the Public Land Corps matched $4 million in Fee Demo  revenue with labor from its youth work partners to complete 223 projects focused  primarily on deferred maintenance.  • The main sewer line at Bandelier National Monument was rehabilitated to prevent water  pollution. Failure to correct the sewer line problems could have resulted in closure of all  the visitor use facilities by the New Mexico State Water Quality Division.  • Haleakala National Park replaced the House of the Sun Visitor Center comfort station  and water/sewer systems because they did not meet State of Hawaii health and safety  regulations. The new wastewater system, water system and comfort station have reduced  maintenance by eliminating water hauling.  • Fee Demo revenues helped pay for rehabilitating the parking lot and restrooms at the  Panoramic Point day-use area at Sequoia Kings Canyon National Park. Additional  amenities were also installed, including a split rail fence around the perimeter to establish  foot traffic patterns, replacement of deteriorated bear-proof trashcans and food storage  containers, and the addition of recycling bins.  • Fee Demo revenues helped to fund the REDStart fish hatchery on the FWS’s J.N. “Ding”  Darling National Wildlife Refuge by providing tanks and filtration equipment to farm  mosquito larvae-eating fish. The REDStart program is a partnership with Lee County  Seagrant, Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation Marine Laboratory, Mote Marine  Lab, South Florida Water Management District, and the State of Florida. The refuge uses  fish produced at the hatchery in wetland areas to help control mosquito populations in  high-use areas on the refuge.  • The Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge used Fee Demo revenues to help purchase  five remote controls for opening and closing solar-powered gates at the entrance to  Brown Canyon; replace a water purification system at the captive breeding facility for the  endangered masked bobwhite quail; acquire a new refuge entrance sign and other signs;  and fund annual maintenance at the Environmental Education Center, the Ray Harm  House (a visitor contact station with live-in volunteers) and La Casita, a cottage used by  educators, nature writers, and photographers.  • At BLM’s Painted Rocks Petroglyphs site, Fee Demo revenues helped resurface the  access road, two camping loop roads, and 60 campsites. Sixty new picnic tables and fire  rings were also purchased and installed.  • At BLM’s Milner Historic/Recreation Area, Fee Demo revenues were used to replace all  of the boat docks and improve access to the Snake River.  • Fee revenues allowed the USDA FS to provide more frequent, higher quality services and  safer conditions than could be provided without Fee Demo revenues. Some typical  examples include: maintaining 465 miles of trail on the Deschutes National Forest;  replacing 8 picnic tables, 40 fire rings with grills, and 1 water tank on the Klamath  National Forest; removing hazardous trees from Owl Creek horse trail on the National  Forests of Alabama; extinguishing over 8,000 abandoned campfires"

For instance, I had my wife book me a room in Mammoth 3 days before I arrived at Devil's Postpile and then send me the info I needed to know where I was staying (there was a festival in town so hotels would have been very hard to find the day of). Several people actually paid me to send texts on their behalf to their family as well!

Look into any of the 406mhz PLBs from ACR , etc. No subscription required and your beacon message goes directly to the COSPAS-SARSAT network from literally anywhere in the world.  The subscription based services only work in defined areas and they'll ignore your emergency if you haven't paid your bill.  I've carried an ACR microfix since 2006 (a stipulation from my wife if I was going to hike solo). Weighs very little, waterproof, and even floats.  Edit: wtf autocorrect, paid =Odis?"
socalhiking,38jrib,FirstNameAsALast,2,Fri Jun 5 04:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't found one without a subscription, unfortunately. Makes sense if you think about it though, as it's a similar concept to a cell phone.  If you know you're going to want to use it year round, the spot might be cheaper. The inreach allows you to go month by month."
socalhiking,38jrib,cmonster_75,3,Thu Jun 4 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"If you want a GPS beacon, I recommend against the ones that work on a commercial network (like spot). Look at ACR beacons. They are ""true"" personal locator beacons, which alert NOAA to your location, who then alerts the appropriate agency to go rescue you (coast guard, air force, navy, some foreign government agency, etc).  Spot is basically like ADT home security... It phones some guy who works for the company who picks up the phone and calls the police."
socalhiking,38jrib,Herbie555,2,Thu Jun 4 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"Spot/DeLorme has a few features that the ACR beacons don't. Basically the ACR beacon is a ""OMG COME SAVE ME"" SOS beacon. If I don't need half the state's SAR people searching for me the DeLorme will let me communicate directly with the ranger station.   On the flip side the beacons do emit a homing signal for faster response times.  Spot is smaller, has replacable batteries (which might be a plus for you) and generally a pretty good battery life. But it's expensive as all hell (150 a year base) and only a yearly subscription. If you shop around and/or hit REI during one of their big sales you can pick up a Delorme for about 50 bucks more than the spot and have a lot more options IMHO."

When I go out, I always let my wife know where I'm parking and riding/hiking. If it's a multi day backpacking trip I'll leave a printed map of my planned route (caltopo is great for these). Sometimes I've left a note on my dashboard saying where I'm going and when I plan to return, more so in the remote areas and I just make sure there's nothing valuable in the car.

As for general hiking tips for SoCal... carry water. Maybe a whistle if you're worried about getting lost. Most of our trails are well marked and well used."
socalhiking,38j622,Raptor01,8,Thu Jun 4 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"I would add that if possible, snap a picture of the snake to help identify the species.   Also, the snake bite kits on the market you see today, usually cause more tissue damage than help. Using a tourniquet is now usually frowned upon as it leaves the venom in one place, causes swelling and could potentially cause loss of limb.   Remove any rings, jewelry as your appendages tend to swell.  Carry sharpie, and notepad. Take heart rate every 10 minutes and provide info to medical personnel.   Your primary goal when bitten by a snake is to keep your heart rate low, and immediately evac to the nearest hospital.   Have your hiking buddy call 911/hospital on the way and let them know a snake bit victim is coming in so they can prep antivenin or let you know which medical facility in the area has it on hand.

socalhiking,38eo7d,uscmissinglink,8,Wed Jun 3 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"First, huge shout out to /u/The_Xozz and /u/chickenyoyo6 who did Whitney before and provided very useful information. /r/socalhiking is a tremendous resource.  We got two nights in the lottery but the rangers at the Lone Pine station let us tag a night onto the end and recommended the peaceful and sheltered Outpost Camp for the post-summit night.  After the late snows, there was a period of more than 2 weeks during which no one was able to summit by any route. That changed on May 28 and by the time we were up there, many were making the summit.  On May 31, everyone was still using the chute, but it was very very hard. It wasn't getting cold at night and days were sunny and warm, so by noon the chute was a slushy mess. The only people coming down who said they made it to the top were the earliest we saw. By mid-afternoon, people were coming down with reports that it took 6 hours to get up the chute, they turned around and took 6 hours to get back down. No summits.  So we decided to start early the next day (4AM). Very happy with that decision. Snow was hard and we got up the chute in the expected 2 hours. The sun rose at the very end and the snow immediately started to soften.  Rest of the trail was snow-covered. Crampons were helpful. We summitted around 8:30.  Shortly after we arrived, a young man from Colorado Springs showed up in running gear and tennis shoes. He had run from Whitney Portal in 3 hours and 30 minutes - achieving Trail Crest via the switchbacks. He was the first to use the switchbacks that I know of and he did it in tennis shoes. We heard many others were trying that route and saw one group make it past the cables (but not without a fair amount of slipping).  We got back to the chute around 11 am and opted to go with the devil we knew. Snow was extremely soft and slippery. Kick-stepped the first third down and then glissaded.  Snow was melting fast. People are doing the switchbacks and I expect them to be pretty good within the week. Crampons and ice axe were nice to have, but people were making it with hiking poles and regular shoes. Still with the snow, I'd put the success rate from Trail Camp at about 50%."

socalhiking,38eo7d,influenzaremix,2,Wed Jun 3 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"I was surprised by how easy the leftover permits were to get. For all the pomp and circumstance around the permit reservation system, the ranger I spoke with told me that for a small group, there were only two days last year that he had to turn someone away. Oh, and also that the permits are free and the price we pay is for the reservation."
socalhiking,38eo7d,CA_Jim,3,Wed Jun 3 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"Awesome trip! And amazing photos! What did you do to train for the hike? What's next?!  Just one note for others: Glissading that chute can be pretty dangerous. I mean a lot of people make it down successfully, but that section is where I've seen the most reports of people dying and getting paralyzed after losing control while sliding. I would definitely not try it without an ice axe! It doesn't take that much longer to post hole your way down. I'm very happy you made it fine though OP!"
socalhiking,38eo7d,theuncleiroh,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"We had very little notice between when the lottery happened and our hike date, so our training was compressed. We did the back end of the Six Pack - Baldy, San J, San G (overnight).  As for what's next... I'm up for suggestions. What do you think? Maybe a Colorado 14er?  As for your note on Glissading, I echo this. It was actually my first time doing it, and we would certainly have post holed down, except someone slid by us. At this point the snow was so soft that you barely needed an ice axe. Your rump sank several inches and before 10 feet, you were pushing a huge pile of sticky snow in front of you. It acted like a natural brake. If the snow had been harder or more slippery I definitely wouldn't have done it. And the ice axe was key for maintaining control."
socalhiking,38eo7d,Providang,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"How long of a break did you take between Baldy, San J, and San G? Just curious about the theory behind the training."
socalhiking,38eo7d,Dwdavid89,3,Thu Jun 4 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"We went every other week: Baldy 4/18, San J 5/2, and San G 5/16-5/17. Did a little running in between to maintain VO2 Max from an early April Ragnar relay race and shorter day hikes in off-weeks - usually with our kids in backpacks for pack training.  For what it's worth, I've found that once you achieve a certain level of fitness, training becomes largely a question of psychology. You have to think you can do the thing. Since we didn't have time to do a huge training program, I designed the training around mental preparation. Baldy and San J for steepness. San G for distance and a backpacking rehearsal. Put it all together and we eagerly took the hardest step on any endurance test: the first."

The Old Baldy Trail from Bear Flat is still technically closed, North Backbone and Register Ridge aren't beginners routes, and I have always found the fireroad to the Devils Backbone to be unbearably dull.  The Ski Hut Trail is tough, but it's a relatively safe three seasons hike.  It's one of the first hikes I did when I wanted to get more serious about hiking.  It kicked my ass, but it was still a fun experience.  Just make sure you take a map, enough water, and the confidence to know when to turn around."

It's also more crowded, not that Ski Hut doesn't get a lot of traffic.  Icehouse to the saddle is a good hike by itself, or you could keep hiking to either Cucamonga, Ontario, or Timber Peak which are all reachable from the saddle.    If you want a challenge, you could hike from Icehouse Canyon to Timber to Baldy in a long semi-loop and hitch a ride down to Icehouse from Manker."

socalhiking,38e2j1,fuckyeahhiking,2,Wed Jun 3 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't done this trail at night, but I have done other hikes starting around midnight and found them to be very enjoyable. It's a much quieter experience than the daytime. This is a well traveled trail and I've heard of many people hiking up for the sunrise. I've started at 4am (from Tenaya Lakes) and 5am (from Happy Isles). This left plenty of time to get up there by late morning and avoid much of the rush of the low fitness late risers. Only you know your own limits, but I would advise to do some hiking in the days leading up to the big hike just to get the legs moving. Three days should be plenty of recovery for anyone in decent shape, so I say go for it.   Advice:   Bring gloves for the cables Bring a can of beer for the summit (so good!) Sunscreen, water, food, dress in layers (standard stuff) Make sure your shoes have lots of grip, some of the granite on the cables is well worn and a bit slippery. The cables may look scary, but go at them with confidence!"

We'll be departing from Happy Isles - good to know that if we don't go the middle-of-the-night route, we should still have a pleasant experience even if we depart a little later than originally planned.

socalhiking,38e2j1,rockenreno,2,Wed Jun 3 17:06:30 2015 UTC,I've only seen bears on the trails twice. Both times during the day.

socalhiking,38e2j1,FirstNameAsALast,2,Wed Jun 3 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"I have hiked it at night and the trail is pretty easy to follow even at night.  The only spot you could maybe make a wrong turn is at the Clark Point turnoff after Vernal Fall.  Other parts of the trail are well marked and easy to follow.  I say leave at midnight.  Take a map and you should be fine.  Regarding the cables, be sure to take leather palm work gloves. They really help on the descent.   Regarding Panorama, three days should be plenty rest.  If you are prone to soreness, take three Advil after Half Dome.  It really helps."
socalhiking,38e2j1,Status_Faction,2,Wed Jun 3 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"If you want to do the Panorama Trail, you can take the Glacier Point shuttle ($25 one way, leaves at like 8am or something) then hike to Half Dome and down the Mist Trail past Nevada and Vernal falls. I tried to climb half dome when it was wet and it was way too sketchy. It really is quite steep. I'll use a climbing harness with clip in carabiners the next time i do it."

Even if it is the most popular hike in Los Angeles, with a lot of people and dogs on it, it is still a place to go up/downhill on a trail in a relatively natural environment. Maybe, just maybe, if we encourage people who enjoy Runyon rather than bringing them down, we could get more public (and monetary) support for all hikes and natural places in and around Los Angeles."

I just find them more comfortable. Quick dry pants just never seem to fit quite right & the zipper (if convertible) & waistline are always too tight & annoying, & they're not stretchy. I'd rather have my yoga pants be a little sweaty & I've never had any irritation from them. As far as long sleeves, I just can't stand them if it's over like 65 degrees. Again, just personal preference. Of course it'd be better to wear long sleeves for Sun protection but I just hate it so I wear a tank top & lots of sunscreen."

Bonus: I'm not allergic to poison ivy or oak, so no need to worry about any exposed leg irritation!

socalhiking,37fudx,Somedamnusername,3,Thu May 28 01:32:39 2015 UTC,"I live in Ojai, one of the better hiking trails would be Rose Valley. There's not a lot of water there at the moment but there is some. It's very overcast and cool today, so I don't imagine tomorrow being too much warmer. Should be great hiking weather!"
socalhiking,37fudx,disobedientwhale,1 point,Wed May 27 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"I've camped at Wheeler Gorge before. It's a nice campground. This early it the year I imagine there would still be some water in the streams. The friends I usually go with aren't big hikers, do I can't really speak to trails in the area. I know you can hike along Sesape Creek but it's a drive from Wheeler Gorge."

It is right off the highway coming into Ojai valley from the east so its not the most secluded but the views of surrounding valley and mountains are pretty scenic - you can pitch a tent right next to your car if you like.  For trails, check out: http://venturacountytrails.org/index.html. There are also some newer trails built by the Ojai Valley Land Conservancy that don't show up on newer maps http://ovlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2014-Valley-View-Map-Web.pdf  I think all the trails are steep, rocky and very little shade so its not the best place for hiking when its hot out; I rode my bike up to Nordhoff Peak and got fried."

socalhiking,37fudx,littlebeanonwheels,1 point,Thu May 28 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"I love Middle Lion campground. If you continue up the 33 and turn onto Rose Valley Road and take it to the very end it should be right there. Its very peaceful, and I haven't seen it too crowded before. There should be a stream as well but I am not sure how much water would be there right now.   Yes, you can pull your car right up to the site, yes there are fire pits, and there is a trail head that begins at the campground, though I do not know exactly which one it is. I would recommend stopping by the ranger station off the 33 to pick up a trail map so that you can choose which one would suit you best.   Also its pretty much free! All you need is an adventure pass for each day that you plan to be there (which you can get at any sporting good store in the area).   Lastly, its pretty high up there so it wouldn't be as hot as the main town. (I went last year in May and the days were mild and the nights were chilly)  Happy camping!"
socalhiking,37fudx,brizzles,1 point,Thu May 28 06:36:53 2015 UTC,I took a scout troop up there in March and had to circle back to Rose Valley because Middle Lion was full.

socalhiking,37fudx,TravelMike2005,1 point,Thu May 28 08:59:41 2015 UTC,"Lower Rose Valley Falls should have some water. It's very similar to Escondido Falls in look if you've been to that one. If you're camping for one night, you could try to do Willett or Sespe Hot Springs but maybe just perusing around the Piedras Blancas trailhead would be more worth your time.

I find it to be a noisy, crowded campground with no potable water which makes life a pain in the ass. For the 30 bucks a night or whatever you're paying it's not worth it to me. There are tons of other campsites all over the place.  Sadly the LP is pretty parched during the summer most years, and this year it's surprising there's flowing water anywhere at all. But that being said, Middle Lion is an awful nice, but small, campground."

socalhiking,37faxn,scottawr,2,Thu May 28 00:41:10 2015 UTC,There are couple trails down the beach on either side of the stairs. If you never been through one you probably want to ask around or follow some surfer down the beach.

If you want to surf or boogie board it'd be pretty good but the sites are very small and cramped and you are very very close to your neighbors. We had 10 people and we had to get 3 sites to have enough space and we barely had enough. Dirt is packed down to the point that it's basically concrete.

The train also goes by there, but it stops at 10pm I think and wasn't an issue. I had very low expectation of the campsite from reading all the bad reviews, but it wasn't that bad!

socalhiking,37eewc,JCLII,5,Wed May 27 00:49:29 2015 UTC,"Don't waste your money.  You don't need it.  Snakes aren't really that big of an issue.  I'm a Midwesterner that has lived here now for more than 6 years and have actively sought out snakes, spiders, and such because I enjoy that type if thing.  Most snake's a are not venomous and those that are will let you know to stand clear.  Keep your distance from them they will keep theirs and keep in mind they are far more scared of you.    Plus snake kits have been proven not to work.  Your best bet after a bite is to stay calm to keep your heart rate low and if you know how to, a proper compression wrap and get to a hospital asap.  Thanks to the San Diego zoo you are near to one of the best equipped anti venom units in the world.  Also the larger the snake the less likely a ""hot"" bite, they don't want to waste venom on non-prey."
socalhiking,37eewc,wongun,2,Wed May 27 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with a snake kit is that it takes time to administer for questionable results. What you need is an antivenom, but the shelf-life for antivenom is short, so you can't include it in the kit. /u/wongun is right - don't waste your time on a snake kit. Just know where the nearest hospital is.  Incidentally, when was the last time someone in SoCal actually died from a snake bite? Has to be decades..."
socalhiking,37eewc,uscmissinglink,3,Wed May 27 14:01:12 2015 UTC,If someone has it probably was a child or elderly person.
socalhiking,37eewc,wongun,1 point,Wed May 27 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"As a transplant from western Pennsylvania that's been hiking in southern California for the past 35 years, I have never once had a need for a snake bite kit nor have I ever known anyone that's actually been bitten by a snake.  That's not to say that I've never seen a rattle snake or stepped off in a different direction after hearing a rattle, because I've done that many times.  Your best bet is to learn what a rattlesnake sounds like (I guess there's youtube for that these days), and get into the habit of steering clear of shady bushes when you're hiking in desert areas on a warm day."
socalhiking,37eewc,h_lehmann,2,Wed May 27 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"Its the ones that arent making a sound that catch you unawares - I'd also add that you should be aware of places where snakes are likely to be active: most of my sightings have been on creek beds or nearby and only a small percentage have rattled at me. If it's sandy and a lot of rocks on the ground, there's probably a snake in there somewhere so watch where you place your feet and don't wade through bushes aimlessly."
socalhiking,37eewc,nem0nem,1 point,Wed May 27 15:21:10 2015 UTC,"Ditto other users who suggest commercial snake-bite kits are useless. You are generally better off avoiding getting bit in the first place and, failing that, having a plan to get medical treatment ASAP. For me, that involves making a note of the last place I was at that had cell service so that I could (calmly) make my way back to that place and immediately call either 911 or the Park Ranger and then get myself as close as possible to transportation after that.  I would definitely keep a Sharpie with me. First, Sharpies are fucking great, and who doesn't appreciate a Sharpie? Second, you can use it to circle the wound and note the time of the wound so it can be found later. Also, I suppose you could make notes of any symptoms that are out of the ordinary (e.g., metallic taste in mouth, bleeding gums, numbness, dizziness, tingling, etc.) as well as the time you noticed it.  You might also want to research how to properly care for a snake-bite. Most of the kits I've seen are a waste of money and would probably only exacerbate your injuries."

socalhiking,37b2ld,ComeOnYouYanks,2,Tue May 26 18:19:53 2015 UTC,Since dorst is not taking reservations I think your chances of getting a site there will be fine on a friday.

socalhiking,3747j8,The_Xozz,7,Sun May 24 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"Made it out to whitney this weekend, headed up to trail camp on friday morning, with the plan to see how far we could get the next day. There was pretty much snow the entire day friday as that was the last day of some pretty heavy weather. Only needed microspikes for about the last mile or two to camp (past mirror lake really). Trail camp was cooooold and windy, it was kind of nice though because there were only about 3 other tents.   After talking to rangers and a lot of other people, as of saturday it’s been about 12 days since anyone has made it to the summit, there are huge drifts on the narrow ridges right after trail crest pretty much. Figured to give it a shot though, so headed for the chute on saturday morning. Switchbacks are still unusable. I’d say there’s about two feet of snow past trail camp, mostly powder, although I’m sure that will be changing soon. Chute was real tough with all the extra snow, but actually because it was so soft and we were breaking the trail, didn’t need crampons for the majority. You’ll definitely need them still, especially as the stuff ices up (had to switch into them for about the final third as it started getting icier). Was great for glissading down!  Got about 400 feet past trail crest, but after that with the snow in such large amounts and so soft on those ridges it just got real sketchy, not worth it to push on.  Depending on the weather though I’d say probably even by next weekend that’ll be opened up. A lot was already melting on our trip down."

socalhiking,36le1y,feartrich,2,Wed May 20 06:22:32 2015 UTC,"The Condor Trail alone is a pretty rugged trail. I know of two people who attempted to through-hike it in I believe sections this year and one dropped out.   As for cutting a trail from Vasquez to Piru, that's... a long way to cut trail. At 10k a mile which is probably fairly cheap as far as trailblazing goes you're looking at 7 figures easily to get the 20-30 miles to connect the two points. It looks roughly 15 miles from point to point but that cuts straight through Santa Clarita as the crow flies.  If you're serious, my suggestion is to bust out some topos and if you can get ahold of them old postwar USFS and NPS trail maps where applicable, and see if you can stitch together existing trail. That's about what the Condor trail is: Stitched together pre-existing trail. I think they said that like 3 or 4 miles of trail eventually needs to be cut for the CT, and that is something that they hope to have done in... maybe... a decade or so?  Anyway, once you have your meandering trail on paper, it's time to go out and scout all those trails and see which ones like... exist any more. Bushwhacking will probably be required at this point too. Also checking to see if there's any trails that run on private land is probably required at this point too as you scout the trail out. Anything that runs over private property either needs to be rerouted or needs an agreement with the property owner.  Once you've got a route from old trails, fire roads, and as a last resort country highway/roads, you can start building awareness for it.  Get ready for a process that might take the rest of your life to see fruition. Most of these long distance trails take decades to see come to fruition.   It'd be an interesting trail though.  Edit: I haven't looked at So Cal's PCT section, and while it probably isn't an issue, seasons are an issue in the Los Padres. Nobody wants to hike through 100 degree heat with no water for 20 miles in any direction. And that happens yearly. So you're looking at spring and fall throughikes. Winters will be wet, and occasionally snowy. Is there even enough seasonal time to do that kind of distance? While my initial hunch is ""probably"", it needs to be taken into account."

As far as payload and range, that's streets ahead of most drones that a typical person could afford."

socalhiking,36gljf,lolhaibai,-1,Tue May 19 21:38:46 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that they differentiate between what they call caches for convenience (i.e. most of the caches) and the few that are important and used by the majority of hikers in the longest dry stretches. They say that there are four such stretches, and I think I know what they are: the Scissors Crossing/Third Gate area in SoCal (miles ~ 70-110), the Mojave (miles ~ 610-650), Hat Creek Rim in NorCal, and Crater Lake to Thielsen Creek in Oregon. The article says that they are talking to land management agencies to explore the possibility of water tanks in those areas. I would be all for that.  To anyone who's thinking about thru-hiking (in the normal thru-hiking time of year), just know that you really can do the whole thing without using caches. I don't consider myself an especially strong hiker, but I barely touched the water caches in the desert. I only took more than a liter from them once, and I still would have survived if they hadn't existed. The caches are tempting to use for simplicity and weight savings' sake -- and those are two things, simplicity and weight savings, that are good to be focused on -- but they're almost never necessary to use. It was just a personal thing for me because I knew that even if I had taken tons of water from each one, I still wouldn't have exhausted the supply, because I was late in the season with not many people behind me, and I could tell from the water report that they were frequently restocked. I just had an ideal, not dissimilar to what the PCTA says, that the hike should be as close to a natural experience as possible, so my plan A with regards to water was always to use natural sources, even if they were off trail. I think if I were to thru-hike again I would accept the challenge of just never using caches and being fully self-reliant. You're never truly self-reliant over the course of a thru-hike (strangers help you out hundreds of times in different ways), but at least with regards to water, you really can be, and it's a nice empowering feeling."

socalhiking,36amix,Yelly,3,Sun May 17 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"I would imagine most locations would involve trout fishing in some of the canyons, either San Bernardino Mountains or San Gabriel Mountains. with a hike in.  You could try East Fork of San Gabriel. Sadly, the trout fishing has taken a major hit with the litter, gold panning, and drought. It's the first place that comes to mind though...  You could check out Whitewater Preserve. That's a little under 2 hours from Oceanside. I've never seen any trout in the lower reaches, but rumor has it that the upper reaches have fish. The lower portion lacks any pools or significant cover.   If you do go, please PM me a report :)"

(you will go up to the mt zion trail junction, stay left...  then through hoegee's campground, then to the upper winter creek juntion, stay left...  upper winter creek takes you to a paved road, go left...  this road ends at a locked gate at the top of the lot which you started at the bottom of....

Morton Peak trail is a moderate trail that gets you to a fire lookout. It can be steep and rocky but you get good views of the Redlands/Mentone valley. If you take the 38, the trailhead is a couple miles past the first bridge into the Santa Ana River Canyon.   I've taken my dog to the Forest Falls area to explore around.

Orginally this storm was forecasted to come through the LA area and that would have given the local mountains a decent amount of snow. However, I would still check conditions and be prepared since San G is well above 10K which could still mean a lot of snow. Have a good trip."

Anyone and everyone is welcome to join. I'm driving up tonight from San Diego and sleeping in my car. I know this mountain well and ski it a lot. Over the past two months most of the base has melted off and Ben's webcams (http://www.bensweather.com/index.php) aren't terribly helpful right now. But there's not too much snow falling up there today and the summit is always wind-scoured. I was very hopeful and threw my skis in the car, but I'm not going to bother with them. I brought an ice axe and crampons, which will be necessary as we are departing the trail before mine shaft saddle and will take a direct line up to the summit via a ridge."

socalhiking,35vi7h,loreseeker,2,Fri May 15 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"Baldy will most likely be getting snow, not rain. Last weekend, there was pretty heavy snowfall on Friday, so conditions this weekend could be similar. I started hiking the ski hut trail Saturday morning around 7:30 a.m. and it was snowy/icy up to the hut (I used microspikes), and just snowy after that. I think I started coming down from the summit around 9:45 a.m. and most of the snow below ~9000ft was already melting. The switchbacks above the ski hut had pretty much turned into a small stream. Coming down the switchbacks was definitely the worst part, lots of people were slipping in the mud. The way back from the ski hut to the parking lot was fine, no ice. If you have microspikes, I would recommend starting early. Hiking uphill through melting snow and mud didn't look fun."
socalhiking,35vi7h,loreseeker,1 point,Wed May 13 22:50:36 2015 UTC,"So I should probably postpone the hike if I don't have spikes? Man, I was really looking forward to it. Any reliable sites for accurate weather reports/conditions?"
socalhiking,35vi7h,PlanckSpace,3,Thu May 14 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that you should necessarily postpone it. Just be smart and careful. Lots of people did it last weekend without spikes. If there's ice or slippery snow/mud and you feel like it wouldn't be safe to go further, just turn around. It looks like the precipitation should end on Friday, so there's a good chance that most of the trail will be fine. The site http://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/mount-baldy-san-gabriel has weather predictions, just click on the elevation you want a weather report for.

socalhiking,35oov0,unknownkoger,1 point,Wed May 13 05:47:45 2015 UTC,"As a hiker, better to go lower first then upper winter creek. Opposite if on a bike. I don't hike that route much but I often bike it and have never seen a hiker travel the same direction as me."

socalhiking,35k1y8,Shark_With_Lasers,4,Mon May 11 02:59:39 2015 UTC,Los Padres? It's a drive but there are a few non reservable sites that will probably be free
socalhiking,35k1y8,tpm319,5,Mon May 11 03:53:05 2015 UTC,"I would still go to convict. You have about a foot of snow on dry rocks and I'm sure it's already melting. Memorial Day weekend is still two weeks away. It could still snow between now and then, and I doubt (but I hope!) it will be anything significant. Besides, camping with a little snow on the ground is living!"
socalhiking,35k1y8,wise_dome,3,Mon May 11 13:58:34 2015 UTC,Mineral King in Sequoia has 2 first-come first-serve campgrounds. I've been autumn backpacking in Mineral King but never actually been to these campsites. It's beautiful though.
socalhiking,35k1y8,hiltonsd,2,Mon May 11 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"I would suggest against this given the recent weather, the road to Mineral King is not one you want to take while a ton of snow is rapidly melting, even with 4 wheel drive."
socalhiking,35k1y8,tylorjams,2,Mon May 11 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"Kennedy Meadows, Los Padres National Forest, Sequoia National Forest, Idyllwild, Wrightwood.  You are going to have a bit of difficulty finding a site that particular weekend, but you may have luck. Your best bet is backpacking into a spot that is not frequented or finding BLM land to do some dispersed camping."
socalhiking,35k1y8,turn0,2,Mon May 11 05:09:32 2015 UTC,Can you suggest any BLM areas?  Places to park?  Are there trails on BLM land.  Thanks.
socalhiking,35k1y8,fendertweed,2,Mon May 11 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions, the BLM lands around Yosemite are a little out of the way and there are a number of national forests, national parks, and wilderness areas that are far better. In many areas, there are trailheads that allow for parking, and you can often park off the service roads to access many areas. BLM land typically has fewer trails than national forests and parks, but you can typically find any information regarding specific tracts of land on BLM's website. When you find what you where you want to go, you can download free topo maps online for free. I have included several links below:   http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/folsom/mercedriverrec.html  http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/bishop/topten.html  http://www.fs.usda.gov/recmain/stanislaus/recreation  You can also check out Red's Meadow as a trailhead if all the camping sites are taken.  http://www.summitpost.org/onion-valley-to-kearsarge-pass-trail/864661"

socalhiking,35k1y8,fendertweed,1 point,Tue May 12 15:41:33 2015 UTC,i feel you. all the snow has come too late this year
socalhiking,35k1y8,FirstNameAsALast,1 point,Mon May 11 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"You should be snow free in the Southern Sierras if you stick to lower elevations. Check out Black Rock station and the myriad trails that spread out from that area. As long as you are packing in you wont have an issue with getting a permit. There's always Jacinto, Gorgonio and thereabouts. Also 2 weeks from now I'd be shocked if most if not all significant snow pack is gone, definitely not full ground coverage anywhere below 12k ft.  One last suggestion is Dixie, Cedar Breaks, Zion, that whole area up there. It's a mix of pine forrest, mountains, and desert canyons. Probably not the same kind of desert camping you have been doing lately and most of that territory is within 8 hours, Zion being about 6.5 If you get on it now you can probably find somewhere to camp outside Zion, everything that is generally closed for the winter will be open as of last week. I was just in Zion last Saturday and it could not have been more perfect. You'll have a hell of a time getting a site in the park but there is a camp site past the tunnel near checkerboard mesa, just outside the park that is private and not well known as well as a dude ranch type place a mile beyond that had cabins. Also there is a ton of BLM camping south of Zion in the Wire Mesa area but that is most definitely the desert."
socalhiking,35k1y8,tylorjams,1 point,Mon May 11 17:36:46 2015 UTC,"Check out Reserveamerica.com they'll list out the sites that are open.

socalhiking,35k1y8,jubelo,1 point,Mon May 11 03:30:02 2015 UTC,So much this. Memorial Day is when I go and hide in the backcountry.
socalhiking,35ipgt,BorregoStrollerMan,7,Sun May 10 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"You can apply for a campfire permit - http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/angeles/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5318609 - to have campfires in certain designated spots, and they probably have some suggestions on where might be best.  If it were me, I'd probably start or finish the trip with a big campfire at Dockweiler beach, as you can burn as much as you want and not worry about causing a forest fire."
socalhiking,35ipgt,jbisinla,4,Sun May 10 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea.  Gathering wood from the backcountry sort of goes against the leave no trace mantra we try really hard to abide by, so buying some wood and car camping the first night at a beach would definitely be the way to go."
socalhiking,35ipgt,skrenename4147,2,Mon May 11 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, gathering wood and having fires during a drought is not legal, not smart and leaves a fire pit and broken up wood and vegetation eyesore for many years.  Don't do it.  Also the fire permits you get these days only give you the ability to use a stove, not to gather wood and burn it.  You can only have a fire safely and legally in established sites with fire rings.  I like the suggestion that you do your first night in a spot where fires are okay then backpack into nature and enjoy.  The fire is unnecessary anyways, it will be plenty warm and night and for cooking a stove is light and way simpler."
socalhiking,35ipgt,anythingcanbeadildo,5,Tue May 12 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"Its really just best not to do this, IMO. Too many fires have been started on accident ... I would echo the statements that to start or end your trip at a car campsite and get after it if you want to."
socalhiking,35ipgt,tpm319,2,Mon May 11 01:33:28 2015 UTC,Did some backpacking about a month ago in the San Rafael wilderness in the Los Padres National Forrest.  It was still permitted then but we opted not too because it seemed to dry at our campsite to be safe.  Other campsites we saw would have been fine though.  Not sure if they have brought back the restrictions.
socalhiking,35ipgt,TravelMike2005,2,Mon May 11 01:03:43 2015 UTC,"There aren't many places at all Even with a fire permit it's restricted to designated fire rings at campsites. Are you sure they wouldn't be more interested in car camping and doing some day hikes? If not, I think they'll just have to go without.    I know it's a big change for people used to big roaring fires. My gf always wants a big fire but for backpacking that's just not possible very often in southern California."
socalhiking,35ipgt,nept_r,2,Mon May 11 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"Big Sur! You can get an open fire permit on their officIal website. Camping at the campground have many months waiting list and technically you can't just camp anywhere but then again there's less than 10 wild rangers for the entire place. Just went backpacking there a few weeks ago! Edit: However, with that said, please please be careful and very conscious of where you set up your fire. Surround it with rocks, away from any dry vegetation and PUT IT OUT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP. Have fun."
socalhiking,35ipgt,LaughsWithYou,7,Sun May 10 21:00:56 2015 UTC,No campfires in the Los Padres except in designated Campfire Use Sites.  Restriction just went into effect on Wednesday.  http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/lpnf/home/?cid=stelprdb5401877

socalhiking,35ipgt,ProtonDeathRay,1 point,Mon May 11 07:25:39 2015 UTC,Make sure none of that wood has been remotely around poison oak. The only option imo is to buy wood and not trust that poison oak tainted wood.

socalhiking,35fmx8,scottawr,2,Mon May 11 18:43:01 2015 UTC,Most trail on Vivian is south facing and snow isn't a huge issue. It's well enough traveled and the spots that might have a little snow will have boot track to follow.
socalhiking,35fmx8,uscmissinglink,2,Sun May 10 04:02:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I've done it twice and I'm mostly worried about the last little stretch above tree line but I'm thinking it won't be too bad...  Might buy crampons in case but return them if I don't use. Still hoping to hear from someone who's actually been up the recently though...
socalhiking,35fmx8,uscmissinglink,1 point,Sun May 10 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"I was there a few times on all different trails last month. I rarely used my crampons, just the chutes on the north side. Everything else was boots. However I haven't kept up with conditions and the freeze thaw cycle n stuff."
socalhiking,35cixd,slyweazal,5,Sat May 9 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"A great addition to the more serious hiker is the bridge to nowhere. It's about 30 minutes into Angeles Forrest from Azusa. Got to be one of the more fun hikes in the area and excellent on hot days since there's a real river there with some decent vegetation. Goes in about 5 miles and there's a giant beautiful bridge that leads to nowhere, not connected to any road or even within miles of one. It was built in the early 1900's I believe and was intended to be part of a highway heading though the Forrest that met a tragic end so the road was never completed. But the bridge still stands to this day. There's a great description on modern hiker."
socalhiking,35cixd,anythingcanbeadildo,1 point,Sat May 9 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"I loved this hike! The starts out so fun and eventful, then it gets boring and monotonous, so boring that you wonder why even go any further, and then all of a sudden you reach the bridge and are rewarded with a nice cool off from the river. Never mind the hike back, bc you leave refreshed and with a feeling of accomplishment."

socalhiking,34wmsm,shreddykruger,3,Tue May 5 04:06:46 2015 UTC,interesting. I'd think that those campgrounds are too far out of the way for homeless people to use.  I've lived in North East LA for almost a decade and have noticed in the past two years perma camp sites & tents are now all over the wild areas of Debs Park. I figured all the money being injected to development downtown is forcing a lot of those people into different areas. I'm not sure if that's whats going on in East fork but thought i'd share my anecdote.
socalhiking,34wmsm,poppytanhands,1 point,Tue May 5 05:20:36 2015 UTC,I can assure you that the homeless in Debs Park are not from downtown. Jose Huizar's office looked into where the homeless along the Arroyo Seco and in Debs Park came from and the conclusion they came to is that most of them were people who previously lived in homes in the area but had become homeless for various reasons.
socalhiking,34wmsm,nirad,2,Tue May 5 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"i camped about 2 miles past the bridge once.  i think that puts me just short of where you were.  this was probably 4 years ago now.  definitely wasn't that bad.  we past a few old timers who were definitely living up there for the most part.  we were panning too, so we were trying to be pretty cautious and not set up shop on someone's claim.  overall it was a fun trip though.  i was always more disappointed by all the trash down near the parking lot."

socalhiking,34ucpb,HikingFool,1 point,Mon May 4 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"The reason these are called ""snow flowers"" is that they can grow while the snow is still on the ground. They don't need sunlight, as they don't photosynthesize. Instead, they have a symbiotic relationship with a fungus that lives on the roots of other plants. They take energy and give carbon."

socalhiking,34ucpb,SwolberhamLincoln,1 point,Tue May 5 00:47:49 2015 UTC,"They are not parasitic, but probably mutualistic. My guess is that they fix nitrogen during times of snow cover which is extremely valuable in the plant community. Legumes (peanuts and the like) do the same thing. It is very energy taxing to the plant they are mutualistic with but it is such an advantage, they still persist."

So they used to be A) Closer B) in different spots.   Again, for the east-west, so cal is just a big mess of faults. It started a long time ago during plate tectonics when the oceanic plate was probably pushing more north than east-west. Also the range maybe has rotated with time.  With all volcanic rocks, its a big rock soup before it cools. Some of those inclusions will cool faster than the surrounding rocks. This is totally normal and textbook geology.  If you on granite, its an old volcano, if not probably tectonic action.  Usually sedimentary rocks by the beach, and granites in the mountains.... So Cal has every rock type so this question is really broad.   This was pretty basic! Feel free if you have more questions/expand on any of them."

socalhiking,34saco,Cartito123,3,Mon May 4 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"For a bachelor party, desert camping would be the best option. Around Ocotillo Wells there are places you can literally just pitch a tend in the middle of the sand. Great for getting drunk, having a big fire and having a blast. Few rules and even less enforcement. But, /u/wongun is right. Timing is essential. August and early September may be too hot for this to work.  If you want to do it in the summer, I'd look into the Cleveland National Forest, especially the Laguna Meadows area. It's an hour east, 6,000 feet (i.e. not hot) and totally cool. Biggest challenge is that you'll have neighbors and people to enforce rules.  If you want to make it a trip to remember and travelling is an option, Baja California (Mexico) and Big Hole, Montana (Jackson, MT) should be on your list. These have the added advantage of being outside of the California Red Tape Zone (camping in CA can be harder than buying a gun in terms of permit, passes, fees and the like).  For this sort of thing, you'd be smart to avoid National Parks, State Parks or anywhere that has a dedicated staff who's job it is to make sure your fun isn't too fun. If you know what I'm saying.

socalhiking,34saco,CapnScrunch,1 point,Mon May 4 09:10:15 2015 UTC,Time frame is really important out here.  If your going during the summer it can be pretty miserable to completely intolerable in the desert.  Joshua Tree NP or the surrounding National Forest would be a chill area with plenty of outdoor stuff to do and plenty of privacy.  That's going to be key if your going to avoid unnecessary attention from rangers.  The summer in Joshua tree can be pretty hot.  Some of the local mountain areas like mount laguna should be relatively cool in the summer but much more likely to draw attention from camp hosts and or rangers.  The big bear area would probably be a good option as well.

We had a fire, a bunch of beer, and some great times.    The camp sites are tricky out there since the ones in the park are al first come, first serve so you need to get out there early.  There are some great hikes, but bring lots of water.  There is no water inside the park.  The rock climbing is great and the stars are amazing.  If you reserve a site at Indian Cove (not inside the main park, but still pretty cool) you'll be camped up against enormous boulders that look incredible when lit by firelight.

socalhiking,34sfld,JonnyMonty,1 point,Mon May 4 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"It's hard to predict new snow etc. for the trail condition. However, there's a good chance the 99 switchbacks will not be open by then. While you can handle snow on the trail, snow at the cables often renders them inaccessible, meaning you'll take the snow chute up from Trail Camp.

First, if you're backpacking on the santa catalina trail you need to know that it's a long way from avalon to shark harbor. Since you're saying dana point that means avalon since they don't go to two harbors (and only twice daily). Last trip I just drove up to long beach since who knows what can happen out there and I wanted flexible times to come back.  If you want to go direct to two harbors, you need to ferry out of san pedro as far as I can tell. You can take a short ferry from avalon to san pedro however, but that burns time.

socalhiking,34gv1x,feartrich,1 point,Fri May 1 01:49:58 2015 UTC,"They are many valid reasons why people carry a gun into the wilderness:   Some people like the comfort of knowing they can lethally dispatch a bear should they encounter one. Honestly, I think this is the most common reason. They're not bringing the guns out to act tough, but because they're scared. A bit of an overreaction, but to each their own. Some people are safety obsessed and carry one at all times. Again, an overreaction IMO, but if they have discipline, I don't think it's big of a problem. Some people want to act they're survivialists/woodsmen and carry a gun to make them feel rustic. Depending on the season/location, some people hunt on the side. This is common in the Los Padres.   Of course there are douches who open carry guns for their own egos, but that's a another story."
socalhiking,34gv1x,BillyBastion,3,Sun May 3 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion and experience so take it with a grain of salt.  I believe it is legal of open carry in certain parts of National Forests.  However, there are still places within the National Forest where you are not allowed to carry, i.e. school, visitor centers with signs that say ""no guns"" allowed, etc.  But in areas like trails, I do believe it's legal.  However, if I were you, I would definitely give the local ranger and LEO a call just to be sure.  As far as National Parks and regular car camping campgrounds, I'm not sure.  You're right when you say the laws get pretty convoluted.  I've never had an issue while open carrying in the National Forests, even when I ran into a forest ranger.  I have had to discharge my firearm once in self defense, and after that I pretty much always carry when I can.  But I think I'm the outlyer because everyone on these camping subs really, really hates guns."

Personally, I like meeting people on the trail who are openly carrying pistols. It gives us something to talk about and they are invariably polite, nice, informed, and prepared - all qualities that I appreciate. Unfortunately in this state, the only way to always legally carry is concealed, with a permit for concealed carry from your local sheriff. In southern Cal that means San Bernardino, Riverside, Kern, and pending the Peruta en banc decision San Diego counties. Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties will generally not issue.   There is a fantastic thread on Calguns that, while long, does a good job of clarifying - better than I could do. I recommend you go here and read through the definitions of the acronyms and find your situation to see where you stand.   Of course, at the end of the day it's your call until you run into a ranger or another officer. Then it's their call.  Good luck, be safe, have fun."

socalhiking,34gv1x,Gabrcruz,2,Fri May 1 05:39:47 2015 UTC,"I live in L.A. county as well. The 9th Circuit court initially found in favor of Peruta in his case v. San Diego. This meant that some counties began to issue according to that ruling. The counties that were already the most difficult to get a permit in, though, adopted a 'wait and see' attitude, in anticipation of an en banc review from the 9th circuit court or the likely ruling from the US Supreme Court.   Los Angeles is one of the counties that is waiting and seeing. The en banc review that the 9th decided to do is a process that will take a long time - which means that it will likely be years before the case has a resolution. In the meantime, you can certainly turn in an application with the county. It will go in the pile and if the courts force them to become shall-issue you'll get your permit. Or you can wait and see."

socalhiking,34fbbr,AsthmaticMechanic,5,Thu Apr 30 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"I would ask the local rangers about each specific parking area. It seems to be somewhat random. I thought it was a free for all, but then my buddy got a ticket because the parking lot was ""developed"". It only had a concrete bench and some pit toilets, which other lots that aren't enforcing also have. At any rate, it's like $30 for the annual pass, buy it for the karma."

socalhiking,34fbbr,bassheadjones,4,Sun May 3 07:03:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they need alot of money for cleanup from what I see regularly around Angeles forest.

socalhiking,34bwlb,etheriusthebold,4,Wed Apr 29 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"Almost anything in Anza Borrego doesn't need a permit.   A lot of trails in San Bernadino forest don't require permits. A few do, but from my recollection most do not. They do require an adventure pass, but that's the same for any hiking in that area.  I don't know about the Santa Monica Mountains, but I don't remember anything regarding permits when I did it.   Similarly, there are a handful of wilderness areas that don't require permits. Pine Creek wilderness in San Diego is a permit-free area.  To be honest, most places do not require permits, and even if they do, there are usually very few people there and almost no one is checking. I think some of the more popular trails (San Gorgonio, Jacinto, Santa Anita Canyon/Chantry Flats) it's more appreciated to get a permit due to popularity. Almost everything else is pretty open.   I recommend hiking the PCT around Gorgonio and San Bernadino peaks. It's great, it's not very popular and there is plenty of camping. Anza Borrego has great hikes as well that really lend themselves to the weekend traveler who made very few plans."

I have it in my living room and it's a huge conversation piece for anyone in the area, people can't help but run their hands over the ridges.

Piute Pass is one of the easiest access points in the eastern Sierra and Pine Creek is one of the hardest.  Pine Creek Pass is a very long slog that could take you most of the day, whereas you could reach Piute Pass in just a couple hours."
socalhiking,349sfi,oildig,2,Wed Apr 29 14:04:32 2015 UTC,"Pine creek you would have more to yourself. For good reason. It is a long, hard, dry, dusty, hot climb that is also kind of ugly.   Paiute is going to have a few more people, but it is very easy, beautiful, lots of water access,   The flip side is that pine creek puts you  directly into french canyon, which is some seriously beautiful territory, which is a longer hike from.the Paiute side.   You will likely see one pack train on either."

I don't really think it's a good hiking trail, it's basically an 8 foot wide trail that goes into the hills and comes back. It's fun on a bike, I just wouldn't hike it.   The second one is probably Potato Mountain. It's a nice hike and is a little more sheltered from sun and wind. The trail is called Palmer Every Mountainway. There is a small turnoff from Mt.

If you're traversing Hurricane Deck, you need to know your shit; you can die up there if you're not careful. Although going with friends certainly makes it easier to get through.  Forget about water. There might be some in Manzana Creek, but that's it. Bring a 6L Dromedary and fill it up at a spigot at one of the campsites near the trailhead (or fill it up at home). Fill up another 3L or so for you water bottle/bladder. That's 30 lbs of water for the first day, so pack light.  The ""trail"" that follows the ridgeline is really spotty. Expect to be fighting the brush all the time, so wear long pants and sleeves. If you get lost, scramble up to a high point and find the ridge. Just follow the ridge and you'll be fine. Alternatively, bring a GPS or map and compass. You should be able sight the two highest peaks of Hurricane Deck easily, and you can use that to make bearings.  The trail is super exposed to the elements, so dress lightly on warm days and very warm on cold days. Bring a hat. And some parts of the route is exposed (in a climbing sense) too, so be careful.  Be prepared and this will be a wonderful bushwhacking experience."

socalhiking,33igu5,feartrich,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"There are bears out there, but they're not a big problem in the Los Padres and people don't usually bring bear canisters. You're more likely to get your food stolen by a raccoon or squirrel than a bear. But you can bring a canister if you'd like.  Your buddies should be carrying enough water for themselves, so you don't need to bring 12 L, unless you're expecting to go really slow, or you have a tendency to guzzle water all the time."

Start as early as you can in the dark to beat the sun as much as possible on the way up and bring enough water of course. Keep a good steady pace for the first 8 miles up to the tram station because you will feel like you are almost done once you get there, but in reality you have another 12 miles round trip to go to the top and back. Electrolytes are your best friends because if you are not careful you muscles will start to build lactic acid quite quickly and make the steep hike worse.   Weather looks fine, but it will tend to be a bit colder and windy at the top.  Best of luck makes me wish I was going again"

socalhiking,339rc8,sourd0ugh,2,Mon Apr 20 21:49:23 2015 UTC,I did Joshua Tree this past weekend. Campgrounds were definitely full but the backcountry wasn't crowded. Water would be the challenge with the long hike you're looking for.

socalhiking,339rc8,scottawr,2,Tue Apr 21 05:25:06 2015 UTC,"I recommend Mt San Jacinto. It is a short, two hour drive from SD and offers camping, running water, and serenity. If you start at Marion Mtn Trailhead you can backpack up to Little Round Valley, grab a campsite there, then make your way to the top of Mt. San Jacinto. The peak is an actual peak and not a huge, flat peak like so many summits. The view down to Palm Springs is 10,000ft and pretty killer. You can look across and into JTree, San Gorgonio and Baldy. Make sure to get a wilderness permit (free) at the Ranger station in Idyllwild. Happy trails!"

If you can stay at the Emerald Bay Campground, there are lake front campsites. Desolation Wilderness is fun. It shares some trail space with the PCT (more crowds) but if you leave the hiker super hwy and go to a lake, you may have your own private lake for a while."
socalhiking,32yx74,darthjenni,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. Would you say it was annoyingly crowded? As in, enough to remind you constantly that you weren't alone out in the bush for a while? I'll be hammock camping as well, so that usually gives me an opportunity to stay in the tree-line and away from a bunch of tents.   I've got a relatively limited time frame because of school and I was originally looking at doing the Long Trail in VT which is 272 miles but it might not fit in my time frame... I'm not really a 20+ mile per day hiker; I like to take my time, have a 0 mile day here and there, do some day hikes, stop and take pictures. I might just pick a national park or something as a base and do a series of 1-3 day hikes if I can't find something to thru-hike."

Best I can think of is how Google maps allows you to define routes on a single page but of course Google maps doesn't have all trails.

socalhiking,326ce5,tpm319,3,Sat Apr 11 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you are going for. The Sierra technically start at Walker Pass on Highway 178. But it is not what most people would think of when they think of the Sierra as it still has a desert vibe, but with massive uphills. Kennedy Meadows (from J41)is a great place to access some higher elevation and is really when the trails start to ""feel"" like the mountains. There are a number of places between highway 178 and Lone Pine that you can use to access the Sierra, either from CA99 (Western side) or I395 (Eastern)."
socalhiking,326ce5,browies,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:15:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Do you have any recommendations of where to backpack near Kennedy Meadows?
socalhiking,326ce5,browies,2,Sat Apr 11 00:28:40 2015 UTC,"Well there are tons of spots around there, like I said, it depends on what you are going for. If you want a thru-hike You could do a section of the PCT, say Kennedy to Trail Pass trail or Horseshoe Meadows. If you just want to chill in the mountains take J41 to Sherman Pass road and you can find lots of swimming, camping, and hiking around the  the Kern river and its various small tributaries. If you go that route, I recommend stopping by Kernville and refilling with beer and grub at the brewery, then on your way out stay a night at Remington hot springs. Horseshoe is north closer to Lone Pine but has fantastic backpacking too.   If you wanna go further than Lone Pine, I suggest Kearsarge Pass/Onion Valley. It was a stand-out beautiful place along the PCT, which is saying a lot."
socalhiking,326ce5,duhblow7,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:19:32 2015 UTC,"In my experience with Kennedy Meadows I've found there is so much to do out in this area and not enough time.  I have a ""spot"" in this area that my friends and I go to as a bros trip every year.  I won't even talk about it locally with people, it is like one of those fishing honey holes that you keep close to yourself.  But since I have a launch off point we try to check out some of the other areas and each time we find a diamond in the rough.  There are so many great campsites for whatever you're looking for, 4x4, backpacking, hunting, fishing/golden trout, swimming, shooting, hiking, etc.  I truly believe this is one of the greatest ""close"" spots to get into the sierras and it is one of those places that I hope the internet doesn't' ruin.

socalhiking,31y74s,ipowyourface,4,Thu Apr 9 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"Jumping from the high perch is a bad idea. Low water flow due to the drought combined with recklessness contributed to this sad story. I get nervous jumping 10 feet from the low perch, can't imagine 50. I also haven't swam there in years as its littered with garbage and graffiti :/ as are all waterfalls that can be accessed within an hour or so walking."
socalhiking,31y74s,HikingFool,3,Thu Apr 9 02:36:37 2015 UTC,The water level at hermit doesn't change much with flow in the stream.  There is a bowl at the bottom that fills up and overflows downstream.  The level never varies more than about a foot unless there is a torrential downpour.
socalhiking,31y74s,HikingFool,3,Thu Apr 9 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"I'm actually there quite frequently as I live in the area and was a local Boy Scout. The last couple years the water level has gone noticeably down from what I can recall. To me what stands out as a sign of the lower depth of the pool is that the trash that used to just flow further down is now trapped in the pool because it can't get over the lip of the rock like it used to. This has led to stagnant trash in the pool, so much so that I stopped jumping from the lower jump spot. I've now taken my water play time to the west fork near devore instead. Much less traffic, no graffiti (like what covers hermit falls), and minimal trash. Almost every time I go to chantry I bring out pocketfuls of trash. 3 weeks ago I must have been following someone who ate a whole pack of starburst and figured ""fuck it"" I'll just litter, as I picked up a single individual wrapper almost every 5 minutes on the way towards sturdevant. I ended up going up Newcombe to take the rim trail to Wilson, but not sure if the trash continued up the sturdevant trail to Wilson or towards Zion."
socalhiking,31y74s,HikingFool,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"I too am there very frequently.  Multiple times most weeks if the weather isn't foul.  I agree that humans have ruined it, and the water is filthy.  I would never jump there for that reason alone.  But the trash/filth/waste buildup in the water is an indicator of low turnover rate, not low depth.  The nastiness leaves the pool when the depth at the lip is high, but with the stream bed shape being what it is, the depth at the lip can rise a foot (12 inches of moving water is actually a lot), and only impact the depth of the bowl by a few percent...    Water has to fill the bowl completely before it can flow out.  The bowl is deep.  Filling the bowl beyond full is what determines the depth at the exit.  I assure you, whenever it's more than a foot deep at the exit, you wouldn't have very many people at the falls because there would be so much water in the stream that the crossings below the first water trail would scare people away.  In my first career I was a fluid dynamicist.  This is open channel hydraulics week 1.  There is no way to greatly diminish the depth of that pool without completely stopping (not just reducing) the inflow of water, so your recollection must be in error.  The increase in accidents at Hermit Falls over the last few years is due to the increase in popularity of Hermit Falls, not a decrease in depth."
socalhiking,31y74s,illaparatzo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"Ok :) I'm just an accountant. I probably should have used an abacus ;) on a serious note I'm curious because I like learning and trivia and I'm not sure if I'm understanding you properly, you are saying that even though there is less water due to drought, it's about the same depth. The depth is pretty much the same as the outflow point only allows water out after the pool has been filled up to full. That the water is stagnant because there isn't much turnover in the pool due to low flow?"

""Grizzly"" refers to the golden and grey tips of its hair. Genetically, North American grizzlies are closely related; in size and coloring, the California grizzly was much like the grizzly of the southern coast of Alaska. In California, it was particularly admired for its beauty, size, and strength. Many accounts from pioneers describe grizzlies in long, bloody fights with angry longhorn bulls, and often winning. The grizzly became a symbol of the Bear Republic, the name that California had when it was an independent nation.

socalhiking,30yyv5,beestakingthe405,3,Tue Mar 31 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"So 3 of us and a dog decided to tackle the mysterious Piru Creek Hike, and I'm so freaking glad we did. Here's a short run down of the trip:  We all took Friday off work, got to the trail and started hiking around 3pm, that was after picking one guy up at LAX, dropping a truck at Lake Piru (we had to pay $20), and then parking and setting off at Frenchman's Flat. If you get Google directions, be careful of the ""bonus road"" as we called it. Basically the exit it tells you to take off the 5 has no signs and only has a small opening through the guardrail, and if you pass it, I imagine it would suck. So park at Frenchman's, I have an adventure pass but not sure if it was required.  We got on the trail around 3 and decided to set up camp at about 6:30 I believe. Nothing remarkable about day 1, just that it was the most ""trail-y"" of the entire hike. No chance of a trail after that.  Day 2 we got on the trail about 9am and the first thing that happened was my buddy came up on a rattlesnake, and almost tripped backwards trying to flee from it. We threw some rocks to get it to scamper away so we could pass. Phew! Ok, now it's all getting real. As we hiked, our standards started getting lower and lower as to what we were willing to bushwhack through and what was considered passable. We quickly learned that our pace was pretty slow if we stuck to the creek so we had to force ourselves to keep scanning the banks for passable land (ie dry creek bed, open field, etc.). Since there isn't a trail, the name of the game is forward progress: keep going forward until we physically can't get through something, then head to the creek and switch to the other side if it's open. If it's not, stay in the creek til the next open area. Over the course of the day, we saw two more rattlesnakes, a king snake, and a mysterious snake hanging out in the grass/reeds on the edge of the creek (not cool snake, not cool). We set up camp on day 2 right at last light, about 7:30.   Day 3 we tried to get up early and get going for fear of getting back to the truck too late. I found out later that Lake Piru doesn't close like we thought, so we hurried for no reason. We got on the trail about 7:30, found the first traces of the dirt road/tire tracks at 10:30 and got to the truck by 1:30.   So overall, that was 20 hours of hiking, easily could be done in a 2 day trip. I wish we hadn't rushed ourselves because the hike was absolutely amazing. Overall, it wasn't hard, it wasn't exhausting at all. It's all downhill and with the current. But bushwhacking and creek hiking take a slight toll. I was ok the entire hike but my friends got a little exhausted by the end of day 2 and while we were on the hot paved road on day 3. I don't have any pictures other than from day 1 because I realized the place was way too beautiful to be able to capture on camera. It's absolutely amazing out there. I would definitely recommend it for a knowledgeable backpacker. We're not experts by any means, but we've done a handful of trips before. Again, it wasn't a hard hike, and I can't say who should be able to do finish it or not. It's definitely a unique experience. Ask away if you have any questions."
socalhiking,30yyv5,palmeredhackle,2,Tue Mar 31 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"Very few people appreciate just how difficult it is to travel without a trail especially in a canyon with a creek.

socalhiking,30yyv5,DTripleR,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"For me, it all started with my buddy getting a Whitney permit in the lottery last year. I went to REI and bought a 36L pack for the Whitney day hike. I've camped before but never backpacked, so I had like a sleeping bag, hammock, tent, sleeping pad, all that kind of stuff. But once I got a pack, I realized all my stuff was too heavy and oversized, so I started looking into upgrading my gear, one piece at a time. A 36L pack is really small for backpacking, but I like it because it forces me to consider everything and to research what gear is light but affordable. So for this trip I brought (and forgive me for not linking, I assume you can google this all):  Osprey Sirrus 36  Sierra Designs Backcountry Quilt  Klymit 0Zone Inertia  MLD Duomid (didn't end up using because we just slept on the footprint)  Tyvek footprint  $40 Trekking poles from Craigslist (only ended up needing one)  Sawyer mini with camelbak attachment  Aquafina bottle for dirty water (Sawyer attaches, then goes into Camelbak, I can't do inline filtering because my dog drinks from the Camelbak using gravity)  Prana Halle pants  Cotton v-neck white shirt  Inov-8 Trailroc shoes  Injiji socks  Patagonia down jacket  Spare shirt  Running shorts  Cheapo stove from Amazon (orange box)  Fuel canister  .6L pot  enamel mug  Spork  Sea to Summit eVent compression bag for sleeping bag and down jacket  Sea to Summit dry bag for food  Snake bite kit  First aid kit  Fenix HL50 headlight/flashlight  Sunscreen  Hat  Sunglasses  Overall I'd say my back weighed 25lbs with water and food, which is pretty good. Any more and I'd be hating the trip. As you can see from the pictures, my friends had stuff attached to their packs which made it harder on them during the bushwhacking. I'd had it much easier than them. Plus I had the smallest pack. Hope that helps. I'd look into r/wildernessbackpacking and r/ultralight."

It's a beautiful trail and my favorite way up (just did it three weeks ago) but it's very sparsely traveled compared to the other two. It's very narrow (though a bit better than it used to be) and especially if you are going by yourself, for safety you probably want to travel trails where you will encounter people just in case anything happens. You can definitely make a loop with both the trail you found and id recommend taking upper winter creek trail back so that you don't have to walk up the steep hot paced section at the start of chantry flats. Upper winter creek will put you out at the top of the parking lot, plus loops are always more fun. Just make sure you have a good map as there are tons of trails in chantry."

socalhiking,30if04,Kirbacho,3,Fri Mar 27 17:20:51 2015 UTC,Griffith Park is a world class attraction that attracts lots of people. Los Angeles should treat it like the United States treats its National Parks that have many visitors and little road space such as Grand Canyon and Zion Canyon--it should restrict automobiles and provide regular shuttles. Parking and driving should be restricted along the road up to the Observatory. There are large parking lots down near the Greek Theater--charge for parking and put in shuttles every ten minutes.
socalhiking,30if04,iateone,2,Mon Mar 30 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"that's the thing, there already are lots of parking areas. and there already is a bus that takes people to the observatory for a mere 50 cents. i would be fine with the existing bus service adding a few more stops to bring people further up. totally fine with that. just keep the rest of the cars off the park space."
socalhiking,30if04,iateone,2,Mon Mar 30 19:40:20 2015 UTC,"Actually I've been disappointed in Griffith Park for a while. The parking lot at the top is only large enough for a hundred or so cars. The sides of the streets leading up to it are covered with cars on both sides causing bottlenecks, dangerous conditions, and pollution. I think the park as a whole would benefit from restricting all automobile traffic along the roads to the Observatory while increasing shuttle/bus service."
socalhiking,30if04,shamblingman,2,Mon Mar 30 19:44:41 2015 UTC,not sure if already on your calendar but here's the info for the next board meeting regarding this  https://www.facebook.com/events/869403253105353/
socalhiking,30if04,sgantm20,-6,Mon Mar 30 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"fucking pretentious assholes. if someone wants to drive up there, let them drive. do you think every person in the world is capable of walking 4.2 miles?   what about people who are locked into wheelchairs or getting very old?   what is wrong with you people? it's not going to destroy your secret little place if other people go."
socalhiking,30if04,sgantm20,8,Fri Mar 27 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"are you saying that all open trail spaces in the country should be ADA compliant?   Did you completely miss the part about expanding the ALREADY EXISTING DASH BUS SERVICE?  ""A stop should be added to the southern foot of Mt. Hollywood Dr. where tourists will only need to walk 1500 feet to get to a beautiful Hollywood sign vista point. The cost to riders is 50 cents.""  Also, it's not a little secret place. Its a very popular open space where a ton of local park users go.   By opening up this space to car traffic and making it into a parking lot, we are losing this space. We don't want to block people from coming up there. That's the last thing we want. We want lots of people to come enjoy it with us.   I don't think you read this carefully."
socalhiking,30if04,heypal11,-3,Fri Mar 27 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"I'd rather people drive through there, where its a park rather than the ANF. Lets face it, its not ""wilderness"".  I say let the busses in and it will encourage more people to use public transpo."

socalhiking,30i3z7,scottawr,2,Sat Mar 28 04:12:20 2015 UTC,By virtue of the late hour and my laziness I just copied directly from my meetup post :)
socalhiking,30i3z7,scottawr,2,Sat Mar 28 04:51:48 2015 UTC,"I would only do a meetup if there was a similar disclaimer...   heard too many horror stores of people being stranded/lost due to horrible ""leadership"""
socalhiking,30i3z7,scottawr,2,Sat Mar 28 05:23:58 2015 UTC,"Thankfully it's not usually an issue for me. Most people that join my hikes go my pace and sometimes faster. I did have to ask someone to turn around once though. We were only 1.5 miles in to a 20 mile day and they already more than 15 minutes behind. Unfortunately there was no way for the group to finish if we kept taking 15 minute breaks every 45 minutes. Besides the disclaimer, I usually wait list everyone I don't know already and ask what hikes they have done the last month to make sure they are up for the hike. Though I never assume responsibility, I always want to do my best to assure that everyone is successful. I've also turned around when I was a burden before. I came back from 2 weeks in Hawaii at sea level  and attempted to do a baldy from the village + the three t's but got light headed an nauseous before even 8k. Did a couple mid week hikes the next week to get the juices flowing, and did it solo the next weekend."

socalhiking,30ccrt,iateone,2,Thu Mar 26 22:42:29 2015 UTC,I'll be attempting next friday!  Did you need any spikes or crampons or were your fragile feet enough for the climb?
socalhiking,30a8l4,doncheadle_,4,Wed Mar 25 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"I was just there last weekend. It was great! The Lodgepole spring was frozen, but there was water in the lake that we filtered. There was also plenty of snow if you'd rather melt snow for water.  On the hike up, we started seeing small patches of snow around Horse Meadow and then it was consistently snowy on the last drainage into Dry Lake and beyond. We didn't go far beyond Dry Lake but we were fine with just boots & poles (no crampons, microspikes, etc.). If you plan to summit, bring all that ice stuff though.  We also filtered water at the Grinnell crossing on the way back down. The flow there was really good."

socalhiking,30a8l4,marylou5,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"It was sunny & mid-50s during the day, 30s at night. Apparently it was colder on Thurs/Fri (according to some other backpackers we talked to). It got really windy on Saturday night, but the camping area at Dry Lake was fairly protected from the wind so that was no biggie."

This is the time to go - there is ample water, the temperatures are pleasant, and the wildflowers are in bloom. It can get busy around breaks and holidays, though, so take that into account."
socalhiking,306za7,heypal11,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:17:17 2015 UTC,Do you need a permit or reservations to camp out there? I didn't see any info on modern hiker about it. I just moved down to socal so I haven't done much campin around here yet.
socalhiking,306za7,andino93,3,Wed Mar 25 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"You do need to carry a fire permit on you (if you plan on having a fire).

socalhiking,306za7,andino93,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:03:50 2015 UTC,"You might consider picking up one of the national forest adventure passes, but when I went I checked in with the ranger and he told me I didn't need to buy one. They're not expensive and might keep you from getting a ticket though, but it's a little unclear - he just told me it was for people using the restrooms there. The really great part about it in my opinion is that we were able to collect firewood and have a campfire, which is rare down here. Most of the creek crossings are easy to do without getting your feet wet, but there were two crossings that required wading so be prepared for that. It's not very strenuous and there's no reason not get out there and enjoy. Highly recommended.  *ETA yes - I forgot about the fire permit, sorry, that is an important detail."

But if you're asking this question I'm guessing you haven't done much of this kind of stuff before, and given that I assume you're in Orange County based on your user name, I'm going to agree with the recommendation by /u/nurdburg of Spruce Grove.  Make sure you have an adventure pass for your car or park in the pack station lot for $5."

socalhiking,301j7h,sexlexia_survivor,3,Mon Mar 23 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the reasoning behind doing this. It wont be a through street, theres no parking lot, it doesn't have any kind of destination. Is this just so more cars can park along the road up there? If so isn't the point of this so people visiting the park can have more places to park? So they are eating into the parks attractions so more people can park to enjoy the attractions...   This doesn't add up, someone has something to gain monetarily from this going through. Theres just no other reason for it."
socalhiking,301j7h,tylorjams,2,Mon Mar 23 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"This is what I am thinking from everything I have heard so far. I could be completely wrong. I think the car traffic will eventually go from the tunnel, up mt hollywood, and loop back around via vista del valle. Currently, all of vista del valle and mt hollywood are closed off to traffic.   ""So they are eating into the parks attractions so more people can park to enjoy the attractions...""  and i think you nailed it with this one."

socalhiking,303pz6,jasnooo,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:44:16 2015 UTC,depends on the year... but you might want to get some cleats because you're probably going to need them.  That is about a month earlier than I'd consider hiking.

socalhiking,303pz6,kardiffkook,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:21:58 2015 UTC,Did you go up the switchbacks or the chute?
socalhiking,303pz6,jasnooo,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:31:53 2015 UTC,"Up the switchbacks, but they were so covered in snow that it was mostly forging your own way. The first time I ever did it I was so afraid of slipping on ice and falling to my death. After I glissaded down that same slope I was afraid of dying on I had no more fear."
socalhiking,303pz6,fuckyeahhiking,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:03:10 2015 UTC,"I guess if you willingly slid down the side of the mountain, that puts a potential fall on the way up into perspective, eh?"

socalhiking,2zqq4h,songforthesoil,3,Fri Mar 20 21:11:43 2015 UTC,Once you're talking day hike you're pretty much restricted to Santa Cruz or Anacapa excluding Catalina. Anacapa is way too small for any enojoyable hikes leaving Santa Cruz where you can either go to Scorpion Bay or Prisoners Harbor. Scorpion Bay offers more options on the hiking side but Prisoners has less people and has a great (required) guide-led hike through a preserve along the ocean. You can hike that section back yourself or take a boat back to Prisoners.

It's also a much longer trip out, and it's often ridiculously windy on that island. And San Miguel is still closed, so not an option."

socalhiking,2znpdz,ccrobinsusc,2,Sat Mar 21 15:20:31 2015 UTC,I did an overnight on Marion Trail in January...as general advice I'd recommend doing it as a day hike if you want to summit so that you don't have to drag up a 20+ lb pack. I'm in good shape and it still took me almost 4 hours from the trail head to Little Round Valley. By that point I was completely out of gas an decided not to summit. The overnight in itself was really nice though...just depends what you want to do. The trail is super SUPER steep though and even just a little bit of ice or refrozen snow can make it treacherous. I'd definitely bring micro spikes just in case
socalhiking,2znpdz,kiki2k,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:02:47 2015 UTC,Hi there.  I'm planning on attempting from Marion this weekend (3/28).  Any insight on trail conditions?  How was your trip?
socalhiking,2znpdz,FuckGrammar,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:17:50 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I'm not doing the hike this week.  My friend wanted to do something less intense.   I would bring microspikes and hiking poles if you have them
socalhiking,2zm0ca,feartrich,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:25:28 2015 UTC,You're not going to need mountaineering equipment on Baldy if you take the ski hut trail. Highly doubtful that you will need microspikes either but you may consider taking snow shoes and definitely poles. Not that I recommend it (I really wish I would have taken snow shoes) but I did the Ski Hut Trail in December when there was 2-4 feet of snow above the hut and I made it ok.

socalhiking,2zey5s,PineCreekCathedral,2,Wed Mar 18 06:03:53 2015 UTC,"I know a group of people that did the lower half.  They descended Ruby Canyon to meet the Piru Creek drainage and hike out towards Lake Piru where they were parked.  They said the creek walk was pretty mild and nothing to worry about. Keep in mind that this is only half of your described hike and that they are canyoneers with lots of experience in water and hiking with gear.  Map of route.  Some good info is available in the Exit portion of the Ruby Canyon beta:   At the bottom of the last rappel head downstream (RDC) until the junction with Piru Creek. There are some good sandy places here to camp on the RDC side. Or you can head a little further downstream where Piru Canyon opens up a little more and there are other options for camping.  Creek should be flowing year round. It is fed by Pyramid Lake and its required by law that they release water for the trout habitat. Therefore this is a good place to rely on for water and to camp.  To return to your exit vehicle you have several options. The first 3 miles or so will be bushwhacking along Piru Creek, staying mostly on the canyon right side, with frequent stream crossings and faint game trails to follow. You will eventually run into a now closed access road (gravel initially then turning to paved) on the canyon right side. This road will eventually lead to your shuttle vehicle at Piru Lake, about 10 miles from where Ruby Canyon runs into Piru Creek. This is the route the first descent team used.  The second option is to bushwhack as noted above until you reach the closed/abandoned USFS Blue Point Campground, about 4 miles from the Ruby Canyon/Piru Creek intersection. South of this campground there is a ""Gaging Station"" noted on maps, located at 34.5231, -118.7574. At this point re-enter the now wide/flat/mostly vegetation-free Piru Creek wash, staying on the canyon right side. Follow the wash for approximately 4 miles, staying on the west side of Piru Lake (DCR) until 34.479007, -118.759937. At this point leave the shoreline and hike west approx. 1/3 mile to your shuttle vehicle. This option is several miles shorter without the elevation gain/loss you will encounter on the paved road, and will allow you to carry much less water as you will be in the vicinity of Piru Creek the entire hike.  It should be noted that after Blue Point Campground there is a private ranch on the west side of the road. Do not trespass onto their property.    EDIT - plug for /r/canyoneering"

When I'm go, I'm one of the naked people. :-)  There are two main ways to get there: Bowen Ranch or Bradford Ridge.   Bowen ranch is a shorter hike, but a longer drive from LA. If you park at the ranch, you have to pay $5 per person. (More if you're staying the night.) Bradford Ridge is a longer hike (still less than three miles each way though). And it's free to park. Both ways are steep, but Bradford Ridge is probably steeper.   The hot springs themselves are great if they're not crowded, but these days the weekends tend to get a lot of rowdy inconsiderate people who smoke in the pools, don't pick up their trash, etc.   And yes, I've heard stories of stuff being stolen and confrontations between nudists (who are responsible for building the pools in the first place) and insecure people who freak out over seeing a penis.  Bring lots of water, a flashlight (because you'll lose track of time and then realize that the sun's going down and you still have to hike out), a trash bag (because your fee for coming here is to leave it in better shape than it was when you got there), and an open mind (because making fun of nudists and ""hippies"" is rude)."
socalhiking,2zer1v,robbbbb,3,Wed Mar 18 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"Although it is a really sweet area, I've had some problems.   First, you aren't technically allowed to camp there but everyone does anyway. So there's a chance of rangers showing up but I've never heard of it happening.   Second, the hippies. I'm a very open minded guy, I can handle the gratuitous nudity, but things go missing every damn time I stay there. Keep a close eye on your stuff and be ready to see some balls. And blatant drug use.   Other than that, the warm water is great at night and there's a clean water source on site(I still filter it). It can get busy but I would recommend going."
socalhiking,2zer1v,stateoftheonion,3,Tue Mar 17 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"It's a fairly short, easy hike. Bring a light if you're going to return after dark as you can take a wrong fork and end up far from where you parked. Make sure you take the 15 and not the route Google maps gave me once that put me in the hills up in big bear. Many balls of all sorts will be seen. Friendly people, but I've never camped there. You could probably even find a drug filled orgy if you were looking for it, based on what people have offered me in the past.  Oh yeah, and the hot springs are pretty nice, and clean."

We ended up hiking an extra two miles or so, and the other guys didn't get their car out until almost sundown."

We all had to sit on strange people's laps while he drove us out. At one point he had my sister hold the steering wheel while he hit a bong they were all passing around. It was a terrifying ride back, but an interesting memory!"
socalhiking,2zer1v,illaparatzo,2,Wed Mar 18 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"I was there a week and a half ago. It was a beautiful hike in and once you get there its a ton of fun. The river water is pretty chilly right now, but the springs themselves range from super hot to about bath water temperature. Theres a spot where you can fill your water bottles straight from a crack in the rock wall (though its pretty hot, so you have to let it cool in the river). Like Other people have said, there are naked people. But, thats not really a huge deal to me. For a lot of people it's a really spiritual place where they can feel close to nature. A lot of people do shrooms there, and they're pretty generous if you're into that. There is a slackline which is pretty fun, a rope swing (nothing too crazy) and a place where you can jump off the rocks into the river."

Get out on the trail at 5:15 or so and watch the sun come up.  I doubt you'll see many other people.  Some people can hit the trail at 6am... seems like very few try to get there before that.   I'm weary of sharing this tip - it's my best trick for keeping sane in SoCal and I'd hate to see more people out there... but most people can't/won't keep that kind of schedule.

Higher elevations and longer trails will get you more solitude. Get on summitpost and find random HPS hikes that you've never heard of, or alternate routes to other peaks that may be more difficult or longer and thus less traveled.  I suggest: Lookout Mtn #2, Williamson-Goodykoontz Loop--Route 2 as listed on that page, and Rattlesnake Peak--I've done all these in the past few months and saw no one else. Or hit up Los Padres. The farther out/higher up I go, the more I meet thru-hikers rather than day hikers--I like this!"
socalhiking,2z3p7x,lydiacostume,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Bear Canyon Trail starts right off the South side of Ortega Highway (74) in the Cleveland National Forest. Been a few years since I hiked out to Four Corners but not many people hike up there and it's only about 15-20 minutes inland from San Juan Capistrano and the 5 freeway. There is a lot of traffic on Ortega highway, even midweek, which kind of kills the atmosphere but once you get a little ways out onto a trail you likely won't see or hear anyone for most of the day. When I went in I think 2010 I only saw one group of 2 hikers for the half day I was out. The only catch is that it is Mountain Lion territory (despite the trail name there are no bears), but statistically speaking I believe you're much more likely to get struck by lightning than to ever knowingly encounter a mountain lion. :)"
socalhiking,2z04ki,delarhi,3,Sat Mar 14 08:36:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I did Wilson via Mira Monte this morning. Great job! I'm not surprised it kicked your butt, it's an absolute butt kicker. It's steeper and longer than doing Wilson from Chantry Flats.  You're actually in luck, I calculated elevation grades yesterday to get an idea of the steepness of the hikes I do regularly.   Baldy via Ski Hut (4.5mi, 3900ft) = 16.4% Baldy via Backbone (7.8mi, 3900ft) = 9.5% Wilson via Mira (7mi, 4700ft) = 12.7%   I won't bother talking about Baldy via Backbone since its fairly clear the incline is not too difficult compared to Wilson. Also, a lot of it is fire road so it can be quite boring, monotonous and not particularly scenic on a large stretch in the beginning going up.  The difference in steepness between Baldy via Ski Hut vs Wilson might seem drastic but keep in mind that there are long stretches of flat walking on Wilson which bring that elevation grade on Wilson down. The actual steep sections on Wilson (i.e. the first 1.5mi to First Water and especially Orchard Camp to Manzanita Ridge) are fairly comparable to the second half of Baldy via Ski Hut. Doing Baldy via Ski Hut is nice compared to Wilson because the first half up to reaching the actual Ski Hut is a fairly gradual incline and gives you a chance to warm up. The second half of that hike is where majority of the steepness is. There are 2 or 3 sections that are just a bit steeper than anything you'd find on Wilson but they are in relatively short stretches (keep in mind Baldy via Ski Hut is only 4.5mi one way and the more intense steepness is really only in the second half).  That said, assuming weather conditions are favorable on both, the X factor is the altitude on Baldy. Some people have a hard time dealing with the thinner air so you might find yourself struggling a bit to catch your breathe as you near the 10,000ft summit.  Now more to your point, I've done Baldy several different ways including up Ski Hut down Backbone (as I believe you intend on doing). I, myself, am not particularly bothered by altitude or steepness. What does bother me a tiny bit is long distance, especially on out and back type trails where the views aren't the most scenic and things can get a bit redundant and boring.   How long did Wilson take you? What was your pace like and how often did you stop?  TL;DR - The bottom line is I guess I think Wilson via Mira Monte is more difficult than the Baldy Loop if snow and altitude aren't factors during the hike."
socalhiking,2z04ki,acokiko,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the great info!  I haven't had to deal with high altitudes yet so I don't know how I'll handle it. I'm guessing though I'll be affected by it, especially since my lungs have never been a strong point of mine (had asthma as a kid, but it's been in remission for years now).  My pace was pretty poor since I purposefully tried to take it slow for the sake of completing the hike. I think I ended up doing something like 30 minutes a mile. Really I was in no condition to tackle it, but finishing the hike has been on my mind for a while. I took five minute breathers maybe once an hour just to snack and drink.  I think for now I'm going to keep conditioning on Mt. Wilson and some overnighters through Gabrielino before moving on to bigger hikes.  Thanks again."

Baldy a bunch of times.  It looks like Chantry flat starts at 2000 ft. above sea level while Mira Monte starts at 1000 ft., so you went a more challenging route than I usually do.  I'd say Baldy is about 30% harder than the Chantry flat route, so possibly only slightly harder than the way you went.  If you're not used to it you will feel the elevation at 10,000 ft., whereas Mt. Wilson isn't high enough to really start feeling the effects of elevation."
socalhiking,2z04ki,fieldsofkale69,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:31:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight! I think I might need to condition on Mt. Wilson a bit more before trying Baldy.

Unfortunately you're paying someone for a service, a service that requires 24/7 commitment for between 5 and 30 days.  If that is their job, or they need to take time off from another job, then even at minimum wage a person can justifiably charge $1080 for a 5-day trip.  You're also paying for their experience, skill transfer and education, event planning and coordination, and shared or rental gear.  If you still want to price-compare I'd hit up the major Meetups down here and ask for a weeklong trip or event.  For the most part, those will be free (excluding permits, transportation, food, and gear).  I'm not an expert guide like Viesturs but wouldn't feel bad about charging a client $300/day for a guided weekend trip."

Made friends for life, traveled to unnamed glaciers, went ice climbing, paddled ~220 miles with glaciers... etc etc 2 I did a bit of camping, but to be honest, everyone starts off as a beginner and learns the NOLS way (Nerds Outdoors Losing Shit)... So as long as you are comfortable being cold/outside you should be fine. Mountaineering + Sea Kayaking Its really how hard you push yourself ... NOLS is a team, you live as a team, and die as a team. No one ""quits"" (well almost ... ) Some of my hardest and some of my best times were on the trip for sure though. It gives great perspective. Yes ... but they will typically self select and leave.

Ugh thank you so much  I did experience a minor case of hypothermia almost 2 years ago that was left untreated, would they insist that I see a doctor about it before I can go on any trips?   I asked about people leaving because I am afraid I will want to give up, but I know that once I get over my negative thinking I'll be good to go. If I want to leave, will people encourage me to stay or is it a quiet and personal decision?   My dad used to work as a fisherman in Alaska when he was in college, and he told me stories of Alaska all the time when I was a baby. I wrote fairytales about living in isolation in Alaska and discovering a shiny white horse in its wilderness. I've also never seen a moose, and their size is something I refuse to to and comprehend until I can see it in person. Also, grizzly bears. Also, there is something so raw about deserts and tundras, it emotionally brings me to my bones, if that makes any sense :/"
socalhiking,2yvefy,whitecompass,2,Fri Mar 13 23:35:01 2015 UTC,Depending where in California you are Sierra Club has various options that include both outings and classes and are generally low or no cost.  We're currently just finishing up with the annual Wilderness Travel Course in LA / OC but there's everything from local hikes to Sierra backpacks to more technical outings to international trips year round.  Everything is led by volunteers certified by the club to lead at various levels so it's somewhat of a middle ground between paid guides and just going with friends or meetups.

socalhiking,2ylksm,The_Xozz,3,Tue Mar 10 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"That would be Triplet Rocks out of the Waterman area. As long as there is no snow on the north side of Twin Peaks or if you want to use crampons it would be doable now. This is not a hike, once you reach the top of Twin Peaks, this is a constant scramble as well as a brushfest at the end. With the large bouldering required it also becomes challenging as far as direction to travel. This is considered the hardest place to get to in the San Gabes. You can read more about it at Summit Post. I would recommend you first try an easier traverse such as San Antonio Ridge from either Manker or Heaton Flats. The strongest hikers required a full 10-12 hour day to do this hike, not recommended unless you're very strong and used to mixed climbing with brushfest stamina. The forest service has already had to rescue one hiker who decided to just give it a try."

socalhiking,2ydluj,acokiko,6,Sun Mar 8 22:07:52 2015 UTC,Pretty much any big hikes with a lot of elevation gain.   C2c has either 7-10k gain depending on if you go on to san jack.  Should do at least one hike with 4000k ft gain or more the week before to season your legs.
socalhiking,2ydluj,scottawr,5,Mon Mar 9 04:21:42 2015 UTC,"This site should have everything you need to plan your hike:  http://www.mtsanjacinto.info/skyline/skyline.html  We slept out by our cars the night before the hike.  When you set up your car shuttle though, don't sleep at the tram station.  Sleep at the Art Museum.  Otherwise, when you're ready to drive down to the art museum in the middle of the night, you'll find locked gates.  I wish someone would have mentioned that when I did my online research, because we made this mistake a few months ago when we did C2C.  We ended up having to run several bonus miles to get to the main road where our friend could pick us up to start our run.  We were trail runners, so we went as light as possible.  None of us carried a first aid kit.  As far as that goes, you need to decide how much risk you're willing to accept.  There's always a tradeoff.  There is water to be had at the ranger station near the top of the tram, so you can count on being able to refill there.  The only permit you need, you will be able to get at that same ranger station.  It's easy and doesn't require planning.  Bring a map of the trails from the top of the tram.  As far as what time you should start, I would look at the forecast and adjust accordingly.  If it looks like it will be a hot day, I might even start at 1am just to give me some buffer to get to the higher elevations before it gets too hot.  Starting mid April, I would check with the rangers each week to find out when the snow has melted enough to make the trail safe and passable.  There's a restaurant at the top of the tram where you can get burgers and beer at the end of the hike."
socalhiking,2ydluj,nenox,2,Mon Mar 9 01:09:43 2015 UTC,You're incredible!!! Thank you so much. I've noted all of your advice.
socalhiking,2ydluj,nenox,6,Mon Mar 9 03:44:31 2015 UTC,Here is my GPS track if you're interested.  https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/629186405
socalhiking,2ydluj,nenox,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely interested. Thanks for sharing. What kind of watch/device did you use to record this info? I've been considering getting something like this myself.  What would you say is a realistic pace/completion time for people who aren't trail running? How many breaks did you take? Did you pack actual meals and stop to eat or did you just take a bunch of high energy snacks and kind of ate as you moved? Your split times look like something I could manage for a 10-12 mile hike but I doubt I could sustain for twice that distance, which is what C2C would be. Based on your splits, its clear you ran the whole way down but as for going up, how much of it was steady hiking, how much of it was power hiking, and how much of it was jogging? Is C2C as steep as people make it out to be or is it mostly just the distance that makes it so challenging?"
socalhiking,2ydluj,HikingFool,2,Mon Mar 9 05:07:57 2015 UTC,"Garmin and Suunto are the major GPS watch makers you want to look into.  I would look for a watch that has the battery life that will cover the activities that I want to do.  If you regularly go on epic hikes like C2C, run 50 mile ultra marathons or full Ironmans, then you'll want something that will go up to 18 hours.  On the Garmin side, that will limit your choices to the 310xt, 910xt, 920xt, and their Fenix line.  For Suunto, most ultra runners will choose something from their Ambit line.  If you run 100 milers, or if you would like to track a multi-day backpacking trip, then one other feature that you might want is the ability to charge the watch with an external battery while it's still tracking the current activity.  On the Garmin side, that would rule out the 620 and the 920 because those devices stop tracking as soon as you start charging.    TLDR; Get the 310xt if you're looking for bang for buck.  (That's the watch that was used to track my C2C hike.) Get the Fenix3 if you're looking for the newest and shiniest. (My next watch.)  Somebody else posted their hike info in this thread also, so you can get a sense of the differences.  I'd say that anywhere from 11-13 hours to get from Art Museum-Jacinto Peak-Tram is reasonable for anybody who can do the Ski Hut trail in the way you described earlier.  We stopped many times on the way up to rest.  You can probably guess when we stopped by looking at my pace.  We were also just hiking normally.  Not speed hiking.  At no point between the museum and tram did we go faster than hiking speed, but we did run/jog some of the flat section on top as well as most of the way down.  In addition to breakfast before the hike started, I packed two 740ml bike bottles of liquid calories that I made from my normal trail running powder (Perpeteum) at 200 calories each bottle.  I also brought two packs of chews.  There was also 2 liters of water in my water bladder.  Looking back, I should have brought more food.  My friend broke out a package of beef jerky and a bag of almonds on the summit that really hit the spot.  If not for that, I would have been pretty hungry and energy depleted coming down.  I wouldn't say that C2C is any more steep than most of the trails in SoCal.  Iron Mountain is much a much steeper ass kicker.  I think this particular hike gets it notoriety from the total gain of 10k+ feet, the fact that you summit the second highest peak in SoCal, the relatively long distance, and the potentially dangerously hot temperatures.  And it has an amazing name.  Cactus to Clouds."
socalhiking,2ydluj,Gabrcruz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:54:02 2015 UTC,"Shit, this post just got me extra amped to tackle this beast. Some great info man. Thank you so much. Yea I think well stick to bringing plenty of light snacks instead of a huge meal. Probably save that for when we finish. And I'll definitely be looking at those watch recommendations this week."
socalhiking,2ydluj,Gabrcruz,5,Mon Mar 9 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"To start out with, check out register ridge up baldy. It's a short section that connects the ski hut trail with the Devils backbone trail, just below mount harwood. It's 2500 elevation in 2 miles 1250 feet per mile  and complete the baldy loop ending on any trail you choose. Hike baldy from the village. 12 miles 6k elevation 1k per mile, but on a much longer section. Iron mountain from bridge to nowhere parking lot. 14 miles, 7k gain up to 1250 elevation per mile near the top. Descriptions should be available online. The first 9 miles to the tram is by far the hardest section for me. It's almost 1k feet per mile and longer than any other training hike of similar elevation gain. Though I'm sore and tired coming back down for the summit, there just isn't any warm up at the beginning.  Start early, carb up the day before, hydrate the day before, no alcohol, and get a good nights rest. Join www.meetup.com many groups (including the groups I belong to and lead with) will be  doing these type of hikes in preparation for our own c2cs. That way you can go places you might not be familiar with experienced people, and make new friends.  Or just message me or several others you find active on this sub reddit. The community of long distance hikers is vast,  awesome, and extremely friendly."

socalhiking,2ydluj,HikingFool,5,Mon Mar 9 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with every posted here and would suggest downloading those tracks, digital topography map or taking a hard copy. Another suggestion to add onto is do long distance hikes and high elevation hikes often. If you can complete ski-hut trail (elevation) there and back in under four hours, hike Wilson via fire road (distance) in seven hours RT, and do San G in 8 hours (elevation and distance) via Vivian creek all with minimum breaks, you'll be solid. And this is all with minimum running/jogging so add that in and you can probably cut the time down."
socalhiking,2ydluj,FirstNameAsALast,2,Mon Mar 9 19:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much. I'm planning on doing Wilson this weekend! Is Wilson via the fireroad the one that starts at Mira Monte street in Sierra Madre or the one that starts at Chantry? I've only done the one that starts at Mira Monte (the one that passes First Water). If I remember reading about them right, Mira Monte is more difficult than Chantry since its longer and has greater elevation gain(14+mi, 4500+ft elevation gain). Is this the one you're referring to?  I think last time it took me around 5.5-6hrs RT, and that includes a 20-30min lunch at the top and a stop or two to change in and out of rain gear. I remember thinking that I wished I had a lighter pack so I could comfortably jog back down. But I was still able to maintain a brisk pace. Going at that pace though I was definitely tired by the end which is why the idea of adding another 4000ft and 7+miles up (which is what C2C would be) is a bit intimidating to me. Although, I'm not really experiencing post hike soreness in the days following 14+ mile hikes with gear anymore so I think that should be encouraging right?  I'll definitely track my time this weekend. I think San G will be the better test for me. Looking forward to seeing if my friends and I can do the sub 8hr time you suggest for San G.  Thanks again bud!"
socalhiking,2ydluj,nenox,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:43:22 2015 UTC,"The 8 hours for San G is with ideal conditions. Took our group 15 hours in snow yesterday (they take more pics and breaks than I'm accustomed to).   Your ski hut time is solid even in those conditions. Not being too sore following 14 miles hikes is great, that not only means you're building the muscles, but that you're also eating and drinking right before, during and after a hike. Kudos   The start for Wilson you're mentioning is the old Wilson trail that begins in Sierra Madres. The fire road/old Wilson toll road begins in Altadena/Pasadena.

I started at 6am and was the only one up there when I summited around 9. I saw a couple large groups on my way back down and one group just chilling on the bench on Manzanita on my descent at like 930. Was that you guys?

socalhiking,2ydjqm,kardiffkook,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:50:33 2015 UTC,Did they maybe close it because of the storm last week in case of flooding? Barker valley is awesome but not someplace you'd want to be while its raining
socalhiking,2ydjqm,i_dont_wash_my_hands,1 point,Mon Mar 9 07:47:42 2015 UTC,That's what we are thinking.  The forest service webpage shows it as open but who knows how often that is updated.

I believe you can still hike up the Palomar divide to get to the spur, they only are restricting vehicle access.

socalhiking,2y9y7t,redstarjedi,2,Sun Mar 8 07:05:51 2015 UTC,"You need a permit to hike Mt. Whitney, but because it is a popular destination there is a limited number of permits per day. There is a lottery to decide who gets permits.  Basically during the lottery period (I forget specifically when the dates are) You submit the dates you want to go. You are not prioritized for when in that period you applied. You can list up to I think 12 alternative dates in case you don't get the dates you wanted.  After the lottery period is over, everyone who applied is selected at random for each date to see if they receive a permit or not."

socalhiking,2y9y7t,it_refugee,2,Thu Mar 12 02:23:01 2015 UTC,They have rangers patrolling. The permit gives you a tag to put on your pack. If they ask to see your actual permit you need to have it with you.  I definitely was asked for mine when I went so I'm assuming they are pretty strict on it.

socalhiking,2xtot7,PorkchopSammiches,2,Tue Mar 3 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"The best map resources are http://openstreetmap.org and http://caltopo.com  OSM is an open map data project, akin to wikipedia but for maps. Caltopo is an interface that lets you see different map data sources together. OSM shows multiple trails in Weir Canyon and in Irvine, but doesn't show anything crossing the power lines. Aerial imagery clearly shows that there are routes there. So you should check those out and add them to OSM!"
socalhiking,2xtot7,dima55,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks! I just checked out OST and there doesn't seem to be any official route for MtS Trail up past Lower Peters Canyon when the Peters Canyon Trail and MtS Trail converge.  I do see a few tendrils of MtS Trail jutting out from the main route, especially around Harvard Trail. So maybe that's how they calculate 22 miles of trail, therefore traversing point-to-point will not be 22 miles.  If that's the case I'll start at Irvine Regional"
socalhiking,2xtot7,dima55,2,Tue Mar 3 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Ah. Since OSM is an open project, there are many sites using the data, and you can do routing on some of them. Here's the route from the furthest point where OSM has data before the power lines to some arbitrary point on the bay:  https://en.komoot.de/tour/4314553  This route is 21.5 miles. Extending it up to Weir Canyon would bump it up to 22 and change, but somebody needs to add that data first."

I'd say the best thing to do in order to try and get a group going is to tell which peak, a date and time with 2+ week notice. Perhaps mention a pace as well so that people know whether or not you'll accommodate the slow pokes. Big groups are fun but often slower, so we should plan ahead and get a good early start so that when things drag a bit it won't mess up anyone's schedule."

socalhiking,2wygep,unknownkoger,2,Tue Feb 24 07:13:39 2015 UTC,"It's pretty straight forward and very popular, so you would be around people. If you're doing the ski hut trail though, the trailhead may be easy to miss if you're not paying attention"
socalhiking,2wygep,tisnotwhatitseems,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:00:55 2015 UTC,"I can second that it's pretty straight forward. The only tricky parts are noticing the Ski Hut trail at the beginning, it sneaks up on your left. The other part that wasn't completely straight forward was the last quarter of the Baldy Trail before you get to the summit. There seems to be a lot trail ""options"" but as long as you are going up you'll make it to the summit. Going down the Devil's backbone trail is very straight forward. This resource helped me a lot.http://www.hikespeak.com/trails/mount-baldy/ I took some screen shots on my phone so I could reference them during the hike. It's an awesome way to spend a day off! Just get started early, I was on the trail at 8:30, and in the car by 4 and i was definitely going at a leisurely pace."
socalhiking,2wygep,behemuthm,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"I found the trail head to be the most confusing part. It's not really marked all that clearly.

socalhiking,2wuqjk,FirstNameAsALast,2,Mon Feb 23 08:20:51 2015 UTC,I have hiked it three times. It is mainly a long fireroad hike until you get to the Gold Creek saddle. From there you take the old overgrown trail towards the connector with the Mendenhall Ridge. When you reach the saddle between 4441 and McKinley climb the steep firebreak to the summit. You can make a longer route by connecting to the fireroad and then ascending Iron and coming back via Trail Canyon. I'm not sure the shape of the deteriorating trail to Mendenhall from McKinley but the rest of the route should be straightforward.

All of the resources I've seen agree that there is a trail between Zuma Ridge and Encinal, and that it crosses private land; some say that it's closed to public use, others say that it's open.  From what I've read, the last mile of the trail between Mulholland and Yerba Buena/Little Sycamore (i.e., the mile immediately east of Yerba Buena) is closed; it's privately owned, and the landowner has put up gates to keep people out. The NPS is asking people to stay off of that while they try to negotiate something with the landowner. It's open from Mulholland up to that point, though.  Hope that helps."

socalhiking,2vun6g,marylou5,3,Thu Feb 19 00:18:46 2015 UTC,"We did the South Fork Trail.  http://www.sgwa.org/trails2.htm  There are two spots for the overnight before summiting I would recommend, either Dry lake or Dollar Lake. Dry lake seems a little easier to get to. As of 2/14/15, there is a ton of snow and ice up there. I HIGHLY recommend microspikes or crampons with trekking poles. A group of other backpackers used Dry lake as the base camp and went up to summit with their crampons. You should be able to easily get a permit. I always fax one in a couple days before I go and I have not been rejected. And be sure to get the permit, everytime ive been up there, I have been stopped by rangers.

socalhiking,2vgoev,bassheadjones,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:06:42 2015 UTC,"6 hours, I'd go to Sequoia National Forest, find and open fire road, and cruise until I found a nice camp spot. Bonus is a nice little jeep trail near Big Meadow that most 4x4s can handle.  2 hours, I'd head to Mr. Pinos/Frazier Park. If your vehicle has good clearance and you know how to handle it on a more serious trail, you could do the Miller/Lockwood jeep trail, and it ends at a pretty nice campground that rarely has anyone there. Under 2 hours, I'd aim for Lupine Camp in the San Gabriels. The road to it is most likely closed this time of year, but even when it's open the camp is rarely visited, owing to the road being pretty bad.  Other than that, check some desert areas, I hear great things, but I am not familiar."

socalhiking,2v1u5h,Gabrcruz,4,Sat Feb 7 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"Mount Baldy Conditions from today's hike via the Ski Hut Trail:  There is no snow or ice until you hit the ~8000' elevation mark (after ski hut). Crampons or snow boots are recommended for some parts of the trail. Microspikes did not help very much because the snow was slushy. What used to be snow-ice-snow-ice, is not a plush snow with melting ice. I would recommend taking any traction device possible and poles if you got em. Temps today were low 30's at summit with 18mph winds and gusts up to 36mph. Windchill was somewhere between 28-33 degrees. At times it felt okay, but once I hit the ridge it was cold especially in shady areas. Lower elevations were around 45-55 degrees so bring layers and be ready to shed/put them on throughout the hike. As far as traction devices go, there were sections where you needed them, but a good half-mile stretch where you didn't. I would suggest just leaving them on. That worked best for me because I stop very little but if you like to stop and take in views then feel free to put them on or take em off at your comfort. Snow depth in some areas up to a foot. In most areas, 2-5 inches at most. I slipped a few times coming down so be careful if you like to trot or speed downhill. Let me know if you have any questions."

Going back tomorrow, but with microspikes.  I called the ranger station today, and it sounded like pretty similar conditions, nothing crazy, but a pretty solid layer of ice the higher up you go.  Worse comes to worse just start, be smart, and if it gets dicey turn around."

socalhiking,2u5wpd,Homozygoat,3,Fri Jan 30 04:20:07 2015 UTC,Oh since I posted my other comment I think I figured out how to do it via the Los Liones trail:   Secret Trail -> Calabasas Peak -> Calabasas Peak trail to Stunt road. Cross road and take the trail that starts right there that goes down and up to meet stunt road again. Cross the road and continue on the segment of trail that keeps going past the road. Cross stunt road one more time -> turn left at the backbone trail. Take the backbone trail past the overlook and down Hondo canyon to Old Topanga Canyon road. Take any of a number of routes to the northern trailhead for the Los Liones trail which will take you to the ocean!

socalhiking,2u5wpd,thatguyron,2,Fri Jan 30 05:27:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'd never considered the idea.  I did a ton of hikes around there back in High School (went to school in Calabasas) and I'm pretty sure I've done at least 2/3 of such a route in sections, but never as a through hike.  You'd probably have to travel on a few paved road sections but I'd like to think it's possible.  Presumably you'd start with the ""secret trail"" to Calabasas peak, and then continue on the main trail down to Stunt Road.  Then you'd take any of a number of routes to the backbone trail.  The only question here would be how to link from there to any of the trails coming up from the ocean.  From the coast I've gone up Solstice creek before and a couple other trails in that area but I'm not sure if or how they connect to anything further up."
socalhiking,2txtyr,feartrich,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:52:09 2015 UTC,Really love hiking in the PMC area. The Enchanted Forest trail is breathtaking when it snows. It's a shame it has been so dry lately.
socalhiking,2tvxkg,staycruzin,9,Tue Jan 27 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"You are going to need water. I like to fill up my bladder to the max when I go out. And have Platypus stuffed everywhere I can. Side pouches, either side of my bladder. I will forgo creature comforts just to carry another water bottle.  Open fires are right out. I love my Jet Boil. It is very compact and the fuel fits inside the cooking container.  You can overnight camp from any back country board. A good starter backpack would be Pine City near the Desert Queen mine. It is flat-ish and short and lots of rocks to climb around on. And it is popular enough that if you get in trouble people will be near by."

socalhiking,2tvxkg,dubflip,3,Wed Jan 28 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"If you want challenging, maybe try bolder ing instead of hiking.  Climb to the top of one of the massive rock piles / hills.   You can get to the top of almost any of them without climbing anything.    Because it is the desert, make sure to stay hydrated, pack warm, and tell someone where you are going!"

socalhiking,2tvxkg,somedudeinlosangeles,5,Wed Jan 28 02:12:40 2015 UTC,"I've camped on the boy scouts trail. It's pretty neat. The scenery changes quite a bit throughout the trail, really pretty cool. If you start from indian cove you can hike south and after about 5 miles the trail splits. If you continue on it, you could hike down to willow hole. No camping allowed in this area but I've heard it's cool to check out. Camping is pretty much restricted to areas east of the Boy Scouts trail I think. Grab a map that shows wilderness areas and day use areas. As others have said, bring water. There's no water available out there. I did one night and brought about 7 liters. Wayy to much, but it was my first time packing water. Permitting is easy. Go to back country board, fill out available slip, take half and deposit the other half into the box and you're set. Leaving from indian cove free, entry to the heart of the park is 15."

socalhiking,2tvxkg,nept_r,5,Wed Jan 28 03:52:58 2015 UTC,Protip: Freeze plastic liter bottles of water and put them in your pack before you head out. The water melts quickly but stays cold for quite a long time. Having cold water when you wake up the next morning in the desert is the best.
socalhiking,2tvxkg,yocharlie,5,Tue Jan 27 23:56:13 2015 UTC,"I just have to say that backpacking Joshua tree isn't the best idea for a new backpacker. Sure it can be done safely, and I'm not trying to discourage you,  but if you have to ask what type of gear to bring, it is a big red flag to me. Joshua tree is a desert, and people often GROSSLY underestimate how much water they'll need. Quick overnight with less miles isn't so bad, but it sounds like you are trying to go ""harder"" than that. Until you have done some day hikes in the desert, I'd recommend erring on the side of caution. Take it easy, bring more water than you could use (1 gallon per person per day is often the recommended amount). Don't go crazy on your first trip. It's very different from traditional hikes.    TL;DR Joshua tree is amazing, but it may not be the best idea for a first backpacking trip to ""step it up"". If you do it, bring lots of water, hike less than you normally would, and be safe."
socalhiking,2tvxkg,JoshuaTreeNPS,3,Fri Jan 30 04:44:26 2015 UTC,Boy Scout trail was my first backpacking trail and is great! You can camp anywhere off the main trail. Definitely bring a cambel back and water.
socalhiking,2tvxkg,rbronzan,2,Wed Jan 28 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Water, a map and a compass (and the knowledge of how to use them both), water, layers of clothing, pocket-sized camera, a ""Leave No Trace"" ethic, a hiking buddy,...and last but not least, plenty of water.  The previously mentioned trails (BS and CH&R) are a great place to start researching. You might also consider following one of the 4x4 roads through the park. Old Dale, Black Eagle Mine, and Pinkham Canyon Roads aren't well traveled by vehicles so you would still be able to get a good trail-like experience. As long as you set up camp at least a mile from the road, you'll be within park regulations. -BTS"

The last couple years have been pretty dry but in spring of 2013 I came down the rim trail from mount Wilson on the north facing slopes and had to micro spike through a ton of snow. The snow went all the way down to Newcombe pass at 4122 feet. I wasn't seriously hiking before fall of 2012 though so I'm not sure how it was previous to that. I do remember getting a bit of snow at my parents house in Southern Arcadia when I was a kid though.

socalhiking,2t770h,KaiserHSoze,2,Wed Jan 21 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"Hi daya. I second www.meetup.com when my friends started falling off as my hikes grew longer, thankfully I found meetup and made tons of new friends. Now I run into people I know all the time on popular hikes. What are the stats of your typical hikes? I can recommend several meetup groups depending on your interests. There are definitely backpacking groups too but a lot of clubs that do mostly day hikes also camp and backpack. I also post some of the hikes and backpacking trips I do in this sub reddit as well. I've hiked and backpacked with several redditors and am most active on this board as well as /r/joshuatree. I do easy 2-5 mile one night overnights as well as 40+ mile multiday treks.  You and your friends are welcome on most trips I do as long as you feel physically up to whatever I'm doing"

socalhiking,2t4ohl,rallison,2,Wed Jan 21 03:13:52 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was trying to decide where to hike this week and decided to go do Williamson/Pleasant View Ridge/Goodykoontz because of this!
socalhiking,2t4ohl,lydiacostume,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:21:34 2015 UTC,Awesome! The trail conditions going up were 98% dry with just a few sections crossing snow. The main snow was once you hit the peak and the ridge.   This should give you an idea of what the ridge was looking like: https://www.google.com/maps/views/view/111004183840840391992/gphoto/6105601803673914866
socalhiking,2t4ohl,lydiacostume,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"Whew, I wish I had just stopped at Williamson, it got more treacherous as I tried to press on; I ended up abandoning the trail because it was too icy and I had left my spikes in the car like an IDIOT. I learned a couple of good lessons that day and now have an interesting story to tell, but I need to get back out there and finish that trail!"
socalhiking,2t4ohl,lydiacostume,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:26:25 2015 UTC,Indeed! Conditions were definitely sketchier when I was there once you passed Williamson. We ended up going cross country on the south facing snow-less side of the ridge coming back to avoid the sketchy spots.  Which day did you go up there?
socalhiking,2t4xi7,aChipmunk,2,Wed Jan 21 04:27:22 2015 UTC,"The camp spots in the Angeles National Forest accessible by parking at Chantry flat are all very tame and easy for a 1st timer (especially Hoegees campground).  The best thing would be to find an experienced backpacking friend to go with you, but honestly the camp spots there are pretty near civilization so worst case if you realize you forgot to bring water or something you can just hike back to the car and do the 5 minute drive to civilization.  It's also a 10 minute drive to REI from the parking lot there, which is convenient.  If you plan to continue I'd go ahead and get at least a sleeping bag but if you're going to rent something the tent is a good candidate.  The pack could go either way in my opinion."
socalhiking,2t4xi7,thatguyron,1 point,Wed Jan 21 04:36:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I have a sleeping bag that is warm and compresses nicely, so I am thinking about taking that, investing in a pad and maybe a pack.    Are there any good resources you can point me to in terms of finding where exactly I can pitch a tent, and where to buy permits?  Thanks again for the quick response!"
socalhiking,2t4xi7,thatguyron,3,Wed Jan 21 05:07:08 2015 UTC,"You'll need an adventure pass (from REI) to park at the parking lot, or you can park at the pack station accessible from the topmost part of the parking lot for $5.  Also, the pack station website says you need a free fire permit if you want to have a fire.    The forest service says that that camping there is first come first served.  I've never camped there myself but I've hiked by a number of times and it's pretty self-explanatory where the designated sites are because they have fire rings and picnic tables."
socalhiking,2t4xi7,yurnotsoeviltwin,2,Wed Jan 21 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"Renting a pack and tent isn't a bad way to go the first time around. That way you can figure out your style without making a big commitment.  Look seriously into ultralight backpacking. The typical pattern is that beginners start out with heavy gear and over time realize that life is more fun with less on your back, so they start transitioning to ultralight. Skipping that first phase could save you a lot of money.  In the San Gabriels especially, all you really need is your day hiking kit plus a sleeping bag, pad, and tarp."

socalhiking,2t4nm0,melwhited,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"Anza is beautiful and it's good time of year to go. Never done an overnight there but from my understanding it's open to hike where you wish. State parks has a good website that should have permit info. I carry a 10L MSR dromedary backpacking in the Mojave. It weighs a ton when full and takes up lots of pack space. You may be able to get away with less because of the month, but it has been warmer than usual. Call the Rangers. They give the best advice on current conditions regarding water resources and reliability. Some resources may be reserved for wildlife only. Don't rely on anything marked as a spring on a topo map without prior confirmation. It's the desert."
socalhiking,2t4nm0,ADHiker,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:56:18 2015 UTC,Scratch the state parks site. They ruined it. I'd just call. I think many parts are technically wilderness so I'm sure you'll need a permit.
socalhiking,2t4nm0,ADHiker,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:06:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips; I will give the rangers a call. Especially regarding water availability. And wow! A 10L dromedary! That's gotta be 20+ lbs.
socalhiking,2t4nm0,SDPCT,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"Mt. Laguna in the Cleveland National Forest.  Check the weather, as long as it is warm enough at night for you, there are amazing hikes near Mt.Laguna, directly on the PCT.  I just did an overnight where I hiked 13.5 miles on Sat, starting at Penny Pines, just past the Mt Laguna Campground (PCT Mile ~48) and headed north.  Great campsites for backpacking at various spots if you want to go shorter.  This would be an out and back, but the scenery is so great, you won't mind doing it again."
socalhiking,2t4nm0,SDPCT,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:20:02 2015 UTC,Sounds nice. How was water availability along that stretch of the PCT?
socalhiking,2t2cla,BRINGBACKTHEMACHINE,2,Tue Jan 20 16:51:03 2015 UTC,Does it have to be a campsite? If you plan to backpack in and do back country camping you will definitely be able to do it. The only downside is having to haul all your water in on your back.
socalhiking,2t2cla,thatguyron,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely want to overnight"
socalhiking,2t2cla,cherokeesix,3,Tue Jan 20 19:10:48 2015 UTC,I think you misunderstood the question. You can camp outside of the designated camp areas in Joshua Tree. Only downside is it takes some walking (1/2 mile from any road I believe) and you cant have a fire.

socalhiking,2t2cla,pistol_pedro,2,Tue Jan 20 19:42:55 2015 UTC,You could always book Black Rock campground as they take reservations. If there is space at Jumbo Rocks then taking the cancellation fee hit isn't too bad. Black Rock also has flushing toilets which is good for first time campers!  If you do find something at Jumbo Rocks then make sure you do cancel so someone else can use your pitch.

socalhiking,2ssxtc,Gabrcruz,2,Sun Jan 18 04:41:54 2015 UTC,"Hey dude. You can get a permit at the mill creek ranger station on your way to the hike. If you call them today, you can have them leave the permit outside for you. You'd have to pass the ranger station on the drive in anyways. I'm assuming you are starting where I did which is angelus oaks near the fire station. You got my number so call me if you have more questions than I answer here. I believe the hike was 15 miles to just sb peak but with an extra mile or so, you could tag sb east as well. This is honestly one oft favorite hikes you start in the alpine and beautiful views and epic trees the whole way up. You could get to sb and sb east starting at momyer, but that's not nearly as scenic a trail and the shortest way up requires you to use an overgrown unmaintained use trail (I've accidentally done it haha) wish I had Monday off to hike with you as it's been like 9 months since I last did sb peak :/"

Permit system is not 'regulated' much at all, but the permits are pretty easy to get so I suggest just apply for one JUST IN CASE. I did Gorgonio via Vivian in like may or June and there were WAY too many people at Half-way point camp ground. I kind of wish it was regulated more. The saddle was probably less populated due to the wind and lack of water.   I kind of get all those hikes in that area a bit jumbled. I think Gorgonio via Vivian is supposed to be the hardest, right? It also depends which way you plan to take San Bernardino."

There is NO water at the top anywhere along the ridge. I either bring plenty of water from home or get water from the Stough nature center if i come up from that way. I don't know if the other access points have water, i doubt it though.

socalhiking,2sg5dz,viabrera,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:10:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are open year round, winter is a fantastic time to go. It is beautiful up there, and very few people. They are great about posting current conditions on their website. If you aren't planning on entering the back country, you should be fine without heavy winter gear, except very warm clothes. Microspikes or something similar might be a good idea. You do need chains for your tires at this time of year, however. Even if they aren't required at the time you drive up, bring them anyway. Conditions can change very rapidly at that altitude. Have fun! :0)"
socalhiking,2sg5dz,Rosenkavalier35,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"Do you still need info on this? I went two weekends ago and had a blast. Wouldn't mind sharing the info. Basically, there are 3 campgrounds open in winter: azalea at the top entrance, potwisha towards the bottom after the main features of the sequoias, and south fork which is in the south but it's also pretty far out of the way and inconvenient.    Azalea is my favorite in winter because it's amongst the big trees and there is usually snow (because of the higher elevation) but not enough to be a problem. There is a nice hill right by the restrooms if you want to sled. The hill is only open to campers, so it's not crowded like some of the established spots. Also, the fee is a little cheaper than potwisha ($18 vs $22).    My typical trip well be entering from the north and staying at azalea for a night or two, then head down to potwisha for the last night for a quick and easy exit out the south. This way I drive all the way through and get to enjoy a lot of it, but without having to backtrack.     Potwisha is fine, but it's more of a typical campground you'd find in socal. Azalea feels like you are in the sequoias.    As for gear: it was just under 40 degrees at night the other weekend. It's cold, but really just required warm clothes. Congress Trail and General Sherman were all ice free I the path, with very little snow."

socalhiking,2scrvh,mtnbikerdude,2,Wed Jan 14 02:15:40 2015 UTC,"I was up about 12 days ago and there was a significant ammount of snow on the Ontario Peak trail after Icehouse Saddle. A lot of this could have melted but, because of the low amount of sun this area gets, it usually holds onto snow for quite a long time. I'd plan on using your micro spikes for this section.  The trail up Icehouse was fairly snow free, although there were just enough icy sections to force me to take on and off my micro spikes a lot. This has probably melted at this point..but you can't be too prepared."

Still about 0.5-1' of snow (which is mostly hard pack). If you wander off of the trail, the snow is a bit slushier and deeper (about 2'), so you sink quite easily. Due to the Santa Anas, once on the ridge, the winds made it very difficult to walk, sustaining at 50 mph, gusting probably above 70 mph."

This was the result of about 30 minutes of photos every 10 sec. I just had to laugh at my luck.  From there, I went ahead up to Muir Peak and it was almost white out conditions (albeit just clouds, no snow). All told, about 12.5-13 miles today -- great weather!"

If you're planning on going multiple times in a year I think they offer some kind of annual pass.

It's about a 12 mile hike from the main anchorage and a shorter 4 mile hike from the other anchorage.  That being said, the campgrounds were different from those I've been to before.  We snagged one and there were no other campsites close to us.  The camping crowd was pretty small too; there were probably only 6 or 7 sites used out of the 22 available.  That being said, there's only 1 to 2 rangers on the island at a time, and there's a lot of area that doesn't have easy trails going to it, so if you want to be dispersed...but that wouldn't be in the spirit of Leave No Trace."

Scorpion Cove is like your standard campground, about 22 campsites with picnic tables and fox boxes.  There are a couple vault toilets and water spigots with fresh water.  However, there's no fire allowed on the island, and you can only cook with propane.  When we went this past weekend there were only 6 or 7 sites used at the time.  The sites are all shaded under big eucalyptus trees and nestled in the valley,  which is a super easy half mile hike from the pier.   They have carts you can borrow if you bring a lot of stuff.  Del Norte is a set of 4 primitive camping sites, so no water or toilets there.  From what I read, it's a 12-13 (depending on how you go) challenging hike from the Scorpion Cove Anchorage or a 3.5 mile hike from Prisoner's Harbor anchorage."

socalhiking,2r2kn8,scottawr,2,Fri Jan 2 05:38:02 2015 UTC,Thanks! Islip might be the winner.   What makes Icehouse canyon so popular? Do you think I'd run in to many people?  Thanks for the advice on gear!  I have neither at the moment but I think that'll change.

socalhiking,2qtl06,grammacrobat,2,Wed Dec 31 07:53:22 2014 UTC,"I have always wanted to do New Year's or the 4th of July on top of Verdugo Peak.

It's a little over 2 miles to the summit, here's a write up: http://www.modernhiker.com/2009/03/24/hiking-verdugo-mountains/  I'd suggest taking the Beaudry Motorway South up as well as down - don't do the loop as it's much longer and wont have as good a view. About 3/4 of the way up the south motorway is a stunning vantage point of downtown LA. That may be your best bet to watch the fireworks.   If you go don't forget to post some photos - I've always wanted to do this so I'm curious how it turns out.

It has a 50ft jump into water, nice hikes that go to Mt. Wilson, small waterfalls, and a campsite called Spruce Grove.

Water flow was really bad 2 months ago, but might be better now with the rain. I assure you the water will be freezing though. I was hiking through other similar elevation areas with water this past weekend (the water was barely above freezing) and will be camping the san Gabriels this weekend. Being SoCal, there aren't too many awesome spots where you won't find crowds, even though the hiking and backpacking community is pretty small compared to population. There are lots of boy and Girl Scout troops, and others who like getting away."

socalhiking,2qli6b,Charleston6309,6,Sun Dec 28 05:52:53 2014 UTC,"REI employee here.   Bigger stores generally have a bigger selection (they get more business which equates to more returns) BUT they also have larger crowds, cause you know, they're a bigger store. Tustin is the largest store in the area, so yes, it may have the largest selection. It will also have a lot of people. Definitely go early (some locations even have people camping out overnight for the sale) to get a decent place in line.   It very loosely depends on what type of gear you are specifically looking for. Some stores tend to have higher return rates of certain items over other stores. Sooo....  Definitely go to a store that carries the items you want. I say this because I work at a smaller store; we don't carry ski/snowboard hard goods and as such we very rarely have these items in our gear sales.   But, don't completely count out some of the smaller stores. As I mentioned, I work in a smaller store and we regularly get shipments from larger stores and even brand new items from the distribution center to sell at our gear sale.   My recommendation would be to do a couple of stores that are close together. The sales usually start at 8 or 10 am and go til 2 in the afternoon (approximately) which gives you a few hours to hit a couple of stores that are geographically close.   All this is very general advice. I'll attempt to answer questions it may raise, if any."
socalhiking,2qli6b,AthenaNoctua,1 point,Sun Dec 28 07:01:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I've been to the Tustin sale before and it seemed huge. Have you been to their sale before, and, if so, how does it compare to a smaller store such as huntington beach or san diego?"
socalhiking,2qli6b,AthenaNoctua,2,Sun Dec 28 07:55:34 2014 UTC,"I have not been to Tustin's sale and I haven't been to San Diego's since I started working at REI (2ish years).  I avoid bigger stores' gear sales because to me it's not worth getting to the store two or more hours early to line up (plus the drive time to the store... I enjoy my sleep), being bumped into/pushed/etc by people in line and while shopping, and waiting X minutes to an hour to check out to get used gear at approximately the same prices as I can get new gear under my employee discount.   While REI does not condone rude people's behavior at the sales, we have very little way to police it. I gravitate towards the smaller stores who generally seem to have a repeat customer base; I recognize many of the customers (and even know some by name) that appear at my store's gear sale. To me, that seems to make the whole thing run a lot smoother and thereby make the sale better even if the selections are not quite as large at smaller stores. All just my personal opinion though, obviously.   Another thing I forgot to mention in my previous comment, this gear sale is the first of the 2015 fiscal year and one of the nationally advertised sales. This generally swells the numbers at every store because the advertising has reached more people. Just another tidbit to consider."

socalhiking,2qkgqg,scottawr,2,Sun Dec 28 01:25:03 2014 UTC,Just a reminder to do research and buy items that will last. You can spend hundreds of dollars on gear that will last you a year and end up replacing the same gear because you bought the cheaper options. Just buy good gear from the start.  Example: One shitty jacket $100 Should have bought a waterproof jacket another $100 Neither jacket was good for winter another $100 on a fleece  Or just drop 250$ on one jacket that does it all and will last 5-10yrs

socalhiking,2pq6ur,grammacrobat,2,Sun Dec 21 06:41:16 2014 UTC,There wont be anything closer than the Baldy area for snow hiking unfortunately. You could drive up the angeles crest highway and hike up Waterman Mountain which is easier than most trails in the Baldy area - it's just further away.
socalhiking,2pq6ur,grammacrobat,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:56:04 2014 UTC,I think you're right. I looked at these recommendations and they're all at least another hour away from Baldy.  Any trails you recommend? Planning on driving up there with my 10 year old dog. So nothing too strenuous. Something around 3 miles would be perfect.
socalhiking,2pq6ur,cdavis7m,2,Fri Dec 19 17:42:42 2014 UTC,It may be a little too low for snow but Stoddard peak is an easy hike with great views of Baldy. Ice house canyon will definitely have snow. Its over 3 miles but you could always just turn around whenever you want.

Along with the primitive campsites, you are also allowed to camp almost anywhere in the park as long as you follow the rules:   Do not camp further than one car length from any dirt or paved road Do not camp within 100 feet of any water source There is no garbage collection outside developed campgrounds so pack-in pack-out Ground fires are not permitted, and metal containers must be used for all campfires   As for some suggestions on where to go, /u/grammacrobat hit the nail on the head.

socalhiking,2pj3d9,kbubbles88,1 point,Wed Jan 14 03:33:35 2015 UTC,"Grab yourself a San Gabriels map and then hike beyond the flats itself - it gets busy.  I can't quite remember the names of them, so bare with me.  If you go just a little beyond the campsite by following the main path to the right, you'll find some lovely backpacking sites that overlook the city and are out of the main path.  There are stove heaters/bbqs and you can ask the museum/firestation if you can have some wood for the night (they'll say yes).    If you want to be super hardcore, there is a campsite another several miles down the trail that comes highly recommended but I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, but it's on most trail maps.  Good luck!  EDIT: Remembered the name.  Idlehour.  Google idlehour campground, it comes highly recommended for scenery and seclusion, though it is a longer hike.  You could always hike to Henniger Flats and then decide there if you have the energy to keep going to Idlehour.  Have fun!"

Snow is crap quality and will provide a sliding layer if we get another storm.  Take advantage now to climb the bowl.  *edit:  I should clarify, this was the Ski Hut Trail and was an easy snow hike.

Then I moved to Colorado and got into backcountry/earn your turns Skiing and Snowboarding (WAAAAY better IMHO), and we had to dig pits, watch reports, carry beacons/shovels/probes etc.  Surfing is my first love and so I'm back here and want to do some backcountry stuff here now.  So, my question is...in Colorado it is Continental snow which is coming from both sides and is really dry which means really dangerous and high susceptibility to dry slab avalanches, whereas in CA we get wetter snow...so wet avalanches.  Do you really need to worry much about wet avalanches?  From what I understand and videos on youtube, they move like molasses and very differently compared to the violent dry slabs of the rockies.  Is it really a worry in southern CA?"

Gun sight notch is a class three scramble right in the middle of the ridge. There is no escape route if you decide to call it quits...either continue or go back and re climb either Iron or Baldy.

socalhiking,2p5juv,braindamage89,2,Sat Dec 13 15:21:10 2014 UTC,Wed 12/10
socalhiking,2p5juv,beezybreezy,2,Sat Dec 13 18:00:41 2014 UTC,yeah that probably has another 2 feet of snow at the top
socalhiking,2p5juv,braindamage89,2,Sun Dec 14 00:12:25 2014 UTC,wow this is so beautiful! I really gotta get up there before the end of the season. a few questions:  1) what kind of shoes/clothes do you use to hike in snow?  2) does the snow always melt after a storm or does it stay there all season?  3) I've heard baldy is a bit dangerous to hike during the winter. how does gorgonio compare?
socalhiking,2p5juv,beezybreezy,3,Sat Dec 13 19:08:26 2014 UTC,"since I've done it in winter and summer:  1) you will need full boots and at least micro spikes. Crampons are a good idea past January if its a wet year but you can get up in micro spikes still if you want. Gaiters too. I usually hike in a baselayer + softshell (pants and top) with a hardshell set that never really comes out of the bottom of the pack. Puffy for stops or if it gets really bad  2) Yes, no, maybe. It would melt after every storm last year. This year probably not if the weather continues. Even in wet years the freeze/thaw cycle makes it a sheet of ice past the treelines.  3) Baldy is dangerous? If you have warm clothes, enough water and spikes, Baldy in winter is pretty easy. The trail is pretty self-explanatory so you can see where you are going the whole way up and the whole way down. And there's usually a dozen or so people around the trail even on cold days. There's a ski lodge halfway up that usually is open on weekends too. Gorgonio is much tougher because a) its an extra 10 miles b) you can even on weekends be the only people on the mountain and c) the path winds through some areas that if the trail isn't packed into the snow yet, you're going to need to know where you're going. In addition, the switchbacks on Gorgonio become covered usually so you just have to trek straight up the hill sometimes.   All of them can get frightening windy. Just because its 65 with 5mph of wind at the bottom, it can be 60 mph gusts at the top around 20-30 degrees.   I did Gorgonio last Jan in a whiteout. But, I had both done it before and had a GPS."
socalhiking,2p5juv,braindamage89,2,Sun Dec 14 00:26:23 2014 UTC,Thanks! I'll try the Ice House as the commenter below suggested. I'm guessing I should aim to hike it the weekend after a storm if I want to get snow?
socalhiking,2p5juv,braindamage89,2,Sun Dec 14 06:05:22 2014 UTC,Oh there will be snow lol. Mt San Jacinto was already covered in 1-2ft when I did it two weeks ago. I think SoCal has scattered precipitation all week.   Check the weather before you go. Winds will be whipping up periodically this week.
socalhiking,2p5juv,beezybreezy,2,Sun Dec 14 08:58:22 2014 UTC,"For this hike we used microspikes as foot traction, but the big icy mountains may require crampons. I had a soft shell jacket and a fleece most of the day. The freeze-thaw cycle can make any mountain dangerous if it is steep. The snow will melt a little during the day and freeze at night leaving super slick ice that boots won't have any traction. Gorgonio, baldy, and jacinto all have steep slopes that will be icy at times.   If you are looking to get started winter hiking check out icehouse it has easy snow hiking up to he saddle where you can gain experience with snow and ice."
socalhiking,2p5juv,beezybreezy,4,Sun Dec 14 00:08:33 2014 UTC,"I'll second icehouse. If you go up to Cucamonga, it has probably the best view of Inland Empire/LA. Clouds usually form up in winter and roll up the side of the mountain looking very cool: http://imgur.com/Igx0Wac"
socalhiking,2p5juv,braindamage89,2,Sun Dec 14 00:35:20 2014 UTC,thanks. I definitely want to try winter hiking but I'm guessing I shouldn't rush on to one of the major peaks if I've never traveled long distances in snow before. I'll definitely try the ice house when I get some gear after Christmas.
socalhiking,2p5juv,beestakingthe405,1 point,Sun Dec 14 06:04:37 2014 UTC,Grab a pair of microspikes  and enjoy the season.  Mt waterman is a good starter because you can hike up the fire road it's nice and wide .   Mt islip and the pct in that area are good too.

They are working on the SoCal map and have not posted it at this link yet. Technically a National Monument can be managed by the Forest Service, though sometimes it is managed by the BLM. I would guess in this instance that it will still be managed by the Forest Service so it's possible that you may still need an adventure pass for the new San Bernardino National Monument. It's also quite possible that they may not be enforcing it yet though, since they haven't posted the info yet online, so it's up to you whether you want to risk it."

socalhiking,2om7sn,thatguyron,2,Mon Dec 8 04:49:14 2014 UTC,Just did a short hike up to the start of the Backbone trail today and the conditions were pretty moderate along there with minimal wind. Felt like temps in the low 40s around there (8500ft or so). No snow anywhere near that elevation - not sure if there is any up around the summit. Talked briefly to a guy who mentioned it was quite windy at the summit.  For clothing a light wool underlayer and long sleeve shirt was enough for going uphill. Threw on a shell and light gloves for descending but would have been ok without those too. Quite pleasant all in all.
socalhiking,2om7sn,thatguyron,2,Mon Dec 8 04:55:23 2014 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the info.  It's good to know that it might be moderate for at least part of the way up, although I'll of course be prepared for much more severe conditions at the summit."

socalhiking,2o8k4q,tpm319,2,Sat Dec 6 04:39:16 2014 UTC,"I hiked Wildrose in March a couple of years ago when there was a decent amount of snow on the ground. As I recall the snow didn't begin for us until the final 1/2-1 mile push to the peak. It was about 1 to 2 feet deep  and didn't offer too much resistance on the climb. The trail was completely obscured of course but we never felt like we were in any danger. The last climb to the peak is pretty steep but it isn't really exposed too cliffs or anything so just start switch backing your way up and you should be fine. The summit ridge and the summit itself were similarly straight forward. The peak I think is barren, and all that was left was a few inches thick crust of wind blow snow. The ridge itself is wide enough and the peak smooth enough that there isn't much danger of falling off the side somehow.   Anyway we didn't carry any snow gear, just jackets and hiking poles. Keep an eye out on the weather, your snow conditions may not be the same."

socalhiking,2nwpu1,Gabrcruz,4,Mon Dec 1 04:06:18 2014 UTC,Had some fun today hiking Mount Baldy. I ran into a few people and I recall reading that some of the users here were going up today. Wish I knew who you were so we could have talked a bit. This was my first time ascending Baldy in these conditions. I've been before with fresh snow/ice but this was a first actually experiencing some snowfall. Definitely too cold on top to eat my lunch and the day didn't make for nice pictures but I still took a few!

I am already planning a backpacking trip to idlehour in a few weeks."

Hopefully it can heal soon and allow you to enjoy the mountains some more.   If you're okay with company and I'm free -- I would enjoy a backpacking trip in that area. Since the water source is confirmed some nice freeze fried meals and coffee in the evening sounds like fun.

Check the predicted snow altitude.  This storm that's going right now probably isn't going to make it snow up there; it's too warm."

socalhiking,2nx3e4,HikingFool,5,Mon Dec 1 07:24:32 2014 UTC,Unfortunately he is mistaken. Little jimmy is not in chantry. It is 2.5 miles up the pct from islip saddle off angeles crest highway. You aren't going to be able to just drive in to much snow camping if any close to la. The sierras would be a better bet. Though I haven't been in winter Id think humber park in idylwyld would be a possibility at its at 6k+ feet already. Possibly vivian creek in the san bernardinos at around 5500 feet. All the camps in chantry around around 2-3k feet and I haven't come across snow any lower than around 4k on the backside (cooler side) of chantry. The chantry camps are hike in as well. Not drive in. Manker flats on baldy might get some snow.
socalhiking,2nx3e4,NealShire,2,Mon Dec 1 09:52:01 2014 UTC,"Bah, I meant Hoagie's. It's been too long since I've been up there.  I'm not sure if Hoagie's is even the official name, I never saw it on any maps."

socalhiking,2nn1fd,laydownlarry,6,Fri Nov 28 04:38:26 2014 UTC,"I've never done it, but I believe the trail you're looking for starts at The Big Horn Mine trailhead (Vincent Gap area).  You take the fork to the left after you head out of the parking (will head down to the floor of the gultch). I've packed the opposite direction and camped at Iron Fork which is a great trip.  The whole trail from the 2 to the 39 is only 11 miles, so 3 days seems like overkill.  A lot of the upper trail in the canyon (near Iron Fork) requires walking in the river or scaling the walls, so absolutely do not do this hike if there is rain predicted! Always wanted to do that hike.  Curious to hear how it goes, definitely report back if you do it."

socalhiking,2nn1fd,NealShire,2,Fri Dec 5 15:51:29 2014 UTC,"A lot of the trail north of the bridge itself is very precarious, right on the edge of a cliff. You must only do this in dry weather."

It was super windy and cold...probably the coldest cold I've, personally, ever experienced.  I did the hike from Aspen Grove and we summited in a day which was probably not the best idea since we ended up descending at night.

One of those times I was trapped there overnight.   I've determined that the San Gorgonio gods have a vengeance and will do whatever they can to not let you leave.
socalhiking,2nhuk1,tylorjams,2,Wed Nov 26 19:27:45 2014 UTC,"My understanding is this system will not come through until Monday night. Temperatures are supposed to be warm but drop on Sunday, conditions should still be favorable. I'll be going up Baldy on Sunday and I'm feeling pretty confident that it will be fine. That being said over night temps will be below freezing, I don't think you will be getting any precipitation, but if you see anything moving in you should get off the mountain. Also call the ranger and get an up to date report the night before or even the day of depending on how early you hit the trail. Monday night is a fairly long term prediction for this storm and it could end up coming earlier."

socalhiking,2neoi0,skrenename4147,2,Tue Nov 25 20:37:27 2014 UTC,"The Sierra Club Desert Peaks Section has a nice list (PDF) of desert  peaks and what class they are. (The Sierra Peaks Section has a similar list covering Sierra peaks) There are also trip reports that give you an idea of the hike.  The Sierra Club Hundred Peaks Section (which covers peaks over 5000 feet in Southern California) doesn't list them out like that but does have route guides to all their peaks. So search for scramble site:hundredpeaks.org or ""class 2"" site:hundredpeaks.org and you'll find some places to go scrambling."
socalhiking,2neoi0,Pallmaster,1 point,Tue Nov 25 21:46:05 2014 UTC,"a nice list (PDF)   Wow, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for, thank you!  On a relatively unrelated note, are you a member of the Sierra club?  The HQ of the Angeles chapter is a 2 minute walk from my apartment but I'm not really sure what it's all about.  Looking at the schedule of events, it's a lot of trail conditioning hikes through easy terrain, which I'd do but am more interested in more difficult (multiday?) hikes with people I can learn things from.  Thanks again!"
socalhiking,2neoi0,Pallmaster,1 point,Tue Nov 25 22:27:15 2014 UTC,"I am, yes. The Sierra Club has kind of a dual identity being both a conservation advocacy organization and outdoor recreation club, with the outings side of things being particularly strong in the Angeles Chapter. There's a pretty wide range of outings from the basic conditioning hikes to cross-country skiing to 4th class climbing (5th class climbing used to be part of the mix but after a big kerfuffle about mountaineering insurance in the 80s what was the Rock Climbing Section evolved into the SCMA).  For harder off-trail hiking I'd look into the ""Peaks"" sections (Sierra, Desert, Hundred, and maybe Lower) and look for anything ""I"" rated (that means cross-country and maybe 2nd class scrambling; ""O"" is on-trail"", ""M"" is 3rd class, ""E"" is 4th class).  But the best place to start if overnight backpacking trips and class 2 climbing sounds like fun is the Wilderness Travel Course, which starts in January. More than one person has told me it's changed their life. :)"

If you can, I would try pushing the trip back a week so it's not on a holiday weekend.  To give you an idea of how crowded it is right now, the reservation only sites were booked over 2 months ago when I first started looking at JTree for a possible trip. When we left today there were cars driving by our campsite telling me they had been looking since yesterday for a site.  We left for our trip on Friday at 5:30am and got there before 8am but no one really left there sites until around 9am.  We were lucky enough to get a spot at Ryan campground after looking at Jumbo Rocks, and Hidden Valley with no luck.  I would recommend calling the ranger station the day before you plan on going to see if they can provide you with an estimate on how many spots will be available on the day you are going.  That will probably be your best bet on determining if it will be worth the trip out there.  It's a great place to camp and explore so I hope you are able to find a place to camp."

If you get there and find the key spots like Big Rocks packed full go get a spot at the spot across the street, then get up super early and wait for a spot to open where you want.

I once hiked the Burkhart trail, and cut through Buckhorn Campground. This was in February, when the campground was closed. I saw a tent set up in one of the campsites way in back. I later mentioned it to a friend who works for the Forest Service and his response was that it's not illegal and that they wouldn't do anything to remove the camper if he was caught."
socalhiking,2n6omb,robbbbb,3,Sun Nov 23 19:12:58 2014 UTC,"Alrigh so a here's a quick update.  We went to Fishermans campground in San Bernardino. After the seemingly unanimous opinion that there should be no problem camping after the grounds are closed. It was a nice, but short, trip. We met a fellow camper named David who said he used the campgrounds all the time and had never had a problem with using it after closing. As far as the actual trip details, well the road that led to the trailhead has a stream running through it that our car would not have been able to cross with taking on a bit of water. This added about a mile to our hike which totaled +- 4 mile each way. The night was chilly so as most should already know bring layers to camp this time of year. The water was flowing quite strongly and after some hiking and rock scrambling we were able to find a grand total of 2 fish. Defenetly not a fishermans paradise but if you go only for the hike and camp then this is a fairly nice place."

socalhiking,2mya88,grammacrobat,6,Fri Nov 21 04:09:50 2014 UTC,"Earlier this week I accidentally ran into an abandoned mine in Rubio Canyon. That made me realize that I've never been to the biggest mine in the San Gabriels - Big Horn.   It has some amazing views of some seriously inaccessible areas. The San Antonio Ridge, the north face of Big Iron, and many rugged canyons and narrows below.    For such a short hike it sure has a lot to offer."
socalhiking,2mya88,HikingFool,3,Fri Nov 21 04:13:04 2014 UTC,Epic! I love the history of the San Gabriels. We are so lucky to have them in our backyard. What's the story of the one in Rubio canyon? Is it hard to get to?
socalhiking,2mya88,JackTR314,2,Fri Nov 21 05:29:22 2014 UTC,You know I wasn't able to dig up much info on it. I read some speculation that I could be a gold mine dating from the 1860s or it could just be a water tunnel. Was cool either way. Its on the west wall of rubio canyon if you hike it down towards altadena on the canyon floor.
socalhiking,2mya88,JackTR314,2,Fri Nov 21 07:03:14 2014 UTC,Where is the trailhead? do you have a link or anything to more info?
socalhiking,2mya88,THCarlisle,4,Fri Nov 21 04:23:30 2014 UTC,Here's a good write up of the hike: http://www.localhikes.com/Hikes/BigHornMine_4472.asp  It's a bit of a drive if you're coming from LA but it's worth it.
socalhiking,2mya88,scottawr,1 point,Fri Nov 21 04:29:06 2014 UTC,"Oh cool, thanks. I'm around the Pomona area, so not quite as far, seems like a cool hike!"
socalhiking,2mya88,THCarlisle,5,Fri Nov 21 05:34:57 2014 UTC,"Awesome! Just googled it and found this guy with a picture and some descriptions of the inside of the mines   17,000 feet or just under 2 miles of tunnel can be explored. Evidence of raves can be found. Watch out for 2 pits dropping 60 feet to the mid level. They'll appear unexpectedly. Stairwells once filled them but have long since collapsed. 6-8 hrs. to fully explore."
socalhiking,2mya88,scottawr,3,Fri Nov 21 09:28:34 2014 UTC,Watch out for 2 pits dropping 60 feet to the mid level. They'll appear unexpectedly.   Wow...don't forget your headlamp.

socalhiking,2mya88,scottawr,1 point,Sat Nov 22 05:00:14 2014 UTC,Thank you kind sir!I'mGonnaStrikeItRich
socalhiking,2mya88,millenniummark,2,Sat Nov 22 12:01:45 2014 UTC,I've been itching to check out a few of the mines on iron. It's amazing how the dudes carried all that heavy stuff so far up in such inaccessible places. Even before the ACH or other roads into the mountains.
socalhiking,2mya88,scottawr,3,Fri Nov 21 06:07:41 2014 UTC,"Allison, Stanley miller,  Widco/Baldora, Gold Dollar,  and Eagle Mine right?  I've tried to make it to Allison Mine but the way my friends and I went was a little to sketchy for our liking."
socalhiking,2mya88,millenniummark,2,Fri Nov 21 12:32:33 2014 UTC,Did you try for the Allison mine from below? Or from the iron mountain trail cutoff?
socalhiking,2mxk94,SelwayScreamer,2,Fri Nov 21 00:20:16 2014 UTC,"You don't necessarily need crampons/ice axe. Trekking poles and micro spikes work just as well for almost everything you'd encounter on a winter hike. They're also much cheaper.   The most important thing about hiking in cold weather is your clothing. You need to wear synthetics (cotton gets wet, wont dry, and could kill you) and you should wear them in layers. You may be shivering at the trail head but a mile in and you could be sweating. You want to be able to regulate temperature by adding and removing layers.  Also, I find that gaiters make hiking in deep snow WAY better. They keep snow and water out of your boots and you'r socks and pants dry.   As for a trip suggestion, any of the three ""Saints"" San G, San J, and Baldy are tons of fun in the snow. You may want to wait a week or so after a big storm for the snow to consolidate though. Post-holing in deep/fresh snow can be miserable.   Have fun!"
socalhiking,2mxk94,grammacrobat,2,Fri Nov 21 04:04:04 2014 UTC,Baldy covers everything.  Ski hut trailbfor deep snow and ice.  Backbone for exposed ice and wind.  And the face for real mountaineering practice (warning: severe risk of avalanche)
socalhiking,2mxk94,summiter,2,Fri Nov 21 05:13:18 2014 UTC,San Jacinto is great for getting your feet wet (so to speak) with winter hiking because you don't need to drive in the snow. Let the tram take you up. I did San Jac in winter once and saw a guy hiking with a sword as a pole.
socalhiking,2mxk94,unknownkoger,3,Sat Nov 22 01:31:40 2014 UTC,Gotta love southern California
socalhiking,2mxk94,ccrobinsusc,1 point,Sun Nov 23 18:44:34 2014 UTC,I have done San Jac and San G in Jan/Febuary and think they are a great into to winter hiking/snow travel.
socalhiking,2mx0hn,The_Xozz,1 point,Thu Nov 20 21:42:37 2014 UTC,"There's some snow on the ground, but it's very little, and you don't need to walk on it. It's all on the north-facing slopes, so none on the main trails. If you're doing the north backbone, you'll be walking on it, but it's still not a lot."
socalhiking,2mvvof,dekkerbasser,4,Thu Nov 20 16:05:08 2014 UTC,"I think you might be confusing car camping spots with fire pits. As far as I know and I've backpacked all across Joshua tree, there are no fires in the backcountry unless it's in a self contained stove with fuel. Plus you aren't allowed to burn Joshua trees or local vegetation so carrying even one bundle of firewood into the back country wouldn't make any sense. Try trail camps in the San Gabriels, like little jimmy, valley forge, west fork, or devore. You can gather wood/pine cones at all these spots."
socalhiking,2mvvof,HikingFool,1 point,Thu Nov 20 18:22:42 2014 UTC,Right on. I appreciate the response. I'll look into those.
socalhiking,2mvvof,unconfirmed_bot,2,Thu Nov 20 18:30:04 2014 UTC,Anza Borrego- but you can't have the fire directly on the ground as it needs to be a container of sorts. I use a mini weber grill.
socalhiking,2mvvof,dryless,1 point,Thu Nov 20 16:41:42 2014 UTC,I use a $10 charcoal grill from the supermarket as my fire container in Anza Borrego - works like a charm
socalhiking,2mvvof,dryless,1 point,Thu Nov 20 21:00:15 2014 UTC,fires in backcountry campgrounds in Angeles national Foresst are OK still. Los Padres has no fires al all ( stoves OK)

socalhiking,2mobdo,grammacrobat,3,Tue Nov 18 16:20:20 2014 UTC,I don't see anything in John Robinson's book or Hugh Blanchards website.  I suspect it's not a mine but rather a water tunnel.
socalhiking,2mobdo,ScrewDislocations,2,Tue Nov 18 17:50:12 2014 UTC,I found a few hiking near Millard above the waterfall years ago. Too bad the areas closed at the moment.
socalhiking,2mobdo,HikingFool,2,Tue Nov 18 17:51:43 2014 UTC,"Are you talking about the dawn mine?    Also, the Millard water fall trail remains closed, but I'm pretty sure the area above the falls where the dawn mine is is open and accessible if you drop in from the fire road."
socalhiking,2mobdo,ScrewDislocations,2,Tue Nov 18 18:05:19 2014 UTC,Couldn't find much info about it online. Has anyone here come across is before or know some of its history?
socalhiking,2mobdo,dima55,4,Tue Nov 18 16:21:31 2014 UTC,"Here's some speculation for you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1SWg0dxOJg   Fast forward to the 5-minute mark or so. Where was this mine, by the way?"
socalhiking,2mobdo,dima55,3,Tue Nov 18 23:13:48 2014 UTC,That's it! The last mine in that video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1SWg0dxOJg&feature=player_detailpage#t=301  Thanks!  To get to the mine hike into Rubio Canyon until you get to the ruins of Rubio Pavillion. Follow the trail until it meets up with the bottom of the canyon (the now dry creek bed). Instead of continuing upwards into the canyon follow the creek bed downwards towards the entrance. The mine is fairly obvious and on the west facing canyon wall. It's locked really well - no getting in! Either hike back the way you came or follow the creek bed out to the road and walk back to your car.
socalhiking,2mobdo,robbbbb,3,Tue Nov 18 23:21:38 2014 UTC,"Oh, that's interesting. There's another mine in the same area, but on the east side of the canyon. That one isn't locked, but the opening isn't huge and you have to crawl in, so I never bothered to enter."
socalhiking,2mobdo,sobieski84,1 point,Tue Nov 18 23:30:29 2014 UTC,"Hmm, he described the location as ""west-facing"" and you're describing yours as the ""east side""... couldn't they be the same thing?"
socalhiking,2mobdo,scottawr,1 point,Wed Nov 19 05:06:27 2014 UTC,I misspoke. Its on the west canyon wall.
socalhiking,2mobdo,scottawr,1 point,Wed Nov 19 05:09:01 2014 UTC,How do we open it???? I want Platinum. TNT?
socalhiking,2mobdo,boblafollette,1 point,Wed Nov 19 01:25:25 2014 UTC,What were you doing in Rubio canyon? Can't imagine there is much water flowing at the few waterfalls you can get to without ropes.
socalhiking,2mobdo,mrshatnertoyou,2,Wed Nov 19 01:29:26 2014 UTC,It was entirely dry. I was poking around trying to find a clear route up the old inclined railway to the summit of echo. Pretty sure I found an interesting scramble.

socalhiking,2mj2k3,jasnooo,2,Mon Nov 17 04:14:47 2014 UTC,"She got spooked by a group of cyclists and ran down the hill. I guess it happens somewhat often with dogs like Kiwi who are city dogs,  not used to nature :/"
socalhiking,2mj2k3,Lostcreek3,11,Mon Nov 17 05:38:22 2014 UTC,"There's a leash in the picture... was she on leash?  I know this doesn't help - but as a SoCal hiker and dog lover let me take a moment to remind everyone that rattlesnakes range extends to 11,000' and you should never hike with your dog off-leash.  It's rude to other hikers and it isn't safe for your dog(or wildlife).  I hope that isn't the case here, and I really hope you find that dog."
socalhiking,2mj2k3,millenniummark,4,Mon Nov 17 07:08:35 2014 UTC,"She was on a leash half the time and my friend let her off the leash just for a bit because she's a super shy dog who normally wouldn't leave her side. I totally agree with keeping your dog on a leash. As mentioned, this is my non-redditor friend's dog. I'm just helping out. Good reminder for all though!"
socalhiking,2mj2k3,jjmcquade,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:15:42 2014 UTC,I hear that rattlesnakes go into hibernation once the daily average temperature is below 60. And on the dog post pictures around the town and ask alot of people

socalhiking,2mj2k3,SoCal_Sapper,4,Fri Nov 21 20:26:08 2014 UTC,"It's a very poplar trail and area.  I'm sure he'll find his way down to the town.  But baldy is home to bear, bobcat, and cougar...  So be sure to call/check at least twice a day and contact the locals who can look more frequently."
socalhiking,2mj2k3,totes_meta_bot,4,Mon Nov 17 04:30:56 2014 UTC,Anyone happen to know when Baldy starts getting snow?
socalhiking,2mj2k3,Coldhandles,4,Mon Nov 17 07:07:14 2014 UTC,Now -> feb  It already snowed a little once but it was hot enough in the week after to melt it. Soon the temps will drop and the snow will stay around long enough to accumulate.
socalhiking,2mj2k3,Kirbacho,3,Mon Nov 17 05:05:28 2014 UTC,"A week ago, San Jacinto had 'sierra cement'(refrozen snow patches) in the shade starting at... 8k' or so?"
socalhiking,2mj2k3,scottawr,2,Mon Nov 17 15:08:58 2014 UTC,"The freeze thaw cycle is what people need to look out for. Soft easy snow that you boots sink into a little can be easy to walk in on the way up, but if the temp drops the same snow can turn hard and slick the morning/night and could require crampons."

I'm a 27 year old guy and have been backpacking for years. Last year or two have been mostly day hikes and car camping, but I miss backpacking a lot. I used to do a lot of solo trips because my friends just wanted to car camp. Anyway, lemme know if you're interested.

I work freelance so my schedule is either slammed or totally open, and if we find a time that works I'd love to go out for a night."
socalhiking,2mjrgb,HikingFool,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:15:55 2014 UTC,"I like that the comments got a pretty good turnout. I'll be doing two day hikes this weekend. Friday is spoken for but I'm open to suggestions for Sunday. Otherwise I'm definitely down to plan things in the future. In terms of chantry, it's a few miles further but I really like camping at west fork and devore campgrounds. Usually very few people on the backside. Plus there's still water running. You can approach from mount Wilson or red box. Red box being easiest. And not have to go over Newcombe pass. Also definitely smaller campgrounds than the ones on the front side. This Sunday I'm looking for a 15-18 miler but can be conviced to go higher or lower. If the weather holds Id be down for any combo of ecbo or the whole thing. Btw all y'all with no hiking or backpacking friends need www.meetup.com I've made lots of camping buddies through there. I'll do my best to post my future hikes. I lead with a few meetup groups and occasionally cross post them here, but I've been trying to get back into that more often. I'll be doing a lot of san Gabriel camping this winter as I love the cold. Little jimmy, idle hour, lowe, and all chantry I'm down for, and more."

socalhiking,2miis9,abedwithwheels,1 point,Mon Nov 17 01:58:21 2014 UTC,Deer and I believe there are like 2 permits for bighorn in the sbnf.   I'm not sure if anyone had ever been shot accidentally in the san hands but hunting accidents do happen and taking a few precautions is probably a good idea.
socalhiking,2miis9,scottawr,3,Mon Nov 17 02:29:25 2014 UTC,I think the San Gabriel region finished their hunting season last week and it lasted about a month. I was out and saw tons of hunters near the East Fork last Sunday which was the last day of the season. The hunting  is almost all for deer. I had on a bright yellow shirt and made sure to make lots of noise.

socalhiking,2mb7ar,scottawr,1 point,Sat Nov 15 20:31:49 2014 UTC,Sometimes yes sometimes no.  Kathoola microspikes work great for light snow but eventually crampons become nessecary.
socalhiking,2mb7ar,Skix,-1,Sat Nov 15 03:38:56 2014 UTC,"You don't need crampons, I hiked it in running shorts and trail runners. I kept my feet dry, and I used a moisture wicking layer, once you stop hiking, put on a puffy jacket to stay warm. I would recommend starting early (5:30-6:00am)"
socalhiking,2mb7ar,Webbtastic,3,Sat Nov 15 01:33:49 2014 UTC,The question wasnt specific to one hike. It was specific to a season. I stand by my recommendation to have crampons. Better to have and not need than to need and not have. Plus you can find cheapos for $20
socalhiking,2mb7ar,scottawr,1 point,Sat Nov 15 01:40:09 2014 UTC,Crampons with training if you don't know what you are doin with crampons/axe you shouldn't use them.

socalhiking,2mb7ar,mrshatnertoyou,6,Mon Nov 17 19:27:41 2014 UTC,"This time of year things change day to day but typically there isn't that much snow on the main routes which are almost all south facing. The Devil's Backbone has the least elevation gain of about 2,400 in about 3.5 miles. If there is snow then this route can be unforgiving in places for a slip up.   The more enjoyable route but more significant elevation gain of 3,800 is to take the Ski Hut Trail from Manker Flats. This route though steep is much more negotiable if there are snow or ice patches on the trail."

socalhiking,2maa45,kbtube,2,Fri Nov 14 14:17:18 2014 UTC,"Ha, I feel like I make this recommendation a lot, but check out the Sespe Wilderness.  Sespe Creek itself is usually pretty reliable as a water source in my experience (although who knows about right now with the drought)."
socalhiking,2maa45,thatguyron,1 point,Fri Nov 14 16:02:14 2014 UTC,I agree. This area is great for a couple days of backpacking but definitely check the water level. You should call the ranger station to find out if any of the creeks are still running.   I did find one blogger who reported water levels for this area. This was from 2013 but I dont think it has changed too much since 2014 was a really dry year.
socalhiking,2maa45,mtnbikerdude,1 point,Sat Nov 15 05:34:38 2014 UTC,"The Sespe is always a good idea. I've been there regularly over the past 6 months and there is water there but it's infrequent. There is a reliable spring at Willet Hot Springs, about 11 miles in along the Sespe River Trail if you leave from the Piedra Blanca TH. Prior to that there are a few scattered pools along the river. Can't speak for the other trails though. Just make sure you have your filter. Observed lots of bear sign there in mid-October, FYI. Good packing, might even see you out there."

If you are in Los Angeles it will take you about an hour to get there. It is right on a cliff, the sunsets are perfect. Make sure you get a spot on the cliff side, so you don't have to stare across the road in envy.   If you're looking to stay in the Los Angeles area there is always Point Mugu and Camarillo State Beach, but you won't be right on a cliff with these… you walk a few minutes to be on the beach."

socalhiking,2m47jz,matt4500,2,Thu Nov 13 15:37:23 2014 UTC,Don't carry 4 days of water. The whole california riding and hiking trail is 38 miles long and when I did it last year I cached water around juniper flats board (halfway about 19 miles) and at twin tanks board around 30 miles in. I'm was cold when I did it thanksgiving weekend and I used a lot less water than I cached for myself. You could also probably cache once at juniper flat or geology tour road. If you start at black rock you can do mostly downhill or from the north entrance mostly uphill. You need to call a cab though to get back if no car shuttle.

We decided to chance it anyway and rode to the campground at the other side near the 10 freeway in the dead of night (Cottonwood I think it was called) hoping that would be the most likely to have a free spot. There were a bunch of open spots and the sites are big so you could probably hand somebody a twenty and set up on the edge provided you don't have much stuff.   Alternatively, there are a bunch of primitive campsites on Box Canyon Road south of the 10.  Your mileage may vary."

There are some really good views from Garnet Peak in the Laguna Mountains which you can link with Noble Canyon trail of Cleveland National Forest and/or the PCT. You need to attain a permit with the ranger station, they like you to call them for it- it's really quick.   Personally I really like North of Warner Springs on the PCT.

I'm planning a Death Valley backpacking trip this winter as well as multiple car camping trips to Joshua tree and red rock state park.

I love that the trail follows the water, and I've got a few spots a few miles in if I'm just looking to get out for a few miles before spending the night. Now that it is cooling it won't be as important to stick to the water, so your spots would be fine.

I think 8000 is a reasonable budget. On the question whether I want to go to national parks or cities. I want a mix of both, I guess I would say I would take National parks over cities. I also want to visit some small towns. Coming to the US I definitely want to visit the big cities like New York and LA too. I have memories of me playing midtown madness (A video game) and driving around San Francisco so I can not, not visit San Francisco while I am there. Some my favorite companies are based in San Fransisco and I always wanted to live there. I want to visit as many national parks as possible, the main ones being the Grand canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, the rocky mountains and the smoky mountains. Other things on my radar are the national mall, the smithsonian and  Mount rushmore. I also want to visit Connecticut and boulder to meet friends. Yeah and I also want to hit the beaches of florida.

My first time was in 2011, with a friend who had never done it either, and we had to backtrack a few times at the beginning but eventually found the way.  Once you reach the first saddle on the ridge above the golf course, keep heading west through the cluster of junctions, and once you are past that the trail is pretty well defined for the rest of the way. If there is snow by that time, there will most likely be a carved path but you still might need micro or full on crampons depending on conditions. There are a lot of detailed maps and even google earth files that you can study a bit beforehand to make sure you have a good feel of where the trail goes.    Also, when you reach the last slopes to the tram area you will see a huge prominent rock dome/spire that is called Coffman's Crag.  The trail zig zags up the slope and you should never have to go North of that formation.  I recommend getting familiar with the trail system in Round Valley if you are not already.  It's a beautiful trail and one of the best hikes in Socal in my opinion.  Have a blast!"

It was nice to get a lay of the land, but not quite as challenging as I'd normally want. It seemed like a great place for kids.  Not sure what temps are like in April, but last night the low was in the mid-40's, which is just about perfect for tent camping for me."

You could also start from Ojai, trek up to Nordhoff peak and hike into Sespe and make a two day trip out of that.  Fill us in whatever you decide, it sounds fun. There are definitely bears. My friends encountered some (cubs!) So take precautions."

socalhiking,2iix4q,thatguyron,2,Thu Oct 9 03:50:07 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen any mountain lions or bears, but I have seen the herd of bighorn sheep that is there.    The last time I was there I did a 2 nighter that I can recommend.  We parked at Piedra Blanca, hiked over to Middle Lion (you can probably just park at Middle Lion too) and then headed up the Lion Canyon Trail.  We camped somewhere at the top of the ridge there.  I guess it's not the most isolated spot because you can see the Ojai city lights in the distance, but it's still a beautiful hike to get there.  The next day we hiked across the ridge and down past Ladybug to Sespe Creek itself, and then went upstream to Sespe Hot Springs, where we camped for our second night.  The last day we hiked out from Sespe Hot Springs back to Piedra Blanca.    Our second day was pretty grueling, and I recommend making it down to Ladybug to camp the first night if you can.  We basically got off work early on Friday and didn't get to the parking lot until about 3:00 PM, which limited things."
socalhiking,2iix4q,McPolypusher,2,Tue Oct 7 06:31:14 2014 UTC,"That does sound like a good loop. You took the Sespe River trail out? Yea, a brutal 15+ miles in a day is no cake walk. When was this?"
socalhiking,2iix4q,McPolypusher,2,Thu Oct 9 03:48:38 2014 UTC,"This was last April, and yes we took the Sespe River trail out.  The trail gets a bit faint between Willett Hot Springs and Sespe Hot springs and so you might have to hunt for it (we completely lost the trail a couple times).   The bighorn sheep we saw basically right at the source of Sespe hotsprings where the water comes out of the side of the hill.  We camped a few hundred feet from the spring source that night, and in the morning we were awoken by the clopping sound of their hooves as they came down into the valley."

I'm fine with keeping it in NFS hands."

The East Fork of the San Gabriel is a perfect example of the Forest Service having lost control of the situation. You have dirty diapers, aggressive miners, and homeless sleeping out there. You get spray painting on the rocks, the rangers admit they are outgunned. More restrictions and more money is desperately needed to keep LAs backyard playground protected.   I have no pity for a self interested body such as the ski operators and their desire to make money. I am more interested in the overall health of the mountains and they need major protection."
socalhiking,2i1x5b,mrshatnertoyou,3,Thu Oct 2 21:04:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this seems pretty manipulative to say national monument or national park status isn't an improvement over standard BLM/NFS oversight. There are expanded recreational opportunities. I don't know what it would do to skiing, but I doubt it would do anything more than prevent the expansion of slopes."
socalhiking,2i1x5b,WackyXaky,2,Thu Oct 2 15:33:34 2014 UTC,"What would the expanded recreational activities be? As a camper, I thought BLM and forest areas always had more uses and options than federally managed land.   I'm just trying to understand the issues here.  The only thing i see that makes this move make sense  is the state's recent attempts in the area to expand their future water rights."
socalhiking,2i1x5b,dubflip,3,Thu Oct 2 15:57:06 2014 UTC,"My understanding (and I'm no expert), but National Parks and Monuments are solely for recreational and wildlife preservation. National Forests must also allow resource extraction (such as mining or logging). The land is required to be ""worked"" in a sense, and the resources available must be split between preservation/recreation and this resource extraction. A National Park would be spending all the allocated money towards recreation and preservation. This could include more money to trail maintenance, better camping facilities, more ranger resources for backpackers, etc."

socalhiking,2i1x5b,dubflip,4,Thu Oct 2 18:28:07 2014 UTC,"I do not understand why this area should ever be National Park or monument status. There should be different levels of status. What I mean is that not every national forest that someone feels some semblance of emotional attachment to should be a national monument.  It is okay to keep this a national forest area.  I enjoy the San Gabriels but it is not Yosemite, Yellowstone, Redwoods, Mojave or even the most scenic mountain area in Southern California."
socalhiking,2i1x5b,VivaLaFIJI,5,Thu Oct 2 10:41:38 2014 UTC,"What people want is a National Recreation Area, similar to Santa Monica Mountains.  That would open some areas up for protection, while allowing recreation to continue, the best of both worlds.  That takes an act of Congress, though, so not happening.  A monument would offer the protections people want, but take away some recreational use.  The monument designation is on the table right now because it can be declared unilaterally by the President.  Mt. Baldy doesn't want either because both would impact expansion of a ski area that is mediocre to begin with, and only opens infrequently.  Personally, I think Mt. Baldy is full of shit here.  Their operation is a dying one.  Any federal designation to the land eventually increases the amount of money spent in upkeep, and the San Gabriels could really use it."
socalhiking,2i1x5b,gcwyodave,1 point,Thu Oct 2 15:35:09 2014 UTC,"Seems like the backside of Baldy has been an option for expansion for years now. If they are worried about losing it, why don't they just take the option and finally build a lift there?"

socalhiking,2hv6lc,avocadoss,5,Tue Sep 30 05:50:39 2014 UTC,"Larry Conn went backpacking in October 2012 in the sierra (Taboose pass area).  There was a storm that came in a day earlier than predicted.  His remains were found in June 2013.  Be very careful with the weather.  Respect it's power.  Most importantly:  Make an itinerary and give it to someone you trust.  Make sure that if there is an unexpected storm storm, or someone hurts their ankle and can't hike out, that SAR will know where to look for you.    Tell your home contact when to call the authorities if they haven't heard from you, and make sure they can tell SAR where to find you.  Give them a description of your tent, and clothes (especially your footwear, most SAR teams are trained in man tracking), so SAR will know what they are looking for.  It could save your life.  Larry was notoriously lax about this.  The only clue searchers had for where to look for him was where his car was found.  They knew he had 4 days of supplies, when he left, and which trailhead he used.  They had to search a lot of terrain, rather than intensely search the trails he used.  I was one of the searchers.  I found his femur.  I don't get called into the sierra unless the search has been going for a day or 2 already.  You can go backpacking now with reasonable safety.  Don't let me scare you too much.  Just don't make me come looking for you.  If there is a heavy snow fall, the best bet is to stay put and wait for the professionals to come get you out.  Don't get away from trails by wondering on the snow thinking you are on trail...  Also, you will be making terrible time without snow gear...  Take extra fuel for your stove.  If it snow hard you will need it to melt snow to stay hydrated while your rescue is underway."
socalhiking,2hv6lc,tamman2000,3,Tue Sep 30 22:39:02 2014 UTC,"I would recommend extreme caution if you are a newbie.  9000 feet in the Sierras during October is NOT the time to get acquainted with cold/wet weather on a multi-day backpacking trip.   I've hiked and camped in <50 weather many times but wetness really compounds the situation.  As an example, last weekend we camped at a dispersed site near Big Meadows and it was consistently wet in some form or another (from sprinkle to rain to snow) for most of the time.   Of our 7 tents, 3 were found to have woefully inadequate waterproofing - and 1 was brand new.  This isn't something you want to find out on night 2 of your trek.   Everything is harder when it's wet.  Hiking, cooking, building a fire, staying warm, dealing with layers of clothing, staying clean, etc.    You know how they say mountain storms can appear out of nowhere?  I didn't really believe it until last weekend.  I saw blue skies turn to dark in 20 minutes.    We did a couple of hikes, including one to Mitchell Peak but we were unable to find the top as snow obscured the trail, and thick fog/clouds made visibility poor.  I decided to turn back when I realized the snow was obscuring my footsteps and I had no idea where the trail was.  Not a problem on a day hike, but kind of becomes an issue when you're on a 4 day trek and both forwards and backwards are snowed over.  If you think you're a newbie, I'd strongly recommend you wait until summer rolls around again or stick to camping/day hikes.  If you must go, be very, very confident your equipment is up to the task and take a lot more layers than you think you will need."

Also, they both give you access to various climates. Icehouse canyon starts with a creek lined by deciduous trees. On the way up, you start seeing chipmunks and if you're lucky, bighorn sheep. Eventually, you're in sub-alpine and even alpine climates (above the tree line). There are already plenty of hikers doing Mt. Baldy, but the Icehouse trail gives you access to 2 equally challenging hikes to Cucamonga Peak and Ontario Peak. They're both less than 9000 feet high, but are less traveled.

socalhiking,2h5z1t,keepmoving2,1 point,Mon Oct 20 19:04:47 2014 UTC,"Icehouse canyon has water on the first few miles. I usually dayhike, but there are two developed campgrounds and a few undeveloped. Icehouse canyon has Kelly camp, which will probably be cold and windy now. A good alternative is the short hike up Timber Mountain.  Devil's backbone doesn't have water at all.

I always hike midweek and usually only see 1-2 other people, if anyone at all. The friendly bloke we met on the trail today was a PCT hiker named Brian. It was his second time thru-hiking! I gave him a care package of extra food before he went on his merry way, and then we were alone again. Mt Baden-Powell is a great hike and the summit is over 9000 feet, so the views are immense and the winding 2 highway makes you feel like you're a world away as soon as you're out of sight of the city. highly recommend it! and you can stop by Kratka Ridge on the way back down--super steep super short hike up to an abandoned ski lift/resort. it's so old and creepy yet nostalgic feeling. i like watching the sunset there sometimes!"

socalhiking,2glt1p,timmymandering,13,Tue Sep 16 22:46:35 2014 UTC,"Generally recommended to avoid the desert during the summer by the same folks avoiding the trails in the winter.  I don't know your skill or your experience so I'll preface the following with a warning.  So you've decided to hike the desert!  You'll notice trails disappear from even five feet off to the side.  Amazing camouflage!  Keep this in mind.  Really the only times to hike during the summer are from 5am to ~9/10am, and then again from ~4pm to 8pm.  Dawn to dusk with a siesta around mid-day.  During your siesta you want to be in the shade, off the sand.  The best places are in rocky canyons as you may even find some water under sand in permanent shaded areas.  You'll also find most animals in the same spots..  lots of sheep scat, cat prints, bunches of mice.  I recommend not staying in an area surrounded by mice droppings as A) hantavirus and B) snakes.  If you can't find a canyon or rocky shade, this is where you bring your keffiyeh and umbrella.  String your keffiyeh over bushes or hiking poles to create a shaded and open shelter.  Same with the umbrella.  You can do the same with an opaque tarp or blanket but those are heavier.  Water is absolutely critical.  You know this already but don't know just how much.  We hike in 80/90F up in the mountains all the time.  We think we know how much water we need.  But the desert...  it dries you out so very quick.  4L per day not including food rehydrating.  Drink whenever you begin feeling dehydrated, don't ration it.  I'd rather know when I'm about to run out of water and hike back out than to already be in the grips of heat stroke with a gallon still in my pack.  It's important to wear long sleeve, pants, a complete head covering, etc.  Sure if you're just out to see the sights and hop back in your car, wear whatever the hell you want.  But spending a day or two under that sun will teach you quick.  Oh, and cotton.  cotton cotton cotton.   loose-fitting cotton.  No wicking fabrics.  No wool, no polyester, no polypro.  Keep the water against your skin.  Let sweat work to cool you by naturally evaporating at the proper rate.  Wicking fabrics will pull liquid off your skin before it has a chance to evaporate, robbing you of the phase change temperature drop."
socalhiking,2glt1p,summiter,2,Wed Sep 17 00:07:57 2014 UTC,Thanks for detailed response. You sound familiar with the area. Could you give me some input on how camping there works? Do we just drive and find a place and set up camp? Are there rules about building fires?
socalhiking,2glt1p,star_pilot,2,Thu Sep 18 02:49:55 2014 UTC,"established (car camping) sites or backcountry. car camping are reservation or first come first serve, check the official NPS j tree website. backcountry is at least 1 mile from roads, 500 ft from trails.

For instance there is a cabin in use near Casa Vieja Meadows thats about 6 miles into Golden Trout Wilderness. The ranger at Black Rock told me it's still owned by the same person who owned it before the Wilderness was established in the late 70s and will most likely fall into Parks Service like the cabin in the meadows did, which is now dilapidated. But Santa Anita isn't wilderness designated and with the proper permits NF land can be used for pretty much anything. My guess is there is some kind of long term lease with the gov involved in this.

But I am also very comfortable soloing class 4 rock, some of the other folks up there were not having as much fun as I was. Technically it isn't challenging, you should be fine.   Physically however:  Split mountain was the almost the most physically challenging 14er I've climbed (out of like 7) second only to Mt Williamson. You start at the valley floor and have to climb over 7500 feet to reach the summit, and it is a slog pretty much the whole way. The trail sucks to red lake, and then there is no trail, just scree and boulders to hop and trudge up, so make sure you're in kickass shape if you take this badboy on.  That said it was a ton of fun and I checked another peak off the list (and got to go with my Dad, always cool) so I highly recommend it for a weekend trip especially if you don't want to see any other people the whole time."
socalhiking,2fu1b5,avocadoss,4,Mon Sep 8 19:15:04 2014 UTC,"Your possibilities are almost limitless but out the places you mentioned I suggest Pear Lake since it's difficulty to beauty ratio is perfect for a beginner. It's a pretty easy 3 or 4 hour hike to the lake and you have some options for day hikes. Alta Peak is one of the better views to be had in the South West Sierras and it's a short, moderate hike from Pear Lake. If you happen to bring a more advanced hiker with you there are amazing off trail options like Moose Lake.  This time of year you should be ok for summer gear but be prepared for rain, the South Sierras have been really monsoonal this year. I got snowed on at 10k ft near Cottonwood Lakes a few weeks ago so always be ready for that as well. Call the rangers but I would expect 70s during the day and 40s at night with possible drop into the high 20s if you get weather."
socalhiking,2fu1b5,tylorjams,2,Mon Sep 8 22:11:37 2014 UTC,I believe Pear lake it will be. Do you think it will be okay to grab a permit the morning of the trip? And what would you suggest to bring as backups for the possibility of rain/snow?
socalhiking,2fu1b5,tylorjams,1 point,Mon Sep 8 22:44:48 2014 UTC,"You should be ok the day of, it's not a super popular spot. Just make sure you have a shelter that will keep you dry and a sleeping bag rated to around 20 or 30 if you wear clothes to bed. Clothing that will keep you warm and dry down to 32 but chances are cold weather will come at night if it does."
socalhiking,2fu1b5,OldSchoolBatman,3,Tue Sep 9 00:21:04 2014 UTC,I hike Sequoia/Kings Canyon/Mineral King a good amount and just got back from a 4 day camping trip in mineral king I used a ledge featherlite 20+ mummy bag and I ended up using it as a blanket but I'd definitely call the ranger station before and ask about weather conditions. As for hikes I've done pear lake twice (once in the snow and only made it to the watchtower because of the ice) and it's absolutely beautiful. If you go up through the watchtower its a amazing view a long climb but you could make it to pear lake in one day if you hike at a good pace and have a light pack. Happy camping and be safe!
socalhiking,2fu1b5,OldSchoolBatman,2,Mon Sep 8 20:42:39 2014 UTC,"Awesome Batman! I'm trying to get into this more. I just bought my first back, its not extremely light, but I think it will do the trick. Thanks for the tip! I'll give them a call before hand. Do you think permit wise I would be okay getting it the day of for these hikes? I believe Pear Lake is the place I want to go, and I hear there two ways to the lake: watchtower and hump?"
socalhiking,2fu1b5,hiltonsd,2,Mon Sep 8 22:43:08 2014 UTC,"If you want to spend the night your going to need a wilderness permit, and your car day pass is good for seven days, and yes there are two ways up I've only done the watchtower trail because it has a amazing cliff view."

socalhiking,2fokqb,TheTallandtheShort,3,Wed Oct 29 19:01:56 2014 UTC,"Most people go to Catalina for a reason.  The other islands are a little too small, so it can be windy at times.

I usually mountain bike, so we mostly take the fire roads. But I have hiked a few segments of the transcatalina trail, and it has some epic views. Especially near little harbor."

Book on Reserve America, and visitcatalinaisland.com for Catalina. I've camped Santa Cruz. The sites are inland a little bit so its isolated from wind. There's a tiny beach, popular for kayaking, amazing cliff hikes."

I would just yelp ""Bowen Ranch so cal"" and it should pop up. The ranch is where u go to get access and park ur car. It's 10 bucks for an overnight stay per person and the ranch is run by hippies who go by the honor system if noone is attending the booth (but they do have cameras so don't ruin it for anyone and always pay!) It's a beautiful but kinda dangerous 2 mile hike down and into the canyon where a desert river runs. Down in the canyon there are Geothermal Hot springs and Through it runs a cool calm river perfect for swimming. It's dog friendly and normally there are couples and people of all ages during the day and there's always 5-10 people who stay the night down in the canyon and set up campfires and pitch a tent. I don't want to scare you but in the canyon there are usually older naked guys who like to camp there so what I did is just move down river or camp opposite of them from the river. They were nice and most just like to smoke weed and stuff so they werent dangerous just a bit of discretion so you know what to expect. I loved it maybe u might too"

There was a slight breeze too which made it more bearable and the summit was really pleasant.

socalhiking,2db6gq,scottawr,7,Tue Aug 12 05:22:43 2014 UTC,"Go left at the notch.  I went on the northern side and hung off a chimney and scuttled down to the saddle... Possibly a very stupid move but i survived.  The route up to Iron is sandy and not good footing.  It's best to climb directly up from the notch rather than go to the south and shimmy up to the tree.  You should be very comfortable with class III, maybe class IV.  Your backup plan is to reassend west baldy...  A long way up and probably 4-5hrs before hitting a water source.  Alternatively you can descend into Whidman Ranch and the rest of those antisocial nutbag farmers.  They literally have cameras in the trees.  They'll take your license and escort you out.... Quite serious about private property even if you explain it was an emergency descent.  There is no trail... Only a few cairns to point direction.  Maps are of little use if you do abandon down the gulch.  Many cliffs and hard to bisect the Heaton Flats trail.  I would not recommend it for anyone unfamilar with the route.  I did it solo  but only after scoping it out a couple times and critiquing the route from summitpost.com and Google satellite images.  Good luck to you and BRING AMPLE WATER"
socalhiking,2db6gq,summiter,1 point,Tue Aug 12 06:40:18 2014 UTC,Thanks for the reccomendations!
socalhiking,2db6gq,grammacrobat,2,Wed Aug 13 00:11:51 2014 UTC,Summiter is correct in his reccomendations. I did the same route last summer Baldy > Iron. There is a use trail most of the way although it gets obscured by mazanita fairly often (wear pants you will be trudging through nasty vegitation). Some kind soul did set up a series of cairns along the way but they're few and far between.  Gunsight notch is dicey but doable. I went up and over it although I've read it's possible to go around...that didn't seem like a good option when I was there. Part of the climb goes through the branches of a tree which pulled a full liter of water out of my pack and I lost it down the cliff. So bring more water than you think is too much. I got pretty dehydrated on my way down Iron because of it.   Gunsight notch is definitely the crux of the hike but there are two more areas that required some serious thought as well so be aware that it's not over after the notch.    I lost the trail when I got to Iron and ended up just hiking straight up this really loose scree field which is just good practice for the hike down to Heaton Flats!   I'm really jealous - have fun.  Edit: This guy does it on Skis and bails out half way. It's in snow so the trail isn't visible but the video shows the general route. His escape route looks pretty miserable.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuNR-Qy064k

Cooler temps and sometimes a nice breeze really help, though we were pretty toasty on the Temescal Ridge Trail last weekend. Temescal Canyon to Temescal Peak was 10.5 miles RT. Start as early as possible, and it is better. Watch out for rattlesnakes. We saw one and heard another just off the trail. Sullivan Ridge to Sullivan Canyon also fits your goals (9.25 miles RT). Los Liones Canyon to Parker's Mesa Overlook is also very close to the coast (7.3 miles RT). These are all well-traveled trails, so expect a lot of company.  Alternatively, you could head to much higher elevation where it will be cooler (Baldy, San Jacinto, etc.)."

socalhiking,2c9no1,strikingtheroot,1 point,Fri Aug 1 18:35:00 2014 UTC,"Thank you all for your suggestions. /u/it_refugee's Vincent Gap comment gave me an idea. I ended up doing Dawson's Saddle to Mt. Baden-Powell. I was more then willing to trade 1000' of elevation gain for an extra mile.  It was fairly busy. There was a 100 mile marathon going on and ran into many marathoners on the trail, though I didn't encounter any other hikers until after reaching the summit, and more on my way down. I was on the trail by about 8:00 am and was back at my car at 1:45, missing the rain by about 45 minutes.   The summit of BP was busy with hikers coming up from Vincent Gap. On my way down from the summit, I encountered many people headed up the trail. Like I said earlier, I missed the rain by 45 minutes so some of the other hikers definitely got stuck in the rain.  If anyone wants to hike from Dawson's Saddle, there are two trail heads you can take. One is near the white out building and the other is to the east, just around the curve of the road. They're about 100' or so from each other. Take the second one (more to the east). The trail by the white outbuilding is horrible at the beginning, with a scramble up some loose and unforgiving dirt. The second (east) trail head is much nicer and easier to use."
socalhiking,2c6gjf,P-Helen,3,Wed Jul 30 21:23:28 2014 UTC,"Below is a quick story that I impulsively decided to write. It's not written very well as it was rushed a bit, but nevertheless you may enjoy it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I had a lapse of taking pictures about 2/3 into our hike as there was a lot of brush. I would have added some more pictures to this album, but the pictures are on an external hard drive that is currently being recovered. The pictures in the album were previously exported to my main internal drive so I still have them.   The engine roars in the silence of the dark, cold, distant morning. We fly on down the road and slip onto the freeway for our destination, Coal Canyon. As we park, we shuffle around in the dark gathering our supplies; hats, sunglasses, water, food. And now the journey begins. There is one thought and image in all of our minds; to reach the summit of Sierra Peak in a reasonable amount of time so we can escape the wrath of the midday sun. We quickly find ourselves at the trailhead and I call out to remember pace, recalling back our days of running cross country. As we ascend the trail we soon find ourselves in the harsh shadow of the mountain with the sun’s jagged beams stretching across into the distance. We take in the sight for a moment’s time and continue on up. Along the way we encounter several steep sections, almost having to crawl up the slope. This is what it is all about. This is adventure. Before we know it, we see radio towers not too far away. That can’t be it already, can it? The very thought echoed throughout the group. We soon find ourselves standing at the entrance to the towers overlooking the small world below. Turning our view to the left, we see a higher, more impressive peak out into the distance. That must be Sierra Peak, there’s no way we could have reached it already. And so we continued our journey. Along the way we encountered a fellow adventurer whom expressed that we had indeed passed Sierra Peak. And yet, we continued our journey. At Beek’s place we settled down for lunch. We take in the sights whilst contemplating if we should go on or turn back. We won’t make it to the other towers. Even so, we continued our journey. We quickly decide that it’s time to turn around, whether there’s another trail we don’t know yet. We come across a trail, but where does it go? Should’ve brought a map. Sierra Peak is so far away now and could be longer, but we don’t know where the mystery trail goes. And so we risked it and continued our journey. The minutes passed and we soon realized this trail went to the depths of Black Star Canyon, not where we wanted to go. Yet hidden in the cracks of the slope side we see an overgrown and worn out trail. Let’s check it out. We continue up the trail where it then stops and merges into what seems to be an animal trail. Well, it is going the way we want to go. And so we continued our journey. We walked upon the ridgeline as the explorers of a new world. It was a bit treacherous, but going back was no longer an option. The sun was getting to its highest point, our water was draining to the needs of our bodies, and the time was passing. No, we were in too deep. We tripped, we slipped, we fell, we yelled, and from this, our journey continued. Thick brush soon surrounded us, but wait, there is a trail ahead! We plunge through the brush, regardless of the brush’s grasping nails, yearning to trap us in. Finally we land down on the trail. Home free. We should be back soon. Despite the heat, we push on up the hill with the thought of rest and more water soon. Mounting the crest, our hearts sink. We are not any closer than we thought. Before our very eyes, a valley, a valley of exertion and despair that has to be crossed to get to the other side. With sinking hearts, our journey continued. This was no longer a hike of enjoyment; this was now a trek to overcome, to finish. The ascent was long and hard under the sun’s relentless rays. We reach the top and finally, truly saw where the trail was headed. Right back to the trailhead. Relief sweeps through us, despite previously knowing that we were headed in generally the right direction. Our water had just been depleted, and our food dispensed, but even so, spirits were reinvigorated, and so our journey continued. We pressed on through, making decent time regardless of the tightness, the dry mouths, and the aching muscles. Along the way we see Sierra Peak and Beek’s Place looming in the distance, as if taunting us. We finally make it back to the trailhead, snap a celebratory picture and continue on down the road. The time quickly passed and we made it back to the car. As we put our packs away and retrieved more water, this is where our journey ended. It was one hell of a ride, and lessons were had. This is the story of the worst and best hike of my life."
socalhiking,2c1sbv,oildig,3,Tue Jul 29 15:23:28 2014 UTC,"The Owens River, the one that flowed over those falls eventually made its way to Death Valley. At one point, it may have been possible (with some portage sections) to go by boat from Mono Lake to Death Valley. The last time that area saw any real water may have been 2 kya. More than likely, it was more than 5 kya. A very cool place to stop on US 395!"
socalhiking,2c1sbv,sdmichael,1 point,Tue Jul 29 20:23:14 2014 UTC,"From what I understand, the Owens River would still be flowing through there if William Mulholland hadn't used some shady tactics to obtain those water rights for the city of Los Angeles, which also resulted in the draining of Owens Lake."
socalhiking,2c1sbv,sdmichael,2,Tue Jul 29 21:58:05 2014 UTC,"No, the Owens River stopped flowing south of Owens lake about 2 kya. Climate change, the warming since the end of the last major glaciation, made the river stop, not Los Angeles."
socalhiking,2c1sbv,sdmichael,1 point,Tue Jul 29 22:14:51 2014 UTC,"Well yeah you're right that it didn't flow south of Owens Lake, but it was definitely Los Angeles that caused the lake to dry out.  from wikipedia:  ""After these water rights were secured, inflows to Owens Lake were almost completely diverted, which caused the lake to dry up by 1924."""
socalhiking,2c1sbv,sdmichael,3,Wed Jul 30 00:03:19 2014 UTC,"Yes, it was the City of Los Angeles that bought the water rights and diverted the entire flow of the Owens River into the aqueduct. The desiccation of Owens Lake created the largest source of toxic dust in the West as well. Currently, the Owens River does flow again to the lakebed, but only gets partly spread onto the lakebed. The rest gets rediverted into the aqueduct near Lubkin Canyon Road and US 395. A good book on the ""water wars"" in the Owens Valley is ""Water Seekers"" by Remi Nadeau. That being said, Fossil Falls is well south of the lakebed. Climate change (post-glacial warming) was still the cause of the lowering of the lake level to early 20th century levels and below the point where water would continue to flow south into Rose Valley via Haiwee Canyon."

They are at a former shoreline (I think the one about 2 kya) in some limestone/dolomite deposits. A rock quarry has removed some of them, but quite a few remain. I've spent quite a bit of time up in the Owens, sometimes chasing hang glider pilots around the valley. I also have done a lot of research on the highway itself (used to be US 6 as well, State 7 before 1935). The Burro Schmidt Tunnel area in the El Paso Mountains has lots of old mines to explore (with caution). The tailings are always worth a look."

socalhiking,2c1sbv,littledabwilldoya,1 point,Wed Jul 30 02:55:48 2014 UTC,"What's cool about the film museum is that they used to shoot all the old western movies in the Alabama Hills, which is just west of Lone Pine and just below Mt Whitney.  So they have a lot of that old-school western movie memorabilia, which admittedly appeals best to the baby boomer generation, but is still pretty cool even for younger people.  But they've made a lot of other movies there too and have a lot of non-western movie memorabilia too.  For example, Quentin Tarantino donated the stagecoach that the ""dentist"" drove in Django Unchained, which was also filmed in the Alabama Hills.    Unfortunately there isn't much to see in Manzanar because they intentionally wanted it to be destroyed, but the cemetary is still there and there's an interesting museum as well.  It's mostly just a good reality check to realize how fucked up it was that this country imprisoned some 10,000 Japanese-American CITIZENS for about 3 years in a middle-of-nowhere shithole where it's 100+ degrees in the summer and blizzarding in the winter."

I would recommend starting early like 6.30 or even earlier to beat the crowds at the parking lot and the heat. There are multiple trails to get to the top and on the way back you could do it as a loop or go to Mt Zion as well.
socalhiking,2bqd88,desidiver,1 point,Fri Jul 25 22:37:28 2014 UTC,Yes. Go early.  Beat the heat.
socalhiking,2bqd88,BraveOmeter,3,Fri Jul 25 22:40:01 2014 UTC,You can go via upper winter creek to the sierra madre trail. Up the steep way from sturdevant ling and easy rim trail or long and difficult Kenyon Devore trail. What's your max range? Most people can't do a few of them. Btw they are better in fall and winter as it's much cooler.
socalhiking,2bqd88,HikingFool,1 point,Fri Jul 25 22:54:58 2014 UTC,done it a bunch of times. highly recommend it. kind of strenuous but it's definitely worth it.

socalhiking,2bnbv4,tpm319,1 point,Fri Jul 25 20:41:07 2014 UTC,"By ""mammoth valley"" I believe they meant Mammoth Lakes in the eastern Sierra Nevada. I go there fairly often, Absolutely beautiful, high recommend. However it would be a 5 hour car ride from San Diego."
socalhiking,2bnbv4,Nickg__,1 point,Sat Jul 26 21:33:32 2014 UTC,"The town of Mammoth Lakes is great for camping/fishing. Lake Mary/George, Horseshoe, Twin, Convict Lakes are all close to tons of camping. If you want to backpack I recommend getting a permit and going to Lake Ediza, Garnet or 1000 Island Lake (lots of trout) which are located in the Ansel Adams Wilderness (just outside of the town of Mammoth). There's also great scenery & fishing around June, Gull and Silver Lake. Just north of Mammoth and just before Lee Vining, which accesses Yosemite from the east. The drive up Hwy 395 along the Sierra Nevada's is impressive and really makes the time go quickly. You can see the lower 48's highest mtn, Whitney, from 395 as you come into Lone Pine. Bishop is another nice town and has good fishing up in the mtns. If you want to stay a bit more local you can make a 2 1/2 hour drive up to Big Bear."

I am not famiilar with it and I got this on wiki: Mammoth Valley is a depression in Southern Utah between Hatch and Duck Creek. How far are you willing to drive?  I don't fish, but I have been to June Lake and it is really nice and I saw a lot of fishermen there.  There are also other lakes in that immediate area and I believe several campgrounds."

There is a 20ft section were you might have to place a hand or two, but I wouldn't consider it scrambling. Besides that the hike itself is nice, although steep.  Sandstone peak is far better and if you do want to do some scrambling you can take the detour to Tri Peaks."
socalhiking,2bic85,WeevilsWobble,1 point,Wed Jul 23 19:16:09 2014 UTC,Thank you! what makes sandstone so much better?
socalhiking,2bic85,WeevilsWobble,2,Wed Jul 23 20:46:35 2014 UTC,"Just to make sure, but this is the hike I'm referring to.  Bulldog road has some cool rock formations at the beginning, followed by a steep fire trail. There isn't much of a view once you start descending and the hike out is pretty tiring (although it does make a good training hike).  Sandstone is just all around a great hike with awesome views. It's quite a big longer than Bulldog if I recall correctly.  From Tripeaks you get cool views of Camarillo and Oxnard, and can see the line where the Spring fire was held (at least you could last winter, haven't been up since). In the beginning you can look down into Echo Cliffs and see climbers scaling the 200 foot cliff that forms part of the valley in that area. From Sandstone Peak you can see most of the Channel Islands on a clear day. Also at PCH and Yerba Buena Rd. (the road you take to get up to the trailhead from PCH) is Neptune's Net, an awesome roadside fish shake with a good beer selection."

socalhiking,2bc8ju,ParadigmBlender,6,Mon Jul 21 22:44:36 2014 UTC,"Yosemite of the San Gabriels   ""Half an hour’s easy rambling up the canyon brought me to the foot of “The Fall,” famous throughout the valley settlements as the finest yet discovered in the range. It is a charming little thing, with a voice sweet as a songbird’s, leaping some thirty-five or forty feet into around, mirror pool. The cliff back of it and on both sides is completely covered with thick, furry mosses, and the white fall shines against the green like a silver instrument in a velvet case. Here come the Gabriel lads and lassies from the commonplace orange groves, to make love and gather ferns and dabble away their hot holidays in the cool pool. They are fortunate in finding so fresh a retreat so near their homes. It is the Yosemite of San Gabriel. The walls, though not of the true Yosemite type either in form or sculpture, rise to a height of nearly two thousand feet. Ferns are abundant on all the rocks within reach of the spray, and picturesque maples and sycamores spread a grateful shade over a rich profusion of wild flowers that grow among the boulders, from the edge of the pool a mile or more down the dell-like bottom of the valley, the whole forming a charming little poem of wildness — the vestibule of these shaggy mountain temples.

The I did some cross country hiking for the first time (i.e got lost and scrambled west up and over a mountainside) and then found the trail leading south to Jennie Lakes, which was fucking beautiful, a little more crowded than Seville but with zero mosquitoes.   My only advice would be to call Lodgepole ranger station and ask them what the mosquito situation looks like. I guess it varies wildly depending on which lake they decide to mate in en masse, and apparently these ones don't give a shit that you are above 8,000 ft.

Be sure to fill up your water at Columbine Springs (about halfway up, just as you start climbing the switchbacks), as there is no water at Kelly Camp. Also, if you continue to follow the trail for about 1/4-mile past the camp (uphill), you'll have a great view of the Inland Empire (by which I mean, you'll see massive city blocks through the smog).

Parking area is a giant turnout area on the northside of the road.  First mile/mile and a half are along the PCT.  Definitely want to try this one again either solo or when the GF is feeling well enough"
socalhiking,2aswoc,grammacrobat,8,Tue Jul 15 22:02:04 2014 UTC,"I thought this was an interesting article but I completely disagree. While Death Valley is certainly an extreme environment, It's possible to get seriously hurt or killed in any wilderness situation if you do not have the experience or tools. Hiking has inherent risks, but they can be mitigated to a large degree.   Better advice would be ""Why you should never venture into the wilderness without proper planning and gear"""
socalhiking,2aswoc,beefofages,3,Tue Jul 15 22:07:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's possible to get hurt or killed in any wilderness situation, but it's much, much easier to do it in a place like Death Valley. It's so much easier to hike there without noticing that you're getting seriously dehydrated and exhausted. Not to mention how huge the park is, and how many people get lost there. I think some people really don't understand just how easy it is to seriously endanger yourself.  None of this is to say that someone with a lot of experience can't do it (and Legeno was actually found by two hikers, at least according to another article I read about it). But when you say ""proper planning,"" for most of us that might include ""wait until it's not the middle of summer."" Personally, I'm waiting until the fall - I just don't have any reason to try to do it now, and trying to push your limits in that environment can be deadly."

socalhiking,2aonwh,staycruzin,5,Mon Jul 14 17:50:07 2014 UTC,"Done the hike numerous times, and jumped once. You gotta do it with a group of friends. Makes for a better time - afterwards you can scramble down to the water and watch everyone else jump. It's pricey but it's a great experience when done right. (Side note: you have to get up early and sign off on waivers and hike with the group. You can't just show up at noon and try to jump. Least thats what they told us when I went.)"
socalhiking,2aonwh,manjfa,3,Mon Jul 14 21:07:44 2014 UTC,"I just recently did this and it was a blast. It is a little expensive but it gets cheaper if you are doing multiple jumps.  Go with a group of friends. What we did was arrive to sign in and get our weight taken, then we left ahead of the main group so we could hike on our own. Made it to the bridge first and waited for the rest to arrive before jumping.  I recommend this way, as I think hiking with just your friends is preferable."
socalhiking,2aonwh,Dmaggi727,1 point,Mon Jul 14 21:29:33 2014 UTC,"I completely agree, I have no interest of doing the hike in a group (besides my friends). Does the company offer videos or pics of the jump?"
socalhiking,2aonwh,Dmaggi727,1 point,Mon Jul 14 23:52:04 2014 UTC,"I don't think they did, but we took our own with our iPhones. Came out pretty good. You do get a free T-Shirt though.  Edit: If you take my advice and leave ahead of the group, I would suggest you make sure everyone is all ready to go ahead of time so you can book it as soon as they start their intro speech. Don't have to wait for someone to get their stuff in order or use the restroom or whatever. As long as you leave before they do, you should get to the bridge first. A group of 60 people goes a lot slower than your small group will.  The trail is pretty easy to lose, so you might get ""lost"" a bit but you can't really get THAT lost. Just follow the river until the end where you go up a little incline that leads to the bridge."

socalhiking,2aonwh,Dmaggi727,1 point,Mon Jul 14 23:59:52 2014 UTC,I did it end of March this year (although I've done the hike in past years as well).  There is definitely water but maybe not as much as usual. That will actually make the river crossings easier. The path crosses the river several times (bring shoes you don't mind if they get wet in case).

There were a few trails after the ridge, but i dont think potato can be part of the loop - i think basically you have to go through scorpion.  BTW, it looks like a short hike on the map - only 10 miles or something - but crossing the ridge was the hardest hiking I've done in SB. Prisoner's camp has no water - so take that into account if you plan on sleeping there. It's a hot and shade free trek.  That said, take a look at google maps for a trail! Maybe I'm wrong :)"

socalhiking,2a0qas,feartrich,5,Mon Jul 7 17:20:49 2014 UTC,Was in the 80s at the trailhead and was pretty toasty on the ascent. Was nice and breezy at the top and quite a bit cooler. Wasn't thinking of the temp that much so it couldn't have been that bad. The verticality of the hike was the tough part. 750' vertical per mile.
socalhiking,2a0qas,beefofages,3,Mon Jul 7 21:09:16 2014 UTC,"It's rarely very hot at 10,000 feet. 100 degrees at 4,000 ft means 85 at 10,000 feet. Mount Baldy, CA at 4,000 feet tops out at about 100 this season, so 85 is really the maximum temperature at the summit. In terms of the weather when OP got to the top, it might have been only been 65 at the summit."

You'll find Columbine Springs about halfway up where you should stock up on water (it's the only available water source). From there, proceed to the saddle and hang a right to Kelly Camp. It's usually empty and there are plenty of flat spots to pitch a tent. When you wake up in the morning, be sure to hike up to Ontario Peak. It'll take you an hour or so, but the view is worth it. Also, the hike back down the mountain is quick and easy, so don't worry about expending energy exploring the area."
socalhiking,29q1f6,OldTarwater,1 point,Thu Jul 17 05:27:03 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I'll definitely give that a shot. Since hiking Baldy in March I really want to bag Ontario Peak. Are there any required permits to hike and/or camp up there, or is just an adventure pass acceptable?"

socalhiking,29g35l,cLin,2,Mon Jun 30 06:37:07 2014 UTC,Absolutely bro. I'm pretty new to the hiking thing (this was my 5th hike) but it was by far my favorite.  Edit: Just make sure you go early and bring plenty of water it's very hot and dry down there. I had about 32 oz of water and a gatorade but it's recommended to bring a gallon just in case.
socalhiking,29g35l,GentlemanMatt,2,Mon Jun 30 10:59:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I bet it was pretty dry out there.  Can't wait for there to be water around here again. The first fall makes for an amazing water slide!"

socalhiking,2995t7,somedudeinlosangeles,3,Fri Jun 27 17:04:39 2014 UTC,"I'll put some perspective on this but I'll say right now the skewed visitor demographic is unlikely due to the relative unknown-ness of Charles Young or other ethnic founding fathers.  African-americans are more likely to be born into inner cities or urban environments because few large communities are situated in the wilderness where a love of nature would be born.  The people I know were born in Syracuse, Charlotte, or local here to LA. If I can even convince them to go hiking it's likely to Baldin Hills Overlook or Runyon...  I've only moderate success with 'longer' trips on Baldy.  Of a dozen or so only one is a backpacker/outdoorsman in the context of the article. They would just much rather hang out in bars or do something in the city.  That's not a race thing... that's just how anyone from a city would behave.  If you interview a hundred caucasians from NYC and ask how many enjoy true hiking and you'll get a similar ratio as that 7% figure quoted in the article.  ...IMO"

socalhiking,2995t7,desidiver,1 point,Sat Jun 28 00:25:56 2014 UTC,I read a trip report once where these guys tried to climb some huge peaks in the Indian Himalayas but ran into cultural issues where the locals wouldn't let them climb certain mountains because they were the gods houses or something.
socalhiking,2995t7,scottawr,3,Sat Jun 28 01:08:41 2014 UTC,"Its pretty common in Himalayas not just India, Machhapuchchhre in Nepal is like that. For some peaks reaching 10-20 ft below the true summit is the norm just out of respect for the local culture. Kanchenjunga being one of them.   But to climb any peak above 6000m in Indian Himalayas you need a permit from Indian Mountaineering Foundation so if the peak is considered sacred they won't issue the permit in the first place. Permits are required to climb on most of peaks in Himalayas anyway."

socalhiking,2995t7,desidiver,1 point,Sat Jun 28 21:21:14 2014 UTC,"Shivaji:       Shivaji Bhonsle (Marathi [ʃiʋaˑɟiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c. 1627/1630  – 3 April 1680), was an Indian warrior king and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan, Shivaji, in 1674, carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of an independent Maratha kingdom with Raigad as its capital.  Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with the help of a disciplined military and well-structured administrative organisations. He innovated military tactics, pioneering the guerilla warfare methods (Shiva sutra or ganimi kava), which leveraged strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise and focused pinpoint attacks to defeat his larger and more powerful enemies. From a small contingent of 2,000 soldiers inherited from his father, Shivaji created a force of 100,000 soldiers; he built and restored strategically located forts both inland and coastal to safeguard his territory. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions, and promoted the usage of Marathi and Sanskrit, rather than Persian, in court and administration.  Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus. Particularly in Maharashtra, debates over his history and role have engendered great passion and sometimes even violence as disparate groups have sought to characterise him and his legacy.

You're best bet is to put a few hours of driving in and head up to the eastern sierra's. Plenty of entry points off 395 through lone pine, big pine and bishop. The hiking and fishing up there is second to none in California."
socalhiking,290qts,knucklehed,1 point,Wed Jun 25 13:53:23 2014 UTC,Thanks! where in the eastern seirras? I have been to kearsarge pass and it was great but I dont want to go to that high of an elevation right now.
socalhiking,290qts,knucklehed,2,Wed Jun 25 15:30:25 2014 UTC,"Big Pine Creek Trail west of Big Pine on Glacier Mtn Rd has some pretty awesome campsites to base camp and plenty of lakes to hike up to fish at or backpack to.   Go up to South Lake off 168 west of Bishop and hike up the basin, Long Lake is beautiful and offers wonderful fishing. You can hike all the way up to the pass and over and stay in Dusy Basin. Sabrina Lake in the same area offers quite a bit as well. In my opinion everything off 168 towards Aspendell is the gem of the sierras. It's my entry/ exit point to the JMT and usually my first choice when I need to get away for a few days of backpacking and fishing.   Unfortunately most of the trails to the Eastern Sierras are going to be up in elevation. The trailhead to Kearsarge Pass at Onion Valley is 9k+ elevation, most of the offerings up there are in that range."
socalhiking,290qts,Rheanne,1 point,Wed Jun 25 16:40:24 2014 UTC,Cottonwood Lakes are amazing imo. Maybe check those out.
socalhiking,290qts,mtnbikerdude,1 point,Wed Jun 25 19:24:25 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of places in the Eastern Sierras. As some have mentioned Cottonwood Lakes is close and they contain CA Golden Trouts. The trail is about 7 miles and the trailhead parking is at 10,000 ft so I would definitely acclimate if you are not used to the elevation. This area is under special regualtion where fishing doesnt open until July 1st.   Other places that I can think of are South Lake (near bishop), Rock Creek Lake, Mammoth Lakes, and many more along the way.   There is an Eastern Sierra fishing guide (40 mb file) where the CDFW did a survey of a majority of the Eastern Sierra bodies of water. It is very detailed and useful if you're trying to scout out areas to fish. It isn't 100% accurate but I think they did a good job doing the survey.   Good luck and hope you catch lots!"

Pissed and deciding to just walk around in the neighborhood we were in we stumbled across a beautiful trail behind a school.   It wasn't until we got to the bottom of the trail that we saw the ""trail closed"" signs. I'm not too sure why it was close down, but the trail was obviously not maintained.   I'm not sure how others will feel about the ethics of us using a closed trail, since usually when this happens it's because they're trying to nurse the wildlife back into health. All I gotta say is, goddamn the view is beautiful and it remains one of my favorite hikes.   The incline back up is a killer workout btw. It's interesting starting off going downhill and trecking back up to end it.

I encourage everyone to just give generalizations and clues to vague locations if anything at all. If you really do have a cool place that you would like to share, private messaging is far better.  Part of the enjoyment and pleasure of secret spots is that they're secret. Sharing them with your close friends is part of the enjoyment. Remember that what you post here doesn't just get seen by a few people but by a surprisingly large amount of people.  I know most will argue that all of this info is already out there, nothing is undiscovered and while that is definitely true for our area, I've seen firsthand what a little leaked info on a message board does to a place. While it was traveled before, the devastation that was left afterwards was just super depressing. I promise you that information definitely has an impact.  From how my fly fishing group operates, the best way to share cool places with like minded people is NOT through sharing online, but sharing in person by organizing outings to get to know those around your area that love what you love."

socalhiking,28k7zk,Raptor01,5,Thu Jun 19 16:41:53 2014 UTC,"I did it. It sucked. The climb is exposed and sucks when it's hot. Then, you go along the top for a while observing the beautiful scenery of quarry operations. The worst part was the descent. It was steep, overgrown, full of poison oak, and offered neither nice views or shade. At the bottom, you start the actual trail to the falls. That's a very nice trail for a few miles, out and back. Then, after seeing the falls, you had to do the same thing all over again."

socalhiking,28k6r4,onmybike,1 point,Thu Jun 19 21:17:38 2014 UTC,"I probably should have mentioned i'm taking my girlfriend, so a lot of these redundancies are because she's doing a day hike properly:  just bringing a hydration pack and a sun hat.  I ended up ditching the trail stool.  The jetboil and Pad Thai were for a picnic for my girlfriend and I.  I don't know if you've tried the BP Pad Thai, but that stuff is ridiculously good!  It's just as good as pad thai you'd get at your favorite Thai restaurant, IMO.  Two knives, because I wanted to bring the ESEE 4 but I wanted to have a knife accessible without having to take off the pack.  I can't wear my ESEE 4 on my belt while my pack is on, but I can keep my karambit in my pocket.  So two knives.    Less is more, I get it.  When I do overnighters or weekend trips, I have less redundancies and try to keep my base weight down.  I have a lighter hammock system and a lighter stove system for my overnighters, and I don't bring the trail stool.  I like to keep my backpacks packed so my day pack ends up with my older heavier gear.  Today I was only dealing with a 6 mile round trip day hike that's relatively easy.  I am barely carrying anything, and a couple extra pounds won't hinder me at all.   Jacket is a great tip.  I always have a frogg toggs top stuff in my backpack, it's just not pictured.

socalhiking,28iqsh,daemionx,2,Thu Jun 19 03:17:12 2014 UTC,"Wow that total weight is impressive!  If you're into fishing, you could add a light/collapsible pole.  A couple fresh trout at some of the lakes you'll be passing could be a welcome departure from the prepared meals you're taking.  Just don't depend on it in case you end up sucking at fishing.  :)  Make sure your mosquito net is easily accessible when hiking.  Those buggers are fierce and will bite through clothing too if it's flush against your skin.  Not sure about the frisbee if you're hiking solo.  You probably won't be setting up camp with random hikers; the only time you'll have a chance to chat are at the resupply points and at the top of the passes when people stop to enjoy the view or eat lunch.  I'm envious of you.  It's been years since my trip, and I'd love to do it again.  Good luck, and report back with pics!"

Does sound tasty to be sure (and probably a good way to pass time - I tend to camp at lakes). Any advice?  I've heard some years the mosquitoes are just awful and other years there are basically none. I do tend to get eaten alive by them if they are out so hopefully it won't be too bad this year.

I really really love my dog, I'm extremely attached but if he took off and all I had on was some shorts you better believe I'm not going after him. If you're taking your pet into the backcountry they need to be trained, obedient, and on a leash. Some places don't require the leash but if you don't have full confidence in the fist two you need to tie up the pup. Also, as bad as it sounds when you bring your pet into the backcountry you have to be willing to make a really hard decision really quickly. Saving a dogs life isn't worth loosing your own."
socalhiking,28duu5,tylorjams,6,Tue Jun 17 21:26:49 2014 UTC,One of the main reasons they are completely NOT allowed in National Parks like Yosemite. Way too dangerous for the dogs and the people.

Non-native species can be really destructive in sensitive ecosystems and NPs are simply more protected in general than NF and wilderness areas."

socalhiking,2818bs,daemionx,1 point,Fri Jun 13 09:51:19 2014 UTC,I totally will. Should I put in for one now? or week of I should be fine?
socalhiking,2818bs,erin_said,2,Fri Jun 13 10:00:47 2014 UTC,"it's better if you put in for it now (it's free minus the cost of actually faxing the permit in if you have to pay for that).  Call ahead and see what's open to maximize your chances of getting your permit request accepted.  That being said I was just out at San G this past weekend and did a walk-in permit on Saturday morning at like 9:00 a.m. for Summit Camp via South Fork Trail (which is pretty popular) and didn't have a problem.  Water is pretty limited right now in that area, and the only reliable water source I found was at South Fork Meadows, so wherever you camp you'll probably have to pack water up from there.  Here's some more information about the different trailheads/trail camps and water sources.  I've found that sometimes the website isn't super accurate, but if you find a route you think you'll like with a water source that says it's good then call the rangers and make sure.  They are very friendly and I've never found them to be wrong (they have people out checking the wilderness constantly - it's more patrolled than any wilderness area around here that I've seen).  I've heard great things about the Momyer Trail and Alger Creek Camp, and according to the report water seems to be at all of those trail camps right now.  Anyway good luck!"
socalhiking,2818bs,daemionx,1 point,Tue Jun 17 17:00:12 2014 UTC,"Sooner than later is better as you have to either mail/fax it. You can also pick up permits at a ranger station the day you go, I think, but they have to be there, have to have some available (there are quotas per campsite), etc."

It's not very long (3 miles out and back?) but lots of ups and downs and the oasis itself is incredible.

socalhiking,27unjb,curlyhoward,2,Thu Jun 12 00:01:51 2014 UTC,I would also recommend Mastodon Peak and Lost Palm Oasis. It's on the east side of the park but you meander through washes and eventually scramble up to the peak (and an old mine). You can tack on Lost Palm Oasis since the trail intersects with Mastadon to make it a decent day hike

Once you have seen a plant a couple times, you can record location and submit it to Calflora quite quickly.  Not quite sure what they are doing with the data which inspired the attempt at bringing in the public to help, but it makes sense that someone would want to know the ranges of plants in California."

socalhiking,27cysr,grammacrobat,1 point,Thu Jun 5 06:40:14 2014 UTC,Yes. 4am start on Baldy. Be back down by 8am. Drive to Forest Falls by 9:15. Summit San G and return to car by 3:30pm. Drive to Palm Springs by 4:45pm. Catch tram and hike San Jack and catch last tram back down before 9:45pm. Less than 24 but yes a lot of driving.
socalhiking,27cysr,summiter,1 point,Thu Jun 5 09:20:30 2014 UTC,I've done the triple crown before but you're estimating only 6 hours for Gorgonio after doing Baldy?  That's a 20mi roundy in the middle of the day...
socalhiking,27cysr,Fargone,1 point,Thu Jun 5 21:02:24 2014 UTC,"I'm going to feel comfortable running down San G between halfway and wilderness boundary. I may start earlier on Baldy. I am going on a practice hike to the tram. I am hoping to do it within 5 hours, that seems very reasonable considering the elevation gain. So maybe even four hours. Whatever gives me more time for San G."
socalhiking,27cysr,Fargone,5,Thu Jun 5 23:36:16 2014 UTC,For keeping your glycogen levels up I recommend Clif Shot Bloks. I generally go through a pack per ten miles and I haven't hit the wall since I started eating them.

socalhiking,27cysr,scottawr,1 point,Thu Jun 5 20:19:27 2014 UTC,The differences are mostly just personal preference. I tried virtually every variety of carb-loading product on the market and found that Shot Bloks did not make me ill (like those disgusting gels) and were reasonably tasty and cheap.
socalhiking,27cysr,scottawr,1 point,Thu Jun 5 20:35:59 2014 UTC,"Thank you brother, I'm definitely going to go with the Shot Blocs. I remember enjoying a few of the flavors I tried in the past."

socalhiking,27cysr,scottawr,2,Thu Jun 5 19:36:18 2014 UTC,"I have begun looking for a cooler, it's somewhere in the garage.

socalhiking,26rarf,Valtaire0,9,Thu May 29 03:40:06 2014 UTC,"Laguna Coast Wilderness is good. You can park there for $3 and take the back way to get into Crystal Cove park, which is nice, but costs $15 to park. Crystal Cove can get busy, but also has some backcountry camp sites.  If you don't mind going a little further south, there's a national park area off Ortega heading towards Lake Elsinore. The parking is right across from the candy store (you need an adventure pass). There are the lower falls, the Chiquito Falls trail, and the San Juan loop on the parking side. Across the street is Sitton Peak (awesome 10 mile round trip) and other chances of a longer hike with a little less elevation.  Also, Holy Jim is great, and you can go all the way to Santiago peak (the upper holy jim trail - not the divide road, though you need to take the road partway). It's a 15ish mile round trip with about 4000' elevation. Of course, you can stop and turn around at any time.  There are a bunch of trails at Casper's Wilderness park and O'Neill park. These cost $3 to park at or you can get an OC Parks pass.   I live in South County and we hike every weekend trying to stay local because we don't want too long of a drive. We just recently did the Arroyo Trabucco trail - starting at O'Neill and turned around at the Oso overpass (a little under 10 miles total I think) because I am nursing a knee thing and needed something without a lot of elevation."

Once you are on top if you follow the other trail for 100yds or so you can see down into the east fork river and down to the bridge to nowhere cool to see it from a different angle.   And be quiet and you might see sheep."

socalhiking,26o7kh,grammacrobat,6,Wed May 28 05:06:43 2014 UTC,Trailhead to the pass is a demanding 11 mile hike with over 6k feet of elevation gain. From the top of the pass you're free to tackle either Mt. Tyndall or Mt. Williamson with a 2k ft class 3 scramble to either summit.

socalhiking,26i77j,brycestep,2,Mon May 26 07:09:57 2014 UTC,"Mammoth Lakes area will be crowded during the summer so there won't be much solitude. You should try Coldwater Campground, it is close to Lake Mary and the Duck Pass trailhead starts there. I feel that Coldwater Campground is further from the other campsites in the area so it might feel more quiet. Don't forget bug repellent, mosquitos will be thick in the summer.   Lots of great fishing at the lakes and of course in the backcountry. If you want to get a site for sure, make sure you make a reservation. Campgrounds in area"
socalhiking,26i77j,mtnbikerdude,2,Mon May 26 22:47:29 2014 UTC,Funny that you mention this. Just got back today from 3 days in Ansel Adams Wilderness starting at Mammoth.

socalhiking,26i77j,tiredofpegging,2,Wed May 28 06:24:28 2014 UTC,"Lots of good suggestions here. Definitely if you want to be in the thick of it camping around Twin Lakes or Lake Mary is definitely the place to be. Lots of great fishing and hiking in that area.  For potentially a bit more seclusion look into camping a bit to the north in the June Lake area as well. It's not as central to Mammoth, but I think your odds of finding a more quiet place to camp are much higher."

socalhiking,26981q,whitecompass,4,Fri May 23 00:03:42 2014 UTC,"If you go during the week, it is not that bad I have found. Got halfdome backcountry permits on a walk up basis being there at 8 am."
socalhiking,26981q,tpm319,0,Fri May 23 00:07:01 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a great time!   But the thing is, I live in LA. I feel like I should be able to wake up on a Saturday and drive the 6 hours to Yosemite on a whim, expecting there to be a spot to camp without worry.   Just watched Ken Burns' ""The National Parks"" again and got me thinking the current system isn't what John Muir imagined. The restrictions are essentially making it governmental private land rather than public use. I'm all for preservation and protection and I realize allowing anyone anywhere would devastate the ecosystem, but there has to be another solution."
socalhiking,26981q,ihatefarts,0,Fri May 23 00:15:58 2014 UTC,I completely agree. Booking these permits in advance sucks. Are there really so many people that would inundate these parks if they just allowed easier walk-ups?
socalhiking,26981q,tpm319,16,Fri May 23 00:42:44 2014 UTC,"Yes. Honestly, being at halfdome now with permits is much, much nicer or anywhere else (I worked in sequoia NP for a summer).   There is no point being in the backcountry with a lot of people. The permitting system limits over use (read: abuse) of the trails and camping spots, and allows you to get into nature.   Plan ahead for your trips! or go to places that are a little off the beaten path (you might find that you enjoy it more!)"
socalhiking,26981q,rrb,2,Fri May 23 01:41:24 2014 UTC,"Yes, but what can you do? One of the nice things about being in California though is we get Yosemite to ourselves in September and October.  I have driven up on a weekend and gotten a wilderness permit no problem during those times."

socalhiking,26981q,rrb,4,Fri May 23 08:29:55 2014 UTC,"The latter.  By September most kids are back in school, so you don't have the family vacationers from all over the country coming to the park. Mostly locals and international travelers by then, and the park is relatively empty."

socalhiking,26981q,ThoughtRiot1776,2,Fri May 23 14:04:01 2014 UTC,"I guess I haven't had any problems with permits because I always go during the week. The last time I went in at The Ditch, out to Red Peak Pass and back over 5 days and the Ranger that gave us our walk up permits told us we were the first to pull permits out there in the last two weeks.     I guess the key is I don't want to see people so I don't go when hordes will be out, as a side benefit there are always permits.     Good luck! Remember it's always worth it once you're in the mountains!"
socalhiking,26981q,beefofages,2,Fri May 23 15:03:13 2014 UTC,"If you use the less crowded trailheads, day of permits should be relatively easy to get.

Then there is the Devil's Backbone, which provides the option of ascending or descending via the ski lift between 7a-sundown."

If high winds are expected, it is recommended for less experienced people to avoid the devil's backbone.  At the top of the switchbacks immediately following the boulder field, keep left at the next set of switchbacks and head toward the tree to follow the easier trail.  If you keep to the right you'll be taking the straight trail... A rather intense incline whichwas likely a wash, but has developed into an alternative route for masochists.   Otherwise, have fun"
socalhiking,2501zx,Gabrcruz,1 point,Thu May 8 04:01:17 2014 UTC,Haha I love the masochist part. I am guilty of having taken that route once by mistake the other because it was faster than the previous route
socalhiking,2501zx,AGGGman,2,Thu May 8 04:21:02 2014 UTC,Please download this map to your phone and use it for reference. The map at the base of the trail at manker flats doesn't show the route to blady village. So people who try to do devil's backbone to the ski hut trail end up getting lost.  From the summit there's a wooden post right at the start of the ski hut trail. You should be heading directly south. If you start going west you are probably going the wrong way.  http://www.simpsoncity.com/hiking/images/BaldyTopo-1510.jpg  Also someone recently put up a register up at mt hardwood. It's in a little protein container that's white. Didn't see one at west baldy or the summit though.  First time it might be easier to do the devil's backbone loop coming down ski hut trail. If your friend is a newer hiker you can cone back down devil's backbone and pay $10-12 then take the lift down.  There's actually a deal on groupon right now for a lift ticket + lunch for like $15 if you want to go that route.  Edit: If you guys are pretty fit i recommend register ridge. It's about 2.6k elevation gain in 1.5 miles but it's less traveled. The trail isn't hard to follow and you won't get a better view of the area going up.

socalhiking,24sub4,myusernameisclever,1 point,Mon May 5 22:44:09 2014 UTC,"Main thing about this area is water. If you are going for multiple days, make sure there is a water source. I believe Lodgepool springs has water, but other than that you have to hope there is snow or the lakes are full, or just choose a trail near a creek that is always running.   South Fork trail seems the easiest, but Dollar and Dry lake are both dry (hence the name I guess). So, your best bet is probably Vivian creek or falls creek, as those both have more campsites and better water options. I am actually doing Vivian Creek on May 31 to San Bernardino's Peak."

Forgot the name of the little camp about halfway to the saddle, but you cut left at the last cabin and follow it for only about a mile.  Last time I was there scoping out couloirs for [this year's awesome winter] but the boy scout troop camping there decided the best place to cook and hang their food was 20ft from my tent.  Assholes.  Please don't be an asshole.  I digress...  it's only about 2, maybe 3 miles in on a gentle slope, surrounded by high pines and sheltered from any kind of wind.  You're about a mile from the saddle, and another mile from Timber Mountain.  There's also old cabin ruins during the walk in that kids might find interesting."

socalhiking,24cqmu,sexlexia_survivor,2,Wed Apr 30 16:49:55 2014 UTC,"I've seen huts on Gorgonio but I would prefer to just tent it because their locations are at the beginning of the trail, when you are mostly likely going to camp closer to summit 7 miles in or so.   Anything else will be something you probably have to book in advance and pay for, I mean, this IS California after all...  As far as 2-4 day hikes in SoCal- Baldy/Cucamonga going through the three sisters is a good long loop, as is Gorgonio and San Bernardino peak, either via southfork or vivian creek."

socalhiking,23wai7,summiter,2,Fri Apr 25 00:36:33 2014 UTC,"Seems like a cool club but...   Strenuous (4): Any hike that is a distance of 10-14 miles or with more than 2000ft total elevation gain...   Using the modifier 'total' means cumulative and that makes most local mountain or ridge-line hikes, including a double run of Runyon Canyon in Hollywood, a strenuous hike.    Is there a group that sees the Ski Hut Trail on Baldy a 'baseline' hike?  1000ft gain for every mile (~10-11deg) is my 'baseline' incline.  Strenuous I would consider the Santa Monica Mountains Backbone Trail end-to-end (72mi) in 24hrs; or the Bear Canyon to Icehouse Canyon roundtrip in 24hrs; or the Cactus to Clouds (10,000+ft in 16mi) strenuous.  And the Cactus to Clouds to Cactus; or the Whitney Mountaineer's Route in winter in the extreme category.  Maybe /u/hikingfool and I should start something..."

The 360 view at the top was astounding.  Enjoy!"
socalhiking,23p20c,Thisthuglifeisreal,8,Tue Apr 22 17:44:57 2014 UTC,2 days on Anacapa would be overkill. It doesn't have a water source so you will have to carry it all and the island is very small. Santa rosa would be a much better option if you can get campsites.
socalhiking,23p20c,desidiver,1 point,Tue Apr 22 18:26:42 2014 UTC,"2 hours is almost overkill. I mean don't get me wrong, I definitely enjoyed it, but kayaking around the island was much more fun than the hour and half it took to hike the island."
socalhiking,23p20c,influenzaremix,3,Fri Apr 25 21:01:16 2014 UTC,"There are two campgrounds on Santa Cruz, did you check them both? Del Norte Scorpion is the popular one, but you can also hike to Scorpion Del Norte (it's a long day hike but doable). Also the south end of the island is virtually empty, you could totally camp on the beach and say fuck the system. When I was there we hiked from Scorpion to Smugglers cove, it was one of the most beautiful and serene places I'd ever been, couldn't see LA, looking the opposite direction. There were one or two small boats anchored out a mile or so, but no one came to the beach the entire night besides us. I would personally rather stay on a deserted beach than Anacapa. Anacapa is cool to see, but like desidiver says it's very small and not a whole lot going on. Especially if you have to go back to Ventura to get to it."
socalhiking,23p20c,THCarlisle,3,Tue Apr 22 19:32:41 2014 UTC,"First off, for any camping reservations, you HAVE to reserve in advance... there's no first-come-first-serve.  But Island Packers has all ready told you that.  I'm going to dispel something said below, about Santa Cruz, too.  Del Norte is the backcountry campsite, accessible most easily from Prisoner's Harbor.  Also Del Norte has NO water supply.  Scorpion campground is larger, with available water.  I would still treat this water!!  I highly, highly, recommend getting dropped off at Scorpion, kicking it for a day (GREAT kayaking and snorkeling, the harbor is almost always protected from the crazy NW winds), then backpacking over the Montanon to Del Norte.  It's a beautiful, strenuous, hike, and camping that night at Del Norte.  Again, THERE IS NO WATER.  Anacapa:  I worked for the NPS on Anacapa for a year and a half.  I'm gonna be straight with you: if you're planning on going April-June, DON'T.  It's Western Gull nesting season.  A little background here: Western Gulls (sea gulls) nest on the ground.  Thus, they have to stay away from predators.  There are two islands in Southern California small enough to have the few predators required: Anacapa and Santa Barbara.  That means that almost every gull in the WHOLE of So California comes to these two 1 sq mi hunks of rock to nest.  There are fucktons of gulls.  They are LOUD.  They are aggresive.  They WILL attack you if their young are present.  It hurts like hell.  There is also no water, and East Anacapa (the only part of Anacapa that people are allowed on) is roughly .75mi by .25mi.  It gets boring in a hurry.  The kayaking on Anacapa is phenomenal, but please be cautious of the very strong NW winds that kick up almost every afternoon.  These winds are less stong on the backside of the island."

socalhiking,23p20c,THCarlisle,1 point,Wed Apr 23 20:52:16 2014 UTC,"You might want to look into the backcountry camp sites on Santa Cruz (Del Norte campground). There are four camp sites there, and they are first come first serve (also, I think you will have to pack in your own water). It is a 3.5 mile hike from Prisoners Harbor and 12.5 miles from Scorpion Ranch (the main campground).  Usually the Island Packer's boat will drop people off at Scorpion Ranch first, then go to Prisoner's Harbor. You might be able to get on the phone with them and see if there is any way to get picked up at Scorpion Harbor and dropped at Prisoner's Harbor for two days and get the boat back from Prisoners. OR, if you are pretty adventurous you could try to get dropped at Prisoners and hike all the way back to Scorpion to catch the boat.  This would be an epic trip, but it is about 15-16 miles with no water and might be pretty rough!  Have a great trip and let us know how it goes!"

Be prepared for stiff winds,; other hikers have built rock wind shelters for tents,  but they fill up fast.

Just keep in mind that you can't camp within 200 ft of the Ski Hut.  For a more adventurous trip (Baldy is really a day hike) I would suggest leaving a car parked at Manker Flats, and then going in a separate car to Wrightwood. You can hike up Acorn Trail to Wright Mountain, then on to Pine mountain which has some rock shelters for tents. The next day, you go up Dawson and on to Baldy.  It's the most beautiful hike I've done in the San Gabs and definitely worth the extra driving. Just be sure to bring lots of water."

socalhiking,2263f6,finnbloodbath,1 point,Fri Apr 4 16:51:15 2014 UTC,In summer there is no water on the summit so you will have to carry it all but a gallon can be more than enough for one day.

San Antonio), looping back around to the car.    We are also planning Gorgonio via vivian creek, then hiking to dollar lake saddle for camp, then on to Bernandino Peak, and back using the falls creek trail.   These both need overnight permits & Adventure passes, but total cost will be $10 ($5 for each), and both are good 3 day-ers w/water sources along the way. Everytrail has some of these hiking guides, but as you can see I changed them a bit, making them much longer.   Mt. Whitney is a great day hike, campgrounds there are a bit too popular for me.

Gross, but imagine how I felt ;)  Anyway, crampons or spikes recommended just above the boulder field on the ski hut trail, and then only if you hike at night.  Footprints all the way up show that daytime temps make it easier going.  Wind not bad, maybe 15mph 500ft below summit.

As Black Jack is further out of town I think the ranger only comes by once a day to drop off the firewood & such in the lockers, especially as it's the off-season and they're super understaffed (source: hitched a ride & chatted with the lead ranger when I hiked the TCT two weeks ago)."
socalhiking,21yfvn,sgantm20,3,Tue Apr 1 20:54:51 2014 UTC,"conditions vary greatly, and I would gradually build up your snow skill levels. Going out and attacking a mountain with 4 feet of snow for a first timer...well things can get ugly quickly. Here is my winter gear list for everything but actual mountaineering climbing.   This is for an overnight on San G:  • Winter Hat  • Waterproof, breathable gloves and glove liners. (gloves will get wet, liners will help wick moisture, but while you are drying your gloves you can still keep your hands warm.  • Wool socks (2 pairs). Socks will get wet and you can switch between pairs. Also if you lose your gloves to a Yetti you can have sock mittens.  • Base Layer ( this is a synthetic, wicking fabric to keep you dry,and warm). Warm and Dry is your key to survival in the winter. I dont use cotton long johns. Stay away from cotton!  • Mid Layer (this is your main warmth layer. I usually just use my water resistant convertable hiking pants, and a light weight fleece pull over.   • Outer Layer (here in SoCal this is only really necessary if its actively snowing or you are at rest and need to keep your body temp up. This will consist of your jacket or shell, and insulated pants like snow pants. I rarely use these.  • Shell - I ALWAYS bring my rain shell with me. Its the perfect light weight vapor barrier to keep me warm and dry, and I can quickly shed it without stopping if I start sweating or get hot.   • Balaclava - not necessary in SoCal but it helps a lot. Especially if you wear glasses.  • Trekking poles with snow cups - AKA life savers  • Microspikes - I love mine. Totally useful for winter hiking. Yak Tracks work pretty great too.   • Crampons - Only if you are doing some mountaineering or high alpine work.   • Ice Axe - not really necessary unless you are doing high alpine work or mountaineering. This goes into assessing risk and planning. If its your first time you shouldnt bring an ice axe. You dont have the training or knowhow to use it when you are sliding down a mountain. AKA its dead weight unless you know how to use it.   • Snowshoes - dependant on trip, body weight, etc. Look into these. They arent necessary with under a foot of snow. Or if you plan to stay on trail. Most people will compact the snow for you already. Going off trail you would need these, and probably with tails.  • Sleeping pad - the most essential part of your sleep kit minus the bag. This is whats going to make you have a great night versus a cold as fuck waking up every 5 minutes from your teeth shivering night. Look for warmer R ratings. Lightweight is key for winter, but moreso, you want really good insulation between you and the ground.   • Sleeping bag - In SoCal I use a Kelty 20 degree synthetic down bag. It works great, but its even better in sub 20 degree temps with a bag liner. Thats all I need but I run hot.   • Food. - Your normal foodstuffs, but think about the fact that you are in very cold temps. Cliff bars and snickers get super hard and are almost inedible. Think about other nutrition that wont turn into a brick in the cold.   • Extra food- this is its own point because even if it is a beautiful winter day out, things on winter mountains can change in seconds, including weather so its best to be prepared if you have to stick out an extra night or two.   • Nalgene - boil water and put it in your nalgene a half hour before bed. Put the nalgene in your sleeping bag to warm it up before sleep. Make sure the lid isnt leaking or you will have a bad time.   • Hand Warmers  • Reflective blanket  • Rescue Whistle  • Fire starting kit, with EXTRA dry tinder and fire starter.   • Ground cover for tent (waterproof)  I could go on for a while. Let me know if you have any more questions."
socalhiking,21yfvn,brochaos,1 point,Tue Apr 1 21:36:23 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I figured I could learn how to self arrest with an ice axe on a slope before I go up one of the high alpine passes. I want to do to the High Sierra Trail to the JMT in Mid May.  I have plenty of wool socks, midweight Patagonia baselayers, MontBell UL down jacket, Patagonia pullover rain jacket (no rain pants), balaclava, Thermarest ProLite Plus (which I believe is 4 season), 20o WM Ultralight sleeping bag with a very nice sleep liner, Tyvek groundsheet and yeah I've dealt with ice cold snicker bars in Washington :("

It doesn't take much to enjoy fair-weather winter hikes down here.  I would advise against purchasing technical mountaineering equipment until you are more familiar with the scenario."

socalhiking,21x9a1,cherokeesix,3,Tue Apr 1 14:08:29 2014 UTC,"fly standby, I've done it as both a day hike and a overnight this way and always gotten a permit, as did everyone else present.   Just go to the ranger station the day before when they release the permits (11AM iirc) -- Then enjoy an afternoon by the pool at the Dow Villa or head up to the portal for a little fun hike. It does end up taking two days this way but the permit is free.   Often there are same-day permits available as well letting you get on the mountain that afternoon if you desire. Day hiking Whitney makes for a pretty long day anyway."
socalhiking,21x9a1,rocuronium,3,Tue Apr 1 14:50:51 2014 UTC,"You're options are; A) Show up to the Lone Pine ranger station and hope some people are no shows on their reservation. B) Summit via backpacking the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek (mountaineers rout). There is a lottery here but not for over night use. C) Make a multi day trip of it and start from Onion Valley where you only need a ""Exit Mt Whitney"" permit. You can hire a shuttle back to Onion Valley Road. Same goes for Cottonwood but that rout takes at least 3-4 days. Option A is more likely to work out than you might think but have a back up plan. Maybe tackle Langley, it's still a 14er and the view is just as good, with a ton less people."
socalhiking,21x9a1,tylorjams,2,Tue Apr 1 15:00:39 2014 UTC,"Unused permits are recycled on the day of, they are given out first come first serve but you have to be up at Whitney already. Also call the ranger station and keep checking the website for cancelations"
socalhiking,21x9a1,jfartzalot,2,Tue Apr 1 14:47:41 2014 UTC,"You have to reserve permits WAY in advance. I've reserved passed twice and had to cancel both times, I suspect that is common.  You could also risk going up without a permit but I don't know how tightly enforced they are."
socalhiking,21x9a1,jfartzalot,3,Tue Apr 1 14:50:06 2014 UTC,"Very tightly, you would be fined and ejected from the park. The only time I haven't been checked is coming down off the summit at dusk and walking out Whitney Portal at dawn."
socalhiking,21x9a1,tylorjams,1 point,Tue Apr 1 15:02:24 2014 UTC,"They don't, AFAIK, check permits if you're headed east on the main trail.  You can hike in from the west without a permit.  It's only if you are hiking the main trail west from whitney portal.  I ran into a few rangers each time I hiked.  Edit: Someone mentioned a exit-only permit so maybe they require that now..."
socalhiking,21x9a1,jasnooo,2,Tue Apr 1 15:26:49 2014 UTC,"That was me, they do require an exit permit and even a visitors permit if you want to summit but not use the portal at all."

You'd have to take either Sunland Blvd or La Tuna Canyon (I don't think there's anything in between the two to get across the 210.)

First two nights, no fun, folks three sites over had a generator going, someone up the hill did too, and there was a youth group somewhere as well. Sunday night? We were the only people in the whole campground. I couldn't believe it.  I have also visited while doing work fairly early in the morning on a week day in the summer, and it blows me away how few people are there. Maybe a handful."

The views you get are crazy.  I would definitely do the trail again.  One word of advice that I wish I would have gotten is to just do the road walk to Parson's Landing instead of taking the trail from Two Harbors.  It's actually pretty scenic (you get to walk around a lot of cute little private harbors and camps) and basically flat the whole way.  The trail going from the ridge line above Parson's landing into the campground was terrifyingly steep, and I would NOT want to do that again."

The Ski Hut trail is only dangerous under the bowl in the boulder field if avalanche danger is present.  The other route, via Bear Canyon, is much longer but only has one exposed ridge just before West Baldy."
socalhiking,21geuz,summiter,1 point,Wed Mar 26 22:46:51 2014 UTC,I was originally hoping to take the loop up backbone and down ski hut trail but see my edit above.

socalhiking,21geuz,summiter,1 point,Wed Mar 26 22:53:31 2014 UTC,I don't necessarily trust the rangers anymore... personal experience having them over-exaggerate conditions while under-valuing skill.  I have not been up on Baldy since that last big blizzard so I can't say what the backbone conditions are... but if there is a chance of ice (from all that freeze/thaw these past weeks) I wouldn't attempt without at least some microspikes.

socalhiking,21geuz,summiter,1 point,Wed Mar 26 22:58:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah I meant to add that I don't necessarily trust them either since they probably just want to keep myself and others away from even mildly dangerous conditions but it is currently snowing and very cold up there and looks to stay that way for the next 2 days or so. I don't have confidence in my skills in snow and ice yet so I may just pick up some snow gear and go explore somewhere closer and play around, practice self arresting and stuff if I can find some snow down here in San Diego county."

I've done the day hike up the main trail in the middle of August and I'm not a fan. It's all garbage, shit bags, and traffic jams. How is that fun? If you take 3-4 days you can approach from Cottonwood Lakes and have one of the greatest High Sierra experiences out there. If you are limited on time there are other 14ers that will give you a much more satisfying trip IMHO. There is a shuttle service available in Lone Pine (a guy with a van) and you don't need a special permit to walk out Whitney Portal or camp at one of the sites along the trail."

My recommendation to everyone I talk to about it is to take the mountaineers route (in a day or 2 or 3) it is much more pleasant and you see very few people until the summit.   I want everyone to stay on Whitney, keeps em off the more exciting fourteeners so I can enjoy myself haha."
socalhiking,21fe75,OBEYthesky,1 point,Wed Mar 26 17:24:01 2014 UTC,There is a use trail through the Miter Basin to Sky Blue Lake and Crabtree. From there you meet up with JMT and up the summit.

socalhiking,21fe75,tylorjams,1 point,Thu Mar 27 22:49:18 2014 UTC,"No, that is the much longer rout that sticks to the trail. The rout I took spent very little time on established trails. Last time I did it I actually took 4 days but it can be done in 3 with altitude acclimation and skipping Langley.   Day 1: Dropped off at Horseshoe Meadows and hiked to Cottonwood Lake Number 5 and made camp.   Day 2: Left established trail and headed up Old Army Pass. Turned North toward Langley at the NP sign boundary and dropped pack to scramble up Langley. Picked up pack and descended scree slope here and scrambled North without descending to Solder Lake. Continued North through Miter Basin to Sky Blue Lake and made camp.  Day 3: class 2 scrambling to Crabtree Pass and descended to Upper Crabtree Lake. From the West end of the lake headed at a North East angle up the scree slope to Discovery Pinnacle and down to trail junction. Summited Whitney and down to Trail Camp.  Day 4: Walked out to the Portal and in the car by 9am.  There are not a lot of write ups of this rout as it is pretty difficult but there are visible use trails so at least a few people a year are doing it. Advanced map reading and way finding skills are needed as well as ability to scramble over class 2 and 3 terrain."

socalhiking,21bzvu,HikingFool,2,Tue Mar 25 17:37:08 2014 UTC,"You would need crampons and an ice axe. It would be the normal approach to Dry Lake and then straight up one of the chutes to the summit. Same sort of conditions as Baldy Bowl, but a little bit more intense."
socalhiking,21bzvu,HikingFool,1 point,Tue Mar 25 17:46:58 2014 UTC,I feel like I know what chute you're talking about as I've gone down it once in summer. It was like skiing in scree. Unfortunately I don't have experience with either of those yet as I got no chance to practice this winter.  Hopefully we will get more snow next year and I'll be able to do both.

socalhiking,21arl5,glmory,5,Tue Mar 25 05:01:55 2014 UTC,"Flatly calling home owners in the area a NIMBY group is shit reporting. The fact is that in any national park or national forest this trail head would have been shut down years ago. I am a huge advocate for Griffith Park and a hiker so I generally fall on the side of fair access to all parks but this trail basically adds up to being a shortcut for people who are too lazy to access the sign from one of the other several public trailheads that don't require parking on a private street. The bottom line is enough of the visitors to the area are abusive that it became unsustainable years ago. I'm not a resident but in a small hand full of walks through the area I have seen tour vans and private cars lined up blocking the street as well as cars parked blocking driveways and generally driving unsafely up and down Beachwood. This is all not to mention the garbage that piles up. Unlike Bronson, Mt Hollywood, and Vista Del Ville, Beachwood does not have public facilities beyond a dirt lot that holds about 6-10 cars. There is a similar problem near Hollywood Reservoir where tour vans pile up on residential streets trying to view the sign from above the local park and Mt. Lee Dr was closed a long time ago for this reason.  The bottom line comes down to abuse. When an area of a park is being abused beyond control that area gets closed. Try to imagine if this was your street, these people have mostly lived in the area since before this was an issue (it's exploded with the intro of smart phones) and people treat residence like they moved next to an airport and complained about the noise. The Beachwood Trailhead should absolutely be closed.   If people want to access the sign they should use Bronson Canyon, Wonder View, Mt Hollywood Dr, or Vermont Canyon. There are several other ways to get there but these are have publicly owned and maintained parking lots and roads with bathrooms and trashcans. Respect the park, respect its neighbors, and remember it's just a bunch of letters on a hill."

Baldy is pretty clear all the way to the top but you should at least have trekking poles and warm clothing otherwise wait a month or two or hit one of the smaller summits in the Angeles NF.

socalhiking,20qx8d,tylorjams,1 point,Tue Mar 18 21:23:20 2014 UTC,"From what I understand you can expect the Sierras to be pretty unpredictable right now. Normally late March would be no go for most of the range but this year is different. 3 weeks ago you could summit Whitney without ever touching snow but right now you would need show shoes just to get to trail camp. Some areas might be open to you but then again they might not depending on what happens. Keeping this in mind I would recommend slightly extending your drive and heading over to the Grand Canyon and doing the Tanner-Escalante Loop which takes about 5 days (40 miles) and combines the Tanner and Escalante trails. Or maybe Zion which is more like 6.5 hours from SD. If you absolutely need to keep it under 6 hours there is also White Mountain and the Bristle Cone Pine Forrest, Death Valley and Joshua Tree. But don't forget, you have one of the most beautiful desert parks in the country in your back yard; Anza-Borrego."

socalhiking,20qx8d,tylorjams,1 point,Tue Mar 18 21:01:33 2014 UTC,Langley would be very sketchy in late March for someone who isn't comfortable using crampons solo.
socalhiking,20qx8d,HikingFool,0,Wed Mar 19 00:13:48 2014 UTC,Check out the Joshua tree riding and hiking trail. 38 miles over however long it takes you with many day hikes to do if you finish fast. I did it in November and it was superb if you like desert. I recommend starting in black rock and finishing at the north entrance. I can give info on caching water and tips from my trip if you are interested.
socalhiking,20r2mg,tofucabin,2,Tue Mar 18 21:13:58 2014 UTC,Lake Isabella is 2.5 -3 hours away but should be worth the extra bit of a drive. Ive never been there personally but have friends who love the place. Good luck.

socalhiking,20myv4,HikingFool,1 point,Mon Mar 17 18:27:53 2014 UTC,Mt Lowe Trail Camp. It was nice!
socalhiking,20myv4,HikingFool,2,Mon Mar 17 19:35:59 2014 UTC,For sure it is. I met the local legend mountain man while camping there in December I believe. He said he chased off a bear early morning but I didn't get to see it :/ I'm sure to be back soon.

It was pretty icy so eventually we stopped because we didn't have spikes. (edit to say: There wasn't a lot of snow when we were hiking in the afternoon, just enough for it to be really pretty but as the trail got higher it would have been more dangerous without proper gear. I wouldn't want to camp in it because I'm a wuss when it comes to cold, but I bet at Stone Creek or anywhere lower like that it's fine. However, I don't know what campgrounds are officially open, another thing to ask the folks at the station. On our short afternoon hike we did meet a ranger on the trail.) I may be hiking over there this week so I will report back if I do. Call the Idyllwild ranger's office, they're really nice! :) Happy camping, it's so gorgeous there!

socalhiking,20n96d,lydiacostume,1 point,Mon Mar 17 18:33:00 2014 UTC,It's been real warm lately and I doubt there's snow where you're staying. I lived in Idyllwild for a few years and this year has been super warm and in normal years there isn't much snow anyway.  I am jealous I miss it there and will be doing the peak from marion ridge but life is in the way right now and I have 3 more hikes to do before Jacinto

socalhiking,20ltai,grammacrobat,1 point,Mon Mar 17 05:12:17 2014 UTC,Ruins are intact. The debris is mostly broken off trees. The fallen ones have moved a bit and covered us some of the trail but nothing significant. The most important this is recognizing where the washout took out the trail. I will go back next weekend and try to do some repair.

Each group spot is mostly isolated so you don't have to worry about bothering neighbors. Huge trees all around you, great view especially at night, big rocks to climb and hike around. In the midst of LA it really feels like true camping."
socalhiking,20l539,kk3,2,Mon Mar 17 01:38:36 2014 UTC,whatchu lookin for? beach camping near that san onofre thing off 5. never stayed there.  2 harbors is nice. they have some amenities there food and booze.  dayhike out to that point on the end forgot the name starlight beach i think?  or to the airport for some buffalo burger  cleaveland nf backpack in off 74. agua tibia pack in. nice but dry  san gorgonio wilderness car camp in a bunch of spots along 38 or hike in. a bunch of cabin things.

I played around with Mexico a bit but it seemed like too much of a hassle for this group.  Thanks for the info on 2 harbors, I was also attracted because Avalon is there and one of my favorite authors, Zane Grey always wrote about it...it also has some nightlife.  I know the site you're talking about at Cleveland but this is not the group for that, the old routine was that, as the experienced hiker, I supplied the camping gear and they joined along as buddies and as belay bitches.  I haven't been to San Gorgonio but that has some merit, I will look into that and thanks for the suggestion."
socalhiking,20l539,Status_Faction,2,Mon Mar 17 00:41:54 2014 UTC,Keep in mind that San Gorgonio has very active black bears that are habituated to humans. They're not dangerous but they'll steal your food if they get a chance.
socalhiking,20l539,beefofages,1 point,Mon Mar 17 00:44:16 2014 UTC,Do they allow bear bags or do I need canisters?

It's a short walk to the campsites from the dock in Catalina. There's awesome beach front camping. Fun hikes, swimming, fishing, boat and kayak rentals, snorkels. Even a general store close enough to walk too. Also beach volleyball courts. It's super fun and easy to arrange. Fire pits and wood available for purchase. Lots of cool animals too. I had a blast!"

I was in there in December and the river was dry save for a few stagnant pools. I'd hope the rains recently brought some water.
socalhiking,20d5in,JayOtheMountains,2,Fri Mar 14 01:31:39 2014 UTC,Awesome!!! We would love to still do that trail but I don't know the other trail heads. If you have a moment I'd love to find out. Thanks so much!
socalhiking,20d5in,matt4500,1 point,Fri Mar 14 03:52:31 2014 UTC,You can get to it from the Piedras Blancas TH and the Dough Flat TH. I'm assuming Mutau Flat is the closed one? Piedras blancas is a little long but its flat. Dough flat is pretty rough from what I've heard. Some links: http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm9_034033.pdf  (Describes the other trailheads) http://www.scaruffi.com/travel/sespe.html
socalhiking,20d5in,vocherro,1 point,Fri Mar 14 12:18:16 2014 UTC,I had the same issue this week so we ended up doing the Reyes Creek Trail down to  Beartrap Campground. You can get to the trailhead from I-5 if you exit Frazier mtn to Lockwood Valley. There's no hot springs but it's still a cool spot.
socalhiking,20a19c,Webbtastic,3,Thu Mar 13 00:28:42 2014 UTC,"You or the ranger must be mixing places, It isn't bear creek. It is called Bear Canyon, and Bear Canyon Trail Camp. The first camp, before you start climbing out of the canyon is hit or miss. I wouldnt camp there. Bear Canyon Trail Camp, is however, open. The trail is a bit tricky to get there, over grown, lots of debris and fallen trees but it is indeed accessible with effort. This camp is outside the Forest Service designated way points creating the no-go zone from the station fire. The Upper Arroyo Seco trail is still closed.   This being said, this place has seen huge amounts of traffic as of lately and they might just want it to cool down a bit due to people trashing the place.  Now, with that said, I highly reccommend a few other places. Kelly Camp at the top of ice house is amazing, but you may still require snow gear to get up there as its on the North side of the mountain and residual snow is still up there.  Another option is Little Jimmy Camp via Islip Saddle. Its amazing, but there is snow there currently. Finally you can also try starting at Cobb Estate in Pasadena and climb up to the Mt. Lowe trail camp. Its a great little site thats free from people and has horse amenities, and a latrine. Check em all out!  Edit: There is a bear creek, from Highway 39 I believe and that one is pretty much closed. Its via Smith Mountain Trail. Its one of the most remote, over grown, densely forested, middle of nowhere scramble hikes I have done, and is also one of the furthest points from any road in the forest."
socalhiking,20a19c,sgantm20,1 point,Thu Mar 13 20:55:01 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Yea, I told him Bear Creek, I think. I will call tomorrow about Bear Canyon Trail Camp. I am seriously looking at Mt. Lowe right now."
socalhiking,20a19c,sgantm20,1 point,Fri Mar 14 03:56:41 2014 UTC,"Mt. Lowe is really dope. On top of just going straight to the trail camp, you should do the whole loop. Start off by climbing up to historic echo mountain where you will find ruins from socals golden age of hiking. The White City is up there, along with ruins from the old incline railway. From their, follow the Western path up the old railway. Along this trail you will follow the exact path the old train took, walking along old rail ties, and some great history. There are some plaques around too. Part of this hike will take you along a winding road up to the trail camp but its a nice easy grade. The North side will be a bit colder than the exposed South side. I would recommend you continue your hike up to Inspiration point after you set up camp for a stunning night time view from the vista."

socalhiking,209hy4,sgantm20,3,Wed Mar 12 21:20:51 2014 UTC,I would recommend starting at Chantry Flats and then have someone pick you up and take you from JPL to Chantry. The trail this way has an easier elevation gain as well. Its a great backpacking trip! Also you can pick up some beers and stuff at adams pack station before you head out and trash it at the bottom of the hill which has maintained trash service.
socalhiking,209hy4,loofa,3,Thu Mar 13 20:59:07 2014 UTC,I'm interested in doing this as well. From what I've heard though the stretch from Switzer to JPL is still somewhat sketchy from the Station Fire.
socalhiking,209hy4,MoreMajorSins,2,Sun Mar 16 17:06:50 2014 UTC,I recently hiked from JPL to Paul Little picnic area and the trail was very overgrown and almost nonexistent after that. I didn't try to go farther but it looked like it would be tough.
socalhiking,209hy4,HikingFool,1 point,Mon Mar 24 08:00:09 2014 UTC,So I traveled the section between valley forge camp and Newcombe pass this past Sunday and the ground was just soft and moist from the recent rains. The poison oak has begun to sprout and spread so make sure to have long pants and sleeves. The poodle dog was also as lush as I've seen but that doesn't block the trail the same way the poison oak does above Devore campground.  Please share your stats and info after you finish as the whole trail is certainly on my list of things to do.

Saw a baby rattler on the trail too. Do not get caught in the heat. Start early. Saw too many people coming up at 2 asking how far am I. I said you're 3 miles away and a lot of elevation gain.

socalhiking,206ef9,tylorjams,4,Tue Mar 11 22:38:40 2014 UTC,Awesome. It was awesome. I went straight up the bowl; there was JUST enough snow for the crampons to bite without hitting rock. Ended up shepherding two hikers down who climbed the Backbone and got stuck below Manker Flats because they didn't know there would be snow.   How was Waterman? I love that mountain.
socalhiking,206ef9,tylorjams,4,Tue Mar 11 22:44:48 2014 UTC,"I'm really surprised that mountain doesn't claim more people considering how dangerous/accessible it is. Devil's Backbone is sketchy in the snow to say the least.   Waterman was beautiful but the snow was really slushy and sloppy, pretty hard to walk on. It was totally melted on all but the shaded north faces up to 8000 ft. Hard to believe that much snow melted that quickly. The creeks are running good because of it though which is nice. Baldy looked incredible from the top."

socalhiking,2076z7,scottawr,2,Wed Mar 12 05:33:03 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Snow coverage isn't too bad. We went up Saturday and there was probably 3-4"" going up to Round Valley. Most of the snow on the trail was packed down so you could hike with just boots or microspikes. We stayed till Monday and the snow was melting quickly. Probably 2"" left in areas not exposed to the sun. Other than than I don't think there will be much snow left in the coming weeks."

socalhiking,1zp6lt,grammacrobat,2,Sat Mar 8 14:42:23 2014 UTC,"A lot of the mountains like Baldy and Baden- Powell got almost no snow due to unusually high temps. I think baldy got under 6 inches which will most likely melt by this weekend. Which sucks because I finally thought I could crampon up baldy this year but I'll probably have to wait till next winter. :(  HOWEVER, the Big Bear range got a good dumping of snow, so Taquitz should have snow. :) good luck!"

socalhiking,1z71g8,star_pilot,3,Fri Feb 28 17:53:17 2014 UTC,Be extremely careful going around the south side of Mt. Harwood towards the Backbone - especially in fresh and unconsolidated snow. I did that right after a storm last year and it was the most terrifying experience I've ever had in the mountains. The snow basically just gives out under your feet and it's very exposed and a long way down. Here's a photo of what I'm talking about: http://i.imgur.com/94yZ4.jpg  You could also consider taking the Ski Hut trail both ways! Sounds like a fun trip either way. Have fun!  Edit: Also - if you don't have any ice axe/self arrest/crampon experience I'd suggest you stay away from the Bowl. Just saw that you mentioned that.

There's some parking in the shoulder and you'll probably see a bunch of other riders on a weekend. There is a trail here that leads to a main paved (non-motorized) road. A couple miles down it turns to dirt - you can take it all the way down to the beach if you want to, but I rarely ever do. All the mountain bike legal trails are to the right off of various fire road branches as you descend. I recommend riding Sage, Sin Nombre and Guadalasca. It's always a grind for me getting back up the hill after doing a big loop so keep that in mind.  It gets hot in the summer so bring lots of water. I ride everything on my hard tail - nothing is super technical for a intermediate rider. Always a good idea to ride with a friend and keep an eye out for equestrians. It's a popular area for them."

The upper Sisquoc (above South Fork) has been worked recently, thanks to volunteers from the LPFA, and is in a much better shape then the lower half. Hurricane Deck has some excellent views but it's no joke either. No water and very brushy. All in an it's an awesome area that doesn't see a lot of traffic.  Just one quick word: you can't start at Alama; the Buckhorn road is closed to vehicle traffic. You could make a loop starting at Nira Campground, or you could hoof it in to Alamar along the Buckhorn, from either the north (Santa Barbara Canyon) or the south (Upper Oso Campground) but it's a long trek.  My best advice is to check out the forums on sbhikes.com. You'll find pictures and plenty of the info you're looking for. Good Luck!"

socalhiking,1xz20i,ballison,1 point,Sun Feb 16 22:20:46 2014 UTC,It comes from the snow/rain that falls on baldy and some of the surrounding peaks. There are tons of streams that flow into the river so it has water all year round. The current water level was about the same as July/august last year it might get pretty low by the time summer gets here.

socalhiking,1xu25r,Status_Faction,2,Fri Feb 14 01:33:19 2014 UTC,That's not always normal. The higher the loft (750 down vs 800 vs 850 etc) the less it will lose feathers. That's definitely a symptom of inexpensive down gear.
socalhiking,1xu25r,socalktk,1 point,Fri Feb 14 05:58:00 2014 UTC,"It's also a function of the fabric.  Fabric that isn't calendared or waxed will have lots of any type of down flowing through it.

socalhiking,1xl8tl,daemionx,1 point,Tue Feb 11 07:06:03 2014 UTC,"you'll need a permit and they're a huge pain in the ass to get: the office is closed half the week, you have to apply in advance, and you MUST apply by mail or fax (no phone calls, no websites, no emails).  I wanted to backpack gorgonio but was dissuaded by the difficult process.  If you're looking to go before next week and don't have a permit you might be out of luck."

socalhiking,1xl8tl,WikipediaHasAnswers,4,Tue Feb 11 21:43:01 2014 UTC,"They don't mess around in Gorgonio. The rangers are like ninjas, they pop out of the brush and demand to see your permit, then write you up if you haven't got one. Some buddies of mine got written up in the Vivian Creek parking lot for having a celebratory beer after a peak bagging trip, the ranger forced them to pour them out on the pavement then issued everyone who was drinking $75 citations."
socalhiking,1xhwl1,star_pilot,3,Mon Feb 10 05:25:00 2014 UTC,"Mineral King would be my choice. It's lower in elevation so it might be more accessible and the first camp is 4 or 5 miles out. When I've gone I've left from work in Orange County and hiked to the first camp at night. It's not far at all. If you dont have one, pickup a map. Be careful on the road to the trailhead, it's a very windy two-way road and very narrow in certain spots. I once got caught in a snow storm on the way out and was very fortunate to have been in a friends 4x4 and just happened to get behind a snow plow on his way out. Otherwise we definitely would have been forced to wait it out."
socalhiking,1xhwl1,knucklehed,2,Mon Feb 10 17:26:30 2014 UTC,Mineral King road closed currently :(
socalhiking,1xhwl1,los_angeles,2,Mon Feb 10 20:29:46 2014 UTC,"You might check out Forest Rte 22S82. Some good car camping but you need 4x4. Honestly though, go to yosemite. take off early friday and call in sick monday.  You will have typically crowded areas to yourself. Little Yosemite Valley is cold but deserted right now, for example."
socalhiking,1xhwl1,tylorjams,2,Mon Feb 10 18:08:11 2014 UTC,"I recommend the High Sierra Trail. It starts in Crescent Meadow in SNF so there are no hairy roads to negotiate which I really don't recommend in the winter, weather should be mild but never count on that in the Sierras. The HST is gorgeous and the elevation stays pretty low until you get to Bearpaw Camp. From there you can camp and asses the conditions for further hiking up to Kaweah Gap and Hamilton Lake, which I personally think is one of the finest views in the area. Just make sure to bring some kind of crampons, that is going to much, much more important than snow shoes. We are seeing Oct/Nov conditions in the Sierras right now which means lots of ice and almost no snow due to relatively warm days and freezing nights. I hate to see this lack of snow but it gives you a unique opportunity to see an incredible trail sans people, it can get pretty swamped in the summer."
socalhiking,1xhwl1,tylorjams,1 point,Mon Feb 10 18:54:05 2014 UTC,Dang I don't have crampons. Do you think microspikes are ok for this?
socalhiking,1xhwl1,tylorjams,2,Mon Feb 10 19:17:07 2014 UTC,I would actually recommend mirospikes and carbide tip trekking poles over real crampons since what you will be dealing with is thin sheets of ice over granite rather than walking over solid ice fields. You will also be covering a lot of ground that is snow and ice free so you'll want something you can take on and off easily.
socalhiking,1xhwl1,tylorjams,1 point,Mon Feb 10 19:22:17 2014 UTC,Road to Crescent Meadow currently closed. What about starting from Wolverton?
socalhiking,1xhwl1,tylorjams,1 point,Mon Feb 10 20:31:45 2014 UTC,I know the parking lots around General Sherman are open. You can navigate to Crescent Meadow from there. Alta trail also hooks up with High Sierra. There is a connector at Panther Gap. But if you go that way you might as well just head to Alta or Pear Lake and maybe summit Alta Peak.

socalhiking,1xaau2,bonkers555,2,Sat Feb 8 00:00:15 2014 UTC,"Sure. The trailhead is up the Angeles Crest Highway about 20 miles, just before Newcomb's Ranch. It's a short hike down the canyon, about three miles, to the campsite in the photo, which is right next to a reliable river. From there you can go south along a pack trail by the river to some pretty cool waterfalls. It was a nice little overnight getaway.  I didn't see a soul, but there were shotgun shells and random trash around the campsite and parts of the pack trail."

Well this time wear synthetics or wool, and possibly a weather resistant shell.  That's basically the only change until winter is actually upon us"
socalhiking,1xb8s5,summiter,1 point,Sat Feb 8 00:10:12 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I figured I wouldn't need anything different but I've really only hiked in dry weather"
socalhiking,1xb8s5,desidiver,2,Sat Feb 8 00:33:32 2014 UTC,"seems like this weekend there isn't snow in the forecast but i would keep eye on the weather, its very easy to get lost in whiteout conditions.   in terms of gear i would carry a wind resistant shell and a light down jacket to be prepared for the cold. extra pair of socks would be a good idea if it rains and they get wet. same with gloves, if the temperature drops then they come in really handy.   it doesn't hurt to be prepared for the worst specially if you are planning to hike something like baldy."
socalhiking,1xb8s5,sgantm20,2,Sat Feb 8 00:55:47 2014 UTC,"Rule number ONE in wet/snowy/cold conditions is to wear synthetic fabrics like wool. If you get wet, you will still stay warm vs. cotton. Number two is the conditions are normally much more harsh. Plan accordingly. Bring an extra day of food, extra water, etc. Always a good plan to bring an extra pair of socks, something to sit on/ a sleeping pad for ground insulation.   Winter conditions compound problems so staying warm, dry and comfortable is always priority number one. Sweating a lot? Slow down, and lose a layer. Standing around taking a break? Layer up!   Layers are key. You should wear a synthetic base layer, a light mid layer and your waterproof shell. In the winter, its essential to keep your skin covered if things go wrong because if you end up staying the night...youre gonna get frost bite if you arent covered.   Seriously plan for the worst. Also, in cold conditions normal trail foods like snickers and granola bars tend to freeze and get really hard. There goes your nutrition because you cant eat it since its solid. Think about softer foods and what you can bring to keep you energized.   if you have a camel pak, always blow the water back into your hydration bladder to get the water out of the tube. You dont want your water freezing in the tube because then you cant drink.  You will also be at altitude in the winter. You may not want to drink water because you feel fine, but that couple (altitude and winter) means you will dehydrate far faster than normal.   Stay safe and have a blast!!!"

But you won't ask to pass them, because then they'll feel like they're doing you a favor. Why do they owe you more than you owe them, just because you think you've been hiking longer than they have?  If you're sick of having to ask to pass people, I get it. But you make it sound like you don't ask very much. The bottom line is, the trails are open to everyone.  I just can't relate to your attitude about this. ""We"" aren't going to post a sign at the trailhead explaining the ""rules"" because ""we"" aren't as invested in this as you are.  These people you're talking about are out there hiking on the same trails you are, and they're doing the same thing you are. Their ""obligation"" to you must have never occurred to them. You can either ask to pass, so that they know someone wants to pass, or you can fume about it to yourself because you've been doing this longer than they have (and then choose to run through poison oak rather than say something to someone)."
socalhiking,1wwmi5,ScrewDislocations,-6,Mon Feb 3 18:01:00 2014 UTC,"Fair enough, you're entitled to whatever opinion about me you may have developed here, but the purpose of this discussion was to try to find a way to make things better for everyone (with me included).  I did this by appealing to people's sense of common courtesy (not the specific conventions of trail etiquette), which I believe should be sufficient.  That being said, I think this subreddit is also in desperate need of a trail etiquette PSA."
socalhiking,1wwmi5,ScrewDislocations,5,Mon Feb 3 18:36:36 2014 UTC,"Look, I take this personally because I've only been hiking for a year or two. And I may never bother you on the trail, and we will probably never run into each other. But what bothers me is the way you're treating hiking here as something exclusive.   You could be a very nice person, but you're talking about hiking as something you're an expert on. And you may be! You could have been hiking for 30 years, for all I know. But that doesn't entitle you to decide what everyone else is doing wrong, and it puts an unfriendly pall onto hiking, which is, by nature, a pretty welcoming activity.  If you want to make things better for everyone, be willing to talk about making things better for everyone, instead of complaining about newbies and casual hikers. They should be included in ""everyone."" If you want things to be better for everyone, maybe you owe it to them to be polite and to not worry that they might think they're doing you a favor if they let you pass. No one is forcing you to run through poison ivy. Just ask. We can all do our part."

socalhiking,1wpkxs,daemionx,4,Sat Feb 1 06:00:28 2014 UTC,if you don't get the happy isles permit try for tuolomne or other trailheads that connect to the JMT so you can avoid the valley tourist masses.

Show up about 30-50 minutes before the ranger office opens and you'll be able to walk right in and snag a permit.  I was a little late so they were going to re-route us but someone next to us wanted to start at our new trailhead so they actually just put us back at Happy Isles and made an exception, really cool people there.

I was checking the area out for potential overnight spots there are plenty of spots to camp but the lack of water was disappointing.   Bikes are not allowed in the San Mateo canyon wilderness.

socalhiking,1wl8t4,Gabrcruz,6,Fri Jan 31 23:57:04 2014 UTC,"Update: It was an amazing hike. We went past the ski hut to the peak, then down the backbone to the ski lodge. Took the chair lift down.   There were random patches of ice/snow on the way up, but not a lot (only in the places that never get direct sunlight) There were a few near slips, but we took it easy and made it up quickly without incident (we were in regular boots/trail shoes. no spikes or poles).  It was windy at the peak and along the backbone, but not enough to turn back (we had a first time hiker with us and she did just fine) It was actually a lot of fun with the wind.   Had a few flurries at the ski lodge and some fog/dark clouds that looked scary, but had no bite.  All and all a beautiful hike get up there if you can. My first time up Baldy. It's a winter wonderland!  thanks for the helpful info people!"

socalhiking,1wl8t4,Fargone,5,Fri Jan 31 10:21:40 2014 UTC,Seeing as it's been raining today I'm sure there will be snow/ice on the backbone summit and several other places. Make sure to check the wind though. I had to turn back the last time I hiked baldy as there were 40-50 mph winds with gusts of 70mph. Went up register ridge so we were protected till we rejoined the backbone trail. Got to the final uphill section and the gusts were pushing me backwards. Never any shame in turning around if the conditions warrant it. The mountain will still be there.
socalhiking,1wku52,WeevilsWobble,3,Thu Jan 30 19:09:54 2014 UTC,Dispersed camping is not allowed on the backbone trail and there are only 2 camps near the trail. Logistics are the hardest part of the trail.
socalhiking,1wku52,scottawr,3,Fri Jan 31 01:46:35 2014 UTC,"yes.  72 miles in 24 hours.  no sleep, just walking and some slight jogging down inclines.  The no-camping policy was annoying because I planned to just sleep under the stars with a light blanket but it actually turned out better.  Very few water sources but I did it with only a 3L camelbak and over-hydrating in the car up to the trailhead.  Bring a good light and detailed topo map because there are numerous offshoots and you don't want to get lost."

socalhiking,1whmqd,naotalba,8,Wed Jan 29 19:42:18 2014 UTC,"A few years back I did Trans-Catalina from 2 Harbors to Avalon.  This is what I recommend:   If you start at 2 Harbors you have the luxury of enjoying a beer and good food at Avalon upon your return.  I don't think/know if 2 Harbors has the same luxuries.   I went close to Summer and it was very warm during the day.  We stayed in the Black Jack campground over night.  We thought we could just bring sleeping bags and sleep under the stars.  We were wrong!  Luckily their is a service there that will place a tent, firewood, and camping stove at the campground for you by reservation.  When we arrived someone had left a tent their and we squeezed three men into it.  In short - bring a tent  or reserve one ahead of time.  Too cold to camp under the start.  BTW - Black Jack was a beautiful spot at night.  High up on the mountain and very secluded.   Wild Buffalo.  We passed one sitting just off the trail with no obstacles for a long distance between us and him.  They are VERY intimidating looking.  Think ""Where the Wild Things Are"" type beast.  We passed him with no incident.   From 2 Harbors you are going to go up and down a lot.  It is tough but if you are in good shape it won't be too touch.  We were able to fill up water at Little Harbor campground and again at Black Jack.  Bring enough to go 7-10 miles with no refill.   Here is a good map [https://www.catalinaconservancy.org/userfiles/files/maps/TCT.pdf] Most of the trail is marked well, parts are not.  Bring a good trail map, compass, and sense of direction.  After Little Harbor we did not pass another human being the entire trip back to Avalon.  Near roads we saw some cars and busses but there were long stretches with no people at all.  All in all it is a relatively small Island and you can't get too lost.   Problem - The ferries only stop at Avalon and 2 Harbors, which means that if you want to do the West End part of the Island it adds about 15 miles (out and back) to your trip.  Just going from 2 Harbors to Avalon took 2 full days for us guys in pretty good shape moving at a steady clip.  Also, the topography is pretty uniform throughout the Island and spending two nights may be overkill.  However, I was there when it was very dry.  It may be much more beautiful and lush this time of year.     Enjoy and update us with pics and a report!"

socalhiking,1whmqd,jfartzalot,3,Wed Jan 29 22:07:51 2014 UTC,"Well, in that case:  I recommend taking the ferry to 2 Harbors and hiking up the mountain to a beautiful ocean vista (mile markers 26 - just past 23) on the map listed above.  There are less ferry pick-ups from 2 Harbors but if you time it right it shouldn't be a problem. Similarly there are a number of hikes around Avalon and more flexible ferry times from there."
socalhiking,1whmqd,theryanmoore,1 point,Wed Jan 29 22:16:30 2014 UTC,Is there anywhere on the island to camp for free? Stealth camp? I got no money but I can be sneaky.
socalhiking,1whmqd,jfartzalot,1 point,Thu Jan 30 01:37:48 2014 UTC,"I imagine that there aren't many people camping there now. You could probability stay in one of the more remote spots but if a ranger shows they will probably ticket you. When I was there no one else was staying in the site and no rangers came by.  You can also find an out of the way location on the trail but there are probably steep fines for getting caught, especially if you have a fire. You also run the risk of having to leave in the middle of the night. The fees aren't that high and they probably go into maintaining the sites so it is work paying for a spot."

It just rattled our teeth a bit.  We camped right by the mouth of the canyon and didn't have any problems with our car being broken into or anything.  Last I heard, it was around last May when there were issues.  The hike itself is pretty fantastic.  Lot's of fun.  Just be aware of the weather.  You don't want to be out there in the rain.

That's not my team's primary area, but we get called in there for searches that go more than several hours.  I have been back there 3 or 4 times on searches alone (several more recreationally).  If you know how to nav by compass, you are probably fine, and it's passable, it's just that there are a lot of forking and merging, and somewhat overgrown use trails rather than a well developed and signed trail.  Watch out for poodle dog bush.  Just make sure someone knows your route and when you are supposed to exit.  Edit:  as of right now the city of Sierra Madre has it's ANF access points closed, so you might end up having to cancel.  Also, when I say passable above, I mean, you can get through...  it may not be easy or pleasant."

It's a lot of fun, and only about $80 for a jump. The hike will  take a few hours though, so start early, bring lots of water and snacks (especially in summer). The last few miles are uphill and exposed."

I would recommend Holy Jim Trail and if your kid can do that one without any problems, then you can try Whiting Ranch.  Also, there are many mountain bikers, so it is important to make sure that they are close to you and understand to move to the side quickly."

It's not stable, and every trip up there on foot causes more erosion.  I am on one of the local mountain rescue teams, and we only use that trail to get above people who got stuck on a cliff in eaton canyon.  It really should be used minimally.  A lot of the trails you will find that aren't on a map are like that...  they are there, but the forest service doesn't want anyone to use them.  The altadena crest trail is newer than most maps of the area, so you will probably not see it on anything for a while.

Should I abandon this plan and just drive to the Sierra anyway - I'm only concerned with high elevation because my nephew has mild asthma.
socalhiking,1unccx,autowikibot,2,Wed Jan 8 20:02:30 2014 UTC,"IMO, Sierra is going to be best. You don't have to go really far north, however. On the south slopes are some good loops in the Golden Trout Wilderness, either the west part with loops through Mtn Home St Forest, or in the east side along the Kern.  If you want to try to incorporate an exhilarating peak (not sure with the asthma), I have two suggestions. From Wolverton in Sequoia, use the Alta Trail to hit Alta Peak (11k) then circle out on the High Sierra Trail and back through the Giant Forest. Or bag a 14er by going up Cottonwood Creek on the east side to try Mt Langley. This also has the advantage that the road goes up to 10k, so you might be able to camp at the trailhead for a night to acclimatize."

socalhiking,1u8s5t,phish92129,5,Thu Jan 2 23:31:47 2014 UTC,"I went to Desert View Tower a few weeks ago. Prior to talking with the proprietor, I only ever knew about the route coming over the mountain (which is not clearly marked and is a lot of scrambling/bouldering). He told me to walk north from the DeAnza Springs (clothing optional) Resort. We did so, it was 7.3 miles each way with only about 750 feet of elevation change. Pretty easy walking, albeit long.  That said, it is technically trespassing. I have heard that the new railway owner doesn't have money to pay rail bulls (police) so we chanced it and didn't see any.  When we got to the trestle, we met folks that came over the mountain, folks that walked down from Dos Cabeza, and 6-8 people on mountain bikes. I think my group was the only ones to come from the south.  Being close to the DeAnza resort is probably good, the other two routes ask you to leave your vehicle in the middle of the desert. At least DeAnza has some (naked) traffic moving about."

socalhiking,1u6yvs,TurkeyChilum,3,Thu Jan 2 00:45:29 2014 UTC,I have hiked the Matilija River which is very nice but it's my understanding that a private land owner is blocking public access to that whole area. As far as I know the only practical entrance is through his land just beyond the Matilija Dam.  If this is no longer the case that's great news but I would check with the rangers if you're not sure. I've done Sespe instead a few times but I found that hike unremarkable and car break-ins too numerous at the TH and stopped going there as well.
socalhiking,1u6yvs,tylorjams,1 point,Thu Jan 2 04:17:30 2014 UTC,the Sespe river to the hot springs hike interests me but every time I see pictures it seems like boring scenery. Am I missing out on something?

The Willet Hot Spring is nice and the hike itself is not very difficult. The Sespe Gorge is nice and all but I'm a mountain man, and I like my pine trees.   I went there a couple months ago because the weather got real crumby in the San Gabriels so my friend and I drove down to Sespe where it was warm and clear."
socalhiking,1u6yvs,tylorjams,3,Thu Jan 2 05:42:43 2014 UTC,"That hike has it's moments but I only really enjoyed it once in late spring of a wet year when it was very green and the River had a good flow. If you go now it will be brown and the River will be very dry and scummy. Matilija is more lush and riparian but is also not very exiting. If you go anywhere up there expect really bad water flow, hot days and cold nights probably in the low 30s. No bears but there are raccoons a plenty which have no issues tearing through packs. There is probably a serious fire ban as well. Not to sound like a downer. Sespe is worth it in like April/May when there's been a lot of rain."

If you're a fan of scrub it's fun, but at parts of it there isn't a lot of shade. I could see how someone who prefers foresty areas to not like this hike.

Call the ranger station to double check the time they release them - I think they've moved it back a bit. Works best if there is only 1 or you. I have lots of friends who do this."

socalhiking,1tiqgw,HikingFool,2,Mon Dec 23 21:38:10 2013 UTC,I like camp Lowe in the San Gabriel's or idle hour camp from the Cobb estate at the north end of lake. Or chantry flat has several including a few secluded camps on the west fork of the San Gabriel river over Newcombe pass. There are at least 5 camps you can stay in from chantry. I also do one nighters at henninger flats usually with my hammock but it's too cold for that now. I'd use a tent till spring. It's nice cause it's easy to get to and has awesome views as well as lights flush toilets running water and a nearby ranger station/museum

However when we camp out at Little Harbor, we will hike up the TransCatalina ""hiking only"" sections. Breath taking views!   My goal this year is to make it all the way to Eagle Rock. If you can, try to stop by the airport in the sky for a bison burger and beer. Usually herds of bison grazing nearby for your viewing pleasure."

You're going to have a hard time finding a spot to hang the first 700 miles, once you reach the Sierra you won't have much problems, but you will have to stay below tree line obviously. Either way, it's going to be a bit of a chore and you will have to compromise.  Just about everyone that's thru-hiking cowboy camps, after a long day of hiking the last thing you want to do is set up a tent or hammock or w/e. You just want to roll out your tyvek, thermarest zlite, sleeping bag and just go to sleep asap."
socalhiking,1tczcz,Shark_With_Lasers,3,Fri Dec 20 23:34:29 2013 UTC,"I don't live in LA (SD!), and I haven't hiked Half Dome (but have done Yosemite at ~10k, Tuolumne to May Lake), so take with a grain of salt.  Some opinions based on what I've heard from my very experienced backpacking partner: Runners ought to be fine, might even be good with the steep angle on half dome.  I was a fan of my crazy light Merrell runners, but I'm so glad I took my boots to Yosemite - too damned many rock staircases.  This may not be the case for your route.  My boots are pretty light, though.  Also, being able to wear expedition-weight wool socks is FANTASTIC. Go crazy early, toooons of people will be up there on Memorial Day.  Aim to hike up and get back down in time for an early lunch at the sandwich place. For altitude, I'd recommend summiting San Jacinto Mountain.  IIRC the summit is a little over 10,000 feet.  It's a decent hike, and you can even take the tram most of the way up (about 8,000) - this is great for altitude training, since it maximizes your time at altitude. IIRC, hiking from Little Round Valley camp to the summit and back out to the tram is about nine miles. I can't emphasize altitude-acclimation enough - it cut my Yosemite trip in half.  We were supposed to do Tuolumne to Half Dome and out to... the lower valley?  Can't remember.  Anyways, I started feeling really crappy by the time we reached May Lake, and we called it there.  Swollen hands (?!), short of breath constantly, etc.  Really screwed the trip up for the other two, but I didn't want to risk going past May Lake (the last camp near a road) and really screwing it up for them at Cloud's Rest/etc. Where are you hiking in to Half Dome from?"
socalhiking,1tczcz,phobos2deimos,3,Fri Dec 20 23:56:04 2013 UTC,"I did the so cal 6 pack of peaks to prepare and it was a lot of fun!  http://www.everytrail.com/guide/socal-six-pack-of-peaks  That said, I think a few of the six pack peaks are harder than half dome was. The hike itself wasn't so bad.  Climbing the cables is a little scary, but don't worry it looks worse from the base looking up. Just do it and you will be fine.  EDIT: if you can't do all of these, Cucamonga, Jacinto, and Gorgonio are probably the best.  EDIT 2: Saw your boots question. I used a pair of low top Vasque hiking boots (so no ankle support, nothing too heavy). I was fine and never felt I needed anything more. I'm not sure about trail runners, but if you've hiked a lot in them and been fine, it might work. My biggest concern would be if they have enough grip for going up the cables. It can get a bit slippery at times, and you definitely want to have a good footing for that."
socalhiking,1tczcz,Dmaggi727,2,Sat Dec 21 00:33:29 2013 UTC,"Do San Gorgonio (wilderness permit needed for day hike and overnight). It's the tallest peak in SoCal and about the same level of intensity with Gorgonio being probably a bit more difficult. It will give you a sense of what it will be like and how much time you will need.   If you don't want to bother with wilderness permit, then I recommend Baldy. Do it from the village (visitor center) and it will be about the same level as Gorgonio. The tram up to Jacinto is like $20 or something like that so if you don't want to pay then Baldy and Gorgonio are better options.   Regarding to your shoes, it really depends on you. I wear a mid cut light weight hiking shoes (not really a boot). Maybe you can look into those. But if you generally dont like boots, don't go out of your way to buy them just for this trip. Wear whatever you're comfortable. Don't wear a brand new shoes the day of the hike. Hiking up half dome isn't all that different from other more intense hikes in SoCal. It's a big deal because a lot of unprepared people do it so there may a lot of hype around how hard it is, etc. but it's a beaten path and the trail will be good so whatever you're wearing right now should be perfect."
socalhiking,1tczcz,snookedbe,2,Sat Dec 21 00:50:34 2013 UTC,"Boots - leave 'em at home.  I've hiked in everything from high top boots, low top boots and trail runners.  Trail runners win hands down.  All my rolled ankle problems went away as I stopped wearing boots.  As for prep, I'd try to spend some time at elevation before you start.  A few nights at 6,000+ ft would be a big help.  Practice night hiking - you'll want to get a real early start.  Unfortunately you won't have much moon to work with.  Any hike will work - Icehouse Saddle is a good one, maybe Mt Baldy too."
socalhiking,1tczcz,phish92129,1 point,Sat Dec 21 07:21:54 2013 UTC,"As others are saying, the hike is manageable and the most important aspect is to ensure you're prepared with lots of water.  I hiked it when I did the John Muir Trail and we were constantly filtering water because we were giving ours out to day hikers.    Aside from what everyone else already said the only thing I have to add is that I hiked it in cross trainers and was fine.  The granite has been weathered down by the years of heavy usage so it's slick regardless of the shoe type you use and I feel it might even be worse wearing a heavy duty hiking boot.  There's wooden slats every meter or so that you use for traction and then kind of pull yourself up to the next one.    I also suggest starting early as it gets crowded and sometimes people that shouldn't be there panic halfway down making it dangerous and slow."
socalhiking,1tczcz,combasemsthefox,1 point,Sat Dec 21 08:33:04 2013 UTC,You might not get your permit approved. It's pretty late in the season to apply but good luck!   Trail runners are fine.  If you're up for a rigorous hike I recommend doing Cactus to Clouds.

The trail is a little hard to spot at times. The mine is relatively small and you could explore the whole thing. I would say it's best on a warm day where the mine is pretty refreshing. I went in the summer, so no clue about gear around now. Main warning is that it's easy to get lost, but not so easy that you'd have to be super worried about it. It just forks sometimes and one is a dead end."

socalhiking,1ta2bd,Shark_With_Lasers,3,Thu Dec 19 23:52:55 2013 UTC,"I have done dawn mine about a dozen times and I would recommend it as well. If you are in relatively good shape its not too challenging but just rugged enough to feel worth your while. It is open again now (as of last may or so if memory serves) and while not totally devoid of people I never see more than 2 or 3 other groups along the way. Probably even less with it being winter. I wouldn't be too worried about getting lost, its a straight shot to get to it by following the river and there is only one place you can really go wrong which dead ends pretty fast so its fairly obvious. The mine itself isnt too big and I have explored all the tunnels several times - one is full of water (up to knee deep at times) and not really worth it, the other one has a few ankle deep pools but its very doable and its short enough that you can see the whole thing in about 10 to 15 mins without getting lost. It is DARK, obviously, so a good flashlight or headlamp is mandatory. There is a secondary entrance about 30 feet above the first one - NOT recommended. It steep and hard to get to, not very big, and has several large shafts that you could fall into and get yourself into big trouble."

socalhiking,1ta2bd,uberhappyfuntime,2,Fri Dec 20 23:30:12 2013 UTC,"Definitely need a flashlight. You can get to the main entrance with no worries. Going deeper requires some attention. It was a little flooded, so we ended up getting our feet wet a bit (water to our knees almost). There's a large pit inside it near the entrance that you should be able to spot. Would be dangerous if you fell in that thing in the winter. Aside from that, it's alright and fun to wander if you're into that sort of thing (which we were)."

socalhiking,1sqzws,Dmaggi727,4,Thu Dec 12 22:18:26 2013 UTC,How did you do each of those peaks? There is a hard way to do each one if you're working on conditioning. Hiking any extended portion of the PCT through the Angeles would also he a nice trip to do.
socalhiking,1sqzws,Gabrcruz,1 point,Fri Dec 13 01:48:50 2013 UTC,I did them all according to the guide: http://www.everytrail.com/guide/socal-six-pack-of-peaks  I think it's:  1) Wilson - From Chantry flat 2) Cucamonga - from icehouse canyon 3) Baldy - from Manker Flats 4) San Bernardino - from Angelus Oaks 5) Jacinto - via Marion mt in Idyllwild 6) Gorgonio - via Vivian Creek
socalhiking,1sqzws,scottawr,2,Fri Dec 13 01:58:23 2013 UTC,Mt. Islip  Smith mountain  Rattlesnake peak (little bit easier than iron mt but still difficult)  Devils slide trail to tahquitz peak  Marion mountain trail to Marion Mt and san jjacinto  East fork trail bridge to nowhere.  Ontario peak from icehouse (or falling rock canyon x-country)
socalhiking,1sqzws,scottawr,1 point,Fri Dec 13 01:08:53 2013 UTC,"Nice suggestions thanks!  I've done Jacinto via Marion Mtn and I've done the Bridge hike, but I'll check out the others."

socalhiking,1sqzws,DeliciousMoments,2,Fri Dec 13 02:11:28 2013 UTC,"There are a bunch of ways to get up Mt. Baldy.  I've done Manker Flats, and I was planning on hiking up via the ski hut trail and again on the Bear Canyon Trail (6 miles with ~6000 feet elevation gain) to prep for my JMT hike this summer.  I'm also hoping to eventually do Iron Mountain."
socalhiking,1sqzws,summiter,2,Fri Dec 13 04:17:17 2013 UTC,"San Gabriel Peak is a short yet steep one that's easy to bag in an afternoon. Close to Mount Wilson, but not usually busy and there's a nice little bench at the top from which to enjoy the wonderful views. I was just there this afternoon and saw a handful of deer and some bobcat tracks."
socalhiking,1sqzws,excoriation,2,Mon Dec 16 04:09:36 2013 UTC,"""the six peaks"", or ""six peaks""?  Because you're missing Gorgonio."

socalhiking,1sqzws,scottawr,2,Thu Dec 12 22:31:23 2013 UTC,I had a really awesome overnight trip in the San Gabriel Mountains. You can treat it as a day hike or an overnight depending on how far you feel like going.  As you make the hike up the river you'll occasionally see people that have set up camp and are panning for gold.  Definitely a good one to check out that doesn't see as much foot traffic as some of the other hikes listed above.
socalhiking,1sqzws,AmadeusB,2,Thu Dec 12 22:38:40 2013 UTC,What trailhead did you start at?

Not sure if you're looking for a day hike or an overnight stay, but if you continue hiking about a mile or so past the bridge to no where (approx 6-7 total miles in) there's some pretty awesome camp spots right up against the creek."

socalhiking,1so5ni,palmeredhackle,1 point,Thu Dec 12 18:03:37 2013 UTC,It was challenging the first time I did it but I do that and harder on the reg now. I just have to be done by 3 or 330 so no real rush.
socalhiking,1so5ni,palmeredhackle,0,Thu Dec 12 18:57:29 2013 UTC,14 miles round trip can be accomplished by noon.
socalhiking,1so5ni,palmeredhackle,2,Thu Dec 12 18:06:49 2013 UTC,"True, but not everyone can be in thru hiker condition. 4500ft gain at 3mph is pretty impressive."
socalhiking,1so5ni,palmeredhackle,2,Thu Dec 12 18:20:30 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't count on a group of people being able to do it by noon. But I feel like most people (us) can, especially since it's a day hike and you wouldn't be carrying a 25lb pack. Just don't take breaks."
socalhiking,1so5ni,palmeredhackle,1 point,Thu Dec 12 18:26:17 2013 UTC,I'm planning on a 2mph day including breaks.
socalhiking,1so5ni,ParadigmBlender,1 point,Thu Dec 12 19:02:07 2013 UTC,"Nice, that might be one of my least favorite routes up to Wilson (due to the fact that it's just like a constant high grade the entire trip) my favorite being rim trail. It's a little sketchy especially with snow involved, but it gives you some really neat views of the backside of wilson. Do you know if cosmic cafe is closed for the season?"
socalhiking,1so5ni,ParadigmBlender,1 point,Fri Dec 13 17:43:04 2013 UTC,"Rim trail is my favorite way up too! I just don't have the time for the added mileage on Saturday. Another group of my friends are going up via the rim trail on Saturday as well and I hope to meet them up top. Cosmic cafe closed December 1st. I can point you to the group going up the rim trail, but they will be moving faster than my group and won't have a sweep."
socalhiking,1so5ni,ParadigmBlender,1 point,Fri Dec 13 17:59:17 2013 UTC,"Cool, I figured it was closed. Haven't been up there since this past summer. The holiday meals and heavy work/school schedule haven't been kind to me so I definitely need to get into more shape. Does your group ever do overnights/multi days? I normally backpack solo but wouldn't mind joining up for some group adventures once in awhile locally."
socalhiking,1so5ni,ParadigmBlender,1 point,Fri Dec 13 18:17:20 2013 UTC,I hike with lots of groups and yes there are many overnights and multi days available. I like doing quick overnights to either henninger flats or mount Lowe camp. And I just did a three day end to end in Joshua tree on the California riding and HIKING trail. I was at Lowe two weekends ago and it hit 34 degrees at night so I'm not sure how much more mountain trips I'll do till it warms up but I will definitely be desert camping all winter.
socalhiking,1so5ni,vocherro,1 point,Fri Dec 13 18:38:44 2013 UTC,"I too like getting away for quick overnights. I like spruce grove out of chantry or when I really feel like I want some isolation, Devore/West Fork CG. I hear you on the temps, they're definitely mighty low now. Been wanting to test my cold weather gear up at like kelly camp/cedar grove but we'll see."
socalhiking,1sjqoa,freeseasy,3,Tue Dec 10 14:22:03 2013 UTC,"I never understood this, especially at Baldy.  The NFS doesn't maintain the roads leading up to Icehouse or Maker Flats so why would I need to pay to park along the roadside?  Not necessarily even in a parking lot.  I know a couple locals in the Baldy Village area and I understand they earn extra income upselling day passes and that's the only downside I can see to abandoning this pork-fat."

I hate how every trailhead's bathroom has that flat piece of steel holding the TP, it takes forever to get long piece of TP out."

socalhiking,1sjqoa,ycy,1 point,Tue Dec 10 16:15:57 2013 UTC,I don't really understand why these fees were only for So-Cal US Forests.    It isn't as if you saw better facilities in those forests than ones in other US Forests around the country.  Perhaps the U.S. Forest Service can offset the losses by cutting their road building budget for loggers who's fees fall short of said road-building costs.
socalhiking,1sjqoa,it_refugee,1 point,Tue Dec 10 17:55:05 2013 UTC,I was at Big Laguna a couple of weeks ago and the trail was pristine. I'm willing to pay $30 a year to help keep it that way.

socalhiking,1sj5nq,Pankaiks,2,Tue Dec 10 06:51:09 2013 UTC,"I would recommend calling the Idyllwild Ranger Station and asking for an opinion on where to go. If you take the Devil's Slide trailhead in Humber Park in Idyllwild up to Saddle Junction, there are many options, and even though some are closed because of the recent fire, there are still some really good options. (E.G. Summiting San Jacinto, going to the Tahquitz Lookout, doing a few miles of the PCT, etc.)   If you decid to do this, just make sure to get a permit from the ranger station for overnight use and a Wilderness permit for parking at Humber Park."
socalhiking,1sj5nq,ArmSor,2,Tue Dec 10 15:34:19 2013 UTC,"Now knowing that they're aiming for 20 miles over 2-3 days, this is the first thing I thought of.  It's definitely worth talking to the ranger to find out what the snow is like, and checking the weather forecast.  There's a weather station on the tram that I'd watch for a few days before the trip to get an idea of what night time low temperatures will be like, but I'd bring sleeping gear for at least a low of 15°F."
socalhiking,1sj5nq,atetuna,1 point,Tue Dec 10 17:11:05 2013 UTC,Thanks for responding i will take this into account
socalhiking,1sj5nq,atetuna,1 point,Tue Dec 10 17:03:07 2013 UTC,How many miles are you aiming for?
socalhiking,1sj5nq,ycy,1 point,Tue Dec 10 13:30:01 2013 UTC,Maybe like 20 miles max
socalhiking,1sj5nq,atetuna,1 point,Tue Dec 10 17:02:25 2013 UTC,"It could be a bit cold wherever you go.  I would assume you are cool with that.  If you are feeling snowy mountains and have the experiance San Jacinto would be the way to go.  However, fires are banned in the state park, which makes those 15 cold, dark hours in January very long.  I did it once and won't do it again, because spending that much time in a sleeping bag sucks.  Otherwise I would do the PCT from I-8 North to Mt. Laguna.  There might be a little snow, but it shouldn't be bad enough to require equipment.  I think fires are good there too."

socalhiking,1shvay,grammacrobat,2,Mon Dec 9 22:21:12 2013 UTC,Question: how much snow was up there? I was on baldy this sunday and it was pretty pitiful after all the hype. Only an inch or so.
socalhiking,1shvay,grammacrobat,4,Mon Dec 9 22:49:59 2013 UTC,"3-6 inches. Almost none on the South Sides. Thats why I chose Waterman, since most of the approach is on the North."

socalhiking,1sgt1j,klown_13,2,Mon Dec 9 18:53:53 2013 UTC,Thanks! We definitely will... Should I follow the parking instructions on this site? http://www.everytrail.com/guide/sandstone-peak
socalhiking,1sgt1j,klown_13,1 point,Mon Dec 9 19:49:21 2013 UTC,"Yep, if you drive about a mile east of the Circle X Ranch ranger's office you'll see a parking lot on the north side of Yerba Buena marked as Sandstone Peak Trailhead.  That's the spot.  I think doing the loop counter-clockwise (as suggested in your link) is the most rewarding.  Be sure to keep an eye out for the Balanced Rock about halfway up the Mishe Mokwa trail.  Also, if you make it out to Tri Peaks, I'd suggest following the ridgeline to the smaller peak just south (~0.1 mile) of Tri Peaks, which offers even better views up the coast towards Ventura."
socalhiking,1sgt1j,scottawr,1 point,Mon Dec 9 20:02:52 2013 UTC,Thanks for your insight! Should be fun :)
socalhiking,1sgt1j,Dmaggi727,2,Mon Dec 9 20:12:26 2013 UTC,Lots of fun scrambling over by tri peaks. Love this hike so many interesting rocks to explore and climb.
socalhiking,1sfy96,star_pilot,3,Mon Dec 9 05:20:17 2013 UTC,"Night hiking is amazing - especially in snow. Snow acts like a mirror with a bright moon and lights up the night.  That said, the big danger here is route finding. It's easy to loose a snowy trail in broad daylight let alone at night. I say go for it! But be cautious."
socalhiking,1sfy96,grammacrobat,2,Mon Dec 9 06:50:13 2013 UTC,If you were planning to take the tram back down I'm not sure it's open that late.  What are you fearing - not finding the trail or having to spend the night?
socalhiking,1sfy96,summiter,3,Mon Dec 9 05:31:10 2013 UTC,"Last tram down is 9:45. I'm worried about losing the trail (and having to spend the night, I guess). Zebralights are bright but still limited in throw of light."
socalhiking,1sfy96,summiter,4,Mon Dec 9 05:42:37 2013 UTC,I think you'll be fine finding the trail.  The trail is well-traveled throughout the year and I wouldn't worry about losing it unless traveling during a stow storm.
socalhiking,1sfy96,scottawr,2,Mon Dec 9 05:54:54 2013 UTC,"I don't think you would be able to see the lights of the tram from most of the route, too many big trees in the way. Its not the most complicated route, especially if you have done it before. Would you be going solo or bringing a partner? if so what is their skill level? can they deal if they get separated from you? Is it ""safe""? isn't really a good question, are you willing to experience all the conditions and events that can occur? do you think you are prepared or do you know?  sounds like tons of fun you would probably get some nice views, just make sure you are 100% prepared."
socalhiking,1sfy96,scottawr,2,Mon Dec 9 05:47:56 2013 UTC,"Solo. I'm pretty confident about doing it myself. The tram station lights thing is from another account I read from some guy caught out there at night, without lighting. He was feeling the ground with his hands to detect the trail, crazy."

socalhiking,1s4e2h,HikingFool,2,Thu Dec 5 03:11:54 2013 UTC,IMO the rattlesnake peak route listed should be changed to http://www.summitpost.org/rattlesnake-peak-loop-simple-trip-report-and-some-history/275276 much harder way to get p but is definitely more scenic than the route they have listed.  12 & 13 I'm not sure are deserving of this list are they really that difficult?

That being said, I have never been ticketed for forgetting day use permits and have never run into a ranger after getting my permits for overnights to popular places like Kelly Camp (Baldy area).   I'm only saying this because you have made a real conscious effort to try to go through the proper channels. What I might do is pick up a self issue day permit and at least bring that. In addition to that, I would be sure I had a fire permit with me, and that I knew the specific rules and restrictions relating to camping in the Cucamonga Wilderness. I think if you're armed with all of these things, and relay your story, you should be fine in the event you come across a ranger. Just be kind, courteous and be sure that you let them know how much effort you went through to try to do the right thing."

Maybe try faxing a notice of intent to sleep overnight with explanation that because of their hours you will be using the self issue day permits for your trip.  Keep a copy of the fax confirmation page in case they try to pull some crap.  Good luck to you.
socalhiking,1rjohu,WikipediaHasAnswers,1 point,Wed Nov 27 21:23:13 2013 UTC,"I feel like the permitting system on gorgonio is designed to keep people from getting them.  They're closed more than 50% of the time, you have to apply by FAX MACHINE, and from what I've heard they don't even reply to legitimate requests made through their backwards system in a timely way.  I have no advice for you, last time I wanted to go there and couldn't get a permit I just drove to the sierras instead."

socalhiking,1rda7i,sterrizzill,2,Sun Nov 24 20:35:45 2013 UTC,I just wear hiking pants over synthetic long johns. I can't recommend gaiters enough though - they vastly improved my enjoyment of the snow.

socalhiking,1rda7i,MattOnAMountain,2,Sun Nov 24 23:01:06 2013 UTC,I'd separate out the insulating and waterproof layers as temperatures  really can vary.  Depending on the weather I usually wear either normal hiking pants and gaiters with long johns in my pack (and a light pair of gortex pants in if I may be glissading) or a pair of waterproof pants with zips down the sides.  Those things get rather warm if the sun is out...
socalhiking,1rda7i,beefofages,2,Mon Nov 25 00:26:57 2013 UTC,"Instead of crampons I usually get by just fine with microspikes.  If you plan on staying overnight, make sure you've got enough insulation to sleep on snow. I like to put an insulated inflatable pad on top of a closed cell foam pad."

socalhiking,1r02fm,sterrizzill,1 point,Wed Nov 20 06:07:34 2013 UTC,"It's great this time of year! We took the trail toward Ontario from Icehouse Saddle, and the first night we camped at a flat-ish area jutting out of the mountain to the north-west. The next night went down past Kelly Camp, hoping to find running water at Lost Creek canyon, but we ended up just camping there and melting snow for drinking. Great solitude, and if you're willing to melt snow, no water troubles! We didn't see anyone until Sunday, so you can totally camp at Kelly without much hassle. We wanted to be out of sight of the trail, and you can find flat places with privacy if you've a decent topo map."

There was considerable wind at the backbone - more than I've experienced in that area before. It was difficult to stay balanced and dirt and rocks were blown into our eyes.   It was totally worth it though to get these shots. The clouds stretched all the way to the ocean and beyond. The summits of San Gorgonio and San J were visible poking up through the clouds. Looking north from the backbone you could see the an entire cloud bank spilling into the Mojave. Beautiful.

That said, San Gorgonio and Jacinto will probably keep their snow longer and have a better snow pack than the Mt. Baldy area.  For snow shoeing: Try the Marion Mountain trail up Jacinto. Mt. Waterman in the Angeles is great too if there is snow.  For mountaineering: Mt. Baldy. The baldy bowl, register ridge. And the hardwood traverse to the backbone will keep you busy. Depending on how serious you are you can also try Ollestad and Falling rock canyons up Ontario or the Telegraph south couloir - be warned though these routes are no joke.  Edit: forgot to add that the snow really sets in around new years...earlier if we're lucky!"

Anyways, someone suggested Pear Lake, which is nice.  It's a pretty short trip though.  You could head up through the Tablelands to Moose Lake, which is a pretty decent trip and a neat place to be.  You should be alone there too.  Pretty easy navigation too- just follow the creek.  Careful with the weather."
socalhiking,1qcmpw,ThoughtRiot1776,1 point,Fri Nov 15 21:37:07 2013 UTC,"Work limitations make it hard to go more than one night.  I work Mon-Sat and some Sundays since we aren't hiring and the work load is a ton, heh.  And I will take a look at the suggestions, thanks."
socalhiking,1q76aw,HikingFool,5,Fri Nov 8 20:09:43 2013 UTC,"It's actually illegal to remove any of the gold you pan technically speaking because it is a National Forrest. Also the dams that the miners build in the river to help collect gold causes the river to pool up and increase the water temp enough to kill the flora and fauna (I spent an entire weekend with the rangers breaking down the dams two years ago). So in general, gold panning is a damaging practice to one of my favorite local hikes."
socalhiking,1q76aw,longtimereader2013,2,Fri Nov 8 22:13:59 2013 UTC,"Didn't know it was illegal to take the gold, but I certainly won't be damming up the river as I have spent a few saturdays doing that as well with one of my trail maintenance groups. I'm more looking to relax, explore and have something interesting to do during the day. It seems the rangers don't have a problem with people doing it as long as they don't trash or destroy. It doesn't seem to be a secret that tons of people were panning there."
socalhiking,1q76aw,tking5o,2,Fri Nov 8 22:21:54 2013 UTC,I think that what he is saying is that the rangers do have a problem because of the mini dams people build to pan.  they try to make the whole stream flow by one spot- where there pan does the rest of the work.    Just assuming.
socalhiking,1q76aw,brochaos,1 point,Sat Nov 9 01:05:27 2013 UTC,sorry I should have specified having a problem with just panning itself. I didn't mean to make it seem like I thought they condoned dam building.
socalhiking,1q76aw,brochaos,1 point,Sat Nov 9 01:48:51 2013 UTC,source please?  i've talked to several respected (and educated panners) and they all assure me that panning there is legal.  will the rangers still give you a hard time though?  yes.
socalhiking,1q76aw,los_angeles,3,Sat Nov 9 07:09:16 2013 UTC,"sorry dude, you were lied to...  http://www.plp1.org/accomplishments.html http://www.prlog.org/11708372-us-forest-service-usfs-intimidating-and-lying-to-prospectors-non-responsive-to-citizens.html"
socalhiking,1q76aw,brochaos,1 point,Sat Nov 9 07:21:11 2013 UTC,"lol brother. I don't know whether you can pan or not, but your source shows nothing. The ""press release"" about Mr. Goldberg's activities was written by... Mr. Goldberg.    It reads like a self-important blog.  From his post:    .”The USFS web site goes on to explain, that Administrative Passes “are also issued to…persons conducting mining and prospecting activities.”(ref: http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/sanbernardino/ap/questions-and-an...)   And driver's licenses are also issued to people who fly fighter jets. That doesn't mean that a driver's license permits you to fly a fighter jet."
socalhiking,1q76aw,los_angeles,1 point,Sat Nov 9 11:59:44 2013 UTC,"sorry for the bad formatting, there were 2 links there.  these people seem pretty legit to me.    http://www.plp1.org/accomplishments.html  either way, i love the outdoors.  i don't like when rangers spread mis-information though.  in the same sense, i don't like when panners destroy areas either.  nature is supposed to look natural, and leave no trace etiquette should be followed as much as possible.   i just wish the rangers would spend more time punishing the groups that leave TONS and TONS of garbage just scattered around.  the banks of the river south of the parking lot up to heaton flats can be absolutely disgusting at times."
socalhiking,1q76aw,scottawr,1 point,Sat Nov 9 18:27:18 2013 UTC,"I just don't trust anybody who talks/write about himself in the 3rd person.

socalhiking,1q76aw,shuxkcds,1 point,Sun Nov 10 04:31:08 2013 UTC,"If i were to pan for gold I would find the confluence of Allison gulch and the east fork and try that area, but I know nothing of prospecting, just seems like you would want to be down stream from one of the largest mines in the area. if you get bored panning there is always fishing or exploring the side canyons for Ross Gulch falls, Allison mine from the lower trail."

Also makes me think I could handle it on my Honda CB450sc, as it is quite light.  Can't tell exactly what bikes are allowed.  The other bikes that arrive during the video (http://youtu.be/Dug0pFJEb7Q?t=23m) don't seem to be much different than theres, yet they all agree afterwards that they aren't legal up there.  I can't make out why because of the muffled audio, perhaps no license plates were on them.  Got any more info? :)"
socalhiking,1q433k,bmacc,1 point,Sat Nov 9 01:18:35 2013 UTC,"Not sure what the regulations are for the road, I have heard of cars and bikes making it all the way to lupine camp depending on gates being open. you could probably get a definite answer calling the wrightwood ranger station.  you also might find the main divide road of the Cleveland national forest near the Ortega hwy interesting. Going north from Ortega might be a little rough for your bike, but south through the san mateo wilderness has a paved road and great scenery my dad did a ride on his bmw-k1200gt through there."

socalhiking,1q4mmz,the_uncola,3,Thu Nov 7 21:07:55 2013 UTC,"So Heaton Flats is just past the trailhead. Easy to get too and you can set up, go for a hike then come back. Otherwise, hike to the bridge, then continue the traverse around the rock bend and follow the trail down to the river. Cross and you can camp there. Tom Harrison maps will have all the info you need. The private property starts at the signs you will see on the trail near the bridge, and extends to the other side of the bridge. Please be careful with fire safety and leave no trace! Lots of boy scouts out there usually.   edit: Gold for this?! You guys are crazy. Thanks!"

But watch out for snakes. my friend was panner and camped on a river bank they were slithering up against his tent all night. I've also heard reports of mountain lions being very active in the area at night. Have Fun. Make friends with a panner!
socalhiking,1q4mmz,JustPlainRude,1 point,Fri Nov 8 07:20:44 2013 UTC,"as others have said, no worries about bears.  you will see many very obvious signs telling you what is private property and what isn't.  i've camped about 2-3 miles past the bridge, it's really pretty, and more secluded, except for the hardcore panners.    i wouldn't stay at heaton flats, it's nowhere near the bridge, and it's usually full of trash and careless people.  there's also a spot just past the bridge, just after the bend, on the right side, up a bit."
socalhiking,1q4mmz,HikingFool,1 point,Fri Nov 8 15:53:01 2013 UTC,"You'll have to pick up wilderness permits at the East Fork Ranger Station on your way to the trailhead. They have plenty of info on camping in the valley.   From my own time up there, the closest I saw anyone camping to the bridge was maybe two miles away, which is just over half the distance from the trailhead."

socalhiking,1q1tmw,sgantm20,2,Wed Nov 6 20:47:01 2013 UTC,"It is the right of the private property owner, but hopefully they'll do the civil thing and sell the property or an easement to the city at a reasonable price.  I'm interested in seeing how this turns out.  That said, from that picture, it looks like the trail would benefit from being closed for a long while to self correct some of the trail widening that's occurred over the years.  I bet there's a few cut switchbacks that would benefit too."
socalhiking,1q1tmw,atetuna,3,Thu Nov 7 00:22:09 2013 UTC,"That's a single picture. The trail is actuaLly quite narrow the whole way through where you have to pass in a single file line in some parts.   I truly believe the owner is an asshole wanting to close off his property from ""too many visitors"" and probably hoping to make some money by extorting the city into an outrageous price.  The owner is a well known hedge fund manager"
socalhiking,1q1tmw,funkybum,1 point,Thu Nov 7 05:08:44 2013 UTC,Thanks for the extra info.  I should have put emphasis on that because it could easily be a poor representation of the condition of the rest of the trail.

socalhiking,1pwom3,marylou5,1 point,Tue Nov 5 00:35:04 2013 UTC,Certainly into the idea. The small pieces I have been (mostly biked) on were pretty nice. I'm a sucker for loops and hitting up the PCT usually involves doing an out 'n back. Ideas here can help.

socalhiking,1pwom3,scottawr,1 point,Wed Nov 6 01:57:26 2013 UTC,"If you are looking for sub alpine/alpine with regular water access, a peak to bag, and enough milage to give you a nice 3 day trip without a lot of complicated trail connecting and car shuttleing, Gorgonio and San Jack are as good as it gets. While /u/sgantm20 gives a nice suggestion none of those other peaks other than the two you have done really qualify for what you're talking about.  Baldy is great for a day hike if you don't mind crowds but only has one reliable water source on the whole mountain, painfully few places to camp, and not really enough trail to keep you busy for three days unless you add some nearby peaks which are usually dry as a bone. Same goes for Cucamonga and San Bernadino. Mt. Wilson can come close if you summit starting in Santa Anita Canyon and camp along the way hitting the summit on day 2 or 3 but you're talking lots of other hikers and a summit with a parking lot.  Not to take away from those other places, they are great for day hiking but for real backpacking it begins and ends with San G, especially now that half of San Jack has burned to the dirt. If you have done San G once, you are just scratching the surface. There is a good size trail network on the mountain with I believe 6 different approaches. If you want more extended trips with water look into Los Padres but to do any better than San Jack or San G you have to head up to the Sierras. Considering how close they are, it's always worth it."
socalhiking,1pwom3,ciociosanvstar,2,Tue Nov 5 00:14:56 2013 UTC,"That's the feeling I was getting. I didn't know that San J was so poor off. I know Idyllwild is pretty much an ashtray for a but bud damn. I'm leaning pretty hard towards San G. I did the South Fork to Dry Lake, the peak, Dollar Lake, and back loop last time. I'm OK with a few more miles but that loop kinda looks like the highlight there."
