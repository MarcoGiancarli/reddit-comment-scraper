Then theres the feeling of community between players, and between players and devs. The fact that it was a moba wasn't the most important aspect to a lot of people.

dawngate,3doxeo,Reparta,8,Sat Jul 18 20:37:07 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you in regards to Dota2. What Dota does really well is background, there isn't much lore but it all serves as context to the events of the game. No character is expressly important to any sort of overarching narrative but they all have a place in a vague fantasy world and their little interactions strengthen the illusion that there is a well fleshed out world filled with drama and intrigue beyond the scope of the game. All this comes together to create a sort of grand fantasy feeling."
dawngate,3doxeo,BreakfastBread,3,Sat Jul 18 02:21:43 2015 UTC,"I love DoTA, but the lore looks like it was written by a middle schooler.  Here's Enigma's Bio.  ""Nothing is known of Enigma’s background. There are only stories and legends, most of them apocryphal, passed down through the ages. In truth, Enigma is a mystery for whom the only true biography is description: he is a universal force, a consumer of worlds. He is a being of the void, at times corporeal, other times ethereal. A beast between the planes. There are stories that say he was once a great alchemist who tried to unlock the secrets of the universe and was cursed for his arrogance. Other legends tell that he is an ancient being of strange gravity, the abyss personified—a twisted voice from out the original darkness, before the first light in the universe. And there are older legends that say he is the first collapsed star, a black hole grown complicated and sentient—his motivations unknowable, his power inexorable, a force of destruction unleashed upon existence itself. """
dawngate,3doxeo,gigimoi,3,Sat Jul 18 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it isn't exactly great writing, but that's not really the point of the hero blurbs in Dota. The blurbs are supposed to capture the feeling of the hero, not be literature, and I think that most of them do a pretty good job. Enigma is supposed to be awesome and mysterious and those are the feelings brought through in the blurb. Though I do understand that they can be cheesy or uninspired at times."

dawngate,3doxeo,ChronosSolar,3,Sat Jul 18 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"In short, yes.  Honestly, when you're competing with League of Legends and DOTA, every MOBA developer seems to think ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do."". None of them seem to realize that if you're (for all intents and purposes) League of Legends/Riot games as it is right now, minus 4-5 years of content in skins, champs, esports scene and player base, you're NOT going to actually end up BEING League of Legends, and League of Legends' lore is anemic, and in fact, been retconned multiple times.  Note: I go off on a tangent here, read at your discretion.  Honestly speaking, it wasn't the lore that brought me in. I came for the trailer slogan, ""break the meta"", stayed for the game mechanics, and only later did I gradually get more and more into the lore. I didn't find out why Fenmore slaughtered Freia's village until after the game ceased development. In between DOTA's hardcore, polarized, extreme strategy (+ a learning curve to put Dwarf Fortress to shame) and League's bastardized marriage between champion homogenization, strategic niches, and crappy/stale itemization, Dawngate hits everything perfectly.   Fenmore, for example, is a sustain based mage who thrives in team fights with heavy AOE damage. He has a shield so that he may sustain damage and trade without building an overly oppressive health advantage over the laning phase, an unreliable source of life drain to give the sustain mage sustain, and the enemy, a chance. He has an all in one buff for movement speed, CC cleanse, and power increase for the mage who wades balls deep in the enemy, and a 360 degree heavy AOE to allow Fenmore to kill everything, and the enemy, to return the favor.  You know what, if I'm having trouble chasing someone, I could build pursuit on him, and instead of getting health, ala Rylai's, I can cast even sooner for moar damage and heals, or if I actually WANTED health, could just pick inevitability.   Tell me Riot got Vladimir designed as beautifully as Waystone made Fenmore, or Ashe, as well as Kensu. Between Ronan and Vayne, I KNOW Ronan was designed to be the slipperiest ranged carry in the history of MOBAs."
dawngate,3doxeo,fly44k,3,Sat Jul 18 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"I have never bothered with reading lore or game stories (to an extent of skipping game cinematics), but reading beautifully designed cinematics with rich and believable backstory made my Dawngate playing experience a lot better. That said, i still don't care about the lore aspect when looking for other mobas, because i mainly queue into game to burst my competetive bubble. I guess what i'm trying to say is, as long as people, including myself, look at mobas as relatively short repetetive games to let off some steam with friends, there is no incenetive from designers to focus on lore and rather improve the game in the sense that attracts players to queue again after finishing a game (much like HotS is doing). To draw an analogy, you wouldn't expect lore in a FPS multiplayer."
dawngate,3doxeo,Strawberrycocoa,2,Sat Jul 18 08:28:19 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of MOBAs find it too difficult to justify a story reason why all these characters are pitting themselves in endless battle over and over and over again. Although they tried the hardest to make story fit in the game, even Dawngate had some issues with this. It's easier to just slap a ""Because reasons"" band-aid on it and devote resources to things that enhance or improve gameplay or marketing."
dawngate,3doxeo,Careful_Houndoom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"This is because developers tend to take the path of least resistance. It is a huge logistical problem, and most are not willing to take that challenge. WS was the only developer willing to accept that challenge."

I've stated before League feels like cardboard, Smite is kind of forced statements although its interesting sometimes, Hots... well lets say I haven't touched it at all during my recovery."
dawngate,3doxeo,Tortferngatr,5,Sat Jul 18 05:21:05 2015 UTC,"Dawngate's backstory and reason for the arena fighting was really good and had a lot of care put into it, but there's a lot of logistical problems with it.  Fighting inside the Dawngate is a means to accrue vim to gain divine inspiration and enlightenment and empower themselves. So if fighting inside the Dawngate empowers the victors, why would shapers from opposing regions ally together? Why isn't each team composed of Shapers from allied regions, or a squad from a single region? Why is Marah working alongside Ronan? Why is Zeri fighting alongside Mikella? Neither has a reason to help the other become stronger. Both have a reason to PREVENT the other from becoming more powerful.  Why would Freia EVER ally with Fenmore?  Why would Voluc seek empowerment when he is terrified of his uncontrolled Consumption hurting innocent people?  Dawngate's commitment to backstory was amazing and wonderful, but narratively it's a lot of suspension of disbelief for any MOBA to have a justifiable reason for ceaseless arena battles. As /u/Dawn-Knight-Sean said, it's the path of least resistance to simply slap on an excuse for the battles then not explore it any deeper. Hell HotS even acknowledges it directly. During the tutorial level, Raynor asks Uther, ""What's the purpose of all this fighting?"" and Uther sighs and says, ""Look, just go with it."""
dawngate,3doxeo,Strawberrycocoa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:39:43 2015 UTC,"One of Thrall's pissed quotes in Heroes of the Storm actually lampshades this even harder.  ""Wait, what? What do you mean, there's lore in this game? You guys actually paid someone to write a story about Raynor meeting Diablo? Isn't this precisely what fan fiction is for?!"" (growls) ""I didn't approve any of this!""  You can have Diablo/Azmodan/The Butcher/Arthas/Illidan fighting for heaven and Sonya/Valla/Nazeebo/Tyrael/Johanna fighting for hell on Eternal Conflict. Blizzard pretty much took the solution of embracing the ridiculousness of it all--it's to Blizzard and MOBAs what Super Smash Bros. is to Nintendo and fighting games.  But yeah. You might need to do some deeper structural changes (or just embrace the ridiculousness of it all) if you want lore to make real sense in a MOBA."

The shapers were being controlled by the power of the guardians of the Dawngate, and were promised power(vim) in return. The Dawngate was also the reason noone ever died while battling inside the Dawngate. So sort of a deal with the devil meets magic construct meets indoctrination."

""what could X's goals be?"" ""is blank really happening?"" ""what did X mean when they said blank?"" ""X is looking for someone, but who could it be?"" ""intrigue! who could be responsible?! what will happen next?!"" nothing. nothing will happen next. ever. zero consequences, zero progression. absolute fucking trash. the original was the only thing that made sense, and even that was essentially ""its a contained spectator sport. entities from across time/space/dimensions battle it out here. you want to know more about a champion? heres their backstory, end of story."" it made sense that way.  dawngate was ambitious. it actually had story and heart. all of the story we got to experience happened in the past though, before the events of us playing the game. the only ""consequences"" were pretty much skins. characters innately had plot armor and we knew it because otherwise we wouldnt be able to play as them. this is fine, because what would happen if you tell something ""current""? what if a character died? would they be removed? that would suck and wouldnt make sense. i liked the prequel story they had, and it was fabulously written. it did well to tie in all aspects of the world and all characters into a beautiful, balanced tapestry of a world.   it is cool, but honestly and objectively, its not all that important to the GAME. having lore actually affect the game beyond skins or maps... i cant think of a single way that wouldnt suck for somebody. could other games do it? yes, but its hard to do. it takes talent and passion to dream that big and have it make sense. smite does have soul, you're just looking for something new and fanciful instead of ""battle of the gods. been there, done that... how many times now?"" go ahead, explain it to a kid where it would be a new thing to them. have them watch a match and all the spell effects going off at once. its fucking epic. league is just a clusterfuck mess, so no, it does not. hots... same as smite but less impressive. all outside lore from their original games doesnt quite fuel anything hots related, and theres no real story to be had.   are there any other games even noteworthy?"

Patch 5.13 recently overhauled the majority of the AP items. Needlessly Large Rod was lowered in price, and is a core build component into a majority of items now. In turn it created a drastic amount of build diversity. Riot has also stated that the tank items are next to be overhauled in either 5.14 or 5.15.  There's been changes in the jungle. Devour has been reworked, and works similar to the old Feral Flare. The Magus enchantment is now called Runeglaive. It's essentially Lich Bane with an AoE proc that restores mana on jungle camps. Cinderhulk is still a strong item, while Warrior is getting reworked to be like Season 3 and 4's jungle item Spirit of the Elder Lizard. The Cinderhulk meta has slowly shifted. Damage dealing top laners are a more common thing.  A new champion was released on 5.13 who is the first champion revealed to not fill one role. He has the capabilities to solo lane, jungle, or support.  Patch 5.14 goes live probably next week. Which includes Gangplank's visual update and rework, along with Miss Fortune's visual update. The patch is an entire Bilgewater themed event. The ARAM map Howling Abyss has been updated for the event. There's even going to be a new game mode featuring new items rumored to be a live test of possible items to be added in season six.  Don't judge League based on how it was when you last played."

I would like to see less passives and more actives in league, and more older champs played  which would happen if there were more active items (which with recent changes to zekes herald, seems to possibly be the case)  Also, it stopped being fun for me, so there's that"

dawngate,3cwmjm,CthonicFlames,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"League of Legends boards (i.e. the players not the devs) have been having a hate-on for point-click CC in recent times, but high mobility characters (Faris here, Zed in LoL, as examples) are pretty much why reliable swift-acting crowd control is needed.  Also, Renzo is magnificent and the idea of a silly robo-nanny dodging Renzo's mighty boulders is laughable."
dawngate,3cwmjm,Strawberrycocoa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree, because Kindra/Renzo, Raina/Faris will just get poked down by capable ranged heroes.

You could poke people with Mina, but the damage was meaningless, meaning you couldn't drive back what should have been a squishy target for the tactician."

With Kel I build tons of Haste and Power, since he didn't work for me as a tank.  That way, his ultimate hit WAYYY harder and his other skill dealt respectable damage as well.  I just used him as an initiator, not really as a tank.  And he was my first Shaper, so he will always have a special place in my heart."
dawngate,3cwmjm,TheDawngateArchives,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"Not entire shaper, but one particular skill.  I. Fucking. Love. Kahgen's hook. yes i know how it sounds  It's, like, the best pull in MOBA history, it feels right, it feels the way hooks should be working.  For those who never embraced or forgot the Gate: Kahgen's hook shoots out, slowly slide on the ground with it's momentum (also slowing enemies), then, when it goes back - it quickly hooks everyone in range. And it's awesome.  The moment you use this skill you know that shit is about to go down (or you just about to miss your ult), and you, as a Khagen, can't do anything for about 1.25 seconds untill the animation stops, but it's just how it's should be. You feel the power of this skill, it's not just skillshot, it's like completely separate body with its own momentum and speed which you should know before you use it (and god its really surprising when you use it for the first time).   But why exactly is it so special? Well, classic hooks like Pudge's hook works like a simple skillshot that pulls on hit. I agree that this works better at long-range, which it is. But, for example, in LoL we have Blitzcrank, Nautilius, and some other character with hook whose name i completely forgot Thresh. Instead of having long-range sniping skillshot their hooks are really short, but using the same ""pull on hit"" mechanic. So that's it. There is no good hooks in moba currently, and it's a shame that no one have picked up on Dawngate's skill mechanics yet."
dawngate,3cwmjm,vurson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:03:13 2015 UTC,idk most mobas have tons of mobility so landing that hook would be almost impossible
dawngate,3cwmjm,vurson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kinda understandable that this hook only works with dawngate's slow paced gameplay. I would've hoped that some tweaking would make this work it either in Dota (which, i think, wouldn't be that bad by itself) or League (which is already a mess because of 2+ blinks on every new hero inc. summoner spells).  I guess that's what i miss the most. Slow paced flow of game."

I kinda get teary just becuase Dawngate was so important to me as a game and helped me get through a lot of things. I'm fairly young (Just turned 20 less then a month ago) and obviously the transition in my life happening at this time was hard, Dawngate had really helped me get through a lot of it. I tried so hard to get over it, but it was more then a video game for me, it was a coping tool and source of relaxation. I got really attached to it, the community, the music, the lore, etc. I wanted to get a Dawngate tatoo. It was my new game/hobby. I was addicted. It sucks that such a great game got cancelled. The art style is exactly what interests me, that kind of mysterious, there's always more to everything then it seems, vibe. The characters all felt so fluid. There wasn't any of those bullshit bugs that Riot had, the game philosphies and mechanics were really fresh and solid, Waystone had their own vision for the game that was taking it into it's own realm, it was going to be great.   EA is famous for fucking up, but I doubt they can top this. Cancelling perfection should be a crime. Hang in there."

dawngate,3bxte2,ChronosSolar,10,Fri Jul 3 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"During the last few months, when development stopped and the servers were still up, I tried to get myself to play a few games, but I just couldn't get myself to do it. I wanted to play it, but I also wanted to cut myself off from it, cold turkey. I regret it, of course, but also wonder how much more I'd have missed it if I spammed games instead.  Spiritgate's here, and Aether Forged has been announced, so I'm not feeling too bad. I have no doubt Aether will have great lore, my worry is whether or not it will hit how flexible yet specific the Dawngate shapers are, without being extremely niche like Dota heroes, or homogenized yet specialized (in a bad way) like LoL champs. I really miss the ""break the meta"" part of Dawngate."
dawngate,3bxte2,PKfireice,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"I did one game with my top 3 favorite characters about a week before close.

Its like every game I ever played with them summed up by their final one. I was an awful Kensu."
dawngate,3bxte2,VigorouslySalted,3,Sat Jul 4 06:41:52 2015 UTC,"Dawngate captivated me in a way no other game had before or has since. It was a place where I found myself in a way as a person. I found my competitive drive as a player, climbing my way to the leaderboard. I found a genuine love in every match, win or loss, and in analyzing my play and the other players' in each game, figuring out what worked and what didn't. I ADORED the characters, I fell in love with Zeri instantly, and spammed 100% only Zeri from bronze to plat, before picking up Kensu and Desecrator, with a couple other pocket characters on the backburner. The game helped ground me mentally, and the community helped me open up socially. I'm usually a pretty introverted person, and it was worse, but at least now I find myself able to put myself out there in online settings (I would never be posting to Reddit or other such mediums before Dawngate, only lurking). The drive to better myself as a player, and having such a rich and deep lore to become immersed in, helped me to deal with a lot of mental issues as well, as I suffer from pretty bad chronic depression (see: dysthymia), compounded with further depressive episodes periodically. Dawngate gave me something to work towards every day, a goal to push myself to reach, and one I enjoyed playing to push myself with. It was a way to enjoy myself, and to feel like I had real value in my ability to play the game competitively. It was a way to distract myself from self loathing and pessimistic outlooks through putting all of my mental focus on playing the game to the best of my ability, and in having fun through innovating builds and strategies.    I feel like Dawngate changed me in a lot of ways as a person, both on and off-line. I feel it enriched me in ways I could never describe. I feel this game grounded me in a way I have never found before or since in anything else. I feel less whole as a person without this game. I miss this game terribly, and I miss playing with every single one of you. Even if I shit talked you in game, or complained, it was never out of ill intention, only out of a deep love for this game and out of my competitive drive to be better at the game, and half the time it wasn't serious and only joking and trolling (though my dry humor sometimes left that unappreciated, to which I apologize). I go through every single day wishing for nothing more than to be able to play this game with all of you again, and I know this will never come to fruition. I love you all in this community, and I loved Waystone and their efforts, and I loved Dawngate. This game has left a serious hole in me as a person with its absence. <3"

dawngate,3bxte2,nerdbomer,2,Fri Jul 3 06:14:55 2015 UTC,"The ability to actually see myself getting really good at the ground floor was great.  Once you got into the higher ranks, people were better, but there was usually a relaxed understanding, especially once you had played with people a few times (unless you were like 4 losses to them and had to prove yourself).  There was no huge pressure, because ranked didn't technically exist yet (just a cool community made site for the most part, which was awesome).    I'm glad we got to play the game, at very least we wont be left with memories of a rotting game full of toxicity and poor development choices.

dawngate,3bss43,MessorisTrucis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:50:38 2015 UTC,You pretty much only need the basic logic and you can program. The rest is just reading up on the language you are learning to use and putting the puzzle pieces into place to make it work. There are two stages of programming one is when you sit there going I have no idea what I'm doing then you figure it out and go beast mode and know exactly what to do. Then you repeat till you have to debug and then you just bash your face on the keyboard and plead with any deity that will hear your prayers till it works and move to the next program.

Just start a project for fun in your spare time and learn some more about it. That's the best way I can recommend to improve your coding skills is just to code. Either that or look up open source projects download the source and then go through it and figure out how it works. It seems dumb and a waste of time, but it really does help."

Some of the sound rooms have their windows blocked up since they're not announced yet.

dawngate,3btqor,PajamaLlamma,24,Thu Jul 2 02:02:12 2015 UTC,"League is not killing MOBAs. MOBAs are killing MOBAs by trying to copy League without innovating in ways that people actually find interesting. In fact, I would say that these other MOBAs wouldn't even have gotten the inspiration and funding they needed to exist in the first place without the popularity of League drawing the attention of devs and publishers.  Dawngate was the exception in that it actually did advance the genre in meaningful ways, but EA is EA."
dawngate,3btqor,bunny__bread,13,Thu Jul 2 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"Plenty of other mobas are and will thrive. Moba is the new MMO. Ever hear of the fabled ""WoW killer""? It will pass and there will be others. They just have to grow the balls and have the common knowledge that you won't take on the titan. At least not at the start. They already went through the hard part. They are on easy street and polish at this point."
dawngate,3btqor,Reptiliancow,-2,Thu Jul 2 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"What other Mobas are thriving?   There's Dota 2, which is essentially keeping a playerbase due to nostalgia and the low barrier to entry.  Apart from that, there's Smite and that's keeping going but I wouldn't say thriving."
dawngate,3btqor,Caridor,0,Thu Jul 2 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"Smite just got released or is realeaseing, maybe still beta, for Xbox 1. It's player base just got a whole lot larger. But it's concurrent player base and customers who actually pay for the premium content is no where near the league numbers last I checked. It will be interesting to see how it changes on Xbox though. I played smite during early alpha and purchased all current and future champions for $25. Havnt payed for anything else."
dawngate,3btqor,Reptiliancow,5,Thu Jul 2 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"Dota 2 and LoL are the kings of the genre, probably the only survivors of the self-called ""second generation MOBA"" will be Smite (because it can attract MMO and action games players) and HoTS (because of Blizzard).  As far as I see it, the only other survivor will be ""Vainglory"", cause that game doesn't have to compete with the rest of the games."
dawngate,3btqor,Dream_Shaper,4,Fri Jul 3 02:17:11 2015 UTC,"The competition is now submitting to the Dota 2/League stranglehold of the genre. The competition is dwindling down to only a handful of titles that made it out this far. Sins' death is confirmed, Infinite Crisis' death is confirmed, Strife is still on life support, only a matter of time before S2 pulls the plug, Dawngate's already been cremated...  You're down to LoL, Dota 2, Smite, or HotS. That's it. If you are not one of those four, you don't succeed. Period. Well, there are a few smaller games out there, but they are small and very unlikely to succeed. They will bite the dust and the mainstream will be all there will be. It's a ominous future, but it's most likely true."
dawngate,3btqor,Dawn-Knight-Sean,2,Fri Jul 3 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you'd have to compete in a completely different niche (or be a non-profit-based mod to another game, like Aeon of Storms is to SC2) to survive at this point. Heroes does that by streamlining everything (and being Blizzard). Smite does it because third person perspective (and Xbox). Dota 2 does it by being Dota and having an amazing number of features. League does it by being League. Vainglory seems like it might be able to have a niche of its own.  At this point, I'm not so much thinking ""ominous"" as ""inevitable.""  Most of the MOBAs have been different flavors of the same core gameplay.  Either you need to further change up the formula (to the point of making Heroes-esque levels of changes) or you need to have changes as compelling as Smite's third-person gameplay.   Or you need compete outside of Anglophone markets."
dawngate,3btqor,Tortferngatr,3,Fri Jul 3 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"They'll need to find some better way to differentiate them from LoL. Just like you needed things to make you different from Star Craft, WoW.  I doubt EA was looking for League level players. Returning all the money they had earned was deemed more financially sound than continuing. There weren't enough players to even break even."
dawngate,3btqor,Lucentile,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say what keeps MOBAs a genre with few games in it is the amount of time and investment these games usually ask for. Most people have invested a lot into LoL or DotA, and asking them to level up another account and unlock and familiarize themselves with an entirely new roster is a little too much to ask. I think things like the having all the characters already unlocked like DotA, a full roster bundle like Smite offers, or just not having a level tied to your account are all things I think would help lower the barrier to entry on a lot of new MOBAs."

dawngate,3btqor,AngelTheTaco,2,Thu Jul 2 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"I think he is referring more to Riot's control of what the meta is, their willingness to nerf non-standard tactics into uselessness, continual release of champions that reinforce existing gameplay patters instead of disrupting them, and avoidance of interesting mechanics in favor of more direct damage and CC. And I think the ""anti-fun"" bit is referring to a post on the LoL forms made by Zileas back in 2010 outlining Riot's design philosophy one that, IMO, they have failed to follow to any reasonable degree."
dawngate,3btqor,Locke03,2,Thu Jul 2 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"When they nerf non-standard tacitcs like when ap lulu was extremely oppressive (it still kinda is) the lastest nerf to a off-build as ad bruiser fizz because his max hp damage with attack speed was crazy especially vs the rising tank meta, Ad malphite was removed in favor to buff his w to buff armor and ap malph. Other than that no off builds have been nerfed heck ap mf got buffed for some reason and smtie ezreal is getting buffed in pbe (inderectly). Also what was the post zileas posted?"

dawngate,3btqor,WatchVaderDance,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"Smite Ezreal is also getting nerfed (as Runeglaive proccing Luden's Echo was a bug that's been fixed on PBE.) He can still take it for waveclear/converting his Q to magic damage, but it can't proc Luden's Echo anymore."
dawngate,3btqor,Tortferngatr,2,Fri Jul 3 22:12:17 2015 UTC,"Smite Ezreal is still going to be top tier even after the Luden's nerf. Current Runeglave Ezreal outdamages old AP Ezreal without Luden's and has AoE with much more potent and spammable poke/burst/mobility than other siege mids.  The change is fucking needed. A lot of AP ezreals have been skipping Luden's for a deathcap powerspike or morrello to further increase poke spam and mobility.  Furthermore, Runeglaive, among multiple other AP items, are getting buffed that same patch.  AP Ezreal is currently the best champion in this patch at high level play and games are basically decided by how good of an Ezreal player your mid is right now. He honestly deserves a lot harsher nerfs than that bugfix.  There really isn't anything ""unconventional"" that has been removed from League unless it was completely overbearing and/or pointless to keep in. ""unconventional"" things often get nerfed when they get picked because those unconventional things are often way stronger than intended, and even after the changes they are more often than not still viable."

dawngate,3btqor,AngelTheTaco,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"All of the last 6 champions have had unique mechanics (with Azir, Bard, and Ekko doing some very interesting things.) Recent reworks have tended towards more uniqueness (though not total uniqueness.)  The meta...really hasn't bothered people enough to remove it. And what existing gameplay patterns?  This is coming from someone who mostly moved to Heroes of the Storm, but sometimes sticks around League for unusual stuff, temporary game modes, and ARAM.  I believe that they mentioned that the rules were guidelines (ones that they later mentioned they were more willing to break by the time of Kalista's release), and that sometimes trading one thing or another was needed."
dawngate,3btqor,Tortferngatr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:11:08 2015 UTC,"They have, and I think Bard is a great example of what Riot should do more of, but as the game currently stands there is no compelling reason to pick Bard other than liking to play Bard as, in my experience at least, League is becoming more and more about ZOMGWTFPWND damage and CC combos from mobile, tanky fighters and burst assassins than it is about interesting mechanics, good tactics, and clever counterplay."
dawngate,3btqor,Locke03,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:47:21 2015 UTC,Bard is actually getting picked in competitive right now (he got buffs).
dawngate,3btqor,Tortferngatr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Echoing what dashes said- people have invested too much time, money, and effort into Dota and LoL, that when a new moba comes with yet another grind system it turns said players off.  I feel this about HotS too: yeah it's fun, but serious players will not suddenly join HotS, which is still unfinished and still very grindy, and forego everything they've done over the past 2, 3, 4 years in LoL and Dota."
dawngate,3btqor,scorekeeper12,2,Thu Jul 2 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"I will agree that HotS grind was initially off-putting, an account level, gold grind for unlocks AND an individual level for every champ? It was a lot to do, but I feel they have gotten better at it, removing the character level being tied to ability progression in game was a good choice, and I like the daily quest they have for gold grinding.   There is still a good amount of investment time there, especially if you're doing ranked (which I haven't tried yet). Luckily I think they have innovated enough on the regular MOBA formula that it's one the better options if you've already put a lot of time into LoL or Dota."
dawngate,3btqor,0nlydashes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:43:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, yes and no... obviously Dawngate would have done well if EA didn't go and fuck everything up, regardless of League."
dawngate,3btqor,SaxPanther,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"There is only one reason why other MOBA fail to take leagues market.  INVESTMENT  No one wants to invest time or money in starting fresh in a game that is pretty much the same as the last one. If they were trees, there roots would be ingrained deep in the mantle. You can fight about other MOBA not innovating enough but it doesn't matter what they do to appeal. Money appeals way more then any other factor and when the average player has one to two hundred dollars invested in costumes and characters all any new MOBA will do is make players miss the  variety of options they put money into.    So how can any MOBA succeed to compete with league?    Others have and the biggest factors are doing things differently and a big company backing them. Sadly Dawngate could of made it but EA probably didn't want to be in such a volatile market, especially when a few months ago everyone and their cousin was making a MOBA. Those MOBA are all failing now because many are just copy and pasted without any substantial publisher behind them.  DOTA2 is leagues biggest competitor, and they have a few major advantages to their livelihood. Valve, steam, all champs unlocked, and being the successor to the original. Many other MOBA I don't have much experience with, all seem to float beneath the two big wigs solely because they entered the market sooner than the rest of the recents.    So when and can League fail?    Currently league has reached a critical mass of over saturation. The rework of summoners rift, merely life support pumped into the system. New champions come out with overloaded kits obsoleting many old and forgotten ones. I personally believe League has both reached the point of its highest popularity and it's ability to be diverse from its competition. All that is left is a slow decline over 3 years until League is only played by the hardcore fanbase. Another 2-3 years after that and it'll disappear.    Why GoGigantic?    They meet the criteria of a successful MOBA. They have backing from Microsoft who are not a company known to give up easily and a large array of innovation. Another factor leading to it's success the the mass amount of MOBA dying right now. This makes the timing almost on the bullseye perfect, for a new MOBA to enter the equilibrium.   I think August is when Beta goes live and many top streamers in all sorts of gaming communities will be given the golden ticket. After the LCS this fall, some larger League players will probably dip their feet in Gigantic water. A year after that, League will have it's least popular season since the early days continuing to diminish until RIOT eventually makes a new game.    This is my speculation."
dawngate,3btqor,sharesomefun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"I'm agree, Riot even started to mirror some features from others MOBAs, which confirms that they're not the top of the innovation anymore and their game needs to take other ones ideas to keep itself updated enough. Is not actually a bad thing, it always happens.  BUT I don't think ""Gigantic"" is the only answer, there is also ""Battleborn"" and ""Overwatch"". There is a strange mix of FPS/action with MOBA's dynamics developing right now that could be the ""next big thing""."

So it would still reward you for being aggressive like old Predator did, but the reward would be actually actively helping you instead of being just a winmore thing.   I think the bonus Vim on Spirit Worker kills was going to go away, too, but I'm not totally sure on that."

dawngate,3av050,AngelTheTaco,3,Tue Jun 23 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"And League continues it's trend of over-loading the new champions kit on mechanics. Don't get me wrong, i get that they are kinda encouraged into doing it by circumstance but something in me says it's weird for a game to have a character like annie who pretty much just has nukes a shield and a stun and characters like this, Ekko or Rek'sai. It forces the stun and burst of annie to be insanely high for her to compete, meaning people complain about this little girl stunning and bursting them all down."
dawngate,3av050,Hedg3h0g2,2,Tue Jun 23 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"In terms of overloaded Tahm Kench is barely on the scale. Unlike the previous release of Ekko whose every ability did what felt like 5-6 things, Tahm's abilities are thematically simple.  Tahm's passive has a 3rd hit style to it but rather than applying damage or some condition for little to no reason, Tahm uses this to set up his additional ability.  Tahm's Q is a ""simple"" slow or stun depending on if there are 3 stacks on his passive on someone or not.  Tahm's W is somewhat overloaded. Yes having 3 different effects based on who you target with it.  His E has passive and active components, nut one without the other simply would not work.  His ultimate also has passive and active components, but the bonus damage is needed on his Ultimate rather than being elsewhere in his kit. It effectively limits his early damage and gives him a very meaningful weak early game before he really comes into his own as a damage source. The active component of his ultimate works with his lore wonderfully and is set up to be rather effective but not incredibly convoluted."
dawngate,3av050,ZeroAurora,2,Wed Jun 24 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I never saw that as a problem with league, although I quit just before Rek'sai was released.   You have different tools for different jobs. You have things like Zed, who are scalpals, effective but tricky to use and then you have things like Annie, who are a hammer.  The overloading of kits was inevitable though. You can only do so much before you have to start getting complex."
dawngate,3av050,Caridor,5,Wed Jun 24 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"Complex and overloaded are two different things. Orianna's kit is complex because you need to be paying attention to the positioning of both yourself and your ball at all times during a fight, as well as be aware of all allies and who the best potential ball carrier is at that exact moment.  Ekko's kit is overloaded because he's an assassin with 3 slows (2 of which are AoE), a huge AoE stun that has a shield attached to it, a dash that lets him blink to what he autos next, and an ultimate that provides mobility, healing, and an enormous amount of burst damage which lets him be extremely safe. Oh, and to top it off, he also has an extremely good wave clear tool, and a passive on that slow/stun that gives him execute damage on low health enemies.  THAT is an overloaded kit."
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,2,Wed Jun 24 07:50:16 2015 UTC,"The hair-rippingly maddening lack of balance on Ekko's kit is amplified by about a million with Tahm. His W does 36 (+.04)% max HP over a 3 second period, during which the enemy champion that the swallowed is stunned.  THIRTY. FUCKING. SIX. PERCENT.  Not to mention that he ALSO scales all of his damage (both auto attacks and damaging abilities) on his OWN HP, which means that he 1) Deals damage to people despite being tanky (W) and 2) Deals MORE damage to people BECAUSE he's tanky (Ult passive), which is just insane.   It's like Riot has decided that there can't be a character that's focused on the utility or CC that they bring anymore. Every single character has to have an absurdly high damage output, no matter what type of character they are.  Not even counting the fact that his ult is arguably the strongest utility ultimate they've ever created."
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"we have to wait and see but honestly his max hp is only good on tanks which are so oppresive irght now im glad its there plus if you want anymore you need hp and since most tanks have mr it will only end up doing 20-25% plus getting into 5 people will result most of the time you losing tons of hp and its his only good damge ability unless you max q then you dont have the damage from w anymore. Honestly people like ekko are fine his w is easy to dodge and his q is extremely easy to dodge, people pick squishys vs him and hes a ulity assassin so thats why people thinks broken but in reality if you build some hp he cant kill you anymore and just slow you and people dont ever fight back till they are 50% so they die to his w passive which is theyre fault. Honestly im glad these champs have unique stuff to them and not just be a cc bot or damage bot with no cc"
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"But... that's exactly his problem. It's not with his numbers. Yeah, he's able to be dealt with, and honestly isn't particularly broken. His problem is that assassins are LITERALLY the last characters in the game that should be given as much utility as Ekko gets. Assassins are fundamentally designed to be extremely selfish with a ""jump in, pop someone, jump out"" play pattern. They can have a fairly minor amount of utility in trade off for something or on an ultimate(fizz having a moderate slow if he chooses to trollpole into an enemy instead of using it as an escape, or his ult having a slow and a knock up after a duration), but Ekko's kit is insanely overloaded with 3 different slows (one of which speeds him up if he gets it on a champion, and another of which can be turned into an incredibly long AoE stun if he places it right and has a bit of luck. And also gives him an enormous shield), as well as an incredible amount of mobility.  Honestly, when I saw his kit descriptions initially, I thought he was intended to be a magic damage bruiser (and I still refuse to consider him an assassin because just how much like a bruiser kit he is. The way I see it, the only reason he's an assassin is because of his obscenely high damage potential.), because they didn't initially include the W's passive.  Also, it's fine for characters to have unique stuff, but that doesn't really make it ok for them to be so badly designed. Why does Tahm have to have such ridiculously high damage as a tank? He's still incredibly unique without the obscene damage on his W or the extra damage based on his HP on his ult's passive. In fact, I would argue that the passive on his ult is basically the most generic thing about him."
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:49:18 2015 UTC,honestly if he didnt have the digusting damage on w he wouldnt be played period tanks need max hp damage because now people are having 2 tanks in 1 game and considering you are getting the tank to take off some hp instead of a squishy is a pay off that might not do well for you because you are potentially brining a tank in you team. ekko has ultility in for he lacks burst of other assains yes his damage is high but he cant really go near you if you have some mobilty and ranged and if your melee just fight him you win out right when he says a line for no reason hes about to w so just run or dash away and he wont stun his damage isnt as good as a leblanc or zed and as you said his ult is good for him to escape if he uses to for damage its massive but he wont be able to espcae after wards unless theres no back. we will have to see if tahm is good right now he needs to have the max hp on to be good or he will just be velkoz tier release
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,2,Wed Jun 24 06:54:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that tanks need max hp damage. I actually think it's a great design decision on the part of Riot's team. But you know what the closest comparison I can find is on a basic ability on a tank, in terms of max HP damage is?   It's Maokai, with his W (admittedly, it's ranged, unlike Tahm's W). You know how much % max health damage that ability does? 13. That's a difference of TWENTY THREE PERCENT. And there's only a 5 second difference in cooldown, and maokai's W only roots (not a better-than-a-stun that you literally can't break with any item or summoner in the game), and only for 2 seconds.  Tahm's W is more comparable to, as I said to cocoa, Mordekaiser's ULT in terms of its damage, which it actually does more damage than (2% more with the same scaling, at max rank). It's not OK for a character that's supposed to be a tank to be doing more damage than the ultimate of a high damage mage on a basic ability.  EDIT: Also, balancing champion releases around the meta that they're released in is a terrible design. A kit should be well designed, even if it doesn't fit into the meta that it's currently in (and you're wrong by the way, I guarantee that Tahm would see play even if his W did little to no flat magic damage, simply because of the obscene amount of utility he would bring to the team with a 2 man tele and a 3 second stasis that can alternatively be used to ferry a soft initiating ally into the middle of the enemy team safely. It would probably only be as a support, but still, he would totally see play, his kit has game breaking utility on the same level as thresh's or bard's)  EDIT EDIT: Also, the ""just dodge the spear"" argument of not to stand in Ekko's W field... doesn't change the fact that he gets a stun on the W field. It's just not something that should be on an assassin's kit, period. I don't care if you physically cannot land it without having the enemies knocked into it by allies, it's not the type of ability that matches with the archetype of character he's supposed to be"
dawngate,3av050,Strawberrycocoa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:00:26 2015 UTC,isnt tahm damage over time and maoki is isnt? morde ult also gives hi m a clone and half is instant and does more damage because he has magic pen and ap while tahm will get his reduced by a ton because tanks usually have 100-150 so he needs it to be massive or it would be terrible without ap
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"Tahm's is over time. 3 seconds. It's still a 12 second cooldown for 36% max HP that ALSO IS A STASIS (unable to be reduced by tenacity or broken out of with a cleanse, QSS, or mikael's) compared to a 7 second cooldown for 13% max HP that only roots. For 2 seconds.  You want an example of overtime % max health on a tank? Sej's W does 6% max health on the initial auto, then does an additional 12% over 4 seconds. Which, by the way, is not tied to any form of CC, and requires her to be standing next to you to deal damage. (Admittedly, it's AoE, though, which is why I was comparing Tahm to Mao).  Tahm's % max health damage is completely unprecedented on a tank, and unprecedented on ANYONE for a non-ultimate ability (the two closest are Morde's ult at 34% and Trundle's ult at 35% damage, both of which last over a longer period of time, are on an ultimate, and have no CC tied to them).  Again, it's not a problem with him having % health in the first place. It's a problem with just how fucking much he gets from a single non-ultimate ability. A supporty tank should. Not. Need. To. Do. Damage. That's not their job, it's like saying that Raina should have had a 400 damage nuke on her E that scaled 1:1 with power. Tanks aren't SUPPOSED to be super high damage, that's the trade off that they bring for getting extra tankiness on their kit (and seeing as he can also potentially give himself a 2000+ HP shield that lasts up to six seconds, he absolutely has an enormous amount of tankiness), and supports also aren't supposed to have particularly high damage, and he has supportiness abound with his ally cast W and his ultimate."
dawngate,3av050,Strawberrycocoa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:43:52 2015 UTC,"36+% of max HP? O_o  I guess it's balanced out a bit by requiring three passive stacks but still, god DAMN."
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"It's not balanced at all. His W literally does more damage than MORDEKAISER'S ULTIMATE (with the same scaling and everything!), and it's on a 12 second cooldown. Oh, and since it does that damage over a noticeably shorter period of time, and because the enemy is in stasis during it, they have much MUCH less of a chance to heal off the damage and survive (compare 17% max HP burst and then 1.7% per second over a 10 second period on Morde's ult to 12% per second over 3 seconds on Tahm's W)  EDIT: On top of that, his ult's passive gives him an easy extra 250 magic damage on every auto attack as well as his Q and his W. All while building EXTREMELY tanky (3000 HP gets you that extra damage). And he has the potential to effectively reactively kayle ult himself with his E, because he automatically gains the entire gray HP bar as a shield, so he can be burst down to 1000 HP from 3000 and then simply press E and be at, effectively, 3000 HP again. He's incredibly difficult to kill, while also having one of the best utility ultimates in the game, and obscenely high damage for a tank. On top of that, he can also initiate with a teammate fantastically well (have a kennen ult then jump in his mouth and you've got a Tahm with kennen's electricity storm running at your team with a 50% movement speed boost) and has the ability to keep a target locked down for up to about 4.5 seconds straight, if they don't have tenacity (get three stacks on them, Q them, then W them as the stun wears off)."
dawngate,3av050,FuriousNarwall,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:45:51 2015 UTC,"Ooooof. That sounds broke as hell. O_o  (which means it will stomp across the game for two weeks on release until the hype dies down and balancing nerfs happen, per usual.)"
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean... honestly, though. Besides his numbers issues (oh, I forgot to mention that the 36% max HP is ALSO augmented by your ult's passive, so at level 16, you're doing 36 (+.04 AP)% max enemy HP + 10 + (.08 bonus HP)%, which on an off tanky build comes out to an extra 150 damage or so. In testing against bots, I was doing 800+ damage to the carry bots with just my Q. Obviously, some of that was being fed, but a real carry isn't going to be buying MR until they've got a significant number of damage items anyway, so it pretty accurately represents the amount of damage he can deal to carries. With a ranged, 6 second cooldown skillshot that can slow/stun :|)  EDIT: Wow, got so sidetracked with pondering how the hell it even made it to PBE. Anyway, what I was going to say is that besides the numbers issues, while testing him, I've actually realized that Riot may have created the first ever bruiser support, even if it was unintentional. He doesn't really match normal tank conventions, because he only has single target lockdown, and he can absolutely wreck a squishy in a 1v1. In addition, his defensive buff feels more like something that you would see on a fighter than on a tank, because of its potential to be insanely powerful and instantaneous, but its inability to actually keep him sustained over a long fight.  I feel like his play pattern is going to be eating an ally with a powerful initiation ability that they can use while in stasis (Kennen, Swain, Fiddlesticks, etc) -> Run into the middle of the enemy team -> Spit out stasis'd ally in the middle of the team to wreck havoc -> charge the carry, activating E as appropriate -> Building stacks on the carry until you can stun them and then eat them to take them out of the fight for 4+ seconds and deal a huge amount of damage to them.  So... don't get me wrong. I actually really like Tahm. They just need to drastically nerf his numbers."
dawngate,3av050,FuriousNarwall,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"Played him a ton on PBE, just to let you know, he's not THAT strong. By the time an average game ends, you have about ~110 extra damage on all your abilities or so. Also, his W requiring 3 stacks is completely exploitable and easy to play around, as well as all his other abilities (1 damage ability) doing very, very little.  Also, you act like his ult doesn't alter tank build paths, but it does. You can either focus on mitigation or hp, there is a clear tradeoff, especially at support.   Your claim about damage output is also pretty off, plenty of recent characters released don't have absurdly high damage output.  His ult is also not the strongest utility thing they've ever created, it has a ton of drawbacks, and is extremely hard to use without a coordinated team.  It's not like I think riot is the god of moba creators, they defenitely have complexity creep stuff happening, but this post is an over-reaction.  Also just to point out his laning phase has pretty clear and intense weakness, both in top and as a support."
dawngate,3av050,desucrator,3,Wed Jun 24 21:34:19 2015 UTC,"Fine, fair enough, Bard has low damage output. Yes, I'll admit I was using hyperbole, because this is something that Riot's been doing for a while that really bugs me. My issue is more with the large amounts of free damage that they build into kits (Ekko's W, Tahm's ult, Kalista's W). A kit doesn't have to be completely overloaded with damage to be useable. All of those kits would still be playable in their own right WITHOUT having random extra damage on passives that are baked into their kit.  Honestly, after testing him out a bit more, I'm fairly OK with the ult's extra damage, because I realized that he really has to be thought of as a bruiser rather than a tank (although I really dislike it being on his abilities as well as it makes his harass damage in a siege situation way better than it should be). His play pattern fits that of a bruiser pretty much to a T, since he's built around locking a single target down and being really sticky if he can get up to you (he even has soft initiation instead of hard initiation, which is something that's normally used on bruisers).  I really disagree that the ult's passive forces you to alter your build path. Most tanks nowadays are buying Warmog's + Righteous Glory and at least one or two other high health items anyway, so it's not like he needs to do a particularly different build from the standard tank one (although I far prefer him with a bruiser-y AP build, because of the amount of damage output he gets).  His W requiring three stacks isn't really an excuse for the absurd amount of damage it does, though, particularly with the incredible amount of utility it also brings. Like I said, his W has LITERALLY the highest % health damage in the game, even above that of ultimates that deal % max HP. I think it's reasonable for it to have higher damage potential than a normal % max health basic ability, because yes, he DOES have to stack it up (although honestly, once he HAS swallowed someone, if by some miracle they survive after getting spat out, it's pretty damn hard to get away), so it should be OK for the damage that it deals to be a bit higher (but again, you also have to consider that it stasis's the enemy for 3 seconds which is long for a hard CC. It completely takes them out of the fight, and they can't even QSS/Cleanse/Mikael's out of it). But that's it. It should be a BIT higher. Maybe bump it to 18 - 20% max HP at max rank (still noticeably higher than other single target % max health with a hard CC tied to it), but 36 is just fucking dumb.  His shield is also just too good. It hits its full potential with a single rank, which is just poor design. I'd like to see his current passive get moved to his W (because it... doesn't really do anything as a central passive.), and his current E passive moved to his base passive. They could then scale the potential of the shield by leveling it, and give it an additional effect (I have no idea what). It's just sort of nuts that you can get a shield for almost all of your HP if you're about to die.  Also, I'm curious what you would say is a stronger utility ultimate. Perhaps Janna's? It's an incredibly powerful flanking ability (sure, a bit telegraphed, and can't be used to escape from a gank, but still, if you use it intelligently, it can be used to roam or to return from a roam extremely easily).  And... sure, yes. His laning phase does have clear weaknesses. He can't really deal with characters that push very quickly (although leveling your W first alleviates that quite effectively, and gives him some really powerful poke), but that doesn't offset the fact that he has some incredibly high numbers for ostensibly being a tank (or being a bruiser, or being an ANYTHING.)"
dawngate,3av050,Strawberrycocoa,0,Thu Jun 25 00:37:14 2015 UTC,"His W is NOT the highest % hp health damage in the game, other champions can do equivalent damage to hp centric builds. For instance, if we take a base of ~1k AP against a roughly all warmogs build (between 9k-10k hp i believe), would do around ~76% the targets hp. AP malz with the equivalent stats would do 92.5% (capped at 90%) of that tanks HP with a full W, kog would do 16% hp per auto, 3 stack varus does 75% hp, morde is 74%, not to mention each of those champions has an easier/more viable way to use those skills. I agree it's a lot of damage, but i think it's because they don't want to shoehorn him into one role, so they compensated by giving him one skill that is hard to use and does a ton of deeps. I don't see almost any tanks rush warmogs now adays, items like randiuns and glory are much more useful, but don't give so much AP that his ult damage becomes out of control. I do think his shield should have a cap, to be fair, his W takes him out of the fight as well, and takes away his capacity to be sticky completely, slows him 95%, and doesn't do much damage to carries.   Also, IMO his laning phase is realllyy exploitable. 2 damage skills, extremely low mobility, no ult that actually helps during lvl 6-10 trading, as a support it's ok, but I doubt he'll be winning many top lanes trades.   From my personal experience (which is soloq, so probably not its actual power), I think almost any utility ult is better than his at the moment. Maybe when more people figure it out it will be more effective, but a telegraphed TP on a 3 minute CD has its downsides in the roles its good in. 2-man ults are awesome, but the scenarios in which it works seem to be slim so far, but this, like i said, will probably change.   Edit: And after this whole conversation, he gets tweaked a ton on PBE haha. He'll probably be adjusted again before live too, i think the changes were probably a good idea."
dawngate,3av050,Ornochestror,2,Thu Jun 25 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"Fine. I'll be more clear then. His is (or was until earlier when it was nerfed) THE highest % max HP targeted ability in the game. Saying ""Oh, but if someone stands on Malz's W for the full duration (and we're now factoring in AP out of nowhere? I was talking specifically about the base amount, and comparing it to the ratio for, specifically, morde's ult, which was the closest comparison I could find besides Trundle's), it's more damage"" is a bad comparison because you have to actually remain in the pool for the entire duration for it to be more. Tahm was doing 36% max HP on a target that CAN'T be avoided while also taking them completely out of the fight for 3 seconds. On top of that, you're comparing a mage's damage output to a tank support's. The tank support should ALWAYS lose out in a damage fight to the mage except possibly early game, no contest. AGAIN. Are you really saying that it's OK for a tank support to have the same damage as a fucking Mordekaiser's ult on a basic ability that also ticks over a much shorter period of time, and can't be cleansed?  Also, his laning phase is approximately as exploitable as Sion's is (technically 1 less damage skill, but Tahm's W is also way less telegraphed than Sion's Q for full damage, and he can grab minions from really far away from the wave by comboing with his Q), except that Tahm has way more ranged AoE. He's got the potential to be an incredibly good bully during laning, because his E lets him naturally end up with the upper hand in any otherwise even trade, his Q is a fairly long range ability that he can use to harass, farm, or grab minions to devour with, and his W does a boatload of AoE damage if you max it first. His harass potential is probably a bit below Sion's because he has a longer cooldown on his AoE and because his AoE doesn't exactly go through minions, but if maxed first, his W is at about the same level of damage as Jayce's EQ combo during laning phase, which is nuts.  Also, you could pretty easily get up to a 50% max HP damage W on him before the W nerfs (now I'm pretty sure that's almost impossible, but previously I was getting there with a hybrid tanky/mage build). 50% of a carry's max HP (which you can pretty easily get by building a pen build and effectively dropping them to 0 MR) at level 18 is almost 900 damage. On. A. Basic. Ability. Of. A. FUCKING. TANK. SUPPORT.  That's the big problem I have with the damage it did (and honestly, can still do). If he was intended to be a damage dealer, then fine, he's intended to be a damage dealer, and his damage WOULD otherwise be low. But he's a tank support, he SHOULDN'T have damage that's even sort of comparable to that of a mage. That just does a huge blow to the game by further homogenizing kits roles in the game -  a tank/support should be picked to bring lockdown, extra beefiness, and incredible utility to their team, not because their damage is comparable to that of a mage.  Also, his W doesn't really take him out of a fight unless the enemy team decides to abandon whoever he eats, because he can continue auto attacking and Qing people even while he's heavily slowed. (Admittedly, he can definitely be kited more heavily during that time, but you should really be using your ally targeted W to rush the enemy ADC and then sticking to them with your Q while your W comes off cooldown, so you should be eating one of the highest priority ranged damage dealers on their team anyway)  And I think that his ult is quite similar to bard's - it can be absolutely terrible if you don't have good coordination, but with good coordination and set up, it becomes an insanely powerful tool, particularly during the late game (I actually think that the range on combined with his solid AoE damage from his W and incredibly good late game 1v1 potential lets him be a good split pusher)."

dawngate,3apn7k,soul31,4,Mon Jun 22 14:07:07 2015 UTC,There is a huge difference between what these people are doing and what others are doing. This project is a Battleforge emulator aiming to replicate the game in its entirety. They planned ahead and captured/documented a lot of packets before the game shut down. Dota 2 mods aim to replicate Dawngate as much as possible within the Dota 2 engine and will be subject to any restraints it presents/Dota UI/Dota client. Aetherforged (I think it was called) is aiming to make a new game (I think???) with heavylore influence and whatnot that will seek to fill the hole that Dawngate left for some.

The pushing and harassing and all that was very fun, but  it tended to make everyone stick to their own 1v1 experience until the guy who was clearing out the jungle came to gank. ganks were running at a 90%+ success rate, and that added a kind of tension to the game which was neither fun nor wanted. Those maps felt slow, and were slow, and almost all games on them were decided solely by who was clearing the camps under and above the lanes. But feel free to give it a try, it could work out better for you than it did for UBER's MOBA team."

There was a topic in which talk gravitated towards the idea that only power in the world who could save the dawngate is a microsoft.  (it's interesting that right now microsoft isn't a company that is universally hated ,thanks to people like ea, ubisoft, konami and others)  In this topic Thor answered that he talks with microsoft representative from time to time (as a someone from motiga) and he could ask about dawngate. Many people - including me took it seriously, and didn't took it for a joke.  I emailed him about this situation, and asked him about it, and he told me this: It was a joke ,but he wil ask them anyway, but to be honest he doesn't believe they will be interested. He thinks that way, because they don't want to fund a game that will compete with the fable moba game they're releasing. He promised me a reply when this conversation is concluded with information how it's gone. I gave him a hint that he could tell them that there are two types of moba 3d(smite) and 2d(dota dawngate etc) and there are many gamers who are only interested in 2d the ones.
