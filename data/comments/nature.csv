nature,3e1w4s,itimedout,10,Tue Jul 21 17:43:47 2015 UTC,Fuck big game hunting. Needs to be outlawed in every country.
nature,3e1w4s,mylefthandkilledme,3,Tue Jul 21 14:03:24 2015 UTC,Why is it OK to kill small game but not big game?
nature,3e1w4s,a7neu,3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:11 2015 UTC,"I think big game is a lot worse because larger animals are more at risk to go extinct. But then there's also the emotional aspect that we ""like"" larger, charismatic animals more. Why is it okay to kill a fly?"
nature,3e1w4s,gaelicsteak,6,Tue Jul 21 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"I think big game is a lot worse because larger animals are more at risk to go extinct.   I find this to be a meaningless generalization--if it's even true, and I have my doubts (think of all the threatened spp of bird).   It's terrible to devalue waterfowl, upland birds, lagomorphs, small felines, small canines etc. because ""well they're less likely to go extinct because they're small.""   A sustainable hunt is a sustainable hunt and should be determined entirely by scientific inquiry into the population size of the species in question.  Subjective animal preferences should not play into hunting legislation.  Why is it okay to kill a fly? They're invertebrates with questionable awareness and ability to suffer, they're plentiful, they're pests..."
nature,3e1w4s,a7neu,3,Tue Jul 21 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a meaningless generalization. Certainly there are plenty of ""small"" animals at very high risks of extinction (mollusks in particular), but so many species of megafauna have already gone extinct/are at great risk of going extinct.   I agree that subjective preferences should not play a role, but they inevitably always will. People love charismatic, cuddly animals."
nature,3e1w4s,gaelicsteak,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"We hear about the megafauna more, and we also hear about subspecies of megafauna a lot. I'm still not convinced. There are so many species of antelope and deer that are LC. I do think large predators are more at risk.  At any rate, I don't think I should have said meaningless... useless (as it pertains to hunting) is what I was going for. In no way is it helpful to use an extremely broad generalization based on the physical size of the species to evaluate the sustainability of hunting it. Population estimates of individual species, population growth rate, etc are all that matter. You can't look a species of duck or hare that you don't know the population of with and go ""oh, well it's a small animal so we probably don't have to be too cautious with the baglimits."" Or, ""ooo whitetail deer are large, we better be conservative with our NJ baglimits!"""

Even so, it never says that whale meat is currently a major part of the Japanese diet, it only states that in the period immediately after WWII whale meat continued to be popular as it was one of the main meats they had available during the war.   The ""tradition"" argument similarly falls flat:   No one has the right to criticize the food culture of another people    Yes, if your ""food culture"" consists of hunting endangered species that are protected by international law, we certainly do have a right to criticize. Additionally the argument is entirely disingenuous since Japan's official position is that these whales are being hunted for ""scientific research"" and not for food.

They are all 'Puma concolor', and actually I just discovered that the current understanding is that there are thought to be 6 subspecies, only one of which is in the U.S. - known as the North American Cougar, which incorporates more than a dozen forms that were formerly considered full subspecies. So according to the latest thought (which changes as often as fad diets), there is no distinction between Eastern and Western cougars and so they really should still be protected. I recommend reading at least the Wikipedia article which notes recent sightings in the Eastern U.S., all of which have ended with the animal being killed either accidentally or purposefully.  I say we've had our run of the place long enough - bring the big cats back. As a bonus, here's a photo I took of a cougar track not 3/4 of a mile from my house in Costa Rica. I spend many days a week in the jungle and am not afraid - but rather glad - to share the place with such a spectacular animal. http://imgur.com/YUH11uM"
nature,3a9wme,rangifer2014,3,Thu Jun 18 23:15:12 2015 UTC,"There are parts of the eastern U.S. that could support a population of the cats, having big enough spaces and large prey species. However, the cougar is shown to be a relatively resilient species in the face of habitat reduction, especially in the southwest. The Eastern subspecies was not recently killed off, as we discussed, but rather was largely eradicated during the industrial boom and eastern/midwestern expansion of the 19th century. And this reduction was due to direct killing, not habitat loss. The western cats did not face this persecution, and have done quite well among human settlements. In fact, California's cougar population, and possibly some other Southwestern states, is overpopulated in some areas, and problematic. This has been one of the major factors in leading to the cougars heading east that you mentioned, which are unfortunately all being killed wherever they end up.  It's an interesting dilemma; you have a species throughout the continent that is everything from regionally extirpated, rare, to overly dense.  Management must adapt accordingly, which could include possibly relocating cats from crowded SW populations to former ranges in the East (following recently reintroduced elk herds...)."
nature,3a9wme,Strix24,2,Fri Jun 19 01:48:15 2015 UTC,"In fact, California's cougar population, and possibly some other Southwestern states, is overpopulated in some areas, and problematic.   In my opinion it's the people that are overpopulated. The cougars can only persist where there is sufficient prey, so if there were actually too many of them (in an ecological sense) some would die off fairly quickly because there wouldn't be enough prey available."
nature,3a9wme,rangifer2014,2,Fri Jun 19 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"Well, people certainly are overpopulated, but we cannot be managed or treated as wildlife are. Human population problems are starkly different than wildlife issues that can possibly be addressed (in this case) by relocating and/or hunting.  As far as cougars persisting with sufficient prey, this is only sort of true in southern CA, as some cougars have turned to actively hunting residential areas for pets. So, in a sense, there is not sufficient natural prey, but their resilient and adaptive nature has allowed them to survive.  Now, I am not saying any of this is right, or that I like it. I'm with you; there are too many people, and it sucks that we have encroached so far into the natural habitat of cougars and so many other animals. However, this is our situation. At least, in this regard, North American population growth is slowing, and relocation/active management of at-risk species is absolutely viable in maintaining appropriate population numbers for what a region can support (see: the back and forth management of maintaining wolf numbers).    At least be thankful that we have the resources and foresight to deal with this type of an issue in the U.S. where, at worst we add or subtract to some regional populations, but in large do not have to worry about the species being decimated. This is a real and much more bleak ecological landscape in the developing world, especially with big cats."

But I fear (and I'm speaking as a wildlife biologist) that the 'resources and foresight' are under constant attack by corporate interest and greed-based thought. I can't imagine anything as forward-thinking as the National Parks or National Wildlife Refuges ever happening again. It's true that it doesn't seem we have to worry about the mountain lion being completely decimated, but when you look at their former range (and that of wolves and grizzlies too), you see we're living in a very impoverished nation in terms of intact wildlife populations. Not as bad as El Salvador, obviously, but just because there are worse examples out there doesn't mean we should rest easy."

nature,39wlaa,Cowgold,8,Mon Jun 15 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"http://science.jrank.org/pages/6291/SONAR-SONAR-technology.html says SONAR uses frequencies between 10 khz and 50 khz. Going any higher makes the signal dissipate too quickly to produce any information except on uselessly short distances. Going lower reduces the amount of information carried back by the signals beyond useful ranges. So, physics says you can't adjust the range used by SONAR.  http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/AE439D96-BD72-4D1E-BB99-0C8E228E0F13/0/BA_MarineNoiseFrequ.pdf shows estimated frequency ranges for whales' auditory senses. Their upper limits are between 22 khz and 100 khz, meaning the entire range used by SONAR is audible for some, and that the portion of the range used for large-scale observation is audible to all of them."

While mass mortality events are not unusual for the saiga antelope, they typically affect far smaller numbers of animals, on the order of about 10,000 saigas.
