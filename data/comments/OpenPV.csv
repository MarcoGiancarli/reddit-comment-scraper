OpenPV,3e4hhe,Pathian,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:02:47 2015 UTC,"You still need that resistor on the led leg.  This simply allows you to turn on the led vandal when your positive source to the led is variable.  You pull the source from your battery so the voltage to your led is constant and use that varying voltage on your transistor base.  The transistor is not concerned with the fluctuation of the voltage, so long as its present, it completes the ground."

OpenPV,3e0v3k,LordTrazaza,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:00 2015 UTC,"The reason the Unregulated box would autofire is the lid would be completing the circuit to the 510.  The reason the raptor doesnt autofire is that it is just shorting the batteries, not completing the circuit to the 510.  As for the enclosure shorting on your sled, of course!  It happens to all of us.  Depending on the sled you are using and any modifications you have made it can be a real problem."

I've tried cutting open the shrink wrap, clipping away solder, and covering the spot with electrical tape. I'll see if I have enough room to coat the entire inside of the lid. Carbon fiber sticker did nothing because the problem is the sides."

It's connected to the case anyway through the 510 outer screw. Basically same for all metal case mods.  Afaik you could also connect the negative battery lead to the case. For example the vapor flask with the DNA40 does it the same since the negative battery side is also connected through the case as well as the negative 510.  Direct connection is better of course for conductivity. Anodized aluminium is a bad conductor.

OpenPV,3dyep8,AbramsLullaby,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:10 2015 UTC,Notice I didn't say resolution was not a valid term.
OpenPV,3dyep8,relayer1974,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:38 2015 UTC,"Resolution is the scale at which an instrument can measure something. A scale with .01g resolution reads in increments of .01g.  Precision is the reliability of repeated measurements. A scale with .01g resolution but +/-.1g is not very precise. Additionally other factors can affect the precision independent of the resolution, which is exactly why the two are separate terms. You can see something similar in the ecig liquid report, which will measure something like 1ppm, but note the precision in smaller quantities than say 10ppm is very low. Precision there is low even with high resolution.  Another example is long wire leads from the 510 to the modmeter would affect the precision, but not the resolution.  It seems like semantics but engineering terms like this are kept clear in the professional world so it's clear exactly what you are addressing."
OpenPV,3dyep8,AbramsLullaby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"I see where the disconnect is now. What's being referred to as resolution (number of decimal places) in these meters is what is defined as precision in calculation and analog devices with graduated markings. By the way, resolution in a digital device is not as simple as a number of decimal places. It is limited by the capabilities of the ADC in the device, which will not yield an exact decimal point equivalent. If you'd rather I say resolution in the future, I will :)"
OpenPV,3dyep8,relayer1974,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"The number of decimal places is just an example in digital; resolution also applied to analog devices. Additionally, if for some reason it shows two decimal places after zero, but only increments in .05g increments, it's resolution is .05g. So it's not as simple as saying decimal places. The best definition I've found is as follows:  Precision: The random spread of measured values around the average measured values.   Resolution: The smallest to be distinguished magnitude from the measured value.  My old analog ohm meter goes to tenths of an ohm when measuring on it's 10ohm scale. It's resolution is 1/10 of an ohm. However, if I don't zero it out before measurement it's not precise. There are more factors but that's an example of an analog instrument."
OpenPV,3dyep8,AbramsLullaby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:59 2015 UTC,"If you don't zero it, it's not accurate. It could still be average out the measurements to a very small margin, retaining its precision."

As for soldeing what I did, I soldered small wires (ripped off off a CAT cable) onto the board itself on the other side of the switch, like they have it here.  As for the charging board, you don't need it. And to be honest I don't trust it plus you will need a secondary 9v jack port drilled and extra wiring and have to carry around/have to have a 9v ac/dc charger, kind of nonsense.

OpenPV,3dlb6m,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"I think for a ""my first box mod"" the kit is good for 25 bucks. Even if you get another box later you can reuse the components and get some experience.  About the mosfet maybe being counterfit, you could just ask the seller about that and what his source is (e.g. ebay china or digikey / mouser). The offer doesn't look like someone is trying to squeeze to make max profit."
OpenPV,3dlb6m,ConcernedKitty,0,Sun Jul 19 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"Nobody is going to be able to speak to the reliability of the seller. Assuming that the mosfets aren't counterfeit, which is a possibility, it looks like the parts required to build a functional mosfet box are included. Usually people use two mosfets in a parallel box to limit perceived voltage drop and this kit only includes one.   As far as your question on pulling 40 amps from a VTC4, I'm not exactly sure what your question is. You could pull 20 amps from each battery and be fine, but when you pull too much amperage the battery voltage can sag below the gate threshold voltage and fry your mosfet. As your batteries get older they will develop a larger internal resistance and sag even more, increasing the chance of this occurring. One way to avoid this completely is to build a series box. You will be at a higher voltage so you won't have to pull as many amps to get the desired power output."

The schematics for the box will be made open as well so you can tinker. Even the hardware schematics of the Ares OS chip and the firmware itself will be open. When it's released / final of course. When they follow through it's going to an OpenPV as it can get, like the arduino model.  Not sure what the policy is about sharing vendor links of course but it's certainly worth discussing here? A bit sad to see it down voted so much. Of course another topic like ""what you think about the whiteout"" might be better.

I was saying if the girth of the wire (hold it sideways, how thick the whole wire is.  Let's say 6mm deep is how deep the 510 hole is.  If your wire is too thick, then cut say 1-2mm of the stands out but only 6mm from the end leaving 7-10mm behind it the full 14g.  That way when you stick the thinner wire 6mm into the 510 the normal size 14 gauge wire rests at the bottom of the 510.

Any kind of temperature control is a high accuracy ohm reader that measures the change in resistance of the wire as it heats up. A PID controller would probably be the best thing but something simpler would suffice.

OpenPV,3d2n3a,slutlab,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:26:57 2015 UTC,I'm interested in that and wondered about this as well. I bought a FDM 3D printer because of the possibilities. But I still need get it working and then need to learn how to use a sculpting software and combine that with the output of a CAD program. Definitely not trivial!   So I think the main reason is the up front costs. Not only is the 3D modeling time consuming / expensive but it requires skills. Then the powder SLS printing is expensive too compared to FDM. FDM will require either taking the ridged look into account with your design or post process the design.  And maybe there is a lack of overlap in the skillsets / interest in the mechanical / electronic field with the artistic 3D modelling field.

OpenPV,3czw2j,bradbesoballa,3,Sun Jul 12 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"Well, charging a battery isn't always as simple as pumping voltage into it. It's much better to have safeties in place. A few common ones are reverse-polarity protection, input over-voltage protection, over-charge protection, and over-discharge protection.  reverse-polarity protection protects the circuitry in case the battery is inserted backwards.  input over-voltage protection protects the circuitry from a power source that is higher than it should be.  Over-charge protection prevents the battery from being over charged, possibly damaging it.  Over-discharge protection prevents the battery from being over-discharged.  Here is a part that provides overcharge and over discharge protection. It also looks like a good part to handle the complete charge cycle. It would require you to add reverse polarity protection (through a mosfet) and input over-voltage protection (maybe a DC to DC converter that takes in a range and outputs a correct voltage, or just simply using an exact DC source).  Here is a link about battery protection. Disclaimer: I didn't read too much, just skimmed it.    Alternatively, you could get four of these. They'll each charge two batteries, and take 9v input. I put one in my vape and it works great, if a little sluggish."
OpenPV,3czw2j,KE7CKI,0,Sun Jul 12 08:29:58 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me! I knew most of the safeties had to be implemented. Aside from all of that, would it be safe to just daisy chain 8 batteries off of one output voltage?"
OpenPV,3czw2j,KE7CKI,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:38:40 2015 UTC,"In series? No, it would not be safe. You could over-charge any one cell in the chain, running the risk of blowing it up. In parallel? Probably not going to over-charge any one cell, but any one cell may charge faster than any other cell. If that one hits the max, the charger will see that it has, and stop charging leaving the other cells at whatever level they were at that time. I have been corrected"
OpenPV,3czw2j,kitten-the-cat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:47:57 2015 UTC,"In parallel configuration it'd not work like that. the rail would appear to be the voltage of the cells in total, not accounting for any vdrop.  The real problem with parallel off of a single charger is the case where you say insert a cell with 3.6V and one with 4.1V, the 4.1V will try to pump far more amps than it can into a .012 ohm cell, maybe .024 total resistance which will at best vent 1 or all cells involved, at worst thermal runaway on 1 or more cells."

OpenPV,3czw2j,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:51:54 2015 UTC,"It could be done, but I think the reason that nobody does it is simply cost: there are plenty of Xtar, Efect LUC and Nitecore chargers available for $20, and you're just not going to be able to build a comparable charger for less than that. Keystone sleds alone cost $4-$5 each, figure a couple bucks for wire and solder, another few dollars for some kind of enclosure, shipping cost for the components...you'll hit the price of most good chargers really fast. Adafruit or SparkFun might carry pre-made boards that could be worked in, but again those types of things run about $10 each (at least based on the price of their LiPo charging boards.)  If you want to do it just to do it, then by all means give it a go. But don't do it to save money, because that's probably not a realistic expectation. Personally, I'd rather put that money towards more batteries and other vape gear (or mod parts), stuff that's a little more ""fun"" than a charger. If you have a bunch of surplus parts it might be worthwhile, but I don't think it's worth buying the parts specifically for that project (especially when it also brings up some safety concerns.)"

So spare yourself the Problems and buy this thing yourself.  Yes: I know this is a DIY forum, but any selfbuilt option will be more expensive, bigger and have not-so-good specs as you want to.  But if you really like to, I can share my eagle files with you to see the schematics for a 18650 only charger."

I set my iron to 30w and it just takes a few seconds to tin it with a nice little ball of solder. Make sure to check it after it sets by pushing on it with a flat blade screwdriver or something it should hold solid.  Pre tin your wire. Then apply flux again to the solder blob on the cell and to the pre tinned wire. Re-heat the blob on the cell and attach the wire which again only takes a few seconds. I have never had any problems doing it and as I said its super easy to do and I have had great results from it.

OpenPV,3cunj8,BeatzEntertainment,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"Those sleds are built to my design, although I'm not following you on the connections getting loose.  Can you explain what you mean?"
OpenPV,3cunj8,Fenrjsulfr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"I believe what he means is:    The metal contacts bend when you put the batteries in, then spring back when the batteries are removed.  This springiness provides the tension to hold the batteries tightly and make a firm electrical connection.  The problem you may encounter is that without walls (along the length of the sled) to brace the ends where the contacts connect, those ends may flex.  The force that should compress the metal contact will instead cause the plastic they are mounted to to bend away from the base.  The plastic ends will be less springy than the metal contacts, and will eventually stay in the flexed position or break away from the base.    Basically the force that should be compressing the metal contact will act on the plastic as well.  At first the force may be split between the metal and plastic biased more heavily on the metal, but over time as the plastic weaken the plastic will take more of that force and will be less likely to spring back into place.  This will cause a loose connection to the batteries or failure of the plastic.    This would be my concern.  If however the plastic is thick/resilient enough and/or the metal thin/flexible enough for the plastic to not flex due to that force, you may not have an issue.  If you can flex the plastic easier than you can compress the metal contact, you may have to re-evaluate this design."
OpenPV,3cunj8,intog,2,Sat Jul 11 05:10:01 2015 UTC,"I understand that concern and I can say I saw that happen back when I used to cut up MPD sleds for my mods. I used to remove all side walls to give me as much room as possible and a couple sleds did break after users dropped them on cement.   Since I switched to 3d printed ABS sleds (similar, but different to the design shown here) I haven't had that issue and I've used about 50 of them in boxes to date. There is some support down the center and at the base of each end, but it's hard to see in the photos. It's certainly something for me to think about though for future revisions."
OpenPV,3cunj8,Fenrjsulfr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:21:16 2015 UTC,"I've only used the MPD sleds myself, still have about a dozen in stock to go through.  I recently got a printed sled to test out, but haven't used it yet.  I have been in the habit of mounting components to the sled, and it looks like I'll have to change a few things.  The only experience I have had with a printed sled was a repair job.  It was a series box and the sled (at the contacts) was melted and broken where the end met the base.  I don't know if the sled melted during use or during soldering of the contacts, or whether the melting caused the sled to break or it broke separately.  Hopefully now that I have an intact sled to play with, I'll learn its benefits and limitations compared to the MPD sledsand see if I want to make the switch."
OpenPV,3cunj8,intog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:56:43 2015 UTC,Those sleds in the picture are mainly for 120w Raptors in 1590g like box.  I have to take the sides away anyway when I'm using keystones.  I'm building in wood boxes so I dremel into a side wall where the right side battery rest and the electronics squash up against the left side.  That is what holds the tension on the batteries.
OpenPV,3cunj8,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:55:39 2015 UTC,"Speaking of mounting components, the sleds that I designed for my CAJmods are recessed on the bottom of one end. The small Pfet fits into the space between the + and - contacts at the top and the 20A raptor rests partially underneath the sled. Everything in my 20A builds is extremely tight and it's actually a little hard to get the sled in. http://i.imgur.com/vfvEkqJ.jpg There isn't much room for the plastic to bend at this point. I have to bend and twist the sled as I'm lowering it in and it's always a huge relief when it successfully reaches the bottom (sometimes it doesn't and I have to rip it back out and adjust the chip positioning).  A solder iron can EASILY melt these though if you're not careful."

OpenPV,3cu80e,dreamsforgotten,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"No, but it'll be a little tricky, I'm not sure how the voltage is handled across the dna200, with the dna40 you connect the pin 4 to the base of a npn transistor and connect led negative to collector and the emitter goes to ground that way the switch lights up only when firing.  Basically, when you get the chip you need to find where positive voltage is on the board when the board is firing.  At the 510 on the dna40 the voltage is negative so we went to pin 4 instead which is 5v+ only when firing.    Here's a schematic of that:https://reddit.com/r/OpenPV/comments/34jwlb/psa_how_to_wire_an_illuminated_push_button_to_a/  Edit: that is if you want them lit while pushing the fire button.

I was originally looking at getting a 20amp led power supply but I know that wont fit inside of the enclosure as its about 7.5 inches. I think most of these LED power supplies are going to be too big for the box. I know they need about 5amps each, and as /u/relayer1974 says, Ill need an extra half amp to power it at full. I dont see much on the 11amp side, I was looking for 15, but still I couldn't find the dimensions of a lot of what was listed. Can I run this on something that doesnt hit the 10 or 11 amps that fits in the case and still get some good use out of this, or its really recommended to get what I can use it at max with.  My internal space is roughly 5W x 6L x 4H. If its not possible its not possible and Ill just have to find something else to build in to. Not a big deal, I know I started complicated things as soon as I started to try to build in this case. I figured Id give it a shot first before I ruled it out and went back to another inferior case I have.  Ive looked through a lot of alibabba, ebay, amazon and still no luck.

OpenPV,3cmqvw,FarkMcBark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:11:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly for good design you can't really average the current, you need to determine peak draw, how long this peak draw occurs, and run the math to make sure everything is within limits.  Also be aware that mosfets are not instant on/instant off, they are basically capacitors so you need a good 2 or 3 amp mosfet driver to toggle the fet without dwelling in the linear region where the mosfet becomes more a variable resistor than a switch.  If you do dwell in the linear region you will damage the mosfet if it's not very well heatsunk.  Just some stuff to be aware of."
OpenPV,3cmqvw,kitten-the-cat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:09:28 2015 UTC,Yeah thank you. I read about that. Being a newbie I googled how to simulate this first in LTSpice with a model for a logic level mosfet (2 mOhm). The simulation shows that it works ok at 100 hz and only burns very little watt. And that the current drawn from the arduino is less than 50 mA with a 100 ohm resistor. Do I even need a mosfet driver then?  About the PWM current draw I really don't know. My guess is that because the high current is only drawn for short periods you can average it because the actual problem with current limit is temperature. So if the temperature stays low at where I would expect it for a certain amp draw it might be fine. Maybe it can be verified with the battery sag of the voltage and / or capacity. But this is just a wishful theory of course.   Another thing I wonder about is if the switching DC/DC converters actually draw DC voltage. Afaik they simply use PWM and smooth the result with an capacitor and inductor. But do they do the same for the input side? So it's possible that e.g. the raptor draws PWM current higher than the average. Again I'm merely speculating. I guess to be on the safe side I should use a LiPo.
OpenPV,3cmqvw,FarkMcBark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"LT spice assume that the mosfet is properly driven, 100 Hz is pretty slow so you should be able to maybe get away with it.  However, if you're designing something others will build and use go for a proper driver that can turn it on and off very firmly.  Batteries being damaged with high pulse loads will be thermal runaway if the cells get hot, or shorter than expected service life.  You're doing damage regardless and that can manifest with a great big bang or a fizzle depending how badly you're abusing it.  Tank capacitors of sufficient size can help with this a little bit.    The takeaway from this is that you either need to design a circuit that is strictly for 1 set of batteries with 1 set of parameters or air on the side of caution so it can use many different cells.  DC/DC converters are switching power into the inductor which stores that charge magnetically then releases it in a flood to the capacitor which averages it out.  since they have a high inrush current there are capacitors on the input side as well, buck converters do this with low duty cycles so they lower the voltage, boost regulators do this with a higher duty cycle to get a higher output voltage.  You can generate literally thousands of volts from a set of AA batteries with ease using DC-DC converters albeit at a very low current."
OpenPV,3cmqvw,kitten-the-cat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:36:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for clearing that up!  So I guess with 20amp batteries in series the minimum resistance would be about 0.21 ohm (4.2V / 20A = 0.21 Ohm). That would mean I couldn't use nickel coils.
OpenPV,3cmqvw,FarkMcBark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"If the batteries were series it'd be 8.4V / 20A = 0.42 Ohm, however that'd also be 168 watts.  You should look up the battery datasheets and see what the pulse load duration an spec are for the cheapest battery you intend to use / support."
OpenPV,3cmqvw,kitten-the-cat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:24:51 2015 UTC,"Oh right, 8.4V. Of course you'd turn 168 watts power down with the PWM duty cycle. But if the ""on"" duration of the duty cycle counts as the amp limitation then the usual Samsung 25R batteries will never work for a 0.1 ohm or lower nickel build. And afaik the datasheets don't even really specify the amp draw that precisely. I guess the heating of the batteries would be averaged since they heat up like a resistor with a certain amount of ampere going through it. It wouldn't be too hard to put a thermistor near the batteries to detect if they get too hot.  I guess LiPo cell it is then.  You sure that the PWM load is what is meant with pulse rating?  Thank you for your help!"

If you want to regulate the batteries 4.2 down to 3.5 exactly, one option is to get a zener diode that's zener voltage (reverse bias) is 3.5v."

And, if I can limit a battery to 3.5v output (and boost it to 3.5 after discharging a bit) I'll get a longer use from that charge than I would on a mech.  If I don't regulate it, it will just be a magnetic mechanical epipemods.com button/switch configuration (this simplifies a LOT about design and construction... and brass buttons on antler seem an apt choice)... but I sincerely enjoy the stable 3.5v output on all my vv/vw mods, i just never change it... all the mods I have a subtank on are at 25watts - I figured why not ditch the 'variable' part of the equation and simplify things"

There is an on-off http://i.imgur.com/nhan5nd.png There are no pads to solder wires to for a voltmeter. Output can simply be adjusted to your liking and there is a voltage detector set to ~6.4v so you know when to pop in new batteries. I didn't feel a need for a voltmeter with that. You would be able to wire one in to 510+/510- or add another switch and connect to the batteries to monitor their voltage. With the PWM output, a voltmeter may or may not be able to get a reading. Depends if it can average the output or not. Even then it would be displaying mean voltage. For PWM, RMS voltage would be the more accurate reading."

OpenPV,3c76qa,david4500,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:28:46 2015 UTC,"I planned parallel, but I'm not sure if that's the best choice."
OpenPV,3c76qa,david4500,3,Sun Jul 5 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"If parallel, you could use one 15 amp fuse per battery. If you are going to exceed 30 amps (3x15 amp hold = 45 amp hold for the fuses), I would recommended two mosfets in parallel (IRLB3034PBF or either PSMN1R9-40PLQ are examples of suitable mosfets). Use 14g or possibly even 12g for your wiring.  I have some dual and triple parallel mosfet circuit boards shared on Oshpark if you might be interested in using any of those:  https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/apGClBgy  https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/qV9Nc7Rm  https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Rjc2gpVf  https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/5LBcjyNX (Note: this uses p-channel mosfets, read the Oshpark description)  What will paralleling the mosfets do?   Lower the RDS ON (this is the on state resistance). It's will be fractional according to the number of mosfets you are using. So 2 mosfets, half the original RDS ON value. 3 mosfets, one-third the original value. Current load (max value will be listed as ID on the data sheet) will be split between the multiple mosfets. If you have a 30 amps load, for two mosfets each would see 15 amps. For three mosfets, each would see 10 amps. With lower RDS and current load per mosfet, the mosfets will dissipate much less power.    Examples:    A single mosfet with a 30 amp load and an RDS ON of .002 ohms (2 milliohms) Power = (Current2) x Resistance http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28Current^2%29*Resistance%3DPower (302) X .002 = 1.8 watts http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2830^2%29*.002%3DPower A two parallel mosfets each with a 15 amp load and an RDS ON of .001 ohms (1 milliohms) (152) X .001 = .225 watts http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2815^2%29*.001%3DPower   Quite the difference"

OpenPV,3bwdz9,ConcernedKitty,3,Fri Jul 3 11:48:50 2015 UTC,"The only main difference between solid and stranded for our purposes is in the flexibility.  I use stranded for almost everything except for the wires connecting to the battery tabs, because it's much much easier for me to simply push solid through the little loops on the back of the tabs and solder it up.  I also usually use all solid wire in mods that I'm planning on selling--but only because most vapers are ignorant of basic ""mod science"" and have the huge misconception that solid hits harder than stranded.  In terms of performance (in box mods, at least), there is really no difference.  Also, 16AWG should be fine for a series box.  The guy at the vape shop was right, for unregulated boxes or any regulated box pushing out more than 20A then 16AWG is the smallest you should use (for the main current carrying line, anyways).  I always use 14AWG for my mods (except for 10/20A Raptors and OKR/OKL builds, I used 18AWG for those as the current being pushed through hits 20A max) but if you have 16AWG I would say the advantage to using 14 over 16 isn't worth buying a whole separate roll again--just use up your 16 and buy 14 next time.  Honestly, I would use 12AWG but there isn't a 510 connector that I know of that you can fit 12AWG into without cutting the wire diameter down significantly at the 510."
OpenPV,3bvzs8,fukitol-,3,Thu Jul 2 16:35:32 2015 UTC,The answer probably is accuracy of the resistance measurement.  Lets just calculate an (VERY ROUGH) example with a Ni200 wire.   0.1Ω Ni200 Coil @ 20°C Temp. Coefficient of 650 now gives us 0.165Ω @ 120°C and 0.272Ω @ 220°C (roughly) This means from 20° to 220° we have a change of 0.172Ω Roughly this results in 0.00086Ω / °C or 0.86mΩ/°C   So what does that mean? Lets look at a few different hypothetical devices.   0.1Ω accuracy means you have an accuracy of about 110°C  0.01Ω accuracy gives 11°C 0.001Ω - 1.1°C   As comparison: The Yihi SX-Mini M-Class shows your atty up to 3 digits after the comma. e.g. 0.877Ω  So you need to be able to measure very very low resistance changes. Most existing devices probably are simply not accurate enough.  AND: This is only the case with Ni200 - others like Ti or SS have even lower coefficients around 100-200 (I forget the values)
OpenPV,3bvzs8,zeroflow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:44:55 2015 UTC,Do you really think that they are getting that accuracy on the resistance measurement on a $70 board?
OpenPV,3bvzs8,ConcernedKitty,3,Thu Jul 2 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Before my answer, please consider that I'm no EE expert, but I have some knowledge about this topic.  I'm not exactly sure.   TL;DR: Measuring a big range of resistances accurate to 0.001Ω is hard. Limiting the range will make things easier.  Yes - it shows you up to 0.001Ω difference on the Display, but I simply cannot prove or disprove it's real accuracy.  But i definately think it may be possible since it measures in a fairly small window of resistance. I suspect would be harder to measure a resistor to 2700.123Ω   The datasheet suggests a 0.05 to 0.3 range. To get a 0.001Ω range, you would only need 250 values if you count in 0.001Ω increments. Compare it to a total range of 1kΩ, then you would get 1 million possible values.  So in theory, with an amplifier circuit and a 10-Bit ADC, it may be possible to read such low values with the needed accuracy."

Though to make it happen you'd need their firmware SDK to write your own custom firmware, and I'm doubtful that would happen.   When Yihi released the SX350J, it shared the same footprint as the sx350 mini, but there was additional hardware on the board that was not present on the mini.

OpenPV,3bslhq,FarkMcBark,3,Wed Jul 1 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"You can't average the amp draw, use the RMS voltage to calculate how much current you're pulling.  RMS voltage will be equal to V_peak*SQRT(duty cycle), where V_peak is the peak voltage being put out by your battery.  RMS voltage is what you should use to calculate current draw and wattage.  Rattlesnake sound doesn't really bother me but at 100hz you shouldn't have too much of a problem with it.  Just make sure your MOSFET can be switched that fast with the currents you will be pulling through it.  Most MOSFETs capable of higher current won't be able to switch nearly that fast so you'll have to do some serious research before you buy.  Also make sure you buffer your signal from your microcontroller to the MOSFET gate.  In our application, the FETs tend to pull a lot of current out of the gate line and you could easily kill your microcontroller if you don't use a PFET or at least a resistor (200 ohms should work) in between the two."
OpenPV,3bslhq,jiggyniggie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:04:07 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks for the info. Hope I can bugger you a bit more.  RMS is I guess what I meant with ""average"". My main worry is if I can use the amp I'm pulling using the RMS voltage, and not the amps I'm pulling during the on cycle. The latter would mean the min resistance would be limited like on a mech mod even if I'm only using a 10% duty cycle because the amps during those 10% on are still high. So with a 0.1 resistance and a single 20 amp battery at 4.2 volts (ignoring voltage drop for now) and 20% duty cycle I would pull I = Vrms / R = 4.2 * 0,447 / 0.1 = 18.78 A. So I would be safe with that? Because during the on cycle I'd have 42 A but only very shortly.  About the mosfet I still have to understand if I really need a mosfet driver. Someone recommended IRLB3813PBF instead of the IRLB3034PBF for PWM because of the reduced gate charge. I guess this means that the amps the arduino or 555 has to handle will be lower. But apparently 40 mA are fine. Being a noob I downloaded LTSpice and modeled it first. I found a model file for the IRLB3034PBF you can include and it shows about 40 mA gate amp drawn when turning on if you use a 10 ohm resistor on the gate. So that should be fine yes? Strangely it also -40 mA when switching it off, I guess from when the gate capacitor discharges. It's only for 0.1ms though. Do I need to worry about that flowing back into the arduino? Is that why I see a 15k resistor between gate and source in some schematics?"
OpenPV,3bslhq,jiggyniggie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"With a high enough switching frequency I would use the RMS voltage and not peak when calculating amp draw.  Technically you are drawing full voltage for a very very small amount of time, but battery manufacturers don't put of specifications for ""pulse"" ratings, much less pulse ratings on such small pulses so you'll never know for sure otherwise.  I vape on a 3S PWM as my all day mod and I've thrown everything from a .05 to a .5 ohm coil on and never had issues--although I realize that that is just anecdotal evidence and doesn't mean too much.  Also, I use 3813s as well but you will still need a buffer, especially at the speeds you plan to switch it at (although a 3813 CANNOT be switched nearly as fast as 100khz).  Most PWM mods that use 3813s don't go much faster than 1.5 - 2 khz for that reason.  Regardless, you definitely still need a buffer.  I've seen oscilloscope tests showing the MOSFET drawing up to .7A to close the gate on a 2S PWM with a .2ohm coil--which can definitely kill a standard NE555 or arduino pin."
OpenPV,3bslhq,jiggyniggie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:25:25 2015 UTC,Thanks again! I'll look into mosfet drivers then. On this LTspice simulation it only shows ~40mA but it's only a simulation after all and I don't really know what I'm doing lol. And I don't have a oscilloscope to test this. I know I should probably get one.  Hmm maybe I'll try it out anyways without a driver to see if it works. Worst case I blow up a $3 arduino chip.   BTW I was planning to use 100hz but that shouldn't change the charge amps. Also I ordered the 3034 because it seems to have less charge capacity.
OpenPV,3bslhq,jiggyniggie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:42:28 2015 UTC,"The frequency doesn't change current being drawn by the MOSFET to close the gate, however, it drastically increases the number of times that the MOSFET draws that current to close the gate.  The more times you draw too much current, the higher chance you have of failure occurring.  But seriously, I wouldn't take the 3034 above 10khz or so.  It will definitely overheat and fail.  If you want to go above that, search Mouser or Digikey for a MOSFET with a very low rise and fall time.  EDIT:  Also, as I said, you can reduce your chances of killing your arduino with something as simple as a 200ohm resistor inline from the pin you are using to generate the PWM signal and your gate.  There is really no reason not to at least use a resistor.  The better solution is to go from the digital out pin to a P-Channel MOSFET, take a line from your battery positive to the source of the PFET and a line from the drain of the PFET to the gate of your N-Channel MOSFET, but if you don't want to do that a resistor should be almost as effective."
OpenPV,3bslhq,jiggyniggie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:26:50 2015 UTC,Thank you very much again for your help. I'll try first with the resistor and see how hot the mosfet gets and also look into the n-channel mosfet driver. It's probably not worth trying to reduce one element if you can increase efficiency with it greatly.  BTW I meant only 100hz (not > 10khz) as I understand that is much more efficient.
OpenPV,3bslhq,aspectratio12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I'm dumb.  100hz would work, you will get a loud bassy sound out of it though.  My 3S I regularly use operates around 450hz right now and I honestly like the sound of my 3S that operates around 1.5khz better."

OpenPV,3boe1k,RectalLeakage,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"I personally think most modders use unnecessarily thick wire. The amperage rating of wire is typically based on the assumption that there will be tens, hundreds or even thousands of feet of wire in the circuit (such as in a house.) Box mods typically only use about a foot or so of current-carrying wire, which is a negligible amount of resistance, relatively speaking.  I typically use 16g and regularly build down to 0.25Ω, and have never had any wire heating or other potentially dangerous conditions. I've seen other modders even use 18g without a problem. Keep in mind this isn't for super-sub-ohm stuff, but for the average vaper I don't think it's necessary to use really thick wire and it just makes it more difficult to work with."

That's 74 amps, so now I*R to give us voltage drop, we are looking at 0.185 volts dropped over that wire.  Wire resistance has a lot to do with the the particular build that's being run on it."

As far as soldering goes, it just depends on how much you practice. I learned how to solder well in about a month or two while I was in a microcontrollers class in college. It's not just about soldering ability, you still have to buy the iron, solder, flux, heat shrink, etc. This can get fairly expensive if you don't already own one.   If you're planning on building just one box then it may be best to have one of your friends do the soldering for you.

The less ohms you build the worse it gets, .1 is really a low resistance when talking about arching. Also depending on battery you seem to be drawing more amps than it is rated for, thus you are getting a hot battery(well out of safety range when that is happening). You won't stop the arching unless these changes are made, but the pitting and oxidation formation can be delt with by playing the contacts in silver rhodium for instance, and using a thin film of Deoxit Gold."

You can enter the values in a tone generator to see what they sound like, keep the volume low http://onlinetonegenerator.com/  Anyways, higher frequency will be more of a higher pitched whine where the low frequency will be more of a dull buzz.

OpenPV,3bf7vc,Wadepool2,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:51 2015 UTC,It's the diameter of the batteries that limit you. Getting rid of one wouldn't help to fit it into the controller because it has a total depth of about 17 mm externally. The SX330 V4S also requires a minimum input voltage of 6.2 volts so you have to run two cells in series with it. This would probably be the best resource on finding a 2s lipo. https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/lithium_polymer_battery_configuration.asp It finds lipo packs based on size.

It was usually due to the post screws inside the user's atomiser not being tightened down enough. I would check those first.  If you're not using an RDA/RTA, sometimes the bottom pin on cheaper gear gets pushed into the negative housing. This can be fixed by simply pullin  the pin farther out with pliers, then screwing the atomiser on with less force.  Do you have a multimeter? Without one the problem will be hard to diagnose."

OpenPV,3atiu5,BeatzEntertainment,4,Tue Jun 23 11:40:03 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter what you use as long as it can handle the current of the application. 14ga is technically undersized for the upper limits of a parallel box in terms of amps, but we use such short runs and only run in bursts, so in practice it's completely acceptable. 24ga is what I usually recommend for control, switching, metering and all other wiring that doesn't have to carry the load current. It's easily the smallest commonly found wire size and can be harvested from communications cable like Cat5.  I use 14/3 Romex because I can get a short roll for cheap (never need a lot) and it comes with three jacket colors and a bare conductor. I also have rolls of 18ga stranded and solid, 20ga solid, 22ga solid and Cat5 cable to harvest for 24ga solid. I use the 18/20/22 for some regulated builds and other various things.  If you're making unregulated or PWM boxes, some 14/3 Romex and Cat5 is all you really need. They're both easily found since they're used for common applications.   Moreover, solid vs stranded is not an issue with DC in terms of current carrying. 14ga solid and stranded will carry the same amount of DC. The stranded will be a larger diameter and it will be more flexible, whereas the solid will be a smaller diameter and less flexible. What you choose will be up to personal preference above all else."
OpenPV,3atiu5,relayer1974,2,Tue Jun 23 12:35:52 2015 UTC,"+1 to this. Most plans call for 14g load carrying wire, but unless you're going to really push things (say, 0.1Ω or lower), I don't think it's really necessary. I use 16g because it's a little easier to work with, although I never build below 0.3Ω so I could probably even get away with 18g. My wires have never even gotten remotely warm, but again, I don't really push things. I have a bunch of thinner gauge wire that I've saved from various projects, so the low-current wires in my boxes vary, but IIRC most of them are 22g.  I have been using the silicone RC car wire because it's really flexible (and the insulation doesn't melt nearly as fast as regular PVC when you get the soldering iron on it), but that actually makes it a little difficult to handle sometimes. I think for my next box, I'm going to give solid-core a try for the thicker main wires. Silicon wire sounds like a great idea in theory, but it's like wet, floppy spaghetti and a PITA to hold in place while you're trying to solder things together.  For the thinner-gauge stuff, I have a lot of high-temp PVC that I like: the insulation is more heat resistant that normal wire, so it doesn't melt as soon as you get the soldering iron near it. Tefzel (teflon insulated) is even better, but it's hard to strip and kind of expensive, so I decided to save my stash for other projects (like the tube amp that I started two years ago and still haven't gotten around to finishing ;P .)"
OpenPV,3atiu5,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:25:04 2015 UTC,If this is one of your first boxes I would go with silicone coated stranded just be sure to tin each wire before soldering b/c it can spaghettify quickly.  Standard Copper Stranded wire is not as forgiving if your wire runs are not planned out and you need to make corrections. 14ga copper stranded will not bend over backwards for you.
OpenPV,3atiu5,scottiethegoonie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:39:55 2015 UTC,"This has been my preferred brand lately: UL1015 16awg Wire  It comes in different gauges and colors, obviously. The insulation is very high temp so it won't melt too easily while doing the battery sled connections or otherwise. The wire is also pre-tinned which makes soldering easier. The 22awg wire has pretty thick insulation on it though, just as a warning."

If you have a ""mechanical"" mod with no regulation, the only way you're ever going to get 500w out of a box is going to be a lot of volts, and a low resistance build. Mechanicals will be incredibly hard to get that much power out of. You can get it with a series box, but you'll need 60 amp batteries. Which don't exist, unless you went to lipos. Not to mention, I built a dual 26650 series box. And I couldn't get below about .5 ohms without instantly burning my cotton. More importantly what on earth do you need 500 watts for?

Sag is going to be higher with 26650s, meaning your terminal max power level is going to be lower without more cells in parallel than with 18650s. It then becomes this massive box, which may or may not be important to you.  Then there's the issue of being ""mechanical"" which has no set definition. I can assume you mean an open contact switching design, which is fine, except you'll have to keep the copper polished unless you use plated contact materials. Otherwise, oxidation will rob power from you. Also, the contact points will need to be rather large and uniform or imperfections in the material will limit contact and reduce current carrying ability.  If you want an insane amount of power without taking up a ton of space, I would recommend you learn all there is to know about LiPo packs and give them some consideration. They have some safety considerations you have to keep in mind, but it just takes some education and care. The capacity (mAh) will be lower, but the amp limit will be through the roof."

When you go to super high power like you are trying to do a contact coil will develop too much heat and not wick fast enough to the center of the coil. You don't need to do all of this twisted, braided, parallel, clapton crap. A simple non contact coil gives good wicking and maximum contact with the wick because more of the wire is exposed.

OpenPV,3a9sie,Dhn1994,9,Thu Jun 18 10:43:13 2015 UTC,"Not enclosures, but I've played around with brass for other projects. I wish brass and copper enclosures were easier to get, but alas, 'tis not to be. Part of the problem is that brass and copper are expensive (at least compared to aluminum), and considering we typically use enclosures that are primarily meant for general electronics projects, there's not too much call for specialty metals like that.  Brass and copper are both fairly easy to work with, even with hand tools: they both drill and file easily, and while they're harder than the aluminum in a Hammond box, they're still pretty soft as far as metals go. If you work them with sharp tools, they could almost be described as ""mushy"" compared to steel. But unlike aluminum, they're not as ""sticky"", so they don't clog up files quite the same way (and the pins are easier to clean out of a file, too.) Of course this varies because there are dozens of different brass and copper alloys out there, a couple of which are pretty damn hard (although those are expensive, hard to get and probably out of range for us anyway. Naval Brass would probably fall into this category.) C360 ""Free Machining"" is a common brass that's easy to machine and less expensive, so it's probably what most people would go for if they were going to DIY something.  Like I mentioned before, the biggest problem with brass and copper is that it's surprisingly expensive. There are loads of vendors online that you can get it from, and any metals supplier can get whatever you want. Just for fun, I checked OnlineMetals.com to see what a piece of C360 brass would cost: $62.72.  This is for a solid 1""x2"" chunk, and I chose the shortest length they offer, which is a random 10""-12"" length, so if we're going for something in the G box size, we could get enough material for 3 boxes (assuming they send us a full 1ft length.) That works out to about $21 per enclosure, just for the material: if you get it machined, you're going to add quite a bit to the cost because machine shops aren't cheap. Of course, you can save that machine shop cost by doing it yourself, but that's a lot of work to get something like a Hammond box, and you're going to waste at least half your material if you're milling the brass. And FWIW, a piece of 110 Copper in the same size is almost $80.  If someone were to look into DIY'ing a brass or copper mod, it might be better to get thinner sheets or strips and braze them together or use some kind of nice fasteners. I don't think it would be terribly difficult to bend a strip of brass (say 1/8"" thick) into a rectangular shape and do a small braze at the bottom to weld it together. Then you just have to figure out the sides. You could do something like a C-frame, which might be even easier if you do a good job planning the measurements out first. One thing to remember though is that every metal has particular properties and requirements when it comes to bending (such as whether or not it needs to be annealed first), so anyone looking to bend brass or copper should read up on bending them first.  I have seem small brass and copper sheet boxes, but sheet metal in general is pretty bendy and it wouldn't be durable at all. You mash it to hell the first time you dropped it, so I don't think copper or brass sheet would be a good way to go, despite how easy it would be to work with. It would be cool to see Hammond-type enclosures available in brass and copper, but it would be such a niche product that I don't know many companies would be willing to go for it without a significant cash layout up front.   One more thing to remember: brass and copper both are going to be significantly heavier than cast aluminum, and even in a G box size, it's not going to be something you're going to want to carry around in your pocket. You'd have to look up the specific densities and compare them, but I'd guess the brass or copper would be a good 4x-5x heavier than the aluminum."
OpenPV,3a9sie,catdumpling,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:46:58 2015 UTC,"I am a foundryman, I have looked into casting brass/bronze housings. I made a few attempts, but with my current burner/furnace setup, I am unable to reliably hit the temps needed.  I have some contacts at commercial foundries, and can make the tooling for the castings - however I suspect it will still be prohibitively expensive. As you've said, these metals are not cheap in any form.  And they are going to be heavy as fuck. I would not want a g-box size slug of lead in my pocket"
OpenPV,3a9sie,Jerry_Rigg,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:15:58 2015 UTC,"Since you will have a much more intimate knowledge of working with metals, let me ask you a question: if I were to bend flat brass stock (say 1"" wide x 1/8"" thick), would that require annealing first? I'm think four 90-degree bends, to make the frame of an enclosure. I'm sure brass is soft enough to bend fairly easily (with a brake or something), but I also suspect it'll break easily too, kind of like aluminum.  I've thought about making an enclosure like this, then either brazing or epoxying four threaded standoffs in the corners and bolting on wood sides. It might just be easier to cut four pieces and braze them together, although I'd probably need to make some kind of fixture to hold the pieces in place for that."
OpenPV,3a9sie,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:14:24 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot of experience working with brass/copper, especially thick enough sheet to make an enclosure from. The tighter the radius of the bend, the more difficult. I suspect it would need a fair amount of annealing to get one done though.  Brass sheet is plenty expensive too.  Fixturing is going to be key to easily brazing 4 sides together neatly. Could probable even solder them, not sure how you'd deal with the joints"
OpenPV,3a9sie,Jerry_Rigg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I'm leaning towards brazing all four corners (if I even decided to build the project, that is.) Brass flat bar stock, 1""x 1/8"", isn't outrageously expensive, and I'd only need about 16"" at most. I'm think I can just cut two shorter lengths for the top and bottom, and two longer lengths for the sides. I've soldered copper before, so doing four corner joints shouldn't be a big deal and silver solder should be plenty strong enough for a box mod.  The bigger challenge would be figuring out how to get four standoffs in the inside corners to take bolts or magnets; I'd imagine I'd break the other solder joints if I tried to solder those too, so I might just have to settle for epoxy or something. I mean, I could probably make some kind of soldering jig with that white refractory brick stuff, the kind that's almost like a brick version of styrofoam. It's easy to work with regular hand tools and files.  I dunno, it's something I'll have to marinate in my noggin for a while. I've got most of the electronics parts for a couple more MOSFET mods, but I'd like to go outside of the typical Hammond box for one of them. To the metal supply websites, Batman!"

You can get sheet brass or copper pretty easily: most hobby stores carry it (I mean real hobby stores that cater to stuff like model railroads and RC, not places like HobbyLobby), but lots of online places too.) It's easy to cut with a pair of tin snips, which run about $18 at any hardware store. I'd probably make a pattern out of paper first, get that tweaked just right, then trace it onto your metal sheet.  Epoxy would probably work fine, as long as you prepped the metal well (scuff-sanding all the surfaces to be epoxied, then clean them really well before gluing it all together. I'd probably epoxy the sheet metal onto the main flat surface of the enclosure first and let that set up overnight, which will make bending the sides easier and keep things from sliding around on wet epoxy."

OpenPV,3a4koe,ScotyDoesKnow,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:29:06 2015 UTC,You would really have to look at a discharge curve. Batteries have different capacity ratings depending on discharge rate.
OpenPV,3a4koe,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"The batteries do have a lower usable capacity the more current you pull from them, this is well documented.  The reason for this in very simple terms is that the more current you pull, the more energy is wasted heating the battery itself. Read up on internal resistance if you want to learn all the details about this."
OpenPV,3a4koe,code-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"That's what I was looking for, that makes a lot of sense. So for the second question, will drawing 9A from a 10.5A max battery heat it up more than drawing 9A from a 14A max battery? Or is it just related to current draw regardless of the max?"
OpenPV,3a4koe,code-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say honestly. Most likely yes, but there's a lot of other variables. Are they of equal quality, are the amp limits accurate, is it just a pulse rating etc... Remember there's a lot of shenanigans out there when it comes to batteries, dishonest suppliers, counterfeits and the like.   Most of the popular batteries will have discharge graphs, either official or enthusiast made, so I think the best way to be sure is to Google each battery and compare the findings."
OpenPV,3a4koe,code-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"Got a new question, didn't really want to start a new thread on it since I have 4 on the front page right now. Here it says that I'm safe as long as I don't discharge below 2.5V, and the schematic I'm using has a zener diode for 5.6V (series, so 2.8V per battery) which will keep it safe. The schematic is for 18650s though, and I just want to make sure it's not different. Doing some searching, I've seen recommendations anywhere between 3V to 3.5V on where to stop. Do you know if I'll be lowering battery life by letting it drop to 2.8V?"
OpenPV,3a4koe,code-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:20:14 2015 UTC,"3V - 3.5V is a good rule of thumb when you're looking at resting voltage. The discharge voltage, in this case 2.5V, means this is the absolute minimum voltage under load, after a few minutes they'll bounce back up to a stable resting voltage around 3V - 3.5V depending on the battery.  If the battery is under 3V after resting a while it's most likely dead.  Have a look at this table too."
OpenPV,3a4koe,flegge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:36:29 2015 UTC,"Well the 5.6 (2.8) will cut it off based on both at rest and under load, so if my batteries are similar to that table it seems OK. If I did something that cut off at like 3.2 it would cut it off under load when the battery is actually something like 3.8 at rest, right?"
OpenPV,3a4koe,dfmckay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"Could be yeah, depends a lot on the battery. I haven't experimented much that low as my vapor production slows down way before I reach that level."
OpenPV,3a4koe,smokedjackrel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:45:25 2015 UTC,Another thing that happens with batteries is that your higher current loads have more of a voltage drop in the battery (due to internal resistances). This can make a battery that probably has half charge feel dead in mechs and DIY regulated devices. Hope this helps
OpenPV,3a4koe,smokedjackrel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:15:50 2015 UTC,For your given example they would last for the same amount of time because they both have the same mah (milli ampere hour). But batteries with higher mah will generally have a lower max amperage rating if they are the same type of battery.

I'm an electronics noob so I am trying to simulate this with LTSpice before ordering components that won't work or blowing stuff up. With an imported model of that other mosfet it LOOKS fine there.

I would imagine that if you just removed the fet from the circuit and replaced that with the sx chip it would work? The the switch in paralleled mode you should only have to use one battery in either slot on the sled. Then when you want to go series; pop that battery out and put a mated set in and flip the switch.   Edit: may have to flip the switch with no batteries in. I believe the sx may freak out if you flip that switch with batteries installed.
OpenPV,3a0eas,linuxbarista,0,Sat Jun 20 13:57:15 2015 UTC,No You would probably have to use two sleds. One for married batteries and one for unmarried batteries.  Hammond boxes come in all sizes. Here's a comparison tool that /u/advicevice made.  https://nonameboxmods.com/hect/hammond.html

OpenPV,39zycb,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:27:44 2015 UTC,I'm not! Also it seems I messed up my math...I was calculating for 240w given 12v and .6ohm.....which puts me at 20a not 30...  but 20 would still comfortably drive my RBA.
OpenPV,39zycb,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:35:48 2015 UTC,"You are in raptor 60 amp territory. You'll need a switching power supply and if you don't want to change power then you can just put a standard resistor on it rather than a potentiometer. The mast mini mod is just an OKR-T/10 passthrough box. You would be making a raptor passthrough box. it would be unsafe to run AC current directly to the atomizer without any power regulation. Would you like me to find you a diagram for a raptor passthrough box?  Edit: one additional question, what are you currently using to give you 240 watts?"

Given that it has become such a need in our household (going through a 2900mah charge every hour is unacceptable), I just think this would be a better route to go.

OpenPV,39zycb,Pathian,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:58:06 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be assembling the board yourself, but you would have to solder wires to it. A Raptor 60 amp box is no easy task. I know /u/pathian has done a least one of them.   Your other option would be to go for the 18.5 volt PWM route. They can be more complicated because you are assembling the ""board"" yourself, but I've heard good things. You would still need to use a switching power supply though.  I don't think you saw my edit. What are you currently using that gives you 240 watts? I just don't see it being a pleasurable experience. The highest that I've done is 200 watts and that was pushing it."
OpenPV,39zycb,Pathian,2,Tue Jun 16 07:07:53 2015 UTC,"Working from AC power directly probably won't give you a workable solution. Your wall plug (assuming you're in the United States) is pushing 120V on a breaker of 15A (in an older home) or 20A (in newer homes). To get to 240 watts on a direct passthrough, you'd need to build a 60 ohm coil.  That Amperage is for the entire room, so if you have anything else in that room running off the walls, you'll be even more limited. You need an AC to DC transformer laptop or PC power supply to downstep the voltage and increase the available current. For 240w to a .6 ohm coil, you need 12V at 20A, so you could probably just run it directly off the 12V rail from a PC power supply."

OpenPV,39zo9v,one_last_drink,2,Tue Jun 16 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"Efests aren't the best batteries but in parallel with a .5 ohm build (fully charged they'd be sharing a total draw of 8.4A) they should have no problem. The difference in fuse shouldn't affect voltage drop all that much. Throw it on a regulated box and see what wattage it works best at. With a 0.5 ohm build you're going to be pushing 35W with fully charged batteries, and it only goes down from there. Inputting your build to steam engine coil calculator at 35W it looks like it's gonna be a bit cooler vape with quite the ramp time. Looks like the build would work better closer to 40W."
OpenPV,39zo9v,one_last_drink,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:05:12 2015 UTC,I gotcha.  What should i do to make the coil more optimal to what the box can put out? Tighter twists?  A thinner wire with higher resistance per foot with less twists?
OpenPV,39zo9v,david4500,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:43:17 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of things you can do, but you need to experiment to see what works and what kind of builds you like. Taking a wrap out or using 6 wraps with a smaller diameter coil will lower the resistance making the box output more power, but the coil also won't be able to handle as much wattage as it could previously before being too hot. Using thinner wire at the same resistance will make it heat up quicker but it may be too hot of a vape for you so you may need a slightly higher resistance when using the thinner wire. Some people like a longer ramp up time then chucking a massive cloud once it has heated up. Some people like to have it heat up instantly and not have to pull for more than a second. So figure out what works best for you. Go forth and build!"

You can't even run a DNA30 at 30 without exceeding the amp limit.

I'm also assuming it'll be more expensive?  Was planning on doing something like in /u/Advicevice 's latest video.

OpenPV,39p1d9,Pathian,3,Sat Jun 13 14:26:49 2015 UTC,I just use Bob Smith 5 minute epoxy. It cures hard as a rock in 5 minutes.
OpenPV,39p1d9,scottiethegoonie,0,Sun Jun 14 02:15:21 2015 UTC,"Most quick-cure epoxies leave a lot to be desired, especially the fact that they often don't harden up as quickly as they say. If you've found one that does, great, although I'll point out that a lot of builders tend to go with ""off-the-shelf"" brands because they're more readily available. BSi is typically only found in hobby stores or online, so a lot of builders tend to grab something like Loctite, JB, Dev-Con, or other brands that are commonly found in hardware stores (or Walgreens, or my local grocery store, in the case of the Loctite stuff I just bought.)  For people who are having issues or want to speed up the process, I was offering solution.  FYI: most quick-cure epoxies don't actually cure in 5/15/30 minutes, they set up (despite what the flashy packaging claims in big letters): there's a difference in strength from when something sets up to when it's fully cured, and many ""quick cure"" epoxies still take anywhere from a few hours to 24 hours to actually cure. A lot of epoxy manufacturers use the terms ""harden"" and ""cure"" interchangeably on packaging, despite the fact that they mean very different things. I've noticed that a lot of quick-setting epoxies may ""harden"" enough to handle and hold things in place (mostly), but they're still somewhat flexible for quite a long time afterwards and parts can be accidentally broken loose when the epoxy is in this state. Again, I was offering a solution for people who are experiencing that kind of issue."

If your wanting like a wiring harness to solder into a box? I think www.nonameboxmods.com can do that for you. We use dual mosfets in a parallel box because the operating voltage can drop below the specs of the mosfet and can damage them if that makes sense.

It reminds me of his thread recently on the one pus one message boards. The oneplus one had some driver/firmware flaws that caused the touchscreen to not work for a lot of people. Oneplus insisted it was a software problem and people on the message boards pulled open their phones and said it was an insulation problem based on,, basically guessing. So after that dozens of people pulled their phones apart and put in insulating tapes, they called oneplus liars(and voided their warranties) and reported their problems were solved, for about a day. but it became this strange circle jerk anyways, people kept pulling their phones apart even though the fix didnt work. In the end oneplus released a patch and the problem disappeared. Its the same here, people exclaim that its built poorly and shorting out when its not and then they are pulling their boxes apart for no real reason. Sometimes when you make thousands of a thing some of them are just wrong, but there isn't a design flaw and you shouldn't pull your mod apart for any reason. return it to the vendor instead if you suspect something is wrong.   here is that thread http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one/general/fixing-ghost-touch-grounding-issue-hint-t2951000  I love the title.

If I just went custom, I would probably build a custom wood box and would need everything so I don't have to spend any more money after that. I need an ohm reader built in, I need  to be able to run parallel or series, led button (blue and I want ohm reader led to be blue as well).

OpenPV,39dzsj,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:53:37 2015 UTC,"It's a mech box with a bad design. There's not going to be a lot that you can do with it because mech boxes are milled with very little extra space in an effort to reduce the size of the box. Since it's running a hot positive post any connection to the outside of the atomizer will fire it. Your best bet would be to either sell it or get a non conductive cap for your atomizer such as glass, delrin, etc.   When you do get enough money and decide to pull the trigger on a custom box you'll want to look up mamu's method of using an eleaf ohmmeter in a box. Make a post on here if you decide to go that route and I'll see if I can throw together a wiring diagram for you."

OpenPV,3991qq,Ravnikar610,4,Wed Jun 10 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"Of the well tested options that are out there. There's the DNA40, and the SX350J. The DNA40 tops out at 40w and has a smaller form factor, has wire through holes for the fire and adjust buttons and comes with a USB charging board.  The SX350j tops out at 120w in wattage mode, but requires series batteries to do so. On a single battery it can run up to 60w. No USB charging here though. It requires a rather bulky balance charging board to charge series batteries (not USB). You can buy a USB charging board separately if you want to hack in USB charging for a single battery though. The board itself is on the large side, and the buttons for adjust and power are small tactile buttons soldered directly to the board, so it's a bit limiting as far as button and wiring options go."

I did all the work by hand, sanded the case down adding the bevel and 45 degree edging on the lid. Added the magnets and routed out the inner screw channels for more space. I don't have a drill press so I mangled the counter sink on the FDV 510 grinding it down with a dremel.   The first Dna40 chip I received I either fried or was DOA.. I got in touch with their customer service and they RMA'd the unit within a week and have had no problems with this one.

OpenPV,396woo,ConcernedKitty,2,Tue Jun 9 19:14:20 2015 UTC,That may be the best option. Trying to pull 132 watts directly out of a cigarette lighter probably isn't going to work extremely well.

OpenPV,396woo,ConcernedKitty,2,Tue Jun 9 18:59:38 2015 UTC,It just depends on what you want. If a laptop power supply will do it then that's great. I like to use 12V switching power supplies for raptors. Here's an example of one that I did with a switching power supply http://imgur.com/a/dWPW5

OpenPV,393wxi,sctoor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:50:16 2015 UTC,"Your videos are extremely helpful, thanks. One question -- in another video you said the 3-position switch does not cut all power to the box, and instead is just a lock switch. Why do you usually do that instead of a full power off switch (or is that just impossible)?  Thanks for doing a build with the OKR and all the safety features (P-FET, Zener diode, fuses). People seem to think once you have that OKR in there all the other safety is optional."
OpenPV,393wxi,untss,2,Tue Jun 9 12:14:54 2015 UTC,"One question -- in another video you said the 3-position switch does not cut all power to the box, and instead is just a lock switch. Why do you usually do that instead of a full power off switch (or is that just impossible)?   Mainly because any switch that would be able to handle the current would be gigantic and never fit in the box, and switches rated for that much are usually priced proportionately to the amount they can handle."
OpenPV,393wxi,Pathian,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:53:20 2015 UTC,"As /u/advicevice said, a switch to actually interrupt the load path would be impractically large. Most ""lock"" switches for regulators only interrupt the remote on/off circuit, which is sufficient to keep them from full firing accidentally, but doesn't shut off the chip's idle drain current because it still have a complete path from input voltage to ground. For chips up to the 20A raptor and below, the idle drain is inconsequential, but for more powerful chips like the 40, 60 and 80A boards, it's popular to put an N-channel mosfet into the circuit to interrupt the path to ground and shut off the idle drain when not firing."
OpenPV,393wxi,untss,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:35:04 2015 UTC,thanks guys. do you know how I would go about using an n-channel mosfet in place of the p-fet /u/advicevice  uses in this video? I was going to make this box tomorrow and don't want to wait for a p-fet lol

OpenPV,3930cx,vasyabrick,2,Mon Jun 8 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"Easiest way is to check for DNA40 genuine message... The clones have not cloned this behavior, to my knowledge. Scroll down to 1.0w and continue to hold the down button. It should show a message that says ""Geniune"" followed by the DNA40's serial number.  Also, in my experience with the clones (Kangxin only, unfortunately), the battery cover threads were not timed, so the coin slots didn't line up perfectly when the battery covers were screwed in all the way. Both of my authentic flasks have perfectly timed threads down there. YMMV on this, however, as from the pictures I've seen, it seems that the Waidea flask does have timed threads."
OpenPV,3930cx,BillShatnerFace,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"There was one at a local pawn shop. $45. Worn in- someone enjoyed it. What I noticed:   Genuine Evolv board.  No delay when firing. Spring loaded stainless 510. Has the same connector as a VF 2.1. Nut on backside.  Battery threads match up. Aluminum buttons. Easy to spot- no amount of painting, chroming, plastic molding or 3D printing duplicates a machined aluminum button. Because if it was a true aluminum, nickle, brass or stainless button, no one would have a reason to paint or chrome it.  Tight fitting USB.  In a box with a card that had the vaporflask.com website referenced for product support. Only my VTC5's fit in it.    So I bought it. It's what I wanted- a genuine- but it's really sad that Chinese clones dictated the value of a US made one that was designed and assembled by US workers. And the sheep wonder why there isn't a manufacturing base and a middle class in the US anymore."
OpenPV,3930cx,Tony_Desolate,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:48:02 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a lot about these so called Evolv builds of clone Vapor Flasks, however I have been able to find only 3 documented builds. I would believe that if these people have talked about it online, they would be posting on it. This tells me:   They were all internet talk and lacked real world walk when they realized that a. they lacked the ability, initiative or skill b. they feared getting machine oil on their hands. Or epoxy or flux. Or all kinds of ""nasty"" things that someone could possibly get on their hands by picking up a tool. Poor documentation of builds- because they are not pretty. I can understand why. This is a massive PITA to do if you want it work correctly and last. It requires some planning - and you do that once you have it blown apart and have the DNA 40 board on hand. No one can spoon feed you through that. There is no one at Autozone that can do this for you.     I have an Infinite Vapor Flask that I purchased several months ago. In all these Vapor Flask clone DNA posts- I suppose I got the holy grail of what Fastteck shoppers dreamed of - a shell, buttons, battery caps and a skid for $25. It came in the form of a  DOA Infinite Vapor Flask. Complete with the sled. Everything needed to  convert it to a DNA40 without much expense.   Except one problem. Someone tried to do that. And they failed.   After disassembling it, I can understand exactly why they failed. They failed because they had no clue as to what they were doing, or the basic skillset to do it.  I figured that since I had the basic parts (the sled, shell, 510 connector, screws, battery caps) it would be an easy go. However the thing was so butchered that I was about to write it off.    The 510 pin was dead grounded to the chassis. It was  that way because someone decided they knew more than the engineers who built it and had a 1/4 of bare wire sticking out of  the bottom of the 510. The top of the board- with the power and ground leads soldered to it were making a direct contact with  the chassis. The Infinite does have a 1Amp charging board- known as ""Rapid Charging"" in the VaporShark DNA world. However this board had been ruined because the soldering pads were burned off of it.    I also just picked up a genuine Vapor Flask in a pawn shop for $45- and it works flawlessly. However it looks pretty rough, so I figured I  would clean it up. I also decided since I had the genuine apart, I would revisit the Infinite clone and see if I could salvage it also.   As it turns out, it's bad , but not so bad that I can't rebuild it. The Infinite one looked beat up also- so I stripped both down to bare  aluminum with oven cleaner.   Here's the two dissected. Genuine on the left, Infinite on the right.  http://i.imgur.com/GARJJ4F.jpg  The Infinite does have some advantages:   Thicker hardware mounting sled. Note that my genuine one is broke at the battery tops- I didn't do this. However some Locktite Gel superglue will fix this. Both the genuine and the Infinite are manufactured with billet aluminum bodies, however the Infinite has a bead blasted texture. It wouldn't be as easy to mirror polish, but I am not looking for a mirror polish finish. A 400 grit 3M scotch brite cleans it up nice and it will not show oxidation and discoloration as easy as a bare smooth aluminum finish will over time.   Any battery I have will fit in it.  A common precision Phillips screwdriver can be used to remove the 4 screws on the top. The genuine one requires a 1.3 mm hex bit. 1.3 mm. Hex bit. Metric. Not a Torx. Not a .050. You will fuck them up if you use anything else other than a 1.3 mm hex bit.    Advantages of a Genuine:   The USB connection is more flush and does not move around. I found this surprising as the Infinite's mounting sled is thicker and fits all the way down into the bottom of the chassis. However, what I discovered is that the Infinite's sled is of a softer plastic. Vaporflask uses a 6 pin right angle connector soldered into the rear of the DNA board - these are the switch connections. It's a very clean, tidy connection setup. THAT is how the genuine's DNA40 fits so nicely.    I have started refitting the clone with another DNA 40 however some work is involved- more than usual since it's already been butchered.  First off get the old board out. Do not use brute force. It's soldered into a board directly below it and you may break off the contacts to the up and down buttons.   So here's what I have done:   Fix the charging board and solder the wires. The original Infinite charging board would have been ideal to use, as it is a 1 Amp. The wires would need to be lengthened as the DNA40's power connection points are at the top.   Since it was ruined and I couldn't find another (it's a 2 wire board ,  stamped SX1A, so it's a Yihi or Kangxix), I purchased an Evolv 1A to replace it. The board is the same width, but the board is thicker.   To fit it, I filed out the sled with some 60 grit sandpaper glued to a fingernail file. I also thinned it out quite a bit so I epoxied some styrene plastic strips to the top and bottom ofthe sled.   Not only does the 1A Evolv fit perfectly, it also addresses the issue of the poor fitting usb connection on the Infinite. The usb connection is dead center and With a usb cable connected it doesn't move at all.    Wire the buttons. In the clone there are two boards- the microprocessor (on top) and directly below it is a board for the up and down buttons. It eats up a lot of height and causes trouble with getting the DNA40 to sit flush in the chassis. It was also butchered as someone tried to solder onto a laminated PCB. I unsoldered itand removed it.   This leaves 8 pins protruding, 4 for each switch. I soldered 28 gauge wire to two pins on each switch. This is where you will need a multimeter to determine which pair of contacts are normally open and normally closed.   After I finished this I sealed it in JB Weld quick epoxy and filed it down. The DNA40 will sit over part of this area, however there is no electrical contacts exposed form the switches.   Power leads to the battery. That button board also ties the two battery positive leads together. Since I cannot use it, I have to tie them in myself. Unsolder the leads from the battery terminals and pull the brass contacts out of the sled. Clean up the holes, press the contacts back into the sled, and solder in 18/20 gauge red wire (Yes, red. It's positive. Have some pride and attention to detail and follow traditional electrical color coding). Keep them about 6 inches long. I'll tell you why later.  Rebuilt the Infinite 510 connector using the original Infinite stainless steel 510 body andd the pin. With the exception of the pin and the body, you can use all the parts from a Varitube spring loaded 510 to rebuild the Infinite's 510. Even the Varitube's spring will fit and is a better design than the Infinite.     I also decided to add a 1 Amp Evolv rapid charger to the genuine Vapor Flask while I have it apart. It's also thicker than the 500ma Evolv board that is fitted to all genuine Vapor Flasks. I used the same approach as I did putting this board in the clone. I filed out the slot in the sled and braced up the top and bottom of the sled with some styrene epoxied to the sled.   I am not rushing this build. I have a life. Given the butchery done to the Infinite, I would rather work a little at a time and walk away away from it before continuing. By doing that it also gives me some time to look at it carefully at each step, before moving on."

If you're using something Like a DNA 30 or yihi sx350 then you are better off taking advantage of the increased battery life and near double current rating by using them in parallel as series won't give many benefits in this scenario. However if you're using some other means to regulate the device then double the voltage may suit you better than double the battery life. It all comes down to you really, and what you plan to use as double the voltage and 45a may be better than double the battery life and 70amps (to be safe) in some cases.

OpenPV,38sdtf,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is just a suggestion, but on a super sub ohm build you're going to pull your batteries too low and fry your mosfets because of battery sag. You would be better off building series batteries."
OpenPV,38sdtf,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:26:39 2015 UTC,"i read around and heard that series puts more stress on one battery than the other. The coils I like to build end up around 0.2-0.3 ohms, a series at 7.4v with a 0.2coil would be 273 watts o_O, I dont want to vape and die."
OpenPV,38sdtf,jiggyniggie,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:51:44 2015 UTC,Ah. You sub ohm. Super sub ohm is generally below 0.1
OpenPV,38sdtf,StonedShrubbery,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"It actually puts less stress on your batteries for wattage equivalent builds.  A series box pushes out 4 times the wattage as a parallel box with the same build on it, so if you normally vape at a .2 ohm build on a parallel then you would get the same hit on a series box with a .8 ohm build.  Of course, I usually build it to be 3 times as high instead of 4 and I'm never disappointed.  I usually go with a .4 or so on my series box.  But, in your case, a .8 on a series box will give you the same wattage as a .2 on your mech but you will be pulling less current from your batteries so it's actually safer for your batteries watt-for-watt."
OpenPV,38sdtf,dalelovelace,-1,Wed Jun 10 06:55:38 2015 UTC,Parallel gives you 8.4 volts on fully charged batteries. Series gives you 4.2 volts with double the battery life.

OpenPV,38fwjc,shanman70,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:12:39 2015 UTC,i may be wrong but I cant see the drain hooked up to your 510 nut.   If it is hooked up then take a volt meter and hook it to the nut of the 510 and the pos  of the volt meter to  the 510 pos and press button. If you get a reading then you probably not getting a connection from 510 to you rda

OpenPV,38ewft,jeffcoan,5,Wed Jun 3 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"why? because of the history... mech mods were started as modified flashlights, these were based on 18650 batteries.  as time goes on, we now have regulated mods, box mods, etc.  lipo is likely the next evolution, but it takes time to convert people over... same reason windows still has a cmd prompt.. for people that are used to it, its comfortable, they dont want to learn something new, just use the tool the same way they have been that is working for them.    also, the sheer volume of gear that we rely on, chargers, batteries,  etc.  all based on 18650 form factor.  As an example, it will be hard to get me to convert as I already own a handful of mech mods, and chargers and batteries.  IF a battery dies, I wont switch, becuase I would have to get a new charger, and new mods.  if a charger dies, its cheaper to get the same form factor that to switch over everything I own.    It usually takes something very disruptive and revolutionary to really change an industries direction."
OpenPV,38ewft,vigg-o-rama,5,Wed Jun 3 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"History is one reason, but the main reason that I like 18650s better is battery chemistry and the effect on the failure mode. Lipos can swell and explode in a pretty violent fashion."
OpenPV,38ewft,ConcernedKitty,4,Wed Jun 3 20:13:43 2015 UTC,Replaceability and external charging. I just don't want to be tethered to a USB port. So if someone makes safe chemistry and replaceable lip packs I'd be in.

OpenPV,38ewft,vigg-o-rama,2,Wed Jun 3 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Can someone post a video or two of a lipo powered device blowing up in mid flight? I've watched a couple dozen videos so far and the only time I've seen something resembling an explosion is when they gave it 12+V DC or they beat the shit out of it until it started smoking and then it went boom. The few in-flight failures I saw were labeled explosions but they just started smoking and caught on fire.   So for kicks and giggles I'm going to take a 2200mah 20C cell, a Hammond 1590g, drill a hole for each lead, run a length of 16G teflon solid silver core hookup wire, short it, and run like hell and see what the aftermath is.  I'm curious to see how much force the die-cast aluminum can take if it's unmolested vs milled and drilled.  If I survive I'll re-run the experiment with a retired sx350 in a 1590g and see how well the venting works that I've been using."
OpenPV,38ewft,mlkmaydn,2,Wed Jun 3 22:47:51 2015 UTC,Shorts are handled pretty well by lipos. They tend to look like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkAnHqHnpQ  Not very exciting. Sometimes they vent a white smoke.  The majority of RC fires from lipos are when they get damaged by a crash. That's why the spectacular videos are people crushing the cells. That and overcharging are what you will end up seeing; not being dead shorted.

OpenPV,38ewft,XxInViZxX,2,Thu Jun 4 13:45:50 2015 UTC,"as to your edited question...     I bought some Sony VTC5's a year ago in May.  I have discharged them on average 1.5X a day for the year.  I just picked up a xtar VC2, that shows you how much mah that it is putting back into your battery, they still take and hold a full charge.  (it shows adding ~2000mah when I had drained them down to about 3.2)   I think you must have had bad luck.    Granted, I was recharging WAY before a full ""Cycle"" I never let them get below 3.6ish as I use mech mods, and the difference between 4.2 and 3.6 is night and day.. so I tended to keep them in really good condition, recharge them right away, and pretty much never leave them fully charged either.  That is, from what I understand, the way these cells want to be treated.  (not fully charged or discharged for any length of time, and not deep cycling them over and over).    Now that I am on a regulated mod, I find that I do tend to run the down to 3.3 or 3.2, and I fully expect this will have an affect on the rest of their life, but hey, I've already recharged them some 500 times, and I am quite happy with their longevity."

OpenPV,38fsf9,Eizooz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"its wired in reverse, which shouldn't matter at all.  the only safety concern in boxes like this is gauge of wires and button tolerance. If the button has a low amp tolerance, it could theoretically heat up and fuse to itself, causing it to continually fire. The gauge should be fine it looks like 18 or 16. The main problem with those mods is that they're mass produced form china and are generally shitty."
OpenPV,38cxo1,elitegunslinger,2,Wed Jun 3 12:20:34 2015 UTC,What do you mean by longest threaded? It's got more to do with how flush the center pin is to the 510.

OpenPV,38chvy,JoFL0,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:01:45 2015 UTC,I haven't done a lipo sx build but recommended lipo low voltage cutoff is 3.2v. That's where all my rc stuff was programmed to cut at. Some 18650s are rated to 2.5v or 2.8v discharge but I don't drop mine below 3.6 because they start to sag under load badly at that charge level. But I wouldn't see any issue as the yihi chips already are. It's the same as the DNA40. And Hana and vaporshark have been selling lipo versions for a while.
OpenPV,38chvy,Small_white_clock,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:14:44 2015 UTC,Interesting. Well I've still had customers kill over a dozen lipo packs because they forgot to get their mods on the charger in enough time. Which makes it hard to sell a product to anyone that isn't a hobbyist with a decent understanding of batteries.   To me that's not acceptable.  I have also had this happen with a few authentic Dna40 chips.  Maybe Hobbykings lipo cells are trash? They are the only vendor I've used.  I might go nuclear and decompile the logo editor Yihi has and take a stab at the image myself then.  Edit: fat finger
OpenPV,38chvy,Pathian,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"Strange. I generally only buy lipos from HK and I've never had a customer issue. I've even had some drain down to 3.0 before (I don't use the sx350 anymore) and they were recoverable. Good luck with trying to get into the firmware, but I wouldn't be too optimistic. If a simple decompile was enough to make the operational values editable, I suspect we would have seen someone release a custom higher wattage firmware. For voltage cutout, it wouldn't surprise me if it was a combination of hardware and software that determines the value."
OpenPV,38chvy,Pathian,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I wasn't very clear. If you discharge down to 3.2v and wait say a week before you recharge your cells, the cells will still self discharge and depending on how long you've waited, there's a significant chance the cells have discharged below the threshold of the charging circuit.   And yeah that does make sense that it could be hardware. Only one way to find out.   Have you seen or heard of anyone trying to modify the firmware?"
OpenPV,38b0ue,Ohnoho,3,Wed Jun 3 01:26:14 2015 UTC,"The 1590B and G's seem to be the most popular. Anything around that size is fair game though!  :) (Truthfully, I've started looking at other styles of enclosures)  As far as switches, modders here need more info on the switches than you provide.

There is a hole in the market for a box right between the b and g. It would be the perfect size for most anything.   As far as  switches go, on the outside of the box it's usually a momentary switch that controls either a digital board or a mosfet. A high current momentary switch with low loss would be great(30 amps or more at 4.2 to 8.4 volts).   Slide switches are sometimes used to disable the mod or switch the batteries from a series to parallel configuration. Again, a true low profile high current switch that would enable modders to use them as an actual master off switch would be great but I don't think such an animal exists in the required size.   Most of the pots used here are smaller than your average audio pot and are usually 200-250 ohms.  One thing that I looked for but never had any luck finding was a pot that either had a place for a button in the middle or was a momentary pushbutton as well."

Can't comment on their customer service since I've never had an issue to call or email them about in the course of 30+ orders. Shipping is same day if I order early enough in the day, or the next day, but it feels like it sometimes gets a little flaky if I order late on a Friday or on a Saturday. Shipping prices are what I'd expect, component prices I can't really speculate much on since I don't have any other point of reference. 1590Gs are the most popular by far (which you already appear to have a very competitive price on), followed by the 1590Bs. Of the enclosures that you don't already have on your site, the ones that are somewhat popular off the top of my head are the 1590N1 and 1590BS for larger builds, and the 1550P for more compact builds. There's also a growing demand for CNC machined boxes, specifically in the ""G"" profile. Alpinetech makes a good one. If you're looking for an item to carry that's been pretty hot for modders lately, I'd look at the MSW-1201 and MSW-1202. They're pushbutton switches from a company called Mitec in Hong Kong. Neither Mouser nor Digikey stocks them. They're a pain to get for individuals because of the MOQs for price breaks. $6 a piece for orders under 100 pieces, $4.30 for 100+ in addition to about $55 shipping, don't know if there's another break beyond that.

There are 4 screw post taking up valuable real estate when all you need is enough flat surface area to mount a magnet to.  They are injection molded I believe, from a design perspective they aren't the best option because using molds to make them, they cannot have a square box.  Sharp corners wouldn't release from the molds so the walls going up from the back that extend to the opening for the door are all on an angle.  If you stand the box up it tends to want to lean towards that angle.  This obviously creates stability issues.  The only way to reproduce Hammond like boxes is cnc and at a decent size order, more than any one builder here would ever order, your looking at $80 a box.  If you can reproduce the Hammond box squared up and altered to save modders from a few of the standard modifications needed to use the box and door and not drive up the cost (19? ) you will be set.      One other issue is the edge that runs around the underside of the door is a major short hazard.  This needs to be addressed as well.

Plus I am already volunteered for building two more for ADK - a larger one for the road and another for the shop.  I also thought about your 1/4"" phono idea.  If going that route I would be very careful about resistance in the line.  My first incarnation our bar setup used 20ga wire from the board to the 510 connector.  The drop was so significant that the atties were reading about .7ohms higher then they actually were (a pretty major issue when a .5ohm coil reads 1.3)  I had to rewire the hoses with 16ga in order to eliminate this."
OpenPV,385vft,Irishhavoc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:43:21 2015 UTC,"An 850w PC power supply should put enough amperage over the 12v rails to do what you need. The hardest part would be wiring up the outputs. The most labor intensive bit would be rigging up multiple chipsets for individual heads. If you can find 50w pass thru boxes that'll take a 12v input for a decent price, or someone that's OK with doing a LOT of soldering it could be done for a pretty decent price."

OpenPV,384j2c,zeroflow,3,Mon Jun 1 20:17:49 2015 UTC,Excellent prototype!   Low battery cut off should be the very next thing you implement.  I can't wait to see this come along.
OpenPV,384j2c,dreamsforgotten,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:43:28 2015 UTC,Since this has such wide range of batteries that can be used (2s-4s) how would that be accomplished?
OpenPV,384j2c,standrew10,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:47:58 2015 UTC,I imagine by using a different zener diode depending on the battery setup you choose.
OpenPV,384j2c,dreamsforgotten,2,Thu Jun 4 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"If the low voltage cutoff is implemented with the ATTiny84, you could just measure the voltage, then determine how many cells you have in your mod, then adjust the cutoff in consequence."
OpenPV,384j2c,Vinzgore,2,Fri Jun 5 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"Correct! And also, the ATTiny's have a very low quiescent current when put into sleep - so it wont be a problem that the chip is still active.  The pins are laid out in a way that the fire button goes to an PCINT Pin, which means i can put it into power-down mode and let it sleep until the button gets pressed.  Also, the full series battery voltage gets measured, but it would also be supported to connect the middle of the series connection to another ADC to recognize unmarried batteries and cut power if one of the batteries drops below 3.2V"
OpenPV,384j2c,Vinzgore,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"I’ve used quite a few ATTiny chips, and they rock, especially when you need to run for a long time on a small battery pack.

OpenPV,384j2c,Vinzgore,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:03:51 2015 UTC,"The only thing needed for more than 3s would be another pair of 0805 resistors since the currently used divider is set up for up to 12V (100k and 68k gives you a range of 0-12V measurable as 0-5V)  Also, on higher voltages, you would have to take a look at the LDO since it may get warm at higher voltages. All in all that shouldnt be a problem since the chip doesnt consume that much current."

I was pretty much just looking to see if there was something I was missing since this seemed like a brilliantly simple idea for the purpose and didn't know if it had been attempted/failed.

OpenPV,37x5e7,thrwbak,1 point,Sun May 31 14:33:25 2015 UTC,You dont need the fuses. The board already has reverse polarity protection and under and over voltage protection. If you read the specs closley its in there. You may get piece of mind by installing them and thats ok but it takes up room and makes things more complicated. You need to install them on positive side before the zener if being used but thats not needed either.

If you simply tin the wire or heat only the solder and wire, you'll end up with a ""dry"" (bad) solder joint. They can not only have reduced conductivity but come off on their own (faster than you'd expect). If you iron doesn't get hot enough, or takes too long to heat, I'd recommend an iron rated at 30W - 35W. And of course, as stated above, use pliers or helping hands to hold it for you."

OpenPV,37h3z4,ConcernedKitty,3,Fri May 29 06:30:21 2015 UTC,Sterling (.925 purity) is not what you want. It has a lower IACS rating (96%) than pure copper (100%). What you want is .999 fineness silver (IACS 105%ish). I use dead soft without issue.

OpenPV,37fkcg,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Wed May 27 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"I guess the big thing that I'm having trouble grasping is how the timer works. Is it programmed in C like a pic chip? When you adjust your pot I believe that it changes the duty cycle, but what (programming, natural function, etc) is telling it that a different resistance means a higher or lower duty cycle? Please correct me if I'm wrong here. Electronics are still black magic to MEs."
OpenPV,37fkcg,scottiethegoonie,2,Wed May 27 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha. There's no programming to be done in the conventional sense. You're correct in that adjusting the potentiometer changes the duty cycle. You can think of the potentiometer as two separate resistors connected at the wiper. The dioes in opposite directions make it so that current will flow through one of these resistors during a charge cycle, and the opposite resistor during a discharge cycle. The value of each of these resistors affects the current flow which determines how fast the timer can fully charge or discharge. It's this charge/discharge ratio that controls the duty cycle. Does that make sense?"

It's basically a G box (slightly larger by a couple mm on each side), but milled from billet aluminum instead of cast. It's also got cool ""hidden"" magnet divots, rather than screw holes.  Whether or not it'll fit a T10 I have no idea, but you might try contacting the seller and see if they'll take the inside measurements for you. Like I said before, it's slightly larger than a 1590G on the outside, but I'm not sure if the inside is any bigger. Still, at under $20 for what appears to be a very nicely milled box, it might be worth a shot anyway; worse comes to worse, you've got a really nice box for a MOSFET mod.  EDIT: derp, the measurements are posted right in the eBay listing. That's what I get for not scrolling down ;) . Here they are:   Inner dimensions: 99.2mm x 48.2mm x 23mm. Outside dimensions: 103mm x 52mm x 27mm   Just for reference, a quick and dirty measure of the 1590G MOSFET mod in my hand has internal dimensions of 96mm x 47mm x 19mm (note that the width and height were measured at the opening, which is slightly larger due to the infamous ""Hammond slant"". As far as I can tell, the box on eBay has square-milled internal dimensions, so you're looking at a healthy 3mm+ of additional space in each dimension over the 1590G.)"

OpenPV,37d9ak,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Tue May 26 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that you're talking about the glowy one that I posted?  If you're using the 12 volt rail your chip efficiency should be around 95%, but I'll use 90% just in case. The Raptor 20a is a 120 watt chip. At 90% efficiency you're looking at 132 watts per chip. This power supply can give you 744 watts at 12 volts. You can run 5 (5.6 is more exact) raptor 120 watt chips simultaneously without any issue. You can put as many chips as you want on the power supply, but you can only run 5 at full power at the same time. The power supply will adjust itself to give the power demanded from it.   TLDR: You can run 5 at the same time with that power supply."

OpenPV,37d9ak,zeroflow,1 point,Tue May 26 20:32:43 2015 UTC,No problem. The only issue that I see is that you don't have nice labeled outputs with that supply. You'll have to look up which plugs to use. It will probably be a 4 pin connector.
OpenPV,37d9ak,zeroflow,1 point,Tue May 26 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"Based on the pure specs of the 12V rail: Yes  Should you use it as a power supply: NO!  SMPS supplies need some basic load on the 5V rail to stay stable. Please check this page and get the supply of your choice.  http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?pv183=7547&FV=fff40009%2Cfff80229%2C15c0002%2C17d4002c&k=%22Power+Supplies+-+%22&mnonly=0&newproducts=0&ColumnSort=0&page=1&quantity=0&ptm=0&fid=0&pageSize=25  This is filtered for single output 12V supplies in an enclosed frame. These supplies work like a charm and are better to build with than if you need to cut/solder cables for an ATX Power supply.  The discussion of using ATX PSUs as any kind of bench supply or so often comes up in /r/electronics - but its simply not worth the hassle. Yes, you may be able to save a few bucks, but in the end, a normal AC to DC PSU is your better bet. It makes no fuzz, cables are easier to mount and it saves your sanity and your time budget."

OpenPV,37akgz,xProdigies,3,Tue May 26 05:05:24 2015 UTC,All of the buttons etc can use much thinner wire - they are at very low current.  18 gauge should be able to run 10A at 12V (this is from memory) so if you expect to be pulling more than 10A you may want thicker for the 510 and battery cables...  I think the max output from the 350 is 9.5V and 12.5A so I think you may be pretty close to the cable ratings...  I think mine has 16AWG for the 510 connector and 16 or possibly 18 for the battery sled? It came prewired though so I'm not certain.
OpenPV,37akgz,nikniuq,1 point,Tue May 26 07:05:36 2015 UTC,Okay thank you!
OpenPV,37akgz,ConcernedKitty,2,Tue May 26 12:52:34 2015 UTC,Here you go. http://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm  For this application 18 gauge should be fine. 16 gauge would be safer. Remember that you're not running this at 100% continuously and you are using short lengths of wire so these ratings are probably a bit lower than they need to be.

So a nice 1 Ohm build sounds like it would work perfect. I wouldnt try to make my mod plug into it, i would just make one dedicated to it. If you wanted to go with the 5v rail you could, but i like high voltage vaping. You could also put in a PWM board, and be able to dial the 12v rail back some at the mod.

Let's say in a 1590G.  That's about the smallest box such a mod can be built in (without significant modification to the box itself), yet there's still a good amount of wasted internal space.  Because we're limited by the size and shape of 18650 batteries.

I started my CNC adventures with a Carbide3D Nomad883. Then went to Tormach in January for a 4 day Intro to Machining class and was able to purchase the 770 in April. Still terrified of the fly cutter and seeing small end mills spinning at 10,000 RPM's ... really need to get the full enclosure when the budget allows."
OpenPV,370x2m,Tony_Desolate,1 point,Sat May 23 23:16:41 2015 UTC,I was thinking more of a shapeoko desing since is only a hobby for me and would you be willing to share your design ?
OpenPV,370x2m,Tony_Desolate,1 point,Sat May 23 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"flycutters in general are sketchy to me.... Can you not put a small indexable endmill in there (like a 1"")? Whenever i use a flycutter those set screws get tightened extra tight haha.  Edit: Quick question, how do you intend to hold that for the backside? Looks intense."
OpenPV,370x2m,Tony_Desolate,1 point,Sun May 24 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't bought any indexable tooling yet. Planning on picking some up when the budget allows. We used the flycutter a lot at the tormach classes, they seem to work quite well but they're still scary.  Biggest end mills I have right now are some carbide 1/2"" 3 flute high helix ones from Maritool ... a rougher and a finisher.  I was basically running aluminum speeds and feeds so I just threw some slightly taller soft jaws, monsterjaws 5.2""x2""x1"", in the vise to try and mill the back. At least I wouldn't hit the vise or the steel jaws that way.  Unfortunately that M3 lava stuff is quite brittle and I cracked the work piece. Wasn't really planning on any type of production of these but it has me re-thinking the CAM and how to successfully produce the part.   I had that M3 stuff sitting around for quite a while but it still sucked to break it because it cost $35."
OpenPV,370x2m,Tony_Desolate,2,Mon May 25 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"If youre ever back in the market for endmills, ive heard VERY good things about destiny tools out of CA. They make a 6 tooth, 3 flute endmill. So you can feed the hell out of it in the softer stuff. Its pretty rad.   I have been machining for about 7 years, and this part looks VERY hard to produce quickly. I think I would get creative with a subplate and utilizing those 4 corner screw holes to hold the work piece for the 2nd side. This is probably the way I would try to do this part: 1-Mill the face side like you did, roughing out the entire block to the outer part shape. 2-flip the part, and mill it in a vice.   just like you did.  the problem i see being a big pain is getting the part to actually lay flat, and not get warped/crack/break when clamping.   I think you could redesign this a little bit and save yourself a lot of cycle time, but what fun is that!   also something to remember about machinist vices (at least the kurts we use at work) it takes next to no pressure to hold a securely. Even with a 2"" facemill running 30+ipm, 2000+RPM, and over .1"" in 1018 steel..  goodluck with this man, the designs look awesome."
OpenPV,370x2m,Jerry_Rigg,1 point,Tue May 26 02:32:25 2015 UTC,"Good advice, thanks!  Destiny tool seems to have a lot of good buzz lately. I'll have to see if I can find a distributor that deals with small time hobbyists. I've mainly been getting stuff from Maritool, Lakeshore Carbide and Tormach.  It's my fault that the piece broke, it was in the vise fine but since I'm new at a lot of this I've been over-tightening everything. I'll try it again with a different approach and some less expensive material."
OpenPV,370x2m,Jerry_Rigg,2,Tue May 26 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"Man, i understand. I run all 1018 steel at work.. so when we get aluminum parts, I have to force myself to be very gentle.

OpenPV,370tlg,david4500,1 point,Sat May 23 20:40:33 2015 UTC,Do you happen to know where to get the metal caps and perhaps a tactile switch without its own cap? All i've found is plastic caps/ plastic capped tactile switches.
OpenPV,370tlg,david4500,1 point,Sat May 23 20:45:33 2015 UTC,There are probably some caps for DNA or SX mods on Shapeways. Digikey or Mouser should have some 6x6 tacts with short actuators. A few I had laying around http://i.imgur.com/TkVTxeY.png sorry I don't have a part# or link handy
OpenPV,370tlg,david4500,1 point,Sat May 23 20:53:12 2015 UTC,So I could get one like that and then place a button between the actuator on the tact and the housing of the mod?
OpenPV,370tlg,geekvape,1 point,Sun May 24 01:20:40 2015 UTC,You certainly could with the right combination and as long as you have a way to secure the switches in place.

OpenPV,36vpcl,abdada,2,Fri May 22 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"Battery life, as always, depends on how high you turn it up and what build is on it.  And no, I don't recommend ever doing high drain discharge while charging for ANY battery. It puts an unnecessary amount of stress on the cells and can damage the battery. As it's a LiPo connector though, it can be used for passthrough without a battery, provided that your voltage source can also use an XT60 connector. I have a 12V car plug with an XT60 on it for that purpose."

OpenPV,36mmsf,The_Goss,6,Wed May 20 14:28:34 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a more organized link flair area. A lot of people ask a lot of the same questions and it's hard to tell them to look at the sidebar when I have trouble finding something myself. These questions usually include questions about mosfets, wiring diagrams, and specific chips. In your words, we need to do a little ""spring cleaning"" in that area and possibly add a few more categories. Diagrams and complete Bills of Material with alternate parts should be the main focus for one of the folders because ultimately, that's what a lot of people come here to look for."

OpenPV,36lwal,ConcernedKitty,2,Wed May 20 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"It is negligible.  An IRLB3034 has an Rds of 1.4 mohms.  When you put two of them in parallel you drop down to 0.7 mohms.  At 4.2 volts, which you will never achieve with a parallel, unregulated box because of battery sag (at 30 amps your battery can sag as much as 0.4-0.5 volts) you see a voltage drop of .02 volts.  The same goes for fuses.  They have a resistance of 5 mohms or less and they are also used in parallel.  The total voltage drop would be around .04-.05 volts.  I know that I can't tell the difference between 3.8 and 3.75 volts and I doubt that anyone else can either."

OpenPV,36lczy,scottiethegoonie,2,Thu May 21 08:05:12 2015 UTC,Seconded this. That plastic will be a bitch to try and drill through without cracking. Even dropping it on a floor or something could crack it. Doesn't seem like a very permanent box mod.
OpenPV,36lczy,Winter_knights,1 point,Thu May 21 08:41:11 2015 UTC,"I had considered this problem, and I decided that I would apply gaffer tape where I intend to drill.  Hopefully that would cut down on the splitting and cracking of plastic.  I think once I get everything in the box, and perhaps apply some silicone sealant or epoxy to reinforce everything it should be pretty solid."
OpenPV,36lczy,ConcernedKitty,2,Thu May 21 08:45:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure it could work. Maybe put thin metal sheeting in where you would be attaching things like the 510 and button.

Otherwise you're going to get the same or slightly better battery life running in series (slightly better because buck is slightly more efficient).  The 25Rs will definitely give you improved life over whatever cell Efest took and plastered ""38A"" on. I'm reasonably sure they're just VTC4s like the original Purple 30A 2100mAh, but I haven't seen one unwrapped to check yet.  If you're just running 35W though, you might be interested in the Samsung 30Q as well. Illumn is carrying them. 3000mAh, 15A continuous.

I also didn't use a holder so I could leave the option of lipos available to me if I ever wanted to go that route. I still may. I just need to gauge whether or not three 1000mah lipos would outpace two 18650's. I think it would be a close race.
OpenPV,36i5rp,ConcernedKitty,1 point,Tue May 19 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this is gonna sound like some damned bro science, but I would swear my 1800 mah lipo box lasts every bit as long as my dual 18650 box with Sammy batteries."

OpenPV,36aisz,geero,1 point,Sun May 17 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"Your wiring diagram looks fine, might want to add a slide switch between your fire button and the positive so you can kill the fire button if you shove the mod in your pocket.  15A will probably be fine if you plan to stay around .5 ohms.   The biggest thing is just take your time. I got in a big hurry on a couple mods and ended up breaking a lot of stuff and wasting time. Flux is your friend, keep your iron tinned and clean.

As for the soldering I have a little experience with soldering but I'm no expert so thanks! The guy who is supplying my wooden box is kindly pre drilling for my switch and 510 connector so that will help.  One other question, what gauge wire do you normally build with?

OpenPV,36a2ig,TDVapes,1 point,Mon May 18 21:23:06 2015 UTC,"A balancing charger is not needed for parallel batteries. You should be wiring the 2 batteries together making 1 circuit. Neg to neg, pos to pos. Put the 2 fuses together and solder them in as 1 on the positive wire. But make sure you leave a bit of wiring space in case you need to remove the fuses. The vamo boards already have built in protection and may not function with the fuses. The negative terminal of the vamo (black wire) is on top and needs to be wired to the battery and the outside of your 510 connection. The positive terminal on top (white wire normally) goes into the center of the 510.  The positive battery connection is that little metal bit sticking out the bottom of the board."
OpenPV,367l32,scottiethegoonie,3,Sat May 16 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"I know you guys love the look and size of these switches look (as do I), here is how they function: Basically, these are tactile switches with metal housing and a solid metal ""button"" over the top.  They are press fit and epoxied together.  In my experience, simple tactile switches (cheap) have never failed on me.  Complex electromechanical buttons have failed, such as the PV2/PV5.  While the MSW-1202 may seem like a good alternative, because of the extremely short throw and small footprint, please know that they are susceptible to the same type of damage.  If you were to depress the button with a great deal of force (try it with a clamp), it would cause the switch assembly to separate with the housing ever so slightly.  Just 1mm of separation will cause dead spots or misfires.    Bending the legs of these switches puts stress on the switch assembly and can weaken the bond between it and the housing. Excessive heat on the legs can also do the same thing. Brute force on the button over time will cause the same type of damage.   If you have more than a couple of MSW-1202 switches on hand, take the locking nut off, hold them by the legs  and shake them in one of your hands.  Do you hear any rattling?  Or does it seem pretty solid?  I've learned that some of these have a tiny bit of play between the button and the tactile switch.  From my experience, the ones that seem solid (no space between button and switch) are more prone to being damaged."

I'm sure it's not as tough as a cast Hammond box but it still feels pretty solid. Have you had bad experiences building in them or actually carrying them about?"
OpenPV,365ihq,Shadowex3,1 point,Sat May 16 09:47:12 2015 UTC,"Putting the battery in the shank causes a couple of issues.  First, it makes for a very large shank.  A proportionally sized bowl would be quite a handful, and would also need to be very heavy to offset the torque of the battery sticking out the side.  Your design sounds very large and cumbersome.  I think it would be better sized for an 18350 and fitted with a built-in dripper.  Would make for a much more compact design, and you'd be able to optimize airflow."
OpenPV,365ihq,ThetaReactor,1 point,Sat May 16 10:33:39 2015 UTC,"That's what held me back for a while but then I realised the conventional design already puts a ~19-22mm atty where the shank would be, and there's a strong tradition of actual tobacco pipes having quite sizeable shanks and stems. 6.5 centimeters is easily well within spec for many classic pipe designs. It's a shame there isn't a short-and-wide battery size, that would be perfect for fitting a good amount of power in a bowl.  You make a fair point about balance though, a friend of mine has an analog pipe we could tie some weights to and test that on. I think with one end in your mouth and your hand on the other end it would balance fine."

OpenPV,35uc9m,mntzn,3,Wed May 13 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"Here is the best way I have found to manage lid rattle:  Drill out the lid screw holes for magnets to the depth of the magnet.  Do not drill out entirely.  This leaves a small part of the screw hole on the underside of the lid.  Epoxy magnets in.  After epoxy is nice and set, clean out any exess epoxy from the underside holes, use a drill if you have to.  With set screws for the enclosure, just screw them in with about 3mm sticking out of the enclosure. adjust so that they are as tall as possible while the lid still sits flush.  If you have another set of magnets for the enclosure, turn the lid over and place enclosure magnets on each of the lid magnets.  Take some epoxy on a toothpick or something similar and put epoxy inside of the holes only.  Then put the lid on the enclosure while sliding the enclosure magnets into their new homes.  Let it set with the lid on it.    Alternatively, you can always put epoxy on the inside of the lids four corners as build-up and carve it out little by little until you are happy with the how it sits."

OpenPV,35r33d,dreamsforgotten,3,Tue May 12 21:55:08 2015 UTC,Don't follow that guide you'll have 1 or 2 outcomes.  You'll burn the led varying the voltage or your led will change from dim to bright.  Do this https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenPV/comments/34jwlb/psa_how_to_wire_an_illuminated_push_button_to_a/ but pull your atomizer's positive voltage to the base of the transistor instead of pin 4 of the DNA board.
OpenPV,35r33d,dreamsforgotten,1 point,Tue May 12 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"I have not actually wired an illuminated switch into anything, that guide was just something I found awhile ago. So would that guide not work for anything other then an unregulated mod? Or will it not work at all?"
OpenPV,35r33d,dreamsforgotten,2,Wed May 13 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"Technically it'll work both regulated and not, however, it won't work well for a regulated mod.  You can choose your resistor for the max voltage that can be sent to the atty and that will stop the led from burning but when you choose to vape at lower volts the led will dim.  Using a transistor as a switch in the link I posted, the battery + powers the led so the voltage remains constant, but doesn't connect power to ground until it senses the power when the atty is fired.  Your diagram works prefect for a unregulated mod because the volts are constant."

OpenPV,35psmu,lordfransie,1 point,Tue May 12 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"What kind of board are you working with? Boards like the SX350J you will need an actuator button that sits between the board and the box, it's usually a small machined piece of metal that's essentially locked into place by the board but allowed to move. Actuators for the DNA series boards are much different, they're smaller and in the DNA case there are solder terminals for external switches. You can leave the onboard switches alone, and wire in new ones without any issues."

OpenPV,35p1rx,DropTheSpoons,3,Tue May 12 10:12:18 2015 UTC,Making the switch wouldn't be too hard. The hard part would be positioning the switch and spring. This could be easily made from parts from a local B&M home improvements store.  I recently tore down my MCV cherry bomber to look at the switch.   Since the entire housing is the negative that's the part of the switch that's always in contact.  When you press it in it makes contacts with the neg of the 510.   I think one of the crucial parts would be to make absolutely sure that the switch makes a clean firm contact with the 510 neg when you press it. I'll post pics of the MVC cherry bomber switch or you could look up a teardown of it to get a better idea.
OpenPV,35p1rx,pixeldotz,1 point,Tue May 12 11:36:37 2015 UTC,"Pics would help a bunch, thank you. So far I have some rivets/screws in mind but I'm not really sure what to use to house the spring/magnets yet."
OpenPV,35p1rx,pixeldotz,1 point,Wed May 13 00:06:16 2015 UTC,For this type of switch there is no housing. The case itself is the housing.
OpenPV,35p1rx,pixeldotz,1 point,Wed May 13 00:16:18 2015 UTC,That sounds even better. I'll have to see it to wrap my mind around it. I'm not very imaginative.
OpenPV,35p1rx,amdcursed,2,Wed May 13 00:25:27 2015 UTC,Btn  Disgusting picture but it illustrates the point. The spring is the key to this design.

OpenPV,35lscf,ferongr,3,Mon May 11 20:06:36 2015 UTC,The article is aimed towards multimeter users. Most multimeters will be way off under 1 ohm. Our VW devices and resistance testers are generally designed with such resistances in mind and are pretty good at these ranges.
OpenPV,35lscf,catdumpling,1 point,Mon May 11 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"Our VW devices and resistance testers are generally designed with such resistances in mind and are pretty good at these ranges.   Only to an extent. If you're talking super-sub-ohm, you generally need REALLY expensive lab-grade LCR or bench multimeters to get accurate results. There are ways to get close with various ""boosters"" and convertors (which is what I think the article was getting at), but honestly I don't trust most consumer-level stuff (even my personal $80 Amprobe meter) to be accurate under about 0.2Ω or so. The lower the resistance, the wider the tolerance usually is; if you pull up the spec sheet even for a $300 Fluke meter, you'll see the tolerance goes out to 5%-10% once you hit really low resistances! I hardly think a no-name plastic $10 ohm checker from FT is going to be more accurate than that.  The only ohm checkers I'd consider to be reasonably safe (probably) at those super low resistances are the USA Ohm Meters ones, which are supposedly measured to be accurate to within 0.018 of an ohm. Still not safe enough for super-sub-ohming IMHO though, and as far as I'm concerned there are no consumer-level resistance checkers that are accurate enough for that."

OpenPV,35ha58,pixeldotz,1 point,Mon May 11 14:48:03 2015 UTC,I had this EXACT problem. 3rd box I built was completely autofiring.   I tore it down and rebuilt 3 times. Wasted 3 FETs and 3 resistors.   In the end it turns out it was a shorted voltmeter.   The volt meter functioned perfectly. Would only display volts if the buttons was pressed. But it was causing the autofire. I use the same diagram you're using for all my builds.  So my advice.. Take away the volt meter and see if it stops auto firing.  Fwiw - I replaced the volt meter and my box functioned as it should.
OpenPV,35ha58,pixeldotz,1 point,Sun May 10 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"It was the exposed resistor as David guessed, regardless, thanks for sharing you experience, I'll have your advice in mind when building, have a gold on my behalf, I wish I could buy you a beer or something :)"

I want to make one like you described, and imo the concern is converting the 510 to BF, any dropper bottle can attach to the needle or hose like in this pick  Getting the right 510 and BF conversion parts from FDV is a sketchy because the pictures are shit, the process is documented poorly, and v3 and v4 FDV 510 parts are not compatible with each other.  Low-pro v4 versions have no BF core available yet.  As soon as I figured out how to convert an atty I'd actually like to BF (Marquis, Derringer, Aeolus, Magma), I started lusting after a box that I haven't seen built yet (mod a 1550p to increase depth by 1/2"", then cram a squonking raptor 20a series build using a 1590A dual sled)"
