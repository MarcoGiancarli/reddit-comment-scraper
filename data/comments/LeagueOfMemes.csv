What I understand is that after 5.13, if you picked zed, he would cause the enemy minions to stack and get stuck on the enemy inhibs and stop attacking. They would then die on their own and zed would get all of the experience and gold from them. Very strange.  (Video is a little bit loud.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jQ8luiX7Ow"

LeagueOfMemes,3cxdag,NegativeScythe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"Because for a while, Zed was really popular and every other game, I would fight Zed. So I started playing Adc and realized I liked it, and eventually put a lot of time into that role.   He can be dealt with, but early game he has a strong poke with double Q if he doesn't hit a minion. If you stay in the minions, he just shadow E's you. He has no resource other than energy, and he has an execute that makes it easy for him to farm. He can kill you under your tower if he gets ahead with Lv 6 pretty easy if he takes ignite. Once he does that, he ganks all other lanes.   In short, he's a pretty safe Assassin with no downside if you play passive against him. He can dive turrets with ease and only really does bad if HE sucks, or if you gank him after baiting his shadow. Good zeds won't waste their shadow in a position they could be ganked."
LeagueOfMemes,3cxdag,imgurtranscriber,2,Sun Jul 12 03:33:28 2015 UTC,I was also glad he got disabled honestly. I main malz and Zed is one of my tougher matchups. Having one of your few counters/tougher matchups disabled is a huge boon. I really wanted to try Zed anyway though :(

LeagueOfMemes,3cddx1,rageofbaha,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with the current MMR system is the amount of LP you lose on average compared the amount of LP you win on average.  A win can net a maximum of 16 LP. A loss can net a maximum of like 32. Also, the closer you are to 100 LP, the less LP you get from a victory and the more you lose from a defeat. The more times you win - particularly the more times you win in a row - the harder the matchmaker works to make you lose, because the matchmaker wants everyone to stay as close to a 50% w/l ratio as possible.  So, when you get into your promos, it means that you're generally (read, almost always) coming off a winning streak. This greatly increases the chances of you either getting put up against people who are significantly better than you, or getting matched with that one super toxic feeder teammate."

Game starts and I'm jungling this was back when jungle was weak (season 3). I get to second camp and almost die to wolves so I back with only lvl 2 and 2 camps killed. It was impossible for me to pull off an Elise combo that game so all I did the whole time was stun and spider form attack. We ended up winning with me being something like 0-3-20 just from stunning."

LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,ngratz13,3,Tue Jun 30 13:27:45 2015 UTC,I am currently 2-3 in my placements for this season and am pretty afraid to finish them. I almost always get shoved into a role I am not the best at. I should probably look into getting a duo partner.
LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,danjr321,4,Tue Jun 30 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"What roles do you play/not good at? My top 2 are jungle/support. I find talking in ranked lobby to be very helpful. My worst role is adc. If it looks like that's what it's coming down to when we're talking, I will let them know while I can play that role it is my worst.   Someone else at that time may say adc is OK with them, they may not but at least I'm being honest about what they should realistically expect from me.  I find calling 2 pref gets a lot of others to do the same rather than just 1 role so people tend to be more flexible when I do that."
LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,ngratz13,2,Tue Jun 30 13:55:20 2015 UTC,My worst 2 are probably Support and mid. My top 2 roles are probably Jungle and ADC. Top seems to depend on who I am playing. I play a fair amount of ADCs to be flexible with my support. I can play pretty much all ADCs decently with the exception of probably Sivir.   I can play any role but am most comfortable in the Jungle or as ADC. I am attempting to play more support and to get better but it isn't my favorite role to play.
LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,danjr321,2,Tue Jun 30 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"Support is definitely not a glory role. It's about getting in there so your adc can get ahead or protect the adc. The way I play it and think about it is if I was playing adc right now, what would I want my support to do? It's thinking for 2+ people. I like playing tanky supports like nautilus, Leona, braum because I feel like they can get up in the enemies faces and force a good trade without taking a terrible amount of damage. They're more forgiving than Annie, Morgana or Janna.  I do feel sometimes that mid/late game no matter what you do as a support you can't necessarily carry a game since your damage is lower and you kind of depend on the team, that's the one downside to support that I see. But hopefully they listen to pings we group and win."
LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,ngratz13,2,Tue Jun 30 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"I started my league career as a support main, but dropped out of it a while back. I get frustrated when I am serving up kills on a silver platter and my ADC wont even attempt to get the kill. I recently picked up Taric though, tried him once in my Sona main days and didn't care for him, and really enjoy his ability to just go in and fuck shit up. He can force trades and heal back damage, and the point and click stun is pretty nice. You can also stack armor on him and gain damage which is cool."
LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,danjr321,2,Tue Jun 30 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah taric can be fun as well for sure. The way I see it is this: it can be frustrating if your adc does not follow up. I'd say 75% of the time they do. When I was lower levels, for sure that rate was lower but they usually do now.  Sometimes though even without getting a kill, a trade can be a win. If you burn enemy summoners this is a win. If you make them go b this is a win. Jungler now comes in they have no flash because of previous trades, yay. They go back, you guys keep gaining a cs lead and xp lead on them. Also yay.   I'm very focused when it comes to objective control be it towers, dragon, Baron or inhibs, so the way I see it is any little advantage with proper team communication can be turned into a bigger advantage with the right play."
LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,ngratz13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:48:31 2015 UTC,I had one game where every time I would walk forward the enemy adc and support would back off. It was the easiest zone ever because they were so afraid of Taric that I just walked around and let my ADC farm.
LeagueOfMemes,3bls4d,danjr321,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:29:59 2015 UTC,whenever i get into the lobby i let everyone know my top 3 roles in this format: mid > top > sup.  I almost always get one of those three roles and I can be confident with my champion pool.

LeagueOfMemes,3bijk1,610163,10,Mon Jun 29 19:52:42 2015 UTC,If you build full tank it kinda is
LeagueOfMemes,3bijk1,Delta25,-2,Mon Jun 29 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"I really feel it is situational. I play a lot of teemo and I sometimes play him as a tank.   You only play teemo tank if they have an ad top and jungle, like riven, irelia, lee sin, rengar. You can very easily 1v3 as a teemo tank vs 3 ad champs. I have done it many times."
LeagueOfMemes,3bijk1,Barhoom91,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:29:21 2015 UTC,Full tank is bad.  On-hit is a tanky alternative to AP teemo - but not 'full tank'.
LeagueOfMemes,3bijk1,theswerto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:46:13 2015 UTC,"How does one build this ""on hit""?"
LeagueOfMemes,3bijk1,RiotsoOP,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:59:01 2015 UTC,"""On hit"" builds are builds that utilize on hit effects like spellblade items (Sheen, Triforce, Iceborn Gauntlet, new jungle enchant), wit's end, frozen mallet, nashor's tooth, blade of the ruined king, statikk shiv, etc.)  A tanky on-hit build would focus on two or three of those items (likely Botrk + Wits end + 3 HP items and tanky boots)  It isn't a particularly powerful build, instead it relies on hit and run tactics and being faster than other people. In actual fights it just shreds %hp and kills magic resist to help your team.   Realistically, there's very little reason to go on-hit these days, because AP teemo does a ton more damage and his e's on-hit value is so much better these days."
LeagueOfMemes,3bijk1,theswerto,2,Tue Jun 30 11:01:22 2015 UTC,"Tank Teemo is OP! Since Teemo has global taunt and everyone will be diving to get you, you're baiting them into doing so. It's genius!"

As someone who is a league fan boy, everyday I have less and less reason to play.  Youtube gaming + DOTA = Critical hit on to Riots nexus. it'll start with streamers, they'll slide in and slowly build a fan base. If Riot doesn't get their shit by then it'll be too late. On twitch you'll notice DOTA staying in the number one spot for a month now, then comes the big DOTA events, they'll do something that'll make the average user wanna join in. They'll aim for the new wave of potential players, maybe your young bro/sis will be on dota, your friends will be talking about DOTA. ESPN will be talking about dota. Everyone is talking about DOTA! now mind this. League will not die! but... they won't be on top and slowly fade into the darkness of DOTAs shade. It'll be league vs DOTA and unless riot gets their shit together people have no reason to play league. They'll be a joke about league's shitty client, the same way people make fun of xbox, apple and android battles. League will be joke.   Now again I could be wrong but I have this gut feeling that I cannot confirm but someone has to believe me or feel the same. 2016 will be the year of DOTA. Just watch..."

Not to mention those ""1 week of a fun mode"" every now and then, that's just sad that they can't leave it around completely, yet their player base by some logic spends more money than DotA players, since they get all the heroes from start, skin parts are given at the end of the game etc. This is a great move from Valve, giving custom maps to players is bringing Warcraft 3 custom games back to the community, and everyone loved them at the time. Not to mention all the new creative stuff modders will come up with. I mean, DotA was made as a custom map, that's how MOBAs got popular, there's a huge logic behind letting the community create their own custom maps..."

Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.

LeagueOfMemes,3903ad,kruzus,4,Mon Jun 8 07:16:19 2015 UTC,"As a jungler, if you're doing fine mid (at least even) ok sure. I'll ping it,but if you don't come it's your loss. If you're 0/4 most likely you're gonna die and give it away anyway.  In fact, if you lose your tower, you can freeze the lane by your inner tower and make him fight you in a place where he can be easily ganked. Same logic goes for ganking. If you're getting rofl-stomped, I'd be wasting time ganking for you. I need to snowball another lane."
LeagueOfMemes,3903ad,Gengaar,2,Mon Jun 8 13:39:06 2015 UTC,"ehhh, it's situational. There have been times in mid that even when I'm behind the fights are still close and that extra mana regen/ CD reduction would have been enough to turn the tide. Don't look at the score, look at how close the fights are."
LeagueOfMemes,3903ad,fortunanondio,3,Mon Jun 8 18:03:42 2015 UTC,He probably really needs it in order to keep his tower. Losing mid is bad for everyone on your team.
LeagueOfMemes,3903ad,A_BOMB2012,4,Mon Jun 8 09:21:59 2015 UTC,But as 0/4 your mid laner will probably give the blue to their mid

The plot is that this cyborg (pictured) was being made from the body of an Olympic athlete at the end of WW2. The alien bombed the facility leaving it dormant until the 80s. It work up and only had one goal, murder everything. There were going to be three cyborgs built but the other two guys just didn't age for some reason and they show up when the cyborg awakens. I think the title is something like Mikadroid.  I am on my phone at the moment. I will check to see if I am right later."

LeagueOfMemes,37lqs9,Fapplet,5,Thu May 28 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"Nasus is kind of OP though. Just not in lane. If you let him win the lane (or just go even) then you have all but lost the late game already and should just try to close out the game while you can. If you can shut him down early (which plenty of top laners can do) then you buy your team a window in which to outscale the enemy and win before Nasus is finished farming up.   Thusly, if you're in a top lane and are behind the enemy Nasus, it can easily feel like he's totally OP and unstoppable.  If Bard outplays you, though, you were just outplayed. He's simple like that."
LeagueOfMemes,37mrwa,soulofhell,1 point,Thu May 28 19:45:21 2015 UTC,Must mean this the other way around there's no casual farming in bot lane and usually if a trip is gonna happen during laning it would be in bot adc sup jg
LeagueOfMemes,37nrmp,LuckMaker,11,Fri May 29 00:11:14 2015 UTC,My view is that this isn't really a sub for strict moderation. If it has some tie to League of Legends just let the upvotes and downvotes decide what posts are good. Not like we are here to have constructive discussions or anything.   That being said witch hunting is never good and should be deleted.
LeagueOfMemes,37nrmp,cubeofsoup,2,Fri May 29 09:28:07 2015 UTC,Yea we agree it shouldn't be heavily moderated. What we want mostly is some input from the community on what could make this sub better.

There will be shitty games, there will be trolls and people who singlehandedly throw games, but there is no elo hell. If you can't haul yourself out of the depths of Bronze, then you don't deserve to play in Silver. Same thing from silver to gold"
LeagueOfMemes,37mhxc,SevenFingerStud,1 point,Sat May 30 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"I saw a Corki build Hydra don't tell me there's no elo hell. lol No but,I understand the idea you've all said but I feel that it's flawed. Not being able to carry an entire team at say b3 doesn't mean you deserve to be a b3 player, and with lp clamping that's exactly what you need to be able to do. I had a friend who's been plat and diamond consistently play a couple games on my account and almost lost. It blew his mind. So the argument that you all have basically said that if you're good enough to be silver you can carry bronze isn't really valid."
LeagueOfMemes,37mhxc,MightyMelGibson,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"I will admit that Hydra on Corki is obviously bad, but there are worse items, sure the passive doesn't do anything but the stats the item gives and even the active are still usable, albeit there's a couple dozen items that should be prioritized.   The thing about that level of play is that it should train you not to rely on others. Use your teammates inabilities as bait. Do not attempt to save the 1/14 Vladimir from a 3 man gank, just take an objective while he plays the suicidal distraction.   I understand that people play like shit, and that there are people stuck in the deep shit. But ""elo hell"" as people describe it is not a thing. What people experience is poor play, bad teammates, and trolls. At some point you must understand that the meta does not mean shit in the place where you are. Your team will not aid you, and you are the only person you can rely on. If that means you have to lock Yi jungle and just afk push a lane after a tank, so be it. Tryndamere top lane to roll through towers? Worth. Zed mid lane to continuously poke/push is another good pick. Find one champ that will win you games in every position, pull yourself out, and learn the rest of the game as you climb. I'm not saying it will be easy or that it won't be frustrating, but any game is winnable in bronze."

If I'm jungling or playing any lane with an enemy shaco/eve, I almost always buy a pink on my first back. If I'm playing mid lane I always purchase two greens on my first back and keep wards in the river to the top and bottom of the lane.  If I'm a support of course I rush sightstone and sweeper as soon as I have 800g.  Wards are NEVER a waste of money unless you're in bronze and have absolutely shit map awareness."
LeagueOfMemes,36tcva,cubeofsoup,2,Fri May 22 06:04:40 2015 UTC,"So lets say you're mid and you know you can play safe without buying wards, just playing around your trinkets is enough. Why you reallly want to ward though is for the rest of the map. Early and mid game you want to ward to find the jungler. That, in theory, opens the rest of the map up for plays when you have info on where the enemy jungler is moving."

LeagueOfMemes,36cjwd,boblogin80,4,Mon May 18 14:44:51 2015 UTC,Eh this is my opinion as someone who liked playing him. His play amount dropped after they changed the hit box on his shadow dash. They made it was smaller so you could not taunt as many people or do flash taunts as effectively. That was really the only good part of his kit. It would allow you to taunt like 2 to 4 people in team fights and that was really all you were good for. Vorpal blade is meh. Its good poke early but unless you build damage its meh(why would you do this on shen though). He just does not feel as good as he used to.

WoW (And most mmos for that matter), CSGO, League, etc.  Not to say you can't get a performance boost in League out of a gpu upgrade. It just wouldn't be as significant of a boost as a CPU upgrade.  That being said unless the machine is only for playing games that are more cpu reliant and you're on a budget I'd say a GPU upgrade would probably better serve you. Feel free to look up benchmarks, though. No need to take my word for it."

LeagueOfMemes,35yw1u,Wehavecrashed,-11,Mon May 18 17:28:37 2015 UTC,As a higher elo player its not so much that they took the farm. Its more that they didnt have the mechanics to avoid auto attacking the minion. If I see supports accidentally auto-attack minions even without last-hitting it I see it as a sign of poor mechanics
LeagueOfMemes,35yw1u,igotvoipenated,9,Thu May 14 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"Good thing ADCs never fail to last hit a minion or ever accidentally AA a minion during a team fight or perhaps they'd be guilty of poor mechanics too, eh?"

LeagueOfMemes,35yw1u,igotvoipenated,3,Fri May 15 15:05:47 2015 UTC,"And telling them how poorly they are playing will surely make them improve. /s  I think the most important thing in solo queue is not ""don't feed,"" that's number two. Number one is, ""don't flame."" Focus on communication of the next thing to do, whether that be ""farm and stall, defensive wards, so we can recover"" or ""we are strong now, let's force a fight at dragon"" or ""I'm split pushing, push the other lane and ward in between us.""  Yeah, supports shouldn't auto minions unintentionally. But ADCs shouldn't waste time typing useless flames about their support's mechanics either. Rather than ""don't take my farm,"" for example, it could be useful to say, ""you can use the s key to stop moving and attacking."" Believe it or not, there might be legit platinum players who never realized such a thing."
LeagueOfMemes,35yw1u,IkomaTanomori,3,Thu May 14 23:54:31 2015 UTC,Seriously as a support main there is nothing faster you could do to make me not want to protect my adc than the adc flaming me. If you want to be an asshole then I'm going to spend my time helping other people after laning phase and only saving/helping you when I absolutely have to. On the other hand if you're nice and constructive even when we are losing lane/the match then not only is it fun regardless but I would have immense respect for you.

LeagueOfMemes,35pubi,alittlewood,2,Thu May 14 21:26:03 2015 UTC,No this actually happens when everyone dcs the game disappears since there are no players in it. Also me smells a drophack since this is the most cause for games like this.

LeagueOfMemes,34iy5k,Sad_Larry,5,Fri May 1 18:40:43 2015 UTC,So is the new system if someone annoys you in ranked you just report them for intentionally feeding and if enough people do it they are stuck playing 50 games of draft even if they weren't intentionally feeding. Same goes for everything else and if you get on chat ban you might as well not talk because one report while chat banned will get you another 20 games of 3 messages every ten minutes.

LeagueOfMemes,34eicx,StuperSconed,2,Thu Apr 30 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're being downvoted. The first set of them wasn't even made by Riot. When people bought that first set Riot basically said ""SCREW IT, FINE, we'll make skins for all the winners, but they won't be high priority.""  Perhaps people are just salty because they wanted something more out of it, but that doesn't justify downvoting you when you're absolutely correct."
LeagueOfMemes,34eicx,UltrafaceGuy,2,Thu Apr 30 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I mean people need to understand that Riot is in a constant cycle of things they are working on, they have skins teams, splash art teams, new champion teams, reworking old champion teams and so on.   So when these teams win, they have 5 skins they have to finish, and also decide what champion, which most of these players will end up playing a good variety of champions, they have to fit all of this within a really tight schedule.  There is a lot more I can about it, but probably in the long run someone will say something like Rito makes millions they should just work harder on it, Nah - I rather have cooler skins based on more interesting themes compared to skins after cheesy team uniforms, boring logos, with headphones on or something."

There's literally nothing else you can do. At that point I usually ask whoever voted no to supply a gameplan for us to follow to win. If they do then I try it out and we'll see how it goes.  If they don't then I kinda just aimlessly farm as much as i can and hope for some good luck.  But if the vote is failing over and over chances are at least two people think the game is winnable. Just play it out until it's either utterly hopeless or your nexus explodes.

If you want a tanky build with some damage:  Cinderhulk, Frozen fist/Spirit Visage(order depends on enemy team), Abyssal, Warmogs. You can switch out abyssal with thornmail if you want to. Boots are up to you, but I usually run Merc Threads with this build.  I've had good experiences with it as an all-round build.  Frozen fist synergizes great with your W and gives you awesome wave clear when combined with cinderhulk.  If you are gonna play him AP (Which I hate):   RoA, Lich Bane, Deathcap, Void Staff, and a defensive item like Zhonyas/Abyssal if you're feeling it.   I usually run Mercs on this build as well since you'll want to combo your q+e+w proc(in that order) as often as possible, and you're therefore vulnerable to CC. Late game Lucidity boots are good as well, since this build has no cdr-items.  If you are going full tank. Just watch Trick2g's video on it. That build is pretty much the best tank build for it."
LeagueOfMemes,33kfay,Charrawazt,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"I prefer randuin's over iceborne gauntlet, because it gives more health for cinderhulk to scale on, despite the lack of CDR."

But the way I see it, build-guides(or whatever) are more like guidelines. they should teach you the strenghts and weaknesses of a champion, allowing you to learn exactly what to build and when to build it. This is just my personal preference of how to build him.   And please take it with a grain of salt, never trust a guide 100%."

LeagueOfMemes,32vm8n,holygoalie10,6,Fri Apr 17 02:08:13 2015 UTC,He is SO annoying to play against but I imagine it is SO satisfying to pop his ult with 10hp and destroy the adc.
LeagueOfMemes,32vm8n,Seafox89,3,Fri Apr 17 04:26:12 2015 UTC,"I think he's just one of those champs you hate as a new player (not saying you are, but there's a good chance). I used to hate him and throw phrases like 'no-skill champ' at champs like yi and trynd.   Played for years, still with the same grudge. I also dislike the randomness of crits, so I played top, mastered pretty much all the toplaners except for trynd and goofy shit like yorick.  Then I gave it a go. I was hooked. I had already been playing for years and I realized that melee adcs are actually really hard to play in a decent setting, they just stomp when there's a large skill disparity. But I still didn't think I'd like him.   First real main I ever had. Used to play just about anything, played a few champs well, but usually played something different every game. With trynd, I literally just spammed 18/20 games on him. Jungle, top, mid whatever. I never got bored. Still don't, although I have seem to hit a wall where he seems less effective in the elos I'm at now. Although that's probably just because of how I play him, there's plenty of challenger trynd mains. I'm sticking to other tops atm, but trynd is still my babe."

LeagueOfMemes,32srpc,CamZ17,7,Thu Apr 16 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"The closest to an international agreement on a definition [for sports] is provided by SportAccord, which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport.  SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:   have an element of competition be in no way harmful to any living creature not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football) [people can build their own computers] not rely on any ""luck"" element specifically designed into the sport   They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport)."
LeagueOfMemes,32srpc,JaMojo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:33:47 2015 UTC,I was with you all the way until the luck bit. Uhhhh crit chance? Doesn't that add an element of luck? And then make league not a sport by those rules?
LeagueOfMemes,32srpc,Waffle842,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:28:20 2015 UTC,Crit chance isn't completely random (although psuedo-random can still be a bitch). Additionally the game is not decided with random crits because a diamond adc will always beat out a bronze adc in all areas and hence skill is a much larger factor than random crits.

And all I'm saying, is by these rules if someone didn't want esports to be a thing, they could totally use that line right there. Dota heroes like chaos knight and ogre magi would have to be removed from competition to abide by the rules of what constitutes a sport.   Really my point is. Be careful trying to defend MOBAs as a sport. I'm totally down and behind esports 100%. But we should be careful not to throw ourselves under a bus quoting official rules."

There is no way in hell that anything is their fault. So if they are having a bad game and are angry, they will most likely take it out on a teammate. Regardless of stats they will always believe it's their teammate's fault that they are having a bad game. No one just owns up and admits to having a bad game.  This is most prevalent in lower ELO, but you get the idea.  It's not that they are dumb or trolling so much as they just refuse to accept any responsibility for anything."

LeagueOfMemes,32ebi8,xSolitariusx,2,Mon Apr 13 18:48:30 2015 UTC,I like to stay in lane for XP unless I have a substantial amount of gold. You can CS which is nice and get level advantage. Sometimes people see you're alone and go hard to kill you and you can take advantage of their carelessness. It also helps that I mostly play Thresh and Blitz and can just grab people into towers so I don't have to do any work.
LeagueOfMemes,32ebi8,Watchakow,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:17:11 2015 UTC,"clearly always situational like anything in league there are no absolute rules of what to do, but generally id say if you do t recall with you're ADC ( or roam as u/theN00bcake pointed out) you leave yourself in a position where it's fairly easy for the jungled to dive you."
LeagueOfMemes,32ebi8,SimbaOnSteroids,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I roam sometimes too, but generally if my adc backs before 6 I just stay in lane and farm under tower. If the enemy freezes lane then I'll roam. Most junglers aren't going to try that dive with the small amount of time before my adc returns. At a higher elo they might, but not in Gold apparently."
