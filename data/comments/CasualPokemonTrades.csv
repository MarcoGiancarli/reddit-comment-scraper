Or you might have luck if you keep your eye out for a giveaway here or over on /r/pokemongiveaway

CasualPokemonTrades,3e5c8i,tgarnett,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:26:49 2015 UTC,From what I've gathered it's the NA versions and it's because they're updating with more codes possibly? Does yours always time out on the server bar too?

CasualPokemonTrades,3e272l,insert-amusing-name,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:36:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know the answer to this, but the method I use is to have a pokemon in my party that knows the move entrainment. On your turn, you can pick the pokemon to use this move on and it tells you the ability of that pokemon. That's how I find my HA pokemon in hoards."
CasualPokemonTrades,3e272l,namida7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:20 2015 UTC,yeah but with trace you save a lot of time i guess. Ill pick up a role play poke and when i find one of the 5 with a ha ill role play them all and then report back on what order it happens in. Thanks for giving me this idea :)
CasualPokemonTrades,3e272l,Novyxen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:16:21 2015 UTC,I think Trace picks a random one's ability and copies it.
CasualPokemonTrades,3e272l,safarizone_account,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:07 2015 UTC,im sure it shows all of the abilities though
CasualPokemonTrades,3e272l,PokemonLover2189,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"it doesn't because once the ability Trace has been used, it copies the opponent's ability, and then your pokemon doesnt have Trace anymore, unless you recall it and send it out again."
CasualPokemonTrades,3dzqqd,LWHwastaken,4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:18 2015 UTC,Put the egg in box one and make sure it's in any slot but the first one. Make sure there's nothing else in the box and that the first slot is empty. Then run the cloning code and the egg should be overwritten by the empty slot and goodbye rotten egg :)
CasualPokemonTrades,3dzqqd,Shiny_Sylveon,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:50 2015 UTC,I know how to get rid of it...? That's not the issue.

CasualPokemonTrades,3dzqqd,Thaxagoodname,2,Mon Jul 20 23:08:08 2015 UTC,If you ever get a Bad Egg the last thing you should do is hatch it which is why it was taking so long to hatch. You forced it to hatch though so it corrupted your game.
CasualPokemonTrades,3dzqqd,Thaxagoodname,3,Mon Jul 20 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though: There aren't ""bad egg""s in gen 6. The glitch does not exist in ORAS. I've had a decent amount of corrupted Eggs from screwing around with PKHeX and Powersaves, and they've all turned into Bulbasaurs after hatched. That's why I felt fine with this one even though it was being a bitch."
CasualPokemonTrades,3dzqqd,MartianOak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:25 2015 UTC,Weird. What I said must have been the case in X and Y.
CasualPokemonTrades,3dzqqd,MartianOak,2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"I really hope it was an honest mistake, but the outcome is still awful.

CasualPokemonTrades,3dzqqd,HeyJowd,4,Mon Jul 20 22:50:45 2015 UTC,"That's the thing: there aren't any documented Bad Eggs in ORAS. In X/Y occasionally they will randomly show up in the PSS, but it's not a result of hacking, it's a random data corruption bug. The Eggs from improper hacks will still turn into Bulbasaurs.  You actually gave me some pretty sweet lil Slowpoke babies. I'm hatching them as soon as my game gets to a playable condition."

CasualPokemonTrades,3dtnzi,bastosandrelopes0102,2,Sun Jul 19 10:17:02 2015 UTC,"There was a post about this exact thing not to long ago, and that i believe it isnt allowed here. Think about it, why would anyone clone pokemon for you only to keep said pokemon? You aren't offering anything rare or unique or interesting. If you were offering a Hoopa or Volcanion or some other cool mon, sure someone would help you. But your offering absolute garbage, asking for a lot of work (clearly you don't know how much work Powersaves can be) and offering literally nothing in return. Come back with something of value, or go buy your own powersaves."
CasualPokemonTrades,3dtnzi,guitarfreak2105,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn´t know that powersaves would take much work. I actually have a few Hoopas that I can give. Again, sorry for not knowing what I was asking :("

CasualPokemonTrades,3dnbk0,Humminglady,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"Define ""pretty things"" :P  Anything interesting you might be looking for? :)"
CasualPokemonTrades,3dnbk0,Humminglady,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:04 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah but mostly illegal combos starters please! but I know a lot of people prefer legals :/  I'm on mobile right now so I can't link anything for you. I have been loving lure balls lately, but in general I just really like when the ball and Pokemon match! You can check my post history if you are interested, I have a couple posts open on bankballexchange that detail what I am looking for currently.  I really have enjoyed bankball giveaways that give a Pokemon in a bunch of different balls (Bulbasaur in 5 different balls, for example) but that would be much more work for you!  Maybe you could do some eggs AND hatched ones to give away? That way you please both crowds xD"
CasualPokemonTrades,3dnbk0,Humminglady,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm actually aiming for legals for now since i'm putting up a legit trophy case :/ Maybe i could edit the balls of the  leftovers with PS if the crowd begs to differ :3  Matching balls are always nice, especially for aesthetic purposes. So far the plan is giving out 6 different pokemon species at once at about 30 each, but maybe the same species might be given out again with different EMs and ball type - such as scyther in sport or safari, depending on the plans.  I was actually thinking of doing both eggs and some hatched ones, but i might accidentally hatch the ones with matching SVs, and cause them to lose a free shiny.   The default giveaway will go on as an egg giveaway where people could take whichever eggs they want, and (optional) ask if there are any that match their SV - with a slight twist for fun, but i won't spoil it here. Maybe i will be doing the hatched ones after an a few hours or a day, depending on the speed of the giveaway since i will be needing the box space.    Edit: The hatched ones might take place at /r/pkmnga since it has a faster pace than cpt, but the eggs will be done here first, then moved to pkmnga. After about an hour or two, the hatching begins and breedjects will be given out according to demand. So here is a schedule of what order it will be in:   Eggs & SV Match - CPT, ± 1 day Eggs & SV Match - PkmnGA, ± 2 hours Hatched breedjects - PkmnGA, ± 4 hours"
CasualPokemonTrades,3dnbk0,Humminglady,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah that totally makes sense. I thought you meant shinies via luck, I didn't realize you would be checking shiny values for every egg! That sounds like a cool idea.   Would you also offer to check people's TSV then? Most people here I think probably don't know theirs :/"
CasualPokemonTrades,3dnbk0,Humminglady,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"I'm only hatching the perfect matches i want over at /r/svexchange, so i won't be checking the others. Incidentally, one of these eggs might match someone and grant them a free shiny.  However, i won't be checking people's TSV since its going to take too long tbh. Maybe they can get their TSV checked somewhere :/  I was originally planning to give them out as matches in svex, but the giveaways there usually take about a week each and it might be too long for me since i don't have much space available :/"
CasualPokemonTrades,3dnbk0,TasteMyRamen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:22:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I would never have the patience to do an egg giveaway there :/   I'm sure you'll learn what works and what doesnt after the first one though! Good luck :)  I'll let you know when I get home if I think of any cool combos xD
CasualPokemonTrades,3dnbk0,silverjays,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Ikr, especially with the organizing system where you should identify which egg corresponds to which user, and even then errors still happen often and not to mention the scheduling :/  I'm actually more stumped in the EMs though, since i'm trying to breed competitively. EMs are always a nice addition to pretty balls after all :3"

CasualPokemonTrades,3d6u2x,PrincessStephzii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:01:02 2015 UTC,I thought that was me and started to have a panic attack -_-
CasualPokemonTrades,3d6u2x,PrincessStephzii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:25:06 2015 UTC,Why would you panic? I'd be giving you your giveaway prize if it was!
CasualPokemonTrades,3d6u2x,PrincessStephzii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:35:42 2015 UTC,because I see my name and I instantly think about having to talk to people and freak out.

CasualPokemonTrades,3d6u2x,PrincessStephzii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:40:40 2015 UTC,I think it's the worst thing ever. There's quite a few things I think I'd be really good at but I've never been able to force myself to try them because they all involve interacting with people.
CasualPokemonTrades,3d6u2x,PrincessStephzii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:44:43 2015 UTC,"I dropped out of college for almost two years because I wasn't comfortable in large crowds. Schooling was where I found my self worth. I was a great student, and I loved that about myself, and I dropped out because I was depressed and having anxiety attacks because of the large crowds.  Trust me, I know how you're feeling. If you ever want to talk about it, my inbox is open!"
CasualPokemonTrades,3d6u2x,Humminglady,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:48:54 2015 UTC,The biggest problem it really causes is I have trouble making phone calls. And by have trouble I mean it's terrible and I hate it lol.   Thank you though and the same goes for you!

For Weavile give it this: EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly Nature and like Altaria give it 6 IVs and a pokeball change to whatever haha. Also give it its English name.   Make both shiny if possible. Hope its not too much trouble."

My brother was 10 and I was 18 when I waited with him in line at the old EB Games to get him Pokemon Red.  I didn't think much of it at the time, but he started playing and I realized it was a JRPG like any other I'd ever played, and that's when I got hooked.  He grew out of Pokemon shortly before Silver and Gold were released, but I kept playing.  I got back into it like crazy this year after he died, because it makes me remember the days with our old GB's, mine a fat, his a Pocket.  I'd pick him up from school every day, and he amassed a ton of friends because he and his older brother thought they were awesome at the games, and we'd battle instead of do homework.

CasualPokemonTrades,3cv4u9,thiemsen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"The reason I state no editing is because in the past I have had people use it as a place holder. They will make a comment, and then later edit it to correctly follow the rules and/or describe what they have deposited in order to ensure they are one of the first to get what they want. Some people don't have a problem with this, but I prefer to give my pokemon to those who are respectful enough to take the time to read and follow all of the rules.  Also, new comments on this post don't show up in my inbox anyways. I have it disabled, so it doesn't matter if you reply to yourself. I simply refresh the page to see new comments anyways.

CasualPokemonTrades,3cuapk,thiemsen,2,Sun Jul 12 08:54:51 2015 UTC,"it should be noted that the destiny knot chooses five IVs from a combination of both parents, not just the holder of the knot. You'll notice this in action when you breed a 6iv ditto with another pokemon - you'll see any mix of 1-6iv children depending on the luck of the draw. Therefore, it's desireable to keep switching out the pokemon you want with more developed children until 3-5 generations in when you're crossing a 6iv ditto with a 5iv parent. As to getting 0iv pokemon, here is the method I use:     I have a 0 spd ditto i got from friend safari (though any 0iv male pokemon in the desired egg group will work unless it's genderless like beldum, then you need a ditto).     give the 0iv parent a power anklet. all resulting children will have 0 speed.    match the new 0 speed pokemon (equipped with the power anklet) with an opposite-gendered compatible pokemon with the required nature. The resulting offspring will have 0 speed and the desired nature.     match the offspring with 0 speed and the correct nature with your 6iv ditto. (I have a set 5iv/0speed males that cover every egg group that i use in this step to eliminate the chance of getting the 31 speed from the ditto). Give the everstone to the pokemon to pass down nature and the destiny knot to the ditto.    as you get better offspring with more perfect ivs, switch them out (don't forget to pass along the everstone).     keep producing eggs until you get the iv spread you want.          As to the order of breeding,: 1. egg moves 2. Nature 3. IVs"
CasualPokemonTrades,3cuapk,weRUNsf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"I see, so you grouped everything to one parent, and leave the ditto 6IV. I'll try out this method, thanks for the advice :)"
CasualPokemonTrades,3cuapk,Shiny_Sylveon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:56:46 2015 UTC,"Tackling the main thing with zero ivs, the power items dont pass down a certain value as much as they insure that the stat that it correlates to has that IV passed down from the parent holding it. The destiny knotpasses down any random 5 IVs so it can still pass down, say, a zero speed as well as perfect atk def sp atk and sp def but you just need to hope it passes down the right ivs from the right parents.  Edit: also no matter what you will always pass down three ivs from parents unless you use the knot which then passes down five. And there is really no need to use a power item over a destiny knot while breeding unless you dont have the 6 iv parents or if you really just need one stat and dont care about the others"

CasualPokemonTrades,3cgllx,justlookingfordragon,2,Tue Jul 7 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"genderless pokemon can NOT pass down their balls. The same goes for male only pokemon like Tauros or your Volbeat. If you breed them, they will alsways be in the standard pokeball. Even if you breed them with a ditto caught in a special ball - this ball will not pass down to the offspring, even though you could consider Ditto the ""female"" part.  Only female pokemon can pass down pokeballs."

You can catch that pokemon in HG/SS only in the Bug Catching contest or the Safari Zone, so every Illumise traded from these games will always be in either a sport ball or safari ball."

Maybe do one generation a week then with one day of the week being for requests and then one day for pickups?"

CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,hugorz12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:02:06 2015 UTC,"So its kind of like a custom for different-for-each-person giveaway?  Yes. Most would be interested, but just giving you a heads up, that this will be very tiring and busy, so its better if you keep a maximum limit or something, since people will most probably be sending you details like nature, moveset, gender, IV and EV spreads, specific pokeball, egg hatch location, etc :/"
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,Arcuslester,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:04:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice I was thinking on putting a limit, congrats on the shiny flair btw"
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,Arcuslester,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:13:15 2015 UTC,"Just be careful of rude people, since they tend to be ruthless on situations where they are in control - in this case being the pokemon requested, sometimes being very impatient and demanding.  Thanks c:"
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,Dreniza,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:28:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I also agree with this as well. This is a giveaway. If you get something wrong, or they don't like it, that's not on -you- to feel bad about. If they want to be ruthless, let them. You're trying your best and giving to the community, and thats the important part Hugorz."
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,Arcuslester,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:34:02 2015 UTC,"I agree on your point, but we could try reducing the chance of harassment of other members as much as we can before it happens.    Say the first few people that come can ask for specific things. But then after that's done and people have to get generic.   Regarding your point above, it might seem unfair to those who come later and might cause tantrums, but to be fair, all the rules are decided by the giveaway host, so participants should follow all the rules if they want to participate - meaning no fussing about stuff, but things happen anyway."
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,Dreniza,2,Thu Jul 2 09:44:38 2015 UTC,"Well. The thing is, and this is not meant to be rude at all but... Who really cares if its unfair to those who come later? They came later. That's on them not on the host. That's just me though."
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,Arcuslester,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:58:38 2015 UTC,"While that is true, we could not control the actions of people and it will be unlucky for the host if someone harassed him.   So to prevent things from going bad, we could try reducing the chance of harassment of other members as much as we can before it happens. :)"
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,Dreniza,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"On to what Arcuslester said, you COULD... offer a limit past a few people. Like. Say the first few people that come can ask for specific things. But then after that's done and people have to get generic. Just to give a few lucky people exactly what they want, then just go generic."
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,insert-amusing-name,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:29:10 2015 UTC,That's not a bad idea I'll think about it
CasualPokemonTrades,3buraw,pokefan01,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:30:55 2015 UTC,"uh hi just leaving a comment so you know im interested, still pondering what i want though... Thanks :) Edit: If you were to do the giveaway could i nab a couple pokemon for my team? If so they would be: Tyranitar holding tyranitite, Shiny? Abra (perfect iv's please and if possible at level 15!!) holding alakazamite, And if you can spare 3, a shiny goodra would be spiffing :) I hope you end up doing the giveaway, just posting this so you know people are interested!"

CasualPokemonTrades,3btw50,Arcuslester,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:52:10 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if mawile is classified as a baby since it has no evolution line.... but maybe you could get igglybuff and cleffa instead of jigglypuff and clefairy if you wanna do babies :)

They are more of an extra gift that come from the ""discarded shell"" of a nincada, depicted by how you need to leave a slot empty while evolving it to ninjask in order to get it.   Since it is a ""shell that came to life"", its treated as a different entity, and thus obtained a different type of pokeball - in which case is the normal pokeball due to it not being an event or anything special. I guess this rule is somehow to similar as how you are unable to pass down a cherish or master ball down by breeding."

CasualPokemonTrades,3b1iuo,S-man492,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:53:51 2015 UTC,Ahh I see thank you. The only reason I ask is because I got one from a guy (who I'm pretty sure was lying) at a convention. So I was wondering where it came from since I don't really hear much about it.
CasualPokemonTrades,3b1iuo,CharmiePK,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:20:30 2015 UTC,"I have a stupid question, sorry about that. If there is no legal Eternal form Floette, how did people get it? From where did they hack it? How did they build it with the same features as the one in X & Y? I'm asking these as I am new at this and sometimes I find it hard to imagine. Thanks!"
CasualPokemonTrades,3b1iuo,LucasFreeze,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:05:46 2015 UTC,Nah you're fine. From what I understand it's supposed to come out next year so like other person said. It's obtained like hoopa is. Through hacks and cheats. I think these pokemon are built into the games code so people just pull from there. Otherwise I have no idea either. I just have one so I was wondering where it might have come from.

CasualPokemonTrades,3a92lm,AGentBLUE144,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:30:36 2015 UTC,"A couple general tips for the device, as to version I'm guessing you mean the 'Pro' and 'Normal', I may be wrong here  There is no difference except region of device, pro is USA, normal is other regions.  The device can be changed regions after you have it, send an email with the key of device to their support team.  2nd - When you shiny a pokemon, there are 2 ways of doing it in powersaves, editing the OT (I never used that way so sorry for lack of info) and the other randomises the IV's so take note of what they were so you can change them back.  3rd - When you completely gen a pokemon in through the device it is untradeable (as far as 1's I've done that weren't legendary either, think I did gliscor originally and forgot it wasn't tradeable)  Easiest way I found for giveaway hosting was to either breed the poke you want /moves/stats and then edit the rest and clone, or mooch 1 from GTS/edit/clone.  4th - If you want to host a giveaway, before you start, send 1 of the clones or such through wondertrade, to make sure it is tradeable, if WT fails, it is tradelocked either completely or game version (XY vs ORAS)"

I'm not sure how it could be set up with a group, perhaps 3 v 3? Each with a 4 pokemon team?  And there are loads of themes you can do. I think good ones would be something that restricts them slightly, like you could tell people to post a bunch of information like favourite colour, favourite type, first letter of names, myres briggs personality type and then use one of those (Eg Use something weak to your favourite type, Use a pokemon of the type a myres briggs personality test links to) so people would be surprised."

CasualPokemonTrades,3a31uk,callmekite,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:14:03 2015 UTC,"I'd be more than interested :D   Maybe we can even change the theme; we can have a month with favorite colors, a month for fandoms, a month for mascots, etc. so that it doesn't get old using the same pokemon and you get to team up with different people :D  It would be good to ban most of the top tier pokemons so that people can feel free to choose any pokemon that they like without feeling like they're going to be outclassed by something like a Mega-Kangaskhan xD  Hopefully if we get enough people, we can set up a new subreddit so that we don't bother the people who are not interested in this :P"
CasualPokemonTrades,3a31uk,verloeren,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:35:28 2015 UTC,I would love it!!! :D

CasualPokemonTrades,3a1uuv,homebrewer54,2,Tue Jun 16 16:02:44 2015 UTC,Bank balls are balls only available in previous gens e.g. apricorn balls from HGSS. They are rare because they can only be bred onto Pokémon now and can only be on Pokémon that you can catch in older gens. HA Pokémon are easier to get but bank balls are rarer (apricorn balls are the rarest because they can only be on Pokémon from HGSS). I hope this helped :)
CasualPokemonTrades,3a1uuv,burner_7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:18:46 2015 UTC,Just one more question. How do I get into collecting them? Just one at a time and keep growing?
CasualPokemonTrades,3a1uuv,burner_7,2,Tue Jun 16 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, if you don't have Pokébank (neither do I) you'll have to trade for them with someone or if you want to breed them, only females can pass down their balls so look out for them (they're valued much higher)"
CasualPokemonTrades,3a1uuv,Humminglady,2,Tue Jun 16 16:24:14 2015 UTC,Porque no los dos?!?!? You'll just have to decide how you feel about illegal combos xD  I can give you a few if you'd like :D I have a lot on-hand..

CasualPokemonTrades,3a1uuv,Pechachu02,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"Bank ball pokemon are pokemon in poke balls from past generations ex: Moon ball, nest ball ect.  People collect them because they are in rare balls so they are rare."

CasualPokemonTrades,3a1uuv,verloeren,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:20:26 2015 UTC,Trading is always a good way to start. Get someone to trade you a female one. Mass breed it and trade for other rare balls.

CasualPokemonTrades,3a33na,LWHwastaken,2,Tue Jun 16 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"Types of giveaways I like hosting the most (if I had my own PowerSaves) are the type that make everyone happy collecting wise Ex: A female shiny in a Bank Ball with it's HA and is competitive. I started giveaways because I've always been a shiny collector and received most of them (even to this day) from other giveaways and would like to give back and hand outn more fun themed as well as not-so-given-out shinies. What surprised me my first time was that I ran out of my shinies! Sure I had a box but everyone took one. Nowadays it's hard to get rid of just one box :( At least for me. I suppose this ties into the next question. If they aren't shiny, you won't have as many customers anymore. I don't really mind though, shinies are more are and what not but it's super noce to see different kinds of giveaways. More manners would be appreciated too but that doesn't bother me that much. Though I wish could get rid of all the Pokemon I make for them .o. I just enjoy sharing my favorite things, like shinies, and well themed giveaways from something special to me makes it even more fun xD   Not mention beautiful people that go along with the theme or are entertaining to talk too and usually end up being loyal customers XD I do dislike how people won't read that I am away or ignore that the giveaway is closed and deposit anyways. :/ I hate disappointing people it's one of my fears and I'm sure it's irritating for them not to receive a Pokemon. I have received some help  from the CPT team with cloning and not to mentio /u/daroon5 <3 Thank you buddy for all the cloning that you have done for me :D I don't have PowerSaves and used PokeHex when I had it but really /u/daroon5 has done a lot for me and deserves at least a shoutout! Some advice I would give to others would be if you can, try to make giveaways for other people on the other side of the world who always miss giveaways, it's your giveaway you make the rules and the theme don't let people snap at you, PowerSaves are extremely helpful ;-;, themes are best, don't be disappointed if you don't sell out and try /r/pokemongiveaways :) they are pretty neat I can give more advice but everything seems cheesy and well obvious XD   I hope this was helpful! I love art btw ;D draw me something maybe~"

CasualPokemonTrades,3a33na,Blassie098,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"I try to host giveaways but it can be difficult since you need to do a lot of breeding, and I'm running out of box space. A concern for me is that you don't get many requests unless they're shiny, and it probably puts a lot of people off. This is doubled by different time zones, it would be nice to know the optimal times to post giveaways."
CasualPokemonTrades,3a33na,Blassie098,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input! I will include something about timezones, but I think I need to research some stuff first!"
CasualPokemonTrades,3a33na,Arcuslester,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:01:21 2015 UTC,"What type(s) of giveaway(s) do you like hosting most?   I most like the simple ""Comment here to claim"" giveaway, however when i have the time (and patience) doing giveaways that involve a puzzle or raffle can be fun :)   What got you interested in holding giveaways? How did you start?   I mainly got interested in giveaways for something i wont mention here (personal) however i also felt like back when i started, a lot of pokemon were very hard to get for some people. I enjoyed giving out pokemon that i had trouble getting in shiny form (e.g. carnivine). I started too long ago to mention (not long after powersaves for XY)   What surprised you the most about hosting your first time? Is it still an issue?   The impatience and rudeness of some people. Even in my first giveaways, i attempted to distribute pokemon in a fair and timely manner. Some people would get fed up and ""abuse"" me for being so slow and it was their turn, even though i was jjust going up the page in the order of comments. It doesnt really happen now thankfully, and most of those issues were at a different subreddit anyway. Theres always still one or two people around who are disrespectful, so you just need to be able to stand up to them and tell them to suck it up or get lost :3   Have you noticed the giveaway scene change since you started? (May also help to include when you started!) If so, how? Do these changes make it easier or harder for you to host?   Yes, because im ancient. Well, i started giveaways back in January-February 2014, over at /r/PokemonGiveaways. SOOOO much has changed since back then. POwersaves are everywhere now, and then we had the big genning boom a few months back. There are less people entering giveaways than last year. These changes make it much easier to host, as before there would be 5-6 requests a minute, so always a huge backlog and people had to wait a long time. Now, things are slightly more relaxed :)   Why do you continue to hold giveaways?What do you like about hosting? Dislike?   I already typed this but my ipad refreshed on me :( In short. I like making people happy + i feel indebted to those who used to help me out with cloning I like knowing that maybe someone is one step closer to finishing their living/shiny dex :) I dislike the drama it sometimes causes if theres someone being rude, or harassing me, etc. But usually they get the idea eventually and learn some respect or move on :3   Did you seek help at any point?   Hm, not sure what you mean by this question. If you mean help running giveaways, no i dont think so (apart from collaborative stuff?). If you mean help preparing for giveaways, yes :3 I used to rely on other cloners to clone for me   What advice do you have for people wanting to get into giveaways?   Start small and simple. Pick one pokemon you want to giveaway, in a smaller number. Use it as a test run so you get the hang of reading the requests and working your way around the gts Do NOT do FC giveaways until you've got some giveaway experience! Ive been doing giveaways (FC ones) since February last year, and they still do my head in! You need patience, and slightly stricter rules for those participating so that things run smoothly. Things like ""add me first, and i will send trade requests"" are important, but so are things like ""have a pokemon ready near the beginning/end of your PC"". You would be surprised at how often i sit in a fc trade and wait 1-2 minutes while the other person scrolls through their box -.- FC giveaways take long enough without extra waits Strict rules are okay, but dont be rude about it! If someone makes a mistake, I generally let them off the first time unless its a subreddit specific rule. E.g. I ask people to deposit a flabebe/shroomish and they deposit Pikachu. I send their shiny, and give them a warning. It rarely slows you down to search for something else, but its just inconvenient if it happens a lot (which it doesnt).  When announcing your giveaways, try to be specific with when it will start. Time conversion websites are get. I particularly like this website. You type in a time + timezone + date + ""in local time"" and it will convert your time to everyone elses when they click on it. Eg. 1pm GMT+10 17 June. *Make sure you use UTC/GMT because specific things like EST sometimes fail and give the wrong time As above, if someone misses a rule, i suggest you do not just ignore them, or say ""Skipped"" big capital letters (that looks like shouting). Write something like:     Skipped. Please reread the rules OR  Skipped. You deposited the wrong pokemon/level locked incorrectly/etc     Anyone who's gotten help: What advice do you have for people too nervous/proud/intimidated/otherwise unwilling to ask for assistance?   Dont be afraid to ask for help! People are willing to help those who help others.  In the past, I requested a tonne of cloning all the time. At times, i felt like i was being annoying, however a few of them mentioned they disliked the commitment of doing actual giveaways. Cloning for me, was their part in holding a giveaway. They could just sit there and keep sending me the pokemon in one hit, but i was the one ""stuck"" with reading the requests + wading through the gts on a  time limit, etc       OKay i think thats about it :3 If you would like me to clarify on anything, or ask me something else, just let me know :)"
CasualPokemonTrades,3a33na,Arcuslester,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:02:29 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for responding! I love how in depth you went about how you started and what challenged you at first.  Is it okay if I use direct quotes? (Credited of course).
CasualPokemonTrades,3a33na,burner_7,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry if i typed too much :3 Im sure there is other stuff i could suggest if i think about it a bit more, but ill just let you know if i do xD  And yep sure :D"
CasualPokemonTrades,3a33na,callmekite,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"What type(s) of giveaway(s) do you like hosting most?   Mostly I have given out shiny pokemon, most of the time being battle ready with appropriate stats and abilities (since most people want that nowadays), sometimes with matching balls just for aesthetic purposes, or to cater to more people (such as bank ball hunters). I prefer using the GTS since its more smooth and faster, and i find FC trading kind of a hassle, but low numbers are still bearable.  Items works if you want to relax a bit, since they're not as crowded as pokemon giveaways. Themed ones lets you be creative with your ideas. Mystery box giveaways are always a fun twist for everyone to join due to the surprise factor :)   What got you interested in holding giveaways? How did you start?   Originally i wanted to contribute back to the community since they have helped me with so much, and as i keep doing it, i get the hang of it and its pretty fun. First i start with evolutionary items, since i figured a lot of people are trying to complete their dexes. Then i go to megastones, since people seem to have a difficult time finding some of them, before moving on to pokemon giveaways. I start experimenting with the quantity given out as time goes on to make it more comfortable with my own pace.   What surprised you the most about hosting your first time? Is it still an issue?   People aren't really interested if you're not giving out 'good enough' stuff, probably due to the recent introduction of genning in Gen 6, so those such as breedjects might not be too popular.  The rudeness. There are just some people who demand things form you as if you're a machine with no feelings, and don't even bat an eye or give the slightest regard on the rules imposed - and then throw a tantrum when they got skipped. Some people will also harass you via PM to get more stuff.   Have you noticed the giveaway scene change since you started? (May also help to include when you started!) If so, how? Do these changes make it easier or harder for you to host?   I don't really have a long history on giveaways, but since i have lurked and participated for some time, I could say that the standard have risen up since the introduction of PkHex in Gen6. Stuff given out are more high quality, being shiny, BR, etc - an optimal combination to attract people, while before its either shiny or one of the choices available. There are also less people present nowadays, as before giveaways are always people bustling around and racing to get their hands on anything they can, but its more relaxed now, so its easier :)   Why do you continue to hold giveaways?What do you like about hosting? Dislike?   I find it fun to actually help people get what they need or want, as i know the feeling of getting something you have searched for so long. Since i have pretty much completed my shiny dex and stuff, i do giveaways as a form of game, trying to get one off each pokemon, kind of like a living dex thing :3 Sometimes its just a bit tiring when you don't feel like doing a giveaway, and you might have to keep up with people's expectations. Schedules are to be followed if you use one, in order not to disappoint people :/   Did you seek help at any point?   Sometimes, i ask a friend to help me make or edit a pokemon when i am unable to do so, and ask them for opinions regarding the ideas i have. Partners are a good addition if you want to have someone to help with the distribution and brainstorming.   What advice do you have for people wanting to get into giveaways?   Its okay to start small, and you will get better as you do it, as experience help you to adjust to the speed you're comfortable with. You can be as creative as you want with your ideas, and be careful with rude people - there is a big chance they will harass you. FC giveaways are not recommended if you are a beginner, as most people tend to be more ruthless and demanding in FC giveaways. Stricter rules might need to be imposed, and a lot of patience is required.   Partners, current or past: Would you recommend getting a giveaway partner to start out? Why? Why not?   Personally, I think it would be better to start solo to find your pace and things you're comfortable with, and proceed to find someone who is at the same page as you to become your partner if you ever need company.  With partners, you could divide the work between yourselves, with one person being in charge with one thing while the other takes on the other stuff. An extra hand is appreciated to help organize stuff, and social interaction keeps you from being lonely from the monotonous requests that could be dehumanizing. You need to have a good communication system if you're doing your plans with someone else as you have to move coordinately and adjust to unprecedented matters. You might want to keep a schedule as a reference platform for yourself and your partner in this case. Similar timezones also help greatly in rescheduling issues.   Anyone who's gotten help: What advice do you have for people too nervous/proud/intimidated/otherwise unwilling to ask for assistance?   Don't be afraid to reach out to other people, since most people here are friendly and would be more than willing to help you. You might just find a good friend while doing something you like :)"

You have a 50% chance of getting a female for every hatch. The first shiny hatch doesn't affect your second shiny hatch. It's like flipping a coin. Sometimes you get 3 heads in a row, maybe 4, maybe 5. You just gotta keep flipping (hatching) until you get the one you want :P"

CasualPokemonTrades,39m112,Arcuslester,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:09:05 2015 UTC,You can only get totodile in a diveball from transferring from pokemon Colosseum. Or hacking it a guess. Not counting the shinies it's the rarest thing I own :/
CasualPokemonTrades,39m112,Arcuslester,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"I see. Tbh imo its not really that rare since ball types can be modified according to wishes via PS, but it might matter to those who are immaculate about legitimacy stuff.   Anyways, good luck."

CasualPokemonTrades,39hhi0,callmekite,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:16:04 2015 UTC,I have one. Only pokemon I need right now is an Entei though :/ starting my first team.
CasualPokemonTrades,39hhi0,infineks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"What are the chances, I just gave away a Entei today. I think I still have another one- but it is tied up in a potential trade right now. Are you sure there is nothing else of interest to you?"
CasualPokemonTrades,39hhi0,infineks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:42:06 2015 UTC,"Regigas, Slaking, or Ho-oh.  I'm completely new to the game so I know nothing about rarity :S."
CasualPokemonTrades,39hhi0,infineks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry for my late reply, I was getting ready for and going to work. Now! It's fine that you're new. Right now we are on /r/casualpokemontrades so rarity does not count for much. Shiny pokemon, events and all sorts of cool stuff get exchanged here regularly, and usually under their worth- most stuff is actually given away.   This is because unlike /r/pokemontrades most things here are hacked and/or cloned. If they are the owner of the Pokemon must disclose the Pokemon as such, as per the rules. It is up to individual people in the trade to decide whether or not that's okay with them. Please note on /r/pokemontrades absolutely under no circumstances is it ever okay to trade hacks/clones even if you disclose it.  Whew. Okay. So my point being is that most Pokemon on this subreddit are traded very casually and do not have much ""value"" due to most not being legitimate. While they are still 100% safe to play with on your game, they were not obtained via normal gameplay means.  Sorry for the wall of text. If you have any questions let me know. I can definitely do a Slaking for a Delibird if you're comfortable with that. I may have a spare Ho-oh to give you as well, but I'm not sure."
CasualPokemonTrades,39hhi0,infineks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:48:42 2015 UTC,Ok :) Thanks for the info!!  My delibird is legit and very bad. I have to think about the trade a bit more because Delibird is one of my favorite Pokemon. Why do you want one? Because I could always go try and catch another :)
CasualPokemonTrades,39hhi0,infineks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"I'd like a Delibird for breeding purposes. If you'd like you could always breed one for me and keep yours. I'm just interested in it having EMs (egg moves).  You got the right idea, though. There's no set value for any Pokemon in any subreddit. Just go with your gut on what seems fair. Legitimate Pokemon are worth more, that's about it!"

CasualPokemonTrades,39gd83,Humminglady,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Most of them are ones you'll find in gen 5, since I'm not looking for many horde or friend safari pokemon."

CasualPokemonTrades,39cwfx,callmekite,2,Wed Jun 10 23:15:12 2015 UTC,I vote for a Tradeback Tuesday. It rolls off the tongue better and it isn't Tuesday anywhere yet so that's more fair. :9
CasualPokemonTrades,39cwfx,callmekite,2,Wed Jun 10 23:20:37 2015 UTC,Oh damn is Tradeback Tuesdays a thing?

CasualPokemonTrades,39cwfx,Xprmx12,2,Wed Jun 10 23:30:38 2015 UTC,Thanks. There's really just nothing going on. Breeding is boring...
CasualPokemonTrades,39cwfx,Xprmx12,2,Wed Jun 10 23:32:12 2015 UTC,How can it possibly be boring if you're living in the future (from me)?
CasualPokemonTrades,39cwfx,Xprmx12,2,Wed Jun 10 23:34:39 2015 UTC,Well no hover boards yet. So that's disappointing.
CasualPokemonTrades,39cwfx,NewMillennia,2,Wed Jun 10 23:38:00 2015 UTC,No hoverboards is a big bust for me. What about space/time travel?
CasualPokemonTrades,39cwfx,NewMillennia,2,Wed Jun 10 23:44:50 2015 UTC,Working on it. So far we're able to talk to people from the past.

The leader's tyrunt would have all the bites (poison, fire, ice, etc.) or a ledian with all the punches (mach, fire, dizzy, etc). Would be fun to try and win when the games wants you to lose.

CasualPokemonTrades,397i9s,DearKC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:07:13 2015 UTC,"I adore Espurr. In fact, I've been trying very hard to come up with a legit team centered around an Espurr. (Not even a meowstic, but an espurr) There would probably have to be ALOT of supports and walls for the espurr so I would use pokemons like a Shuckle to set up sticky web and stealth rocks first. I would have Kangashkan as my main damage tank since espurr can cover her fighting-type weakness. Since both of them are weak to Ghost, I would then get a dark type such as a Honchkrow or Bisharp. I'll stop there since the post is getting long and most gyms don't have a full team :P  Gym Badge would either be an outline of an espurr or a gym badge made to look like the eye of an espurr :DD you're not allowed to battle me without an espurr!!!  Final team: Espurr, Shuckle, Khangaskan, Honchkrow,   Black!"

Mightyena, granbull, stoutland, and arcanine would be the leaders team,  I think. With the 'Print Badge' as the prize, shaped like a paw print.
