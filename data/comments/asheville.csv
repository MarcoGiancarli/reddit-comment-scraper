Moog Fest was pretty amateurishly planed from the start, but if their talk meant anything youd think they would see it through and try to make it work   Beyond a tra­di­tional music fes­ti­val, Moogfest aims to be an engine for dri­ving eco­nomic devel­op­ment in West­ern North Car­olina … the long-term goal say Moogfest orga­niz­ers, ‘is to inspire big think­ing start-ups, entre­pre­neurs, and inno­va­tors to con­sider Asheville as a com­mu­nity to relo­cate their for­ward think­ing busi­nesses, just as Bob Moog did in 1978′…”"
asheville,3ds9xl,Froman1136,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:06 2015 UTC,They lost a lot of money. And they probably realized they would continue to do so every year. Their quote is just such BS because there's no way any of that would ever happen here.
asheville,3ds9xl,flopsflip,4,Sun Jul 19 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree.  Mike (current CEO) as always been the business man of Moog.  I assume that is why he was there before Bob's death; to balance the dreamer side of the organization. I had the pleasure to work with Bob and Mike and it was obvious what their roles were.  They were both good people but Mike was and is, I suspect; there to continue to keep Moog in the black.  Mike is aware of and is executing a very good plan that a lot of ""giving"" and ""caring"" businesses use.  Use the ""Care"" and ""Giving"" aspect to win support of the community and to make a profit.  Even though this is a good plan and is beneficial to the community while it is working; do not expect these businesses or Moog to continue this give and care tatic when they are loosing money.  They all will dump you like an old Boy Friend and move on.  As they should.  They are businesses.  They are not your sugar daddy or momma.  They exist to make money.  If they can make money by making Asheville a better place that's awesome.  IF they have to move somewhere else to make money and benefit a community; well that sucks for Asheville.  But don't kid yourself.   They are not going to continue to loose money out of they kindness of their hearts."
asheville,3ds9xl,stinkycheesefart,4,Mon Jul 20 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm of the school of thought that they booked a festival with bigger names than we have venues and thus lost that way. Ive been to plenty of festivals in smaller places than Asheville that work out financially. Their desire to go big outweighs their expressed commitment to the region.  I do think that its possible to get some music and arts related startups, but yeah it'd take significant efforts to just make it a possibility, something more than a music festival.   Im wondering if theyre spewing similar stuff to sell their festival to the folks in durham."
asheville,3ds9xl,Smash_4dams,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"Triangle Resident here. I have kind of kept my eye on this for awhile. Moogfest isn't promising Durham a thing. In fact, Durham doesn't need Moogfest since it's economy is doing very well at the moment. Moogfest was clearly motivated by the fact that there is more money to be made in Durham than Asheville.  Durham didn't even offer the same incentive as Asheville. I believe Durham only offered $50,000 to Moogfest, where Asheville offered up $150,000.  I don't believe this really has anything to do with Durham being desperate and listening to lies. Moogfest obviously sees that they would make a lot more money in Durham than Asheville."
asheville,3ds9xl,geekamongus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"Not at all. In fact it was the exact opposite. They blew a ton of money flying in a once prestigious group (Kraftwerk) that hadn't been relevant in 30 years and whom many Asheville residents in the ""scene"" had never heard of. They had to play in the basement of the Civic Center because they couldn't sell enough tickets to warrant the actual seated area. Adding a one-hit wonder (MIA) to the mix certainly didn't help. We definitely have the venues to make something happen.   Finding mid-to-large touring groups with electronic influences and large fanbases in their 20s and 30s really isn't that difficult, just look at the lineup they had in 2011, it sold really well because it packed in plenty of relevant acts that people pay money to see (flaming lips, beats antique, sts9, umphreys mcgee, passion pit, chromeo etc.)  They banked heavily on turning the entire festival into a SXSW tech expo overnight and failed horribly. It wasn't Asheville's fault, it was the promoters. Blaming the city is a pathetic excuse. People travel hours to see big musical acts here all the time."
