I've been trying to break down the tropes of city simulators and discovered that games like Sim City and Cities Skyline are all simulations of past cities in the 80s and 90s, and not really forward looking. In breaking these tropes down, I noticed that these games are all about simulating pseudo capitalistic societies that match modern day economies.

The green blob bullets are similarly meh.  The impact animation could stand to be bigger.  Other than that it looks like a good start.  Is that a hair drier used to levitate?  Pretty funny.

As you continue to make content you'll figure out a sort of design groove that fits the game and what things should look/feel like will become a bit more apparent.

gamedevscreens,3cixug,tomerbarkan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:52:15 2015 UTC,"Just use common controls in games like this (you can take XCom as a good example).  Some thing that pop to mind:   Automatically select a unit when a turn starts, and automatically switch to the next unit when a unit finishes its movement (player can still manually select another unit) Right click behavior after moving is a bit inconsistent and not intuitive (sometimes it cancels the move comand, sometimes it doesn't.

gamedevscreens,3c7xjb,wizbam,2,Sun Jul 5 19:30:17 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear your method on the color cycle!
gamedevscreens,3c7xjb,wizbam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:07:24 2015 UTC,"Well the base colour-cycle builds a palette for the texture and then replaces each colour with a grey-scale value which identifies its index in the palette. So if we have 3 colours the grey-scale image will have the grey colours 0, 0.5 and 1.  Next a shader cycles which colour in the palette corresponds to which grey-scale colour based on a time value that it is fed.  Finally the linear interpolation simply takes the current colour assignment and the next colour assignment and interpolates them based on it.  Code here: https://gist.github.com/wilbefast/a984348fbfbf5bc46e4e"

gamedevscreens,3c3qwl,trueyomic,2,Sat Jul 4 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"Explosions themselves look very nicely done.  Tank disappearing is really rough.  Two easy solutions:   In the final explosion, place 4 of them in such a way that it covers the tank  entirely.   or   Have the whole screen flash, preferably white, in the frame you remove the tank.   Either of these will be adequate smoke and mirrors while you remove the tank (maybe even both), making it less noticeable that the tank just disappears.  Little more visual satisfaction and a little less jarring.  Other than this minor gripe, everything about the tank's development has looked nice.  Good work, and have fun."
gamedevscreens,3c3qwl,SergeantIndie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:54:29 2015 UTC,Definitely need to add the white flash.  Plan on also having a blackend shell left behind as well.  Thanks for the suggestions and advice.

gamedevscreens,3ar6xw,BananaPotion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:45:10 2015 UTC,I would say the smooth particles look better. The pixelated effect seems out of place as the pixels are significantly larger than the pixels that make up the ships. The smooth one is much more consistent with the existing art style.
gamedevscreens,3ar6xw,Over9000Zombies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:14:34 2015 UTC,"The smooth one looks like a tiny explosion, the pixelated, not so, looks like a bloody splatter, plus fits with the retro vibe. I'd go with pixelated."
gamedevscreens,3aqj3s,CaptainSponge,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"That is a really nice particle affect if it is one, how is it made?"
gamedevscreens,3aqj3s,Templar3lf,2,Mon Jun 22 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"It is particle effect. Here is summary....  Create fire particle effect. Pretty Simple. Fade from orange to red. About half the lifetime of the smoke particle. Pretty consistent size all the way through.  Create smoke particle effect. Use a low poly mesh as the particle. Twice the lifetime as the particle. Start size of zero. Grow in size over time to be quite large, and then drop off the size to 0 again very quickly. Add some randomness."

gamedevscreens,3ad7zj,donwilson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:05:34 2015 UTC,Your blog is great! How do the clouds move when you go right?
gamedevscreens,3ad7zj,donwilson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"It's a parallax scrolling, a technique almost as old as video games   The clouds are divided into layers. Each layer (from front to far back) follow the player on every move (following the player object, i.e. move along x and y axis with the same values of player object's x & y). These values are multiplied by a float variable (between 0 and 1). I just have to chose a different variable for each layer (for example, 0.8 for the first one: it will move fast ; 0.05 for the last one and it will move very slowly).   I hope this explanation is understandable. :)"
gamedevscreens,3ad7zj,initials_games,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:31:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry I probably worded that incorrectly, I do know how the parallax effect works. :) I was just wondering if you decided to have the clouds move in the opposite direction if you move right or if they continue in the same direction. I wonder if making them not flow in one direction would make it look like they're ""rewinding"" instead of natural flowing clouds."
gamedevscreens,3ad7zj,flargenhargen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"OK, I understand now. Yes, for now the clouds move in the same direction than the player.   Maybe I could do something to mix the 2 ideas: having them flowing slowly in a direction, but if the player goes in the opposite direction, make it rewinding a little. I'll try that.  PS : I'm talking about the clouds in the screen's bottom. Those who are in the upper side move the same way, but they shouldn't. I'll make them independant of player's move."

gamedevscreens,3a9g7l,8-BitApe,2,Thu Jun 18 07:41:52 2015 UTC,"I decided on train home that it might be fun to try out a 3D menu screen. Was surprisingly simple to do. If you can use your imagination a little, I think this is how it may play out:   Menu Screen: Arched doorway with an endless corridor. When you select exit game, this is the door that you leave by Create Game Screen: The red object could be a bookcase that slides to the right revealing a secret compartment or something Join Game Screen: The green object would be a hanging picture above a fireplace. It could rotate on it's Y axis to reveal the game list Character Select Screen: Have a 'statue' version of in game characters in little arched recesses. When you select them, the character animates to life, and the archway is lit. Somehow think of a way to show that characters are already selected (different colour light, maybe have the character walk off?!) When all characters are selected and you select the Start Game button, the portcullis in front of you rises, the camera moves through the archway, climbs the stairs and pulls out above the game level. Buttons: These could be 3D buttons that are pushed out of the walls like big bricks or something.   If you have any other ideas would love to hear. Think it might be cool to give player a little bit of wiggle room at each menu, so they can move camera around a bit."

gamedevscreens,38w0k1,ErrA7126,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:23:05 2015 UTC,"Hey man, that looks damn sweet! I love how you're able to control the spells. Do you have a Twitter account I can follow, where I can track progress? :)   Keep up the good work"
gamedevscreens,38w0k1,Minibo,2,Sun Jun 7 08:48:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks man. I post my updates to my site, www.seandev.co.za , I haven't actually thought of using my twitter, since thats more easily reachable, so from now on I'll post a tweet of when I update my site :) My Twitter"
gamedevscreens,38w0k1,Minibo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:54:51 2015 UTC,"I just followed on Twitter, I'm looking forward to the updates :)   If you want someone testing some new features out, or just the game in general, then throw me a message. I will be happy to help you out :)  Keep up the good work"
gamedevscreens,38r19j,mzn528,4,Sat Jun 6 02:09:37 2015 UTC,Just plain awesome!
gamedevscreens,38r19j,Vic-Boss,2,Sat Jun 6 02:10:10 2015 UTC,Thanks Vic-Boss!
gamedevscreens,38r19j,ThunderHam,3,Sat Jun 6 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"Dam looks amazing, great frame rate too"
gamedevscreens,38r19j,Kaerigan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:54:35 2015 UTC,"haha thanks thunderham, gotta throw in all those frames"
gamedevscreens,38r19j,RembrandtEpsilon,3,Sat Jun 6 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"I like it, except for that little jump he does when he's all glowy and stuff. Looks silly to me."
gamedevscreens,38r19j,mtwara,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:33:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the good word Kaerigan. Yeah I agree it needs some adjustment since this is two separate sprites joining together
gamedevscreens,38r19j,mtwara,2,Sat Jun 6 17:28:34 2015 UTC,looks fucking awesome! I love the notion of transformations. Is it a temporary transform? How does it work? What game you working on?
gamedevscreens,38r19j,kaspyre,2,Sat Jun 6 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the good word RembrandtEpsilon!! This is a game I am working on called Soul Appeaser. It is a ARPG with responsive combat and dark themed story. Complete Dev Log here Basically, the character can retrieve the memory of the dead in the form of the soul crystal. He does not have ability to fight and therefore uses the soul crystal to transform to a combat form (there are a lot of them) in combat areas."
gamedevscreens,38r19j,Just-A-City-Boy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:35:07 2015 UTC,This is really awesome. It's so smooth and pretty. Nicely done!

gamedevscreens,38n1dk,twistedshield,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:23:47 2015 UTC,"Cool. Damn ceiling laser boss thing got me. I noticed the cracks start to appear, but a health bar would be better."
gamedevscreens,38n1dk,zut50,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:15:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I'm really trying to avoid a health bar all together for the bosses, so I'll do some extra work to see where I can give more feedback regarding how well you're doing against them. I guess worst case I can add the health bar in, but if I can find a way around it then I'll definitely take that approach."
gamedevscreens,38n1dk,KawaiiCub,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"Had fun for a bit, but yeah your wall glitch is still in the game as that's what ended my run."
gamedevscreens,3883vw,SolsticeBas,3,Tue Jun 2 15:04:27 2015 UTC,It's Kirbyish!
gamedevscreens,3883vw,Lepord829371,4,Tue Jun 2 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it was intentional :D"
gamedevscreens,3883vw,Lepord829371,2,Wed Jun 3 07:48:55 2015 UTC,Its adorable. Good bouncing too!
gamedevscreens,3883vw,LordTocs,2,Wed Jun 3 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot :D  We have recently put up a new post in the r/indiegames subreddit, showing off Blue Blob's offensive spike: http://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/38doou/our_cute_little_blue_blob_has_definitely_grown_a/  As you seem interested, I thought I'd tell you :-)"
gamedevscreens,3883vw,LordTocs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"Suggestion: Turn on anisotropic filtering on the ground texture, it'll look much better. That brick pattern is like the poster child of mip mapping problems."
gamedevscreens,37y1xu,machinaea,3,Sun May 31 10:33:58 2015 UTC,This is gorgeous. Keep up the good work!
gamedevscreens,37y1xu,BlueBombadier,1 point,Sun May 31 23:49:06 2015 UTC,"Cheers, will do our best!"
gamedevscreens,37y1xu,Giraffestock,2,Mon Jun 1 09:18:40 2015 UTC,"Looks super good so far, great job"

gamedevscreens,37rbww,BennFried,2,Fri May 29 19:40:50 2015 UTC,looks interesting
gamedevscreens,37rbww,KittenSAdv,2,Fri May 29 20:07:37 2015 UTC,This would be a cool home screen on my fire phone
gamedevscreens,37rbww,SaltTM,1 point,Fri May 29 21:09:37 2015 UTC,That is pretty neat. Does it have any other worthwhile features tho? I've been hearing that it has not been well received.
gamedevscreens,37rbww,manfly,2,Sat May 30 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"Well personally, the main reason I bought it was because it was 100 bucks.  100 for the phone, 100 for amazon prime (they claim 200 + amazon prime for free for a year) - I'm not even sure if these are unique features, but you can technically point the phone at things such as tv or objects and it's supposedly able to identify the object or tv show or person on the tv, etc... sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.   Same with audio, audio works better than expected.  Then it has your general apple feature w/ siri, but it lacks a database of understanding.  Best usage is to ask it to open apps for you after holding the home button or googling something for you.  As a phone alone though, it's fully unlocked so if you're in need of a phone w/ decent features as email, calendar, texting, phone, browsing the web it's a good for the amount of money you spend, but if you're expecting an app experience, it's not the greatest because google play store isn't out the box and as of recently I've had trouble using google play store.  tl;dr - decent phone for the price, but it's an amazon product they want you to use their services for most things (especially apps, so your favorite google apps aren't here w/out installing the play store)"
gamedevscreens,37rbww,SaltTM,2,Sat May 30 00:37:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for the reply. Basically it sounds like they've got some great ideas and features, they just need to be polished up and refined a bit more."
gamedevscreens,37rbww,manfly,1 point,Sat May 30 00:44:40 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool.  Wonder if there is an easy way to make home screens.
gamedevscreens,37o39y,skeledurr,1 point,Fri May 29 01:49:20 2015 UTC,I would love to see your code for this.  It's genius!  What game are you using it for?
gamedevscreens,37o39y,CaptainSponge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:09:00 2015 UTC,Thanks really appreciate it!  The path finding is for my passion project which is kinda on the back burner at the moment because of game jams and starting a new  mobile game. I'll come back to it soon though. You can read about it here: http://skeledurr.net/post/120007682109/bone-crush-1-the-project-and-spherical  When I get the chance I will also put up a download link for the code.
gamedevscreens,37o39y,CaptainSponge,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:46:52 2015 UTC,Hey sorry for the long delay in response! I quickly packed up the code so you can check it out.   Download it here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOD-2nFEOPRfmN4eGJoNlpGY1FWaURERl9DOW5ydURHc2h0cm5vS2FubkpvQmxrd2VuR0U&authuser=0

gamedevscreens,37mhre,Silverwolf_PH,1 point,Thu May 28 23:16:18 2015 UTC,SnaAaaAakee! SnaaAaaAakee! I miss that video.
gamedevscreens,37mhre,KittenSAdv,2,Thu May 28 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Loving the speed and flow of the game. Seriously awesome, where can we stay up to date on it?"
gamedevscreens,37jyt1,bgirard,2,Thu May 28 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is a massive resolution... and here I am coding on a 15"" Toshiba only capable of 1366x768. Lol. How much has your productivity improved because of that?"
gamedevscreens,37jyt1,Zanetski,2,Thu May 28 04:40:28 2015 UTC,"For Java it's really helped me to be able to easily fit the client+server console at once (bottom), the main coding area in Eclipse, the variable watch window (top right), breakpoints and the process list all at once (bottom right). Plus I can see a ton of the project tree on the left hand side.   I'd say an easy 25% increase in productivity. However I have keep my head close to the monitor because of the tiny fonts so I only get enough field of view of cover that single monitor. I couldn't dual monitor this without exessive head movement. The laptop serves as my second monitor but it's only for references and distractions since it requires me to look over."

gamedevscreens,37g6ah,twistedshield,1 point,Wed May 27 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"I apologize if you're not looking for advice but you may want to make the things that shoot blink rapidly in a quickening pace to indicate that they will shoot. Otherwise though, pretty good. Everything else was fairly solid in mechanics."
gamedevscreens,37g6ah,ulstdp,1 point,Wed May 27 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment, advice is always welcome! :) I think you're right about the flashing (or at least some sort of animation). That way the player has no doubt about what's about to happen. I also want to add some more animations (especially on the 'arms' linking all the parts together), but I think I will wait until I get some new art in there first, since it's still all placeholder art for now."
gamedevscreens,37g6ah,ulstdp,2,Wed May 27 23:32:14 2015 UTC,Understood. Good job so far though.
gamedevscreens,37g6ah,bgirard,1 point,Thu May 28 00:56:58 2015 UTC,Looks fun :D
