Curry,3dja2i,Kaleaon,3,Thu Jul 16 18:48:40 2015 UTC,Here seems kinda cheap.   http://importfood.com/spws0101.html
Curry,3dja2i,brazosrr,3,Thu Jul 16 19:00:45 2015 UTC,Where in central IL?
Curry,3dja2i,PeaceTank,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:23:57 2015 UTC,Near Peoria area is about the best I can do to describe where I live.
Curry,3dja2i,PeaceTank,3,Thu Jul 16 23:34:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, can't help then.  I'm down in Chambana and I can find it at our local asian grocery stores.  Not sure where anything like that would be in Peoria.  Good luck!."
Curry,3dja2i,drshoebocks,2,Fri Jul 17 02:00:16 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Curry,3dja2i,drshoebocks,2,Fri Jul 17 02:05:07 2015 UTC,I get them here in Chicago.
Curry,3dja2i,drshoebocks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:59:50 2015 UTC,Where at? Only places I know of are the spice house in Evanston
Curry,3bqugf,brazosrr,3,Wed Jul 1 12:21:12 2015 UTC,Fantastic. I was hoping this place would clean up.  I hope you enjoy your new duties.
Curry,3bqugf,SirFrancisDashwood,4,Wed Jul 1 16:09:12 2015 UTC,Excellent. I was going to unsubscribe.
Curry,3bqugf,curry_fiend,5,Wed Jul 1 16:30:33 2015 UTC,"Im actually really happy about this, about time we started talking about food again."
Curry,3bqugf,maerad,2,Wed Jul 1 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll start using the report function again - it was useless before."
Curry,3bqugf,jamin_brook,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"Haha, my bad guys!  I'm definitely guilty of the ""(Steph) Curry"" posts in this sub.  I think that two things will happen from now on.  1) /u/aalamb will moderate the sub  2) /u/aalamb will likely not have much work in terms of purging Steph Curry posts, because they Hype (i.e. GSW in the NBA finals) is dying out pretty quickly .   Also by the way, I bet a significant fraction of the 'invaders' came from /r/warriors too.   The thing about it is that I love Curry (food) too!  So I will actually stay subbed here to see if I can pick out any tips/tricks.   Best from /r/nba and /r/warriors"
Curry,3bqugf,red_chips,-3,Wed Jul 1 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"Can you add a link to /r/warriors in the sidebar for people who would like to discuss the more well known Curry, so there isn't confusion?  Also why did you arbitrarily ban 'hate speech' and other forms of incivility, when those were never a problem in this sub? I realize that stuff is bad, but so are a lot of other things you didn't feel the need to explicitly call out in the sidebar."
Curry,3bqugf,red_chips,-1,Sun Jul 5 09:28:22 2015 UTC,"First: Maybe. I'll toss the idea around a bit and decide. I'm not fundamentally opposed to the idea, but I'm honestly not convinced that it's necessary. Player subs are very uncommon in my experience, I really question how often people come here genuinely looking for discussion of the player. The invasion was an invasion, there was no confusion.   Also, ""the more well-known Curry"", really? Very funny. A billion or so Indians probably disagree. The world outside of American basketball fans exists.  Second: I banned hate speech because the rules I put into place are intended to be comprehensive. Off the cuff, I disagree with your assessment that there are other types of objectively ""bad posts"" that I missed. The on-topic rule is very sweeping, and I think takes care of the vast majority of it. I agree that I don't anticipate actually having to enforce rule 2 in the forseeable future, but as I said, rules are intended to be comprehensive."
Curry,3aji9z,yorgs,2,Sat Jun 20 20:22:44 2015 UTC,the end dish looks great but quantities would be really helpful
Curry,3aji9z,TheRandomMan,2,Sat Jun 20 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"I totally just wing it, it means each curry turns out slightly different to the other, but that's all the excitement :)"
Curry,3aji9z,Papa_Jeff,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"Gonna make a beef curry tomorrow, what spices did you use?"
Curry,3aji9z,brazosrr,2,Mon Jun 29 23:21:29 2015 UTC,"I dry roast Cumin and Coriander seeds, dried chili and cardamom pods, then grind them in pestle and mortar.  Then when adding the spices to the actual curry I also add ground chili, turmeric and some garam masala also a stick of cinnamon.  Then once I add stock and start simmering, I add some curry leaves and bay leaves.  Let me know how it turns out :)"
Curry,3aji9z,brazosrr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:04:50 2015 UTC,Did you use all the cilantro?
Curry,3aji9z,brazosrr,2,Mon Jun 22 20:52:00 2015 UTC,Yip !
Curry,350gi0,thecomplainian,3,Wed May 6 02:00:07 2015 UTC,"You can go Thai style with lemongrass, garlic, shallots, ginger, galangal, Chinese style red chile paste, lime leaves.  Or you can make up a curry powder without coriander:  1 Tb turmeric 1 Tb cumin seed 2 tsp fenugreek seed 2 tsp red chile flakes 1 tsp fennel seed 1 tsp caraway seed 1 tsp mustard seed 1/2 tsp cardamom seed 1/2 tsp black peppercorns   Toast the seeds on medium-low  heat, shaking the pan often, till the spices turn color and get fragrant.  Grind in a spice mill or pestle, then add the tumeric."
Curry,350gi0,Cdresden,2,Wed May 6 11:40:05 2015 UTC,"Hey! As someone who hails from the Bengali descent, I can tell you that you can make your own ""garam masala"" (literally: hot spices, but it is a spice blend that you can purchase or make your own to use in Indian curries). I typically follow my late gram's recipe: cloves, cinnamon, black peppercorns, cardomom (without the green husk) and bay leaves, dry roasted and powdered to a fine consistency. You can adjust the ratios of spices as you see fit.  EDIT (to add) Also, coriander seeds or cilantro seeds or leaves are mostly used in North Indian and other Asian cuisines, all you have to do it omit the ingredient all together. Cilantro has this slightly tangy, earthy taste which is hard to replace but if you want to come close to it, use ""amchoor"" or powdered mango to add a bit of tang to your Indian curries."
Curry,350gi0,pastaalacarbonara,1 point,Thu May 7 00:45:30 2015 UTC,"Just leave the coriander out, you may or may not notice it, but there are certainly other more important flavors, namely cumin, in curries that will be front and center and will taste like it is in fact curry.   My go to mix  Cumin Cardamom  Fenugreek leaves and seeds Cinnamon  Clove Turmeric   Add a spice element and some ginger/garlic/ caramelized onions and you won't even realize there's no coriander."
Curry,350gi0,Chahles88,1 point,Wed May 6 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help!  I don't think I'll be able to get any Fenugreek leaves though, I live on an island in eastern Canada and we don't really have much in the way of ""exotic"" groceries. I had almost given up hope on even finding the seeds, but I did manage to get my hands on some and now I'm super excited to eat curry again!"
Curry,350gi0,Chahles88,1 point,Wed May 6 04:12:11 2015 UTC,Give it a shot! Absolutely worth a try
Curry,350gi0,JudgeJay,1 point,Wed May 6 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"You can buy stuff like that online, if you consider cooking delicious home made food a bit of a hobby then the cost is not significant!"
