ShittyAnimalFacts,3e0rl4,JohnnyWhiteguy,4,Tue Jul 21 11:44:16 2015 UTC,"They share common ancestor. Trashpandas developed in urban environments whereas Catsnakes developed in rural areas. Over time they evolved into two separate species. However, the Catsnakes became jealous of the Trashpandas and in order to gain attention they began innovation fashion in the animal kingdom. The two species became bitter rivals but are currently at peace choosing to coexist rather than spill any more blood.   To learn more join us at r/trashpandas and r/raccoons."

The only difference is that Sperm whales are enormous creatures and hence have correspondingly sized navigation organs. Due to the sheer size of these organs they need to be ""reset"" every two weeks or so. What is pictured here is the resetting period, which can last anywhere from two to six hours.   Interesting fact: During this reset time the whales are completely blind and will hum to themselves to soothe their anxiety."
