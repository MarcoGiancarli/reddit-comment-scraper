neopets,3e2o4x,ferventfish,2,Tue Jul 21 20:58:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah why does JN have to speak for TNT and announce stuff that should be news on the Neopets site first:  ""Due to the fact that Trudy's Surprise awards Neopoints, users cannot take part in it as a daily activity on side accounts. Since the slot machine automatically awards a prize the first time you visit Neopets on a given day with any account, it is impossible to avoid receiving the prize at least once (which The Neopets Team is willing to overlook). However, after this, you should select the Block Trudy's Surprise option in the Site Preferences of all but your main account. You are free to keep any prizes you may have received during this process."""

The second thing you're asking for is something I'll need to do retroactively, once I've collected data for all 25 days.  I do wonder if ones chances of receiving a gift box decreases noticeably after recieving a giftbox in a rotation. I don't think it would , but if it did, i'd respect Jumpstart aa whole lot  more than I do now.

neopets,3e1n25,TubOfSoda,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:32 2015 UTC,"Try to always hold back 10% of your winnings. Just write down 10% of how much you earn each day, add it up and always hold back that amount. Trust me, 10% is so little you're barely going to notice it, but in just 10 days you have the earnings of one day saved up! Works with real money, too."

I've just returned to Neo after a several year absence and have no recollection of this happening or being a common way to make NP. It's also quite possible I was just super oblivious and unaware that it went on though so who knows."
neopets,3e1n25,misshawk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"Food Club started on October 23, 2001. :)"
neopets,3e1n25,-cupcake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:45 2015 UTC,Was there a time where there was more than one round a day? Or did it start at a higher number than 1? Because 5920 rounds would be 16 years.
neopets,3e1n25,Shikogo,3,Tue Jul 21 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"Don't know. There's really only solid records of the winners and corresponding round #s since January 2009 (from daqtools), but Food Club was introduced and announced to ""be played at 2pm every day, the first one starting tomorrow"" on October 22nd 2001 and the next day on Oct 23rd before the round ended they added trophies and a high-score table ""in preparation for the huge amount of Neopoints you are all going to win""."
neopets,3e1n25,-cupcake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:33 2015 UTC,It's so weird. That's around the time I first started playing and I played for years. Then I stopped playing for ages and when I came back late last year was the first time I'd heard of it. I guess it wasn't really much of a money maker in the beginning so it wasn't very popular.
neopets,3e1n25,Casey--,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:52:30 2015 UTC,"I think Hugo has been doing it for ~6 years, so at least that long. It's probably been done longer.

neopets,3e43g1,thejokerlaughsatyou,5,Tue Jul 21 20:19:12 2015 UTC,"This person has been randomly sending me cheap items about once a week. A couple weeks ago it was a raspberry jelly. I had just posted something here about not getting a high score because the site was down, so I thought maybe it was someone from the sub sending me random sorrow food. Then, a few days later, they sent me something else. And then something else. It's never consistently the same type of item, or even how many days between items.   I'm so confused. Normally I would Neomail them, but with all the weird stuff that's been happening with the site, I don't want to mess with messages (even though I have plain-text mail enabled). I don't want to go to their lookup or anything that might compromise my account. Normally I'm not suspicious on Neo, but after so many people being hacked, this seems weird to me.   Anyone know who this is? Is it someone from the sub? Or has this happened to anyone else?"

He says he gives his girlfriend lots of gifts... well, I'm not his girlfriend, so I'm not sure how I'm getting anything.

As much as it's the current trend to hate on them, and whilst it's important they fix issues, I'm still unsure that we should be all abandoning ship. They're desperately trying to update a site that's probably about 10 years out of date itself, and that unfortunately will affect a lot of us. The best thing to be, for yourself if no one else, is patient, but that doesn't mean to lay down! Just be polite, patient but stern and it'll be a more pleasant experience to deal with.  tl;dr: Basically it's just making the best of a shit sandwich."

neopets,3e1no9,anxioususul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:32:20 2015 UTC,It auto-giving a prize even if you don't click it sounds like a bug to me.
neopets,3e1no9,thegirlwhocannotfly,4,Tue Jul 21 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know what to do about this either - I find the whole system of ""side"" accounts really irritating because they don't make it super clear what you can and can't do in these situations in a place more accessible than an editorial some 3 years ago or something. I also only found out from Jellyneo that you can't send the free NC Mall cupcake things to your main to use, but you can trade them with other users? It's really confusing to me.       I've been onto my side once since the Trudy thing started but I'm too worried to go on again as it awards the prizes automatically. I just need to check that my pets are still in the lodge and are doing ok! They should have just allowed us to make more pets on one account, or create the option to have a specialised 'side' account linked to your main for this very reason. Also (I'm nearly done I promise) the amount of people I see who have fully stocked shops on every single one of their side accounts is quite high - I don't report them because I think it is a bit petty to, but it's kind of an unfair advantage."
neopets,3e1no9,anxioususul,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:20 2015 UTC,"What? You can't send the cupcake to your main, for reals? LAME."
neopets,3e1no9,thegirlwhocannotfly,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"Copied and pasted from Jellyneo: This freebie may be claimed on side accounts. Due to a clarification in the Editorial last year, any cupcakes claimed on your sides should not be traded to your main account to use.    You may, however, trade for additional cupcakes from other users to use on your own pet, and of course, you may trade away cupcakes with the use of a Gift Box."
neopets,3e1no9,Franseil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I was waiting for GBC's to go on sale so I could trade from my sides to my main (I have some NC on my sides). Guess I won't be doing that!

neopets,3dy0ed,jolandado,9,Mon Jul 20 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"That's derogatory though, isn't it? She's damning the Dark Faeries!   I also remember Sloth referring to ""damnable Faeries"" shortly before Adam and Donna passed the baton to Viacom. And a whole Editorial response about how they didn't think ""damn"" and ""hell"" were bad and blah blah blah individual parental standards and other such maudlin crap.  I don't think it was the derogatory use of ""damn"" and ""hell"" that was forbidden so much as derogatory use of any word was forbidden. Because fighting on the Neoboards is bad, regardless of language."
neopets,3dy0ed,Superkouza,9,Mon Jul 20 13:51:53 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I feel like the filters do more harm than good.

Then they arbitarily changed the rules and suddenly it was not allowed anymore. Most of my warnings were received by me using the word ""damn"" since I was used to always using it- even on the neoboards.   Mostly since ""damn"" is only really considered a swear word in the US. Anywhere else it is just a word. I would be allowed to say damn in schools, damn on the bus, damn anywhere without getting random looks."

I can't do a screenshot since I am on mobile but make sure you pick the pirate from the drop down menu and then click the checkbox to the left of their name.

neopets,3dz6z9,Franseil,2,Mon Jul 20 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"According to JN, it runs in 25 day cycles. So I don't think it matters what your start day is, as long as you don't miss a day in the cycle (in which case it restarts).  editing to add: The way it works is that your prize money increases with every consecutive day you play. So if you have to keep restarting during week 1, you aren't going to miss out on much. But I imagine it would be super annoying to miss day 20, for example, and go back to day 1."

neopets,3dz6z9,kaeorin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"I thought about this, but I think what's more important than linking the prizes to bad luck bonuses is to find the predictability with which you'll get certain prizes.

neopets,3e09ve,cloysterbell,3,Tue Jul 21 00:25:50 2015 UTC,When I got my first FFQ I wanted pastel too! I chose water instead because it's a similar color profile but a little easier to customize with!  I also have a desert draik :)  There customs aren't the best I've done because I wanted to use some of my new items! I mostly like both of them because of their eyes! I wanted a grey draik for a really long time but I found it hard to find versatile customizations!  Best of luck in whatever you choose!
neopets,3e09ve,awry_lynx,2,Mon Jul 20 23:45:25 2015 UTC,I considered water as well but I have a maractite draik and they're so similar. Danaely looks beautiful though. :D I love the blue and rose gold. & I like the way you tied in the water with the daisy in Callery's customization.  I also have a shadow draik but he's one of the two non female pets I have haha.   I still really like the grey draiks but they just look so sad all the time... which I realize is the point... but still!

I'm a pretty big fan of stealthy but mostly because I had the Brynn wig and I really loved the contrast between the blue and oranges.   But if you're stuck between those four colors, I say either gray or chocolate. Pastel and eventide are hard to customize and, in my opinion, never look all that great. Grays and chocolates have a lot of options and can look fantastic if done well."

neopets,3dyw95,daringfeline,8,Mon Jul 20 17:34:54 2015 UTC,There was that time about a month ago when I spun the wheel of extravagance and the wheel of misfourtune at the same time and this happened. About 5 years ago I rejected a fountain faerie quest thinking it was a water faerie (it was 3 am) I realized what I had done immediately but it was too late. Another time (also in the middle of the night) I accidentally priced all the codestones in my shop (probably about 20 of them) at 1-3 np when I was trying to remove them.  Moral of the story: I am exceedingly stupid in the middle of the night. I hope this made you feel a bit better!  edit: The same thing as what happened to you happened to me too a little while back- thankfully I was able to fix the items before too many were bought. I think this might be a glitch that happens sometimes when someone buys something from your shop while you're pricing- it causes all the prices to shift.

In the spirit of passing on good cheer, I moved all the extras to my inventory to drop into the money tree.  Except I donated all of the items I needed to complete the charity corner that day as well.  I decided it wasn't worth dropping another ~4M on the items I needed, so I bailed on the day.

I managed to get a talisman bead and a petpetpet in random events.  However, I didn't know about the trading post or auctions yet. I thought the only way to sell was through my shop. I was super stoked to get 99,999np for both items, until I found the trading post and realized that I could have sold the bead for 1.5mil and the petpet for 3mil."

Well, not considering the Neo-economy, I saw that the Faerie PB had PLUMMETED in value... So I said well, it's not worth as much as it was, I'll use it.   I should mention at this time that my hiatus was years long, and the conversion of Neopets happened in this time. I didn't notice because my pets didn't really look that different, they weren't very special.   I googled Faerie pets and thought the Faerie Pteri was great!! It's glorious pose and all.  ... So I painted one...   and that was when I learned about the conversion."

I decided to abandon the quest because I was feeling lazy and didn't want to go look up the item, and it was close to the next day so I could just wait a little while and do the next one.  I didn't realize until about two days later that the grey faerie can call on the fountain faerie to reward you. The only REASON I've been doing the quests was to try and get a ffq. whoops."

Plus I suspect that people just prefer customizing female pets, though that could be because there aren't enough masculine wearables, and then the cycle continues."

I'd have the  home page open and open a new tab for my inventory, and without clicking Trudy's, I got 3k NP on each account. So, I spun the wheel to get it to go away and won 3k NP but my NP never went up after spinning because I was awarded the NP just by logging on.

They state many times to watch out for scams like that, and it sucks that people have found a way to mask their shell accounts, but TNT shouldn't have to change the limit and fuck up the entire economy for everyone to save a few people (esp. when the scammers have hopefully been frozen now)"
neopets,3dwu6x,xxabbadabbadooxx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"So what do you propose being the safest way to buy and sell items that are most expensive than auction limits?  And pardon my ignorance but how would it fuck up the economy (not being a dick to try to pick apart your argument, just genuinely curious)."
neopets,3dwu6x,everythingshines,3,Mon Jul 20 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"You can also trade extremely high valued items for several (up to 10) items which add to equal value, and repeat until you hit auctionable prices for pure.  The other way around for buying very high value things. It's not perfect, but it's much safer thank junk trades / auctions to make up the price - with junk trades someone has to trust someone not to be a scammer and unfortunately that opens them up to risk (if the person buying offers first, the person with the item can just accept on the junk trade and not on the high value item)."
neopets,3dwu6x,facegasm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"The same way as mentioned, except the seller accepts money for the junk items FIRST, before putting the last auction up :) And because without the upper limit, some higher priced items would inflate above it. The limit keeps them at it, or below. I'm not sure how the trading post would help though. Idk I just think without the limit, expensive items would become extra expensive items. edit: and I know hehe, I can tell you don't have a mean tone, it's nice to have someone to just debate things with nicely :P"
neopets,3dwu6x,xxabbadabbadooxx,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:16 2015 UTC,The problem with this is that the person buying has to trust that YOU are going to put the last item for auction.  There's always going to be a huge risked involved for either of the two parties.
neopets,3dwu6x,everythingshines,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah but as the holder of the item, when you agree to their offer, you are agreeing to sell the item for that price, and as you want to sell the item to get NP instead, that's what you do. The largest amount of NP should always be on the actual item I guess.. But at the end of the day when you're selling/buying an item for 50m plus, you're both gonna need to trust each other. I haven't heard of many scams that way round though. It's mostly scamming to get the item rather than NP. Probably because score senders can farm NP."
neopets,3dwu6x,xxabbadabbadooxx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"But when you agree to buy an item, you are agreeing to pay that price and if you want to give up your points for an item instead, that's what you do.  There's no good way of looking at this, there's always a huge amount of trust you have to place on another user that you may or may not even know.  While I agree that you're right, it usually just happens the one way, it doesn't mean it can't happen the other.  We shouldn't be forced to trust faceless users to buy or sell items."
neopets,3dwu6x,everythingshines,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"How else would we do it? That's the way the economy works. And tbh, a lookup is someone's face on neo.

neopets,3dwu6x,xxabbadabbadooxx,3,Mon Jul 20 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they could fix it if they wanted to. :("
neopets,3dwu6x,everythingshines,2,Mon Jul 20 12:11:25 2015 UTC,Wait so do you prefer bidding on a junk item and never receiving the item you pay for or do you prefer sending the item first and the person never bidding on your junk item?  There is always going to be risk with one side or the other when selling or buying an item that is over auction limit.
neopets,3dwu6x,AngelicZero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read further down and realized that these people were selling stuff over the auction limit. I thought they were selling say a plushie PB and then let someone convince them it was ok to just send the item over and they'd pay them when they got it. Personally I would rather never even own something that expensive. It seems like the richer you get the more people wanna f up the game for you.  I can't understand why people do this crap. I know people are selling the things they steal from us for RL money but it's not like they can pay rent like this so why even do it? Why not just let everyone enjoy the freaking game."
neopets,3dwu6x,Veyrmon,10,Mon Jul 20 15:03:38 2015 UTC,"Slightly unrelated question, sorry if it's been asked or explained before, but why don't they just raise the NP limit for TP? If it's to avoid people getting hacked and losing all their money, then maybe require a pin when trading over a certain amount? It seems a little unnecessary to cap the TP and Auction prices :/"
neopets,3dwu6x,metalmario1337,16,Mon Jul 20 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"What they really need to do is raise the shop price limit.  Shops should be for items you want an exact amount of NP for, as high as you want. 1 billion? Sure, if someone has it/will pay it. Trades should be items for items. Maybe some np to even out rough values. Auctions should be for when you don't know what price you want, so you let buyers bid it out.  It is such a huge pain in the ass to buy things for over 2m. There's such a quick and easy fix!"
neopets,3dwu6x,everythingshines,3,Mon Jul 20 06:46:27 2015 UTC,This is such a great answer.
neopets,3dwu6x,Veyrmon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I actually didn't think of such an obvious solution of also removing the restriction for shops. It's been like that since the beginning and no one really questioned it. It would seem like such a simple solution to make our lives easier. It's pointless to list something on TP when you know exactly how much you want for it, not to mention it taking up a space in your inventory."
neopets,3dwu6x,chibisan352,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"They have raised the limit for the TP from 800k to 2m recently. TNT has this weird notion that the Trade Post should only be used for trades, so I don't think they'll ever raise that limit again. If they unlimited the auction's limits though, it would keep a lot of this kind of stuff from happening."
neopets,3dwu6x,firelow,25,Mon Jul 20 17:18:23 2015 UTC,Isn't it common sense to not believe someone when they say they're going to do something like this?
neopets,3dwu6x,TubOfSoda,9,Mon Jul 20 12:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right, but some people are willing to trust others at face value, and apparently that can be faked now, so just thought I'd warn everyone again. :(  It's rather sad that someone took advantage of people like this."

neopets,3dwu6x,Marble_Shell,4,Mon Jul 20 05:00:43 2015 UTC,Yeah it seems like the trading post really should not force users to sell expensive items this way.

neopets,3dwu6x,captainflyte,3,Mon Jul 20 05:15:35 2015 UTC,It would be nice if TNT would take the limits off of the auctions to prevent situations such as this from occurring.

neopets,3dwu6x,Veyrmon,3,Mon Jul 20 05:59:34 2015 UTC,"Cause the items were worth multiple millions, and the trade post limit is only 2m. :( It isn't possible to use the trades for something that expensive."
neopets,3dwu6x,SmilkySmoofFur,3,Mon Jul 20 07:10:46 2015 UTC,So I understand that the scam was that they placed a junk item for a lot and promised a big item or the other way around. Why not just post the big item for auction?
neopets,3dwu6x,TenderRain,3,Mon Jul 20 12:05:52 2015 UTC,"No the scam was that they promised a ton of neopoints for an item, and never bid the neopoints.  The big item (at least in the case of the Illusens Staff that was scammed)  was worth more than the auction limit. So it wouldn't have been possible to post it for the full amount anyway."
neopets,3dwu6x,TenderRain,4,Mon Jul 20 12:07:57 2015 UTC,Ok so why not just place the big item for auction instead of a junk item?
neopets,3dwu6x,TenderRain,3,Mon Jul 20 12:13:11 2015 UTC,"If the item is over the auction limit, like  the IStaff, you just can't put one auction up. It's not possible, there has to be some kind of junk trade/auction or item trade involved in order to transfer the rest of the points.  The others, I don't even know why they agreed to go with the ""buyer's"" requests, but I'm just trying to warn people not to trust people they don't know who are trying to convince them to do this kind of trade."

neopets,3dwu6x,Stratager,3,Mon Jul 20 09:05:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the warning!  Although, could you explain this part?   And asked them to do a junk auction, but to let them have the item first.   Why couldn't a direct trade occur? O: I'm noob and I've never heard of this kind of situation. From context I'm assuming the price is too high?"
neopets,3dwu6x,LOLZlata,3,Mon Jul 20 12:04:56 2015 UTC,"In these cases, most of the items were valued at over 100m, so it's actually normal for part or all of the trade to be done through auctions (and sometimes people opt for junk auctions)  The auction's max 1-bid limit is 100m (50 start with 50 incs) so there would have had to be at least one junk auction for any item valued over that much. Say 120m. You'd have to do one auction for 100 and one for 20. Gets complicated fast."

Traditional/digital art, music, uh, cooking I guess? Get creative! The idea is to (hopefully) have fun.  Misc is literally anything that's not customization or art.

That said, I did get lent without having the NQ trophies.  Best way to get lent is to lurk around AC and kind of make a name for yourself, or just put your face out there. Make some lending boards (for like fuzzle, and other basic lends), or post and chat with people. c:  I wish you much luck!!"

You can't be too far off considering you're at Temple of Roo.

I borrowed a pea from a user on here and then bumped a board on the AC for SUAP. While I was looking for SUAP I stumbled upon a board for MSPP and got lent that way. No collat for any of them!

Jumpstart bought out neopets from viacom, so there has been quite a few changes going on in management, which also means that the workers haven't had as much time to repair some things that used to be functional when you were last around."

neopets,3dvuz0,iDubes,2,Sun Jul 19 23:57:39 2015 UTC,Just remember that you do not want to mention reddit on neo.
neopets,3dvuz0,stardustcross,2,Mon Jul 20 00:39:20 2015 UTC,Good to know.   But why is that?
neopets,3dvuz0,spurplebirdie,2,Mon Jul 20 00:40:48 2015 UTC,Dubes is right. You're actually not allowed to mention any outside sites on Neopets that aren't actually approved fansites like Jellyneo or Sunnyneo. It's why the word Poogle is banned on the boards. People kept telling everyone to 'poogle it' instead of 'google it'. You're also apparently not allowed to use the word analysis because it has the word anal in it. The filter have only gotten more nonsensical over the years.
neopets,3dvuz0,spurplebirdie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:03 2015 UTC,I have heard you can get iced for mentioning it. Not sure my guess would be that it's not an official fan site.

It can get a bit (re: extremely) expensive, but it's a great way to familiarize yourself with everything you can do in neopia! I also suggest learning how to play food club (or you can follow someone else's bets on the daily food club thread). It's the easiest way to make neopoints with an older account.

neopets,3dvuz0,Pacoshaboinking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:39 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not in a guild. Good luck finding one!  Check out Jellyneo's avatar solutions to see all the avatars that are available and how to get them.  There's also a checklist that will show you which avatars you already have.   Here is an excellent food club guide that will walk you through all the basics. This subreddit has a daily thread where all the bettors post their bets. You should start out copying someone (u/cupcake and u/shikogo are both really good). The new thread posts at midnight NST.   I hope that this made sense!"

That means, if you log into side accounts at this time, you will automatically be awarded the prize. Given that the prizes will scale up to 100K, we're assuming this is not an activity that will be allowed on side accounts, so be cautious until TNT clarify/fix the situation.    I'm very sure it's a glitch and I hope they DO clarify/fix it soon without mass-freezing random accounts. I've been getting this on all my sides, sent in tickets, and if anything's going to happen because of their glitch, I don't know what I'll do.

I renewed my membership (this time through PayPal instead of my bank directly) and received the collectable.   I would suggest checking your Premium status just to be sure. I'm not sure if there was a glitch when the E-wallet change over started or if it's just the same glitches that have been happening.

neopets,3duiem,Syzeki,6,Sun Jul 19 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"Hi! I read the jellyneo guide and did exactly what it says, but I'll try to explain it step by step to see if you'll have better luck doing it. I'm pants at all these flash games by the way, so if I can do it anyone can! LOL.  Anyway:  * Wait until the wind number (bottom left corner of the screen) says 9 * As soon as it gets to 9, click the spacebar (I find it easier than the mouse) to let the kass drop * Once it's dropped, hit the spacebar again right when it touches the top of blumaroo's ears * Keep the spacebar pressed down while the kass goes up, and as soon as it starts to dive down release the spacebar * Every time it's just about to touch the ground (less than 1 or 2 cms away from it), press the spacebar (just press it once quickly, don't hold it down!) * ^ Keep doing that until it stops bouncing.  That's what I do and I always get 1000 np. I've never gotten on the high score list though, so if that's your goal you'll have to ask someone who knows a bit more than me. By the way, use the hard mode bat as soon as you unlock it. It gives way higher scores! Good luck!"

neopets,3dyz81,goofyspouse,22,Mon Jul 20 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"Here we go again. Another complaint post that solves nothing. Yippee. Just what we all wanted to see on Monday morning.    Here's the thing though. Cheating, on a game or in real life, is a terrible fucking thing. If you do it online, chances are you do it in real life. So using your logic of ""give them a second chance"" instills in players that they should be given a second chance for everything. Cheat on your spouse? Second chance. Murder dozens of people? Second chance. Mug an old lady on the street? Second chance. You can't continue to give second chances because it teaches you absolutely fucking nothing.   When you sign up for Neopets, the rules are right there. There is no grey line when it comes to the rules. Don't cheat. Get frozen if you do. It's not that hard to do. People have been doing it for 15+ years and they haven't had any issue. People have been not cheating on games/life since the beginning of time and they seem to be doing okay!     JumpStart is only spending the bare minimum on Neopets   I'd like to see where you got this information. Because unless you are the accounting department for JS you have no idea that this in accurate information.    look at all the employees they fired a few months ago     fired - ""having lost your job"" layoff - ""is the temporary suspension or permanent termination of employment of an employee or (more commonly) a group of employees for business reasons...Laidoff workers or displaced workers refers to workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or shift was abolished""  Employees of JS were laid off! Not fired! They could still bring them back once the site is up to par.    Without money coming in nothing will be fixed     So what about all the people paying for Premium? All the people who spend money on Neocash? All the revenue from ad money on the site? Real life money comes from all those. Not pretend Monopoly money. I don't think people understand that once you buy the Neocash cards, JS has your money. They don't wait around for you to be able to redeem the card. They already have your money. They have that income to use at their own discretion.   You can complain all you want. There are hundreds of people who will stand with you and complain. But for all those hundreds of people, there are hundreds more who will stand by JS and stand by all those who remain committed to Neopets and to their accounts.   edit; also, if you wanna down-vote me go right ahead."
neopets,3dyz81,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,11,Mon Jul 20 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"Great post!!  I didn't even finish READING the OP without massive eye rolling. Really, we should give KNOWN CHEATERS another chance? No. No, no no! That's not how this works. I'm pretty sure by signing up for Neopets you agree to their rules, which has always been and will always be anti-cheating.   I don't understand this ""pro-cheating"" viewpoint AT ALL."
neopets,3dyz81,SailorMarieCurie,6,Mon Jul 20 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"When you sign up for Neopets, the rules are right there. There is no grey line when it comes to the rules.   You know I am usually in your corner on things, but this does not ring true to me in the least.  Sure, there is a lengthy TOS that everyone agrees to when signing up, but that document does not contain even half of the ""rules"" for Neopets.  You can follow the letter of TOS and still run afoul of other ""rules"" that may have only appeared in an FAQ or a Neopian Times Editorial response from 2003.  I do not condone overt cheating, but saying that everything you need to know to not ""cheat"" is ""right there"" when you sign up is simply not correct.  This site has TONS of grey lines.  What it does not have is a consistent set of rules or a consistent application of those rules."
neopets,3dyz81,goofyspouse,5,Mon Jul 20 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"Usually the grey lines that exist have nothing to do with ""cheating"" though."
neopets,3dyz81,fuzio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"While I agree completely with the clarification between ""cheating"" and ""breaking the rules"", I don't agree with this assessment at all.  The site is rife with grey lines spanning the spectrum between those two.  The answer, as /u/Mrs_Patrick_Sharp noted, is a clear and well-organized set of rules.  These rules would need to be updated regularly and applied consistently.    Since this would have to be implemented by those who brought us NeoFilters and decided pet trading was legit, however, I don't hold out much hope for Neopets being anything other than a huge jumble of rules and norms that are too easy to inadvertently break.  EDIT: Using my words gooder."
neopets,3dyz81,goofyspouse,4,Mon Jul 20 22:49:11 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely see where you are coming from with this but that also brings up another point; Neopets is a children's site. Personally I don't believe that the children that this is aimed at would have the capability to read over TOS and understand everything in the with no issue. Hell, some adults probably don't understand it.    JS and those who oversee Neopets do need to all sit down and have a big meeting and set up rules, have a page for them, and be done with it.   With that being said, the Neoepts Terms of Use page does clearly state, ""That means you should not attempt to post any of the following...""cheats"" or ""hacks"", or information or links to sites claiming to have these"". It later goes on to say, ""You agree that you will not, under any circumstances:... (b) use cheats, automation software, hacks, or any unauthorized third party software to modify the Neopets Virtual Worlds, any activity or game within the Neopets Virtual Worlds or to change any designed game play"".   So I mean, while you are correct and entitled to your opinion on the matter, it is in writing right there for anyone who signs up to see. DO. NOT. CHEAT. ON. NEOPETS.  A lot of it also is just common sense. Like the duping items. You know it's not okay to do. So if you do somehow magically do it, you know that it's wrong and shouldn't do it. That's just my thoughts on it.   I do agree with you that Neopets does need to have all the rules laid out for everyone to see."
neopets,3dyz81,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,4,Mon Jul 20 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"JS and those who oversee Neopets do need to all sit down and have a big meeting and set up rules, have a page for them, and be done with it.   Boom.  This.   ""You agree that you will not, under any circumstances:... (b) use ... automation software...to modify the Neopets Virtual Worlds, any activity or game within the Neopets Virtual Worlds or to change any designed game play"".   Clear as can be in the TOS, but how many of us use scripts by /u/diceroll123 and others to modify how they view and use Neopets?  Based on the TOS, this is breaking the rules.  Apparently elsewhere, probably in some ob-fucking-scure NT Editorial response, TNT clarified that the type of scripts we are using are kosher.  This is the thing that kills me and has killed me from the beginning.  You shouldn't need to glean multiple info sources to determine if you are playing legitimately, breaking the rules, or cheating.  While most instances of cheating are obvious, not all are.  One that came up recently involves the ""Gold Ban"" on Beauty Contest entries where your pet cannot enter the Beauty Contest again for (insert ridiculously large number of weeks here) if it wins gold.  This rule is enforced by coding on the site that prevents you from entering again...if your pet is still the same species.  Change the pet's species, and the Beauty Contest will let you enter again.  Even though this is ENTIRELY due to bad programming on TNT's part (base it on the @#$(ing pet name, not the species alone for chrissake), you put your account at risk of warning/silencing/freezing if you enter your species-changed pet in the BC before the correct number of weeks has passed.  Yes, this is covered in a FAQ, but I hope for the sake of argument that this is a good example of TNT making shit much more complicated (and potentially dangerous to innocent players) than it has to be.  I wish that example was an anomaly, but it really is fairly typical for the site.  Anyway, we are not disagreeing.  Things would be different if we were in charge, right?!?  :-)"
neopets,3dyz81,goofyspouse,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:02 2015 UTC,"Things would be different if we were in charge, right?!? :-)   Here's the deal. You and me are going to buy the site and fix it! :P  But really, we aren't disagreeing. We are both able to provide sources and facts to back up our arguments and neither of us is saying, ""GO FORTH AND CHEAT DEAR NEOPIANS!"" Really, JS needs to get their shit together.

neopets,3dyz81,Vengerai,12,Mon Jul 20 18:18:11 2015 UTC,Oh look. A reddit account created to post this one and only post. Why don't you use your everyday reddit account name and then go on to defend cheating?
neopets,3dyz81,TubOfSoda,5,Mon Jul 20 18:36:56 2015 UTC,"When a company merges with another company like how Neo merged with JS, there usually is a massive layoff. It happens quite frequently, actually. For me, the annoying thing about Neo's rules (and what I think is driving people away) is the poor structure for their rules. Imo, because Neo tries to enforce so many restrictions on what a user can say in chat (e.g. no HTML code, BBCode, nested profanities (analyzing), weird blocked words (uncle), it detracts from the rules that are actually important to follow, like no scamming.  Jumpstart wouldn't buy a company like neopets, and then keep it in critical condition. They inherited a lot of work along with the company. Like, a lot of the website is outdated; It's hard to find a good balance between adding & maintaining content, and literally restructuring the backbone of the neopets' source code - which is probably what they have to do."

Another thing people forget is that a large chunk of Neopets is Flash based and that is something that is dying and becoming unsupported more and more every day.  JS shared their plans with us, updating Neopets behind the scenes and well as update the look of the site. They've done everything they've told us they were going to do so far.

Yeah, I don't feel sorry for you one bit. The whole point of mass bans is to catch a large amount of people at once so that it doesn't tip off other people using the same program. They find a way to detect its patterns, gather information of users via logs, review, and then mass ban."
neopets,3dyz81,Aksar0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:06 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the mass freezings two days ago? I thought that was some kind of cookie grabber on the neoboards? o.O
neopets,3dyz81,123paco,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"If it was any form of a data breech or injection Neopets would have been taken offline just like it was when they needed to cleanup after the filters went down. Users on the pound boards seemed to have been effected in much higher numbers. That makes it seem like the possibility of a mass ban for use of a pound program to be a likely cause. No one knows for sure. It would be in Jumpstars best interest to not say what the bans happened for, so they could catch even more people cheating. If it was a data breech the site would have been taken down, and they could have forced users to change their passwords before logging in again. That's just my two cents."
neopets,3dyz81,Aksar0,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"I doubt that if TNT was freezing cheaters they would go through the trouble of emptying their gallery and converting their UC's first, and then return their accounts few days after..."
neopets,3dyz81,CountBasil,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"In those cases that's true. There are plenty of users claiming their gallery was left intact, but they were frozen. The point is there wasn't a data breech onsite. It could have been many things; people using the same password across several sites, CG'd offsite (pound related sites, since this was the majority of effected people)."
neopets,3dyz81,Aksar0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also thought all of the frozen people must have cheated somehow until all of their gallery stuff got donated to the money tree. The neoboard cookie grabber theory makes more sense IMO."
neopets,3dyz81,123paco,2,Mon Jul 20 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"Possible, but even JS posted a blurb about account security. They did acknowledge the shady things going on without taking specific features offline or saying it outright."

I really want a Faerie one but I've reached the point where I like my pets too much to trade them. Whoops!  It's probably good to get off this site now rather than when things go further downhill. I think I'm gonna die on this site.
neopets,3du9tc,SailorMarieCurie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:21:05 2015 UTC,"No UC aishas unfortunately, I always wanted a Darigan one though."
neopets,3du9tc,-cupcake,0,Sun Jul 19 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"I actually have one that I created myself 800 years ago. (: My (silly) dream is to make an account that's all UC kitties (Aisha, Wocky, Kougra...) They're just so much cuter with the old poses."
neopets,3du9tc,Duster526,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to see you go.  It's always sad to see another member leaving.  I'm seconding what everyone is saying about UL disclaimer.  If you have sides I'd make sure you put that on there too.  I'd also recommend a NM trail.  Nothing ridiculous just like ""Hey, thanks for agreeing to adopt XXX I'll send them over later today!""    I'd love to throw my hat in the ring for some of your pets.  But I'm assuming you're getting bombarded already so if you want to keep applications to people who you know/got there first I understand.    Regardless, let me know if there's anything I can do to help. Even if it means bumping a board for a little while."
neopets,3du9tc,cilllah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:37 2015 UTC,I'm already starting all of this with the neomails. I'm just now sending out the first pet though. This is a lot more popular than I expected lol. I'm trying to adopt the UCs to the people who want them the most I guess specifically and then I'm gonna just post the other pets on a different board I think?  Thanks for the offer of help though!  Am I allowed to make a different board for adopting out on here?
neopets,3du9tc,Garettesky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:29:39 2015 UTC,I'm sure it'd be fine since these aren't your regular style adoptions.  This wouldn't work in the daily thread.    If you're going through the neoboards I think you're smart to separate the UCs from the rest of your pets.  Though it's a pain to deal with adopting or trading converteds on the PC.  Maybe check out this list for people's dream pets that you could adopt your converteds out to?
neopets,3du9tc,Noeunoeuf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"Oh! Thank you for the link! That will help immensely. I might just use that instead of making a thread. It will be a lot less disorganized for me. Between the PMs and thread comments, this made my inbox a wreck lol."
neopets,3du9tc,Noeunoeuf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:47 2015 UTC,No prob!  I can completely appreciate haha.  If any of your apps fall through give me a shout.  I don't like making my ~dream pets~ super public.    Good luck with everything!
neopets,3du9tc,transplantkid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"This is really kind of you! I lurk around the pound chat a lot, and any thread with 'UC UFA' on the title always gets way too messy IMO. I'm talking like 200+ people making really time-consuming applications, people getting report-happy and pissy when they don't get the pet, etc. So if I were you I wouldn't advertise the giveaway there. By the way, you wouldn't by any chance have a faerie or white paint brush you're planning on giving away, would you? O:-)"

neopets,3du9tc,MageKessu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"I would go with posting on the giveaway boards would be a good route for items. Transferring your pets should be safe regardless. As others have said you'll find no shortage of interested people for your UCs but posting on the PC board will likely lead to inbox armageddon :p  I have a couple of UCs that I would adore to own - Grey Gelert, Faerie Ixi, Darigan Eyrie, Grey Uni, Baby Kougra, Darigan Moehog, Faerie Peo, Grey Kougra ... okay. Maybe more than a couple, hah.   For some reason the 10 year-old in me just can't shake Neopets, even when my interest wanes for a bit. The nostalgia factor gets me. Good luck in the real world!"

I've gone on long Neo haituses before but right now it's practically all I have to do, and I finally get to work towards my goals pretty seriously. I normally just played casually before. I almost quit when I realized my oldest account was purged (I don't even remember it anymore anyway) and that the new art is kinda lame compared to UC. There was a learning curve when I got back into it too and I made some dumb decisions :( My account I have now is almost 12 years old and I don't have much to show for it lol  Let me know if there's any fun giveaways that will be happening, I'd love to participate! If you have a UC Baby Kougra let me know... Only UC dreamie really ;) But I'm sure your pets will be claimed quickly. Also I like fun. c:"

I am currently in the process of buying a lupe trans potion so I can transform Crofter into a spotted lupe (a kind redditor gifted me a spotted PB). =)  I think it would be amazing to have a spotted gelert and lupe as siblings!

I'm so excited about that Faerie Lenny though, those birdies have been my absolute DREAM since I was a youngin when I made an account! I'll be sending a neomail about it, assuming the birdie's still available.  Out of curiosity, are you quitting because of responsibilities etc. or do you just not enjoy neo anymore? Regardless, thanks for giving away all of these and hope you're well!"
neopets,3du9tc,awry_lynx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:08:25 2015 UTC,I quit mainly because of lack of time and or interest. I've tried to come back at least once a year for the past couple years and it just never sticks like it used to.  My lenny already has a new home actually. I need to edit my main post. :x
neopets,3du9tc,Paxtato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I can understand that - Neo's only grown on my after a really long period of not playing. I tried to come back to it before but it never really stuck on until now.  Aw, good to see someone got the birdie. Thank you for giving away these pets!"
neopets,3du9tc,KatiaSwift,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're leaving, I use neopets when I'm having a hard time in life, so I personally couldn't fathom leaving it. I hope your endeavors in other things are just as fun as your time on Neo! If your UC happens to be a faerie grarrl I would love it. My old pet on my old account was a UC faerie grarrl, too cute."

I'd love to adopt any UC pet, but I don't understand the whole application process that the PC swears by. Just seems.... Creepy to me. I've been given pets in the past from friends who were quitting, and I do make sure to take care of them. But I'm not going to be all weird and make up a back-story and pretend to be the pet. shudders  If you consider me as a potential adopter, that would be awesome. :) I hope you find something fun to do to replace neopets for you.

Back when I got it frozen, they first told me that I could have it back, then told me that I couldn't. Then I sent another ticket in a year later and they told me that it was too late to unfreeze (obviously bullpucky, but I didn't know it at the time). Now I just sent a long-winded ticket a month ago after finding out (to my surprise) that my account had not been purged like I assumed it to be. I'm thinking that the lack of reply is either due to the length of the ticket, or simple bad luck (although as I've said the ticket was sent in relatively recently).

Another week and suddenly I was talking to someone via email and they were asking for more details.  I'm not sure whether me having prism I on the old account helped any.

I would certainly love to see some Darigan action, and I'm especially interested to see what they would do with kass!   I think a game could be what they need to save them. The population on neo has been steadily declining and they haven't had a new game out in a while. It would help bring a lot more people to the site, and if they took a Darigan approach I'm sure many more people would be interested in it simply because it looks ""cool"" and is a little bit darker than sunny Meridell.

neopets,3dps72,sethpwnsk,2,Sat Jul 18 07:09:08 2015 UTC,"I've been keeping track of the number of 2:1 pirate wins for a while now, and right now there's a slightly higher number of those wins than normal (average tends to be around 60%, but it's about 61.48% for today). Even if we had zero 2:1 wins today, it still wouldn't be enough to bring it to 60%. Couple that with the fact that we've had three 2:1 wins for the past three rounds means that win rate isn't tending towards the average, so maybe, just maybe, the higher-than-average number of 2:1 wins is what's causing the opening odds to suck?  I'm just grasping at straws here. We could easily just have been unlucky for the past few days (like flipping a coin three times and getting all heads).

Even on days with positive arenas the pirates have even been having weird opening odds. Since that really good day there's been nothing but upsets and overthrows. It seems like someone is just drawing the winners out of a hat for the last week. I get variance, but daaamn."
neopets,3dps72,UhOhFeministOnReddit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:35:28 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no one really knows how FC works behind the scenes (except for maybe the guys that programmed it). For the most part, it seems that the food and the pirate's placement in an arena is randomized, and then based on that, odds are computed based on each pirate's strength and food preferences.  However, my current theory is that while FC is mostly randomized, not all of it is. There could be another set of factors which influence the opening odds, but what those factors are, we would have no idea.  Or if you believe that FC is completely randomized, maybe we all have just been unlucky for the past few days. :("

neopets,3drmgc,Vengerai,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"The only way to truly learn this is by trial and error.  In general, lower restock amount and higher cost = higher rarity item. However, not all high rarity items turn a profit.  If you're interested in certain shops, I would recommend taking a browse through Jellyneo's item database for that shop and order the items that stock there by price. Spend some time browsing over the profitable items to get a feel for their names and what they look like. Obviously you won't be able to memorize all of them, but you'll recognize at least some when they pop up. :)"
neopets,3drmgc,Heathyrre,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:15:22 2015 UTC,I was kind of thinking it was trial and error. Are there any shops that aren't good at all for restocking? I'm mostly interested in Usukiland right now
neopets,3drmgc,Heathyrre,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"I think every shop will restock at least some items that will turn a profit, but there are shops that have much higher % of profitable items than others. Before I started living at Kauvara's Potions, shops I really liked for their profits were: Clothes, Books, and Plushies. There were some others I visited less frequently, which included Usukiland. :)"

neopets,3drmgc,SmilkySmoofFur,2,Sat Jul 18 23:09:57 2015 UTC,"The way I learned to restock expensive items was like this:  Go on jellyneo and choose which shop you want to restock. (lets say Kauveras Magic Shop)  First, choose ""sort by price"" from the drop down menu and view ""100 items per page"". The items that are most valuable are the ones you want to read first. (Make sure these expensive items aren't retired) Theres a trick to remembering them by association. Create an emotion for expensive items, like a wow or something. Seeing this item in a RS scenario will automatically trigger that wow feeling when you see it.  I do that for meh items too, but I usually only do that after I've memorized the wow items, you could also say to yourself ""valuable"" when looking at the object. I'm sure there are other ways to memorize things, but I do this and it works.   If an item is new jellyneo sometimes might not have a price yet. In this case change your specifications to ""sort by rarity"" and memorize the items without prices, too. You may end up getting an advantage this way because other people aren't aware of that item yet. Thats how you get exclusive expensive items. Pretty neat, huh?"

neopets,3dqpv4,seriative,7,Sat Jul 18 15:22:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see what the point is in changing Mutants and Maraquans and Babies if they can't wear normal wearables anyway.

neopets,3dqpv4,Garettesky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"I think they changed their plan halfway though honestly.

So they went back to not changing them too much"

neopets,3dqpv4,Malbat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:26 2015 UTC,"I think they realized a decent amount of the way through converting the mutants that mutants had such varied bodies that making every piece of clothes fit them... Would be far more work than they can reasonably put in. But, well they still had to have converted mutants of every type available, since people would make them post conversion.  Plus, if you notice, the post-conversion mutants actually have bodies that are generally alot different than their normal counterparts. I mean just look at the mutant acara. I wouldn't even be able to tell it was a mutant if I hadn't outright been told.  Also, mutant gelerts used to look more mournful in their happy picture. And their circle picture rather reminded me of Bruno. Heck, they still remind me of Bruno."

neopets,3drshw,yellowpron,4,Sat Jul 18 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"Your assumption is incorrect. You could leave Agility at 1 forever if you wanted to.  The only relation that matters is level to the other stats; your stats can be x2 your level, except your HP which can be x3 ( if trained at Mystery Island ). However, if you train your endurance higher, you'll need to get your level to half of your endurance before you can train the other stats again.   Example: If your pet is level 50, with strength 75, and endurance 120, and you wish to train in strength, you will need to get your level up to half of your endurance, which in this case would be 60 (120 / 2 = 60)."
neopets,3drshw,Heathyrre,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"Heathyree is right, so I won't repeat what she said but instead say this: Agility is a useless stat. There's one worthwhile weapon that utilizes the agility stat, the Heavy Robe of Thievery. It allows you to steal a single item from your opponent if speed is over 200, though you don't get to choose which item. Some opponents purposely keep junk in their set to keep you from stealing a useful item to use against them. Unless you plan to use the robe, don't waste the time or neopoints on training speed."

Maybe we should start linking to RequestPolicy and the like… but I wish we knew more about the current attack first. I've heard talk that this is just someone buying an old password list :/  Did you ever use the same password on another site, maybe?

No, whenever I go to a new site or come up with a new password, I just come up with a completely random string of numbers and letters, so I never use the same password for the same site.

I know the site staff would never do wrong, but considering the seemingly out of nowhere ""DTI is banned"" decision, and the fact that the DTI site has a few pretty powerful tools at hand, like being able to look through your closet in another frame while you're logged in, I dunno... maybe someone found a way to misuse DTI?

neopets,3dpqwh,Feloreena,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"It's a rate limiting thing. Neopia.com.br and PetTP are seeing it, too—wish I was on my real computer so I could get the owners' comments :/  We get unbanned every ~24hrs according to the contributions list, which isn't what you'd do if the ban was created by a human, and we even were whitelisted for a few weeks or so; not sure what happened to that…   We're also still an official Certified Fan Site, and Neopets.com's community section still includes a direct link to us. So, the ban is pretty clearly automatic rather than a falling-out, and if I could just get their attention we would be okay xD I'm legit considering signing up for LinkedIn Premium so that they'll let me contact the CEO directly. Yeesh, LinkedIn, what a business model.  Plus, if it was a human-created ban because someone was abusing the site without our knowledge, they'd reach out to me and help me fix it, rather than ignore everything I saaaaay :'( Oh, and a CGer is s client-side attack, and wouldn't trigger an automatic ban of the server.  Not sayin' it's impossible that someone's abusing DTI, but none of the evidence really seems to point to that yet :/  (The closet thing is just a standard iframe. We can't read its contents, which is why we rely on users to copy-paste the source code. I guess maybe if the source code contained auth information that would be a possible attack, but it didn't last time I checked, but, granted, that was a while ago… in any case, from the bits and pieces I've heard about the victims, I don't think the evidence we see aligns with that attack.)"

Jeez, if it's that easy, considering the amount some people spend on Premium and NC, myself included, that's money easily spent to have your words to the ear of Neopets itself.   It wouldn't even have to be Lord. I'd be open to contacting anyone who worked there. In fact, I'd particularly like to talk to the one(s) who are supposed to be looking into this hacking scare. What is that, like, $20 a month to be able to talk to someone? I spend way more than that a DAY to talk to... other... people. If LinkedIn Premium will let me hear news on patching this hack and let me finally be able to sleep at night, I'm there. Take my money, LinkedIn. I'll pay anything to feel secure again.  EDIT: Just checked. I think they've changed them recently, but my source says...   $30 a month or $300 a year for a Job Seeker Package.   $50 a month or $480 a year for a Business Plus Package.   $100 a month or $900 a year for an Executive Package.   InMail is the service I want, right?"

I enter the BC pretty regularly and have never once manually voted, or voted on boards for every single pet, because I'm lazy.  I can see how the BC can quickly be ignored by everyone except a select dozen or so that go on the BC board, and the amount of votes will drop drastically. They should have an incentive for voting."
neopets,3dozmt,_kate_e_did_,9,Sat Jul 18 02:54:38 2015 UTC,"Yep. The Art Chat is a very insulated group and at times is a little off-putting to be in for too long if you're not part of the clique (in my opinion!).    I'm fortunate to have been recently gifted a neoboard pen, so if I ever enter in the future I'll be able to easily switch signatures. But 95% of my time on neopets is spent on the boards (kad feeding / FC boards / sometimes Secret Lenders) and that seems so incredibly frustrating for others who legitimately chat outside of the Art Boards and want to enter the BC but aren't lucky to have an NB pen.    Maybe I'm just out of the times. 5 years ago the BC was jam-packed and lively. Now it's desolate and kinda sad (there are multiple specie categories with either only a couple or no entries at all every week).     I thought they would have wanted to find a way to make it popular again, not further isolate it.    But I guess asking the board monitors to actually do a good job of differentiating spam from actual chatting is too much work to ask.... -___-"
neopets,3dozmt,-cupcake,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:17 2015 UTC,"Can I ask what a neoboard pen is? I don't have a neosignature, nor do I ever post on the boards. I'm just curious, it sounds ritzy."
neopets,3dozmt,UhOhFeministOnReddit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"NB pens   1) give you more characters to type on the neoBoards and in your neosig 2) let you save an extra font    So if I have 2 NB pens, I can save a default font like normal and I can have 2 extra fonts. When you post on a board, in the text area you can just click which font you want to use. No need to go and manually switch the font from your preferences.    So with this new fucking stupid rule in the BC, I can go chat on my normal boards and just select my ""normal"" font whenever I post, and when I'm on the BC Boards I just select my ""BC"" font."
neopets,3dozmt,-cupcake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to make everything okay:  Make spamming with BC links in your signature totally okay, haha.  That way mods don't have to go through the trouble of removing entries. I posted that sentiment on the art boards, but I think making it stricter = more mod duty rather than less (which was one of their arguments for it). Making it all banned makes the mods not have to worry or think about context, so less work there, but there are still extra steps they have to take.  I don't actually think BC people want more people to be in the BC, though. Less entries = more trophies. So it's always going to be the same 10 people every week winning and being on their high horses.  I'm one of those 10 I guess, haha, but I don't have a problem with spamming outside the boards OR repeat entries. (I dislike repeat entries, but I just don't vote for them and keep my feelings about it at a mild annoyance, rather than a blind hatred.)  Like serially there's gotta be more important things going on in their lives than someone using the same art in a small/niche contest on a virtual pets website. It may be the most firstworldproblem there is."
neopets,3dozmt,Bebeness,7,Sat Jul 18 07:27:17 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I'm afraid this will further isolate the BC and made things even more empty than it is right now.

For everytime I decide to post somewhere else besides the ArC, I'll have to c&p my link and chances are, the minute after I'll c&p an item for price checking in JN.  Rather than being a bcing week, it's probably gonna be a hermit week for me in the future. Hermit in ArC."

I was going to enter next week, for the first time in years, and now I think I won't because I'm not ready to spend my whole week advertising on the art board.   The sad thing is, I used to really like hanging out on the art board - to actually discuss art - but I hardly see any of that anymore.   (Also a few people on the boards have pointed out that the advantage here is clearly going to nc buyers, and I'm not really okay with that.)"

It's the ""enforcement"" of the rule that needed to be fixed."
neopets,3dozmt,-cupcake,7,Sat Jul 18 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"Hey cupcake.  I've been kinda negative on the art chat over this and how shitty/outright mean a lot of the entries this week are. If we're in the minority so be it. I've always put my link in my signature and just never referenced it. No spamming. Not hard. People who got deleted for that were probably cheating. I don't think it was a big deal, just as I don't think repeats are a big deal. If you don't like them don't vote for them. I think art board people think that they know better than others and if others choose to vote for things that they're against (or for reasons they don't believe are ""just"") then those people are wrong and who they think should win are right. I'm sorta argughwut over the riot week thing, haha. Rantrantrant.  Anyway.  I'm avoiding art chat for a bit because everything over there's so toxic that I need a break."

It isn't hard to not spam, and it isn't hard to have small talk with people. Then again, I have multiple NB pens and use different sigs all the time(I know, I'm a shitty person) so it wasn't hard for me to not push I wasn't seeking votes. But I know it was a big problem on the av chat of being like ""rating whatever"" (literally whatever, not like sigs or accounts. ""whatever"") for people to come to the board and them using their BC sig and hoping to get votes. The mods are just lacking lately. But that's an entirely other topic."

neopets,3dozmt,Franseil,3,Sat Jul 18 02:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is no way I'm spending my rare free nc on this thing that shouldn't have anything to do with nc.   Honestly, I'm really disappointed in this decision and in the art community in general. I don't care about the people who ""abused"" it. I appreciate free bumps when I'm trading, even if the person's just looking for more votes. Also, I...don't see how spamming the art board is any different than spamming other boards.  The whole thing is very discouraging to me. I can only imagine what it's like for new artists and participants."
neopets,3dozmt,Bebeness,7,Sat Jul 18 03:00:12 2015 UTC,"This week (Riot Week) is awful. The art board has always been a pretty toxic place, but this week takes the cake. I'm sorta disappointed that JS decided to give into their demands when they're being, honestly, kinda bully-ish about what they want. Advertising on the art board is a joke, unless you have nothing to do at 12pm NST the Friday the BC starts. I was volunteering and got home at 1:30 today to advertise on the art boards, and one of the comments I got was ""you really need to advertise earlier if you want to get votes in [that category]."" Yeah. I know. But not everyone is able to be at their computers at that exact time each week to out spam the competition.  And I dislike posting in the art boards anyway just because it's sort of a begging community. And lots of time people lie about voting for you just to get your votes out of guilt. (Last week I had a Lupe entry, and someone who was advertising Lupe posted ""Your vote has been cast for [my lupe entry]"" in my board.) Yeah. I'm sure that you decided to use your vote on my Lupe multiple days after the start of the BC instead of on your own Lupe. Or someone will tell me they voted for my [species] and on another board they're telling someone else they voted for their [same species]. Why do I want to be tethered to that place? There are better communities outside of the art board.  But even though I draw new and (what I consider) semi-quality drawings every week, and advertise as much as I can (albeit not when it matters, as people often tell me), most of my boards on the art chat go unnoticed/only bumped by me, and using my link in my sig on other boards is basically the only way I get noticed. That said! I did this for the last two weeks in the BC and didn't place either week, so it's not like a fool-proof guarantee that you'll place if you do this. Posting ad boards + being friendly outside of the art boards with a link in my signature + having an entry that I would say is above average = multiple weeks of no placement.   The BC community is toxic and it's disappointing because I really like drawing new pictures of my pets and getting them nice trophies. But they've outright told me unless I tether myself and advertise constantly on the art board I'm doomed. It just sucks.  That said:  I'm capable of winning BCs if it's not a popular species! So I'm not complaining about that. It's just that if there's any competition or someone spams the Art chat harder (the most spamming happens on the art boards themselves imo), then you're pretty much out of the running.  I had a bad day and feel like venting because bad day. I'm sorry for the vent. I feel better now. Sorry that I did it in response to what you said, Franseil haha."
neopets,3dozmt,Franseil,3,Sat Jul 18 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"Ha, don't worry, I've been venting too! Sometimes it's best to let it all out. That sucks about your experience on the art board. :( And it definitely seems like you're not alone.  I really liked the art community a few years back, I found it quite friendly and constructive and maybe less BC-oriented than it appears to be now. I'm very disappointed to see what it's become."
neopets,3dozmt,MsPennyHorrible,2,Sat Jul 18 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"Your points are exactly the reason why I don't participate in the BC. Sure, it would be nice to have a shiny trophy, but I know it wouldn't be because of the quality of my art, it would be because I begged for it one way or another. I agree that the environment on the art board is discouraging and toxic, no one seems genuinely interested in each other's art, they just kiss butt to get votes, or even go so far to lie about who they vote for, as you mentioned.  You are definitely not alone in how you feel.Next time I happen to be on the boards and see one by you, I'll be sure to comment!!"
neopets,3dozmt,Bebeness,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:28:24 2015 UTC,"I may have been more negative than I should have been because I was overly pissed when I wrote it (knowing that Riot Week worked really ticked me off). I will say that: quality art definitely helps, especially in unpopular categories, as there are a lot of MVers out there. That said, if someone's a better advertiser than you are a drawer, then I'd say they do have an advantage.   But  I barely advertised in Blum last week, maybe 3 boards? Not many replies to said boards, but there were only a few Blum entries and I ended up in 6th place overall, 1st in Blum, semi-unexpectedly to me. So it happens like that sometimes and it's really refreshing. But if you have amazing art in a popular category and you don't advertise your heart out, it's veeery difficult to place. I learned that the hard way. I just morphed my Lupe Ogrin so I can stop drawing Lupes.  And thank you for any future bumps! :D Ditto, if you ever want to start BCing!"
neopets,3dozmt,NuSunt23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. I just enter and don't advertize at all. This works out sometimes because most of my pets are ""undesirable"" species, but I also don't mind not placing with most of them most of the time.  The summer and December are really rough times to enter. The start of the American school year and final exam times (or the time directly leading up to exams) are the best times to enter because few of your competitors will have time to advertize."

neopets,3dozmt,Superkouza,3,Sat Jul 18 07:29:38 2015 UTC,"So how exactly are you supposed to advertise your Beauty Contest entries? You can't have it in your signature or post about it unless you're on the Art Board, and the only people who go to the Art Board are people who are in the Beauty Contest.   No one goes to the Art Board looking for 'pets to vote for, it's pointless. It's easier to just browse each species' pictures and vote on what you think the best art is. This pretty much outlaws advertising your 'pet. The point of advertising is to bring it to the attention of people who haven't heard about it yet. This can only work outside of the Art Board. I don't think Jumpstaff thought this one through."
neopets,3dozmt,vigorventure,4,Sat Jul 18 14:41:39 2015 UTC,I would rather them have addressed the repeat entries. If this works though I really hope to see that Art board way more active. Otherwise getting votes is going to be so tiresome lol

neopets,3dozf2,TenderRain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not super computer-savvy, but from what I've read about cookie grabbers...  The code for cookie grabbers is hidden within HTML code and JavaScript. This is why people are saying to avoid pet pages/shops/lookups/switch to plain text, because all of these are user-html customizable. What NoScript seemingly does is it allows you to choose what's safe to load within the page you're visiting. So if there's hidden, unfamiliar/malicious JavaScript within the page, NoScript will prevent that from being automatically loaded.  There are a couple threads explaining this and I suggest you search about CGs/Script blockers cause I don't think I'm 100% spot on, but I hope you get the gist of it!  EDIT Here is a recent thread that explains what exactly a cookie grabber is.  here is a pretty detailed guide about NoScript and what it does.

Start collecting the easy avatars (many are clickable!), just click here. Get a few stamps, soooo many are only a few NP. That should be a good start. Next, paint your pets, customize them, & start training. Then no one will say your account looks like a shell!"

Also use their avatar checklist to get easy, clickable avatars! You can also get a small shop (don't upgrade it very much) and just sell items from your dailies! Maybe a small gallery? You don't have to collect huge things. Maybe you just have a few items you would like to put on display! Another one I like is Neodeck Cards! Those are pretty inexpensive and there are so many of them! You can also customize your pets, train them, paint them, show them off! It's easy to get your account looking spiffy! You can do it! :)"

Users on Neo are very very quick to accuse. I don't think you have much to worry about, but if you really care what other people think of how you play the game you can get some easy trophies (Cheat, Tyranu Evavu, Cellblocker, whatever games you're good at), paint your pets, and create a shop that you stock every now and again."

(I know some people have said some of this already too)  There's also a lot of easy avatars that are a little more than just clicking something so working on those definitely helps to improve your account too"

Yesterday it went really well for me but I'm not sure if I can repeat it today but I'll try. Again I don't recommend following these unless you don't mind losing some money ;)  There's a couple things I don't understand about the opening odds   Tailhook is the stronger pirate in Hidden cove, I can understand the 2:1. However, both Blackbeard and Bonnie have the exact same strength and Blackbeard it's a 6:1 despite having a higher fa than Bonnie (who is 2:1)??? Kinda the same happens in Treasure Island where both Ned and Edmund are equally strong, but just because Edmund has a fa of -1 I don't think he deserves to be 12:1 while Ned is 3:1.

I really hope you are being honest when you say you are sending a ticket in. For your accounts safety.  Good on you for doing the right thing, if you do it.  Also this sub is being so bitchy cause a fuck ton of us got effected for no fucking reason and all TNT has done is tell us to ""add a pin"".  So yeah, its a bit personal for many people."

I'm in talks with someone who claims to be the owner rn and they're agreeing that's the way to do it. I was planning on keeping it, because I like having stuff like this, but if it's stolen I feel bad, and I'm just at this point kind of trying to wash my hands of this whole thing because it's not worth the stress.   I get that it's personal, but I don't come to this sub very often, and generally when I do it's quite nice about these things. I had no idea this was going on, and to be blasted like that felt like it came out of nowhere."

neopets,3dl4yv,livebythefoma,2,Sat Jul 18 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"Sure.  So with the Lab Ray, once you reach certain level thresholds, certain outcomes become impossible.  For example, you'll never receive the ""goes down to level 1"" outcome if you keep your pet trained sufficiently -- certain guides indicate level 20, others 40.  I think the level threshold is the same for the ""doesn't change at all"" outcome."

Costs 5NP"". Then when you click it, you go through to the next page which has the picture of the dice and the button ""Play dice-a-roo"". If you click that button, and before the page loads, hold down the return key for about a minute, then release, it automatically plays the game for you - as far as I know it's not cheating and I do it daily, won the avatar within 4 days doing it that way.

However as far as this goes, it's not an unheard of technique to save time? There's a post somewhere going around of Disney stills where the animators have reused poses and basically traced the shot to reuse it  I'm way more upset by things like the Cloud Xweetok plushie and the rainbow baby blu; those are gross. And the gold Kau with clog feet? That's suuuuper sloppy. And the fact that they release things that don't even get made available when released!  I think this is less of a concern, all things considered."

It would've been better if they had used the pre-customization artwork for these items. But otherwise, the kiko blueberries are cute.  Also about the news- I didn't see anyone say anything about tuskaninny day. They called chocolate a paint brush instead of color. We all know it's a lab ray color, no paint brush. Which also means that you can't take your pet to the rainbow pool to paint it chocolate like they said. I feel like I'm being too nit-picky, but I feel embarrassed for them that they'd get something like that wrong."

neopets,3dkoeo,UhOhFeministOnReddit,36,Fri Jul 17 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"Time to break out my favourite cookie analogy! The coat check.  Imagine a cookie on your computer as the ticket stub you get when you check your coat at a club. The ticket stub #201 is given to you, and when you present it back to the coat check people, they go ""ah, yes, coat 201!"" and they give you coat 201. Outside of that particular bar, that stub won't get you your coat, the same way that a cookie stored for Neopets doesn't have anything to do with one for reddit. Now, imagine you lay your ticket stub down on the counter, and someone else grabs it. They now have the stub for coat 201! They can then return this to the coat check, and even without any identifying information, they have accessed your jacket! Now, the things inside of your jacket, like maybe your car keys or your wallet, are theirs to dig through. However, just because they now have your coat and wallet doesn't mean they magically know the PIN to your bank card or know about other jackets you may own. The same goes for the access to your session. While they can now do things inside of your account, they don't magically have your password. Most of the password-stealing comes from them changing the associated email and then resetting the password."
neopets,3dkoeo,apostolicity,12,Fri Jul 17 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, this, this I get and it makes me feel a lot better. I remember when I still thought I wanted to be a programmer playing these hacker war games where I'd exploit fake websites by changing who the source code sent the password information to and it would move upwards in difficulty. I used to be pretty damn good but grew bored with it, but it made me extra frightened of my account security because a 10 year old could essentially learn how to do it.  I guess my next question would be do these CG's grab all my cookies? I don't have my neopets account attached to my every day email. Is that a good precaution to take or does it not matter once they have access to an account?"
neopets,3dkoeo,apostolicity,7,Fri Jul 17 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"I think those are the dreams of every kid who watched any 90s TV show that contained hacking. Who didn't want to button mash and make super awesome colourful text pop up on someone else's computer screen?  And nope, a cookie grabber on Neopets will only take the cookie that Neopets has. However, if you're worried that someone would see your listed email on your Neo account and attempt to break in, I'd recommend setting up extra precautions on your email, too (which is really good advice for anyone)."
neopets,3dkoeo,apostolicity,5,Fri Jul 17 02:39:13 2015 UTC,"I had Methodus for that. Me and my best friend used to eff with each other so hard via AIM. I wish I had the enthusiasm for computers I had in the 90's. Lord knows it was nothing to brag about but I was super good with HTML. I'd sit and doodle layouts for my petpages in notebooks at school, I could pound shit out from memory, and had a lot of enthusiasm for it.  Now I'm old and stupid. ;_; Those movies definitely gave me the enthusiasm and I tried in school. But there were a few kids more computer savvy than me in classes like CISCO and shit and never got the help I needed. It seemed more practical to give up and focus what I was good at since schools just weren't geared for a technical curriculum in my day. I went when Mavis Beacon Typing was considered a cutting edge part of a school curriculum. We were still using the Dewey Decimal system in the libraries.  Fuck... I'm old."

It took me hours upon hours to take all of those photos (I had 200+ Beanie Babies), resize them in Paint, and then put them on my sites with very elaborate backstories for all of them. There were also so many marquees on my pages. It's tragic.  And high five for being old! I'm old, too!"

neopets,3dkoeo,livebythefoma,2,Fri Jul 17 06:45:54 2015 UTC,"While having a PIN on your account definitely will help protect it, PINs can be reset by email, so if someone changes the email associated with the account, the PIN can be changed, too.  It would really depend on what the person is trying to do with the account. Someone who is just ruining things for shits and giggles is more likely to give up when they see a PIN than someone who is attempting to find accounts with rare items/pets to sell. With the massive amounts of items being donated to the Money Tree during all of this, I'm likely to think that it's more the former, so a PIN would help in a situation like this."

So if someone got into my account via cookie grabber they would only have access to the things I don't have PINed (that being items in my inventory and items I have in the trading post, as well as all the points I have on hand because those things CAN'T be PINed).  Very good to know, I'm so grateful!"
neopets,3dkoeo,empire539,6,Fri Jul 17 15:03:45 2015 UTC,"This isn't a dumb question at all! The full explanation is actually rather technical and complicated, so I wouldn't expect a non-tech/non-programmer to really understand how it works.  For a somewhat basic summary of what a cookie grabber actually is, see this.  But long story (maybe-not-so) short:   A cookie is just a text file on your computer. This cookie contains information like your username, and more importantly your session ID, which Neopets uses so you don't have to re-login every single time you visit a different page.  A session is basically a way for Neopets' server to know who you are while you're logged in. Whenever you visit any page on Neopets, a cookie containing your session ID is sent so it can verify who you are.  When you visit a page that has a cookie grabber script on it, that script will copy your session ID. A hacker can then use your session ID in their own cookie to make Neopets' server think that they are you.  So it has nothing to do with stealing passwords; rather, this is just a case of session hijacking, because the hacker can then change your password and lock you out of your own account."

It sounds like something I can learn to do and I still haven't figured out how to make bold text on Reddit. Is it truly that easy to exploit? I have ScriptSafe running and neopets is set as trusted. Should I change that? I don't even know how to properly use it. My best friend's boyfriend is a software engineer. He tells me to download something, I download it. That's the extent of my internet savvy. I got mad skills on the programs on a computer. But if you ask me how to do something other than turn it on, and I'm done. I learned how to remove my own hard drive awhile back and felt so smart lmao. I had my little Phillip's head and was just so pleased with myself XD. It's sad."
neopets,3dkoeo,TubOfSoda,3,Fri Jul 17 02:28:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the simplest cookie grabber you can write is literally like one line of code. It really is so simple that a 10-year old could, in fact, do it. The tricky part with sites like Neo is that they try to prevent users from executing potentially malicious Javascript code, which is why there are a bunch of filters in place for editing your shop's CSS, for example.   Eventually, though, people can sometimes find parts of the site that are still vulnerable to this type of XSS (cross-site scripting) attack, which is how/why CGs are still a problem. That and because Neopets doesn't exactly have the best security on their side of things.  I actually hadn't heard of ScriptSafe before you mentioned it, but it looks like a Chrome version of NoScript. If ScriptSafe has an XSS filtering option like NoScript does, then yes, that should help.   In any case, if you ever think you've fallen victim to a CG, all you have to do is log out of your account (doing so will invalidate the session ID that was ""stolen""), log back in and then change your password just to be safe. Having a PIN would also help big time, so that even if a hacker gains access to your account, he won't be able to easily change your password or withdraw from your bank."
neopets,3dkoeo,Superkouza,2,Fri Jul 17 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"Cookies are how websites store info on your computer. You know how when you go back to Neopets you are still logged in after closing the browser? This is because Neopets has saved your login session inside your cookies, so it can say 'you have an active session on this website, here it is'.  When you visit a page with a cookie grabber on Neopets, they're literally stealing your active login session. They don't get your password but if you don't have a PIN they can go change your email and then reset your password. This is why you should have a PIN on everything."

neopets,3dl6fx,Espelyn,2,Fri Jul 17 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"It's really up to you. If you desperately need the neopoints - pick a sell point under 60. If you're just kinda doing it because why not, you may as well wait until 60+.  Do be aware that stocks are a very, very long-term game, and holding out for two years or more isn't unusual."
neopets,3dl6fx,Franseil,3,Fri Jul 17 04:13:32 2015 UTC,Oh man. 2 years is a long time and my entire Neo-experience is around spending money quickly. I think I'll cash out. Tripling my money is good. Better than food club. :)
neopets,3dl6fx,xtwistedxlovex,2,Fri Jul 17 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"Just realize bank interest doesn't pay out nearly as much. If you were to stick 15k in the bank at the highest interest rate (12.5%) it would take ~5.55 years to double your investment and ~11.1 years to quadruple it. Here's a scorecard sorted by selling at 60.  If you need that capital free for restocking that's one thing, but if you're just going to stuff it in the bank you're better off leaving it tied up in stocks for a while."
neopets,3dl6fx,Garettesky,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:52:27 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. But, if I get to doubling or tripling it is pointless if I don't cash out and the stock goes back down to 15. We will see how the next week unfolds but the stock I sold fell from 47 to 40 overnight so I am hopeful once it drops I can reinvest.   (Risk is that it is the next virtupets and I lost out on millions. That would be my luck)"

neopets,3djjrk,Garettesky,2,Thu Jul 16 23:35:10 2015 UTC,Okay. So far I have:  goblackhawks the Dimensional Aisha lookin' bioluminescent. (Maybe with a Glowing Kad or a Ghost Tasu?)  goblackhawks the Stealthy Eyrie with more of a steampunk theme. (Petpet suggestions: Airborne Minitheus or Stealthy Wherfy)  goblackhawks the Faerie Kougra which is vaguely minimalist. (Paired with a Faerie Dandan or Faerie Gruslen)  goblackhawks the Alien Aisha which you'd need an FFQ for but hey it's not totally impossible. (Paired with a Nebularis)  aaaand goblackhawks the Invisible Kougra where he's an actual constellation. Very fun. This could work with pretty much any Invisible pet. (Paired with an Eventide Mauket.)

neopets,3djxlh,wolfheartmoon,5,Thu Jul 16 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's a lot more automated than anyone really imagines it to be. It's probably a script that does most of the work, and as such it wouldn't really know the 'difference' between a side or a main account. It just grabs login information from any account it can and goes through the steps to lock you out.  I'd recommend reporting the account/sending a ticket to have it disabled as soon as possible to prevent any damage being done to your items, pets, or neopoints. Since I think it's a script that goes in and locks you out first, then logs the new login info for the hacker to use at their leisure, I think that you have a bit of time between getting locked out before stuff starts going bad. I don't actually know how it works though so I could be way wrong, but having the account disabled asap is probably your best bet to get everything back once tnt replies to your ticket."
neopets,3djxlh,Rimmsel,2,Thu Jul 16 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"Too late, all my items are gone. They didn't change the email associated with it though, so I manged to reset it, so I was thinking I just didn't enter the new password into my manager, but nope. All my items are gone. :( There's nothing else of value on that account, all my np are on another so that's safe, and no painted or trained pets yet, so I'm not going to clog up the ticket response thing when other people lost pets and really valuable items."

I suggest looking at other bettors and trying to understand the betting strategy (if there is any lol) and don't be afraid to ask questions!   My strategy is basically to try to maximize the total expected ratio of my bets so my strategy changes based on the odds and estimated probability each day. Usually Hugo's system works the best to maximize the expected ratio, but not always. (Remind me and I'll link you to a copy of his guide when I get home.)"

neopets,3dha0k,WheresTibbers,0,Thu Jul 16 22:29:02 2015 UTC,High bust rate! Should avoid that unless you like high risk :) But definitely avoid high risk today as there were upsets yesterday and it's unlikely to have more today
neopets,3dha0k,xxabbadabbadooxx,5,Thu Jul 16 10:24:14 2015 UTC,"as there were upsets yesterday and it's unlikely to have more today   Not necessarily true. Just because there were upsets the day before, it doesn't mean there's less of a chance to have more today. See Gambler's fallacy.  This is, of course, assuming that FC results are actually based on probability where winners are determined randomly based on their odds, and Neopets doesn't apply some hocus-pocus voodoo algorithms to fix matches."
neopets,3dha0k,empire539,-2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the previous upset has decreased the odds of an upset, I'm saying that upsets are always less frequent, and the chances of two next to each other when they are infrequent is quite low."
neopets,3dha0k,xxabbadabbadooxx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"That's still a part of the gambler's fallacy - previous results do not influence the current.  Take a coin flipping 5 times for example. ""Heads, heads, heads, heads, heads"" is rare. But so is ""Heads, heads, heads, heads, tails"". They actually have the same exact probability to happen, but our brains like to perceive unique/familiar patterns, so it would seem remarkable to get 5 heads in a row even though the H-H-H-H-T was just as remarkable in terms of statistics. :)"

neopets,3dion4,Iresna,8,Thu Jul 16 16:13:48 2015 UTC,Okay so I'll answer as best I can.    How hard is it to start trading from scratch? What do you need to start trading from scratch? Answer; You should start with either a few NC items or GBCs (Gift Box Capsules). The GBCs are used as currency to trade for items. One GBC is usually 200 NC in the mall so it makes for good currency. You can find a list of how many GBCs (most) items are worth either here or here. You can't really start without NC items or GBCs. How hard would it be to get an item like Big Doll Eyes? Winter Hair Flower? Answer; Big Doll Eyes are ~2-3 GBCs and Winter Hair Flower is ~1-2 so they are pretty easy!  Are MME items able to be traded? Can someone get one of those for a trade? Answer; Yes you can trade them and yes people can get them to trade! How expensive is it to be effective at trading? Whats the most popular item to use to trade? Answer; It is pretty expensive if you buy Neocash to buy items. The most popular item used to trade is the GBC. What are these lending offers in the daily thread? How do they work? Answer; The items being lent are Dyeworks items. You take an item that is on the Dyeworks list and a Dyeworks Hue Brew Potion to get different colors of that original item while still keeping the original item! These are usually lent for 1 GBC per item!   I hope that helps a little! Let me know if you any more questions and I'll try to help!

neopets,3dion4,Malbat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"Luckily, NC trading is alot easier than pet trading. You'll pretty much need to shell out a little real money to start out with, so that you can get both boxes and stuff to trade with. A good place to start is by offering Gift Box Caps(or right now, Birthday Caps) and customs. People are always after customs and always want more boxes, so you can use them to get alot of things, including Big Doll Eyes and Winter Hair Flower. The only things that would be harder to get with customs and GBCs would be older items like Cherry Blossom Garland or Rich Golden Eye Makeup.  Another thing I'd do right now is get a couple of Caylis Wigs and a few B-Day caps and save them to trade later. They might not reach decent value for a while, but you'll at least have something that you pretty much know what get RRed, and should be somewhat desirable in the future. Particularly the wig. It's a nice enough wig that folks will want it, even after it leaves the mall.  MMEs parts can be traded, just like any other item. There are only a few NC items that can't be traded, but I think they pertain to old Lulu medals from the Daily Dare years ago.  It depends. I usually got by on 20-40 a month, but I know some folks like to spend more. I think the best items to start with would be the Caylis Wig, honestly. It's an NC collectible, it's a nice wig, and it looks good on many Neopets. You could also use caps to trade for some of the more popular recently released items, like Snow Yooyu Inspired Contacts, or a spare set of Doll eyes.  Basically there is this thing called Dyeworks where you can get recolours of old items using the old item and a Dyeworks pot. People will lend out there older items to others, so they can get the item without having to trade for the old item. This is a good thing because the Isca Wig, Cherry Blossom Garland, and Rich Golden Eye Makeup are rather rare and sought after items, and trade very high. It's customary to send the lender a gift box cap in return, to compensate for the box they used to send the item."

neopets,3dijth,Candiedonions,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"Buy shares that are at 15np, that has 0% change. I usually buy 1000 at a time. Then you wait for the change to go up, and sell it when the percentage is up fairly high (I usually got for about +60%)  EDIT: I suck at explaining so here is a great guide by TDN to get you started.

neopets,3dijth,everythingshines,3,Thu Jul 16 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"This is all that's to it!  There's really no tips to be given, it's all just a waiting game.  Never buy over 15np/share, never sell when you're in the red.  Some people wait til 30, 45, or even 60np/share to sell.  (I personally wait til 60 to maximize profit.)"
neopets,3dijth,fuzzysheepbaa,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"This isn't entirely true. There are certain stocks that raise to a decent selling point quicker and more often than others. I feel it's important to point out considering a lot of people buy some crap stock that hasn't gone above 30np in two years and wonder how the hell anyone makes a worthwhile profit off it.   Edit: Obviously as someone else said, if you wait long enough you will profit, but no one wants to wait 6 months for a 15k profit."
neopets,3dijth,tabbicat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's only a waiting game. If you can wait, you can make points. I wait till 40 usually, but if I have a bunch of shares I sell some at 40 and wait to see if they go higher.  Doesn't matter, if you wait long enough you WILL profit."

neopets,3dgk97,kriztinuh,11,Fri Jul 17 02:20:14 2015 UTC,Second piece of advice now that I see tons of users trying to figure out the cause: Don't fear monger.  This is the act of making something out to be worse than it possibly is to scare people into believing your thinking. It's not acceptable to pin your blame on any one user you remember because they were gifting pets or NC or posting links. These are daily activities on Neopets and choosing to scare people into believing that someone who did that might be the cause is just going to cause a lot of turmoil.
neopets,3dgk97,jennyandthejets,4,Thu Jul 16 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"Don't fear monger.   Sweet mother of Christ, yes.  THIS.  And as a related thought, Don't panic.  Speaking as someone who has had a very visible account for many years and has survived, chill the fuck out and either START or CONTINUE following some very basic web safety principles that others here have mentioned.   Install NoScript (or a similar cross-site scripting blocker).  If you don't do this and you get CG'd or otherwise hacked, I have ZERO sympathy for you.  You are too dumb to be on the Internet. PIN everything on Neopets Set the birthday prompt to ""on"" when login attempts are made from an unfamiliar IP address (assuming you know it...) Do NOT use the same passwords on multiple sites. Verify that Neopets has a WORKING email address associated with your account.   There is probably a ton more, but even if you just stopped with NoScript, you would probably be fine.  Please remain calm."
neopets,3dgk97,goofyspouse,3,Thu Jul 16 14:31:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. I never knew that the birthday prompt was a thing before.
neopets,3dgk97,thegirlwhocannotfly,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:10 2015 UTC,"& also try not to panic if you have been frozen for protection. They have been known to be a bit slow and there are horror stories but after having been caught up once (not hacked, wasn't online, some weird thing on the boards which again involved a lot of users) the horror stories are horrible but they don't happen /that much/ with frozen for protection accounts.  I know it shouldn't happen at all and if you're frozen for protection they should maybe have a special system to just zap you back in, but it's /not/ usually as bad as when people are frozen for cheating (fairly or unfairly) etc as there's nothing to really dispute.  It's better to be frozen for protection than not and come back to an empty account!"
neopets,3dgk97,facegasm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:59 2015 UTC,I've never heard of NoScript before. Is there a certain one you'd recommend? I use google Chrome.

NoScript was one of the first add-ons to provide this type of protection, but it appears that several others have appeared over the years.  I stick with NoScript due to inertia and and it just plain working, but that is not to say there aren't better alternatives out there.  Anyone here use ScriptSafe, by chance?

neopets,3dgk97,missynom,2,Thu Jul 16 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but any damage done already won't get reversed even if they get kicked out. And even if you haven't logged in awhile, as long as a cookie exists, they can take it and log into your account. It's a very good idea to clear your cookies often."
neopets,3dgk97,123paco,2,Thu Jul 16 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"If you log out then back in, cookie will get reset, so the one they have will be useless, and if they don't change your word you're good. So technically, even if you get CGed, you'd be fine if you logged out then back in every so often."
neopets,3dgk97,missynom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"I've logged out now, this seems like really good advice. If they can only get in if you're still logged in, it seems like a good way to keep it safe - unless I've misunderstood!"
neopets,3dgk97,123paco,2,Thu Jul 16 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"No they can get in if you're not online. Let me clarify a bit. The cookie is what keeps you logged in on Neo in your browser, if you don't log out, just close the tab and keep the window open, for example, next Neo tab you open in that window you'll still be logged in (because the cookie is saved on the browser window). If you close the browser, the cookie is erased, so next time you try to go to Neo, you'll be logged out and need to log in.  So for CG, what they do is grab the cookie that you're logged in with, and they get their browser to act like yours would (logged into your account when they access neo). If you were to log out, and then log back in, the cookie is reset, so they no longer have a way to get in, even if they CGed you (unless they've changed your word when they got on). It's like when you're logged into one computer, and say you pull out your laptop (another computer), and log into the same account. The cookie will be reset, logging you out of the first computer, and into the browser of the second one. Logging out and back in does the same thing. Loggs you out from every possible computer that you could be logged in on, and logging you into the  computer you're doing it from.  Ehh that was a lot more than I thought it would be, I'm bad at explaining with few words :P."
neopets,3dgk97,missynom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:13:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the explanation!  If you log out (like, before closing the window, actually log out) is the old cookie available for them to use? I know logging out on my computer logs me out on my laptop but I've been just chilling having logged out completely and am hoping if none of my devices are logged in then there's nothing for them to ... ""piggy-back"" onto? I can't think of a better way of saying it.  That could be wrong too but not being logged in is also stopping me from lurking the boards which will probably help to some extent anyway. Hopefully. ;~;"
neopets,3dgk97,Im5andwhatisthis,3,Thu Jul 16 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually 100% sure about them having a cookie available after you only log out (haven't looked at or used an actual CG program/code whatever lol :P).  There are two ways to completely make the cookie they grab useless.   Clear internet history/cookies/saved stuff etc. That erases all cookies you may have for all sites. Log out of neo, then log back in. This replaces the cookie with a brand new one for Neo specifically, so to get in again, they'd have to CG you all over again. So if you log out then in, you can log out again and keep yourself logged out after that, and that will keep you completely safe. Or you can keep on playing, and just avoid petpages/lookups/etc.   Since it takes ~30 seconds to do #2, that's the option I've always done. Even before this point, whenever I visited a page I felt the least bit suspicious of (petpages/etc). I would log out then back in just to be safe before continuing to play."

They'll realize it soon enough, though.

Aren't I lucky?"" just to immediately get a ton of responses saying that item was most certainly duped... :/"

Go on the site but don't go to look-ups, pet pages, or the neoboards. I've always been able to avoid fiascos like these for being exceptionally private on the site and not talking to anyone really. Coming to this subreddit is the most I've talked to other players in my life.  Another thing I did was not attach my Neopets password to my main email account. The email I check every day is not the one attached to my account.  PIN protect everything, don't accept gifts, don't accept neofriend requests, and don't engage with anyone on the site you know. Play the game as if you are silenced. Stay far and away from anything attached to other users. Hold off on making big purchases and don't grab anything off the money tree.  I have been fine thus far doing all of that. But frankly, if you can stand to be off the site for awhile, that's probably the best idea."

And then I'm just embarrassed by all the 12 year old feminists saying a dude smuggling plums on the subway is oppression. I mean they're assholes, for certain, but I just tell them to scoot over.

neopets,3dfpjz,taypodz,2,Thu Jul 16 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"I started playing when I was a teenager in the days of AOL 2.0. For those of you uninitiated, AOL was basically like if 9/11, the national tragedy, was an internet browser. It was a desert wasteland of chat rooms made by 12 year old girls who happened to be home alone. It wasn't the kind of stimulating conversation I wanted, when I was 12 I still had barbies. So Neopets was great for me because I didn't really know how to internet then, but it was a bunch of people that were my age and my speed playing.  I remember playing Dice-A-Roo for eons and never hitting the jackpot. It took so long to load a page back then that I had to schedule my time to complete stuff before I had to go to sleep. So Dice-A-Roo would get an hour, buying items for my shop would get two hours, and games would get whatever time I had left to make back what I'd spent. We're talking a few thousand at a times too. Tops. I would run out of money to play Dice-A-Roo, it was tragic.  I remember hanging out in the apothecary before TNT they were closing it down. I wish I knew why they did that. And why they got rid of the Time Machine Quests. They left this little hint it would be back again someday, and it was the most reliable way for n00bs like me to get levels. He usually asked for omelettes.  I remember people losing their ever loving shit when Faerieland opened. You could not restock in the shops. The bots and players alike were attacking those stores with the wrath of maenads forced into detox.  I also remember being super pissed when people picked the stupid ass pirate paint brush over the tartan paint brush."
neopets,3dfpjz,Totaru,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:09:45 2015 UTC,"I remember those days too! And pretending to be older than you were in chat rooms. Probably not the safest thing but it passed the time!    Oh gosh yes, everything took so long to load. Especially the map pages in Java... I had everything set to HTML (at least I think it was an option then?)    I don't remember either of those! Or maybe I just didn't do them.... I'll have to look them up.    I loved Faerieland's opening omg..... And I also remember the Tartan PB!"
neopets,3dfpjz,zarasol,3,Thu Jul 16 13:27:34 2015 UTC,"Heck yeah, thinking about Neopets ""back in the day"" is always a nostalgia bomb for me, because I've been playing on and off for something like 12 years. I was just thinking today about the time before pet trading when people put like, SO MUCH effort into applications for adopting pets. I never really had pets worth doing all that for, but I loved looking at other people's petpage apps.   And man, don't even get me started on how much better I thought the art style was before customization. I'm STILL mad about that and I really wish TNT would make an ""unconverted paint brush"" or something so I could have UC pets.  I also remember trying multiple times to send in parental permission forms and my accounts never getting permission, so I started lying about my age. Heh."

neopets,3dfpjz,lafl,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:06 2015 UTC,I think so long as there is some way to tell if the pet is actually UC vs. wearing the cloak it would be fine (to retain their function as a status symbol)
neopets,3dfpjz,lafl,3,Fri Jul 17 02:22:44 2015 UTC,I remember spending all of my time of the AC playing avatar simon with random users. Everyone there was so friendly and there were new games all the time. It was my favorite thing to do and I ended up making a bunch of friends. I even got a guy to draw me an image of Bill Nye putting cookies into an oven with his feet because we were ~sO rAnDoM~    I also used to have a stuffed puppyblew and babaa that I was OBSESSED with and would take to all my family vacations.

neopets,3dg2xl,Malbat,5,Thu Jul 16 02:42:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I remember being a kid and thinking MSPP, SUAP, and BGC were entirely unattainable. But, I figured that by posting my account achievements + collat I had available that I might get a bite. In the process, I was also lending out my FQD.   Some guy asks if I will lend him my FQD and that he had no collat, and I agree to do it. He then tells me he doesn't need it and was ""just testing me"" then proceeded to send me his MSPP, and asked if I needed BGC too."

neopets,3dfcl7,gwenzx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"I have said before that requiring a daily visit for a better prize/avatar is not always practical.

neopets,3dfcl7,cheeseonionomelette,5,Wed Jul 15 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"Unless jumpstart changed philosophies, it won't. Since it awards NP, NC won't be involved."

neopets,3dfcl7,multiple_lobsters,3,Wed Jul 15 22:15:46 2015 UTC,"Correct. they asked about requiring NC to use, not receiving as a prize."
neopets,3dfcl7,velocazachtor,8,Wed Jul 15 22:29:28 2015 UTC,Looks like a daily reward for coming back every day. An attempt to keep active users active.   It'll probably work. I'm already thinking about setting a reminder every day.

I do hope it works the same way as the Quasalan Expellibox. The whole FAQ makes it sound like it's a permanent addition to the site, a free slot machine that appears once a day to entice you to log on and do more than simply check if your Premium Membership is still cancelled (<- still not over that).   If it does convert NC into NP in any way... then we'll have to abandon the site, because the economy will be screwed beyond fixing in a matter of days."

neopets,3dfcl7,starpiece,3,Wed Jul 15 20:57:23 2015 UTC,holy crap this is going to generate a lot of neopoints! and I thought ghoul catchers was ridiculous.

neopets,3dfcl7,Candiedonions,2,Wed Jul 15 21:50:05 2015 UTC,Interesting! When will it be available?
neopets,3dfcl7,Asminja,4,Wed Jul 15 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"OH FUCK. This can end VERY badly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/2f5vn9/a_case_of_hyperinflation_in_a_virtual_economy/    I suggest everyone read this. When Gaia online started doing Money generators (similar to this), the economy went EXTREMELY out of whack. so much, that an item that once costed 2 gold, now costs 32K.  Remember what happened with the coincidence, and people Inflating junk items? If they don't do this properly, Expect ALL 1 NP items to cost that much, for worse case scenario. I'm fucking serious."
neopets,3dfcl7,LordHayati,6,Wed Jul 15 23:15:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean how bad could the inflation be? Backgrounds that used to be worth 800K are valuable now. Us restockers really need some value back in the stores. The economy is collapsing now because not even a lot of R98's are yielding profit right now."
neopets,3dfcl7,UhOhFeministOnReddit,3,Wed Jul 15 23:23:08 2015 UTC,"this could make it so piles of dung cost 50K. backgrounds could cost over 4 million, just for the uncommon ones.  this can literally break the game. Remember the situation with zimbabwe's hyperinflation? this can be the same damn thing."
neopets,3dfcl7,LordHayati,5,Wed Jul 15 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"It says the max that can be won is 100,000 and that's after 25 straight days of playing. Also, the way it's worded sounds like there's only the chance of winning that much even at that point. Then, after that 25 day period it resets back to day 1 where the prizes are presumably much smaller. Could this really be worse than something like Food Club which can potentially yield hundreds of thousands on a constant basis?"
neopets,3dfcl7,Col_America,2,Thu Jul 16 01:30:41 2015 UTC,"There's no way. My account with be 15 years old in December. I make at the very least 1,000,000 a week. I mean I hit two 30:10 days and that's well over 600,000 for me right there with my max bet being nearly 11,000."
neopets,3dfcl7,UhOhFeministOnReddit,3,Thu Jul 16 19:06:04 2015 UTC,If they do this properly maybe they could boost the Neopets economy. Maybe all the deflated items will reflate :)
neopets,3dfcl7,harley_quinn1995,3,Thu Jul 16 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting, it sounds like things got REALLY out of whack in Gaia. Arguably Neopets has already felt the effects of gold-generators in the form of flash games, food club, habitarium (RIP), and ghoul catchers, but a lot of items have actually deflated this year due to lowered interest and increased supply due to the restocking changes. (And dupe day, yeesh)  Even if the neoeconomy is flooded with NP like Gaia, I don't think those junk items will inflate-- there's nothing you can do with them and new ones are being created constantly, which is why they're 1 NP in the first place. The Coincidence inflated items because they suddenly had a use and people were buying them as fast as they could refresh the SW."

I wonder how long Ghoul catchers is going to last."
neopets,3dewkw,Sheepalicious,2,Thu Jul 16 01:22:45 2015 UTC,So much. It also irks me that they still the tokens in the nc mall... if the game doesn't exist anymore why are you selling the tokens?

neopets,3dfg4s,Celestial_Cookie,6,Wed Jul 15 21:15:05 2015 UTC,"I guess Neopets has stayed because it really is an immersive MMORPG. It's like other games where you have to discover things yourself, etc etc but it makes playing with others a really viable option. But for me, this sub really made the game more interesting. Before, there was Keyquest and Habitarium to make really easy NP.  Keyquest was an active in real time game, whereas Habi was a farming, passive overtime game. Can't wait for them to return."
neopets,3dfg4s,Hencenomore,6,Wed Jul 15 21:36:28 2015 UTC,Keyquest is supposed to be coming back but habi is gone forever.

Second, I know how you feel - I had to start from scratch about 3 months ago, after a very long hiatus, and I felt overwhelmed too. I can't give any advice - I was playing Ghoul Catchers a lot (though now I barely play it since I really can't be bothered), and only started the stock market a couple days ago (it seemed scary ;-;), so I'm still trying to figure it all out for myself aha o-o   Getting the lab map for that purpose is a really awesome goal though, so good luck getting there, it'll be so worth it. :D Also, welcome back to Neopets!"
neopets,3dfg4s,starpiece,3,Wed Jul 15 21:26:49 2015 UTC,"Ghoul catchers is definitely the best money maker right now. Food club is another one and while you do make a little off it, it's much much more profitable with older accounts bc you can bet more. There's a good daily thread on here with bets to follow so you don't have to make your own.  Otherwise find some easy games that you're good at and try to make 10-20k a day. That plus the 50k from ghoul catchers will have to to your first million in only a couple of weeks. It's definitely slow starting off but it gets easier.  Keep doing those stocks too! It's a waiting game but profitable in the long run.   And yeah restocking you kinda have to wait til your account is older so you can see the higher rarity items that are profitable"
neopets,3dfg4s,MellyGirl123,3,Wed Jul 15 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, I love the name Banootnoot. Also, I've found that time helps out a lot. I made a new account a year ago and thought I was never gonna get anywhere, but I've already got 1 million NP, which I never even dreamed of getting before.  Honestly, just keep swimming. Keep learning, and eventually you'll look back and realize how far you've come."
neopets,3dfg4s,transpiggy,2,Wed Jul 15 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"Play Ghoul Catchers! Replay the first or second level 50 times (it goes by fast) daily for 50k.  Play games like Kass Basher, Fashion Fever, Catch the Petpet, Zurroball, Smug Bug Smite, etc. for really fast NP. You can easily earn 50k+ daily from the games as well if you find games that are guaranteed 1k per play. Shenkuu Tangram and Nova Defender are really easy for example."

neopets,3dfg4s,epicaz,2,Thu Jul 16 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"If you want to be friends, send me a request. I can help you troll the pound to find a potential battledome pet.   Number one: Because you're starting mad small, you need to start by playing flash games until you get 15k and invest in the stock market.  Number two: Restocking is hard, if you want to try to get better at it than have at it. For now, focus on the stock market!  Number three: Start training a pet to go to the battledome-- it's a bit and simple moneymaker. Google 'fast training guides'.   That lab map is a big step, and I only really got it within the last few years or so after 10+ years on this site. But accomplishing childhood dreams is pretty rad, so it's worth it to keep working."
neopets,3dfg4s,livebythefoma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"Hi there! 13 year user here. I'm going to feel really dumb asking you this.. but I've never touched the stock market before.. are there any good guides you'd recommend? Also, in what way is having a good BD pet an easy moneymaker? I have a solid BD pet I've always used for plots and DoN, but not a whole lot else."
neopets,3dfg4s,epicaz,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think you even NEED a guide, tbh. They make it way more confusing. The easiest way to 'learn' is to have 15k handy, go to the bargain stocks page. Look under the table value ""Curr"" which means ""current,"" and find one that's value is 15. That means if you buy 1000 of those shares, it will equal 15k. Click on the name of the stock you want to buy-- right now COFL is at 15. That will take you to the Company profile, click the name of the company again and you'll be at a buying shares page. Put 1000 in the number of shares box and buy them!   You can only buy 1000 shares a day, it's best to buy all of them with one stock. 15 is the lowest priced stock you can buy, so even it it's at the bargain page at 9, you can't buy it.  Pick a amount you want it to rise to before selling it-- most people do 60. So when you go to your portfolio, the ""Curr"" will be 60 or above. That's the time to sell. You sell by clicking the small grey arrow next to the property and writing how many shares you want to sell. The Open price means how much it started out that day. So if it started the day at 10 and is ""Currently"" at 13, then the +3  under Chg (change) means it added 3 to its value. If it started at 13 and is ""Currently"" at 10, then it will say -3 under Chg (change). Buy 15k of SOMETHING every day. You need to diversify your portfolio, and it's a waiting game. Money in the stocks where it might be getting bigger is better than sitting in the bank doing nothing. It's best to bulk up on one or two stocks so take advantage of the days when the price doesn't change, because when it does go up at some point, you'll make mad $$$$.  When you go to buy new stocks make sure to check if something in your portfolio is currently at 15k, if nothing is then go back to bargain stocks and buy something new. If you have any more questions or I confused you let me know!"
neopets,3dfg4s,livebythefoma,2,Thu Jul 16 18:53:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for your detailed response! This is really the best starter tips I could have asked for. I'll go ahead and check it out :)
neopets,3dfg4s,seriative,2,Fri Jul 17 00:18:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry I skimmed the second half of your question but I have advice for that too! The main two people use to make money are Jetsam Ace (if you have premium) and the Koi Warrior. Most will do exclusively one or the other, so if you have premium always go Ace. Ace gives out normal code stones and nerkmids pretty regularly, so on a weekly basis you'll get around 2-5 normally. With each nerk at 50k, you're getting 100k minimum and much more is likelier! If you don't have premium, don't worry cause Koi Warrior is good too. He gives out lots of red and normal code stones, so you can sell those from between 5k and up to 25k, and he gives out a much greater volume so you're looking at least 50k a week.   My build is a lvl 50 with ~90HP/Strength and I use the scroll of knowledge +scroll of the scholar + lens flare to K.O easiest difficulty Ace (or koi warrior). I've tried the harder difficulties and have seen no real increase in good prize drops.   I use my shop till to fund my stocks and food club bets so no money goes out, it just comes in!"
neopets,3dfg4s,acondo2,2,Fri Jul 17 01:04:34 2015 UTC,"what i did before i finally got a little bit better at restocking in the main shops was snipe on the shop wizard. it's definitely easier to do with the SSW, but if you don't have the SSW i'd suggest finding a few ETS items of a decent value, snipe them on the shop wizard from users who keep undercutting each other and then put them in your own shop for a stable price. it's definitely a waiting game like everyone else said; the first few months aren't going to be as fun because there are all these restrictions, but i'd definitely look into all of the games because while you're waiting for access to things that newbie accounts don't have, they'll be your best bet. a lot of games that have low NP payout have high NP payout from a mirror game (check /~Nimelion) so what i do is just find out which pays better, the regular game or the mirror game, then i play the games i really enjoy. i love destruct-o-match and faerie bubbles so i play those when i have free time! ghoul catchers is also a good way to play - i'd suggest actually playing it up to the higher levels to get the items (stamps and amulets) that sell well instead of just playing level 2 50 times a day, since that will be less likely to put you to sleep."

What I did was play some easy games for NP (Kass basher is great when you unlock the ""hard"" mode, wrath of the snowager on hard mode is good to get 1k points just to finish 1 level as well), did all of the dailies (Use the official fansites to get a extensive list, they're amazing), and then, when I got enough neopoints, started messing with the faerieland employment agency (Although they're hit and miss).

neopets,3dfjx0,Malbat,5,Wed Jul 15 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"Getting that draik unfortunately could take a good number of years. There are so few available in the first place and then even less are uft.  But the quickest way: having LOTS of neopoints to do a double unlimited custom to get the best RW/RN you can, then having enough neopoints that you can train a pet using mostly items (neggs & such) so that the process moves quicker than usual, & when you get high enough on the BD stats offering another unlimited custom on that pet for UCs. And even then you have to find the right trader. Easy & quick just really aren't words associated with UC trading unless you get exceptionally lucky.  And there is a UC ufa page somewhere around. Can't remember what it's called. But I know I saw someone who adopted a UC just yesterday and my friend is apping for a UC right now. So it does happen, you just have to always be looking. But the app process is so intense nowadays that I wouldn't consider that the easiest way either.  Sorry if this isn't what you want to hear but trading is a boring, slow game now. It's sad."
neopets,3dfjx0,jennyandthejets,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:52:29 2015 UTC,"I figured it would be slow, I'm just saddened by how tedious it seems to be. It used to be at least somewhat better back in 2012, from what I remember.  What is the most expensive pet/PB combo out there, by the way? It'd be nice to figure out how much I'd need to even hope to try...  I guess I will have to dig around for that page. Are people still expecting ridiculous hoop jumping, absurd petpages that only an HTML expert could do, and your first born child during the app process?"
neopets,3dfjx0,jennyandthejets,2,Wed Jul 15 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"It is quite tedious and there's a level between the highest faeries & UC PDRK where trading is literally at a standstill. The faerie owners think their pets are worth pdrk. The pdrk owners think that their pets are worth higher so very little trading occurs in that tier and that is the one you'd have to breach to get close to that draik sadly. And you still wouldn't be quite there.  UC trading is exceptionally tedious and it puts people on edge with each other and gets tons of users frozen. It is a sad, sad thing how much trouble UCs actually cause.  Ice draik egg might be the highest custom? Excluding FFQ colors of course & a lot of people want a robot draik which can only be zapped or achieved through a very rare item released in the space plot from some years back.  Unfortunately, I think the answer is yes to that. And even if they don't, someone is gonna produce that kind of work and you'll have to live up to it anyways because chances are, they're gonna do for the extensive layout.  It's really frustrating and I don't even UC trade! I have one UC and if she got converted right now, I would be a-okay. I love her name and her species/color when converted. No sweat off my back. But I hate how much it affects the trading scene. :|"
neopets,3dfjx0,Draggonair,2,Wed Jul 15 23:00:49 2015 UTC,TNT should really had left an option to unconvert pets.
neopets,3dfjx0,jennyandthejets,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:41:40 2015 UTC,"Other sites do that & it works for them so it probably would have been a good option. It wouldn't work now since Neo has already faced the worst consequences of their decision. They'd probably be best off just converting all pets. Then, for people who really want the UC art, people could just code over their pet's look-up and use a UC image. With all UCs gone, this wouldn't be flagged as a scamming technique. And if people really wanted the UC art & not just a pet for the status, they'd have them. Not a bad solution I think."
neopets,3dfjx0,facegasm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:51:54 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like downgrading all of the good BD weapons though. People saved and worked up to them so to just take them all away is not going to make them happy. I'd be no happier them taking away (or converting) my UCs than taking away all my avatars or everything I saved up for or all my trophies.  I think some sort of skin for the art would be better than just getting rid of such a huge section of the site which still motivates people to play and stay active. I think it was done badly to start with, but I don't think just taking away all of that stuff people worked for and pretending they didn't exist is ever a good idea - although even worse at the moment.  In the end people can still have a picture of the old art on petpages and lookups but they can't put it over the image and trick people. I could put pictures of the avatars I'm working towards on my lookup but it's not the same as actually getting them after playing the games or whatever to get them."
neopets,3dfjx0,jennyandthejets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:55:02 2015 UTC,"Nothing is going to make everyone happy. shrug But I firmly believe that the removal of UCs would make Neo a less targeted place for people wishing to wreak havoc. In the end, a pet is not a prize to be won anyhow."
neopets,3dfjx0,facegasm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:40 2015 UTC,"The removing of anything valuable would but it would also take away a large part of the game. UCs aren't the only things people buy on shady sites, and those sites unfortunately existed before the conversion and would do if UCs were scrapped - I think you'd upset more legitimate players than illegitimate (who would just continue to sell ill gotten accounts / items / neopoints as they did before).  I'd be really peeved if they took away large chunks of what I've spent time on on the site (ignoring the NC spent to decorate said things). It wouldn't just be UCs, but I think if you did just convert them all the site would be even less active. Not in a spiteful ""I'm quitting because you took my toys"" way - but just all of those people who enjoy the long haul have nothing left to work for in terms of pets. I wouldn't quit out of spite but I reckon I'd get less and less active until I just forgot about it. There's only so much my gallery can occupy me - my pets are a big part of neopets for me, but I don't draw them and don't do much writing about them.  I think if it had happened back then but now it would be like deleting all draiks from the site or turning them all into chombies back when draiks took people a lot of time and effort. People with draiks were more often targeted but I don't think it would have pleased them for the solution to be just getting rid of all draiks from the site and throwing any work they'd put into them onto the scrapheap."
neopets,3dfjx0,jennyandthejets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:36:30 2015 UTC,Please don't get upset about a situation that's not even happening. It's silly to stress about Neopets and I don't want to cause that sort of turmoil. This is just a personal opinion that I'm absolutely allowed to have. Neo is not the same game anymore and I feel conversion would be beneficial. You don't and I definitely respect that.

Edit: This sounded salty but I actually meant it in a ""I'll keep my pros & cons out of your comments"" as I've upvoted a few of them earlier and was only wanting to discuss pros / cons of ways of fixing things on neopets that I saw here. Not meaning it to be confrontational or whatever :)"
neopets,3dfjx0,facegasm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:50:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I gave up the idea of UC trading myself years ago, after I got my krawk (before the massive deflation of krawks). I think it's madness that people get so hung up values that they do this to one another. This shouldn't be causing stress, but alas...  Well, there's almost no way I'd bet a robot draik, seeing how I always have such poor luck with the ray. So I guess enough for an ice draik would be the way to go... and it's not quite as bad as I had thought.  Sheez... And this is why I stopped trying to apply for pets years ago. I can't code for shit, and honestly I would rather not spend that amount of effort for a pet I might not even get. Hours and weeks of my life just isn't fun for me. I never got why these people just can't value accounts and look at the pets people already own, and stuff like that. Urgh.  I know, right? If I had been making the decision at the time, I would have either converted them all with no exceptions, or just had a system installed that allowed for the old art to be used on certain pets anyways. Heck, it'd make a good NPs sink if they decided to release a way to let us use the old art again."
neopets,3dfjx0,facegasm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:47:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of them do look at your current pets etc, but the rarer the pet the more people are going to apply. It's not really a selfish thing, just there are so few of them and so few people have the opportunity of getting the pet any other way, so that is their only shot. I don't like the application system either and don't use it myself, but if you have so many people applying and loads of them seem like nice people they like to have a system other than pulling a name from a hat (or something like that)."

I wouldn't want to do it, I know people put a lot of effort into their apps and I'm not into that, but I also wouldn't want to have to go through them all - eesh!  (Also - a lot of people do code pages and draw art and write stories for their pets and that's the time they spend.

And so I did.   On the flip side, my lack of confidence in him made me not use him on those 3 safeties at the bottom.   Safer, but also more modest. So it goes!"

I feel like today is a good day to get a little risky, put Fairfax in maybe two-three bets and ignore Fran. I could drop a booster but that doesn't usually serve my betting style well."
neopets,3dct61,UhOhFeministOnReddit,6,Wed Jul 15 08:12:31 2015 UTC,"It's past 4 am and I'm about to ramble at you. /warning    I don't think I'm some kind of super-knowledgeable sage or anything about FC.... BUUUUT over the course of the six months I've been betting.....    I used to really lean heavily on Food Adjustments. So shiny... ooohh... That sort of thing. But over time I have come to notice (or ""realize""?) that Food Adjustments are already accounted for in the opening odds (in addition to the pirates' strength).   SOMETIMES there are wacky days: The other day, Harpoon Harry's looked like this:      Pirate Strength FA Opening Odds    Edmund 79 +1 2:1   Blackbeard 76 +4 3:1   Lucky 82 +1 6:1   Orvinn 52 +0 13:1    You can see in my post that I had some heebie-jeebie feelings about Lucky because according to all those stats combined, it was just plain wrong for him to open at 6:1 odds. He ended up winning, coincidentally (or maybe it was all related? oOoOooOo)    But if you take a look at all of the strengths (or win history % if you're looking at Daqtools, since strength is pretty much the same as the win history) and the Food Adjustments and the comparisons between each of the pirates in each of the arenas today, you can sorta see how their assigned opening odds just make sense, ya know?    So Fairfax is kindof an underdog, especially being pitted up against the ""almighty"" Goob in Shipwreck today... Normally, you would expect his odds to be pretty damn high in a situation like this. I'm thinkin' like 13:1. But with a whopping +5 Food Adjustment, it gives him such an edge that he got boosted up to 5:1.     Still, Gooblah is the most likely to win in that arena, as the odds are telling me. And Franchisco is the second most likely to win. THE ODDS ARE SPEAKING TO ME.    I don't even remember what the fuck I'm saying at this point.    I think... BASICALLY, dude, if you wanna have fun, DOOO ITTTT.     BUUUT! I'm preettyyyy damn sure the most important thing you need to know are the opening odds (since I'm preeeetttyy sure that the Food Adjustments and the strengths are all taken into account already to calculate the opening odds....)...

You're awesome. For some reason it never clicked in my head that FA was part of the odds. In my head it's separate for some reason and I think this perspective is going to improve my bets a lot. Thanks again for taking the time to answer this so well because Fairfax was so much more tempting to me than he should have been."
neopets,3dct61,UhOhFeministOnReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"Good luck today!!!    Like I said though, betting leaning more towards the underdog on days like this is still the ""fun"" strategy. And if you're consistent at it, it will pay off in the end, right?  I mean, you see those high risk bettors who hope and try to catch an upset every single damn day.  And it is pretty logical to be wary of an upset in an arena like Shipwreck today.    That's the whole difference between risky/safe bets. Fun/boring. Or whatever you'd like to call 'em.    Someone like me might miss out on the HOLYSHITWTFAMAZING wins, because on a day like today I'll only put a safety a pirate like Fairfax.     But someone who goes consistently risky might see those odds and use Shipwreck as a boosting arena instead of going the Goob-heavy route.Or whatever else tricky strategy they got up their sleeve.    And the consistent risky bettors will probably catch those HOLYSHITWTFAMAZING wins more often, but bust/win smaller amounts other days. It probably gets close to balancing out over time.    tl;dr don't let my ramblings change you if your true dream is to be a ""fun"" bettor. u  do u, dood . and here is a party popper emoji of encouragement 🎉  P.S. ur a champ for enduring my rambling"

neopets,3dct61,maria1593,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:19:21 2015 UTC,Why the hell not?  Crazy but reasoned.  Running with this one.
neopets,3dct61,goofyspouse,3,Wed Jul 15 07:14:53 2015 UTC,"There is a method to this madness. One, fairfax's food adjustment. And two, looking back on the winning streaks, fairfax is due for a win soon (that being said, a few other pirates are also due for a win, just hopefully not today). Gooblie also has ~65% win rate. Going back 9(so including today being 10) he has 6 wins and 3 loses. So I give today kinda having a 50% loss rate for him. So that's why I chose fairfax over goob.  But this is just a game and I'm only dealing with neopoints so it's okay if I'm wrong."
neopets,3dct61,brandnew_perspective,2,Wed Jul 15 07:35:20 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy TT____TT  ... I make the crying face because I totally get all overthink-y about when win/losing streaks are gonna end too.... LIKE WHEN BUCK HAD THAT 5-DAY STREAK AND ON THE 3RD DAY I WAS LIKE ""nah he's never won more than 3 times in a row for over 3.5 years and WHOOPS he went even further... and don't even talk to me about Dan's recent shenanigans.... TT__TT    ... ALTHOUGH, I guess it's not COMPLETELY the same as Gambler's Fallacy because their winning %s are so strongly correlated to their strengths... So yeah, if Gooblah ever magically dips down to like 50% winning history, it's totally fair to expect him to have a winning streak for the next few months in a row... LOL"
neopets,3dct61,-cupcake,3,Wed Jul 15 07:50:47 2015 UTC,"Nope! That's still gamblers fallacy type logic. Assuming each day is an independent event (I.e. that the formula/ random numbwr generator that determines the winner does not factor in previous results), it would make no difference to Gooblahs chances of winning on that day, even if he lost 100 days in a row (although if this was the case I'd start to expect that something was broken). But since the strength of the pirate and the odds are closely correlated, you would expect long term results to eventually balance out given large enough sample size.   If this is confusing, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't make predictions based on a small subset of data since the results each day are (extremely likely) independent and the wins percentage will eventually average out to reflect the actual probability given enough time"
neopets,3dct61,spurplebirdie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"But since the strength of the pirate and the odds are closely correlated, you would expect long term results to eventually balance out given large enough sample size.   Yup, that's more of what I was trying to think about/say. But of course I'm not very good at that, LOL.    When I'm feeling curious, hell yeah I stare at the pirate win history and losing/winning streaks for a little while. And hell yeah I still get those heebie-jeebie feelings sometimes.     But I try to not let that interfere with my bets. I'm free to be as superstitious as I want, but keep that shit contained in my commentary or something. Don't get reckless with the bets, Anisa. My win history would probably not be as good as it is right now if I didn't try to keep my bets logical for the most part (compared to if I depended more on my feelings instead)"
neopets,3dct61,-cupcake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"There are limits. Idk. I still think good has a 6 or 7 out of 10 chances to win usually, however, given fairfax's FA being a +5, it could go either way between the two pirates.  I made the bets when opening and fairfax was only 5:1. He's up to 7:1 now, and that kinda makes me nervous.  I understand a fair bit about probability, so the pirates who are nothing but a streak of red lately will probably hit soon. It's funny, because it's a debate in stats when your using a computer to generate random numbers, are they REALLY random?"

No one is going to die over this, right?  Saw Fairfax's food adjustment as well and it made me ponder.  Glad you did the heavy lifting on coming up with a strategy!  I just got my bronze Food Club trophy mid-month, so if I am going to hope to upgrade it soon I need to make (and hit on) some pretty aggressive bets.  fingers crossed"

neopets,3deeyl,starpiece,5,Wed Jul 15 17:06:42 2015 UTC,For the neocola machine you can just refresh the win page until you ran out of the token colour you're using.
neopets,3deeyl,Draggonair,3,Wed Jul 15 17:13:24 2015 UTC,I started doing that! It sucks when the colours are all jumbled but usually I hoard in my SDB until I have a ton then they all come out together with their own kind (lol)

neopets,3deeyl,roxychalk,3,Wed Jul 15 17:40:45 2015 UTC,you can do the same thing on FC and for the Lodge by just pressing the control button and while clicking the action button; it'll pop your bets and that specific pet into a new page and then you just edit your info on the original page and do it again until you're finished with the task.
neopets,3deeyl,aveforever,3,Wed Jul 15 17:11:42 2015 UTC,WHAT. I'm going to try this when I get home!

neopets,3de00k,LILY_LALA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:12 2015 UTC,Why have people started to say cube instead of capsule?
neopets,3de00k,livebythefoma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:29:47 2015 UTC,"Uh...considering I paused and double checked google/jelly neo's item archives, it's probably just another way of saying it. It probably will distinguish the old ""capsule"" style art (which only guarantees 1 gift box) from the newer art ones that look like a ""cube"" (which guarantees 2 boxes). The official name is still capsule though."

Alright, so lets say I was planing on getting a scary neopet (something along the lines of a UC meerca, not that they don't look extremely dapper because they do :3) would it be against the rules to write a horrifying description for him or her?

I really hope you get to answering this question, because it's been bugging me for a while! crosses fingers please say yes, please say yes! ~ kenzie_and_maggie_10  Your Neopet can have any kind of story or persona you'd like, as long as it follows site rules.

neopets,3de00k,DialsAdder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"If you want to get some idea of the odds, you can look at the spreadheet I made where some people have inputted non-biased data (although the sample size still isn't as big as I'd like):  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xYCBxS-T-Rk0cqtCblERXz-qdHnwr2LBr6CD4fq33G8/edit#gid=756308470  It appears that the odds of getting a FFQ are ~1% per quest, but since there are so few recorded FFQs I would consider that to be only accurate within a factor of two or three. Still, not high. It might be more likely to get one from the grey faerie, but since people haven't been good at remembering to record the prize the grey faerie gives them I don't really know how common that is.   FFQ aside, I consider it to be worth it just for training. On average you'll get 3-4 stats per quest, so in the end the cookie gives you ~40 stats (I could calculate more accurate numbers from the spreadhseet but I can't be bothered right now). So in the end, for $1 US you get ~40 stats on your pet. How highly you value this depends on how high your level is (and thus how much you pay for training) - but for example I currently have to spend 6 codestones per stat trained, so this is like getting 240 codestones for $1! Not bad! And even if you're only spending one codestone per training or something, I'd still think of it as a good deal."

I've seen other pages with updating images but I can't figure out what the urls are- I saw them on mobile so I can't get the source.  Does anyone have a URL for a live updating pet image?

neopets,3de00k,CuntWrap,2,Thu Jul 16 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"I figured out the answer and will post for anyone else who needs to know:  When you right click on your user lookup your pet's image URL is something like this: ""http://pets.neopets.com/cpn/a1b234c/1/2.png""  Change a1b234c in the URL to your pet's name and it'll update instead of just showing what your pet looked like when you pulled the image URL."

neopets,3de00k,Daanni,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:39:13 2015 UTC,"Depends, what's his level?  You can train at the Ninja School if it's 250 or higher. If it's lower than half of your HP (124 in this case) you can't train anything else until you get the level up. If it's between 124 and 250 you can train your pet's strength and defence (up to 2x his level) at the Training School, but you'll have to decide whether you want to do that or level train until 250 so you can do the faster Ninja School courses. Although they're more expensive too.  Jellyneo guides can go more in detail if you need."
neopets,3de00k,SassyPep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:56:27 2015 UTC,"He is level 113, I've been using FFC's to up his stats but I know that I should aim to make them even. Should I focus on strength and then defense or alternate? I've tried to look at guides but I still don't grasp  it"
neopets,3de00k,thegirlwhocannotfly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"Well first you need to train level to at least 124. Before you do that, you can't train anything else. Once you're at 124 you still can't train strength (because you can only train str, def, and move up to 2x your level) but you can train defence up to 248. Your movement is already 120 and that's more than enough, never touch movement again, it's nearly useless.  After that you can train your level up to 150 (no higher) to train your HP, Str, and Def to 300. HP and Str are most important so always do those first but defence is also important if you're going to be using anything to block damage, so at this point it'd probably be good to train evenly. Once you're super high level you can probably slack on defence if you decide to have an offensive technique or something, but while you're at the lower time/np requirements level always train evenly. I'm not at that high of a level yet so I can't tell you anything about fighting styles/offensive technique, sorry.  Well, after level 150 the Training School starts to take a ridiculous amount of time, so you may want to level rush to lv. 250 to enter the Ninja School.  Right, good luck! And good luck to me too, I'm only lv. 63 and super lazy...  edit: you could even level rush starting now if you wanted to. Ninja school classes are only one red codestone when your pet is lv. 250-299, and it may be more cost effective. http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=550194&week=592"

You need the 3x drumstick on the mid/later levels, plus a large number of whatever color that powerup is on.  Additionally, having one of the special blocks that eliminates all of one color on the same level as the 3x drumstick is very helpful, as it makes it much easier to form a large chain of the 3x color.  Finally, having a mix-up powerup is also useful on these levels, in case you can eliminate a sufficient amount of other colors, mix-up, and have a large chain of the 3x form.    I can't tell you how many times I played it and got 2300+ without getting the avatar, only to have bad luck on one of the later levels.

neopets,3dej4o,leachigan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:26 2015 UTC,"Nothing to be sorry about- you've been so quick the past few weeks that I was surprised to not see it here and figured that it may be due to the fact that it was posted so early in comparison to the other ones. Either way, your post was much more detailed than mine, so I'm glad you got it! :)"
neopets,3dej4o,Franseil,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:09 2015 UTC,"Ya, it was 100% due to the earliness. I'm still shocked - it's at least ~3.5 hours earlier than usual."
neopets,3dej4o,Franseil,2,Wed Jul 15 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"First time playing, I got 4050 :( :( whyyyy  edit: 4072. This is a cruel joke.  edit: CONGRATULATIONS!!! Your score of 4,096 beats the score of 4,080 by Brucey B in the BETTER THAN YOU competition! You have won 10,000 NP, a cool trophy and a great item! Well done!  Yay :D"
neopets,3dej4o,Franseil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best advice I have (besides the above) is to restart until you win match #1 BEFORE the WASD mashing. I find that if I can do that, my score is almost always going to be at least 4,100."
neopets,3dej4o,livebythefoma,2,Wed Jul 15 17:41:48 2015 UTC,I can win the first few matches before the WASD but I guess I really suck at the last ones lol
neopets,3dej4o,venv,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"lol. Also - 4072. Oof.   If you can win the first FEW matches before the WASD, you could actually score real high. That's the only way to score a perfect 4,200 which is the max on the game. You're actually pretty good, and could definitely go for a gold in the game itself with some practice on the later levels!!"
neopets,3dej4o,venv,2,Wed Jul 15 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"I think my fingers get tired later on, I'm starting off maybe too enthusiastic and then I slow down. I beat it now though, thanks for your advice!"

neopets,3dej4o,MellyGirl123,2,Thu Jul 16 01:49:42 2015 UTC,"Wooohoo, upgraded my bronze BTY to silver! Your tips helped a ton, thank you! :)"
neopets,3dej4o,hitomi614,2,Wed Jul 15 17:49:19 2015 UTC,Awesome!! Congrats!!  Sorry I couldn't have helped you get to Gold this week. The update was SUPER early. :-(
neopets,3dej4o,hitomi614,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"No worries! Getting gold is a combination of timing to see when the new BTY is out plus being decently good at the game! I'm more bummed I didn't get it when it was Jumpin' Gem Heist a few weeks back, that's one of the games I have a trophy in! :P"
neopets,3dej4o,hitomi614,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"Totally true.  Another trick to getting gold you can do is pre-play the game. This week I knew it was going to either be Tug O War or Sutek's Tomb, so I had scores ready to send for both of them (4114 for Tug, which I used, and 10500 for Sutek just in case). So for me the key was just timing - I already had the score ready to go! For games you aren't good at, that gives a lot of time to practice.  For what it's worth - I'm almost positive next week is going to be Island Chef Academy (with a score around 1500-2000). I'd start practicing that if I were you!"
neopets,3dej4o,XxBlazingWolfxX,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:36 2015 UTC,Island Chef Academy?! I love that game :) I hope I can finally get a BTY trophy!
neopets,3dej4o,goofyspouse,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"well that makes one of us! LOL. I know I can hit the score, but it's one of those games that will take foreeeeeever. Each playthrough is just so slooooow.  I haaaaate ICA. It reminds me of the ""Papa"" games on Kongregate, if you ever play those."
neopets,3dej4o,goofyspouse,2,Wed Jul 15 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"I have played the 'papa' games!! I felt that they were really slow as well. I've never actually played ICA - I've only played the mirror game, but I think the regular version will be just the same.  If you're into fast-paced cooking games, I got Cook, Serve, Delicious during the Steam Sale and it's great. It's really fast-paced, but not too overwhelming."
neopets,3dej4o,Totaru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! Glad someone knows what I'm talking about with the 'papa' games. So funny. The only one of those I liked was Papa Louie (I think that was the name) since it was actually an action/adventure game, not one of the ""serve customers"" never ending games. Oh well.  Thanks for the advice on CSD!"
neopets,3dej4o,Totaru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"yeah, I liked that one too. I didn't get very far though.  I'm not sure how much CSD costs anymore, but when I got it it was like $3.  Also, how do you 'save' scores? Do you have to keep them up until the new BTY contest comes up?"
neopets,3dej4o,ozzyssey,2,Wed Jul 15 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"To save a score, you finish playing the game but DON'T submit your score. You just leave the tab open on the ""game over"" screen. The tab can stay open on that screen for as long as you want, but it cannot be open when the NST clock crosses midnight.  So for BTY contests, you can start playing at 1 AM NST on Wednesday, for example, score a ""high"" score, and then hold it until BTY becomes available."
neopets,3dej4o,ozzyssey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:19:26 2015 UTC,How do you predict what next week's BTY will be?
neopets,3dej4o,ozzyssey,2,Wed Jul 15 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"This is next weeks challenger: http://images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant686.gif  This is the game I think it is: http://www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=1205  It's the same hat and looks like the same character to me. For scores, it's usually a required score of around what the 75th place score is.  For reference, this week was http://images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant685.gif  which I thought could have been either http://www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=909 or http://www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=306  It's a ""desert bruce"" which lined up with the Tug O War picture, but his necklace looks a lot like the symbols while playing Sutek's Tomb"
neopets,3dej4o,OnceUponABug,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Oh nice! I'm not very good at most games (only a select few) so this gives me time to practice if I think I have a shot. Thanks!  What about the scores required? It's obviously a bit higher than average, but by how much?"
neopets,3dej4o,jolandado,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"Usually it's around 75th place from the High Score Table at the time the BTY updates. Right now that would put it around 2000 points. Wednesday morning next week I would recommend re-checking the HST, and try to score something around 50th place to be safe. Instead of sending your score, just leave it in the ""game over"" screen until BTY is uploaded. Then send and collect your gold :D  (you can't save a score from before midnight Tuesday or you will get a score submission error)"
neopets,3dej4o,taypodz,2,Wed Jul 15 18:57:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much for the explanation and tips! I always thought everyone did it the boring ol' way -- refresh until BTY updates, then play like mad until you beat the score. Guess there are always smarter ways :)"
neopets,3dej4o,taypodz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"Always! :D  I find the ""old fashioned"" way of playing after you know the game will more or less have you peaking at Silver. 10 people is such a small number to get gold, that you pretty much have to have a score queued up."
neopets,3dej4o,behonourable,2,Wed Jul 15 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"Finally, one I can actually do!  Just managed to scrape by with 4,088 points, on my first ever play of the game. Was around the 24th person to get it. So glad that I can cross another avi off the list! ;-;"

neopets,3dej4o,MartyMcFlysgirl,2,Wed Jul 15 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"couple ideas:   try playing on medium or low quality setting. You might be able to get a few extra ""A mashes"" in with the lower quality. if you are like me, I usually mash A while watching the timer bar, then flip to the WASD mashing juuuust as the bar hits the center (to minimize the ""time loss""). However, sometimes I go a hair too early and lose out on some A mashes. Try to maximize your A mashes, even if it means starting the WASD mashing a little late. It's weird, but sometimes in Make Some Noise I noticed that my computer registered the mashing too slow, as if I was just holding the key down. Sometimes getting in a rhythym of up-down-up-down etc... is ""faster"" than slamming down the button. Just a thought.   otherwise, just keep trying? Sorry :/"

neopets,3de4mu,Vengerai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:58:43 2015 UTC,Apparently after Lv. 50 you don't have to worry about a level reset.  I've zapped him for a while before when he was about Lv. 415 and the lowest he got to was Lv. 403 after a few months.  Hopefully it's just not like a 1/1000 zaps deal and it happens D:
neopets,3de4mu,trainradio,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"The outcome ""Back to Level 1"" stops being a possibility if your pet's level is high (you should stop getting it at around level 20+ or 40+).   From JN. I didn't know that! O: I once had a pretty high reset, so I didn't realize there was a cap."

Tried meepit vs feepit once and failed so hard. Used a guide and got it after a few tries. There's a strategy guaranteed I just kept accidentally knocking out the meepit.  You have to let it win 2 rounds but knock down its HP to almost nothing before you let it win. Then win 3 rounds yourself. Use only the combos they tell you to.   Also people may disagree but I got the buzzer game my first time playing (maybe like 3rd game ever) during break between classes one day. Use large size so the curser is a lot smaller than the black part you have to stay in. Use a guide, if you type cheese or something you can see the cursor. I used a MacBook and it was convenient bc I could take my finger off the track pad and put it back on without it messing anything up."

Other easy ones: Kacheek Seek (not really, because it can take forever); Destructo Match (only if you have a mouse); Neoquest (I still can't get enough enthusiasm to get them for my current account though.

Today I was so close to getting the first 20, but know for a fact that someone else had one ticket register before mine!

neopets,3dbk8s,Syzeki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:57:14 2015 UTC,"So it's supposed to be that anyone who wins the lottery gets an avatar (it's one of the newer ones that has been released).  However, since they released it, the only people that have been receiving the avatar are those that are first in the list of winners.    Since the names are listed in order by what time the person bought the winning ticket, the people that buy their tickets earlier have a better chance of being closer to the first position (assuming they win, of course).  To be safe, I'm trying to be the first person to buy my tickets each day, that way if/when one of my tickets wins, I'll (hopefully!) be first on the list and will get the avatar!"
neopets,3dbk8s,metalmario1337,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:42 2015 UTC,Aaah that makes sense xD! So is that a bug (that the first person gets it) or just the way they made it. I'd try it but I hate getting up early :3 Bahaha Good luck though :3

I have seen a ton of people claim this, but it seems inaccurate to me. TNT never releases the method of getting an avatar, we are supposed to figure it out (Bonju, Wishing Well). If it has just been the first person in every drawing since the avatar was released, then we should assume that was TNT's intent.

neopets,3dcn2o,etas,2,Wed Jul 15 05:49:24 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge the password recovery still works. Are you 100% sure it's the right email? You should also be checking your junk/making sure Neo isn't blocked, but if it doesn't even recognize your email address I think something else is going on. :( Viacom screwed up the username purge system and now a lot of usernames that should be available aren't (they will say they're available when you go to create them, then the process will glitch and if you try again it'll say unavailable), and you just have to pick something else. If that's not the issue, maybe try a different browser?"

neopets,3d8309,peachroses,8,Tue Jul 14 06:27:17 2015 UTC,"I love NC trading!  When I first started playing neopets in 99, my first thought was 'ugh, why can't I put clothes on my pets?' I was a kid and dressing up dolls and stuffed animals was one of my favorite things. I used to go to build a bear and buy so many clothes for my little stuffed animals.   Now that I'm older I can't exactly prance into build a bear and go on a shopping spree (well, I could, but there's not even one around here and I'm not into build a bear anymore anyways.) So I have neopets! I can dress up my pets and no one ever has to know. And I love making stories and characters for my pets, and making them part of a bigger story. For me it's fun.  That being said, I completely understand your point of view. And you're not alone. Lots of people don't like NC or NC trading. And that's totally fine! Because there are different ways to enjoy the game.  Neopets is really open and diverse, there are lots of different aspects of the site that people like. Some people only focus on one thing, like restocking or food club. Some people write/roleplay. Some people do art. Some people do a mix of all of the above! And all of these are totally legit ways to play the game as long as you have fun :)"
neopets,3d8309,maria1593,8,Tue Jul 14 07:23:50 2015 UTC,"I love the quality of NC wearables relative to most NP wearables. That said, I'm tired of spending money and the hassle of NC trading, so I'm trying to avoid it whenever possible. If I see two customizations of similar beauty but one is NP-only, I will honestly be more impressed with the NP one because it takes more skill to find and combine NP items well.   And all THAT said, I will probably continue to spend money, because there are just some things I really want to own."

They each have NC backgrounds and trinkets, but those are mostly from NC giveaways through the years.  My husband did give me a $25 NC card as a gift once, so I went and bought a crap-load of FQFCs while they were 50 NC, and a NB pen, but I still have almost 1000 NC left and no interest in spending it on stuff!"
neopets,3d8309,kodylaurentia,6,Tue Jul 14 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love NC, it's my favourite thing about the site! 2 years ago I unexpectedly received $50 in the mail from a family member at Christmas and thought 'Eh, good excuse to spend it on Neopets!' I spent it wisely, and here I am 2 years later with hundreds of dollars worth of items and I'll never have to buy NC again. So don't think of it as something that costs soooo much money. I figure it's around $50 to go out and buy a new xbox game or something so it's not too bad considering everything else on the site is free!   NC is all about putting time into your pets and making them look amazing, so to get into it you really have to have passion and creativity. I find the NC boards really fun, and the people are generally lovely so that's a plus. Have a play around on DTI and see if you can create some customizations you love... if you do that with no restraints and NC is for you you'll know it because you'll do anything for that customization you have created!"

There are lots of items I really like, especially the animated staffs/wands. Sometimes over-customizing a pet makes it look cluttered and takes away from the aesthetic that drove me to playing neopets as a child, though. Like, I can barely tell your pet is painted x color!  And, I'm not really one to spend money on freemium games O; Spent a little on PAD, that's pretty much it. I don't mind the customization, but because it looks pretty popular, I definitely get that aspect of being pressured to participate. I still have 300 NC that's given to you for free or something, I have nooo idea what to spend it on LOL Maybe the FQCs but I don't trust my luck, at all :c  ...I also don't understand how trading works.

I don't do mystery capsules anymore; it's not worth the payoff for me. Trading just makes me want to tear my hair out the way everyone wants GBCs for every little thing. It's getting harder and harder to find item for item trades anymore.  That said, I have so much stuff in my closet after years of buying and trading, that I'm trying to find new ways to use what I have. I'm also working on incorporating more NP items into my customizations. Most of my side accounts use very little NC items and I enjoy the challenge."

Along the way I got into some low-level NC trading for various items I wanted for customs.  I mean, I had the caps around!    I'll be honest, while I'd never consider paying IRL money from one of those account/item sellers for np items, I can see the appeal of the ones selling NC items for cash.  If you're going to pay for it, may as well save yourself all the hassle.  For some, it looks like it might even be cheaper than buying all the caps to trade.  I haven't tried it, but I can't argue with that logic."

neopets,3d8309,squeekybird,2,Wed Jul 15 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"I love (some of) it because they are (usually) beautifully drawn. It annoys me when they don't really customize the look for all the pets (like wigs don't look good on 50% of them, there are always glitches on dresses or other random objects, etc.).  I don't like the competitiveness of releasing super rare items and then you have to spend like $80 on GBC to get said item. Sure it's good for their economy and helps cover costs for the website but I might pay more for NC items if I could guarantee I'd get something I wanted instead of a ""chance"" for it.  That being said, if they wanted to JUST do NP, they need to step up their game a little. The more recent backgrounds have been great but some of the first backgrounds they came out with are a little cringeworthy, and some of the species specific clothes/wigs don't even look good on the species they are intended for. Which is kind of absurd imo :x"

I hope everyone has enjoyed all the artwork as much as I have. Congratulations to the winners! Thank you all again for your time. :D We will surely keep you updated.

neopets,3d76j7,boobishly,7,Tue Jul 14 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"When you (presumably) get the Schnelly, make sure your artist has lots of experience doing tattoos without linework, including follow-up pictures taken a long time after, so that you can make sure they do a good job of not smudging too much over time."
neopets,3d76j7,apostolicity,11,Tue Jul 14 01:41:39 2015 UTC,Yup! My tattoo artist has done 7/8 and a bunch for my friends and is very very good! I definitely won't be going to some whack job and I know I'll be happy with his work!   This is really good advice though for anyone reading!! :)

But Peter Capaldi is on point. I like him a lot. I'm not sure I have a favorite episode, but I liked the Caretaker a lot. I didn't enjoy the last few episodes where Danny was dead. They already switch up main characters enough on that show. Please don't give us a new character just to kill him later in the season."

I know you felt the block was unfair and you wanted to get an explanation, but trust me on this, when someone blocks you, leave them alone. Some people can't be helped and there is no use in trying. Take consolation in the fact that if he treats all his potential customers like this, he will be sitting on that stamp for a very long time."
neopets,3d6r42,TalkingHawk,8,Mon Jul 13 23:46:41 2015 UTC,Governor Mansion Stamp   Your right I shouldn't have messaged him again but I was really mad lol. I won't do that again though
neopets,3d6r42,TalkingHawk,5,Mon Jul 13 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand the feeling. I am used to being polite and I expect everyone else to be too - when someone doesn't act that way, I want to know why, what did I do wrong for them to act like that? It turns out some people are just rude for no reason. Don't worry too much about that, there are plenty of people on the TP who are decent people. I'd sell you one of those stamps if I had one; hope you can find a cheap one from another seller!"
neopets,3d6r42,noirthesable,13,Mon Jul 13 23:57:53 2015 UTC,"You did nothing wrong (I mean, aside from the whole side-account-contact-y thing that the other post was talking about, but you get the point already). And JN's last price update of that item was June 14, 2015, so unless there was some hyperinflation going on over the last month (which there doesn't appear to be), I sincerely doubt it's a lowball. We've actually started publicly releasing the TP lots we record on our trawls, so you can see the past offering rates for them here.   We can't get every lot since Neopets is still active enough that a new trade or three is posted practically every second (amazingly), but we do try to keep it as up to date as possible."

neopets,3d6r42,aveforever,6,Tue Jul 14 00:34:11 2015 UTC,All you did wrong was you attempted to interact with a douchebag.  Not your fault.  You couldn't know he was a douchebag until he asploded all over you.  <3
neopets,3d6r42,galacticpoison,4,Tue Jul 14 00:34:45 2015 UTC,Don't worry about it. It's safe to assume that he was just being a greedy drama king or clearly misguided on an acceptable price. Someone on the trading post only wants 430k for it. (Lot 410370273)
neopets,3d6r42,spurplebirdie,6,Mon Jul 13 23:57:11 2015 UTC,I sold mine for like 390k last week (after waiting nearly a month for a reasonable offer) so 450k 425k is definitely not low balling!
neopets,3d6r42,PugglePrincess,6,Tue Jul 14 00:25:29 2015 UTC,"It happens a lot. Best not to take it personally. Whenever someone does that, you should no longer want to give them your business. It doesn't matter how much you want the item, there will always be another seller eventually."
neopets,3d6r42,goateyes,5,Tue Jul 14 00:18:37 2015 UTC,"Once, someone posted dung on my trades before blocking me, just because I couldn't read their mind and (supposedly) underoffered.   Moral of the story? People on the trading post can be douchecanoes who expect you to overoffer AND read their minds. You did nothing wrong, and I'm sorry this happened -- after the dung incident I went impotent with rage and quit neopets for like 6 months because I just couldn't deal with the stress when trying to relax.  Sorry this happened to you :("
neopets,3d6r42,roxychalk,4,Tue Jul 14 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"Plenty of assholes on the Trading Post, you don't have to do anything wrong to get that kind of a response, sadly. I went through the same thing not too long ago, different item, same rudeness. Doesn't make sense but I wouldn't stew about it - their problem, not yours :)"
neopets,3d6r42,SmilkySmoofFur,6,Tue Jul 14 01:59:25 2015 UTC,That happened to me when I tried to a buy a mystery island rock so I replied that I'm just going off Jellyneo since theres no prices anywhere and he apologized because he just didn't like getting lowball offers on purpose. Its just if you're selling something check jellyneo and don't be surprised if you get offers around that number. I still wouldn't pay over 1 mil for a rock when someone was selling them for like 250k less than a year ago.
neopets,3d6r42,Garettesky,5,Tue Jul 14 03:23:24 2015 UTC,Is he the only one selling? There's a few ones selling. I've seen one for 430k
neopets,3d6r42,Garettesky,3,Mon Jul 13 23:31:20 2015 UTC,I offered on that one and they accepted with no problems. :)

neopets,3d6r42,Marissa_,3,Tue Jul 14 10:02:59 2015 UTC,There are a lot of dicks on the TP. I usually only buy from people who have a definitive price on their wishlist. I also post my price on everything I'm selling. I find people tend to offer more on items that are priced more than items that are not priced. I hope you get your stamp though :)
neopets,3d6r42,RedHund,2,Tue Jul 14 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"If you're still looking for one, I'll sell it to you for 400k. I didn't even know it was worth anything and I had one in my sdb apparently. :P   link"
neopets,3d6r42,theonlygurl,2,Tue Jul 14 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah some people are like that.... e.e  I offered the exact amount of NP on someone's wishlist for a dari petpet PB, and they rejected. I thought it was an accident, so I offered again. They rejected. I NM'd them asking them what's up, and they said ""It's my item and you can't tell me who I should sell it to"" . I stupidly followed up, instead of leaving (at the time that was the only dari pppb in the trades) I asked ""Is there any item you want, or a higher NP offer? I'd really like to paint my petpet and I'm willing to work with you to find an offer you like""  They screamed at me for harrassing them and blocked me :/"

neopets,3d6r42,Xwiint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"You can try comparing prices on both JellyNeo and this NeoCodex databank, but I think NeoCodex is outdated for the stamp unfortunately. But it doesn't look like you did anything wrong, just a greedy person not happy with selling it (for an already high price!)."
neopets,3d6r42,Nephrite-Jade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:00:34 2015 UTC,"Neocodex is just programmed differently from JN. As far as I know, for JN, users have to input changed prices. Neocodex uses data gathered from users (through the use of other programs) to price items."
neopets,3d6r42,stardustcross,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people on the tp are incredibly selfish. Was trying to buy a background, only two sellers had it on the tp, I messaged both asking their pricing. One said he was going to accept another offer since it had been a few days since he was last on, which was totally okay. The other guy told me specifically he wanted triple what the other guy with the background was asking on his price page, ""or I can be cheap and wait until someone else had one."" Decided to wait and not pay the ass :D"

I'm thinking of making her totally different, like a robot or something. I just wanna figure my plan out so I can start drawing her! :D"

I did have an issue where it wasn't an option for me in the mall but was fixed after I sent a ticket in! I was able to access it with a direct link though!  And I love opening capsules too! I got some crappy items, but some great ones too! :D I want to buy moreee...I'm addicted lol."
neopets,3d6hrv,Malbat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:36:46 2015 UTC,oh maybe not :( june was the month where a ton of my nc got tied up in nc mall purgatory from the glitching and i didn't have items OR nc to show for it. it's probably a good thing i can't access it - fewer things for me to buy and open and screech about. SAME THOUGH god it's so much fun. even when i get crappy items it's like opening presents without all the messy gift wrap and obnoxious plastic casing that scissors cower at.
neopets,3d6hrv,Malbat,2,Mon Jul 13 22:45:42 2015 UTC,it's like opening presents without all the messy gift wrap and obnoxious plastic casing that scissors cower at.   YES. And who doesn't love opening presents?!?
neopets,3d6hrv,Malbat,2,Mon Jul 13 23:11:01 2015 UTC,nooooooo I get paid on Friday ;-;    How will I survive
neopets,3d6hrv,8bitUnicorn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:41:50 2015 UTC,I don't know! Just live vicariously through everyone opening theres! Luckily it's in the mall until August 2nd so they aren't going anywhere anytime soon!

neopets,3d5m9a,starpiece,3,Mon Jul 13 18:57:58 2015 UTC,Fancy petpets are the best! Which one were you thinking?
neopets,3d5m9a,starpiece,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:52:12 2015 UTC,I'm actually not quite sure! Any suggestions?

If you wanna save up forever and get really snazzy there's always kads and meowclops and cyodrakes. Feloreena, snowbunny and babiths are also super cute.

neopets,3d79fm,livebythefoma,4,Tue Jul 14 01:54:05 2015 UTC,"imo there's no reason to morph him at the moment. Train him as a Krawk, and offer a custom when you are ready to trade him. And then if you decide not to part with him, you can just keep his customization. :)"
neopets,3d79fm,Franseil,3,Tue Jul 14 02:49:50 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. It's totally obvious, but I guess I don't like sitting on things I can't sell. Thanks <3"
neopets,3d79fm,SL13377,3,Tue Jul 14 02:55:26 2015 UTC,"You never paint before having a trade, its harder to trade a painted pet than a person offering an Unlimited Custom because what if they dont want a Draik they want a Krawk? Unlim Customs are a lot better because it allows them to decide."
neopets,3d79fm,Vengerai,2,Tue Jul 14 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"This is good wisdom, thank you."
neopets,3d79fm,Vengerai,2,Tue Jul 14 05:15:32 2015 UTC,No. Stop giving Draiks that much attention. You don't even like them!!! ;)

neopets,3d79fm,Vengerai,3,Tue Jul 14 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"Probably because people are still living in the bygone era where Draiks were huge status symbols, haha. Lots of people still use them (4L/BD/etc.) to try and break into UC trading if they haven't got UCs of their own. They're a fairly safe bet for trading fodder. Also, I think most customisation items look good on Draiks, while they might not work for other species. And of course there are people who just love Draiks :P My favourite pet is a Maraquan Grarrl, I've just never felt anything for Draiks, who look worse as UCs if you ask me."

And it's totally fine, personal preference. :) Except that there are also lots of people who like to waste their time in the PC so they build up Draiks just for trading, haha. I'm sure lots of people find Maraquan Grarrls silly too but it's okay <3"

neopets,3d7cmg,AlipheeseXVI,3,Tue Jul 14 02:19:19 2015 UTC,I think it's because they aren't given out as much from the battledome.

neopets,3d7cmg,livebythefoma,3,Tue Jul 14 03:06:31 2015 UTC,This was my same thought for YEARS. I finally started when I got to level 71 and I'm kicking myself for not doing it the whole time. Chia clown on easy can be one move knocked out with a pet like level 10 probably and it gives the same ratio of codestones as any other challenger.   Edit: just read your other comment about starting it lol! Good luck on your BD endeavours

I don't actually really understand how the BD factors in your pets strength and stuff into battling so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, but investing into one or two Scrolls of Knowledge should be getting you to easy K.O.'s of someone like Jetsam Ace/Koi Warrior."

neopets,3d6mvw,Fleecie,4,Mon Jul 13 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was quite a riveting week. (Shoutouts to Dawn and the hosts if they happen to be on this sub!)  For those that don't poke around the Art Chat, sometimes we have theme weeks where people enter the Beauty Contest with drawings of a particular theme. These theme weeks are unofficial and completely organized by passionate BCers. The round from 6/26 to 7/3 was steampunk; upcoming theme weeks are riot week from 7/17 to 7/24 (this one is different in that it is a protest and slightly controversial) and RPG week from 7/31 to 8/7. I think you guys would be interested in the latter, which is still a couple of weeks away but it's never too early to start designing and sketching!"
neopets,3d6mvw,Bebeness,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:35 2015 UTC,"I did a drawing for steampunk week too, here :)  Kinda did a drawing. Sorta commandeered another drawing.  What is riot week about?"

I was also amused when you had those ""notice me, senpai!"" messages. :D  I'm not the one in charge of the page but if you contact Dawn she'll likely add your drawing to the gallery! (Her lookup is linked in the credits of the Home section.)  As for riot week, its goal is to appeal to staff to make changes to the BC system to prevent people from entering repeat entries/winning with the same drawing, and to stop people from spam advertising outside of the Art Chat. The controversy arises from the second part because the suggested solution is to ban BC links in signatures offboard."
neopets,3d6mvw,maria1593,2,Tue Jul 14 02:12:26 2015 UTC,"Wow! These are so gorgeous. I think my favorite are these: this one looks like it could totally be game art, this one is very scifi-anime-esque, and I love how the lighting looks on this one, which could be from a children's book or something!"

neopets,3d6aov,UhOhFeministOnReddit,4,Mon Jul 13 21:25:12 2015 UTC,The shops clear out after a while now instead of sitting filled with items no one ever buys.
neopets,3d6aov,everythingshines,4,Mon Jul 13 21:26:21 2015 UTC,That part I knew about. I check on a side when I start suspecting a ban. It's how quickly they're happening that shocks me. :(
neopets,3d6aov,everythingshines,2,Mon Jul 13 21:46:49 2015 UTC,Oh I'm sorry. I hope you can figure out what's happening.
neopets,3d6aov,Probably_not_aladdin,3,Mon Jul 13 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"My theory is that I RS'd a couple R99s and maybe that's something that triggers the ban. They weren't super great R99's. One was a neohome 1.0 item, and a real ugly one at that. I've always thought doing really well can trigger one too, and it was the hottest streak I've hit in awhile."
neopets,3d6aov,spinlighted,2,Tue Jul 14 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"I thought neopets' restock ban existed before mutiple browser tabs existed, so if you're refreshing a shop more than once every 5 seconds (pr something ludicrious like that) flags suspicious activity, and may warrant a RS ban :P  Refreshing once per 5 seconds was crazy fast when the only available browsers were safari and I.E. 3, but a couple things have changed since then."
neopets,3d6aov,E6E6FA,3,Mon Jul 13 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"See, that's somewhat along the lines of what I thought. I didn't think the settings changed, but that 'suspicious' behavior was ignored because the internet evolved and the methodology to RSing changed. I knew things hadn't been changed in awhile, but I'd always been pretty good at circumventing bans and it just shocked me. It seems like they're really cracking down on cheaters. I've been bumped up the book award list due to freezes, which never used to happen. Now this. I love that they're trying, and I do like how severely it discourages the AB'ers, but it is as you said, a bit ludicrous to consider 5 seconds per refresh too fast.  Thanks for the well thought out answer."
neopets,3d6aov,E6E6FA,2,Mon Jul 13 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"I think once you've been banned, it's easier to get banned for the next few days. That always seems to be the case for me."
neopets,3d6aov,E6E6FA,3,Mon Jul 13 21:47:06 2015 UTC,That's a pretty reasonable assumption. I remember before the updates getting banned once on HPD. The next day I went back to RS and got banned in like 12 seconds lmao.
neopets,3d6aov,Totaru,2,Mon Jul 13 22:11:37 2015 UTC,The shops seem to stay clear for longer too. :(
neopets,3d6aov,Totaru,4,Mon Jul 13 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"That's a good thing though, IMO. Lord knows the deflation is already horrible as it is. They can't add enough new items to offset it in the stores. They should have prepared a massive new item dump before updating."
neopets,3d6aov,8bitUnicorn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"Ah that is true.... I still get beat to the items though hah! It seems as if the lag hits me at the perfect time, from the shop to the haggle screen."
neopets,3d6aov,8bitUnicorn,3,Mon Jul 13 22:25:28 2015 UTC,My theory is it's from everyone going after that one single item since most of the stock in Neopia is worthless now. You're not alone there. I used to be able to RS during peak hours pretty handily. Now I wait until around 8-10 west coast time to RS. That way you only have the night owls and AB'ers to deal with.
neopets,3d6aov,captainflyte,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:21:15 2015 UTC,"Ah that's true. I found a later time when it's a bit easier, and especially during the week versus the weekend."
neopets,3d6aov,Xwiint,2,Mon Jul 13 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"I have a theory on this since i started restocking.  I believe there is some sort of hidden 'refresh limit' each user gets for a duration of time. Not how long the duration is, mind, it could be something like x refreshes per day, or maybe per hour, or every 3 hours... Who knows. But because of this, the more shops you restock at, the easier it is to get RS banned.  I noticed it more when I was restocking four shops with a rough duration of 15 seconds per refresh (I set a timer to let me know when i can do the mass refresh for each shop). I got RS banned twice because of that. I ended up cutting back on shops and setting my timer to 30 seconds per refresh (and I even count an extra 5 before refreshing second shop) and haven't had a problem since. For pro-restockers, though, I imagine this may hurt sales.  keep in mind, just a theory I'm forming."
neopets,3d6aov,Xwiint,3,Mon Jul 13 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely go down to 3-4 shops and see how that turns out. I think my biggest problem is right now I've been RSing stamps, shells, and coins. Those shops don't have much valuable stock popping up often save stamps, and the autobuyers make stamps damn near impossible to succeed in. I'm taking all theories seriously since I know diddly squat about that stuff.  I believe I heard someone mention the way the auto stuff gets by the captchas is because of the black outline on the neopet you have to click to haggle. Like, it can somehow recognize it, or something. If they made new captchas without the outline wouldn't that work? Or at least render the ABers obsolete long enough to come up with a better method? I wouldn't mind a letter and clickable captcha on the haggle page. Something more effective than that is likely possible, I dunno. It just seems like after so many years they have the technology to fix it."
neopets,3d6aov,Xwiint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe suggest that to jumpstart? Not sure how successful it'd be, but it'd be nice to be able to step into some of these high-demand shops and have a little more of a chance.   I been doing the low demand shops to play it nice and safe, and only poking my head in of high demand ones every now and then. Sitting on a a 6 mil item plus so 100k+ ones that people usually only need for quests or high-risk battledome users."

I get that but also, there are certain days when those shitty pirates look less shitty than usual and because Stuff (and Squire) usually have such high odds, betting on them usually results in a big win. I usually place a bet on them when they havent won in a while (14 rounds or so) if they have better odds than usual and if their FA is 0 or positive. It can totally be worth it - I ten bet Squire once when his odds were 5:1 and ending up winning 290:10."

neopets,3d3nwg,aveforever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"Can you explain what the ""total expected ratio"" means? I've seen people posting it but I haven't figured it out yet."
neopets,3d3nwg,starburstjellybean,2,Mon Jul 13 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"Sure! The total expected ratio is basically a weighted average of the expected outcomes. You calculated it by multiplying each possible outcome by it's probably and then adding them.  So for example, let's say we're playing a game of dice. You pay $1 per roll and I give you $4 if it lands on 6 or nothing if it lands on any other side. The probability of winning $4 is 1/6 and the probability of getting nothing is 5/6. The total expected ratio would then be (1/6 * 4) + (5/6) * 0= 2/3= 0.66667. This means that if you play an infinite number of times, you can expect to win an average of 67 cents each time (i.e. you would lose on average 33 cents per roll)   For food club, a total expected ratio of 24.5 means that the average payout you could expect (if you were able to place they bets everyday for forever) would by 24.5.   I like this measure a lot because it's a really easy way to compare bets."
neopets,3d3nwg,spurplebirdie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:37:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes sense! I see how that would be helpful for comparing bets. I usually try to go with whoever has the highest percentage chance of profit rather than bust/partial, but that doesn't take into account the variances in profit. For example, I did get a profit yesterday but I was bummed that I missed out on that 92:10 that a lot of people hit. Thanks for explaining!"

That means that ever since February, I have almost doubled all of the money I ever bet on Food Club since then. With my older account age, it's over 11million NP profit!    You can also see in my history that I had a pretty rough start. Lots of days where I busted. Even a handful of losing streaks. But even in my worst month, I still profited overall.

On a serious note, I don't think this would be hard for JS to do. It seems like the flash images of neopets aren't entire pets, but sections of them joined together (from playing around on dresstoimpress). Apparently jellyneo has something that already makes neopet hybrids, and I'm guessing it uses this. It would be easy for JS to do if they made all the hybrids uncustomizable just like UCs.  At the very least, it would make things more interesting at the pound chat."

That's why neopets is failing now: all the younger people find those other sites way more interesting.

neopets,3d5s0w,Xwiint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:33:30 2015 UTC,I never spend a thing and have just hoarded everything for 14 years...

neopets,3d5s0w,xtwistedxlovex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:37:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of budgeting and a lot of things people in here have already suggested. I just wanted to echo them in support. Flash gaming is a great way to make NP but the trick is investing it into something that makes more.  I usually keep like 200K on hand even. An easy amount so I can keep track of what I'm taking in vs spending. I flash game and make about 20K. Then I do my dailies which includes buying 15K a day worth of stocks. If your account is young this is one of the best ways to make NP, but it's the long con. You want to wait until the share price hits 60 before you sell, but you'll make hundreds of thousands to millions for your effort.  Food Club is still great even if your account is young because you're going to get back twice what you bet on a typical day. There's a daily FC thread in here that has some really awesome bets posted by great players every day. You don't even have to learn how to play to benefit from it.  Ghoul Catchers is an easy 50K a day for playing a game similar to Candy Crush. Restocking is awesome, but I'd suggest studying the stores you want to RS in on the Jellyneo Item Database. There's been a lot of deflation so only reaaaally rare items make NP. It's easy to learn what those are, but it takes time.  The Battledome is awesome if you have premium, you can win Nerks for fighting the Jetsam Ace. If you have a regular account, you'll get red and tan codestones. Which when hoarded for a good month can make you a nice half million."
neopets,3d5s0w,UhOhFeministOnReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:32:49 2015 UTC,"I mostly do games, actually. At least 50k a day if I do all of them (can't play Ghoul Catchers so this is my main income). Then Food Club, Battledome, stocks, lucky things from dailies. Edit: Oh, forgot. The Faerieland Employment Agency pays out too. 5 a day max, I believe?"

It's also sort of stalkerish but hell, I'd do it, just to find out what the pet name was."
neopets,3d37ct,maria1593,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:18:29 2015 UTC,I found the pet name!  It's a RN that I really really love.  Is it bad that I'm considering asking her if she can still get into the account??
neopets,3d37ct,maria1593,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"It's ok, it's an innocent request born from love for Neopets :') I don't like beating around the bush, though. If it were me I would confess right off the bat to this person why I'm talking to them and if they'd be willing to give me the pet. Once they answer that vital question, if they are willing, then y'all can start worrying about if they can get into the account and all those other logistics."
neopets,3d37ct,Rimmsel,7,Mon Jul 13 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I've got a good story similar to this. I used to roleplay with a group of friends that I met on neo waaaaay back a while ago in our ~Magic Wolf Roleplay Guild~. We were about 13, really shitty roleplayers, but became good friends and had a lot of fun nonetheless. Fast forward to when I picked neopets up again my freshman year of college out of nostalgia, I logged back in to my account and found that none of them had continued playing and were all spotted a long, long time ago.  Now, while roleplaying, our guild would host pictures we drew of our characters on various petpages. So naturally I went rummaging through the petpages, finding the photobucket url to different pictures, looking up the account on photobucket to find other pictures they had uploaded. I found one user's deviantart because it was the same username as her photobucket account. For the other three, I found some more recent character art with names, which I then searched on deviantArt to find the same character with the same name and find their current dA usernames.  I found all four of them, and we got back in touch. We now follow each other on tumblr."

It's an extremely unique name, so I plugged it into Facebook and boom, there she is. She even lives in a city about 20 minutes from me hahaha. I haven't tried to contact her because that's weird, but I did briefly consider it.  edit - of course her other 3 pets are names like Fuz_Butt1984, Yello_Dudezzz459, etc (I made those up, don't stalk the owners if those actually exist).

neopets,3d3nwe,Shokuji,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:45:25 2015 UTC,Could I ask you how Dyeworks lending works? :)
neopets,3d3nwe,E6E6FA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:18:14 2015 UTC,"Of course :) The lender sends you the item to be dyed, in my case, the Mint and Aqua Flower Wig and you buy the dyes and dye to your heart's content and send the original back to the lender when you're finished.  In exchange, you give the Lender a GBC, since the lender is using up a box to send you the item. Other traders may ask for a wishlist item or a  Dyework potion instead.  I'm not the best explainer but I hope you've gotten the gist of it!"
neopets,3d3nwe,Shokuji,2,Tue Jul 14 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay! So if someone did that, what is the benefit? You don't keep the original item, but do you get like.... The recipe or w/e?"
neopets,3d3nwe,E6E6FA,2,Tue Jul 14 00:33:23 2015 UTC,"For the lendee, they get to own the item in 3 possible colours.  Sometimes the original item is very expensive or difficult to obtain/trade for such as the Cherry Blossom Garland, Peaceful  Tree Garland, Rich Golden Eye Makeup. So it's a cheaper way of owning the items in some fashion,  as these re-colours go for around 1-2 caps in value.  They also provide us with more customisation options. I have a Pink, Royalboy and Island Flotsam and I use the Dyeworks versions of the Peaceful Tree Garland with them (Yellow, Purple and Pink). I don't care for the original at all."

I'm going to south carolina to spend a week with my mom, she just moved there. Her house is 3 miles from the beach, so I can't wait to be on the beach all day haha!

For my 21st, I went on a group trip to Japan for a couple of weeks and got to see my host family from high school again, which was pretty much the greatest. When I went before, my host brother was eight, and now he's twelve and taller than me ;w; okay that's not hard to do whatever  We stayed a week in Kumamoto, a week in Gifu prefecture, and the last couple days in Tokyo (along with day trips to Hiroshima/Miyajima the one with the deer, Osaka, and Kyoto).  The entire trip was great, but my favorite part was probably the look on my friend's face when a deer walked up to her and took a chunk out of the map she was trying to read. ^ u ^"

I celebrated mine almost 2 years ago (my birthday is Tuesday!) and it was super hilariously fun! My friend's family took me bowling during the day and I had my first legal alcoholic beverage, AN ASIAN HOOKER! That's what it was called. Also I got 3 strikes at bowling.    Then I went to a movie. Can't remember which but it wasn't very good! My parents took me to dinner that night and bought me a Caramel-apple-tini! It was the tits. I highly recommend 10 of them!    I can also relate you to your Organic Chem exam! I took mine the spring before my birthday (so a few months before) and passed it! Just remember to study and go through it carefully! You'll do excellent!  Anyways, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 21 IS THE BEST! HAVE A GREAT TIME. DON'T STRESS! :D"

In a nice non-smoking area, that was also right in the front of the bar so the ladies in corsets who bring drinks for free, only if you are at a machine, would pass by often. Finally found that machine and sat down and was waiting on my winnings!!!  ...

Visiting this one cave I know of and rock climbing in it would be swell. Or ziplining (though I don't know of any place near here to do that). Skydiving sounds awesome too, but I don't know if my family would let me do that. LOL. Not that I need permission, but I don't want to cause them insane stress.

The time shared there was irreplaceable.  My friends and i literally jumped until we couldn't jump anymore, and almost died of laughter.  It was pure and sheer bliss.  So, since that day, i've decided, you're only as old as you think you are.

Do you have any other exams after that? Any plans after everything's over?  Alright, so, my father has promised to give me weed galore once I become an adult. We've talked about this over and over (I'm in my mid-teens) - he's going to get my aunt to make weed cakes and he's going to supervise my high because he wants my first to be handled carefully so that nothing stupid happens, as would probably happen if just done with a couple of friends.   I'll be living in England by the time my 21st comes around so I'm hoping he can take me to this Chinese place he always talks about when we get on the topic of moving back to England. After that I'm hoping that my mother and I can play some fighting games - my dad always brags about how she used to play Tekken and Street Fighter while they were in uni, but she doesn't really play that much any more. I'd like to play some games with my brother, too. Beyond that, I think that's how my ideal 21st would go over, haha."

You're clueless right up until the point that it all 'clicks', if that makes any sense.  I think it's really responsible for your dad to let you try weed, and experience it in a setting where people are there to watch you and take care of you. My brother did that for me with alcohol, and I'm forever thankful for him for doing that.  I really want to visit england. Will this be your first time going? Or have you visited many times before?

I was born in England, actually, and I go up there to visit family every few years. I'm so excited to move back!  My mum hasn't played too many games in a while, but I'm hoping I can get her back into them. I think the most intense she's played in a while are Wii Sports Bowling and Tetris."

neopets,3d1ggp,Intermatic,12,Sun Jul 12 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is restocking high priced items. Games are slow. Stocks are good though. Food club is better, depending on your account age. I prefer selling at 60. Its a better return, though it takes longer. Which is more important? Large amounts of np or speed?"
neopets,3d1ggp,velocazachtor,2,Sun Jul 12 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"Personally, large amounts of NP. That's why I'm using the stock market in the first place. Although it'd be nice to supplement this with some fast gains too.  I haven't quite got the hang of restocking - I tried to buy and sell a Gravy Nightmare item for 2k, still haven't got it sold.   My account is only 3 days old, but I first started playing 8 years ago."

neopets,3d1ggp,spurplebirdie,5,Mon Jul 13 02:12:16 2015 UTC,Battledome is a good Neopoint earner! The Koi Warrior awards a decent amount of both tan and red codestones which sell for a tidy profit. So it might be worth it to train up a pet to at least be able to one hit KO a few of the BD challengers.
neopets,3d1ggp,WheresTibbers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:58:29 2015 UTC,What would be the average NP value of the prize from the Koi Warrior (including the NP prize and the NP value of the item(s) given)? How much training exactly would be required to beat the Koi Warrior? And how much would this cost?
neopets,3d1ggp,lethalcheesecake,2,Sun Jul 12 20:38:20 2015 UTC,u/acondo2 is keeping stats for koi warrior. It shouldn't take much to train your pet up using the pirate academy (dubloons are really cheap these days)- but it will take some time. I think it's worth it in the long run. Good luck!
neopets,3d1ggp,ohcherub,6,Sun Jul 12 21:24:41 2015 UTC,My stats will be up next week for a months worth of battling Koi Warrior. The Kreludan S750 Defender Robot would be a good start while you train for the Koi Warrior! The Robot is a lot easier to battle and still drops codestones. I've gotten at least 400k during my Koi Warrior battles so far and it takes about 5 minutes to do the daily battles.
neopets,3d1ggp,lethalcheesecake,2,Sun Jul 12 21:39:46 2015 UTC,Awesome! I have one more day of battling the giant spectral mutant walein! I'll do chiazilla next.   edit: typo

neopets,3d1ggp,Syndaquil,3,Sun Jul 12 22:48:37 2015 UTC,"The difficulty only changes the amount of NPs you can win that round. But since it all caps out at 1500NP total, it doesn't really matter what difficulty."

You'll be hated, but respected.   If you have fast Internet, you should consider becoming an auction sniper. If you know what's profitable, and ets, you can get quite a bit of np that way"

Reselling takes zero skill whatsoever, all it requires is enough np to start off buying stuff. Look for cheap, buy, then sell for normal price. Simple, and effective.  Source - I resell lazily, minimal effort/caring about whether I actually sell my items quickly or not. Still works out pretty well."
neopets,3d1ggp,czneo,3,Mon Jul 13 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"Restocking is best since one potion can make you 500k profit (I missed a yellow kacheek MP because I thought it was too basic but found out it goes for about 700k) as well as weapons and stamps. But it's hard because you have to sit and refresh the page hoping one stocks that isn't a bad MP and get it first.  Also food club. I've made almost 300k in four days, which isn't as great as other people's returns, but I'm not confident enough to place max bets (which is almost 5000 for me)"

neopets,3d1ggp,jawnsnuh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"Most of them restock for under 100k. But you won't be able to see them for several months, given your account age. Your account needs to be 3+ months old before you see the potions that are even worth buying for profit."
neopets,3d1ggp,czneo,2,Sun Jul 12 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"Shit, I knew I should have kept my 8+ year account. I didn't think I was going to need it again, so I went on the forums and mouthed off about Scientology, lol.  Given these circumstances, is there anything worth restocking other than potions?"
neopets,3d1ggp,livebythefoma,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:34:53 2015 UTC,"I doubt you'll find anything profitable until your account is at LEAST 1 month old, which is when you'll be able to start seeing items up to rarity 94. I doubt you'll see any unbuyables, but shops like Plushie, Clothes, Books, Foods will yield some items worth turning for profit.  And to follow up on the comment thread below me, the most expensive potion I've restock lately I paid ~130k for and it was a Maractite Krawk Morphing Potion. Almost every other one I've restocked has been under 100k."

neopets,3d1ggp,Hencenomore,4,Mon Jul 13 00:16:36 2015 UTC,"OP's account is three days old, so your first suggestion will be available in 2025, and the second is entirely dependent on OP having premium (which I would not recommend until the payment issues get sorted out)"
neopets,3d1ggp,Hencenomore,2,Mon Jul 13 02:40:44 2015 UTC,"If you have premium this is one of the easiest ways to make at the least 50k a day-   You need to acquire a battledome pet with the Lens Flare ability + ~60HP + like Scroll of Knowledge/Scroll of the Scholar (that's just what I use? It works fine.).   Fight Jetsam Ace. Use Lens Flare + the two scrolls. One hit K.O. Collect nerkmids.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE PREMIUM- fight the Koi Warrior. I've never gotten nerks from him but he gives out a ton or red codestones, which are like 10k - 20k each."
neopets,3d1ggp,Hencenomore,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:08:23 2015 UTC,does he only give out nerks if you fight him on the hardest difficulty?
neopets,3d1ggp,Probably_not_aladdin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:23:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, I fight him on the easiest difficulty as it goes quicker (1 hit K.O.), but I've heard that you are more likely to get nerks on the hardest difficulty. I did that yesterday, and it was way more of a pain and I got zero nerks (compared to the 5 I got the day prior on easy)."
neopets,3d1ggp,diceroll123,2,Sun Jul 12 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Stocks are a good investment, but imo 30 is too low. I always aim for 45-60+ when I sell.  If all you're focused on is making NP, games are way too slow for the reward they offer. It might be a decent boost to income early on, but once you reach even 500k it's way less worth the time. Dailies can be worth it though if you get lucky.  Daily Battledome wins are worth training a pet early on, I'm not sure what the best beginner opponent is (Koi Warrior?) but you can get Codestones and Nerkmids if you have premium, which will quickly pay for the cost of training.  Food Club is a good way to make NP but unfortunately the amount you can bet (and, therefore, earn) daily is based on account age. I've gotten roughly double my daily bets on average all-time, which for me is 85k a day profit on average but for a 3-day account it would be ~500np a day.  Restocking is also gated based on account age. The highest rarity item that can stock is 99 (well, 100, but that is very few and far between) and higher rarity items generally will net you a bigger profit. You're not able to see rarity 95-100 items until you hit 3 months of account age and you'll only be able to see 90-94 items at one month. It's definitely worth doing when you get there, though, but be prepared to do research and potentially lose money as you learn what to buy and what not to buy.  Auction sniping and reselling can also be very profitable, but, similar to restocking, you need to do a lot of research. If you choose to resell you'll need a high working amount, you'll need to know what high rarity items are worth and what they've most recently sold for, and you will need to be very patient in a lot of cases. As a result reselling is probably the most profitable way of making NP once you're very experienced in it.  And always remember your bank interest."
neopets,3d1ggp,Draggonair,2,Sun Jul 12 21:29:11 2015 UTC,"Nah, you don't want to sell at 30. I'm going to copy/paste 'cause I'm lazy:   Scorecard  The longest runtime to 60 is 601 days. If you deposit 15k into the bank at the highest interest rate you will have 16,997 after 601 days; if you sell at 60, you will have 60,000. That's ~43k more profit from stocks than bank interest. And that's the worst stock.  Selling at 45, the longest is 401 days. If you deposit that 45k you will have 48,203np after 200 days. Let's go one step further - the shortest runtime at 45 is 166 days. After 435 days that 45k will have grown to 52,216np - still not as profitable as selling at 60."

Therefore I reccomend getting your pet up to a level where you can defeat the Koi Warrior-- the returns you can get from codestones will quickly make up for the investment in training.   Happy hoarding! I like your style."

neopets,3czrup,desertharpy,3,Sun Jul 12 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry, only just seen this! It's basically the same as in the board above, but the higher the odds the ""riskier"" it is, I'm not very good at maths/explaining, but a lot of safe bets are smaller odds, because the payout (whilst not as great) will be more likely to happen! (i think, someone correct me if I'm wrong!)"

I've been making crazy bets over the last week (and getting lucky), but that has been because the odds have been weird and ""standard"" betting seemed boring.  Today, however...there seems to be zero reason not to go with historically-wise bets like yours.  Best of luck to all of us following these bets today!"

neopets,3czxvz,apostolicity,9,Sun Jul 12 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"A long ass time ago, Flot and Jetsams were literally fish. Like guppy fish. It might explain why they're so fucking small since they didn't get size changes along with their updated dolphin and shark designs.  Similarly, the reason why the Eyrie is so goddamn huge is because it used to be a dragon like neopet called the Cerpull, which was a literal dragon on two upright legs. Translate that to a griffin on all fours at that height and you have what's in the chart.  I wish I had an explanation for the Meerca but I don't.They've always been rodent things... As people below have pointed out, the height factored in their tail length from previous poses.  I'd link to old neopets pictures but I'm on mobile and lazy. Linked!"

neopets,3d2wc5,FiveTail,5,Mon Jul 13 02:24:17 2015 UTC,The clothes would go with the pet if you were to transfer it back to the original owner though. The only way to keep pb clothes is to pound the pet.
neopets,3d2wc5,Marante,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:19:17 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, actually? No one in the last thread I started mentioned that at all.  So, say, Person A transfers an unclothed Ice Usul to Person B. Person B clothes the Ice Usul with Ice Usul accessories, and transfers it to me. I then take the Ice Usul's clothing and transfer it back to person A. Would the clothes still return to Person A even though it wasn't Person A's clothes in the first place? I'm quite confused."
neopets,3d2wc5,maria1593,3,Mon Jul 13 03:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, paint brush clothing will follow a pet of the same paint/species whether or not they're attached to the pet, so you'd have to pound the usul if you wanted to keep the clothing and not the pet... Your best bet is probably to keep an eye out for a pounded Ice or Maractite Usul, since people will probably not want to do a pound transfer with their pet..  Sorry for not commenting on your last thread about this, I saw it and thought about this but it was confusingly worded so I just stayed away."

I think it's more about getting an item to resell and make a profit on and less to do with ""Yes I just crushed that person's dreams"".    It's more about money and greed than purposefully crushing your dreams.

I think it's a privilege to get an item for a price that's 50% of what I should actually be paying.  It's frustrating to lose a bidding war, but if you're getting the item for such a good price, then it's only fair that you earn it through vigilance, and smart on the spot thinking.   The real scummy ones are the ones that bid > TP price for something.   I personally respect auction snipers, since they give the person auctioning their item the respect they deserve. Imagine how shitty it must be being a user,  and reading a message from TNT saying that their pastel paint brush just sold for 150,000 NP. Competitive auction poaching gives the auctioning user the honor of giving a semi fair price for their item.  EDIT: Wording"

Haha I don't have any night lights or anything so if I get freaked out I just snuggle my SO haha.  Do you have any recommendations that are like that graphic novel? I would love to read more like that!
neopets,3cw3gj,WheresTibbers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"Dude, Junji Ito has a HUGE body of work just like that. All quick reads, well told and terrifying. I wish I could suggest other horror authors as good but I read a lot of graphic novels and he's a one of a kind. I'd definitely suggest Black Paradox next. After that, if you just look up his body of work, I'm being completely serious when I say you can print it out and just throw a dart, because they are all legit. But Black Paradox is definitely second place to Uzumaki for me.  Outside of his work but still in the horror genre The Walking Dead, Preacher, Hellblazer, 30 Days of Night, Bodyworld is good but it's not so much horror as just disturbing and weird. To be honest there's not a lot of great horror out there, in my experience (Keep in mind there's probably a lot of people who know more than me), horror is a pretty dry well in comics for some reason.  It's part of the reason The Walking Dead title went off the shelves so quick. That comic isn't good, and Robert Kirkman is kind of a huge hack if you've read his other titles. He's not a good writer by any stretch of the word but his shit flew off the shelves because it was zombies and because Tony Moore did the art for the first 10 issues. I have to diverge off this topic though, because I could go on forever about why Robert Kirkman is like the worst human being on the planet.  But you're better served with quirky and subversive titles. Going down that rabbit hole is how I found Uzumaki, so I can certainly point you in the direction of some freaky, but not totally horror titles if you want as well. I'm really grateful you read Uzumaki. It always gets me really excited when people read stuff I'm into. The live-action movie is a truly awful Japanese language subbed piece of shit. I would not watch it lmao.   Edit: If you read this entire thing you are a champ. I was desperately trying not to ramble."

neopets,3cw3gj,UhOhFeministOnReddit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"It's both. The author, Junji Ito, takes what you know and distorts it into something terrifying. For example he uses pretty girls as a metaphor for the spiral. They're mesmerizing, so much like the way a spiral can mesmerize via hypnosis, you'll see a female character develop this attribute to horrifying results. So no matter how outlandish the plot is, very human themes make it very visceral and real."

neopets,3cw3gj,Shikogo,4,Sat Jul 11 22:29:03 2015 UTC,I'm going with you today :) I'm feelin' it Mr. Krabs!
neopets,3cw3gj,peachroses,3,Sat Jul 11 22:36:29 2015 UTC,"Shikogo, as thanks, are there any pets or characters of yours I could draw for you?"
neopets,3cw3gj,E6E6FA,4,Sat Jul 11 23:04:29 2015 UTC,"Um. Let me be straight up honest with you, in part because lately I've been feeling so shitty that I honestly don't give a crap anymore what people think of me.  I draw for myself, and I have a jealousy problem. I get mad at people better than me. Or people who try to give me advice (who usually are better than me). I hate it, I want to not get mad and jealous, but it's something I wasn't able to change as of now.  The past week or so, in general, I've been unreasonably angry. Mostly at myself, but, having nowhere to put all this anger, I've lashed out at people who tried to talk to me a couple times.  So... while I would probably appreciate it, I'd probably also get upset because of how good it is... I mean, I just looked at your profile and your drawing got more upvotes than any of mine ever got... I dunno. Your call I guess... I think there are people who deserve it way more than me, though, I think.  My favorite pets are probably Calestia (my favorite, I drew her a couple of times, also Laurok, Cethil (who's missing his pirate accessories because he's on my side and his stuff is on my main) and USK16 (my first pet. hence also the terrible name). So those would be the option if you really want to do it..."
neopets,3cw3gj,Shikogo,8,Sun Jul 12 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"No problem, I actually totally understand! :) You can't easily change the way you feel, even if you want to. I definitely understand that (and also struggle with a similar feeling over something as well.)    For now, I won't draw you something, but maybe in the future when you are more comfortable - the offer will remain open! :)    Also, I know you've been dealing with the heat and stuff, and I hope that you are able to resolve those (not the heat, unless you become Jack Frost) because I think you are a super nice person! A lot of people rely on you for FC (which at times I hope it doesn't make you anxious!)    Thanks for your patience and continued support in the community. If you ever need someone to rant to, I can get down on a good rant! (Especially about the heat - I live in Florida! URGH.)"
neopets,3cw3gj,E6E6FA,2,Sat Jul 11 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"You can't easily change the way you feel, even if you want to.   Yeah, but I'm working on it. I'm now in therapy again. Depression sucks.   For now, I won't draw you something, but maybe in the future when you are more comfortable - the offer will remain open! :)   If you want to draw something, do so! If anything, if you draw characters that I love maybe my brain decides not to focus on the jealousy this time. Who knows.  The heat isn't really a problem anymore, at least right now, it's cooled off significantly. Let's hope it stays that way for a while :I   If you ever need someone to rant to, I can get down on a good rant!   Thanks for the offer, but I'm probably not gonna take it. I have people to talk to (including my therapist), and most of the time just talking about it doesn't do too much anyway. I guess those are problems that only I can solve (although I really don't know how yet)"

neopets,3cw7cl,Bebeness,6,Sat Jul 11 07:58:28 2015 UTC,"I get what they're trying to do, but I don't think they did it well. Those teeth are waaaaaaay too high, and since you can see the outlines of the lips it makes it really awkward. It really creeps me out tbh but that's just my opinion I dunno"
neopets,3cw7cl,felidaedalus,2,Sat Jul 11 08:00:29 2015 UTC,"I really like the wraith one, but I just can't get over that mouth lol. I'm so nitpicky x-x"
neopets,3cw7cl,Malbat,2,Sat Jul 11 08:02:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe a little bit high, not waaaaaaaaaaay too high."
neopets,3cw7cl,Malbat,2,Sat Jul 11 08:05:58 2015 UTC,"The teeth placement makes sense if you take into consideration they're behind the flesh of the face.  To be honest I think it would have looked freakier without face outlines, and they put them there (hence it looking strange) to prevent children from peeing themselves or something."
neopets,3cw7cl,foryeve,7,Sat Jul 11 08:50:04 2015 UTC,The placement works if you think about those things under the nose as flaps covering their actual mouth. Still don't like transparent pets though.
neopets,3cw7cl,weaviles,2,Sat Jul 11 08:14:05 2015 UTC,Hm I suppose so. I always thought of it as the actual mouth lol. But I totally see where you're coming from
neopets,3cw7cl,seriative,2,Sat Jul 11 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's easy to do that. I don't recall any other pet that has those mouth flaps. So it's hard to compare..."
neopets,3cw7cl,maddieaddie,6,Sat Jul 11 08:12:02 2015 UTC,That's funny in an unsettling kind of way.
neopets,3cw7cl,guiltea,3,Sat Jul 11 08:50:56 2015 UTC,That... Is horrific :(
neopets,3cw7cl,iSmirinoff,2,Sat Jul 11 15:56:53 2015 UTC,it's a 2d drawing of a 3d creature so the placement of the teeth actually makes sense to me. if you lifted the muzzle to look at the teeth that's where i'd expect them on an animal like the ixi! then again i think this is creepy-cute.

However, the context of the hover code was a different lookup. I'm hopeless with this >.<  How fix? I'm not sure why it comes out all squished-together when I add the awesome art. It should look more like this, stats excepted."
neopets,3cz7g1,Fleecie,2,Sun Jul 12 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"This is an easy fix! Look for .chibi in the code and add margin-bottom: 270px; declaration.  Why 270, you ask? It's a matter of math. The height of the .chibi div is 500px but you're pushing the div up by 770px because of the negative top margin. Everything else after it (the blockquote and the links after it) also gets shifted up 770px so it gets squished. To make up for it you want to push the stuff back down so you take the difference between 770 and 500 and then use that value as the margin."

You can find specific item pictures from http://items.jellyneo.net/ and tons of regular pictures from http://www.drsloth.com/ . Even something as simple as MS paint can help you to zoom in on a picture and see if it matches the mystery pic exactly. It's pretty damn difficult most of the time.

neopets,3cz7ph,Ro-Dent,18,Sun Jul 12 03:04:04 2015 UTC,It's a dick thing to do but it's not a scam.
neopets,3cz7ph,piperandcharlie,6,Sun Jul 12 03:30:23 2015 UTC,"I think you can just use a side to use Shop Wizard. It's rude what the other player did, but I could argue two different scenarios why the player isn't scamming by neos rules. Could be a young player that uses the price on the item instead of SW. Or, if it's intentional, it's an implicit misleading not a direct misleading which is freezeable, it's up to you to buy or not. But for the second one, I could counter argue that it's similar to TP misleading, but I would then note that the TP seeks a particular item, whereas in Shops it's about user set prices. Hence, it's implicitly misleading compared to Market prices but at the end of the day, in this scenario it's up to the buying user to judge whether the price is right. The burden is on the buying user, technically. The revenge for such an action is not to do business with such an individual."
neopets,3cz7ph,Hencenomore,5,Sun Jul 12 03:21:39 2015 UTC,"I like your reply. Maybe it's not against the rules afterall. But still, even if it's still ""cheap"" in relative terms, 1000% markup is silly."

neopets,3cz7ph,goofyspouse,11,Sun Jul 12 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"Please don't report this.  This is not a scam at all. Some people have really big shops that are stocked really well specifically for faerie quests, because some people like to find the items for quests on their own instead of going to the boards. In order to ensure that the quest items don't sell out immediately from random people, they have to price their items a little bit higher so that the average person doesn't buy it.  Also, It's just 1000 neopoints."
neopets,3cz7ph,-cupcake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:10:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Reporting shit like this is a PERFECT example of distracting TNT from doing things that actually matter.  I can kind of understand OP's indignation, but jeezus...it is one game of Kass Basher.  Just let it go."
neopets,3cz7ph,goofyspouse,2,Sun Jul 12 03:54:38 2015 UTC,"... Whut? They are board moderators. This is their job. To read the boards. Read reports. And do/don't do something about it.     TNT (programmers and the like) are the ones doing the ""important"" stuff. They're the ones actually working from the office, unlike mods who just work from home. I think they distract themselves with whatever official shit they do.... or don't do. lol"
neopets,3cz7ph,-cupcake,2,Sun Jul 12 04:17:18 2015 UTC,"I know what you are saying, but is ""board moderator"" even a thing anymore?  I picture everyone on the support side of things being ""all hands on deck"" with all support-related issues.  If that isn't the case, they are doing an even worse job than I had thought previously.  If tasks ARE compartmentalized like that, shame on them for taking so @#$(ing long to resolve the most simple of requests.  :-("
neopets,3cz7ph,goofyspouse,3,Sun Jul 12 04:21:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That was the whole shitstorm thing with the boards and filters and asshats the other week. Something went -boom- with the office move, no one was actually in the office to fix it since it was overnight/weekend, and the ""moderation team was not able to access and appropriately manage the Neoboards"" from home.    Neoboards reports get handled very quickly, in my experience. I save my reporting for things I know deserve it.     A spam board on the help chat ""look at my UL"" (with a pic of a gaping asshole on their UL ಠ_ಠ)... I reported it and 2 minutes later, both board and account gone. I saw someone on the kad boards today just outwardly flaunting the fact that they were using someone else's old account. I didn't even report that one - but I've got a good hunch of who did - anyway . . . their posts were all cleared from the board maybe 10 min later. I forgot their UN so I couldn't check their UL, but at the very least they got a warning about it since their posts disappeared.    The ticket system? Now that's a whole other story. IDK what even goes on over there."
neopets,3cz7ph,peachroses,2,Sun Jul 12 04:28:47 2015 UTC,"True, they do seem to clear up that kind of nonsense quite quickly.  I am still saddened to hear that they have a moderation ""team"", but cannot resolve issues that affect people on a more direct/personal level with the same efficiency.  THAT ""team"" needs more bodies, not the one sanitizing the boards.    The ticket system? Now that's a whole other story. IDK what even goes on over there.   LOL!  Well said."

neopets,3cz7ph,peachroses,2,Sun Jul 12 04:10:55 2015 UTC,I understand what you're saying. I also don't think that a 1 np item needs to be 1000. If the item was priced at 100 np it wouldn't sell out. They could buy 1000 at 1 np and price them at 5 np.
neopets,3cz7ph,TubOfSoda,7,Sun Jul 12 03:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending the player, but marking items up to 1000 NP makes it so that they can use sales history to document what they need to restock. It's a lot easier than keeping a mental checklist."
neopets,3cz7ph,tabbicat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:36:29 2015 UTC,But then they wouldn't make any profit.  It's expensive to maintain a faerie quest shop. It's really hard work. 1000 np is definitely a fair price in my opinion.
neopets,3cz7ph,seriative,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:21:20 2015 UTC,Only if there were 1000 at 1 np to buy. If you start buying lots then the price goes up. Who knows... After buying 1000 perhaps the lowest priced item would be 1000np.
neopets,3cz7ph,iSmirinoff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:23:12 2015 UTC,"Most items that people think are junks will rise to about 1000np if you buy up 500 of them  Source: I do this almost on the daily, and it sucks waiting on the prices to go back down."
neopets,3cz7ph,-cupcake,-2,Sun Jul 12 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"I wasn't meaning it to be literal. Regardless, 1000% markup seems inappropriate when helping people on the quest board. I tend to be the type of player who buys and sells at fair prices though. I understand a markup but when advertising to help people who can't search, it seems unfair. I'm not reporting her, I just wanted to check."
neopets,3cz7ph,tabbicat,4,Sun Jul 12 03:27:29 2015 UTC,"consider a real life equivalent. i live in a tourist hub, where lounges and casinos often ban outside drinks. if i want a coke in one of these places i can probably go get a can from the bar. for $5. when i could walk out of the place to a convenience store or a grocery store and get a six pack for $2 that sounds absolutely awful and usually i just avoid going to tourist spots entirely to avoid the rage it inspires. is it shitty? yes. is it illegal? no. they're trying to make a profit. same thing with neopets. is it shitty? sure, if you think it is. is it against the rules and considered scamming? no. the user is trying to make a profit."

I'd rather them NOT release something if the artwork is not up to standards, or is rushed.    I myself join the bandwagon of hating on JumpStart, but mostly due to what I always mention - that I miss the passion of previous site owners. I hope that they can continue to progress as the new owners, but I haven't really seen them make much of an effort.    I do agree that the community is a bit quick to jump on them, but most of us are veterans to the site, and expect it to be a certain way and have a certain feel, which isn't a bad thing."

I agree communication is hazy at best, nonexistant at worse, but JS is busy tackling broken code on the back end.    Are they? If this were Wikipedia, I would toss a big ole [Citation Needed] after that.  All I have been seeing them doing of late is adding items with artwork that many people are up in arms (but I cannot seem to locate two fucks to rub together) about.  If they were addressing the back end, you would think they would be shouting it from the rooftops.   On top of all this people feel so entitled to expect these things now flooding the support services while cursing the very support they help bog down.   Speaking as one of the people actively contributing to the rabble about how hard JS is sucking, let me just say that you hit the nail on the head here.  I say bitch and moan all you want in this forum, but don't take your petty frustrations to TNT.  It is like calling 911 to report a jaywalker.

I'm not seriously upset about it - I'm disappointed by some of the newer nc wearables, but I hardly use nc anyway. Neo's early art was terrible so the new stuff is weirdly nostalgic for me.  I think people are just frustrated because Viacom was a mess and people hoped that JS would bring a much-needed change to the site, but instead things have only gotten worse (from our perspective, anyway).   I actually feel that JS has better communication though (which isn't saying much). Old TNT interacted with the users but never about anything important."

If you're under the impression that people didn't complain about bad art, broken features, lack of communication or inaccurate statements from staff before you are very much mistaken - its just that these things are happening with pretty much every update now instead of once in a while.

Anyone who's been around hasn't really been asking that question, to my knowledge (edit to add: but the people who have been around, can and WILL discuss it, myself included; it was a huge draw for me to the site and a source of a lot of fun, so it's annoying as hell that one of the biggest things we ask for is something that currently they can't provide).  I can agree with you that the complaining is getting a little obnoxious; I don't think it's a popular opinion to broadcast as a Meta but nonetheless you aren't the only one with that opinion. It makes getting on the sub less fun when you log in and see a full page of ""did you see this hideous/misspelled/broken linked (insert nearly anything on the site here)?"".

Does that mean people shouldn't be able to vent about it? No. That's kind of what this whole forum is about. Being able to say what you want without site-related ramifications. I find it extremely helpful to just click ""hide"" under the posts that aren't interesting to me for whatever reason (expired giveaway, 9th rant about xyz, newbie asking where KQ went).  And also just because I want to say it, could they maybe stop releasing items and just work on the website? I don't give a flying fuck about adding two new items seemingly every day. Fix the content that people want. Once you have things on course, release items as needed. I feel like a record, but maybe it's just because I've been saying this in my head every time something breaks with Neo and we're rewarded with ""check this new shop item out""."
neopets,3cu0fv,roxychalk,3,Sat Jul 11 03:51:43 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly so surprised with how many people saw KQ as their main reason or one of the main reasons to play. It's not a criticism but I just feel like I really missed out, it was always so laggy for me and difficult to get the minigames working at all so it felt like a drag to make some extra np. I hope when they bring it back I'll be able to try it again and feel some of this. I was peeved about Habi but when that went it was made clear it was never returning.  I agree with you on items but I think it's because there is a large number of players who don't really post on boards / reddit / facebook and just want to see everything running smoothly and probably aren't really noticing anything except downtime alerts."
neopets,3cu0fv,facegasm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:05:35 2015 UTC,"KQ was horrible for me for a long time - even more so when people used to just random quit out when I was 3 spaces away from winning my gold key. That annoyed me to no end. But once the laggy minigames were fixed, there were only two that were broken, it was fun to play a board game online with someone else who shares the same interest in a website as you. I think that was what I liked most about it. There aren't many (any?) other games on the site that you can play with other people. World Challenges are a joke because I felt like the ones I played on, people were hella cheats. And the only game I'm super good at (Kiko Match II) they won't even accept the high scores I send despite them being legit scores. So meh.  I didn't play Habi but I heard it was a huge NP maker so I'm kind of sad I missed out on that. I honestly don't know anything about it, I think I loaded it up once and was like ""no clue what I'm doing, click click click"" and then never again. Sad, I wish I had played it."
neopets,3cu0fv,roxychalk,2,Sat Jul 11 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"I think the world challenges are still broken at the moment but I never got into them.  I used to play KQ every few weeks or couple of months, play to max keys one day and then leave it for ages again. Also I used to get booted out, probably not that often but probably about 10 times over all of the games. It always seemed like such a broken game with the minigames, the glitching and me flying across the board into a far corner, and the booting. The prizes never seemed worth it but I can see the appeal of actually playing with other people, although I was often left 1 move from winning and the game being quit as well. I think they should set something up so if you've got all the keys and someone quits you get the gold key anyway - it works whether they ragequit or are booted and doesn't really hurt anyone or make it any easier to cheat somehow.  Habi took a while to get to level 50 but after that it was just a NP farm really. You had to leave it open and then just collect your np basically. I can see the reasoning behind getting rid of it for sure I just miss checking on my P3s and that easy daily free np."
neopets,3cu0fv,facegasm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"They implemented a system that ranked players based on how often they disconnected so it was easier for you to play with people who weren't asshats. But yeah I totally agree with you on that :)  Oh okay, well Habi still sounds like it was fun! And lots of people miss it, I wonder why they got rid of it? Just because it was an easy NP farm?"
neopets,3cu0fv,roxychalk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it was because they never intended it to be played in the way it was - leaving it open all day and all night and stuff.  I hope when they bring keyquest back it's more playable. It does seem fun but the minigames and the glitches always just made me not want to play much. Even when I got much better internet there was still no point in playing the minigames, they just lag so hard it's impossible.  Oh and I do remember the system it was like green was really good, blue was okay, etc etc. Colours might be wrong but yeah it was a good idea. I'd just like it so that whether it was someone being a sore loser or someone being booted through no fault of their own with bad timing, the person still playing gets what they should."
neopets,3cu0fv,facegasm,2,Sat Jul 11 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"100% agree with that last statement. Especially if you put the time into that game, it's like hi, I just wasted 15-30 minutes for zilch.  I would LOVE to be able to play with Redditors too :) In my old guild we had a ""race to 5k"" game where we were required to play until you had 5k in neopoints racked up (which took forever but I am WAY into board games so I was down) and only then could you complete the game. We wound up with like 9-12 keys in each color haha but yeah. Tons of fun :)  I hope when they bring it back they fix some of the broken mini-games and in general make it more playable, for sure."
neopets,3cu0fv,roxychalk,8,Sat Jul 11 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that the complaining is getting really old. For some reason no one connect new team = new art.   HOWEVER, I am very annoyed with the lack of communication the new team has with the community. I feel like the only way to get answers is to hope they address it in the NT, which is rare. If you want to keep people coming to the site, you kinda have to acknowledge them more than once in a blue moon."
neopets,3cu0fv,WheresTibbers,4,Fri Jul 10 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"If you want to keep people coming to the site, you kinda have to acknowledge them more than once in a blue moon.   You'd think that but in reality that's not true. You still play, I still play, all these people complaining everyday still play. Ever seen Willy Wonka? People loved that shit because nothing was ever heard from Willy Wonka. As long as they were able to enjoy the chocolate the mystery of the inner workings of the factory added to the excitement in a very subconscious way.  /s"

neopets,3cu0fv,WheresTibbers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I don't think TNT has ever been good at communication. Not from what I remember, anyway."
neopets,3cu0fv,guiltea,3,Sat Jul 11 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that some people are overly negative towards JS as a whole but I think you're so off base by saying that we shouldn't pick apart the artwork. The artwork is a gigantic and important focal point of the site and there are standards we rightfully expect to be met which JS has not been treating properly. Our use of the site is absolutely conditional and it's important to remind people of that.   Self-entitlement is a generational issue, not a fanbase specific issue."
neopets,3cu0fv,Turbobutts,2,Fri Jul 10 20:09:52 2015 UTC,"You know when I first started playing Neo the draw to it was not about the art work. Check out what the faeries used to look like.  http://neopets-archeology.tripod.com/Uber_Fire_Faerie.jpg  http://neopets-archeology.tripod.com/5Light_Faerie.gif  http://neopets-archeology.tripod.com/Uber_Water_Faerie.gif  http://neopets-archeology.tripod.com/Uber_Dark_Faerie.gif  They used to be called uber-faeries too, which was weird. I couldn't find an easy to link one of the Earth faerie but she looked like an anonymous Partridge family member.  I don't think the art is a big deal because back then it obviously wasn't a draw for people. I think a lot of people, if they'd been around in those days, would feel the same way. A lot of people in this sub were around in those days and I think they can sometimes forget the art is kind of secondary to the game itself.  The only bad art that really does annoy me is the wearables, especially since I have four legged pets that don't customize well to begin with and appreciate extra effort in those designs."
neopets,3cu0fv,UhOhFeministOnReddit,2,Fri Jul 10 23:02:51 2015 UTC,"The art in regards to wearables is appalling sometimes. I also think that trying to keep art consistent should be a goal (hi cloud Xwee plushie, cute but doesn't match anything else? mah galleree iz r00ned). I actually liked the old artwork for a lot of things, including faeries :x The new ones aren't bad either. I have to agree with a lot of what you said and thought maybe I should respond instead of just upvoting."
neopets,3cu0fv,roxychalk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:42:04 2015 UTC,"The faeries were awful and I remember them even though those links don't work but the pets were cute and the site saw much more growth once the pets became significantly cuter. There's a reason Neopets plushies in Happy Meals drew people in and it wasn't, ""Oh the way these pets look make me think the site is fulfilling on a content level."""
neopets,3cu0fv,Turbobutts,2,Fri Jul 10 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"Ah shit, sorry about the bad links. I must have clicked view image instead of visit site, which I do all the time. -_- My bad.  I totally agree about the uptick in users once the art improved. It was definitely an exciting time for people who'd been playing the game from the 1999-2001 era. It was an awesome time to be around on Neo. I guess I'm biased because the internet back then (as you know) was mostly text based and people did everything through mailing lists, mirc rooms, and Yahoo Groups lmao.  The innovation of the site really bowled me over because it was one of the first truly immersive and multi-faceted websites on the internet period. It truly did change the way people viewed and used the internet. Neopets basically revolutionized gaming and so when I think about that kind of stuff it makes it easy to overlook the art. I will say that I'd hate to see the quality of art stay at this level. That would suck.  I think the best thing players can do to improve the quality of the site is pay for premium, invite new players, buy NC items, buy merchandise and turn off adblock when browsing the site. They need money to make a better product."
neopets,3cu0fv,UhOhFeministOnReddit,2,Sat Jul 11 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"Save your mock outrage for the staff that were laid off due to poor business decisions by JS. They took a beloved website/product and shat all over it. And make no mistake that this is a PRODUCT, people pay real money for it so yeah they have the right to complain about laziness and ineptitude.   If JS couldn't foresee that cutting all your staff leads to decline in quality and content then they deserve to go under."
neopets,3cu0fv,wat_lmao,4,Fri Jul 10 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"I'm actually outraged some people weren't fired sooner. If the company you is losing money and users for 10 years straight, then the employees are part of the problem."
neopets,3cu0fv,6thninja,2,Sat Jul 11 05:05:22 2015 UTC,"YES YES THIS.  I don't get why everyone is so butthurt about the old staff being fired when 1) Neo has been going downhill for a long time and 2) lack of communication has ALWAYS been a problem.  I think the people who say that the old TNT were ""passionate"" about the site are deluding themselves.  I for one welcome fresh new faces.  As you said, a new team probably should have been brought in much sooner.  It just might be too late now."
neopets,3cu0fv,everythingshines,3,Sat Jul 11 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"I'm in complete agreement with you and /u/6thninja. When the announcement was made I was actually kind of relieved. Half the reason Neo has declined so much since its glory days is because it's exactly the same as it was ten years ago, just with clothes for your pets.  Old TNT did nothing to bring the site forward with the times."
neopets,3cu0fv,guiltea,-2,Sat Jul 11 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry pudding, but when a site that people pay real money to - and even those who don't pay may be subjected to a lot of obnoxious, site-slowing ads to compensate JS for their presence - puts out artwork like the rainbow baby blu?  Please.  And who buys a site with a 16-years established art style and fires the artists who created that style and doesn't expect problems?"
neopets,3cu0fv,aveforever,3,Sat Jul 11 00:52:48 2015 UTC,"Neopet's art style evolved A LOT in 16 years.   Also, come on, you realistically aren't going to be using 95% of the new items whose art you dont like, what does it matter. Never in my time on neo would a rainbow baby blu ever excite me"
neopets,3cu0fv,6thninja,0,Sat Jul 11 05:07:04 2015 UTC,"The Rainbow Baby Blu is shitty and Jumpstaff should be embarrassed of releasing such an unpolished item, you're right: no one here was going to use it anyway.  But doesn't mean they should half ass it and release it though.  If anything they should have just not released a Rainbow Baby Blu that day."
neopets,3cu0fv,everythingshines,0,Sat Jul 11 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"100% agree, my time on this sub has been dwindling as the level of bitching rises. I'm here for food club, to read the occasional funny neo post/story, and then I get on with my neo life off the sub.

Go to the properties of the Firefox desktop icon (assuming you have one - if not, create one) and add ""-profilemanager -no-remote"" at the end of the Target box. Then when you double-click the icon it will open profile manager - where you can create a new profile or choose which one to use - and allow you to have two different profiles open at once.

Haha  No but seriously, I've achieved a lot of my dreamies so far, including an Alien Aisha (albeit without clothes). I had an unhealthy obsession with Neo and the internet in general when I was a preteen.  But dammit if I don't spend an hour a day on this site, haha. Mix it with Reddit and you get one big, mildly informative, time wasting cocktail."
neopets,3ctz0l,aveforever,3,Sat Jul 11 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"I played when I was a kid but after I was hacked, had my poogle/snowbunny stolen and then got frozen ""for my own protection"" I quit for many years. I made an account around 6 years ago but only kept interest for a few weeks/month. I came back last year because I found out a friend of mine played and she convinced me to dig up my account again (original childhood one long since purged). I played KQ all last summer, made my first million, bought a PB and a draik and have since fulfilled a lot of my childhood dreamie pets because it's a lot more feasible. Now I love NC and customization, zapping in my 2 labs (never had those before either), doing dailies, trying to up my avatar count and food club. The advent calendar has always been awesome too. And I never did a plot or anything before but I recently did the altador plot and would like to see a new one soon. I think finding this sub is what's kept my interest. I love being able to talk about my accomplishments and see everyone else's too.  I do think the site is breaking though. If they could just have not fired all the artists and kept up with the high standards of items, pet colours, releasing things on time (pastel gelert), news updates then everything would still be fine. And if KQ came back too. And things stopped being glitched. And they really need a better customer service department. People who actually answer tickets and don't make you jump through hoops to get accounts back for something as simple as forgetting the birthday you used. Same with all the people who were actually frozen unfairly (not the ones who claim to be innocent but aren't)"

Years back you could lose your board on the Trading chat in as short a time, or less, as the Pound chat now.  The userbase has just shrunk enormously.  Sure that isn't the current staff's fault, but you know what is?  Stealing people's money by un-canceling their premium, failing to answer help tickets in a timely manner, not meeting their commitments regarding site issues (I notice they don't even talk about NC card redemption in the news anymore), etc.  It's just a combination of things that are their fault and things that aren't, and being the company who owns the site, well they're the only ones to hold the bag."

neopets,3ctz0l,Feloreena,2,Sat Jul 11 00:24:34 2015 UTC,"I actually came back to Neopia just today for a joke and ended up reflecting on it. Honestly, if there was a game out there that was like Neopets but was less sheltered due to being a game designed for kids, I'd be playing it today. I think it's one of the things that sites like Neopets are able to do well.  Neopets just had so many things going for it. There was so much you could do every day and still feel like you were just playing it casually. Not only that, but one of the things that games like these allow for is creativity. I remember back when there were comics revolving around the desert area and, at certain points, you could actually fight characters within the comics, but you had to find something to enable you to even stand a chance, and even then, you had to be good and lucky. And if you did it right, you got recognition for it, and that must've felt amazing. That's one of the things that Neopets did right that I haven't seen any other MMO-of-sorts ever do. They were able to make you need to think hard in order to succeed.  I'd really like to see a less-sheltered game be like Neopets and take off. I think it would be loads of fun if the developers spent enough time and effort into perfecting it, and I think people would be really open to it."

For the most part it's just that dailies/trading/customization/etc. become too much of a routine, and like any routine it gets boring unless there's something to shake it up (on the other hand, it can also be really comforting).   My favourite memory of Neo is the Altador Plot when it first came out, so many people working together to figure out the clues was really fun. I like most site events though, even stuff like the AC which everyone hates lol."

neopets,3cst4e,everythingshines,3,Fri Jul 10 15:02:03 2015 UTC,I always wait until at least 60 unless I need the np right then.
neopets,3cst4e,UhOhFeministOnReddit,2,Fri Jul 10 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"I say 60, the reason being that it hits 60 often enough, but leaves enough gaps between to build and diversify your portfolio. You want at least one of every stock and then start building them up from there. Holding out until 60 allows you to accomplish this in a relatively quick amount of time since you're selling less."

The reason you need to start now though is because you can only but 1k stocks per day.   And it takes stocks time to finally reach critical mass.  Also there is a secret formula for stock prices, nothing actually affects them from the site.   TL; DR start buying stocks today."

Let's say you have 10 items, you click on the ""Rank Items"" link (either all or in categories) and then put in 1, 2, 3, 4, up to 10 in the boxes below the items.  This will reorganize how your items show up and in what order.    If you add an item later on and you want it to go between 2 and 3, you can put 2.1 in it's box and when you save it the item will be reassigned a whole number but put where you wanted it to go.

This is to better help communicate that i am willing to go lower than TP-Price as i am willing to haggle on nearly every item i have for sale.  That- and because i seldom never expect to pay full price for item, I don't expect any of my fellow Neopian-Redditors to either.  I like to stress that this is not the Neoboards Trade/Auctions board, but a much more easy-going place where you can find the best deals possible.    While this is a selling (and other things) thread, i want to extend my fellow redditors the best deals possible, any redditor-Neopian will be discounted further after lowest TP price is established.    Ex:  I have a Cool Negg listed for 700k because the most recent insistence i searched TP for Cool Neggs listed them no lower than 700k.  The next day when i ""re-post,"" or copy and paste, my for-sale listing, my price could be higher than what another user is asking.  Let's say they're asking 650k.  If that's the case, or just in general my asking price is higher than lowest TP, shoot me a message letting me know.  I will adjust my asking price to 650k (lowest TP). With the newly established TP price, i will discount the opening-price for redditors to ensure no one ever pays even the lowest TP price being asked at the time.  Using the Cool Negg example, I then price quote you at 625k.  It is at this point we sit down at the table to haggle.  After:     Lowest TP has been established   Redditor discount has been applied to TP-Price   Final price quote has been given     The buyer may choose to counter-offer the Final-Price quote.  Best way to put it simply is i'm asking lowest TP, regardless of someone listing a price lower than my reddit post + i'm willing to go beyond that by giving redditors extra slack than i would give anyone i randomly meet on Neo.  A redditor may make an offer any time they like. Hell, your first inquiry to me about an item may certainly be/include your offer if you so choose.    I feel doing it the way i described gives users the best value and in-turn creates more incentive to inquire about an item or items.    Side Note:    I would love to do group sales for those buying more than 1 item at a time.  Doing so will get your price discounted to a greater extent.  Yes you'll be paying more NP overall, but you will also be purchasing each item involved in the transaction at a cheaper price than you would have paid for them separately. My listed-items can be group sold in any combination with each other.  Feel free to let me know/run something by me if ever the occasion were to arise that i possess 2+ items you're seeking to purchase        You can find what i currently have in TP here    Sometimes i'll nuke my trades because i run out of inventory space.  So there may be few to none of the previously mentioned items in my lots. If and when this is the case, you can always find the items I am currently selling in my gallery.    Specifically, you may find these ""for-sale-items"" in the For Sale section of my gallery.  From there, feel free to message me or drop me a mail.    Feel free to do the last part in any case, so long as you follow Rule #1  ;)  Thanks for reading all, hope to do business with the lot of ya.

neopets,3cqc43,Aksar0,6,Thu Jul 9 22:43:09 2015 UTC,"This is great, and very helpful as it seems canceling through neopets alone just won't cut it anymore. No risk of being billed again, no risk of being frozen, no being scammed by jumpstart. Hopefully everyone sees this"
neopets,3cqc43,leilalover,3,Fri Jul 10 02:12:31 2015 UTC,Isn't the issue for this that some people have been frozen after doing this for still being able to use Premium without paying? :(
neopets,3cqc43,E6E6FA,15,Thu Jul 9 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"No. What people are doing is reverse charging (also known as a 'chargeback'), which is basically getting a refund AFTER they have received a day or more of premium (or simply after they have been charged). That is freezable. So, if you actually have a payment reversed, it's freezable.  If you cancel your buyer agreement BEFORE you are ever charged again, Neo will not be able to charge Paypal. Therefore, it's just like your bank card being denied. They will immediately stop your premium. You will not 'still use premium' if you cancel through this method.   I have canceled my premium off and on for 5+ years through paypal."
neopets,3cqc43,lafl,7,Thu Jul 9 23:14:05 2015 UTC,"Clearly explained, the people worried about getting frozen need to understand this post."
neopets,3cqc43,Im5andwhatisthis,3,Thu Jul 9 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"I can also confirm this is the only way I have ever canceled my premium, with no issues."
neopets,3cqc43,E6E6FA,7,Fri Jul 10 01:24:53 2015 UTC,"Those people are not doing this. They are making a claim through Paypal for their money back. This prevents the money from ever being taken in the first place. Thus no one is being given premium for ""free"", so no bans."
neopets,3cqc43,lafl,3,Thu Jul 9 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you for clearing it up!"
neopets,3cqc43,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,4,Thu Jul 9 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you read what you replied to correctly or maybe I wasn't clear. If someone is going to file a dispute against Paypal to get their money back from Neopets.com that is going to cause worse issues with Neopets.com in getting their account back, then if the payment simply didn't go through. Most merchants who have a Paypal claim filed against them simply are not willing to do business with that person again."
neopets,3cqc43,ohreallynowz,3,Thu Jul 9 22:49:47 2015 UTC,You are clear and 100% correct.
neopets,3cqc43,procyon1,3,Thu Jul 9 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"From what I understand this is what is happening.   You are billed for $X for whatever plan (monthly, quarterly, yearly). You then get premium for that time period. You can either cancel it or continue to be rebilled as such. Say you cancel your premium but still have 10 days left. You should not be rebilled after cancelling but should still get the 10 days you paid for.   What it seems is happening is that people are cancelling and that is not ""sticking"" with Neopets. They are then being rebilled as the system does not realize they cancelled.    When the user then goes to PayPal/bank/credit card company to dispute the charges, the Neopets system shows that they still have Premium and I believe it looks like this person is trying to get premium while cancelling the payment so TNT freezes the person because it looks like they are trying to get a service they aren't actually paying for when that is not the case at all.   I've also seen that some people are being charged like $25.00 to get their account back which may be from a fee that banks charge when a transaction is cancelled. I'm not 100% sure about that but I assume it's very similar to like a ""bounced check fee"".   I hope that kind of helps. That's just my take on it and what I'm understanding from posts here and on Neopets."
neopets,3cqc43,everythingshines,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"Even if you cancel premium, if you still have days left until your next payment, then you will still have the perks until that payment time is up.  Example: Your billing cycle is June 10th through July 10th. You have already paid for this. If you cancel your premium in the middle of this cycle (say June 29th) then you will keep the service until it reaches the date your billing cycle will end (July 10th). At which point, your service cancels."
neopets,3cqc43,spankety,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Thank you.  So, I subscribed to a monthly plan through paypal and canceled it (I have a screenshot that told me I did) on Neopets towards the end of last month. 7 days after my account was supposed to be charged...I'm still able to use premium benefits? I went ahead and canceled the payment on paypal for this new month as I haven't been charged yet. I hope I won't get frozen..."

He was a brilliant man but highly unconventional, and had actually been fired from a much more prestigious college for rich kids before coming to my school. He was a total boon to our school. I never truly understood how to study biology until he came along. It was all about bacteria and chromosomes and little else. I was an English major so the class was absolute bullshit, but it was nice to actually learn something useful, instead of regurgitating the function of a cell all semester. It was one of the few cases where I felt like I actually got something out of the classes unnecessary to my major."

About me- my username is mmsy99. I do have some dream pets and ultimate goals - I'm hoping to have a baby lupe (and for lols I want him to be my BD pet because that would be so cute if he's this little baby but really is super badass) and royal girl krawk. However my first goal is saving 70 million neopoints, which I started about one/two months ago. I have 2 million so far. The aim is to buy my own MSPP TCG to get the avvie, use that for collat for SUAP then lend it out for a while along with some other avvie items to help fellow Neopians. I just remember how grateful I was to be lent things and I want to do that for other people. After that I plan on splashing the NP on getting all the expensive avatars (eg HT Riches or High Roller) and my favourite pets. I know right, big game plan. What can I say, I'm ambitious and set on fulfilling the dreams of the 13 year old I used to be :p You have said that you'd rather give items than pure but if you do choose me as one of your lucky giftees, I don't mind anything you can help me with!

Are you sure you want to give away all your stuff and your pets? Thank you for sharing with us!!  Here is my Wishlist. My UN is squirtyroo  If you still have NC and would like to gift, I would love the Enchanting Boat Ride Background. It makes me think of Venice.   Thank you again; this is very nice of you"
neopets,3cq06f,akumite,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that you have been put into such a situation. Is there a chance that they will not freeze you as other people have been having similar problems or has everyone in a similar situation been frozen? Also, if you weren't frozen would you regret having given your things away or is the prospect of potentially being unjustly frozen turning you away from the site? (I struggle with this idea as well. I want to keep playing this game, and I've never been warned or frozen or done anything to warrant being frozen before in my 10 years of on and off play(My main is just a baby, b/c I wanted to start fresh. My original account, eitakhguoh, is still going strong though), but I worry about how upsetting it would be for me to find out one day that I had been frozen.)   Also, does a state of poverty count as a place where you cannot by nc? I'm kidding; I live in the U.S. If I weren't paying for college right now, I could walk like 10 minutes to a store that, I think, sells the cards.   As far as wishlists go my two big ones are books for my bird (I'm not the only one who needs an education. Avian Ignorance is the worst kind of ignorance.) That list is here: http://www.neopets.com/~shaddock  And items from the Advent Calendar (seriously if you happen to have any of the 5 np cheap stuff I would love you so much. I don't have the SSW & I lack the discipline to refresh the SW 50 billion times). The stuff I have is here: Y02-Y10 and Y11-Y16  Thank you so much for you kindness to everyone in having this giveaway. It is unfortunate that this situation has driven away a kind member of the neopet's community.

It is really crappy that you're more than likely going to get your account frozen because of a fuck up on Neopets side >:( It is really sad how many people have been leaving lately.   my UN: esperanszaxoxo   here are my wishlists  I'm currently saving up for a Maraquan PB because I recently fell in love with the Mara Blumaroo buuut I also really love the Mara Grarrl!

If i were you, i would just post to the facebook page, get their attention, so if you do get frozen you can just say its not your fault!  Its their fault, and you shouldn't be punished for that.  Here's hoping you don't get frozen!  Sock it to the new uncaring TNT!!!  That said, if you still want to leave... I'll take anything off your hands - im just getting into NC trading - so just one GBC would really help me out...  I have the ability to buy NC, but im a part time college student and i worry my parents will be upset if i spend money on virtual reality :((  Currently i'm saving for all this stuff  My first love is Shoyru's and currently i'm hoping for a Shadow PB and to pair her with a plain old Ukali.

neopets,3cq06f,Cybele18,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:43:13 2015 UTC,"i get so mad about JS charging people for Premium. apparently, this problem isn't just Neo-specific though. I went on the JumpStart Facebook page and tons of people are complaining about paying for services and not receiving them or canceling and still getting charged. It's unethical, especially if they freeze people because they see it as ""taking advantage of the system."" I understand that people do take advantage of the system, but at the same time, when your page is flooded with complaints like that, there's a huge problem.  Anyway, I'm sorry that happened to you, hopefully they will understand and keep your account unfrozen because it's giving Neopets a bad reputation. If people keep complaining loud enough, nobody would want to purchase Premium and a big chunk of company profits goes away. It's unfortunate that this isn't JumpStart's first priority.  Enough of my ranting, though :/ Here's my wishlist and my UN is lovability~ thank you again for doing this!"

For the NC Mall, I have a Maraquan Bori I really need a nice background for, and I've been eyeing the Pretty Tropical Lagoon background out of the NC Mall for her.

I played the game on and off when I was younger - I don't think I ever got particularly hooked because all the monkey-making business got boring to me.

neopets,3csrli,yogurtisalive,3,Fri Jul 10 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the type of ticket. NC Mall tickets are typically the fastest, but even those have been recently backlogged. Frozen account and account access issues often take months to even years, but sometimes Tony will unfreeze users after a few weeks. If not, it appears that those account tickets that seem to fall in the void will take months. Even when a ticket is marked at work in progress, it may be ignored for months. I wouldn't be surprised if your cousin has a short wait, but the long wait is more common, I'm afraid. Definitely try asking them on Facebook, as others said."
neopets,3csrli,yogurtisalive,2,Fri Jul 10 14:29:19 2015 UTC,Yeah it's about an old account she used to have that has a few things on there she'd like to get. Starting to lose hope after reading all these replies :( I did message them on FB and everything like that so lets hope for some miracle.

That nets you 7-20k right away with a chance every day to get 2-10k more or other good items.    I daily play levels 1 and 2 in Ghoul Catchers (in this order about 10 times: 1,2,1,2,1,2...) - you get 1k per 3-star and are capped at 50k a day, visit Anchor Management, Forgotten Shore, The Grundo Plushie, Coltzan's Shrine, Buy a Fairgrounds scratch-card and play it if the Wiz prices it to <1200 or put it in my shop.    Finally, I play Wheel of excitement and buried treasure if I got decent winnings from other stuff. Then I stash the NP in the bank. In about 3 days I have gotten to 160k. If I really pushed my limits, added some games in, and such - I could have been to about 400k. Just depends on how much time you can spend!"

I also kept the stuff on the side to show where I got the inspiration/colours/etc from :) I also tried to use the blues/aquas from those because you use that a lot in your pets/profile and stuff  (another thing that would be cool, based on what you posted, but i am incapable of drawing would be those oval tattoos that are framed or surrounded by a ribbon, with a Kadoatie or Schnelly inside!)"

(Probably different ones). If it's just items that you want to have on your body let me know! But I'm more into drawing neopets and I think a cute neopets lurve tattoo would be fun for me to draw -- whether or not it's something you'd get tattooed or not haha.  EDIT: if it's just petpets that you are into, same question goes between your bf and you for ""what petpets do you love the mostest""  Cause there's no point in doing the second best petpet haha."
neopets,3cpg0y,Aksar0,3,Thu Jul 9 23:14:49 2015 UTC,We both actually approved of everything on the list and spent time making it together so all of those are special to us. If I had to pick an item it would actually be the Magical Red Krawk Plushie.

neopets,3cqcea,snowwhite52,21,Thu Jul 9 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, I'm just going to throw my 2 cents in here as I'm an old lady and have some experience with business.     Jumpstart doesn't want to hear about how the old team did it better. The reason they were all laid off is probably pretty simple - a huge reduction in revenue in the last ten+ years has left neopets vulnerable to a buyout and layoff. That's what happens to businesses that are not creating profit. Though we as users don't like change - we've obviously stuck around because we love it - thousands upon thousands of people have left and aren't coming back. Jumpstart bought this bloated, jumbled mess because they think they can DO something with it - something PROFITABLE. Something that will bring in NEW users that will increase ad revenue and spend real money. And considering that we're talking about a children's educational company, I'm assuming it will be centered around that. If this was my company, I would have hired 10 app designers and set them out to create the most fun and addicting neopets app the world has ever seen...that can't be fully enjoyed without $9.99 in-app purchases. As far as I can tell, customer support has been outsourced to a company called Parature, which in the last year was purchased by Microsoft. I don't know that Rico and whoever else answers tickets actually work for Neo/JS. JS probably has a contract with them to provide ticket support and they only pay for a few full time people. This is just a guess by me, but I doubt JS is hiring staff for that, it's likely outsourced. Artists and content developers are expensive. See #1. I agree with /u/talvarn that any letter should include real data from the userbase - surveys regarding NC purchasing, length of use, ideas for sourcing new users, least favorite parts of the site, most requested updates, what an awesome app could include. What ideas do we have that could help them build, not regress? They don't owe us anything - the original TNT built it and loved it, but since multiple companies have run it, it's just a business to them now. We need to understand that the likely only reason neopets is still around is because it has the potential to be on the ""assets"" side of the balance sheet, and more changes will have to come for it to stay around. They need more new users than users jumping ship.   So that's what I think your letter should include - not what we think is wrong - they know that already, how much bitching can one company have on it's Facebook page - but how we as users can help them make the site better, more profitable.  That's what I would listen to, if it was me."
neopets,3cqcea,Hencenomore,5,Fri Jul 10 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"This so much. From what you know, could players intern, volunteer, or even have a direct financial stake in a company like JS and it's property Neopets?"
neopets,3cqcea,snowwhite52,3,Fri Jul 10 03:16:33 2015 UTC,"Business is changing - the internet has brought us all a little closer together.  I don't know diddly about JS specifically, and what their previous business practices have been, but I think more businesses are moving toward involving their fan-base, with indiegogo and kickstarter being such successes.  There's time for companies to move that direction - but will JS?  Who knows?  Usually after huge layoffs, companies restructure and then re-hire for the new departments and divisions they've created.  We could be lucky and they could hire some neo fans, but more likely it'll just be some regular Joes that need jobs in coding and web dev?"
neopets,3cqcea,talvarn,3,Fri Jul 10 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, customer support has been outsourced to a company called Parature, which in the last year was purchased by Microsoft.

This is just a guess by me, but I doubt JS is hiring staff for that, it's likely outsourced.   To clarify, Parature is simply cloud based ticketing and support software, they don't provide the staff - it's just a case of not having to spend the resources hosting and maintaining the software on site.   The support staff will all work for JS, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are pooling resources from their other properties and they have little neo-specific knowledge.   Previously before the JS transition they were using Kayako, a different ticketing system. Having run Kayako myself I'm surprised they managed to process any tickets at all, especially if they self-hosted it :| JS were probably using Parature for all their properties and it was easier to bring everything under the same umbrella."
neopets,3cqcea,Bebeness,18,Fri Jul 10 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yo. I've lurked around here for a long time and have only recently started posting - so hi. I like the idea of sending a letter (and appreciate that you've bothered to put one together) but I believe we're a couple of steps ahead of ourselves on this one.   I play a few games which have large reddit communities (HS & DOTA2, mostly) and I think we can learn a few things from them on how to interact with content providers.   If you pop on over to r/hearthstone and search for 'survey', you'll see hundreds of redditor made surveys which get thousands of replies. These surveys are about everything: most hated game concept, user age, how much cash you've spent, how you divide playing time - fucking everything. Then these industrious little redditors make pie charts, info-graphics and even youtube videos to represent the feedback they receive.  The most important thing about this, in my opinion, is that the content creators actually have some figures to look at, taken from a wide sample range.  There's no reason that the same cannot happen on this subreddit. /u/diceroll123 seems pretty tech savvy - and I'm sure most of you can put together a google doc.   I think this would also help on focusing any potential letter that we, as a community, might send - and give us supporting material along with it.  Ninja edit!! - If anyone has any connection to sites like JellyNeo which would be able to hit a wider demographic (e.g. the kids) that would also support our critique."
neopets,3cqcea,matchu,7,Fri Jul 10 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"GOOD IDEAS.  If you're going to send a letter, I think you should do this. I still have reservations of the effectiveness of this (as I don't know if JumpStart is the kind of company to take feedback and make decisions based on that feedback, or whether it's the kind of company to make decisions for themselves and implement said changes -- my feelings are more towards the latter), but I digress...  /r/neopets isn't the majority of Neopets, so I don't know if the feelings of people here will sway JS's mission plan. Instead of being like ""there are literally DOZENS of us who want these things"", do what /u/talvarn is talking about. Sounds smrt.  Also: there's just something unprofessionally subjective with ""we want better art"" or ""better support"" as requests. If I were a professional and read those, like... there's nothing to do with it. It's not defined well. Too vague. Get specific. That's my advice for revising this letter, though my overall feeling is you shouldn't send it, but like I said it's your choice. I think that if JS could provide better art or better support, they would, which goes back to why I think they're just not equipped right now to meet these requests."
neopets,3cqcea,6thninja,3,Fri Jul 10 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say that I feel like JN is in the best position to run this survey, but then I feel kinda wonky, because JS is in the best position to run this survey, and it feels weird to do their job for them. (TNT kinda ran something like this recently-ish, right? But it was short and mostly free-form; I wonder how they analyzed it.)  Then again, that's kinda the fansite business: building the tools that TNT haven't built yet, because it seems fun and rewarding. So, I think it'd be cool if JN did some survey; mad props to them if they go for it :) The real hard part will be figuring out how to format the survey: if it's too free-form, it'll be hard to extract meaningful information, but, if it's not free-form enough, it'll be easy to miss some really big stuff."
neopets,3cqcea,Vengerai,3,Fri Jul 10 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Neopies were a good way to gauge reactions to site content, I'd like to see those brought back."
neopets,3cqcea,Bebeness,9,Fri Jul 10 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think we could be more tactful and appreciative of JS' current efforts. A bit more... diplomatic, shall we say? It's perhaps not living up to the potential of the site, but it's a really big site. Changes may be slow, and new ideas take time to implement. Heck, even coordinating the ideas would take a long time. I think you should try communicating that we are still users of the site for a reason, after all. I wrote something, see if you understand the tone I'm trying to get at?     I believe I speak for many users when I say that we would appreciate greater transparency and better communication with the Neopets team. Many of us have been users of the site for a long time, and we are among the last who want to see it fail. Rejuvenating the site, and maintaining a well-staffed team of talented, dedicated contributors, who are as passionate about the site as the users are themselves, will be a powerful start to keeping the site relevant and fun in the changing digital landscape."
neopets,3cqcea,seriative,21,Fri Jul 10 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"PERSONALLY... I don't like the way this comes across at all. But it's not my letter, and you can write/send whatever you want to. To me, it comes across as whiny and over-demanding. Though, I absolutely hate all the Jumpstart hate that I see on this sub, so I may be biased (lol). I just think they should be left alone to figure out what they want to do with the site/where it will go once all the dust settles, instead of making demands of them right off the bat. And I know it's been some time since they got Neopets, but the bitching started immediately and never stopped, so I don't think they've ever had a fair chance. Neopets is big, and like /u/Vengerai said, what I see from JS is an understaffed company with no ability to hire on more qualified help rather than a company trying to screw over the Neopets community.  My general thought:  Give them a break, people.  You were probably not going to use the Rainbow Baby Blu anyway.  If I were JS I'd shut down Neopets just to spite the whiny/entitled part of the Neopets community. A lot of you guys I love and think are awesome, but a lot of you act like spoiled children not getting their way and it's a huge turn off.  I don't care if I get downvoted for that comment, haha. It's completely true."
neopets,3cqcea,Bebeness,3,Thu Jul 9 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"100% this!!!!!!!!  and having run an online tcg website for a period of time, just having to 1. learn new programming languages, 2. edit existing code that was fucking awful, 3. piece together my site from bits and pieces and 4. create new code from complete scratch because it no longer existed anywhere in tutorials/etc was exhausting. i gave it up completely once i got a part time job because of how time-consuming, frustrating and generally draining it all was. whatever JS is dealing with in terms of the neopets code is a thousand times worse than that and i feel like the majority of the users don't seem to comprehend what happens when dozens of programmers have their code smashed together in one big pile. coding is a language and each programmer uses it differently and ultimately it's like trying to expect sixty different authors to write sixty different chapters of a book without ever working together at the same time then bring in an editor who hasn't met a single one of those authors to try and make that book a cohesive, successful novel.  i feel like unless it involves user money disappearing or being misused, there's seriously nothing to bitch about. for a site we're all so attached to, people are really pushing it - it's exactly like you said tbh, i'd shut down neopets in a heartbeat if this was the kind of feedback i was getting since taking over the sinking ship."
neopets,3cqcea,seriative,4,Fri Jul 10 03:46:47 2015 UTC,"Admittedly: I'm not giving JS a pass for the premium renewal issues. There's absolutely no excuse for why that's happening, and I hope JS will give refunds and not keep the cash that people didn't want to give to them... but when people bitch about a drawing or AC rewards or mistakes in the news, it's... it doesn't matter enough to get so bent out of shape about. I was probably harsher than I normally would be just because I'm so tired of the complaints.   I also felt like I was on the unpopular side of this, since I see more anti-JS posts than pro-JS posts. I'm not necessarily pro, I'm just willing to be patient and wait for them to figure stuff out haha. But I'm surprised I was upvoted. It was a rant and I legitimately thought I'd get negative karma for it. I just couldn't hold it in anymore.  It's a nice surprise. I'm glad you have some experience to empathize with what they're going through. Not to mention that they're involved with more things than just Neopets: I just imagine they're stretched thin so I don't blame them for things not running 100% smoothly."
neopets,3cqcea,guiltea,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:30 2015 UTC,"harsh or not, someone definitely needed to say it - and i'm glad you did! :) yeah, the financial issues are the one thing that i think people should be focused on when it comes to doling out criticisms. i mean i've seen more complaints about the art quality than people LOSING MONEY and frankly it's kind of bizarre. i mean the intent behind OP's post is great but... the general user sentiment is about how the site is crappy, not how having your users' money disappear and wrongly charging them for services is crappy. which is worrying.  yeah, i find myself honestly not caring about the coding issues they have, so long as they're working on it - and they are, because they've already proven they can fix things, even if it takes time! it's also why i'm fine with keyquest being down - i mean sure, it was a fun aspect of the game, but fixing something that big with that much missing code is going to take a lot of time! which reminds me the people who say they've had enough time are really out of touch with what goes on behind the scenes of maintaining a website, particularly one like this."
neopets,3cqcea,6thninja,3,Fri Jul 10 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"I feel the same.  They've taken on a massive project. Neopets, as a site, has been dying a long and slow death for years. Buying it at this point is pretty freaking brave and anything Jumpstart is doing will be an uphill struggle, especially as a company with (what appears to be) minimum staff and resources.  It feels like every little thing that doesn't meet people's expectations is blown up way out of proportion. People need to chill out."
neopets,3cqcea,Bebeness,3,Fri Jul 10 12:20:26 2015 UTC,"Give them a break, people. You were probably not going to use the Rainbow Baby Blu anyway.   YASSSS! THANK YOU!"

Complaining for complaining's sake.  Yeah, it's bad. They've done things that aren't so bad too.  I like to imagine it was some intern and it was thrown upon him at the last minute, and he isn't artistic, and he did the best he could whilst stressing out over it lolol. It's endearing if you look at it like that.  (I know that's probably not what happened: I have no idea what they were thinking, lol, but it's a 80x80 pixel picture, it's not the end of the world.)"

neopets,3cqcea,Vengerai,5,Fri Jul 10 13:20:28 2015 UTC,I think with the customer support area and the representative to hear suggestions and stuff is going to be pretty difficult since they laid off a bunch of people. :/ I don't think they can really do anything about hiring more staff when they just laid a ton of people off. Key Quest has some coding issues or coding was lost in the transition so I'm not sure that'll work too well.   I'm not too keen on a letter because I'm not sure what it will really do but good luck none-the-less! :)
neopets,3cqcea,Bebeness,8,Thu Jul 9 23:01:32 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. I think a lot of the problems presented in this letter have to do with a lack of staff and content contributors, and I don't think it's something they are looking to correct in a hurry. These are some pretty heavy demands for what I presume is an understaffed team. Lack of content and poor customer service is most likely a lack of manpower. Maybe the issue is really a lack of contributors and hands on the deck, rather than these somewhat specific issues? Fixing coding and writing huge new plots are looking to be beyond their capabilities right now..."

neopets,3cqcea,6thninja,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:18:57 2015 UTC,"Fixed~  I felt like the old team was a bit more involved or passionate than the new team is.  Viacom owned neopets certainly had its share of problems though, I recognize."

neopets,3cqcea,msjenii,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:27:21 2015 UTC,Right now I would just be happy if they were to give us a time line of updates and changes so that we know stuff is actually getting done. I have been playing for 14 years now and I hate to give us on the game or see it just go away.
neopets,3cqcea,Nesperado,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:43:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would focus more on the benefits for JumpStart if they address some of our concerns and make improvements.    JumpStart likely knows Neo needs updated coding, better customer service and more content, but given the layoffs, they are probably struggling financially as a whole. There's just no way they can be investing their all in Neo in their current state. But the people who are working on Neo, whoever they are, need a nudge in the right direction what they can do to improve.   I also feel the letter can be more specific. I wouldn't say directly the art hasn't been quality, as JS may believe it is, but what we expect to see with item releases and art content and why good items matter. For example, why random food items and useless gift items aren't as exciting as plushies, stamps, BD equipment, and quirky/fun items. Suggest little ways they can make the site improve, then move on to the big picture: what we want to see Neo become, or remain and why it is good for JS' brand.   Also, on art quality, it is important to stress NC. If art quality is lacking, that's less purchases and ultimately less revenue for JS. ex: The love for NC items are highly dependent on  art quality. The NC mall boards are one of the most active Neoboards, with a dedicated community. Customisation applications on popular fansites such as Dress to Impress, SunnyNeo, and Jellyneo are beloved by the community and are frequently used. NC is a huge part of that. We want the site to succeed to the best of it's abilities, and a lot of it has to do with NC.   Make good use of the ""bad news sandwich."" ex: We liked that you guys continue to support the Altador Cup. And it was awesome you gave us an extension and got the prize shop out promptly. The prize shop is perhaps the most memorable part of the AC. However, many users really loved the tradition of having a Yooyu every year, too, and all new items...Many users would be invested in the AC even more if they knew the prizes were more focused on collectables we've come to know and love, along with some of your staff's personality, like with your staff tournament prizes.   For contests, I would address why they matter so much to the user. ex: Many of us have been working on x for a long time and would love to show others what we're capable of. Community-driven competitions have always been a major part of this site and teaches children and adults to exercise their creative skills. Ask those who played Neopets a decade ago and you will find those will say how Neopets taught them HTML/CSS and inspired them to become programmers and artists. These contests keep us interested even during times where there is not a flood of new content. We would love to see these contests return in their full glory, but we understand that returning them all at once would be difficult. We would love for you guys to address when we might expect new things to come...  ex: Neopets is a huge part of where we are today, who we've become, and where we're going. We would love JumpStart to support the site at a deeper level to share our Neopets experience with others. In turn, Neopets will continue to be the iconic brand beloved by millions across generations."
neopets,3cqcea,Nesperado,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:54:42 2015 UTC,Time for me to complain about all the people complaining about people complaining about JS.   People have the right to complain and I'm sorry if that upsets you but we all have to deal with somebody  Could they not even make like a patch log or even a sentence saying they fixed some bugs this week just so it seems like things are happening. They have 4 different games to manage I understand. I also understand that they are all pretty shitty games and the jump staff DEFINITELY don't give a crap about a couple of kid games they are being payed to work on for the sole purpose of more money.   But I 'm sure we all have something to pass the time while they get their shit together

I did buy slightly more than needed (repair parts!) and I individually sewed them onto the vest. All in all, it was about 30 hours of work. I thought, $750 minus the $150 in materials and the hourly breakdown is $20 an hour. That said, I priced it so that it would never sell. I wore this for Halloween and plan on wearing it to Burning Man. I made it more to show what kind of things I make and the kind of time I'm willing to put into a project so others can commission me.

Because I want boxes to be able to gift my friends, and some random Neopians I see on boards.   If I had already explained clearly and people still lowball me on my 5 cap item for 1 cap - I am obviously not going to accept that offer. I can discount a little... 3 caps would be okay, not 1.

neopets,3cofnp,Draggonair,5,Thu Jul 9 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be great if there was an optional autosell feature to it?  If the trade met your suggested price in Neopoints, it'll just sell it to the player.  Would help clean up the TP and make things smoother imo.   With everyone coming in from all over the world's timezones, sometimes it is really hard to use the TP.  All other trades (like item for item trades/mix trades), would have to be manually accepted by the seller."
neopets,3cofnp,Nimara,2,Thu Jul 9 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"Yes of course it would be cool, but if TNT decided to set a max price in shops, it is for a reason..."
neopets,3cofnp,Nimara,2,Thu Jul 9 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yup.  But it would still fall under the max of the TP, which technically already works like a second shop when people only take NPs for their stuff.    I see it as a change for the lower activity levels on Neopets.  It definitely is not as active from when I was a kid (like 10-15+ years ago).  This worked better when there was tons of people on and trading.  Its function has become less efficient as the number of players continues to drop."

neopets,3cpluo,theonlygurl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:59:27 2015 UTC,That's really strange... Is it because FFQ have neopoints tangentially involved in them whereas the magma pool is always free? Or is there some other reason?
neopets,3cpluo,Hencenomore,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:45:22 2015 UTC,"You can't do the process to get the permanent access to the Magma Pool on sides because doing so creates NP.

You get a little wave of anticipation before you click the button, but will be frequently disappointed by gender and stat changes. Since you've created a new account and are inquiring about how to get the pieces at reasonable prices, I assume that you have not got much NP. So, I'll recommend that you save until after you can afford the lab map. Make sure it doesn't bankrupt you. NP makes more NP, that's how it rolls. You don't want to be starting from scratch and having just a lab map to show for it."

neopets,3cpglg,Vengerai,5,Thu Jul 9 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"It's easier to spot cheaters now that the stores have updated. In fact it's becoming insanely obvious to them now. Stepping into a store whose stock you're not familiar with, snagging all the best items, and completely ignoring unprofitable items is a sure sign you're using a bot."
neopets,3cpglg,UhOhFeministOnReddit,3,Thu Jul 9 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's true. I heard even people using autobuyers bought out unprofitable items in the past to make room for new items."
neopets,3cpglg,Vengerai,3,Thu Jul 9 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's basically what everyone had to do RSing back in the day, legit or not."
neopets,3cpglg,UhOhFeministOnReddit,2,Thu Jul 9 22:08:33 2015 UTC,I don't restock so I don't know the changes. What is different to make it easier to spot cheaters?
neopets,3cpglg,TubOfSoda,2,Thu Jul 9 21:06:44 2015 UTC,"Well, before the shops updated it was basically one page of purely junk items. If you cleared a few spaces by buying non-profitable stock, anything that replaced it made you a ton of NP 95% of the time. Period. It was hard to tell the difference between someone with a bot and a human playing, because both were performing equally well. They were all making a ton of NP every time they restocked because of the rare item shortage.  See the inflation was so high because only a handful of people were ballsy enough to clear spaces to restock and they had to worry about amateurs and opportunistic players coming in and snagging the items after they spent 20-50,000 clearing spaces. (Yeah, it cost THAT much. Ridiculous.) It wasn't fair to players that didn't have that kind of NP, and it wasn't fair to the restockers clearing spaces. It also made it impossible to determine if someone was cheating because they were having to buy a pretty high amount of junk items, making their transactions look the same as a legit players.  Now, it's easy. Someone going in and picking up every amazing item in a store with no mistakes is cheating. There's a whole lot of players in this sub who know what they're doing and they make mistakes.   That little rant done, I will say that I only vaguely know of some of the methods they use to catch cheaters and a lot of it is common sense. So, I may not be spot on, but if I was looking for bots that would be some of the clues I'd look for. Since Adam implemented the system (and he's a smart dude) there's probably a lot more to it that my ass knows nothing of."
neopets,3cpglg,UhOhFeministOnReddit,3,Thu Jul 9 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"I don't really restock any more, but just to put in an opposing view - going back 5-10 years to more active days, we legit restockers didn't have any problems picking out the profitable items in shops that had their whole inventory restocking. There are a lot of legit players who will know a shop's stock well enough to not make mistakes. Magic and Stamp are probably the two main places to restock and I think it is definitely possible to spend a lot of time in those shops and make no errors."
neopets,3cpglg,Sage_LFC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, back in the day even common items like say Stick-O-Mynci made a profit because of the sheer volume and demand. Fast forward and most common items were making NP because of the rare item shortage, not disagreeing at all there. But the really good restockers hang out in the shops with the most massive item pools for the higher prevalence of R99's and other high value items, especially now. Me for example, I'm a freakin' genie in Furniture, Garden, and Spooky Foods specifically and even I still fuck up and buy worthless items because I have multiple shops open and there's no way a single one person can learn the 15+ pages of stock in the older stores without eons of practice.  Now that the shops have updated I am struggling to relearn all the profit accumulating items. I buy worthless shit all the time on accident. Someone going into a store, no matter how long they've been playing, and getting all the best items with zero mistakes has to pretty clearly be someone using a bot."
neopets,3cpglg,UhOhFeministOnReddit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"I dunno... I been pretty good about not making mistakes, though it caused me to miss some good items too when restocking. I rather be safe than sorry and do a quick search on jellyneo's item database if I'm unsure about an item. If I miss it? Oh well, now I know!  Also, using that restock guide helps a little. Though I did find out its suggested profitable items are not 100% accurate. Got a gun at space weaponry that IS rare and valuable, but is a sucky weapon, and EVERYONE is trying to sell. Abandoned Space Weaponry after learning that."
neopets,3cpglg,Totaru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"Well my first day in the Tropical shop I snagged a Blue Doughnutfruit sold for 800k and then the other highest I've gotten was a Qanfire Fruit which is sitting in my shop at around 70k and I got that a few days later. I bought most of the items over 10k there after I checked quickly on the SW and bought them for a few thousand profit on average, and some I didn't check the price and lost a few thousand but they were all higher priced items. I rarely bought smaller items such as the common doughnutfruits like pineapple or limestone. Could almost exclusively buying higher end items lead to my account being more suspicious? Especially being that this was my first week in that particular shop?  Edit: also within the past few weeks a came back from a several year haitus and then started restocking after a few days so I guess that could be seen as suspicious as well."
neopets,3cpglg,poundsurfer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:51:47 2015 UTC,Or doing your research on jellyneo...
neopets,3cpglg,UhOhFeministOnReddit,3,Thu Jul 9 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"I do my research on JN and have been RSing for years and still make mistakes, especially since the shops updated. Used to be it was harder to spot cheaters in the store since almost everything you RS'd made money if you were willing to clear some spaces. I'm assuming bots cleared spaces too, since it was a necessity to RS anything of profit, but I've never used them. Either way it made it exceedingly difficult to tell the difference in performance between a bot and a human.  Now items that were once massively profitable are worth nothing, and if your average RS'er isn't picking up those items, going to every single item of value, and refreshing at unbelievable speeds, it's easy to tell since they're not making mistakes. The bots are too precise and too effective post-update and they're getting people caught."

neopets,3cpglg,msjenii,5,Thu Jul 9 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"My previous account was frozen due to 'refreshing too much', or too fast. Tony P., the one who handled my ticket, claims that I've used a bot. I don't restock, and I don't know the first thing about using a bot. I explained that the only time I would have ever been refreshing was for the stupid Drackonack avatar, and even then I've spaced them out around 5 seconds each.  I've asked him to provide me with evidence that proves any usage of a bot, and he hasn't responded.  That was about a little over a month ago.

neopets,3cpglg,msjenii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"That unfortunately sounds like what they will accuse me of, but like you I would not even know how to get a bot to refresh for me. I was so happy about trying to restock here because the first day I tried here (I typically frequent the food shop and battle magic but i wanted to try a new place) I was able to get a Blue Doughnutfruit and sell it for 800k! I was so excited and liked to restock there as the items were all colorful and unique as well. My first restock ban was from refreshing too much at the food shop, second was from buying too many good items, mainly lower value neggs. I then decided to buy less and refresh less but I guess that still hasn't helped in this situation. I hope that they will actually reply to you and unfreeze your account as well."

This is to better help communicate that i am willing to go lower than TP-Price as i am willing to haggle on nearly every item i have for sale.  That- and because i seldom never expect to pay full price for item, I don't expect any of my fellow Neopian-Redditors to either.  I like to stress that this is not the Neoboards Trade/Auctions board, but a much more easy-going place where you can find the best deals possible.    While this is a selling (and other things) thread, i want to extend my fellow redditors the best deals possible, any redditor-Neopian will be discounted further after lowest TP price is established.    Ex:  I have a Cool Negg listed for 700k because the most recent insistence i searched TP for Cool Neggs listed them no lower than 700k.  The next day when i ""re-post,"" or copy and paste, my for-sale listing, my price could be higher than what another user is asking.  Let's say they're asking 650k.  If that's the case, or just in general my asking price is higher than lowest TP, shoot me a message letting me know.  I will adjust my asking price to 650k (lowest TP). With the newly established TP price, i will discount the opening-price for redditors to ensure no one ever pays even the lowest TP price being asked at the time.  Using the Cool Negg example, I then price quote you at 625k.  It is at this point we sit down at the table to haggle.  After:     Lowest TP has been established   Redditor discount has been applied to TP-Price   Final price quote has been given     The buyer may choose to counter-offer the Final-Price quote.  Best way to put it simply is i'm asking lowest TP, regardless of someone listing a price lower than my reddit post + i'm willing to go beyond that by giving redditors extra slack than i would give anyone i randomly meet on Neo.  A redditor may make an offer any time they like. Hell, your first inquiry to me about an item may certainly be/include your offer if you so choose.    I feel doing it the way i described gives users the best value and in-turn creates more incentive to inquire about an item or items.    Side Note:    I would love to do group sales for those buying more than 1 item at a time.  Doing so will get your price discounted to a greater extent.  Yes you'll be paying more NP overall, but you will also be purchasing each item involved in the transaction at a cheaper price than you would have paid for them separately. My listed-items can be group sold in any combination with each other.  Feel free to let me know/run something by me if ever the occasion were to arise that i possess 2+ items you're seeking to purchase        You can find what i currently have in TP here    Sometimes i'll nuke my trades because i run out of inventory space.  So there may be few to none of the previously mentioned items in my lots. If and when this is the case, you can always find the items I am currently selling in my gallery.    Specifically, you may find these ""for-sale-items"" in the For Salesection of my gallery.  From there, feel free to message me or drop me a mail.    Feel free to do the last part in any case, so long as you follow Rule #1  ;)  Thanks for reading all, hope to do business with the lot of ya.    UN: sethelton    Edit: Format"

It's prom season and a teenage boy hasn't found a date yet. To his luck, his crush doesn't have one either. After class one day he went up to her and asked if shed go, to his surprise she said, ""yes!"". He is super ecstatic, except there is one issue. Whenever he she's a picture if her he gets a boner. Evryday the week before prom he looks at. A picture of her and with no luck he still gets a boner. The night before prom he gets an idea, hell tape it to his leg. Prom night comes around and he leaves to get his suit, grab the flowers, and get a limo. He pulls up to the girls door looking slick and knocks on the door. It opens to reveal the most beautiful girl the boy had ever seen, while she was welcomed by a roundhouse kick to the face.   Thank you so much for doing this!"

neopets,3cnd0o,Neoperts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:57:01 2015 UTC,"Oh thank god I didn't advertise on the boards! That would've been REALLY bad!  I'm pretty sure that people bought my stuff because my dubloons were cheap, although i'll need to run a hypothesis test to check whether announcing that I was hosting a raffle had any significance on my average dubloon sales"
neopets,3cnd0o,seriative,6,Thu Jul 9 08:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly, I think you'll be fine and I'm guessing that most people just liked the cheap dubloons and didn't care too much about the raffle."
neopets,3cnd0o,valarmothballs,2,Thu Jul 9 08:22:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/afterisleep. If I was buying dubloons from your shop because they were cheap and read your description I wouldn't have put much legitimacy in what you were saying. I see people write ridiculous stuff in their shop descriptions (""Lowest on the SSW"" while having 1np junk priced at 200np) and I just ignore it. Maybe I'm just cynical but I bet most people didn't really think that you would give one away anyways or they might not have even looked at your shop description.  I think you'll be okay :)"
neopets,3cnd0o,harley_quinn1995,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:04:52 2015 UTC,"IM SUPER LATE but the majority of them probably didn't even read your shop description - when i'm buying items i need that are lowest on the SSW/SW, i just scroll down immediately to the item and grab it and go. there are also other users like me who have shop descriptions disabled (my computer isn't old, but it sure doesn't like some of the CSS people put in their shops) so they may not even be able to see it in the first place."
neopets,3cnd0o,Hencenomore,4,Thu Jul 9 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Oh I bought a few dubloons from you when you had that up. I didn't buy them because of the raffle though, just because they were the cheapest on SW and you had tons. Haha. I hope you don't get in trouble! Sounds like an honest mistake."
neopets,3cnd0o,Garettesky,3,Thu Jul 9 09:09:40 2015 UTC,People do giveaways which are against the rules so I don't see how this should be a problem if keep it on the down low.
neopets,3cnd0o,-cupcake,3,Thu Jul 9 12:34:16 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, just let it go. If you do anything else, you'll dig yourself into a deeper hole.    Since a raffle is illegal for players, any continuing action concerning the raffle is also illegal.    Therefore,* DON'T NEOMAIL anything about it anywhere* nor DON'T SEND OUT THE NERKMID.     If by any chance a player happens to neomail you asking about it, neomail the player that raffles are against the rules,and then just ask if they thought the item they bought was overpriced and then offer a refund, while clearly stating the price they bought it at with a comparative Shop Wizard price alongside, if its beneficial to you."
neopets,3cnd0o,Garettesky,2,Thu Jul 9 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"Then just don't post a description on your shop and instead send a neomail to your ""winner"" on why you gave him/her a nerk."
neopets,3cnd0o,aveforever,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:54:57 2015 UTC,"You can't really solicit/bribe, either. Although I've had one person in the past send me a little ""gift"" and neomail along the lines of ""Here's a gift for buying from my shop, hope you come again!"" and I don't think they got in trouble for it yet, it doesn't really stop it from being against the rules.    It would only take one report-happy person . . . Or one curious Neopets mod, since they can read your neomails if they want. :/"
neopets,3cnd0o,unfucked,2,Thu Jul 9 06:58:57 2015 UTC,"""Here's a gift for buying from my shop, hope you come again!""   you could do something like this."
neopets,3cnd0o,missynom,2,Thu Jul 9 08:07:02 2015 UTC,I agree that you should just never talk about it again. Don't give anyone an item. Plead ignorance x 1000. Just forget about it.
neopets,3cnd0o,everythingshines,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"I'd perhaps also consider sending consolation prizes to all the people who 'bought tickets' -- little token items roughly in value of the ticket price that they bought, this way it's not such an overt 'scam' and they've recouped somewhat the value, and you're not sitting on a pile of illicit NP.  This way you're showing atonement in case you get a message from TNT, they'll hopefully be more lenient towards you."
neopets,3cnd0o,TheCatcherInTheSty,-5,Thu Jul 9 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"Id send out the prize, then message TnT and say you JUST read the rules after already hosting and completing the raffle and didnt realise it was against the rules. They're pretty lenient."

Unfortunately of course it's real-life money. I don't see why someone should get $6 for nothing. I was a bitch and said I didn't want to have to report them for scamming - this was the only Neomail that elicited a response, previous mails just asking for the boxes back got nothing."

They also keep mentioning how they are communicating with TNT to resolve the issue and can even send me screencaps of the tickets, but considering that she's asking them to actually reverse her damn actions, that's... yeah. TNT washed their hands off the matter the moment they made the GBCs appear in her event inbox. They made it clear that it's up to the user to deal with the GBCs as they see fit. So you know how helpful they'll be. Previously a friend who's really into NC was part of a big board where lots of people were scammed out of caps too. She only lost 1 cap, but TNT also told her she shouldn't have traded with the person (like, boiling it down to poor judgment) and they wouldn't do anything."

That one, I gave up on, because he didn't even know how to accept the gift box, and I felt sorry for him :P I just thought, well, if she's going to be purposely obtuse for 3 GBCs, which really should've been a small matter, I can just be obtuse and innocuous too, and keep hassling her via Neomail."

neopets,3clfq2,roxychalk,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"I still haven't really gone deep into NC trading, but yes, I thought that was the general attitude/just trading etiquette that you should check whether the items are intended for you, or if it's a trade, to open the box only after sending your part of the trade :/ I know I've definitely checked with traders who sent me extra boxes and returned them, but I guess some people are just out to make a cheap virtual buck."
neopets,3clfq2,robuneh,3,Wed Jul 8 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"Neopets should just make a trading post for NC items, is it that bloody complicated?  I'm guessing people buy the GBCs to help facilitate trades and it's probably a good money maker for Neo, since we can only trade with gift boxes. So...I can see if they didn't want to make a straight up trading system, but there has to be something better than what they have now. I'd even pay NC to use a NC trading post...maybe 50 NC (or a gift box) to initiate a trade."

I think they were being both cheap and dishonest--they obviously wanted your caps, but in a way TNT couldn't do anything about it for your end. I really hope they can, at least.  If I get a gift box, I inquire why in case it was sent to the wrong person. The box does disappear when it's opened, so I want to be careful."

neopets,3cn0as,panderama,2,Thu Jul 9 04:15:50 2015 UTC,"First off, /~kiva is a newer list of past UC trades. It doesn't have a BD section, but if you search ""HSD"" it's pretty easy to find some trades.   Judging by /~za tiers and past trades on /~kiva (and what I've seen on the PC), I think I would expect fair offers to start around the tier that the usuki usul is on (so mid-greys and mid-faeries, plus some high darigans.). Faerie xwees are EXTREMELY popular and more and more of them are going to permanent homes. I think you have a reasonable offer, IF you can find one that's UFT and IF you can find someone trading for a BD. I think you'd have no problems (errr, besides the normal problems of trading a UC for C) getting a WN faerie kougra. For a grey kougra, I'd probably expect DN."

neopets,3cjihn,AutoModerator,41,Wed Jul 8 12:00:10 2015 UTC,"Announcement from the mods:    As you're probably all aware, the Food Club Bets thread starts at 5 AM NST.  Due to being inconvenient for some users that have voiced their concerns over time, we're willing to have a trial period with earlier postings. Tomorrow, (July 9th, or Round 5908 if that's how you do FC dates) the FC post will be posted at Midnight NST. And perhaps the next day for more data on effectiveness.  The ""goal"" of the trial is to find out if the thread is going to still be easily visible aka not-buried by the time it's most relevant -- before bets close. We'll be analyzing if thread visibility directly affects the thread activity.  Of course you could always use the Food Club filter in the sidebar to find the FC threads, but not everybody does that...so we'll see!  The way reddit has its most visible and hidden threads is based off of a logarithmic scale of how long ago it was posted, versus how many upvotes it has. For more information, see this link, feel free to read it all, or skip to the ""Effects of submission time"" for a TL;DR of what I'm talking about. Factor in that we get dozens of posts per day which get more votes than the FC thread. :P  Basically, this means if the thread is going to stick around on page 1 all day, most, if not all of the people participating in the thread have to upvote it. I'm not asking or telling anybody to do any voting differently than normal, though.  Thanks for your cooperation and understanding.     -/u/diceroll123"

neopets,3cjihn,breadstickez,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"I think if you really wanted to replace a safety, then by the math you should do it in the arena with the pirate with the best odds (Dan's the best today but I already 10-bet him, so next is Gooblah).    Buck opened at 7:1 odds (he has won 44.6% of the time and has -1 Food Adjustment). Ned opened at 8:1 odds (he has won  23.9% of the time and has +3 Food Adjustment).    They're very close but Buck has a very slim advantage against Ned by the odds.    Tl;dr if you're really gonna drop someone, drop Ned. :P"

I don't greatly trust goob but went for it anyway and hoping if good does fail then my 16:10 will save me from a loss.  Pretty safe bets, nothing too risky, don't trust fairfax enough to go 5 arena. Other than goob, I feel pretty confident that there will be a somewhat upset in the arenas I bet which if good comes though should get high return.  Just for fun my prediction is Dan x Lucky x Fed x Franch x Goob (96:1). Feel free to replace my safety of Dan x Buck if you want a little more risk and a little more fun :P  EDIT: Current hold is just over 1m with 140:50 over the last 5 days.

You're probably safe if it's a PB though because there's a lot of PBs entering/leaving the economy often.  I've heard people have success submitting tickets to find out if an item they have/want is duped or not, though, if you're super paranoid still."

A good way to remember it is that you collect on the same day of the week you started holding (if you start holding on a Wednesday, you collect next Wednesday). Round 5901 was a Thursday, so you can hold up until after tomorrow's round (round 5908) ends (but before midnight. And ideally before 5 PM NST because that's when trophies are awarded)."

I'd played casually a few years back, but that account really didn't have anything on it so I created a new one.  But yes, I did accumulate quite a fair bit in my three months - several really pretty trophies (including #1 on both Illusen's and Jhudora's quests! ayy), and a few million NPs. Relatively speaking it's not a lot, of course, so at least I have that to be grateful for."
neopets,3cmz9e,xoteem,3,Thu Jul 9 04:06:05 2015 UTC,I believe accounts under four months can't see some items that restock that are higher rarity. I may be wrong but I believe that's the case!
neopets,3cmz9e,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,6,Thu Jul 9 04:32:11 2015 UTC,They aren't sold in regular shops. They're only given out by Dr. Sloth in random events and from the Neocola machine. I don't believe they were ever restocked in shops.

neopets,3clstj,goofyspouse,3,Wed Jul 8 22:52:03 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take more than 30 minutes to master it.   30 minutes better spent improving my nose picking skills.    Seriously.  Painful game.  But then again, most Neopets games are painful and can only be called ""games"" if one is willing to endure a lot of pain.  Call them ""acquired taste"" games, if you will.

neopets,3clstj,Turbobutts,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:49:21 2015 UTC,"HA!  Don't give up! Honestly, it just requires PATIENCE. Remember not to race around the track at full speed. Your only goal should be AVOID GETTING HIT. Slow and steady truly does win the race. There is no timer, and the game doesn't end until you run out of lives. Just follow behind a fast AI, pass the slow ones, slow down for intersections, and get the clouds/suns. If things start getting hairy, find a corner to hide in and then resume when the coast is clear.  YOU CAN DOOOOO IT!"
neopets,3clstj,starpiece,2,Wed Jul 8 22:53:51 2015 UTC,I do hide in corners and they go out of their way to hit me! Most I've got is 3 laps doing this so far
neopets,3clstj,Turbobutts,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"oooooh it's probably worth mentioning that not EVERY corner is safe. Lol.  When I want to pull over to take a break, I find the best spots are the at the top of the track directly above the middle of the right circle and the bottom of the track directly below the left circle. There are some other good hiding spots, but those are generally the safest for me. The corners of the intersection are usually good too.  Otherwise, just don't forget to slow down frequently (especially at the intersections) and follow a fast AI rather than pass everyone."

It would perhaps be a decent challenge of skill if each Chariot were assigned to a specific region of the track, like those RC cars or something so you would have to have full control of your chariot and could manouver in and out of paths but these guys just fly around the track aimlessly and just slam into you for no reason other than to be dicks."

Thanks for reading it :-)  Now you have two options:  1) keep going for a Chariot Chase trophy (the game never changes, there is no scaling AI - just stay alive longer and do more laps).

To everyone who is struggling: I spent almost an hour losing one life per lap (sometimes more), and failing miserably, until I understood what I did wrong. When I did, I ended up scoring almost 6k on my 3rd attempt and I'm now up for a bronze trophy... if I'm not kicked out of the HST by then.  So, what was I doing wrong? Playing in low quality. Changed the quality to high and suddendly the enemies are NOT moving at FTL speed, and it's possible to do the things OP suggests, like passing or avoiding them. Also I ended up doing better by following a slow guy and overrunning the fast ones until I got to a safe spot (see the ""safe spot"" in JN's guide) where I could get closer to the wall and let them pass without hitting me, but YMMV."

If they're being wishy-washy I wouldn't buy from them.  You can also ask them to send in a ticket to TNT to verify the legitimacy of the item as a preemtive measure - worth it since they are pricy!  You can also put a board up on the Battledome chat boards - a lot of old time BDers know most of the legit players who would have those big ticket items.  Finally, check out the seller's account.  Does it look like they've put in the time and effort to have the resources to buy a MSPP?  If your gut tells you no on any of these things find a new seller."

I'll offer a reddit discount for the right people, but I've had enough abuse from strangers on the internet for one day so I'm not so keen. Might just put it in my SDB to rot. I just want to save up as much as I can right now, I gave away over 250k within the last fortnight for a reddit giveaway, I try to be generous where I can but if somebody really wants this (rather than a reseller who just wants to make a quick buck off a gullible TPer) then they'll probably be able to spare that extra few k for it.  My experience of the TP is that people won't ever offer the asking price. So at least by hedging my bets and attempting to get a higher amount for it, I'm doing better than settling for a quick sale for less than what it's worth just to keep internet strangers from being turds to me.  Sorry if this is rambling. I've had a long and stressful day and it makes me sad that so many neo-lovelies have been neo-asses to me over such a non-issue.

This is to better help communicate that i am willing to go lower than TP-Price as i am willing to haggle on nearly every item i have for sale.  That- and because i seldom never expect to pay full price for item, I don't expect any of my fellow Neopian-Redditors to either.  I like to stress that this is not the Neoboards Trade/Auctions board, but a much more easy-going place where you can find the best deals possible.    While this is a selling (and other things) thread, i want to extend my fellow redditors the best deals possible, any redditor-Neopian will be discounted further after lowest TP price is established.    Ex:  I have a Cool Negg listed for 700k because the most recent insistence i searched TP for Cool Neggs listed them no lower than 700k.  The next day when i ""re-post,"" or copy and paste, my for-sale listing, my price could be higher than what another user is asking.  Let's say they're asking 650k.  If that's the case, or just in general my asking price is higher than lowest TP, shoot me a message letting me know.  I will adjust my asking price to 650k (lowest TP). With the newly established TP price, i will discount the opening-price for redditors to ensure no one ever pays even the lowest TP price being asked at the time.  Using the Cool Negg example, I then price quote you at 625k.  It is at this point we sit down at the table to haggle.  After:     Lowest TP has been established   Redditor discount has been applied to TP-Price   Final price quote has been given     the buyer may choose to counter-offer the Final-Price quote.  Best way to put it simply is i'm asking lowest TP, regardless of someone listing a price lower than my reddit post + i'm willing to go beyond that by giving redditors extra slack than i would give anyone i randomly meet on Neo.  A redditor may make an offer any time they like. Hell, your first inquiry to me about an item may certainly be/include your offer if you so choose.    I feel doing it this way i described gives users the best value and in-turn creates more incentive to inquire about an item or items.    Side Note:    I would love to do group sales for those buying more than 1 item at a time.  Doing so will get your price discounted to a greater extent.  Yes you'll be paying more NP overall, but you will also be purchasing each item involved in the transaction at a cheaper price than you would have paid for them separately. My listed-items can be group sold in any combination with each other.  Feel free to let me know/run something by me if ever the occasion were to arise that i possess 2+ items you're seeking to purchase        You can find what i currently have in TP here    Sometimes i'll nuke my trades because i run out of inventory space.  So there may be few to none of the previously mentioned items in my lots. If and when this is the case, you can always find the items I am currently selling in my gallery.    Specifically, you may find these ""for-sale-items"" in the For Salesection of my gallery.  From there, feel free to message me or drop me a mail.    Feel free to do the last part in any case, so long as you follow Rule #1  ;)  Thanks for reading all, hope to do business with the lot of ya.

neopets,3clche,super_pie_lover,5,Wed Jul 8 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"Judging from what you do own, I think people would expect these in a 2:1 trade (2 items for 1 GBC) or even 3:1 and above. Most of those things are buyables (off-hand, haven't checked them thoroughly) so, while you could get GBCs, don't forget you still need to send these things to the trader - which yup, means you need GBCs yourself too. Most likely, in the case of these items, you'll be opening up the GBCs you do receive to just send the items to the trader :/ To answer your question (or what I think you mean) - no, people will not send you GBCs just so you can send their items to them. They expect you to have the boxes available since the items' cap values are low anyway. They gain nothing by sending you boxes. Speaking only for the buyable and 1-2 cap items of course."
neopets,3clche,Vengerai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly be okay with doing 2-for-1 or 3-for-1 trades, but I thought GBCs had like 4-5 boxes in them, meaning that after a while I could save up. Also, would I need to BUY GBCs, or OBTAIN them? And could I get them by having someone trade me a GBC and then opening it to send them their stuff?"
neopets,3clche,ChickenDerby,2,Wed Jul 8 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"Most GBCs contain 2 boxes plus a buyable item. Occasionally you will open one with more boxes--this is like a bonus.  However, right now you can trade the birthday cupcake for at least 1 gbc. If you hold on to it, it will probably increase in value. If you have side accounts, you can also collect the cupcake on those."

neopets,3cj3sx,fettlers,14,Wed Jul 8 08:43:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I think it's common sense that some of this is going to be graphic, but really. Do not read if you can't stomach things like animal abuse (if you consider neopets to be animals...)  It was another lazy day spent in front of the computer screen. Nothing new on social media, not much to see on YouTube, getting increasingly bored – I decide it’s probably time to pay another visit to Neopets. Yes, Neopets. It’s still a thing. I sure didn’t play it as obsessively as I did 10 years ago as a child, but it never stopped being an effective and nostalgic way to kill time.  I log into my account and run my dailies quickly. My pets are famished! I decide it’s probably time to pay a visit to the Giant Omelet. Once that’s done, I quickly satisfy my hunger to my two pets: Oreo2987, my Fire Kougra and Fluffy0780, my orange Uni, both of whom I had had and cherished since my childhood (Yeah, probably not the greatest names in the world, but I was 12, alright?).   “You’re the coolest owner in the world!” they each exclaim to me.   Ah, after all these years, that phrase still means so much to me, even if it’s just some lame message typed out by some programmers in California. After soaking up the heartwarming comment, I then try to continue my dailies, but am halted by the frustratingly slow lag. I sigh deeply and wait for the white screen to produce an image, but after a few minutes, I found myself still staring into nothingness. I’m running out of patience. It’s time to send yet another support ticket to TNT. I slowly click my way to the “report a bug” page and, after waiting my way through the lag, I pester TNT once again with my complaints. I write:  “Dear TNT, Hello. It’s me once again. Pardon my pushiness, but the lag is truly crippling the site. I’m not sure about other users, but I can barely even complete my dailies.”  After pausing for a second, I decide to stop biting my tongue. The amount of general complains I’ve had from this site – from glitches and bugs to unfair freezings, is appalling. These people are professionals, and I expect better from them. I continue:  “I know I’ve written to you guys so many times, but I’m truthfully on my last nerve. You guys really have no control over this site. It seems like every day one of my friends is unfairly frozen, or I uncover some other glitch. Please get your performance together and act like you care for once”  That felt good to get off my chest. I hit the submit button and wait for a response. I then tried to get back to the homepage when I realized that the lag has suddenly stopped. Strange. Just then, at the top of my page, I see the neomail icon appear.   “You have received a neomail from: theneopetsteam”  “Oh, what is it now?” I ask myself as I open the letter.  “You have bitten the hand that feeds. We’ve had enough.” It reads.  What in the hell does that mean? Did I really hurt their feelings that badly? After pondering it for a minute, I shrug it off. Big babies will be big babies, I guess. I then head over to the lab ray. I remember how much I wanted Fluffy to turn robot, as Robot Unis have always had a slick design.  Once at the ray, I’m greeted with the usual pictures of my Neopets crying with a plea for me not to zap them underneath. I ignore it as virtually everybody does, select Fluffy to be zapped, and beam her up. A pop-up window suddenly appears with an animation.   “Hmm, this is different”, I think to myself as I watch on eagerly. The lab ray Scorchio cackles maniacally as he pulls down the lever to the ray. Poor Fluffy, looking all dejected and hopeless, is then zapped and gives out a piercing shriek. She is now just a ball of electricity as the ray continues to shock her for a good couple of minutes.  She lets out a “Nnng!!...ng!” as she is continually electrocuted by the ray. After it finally subsides, I see the finished product of what Fluffy has become. Only half of her fur remains, and it exists in small patches plastered over certain parts of her body. Most of it is burnt to the crisp and has turned her previously orange glow into black. The rest of her is nothing but bones; she’s now a skeleton with a few blobs of burnt fur here and there.  I’m deeply disturbed to say the least…it’s something I’ve never seen or heard of before.  “D-does this happen regularly?” I ask myself in a midst of horror and confusion. “I should probably go to the neoboards and ask. They’ll probably have a lot to say on this.”  I then click the “neoboards” tab on the top banner. In the top left corner, I see that Fluffy’s “active pet” picture is now of her current, deformed state. She is slumped down with her head buried in her paws.  “Fluffy0780 says: I asked you not to zap. I told you...I thought you cared for me” It says below her picture.  Alright, this is simply wrong and not amusing in the least. I frantically click on the Help Chat icon so that I could ask if I was the only person who received this result. After going to the Help Chat, I glance at the top of the page to see a random event.  “Something has happened! Oreo2987 says, ‘How could you do that? She was my sister, you know. I’ll never love you again! NEVER!’”  My God, this is downright sickening. I try to put it all behind me as I immediately scroll down to the help chat posts to see if anyone has had this terrible event occur to their pets as well, but I see that only one post is there on the entire forum.  “It doesn’t feel good, does it?” by theneopetsteam, posted 07:16:48 NST.  Oh God, they’ve taken the forums too. A rush of icy coldness freezes my veins at this point. I reluctantly place my hands onto my mouse, cautiously drag it over to the thread, and click it.  “Oh dear! It seems you have lost the love of your dear old friends! How long has it been? 10 years? Maybe you’ll feel half as hated as we do now, eh? ;)”  I wanted to protest, but they were right. I felt like trash. These were my childhood treasures, these pets…even in my current state of panic, I felt a wave of guilt wash over me. They were just pixels, sure, but I couldn’t bear to see Fluffy in such a miserable form. I don’t know if it will stop them from hating me anymore than they do now, but I decide to head over to the Shop Wizard to buy a morphing potion. I don’t care which one it is, but I’m going to get Fluffy healed again.  I scroll back up to the top banner and click on the Shop Wizard, when I see yet another traumatizing message from Fluffy.  “Fluffy0780 says: Pretty soon, you’re gonna wish you hadn’t improved my strength so much at the Training School…”  Huh? Well, at least she’s not guilt tripping me anymore…or is she? I don’t know what this means, but I just need to get her transformed. I type in “morphing potion” into the shop wizard, when I hear a loud crash outside my bedroom window.  I spring out of my computer chair and run over. As much as it made me jump, it’s actually nice to get a break from the computer. I open my curtains…and there she is. Yes, it was her. Really. Fluffy – or at least what was left of her – was hovering outside my room, flapping her skeletal wings and banging her horn into my window. A shard of the glass flew at me, but my awe-stricken self was frozen in place and unable to dodge it. It cuts me in the cheek, but I feel almost nothing.  “F-f-f-f…” I say while trying to find the words. I had always dreamed of Fluffy being real. Of her materializing in front of me. Of her leaping out of her virtual internet prison and flying into my arms.  But never, ever like this. “Fluffy…p-please!!” I urged her. The deformed Uni kept thrusting into my window.  I was at a loss of what to do. In a clearer state of mind, maybe I would have called the police, or ran out of the house. But I wasn’t in that state of all. I sprinted back to my computer desk and kicked the chair out of the way. If TNT caused this, then surely they can end it!  I furiously clicked my way back to the “Report a bug” page and began to write the most rushed but heartfelt apology of my life.  “TNT, I’m sorry. I’m so so so so sorry I never appreciated you or acknowledged the hard work you put in,” I write. Another shard became dislodged from my window and caused my head to jerk away from the screen, at least for a moment. I then refocus and continue writing.  “I never meant to bother you with all my complaints. I’m sure there was a good reason for all those accounts being frozen. I’m sure you guys worked hard to fix all those bugs. Please, please, please, please find a way to undo all this!”  I wanted to write more, but I was running out of time. The glass on my window was starting to give out. I slam my mouse’s left clicker as I submit the report.   I was not given the typical “Thank you” message I usually receive when I submit a bug, however. Instead, I was redirected to the Neocam.  “The Neocam!?” I shout. That camera hasn’t worked in ages! It’s been the same picture of a couple of computers for several years now!   But not this time. This time, the cam feed was different.  I observe closely as I see a man sitting at his office table. His head is hung low and his eyes are covered by his palms.   Fluffy continues to bang her horn into my window in an attempt to force her way in.  I should have been planning my escape route at this point, but I knew that what was on my screen was not normal. There had to be an answer here.  The neocam page automatically refreshes, as the staff member soon lifts up his head. His eyes are now seen to be bright red, and he was obviously sobbing. The glare he gives to me from the camera drills me. That glare…it’s as if to say “We tried our hardest for you, and you never appreciated it.”  The page automatically refreshes once more. The staff member now has a God-awful smile going from ear to ear. His left hand is now lifted up with a blurring motion, making it apparent that he is waving goodbye to me.  At that moment, I hear my window break completely open. Fluffy bursts in and pierces my throat with her horn."

neopets,3cj3sx,diceroll123,2,Wed Jul 8 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"Nice! I liked it. TNT finally has enough of our whining. What have we unleased? :P  Mirroring what others have said, I probably would have picked a different climax than the ""uni coming to kill you"" angle. Horror writing works best, I think, when it incorporates psychological thrills rather than a slasher-type premise. I would've gone with something like: it gets too creepy so you log out and shut off your computer, but then creepy things start to follow you out in the real world: A store clerk says something eerily reminiscent of something from the site, perhaps, or the ASPCA calls in response to a report of animal cruelty (heh). Have it get more and more sinister, until your character gets insane and paranoid, but always keep it just subtle enough that there's always a chance it could be just happening in your own mind. Or come up with something even more clever. ;)  That being said, the beginning parts with the random event messages and even the Neocam were great imagery. Keep those and flesh out the rest! Remember, the best creepypastas are the ones made to seem real (in other words, they can't die at the end, else they couldn't have told us the story)."

neopets,3cjf2b,MarcyWintumns,3,Wed Jul 8 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"No joke, I never carry less than 10m NP just to try to taunt the Tax Beast. I am completely jealous of you. Except you know, the whole losing NP thing. Sorry about that.   Crisis Courier is one of my favorite games on the site - if you can get a Bronze, you can get a Gold. The layout never changes, so it's simply pattern memorization. The more you play it, the more you figure out which way to go to net the most points and just to stay alive.   When I was going for the gold, I actually doodled the map in one hand while navigating with the other. On each subsequent play through I filled it in with dots for the baddies and made the outlines a little better. Needless to say I wish I still had that paper somewhere to post online (this was yeeeeeeaaars ago).  If you like Crisis Courier, you should try Turmac Roll. They are similar gameplays in my mind, in that it's pattern memorization and reflexes. Turmac Roll has a little more luck involved though as to which bonuses you get, but you can play forever once you memorize the patterns."
neopets,3cjf2b,apostolicity,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:37:29 2015 UTC,"It's a bit hard for me to care about the Neopoints on hand when my focus is on the Stock Market. IIRC, what I had on hand was only Stock Market returns. 130k is a decent exchanfe for a new trophy.  I had already memorized crisis courier, then I forget and mess up. Bronze was good enoigh for me back then; I just wanted a trophy. I may try to gold it sooner or later.  I honestly hate Turmac Roll because of the double tree stump."
neopets,3cjf2b,apostolicity,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"Ha! Fair point.  Have you tried Hot Dog Hero? It's another Action game with IDENTICAL gameplay every time. Very easy controls, and no ""double tree stump"" issues to worry about. I think it's actually a fun game, too, considering how repetitive it is between gameplays. Getting a gold trophy is fairly easy once you memorize it, especially towards the beginning of a month."

neopets,3cjpx0,super_pie_lover,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:37 2015 UTC,So would you trade for Sylincer and then give him back to me after I continue the chain?

neopets,3ch4hf,krisabilly,29,Tue Jul 7 21:46:45 2015 UTC,Dank_fire is the most intriguing name.   Well the guy who adopted him got frozen so clearly a wrong decision was made. #justicefordank_fire

neopets,3ch4hf,SkyUraeus,16,Tue Jul 7 23:28:07 2015 UTC,"""Go to sleep chaos"" said Alex as he tucked chaos in   ""We are only staying here for a week and thier is nothing in the woods!""   ""But i heard something i really did!"" replied chaos  ""Thats enough know go to sleep!"" said Alex  ....tossing and turning alone in his room he shivered as he heard the crying coming from the woods out the window.   ""i know something is out their....and whatever is im gonna find it"" Chaos whispered  So he flied out the window torwards the woods with nothing but a flashlight</center><center> He silently crept through the woods following the cries. It started to rain he was about to turn back but he knew he was close so he continued and what he found was a suprise. It was a red draik!   His name was dank_fire he was scared...he got separated from his owner twilightfox0.   ""Oh he-hello....dont hurt me!"" said dank_fire  ""Dont worry im here to rescue you!"" responded chaos  ""Rescue me...? Oh thank you!"" dank_fire cried  ""Wait until Alex see's you! He applied for you but then he was crushed because he reused content from his previous application"" Chaos explained  So dank_fire was recued...though Alex still didnt get to adopt dank_fire he was so happy he was found and has a good home.  The End. I hope you enjoyed it.  Eh...could have been a lot worse."
neopets,3ch4hf,youresojelly,3,Tue Jul 7 23:45:54 2015 UTC,red draik   He was a red draik? Why were you talking about his color in your application?
neopets,3ch4hf,Im5andwhatisthis,5,Wed Jul 8 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"No clue. It was a time when I was still learning the difference between ""know"" and ""now"" so not a lot of sense was made during those days. I was probably alluding to race/species or something."

neopets,3ch4hf,faerieninja,6,Wed Jul 8 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"No...I never did get a Draik </3. But I saved up and eventually had enough for a Krawk instead :).   Some background info: From what I remember this user was part of a guild that I was part of and this was the second Draik I applied for. The admin of the guild saw I reused content from another application I made and told this user (because lets stress out a 10 year old struggling with HTML) about it, or the user found out on their own but I'm pretty sure it was the admin. So I redid the application to form the mess you see.  Then when I expressed interest in another Draik after dank_fire the admin of the guild called me out and said I don't really love the pets I'm applying for and want them just for the species they are. She told me to make a Kacheek and prove that I would love it just the same. I made one and got kicked out of the guild anyway. You never forget Neopets drama."
neopets,3ch4hf,ostentia,2,Wed Jul 8 02:22:39 2015 UTC,So .. Do you still want a draik??

neopets,3cjbbd,mkjo0617,3,Wed Jul 8 14:55:16 2015 UTC,It means that the pet is/was in the pound but not visible to the public. If any of these pets currently have an owner then it most likely means that a lurker of this thread picked one of them up but did not indicate doing so.

I usually have a few 100k out for restocking, and I have noticed I've been getting quite a few random events but that's likely due to all the refreshing I do while restocking. This one is by far the best I've got recently though, the others are just extra NPs here & there, or inconsequential events that do nothing. Although I have only been back on the site for a few weeks now, so that's maybe not enough time to tell!"

I've checked every email I've ever owned so I'm at a lost as to what email it could possibly be! Also tried 24+ different passwords throughout the week xD i'm desperate! (I want my labray back!)
neopets,3chvwt,Syndaquil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:22:27 2015 UTC,Could try messaging the neopets team about it. They may ask various questions to make sure you are the account holder but may work.

I mean, not that it's surprising people are unhappy, but that people are thinking Neopets is dying. I even thought JS were trying to fix it :x To add: always glad to hear honest opinions, and can understand why you'd be upset about how the site is being run, and is functioning now, but I'm hoping that JST are still trying to earn their keep :)"

neopets,3cfoiu,khonrichan,11,Tue Jul 7 23:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yes! Maybe all the little issues that are happening, and the art that doesn't look like they tried very hard, is because they are focusing on fixing the BIG issues. Then after they do that, they will fix all the little issues and it will be great again! Or maybe they are working on a plot or something. Idk, but we have to have hope! If we keep being negative, then JS might say ""fuck it, these users are jerks!"" and then just shut it down or continue to let it rot until it bursts in to flames."

They're clearly working on fixes, they said so, and though I don't trust their word on a lot of things, I trust them on that. But to fix the backend of Neopets would take not just serious man hours, but you'd have to know somebody who did all that coding. It wasn't written for any programmer to be able to jump in and take it from there, even though that's how you're SUPPOSED to code. It was written by a bunch of individuals gradually over time in ways that only they understand. So you'd have to be in the know, or scrap the whole thing and build from the top, hoping you include all the prior stuff."

By any objective measure, Neopets is neither improving nor worsening.  It is just...stagnant.  We have no evidence that it is effectively abandoned, nor do we have any evidence that things are improving.  Pair that with the shitty artwork of late, the rash of people whose Premium magically renewed despite cancellation requests, an inability to activate new items properly (stamps that cannot be albumed and books that cannot be read), an unwillingness to make an Altador Cup prize pool that is not 50% recycled crap, and the absence of new (functioning) pet colors and the picture looks pretty damn bleak.  Folks can hold onto their Pollyanna pie-in-the-sky high hopes all they want, but Neopets really is in a slow death spiral.  The key to happiness is accepting that and simply enjoying the ride downhill.    WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!"

neopets,3cfoiu,floridanatural9,3,Tue Jul 7 18:28:41 2015 UTC,I sorta think they are working on a plot or some sort of larger activity because before Droplet was dropped (heh) she mentioned that things were being put to the side to focus on other projects... so that's why I think the artwork is lacking and the put a slack job prize shop up.   They are focusing their art on something else right now. I don't think it's abandoned at all and you're right.

We could even print/write copies and send some in the mail.  With that being said, it would have to be civil and formal and not a list of complaints and why we hate JS.  It wouldn't be about being butthurt over people being fired, but just over what we hope to see done in the future of Neopets."

neopets,3cg0fe,everythingshines,3,Tue Jul 7 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the thing the neopets community needs most is transparency. If Neopets at least tells us what they're really working on, and gives us updates frequently enough so that we aren't left guessing exactly what they're doing, the community would be much more supportive of them."
neopets,3cg0fe,Probably_not_aladdin,2,Wed Jul 8 06:48:26 2015 UTC,I think it all boils down to this.
neopets,3cg0fe,everythingshines,10,Wed Jul 8 23:24:26 2015 UTC,"A majority of people on Neo are unhappy? Hmm.. News to me. I think unhappy people like to shout their feelings, but there are a number of us who have a great time while understanding that Neopets is a business and things need to change. A majority of people have never worked for JS or Neopets so we have no clue what goes on behind the scenes. Perhaps everyone let go was ineffective. Perhaps there were budget cuts. Perhaps there are coding aspects being changed that don't add features but improve data storage and access.   People can go write letters, by all means. But I still have yet to hear an argument against JS and Neopets that I would stand behind."
neopets,3cg0fe,TubOfSoda,15,Tue Jul 7 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. Neo has needed a change for a long time now. Once they fix the frankencoding and get all that squared away, I am convinced we will see positive change. Everything that has happened thus far, needed to happen."
neopets,3cg0fe,UhOhFeministOnReddit,5,Tue Jul 7 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"The boards have been filled with complaint threads, most of the people I have talked to have qualms, and if I see another neopocalypse thread on this subreddit I will bang my head against the wall. So, yeah, I would say a good number of us are unhappy or dissatisfied to a certain degree, at least with the lack of transparency on JS's end.  I understand that there are people who are indifferent about what has been happening. I was just pointing out to those who are unhappy, that they should direct their voices towards those who have the power to change things. I have been frustrated at times this past year. While ranting with my friends and poking fun at JS is fun sometimes, it doesn't solve anything.   I also posted this because I was wondering if people have tried to contact JS in the past, because I feel like they don't know what we're upset about. They can't help us if we don't tell them what we want from them, you know?"
neopets,3cg0fe,TubOfSoda,3,Tue Jul 7 18:10:46 2015 UTC,"If I went by what I saw on the board then about 99% of the population was frozen after the mods went down. But that's not the case and most people didn't get frozen. It's not representative.   It's not about being indifferent. It's that there is nothing negative happening to complain about!!   As an older Neopian, I am probably one of the few executives on here who runs a good size company. It is amazing how many things happen that you would never know about, even at JS. Your first (incorrect) assumption is that JS doesn't know your complaints. Your second (incorrect) assumption is that JS isn't trying to solve them right now!   What users need to understand is that the Company will solve problems as they see fit but they will solve them. Site is slow and things are out of date and not working well? FIRE THE WHOLE STAFF.  I'd do the same damn thing. Get new blood and new people in to bring new ideas and get things done. Perhaps not the path people wanted to see JS take but no one gets to choose for them. No one here knows the REAL problems with Neopets. We only see the front end.   Point being, your voice is heard. It just may not be the outcome you want."

Nothing negative to complain about?!?  I applaud your positive attitude, but here are a few negative things to complain about:   Shitty new artwork Premium auto-renewing after cancellation Books that cannot be read Stamps that cannot be albumed New pet colors announced but not viable (some pastel shit I don't care about but others do) Horrible Altador Cup prize pool And much, much more...   If you look, there is plenty to complain about.  I just think most of us have been lulled into a sense of stability about just how much ""suck"" we can tolerate.   No one here knows the REAL problems with Neopets.    This is very true.  Despite this fact, however, it does not take a rocket scientist to see that JS doesn't either."
neopets,3cg0fe,TubOfSoda,8,Tue Jul 7 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, are you high?    This is one of my favorite comments today :)  No joke, I LOLed at work.  Here's my lack of complaint: The site has and has always had tons of problems.  The front end (and my assumption the back end) grew waaaay too fast and was put together with shoddy coding.  How the site is now, it is extremely man-hour intensive.  Coding from the early 2000's was clunky and the number of broken links on one page but not another indicates that Neopets has become too large to manage without a giant team of real live people always at the ready fixing problems and updating things.    Some recent art work is shitty.  So are some past artwork. I saw the post someone complaining that a new plushie was simply a dotted line addition of the actual pet.  But look at all of the different color plushies anyways!!  Most all of them come from the same template and are just recolored.    Sure, AC prizes at the very top were crappy.  But, given how much you could buy with only 500 points, I bet the average Neopian only earned 100 or so points total.  I'm not trying to defend JS (though I am sure it comes across that way) I just don't see the difference between Neopets and any of the video games that I've purchased Day 1 with tons of bugs.  It's annoying.  They get patched.  We'd all like it if it didn't happen, but it does.  If you don't give JS money, then you are using a free site.  That's pretty awesome to begin with."

That's good...it means you took it in the spirit in which I meant it.  :-) I always enjoy (and usually agree with) your posts, so this one just struck me as though someone had hacked your reddit account.    Thank-you for the thoughtful reply!"
neopets,3cg0fe,6thninja,3,Tue Jul 7 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"While some  of the things on your list are very vaild complaints (there's no excuse for shitty artwork, and causing problems with the people paying real money for premium is unnacceptable), some of your list is pretty trivial. The AC prize pool is pretty similar every year, and if a stamp cannot be albumed I can put it in my SDB until they activate it. I'll give Jumpstaff the benefit of the doubt and assume they have bigger projects than activating one item of thousands, and are prioritizing accordingly."
neopets,3cg0fe,Superkouza,2,Tue Jul 7 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"TNT wasn't fired, they were laid off. But even if getting rid of TNT was to fix things, how is it that things are worse now that they're gone? And it's just lack of resources or amateur hour content, it's rookie mistakes that only the greenest newbie would make."
neopets,3cg0fe,TubOfSoda,2,Tue Jul 7 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"But you assume that what you care about on the front end is what JS cares about.  TNT catered on a personal level to the users.  It might have felt great, but I doubt it's sustainable.    I bet most everyone who complains thinks this shit is easy.  That running a company, managing a team, dealing with passionate users, upgrading and running a database with millions upon millions of fields and data sets, developing creative processes, managing and upgrading websites, troubleshooting and debugging, balancing the economy, all while being profitable (that's a requirement!) is easy.  Fact of the matter is that it is not easy and there may be HUGE problems that the recently let go TNT staff was not addressing and really needs to be addressed (or maybe there were budget cuts?).  Sure, something might suffer in the process for a time, but I'm willing to stick through it to get something better in the end."
neopets,3cg0fe,Superkouza,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"But if what I care about on the front end isn't what Jumpstaff cares about, how do we define ""better?"" Jumpstaff fixes what they want and neglects what I want, why is that better if everything I want gets neglected?   What's further, it was the JumpStart management who said they could do this. If it's more than they can chew, it's their fault for not investing in the resources they needed. As opposed to laying those resources off."
neopets,3cg0fe,UhOhFeministOnReddit,2,Tue Jul 7 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to jump in and point out that the old Neopets team may have no longer been a resource. I'm not saying they aren't marvelously creative people, I'm saying that's all they are. Back when Neo first came out (during the .com boom) coding wasn't really that hard. It was easy enough for even a dipshit like me because options were limited, it was HTML heavy (again even I know HTML), and what I didn't understand I could look up and comprehend in a New York minute. That is not so today.  Now, if I'm being pragmatic and honest, I feel like management took no steps to fix the coding problem and TNT wasn't qualified enough to fix it. That's fine. But why would you spend a fortune on a ton of artists when what you need are programmers? The art is going to be bad for awhile, but I started playing about 6-10 months after the site went live and if you want to talk about bad art... boy I tell ya. The faeries didn't even have faces. The art wasn't the draw to Neopets for me, and that's what made it such a fantastic website. The sheer creativity of the concept and the things that it allowed you to do was the draw to the site. The art is the last thing anyone should be worried about. As JS falls into the swing of things, it will absolutely get better. Until then we all need to be patient. I'd rather have this than nothing at all, and I am sure a lot of people feel the same.  In the mean time if you really want to speed things up, buy premium, NC, and merchandise. Support this site that has been letting nerds like us play free for over a decade and try to remember that JS is trying even though it does not feel like it.  It took a lot of players years to learn this website. Before resources like Jellyneo came about, this was a site of labyrinthine proportions that just boggled the mind and took so much hard work to figure out. Can you imagine trying to learn both the playable aspects of the site as well as how to run it? I'd die, lmao. I couldn't do it."
neopets,3cg0fe,Superkouza,2,Tue Jul 7 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"Art isn't the only problem. It's lack of content, lack of accountability, lack of foresight, they're making rookie mistakes. TNT was a resource in that they knew how to run the site. And as long as the site is running regularly, why would you need to be replaced? What is this coding problem? The backend is tough for a new staffer to navigate, but you don't need a new staffer to understand it if you have old staffers who understand it."

neopets,3cg0fe,everythingshines,2,Tue Jul 7 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"cracks knuckles I happen to be a prolific writer  :3  I can maybe help a bit here?  I'm not used to writing formal letters or letters to companies though:    To the JumpStart Corporate team:  I am writing on behalf of some of the Neopets community, and with their collaboration as well, to bring to your attention our profound dissatisfaction of how JumpStart has handled Neopets after taking the reins from Viacom.    We personally feel the website has not been going in an ideal direction: from the lessened quality of art being released by your new artists, lessened quality of new features and written content, and programmers' inability to properly activate new items, to the June 28th disaster which occurred on the Neoboards, and your paying premium customers having their memberships forcibly reactivated and charged despite cancelling.  We as a community feel that we are not having our pleas and suggestions heard by the new staff working on Neopets, and we want to express our hopes and expectations of the future of Neopets to you:   More skilled, talented artists putting out content Reorientation regarding your focus of demographic Long, in depth plots (reminiscent of the Battle for Meridell or Lost Desert Plots) Updated coding Better and improved customer support, as well as a complaint system for unsatisfactory support. Bringing back Key Quest (I need help with this list of stuff and with revising it as well)   Additionally, we believe a representative to hear our suggestions and complaints, someone continually relaying these thoughts to the Neopets team, would be greatly helpful to the future of Neopets, and would help to connect the userbase with the team working on Neopets.  To aid with this, we would also like transparency regarding what the new team is working on.  We cannot support them as a userbase when we have no idea what they are putting their work into.  Simply having us in the know, and sharing the struggles with the successes, would greatly improve relations between the new team and the Neopets userbase.  We sincerely hope to have these expectations addressed eventually, but more importantly, we hope that the team working on Neopets is actively taking a role and passion to learn how the old team ran the site, with improvements in mind.      I don't know how to end letters well, and also I have to leave for a little while, I'll be back later.  Suggestions and critique would be appreciated!  :3"

neopets,3cgrhg,Ro-Dent,3,Tue Jul 7 20:27:55 2015 UTC,Instead of Tesla... how about Nikola? It's been used as a female name before :)
neopets,3cgrhg,Vengerai,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:35:36 2015 UTC,We used to have a mutual horrid boss named Nick. He broke the name for us. I know Tesla is a little different but that's why it's a middle ;) We're open to science/astronomy names that aren't too normal but aren't just too far out there). If it was a boy his middle was going to be Keplar or Atom.
neopets,3cgrhg,Ro-Dent,3,Tue Jul 7 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, those names are definitely something cool. Unique! Tesla really is something fantastic as a name.

I went in that day and put in my notice. There were tons of other issues but that was my last straw. When he had called I was at the pediatrician with my first baby. He gave me an hour to get to work (I still had a week and a half left on leave). I called my mom, she came to the doc and stayed with my boy, and I went to work and put in my notice. Called the owner too."

But it might just be the case where I am, we don't believe in a minimum wage (or at least the government doesn't), so McD's pays their regular staff $5/h (which is... well, divided by 1.3 or so for USD).

neopets,3cgrhg,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"YES! I always loved the first game, then when the second came out I was super stoked :p Forgot about it for awhile, but found the discs for the Ultimate Collection last week, so couldn't resist getting back into it :D  Well I have no idea what to do D: This is going to turn into a BIIIIIIIG post, and I sincerely apologize, you don't need to read through it - I really just need to get it off my chest o-o   Basically, my ""friend"" is a bit of a bitch.   She (let's name her ""M"") used to date this boy (L), and things went really wrong. He cheated on her multiple times, which messed her up, but she always went back to him. Heck, when they broke up for the final time, they continued to be Friends with Benefits while he cheated on girl after girl WITH her. So, she screamed bloody murder when he cheated on her, but she's perfectly fine with being the one he cheats with? She thought it was hilarious and was loving the fact that she was his ""bit on the side"".  Skip foward, and she gets introduced to mine and my BF's best friend (C). She stops talking to L so that they can start dating, and we thought everything was great! Until she kept running to me to tell me how awful C was. How he hit her, how he's nothing but a cheat, how he does absolutely nothing for her and insults her all the time. Turns out none of those things are true, she was doing it all for attention, but he didn't know that she was saying all this horrible stuff about him. She said on multiple occassions that she was going to leave him because she doesn't love him anymore, but it never happened.   Skip again to about 4 weeks ago. By this point, they've been going out for just over a year. Me and my BF go up to C's house to visit them both, and she has me in the bedroom all night, talking shit about him. How she's REPULSED by him, how she can't stand the sight of him and hates him with a passion. She also tells me that she's started talking to L again, and they've been getting real cosy.  Over the next week or so, she meets up with L pretty much every day, and they're telling each other how much they love each other. C still has no idea. I tell M over and over again that she needs to break up with C, since he'd be absolutely heartbroken if he knew ANY of what she was saying, let alone if he knew she was talking to L again (considering their history together), but she makes excuse after excuse. She even swears to C that she hasn't spoken to L, and has no intention to ever speak to him. So it gets to the point where me and my BF give her an ultimatum - she either breaks up with C NOW, or we tell him. She gets unbelievably angry, but breaks up with him anyway because she's ""scared of looking like a bad person""... Great, their toxic relationship is over, they can both move on and be finished with it all.  But guess what? They're still talking. She still tells me how much she hates him - how she wants nothing to do with him, but she'd ""feel bad for not being friends"". She tells me how desperate he's being, constantly asking her to come up and visit for sex and stuff, after she ""told him that nothing is ever happening between them again"". I didn't believe a word of it. Turns out, she's been sending him nudes, begging him not to find another girl, basically flat-out leading him on. She managed to convince him to send her nudes (which he's never done), and she was bragging to me about how she wants to upload them after she convinces him to delete hers?? Luckily I told her that you can get in deep trouble for that now, so she isn't going to bother. But it's the fact that she's telling me that it's HIM that can't get over it, when in reality, it's her. Oh, and the nudes and sexts she sent C? ALL stuff she sent to L a few days before.  The even-more-crappy part? She's been telling C that she isn't interested in any other guy, she still loves him. But she's been sleeping with L repeatedly since the night before they broke up. :| But hey, the WORST part? L (age 18) is dating this 15 year old girl (A), who is the little sister of mine/BF's/C's best friend. We all love her. M also knows A, as she was her mentor in school. :|  A came up to me and M while we were at the bus stop yesterday, and she was saying how she knows that M & L are ""talking"" again (doesn't know the truth), but that she's alright with it as she trusts them both so much that she knows they won't do that to her.... M replied with ""oh God, you have no need to worry! I'd NEVER do that to ANYONE, especially you! You're practically my little sister, I'd never do anything to hurt you, I love you! :D""... It infuriated me, I wish I had said something then and there.  So yeah. C is being trailed along, M is a bitch, L is an asshat, and poor A is stuck trusting two people that she really shouldn't. I want to tell C and A so badly, I know that I should and that I'm a horrible person if I don't... But I'm scared because that means M and all her friends/family will hate my guts, and because of that, L will hate me and probably get his friends after me since he has a lot of connections... D: I hate myself for being so selfish, and I hate myself for looking for sneaky ways I can inform them (or at least A's big brother, since he hates L anyway), so that I don't get into bother.... >-< I know I need to man up and tell everyone everything, I just don't know how. :/"
neopets,3cgrhg,XxBlazingWolfxX,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:12:46 2015 UTC,"Oh honey. Holy shit. Okay, honestly, C and A need to know. Although with A being young (15) she's probably immature and will blow you off. :/   But C. God damn. That's just sad. I'm not sure if you said he's your BF's best friend but have you tried talking to your BF about it and seeing if he can help. If that doesn't work, try an anonymous letter or email and just spill everything you want to.   Also, you need to cut M out of your life. She seems very manipulative. She tells you all these terrible things C does to her and plays the part of the victim to get your sympathy. From what you said she gives no positive information about him and just strings him along while cheat and being used to cheat. You can gain nothing from having a person that scummy in your life.   It honestly sounds like a huge mess. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. You aren't being selfish. You have to look out for yourself and your feelings. If you ever feel like you are in danger because of these people, leave. Call someone you know to come get you. If you have to, go to the police.   I'm always here to talk. Always. You shouldn't have to go through this alone."

Which is a good thing :p I just don't want her to hate me for it... When I was at school, she seemed to stick to me (she was already friendly with my BF, since as mentioned, her big brother is also my BF's and C's best friend), and she's such a lovely girl. Whenever she sees me or my BF, she's like ""HAS HE POPPED THE QUESTION YET?!"", it's so cute. :p  I know, right? :/ I feel so bad with him... I don't really class him as a friend of mine, since he's my BF's best friend, but we get along extremely well. So I feel horrible that he knows nothing, which is partly my fault for not telling him ;-; Yeah my BF knows, he was friendly with M until I told him that she was speaking to L. I tell him everything (though she thinks he doesn't know most of what she's done), and it's frustrating him as much as it is me. He said he's willing to take the fall of it all, but I obviously can't let him take any of the blame if things go wrong. The only reason he hasn't told C, is because he doesn't want to land me in it D:  She is EXTREMELY manipulative :/ Always wondered why her friends kept falling out with her and why everyone tends to hate her, and now I know why. I don't trust her with anything - she always bitches to me about her ""friends"", so she sure as hell bitches about me to them. :s I'm literally just putting up with her because (up till all this happened) I felt bad for her, I'm the kind of person that can't bear to hurt someone else, so I never wanted to just ditch her... But now I see it needs to be done, because she's definitely making my depression worse, which I really don't need :s  It all seems so much worse because we're all connected :/ Heck, she even tried to turn my BF against C as well with all the nasty things she was saying about him. And for awhile, it kinda worked, but then we both realised that she's full of so much BS. She ALWAYS plays the victim, always has by the sounds of it, and it's frustrating when no one else seems to see past her lies. >-<  I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Me and BF were trying to come up with sneaky ways earlier :s He said he'd make a fake FB page, use a proxy, and message C that way.. but no matter what we do, it'll come back on me anyway, because no one knows any of this apart from me :/ So she'll know straight away that it's me that's told. o-o Ahwell...  I'd have nowhere else to go :/ Living with my BF and his family, and I have no family within 700 miles. Police would be the best idea, though I'm scared of stuff like that, so I'd probably just let whatever happens, happen. o-o  Thank you very much for the help, it means a lot to me, really. Certainly feel a bit better getting it off my chest haha :s Once again, I'm sorry for the big post. D: I'm so grateful for you taking the time to read it and helping ♥"

neopets,3cgrhg,Col_America,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"I've been revisiting some old games this vacation :) Resident Evil 4 and 6, Mass Effect 3, maybe some Borderlands later - played too much of BL2 that even the Pre-Sequel became such a grind. However, I also finished Divinity: Original Sin which was absolutely divine. I had such a hard time with it as an old-school RPG noob, but it was soooo good, I'm going to play it again when I've recovered from those crazy turn-based battles :) Then maybe that old XCOM: Enemy Unknown I've been putting off. I also finally got to playing Dead Space 3 with a friend and it's hilarious how she keeps getting upset at all the jump scares :P Meanwhile I'm mowing things down with a flamethrower and laughing at those silly, silly necromorphs :) After DS3 we're going to tackle Typing of the Dead, because we're... kooky I guess :P I'm still waiting on Life is Strange to complete itself, but I watched some Let's Plays of it and God I am so disappointed with how it's turning out so far :/ I haven't played Mobile Games as of late, maybe dabbled in a bit more PvZ2 and Infinity Blade 2 and 3?    Outside of games: In other news the stupid company I bought my laptop from has refused to fix it for me :( I've had this flashy monster of a laptop for about 2 years now and it's served me faithfully, but it's always had problems. Like the mic and speakers randomly getting unplugged, a whole bunch of keys not functioning, randomly rebooting (usually if I hit the palm rest or something) and now the battery is just dead. It has to stay plugged in all the damn time if I want it to work. So I had a 4-year warranty thing going on, and for the past two years service engineers have come to my house to fix my laptop for me (although they don't know shit since all they do is switch out parts and never fix the problem, and someone even switched out my mobo ""because it looks old""), but now, they have this new shit where they claim I have Parts-Only Warranty, where I'm supposed to just receive new parts from them and fix the damn thing myself. What gives?! I'm not gonna be a Johnny Moronic here, I don't even know where to start fixing this damn beast :/"

neopets,3cgrhg,E6E6FA,3,Tue Jul 7 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Sadness :( Divinity is really great, I'm genuinely surprised I enjoy it since I've always found turn-based combat a bit too slow for my tastes. Not that D:OS isn't slow, but it was really enjoyable :) Not sure what the hardcore RPG fans would think about it, but it was enough of a challenge for a noob like me! I think the only other turn-based RPG I've played was... South Park. :) I think most Resident Evil fans would like Dead Space, they're almost essentially the same damn thing, except Dead Space is just way more futuristic and has more gore I think. I usually focus too much on my friend getting scared, and anyway, everything can be killed with enough fire :P Jump scares get old after awhile, just need to prep your gun around every corner. ;) Boo, sorry to hear about your laptop too. I always worry about gadgets breaking down (so pricey) and not knowing what to do. Don't really understand how these things only last a few years :/ Alienware actually makes manuals on how to disassemble the laptop and get to the parts, but I have butterfingers so I'm putting it off :x"

I was told FFVI and FFVII are the best, is that true? It depends on which Resident Evil you wanna play :) The original, first game was recently remastered and put on Steam, but it was a bit too slow for me. The loading screens were still terrible, weapons aiming was bad, and it wasn't creepy so it wasn't worth the trade-off in terms of gameplay. Resident Evil 4 however, is my absolute favourite. Just really good progression and atmosphere, satisfying gunplay (even if it's tank controls). RE5 is a good co-op experience, much flashier and more blockbuster than RE4. RE6 is just full-blown two-person co-op mayhem. Lots of explosions, car chases, etc. A bit too overdone for me, but it was really fun with friends and in the timed modes :)"

I'm just a little disappointed they chose to go that whole ""time travelling is really bad with these huge, major consequences"". I mean, I get how it is, just wish someone would come up with a game where they made time-travelling super cool with lots of different possibilities that weren't so clearly right or wrong. :x It's Dell, they own bad customer service :P"
neopets,3cgrhg,Vengerai,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"I've never owned a Dell product, so I wouldn't know :p  I really like the time-travelling idea, but I also liked the idea that you couldn't rewind time in certain areas. Rewinding time whenever you want would feel sort of like cheating to me.  I didn't like how they made Chloe kinda insensitive, though. In ep 2 when Max told her about the power, all Chloe wanted to do was play games with it, and Chloe completely disregarded Max's idea that she should conserve her power. Also, Chloe got irrationally mad at Max for taking Kate's phone call. These are all trivial - I just wanted to rant, but I currently love the series and have a lot of hope for it."
neopets,3cgrhg,MellyGirl123,2,Tue Jul 7 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"I think if you could rewind time everywhere, the game-makers would go nuts trying to figure out possible outcomes since that's what they've been trying to get at so far: small actions have big consequences when it comes to time. :) I feel like LiS is going to end up as restrictive and melodramatic as TWD (if you enjoyed it, great for you!), which is disappointing. I thought LiS was more humane and real though, since it really captures that feeling people tend to have about wanting to do the right thing in the past, regretting their choices and constantly doubting if a decision made was the right one and whether it'll have a pivotal role in the future. I had so much hope for it but the ending of episode 3 told me they were choosing the dramatic and 'shocking' path, I didn't like that very much :/ And yes, I hated Chloe so much in the first two episodes. I watched CTK playthrough the first two episodes, and what he snarked about Chloe was so accurate: ""Me me me me me."" It was so sickening to see that sort of attitude coming from her when it's her supposed best friend. It's like Max said later on about how Chloe always rags on Max for not being there for her when Chloe isn't a great friend either. I never saw Chloe being a good or supportive friend in any way. All she does is get Max in trouble for her choices while making irrational, childish logical leaps and unfair demands. I got even more annoyed in episode 3 when Chloe blames her dead father for her life being a shithole and blames Max too. Just stop, not everything is about you, your father didn't die to fuck you up. URGH. Max isn't very likable but gah, Chloe is worse. Okay, rant over. Guess we both had lots to say about the game :P"
neopets,3cgrhg,Vengerai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I hope that it doesn't become that limited, but I have a strong feeling that it will be. However, the game will have lots of replay-ability because you can choose to do different things.  I feel like Chloe might have some deep psychological issues that no one really addresses. In fact, I think they all have real issues: Max has some form of a depression/anxiety combo, Chloe has anger issues, Kate has serious depression, and even David has some version of PTSD. I've even heard theories that the tornado represents a huge shitstorm of emotions from the different characters.   Idk man, I think we both got too invested in this game..."

I took every character (plus Gaige and Krieg) to level 60 and even got halfway into the OP levels with Zer0. I just got so sick of it after awhile :/ I thought TPS would be a breath of fresh air but it was just BL2 all over again, not that the same thing is bad, it was just too much. Especially since BL2 had like, four DLC adventures (Tiny Tina!) - I've just played too damn much of it :/ Unfortunately I think Gearbox is putting off BL3 indefinitely since they don't quite know what direction to take yet. I'm on the edge of my seat for Dishonored 2 right now. SO GOOD. Need new games! Also it seems as if BL a really romantic game? I've heard so many people play it with their SOs. I used to as well :P"

Perhaps this winter i can try a new game - multiple people have told me about dishonored, maybe I'll try it! I got sucked into Skyrim and all the AC's and finished Portal 2 too quickly.

neopets,3cgrhg,snowwhite52,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:00:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the drop in co-op is amazing, I've yet to find another shooter that does it like this. Dead Space 3 tried to replicate it (and advertise it as such), but it really isn't the same at all :) I was going to take Zero to OP8 but... man, it would've taken too long, Digistruct Peak is really too much of a grind, can't stand it. And yes, I would die in minutes too, even using a cheese weapon like the Grog Nozzle :P Tiny Tina is so totally nuts, one of my favourite characters in the franchise. Gotta love a girl who knows her way around a stick of dynamite haha! Especially if it's a deranged, 13-year-old maniac. Dishonored is really good, but it's definitely not as much shooting and mayhem as Borderlands :) Dishonored is... well, I used a lot of stealth, trying to creep my way into places and murder people undetected. But the powers available and number of paths to achieve an objective are very many, so good! I told another user on here that I was so completely confused by Skyrim. I only remember trying to escape being beheaded, a dragon arriving and then me trying to climb to the top of a tower and just not knowing what to do next. I'm still confused to this day :/ I can definitely recommend Resident Evil games for co-op. RE5 and RE6 were just brilliant for co-op ventures :) The latest was Revelations 2, local co-op available on PC and online for others I think. Divinity:OS like I mentioned is lovely for co-op too, but it's much slower since it's turn-based combat and takes a lot of organising to sort out your skills and such :)"

It does nothing except make OP-level enemies available to you, and what good is that really? :P I see so many people cosplaying as Borderlands characters on Twitter, Gaige and Tiny Tina seem really popular :) Some people really look amazingly like Lilith as well! Resident Evil 4 didn't, but it's an amazing single-player game. It was the very first game I touched on the PS3 because I lusted after it ever since watching someone play it on Youtube. Never gets old for me :) But RE5 is definitely a fun co-op experience, RE6 is pretty action-based and no longer survival horror. Revelations 2 was more of the old-school survival horror style though, since people were complaining! I think you'll enjoy Resident Evil together :) I actually think some games are impossible to play without the person to yell at - in some games you just keep dying because the other person is just snoozing on the other end :P - but I played almost all of Borderlands with someone who was nearly half the world away :P"

neopets,3chgsp,ri-ri,2,Tue Jul 7 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"There's no way to make your pet hungry except for time. Active pets and inactive pets increase in hunger level at the same rate, but the active pet can be affected by REs or site amenities that decrease hunger.  HOWEVER. There are ways to set your pet's hunger to a certain level: if you feed your pet a rainbow melt pizza, its hunger level will be set to ""very full"". That means you can feed it the pizza while it is bloated (at a level of bloated that will accept new food) to decrease its hunger level. Then, if you feed your pet right after (say a stat food) it will be bloated, but it take a shorter time to decrease to a feedable bloated level.  If your pet is healed at the healing springs and gets the ""[petname] is healed and is not hungry anymore"" message, its hunger level will be set to bloated-- but in 3 hours you'll be able to feed it.  If you check your pet into the neolodge, its hunger level will be set to ""bloated"", but if you cancel the lodge, it will be able to eat again in 12 hours.  If your pet gets the Magical Grundo ""not hungry anymore"" option, its hunger level will be set to ""very bloated"".  ETA: Sauce"

neopets,3chgsp,Nesperado,3,Wed Jul 8 00:28:56 2015 UTC,I don't keep NP on my sides so the Soup Faerie feeds those pets. When they complain it makes me cranky. You enjoy that free food! Do you want to go back to the pound?!   Obviously I'm kidding because I really like my little pixels

My strategy was to buy up all the buyable ones I could afford, while still keeping enough neopoints to profit a good bit each week, which got me very close to 500 stamps. I also restock any UB ones that I see (if I'm quick enough) and if they're expensive ones I tend to sell them instead of albuming them so I can get more cheaper stamps.  Then once I did that for a while, I started setting bank goals for myself.  In example: Once I have 45m in the bank, I will buy 10 stamps worth 2m or less. And go from there."

When I opened my GBC I got two items, and 5 boxes  thus ending my long term terrible box shortage. I got into the art gallery on Flotsam Day which I didn't think I would ever manage.   Also, my blood work came back clean (except you know the usually thing internet people need which is more vitamin D, but that's easily fixed). My mri was misread by the tech, and I don't have m.s. And my college financial aid officer told me that I can retain my scholarship while taking a reduced course load. Also, since I'm getting better at art I think I can take the introductory drawing course for this course which is perfect, because drawing is one of the few things I can do consistently without irritating my headaches.

I personally don't bother with NC items, but that's my own thing of not wanting to use real life money. Make sure you recheck prices on what you own. Some stuff I had that was expensive before isn't now but a few things I had that were worthless before are worth more. Prices have changed a lot. Jellyneo is a good pricing source.

If you want to make it safer (13% bust rate, 56% partial 6 to 8:10, 31% 18 to 130:10) then drop dan from all bets except do Dan + Bonnie on the Buck x SEO Bets.  Extra notes: Personally I have a good feeling about TI and/or HH having an upset. Seems likely to me. Put 2 safeties in. Adding Dan to the bets made the bets a lot more risky but a lot more profitable, but I love a little risk and hope Dan can pull through.

That was before the server transition, dupocalypse, and the TnT staff being fired, so I wouldn't be surprised for the number to have dropped to like 3,000-4,000. In fact, I think the counter was stuck at 3,000 for months after the server transition. They eventually removed it, which is sort of a shame. I liked know how many Neopians were online."
neopets,3ceui4,MageKessu,3,Tue Jul 7 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"I have the dark suspicion that they removed it, rather than fixing it, because the numbers were distressingly low.   That said, I think there are definitely more people online now than there were even six months ago."

Food Club bets go through/ reset at approximately 2:30 PM NST (or 14:30 NST). Having the AutoMod thread posted at 7:00 AM NST allows time for plenty of users to come up with bets while allowing odds to potentially change. Also, if we were to post the thread earlier, there is a very high chance of a lot of users not seeing the thread since it tends to not get enough upvotes to continually make it to the front page. We also wouldn't be able to sticky it every day because we have lots of weekly threads and when there is not a weekly thread, we always sticky the daily thread.

We only have one sticky to use at a time (which is reserved for weekly threads or the daily trade thread) but we do have the filter posts option that /u/sabtacular explained!
neopets,3ch6mz,sabtacular,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:47 2015 UTC,Oh! I have a question about this that sort of pertains to it being a 'stickied' thread. Could you do like a little sticky at the top that sorts for FC like you did for the daily thread and like the SSW/Quest thread is? That way people know to just click that. I'm not sure if that would work. I'm rambling here. It sounded like a good idea but I'm not sure how many stickies you can have there.
neopets,3ch6mz,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,3,Tue Jul 7 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"Adding onto /u/shivers_42's comment, the only things tagged/ flaired as ""Daily"" are what get sorted in that notice tab, but not everything that gets a ""Food Club"" flair is the daily Food Club post."
neopets,3ch6mz,shivers_42,3,Tue Jul 7 22:08:55 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense! Thanks for adding to that! :)
neopets,3ch6mz,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:17:07 2015 UTC,"Well the SSW/Quest thread is permanently noticed, but that would be harder to implement with FC because the rounds change daily, so the thread must change daily.  It's really easier to do as a daily thread that Automod can post for us at a specific time each day."
neopets,3ch6mz,everythingshines,2,Tue Jul 7 22:03:40 2015 UTC,That makes sense! :) Thanks for clearing it up!
neopets,3ch6mz,shivers_42,2,Tue Jul 7 22:16:43 2015 UTC,"You're doing an A+ job today /u/shivers_42, thank you."
neopets,3ch6mz,everythingshines,2,Wed Jul 8 04:53:24 2015 UTC,"Aww ty!  I really wish we had a better system with our important threads each day (FC, daily thread, and weekly threads) but we're doing the best with the tools we have.  We're going to try the FC thread a little earlier as a trial run, but if it starts getting buried we'll post it a little later.  Hopefully there's a good middle point! oh how multiple stickies would make life easier"
neopets,3ch6mz,shivers_42,2,Wed Jul 8 04:56:19 2015 UTC,"The way it is now is perfect for me, but I hope I don't notice too much of a difference when doing tomorrow's dailies.  Why don't they just allow multiple stickies, it seems so lame Reddit doesn't do that."
neopets,3ch6mz,Marzipan86,2,Wed Jul 8 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"It's being discussed right now in some gaming and mod subs.  I really hope it does come into fruition.  The issue with multiple stickies is if they were unlimited they could be abused and fill the front page of a sub, but for a lil sub like us with multiple important daily threads it would be a wonderful tool."
neopets,3ch6mz,eyefish,3,Wed Jul 8 05:06:02 2015 UTC,Just do what I do and always go with /u/-cupcake. She (?) posts her bets on her petpage the night before. That solves the issue of betting if you have to be at work before the thread even goes up.
neopets,3ch6mz,UtterEast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:48:35 2015 UTC,I wish that the food clubbers could vote for what they want since they are the ones who use the thread because this topic comes up all the time and seems to be an extremely popular request.   People are searching for threads either way so if most want it... why not hook them up?
neopets,3cc7wc,Lou500,3,Mon Jul 6 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"lol, hopefully JS will continue making this style of content. I think we can all appreciate a good pun/ outdated pop-culture reference."
neopets,3cc7wc,spurplebirdie,3,Mon Jul 6 21:46:08 2015 UTC,"hahah, this is pretty clever. :D"
neopets,3cc7wc,Turbobutts,3,Mon Jul 6 22:29:26 2015 UTC,It would be better if aisha were actually pronounced the same as geisha.  Fun fact: The Aisha was named after this incredibly strange song(NSFW)
neopets,3cc7wc,xtwistedxlovex,2,Mon Jul 6 22:13:05 2015 UTC,lolol. I had a friend named Aisha when I first was on neopets so in no way is that how I've been pronouncing Aisha the last 15 years.  Oops.  will continue to pronounce Aisha like geisha
neopets,3cc7wc,Bebeness,0,Tue Jul 7 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"A little late for a Memoirs of a Geisha reference, but back in the TNT era we got painfully outdated references too.   Does anyone wonder who the Aisha in the book is? Maybe the Guardian of Shenkuu? What did she do in her past?  EDIT: Neat, the item is activated now and you can read the description to get a little more insight into the story.    Is the Aishas love for Barman a lost cause?    Did anyone read/watch Memoirs of a Geisha? I don't plan on reading it or watching it, so can someone tell me if the geisha in question falls in love with a barman and this is all part of the reference?   If not, or even if so, I find myself genuinely interested in the story of this Aisha and her attraction to this barman. There's a few books in Neopia I've found that make me wanna hear more about the story, and this is one of them. I didn't think Jumpstaff had it in them to come up with something like this, gotta hand it to them. They still keep making rookie mistakes and amateur quality art and confusing decisions and don't appear to know what they're doing half the time, but this book here is, for the most part, a nice departure from that. I'm pretty sure that Aisha is ganked from a pre-existing image like the recent Cloud Xweetok Plushie, but other than that I like this item."
neopets,3cc7wc,Superkouza,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:27:28 2015 UTC,Memoirs of a Geisha is basically a about a woman who was sold by her family as a child to be trained as a geisha. The book is controversial in that it covers the prostitution aspect (such as selling the virginity of teenage girls to the highest bidder)
neopets,3cc7wc,Superkouza,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"I heard about that part, but what about the barman? Was there a barman? Was there not a barman and the barman is unique to the Aisha's story?   I wonder now, was this barman a john she fell in love with? Ah, speculation and headcanons..."
neopets,3cc7wc,hitomi614,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I read the book, but she does fall in love with this gentlemanly character who's beyond her reach cause she can't choose clients; the clients choose her.  Spoiler: They end up together."
neopets,3cc7wc,Superkouza,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:01:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, so maybe this Barman is a reference to the gentleman? I dunno, I'd have to ask the Editorial or something."
neopets,3cc7wc,awry_lynx,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:32:50 2015 UTC,Haha perfect. Aishas even sound vaguely like 'asia'
neopets,3cc7wc,awry_lynx,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"I know, and geishas are Japanese which is part of Asia. Sorry, my train of thought sort of goes everywhere."

neopets,3ccugu,CountBasil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:50:48 2015 UTC,The place just reeks with desperation and lenders act like they're all important and making people jump through hoops for them. I don't feel like hanging around and sucking up to the lenders because I know as soon as I get the avatars I would never go back there again. xD
neopets,3ccugu,CountBasil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't have to at all! I just made a board for suap, and then got messages for msp and suap within a few minutes. And while I did send a longer message to the person in my guild, it was only because another guild member directed me their way. They had done a guild lend previously so I tested my luck and messaged them, they were willing because I offered partial collat and was in the guild :)"
neopets,3ccugu,goofyspouse,2,Mon Jul 6 23:02:10 2015 UTC,"I'm weird though, I really hate asking people to do things for me but am more than happy to do things for people...I've never made my own board asking for the lend but just go on boards where someone is lending. Maybe I should try my luck. May I ask how much collat you put up for BGC if you don't mind?"
neopets,3ccugu,goofyspouse,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:05:29 2015 UTC,"It wasn't even much at all, did a trade on TP so did 2mil in pure and then I have a bunch of birthday petpets/snowbunny/disco schnelly from my gallery and a moach p3. So maybe around 4/4.5mil total. I just put up the stuff on my account that was worth the most basically  I hate it too, was so scared to ask for bgc when I'd never talked to them before. For once being in a guild for almost a year paid off, made them trust me more especially since they really trusted the person who had sent me over in the first place"
neopets,3ccugu,zsense,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:09:56 2015 UTC,Wow you must be in a really big guild. xD  I don't really have anything too valuable besides the nps I'm hoarding and I don't want to take Snowbunny off my pet (aging it so I can lend to my guildies). But thanks for the encouragement. :)
neopets,3ccugu,zsense,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"I guess it was still a pretty small amount compared to how much it was worth but as long as you can offer something even if only a few mil np then it definitely gets taken into consideration :)  Haha it is actually pretty big, it's a harry potter guild lol. I don't post all that often but there's weekly little HP trivia things that gets you 'house points' so it's pretty great since HP is my other obsession"

neopets,3ccugu,everythingshines,2,Mon Jul 6 22:39:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was expecting a summer-long battle honestly :o a little worried about dupes since it was through the boards but I made sure to screen shot receiving and re-sending everything so I think I should be okay. And it's been so long that there's been dupes crossing my fingers that they've got it sorted by now
neopets,3ccugu,ostentia,2,Mon Jul 6 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"crossing my fingers that they've got it sorted by now   Oh, a quick look at the volume of SuAPs on the Trading Post makes it quite clear that they do not...and that they have stopped trying.  Two of them on the TP are so obviously not legitimate it is almost laughable.  (Not that you probably have anything to worry about on the receiving end of a lend.)"
neopets,3ccugu,ostentia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:01:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured if there were dupes nothing was being done. I was lurking the boards a little bit first and a lot of people were saying they had been lent dupes and the person who lent it got frozen but they were fine so it got my confidence up a little bit more that I would be okay
neopets,3ccugu,ostentia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:05:40 2015 UTC,Congrats! How'd you pull that off? :P The big 3 are my last lendable avatars as well.
neopets,3ccugu,ostentia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:51:55 2015 UTC,I made sure I was past 250 avvies and finished every other pet/item lend first. And had a pea chia already on my main and ready. Then just made a board and got msp/suap really quick. Then a guild member saw my board and directed me to someone else who had done a lend of bgc recently so I messaged them and they were willing to do the lend :)

neopets,3cc4oc,vaynev,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:16:15 2015 UTC,i can sort of understand that but it's still so frustrating D:
neopets,3cc4oc,vaynev,4,Tue Jul 7 05:30:31 2015 UTC,"I do not care if people want UCs for UCs. It is their pets and they have every right to seek what they want.  The issue I have is when people say, ""TRADING UC FOR CONVERTED!"" when they want a common RW / RN or a high HSD BD. Trying to act like the trade is some big deal or something just because the pet happens to be converted."
neopets,3cc4oc,vaynev,3,Tue Jul 7 05:44:12 2015 UTC,man I totally understand that haha :P like as terrible as it is I'll probably only seek UCs of i ever trade up for one lol. It's still frustrating though haha
neopets,3cc4oc,vaynev,2,Mon Jul 6 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"Most people are like that. If you have a specific UC that you want, it is easier, and cheaper, to get it with another UC. Getting there with BD pets is way too expensive these days due to their deflation and it is laughable how hard it is to get any good offers with RW / RN pets.  What is the HSD of your BD pet?"
neopets,3cc4oc,vaynev,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:25:37 2015 UTC,it has 1808 HSD and still growing since I'm trying to even them out a bit. I'm also offering it with an unlimited custom :P
neopets,3cc4oc,Bebeness,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:31:21 2015 UTC,"That is definitely good enough for a decent UC. These days, I am seeing most people wanting 2k HSD for anything mid-tier. If you are not in a hurry, though, and want a high-tier UC, I would say wait until a potential plot. BD plot will bring up BD value."

neopets,3cc4oc,iSmirinoff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:57:05 2015 UTC,"The only way to train quicker is to get the training cookies. People put a lot of time and money into trading, both virtual and real. Ridiculous how much it has cost some people.  Not surprising. Everyone thinks BD pets are worthless these days, it seems. The unstable / deflating value is probably the biggest reason why it is harder to trade BD for UC right now."

neopets,3ccdzk,flosset,14,Mon Jul 6 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"Send a ticket anyway, you might get a response sooner than you know. My account was frozen about two weeks ago because I received stolen NC items from another user, and I was iced about half an hour or less after receiving the warning. I immediately logged into my side account and sent a ticket. Seriously, mere minutes later, Tony the D P. responded (I know, I'm surprised too). I took a break from Neo because I was so incredibly annoyed, but I finally responded to the ticket on Saturday night, and by Sunday morning, I realised from those 'Your pet is out of the Neolodge emails' that my account was unfrozen. I'm not sure about your case, but I think JST devotes a lot more attention to scamming/stealing/NP buying cases (hence the quick response), whereas a friend of mine who got iced for supposedly using bots (held down F5 for an avatar, which is against the rules) didn't get a response for a good long time. She had to bug JST constantly through Facebook on the daily until they finally sent her a response. I totally understand appreciating the site more as an adult. I didn't get much of what NP was about as a kid, and every goal seemed like it was going to take a good long time. I only came back to NP this March, and I finally actually understand how to use the site, how to make NP, and that there are actually decent people in the community (hated the Boards with the fire of suns going supernova). I put in so much more effort getting avatars, making NP, buying weapons, etc. So it's definitely more of a blow to have your account iced now. Send in that ticket, and good luck getting a speedy response."
neopets,3ccdzk,Vengerai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:38:27 2015 UTC,Did your friend get unfrozen too?
neopets,3ccdzk,Vengerai,2,Mon Jul 6 20:41:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no. My friend never did get unfrozen - they insisted that she had used bots and logged in from multiple IP addresses, so she gave up and moved her business to another site."
neopets,3ccdzk,iSmirinoff,2,Mon Jul 6 20:42:11 2015 UTC,"I'm happy for you that you got unfrozen but yours is an extremely rare case.

I even forgot my birthday cause I was frozen when I was 11;) not 13...like you had to be to talk to people   Regardless, I was so young I gave up and cried and cried. Years later I wrote the ticket and was unfrozen in...a month? Less? Memory is foggy but it worked! One account was purged after being frozen, oh well."

neopets,3ccdzk,CountBasil,10,Mon Jul 6 23:49:22 2015 UTC,So Tony P. just responded to my ticket saying that I was found to purchase a pet.  Apparently I need to prove to him that I didn't purchase the pet by giving him the Paypal e-mail address of the person I allegedly purchased the pet from and all of my Paypal transaction history.  I don't have that info and I don't see how showing him the rest of my Paypal transactions is going to do anything.  This is why you don't do pet trading.  People love to report you for shit they're jealous of.
neopets,3ccdzk,Im5andwhatisthis,5,Mon Jul 6 21:28:37 2015 UTC,This is ridiculous.  He was also the one who handled my ticket and he is completely useless.  Where are you gonna come up with the email address if you didn't even purchase the pet to begin with? Common sense is out the window.

neopets,3ccdzk,Im5andwhatisthis,4,Mon Jul 6 21:49:33 2015 UTC,Maybe just give him a page or twos worth of Paypal transaction screenshots to prove you didn't purchase a pet.
neopets,3ccdzk,CountBasil,3,Tue Jul 7 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"""all of my Paypal transaction history""  Wow that is so sketchy, I'm sorry Tony are you a bank? Do you have a warrant for that? Just cements the idea that Tony P is a huge douche on a power trip. Plus screenshots are easily faked so I dunno what he's trying to accomplish. Best of luck to you though :("
neopets,3ccdzk,Noeunoeuf,0,Tue Jul 7 03:08:38 2015 UTC,Yeah...people on the boards can get really paranoid. Last time I was on the avatar chat and this person was trying to sell their MSPP. People just randomly started calling them out and saying that their MSPP might be a dupe. >.>
neopets,3ccdzk,bunnyer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:07:19 2015 UTC,"There were only a couple that were around before the duping, so most of the time, it's true. If it wasn't a duped one, they have the history of that item (which should be easily traceable/verifiable by other players, everyone knew who had MSPP back then) back to before the duping.  One issue I have with TNT's stance on dupes/tickets to legitimize though. I know for a fact that there were 4 max SuAPs available for trade before duping, and since then 2 sellers just didn't bother and hiatused. So the fact remains, if TNT is gonna legitimize items, they should just point out the two SuAP's, say ""these are the legit ones"", and all the calling out shit would stop right then. So easy.  TNT still incompetent for the most part though, not arguing that."

neopets,3cb1m1,starpiece,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The last one I need now for my set is a birthday babaa, but that one eludes me. >.< I could just buy it, but that takes the fun out of it, haha."
neopets,3cb1m1,everythingshines,2,Mon Jul 6 15:24:54 2015 UTC,I'm missing the babaa and meepit. I RS all my bags from the toy store but I have been SO slack on RSing lately I'm thinking about just buying the last 2 pps. I actually got the babaa from the first bag I ever opened but traded it for the ukali for my old draik. And I've since got another ukali (now in gallery) but no more babaa :/

I plan on morphing her into another baby though :/ BUT WHICH ONE???!!!    I'm stuck between usul, kau, acara, lupe, gelert, kau, ..... Wait... a shorter list would be the pets that I'm not considering lol. Which is a baby Gnorbu or Chomby. (Because I already have those pets lol xD ) At this rate, I'll be running a baby nursery soon enough -_-"""

neopets,3cddfn,mecksee,2,Tue Jul 7 01:07:00 2015 UTC,These are adorable but i have no idea where to put them. They don't really fit the aesthetic of pet lookups and they're kind of small for buttons. So damn cute though. How do other people use them?
neopets,3cddfn,awry_lynx,3,Tue Jul 7 01:09:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. I found them via someone's affiliates; would probably look cute if someone had one for each pet on a userlookup or something together?  I randomly added it to one of my pets lookups because it was adorable and I needed it XD Bahahaha http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Zonked
neopets,3cbgqq,starpiece,4,Mon Jul 6 16:41:59 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing happened to me recently when I adopted a skeith for the avatar. What's worse, I ended up drawing this and writing up a tiny paragraph. The good news is the art and story helped her get adopted by someone on the boards. The bad news is I kind of regretted giving her away afterward.  A couple days later I opened up a new side account and adopted another awesomely-named skeith.  Learn from my mistakes! Embrace the sentimentality - that's what Neopets are for! But if you really don't have the room, I'm sure someone will be willing to take her. How are your art skills? ;)"
neopets,3cbgqq,kolidescope,3,Mon Jul 6 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"That art is so cute! No wonder she got adopted quick haha. My penciil to paper art is decent but I've never dabbled in digital art, no idea where to begin. I'm also bad at being creative with it like making different poses if I don't have a reference to look at.   Either way I hope she ends up somewhere nice. I always go on lost quiggle to find avatar pets and pick a semi decently named one even if they do just get dropped back into the pound. But her name stuck out to me a lot and when I threw random stuff from my closet on her it just made me die <3"
neopets,3cbgqq,E6E6FA,3,Mon Jul 6 17:13:51 2015 UTC,You should definitely keep her.
neopets,3cbgqq,E6E6FA,5,Mon Jul 6 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"I know right, I don't even like grarrls but she's just so cute it's melting my heart lol. I think the item 'lil miss grarrl' got to me more than I thought. Plus her name is just perfect. I may keep her as a labbie but I'll have to get rid of a pet to make room :("
neopets,3cbgqq,ssmeoow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:49:15 2015 UTC,Oh no! Are all your sides filled up?
neopets,3cbgqq,ssmeoow,2,Mon Jul 6 17:04:40 2015 UTC,Across all accounts right now I have one empty space. My plan was to have 18 pets and 2 lab rats- one for each lab account so I guess she could stay as a labbie for now. I also have one pet that isn't made yet (a lutari) so now I have to really consider if I should morph Dollyz into one (perfect baby name) or reconsider it altogether. I had a really cute untaken name picked out though so we'll see. Maybe I can zap her into something good and adopt out but for now she can stay :P I get attached to pets way too quickly
neopets,3cbgqq,ssmeoow,2,Mon Jul 6 17:09:08 2015 UTC,Grarrls are the best! pokes Tagos

neopets,3cbgqq,eille_k,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:56:42 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yes faerie is adorable! I love it because its so bright and colorful! Dollyz is such a cute name too!!! Totally matching with lil miss grarrl!

neopets,3cbsce,Fleecie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:54:25 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, hiding pet stats are fine. Hiding userlookup stats will get your UL coding wiped, though. There are several premades sites that offer options that hide the pet stats, so I think it's okay :)"
neopets,3cbsce,KittyAnxiety,2,Mon Jul 6 19:16:16 2015 UTC,Oh awesome!! I'll definitely be using them then! Whenever I get around to spending the whole day messing around with. It always takes me sooo long to get it just right
neopets,3cbsce,anxioususul,2,Mon Jul 6 19:24:52 2015 UTC,Yeah;  Usually if theres a way to see it (on click/hover) it's fine. I've been hiding my trophies for years (which isn't allowed) because they're ugly lol.   But you can see them if you hover over where they should be c: Have yet to have a problem!
neopets,3cbsce,Garettesky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"Good to know! I've never had an issue hiding mine completely, but I'll make them visible on hover just to be safe. :)"
neopets,3cbsce,floppy_catfish,2,Mon Jul 6 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"I was just commenting based on userlookup, I know some people get whiny over collections but I also hide half of those without problem. XP  A ton of people hide pet lookup stats and theres never an issue, so doubt you guys will have any?"
neopets,3cbsce,aveforever,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"Ooh, yeah. I used to hide my collections/etc on some lookups but someone kept reporting me to get my userlookup wiped. /grumble"
neopets,3cbsce,daringfeline,2,Mon Jul 6 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, looks like someone is a little jelly of you and your awesome lookup! Hahahah  I have my fair share of haters so I never hide collections fully. I can guarantee that trophies though as long as they scroll/hover are totally fine."
neopets,3cbsce,MizzTiff,2,Mon Jul 6 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"I personally don't have a problem with hidden stats but staff have said in the past that pet stats cannot be covered. NT 230, NT 249"
neopets,3cbsce,chelseanina,2,Mon Jul 6 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"I LOVE your userlookup coding! It's so crisp, the best I've seen of the type that displays so many pets! Makes me want to change mine, hmmm."
neopets,3cawag,Lyongirl,42,Mon Jul 6 13:59:48 2015 UTC,They should really do some surveys and such to figure out where their primary demographic currently is. I will say I would be surprised if the average age wasn't 20+.
neopets,3cawag,poundsurfer,17,Mon Jul 6 14:10:09 2015 UTC,I agree.  It would be wonderful if they figured out what their active member base would like from the site.  I understand moderation of the message boards so that if there are kids they aren't being exposed to inappropriate messages (like the other week lol) but I just wished they tried to appeal to a larger audience.
neopets,3cawag,aguamentifelicis,10,Mon Jul 6 14:12:57 2015 UTC,"I always wished this myself. I been around not as long as you, but I been around since late 2000 on the site. I think on the board there might still be a fair number of those under 18, so yes moderators are needed to control the possible inappropriate messages. However, the older population is growing more frustrated it seems.   Side note - I usually avoid the boards any way, and onyl use guilds. I just wish there was a way guilds could have different groupings, one for kids/ all, and one for adult only with fewer filters. Never going to happen, but it is a wish"
neopets,3cawag,poundsurfer,8,Mon Jul 6 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"There is a very easy way it can happen. You already have to have the user's age on the account. Simply make a checkmark in the guild settings for 18+. If checked one cannot access the guild boards unless your account age is 18+.   This could also easily be done with select neoboards as well (in fact, it wouldn't be hard to not have them show up at all for those under 18, so they would be less likely to try to circumvent the age restriction)."
neopets,3cawag,aguamentifelicis,5,Mon Jul 6 17:18:48 2015 UTC,Now can we get the Neopets Team to figure this out? Or at least respond to why it would not work?
neopets,3cawag,poundsurfer,5,Mon Jul 6 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"It is not that it wouldn't work (it would probably take some code refactoring though). It is that at one point they decided to primarily market it to parents as a safe place for children, and at least for the moment, don't want to change that."
neopets,3cawag,everythingshines,3,Mon Jul 6 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why they don't want to market to their actual userbase, which I believe is mostly 18+."
neopets,3cawag,aguamentifelicis,2,Mon Jul 6 20:01:25 2015 UTC,True that might be where their minds are to.
neopets,3cawag,Im5andwhatisthis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"Private guilds aren't really moderated much at all. I've never seen a post been removed from ours, and I myself have said plenty of stuff there that wouldn't make it an hour on the normal boards."
neopets,3cawag,envirosue,5,Tue Jul 7 00:46:11 2015 UTC,"I never post on the boards either for that same reason.  I only talk to people through pm.  On that same thought process, Neopets always required you to be at least 13 to view the message boards and talk to people anyways.  This means that any form of communication should be PG-13.  The way they have it set right now appears as if they want it G rated, which is just insane."
neopets,3cawag,pollka,3,Mon Jul 6 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic idea.  Honestly, things like this are the reason I haven't bought premium.  I would love the benefits, but if I'm going to spend real money then the site needs to run like a real gamers site. And it just doesn't.  I have so much pride in the things and nps I've collected but if someone hacked into my account, it would be gone and TNT wouldn't give a damn.  Loyalty needs to work both ways."
neopets,3cawag,mahoushoujo,3,Mon Jul 6 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"I used to be a premium member and they lost my money a long time ago.  I've also completely stopped buying NC and I used to purchase a fair amount.  Unless they make major changes, I think they are losing more customers than they are gaining at this point in time."
neopets,3cawag,Stratager,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:55 2015 UTC,I just recently decided to stop spending money on their site too. Their payment system is still not working for me despite trying on 3 of my accounts and now my premium isn't working on my main. I am beyond done with giving money to a game site that shows no intentions of improving for even the users who choose to pay to play. I'm glad I'm not the only one who has been feeling increasingly upset with the site. I'm happy that most people of this sub are willing to admit the flaws the game they love has.
neopets,3cawag,poundsurfer,18,Mon Jul 6 23:15:44 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand it. Its not 1999 anymore. WHY are they so resistant to listen to their userbase??? There have been countless examples of companies failing because they refuse to listen. TNT could easily fix sooooo many issues and its like they just stick their head in the sand and refuse to even acknowledge us. I just.... why?! Who is making these decisions? Are they trying to kill the site? WHY?!   Even minor things like allowing us to talk about grapes would be greatly appreciated. With some work they could establish a whole new userbase and bring back even more old users. But nope, they just say ""Fuck you players! Now please buy this shitty NC item to activate all the junk we're going to dump in your inventory to pressure you into a purchase."""
neopets,3cawag,mecksee,6,Mon Jul 6 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  To silence me because I mention an off Neopets site (not even link) is mind boggling to me.  Even if I was talking to a child, I'm pretty sure they know sites beyond Neopets exist.  It's like TNT does not have any rational thoughts."
neopets,3cawag,Garettesky,16,Mon Jul 6 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"""a new pet of her choice"".    top kek  Like fucking really. They realize and accept that her account is compromised, but can't fucking revert the damage? Like holy shit what kind of level of stupidity is that."
neopets,3cawag,goofyspouse,13,Mon Jul 6 14:48:18 2015 UTC,Exactly.  I mean it stinks overall because it looks like the person who has her UC plushie draik traded fairly for him and has already done TONS of artwork..but they should still be able to do something.
neopets,3cawag,Garettesky,26,Mon Jul 6 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"Like give your friend her pet back, and then offer the person who traded for it a pet of their choice."
neopets,3cawag,ChickenDerby,7,Mon Jul 6 15:10:38 2015 UTC,^ Agree. Wtf TNT.
neopets,3cawag,Garettesky,9,Mon Jul 6 16:18:43 2015 UTC,I've reported several tickets that ended up being manually closed by myself. Because they don't seem to read any of those but are too active at updating NC Mall.  I miss how instantly the old neo replies to even the simplest inquiries.  And now this. Neopets is slowly going downhill.
neopets,3cawag,kolidescope,11,Mon Jul 6 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"I miss how instantly the old neo replies to even the simplest inquiries.   Are you sure you aren't romanticizing the ""good old days"" a little here?  While it has gotten worse in recent years, I don't recall there ever being a day where you could expect anything besides canned responses to your questions or requests for help.  Unless you had made friends with a mod and communicated directly via email, support requests just went out into the ether and you had no way of knowing whether or not TNT even received it.  That, or we just have had vastly different experiences.  :-D"
neopets,3cawag,Superkouza,5,Mon Jul 6 15:56:20 2015 UTC,I've always had fairly fast responses with tickets I've sent in.  I haven't sent one in since maybe 3 years ago but iirc they only took about a week to respond with a real person.
neopets,3cawag,Superkouza,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:26:42 2015 UTC,But they do reply asap back in the days. They also warn you as soon as you posted something that wasn't supposed to be posted. It doesn't even take an hour at most.
neopets,3cawag,poundsurfer,9,Mon Jul 6 22:44:23 2015 UTC,One time I sent them just a message to say how great they were doing and how much I loved the site.  They took the time to write a personalized thank you.  I don't imagine they would do that anymore :(.
neopets,3cawag,squeekybird,9,Mon Jul 6 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"but are too active at updating NC Mall.   Honestly they suck at that, too. It's now the sixth and we still don't have a new collectible."
neopets,3cawag,squeekybird,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"because it's a holiday, I believe. NC mall's the only thing that's being updated way too much. As for the other site features, they never bothered touching those."
neopets,3cawag,squeekybird,8,Mon Jul 6 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"The fact that hacking occurs with any frequency on Neopets anymore even with the playerbase having aged a decade makes me sad for humanity. Like, really? You're an adult now and this is how you've decided to spend your time?  But yeah, it's frustrating. :( I feel bad for Jumpstart. They don't seem like they're doing well at all financially. And without money, they can't hire enough skilled staff, which causes problems in the site which results in less players which results in less money.. Now it seems they're just floundering. Still no excuse for poor customer service, but I can see how the stress could affect their organizational structure.  Recently I was reading Donna's AMA she (and Adam) did last year. It seems like unwise/unlucky business decisions has been Neopets' curse since the beginning. :/  On another note, hey Coolgirl! I've heard of you! You've got the oldest active account on the site, right?"
neopets,3cawag,Fightmyfeelings,6,Mon Jul 6 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"I know Neopets has never been much of a huge money maker.  It has always had the potential, and I know personally when I was younger I used to buy the merchandise.  I even had the board game (which was so much fun).  If they could just get a company that knew how to market what they have, I still feel like they have the ability to be successful.    Also, hello!  That's me.  I started playing 2 days after the site was open to the public.  Sadly, I was also hacked about 3 years back (when I referred to the last ticket I sent in) but Neopets was very helpful in getting it back for me.  I think my pin protection was the only thing keeping them from stealing my pets.  They just used my account to steal items from other people :/."
neopets,3cawag,elsani,5,Mon Jul 6 19:04:02 2015 UTC,"crosses self Neopian royalty as I live and breath in waking moments. :o If there was any Neopian who deserved an AMA like Adam and Donna got, it's you. Do you ever have hope for a better Neopia or are you halfway out the door right now?"
neopets,3cawag,xPhoenix777,6,Mon Jul 6 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"This game has been so much a part of my life that I have to hold on to hope.  Even with how bad I perceive everything being right now, I just want another company to get ahold of Neopets and revive it to its former glory."
neopets,3cawag,LascielCoin,4,Mon Jul 6 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"Okeedoke, so what kind of stuff do you hope/dream of seeing on Neopets content-wise? If anything?"
neopets,3cawag,LascielCoin,6,Mon Jul 6 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"I just want them to create more puzzle intense plots.  The best memories I had on the site was when a bunch of people were on the forums trying to figure out an incredibly hard step in the current event.  We had to work together and built a community instead of every man for himself.  I'd also like to see them create more fun games that I wouldn't even mind if they had in game purchases in.  Petpet park was an interesting idea and they fact that you could play for free but pay for more areas would certainly gain them more income. If they could somehow combine the idea of Petpet park (an MMO) in a style that would be interesting to the current demographic, I'd be all over that.  Of course, I'm also a huge gamer so...that might be why I'd like that ;)."
neopets,3cawag,chillmorebeersnow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"I remember working together, trying to save mystery island from doom. That plot was intense (maybe that is my young age at the time talking)."
neopets,3cawag,ran0ma,9,Mon Jul 6 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your friend. I just want to point out something though- the site was NOT originally created for college students. Donna addressed it in her AMA a year ago. She said ""it wasnt designed with any demographic in mind, it was just whetever Adam and I thought was fun."" (Not that I think the harshness of the filters is a good thing, like not saying grape for example)."
neopets,3cawag,ChelseaTheSupreme,5,Mon Jul 6 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"Be that as it may, the original site had chat windows without any filters and humor geared towards and older crowd.  The intended audience may have been more broad but it was certainly built as if an older crowd would gain more interest.  They also had games like Bingo and pictures of monsters eating pikachu.  Just my opinion, but not incredibly child friendly."
neopets,3cawag,Iryojunn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"True, but something doesn't have to be void of 'adult humor' to be child friendly. There still are items that are a little gruesome, like blumaroo steak. The description is ""What goes bounce...bounce...whirr... splat?"". I think things like that, and what you mentioned, can be child friendly, as long as we're not talking about 4 and under or something like that. Kind of like the difference between Nickelodeon and Nick Jr.... Neopets used to be more like Nickelodeon (Rocko's Modern Life, Hey Arnold, etc), but now it's child-friendly level is more like Nick Jr.  Can I ask how you first came across Neopets? It must've been really small at that time."
neopets,3cawag,Iryojunn,2,Mon Jul 6 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely and I'm not suggesting they gear it towards adults now.  I think they just need to reevaluate their target audience.  They aren't attracting young children and they already have a fanbase that's slowly dwindling because they are treating them like young children.  If they could implement ways for adults to still talk like adults, I think they would cure a lot of frustration.    I found Neopets on Yahoo when I was looking for ""virtual pets"" sites.  I used to play the PC games Dogz and Catz and I wanted more.  There was barely anyone on there.  I even talked to Adam once in a chat window that was in a shop while I was waiting for a restock.  I had no idea who he was even though he kept asking me how I liked the site..lol.  I actually had him on my nf list for a while but then I never talked to him so I deleted him."
neopets,3cawag,Iryojunn,2,Mon Jul 6 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"Right, and especially with all the NC stuff. They seriously can't think that it's young children buying NC, or parents buying that much NC for their kids. A lot of the customizations I've seen while cruising the site seem like an adult or at least teen made them. Children can't coordinate outfits as well, haha."
neopets,3cawag,pollka,4,Mon Jul 6 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"I hate seeing the site fall apart. I've been on here for 14 years, I've seen the site go through tons of changes. I've made really good friends on there that I'm still in contact with off neo... and some friends that came and went.   It legit makes me a little sad to see the site where it is now. Sometimes I debate whether I should quit like a lot of people are doing... or stick it out to the bitter end."
neopets,3cawag,Fandabbidosy,3,Mon Jul 6 19:06:57 2015 UTC,"I've been a member for 10 years and every time I check up on my account, I just find more and more BS on the site.. it's sad to admit this, but the site isn't what it was all those years ago.  I knew that the site was going to shit once it changed the art... they just never listen."
neopets,3cawag,flosset,3,Mon Jul 6 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"I just got frozen for no reason... now my pretty pets and millions are lost in cyber-space. JS won't do ANYTHING for me, if they did little for her.    At least I don't have to make the decision to delete my account now?"

neopets,3cdzyb,maria1593,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:52:45 2015 UTC,It's really strange and actually kind of annoying. You would think that the NP playerbase is large enough for them to allow for world wide purchases.
neopets,3cdzyb,Ro-Dent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:53:46 2015 UTC,Are there nc only petpets? And walls?
neopets,3cdzyb,Ro-Dent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:45:44 2015 UTC,"Not petpets, but the headlamp thing that allows you to get a NC exclusive item when you do grave danger. As for the walls, I am pretty sure they are still there, and are the only way to create rooms within the neohome (you have to buy them individually though)"
neopets,3cdzyb,Shokuji,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:54:37 2015 UTC,Thank you! :)

neopets,3cbd2d,lovability,3,Mon Jul 6 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I guess I'm feeling a bit down because of the reddit drama of late. I have tried a couple of other sites a long time ago, but haven't found anything up to the quality of what Neopets brings. I'll check out Leopets if only to give me another place to waste my time."
neopets,3cbd2d,arttimo,3,Mon Jul 6 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"Can confirm: Leopets is awesome. Small, but has that vintage feel."
neopets,3cbd2d,arttimo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:25:29 2015 UTC,But you can only apply for membership on the first of the month.    ARGH.
neopets,3cbd2d,lovability,2,Mon Jul 6 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yup. And not everyone gets chosen, either. They want to make sure the people who join are serious about joining... they want to make sure people are going to play so no server space is wasted with inactive accounts.  I'm not as active as I should be, but I can't do any digital art right now and that's what I want to do there."
neopets,3cbd2d,frogbot123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:10:48 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense.  It seems as if they've actually put some thought into their site.
neopets,3cbd2d,squeekybird,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:19:17 2015 UTC,"I know lols, I found myself constantly worrying about the fate of Neopets but it's not worth it to stress out about it! I love Neo as much as the next person, but I'm also trying not to get my hopes up about it, either. It's had a nice lifespan, about 20 years! And I treasure all the memories I've had :)"

We can all start shouting when we're off the mountain altogether.  In the meantime, cheer up!!  We're here, you're here and with or without changes things are still chuggaluggin along one way or another :D  And if wores comes to worse... it will be okay.

neopets,3cbd2d,MellyGirl123,3,Mon Jul 6 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"I like your attitude! It makes you wonder, what is the facebook to neopet's myspace? Like what site should we all be joining so that 10 years from now we can all say ""I've been on this site since the beginning, I don't like the way it is currently being run""? I used to love Jumpstart games when I was a little kid. So maybe it's just my sentimentality, but I want to give JS more of a chance running this site. Also, I've never purchased any NC or premium and I have no plans on doing so, so the site seems somewhat ok to me!"
neopets,3cbd2d,LascielCoin,3,Mon Jul 6 19:16:09 2015 UTC,"I always wonder that!! I heard Adam and Donna were working on something that they then had to end b/c of new baby, money etc. but maybe they'll be working again in a few years.

neopets,3cbd2d,Yupa,8,Mon Jul 6 19:59:41 2015 UTC,I feel you. I'm scared neopets is going to close down before I accomplish my dream pets. That'd sure be a downer. I do have some naive hope that Jump Start just needs more time.

I am not going to quit.  I've attained most of my goals - minus the WN UC faerie Xwee, which I could probably get if I gave up my wn krawk battle pet (1656 hsd) but can't stand the PC boards enough to give it a shot.  And then I'd have to train another battle pet, of course.     Most days I'm pretty bored just playing games and occasionally chatting with my guild friends.     Yeah, I'd love a nice juicy plot to spice things up, but we don't want one when everything is already so messed up.     Our only option at this point is to wait and see what happens."

This person on Facebook seems rather pointless since they only 'pass the buck' rather than actually helping. They would probably be better suited to working on the support staff, which is in dire need of more staff.  They have a very 'customer support representative' type of response, but why are they wasted responding to FB when they can't actually do anything? Pointless."

neopets,3cc1k6,-cupcake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:40:51 2015 UTC,"I did exactly this, messaged them daily on FB until I finally got a response, which was similar to what you got.  I provided them with the information, and actually for a response back a few hours later.   This was a few months ago though, prior to all the TNT staff getting laid off, so I'm not sure if that will effect the response time."

Don't know if the response time will be good (I personally had to wait a total of 2 weeks before I got my account back, which seems quite good going by this sub's standards) but the lay-off didn't affect the support team."
neopets,3cc7rb,xPhoenix777,7,Mon Jul 6 19:52:25 2015 UTC,That's awful! Usually if you accidentally do it one time nothing happens bc they know people can make mistakes and they usually only freeze if you're doing it consistently. That's horrible and so sorry it happened to you :(

neopets,3ceo8w,PonderingPizza,7,Tue Jul 7 09:17:49 2015 UTC,"No, it's not dying. Apocalyptic predictions are just that, predictions. And believing that it's dying isn't going to help much either. I'm not optimistic that Neopets is going to have another golden age. I don't think Jumpstart is doing the best it could do in terms of customer service or artwork. But I don't go around crying about falling skies. What good would that do? I'm still enjoying the game (somewhat). Things have been fixed. Things have been broken. C'est la vie. I think we can give them more time and the benefit of the doubt. Welcome back to Neopets, hope your time here is fun and pleasant."
neopets,3ceo8w,Vengerai,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:01:39 2015 UTC,"Haha, fair enough. Well if you're an active user and have been playing  recently, do you see things start to be recovering or not?"
neopets,3ceo8w,Vengerai,5,Tue Jul 7 10:02:59 2015 UTC,"I've been on Neopets for ten years so far and played sporadically, took a hiatus, then came back this March. I'm now playing more intensively than ever before, making more NP and fully going into BD, plus collecting avatars and trophies. I find I can understand and use the site better as an adult than when I was a kid. I know some things were broken that were fixed, that I didn't see coming. I remember back when I was still pretty much fumbling around the site, Dice-A-Roo never worked for me. It works now. Of course, I don't really dabble much in the flash games and such so I can't speak well for that - although I think many are outdated and need a good update. I mostly Battledome, and there are some annoying broken things (DoN, some weapons in 1P), but I get by well enough. The economy has pretty much tanked and lots of expensive items are more affordable now, for better or worse. It's difficult to sell certain things, but I could also afford the Thyoras Tear and LEV that I couldn't bear to get in the past. Draiks are nearly dirt-cheap now and are no longer that much of a status symbol (which I find great). Good and bad. PC however has now been reduced to a bunch of rabid bloodhounds foaming at the mouth. Keep your UCs safe and your head down low. Duck if you see the spittle coming. The whole fiasco with the Neoboards was a bunch of silliness that JS has cleared up, and that should be the end of that. The sky didn't fall over it. Or, at least, it fell over the people whose accounts got iced because they felt a need to prove something by swearing or whatever. TL;DR: Not sure how well it's recovering, but it's still a playable site. I think if we want them to get better, boycotting and leaving is not the solution. Tony the D can still go smoke a dick though. Pray that your tickets don't go to him. I think the question is, what are you back on Neopets for?"

neopets,3ceo8w,Vengerai,2,Tue Jul 7 10:53:12 2015 UTC,"You phrased it perfectly :) It's much easier to get dream pets and items and build galleries, but they're pretty empty in the content bank.

Now, if they made it to where petpets could not be pounded or transferred while attached, and only sold, it would solve that problem, but at the cost of losing the ability to lend petpets to get the petpet avatars.   So what's left?  I can't really think of anything. If I had to choose, I think I'd still choose the first option, it'd be sweet to be able to have a gallery with hoagie kadoaties, but without a solution to the above, people would inevitably start trading pets with the intention of trading petpets as well :/"

neopets,3cclwf,xPhoenix777,2,Mon Jul 6 21:40:10 2015 UTC,They've said before in the Neopian Times (can't remember which issue) that they understand mistakes like that happen sometimes and they won't punish you as long as you don't transfer your winnings to your main.
neopets,3cclwf,flosset,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"I sent over a book, ~100np value, but I would think that is ok seeing that my main did no dailies... It's entirely my fault if that was the core problem."

It is nice to see someone accept ownership of an issue that they may have contributed to, but if this is the whole story, no, it is not entirely your fault.  This would be the TNT equivalent of a cop tagging you for jaywalking on a street blocked off for a parade while someone standing next to you is getting mugged.  Not only is the punishment not in line with the ""crime"", but there surely are other crimes in need of more urgent/immediate attention.  There are dozens (if not hundreds) of SuAP dupes out in the wild still...why would TNT hassle someone for accidentally doing their dailies on a side account?  Either TNT is bored as fuck at the moment as well as unwilling to focus on the problems they should be focusing on, or we are not getting the whole story here."

neopets,3caqg8,embercat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"It was a site event last December that people thought either was a ton of fun, or ruined the economy forever, or both.  The idea was to ""donate"" five toys to the Charity Corner (Toys for Tots analog) and receive a mystery item of similar rarity back for your ""kindness"".  Toy prices went through the roof, and most other items (including many r99s) completely tanked in price.  There was also a daily challenge to give specific items that caused all kinds of havoc with pricing of the items requested.  Good times, bad lag."
neopets,3caqg8,goofyspouse,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:32:55 2015 UTC,Yeah since returning I've noticed prices on a lot of items have plummeted. I guess that's one of the reasons why. Thanks for the explanation!

neopets,3cdnfd,yellowpron,2,Tue Jul 7 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"You'll need to pay games to at least get your first 50k NP. If you're fortunate to have an old account, food club can easily make you 500k a day.   Stocks if a good way to get np, but it takes a while for it to pay off, and it'll be a solid month of investing before you see any sign of return on np.   The best way to make money is to restock. If you're fast fingered, you can make a ton (a LOT)  by auction sniping the right items, or by sniping mispriced items in user shops.

neopets,3cdnfd,-cupcake,2,Tue Jul 7 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"You don't need an old account to play Food Club.

neopets,3cdnfd,Kaitokaiser,3,Tue Jul 7 03:03:35 2015 UTC,"It's a gambling game of probability. I have a super simplified explanation of what exactly the game even is on my page here: http://www.neopets.com/~FoodClubBets#info . Beyond that, Jawsnapper's guide (which I have linked on my page too) is much, much more in-depth - but learning all of that might seem too daunting or uninteresting to you.    If creating your own bets (in the near future... or ever) does not interest you, then I recommend you follow a bettor! On neopets, the current most popular bettors are Garet (/~Boochi_target) and Lefty (/~Innocent).... Oh, and obviously my page, of course ;)    On reddit, we have a daily Food Club thread that gets automatically posted at about 5 am NST everyday. From then on until the end of the round (so, 5 am NST to 2:30 pm NST) our users post and share their bets! You can essentially browse and shop for a bettor to follow, haha.     Personally, I started betting by following another redditor (/u/jessv12). Then I started to figure out her bets and I would edit them myself. Then eventually I started making them myself. You can see my win records on my page towards the beginning were pretty shaky but I like to think I've got the hang of it now. :)    If you have any more questions I and a ton of other users would be totally willing to help."

neopets,3cdnfd,Garettesky,2,Tue Jul 7 03:56:09 2015 UTC,"The older your account is, the more money you can bet"
neopets,3cdnfd,galacticpoison,2,Tue Jul 7 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"IMO, the younger your account is, there's waaay less risk of betting on FC. You're betting a lot lesser, but profit is always profit and if you bust, you lose a lot lesser. Compare losing 10k in a day to 50k, you can earn that back in approximately 3 games. And if you get something like 30:10, you earn 20k in a day's bet. c:    Like everyone else said, most people start by following others who post their bets here. Cupcake is one of them, so you could look out for that."

That's including the daily BD (1.5k), Solitaire/Cheat/Pyramids where I try to get 5k daily.    Employment Agency gives me up to 10k if I do all 5. Last but not least, Food Club, and selling duplicates/codestones/Neocola tokens/potions.

neopets,3cf030,Finnorw,15,Tue Jul 7 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"I would like to know where all these downer posts are coming from. What was the point of coming on here and posting this? If your assumptions about us holding onto our childhood obsessions are correct, why would you think we'd give them up over one user who's not enjoying the site at all anymore? A thousand users who don't enjoy the site cannot change the opinion of other users still obsessed with, and who still enjoy Neo. You don't tell us what to do, vice versa, and we won't stop you from leaving either. I'm not being rude here. If you think it's time to move on, do it. Trying to convince people here who are still fully engaged with the site and what it has to offer (albeit little) is pointless. Matter of opinion, yes? Of course JS would do their bare minimum to keep the site running. Users will fund them through the NC Mall and its events and activities. Could they do more? Probably. Could they fix more things? Hire more artists? Yes, but with its current small user base and limited income, probably JS is playing it cautious too. They wouldn't invest lots more in a site that's middling, but still has its fans and dedicated users. The heyday of Neopets is over. We get that, but we still play for different reasons. Not something as simple as, ""I loved this as a kid and relish feeling like a kid again."" Personally, I won't say Neopets was a big part of my childhood. I still view it as more of a young adult or adult game. I think few children would understand the workings of Plushie Tycoon, play the stock market or make their own FC bets. I doubt kids would have the financial capability to engage fully in NC trading and customisation. So no. No childhood obsession on my part. I do trade NC, play Food Club and chat with adult users, and I enjoy it as an adult would - through interaction with other people who have the financial capability and maturity to play the game as I do. You've had a good run on Neopets. You should leave if it upsets you so greatly. You're presumably an adult too. There are other attractions and responsibilities in life that have your attention more now, surely. Just telling it like it is. Fuck downvotes, as you said. I wouldn't downvote you for your opinions, but that's the keyword here: opinions. Everyone's got one."
neopets,3cf030,DamaskAndSilk,-3,Tue Jul 7 12:19:21 2015 UTC,"What was the point of coming on here and posting this?   I was trying to spark a conversation. I'm not telling anybody what to do, I just want to know if anyone feels the same way. Hence why the title of this post was a question.  Not every action in the world is meant to get other people to do something. Sometimes I just like to share my opinions and relate with other people. By your logic, what was your purpose on coming on this thread and telling me how pointless it was?   Like I said, childhood memories are something dear to me. Therefore, I like to discuss it with other people. If you disagree, that's fine, but don't interpret it as me trying to boss you around.  And one last thing:   Trying to convince people here who are still fully engaged with the site and what it has to offer (albeit little) is pointless.   If you look around this sub, I think you will easily find that most people here are not fully engaged. I can't speak for everybody here, and I'm sure some still are, but many of the people I've met, both here and on Neo, are losing interest quickly."
neopets,3cf030,Vengerai,7,Tue Jul 7 12:25:59 2015 UTC,"You did assume I'm not leaving the site because of nostalgia :P I mentioned in another post that I only returned to playing Neopets proper this March, and I like it a lot more than when I was playing it as a kid. I was so fucking clueless in the past that I wasn't even aware we had the Altador Cup and all those plots! I let them fly past me like a complete doofus and am regretting that now. Idk, I feel as if the site now has more to offer me as an adult who's less clueless now, but yeah, I won't challenge that the site isn't ageing gracefully and I wouldn't blame anyone for wanting to stop playing for good. I honestly thought of just packing my shit up and leaving when I got iced, but the site still has things for me to do on it and I blew real cash money on NC, so... I think I'll stick around for awhile. If you wanna leave Neo that's fine, RL has a lot more things to offer and way more pressing challenges ;)"
neopets,3cf030,DamaskAndSilk,2,Tue Jul 7 12:41:58 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I interpreted it as you trying to convince others that the site is sinking, my bad if that was not your intention. There have been many posts about how Neopets is a sinking ship these days, and I'm curious as to why people would do so instead of leaving. There are too many ""the end of Neopets is coming"" posts. Everybody has their complaints, but most people here, despite their bellyaching, will also still complain about wanting to pay for Premium and not getting it, and not being able to actually get NC. Still, your opinion has been shared. If you want to vacate your account because the site no longer has anything to offer you, you should go ahead and do it."
neopets,3cf030,ostentia,4,Tue Jul 7 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"I, too, am getting tired of all ""I JUST GET BACK FROM HIATUS. WOW, THIS SITE SUX NOW"" posts. Even if I'm starting to feel the same way. This post was sort of meant to be a possible response to those who feel that way, myself included.  As for vacating my account, I'm still giving Jumpstart maybe just a bit more time to sort themselves out, but as I said, I'm not very hopeful."
neopets,3cf030,Paxtato,16,Tue Jul 7 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"I'm getting kind of sick of seeing these ""Neopets is dying everything is awful"" posts tbh. I'm having more fun now than I did as a kid."
neopets,3cf030,ostentia,7,Tue Jul 7 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I don't think it rings true for some of us.    When I was a kid, Neopets bored me to death. The only time I ever got on the site was when I had the urge to play ""Trouble at the National Neopian"" or some other flash game. I have no happy memories from its heyday, because I couldn't have cared less about it. (Not to mention I had abysmal internet)   Flash forward to today, and it's easily where I spend most of my time when I'm online. I revisited the site about two years ago after talking to my friend about a flash game we used to play, and was hooked. I also recently got my 17 year old sister (who has never played it before) really into it. Her account will probably be better than mine soon if she keeps at it!    I get your point, but I also think that Neopets has decent potential, even today. Is JS fucking up the site? Yeah. If they don't get the hang of things soon then I think the future of Neopets is questionable. But I'll be around until the very end because I'm still having a great time and I'm spending it with some incredible people. This is (maybe unfortunately) the only Neopets I've really known, and though it may seem really shitty to you I'm having a blast. :)"
neopets,3cf030,mecksee,4,Tue Jul 7 14:43:03 2015 UTC,"Jeez, I feel like I could've typed that post myself. I feel exactly the same way. I have only a few memories of neopets as a kid, and most of them involve being frustrated: I couldn't play the games, I couldn't go on the boards because I was too young, I never managed to save any NP or achieve any of my dream pets, I was too awkward and weird to make friends in guilds, etc. Consequently, I didn't last long on the website. I never got what I wanted and I wasn't having any fun trying, so I quit.  Now that I'm old enough to actually do well in the game, I'm having fun, and I'm hooked. I don't even remember the days when neopets was ""better""; I remember the days when I kind of hated neopets because I sucked at it."

neopets,3cf030,honeydot,2,Tue Jul 7 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"I actually just got into the site a year ago. I played for a very short time as a kid, but I got really confused at things like user shops and what to do other than feeding and grooming your pets.  I went back on to see if the site was still actually running a year ago, made an account for fun, and here I am. I had no idea how big the site actually was, and even though it's obvious that the site isn't what it used to be, I love the community (mainly this sub)."

neopets,3cb33c,negotiate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, I hope your first foray into full-time employment goes well. Here's to exciting new things! :) I haven't been doing much this summer, really - I've just started devoting my full attention to Duolingo (the language-learning app) to keep my Italian skills somewhat operable during the summer vacation. I juggled learning three languages the past semester with varying degrees of success, and I find Duolingo to not be really effective as a proper language-learning tool, but it's fun and offers bite-sized pieces you can pick up whenever you've got a spare moment :) It's really warm right now (although I live in a pretty warm region), so I really just like lying on the floor with the fan on at full blast, clutching a glass of chilled wine in my hands. Otherwise, I love playing video games, especially some of my old favourites which I've replayed countless times. (Boring hobby, ay!)    I'm not trying to win anything, just felt chatty :P"
neopets,3cb33c,XxBlazingWolfxX,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"Haha, I love chatty people!  I have used Duolingo before, but have found the same - not really a good tool for full language learning, but it does give you little chunks that are sort of fun to learn.  It's been pretty bearable here as far as the weather goes (not sure where you're from, I'm in Pennsylvania), so I haven't had to reduce to laying on the floor with the fan on quite yet, lol.  I love playing video games too, I just recently got into Skyrim (I know, sort of late to hop on the bandwagon haha).  Thanks for chatting!  :D"
neopets,3cb33c,LadySakuya,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally agree with the stuff about Duolingo.  Interesting, but not terribly useful.  Yeah, I tried to play Skyrim once before when it first came out and just couldn't get into it.  Then recently my cousin pushed me back into it and I've sort of figured it out.  You should try again!  :)"

Its always super exciting getting a job you like :D  im choosing 6 as my number!  Recently i've gotten into teaching myself new things!  Last week i started teaching myself to play guitar, and on my 1 hour commute to work, im listening to a japanese teaching program!  Its incredibly mentally stimulating!  My super favorite thing to do is draw.  I don't draw often, because i dont have time, but it is absolutely my favorite pass time.  I read the absolutely most stupidest article yesterday online - saying how, for the fourth of July in America, the Gay community is lacing the fireworks with ""homosexual chemtrails"" to turn all the straight people gay.  I literally read it and was laughing so hard there were tears.  Its super upsetting how intolerant some people are."
neopets,3cb33c,Scoozie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"My field is Computer Science.  Just got a job as a Systems Analyst, which is perfect since I'm not in love with writing code and software development enough to be a Software Engineer.    I've tried to play guitar before, but can't seem to stick with it long enough to develop calluses on my fingers.  And by Japanese teaching program do you mean you're learning the language?  How cool :)  I admire people who can draw.  I can't do it for the life of me.  HAHA omg that is hysterical.  I have quite a few gay family members, and they've really changed my view on the whole thing since they came out.  They're normal people and aren't sick at all lol.  People are ignorant."

I'm not fluent in the programmer lingo, but he said he was going to teach me something relatively easy - python/corba?  Not sure...  Guitar is moderately hellish - i play for an hour a day, and as an artist, its KILLING my hand.  But when i finally manage to pluck out a tune, its worth it :)  I'm absolutely learning the language!  My so and i are looking to vacation to Japan sometime soon, as its been a dream of ours :)"

Java is my favorite, and I've recently started tinkering with C#.  I hope to start contributing to open-source software and maybe build an app of some sort in my spare time.  I used to play guitar some and know some basic chords but I've never been very good at it - I'm a brass player so playing strings is a bit difficult for me to understand.  I've always wanted to learn Japanese!  Seems so cool.  Maybe I'll follow in your footsteps and take it up as well!"

If you have a Tuskaninny, a Kiko, or a Ruki your odds are greater! I take requests in that... if people tell me they want something I consider it and you might get a surprise present or maybe you wont.  I don't like the pressure that requests come with, I'd rather just do a gift drawing when I feel like it or not if I don't.  But thanks for the inquiry!"

I wouldn't use your commissioned neo art for anything though, it would just be my wallpaper on my computer/not be posted anywhere on the internet.

I wish I could go back but I can't give up my income at the moment to do it. LIVE LONG AND PROSPER AND STUFF. :)   The only extreme thing I am looking for at the moment is a Faerie Petpet Paintbrush for my favorite faerie's petpet, Spekkio. I will get it eventually, but anything to push me closer would be nice.   Edit: http://www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml?type=browse&criteria=id&search_string=410286852 here is a junk trade if you have anything you would want to throw my way. :3"

Right now, I'm saving up to get the last four pieces of the lab map I'm missing, so any amount of np is most appreciated (500k, maybe?).   Otherwise, if you've got a pirate petpet paint brush, a Weewoo of any colour, or a paint brush of some sorts, that'd be absolutely fantastic!"

It's always such a sad day when a generous soul is no longer part of the community.

Or that horrible Rainbow Baby Blu.    One of the things that's REALLY been bothering me though is the format for the news. It's literally the same every day: New ""Color"" > New Items > Any Extras > Swashbuckling (same picture every time). And they've been able to take up space reminding us about the Altador Cup. And they take up as much room as possible by announcing items and describing them ONE BY ONE instead of a larger quantity. It's all just so.... Static. And the pet days are almost always late!"

He will eventually be 8-bit bc the name is just derpy enough for it. But also debating pounding him as a darigan bc I kinda want to leave it.

I'm not sure how to help either...but I'm willing to help however I could. Only lists would be the wiki one, or this? I don't know how you find these names, haha.    Romaji is already the romanized form of Japanese characters, so no worries about the alphabet, I think. Like the romaji of 花火 (fireworks) = Hanabi, or to take an actual name, the romaji of 和美 (peace, beauty) = Kazumi. And even then, these names can have multiple meanings depending on what actual characters you use, so romaji names shouldn't be much of a problem at all as long as they are RWs in Japanese."

neopets,3c89jw,Marzipan86,5,Sun Jul 5 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yuri (genre):       Yuri (百合 ?, ""lily""), also known by the wasei-eigo construction Girls' Love (ガールズラブ, gāruzu rabu ?),  is a Japanese jargon term for content and a genre involving love between women in manga, anime, and related Japanese media.   Yuri focuses on the sexual or the emotional aspects of the relationship, or both, the latter of which sometimes being called shōjo-ai by Western fans.   The themes yuri deals with have their roots in the Japanese lesbian literature of the early twentieth century,   with pieces such as Yaneura no Nishojo by Nobuko Yoshiya.  Nevertheless, it is not until the 1970s that lesbian-themed works began to appear in manga, by the hand of artists such as Ryoko Yamagishi and Riyoko Ikeda.  The 1990s brought new trends in manga and anime, as well as in dōjinshi productions, along with more acceptance for this kind of content.  In 2003, the first manga magazine specifically dedicated to yuri, Yuri Shimai, was launched, and this was followed by its revival Comic Yuri Hime, which was launched after the former was discontinued in 2004.    Although yuri originated in female-targeted (shōjo, josei) works, today it is featured in male-targeted (shōnen, seinen) ones as well.  Yuri manga from male-targeted magazines include titles such as Kannazuki no Miko and Strawberry Panic!, as well as those from Comic Yuri Hime's male-targeted sister magazine, Comic Yuri Hime S, which was launched in 2007.     Image i - Dealing with the romance between an ""average blonde"" and a ""stately brunette"" at a girls' boarding school, Shiroi Heya no Futari, the first yuri manga, established archetypes that can be seen even in yuri works of the 2000s.

I'm curious what four letter name you found available! Would you be willing to share it? No worries if you'd rather keep it private. It's just interesting to me because I also did a pretty exhaustive search of all taken/available 4-letter combos about a year ago. The best I found was a nice pronounceable CVCV stuck in the pound."

Christmas is one of those days that I just rush through. This helped. Normally I managed to avoid spending the day there, but I've been living abroad snice September (hence the new obsession with neopets, at least it speaks my language) so I had to go home ot see everyone.

neopets,3c870x,yellowpron,0,Mon Jul 6 03:15:44 2015 UTC,yep! i checked out jellyneo's advanced search feature and DTI has the same. you can just select foreground items or shoes or whatever and it will pull them up for you.

neopets,3c90sk,Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,3,Mon Jul 6 00:57:50 2015 UTC,Oh those are kinda cool looking. Looks like you need a key to open them! Maybe try to trade for one? They give items! Or put them in your gallery! Or see if anyone is looking to trade for them! :)
neopets,3c90sk,maria1593,2,Mon Jul 6 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"I think I might trying to get a key and open one up, that sounds neat!"
neopets,3c90sk,maria1593,2,Mon Jul 6 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"Don't discard them!! Some of the items you can get from them are really valuable (eg. Philosophers Wig, Initiate Wizard Cape, Thieving Boots, Spellcasters Hands...) But I don't know if they (the casks) are NC items you can trade or not. Uhh... do they say ""no trade""?  You could trade FOR some Silver Cask Keys from people (worth around 2GBC according to /~clara) and open them. You might end up with some great stuff.  edit: Never mind, seems they are no-trade according to SunnyNeo. You can still trade for some keys if you want to try your luck."
neopets,3c90sk,maria1593,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:05:33 2015 UTC,"Oooh and if I don't end up with some great stuff, what's the worst that I can get?  I'm definitely going to get something from it, right?  If I use a key?"
neopets,3c90sk,Vengerai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely get something! Which casks do you have? Here's a list of all the stuff that comes from each one. And here's a NC value guide that I like.   edit: I looked through the values of all the items there, and it looks like in each cask there are one or two items that are worth 1-2 GBC, and the rest are 2 GBC and up. So it looks like the 2GBC price of the key is a fair in-between number that doesn't guarantee profit but isn't a likely loss. That is, if you decide to trade away the stuff you get at all. Maybe you'll like it and want to keep it!"
neopets,3c90sk,Vengerai,2,Mon Jul 6 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"Here's what I have:  Yellow Luminous Cask x5 Purple Luminous Cask x5 Green Luminous Cask x4 Orange Luminous Cask x3 Blue Luminous Cask x2  I'm going to go look up what could be inside of them, thanks for the link.  Hopefully I can find someone willing to trade a key to me so I can try to open one and see what happens.  Fun fun!"

Mostly because it teaches excellent spelling habits with easy words. Kids get used to spelling words with silent letters at an earlier age with a much more simple pattern to a complex language. Noah Webster worried more about etymology and simplicity rather than form. I use British English in my creative writing and American standard in anything that isn't.

I know they're on a time-basis, but gosh. I spend a lot of time refreshing for nothing. (I don't mean I continuously refreshing , but every once in a while I refresh. Nothing.) I'm not banned either, because I rarely buy or sell things, just looking for medicine or something sometimes, and rather buy it cheaper from the stores than users' jacked up prices. Things have changed... haha"
neopets,3c7cnz,WhiteBoyChief,2,Sun Jul 5 18:18:07 2015 UTC,It feels like they are stocked for 5 minutes then empty for 10 sigh

neopets,3c4rrw,Little_Lavinia,2,Sat Jul 4 20:18:09 2015 UTC,yes lol. i actually had this horribly intense nightmare that my boyfriend and i were brutally murdered and i've just had really bad anxiety all day so I put on some ocean waves.
neopets,3c4rrw,maria1593,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'm sorry. I have really vivid dreams too, but they are usually disturbing in a very subtle way.   I was mostly curious how you could listen to them without feeling like you need to use the rest room all the time or drink water or check the pipes or make sure something hasn't flooded. >.< Maybe I'm just overly anxious lol"
neopets,3c4rrw,Little_Lavinia,2,Sat Jul 4 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"Man, I wish mine were subtle! Mine are always fucking balls to the wall insane, like someone hacking me to pieces with a chainsaw, or cutting off my limbs one by one until i bleed out.   and as for the restroom and stuff, i don't really get that kind of feeling from ocean sounds actually. i've been to the ocean twice and each time brought me a great sense of peace and tranquility, so listening to ocean sounds has always been like a way to take me back to those moments where i was in a very calm and happy state of mind. luckily i'm going to the ocean for my birthday in just a few weeks!"
neopets,3c4rrw,maria1593,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"I think that if mine were overt they wouldn't bother me. Like if I have some idea what's going on or what I'm facing, I'm not really frightened, b/c I'm too busy analyzing. But, if I don't know or understand something its eats away at me.   My dreams are frequently paradoxical. For example, in my recent string of dreams. I'm in a room the walls look straight, but clearly the room curves (I think I've decided that because of the structure's size it is hard to notice the slight curvature). The room is either massive or I'm incredibly small or both. I have an awareness of all it's edges, but know they are too far away to see.  Despite the size of the room, I feel claustrophobic (I'm only ever felt claustrophobic in my dreams. It's weird). Maybe, because I feel trapped or b/c I know that the walls curve in towards me despite looking straight. The room is empty, but there is something/someone that will find me, and something/someone that I must find. I can't move through the empty flat floor in straight lines; I have to wind through it like a maze. I have to search, but will not find. I have to flee, but will not be caught. I always wake up disoriented.  I also have dreams where I feel like a full year has passed. Sometimes they are so lovely which is absolutely terrifying when I think about it.    That was quite a mouthful :P. Anyways, I love the beach/ocean, but more b/c I'm curious (I'm really bad at relaxing. I literally always have to feel like I'm doing something.)   Happy early Birthday! I hope you have a wonderful time at the shore :)"

You say you've emailed JS, TNT and used their Facebook page - have you submitted a ticket through Help, and have you quoted your ticket number in your emails? You can check some earlier posts to see if people are facing the exact same issues with Premium/what they did. I don't recommend that you call your bank to file a chargeback. In the event that your payment did really go through, and Neopets is just being slow on giving you Premium features (it can take 24 hours or more, I think), JS/TNT have been known to freeze your account until you pay them that money back."

neopets,3c4igl,Foreversquare,5,Sun Jul 5 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"I've been a big advocate for Premium and NC until just recently. My yearly subscription of Premium will probably renew itself in September even though I have canceled it. I told them in my reason for canceling that if I get charged, I will be fighting with my bank over it. I have made sure to take screen shots of everything in case I really do have to take action.  I also spend quite a bit in NC. I've had Future Fashions for the past five months which means spending over $100 NC each month. I spent $125 on NC last month and am not able to access Future Fashions. It's not a big deal but I am very irritated with giving a company my money and not being able to get all the perks possible from it.  Have I enjoyed this year of Premium? Of course! Do I want to lose Premium? No! I'll probably go month to month provided I don't get charged for the year again. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Premium and what I have spent in NC.   If you want to get it, get it! But definitely do it at the month to month rate. I feel like you're less likely to get screwed that way!"

neopets,3c61ie,Mjrna,7,Sun Jul 5 04:06:28 2015 UTC,easy  easy game  easy trophy   Don't mind me I'm just going to go cry in a corner because I can't even get the avatar
neopets,3c61ie,Marante,3,Sun Jul 5 04:34:09 2015 UTC,me neither. it's ok. it's ok.
neopets,3c61ie,maria1593,7,Sun Jul 5 04:40:57 2015 UTC,"You can get the avatar, I'm positive of it, as (last I checked) there was a way to make it super, super, super easy.    You know how you can press/hold the right arrow key to slow down the ball?  If you press it a ton of times at the beginning of the game, and hold it once you're going really slow, you'll go really, really slow.  Slower than you should.  So slow, it's barely possible to jump over the houses/logs/etc.  Then, whenever you go to the next stage, keep the right arrow key held down through the cutscene and everything.  If it worked properly, you should still be going slowly.    Doing this comes with two caveats, however.  First, if you hit any object, you have a chance of speeding way, way up to your normal speed, and it's damn near impossible to return to the slower-than-normal speed.  This means that you need to be really good at avoiding the objects, which luckily, when you're going that slowly, is a piece of cake, it just takes practice timing your jumps (reaction time isn't an issue any more, just knowing how long to wait before you jump is).  Additionally, if you do this successfully, the latter levels can take upwards of five-ten minutes each, meaning it takes a loooooong time to beat the game.    However, doing this means that you can basically get a perfect score, as it's super easy to learn to time your jumps and avoid all the obstacles, you have plenty of time to avoid the objects and collect the items, and don't have to worry about getting lucky with reaction time/jumps.    Also, avoid the power up slushies.  If you get the one that gives you good traction or whatever, it'll speed you up, and if you get the black hole one, you have a chance of sucking in one of the traction ones I just said to avoid haha.    Sorry if this is long-winded, but I SUCKED at the game so much before I discovered this, and now my high score is ~7500.  EDIT:  Whoops, just checked, the right arrow moves you in a different direction.  I meant the UP arrow haha.  Like I said, it's been awhile since I've played, but I know that back when I did get the avatar/trophy, this ""secret"" was there."
neopets,3c61ie,cjgerik,2,Sun Jul 5 05:01:37 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh I should have included this! I didn't quite remember how I even played the game lol  Yes, that's probably why the game went on forever. If you go incredibly slow it's hard to mess up. I thought the game was that slow normally, oops."
neopets,3c61ie,maria1593,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:41:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, amazing, thank you. I'll definitely try this."
neopets,3c61ie,cjgerik,4,Sun Jul 5 05:06:03 2015 UTC,"No problem!  I just checked, and it's still working.    You'll be able to tell when it works.  You'll be moving very slowly, at the rate where an item at the bottom of the hill/screen will take around two seconds to reach the other end.    I'm using Google Chrome, by the way.  I don't think it has to do with browser/lagginess or anything, but if you're unable to do it on a different browser you can try chrome instead.    It'll take three/four playthroughs to get used to moving at the slow speed, but once you get used to it, it's a walk in the park.  It gets to the point where you'll be 100% size, just holding the up arrow, pressing the space bar to jump when necessary.    And getting hit by the objects didn't seem to affect the speed from the trick - however, getting hit by that super traction slushie did, so avoid that and the black-hole one at all costs.  I think the ice patches might also mess up the speed since those make you skid, but I can't be sure.  Really, just avoid everything that you can except for the items!    Hope this helps.  If you have any questions on it, feel free to ask!"

neopets,3c61ie,roxychalk,3,Sun Jul 5 18:26:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know about holding the right arrow key down but holding down the down arrow keys works too and it means you can move left and right through the stage to get items.   Holding the down arrow key and at the end of each round let go, and start holding it again during the cutscene works fine, and gives your hand a small break between rounds.  NEVER GET THE BLACK SLUSHIE OR HIT THE ICE ON THE GROUND. THESE ARE THE ONLY THINGS OTHER THAN LETTING GO ON THE DOWN ARROW THAT WILL MAKE YOU SUPER FAST AND LOSE CONTROL. Just don't do it.   I would also avoid the item which makes you attract other items, it can make you pick up black slushie which can ruin your game.  The first round is the round you will hit a lot of objects while jumping. The best way to try get better at jumping objects is looking at the shadow on your snowball. As soon as the shadow on the front of your snowball hits an object, jump! It takes a bit of practise but that's how I found jumping houses and stuff was easier. Find what works for you, because when you manage to find they key to jumping objects then 90%+ of the time you will jump everything and it will be more fun.  IF YOU HIT BLACK SLUSHIE OR ICE THEN HOLDING DOWN THE JUMP BUTTON! It happened to me during a few rounds where I got the attract items thing or mistimed my jump and lost control of the snowball, but holding down the jump button meant I surivived the round, it all gave me enough for like a 3rd place highscore even though I basically missed around.  If you need any more help just ask, I got 8k for a gold trophy and then gave up on the game, I could probably get higher but I don't really need to play it for anything now lol."
neopets,3c61ie,Magyk4,2,Sun Jul 5 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"this is how I scored #1 and held the trophy for like 3 months ;)  I'm rusty now but since I already have gold, meh :D"

neopets,3c61ie,Magyk4,2,Sun Jul 5 22:31:03 2015 UTC,"Tried this out, as I'm working on some trophies myself. Only one thing to say. Holy fuck, fuck you Snow Roller. Nothing against OP, but it seems s/he's just a god at Snow Roller, while I'm a mere mortal :/. It's not like I'm bad at games in general, as I've got 15 or so game trophies these past 2 months, most gold too.  Things are flying at me at like mach 10 after the first level, and it just stays that way for me. I see an obstacle, hit jump as soon as it appears, and it hits me before my dumb snow-ass gets off the ground and into the air.. I dunno if it's my computer or what, because I watched a Youtube video and it looked easily 20 times slower then mine is running at. Some1 halp pls T___T?  EDIT - Thank you guys, I knew I was missing something. Much more doable now :'D:D:D.  EDIT 2 - Guess It's just me. Can't stay slowed down. Holding the arrow key the entire time isn't working out for me. When I just try avoiding anything and everything, I get a random speed boost on level 1 from nothing that throws me into ice/an obstacle."

neopets,3c42jh,Syzeki,2,Sat Jul 4 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think there was a glitch that caused everyone's to ""un-cancel"" recently. I signed up for an annual plan in January and cancelled as soon as it went into effect because I don't like recurring payments like that and will renew manually when the time comes if I'm still playing. I checked on it about a week ago when someone posted about it, and, sure enough, it was active again. I re-cancelled, and so far it's stayed that way.  I'm not sure what this means for people getting their money back and I have a sneaking suspicion that this is just another nail in the Neopets coffin.

Even if you bust 10 times in a row, chances are that if you play another 100 times, you will profit 83% of the time. Don't give up. Food Club is a game of patience and consistency.

neopets,3c3c6c,Vengerai,3,Sat Jul 4 10:37:17 2015 UTC,"Good for you that you're finally seeking help for your social anxiety. Take it slow, at least you've taken a step in the right direction. No need to feel embarrassed, nobody chooses to be mentally ill. Nothing wrong with needing help working through your problems, you should be glad that you've identified your issues, taken measures towards resolving them and making things better for yourself. If you'll post your wishlist, I can always send you something to make your day a little better. :)"

neopets,3c3c6c,sethpwnsk,3,Sat Jul 4 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"In terms of your social anxiety, if your therapist isn't into cognitive-behavioral treatment, I suggest you either ask them about it or find someone else to see.  While I'm not a fan of exposure therapy, I believe an incredibly useful form of treatment is somewhere between the two. You could think about key places which you expect would make you feel anxious, go there and see how far you could push yourself into the setting without actually getting anxious and finding some space where you can sit with a notebook and write down your concerns, fears, any thoughts regardless of if they seem relevant at the time or not and then when you feel like you've got enough to focus in on (Or you feel yourself getting too close to a panic attack), take off. Reflect on it when you're more calm, compare your anxious expectations against your expectations when you feel calm and safe and then put both of those into perspective with memories of what sort of things actually have happened in that setting.  Then and most importantly, narrate ALL of this process to your therapist. Saying it out loud makes it real and it can force you to come to terms with how you really do feel about these thoughts and it can often take the power away from them.  But uhh this is r/neopets so like hey do you llike Bruces? I do."

I too enjoy high-social anxiety, but i am blessed with not having depression attached to that too.    Damn near every interaction with any person gives me either butterflies, adrenaline, cortisol, euphoria, detachment, or a combination of those emotions/feelings listed.  I have been out of therapy for a year or so and off my meds for quite some time longer than that.    It gets easier comrade.  Take it one day at a time.  I don't know how you feel with depression thrown in the mix, though i'm positive it only makes the emotional spectrum of the day that much more diverse.  Do your best any and every time you can to inhibit your thoughts from overwhelming you. Fight the good fight, and play however the hell much Neo you want. Neo is a great escape- just be sure to respect yourself enough you don't become hung-up on it.  I'm not gonna' throw any more cliches at ya, but i will end with just one more.  We are human-beings with great power of the mind, i don't know your exact pain, but you're able to recognize it, talk about it; and diagnose it.  Because you are capable of possessing such a conscience-mind, i know you can fight; but more importantly i know you will defeat the issues troubling you.    Hope i was the least bit helpful in some way or another.  Almost forgot to touch-base on your retail employment experience.  Having worked in Food-Service i have seen quite the array of absurd customers.  Only from my friends and through being a customer myself have i experienced/witnessed the true absurdity that comes with the ""customer is always right"" policy.    Those type-customers treating you as subhuman is putting it nicely.  Fuck those specifically belligerent people.  I hope you are able to flush their ignorance from your head a.s.a.p.    No one deserves what so many retail employees go through.  There's a special place in hell for those people to experience the type of a$$hole they choose to be.    Anyway, random number time!

I totally understand how you feel about the site. I'm like that too! And you don't have to justify spending NC!

neopets,3c3c6c,daringfeline,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:58:07 2015 UTC,682.  I feel you! I suffer anxiety and it is a struggle at work. Whenever I say something and it isn't received as it should be.. I go home and stress so much. I had to go to counselling over it.  Someone recently told me that their mum died and I told the boss as they wanted some time. Then I stressed that I misheard her and it was something else entirely. I couldn't sleep! It sounds silly but.. Haha!
neopets,3c3c6c,daringfeline,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:52:57 2015 UTC,Ah shit I tended to do that a lot.  One time I didn't say 'hi' loud enough to my manager and he didn't hear me and thought I was ignoring him and got super assholey about it and went on to say about how I should be greeting customers (I did) and blah blah blah power trip.  I felt bad for the rest of the day and even when I went home  x_x  fuuuuck that guy.  Also I do the thing with 'mishearing' someone.  It must be we don't trust ourselves enough  xD  Hope things get better!

neopets,3c3c6c,lafl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so, so sorry you're feeling this way.  I have really bad depression and anxiety too, to the point where I literally cannot leave the house without my boyfriend. He has to come EVERYWHERE with me, whether it's to go to the shop that's two minutes down the road, or even meet up with a friend. He has to make and answer phonecalls for me, as I can't even talk on the phone. Everything is done through him. Because of this, I've never had a job (I'm 21), and I sit around at home, hiding in my bedroom all day every day. Sounds good at first, but it's absolutely hellish haha. So in a way, I can sympathize with how you're feeling, though obviously I know that I will never know exactly how you feel.   First of all, well done! You're talking to a therapist, and made contact with VR! That is a WONDERFUL achievement, and you should be proud. I'm proud. I don't care that you're a stranger online, I am still so proud of you for trying to take the steps to getting better. It all needs to be done in baby steps, and it might not seem it like now, but you will get better. Recognizing your accomplishments, no matter how small you think they may be, is key. So bravo! :D   Second, I'm sorry your old job made you feel so shitty. People are shitty, unfortunately :( You done the right thing though, as you really don't need that kind of stress in your life. Heck, I'm sure anyone would have done the same!  Third, you're worried about getting another job incase everything repeats itself... Well, if you're still making enough money to get by, maybe you should put it on hold for now? At least till you feel a little better? You really don't want to overwhelm yourself, because you may fall at the first hurdle (though I stress that that is nothing to be ashamed of). As long as you have some money, you should concentrate on feeling better first. But if you continue to look for a job, then still, great! Bravo for sticking to it! You're still doing better than a lot of people lazing about :p Just please, try not to stress yourself out too much (though I know it's not as easy as that at times..), the VR will hopefully help you regards the job stuff. :p  If I had real money to spare, I would help you buy NC, but unfortunately I can't even buy any for myself as I'm struggling to get by, so I'm really sorry... :/  Also, sorry this turned into a long post o-o I don't blame you if you gave up reading haha... D: But if you're still here, then woo! And I know this may sound silly, since I am just a stranger, but if you ever feel the need to talk - even just want someone to listen while you vent, then I am more than happy to try to be of what little assistance I can. I'm not good at advice, but I will try my damned hardest to at least be there. My inbox is always open. :p  Basically.... (TL;DR, maybe?) - keep your head high, and your middle finger even higher. :D  EDIT; Forgot to add, I'm not taking part in the giveaway. :p Still, thank you for doing it! It's very kind of you."
neopets,3c3c6c,TubOfSoda,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:16:22 2015 UTC,"I'm living with my grandparents right now, I'm barely an adult hahah.  But I need a job since the babysitting thing is not paying nearly as well as a job would, and I hate that I'm sitting at home all the time.  Really all I'm doing is babysitting my sisters, as much as that is very very helpful to my grandparents (they're basically those girls' parents right now).  I used to have a fear of children (afraid to have any sort of familial relationship or have any sort of closeness I guess) since I was forced to babysit a lot by the eeeeevil stepmother as a younger kid (seriously don't make your 12 year old babysit an infant child for 8 hours straight and then heavily criticize them for what they do wrong).    Well those two are older now and my stepmom is not in my life anymore so they're more manageable, and since I've quit my job I've gotten over my fear of children for the most part by finally relenting to babysit, so I consider that a good thing.  (:  I hope I can get a job so I feel better about myself.  And well, if I end up taking two steps backward, I hope I can take about 8 or 10 steps forward!"

And if you don't like sitting at home, is there anything you've wanted to do that you could do now that you have the free time? Might as well take advantage of it, since you won't have as much free time with a job :p Maybe some sort of hobby will help? Or even going for nice walks? :o  Woah, no wonder you had a fear of children after having to do that o.o That sounds awful! I'm sorry you had to do that, a 12 year old shouldn't have that much responsibility pinned on them D:   Ahh, you're right, that is a good thing! :p It's always wonderful to get over fears. And you will get a job, so chin up :D Just don't beat yourself up about things that are out of your control, such as the anxiety - it's certainly not your fault if you find some stuff scary and hard to deal with. Even the best of people struggle with stuff! And woo, positivity! You will be taking far more steps forward than backwards, just you wait and see :D   We're all wishing you the best of luck!"

I don't think its apparent how horrible service roles are until you've been in one, people really do treat you like scum. Don't be embarrassed about it tomorrow, everyone has bleurgh days when they need to vent, and talking about what you have going on is better than just letting it eat at you in private.

I've hit the same spot and the only person I let near me is my boyfriend ;_; Even then I freak out sometimes and burst into tears.  My anxiety consists of a lot of health anxiety more so than social, but at the same time I just want to lock myself away! I've just started therapy but mainly it's just about what makes me tick at the moment rather than how to help me (which comes soon!)

neopets,3c3c6c,Hencenomore,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:38:52 2015 UTC,"Don't feel embarrassed there. When I graduated college, I got out with honors and a bachelor's of science in biochemistry and 26k in debt (and it is now at 28k because with IBR, I don't pay enough to hit my principal and the interest gained each month is greater than my payment).   I couldn't find a job. For four months I ate rice once a day and played WoW when I had free time between searching for a job. After four months, I did manage to get a job at a cookie place. It was really dehumanizing to 1) be terrified of people/highly judgmental of my own performance and 2) be treated like subhuman scum when I was probably more qualified to do a lot of things than the customers I was serving.   During the time I worked there, I didn't even net enough money to  pay my rent.   It sucked.  But you know what, it got better. I got my current job, met my boyfriend, and had a bunch of awesome stuff happen to me that's in another post. I still have a lot of anxiety that effects my work but I focus on powering through it because I continually tell myself that I won't be beaten by fear.  Believe that it can get better, and work towards it getting better. I believe in you!   206."

neopets,3c2hz1,loveisafireescape,12,Sat Jul 4 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"Meh :/ I liked it better when they gave out a free thingy that could be used even if you had no NC and no ability to get any. Now I'm sitting here with a potion that I have no use for.  Edit: I guess the majority of people on this sub are NC lovers, but seriously, try to understand the others' point of view?"
neopets,3c2hz1,UhOhFeministOnReddit,2,Sat Jul 4 07:07:28 2015 UTC,I currently have two gift boxes and will happily lend the Faerie Dust Shower or the Butterfly Shower to the first two people that need a lend and call dibs. The only provision is you have to give it back and own a trustworthy account.
neopets,3c2hz1,TubOfSoda,2,Sat Jul 4 04:35:11 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what this dye works thing is.  I don't think I want it.  If I collect it, would anyone want it? Can they explain to me what it is used for?  ..  Edit: thanks for the explanation!  if anyone would like my dye works thing for free, no trade needed, let me know. I'll need someone to send the box thing so I can send the potion back to them. I've sent a NC item only once before so I can manage if someone wants the item."
neopets,3c2hz1,hiddeninplainsite,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"Certain NC items, such as Rich Golden Eye Makeup, or Butterfly Shower, can be used with a Dyeworks Potion.  When used, it gives you a random recolored version of the original item.  You still get to keep the original item, however.  If you don't buy NC stuff at all then it's no use to you.  Giving it to somebody else would also require using a gift box, which come from Neocash Cards or Gift Box Mystery Capsules, which require real money as well."

Just send me a neomail specifying what you want dyed, followed by a GBC and a potion (you can send up to 2 potions per cube, I'm not looking to make a box profit).  Please also include where you'd like me to return the items in the neomail :)  Don't worry about waiting for me to be on.  I log in every day, so I'll get to you eventually.  Ninja Edit:  What color are you seeking?  I used two potions and got two pinks, so if it's pink you want, I can actually guarantee you that color."

neopets,3c24kw,maria1593,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:03:56 2015 UTC,Nod...and that would make more sense.  Thanks!

neopets,3c24kw,UhOhFeministOnReddit,2,Sat Jul 4 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"Hard to say how much lower they will go...   As far as I can tell, none of the Ghoul Catchers amulets, stamps, or shells released since the TNT mass firing have been properly activated (the stamps they announced haven't been activated at all and the other stuff is released but can't be albumed). So, honestly, I'm thinking Jumpstart just doesn't know how to properly activate these items or doesn't realize that they need to? In which case, this AC stamp is just going to keep on deflating."
neopets,3c24kw,afterisleep,2,Sat Jul 4 01:59:41 2015 UTC,I'm probably gonna buy several and wait it out until the price goes back to normal again.

neopets,3c1k9r,maria1593,8,Fri Jul 3 22:28:19 2015 UTC,"Alright so I was looking for a name for my water/desert xweetok customization.  I didn't know what I wanted, but I was on the lookout for anything that sounded light or airy or just sorta ethereal, you know?  But then I noticed in the 'newest' section of lost.quiggle was Coelis.  I was just really drawn to this word and I didn't know why, but it sounded like a real word.    So on a hunch I plugged the word into google.  Apparently, Coelis is 'the heavens' or 'heaven'.  I even plugged it into google translate to make sure.  So basically I have this pretty real latin word that some of the PC would probably shed blood for.  Also it goes perfectly with my custom:  http://impress.openneo.net/outfits/942635  yeeeeee  c:  I know some of you probably hate how crazy people get with names but it's like I was looking for something and I found more than what I expected to find, so I'm kinda happy.  I like the name for this custom a lot.  EDIT: oh and if anyone is wondering, I believe it's pronounced 'see-leese'"

neopets,3c2cqm,sethpwnsk,2,Sat Jul 4 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"Really hard to find buyers/people willing to pay pure.  Out of logic, not desperation, i would either take the offer or try to haggle a little.  What is your asking price?  Did you have an asking price on a trade lot?  Is this a redditor offering?  Despite the fact it's been hard to find a buyer- i'd personally be wiling to sell to someone for 4.6 Mil (or higher depending on haggle) since the item is also only r98.    With such low demand of r99 items, let alone so many others like this r98 BD equip; prices have been dropping.  Magical Pea Chia Pop is a good example, as is Meowclops.  However, BD equips have a good steady demand compared to petpets and expensive avie items.  IMO- it wouldn't surprise me if this item experienced a little deflation itself as well.  My answer would depend on you're asking price and if you can haggle the user up or not.  Lemme know the situation, i love playing the market game :P      Edit: Edit is in bold text above."
neopets,3c2cqm,sethpwnsk,2,Sat Jul 4 03:10:31 2015 UTC,"No price, I said I'd go lowest on TP in pure. Not a redditor AFAIK."
neopets,3c2cqm,sethpwnsk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:12:33 2015 UTC,"alright, both good things to know and to take into consideration.    Did u say u'd go lowest TP or lowest JN TP history?"
neopets,3c2cqm,sethpwnsk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:14:31 2015 UTC,just lowest on TP.  We haggled 4.5 -> 5 -> 4.7* ->4.6  *4.7 being the lowest recent TP sale.
neopets,3c2cqm,Magyk4,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"wait i don't follow your haggle-list.  He offered with 4.5 and u countered with 5 Mil?  Then you immediately asked 4.7?  Did he offer first or did you name him an opening price?  Cuz what is typed above is hard for me to make sense of.    Since there are no prices in TP and only 1 in auctions listed at 4.8 Mil, i'd either stay firm at 4.7, or i'd say something along the lines of ""Heh... i'd prefer we meet in the middle at 4.7, you offering me 4.6 Mil and the lowest current asking price being 4.8 Mil.  You'd be workin' me slightly :P what say ya to 4,650,000 ?  That way you get it lowest and i walk away feeling i made a good transaction.""    That's how i'd work it, hard to say since i'm not interacting with the  person."
neopets,3c2cqm,starpiece,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:22:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry, clarification:  He offered 4.5. I countered 5. He said lowest was 4.7 and asked for 4.6."
neopets,3c2cqm,TubOfSoda,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm well idk where he's pulling his info, it wouldn't be fair to call the JN price ""lowest.""  Depending on how bad you personally want to make the sale- i'd either stay firm at 4.7 or at least try something close to what i suggested and have him meet you in the middle at 4.65.  It's not the best deal in the world, but if he wants the item, which it seems he does since he's willing to pay 4.6 mil; i'm sure he'll come up with the extra 50-100k. At the very least he could/should pay you that much imo, JN's last price does not = ""lowest,"" but this would be a good point for you to touch on in order to convince him of 4.65 mil :)"

neopets,3bzgz2,maria1593,2,Fri Jul 3 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"Hi! Sorry for not responding sooner but anyhow congrats to our win!!    Odds will change according to how many (or how few) people bet on a pirate. For example, people placed many more bets on Gooblah instead of Edmund, which is why Edmund's odds changed from 3:1 to 4:1. However, the only odds that matter in telling who has the highest probability of winning are the opening odds! So if the odds change over the course of the day, the probability of your bets winning stays the same - it just might change if you win a lot or if you win less money. Hope that makes sense..."

And many thanks for the odds explanation, I read about it once or twice before but never knew that the probability of your bets winning depends only on opening odds.

neopets,3bzft2,XxBlazingWolfxX,6,Fri Jul 3 11:48:17 2015 UTC,"So when shit hit the fan at the weekend, I created a post saying that I couldn't log into my account.   I clicked on a link someone had posted here, leading to a ""NSFW"" pet lookup (I didn't see the big warning till afterwards, since my /r/neopets tab was kept open overnight and I always have it sorted by ""new""), and thought nothing of it. Came back here, saw all the drama, and went back to Neopets to change my password. But I had already been logged out, and couldn't log back in.  Tried resetting my password about 4 different times that day, each time it said it was ""successful"", but it still wouldn't let me log back in. So I sent in a ticket, and decided to leave it for a few days, incase I ended up getting myself frozen or something.  Tried resetting it again today, and it worked, but now I have zilch in the bank, so kinda miffed. :| Fair to say I'm an absolute idiot for not using a PIN. Set one up now though. ;-;  Is Ghoul Catchers working properly yet? I can't check atm, but it seems I'm going to have to be grinding that for awhile haha.  EDIT; Also, I may just be paranoid, but TNT won't freeze me for it, right? :s I was scared that resetting the password so many times would cause some sort of problem, and now that I haven't done anything for a few days but suddenly reset/log in again, I'm even more paranoid. :s"
neopets,3bzft2,Syzeki,3,Fri Jul 3 12:25:51 2015 UTC,I remember about 10 years ago when there wasn't PINs and my account was hacked. Very sad days!

Quick question about another portion of your post:   I didn't have enough NP out to haggle on a Jeran Usuki (r99), by 1k earlier.   Did you offer everything you had out and he wanted 1k more, or did you not offer because you had out 1k less than he was asking?  I'm hoping your wording is just reading strange to me and that you meant the former.  It still sucks missing it, but at least you went down swinging in that case!"

It appears as if majority of the support team which handles tickets is either lazy/rude or just not helpful (as far as I've seen on this sub, especially regarding /u/ixiholic 's trouble with their account.) In addition to that, it takes them MONTHS or even longer to respond to a ticket for account issues. A lot of people recommend badgering them on their facebook and twitter. I had submitted a ticket for a lost account, waited about two months, and luckily I was able to recover the email myself. The ticket wasn't even looked at.

Unfortunately if your account is under 4 months you won't be able to adopt certain pets nor receive them from other individuals. You can find a list of pets you can and cannot adopt right here. That also has additional information on pets you can get and when you get transfers and such.   Best bet is to see if anyone can hold them for you until your account is aged. Some folks are kind enough to do that! :) Best of luck!

neopets,3bxyys,iamlookingtosell,2,Fri Jul 3 16:08:15 2015 UTC,"This amount isn't unfeasible for anyone that puts a lot of effort in the game. Between foodclub, hardcore reselling, restocking, stocks, dailies, battling the Jetsam, you can probably net around 500k/day easily. I used to net anywhere from 5-7m/week from reselling UBs (before I got frozen for collusion long ago, hello new account). I had a few UBs that I made anywhere from 5-7m nps off of. I realized that effort isn't worth my time anymore as I'm older and can put it towards better uses but it is possible. For some reason after 100m, you tend to become a target (unless you stay off of the boards)."

neopets,3bxyys,iamlookingtosell,4,Fri Jul 3 03:31:21 2015 UTC,"Wall of text incoming!  Well I won't lie. Now bear in mind I used to bully my sister for playing this back in 1999. I started in 2001. I was just about 10 years old. My first account lasted for a while before I got scammed. I then went on a scamming rampage (scumbag kid wanted to be rich) until I wisened up a year later and realized that it wasn't cool to hurt others. Keep in mind, I've gotten bitten, I just got scammed out of $290 on PayPal. Heh.  Anyways, I started restocking in 2001. I used to sit at the money tree but there was never anything good there. There was one time back in 05 or so that someone dumped around 5,000 Chokato TCGs there. I didn't get one of them. Anyways, after learning basic haggles and spending 5 hours a day practicing, I started restocking. I used to never get anything good. I'd get a red elephante MP maybe once every few days. After a while, I realized it was because I had a shit computer running 128MB of ram. Once I upgraded to 512MB, things got better. And then we got broadband. When broadband first came out I was on fire with restocking.   Reselling naturally came sooner. I made a bunch of big mistakes doing that. It got me frozen a few times because if you piss off the wrong person, you get mass reported and get iced. I was once banned because I bought up 15m nps in books that I planned to resell in a year. Apparently this was considered price collusion and once again, iced.  You get better as you screw up though. Eventually I had the price of just about everything from 500k-15m completely memorized. I would watch what they sold for and note it in my Excel files. After doing this, I was able to sell items that I got for huge profits. I'd watch a r99 sell for 15m.  A few months later, I would grab that same r99 for 4m. I would then negotiate with my buyers and provide them proof that it sold for 15m (screenies ftw) and sell it to them for 12m or so.  Restocking is much less stressful. If you hover over a shop, have a decent connection, and actively know the rare items, you will get them. I changed it up though. I like getting weird UBs. I think I've even gotten ones from weird shops like Space Petpets.   Anyways, TNT gets so freeze happy that I just made an account after coming back and I'm doing dumb crap on it to see how long it takes to freeze me. It's fun nostalgia wise but as a 24 year old male, I get bored of it easily."

It's possible, however it's very tedious and boring. I actually was frozen right after I restocked a really rare r99 shell worth 15m at the time. I've been restocking legitimately since 2001. I honestly don't have the patience for it but I'd say I netted 3-400m over the years just sitting in magic/stamp/coin. Yes, you can actually get potions in magic and be legit. :-)  I must've gotten pet lag on at least 4 donna stamps. Are those still worth 40m?"

neopets,3by5rr,khaneko,2,Fri Jul 3 07:54:41 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I think it's against TNT's rules for you to transfer a pet to be painted (I guess in the past people transferred a neopet out and then the new owner refused to return said neopet which caused problems? That's the only thing I can think of). Obviously I wouldn't steal the pet (I have enough pets of my own ;_;) but it's against the rules and I don't want to risk it.

neopets,3byr0y,rocktodiamond,4,Fri Jul 3 06:35:11 2015 UTC,"Welcome back!!    My favorite is Food Club... ;)    The subreddit has a daily food club thread. It's auto-posted at about 8:00 am NST every day and throughout the day many users come and share their bets. If you're not interested in creating your own bets, it's a great place to browse and pick and choose a bettor to follow.    Personally, I post my bets there every day, but I also post my bets on my own petpage earlier (usually around 12 am NST - so within this next hour) http://www.neopets.com/~FoodClubBets (I also have a really basic explanation of the game itself there if you're unfamiliar).     Stocks are also a good place to put your money if you're not really doing anything with it. Buy low, sell high. So spend your daily 1,000 shares of stocks on the lowest priced stock you can (15 np per share, unless you have the stock market boon which lets you buy for 10 np per share). And you kinda just let it sit there until it hits a high number. A lot of people on this sub wait for it to go up to amounts like 50 or 60 np before touching it. It can take a long, long, LONG, time, but it will profit in the end!!    Finally, restocking is good, I hear. However I'm not well-versed in it. One of our lovely users made a guide though, so I'll just drop it off here too: http://www.neopets.com/~Briannea"

Food Club is an outstanding moneymaker for those with aged accounts (cough cough not me kicks stupid 2 month old account). I'll never be neo-rich, but I've got steady income.  I'm trying to learn how to restock, with little to no success, but imo, that and reselling/sniping are the best ways to earn NP."

I've won a grand total of 7,140 NP thanks to FC (I didn't play every day, though). I really only bet on days that the daily thread on here says that the odds are good.  It's not that you won't make money with a young account, it just won't be even close to as much as people with older accounts make, since you can only bet the amount equivalent to your account's age in days + 50."

neopets,3bx9hk,starpiece,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:53:24 2015 UTC,"Suuuper lucky congrats!!  Last I saw them going for was 1.2mil so that should be a good set point :) I really should have waited to get one, for a while they were falsely inflated to 5mil and I thought buying mine at 1.8 was a steal. Then they went back to normal 1.2 a month later lol"
neopets,3bx9hk,maria1593,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"Speaking of inflated 5mil petpetpets, do you think Strales will ever go down?"
neopets,3bx9hk,Franseil,2,Thu Jul 2 22:51:07 2015 UTC,I sold my Strale a few months ago and I can't remember exactly what it went for but definitely under 5m and I accepted items. Don't give up. :)
neopets,3bx9hk,starpiece,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:35:44 2015 UTC,I sure hope so :( I was checking on ditrey every week basically for months and it never changed then all of a sudden it was 5mil. Now that it's back though I would think that strale will eventually go back to normal too. As soon as it does I'm nabbing one before it happens again :P   Oooh I just checked and they're down to 2.8 on TP so keep looking in the next few weeks! And I willl too because my robot kacheek/robot snowbunny NEEDS one
neopets,3bx9hk,maria1593,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"Oh it's good to know that it will probably fluctuate, since I'm not ready to buy one yet anyway and won't be for several months... looool  edit: ok maybe not ""several months"" if food club and jetsam ace are as nice to me as they were today"
neopets,3bx9hk,starpiece,3,Thu Jul 2 23:09:37 2015 UTC,Food club was definitely nice today! I checked at 7:05 (my time) and it said I had no winning bets and I was SO mad but it just hadn't updated yet for some reason bc when I checked again another 5 mins later it was there  I feel the same way. Like I have enough now to get it even at this price but then I would be back at 0 and I don't wanna break my entire bank account quite yet. Just trying to recover from my last expensive impulse shopping binge
neopets,3bx9hk,maria1593,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:20:31 2015 UTC,"Constantly spending, earning, and hovering around 1mil in the bank started discouraging me, so I devised a new system. While I still have goals to work towards, between each goal I'm gonna raise the ""do-not-withdraw-below-this"" bank level by 1mil. So I have a 2mil cushion right now, and after I buy the Faerie Petpet PB I'm gonna save until I have a 3mil cushion, etc :D I think that'll prevent me from going into lack-of-money AND lack-of-achieved-goal depression"
neopets,3bx9hk,starpiece,2,Thu Jul 2 23:25:54 2015 UTC,I'm just hitting 3mil again but I was at 7.. then 4.. then down to 1.7 and I haven't bought anything expensive since then. I wanna hit 10mil before buying anything else but I know that will not happen unless I force myself to restock which is suuuuper boring. I think around 2mil is my cushion right now too
neopets,3bx9hk,Ro-Dent,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, thank you for mentioning that. I thought I didn't win anything. Went and checked because of your post and I have 467,880 np just sitting there lol :D Thanks!"

neopets,3byeix,carolnuts,21,Fri Jul 3 04:30:43 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Not going dark.  Longer answer: We're hardly a blip on the radar of reddit admins.

No type of Reddit controversy has ever personally affected me until today, and that's only because the /r/askreddit mods decided to go dark to show ""solidarity.""  To me, going dark is the same thing as killing the community. Can I still use it if it's dark? Post, lurk? I can't use /r/askreddit anymore. I don't want that to happen to /r/neopets, unless we were all added as approved submitters, and I don't even like that idea."

neopets,3byeix,brandnew_perspective,5,Fri Jul 3 06:34:24 2015 UTC,I meant that we don't compare because we're so so so so much better than those guys.
neopets,3byeix,awry_lynx,12,Fri Jul 3 09:00:12 2015 UTC,We're not really a huge sub. I don't see any reason why we should.
neopets,3byeix,roxychalk,8,Fri Jul 3 04:38:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed... once in a while I venture to the front page but this sub is pretty much the only place I go. One of the reasons I love it is it's untouched by the rest of reddit drama. Going dark would totally destroy that :(  ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE REALLY FUNNY TO GO TO THE BLACKOUT SUBREDDIT AND NOTE THAT WE'RE GOING DARK. I foresee a ton of ""wow, neopets is still a thing?"" comments."
neopets,3byeix,-cupcake,2,Fri Jul 3 04:42:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. It's awesome that this is a safe haven for us. But the change in Reddit's politicies affects us too , so unfortunately we can't be 100% detached from what happens at the default subs. If this site crashes we all go down."
neopets,3byeix,roxychalk,4,Fri Jul 3 04:44:46 2015 UTC,"While that fact is true - if the site crashes we lose this community - I'm not sure the sentiment is. I mean, why would Reddit crash because they fired an (admittedly cool) employee? Confused."
neopets,3byeix,Marzipan86,0,Fri Jul 3 04:48:14 2015 UTC,It's more about the way the site has been handled those past few months. Things seem to be going downhill.
neopets,3byeix,Franseil,7,Fri Jul 3 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anyone that would notice would be more annoyed than proud."
neopets,3byeix,Marzipan86,0,Fri Jul 3 04:40:07 2015 UTC,I understand. I just wanted to know the general opinion about it.
neopets,3byeix,Franseil,7,Fri Jul 3 04:41:22 2015 UTC,"I really don't want us to. This is the first I've heard of Victoria and /r/neopets is the only subreddit I frequent... and I sort of rely on it for a lot of Neopets motivation and help, to be honest. And Neopets is mostly the only thing I do these days."
neopets,3byeix,Marzipan86,6,Fri Jul 3 04:44:37 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel like this mirrors what happened on neopets.com On neopets, Viacom sold to JumpStart On Reddit, new CEO Ellen Pao On neopets, they let go of the entire content team On Reddit, they let go one of the most beloved admin members Both sites have been having server issues&having trouble with communication too! At the very least, I think we should somehow show our respect to what is happening, maybe show by example what a community can do when the owners of a site keep fucking everything up. (even if that's just something in the CSS&making it ""go dark"")"
neopets,3byeix,khaleesibitchborn,4,Fri Jul 3 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"Truth, although Jumpstart > Pao in a lot of ways (mostly because even if JS is inept there's no single person the blame focuses on for bad decisions)"
neopets,3byeix,khonrichan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:55:42 2015 UTC,You know what ? I feel the same way ! I only browse Reddit and neopets and both of the new adms seems to be fucking up recently. It's very frustrating
neopets,3byeix,E6E6FA,3,Fri Jul 3 04:54:41 2015 UTC,"I don't really check out many other subreddits and honestly I don't see the point of going dark*. They had a shitty transition between letting someone go and not having someone (or some process) in place to handle the responsibilities she had (I'm gleening this from the /r/outoftheloop, which I didn't even know existed until about 3 minutes ago when I read your link :x) but I don't think a small sub would be noticed or make a difference other than annoy people who lurk that aren't subbed.  *accidentally a few words"
neopets,3byeix,E6E6FA,3,Fri Jul 3 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"Also, to clarify, ""going dark"" (making the subreddit private) means that ONLY MODS AND APPROVED SUBMITTERS can see or post in the sub.     It would be blocked off to everyone else - including people who are subscribed."
neopets,3byeix,E6E6FA,2,Fri Jul 3 05:14:12 2015 UTC,okay then that makes even less sense. thank you for clarifying cupcake <3
neopets,3byeix,elysiahhh,3,Fri Jul 3 05:31:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'd make much of a difference going down. According to the sidebar there are only 125 of us here right now anyway.  This is about more than just the Victoria thing, though. Reddit has apparently been losing a lot of active users since Ellen Pao banned a bunch of distasteful (but totally legal) subreddits. Sure, the people in those subs were assholes, but they were being assholes in their own little corner. Getting rid of those subs did nothing to curb harassment on the wider site, it just took away the part of the site that allowed them to share their mutual hatred and closed-mindedness in a largely non-harmful manner.   Also, I'm with /u/brandnew_perspective. This is very reminiscent of the Neopets weirdness that's been going on since... Was it September? We should show our support in a way that doesn't compromise the community. I actually feel like we're somewhere between a gaming sub and a ""mental health"" type sub sometimes. None of the mental health subs are going down because the users rely on this for assistance."
neopets,3byeix,E6E6FA,6,Fri Jul 3 05:17:38 2015 UTC,"The subs that were banned weren't sticking to their own little corner, that's why they were banned. It's pretty clear that Reddit has no issue with ""distasteful"" subreddits.   If people are leaving because of the FPH mess, then good riddance to them. I'm confident that Reddit will be a better site in their absence."
neopets,3byeix,ostentia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:15:43 2015 UTC,"But why would closing a sub keep the users from that sub from spreading they're opinions across the site? Before, it could be dismissed with a little quip about the sub ""leaking,"" and people could move on. Besides, Reddit is sorry of based on people being free to discuss their onions, however unpopular those may be. As long as it's not something illegal (my mind always goes back to jailbait), why stifle that?"
neopets,3byeix,ostentia,2,Fri Jul 3 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"Again, FPH was not contained to its sub. Specifically, FPH was banned because it was harassing Imgur staff after Imgur started blocking FPH images. FPH also had a history of bullying Reddit users, but that wasn't the ""real"" reason it was banned and I don't know to what extent that kind of harassment was encouraged by the sub itself vs. individual FPH posters acting on their own. I would hope that the FPH fiasco discourages users from harassing others if only on the basis that their sub could be at risk (since clearly we can't rely on a sense of humanity or compassion).  I'm not sure what the other banned subs were doing but I also haven't seen anyone complain about them so whatever.   On a side note, there are entirely valid reasons to worry about free speech and censorship, especially in the political sphere. But I feel like whenever people complain about censorship on the internet they're just looking for an excuse to be an asshole."
neopets,3byeix,foryeve,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"Hm, I hadn't heard about them harassing Imgur staff. Thanks for the additional information. Regardless, the sub-banning (not just FPH) had repercussions on usership."
neopets,3byeix,ostentia,3,Fri Jul 3 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"Very, very good point on the mental health thing. I know a lot of people, myself included, have looked to neopets as a relief from real life in one way or another.   It's a very good non-destructive way to cope with life sometimes. There are some people in delicate situations that look to this reddit for relief and I wouldn't want them to ""go dark"" themselves."
neopets,3byeix,SmilkySmoofFur,2,Fri Jul 3 05:23:26 2015 UTC,I love your description of this place as a blend of gaming/mental health type sub.

neopets,3bu99l,CandiedQueef,41,Thu Jul 2 06:00:33 2015 UTC,"Oh God.  A user here was lucky enough to get an FFQ, whether it was by FQFC or RE I don't remember. So they created a pet named Gizlice, which if I recall correctly means 'sneaky' or 'stealthy' in Azerbaijani, as the pet was supposed to be a Stealthy Kyrii.  So they go to the Rainbow Fountain and go to paint their pet, and next, they have a warning for inappropriate language and another of their pets is painted Baby.  So they file a ticket, and holy shit- IT GETS ANSWERED. TNT tell them they found the name inappropriate, so they deleted the pet, coincidentally RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME of the painting at the rainbow pool. Because the pet was deleted, the next active pet was painted. And because Stealthy wasn't an available colour, it was painted Baby. TNT don't do anything. Basically tells the user to fuck off.  Obviously it's a huge fuckup on their part, one because there's no safeguard for a pet to get automatically painted by mistake, two because imagining that name as inappropriate is a huge reach, and three because they wouldn't restore anything - not the FFQ, not the painted pet's previous colour, nothing.  and so, now /r/neopets echoes with the ghost of a pet. Aborted before it could even be loved. Gizlice.  Fuck JumpFart."

neopets,3bvz8q,Hencenomore,8,Thu Jul 2 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"Imagine if Neopets turned into a 3D Club Penguin D: using Jumpstart's other games as a visual reference I really wouldn't be happy with them changing everything. Also I doubt they have any resources to do any better or spend the required time to actually make the decision actually worth wild, so I think it would be a train wreck but so far JS has been a train wreck so maybe it's just up their alley.   At least they had the common sense to keep Ghoul Catchers 2D. Maybe they understand that they'd lose more money drastically changing the site and making it like their other online games."
neopets,3bvz8q,anzaii,15,Thu Jul 2 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"No, no, no, no, no, for the love of God... NO!!  I hate (HATE) 3D in the best of times. Seriously, I despise it. It's gimmicky and, in every single case I have seen it used, totally unnecessary. If Neo went 3D I would get rid of everything I had and leave the site, no joke. I hate it that much."
neopets,3bvz8q,Cinsare,5,Thu Jul 2 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"Neopets' art style is one of the things I actually love about it - so no, I wouldn't be happy if they revamped the whole thing in 3d.  Besides, that would pretty much only work if they decided to remake the entire game to be more like the game-engine-powered MMOs we're used to seeing rather than a browser-based one. And while that seems kind of cool (and actually what Adam and Donna were going for when they first had the idea), it would also completely change the way the game is played."
neopets,3bvz8q,kolidescope,4,Thu Jul 2 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of a 3-d revamp, that wouldlook super juvenile, but having a few 3d games (like KQ) wouldnt be so bad"
neopets,3bvz8q,6thninja,2,Thu Jul 2 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"YES, I TOTALLY FORGOT KQ IS 3D. Key Quest is enough just bring it baaack ;_;"
neopets,3bvz8q,maria1593,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"I think 3D could be successful, and not necessarily juvenile-looking.  There are plenty of games out there that do 3D stylization beautifully (i.e. League of Legends)--and that's what Neopets would need if it were to go the 3D route.  But they would need a very skilled artist to make things look that good."
neopets,3bvz8q,felidaedalus,2,Thu Jul 2 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"But if you consider that the site is built around cute and whimsical animals you can dress up and explore with, it's  going to look more like this"
neopets,3bvz8q,6thninja,3,Thu Jul 2 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea! Unfortunately I don't think it'll ever pan out - the current artists are struggling to keep up as it is. The recently released items, pet colours, etc, have been awful from a quality point of view. I'm talking to you, Rainbow Baby Blu"
neopets,3bvz8q,behonourable,5,Thu Jul 2 17:07:43 2015 UTC,My favourite new artwork is this It's so hideous that I want to send it to all of my neofriends haha but of course it's not even activated -_- maybe in a few more months  I really wish I could find the post on tumblr but someone redid the rainbow baby blu and actually tried to make it look good and it was really nice. It just makes me sad when the user base is more concerned with quality of content rather than the people actually running the site :/
neopets,3bvz8q,anzaii,2,Thu Jul 2 17:26:44 2015 UTC,...how is that real
neopets,3bvz8q,Tehddy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:19 2015 UTC,It looks like MS Paint
neopets,3bvz8q,felidaedalus,3,Thu Jul 2 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'm an alumnus of JumpStart World, if that's the 3D they'd bring to the table, I can't do it.   In fact, even if it was good 3D, I wouldn't be able to do it.   In fact, even if it was only partially 3D, like comics and Flash games remained 2D, that wouldn't work, because I need a single continuous style to see Neopia in. So if I see Hanso in 3D and also in 2D I'm gonna be like ""But what does he look like canonically?"""
neopets,3bvz8q,Superkouza,5,Thu Jul 2 17:33:02 2015 UTC,"Hm, so as a 3D artist, I'd have to say that making the clothes fit every pet would probably be even trickier than it is now - especially if you'd have the ability to do a turn-around and see your pet from multiple angles. Accessories, like necklaces and bracelets and that kind of thing, probably wouldn't be too bad. Overall it would be a huge challenge to revamp the site in 3D - if you were to do every item, pet, and location to fit a new 3D look. Even recoloring wouldn't necessarily be easier - it could, in fact, take more time.  But that's from a more technical standpoint, haha. I think the battledome would be really cool to see in 3D - since you mentioned Pokemon that's part of what popped into my mind - and having basic idle animations on a pet would be pretty cool, like on their userlookup. I'd be a big data pull too, though. It's an interesting idea for sure!"
neopets,3bvz8q,venv,2,Thu Jul 2 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"IIRC, this was the kind of immersion that the founders of neopets had originally wanted, right?"
neopets,3bvz8q,Probably_not_aladdin,2,Thu Jul 2 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"I think I might like some aspects of the site in 3D, maybe even all of it.  It really depends on how they developed it style-wise.    That being said, it's not likely to happen.  Especially not the customization aspect--Neopets' entire infrastructure is geared towards 2D, so it would take them forever and a half to implement (not to mention creating all the characters and customization assets...holy cow that would take ages.)   Also, depending on how the 3D was rendered (real time vs. pre-rendered) a lot of people might be excluded since running 3D can be taxing on a computer.  Right now I think a lot of the draw to neopets is how accessible it is, no matter what platform you happen to be on.  3D has the potential to be really cool, but it would be at the cost of excluding some users who want a 2D experience that their phone or laptop is capable of running.  Not to mention there are countless ways that 3D could go wrong and just look terrible.     I've considered making a 3D neopets character for a while, just to explore the stylization.  Maybe I'll try it for giggles."
neopets,3bvz8q,felidaedalus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:26:01 2015 UTC,"They tried to do a couple 3D games and I could never play them because my computer didn't like them. I've tried other games where you can explore the world in 3D and I just always came back to neopets.   I remember when I first signed up for neopets, there was also this other pet site that had 3d dogs and stuff that I signed up with as well and everything was just so... Strange. I don't think I played it for about two weeks before I quit.   Also, now neopets may look ""outdated"" but it runs off nostalgia.  Older people are coming back and heavin sighs of relief that, art-wise, not too much has changed."
neopets,3bvz8q,khaleesibitchborn,0,Thu Jul 2 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"I think that is true, but I am not saying every part of the site has to be 3D. The comics, games, etc would probably be better with the 2D. I don't know, I just feel like this site can't survive on nostalgia alone. When a kid from today's generation comes on, it just looks so dated. I think a good 3D art direction (or even a direct adaption of the current style) could make it more timeless and easier to update. I don't know why people would be upset to see their Neopet animated and making facial expressions in real time. Some of the current designs look like users plastered them in clothing to hide how weird they look to begin with."
neopets,3bvz8q,maria1593,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:47:29 2015 UTC,"Through my occasional traipses into high quality 3D MMORPGs (e.g. Aion) my standards for 3D gaming have shot through the clouds. I'm sure it's that way for many other gamers too. Jumpstart can't do that with a browser game, and I wouldn't play Neopets if it were a) not a browser game or b) low quality 3D.  To be honest with you when it comes to 3D gaming I'm waiting until the Oculus Rift and other AWESOME technology is widespread and affordable!! I want to be able to feel like I'm IN the world.  For me it's either 2003 nostalgia quality or all-out virtual life quality"
neopets,3bvz8q,pixellestix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:20:30 2015 UTC,Oh hell no! That would be hell on my laptop (it's useless for anything 3D).
neopets,3bvz8q,mandylola,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:29:55 2015 UTC,I could barely play Keyquest on my laptop. I can't imagine the whole website on 3D.
neopets,3bvz8q,Franseil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:08:50 2015 UTC,I like the new Pokemon games and I think the landscapes/buildings/etc are beautiful but I hate the designs of the actual Pokemon. So if that's the standard for 3D creatures...no.
neopets,3bvz8q,makairia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:39:28 2015 UTC,They can barely keep up with the dated stuff they've got now.  I'd hate to see the mess if they tried 3D.
neopets,3bvz8q,aredshroom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:10:24 2015 UTC,No. :c
neopets,3bvz8q,UhOhFeministOnReddit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:32:15 2015 UTC,"I have some vision problems that prevent me from enjoying 3D specifically, but I don't think I'd mind an overhaul of the art in general. It doesn't have to be cutting edge or anything, but I'd appreciate a lot less childishness with the site. I never got Neo marketing to kids. Even at the height of its popularity at 25,000,000 users, I think only roughly half a million were below 10.   I want more mature and sleek art. The one thing that has always bothered me about Neo is how childish it can be. I'm not embarrassed to admit I play so much as I'm tired of justifying it. The site would get a lot more players if it just grew up and decided to tell the kids to buzz off."

neopets,3bv7pu,fancygrandpa,9,Thu Jul 2 13:32:42 2015 UTC,"Where swearing is not only allowed, but encouraged! FUCK!"
neopets,3bv7pu,diceroll123,9,Thu Jul 2 22:20:20 2015 UTC,That's pretty much how I feel as well.   -high fives-
neopets,3bv7pu,khonrichan,6,Thu Jul 2 13:42:25 2015 UTC,"^  this. I've been in a handful of guilds and I'm in /u/cheryllium's right now (or at least last I checked) but it's just a drag to have to click so many times to get to messages and then if the messages go for multiple pages, I just give up. I'd rather have a system like this where it's a full blown page that I can save posts, reply to specific threads and not have to keep paging back to see what the original post was, etc. I'm lazy, what can I say :x"
neopets,3bv7pu,roxychalk,3,Thu Jul 2 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"Same. The only guild I might be interested in joining is a customization one, but even then I'd prefer a sub for it on here, hahah."
neopets,3bv7pu,lafl,9,Thu Jul 2 15:29:04 2015 UTC,"Personally my main thing with guilds is I don't devote a consistent amount of time to Neopets, causing either them or myself to say ""this isn't working out"". I think it just comes with adulthood.   That being said when I was in a guild, the message boards were always such a drag. I really feel like it's a neglected area of the site (what isn't tho?)."
neopets,3bv7pu,floppy_catfish,3,Thu Jul 2 12:49:17 2015 UTC,"I've never been very great at them myself.  Like, I'm good at socializing when it's simply chatting (e.g. chat groups, forums), but when it comes to guilds, I just can't devote the right amount of time."
neopets,3bv7pu,buslobe,-5,Thu Jul 2 13:17:46 2015 UTC,It sounds like you've never joined the right guild.
neopets,3bv7pu,Turbobutts,8,Thu Jul 2 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'd like them to do a massive purge of abandoned guilds for a start. There is some there untouched for 10+ years, like my old 'Tokyo Mew Mew' guild.  I would like it if they'd actually notify you when someone posts though."
neopets,3bv7pu,treacledormouse,7,Thu Jul 2 14:36:14 2015 UTC,"I think getting notification when someone posts would be a good step to making Neopian guilds an active gathering place.  I'm in a guild now and I like most of the people in there but it's just-- idk, kinda pointless.  And since I found out my favorite guild mate is on this sub I go to the guild even less.  Ho hum."
neopets,3bv7pu,everythingshines,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:45 2015 UTC,I'm your favorite? :D Its because of Roo isnt it?

neopets,3bv7pu,everythingshines,2,Thu Jul 2 15:25:06 2015 UTC,Among other things.  :)
neopets,3bv7pu,everythingshines,2,Thu Jul 2 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"I agree--getting a notification would be a great way to ramp up activity. I always post in my guild, forget I posted, and then remember to check like two days later. Frustrating."
neopets,3bv7pu,ostentia,6,Thu Jul 2 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"Guilds? They're good when the boards are down. But do you mean guilds specifically, or any semi-regular gathering of people? Like, say, a chatgroup?  In all honesty, I've never really understood the point or appeal of guilds. What is it exactly that guilds want new members for? What do new members want to join a guild for?"
neopets,3bv7pu,Superkouza,4,Thu Jul 2 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"I never liked them either, which is why I am rank ""Dont want to be"" in ""a guild; stop asking me""  highly recommend"
neopets,3bv7pu,maria1593,2,Thu Jul 2 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"I'm in a guild, however, I enjoy being in it.   But the thing about our guild is, we don't even use the guild function. We don't recruit, we don't even do anything that would constitute being in a guild aside from being a community of people who hang out together. We wouldn't know what to do with a real guild if we caught one. What would we recruit for? How do you finish the sentence ""Join our guild because...?"""
neopets,3bv7pu,Superkouza,6,Thu Jul 2 22:31:10 2015 UTC,I typed a long winded tangential wall of self indulgent text regarding guilds and have opted to delete it.  The problem I see with guilds is that there are too fucking MANY. People who would make good guildmates are either lost in shit guilds or are turned off from them entirely because they don't know where to start with joining a good guild.   The guild I'm in has roughly 10 members who are active every day and they fill up about a page and a half while I'm at work every day. I love it so much.
neopets,3bv7pu,Turbobutts,2,Thu Jul 2 13:22:39 2015 UTC,Aww that sounds nice!
neopets,3bv7pu,aveforever,2,Thu Jul 2 13:46:06 2015 UTC,"I prefer small tight knit guilds.  I loved my guild but they keep inviting new people trying to get 70+ members with constant new members, some of the new ones leaving and I'm just like.. the introvert says no haha."
neopets,3bv7pu,mobscenes,2,Thu Jul 2 15:18:41 2015 UTC,"My guilds are part of the only reason I come on neo; but that's because I love writing and have been roleplaying ever since I joined the site almost 10 years ago. Sure it's a certain niche in the neopets community, but roleplayers will often seek guilds just because rping on the boards is a headache with the tiny post limit."
neopets,3bv7pu,IronDirewolf,2,Thu Jul 2 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"Tried it out once, it was semi-active but super mundane. The guild dissolved when the admins figured out most members werent 18+ and invited me to their new exclusive version, but I take infrequent hiatuses because of school and didnt see much point.   The whole system needs a modern and fresh revamp though, it still screams 2003. I would like to see maybe a group chat window that you could look at on other areas of the site or minimize- like the fb or g-chat windows"
neopets,3bv7pu,6thninja,2,Thu Jul 2 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"I've always loved the concept of guilds, but I can never really get involved in one no matter how hard I try. I think it's just because I prefer a more casual, lax setting like r/neo, where you can jump into a conversation when the conversational topic appeals to you but you aren't obligated to stick around and talk if you don't want to, and otherwise you can be inactive for like a month and it doesn't matter.  If guilds got a revamp to where the boards could be more like the Neoboards or more like this subreddit, like to where people could start their own topics and whatnot, I think I'd be much more likely to stay active in one. I grew up on a lot of different proper forums so I just tend to feel really out-of-place jumping into conversation when there's only one place for people to talk, especially in really active, large guilds.  That's just me, though! I'm not sure if they're a thing of the past necessarily, but they certainly are to me because my job significantly lessens any activity I could have in a guild to begin with haha."
neopets,3bv7pu,proudprince,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:28:35 2015 UTC,My guild is half the reason I come on Neo.
neopets,3bv7pu,Kniste,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"i used to love guilds, but i'm not always super active and chatty on neo which is a problem in most guilds. plus there's normally a lot of pressure to do x amount of activities per month, which can be inconvenient when you're busy."

The theme I went with is Wizard of Oz inspired, that she's stuck in a storybook/fairytale type world and with the help of some friends, she's trying to find a way out.  I really like this custom and the story behind it, but I feel like it's lacking. Any suggestions would be great!  Also, I would love to see any other Plushie Poogle customs you have! I'm definitely not sticking to this one for forever, but I can't really seem to make another custom for her that inspires me. I like fantasy/toy/candy type themes for Plushies, but any ideas would be great!  tl;dr: show me your plushie Poogle customs you've come up with to inspire me!"
neopets,3bvh6t,fayge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:21:19 2015 UTC,"First of all, what you have is great. You have a lot going on, but it all works well together.  I tried making her outfit a different color and I think it fits the theme better. The Sideswept Blonde Wig looks a bit better, but it's a bit more expensive so I used a cheaper substitute. You could do with or without the gloves."
neopets,3bvh6t,MellyGirl123,2,Fri Jul 3 07:10:43 2015 UTC,"I really love the outfit, thank you! It's adorable and makes her stand out more. All the blue I had blended in a bit too much into the background.   I might also take out the faeire dust to make it less busy."
neopets,3bvh6t,fayge,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:16:31 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. Glad I could help!

Her theme is kind of difficult. It's a fantasy dessert warrior/explorer theme. I would prefer mostly NP items, but I can do some NC. Thank you!"

neopets,3bvh6t,namelessfeline,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"Here's my attempt.  Wow, this one was a bit harder than I thought. I only used one NC item, but it really ties the outfit together (it's pretty cheap too). I like the desert paintbrush the best, so I went off the assumption that you had all the pb items for it. The Looming Balthazar Shadow is 180k on the TP, but you could go without it if needed."

neopets,3bvh6t,MellyGirl123,2,Tue Jul 7 20:52:30 2015 UTC,Hello! I have a male pirate krawk named after my favourite soccer/football club and I need a bit of help dressing him up. I was thinking mostly AC gear but there might be better alternatives out there to make him look like a soccer player. I'm willing to have a couple pieces of NC items but mostly looking for NP. Any help is appreciated!
neopets,3bvh6t,CountBasil,2,Thu Jul 2 14:43:40 2015 UTC,Here's a pretty simple one if you don't mind trading for the NC:  http://impress.openneo.net/outfits/943772  You can change it up on your team colors of preference.
neopets,3bvh6t,marissalea93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:53:27 2015 UTC,Thank you! Time to track down those NC items. :)

I tend to change her outfit about once a week NP only + I (currently) have island, rg, and usuki girl clothes.    I decided I was sick of her being a kacheek, but now I'm out of inspiration for her as an usul ;-; I think my first problem is I can't pick a color I like. I want her to have the tan body, but I don't like the eyes on the royals. :/ So I'll happy take suggestions on color too!"
neopets,3bvh6t,Dauchy,3,Thu Jul 2 14:51:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if any of these are crazy unbuyables but, if you're looking for something more girly, I threw this together.  -edit-  This one works with island (but feels like it's missing something red) and with speckled"

neopets,3bvh6t,MageKessu,2,Thu Jul 2 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not opposed to leaving her island, I'm just not a big fan of the green flowers in her collar. I love that look though! That wig is great."
neopets,3bvh6t,Dauchy,2,Thu Jul 2 15:34:44 2015 UTC,"Here is one without the ruff. Unfortunately, the shirt looks a bit awkward without something covering it."
neopets,3bvh6t,MageKessu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I think, for the usul native clothes, the ruff works. But for anything else, it looks out of place. I feel like I HAVE to do an island/flower theme with it."

neopets,3bvh6t,Garettesky,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:13:18 2015 UTC,Thank you! I love the beard! :O Do you think the np items are expensive?
neopets,3bvh6t,Ixiholic,2,Fri Jul 3 08:09:38 2015 UTC,"That, I am not sure D:  But it's a Y15 special, so might as well buy it before it inflates into absurd price."

Pirate Bori clothes are available.  May put 200NC into a customization if need be but would prefer not to. Thank you for your help! ;u;"
neopets,3bvh6t,akaikane,2,Thu Jul 2 16:07:15 2015 UTC,Here's Toebey.  I don't think an Island Bori needs much. The really cool design on it makes clothing seem unnecessary. I only really used accessories and a background. All of this totals to be less than 20k NP (not including the paintbrush items).  Hope you like it :)
neopets,3bvh6t,MellyGirl123,2,Thu Jul 2 23:26:03 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thank you! I like the items you've accessorized him with. I'll have to paint him real soon so I can use this idea. Thanks again! <3"

neopets,3bvh6t,venv,2,Thu Jul 2 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I made one for your Aisha. It's pretty good, but there are some AMAZING np backgrounds that are pretty pricey that make this custom look great. Try the Creepy Darigan Citadel Background (600k) or the Ultimate Battlefield Background (950k)."

neopets,3bvh6t,khaleesibitchborn,2,Thu Jul 2 19:16:59 2015 UTC,I'm new to this whole customization thing and currently only have random backgrounds and zero theme.  Anyone have advice for what to do with a Strawberry JubJub? I want to get a field-like background for her probably. But it seems to me like JubJub's fashion choices are quite limited with their rather circular shape...  I've also got an Orange Koi that I originally wanted to paint Disco but haven't it done yet. I'm a little more attached to the orange than expected. Any thoughts?
neopets,3bvh6t,michellebell42,2,Thu Jul 2 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"Dunno if you like NC items, so I tried to avoid them. Here is one for your Strawberry Jubjub. There are a few NC items hidden away in there that might look nice. Also I vote for Disco Koi. They are quite colorful. Also have a random squid koi because... idk."
neopets,3bvh6t,MageKessu,2,Thu Jul 2 23:07:43 2015 UTC,Thanks! They look great!!! I'll be using some of your ideas haha. (I especially enjoy the squid koi of course) :)
