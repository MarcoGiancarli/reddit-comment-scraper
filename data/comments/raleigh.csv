raleigh,3e4a8h,11_25_13_TheEdge,2,Tue Jul 21 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"I think it might depend on what happens with downtown, ultimately. If the suburbs grow more than downtown can keep up with attracting people into the city, then growth might occur more toward the edges of the city/in other hotspots like North Hills and the inverse could happen. Having lived in cities where all the action migrated from downtown out to the suburbs, downtown Raleigh seems like it's doing pretty well so I'm not sure."

raleigh,3e4a8h,bwirth2,2,Tue Jul 21 23:43:12 2015 UTC,You're missing the many black neighborhoods of East Raleigh. Walk east from Moore Square and yuppified downtown ends fast.
raleigh,3e4a8h,plenty_of_time,2,Wed Jul 22 02:49:56 2015 UTC,"True that. But if the developers have their way, they'll all be priced out within a decade."
raleigh,3e4a8h,Pichus_Wrath,2,Wed Jul 22 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"The attractiveness of Downtown Raleigh is a relatively new phenomenon.  Outside of a handful of bars around State, 42nd Street and a couple of other places (I.e. the Fallout Shelter) there really was very little going on Downtown up until about 15 years ago.  This has definitely changed for the better."
raleigh,3e4a8h,Thundershirtrumble,2,Wed Jul 22 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"Property value wise, absolutely. No question about it. Location, location, location. You pay a lot more ITB, and your single family home also appreciates much more rapidly. The lack of inventory is very real. OTB, you can just keep going five minutes further out until you start bleeding from the eyes, lost in suburban hell.  For me, it's the traffic that just makes me want to avoid going OTB at all costs. It's so much more difficult to get around and you often have absolutely nothing in walking distance. Additionally, if you're raising a family, I don't think you can top the prestige of the ITB schools. Yes, there are some other good schools, but it's definitely a factor. The well off white people will never be settling for sending their kids to crappier schools. And whether or not people will openly admit it, they typically don't want their kids going to a school with kids who don't come from good families with parents who can provide and stay very involved.   Attitude wise, a lot of it comes down to Raleigh natives versus transplants. Most of the northerners coming down here are OTB, so it can be a different vibe. These people come from long ass commutes, so driving 45 goddamn minutes to work is nothing to them if they can have some new construction with 2,500 sq ft, stainless steel appliances, and a two car garage in a cookie cutter suburb for $250K.  Like everything, it just comes down to priorities, but I don't see the significant distinction between the boundary lessening any time soon. I know I pay a lot more for a smaller house than I would going a few miles further out, but there's a real quality of life ITB that I don't think can be matched anywhere else around here for a single guy in his 20s."

Good luck finding your kitty man, feel free to pm me if you have other questions about the shelter.  And, make absolutely sure you go to the WAKE COUNTY Animal Center. Not the SPCA. They are two different things. WCAC is the only intake facility for stray animals in our county.   Other things that can help: leave food and an article of clothing that smells like you or Finnegan outside, like on the porch. Familiar smells can help him find his way home.

Otherwise, is public transportation an option?  Even for a couple of months you could live gas and insurance free and get some cash built up to buy something a little better.  Finally, there are certainly places that will finance a car for you with no credit, but they're going to charge you out the ass in interest.

raleigh,3dxyp6,seven3turbo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:35 2015 UTC,It's been a while since i've been but i had taken my car with about 33% tint to this Jiffy Lube and they gave me no trouble.  Didn't charge for the test and let me on my way.  The one across the street is more particular so make sure you go to the one on the northbound side of glenwood.
raleigh,3dxyp6,Yville,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:59 2015 UTC,Smaller shops will be more lenient in my experience. As long as it's not crazy dark (darker than 10%)
raleigh,3dxyp6,seven3turbo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:42 2015 UTC,"Go to the peace street inspection in Raleigh. If it has four wheels, it will pass. Always."
raleigh,3dxyp6,Kaiuk,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:15 2015 UTC,Really? Because they weren't going to let my husband's car pass due to blue halogen lights. His car doesn't have blue halogen and i had to convince him of such.
raleigh,3dxyp6,thursd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:09 2015 UTC,Even if the check engine light is on? That's my issue. And it's all exhaust system crap that pretty much can't be fixed for less than my car is worth. >:(
raleigh,3dxyp6,mellowbordello,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:11 2015 UTC,If it's 95 or newer nobody will pass it with check engine light on. They plug into OBDII which will fail it automatically. Pre 95 you'll be good
raleigh,3dxyp6,seven3turbo,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"Trust me, you'll be fine"
raleigh,3dxyp6,Kaiuk,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:42 2015 UTC,"No, depending on how old the car is (newer than '94 maybe?) they will not pass it with a CEL on.  Pretty much anything else they will pass, but that one is hard and fast, nobody but your cousin Billy Bob will pass with a CEL on."
raleigh,3dxyp6,jnecr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"All I really know is that, no matter what, you have to pay $10 for window tint. Stupid I think."
raleigh,3dxyp6,rubbing_lilies,0,Mon Jul 20 13:29:50 2015 UTC,Throw the person inspecting it $20. There should also be a time period before you need the car inspected and property tax due. May have time to get it removed if you don't want it.
raleigh,3dw6a1,dharmaticate,5,Mon Jul 20 01:09:42 2015 UTC,You could......call them and ask.

raleigh,3dw6a1,lorditchy,4,Mon Jul 20 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"yes, they do. they usually have a few extra of some other flavors still around too."
raleigh,3dw6a1,rtphokie,2,Mon Jul 20 06:11:44 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer
raleigh,3dw6a1,fusionary93,5,Mon Jul 20 10:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. The flavor of the day is packed into a certain amount of pints/quarts every day, depending on expected demand. More popular flavors will run out faster, so if you're looking for a specific flavor, call ahead and ask. You can also always go on the day of the flavor you want and have them pack a fresh pint/quart for the same price. Also keep in mind that they are only good for 1 month from their pack date  because its custard (no preservatives).   Source: worked there for a couple summers."

raleigh,3dwb3q,ichliebespink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:52:26 2015 UTC,I and many people I now know in Raleigh got jobs here while living in other states. That shouldn't be an issue of you're willing to do phone & Skype interviews and can travel for a final interview.   This area has a range from downtown luxury apartments / condos to suburban neighborhoods to country homes with lots of land. Depends on what you want and what kind of commute you'll do.
raleigh,3dwb3q,itz_working,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely want more country that suburban. I'm not sure what kind of commutes I will be looking at. In DFW, my commute right now is literally 5 minutes. However, I know some jobs it can be as long as 50 minutes. Location, location, location and all that jazz."
raleigh,3dwb3q,itz_working,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely want more country that suburban.   You're looking at an awful commute then if you're going into RTP for work and depending on what time you have to be at work. I'm pretty sure you'd be living outside of Raleigh if you want a more country type of area and that is what could kill the commute. Apex/Cary is a bit closer and has something to offer, but with a higher price range for housing."

Going home at 5PM is similar with bumper to bumper traffic. I can leave where I am at 7 (Wake Forest) and have a smooth drive in with no issues, but any later and it's awful.  If you use Google Maps they now have an option to set an ""Arrive by"" time and this will let you see typical traffic patterns on the route you have planned. I've found it to be fairly accurate."

Morrisville or Cary  I live in Brier Creek Raleigh (NorthEast  Raleigh 540 and Glenwood).  It seems very attractive to people as they first come here because it has a fn massive shopping center, with every possible thing you could want, right in the center.  It looks clean, and central to everything.  Do not live here!  Rents and home costs are high relative to what you can get elsewhere, and you will wish you had laser shooting eyes to destroy all the BMW's that have housewives in them txting Their SO's about their recent shopping experience.  This wish will be aggravated when you are running late for work.  A very good friend of mine recently moved down from DC Metro.  We looked at 19 houses in 1 day (no shit) and the best ones were in the towns of Morrisville and Cary.  Our city lines are so fucked up that you'll probably cross 5 or 6 of them on your way to work, so dont think too much about the names.  It's all ""Raleigh-Durham"" in the sense that we are a city.  If youre young and successful, which I assume you are since you haven't killed yourself yet according to my instructions, then you definitely want Cary.  Thats where the stodgy, future wealthy elite live.  I know this because I dated an Ivy league girl there, who was hit by a train (or at least I hope so).  All the young professionals want to live in Cary (Weston Parkway to be exact).  Ill put my money where my mouth is and submit your resume to the fortune 100 I work for (along with my personal recommendation) IF you sing the pee-wee Herman part of this video once hired in RTP!"

I grew up in the country up there, but got moved down to Texas with my parents in the middle of my childhood. Now i just melt in the summer because the weather here blows. I'll definitely shoot my resume your way, and I can try my best to do this ""singing"" thing you speak of.   Either way it works out, thanks for the information!!"

In NC, notary publics cannot attest that something is a true copy, the most they can do is attest that you acknowledge or swear the document is a true copy.
