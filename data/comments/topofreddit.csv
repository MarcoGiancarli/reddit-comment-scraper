topofreddit,3bvaxx,topredditbot,3,Thu Jul 2 13:11:43 2015 UTC,"due 5 the original being removed:  Me [26F] and boyfriend [27M] have been together since our third year in university. Once we both graduated my boyfriend got a job across the country (Anaheim) and I followed him.  This weekend is my little sisters [24F] wedding. My sister and I have ALWAYS gotten along. It was really hard on both of us when I moved so far away, and we keep in contact literally everyday. She and my bf never really had any sort of a friendship simply due to the fact that they never spent much time together.  The first couple days we spent at my parents place, everything was normal. We landed around noon and spent the day with my family. My sister was running around meeting with caterers and stuff so she didn't get home until later in the evening. We said our usual hellos/caught up and then headed to bed. Monday morning is when things felt weird. I noticed immediately at breakfast my boyfriend and sister were much more talkative with each other than usual. I also noticed him giving her these weird ""looks"" and my sister smiling (smirking?) back. I didn't think too much of it, but then after lunch they announced they would be going to meet the wedding planner. The planner was in Brooklyn and my boyfriend said wanted to check out a used game store there, so he was going to tag along. Okay cool. But when they got back (about 45 minutes later) he smelled like her perfume. Which isn't a huge deal because her car reeks of it and it could have just stuck on him I guess but it was still weird.  The next night I woke up around 2am and I noticed my boyfriend was not in bed. I waited a couple minutes and when he didn't come back I got up to look for him. Right as I opened my room door he was getting ready to walk back inside. He looked SHOCKED to see me, and when I asked where he was, he gave me mumbling answer about throwing something in the garbage. I noticed again he smelt like my sisters perfume, but I didn't say anything. He brushed past me to the bathroom located in our room and turned on the tap. I heard him washing his face and brushing his teeth. So today (Wednesday) I noticed my BF and sister weren't going near each other. As much as they'd been getting along the last few days they were keeping their distance. I ask both of them separately if everything is okay and both assured me everything was fine. Even asking ""why are you asking if I'm okay?"". When we went to bed tonight I decided to pretend to sleep and see what my BF did. Around 11:30 he called my name a couple times, to which I did not respond. I then heard him get up, and creep out of bed. I waited until he was outside the door and then followed him. I saw him walk into the bathroom across the hall. I waited in my doorway for a minute and then I saw my sister come out of her room, and walk into the same washroom. I have no idea what to do. Do I go to my sisters fiancee? My parents? Confront them? I am currently hiding in the living room and it has been about 2 hours since this happened. My boyfriend has not come looking for me yet tl;dr: my boyfriend and I are staying with my family. Saw him and my engaged sister in a compromising position when they walked into a bathroom together. They don't know I caught them, no clue how to proceed  EDIT: so we have this little stair landing area with a couch. You can see the upstairs hallway pretty clearly. I was sitting there with my phone and a blanket when my sister walked out of her room and into the bathroom. About 3 minutes later my bf walked in. The bathroom ""locks"" are the type you can unlock with the turn of a coin. I stood outside for literally 10 minutes and I heard almost nothing. Just some shuffling here and there. So I open the door quietly and I see my sister on the bathroom counter looking at something on her phone. My boyfriend has half his body out the bathroom window. My sister jumped off the counter and said my name and my BF pulled his head back. He had a pipe in his hand. It turns out they've been sneaking around because they've been weed buddies the last couple days. I had no clue they were smoking together. Or that my sister smoked at all. The first night we were here, he was going downstairs to get a glass of water and smelled the pot when he walked past her bathroom. He asked her about it the next day and thats when they started to smoke together. He smelled like her perfume because they wanted to spray something to get the pot smell off them. Thats why he washed his face and brushed his teeth when he came back into the room last night, so I wouldn't smell the weed on him. They was being so sneaky about it because little sis was unsure that I would approve about of her marijuana habit. I don't care at all. I knew my BF is a casual smoker since the day we met. Very relived to say the least. Thank you all for your help. I feel like a complete idiot. Sorry for wasting your time.  UPDATE tl;dr: I feel silly. BF and sister were sneaking around because they smoke weed together, not because they were having sex. Little sis wasn't sure I would approve of her smoking weed so they were being secretive."
