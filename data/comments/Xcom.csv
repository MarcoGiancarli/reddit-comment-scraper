Xcom,3e3wgi,avenger2142,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm torn about this. On one hand beagle is almost certainly the most knowledgeable LW player and he has a lot of good ideas...But on the other hand I have done some work as s game designer and I see some problems here. For example if aliens can take offensive actions on activation then you need to always be moving soldiers into cover, but what about maps or spawns with very limited cover. With 12 soldiers it means they will have to spread out....and with so many more aliens that means tons of activations. I think this will lead to players spending most of the mission on overwatch waiting for pods to patrol into them, especially with the increased patrol rate.  Still, very glad to see new ideas."

Having at least two in a squad saved me quite a lot of pain.  The bullet wizard is just there for clutch suppression when need be.  The result is that I need a lot more guys to field this specific approach so that's why a little over 1/3rd of all my dudes are gunners lol."

But even current shotguns, if you're aim-debuffed and shooting at something even not in full cover but with high innate defense, may not see a 100% chance to hit. I'm betting than melee weapons in XCOM 2 will share a similar trend. Against most enemies in most situations, it's a kill you can rely on, but if the soldier is trying to hit an incredibly hard-to-hit opponent while suffering penalties himself, he may actually miss the target.  I'm also hoping for specific enemies to have defense specifically typed against melee or ranged. Melee-proficient enemies would dodge more melee attacks but be perfectly shootable, while shooting enemies might be good at mitigating ranged fire even in the open and maintaining a Low Profile in cover (cough) but run at them with a sword and it doesn't help them at all."

Xcom,3dzak6,MacroNova,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:05 2015 UTC,I assume this means all melee based attacks that could not miss in  Xcom:EU/EW can now miss? Or just certain types of melee attacks? We'll find out.

Xcom,3dzak6,keysersoze1015,5,Mon Jul 20 23:23:35 2015 UTC,...That sounds like a bug to me. They are definitely 100% chance to hit all the time. You are a lucky bastard.
Xcom,3dzak6,ShadoowtheSecond,4,Tue Jul 21 00:43:48 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that melee attacks don't even run to-hit calculations. That's either a bug or a lie.
Xcom,3dzak6,Stormhunter117,3,Tue Jul 21 00:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think so either. I know the MEC one doesn't, but you select a direction instead of a target. I know you select targets with chrysalids and berserkers, like you would when firing a weapon."

Xcom,3dzak6,rUSSNDRAGN,0,Tue Jul 21 05:28:53 2015 UTC,Hard to see how melee will be useable then. Unless melee engagements can be multi turn and you count as in cover to other ranged troops and can block the aliens counter strikes.That would be cool.

Xcom,3e31i7,Firoso,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:03 2015 UTC,"xenobio & alien containment is fine, I suggest go for laser inmediately afterwards (for the laser cannon), and then just 80-90% focus on airgame."

Xcom,3e31i7,Baturinsky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"Early captures means early interrogations, thus early psi + research credits."
Xcom,3e31i7,UristImiknorris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"i never tried to rush for containment, and captures are freaking hard for me even when half of squad have surpression and engineers have tons of arc thrower uses.  is it because i suck, or it's easier in the begining?"
Xcom,3e31i7,newbstier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:27 2015 UTC,"Captures are easiest when you bring lots of flashbangs, suppression, a lieutenant (to get double arc throws in 1 turn), and acid grenades makes it the easiest of all. Don't ever flank a suppressed/flashbanged target, because they'll run and make it harder to capture.   Finally, I'd only try on light missions and some crashed UFOs where the alien density is low. You don't want another pod wandering into you and screwing up your cap attempt."
Xcom,3e31i7,LugganathFTW,3,Tue Jul 21 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"I would suggest doing alien weaponry second. Scopes are nice, and it starts requests for engineers.   I think if you also focus on expanding your sat network, its probably doable. I'm of the opinion that anything other than a beam laser start is more advanced and requires a better tactical game."
Xcom,3e31i7,bilfdoffle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"I believe I have a good tactical game, that's the thing :)  With that being said, if I go the alien weaponry route and go straight to beams, should I also go straight for laser cannons?

Xcom,3e31i7,avenger2142,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:30 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that if he has good tactical game on normal he have good tactical game on normal. The captive rush is obviously for the credit to breeze through research later on. Though I agree its not good idea.
Xcom,3e31i7,Scoobz1961,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, in vanilla, but in LW the time for interrogations was increased, therefore it doesn't save you much time."

Xcom,3e31i7,stephanovich,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"Oh right that came back, that would help. Still those first few months are critical so yeah, bad plan IMO."
Xcom,3e31i7,bilfdoffle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"Xeno first to get sectoid corpse request obviously. If you go this route and have the weapon fragments for it, then yeah. Go for Adv. Beam Lasers. Early laser cannons is only a good thing. Then you can go for armor or captures. Once you reach the late summer/early fall, some air game foundry upgrades will help you a lot.  For the base...if you are on a 3 country continent, going for an uplink and 2 sats isn't a bad idea. A lab or two in April or May will help nicely once you have a few extra scientists from requests. Get 6 or more interceptors though. You will need them."
Xcom,3e31i7,cydus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"If you're getting regular lasers, it makes sense (to me) to get laser cannons.   Otherwise, I'd grab weaponry and move on. Either plan on skipping lasers (getting gauss as soon as you get a muton captive) or getting them as soon as you get a thin man captive. The point of rushing captures is to try and avoid researching anything that you could have with a credit."
Xcom,3e31i7,slothen2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:19 2015 UTC,This kinda thing would be so helpful when starting out. I'm on my 4th try now and have made it past the summer and doing alright. Too few troops and researched erratically though.
Xcom,3e31i7,Scoobz1961,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the point of early captures.  its a research sink and a resource sink with the power requirements.  And there's not too much point if your engineers aren't sergeant yet.  I start going for captures in the summer, but never something I would prioritize over lasers and phalanx.  Also now that you aren't passing up inspiration for mindfray and can have both, I'm finding mindfray helps a ton with captures."
Xcom,3e31i7,3two1letsjam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"Beam will always be the best thing no matter what. But there are some interesting suboptimal strategies that you could do if you want something new. Such as rushing gauss, carapace, satellite spam or MECs. If you go this way, I would suggest france as starting country. Pick xeno first, but change it to materials asap. That way you will get many engineers. As for the build plan, you would go uplink, sat, fission, (shiv if thats your thing). Hold on promoting any assaults/infantries after getting that sat over russia. You now have 2/3 satelites. When you get 20 engineers (late april) you can do second uplink and 3 satellites to cover whole NA at once (or africa I guess). Late may, mid june you will surely have atleast 30 engies for yet another uplink that will give you the rest of europe for the cash.  This will kickstart your sat coverage, meaning lot of UFOs, lot of resources and lot of money. All this regardless what you research after materials. The engineers and resources will help with whatever rush you would be going for."
Xcom,3e31i7,thisnameismeta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"The air game is the single most important thing. Period.   If you're good at this game, then you don't need tactical-related country bonuses. You need MONEY.  The two viable starts IMO:  Mexico for that early money.  China for money long time.  Either way,  Get 5 fliers on your sats ASAP. FIVE, not four.   Try to get 3 satellites up in the 3rd month to get Asia or NA bonus (depending on which you picked). Then max fliers, and 2 more on another continent waiting to swap in for that iffy period before your avionics projects are finished."

And if the ship is big enough to hold the new SkyRanger, it's likely going to also possibly hold a small team of intercept craft.  It's XCOM, there will be some kind of air game."

Xcom,3e0ouj,Kenkynein,2,Tue Jul 21 01:36:00 2015 UTC,"My experience with Classic was having my squaddie assault critkilled out of full cover by a Sectoid, so if there's one thing I can tell you, it's spam the fuck out of hunkering down even if you don't think you need it.  Also, try your very fucking best to either fight within a building, or at long, long range. The worst thing you can do is to have a shitton of X-Rays flank you (as the AI has a fetish for flanking apparently), in an open environment with mostly low cover. That's basically the recipe to a squad wipe.  Sectopods are huge, dumb, strengthy, and decidedly powerful, but the key to dealing with them (at least in my way) is to spam the living fuck out of your Heavies at them- who should ALL have gotten HEAT ammo. MECs also work, and they can do 18 damage (!) with a Kinetic Strike Module installed, when Sectopods have around 30 HP (I don't know if their 50 percent damage reduction applies to melee) Additionally, killing a Sectopod with a punch provides a nice melee combat cinematic if you didn't already know.  Finally, laser and plasma weapons just LOVE to break cover on suppression fire. My friend in multiplayer confirmed that a lot of the time, even a Sectoid Plasma Pistol will destroy the bus wall on Boulevard, or something weak like it when suppressed. As a result, if you try to suppress with a few, you may break an alien's cover and lead up to a fatal shot. Sectopods don't take cover of course, but this helps when you're facing 38 and 1/2 mutons and they're all hidden behind a single wooden fence that somehow counts as full cover."

Sectopods DO show up on the Base Assault if you put it off long enough (at least one does), though I can't remember if Elites do. Also note that Sectopods and possibly even an Ethereal will show up on the Base Defense two weeks later.  Heavies are key to taking out sectopods, as both HEAT ammo and Shredder are excellent (I'd say necessary). Assault-MECs with the KSM are also good (they'll still deal decent damage after it's halved, and they'll take less damage themselves at the short range).  A Headshot from that Plasma Sniper will also help a great deal, and Disabling Shot is very useful if you have it."

Check the Species Deployment in this page: http://ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=Alien_Deployment_%28EU2012%29   C) What is the best way to deal with Sectopods?    Shered rocket and Heat ammo. If this fail, keep the last shot for your Sniper to disable. Finish the work in the next turn.   D) How do you deal with late-game terror missions and UFOs?    Sectopods and Elites will be normal in terror missions. But a Squad with Titan and Plasma can take care.   E) What months do your games usually end on?   I just finished a Army of 4 run today. I think was in September.  Use Council and Exalt missions to level up the squadies. This is not LW, so use a sniper before squadsight for Cover Op. I used that tactic for level up a second sniper to become my MEC. With only 4 soldiers, its not easy to find room to rookies in the missions."

Long story short, yes, Muton Elites can spawn in a September Base Assault. Yes Sectopods can also spawn - in fact there's a fairly high chance of them spawning. The only aliens you're guaranteed to not see in a Base Assault are Outsiders and Ethereals, and you'll only encounter one Sectoid Commander, always alone (unless pods retreat to him).  By extension, yes, Sectopods and Muton Elites can also spawn in the Base Defense if you've staved it off that long, in addition to a chance for an Ethereal to spawn instead of a Sectoid Commander.   As far as I know if an Ethereal or Sectopod spawns in the Base Defense it will be in the last wave. I could likely be wrong on this, but that's the only time I've personally seen either pop up."

Xcom,3e0ouj,asdf11784,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"Bring ghost grenades. As many of them as you have seeker wrecks for.  A ghost grenade will make dealing with a sectopod trivial - just derp charge in with all of your characters and attack while keeping them all in AoE range of the ghost grenade (no need for cover) and with your last character make everyone invisible. If you really need to you can use another ghost grenade for a 3rd turn of attacking - but really, 2 full turns of attacking with no fear of retaliation should be more than enough to deal with all active enemies barring extreme circumstances.  Disabling shot on snipers or EMP on MECs are also good for dealing with sectopods, though EMP is a bit risky in most situations in that you might activate more pods in the process. More or less you just want to do something that prevents the sectopod from attacking altogether, and just brute force it."
Xcom,3e08f1,mdarena,4,Mon Jul 20 23:21:39 2015 UTC,"I haven’t gotten to MECs in beta 15 yet, so this is just based on theory crafting and my beta14 I/I campaign.  Goliaths  Rapid fire + heat is very strong. Large mechs go on overwatch when you trigger then, so you often won’t be able to use Light ‘Em Up. You will also be able to get 4 heat shots off with command. I personally go for the Goliath as my first MEC simply because it starts with Absorption Fields. It is such a key MEC ability no matter if you want to play offensively or defensively.   Valkyrie  Light ‘Em Up on MECs is great, since they have to worry about being flanked, but I also want to point that you can deal significant damage to mechtoids with Heat + Rapid Reaction + Opportunist. Their ability to hold a perimeter shouldn’t be underestimated.   Shogun  When fighting flying disks the shogun seems superior. Deadeye + Heat + Rapid fire is going to do a good job of shooting a cyberdisc out of the sky. They don’t seem to offer any advantage vs ground mechs, unless you are whiling to give up Absorption Fields for shedder ammo.  Heat Gunners  Their damage output vs mechs is good, relaying on cover vs mechs in the late can be dangerous. Grenades and even missed shots from late game mechs (especially the sectopod) can easily destroy your cover.   Heat rocketeers  Rocketeers takes a lot of foresight to use, but they can do great things for you. They won’t kill the big mech, but someone do need to take care of those six drones flying around and healing it. With javelin rockets you can do it from a safe range as well. A shredder rocket will not only kill the drones, but also open up the big mech for the rest of the team. Also don't miss out on the blaster launcher.  Archers  Archers are great. They can pull off a lot of interesting moves with long range mines and grenades. They only reason that I don’t use them personally is that I like the shredder rocket too much, and also the limited number of MEC suits available per mission.   Mayhem Snipers  Sure you can potential deal massive damage in one hit, but even if kill the mech you still have the drone swarm to deal with. Plus you are passing on disabling shot, it can be a life saver vs mechs.   Heat engineers  Even with bombard you need to get closer than is advised for a bio soldier without extra con. Plus often the drones and such fly too high for your grenades.   Conclusion  All three heat shooting MEC classes are great mech killers. Any advantage that one of them have over the other is purely situational. My personal strategy vs mechs in the late game is to shoot a shredder rocket at the group first to clear up the drone swarm and shred the large mech, then holo-target (and acid if available) and rapid fire with a heat ammo MEC. There are many effetive ways to handle mechs however."
Xcom,3e08f1,Wilckey,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:50 2015 UTC,Best mech busters are chem grenades. Heat gunners and rocketeers are also very useful in the early-mid game.  But by the time I get msgt mecs with suits that can actually tank I dont care about specialized heat troops at all because with advanced weapons and elite troops getting through alien dr is trivial anyway.

Xcom,3e08f1,slothen2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'm only just getting mecs in my b15 campaign, but so far I've only had pathfinders and a guardian, so no comment.  Heat Gunners - Workhorses.  The best.  Heat isn't even required as DT + shred does solid work with AP ammo.  I always recommend taking EC on the heat + rapid fire guys, because they'll be up close, the mobility point could be critical, and the aim does double work with rapid fire.  Mayhem is a fantastic perk, but its not my choice for guys hefting a SAW.  Mayhem Snipers - Snipers are good, but I don't know if mayhem is the perk that deserves special mention here, although more damage does give a way to power through dr.  Precision shot is pretty amazing vs big mecs regardless of what final perk you take.  ITZ will always proc off a mec kill, always works vs mec robot babies, and DT is better if you're just trying to do as much damage as possible.  Disabling shot is the ultimate anti-mec safety blanket.  The real power of the gauss long rifle is not in the heat damage (which is always exactly 3 damage, not exactly impressive if you can chem/shred the bastard first), but in the 30% extra crit vs hardened targets.  Engineers - chem is the best for killing big mec targets.  Not heat grenades.  Heat grenades are okay for seekers/drones, but even then I'd rather just have a rocketeer.  Chem lowers robot aim and mobility and makes their DR a total non-issue for the rest of your troops.  I'm sure you can do cool stuff with heat warheads and fire rocket, but personally if I'm taking heat warheads sapper and mayhem, I'd just go all in with tandem warheads instead.  Rocketeers - aside from the gunner, these are usually heat source #2 in my squad.  Super clutch, take out whole pods of drones/seekers.  Can bust through mecthoid shields while applying shred at the same time.  This works because heat damage is based on the rocket launcher type, so the heat portion is the same even if you fire a shredder, and its not reduced by distance to explosion either.  Heat gets a fantastic upgrade with the recoilless rifle, and becomes just ridiculous with the blaster launcher.  Javelin is usually the best choice if you've gone FitH."
Xcom,3e08f1,WoRmEnGiL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"I just looked up the tables. Rocket gets straight +3 with heat, recoiless +4 and Blaster launcher +6, which is great. Is that regardless of radius? That would make danger zone more attractive if you're bringing the rockets along as a pure anti-mech.  For engineers, EVERY grenade gets a measly +2 with HEAT. That makes Smoke and Mirrors and therefore Battlescanner more attractive vs. HEAT and Mayhem.   If the HEAT bonus is fixed regardless of radius from the center of the blast, that makes a HEAT Mayhem Rocket dedicated anti-mech build more attractive. Although Packmaster doesn't seem to give a second rocket, and the don't have room for a scope usually."

Xcom,3e0yq4,Potatoroid,4,Tue Jul 21 02:56:48 2015 UTC,"Long War b15f introduced quite a bit of personality into all of the MEC classes.   Archers are still good despite the AoE reduction, charge limitations and enemies now triggering upon mine placement; you can get Tandem Warheads and Mayhem which is a decent tradeoff.  There will be no more ubertanks, and you should know that SAA is now less attractive when stacked with Absorption Fields, so go for something else on the perk tree instead to increase your firepower.  I see Pathfinders as the best MEC class available. Give them Lightning Reflexes at MSGT. Seriously. You need someone to trigger overwatches without dying in ine or two hits, and you will doubly need them to take the first shot at boss Mechtoids or Sectopods with Reactive Targeting Sensors.  Jaegers are now ITZ specialists. Not convincing enough for me however, Snapshot snipers do the job a lot better with easier accessibility to height bonuses. You can't pick up both VPT and LnL as well.  Marauders are good flamers/fisters. Close Encounters at Specialist lets you shoot first then flame later. They have good survivability to boot, so chopping an Assault isn't exactly a bad idea.  Shoguns have interesting builds. For one they are the only class accessible to both specialised perk munitions (HEAT and Shredder) plus Light-em-up which can make them really good support troopers, especially with a Holo-targeter. Or you can go for a Charger Anti-armor Tank build, opting for Absorption Fields, Deadeye and Rapid Fire for a close-up anti-tank MEC.  Goliaths are quite a new concept. For the first time, XCOM has a Please-shoot-me-so-I-can-shoot-you-back unit build around Absorption Fields. Covering Fire+CCS+RTS with AFC is certainly an intriguing combination, and I might try one out on my next campaign."
Xcom,3e0yq4,psyschism,4,Tue Jul 21 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"RTS is a trap. I used it a bit in b14, and it never hit ANYTHING. The problem is, you have very limited control over who shoots your MEC first, and it usually is some very hard to hit target, like sectoids or heavy floaters or mutons in heavy cover or something. I avoid it like the plague. All it does is drain 1 ammo for no gain."

Xcom,3e0yq4,Silenus851,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"Meta changed and you are right that ""tanking"" isnt very good use of mecs now. First, it is pretty much lategame option, because you need t3 suit and second, it is not cost efficient at all as biosoldiers can do tanking for much less resources.  Imho in b15 mecs are best used as high damage high mobility troops that can strike where its necessary and eliminate opposition fast.   My favourites are pathfinders and in b15f jaegers too - in mobility suits. Pathfinders mean LONG blue move, free shot (probably flanking) and then LONG yellow move away or another two high damage (flanking) shots. Jaegers mean LONG blue move followed by ITZ rampage with 15 base damage weapon and big chance of crit and then yellow move to safety or reload.  Best thing for both jaeger and pathfinder is they actually work from spec and t1 suits and they level FAST unlike some other mecs that get their multishot perk too late or depend on highend suits you probably wont get before winter."
Xcom,3e0yq4,lugalzagezi,2,Tue Jul 21 06:02:28 2015 UTC,"Guardians all the way. Give them the fastest suit (the one which gives 20 def), Tactical Sensors (for TacSense) and Battle Computer. Get them somewhere high, then Overwatch Sentinel Opportunist with their huuuge gun. Basicaly oversized version of overwatch infantry with absurd crit damage (one-shoting Heavy Floaties in late game, especially with Flak Ammo), yet very hard to hit (up to 48 defense in OPEN GROUND) and very mobile. Definitely my favourite MEC.  The other MEC I used to love are Shoguns. B15f introduced very creative way of making Shougn a mix of anti-tank support grenadier unit. HEAT ammo and Light 'em Up can waste mechtoids in no time, but also allows me to shoot then launch grenade on some ayyys. And having officer to command additional action it's just too good on Shogun. Very good MEC.  I never liked Archers, maybe due to Beagle's minespam, which I find effective, yet not very creative way of dealing with enemies. But, again, with command Archers become trurly worth their price. Just give them one mine launcher and grenade launcher. Launch mine first, then command, and launch grenade on the mine. Tandem Warheads and Danger Zone make insanely powerful explosion, and anything caught in the blast is almost instantly vaporized.  Goliaths in B15f are fun, but I'm afraid to throw them recklessly into the middle of enemies, where they apparently do their job best. Due to having lowest aim progression their overwatch build seems a bit pointless to me, so I'd rather have them become designated anti-mech unit with Rapid Fire and HEAT ammo, yet still being tough enough to take some returning fire.  Pathfinders are just stupidly good. Hit 'n Run being one of the most powerful perks in general becomes pure insanity on this MEC. Building them full dmg/crit and give the most mobile suit and you have ultimate hit 'n run blitzkrieg tactics unit one can possibly dream of.  Marauders are very fun too, yet I treat them mostly as tougher Pathfinders. I don't like MECs getting shot in general (despite I doubled their innate DR they still seem a bit too fragile for me), so Marauder is, again, hit and run unit for me.  Never had chance to use Valkyries or Jaegers. I rely on my infantry and snipers too much to afford turning them into MECs."
Xcom,3e0yq4,Cephalos666,2,Tue Jul 21 09:34:39 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: for your first mecs, chop some corporal reward soldiers into pathfinders and jaegers. For end game, chop your heat gunners.   My original plan was to use guardians as a tanking pair with tank assaults. The idea was to attract grenades (which should do little damage after DR), but I got scared after seeing reports of double digit damage grenades. And I'm really liking OW medics.  My favorite MECs are jaegers, pathfinders, and goliaths.   Jaegers: minimum is a mec-1, a corporal reward soldier with crap stats, and a railgun. If your snipers aren't up to ITZ yet, or even if they are, Jaegers are great. I sub them in for a support unit on terror missions and two ITZ units makes them a lot easier, particularly once your sniper starts flying. They get a battle computer, scope, and either tac sensors or a special ammo.   ITZ ->  sharpshooter    ->  Flush   ->  ranger  ->  squadsight  ->  beo ->  vpt  Pathfinder: minimum is a mec-1, a corporal reward soldier with crap stats, and a railgun. Great all around unit. H&R is very useful. I'll try to sub them in somewhere on most non-terror missions. This is the first unit in my games that gets lightning reflexes, since I swap it with scanners on my scouts. They get a battle computer, scope, and either tac sensors or a special ammo.   h&r ->  lone wolf   ->  flush   ->  ranger  ->  vpt ->  SS  ->  LR  Goliaths: minimum of 3rd tier mec, msgt gunner, particle cannon. Goliaths at MSGT are stupid powerful. Ranger + VPT + HEAT + RF + AP ammo gives stupid damage numbers vs. mechanicals. I rarely even need to rapid fire, as single hit damage vs. mech is guaranteed to be in the low 20's (upper 20's if shredded). They get a battle computer, scope, and AP ammo.   af  ->  flush   ->  ranger  ->  repair  ->  VPT ->  HEAT    ->  RF  I'm interested in valkyries, but I'd have to make them out of sgt reward soldiers (I don't plan on using infantry anytime soon).   I want to like shoguns, but I still haven't figured out a good build, and I don't have that many engineers.   I've never gotten into proxy mines, and don't intend to start anytime soon, so no archers.   I don't have extra assaults, nor do I particularly like the marauder tree. Not that the tree is bad, it's just too risky for me."
Xcom,3e0yq4,bilfdoffle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:10 2015 UTC,The marauder tree has one problem for me.  Absrption Fields and Run and Gun on the same rank. If they were on seperate ranks I'd only field marauders :P  I am in fact thinking about swapping AF and VPT in the Marauder tree..
Xcom,3e0yq4,WoRmEnGiL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:52 2015 UTC,I heard you mention you dont use infantries before. Would you please collaborate on the reason?
Xcom,3e0yq4,Scoobz1961,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"For more info, you can see my builds here.  Basically, infantry they don't excel in anything I need in my squad.  SAW gunner - notable for HEAT, suppression, flush, and RF. They turn goliath in the late game.  LMG gunner - bullet wizard build. long range suppression is very useful for dealing with covering fire. And double tap from the air is really good as well. They also make great psions.   Scout - I swapped lightning reflexes and battlescanners on the tree, and use them for recon and support grenades. Concealment is fantastic once you get the hang of it. Next run through will get packmaster instead of S&M, so they can have a second arc thrower charge as well. I made them officers this time, but I'm going to make them support psi next time. They are also my covert operatives.  sniper - ITZ. Squadsight is amazing. They go psi for the scopes (and psi inspiration).  Rocketeer - overwatch and explosives. They'll be my officers next time.  medic - overwatch and healing. Love the new savior. I didn't psi them this time, because I was going to MEC them. But I will psi them next time - not sure if attack or support though.   assault - tanking and face melting. Also make great psions.   engineers - cover destruction. I was also making mid game smoke engineers, but I stopped using them in favor of pathfinders and jaegers. They'll be low on the list to become support psi. I run them with an arc rifle.   Base raids pick up a second assault, and will bring both a MEC and a engineer.   Summary - assault tanks and pushes up as needed. Suppression, squadsight, and rockets deal with overwatch. The gunners deal with mechanicals. When the rocketeer and medic hit TSGT (opportunist), flush gets amazing. Assaults and scouts are my capture specialists (they're up close and personal already). It seemed to work well in this game, but I'll see how much I was actually reloading when I run bronzeman next time."
Xcom,3e0yq4,bilfdoffle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"I can see where you are coming from. With 2 RR OW you really dont need OW infantry. But would crit infantry not fit your team? For me next game I want to go suppression heavy, due to the big buff to it. I plan to do crit infantry with suppression and combine it with flush. I also plan to bring two gunners, but instead of leaving infantry, I wont be using engineers. Bringing Arc on rocketeers (ini edit).  I will be thinking about infantry place in squad now though."
Xcom,3e0yq4,Scoobz1961,2,Tue Jul 21 19:53:30 2015 UTC,"Early game, I want the sapper grenades, so engineers are decent. I'll still grab repair for early game captures, until I get mecs up and running. I could sub in corporal reward infantry sometime in the summer, I suppose, for even more overwatch.   Light em up seems powerful on paper, but in practice I find that I like to reposition too much to get enough use out of it."
Xcom,3e0sf6,xcomnewb15,3,Tue Jul 21 02:04:03 2015 UTC,Are you playing with Dynamic War?
Xcom,3e0sf6,klcams144,2,Tue Jul 21 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"If you are playing with dinamic war, then it is normal for exalt to take so long since the time was doubled for balance. It takes longer to exterminate exalt, but you get less exalt missions which is ok in my opinion. I even find it more fun to fight late game exalts.  The only problem I've found is that it is really hard to know when to scan since I keep forgetting when I had the last exalt mission. Usually I scan too early or I just forget to scan at all."
Xcom,3e0sf6,maddxav,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:30:34 2015 UTC,"The Special equipment items you get from the EXALT base are SOO useful, though. I never leave home without the Exalt SuperScopeTM and I will often take the neuroregulator on my psis if I can spare the slot."
Xcom,3e0sf6,Zinki_M,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:56:58 2015 UTC,"It is really good, and that is indeed a problem from dinamic war since I used to get that as soon as I built mecs. Now I'm about to build the Hyperwave Relay, and I still haven't dealt with exalt."
Xcom,3e0sf6,maddxav,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:02 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how this works with Dynamic War, but I use this mod to help me track my exalt scans. http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/595/? Otherwise, it is 7 days past each failed Exalt scan or 9 days after each successful covert op for normal. I believe that each time you adjust the difficultly, you need to scan one day sooner, which is adjustable in the mod."
Xcom,3e0sf6,TheCiroth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:00 2015 UTC,I am having the same problem not a mission up to 17th September last mission was 30th August. Have tried to intel scan but no exalt found. Playing on normal not Dynamic war.
Xcom,3dyknm,kann_,5,Mon Jul 20 16:14:10 2015 UTC,So the Jaegar is the next super tank... Trying not to make a reference to attack on Titan or Pacific Rim...
Xcom,3dyknm,Lawgamer411,4,Mon Jul 20 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"Well, every MEC trooper has access to ATA, DC, Repair Servos and Absorption fields (with the exception of ATA on the Pathfinder), so you can make a somewhat tanky MEC trooper out of just about anyone. The thing is that you sacrifice a lot of utility and offensive potential in doing so. Perks like Bring Em On, Danger Zone, Sentinel, Covering Fire and HEAT Ammo have to be given up in order to get those tanky perks on quite a few classes.   Not even the Goliath is immune to this, but still has the best potential since they have access to all the tank perks+Steadfast, if you want a ""super-tank""."
Xcom,3dyknm,medieva1man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"Steadfast is a good point, but the Jaeger can stay close to the Officer.. should be fine.  You focus on the lost opportunities, while I think the question should be what utilities the Tank has. From that point of view the Goliath only has 2 Heat shots at 67 Aim(or whatever), while the Jaeger has potentially 5 shots with 103 aim AND One for All."
Xcom,3dyknm,avenger2142,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:41 2015 UTC,Goliath still has much better HP progression.
Xcom,3dyknm,medieva1man,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"Well, if you go full tank on Goliath, you don't have anything but a single, low-hit shot, but that kinda proves my point. Every tank perk has the trade off of an offensive/utility perk. The thing, though, is that the drop off in effectiveness is much sharper for classes other than the Goliath.   You could get off more kills (at higher health) with the Jaeger by focusing on crit along with LnL. Or a safer but still effective Squadsight build with +aim and +DMG for those hard to kill aliens.   This isn't to say that a tanky Jaeger can't work. I wouldn't be surprised if it does well in the field with practical application. There are just better options in my opinion, especially when you consider the overall cost of fielding this unit. I would hardly call it OP. There is a lot that could go wrong with this situation (Psi Lance anyone?)."
Xcom,3dyknm,medieva1man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"So, what are the better options?"
Xcom,3dyknm,medieva1man,3,Mon Jul 20 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"Well, just my opinion, but in regards to tanking, I would much rather have a Psi Tank Assault, especially for the late game. They are so much easier to field and can share their equipment with other soldiers. While they lose a lot of DMG and crit potential, they don't lose any utility once they get psi powers/gene mods. Can't take as many hits as a Goliath for instance, but can easily hold a candle to other tanky MECs. Plus, that high will will keep him alive once Ethereals show up.  I also really like Guardians as a front-line tanker, too. Not so much because they take all the tanky perks, but because they can pack so much self sustaining healing mist while still being overwatch masters. Not only that, but when an alien decides to hit someone else for a change, the Guardian can park itself next to them and have the healing be doubled.  But my play-style may be vastly different to yours, so take everything with a grain of salt. There are a lot of viable builds for different strategies. Each class has things only they can do in a certain way no one else can replicate exactly. Even so, there is no real wrong answer or best/worst build. You just need to be prepared to deal with the weaknesses that each build will inevitably have. I personally like to push strengths to their limit and shore up weaknesses with other members of the squad."
Xcom,3dyknm,lugalzagezi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:05 2015 UTC,I could not agree more. I also use the Bio-tank/Guardian approach.  ITZ/tank build seems about right. I think there could be some room to use it between the highly specialized classes.  I would like to respecc my whole rooster right now!
Xcom,3dyknm,medieva1man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:44 2015 UTC,Here's a crazy idea:  Why not give him a MEC fist too and use that to get an ITZ proc when your DMG starts to get low? Something like: Run up to an alien flanking a bunch of aliens->shoot till run out of ammo->MEC fist closest alien to death->One-for-All->Reload.   That's maybe a best case scenario but would be even better if something like a lid starts the turn right next to you.
Xcom,3dyknm,Aedn,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:29 2015 UTC,ITZ only works with primary weapon.
Xcom,3dyknm,UristImiknorris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"Shit...  Oh well, would have been cool."
Xcom,3dyknm,exodusinfinite,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"its an interesting built, my main concern would be the reliance on ITZ to really succeed with it, and the lack of perks to compliment ITZ. While the damage is higher, its really not going to outperform a ITZ sniper due to lack of perks to boost crit & damage.   Other mec's like the valkyrie and Marauder are as good or better, with 2 attacks per round, while providing heat & shredder in case of the valkyrie, and higher damage output in the case of the marauder.  It really comes down to if how you feel about the potential ITZ bonus as a first strike capability. Over 2 rounds of combat, the jager really does not gain any extra attacks, as it lacks LnL to maximize on ITZ."
Xcom,3dyknm,psyschism,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree at least on the reload part. If ITZ doesn´t fail the turn is supposed to end with ""One for All"" and reload.  The Valkyre is a good argument, but it can only use one of the two attacks and still use One for All. For me it is pretty clearly weaker than the Archer which also has +7 Aim if I am not mistaken."
Xcom,3dyknm,exodusinfinite,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:26 2015 UTC,"Wait, wouldn't its turn end if ITZ misses?"

Xcom,3dyknm,lugalzagezi,2,Tue Jul 21 00:34:22 2015 UTC,"Missing ITZ should instantly end your turn, because it counts as if you have taken a standard shot. (Unless you have Light-Em-Up or Double Tap)"

Xcom,3dyknm,DDADDA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:02:48 2015 UTC,"what your discussing has 2 major requirements. never failing an itz chain is not really going to happen. the other issue is that your going to have to be setup for every encounter in order to really make it work as you describe.   it really comes down to play style, i prefer to run mecs as fire support units, and rarely invest to heavy into the defensive perks in B15 and as such prefer to maximize consistent damage output since my tactical game relies on flanking, suppression and movement rather then explosives/itz."
Xcom,3dyknm,Phearlock,2,Tue Jul 21 08:25:04 2015 UTC,"It is viable build, but comes at a cost.   Any tanking mec needs tanky suit and that means less mobility to get into flanking positions and higher chance to be actually shot. Not to mention that by taking tanky perks you are lowering your damage output and increasing the chance itz chain will end sooner."
Xcom,3dw5ht,guto8797,25,Mon Jul 20 01:02:30 2015 UTC,"From my experiences playing Xcom if the game decides to start getting weird and bugging out, 9/10 times the bugs will fuck you over in some way.
