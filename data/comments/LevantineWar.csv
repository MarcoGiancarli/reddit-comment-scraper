LevantineWar,3c6s2e,gonzolegend,21,Sun Jul 5 11:20:35 2015 UTC,"If behind paywall for anyone I'll cut/paste below:  I was researching the fight between Hezbollah and Islamic State (IS) in northeastern Lebanon when I noticed something very odd in the stories about Hezbollah.  In the first place, there aren’t nearly as many as there are about IS. The reason that’s odd is that Hezbollah is a much stronger military force than Islamic State. In fact, the reason I decided not to do a whole article on the Qalamoun Campaign is that it was too simple a story: Hezbollah kicked IS’s ass, period.  But it’s surprisingly hard to get a sane estimate of Hezbollah manpower. Some of the published estimates are just laughable. There are stories out there that Hezbollah is getting by with only “1000 full-time fighters,” backed up by “6000-7000” reserves.  The Israeli Defense Force’s (IDF’s) total strength is roughly 700,000 including reserves.  Hezbollah fought the IDF to a draw, at the very least, in 2006. So if Hezbollah’s strength, including reserves, was something like 7- or 8000 – well, I’m no mathematician, but I think that would mean they beat a force that was a nice, tidy 100 times bigger than their own, which would mean that either Hezbollah is fielding supermen, or the IDF is even worse than the Iraqi Army.  Most stories about Hezbollah’s power ignore its soldiers and jump directly to its “rocket arsenal.” For example the Wikipedia entry “Hezbollah Military Strength” starts out:   “In October 2006, Hezbollah claimed to have an arsenal of at least 33,000 rockets.[1] The Pentagon believes that Hezbollah has a rocket arsenal of around 30,000.[citation needed] According to IranTracker, estimates of Hezbollah's overall missile arsenal range from 40,000 to 50,000 large-caliber munitions of all kinds. Israel estimates that Hezbollah has about 40,000, most of them shorter-range rockets and mortar shells.”   Reading this, you’d think Hezbollah was some kind of fully automated missile warehouse, only capable of attacking Israel by launching sneaky rockets, like science dweebs in a park firing off their latest Estes Corp. products.  Truth is, these unguided surface-to-surface missiles are noisy distractions, no more. If they were anything more, we’d have to take Hamas seriously as a military force, and nobody pretends to do that—except the Israelis, when they’re looking for an excuse to bomb Gaza again.  What’s going on here is that the US and Israel want to exaggerate the power of Hezbollah’s rockets, while completely blacking out what really scares them: the fact that man for man, squad for squad, Hezbollah’s infantry is better than Israel’s."
LevantineWar,3c6s2e,confluencer,17,Sun Jul 5 11:22:41 2015 UTC,"The US and Israeli apparatchiks agree on understating Hezbollah’s strength, but for different reasons. The Americans are just stubborn, sore losers. Yeah, Hezbollah killed 241 Marines in Beirut in 1983 (in fact I have a friend who helped clear away the bodies and insists that there were a lot more than 241) -- but that was an act of war, and if anyone bears moral responsibility for it, it’s Reagan.  He sent those marines to prop up Israeli/US proxies without bothering to find out anything about Lebanon. Reagan, that grinning conscience-free house-cat of a president, went through the motions after the bombing; croaked a few platitudes about revenge, pretended to squirt a few for the Marines’ families…and then, very quietly, ordered surviving American troops out of Lebanon three months after the attack. That was Reagan’s world: a crust of lies on a lake of sleaze.  Hezbollah came of age in that rotten world, and offended the Americans and Israelis simply by doing the same grim stuff, only better. A lot better. Of course it wasn’t that hard to be better than US intelligence in Beirut, as shown by one of Hezbollah’s best operations, the kidnapping of William F. Buckley, a CIA official.  They grabbed him, tortured all the info he had out of him, and dumped the body. Rough stuff, but it’s hard to weep for a smug idiot who actually refused to alter his route to and from work—in Beirut! In 1983!   “Army Major General Carl Stiner had warned Buckley that he was in danger, but Buckley told him that ‘I have a pretty good intelligence network. I think I'm secure.’ However, according to Stiner, Buckley continued to live in his apartment and travel the same route to and from work every day.”   I’ll refrain from making any jokes about William F. Buckley’s vocabulary under torture (e.g. “a veritable thesaurus of pain”, etc.). As far as I can tell, the Beirut Buckley was a normal inarticulate army retread, no relation to the National Review Yalie with the Mister Howell voice (though, in an interesting side note, that William F. Buckley also served in the CIA, as he admitted himself.)  But the famous Buckley—the Big Buckley, if you will—did his spying and assassinating in Latin America, where US agents get to do all the killing without any risk of getting killed themselves. Nice work if you can get it through your oil-man dad.  At any rate, if you meet anyone named Buckley, and he introduces himself as “Bill,” you can just assume he commutes to Langley, can’t speak a single foreign language decently, and makes way more money than he reports to the IRS.  Hezbollah managed another impressive operation in Beirut that helped to put the Langley crowd in a permanent sulk. These crazy-brilliant Shi’ites set off a huge bomb that pretty much wiped out the Beirut franchise of the CIA, right when the spooks were having their big top-secret meeting.  Again, a brilliant wartime operation, nothing to get huffy about. Beirut was a free-fire zone for every faction, and the US certainly killed more than enough Shia to avenge the dead. And contrary to popular belief, Hezbollah is not the moral equivalent of Islamic State. Hezbollah does not commit sectarian massacres, and has been all too willing to make typically Lebanese alliances with sleazy politicians from all the local sects.  Yet Israel still treats Hezbollah as if it were worse than the IS creeps tearing Syria apart. In fact Israel has made it very clear that it prefers groups like Islamic State and Jabhad al Nusra to Hezbollah."
LevantineWar,3c6s2e,kafta,16,Sun Jul 5 11:24:32 2015 UTC,"The reason for this hatred is simple fear. Israel fears Hezbollah, but has contempt for Sunni militias. The fear is well grounded, too. It goes back to 1982, when the Begin government idiotically invaded Southern Lebanon, infuriating the Lebanese Shia who’d ignored the Israel/Palestine war until then.  Within a few months, the invasion turned the Shia from docile peasants, the poorest of Lebanon’s poor, to fighters way tougher than any Palestinian. From 1982 on, Israel faced constant harassment from the Shi’ite peasantry of South Lebanon. The IDF was finally driven out in May 2000. The next encounter between Hezbollah and Israel started with a Hezbollah kidnapping along the border, in 2006. When the IDF tried to go into Hezbollah territory to get its soldiers back, they were defeated outright.  Mark Perry and Alistair Crooke described how Hezbollah faced down the IDF:   Hezbollah’s fighters proved to be dedicated and disciplined. Using intelligence assets to pinpoint Israeli infantry penetrations, they proved the equal of Israel’s best fighting units. In some cases, Israeli units were defeated on the field of battle, forced into sudden retreats or forced to rely on air cover to save elements from being overrun. Even toward the end of the war, on August 9, the IDF announced that 15 of its reserve soldiers were killed and 40 wounded in fighting in the villages of Marjayoun, Khiam and Kila–a stunning casualty rate for a marginal piece of real estate.   The IDF resorted to bombing civilian infrastructure all over Lebanon rather than confronting Hezbollah on the ground. It was an ugly way to make a lost war look like victory.  Since the 2006 debacle, Israel has been avoiding combat with Hezbollah, focusing on feeding absurd stories to the Western press about how Hezbollah is on the ropes, at death’s door, and bleeding out in its efforts to prop up Assad’s regime in Syria.  You can see for yourself how common these stories about poor, doomed Hezbollah are. Google “Hezbollah in trouble” and you’ll get 424,000 responses, going all the way back to the beginning of the group in the 1980s. Hezbollah, the miraculous corpse that never dies. There are opera deaths that are more plausible. Here are the first three entries for “Hezbollah in trouble”:  It’s fun, in a cruel way, to read old stories like #1 and #2, which date from 2012. Hezbollah was on its last legs back then, according to Michael Totten, who wrote this gem: “…If the Assad regime is pulled down in Damascus, expect a great deal of Hezbollah’s local support to simply evaporate.”  It’s not easy to get two big predictions wrong in one sentence, but by connecting Hezbollah’s fall to the any-minute-now fall of Assad, Totten nailed it. It’s 2015; Assad hasn’t fallen, and Hezbollah’s support has grown.  But we’re dealing with fever dreams here, not realistic predictions. The hate these guys feel for Hezbollah blinds them. And of course there’s no penalty for being wrong, not even this wildly.  The first entry, “Hezbollah is in Trouble,” comes from a right-wing Israeli site, YNet. They had Iran and Hezbollah all measured for a double coffin:   “With Iran plummeting and Assad sinking, Hezbollah is also going down. The days of its intoxication with power are gone. The Shiite axis is fighting for its life and Hezbollah has become the most hated organization in the Arab world. Those betting on the Syrian president, who butchers with no mercy, are crushing along with him.”   Iran was “plummeting”? How did Iran “plummet” in 2012? Arguing that Assad is “sinking” is a little more reasonable, but again, it’s 2015 and the Alawites are still afloat.  Because they’re a tribe. Tribes don’t die. The Alawites of Syria and the Shia of South Lebanon and the Bekaa valley are typical Levantine tribes: paranoid, cohesive, virtually impossible to eradicate. You’d think the Israelis, a classic Levantine enclave themselves, would understand that."
LevantineWar,3c6s2e,Fort_When_Tea,14,Sun Jul 5 11:27:17 2015 UTC,"Absurd as these doom-y predictions are, they won’t stop coming. Like porn, they, ah, “satisfy a need.”  And they show up in some sites that should know better, like The Atlantic, which published #3 back in 2011. Yes, Hezbollah was on its last legs in 2011, just as it was in 2012, and 2013, and ’14, and ’15. So confident am I of the eventual triumph of good over evil that I will go out on a limb here and predict that Hezbollah will be on its very last legs fifty years from now, as well.  In fact, Hezbollah is stronger than ever. It’s not just the strongest armed force in Lebanon—much stronger than the official Lebanese Army; it’s also the strongest Arab armed force, period.  In 2014, Benny Gantz, a top IDF general, admitted as much, trashing all the “doomed Hezbollah” stories by saying that Hezbollah had more combat power than all but the five top nation-state armies in the world. And Gantz turned the dumb-ass meme about Syria on its head, arguing that what makes Hezbollah more dangerous than ever is its combat experience in Syria.  Gantz was brutally honest about the situation, admitting that the only thing deterring Hezbollah from attacking Israel is the prospect that the IAF would retaliate by flattening every civilian building in Lebanon, which would interfere with Hezbollah’s political ambitions within the country:  “‘Hezbollah is like a state and they know exactly what is going to happen in Lebanon if they start a war with us, and that this would set Lebanon back decades,’ [Gantz] said.”  So why isn’t there any Hezbollah push-back against these silly lies? It’s precisely because Hezbollah is dead serious about the ballot box, as well as the bullet. And in order for the party to make it in Lebanese politics, Hezbollah prefers not to look as powerful as it really is. It is committed to playing to Lebanese politics as intensely as it makes war – the old “AK in one hand, ballad in the other” approach. The last thing Nasrallah needs is to start screaming “I could crush your puny militias!” to the other armed and paranoid sects of Lebanon.  Interestingly, then, Hezbollah may be the only armed force in the whole Middle East that makes a policy of understating its own strength. And that’s one of the most impressive signs of strength, when your party has the discipline to refrain from the boasting and hyperbole that makes most Middle Eastern militaries sound like playground jerks."

LevantineWar,3c6vi9,kafta,2,Sun Jul 5 12:18:36 2015 UTC,"The gruesome images coming out of Syria make it hard to imagine it in such terms, but Tehran sees Damascus as an investment.  While many in the United States discussed the ramifications of Iran losing Syria, Tehran was busy taking it. The Islamic Republic’s aid to the Syrian regime is not about cutting its losses, but about achieving economic, political and strategic goals that had previously been out of reach. There is nothing ideological about this alliance — it is and always has been pure and unabashed self-interest. The gruesome images coming out of Syria make it hard to imagine it in such terms, but Iran sees Damascus as an investment.  The Iranians have capitalized on the Syrian civil war to solidify their political control over the Syrian regime, changing a shaky ally into a dependable proxy. The origin of the Syrian-Iranian alliance is the Iran-Iraq war, as Syria was one of just two Arab countries to support the Iranians in their fight against Saddam Hussein. Syria’s support for Iran throughout this conflict was not about the ideological affinity of the two regimes but rather a shared interest in weakening Iraq. In fact, Syria and Iraq were much more culturally and ideologically aligned than Syria and Iran; Syria and Iraq were controlled by secular Arab Ba'athist regimes, while the government of Iran was a theocracy.  In the wake of the collapse of its longtime Soviet patron, there were several indications that Syria would try to follow in the footsteps of Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat by making peace with Israel and reorienting itself towards the U.S. and away from Iran. Serious peace talks were held between Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and the Israeli leadership in 1993 under Yitzhak Rabin, in 1995 under Shimon Peres, and in 2000 under Ehud Barak. The negotiations were unsuccessful largely due to the inflexibility of both countries regarding Syria's demand that Israel fully withdraw to the pre-1967 boundaries, based on the precedent set by the Israeli peace accords with Egypt.  Though U.S.-Syrian relations did improve in the 1990s and later included some cooperation against al-Qaeda after 9/11, the 2003 Iraq war and Syrian assistance to those resisting the U.S. occupation of Iraq caused the thawing relations to freeze over. Hopes for an Israeli-Syrian peace were revived one last time when negotiations resumed in 2007 with the help of Turkey. The following year, the U.S. State Department reviewed its Syria policy, “leading to an effort to engage with Syria to find areas of mutual interest, reduce regional tensions, and promote Middle East peace.” Tehran was obviously concerned enough about the prospect of Syria “flipping” that Hussein Shariatmadari, an advisor to Iran's supreme leader, publicly warned against it.  However, U.S.-Syrian relations would soon sour as a result of Assad’s crackdown on Arab Spring protests, and since then the U.S. has withheld diplomatic efforts to put a crack in the “axis of resistance.”  By 2012, Iranian concerns regarding the blossoming of U.S.-Syrian relations or the signing of Israeli-Syrian peace accords were little more than a memory. As the conflict in Syria took on more sectarian and violent dimensions, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) supported an increasingly dependent and brutal Assad in his suppression of dissent. By January 2013, the Iranians had so much influence over the Syrian agenda that in a prisoner swap between the regime and the rebels, Assad did not demand the release of local loyalists but of 48 IRGC commanders in exchange for more than 2,000 rebels and anti-regime activists.  Also, the economic gains that Iran stands to make from this conflict have often been overlooked, as most assume that Tehran is just willing to stomach billions of dollars in financial losses in exchange for strategic benefit. Though Iran was often pushing to exert greater influence over Syria in their marriage of convenience, the Assads made sure to minimize their economic dependence on Iran, a fact evident in the extremely small volume of trade between the two countries in the years leading up to the Arab Spring.  While trade between the U.S. and Syria reached $940 million in 2010, the volume of trade between the supposed “Tehran-Damascus axis” was less than one-half that. One could argue that this was merely incidental or that economic cooperation between the countries simply wasn’t necessary, but counterbalancing Iranian influence by strengthening economic ties to other countries was Damascus' unofficial state policy rather than coincidence. For example, out of six cellular companies vying for the rights to operate a third mobile network in Syria in 2010 (including companies from Qatar, the UAE, Turkey and Saudi Arabia — ostensibly more hostile to the “axis of resistance”), the only bid rejected was from an Iranian company rumored to be connected to the IRGC.  However, after the uprising against Assad began and Syria’s trading partners abided by the sanctions against it, Iran was not placed “in a foreign-policy predicament” but rather was positioned to exploit the fact that Assad no longer had the luxury to keep it at arm’s length. Despite Syria’s declining economic state, Syrian-Iranian trade has tripled since 2010, reaching $1 billion in 2014, and is expected to continue growing. Also, Iran’s close ties to the regime and its status as the Middle East’s largest producer of cement and iron mean that it is well-positioned to benefit from Syria’s ongoing destruction and reconstruction.  Though Iran has largely planned its strategy under the assumption that the Assad regime would survive, it has also trained and armed Syrian militias to serve Iranian interests long after state institutions have collapsed. Iran has invested a great deal in keeping Assad afloat while preparing for his fall, and as part of a “plan B” to maintain influence in case the Assad regime collapses, Iran and Hezbollah are cultivating relationships with minority-based militias fighting on Assad’s side. These militias include the shadowy criminal network with close ties to the Assad family known as the shabiha as well as the jaysh al-sha’bi which have been trained, and supplied by Iran and Hezbollah based on the model of the Iranian Basij militia. The more loosely affiliated militias will likely prove durable allies should Iran decide to cut costs by supporting a Shi'ite insurgency in a post-Assad Sunni-controlled Syria, rather than continuing to prop up the Syrian government. In essence, Iran has used the Syrian civil war as an opportunity to both nurture Assad’s political, economic, and military dependence and simultaneously support and train militias that can serve the interests of the Islamic Republic should Assad’s government prove unsustainable.  Granted, the fragmentation of Syria translates into only partial Iranian control of the country. Yet, in spite of the fact that it holds only about 50 percent of the territory, the Assad regime controls between 55 and 72 percent of the remaining population.  ISIS may hold a great deal of territory in Syria, but it is clear from the sparsely dotted cities in the maps of its territory that it controls mostly Syrian desert and rural areas rather than urban centers. Provided the joint Syria-Iran-Hezbollah efforts can hold a few key areas like the road between Damascus and Beirut, the Assad regime’s ability to serve as a conduit for weapons flowing from Iran to Hezbollah will remain intact.  The Syrian civil war is approaching its fifth year and the P5+1 is hammering out a nuclear deal with Iran that could potentially unfreeze hundreds of billions of dollars in assets. Due to Tehran’s backing thus far, the numerous predictions that Assad could fall any minute remain unfulfilled.  Though there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the Syrian civil war, one thing is clear: Iran will be ready."

The first is along the lines of their theology which references a final battle between good and evil, between ""Rome"" (the West) and Islam, which they believe will take place at Dabiq in Libya. The second is that it continues the quite successful tactic employed by Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and other terrorist leaders by forcing the United States to spend vast amounts of money on combating them.

LevantineWar,39prbr,DrogoDeserto,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:32:56 2015 UTC,"Taarof:       T'aarof, Ta'arof, or Tarof (Persian: تعارف‎) is a Persian form of civility emphasizing both deference and social rank, similar to the Chinese art of etiquette, limao.  The term encompasses a range of social behaviours, from a man displaying etiquette by opening the door for a woman, to a group of colleagues standing on ceremony in front of a door that can permit the entry of only one at time, earnestly imploring the most senior to break the deadlock.  The prevalence of t'aarof often gives rise to different styles of negotiation than one would see in a non-Iranian culture. For example, a worker negotiating a salary might begin with a eulogy of the employer, followed by a lengthy bargaining session consisting entirely of indirect, polite language – both parties are expected to understand the implied topic of discussion. It is quite common for an Iranian worker (even one employed in an Iranian neighborhood within Europe) to work unpaid for a week or two before the issue of wages is finally broached. [citation needed] Likewise, a shopkeeper may initially refuse to quote a price for an item, suggesting that it is worthless (""ghaabel nadaareh""). T'aarof obliges the customer to insist on paying, possibly several times (3 times), before a shopkeeper finally quotes a price and real negotiation can begin.  T'aarof also governs the rules of hospitality: a host is obliged to offer anything a guest might want, and a guest is equally obliged to refuse it. This ritual may repeat itself several times (3 times) before the host and guest finally determine whether the host's offer and the guest's refusal are real or simply polite. It is possible to ask someone not to t'aarof (""t'aarof nakonid""), but that raises new difficulties, since the request itself might be a devious type of t'aarof.

Turkey basically has no other way to see these enemies fall without upsetting the international community."

I'd like to hope the reports are fake, but there have been too many now and, knowing their President, he's probably pig headed enough to take such a route."

LevantineWar,37kvwu,kafta,2,Thu May 28 11:10:26 2015 UTC,This article makes no sense. Hezbollah is currently burning though its manpower and equipment supporting Assad. The longer it remains part of that conflict the weaker it becomes. Starting war in Lebanon would only bring Hezbollah more recruits.   It certainly would not change the outcome of the Iran nuclear talks.

LevantineWar,37h7qi,gonzolegend,2,Wed May 27 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"Blair can actually be quite good as a politician on the international stage as he knows how to network and ""press the flesh"". In this matter he was hopelessly compromised from the start. He has a ""certain"" pro-Israeli bias and his role in the Iraq war, is well known. I'm surprised that many Middle East politicians even let him into their countries."
