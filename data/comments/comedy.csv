My issue with Oliver is his grand simplification of a difficult issue and his breathless outrage, per usual.  The logistics of getting surplus food to the right people in-time are non-trivial and in many cases it may make sense to provide non-surplus food in order to ensure continuity of supply and an appropriate diet. I.e., just because there's a local over supply of radishes within metro area it may not be what food insecure people need.   At the least I would have liked to see interviews with people working on the problem."

The audience's expectation has changed so much that, no, no one can compare to that kind of act today.  Someone doing that kind of an act on Fallon would just be... weird.  It's not funny enough.  It's somehow simultaneously too formal in style and too informal in content.  I don't know how to put it.  I really like watching some old live audience TV like this on youtube.  I try not to be one of those people who talks about the decline of modern culture.  I think that's usually a lazy, inaccurate idea.

comedy,3dktte,planx_constant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Well, Lenny Bruce is the precursor to the stand-up we have today; to find someone like this, just look ahead at the people who followed him.  George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Louis CK (examples)  i'm just naming the ones who I know were DIRECTLY influenced by Lenny Bruce, I'm sure there are others (Pryor, I'm sure, was influenced)  Essentially, any comedian like Carlin and CK is like Lenny Bruce, because Bruce used comedy as a vehicle for social commentary (CK doesn't do this that much, but Carlin does it in his later, angrier comedy specials).  I hope this helps. I wonder if Anthony Jeselnik counts, because he's really dark. For the time, Lenny Bruce was also quite dark (using language, talking about sex, etc... this was unheard of back in the Sixties, and it's partially the reason why Bruce was blacklisted from a lot of clubs which led to his downfall).  TL;DR: Carlin, CK, and people who are in the same boat as those two. Hope this helps.  EDIT: A comma and ""DIRECTLY"""
comedy,3dktte,acquabob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:14 2015 UTC,It's pretty old school to combine the serious and comedic tones in the way Lenny does here. I've seen people like Martin Short or Billy Crystal do it at awards shows etc. but it's relatively rare nowadays.   Obviously Carlin or CK are the comparisons to make in terms of subject matter and willingness to stretch taboos.  Is there any exact modern match in terms of performative-ness (going into character and so on) combined with willingness to be risque? Not that I can think of.
