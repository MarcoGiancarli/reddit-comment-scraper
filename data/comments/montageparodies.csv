montageparodies,3dlqk4,Tamim-N,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:49:46 2015 UTC,wowee why havent i changed my outlook sooner that is the answer oh boy  the way soundcloud works is that the author enables it if they wish and if they're on a free account (which 99% of soundcloud content creators are on) then it disappears after 100 downloads  this as well as the fact that the download button rarely functions at all has led to accessible alternatives that are easily found on the intern net dot com websight
montageparodies,3dlqk4,r0b3r71,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"I know there are 3rd party websites for soundcloud downloads but do know that there are new people everyday learning new stuff. Some people also post their downloadlinks in the description or you can download via the button as you mentioned. However I thought why not ask others since asking is not a problem. You can learn something from asking.  No one thinks exactly the same like you  And seeing that you're a mod, you should atleast try to act like one and help others when they're in need of help or let them be. But leaving a childish comment is never the answer."

montageparodies,3coc6v,MDoubleT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"I will try my best to explain why this video sucks and does not make any sense. So there are people who call themselves ""Elevator photographers"". They record elevators and when they finish recording they upload those videos on youtube. The guy who said he always loved memes is the guy who started elevator photography. There are shit tons of youtube accounts who upload mostly elevator videos. The reason why this video sucks snipars dick is mostly because of my editing skills and the other reason is: It is pretty hard to make a montage parody out of people who record elevators. This video was more messing in vegas than making a good montage parody. BTW danks for watching m89. Sorry for my bad english."
