pkmntcgcollections,3dtp1e,ortizr93,2,Sun Jul 19 10:47:10 2015 UTC,And in the case of older sets its just cheaper to buy repacks and singles instead of sealed as sealed product tends to retain a higher value then the cards themselves

pkmntcgcollections,3dtp1e,KelsoRules,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't buy single boosters, as those are likely to get weighed. What I do is buy boxes, tins, and blister packs, as they are harder to weigh. Even single pack blisters are fine, as the promo card and coin foul any attempts to weigh the packs inside. Once I have about 75% of the set, I'd start buying singles, because at that point, you're likely to have almost all the commons, so half the pack is going to be doubles."

Google for images.  Some american (snob) collectors find foriegn language cards less desirable simply because these people can't read them. other collectors find them a complete record of every way a card was made (see Wheatizard's 'Zard collection in all languages printed)  Graded means sending your card to a grading company that rates how new and mint and fresh and undamaged your card is. u/patriotsfan is a big help on these boards.
pkmntcgcollections,3dr6gw,ChicaSkas,4,Sat Jul 18 17:52:55 2015 UTC,"Not just Americans, and it's not snobbery, it's purely supply and demand. Ample supply of foreign cards with nowhere near as much demand for them.  It's not unreasonable to want to be able to actually read what your cards say.

They also did something kind of funky with the rare/holo slot and RH slot, and it was possible to pull a Pokemon-EX (non-RC) and a holo rare in the same pack, I believe.

pkmntcgcollections,3dovca,FeatheredSoap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:15:18 2015 UTC,Tcgplayer.com is another good resource for real world prices.  Are you planning on purchasing insurance to have their value replaced?
pkmntcgcollections,3dovca,Credits_PTCGO,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:03:27 2015 UTC,"I'll look into that.  Yeah, that's the plan. I want a clear inventory of my collection in case anything ever happens. If something does happen, I don't want them to be considered .40 a piece. (10 cards in a booster pack.) I'm still doing research on all of this, and will be my first time dealing with insurance!"
pkmntcgcollections,3dovca,Credits_PTCGO,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"Reason i ask is in my experience all you would need ti do is declare the collection, take photos and have a price list to reference. Its no different to coins or fancy dinner plates. The concern would be trading and the fluctuation caused from trading. Maybe you just dont say anything about that, have the things mentioned and if it ever increases in price, ammend your documentation accordingly. GL"
pkmntcgcollections,3dovca,ChicaSkas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:06:00 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say for sure because some cards gain and lose value. I think you are safe to say that 1st editions and extremely rare prints like your Espeon (English or Japanese?) are going to retain value and go nothing but up in value. But pokemon fluctuates. I've only been back into pokemon collecting since March, and in those 4 short months I've seen prices on cards all over the map, from here to Ebay to T and T. Good luck!"
pkmntcgcollections,3dovca,ortizr93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:04:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! Hopefully I can find a good website/guide to keep all my prices up to date! I've seen that happen with Garchomp C in the past! It was worth $30-$40 when I was still playing the TCG, and now I've seen it as low as $2 because everyone has so many!  My Espeon Star is English!"
pkmntcgcollections,3dovca,ortizr93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:36:41 2015 UTC,"As for the insurance, you'd have to check the details of what they'll insure - when I was at uni, I was insured up to £2500 for loss, theft or accidental damage to all my electrical goods, books, clothes and jewellery. Iirc, things like trading cards wouldn't be covered, so you'd have to find a special insurer"
pkmntcgcollections,3dovca,buckanater160,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:20:41 2015 UTC,I'm planning on buying insurance specially for my cards. I believe my college covers computer damage and such.

pkmntcgcollections,3dmjxa,Xuzu,3,Fri Jul 17 15:58:18 2015 UTC,Are you interested in selling or trading any of them?
pkmntcgcollections,3dmjxa,ChicaSkas,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"Cool collection!   There's not too much here that's wildly valuable. The only cards worth anything are your holos, and most of them are only worth a few dollars each.   The Blaine's Charizard is selling for $20 on Troll and Toad, but that's not accurate to its true market worth.   The Ho-oh holo that you have is going for $15 on TnT, but once again TnT marks up prices pretty drastically on old stuff like this.   Those are the only cards that I saw that are worth more than a few dollars, but monetary value notwithstanding you have some real beauties in that collection!"
pkmntcgcollections,3dmjxa,aqlno,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yeah wasn't expecting much since everyone and their grandma had a full collection back when I was in middle school but I still love them. Thinking about buying more and doing opening videos on YouTube, honestly that was always the most fun for me - opening a brand new booster and feeling the excitement. It's like gambling for kids haha."
pkmntcgcollections,3dmjxa,xRacoon,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:47 2015 UTC,"Lucky you, it seems you got a fist error Diglett. Take a look at the Diglett (with 47/102 on the bottom right), look at the lone fist on it and then the 2 fists under it, you'll see that the lone fist is sideways. Doesn't really sell for much on ebay, at least that's what sold listings tell me, but it's still a cool card to have."
pkmntcgcollections,3dmjxa,Jsmurff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:41:59 2015 UTC,Very much appreciated for any advice or information. I just started playing Pokemon tcg online and it reminded me I had these. Would love to know which cards are awesome. By the way there's more cards hidden behind the ones I. The sleeves but I didn't want to handle them too much. I'll take them out carefully and photograph them all if you guys are interested. I know there's at least a couple holos hiding.
pkmntcgcollections,3dmjxa,DictatorMad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:24 2015 UTC,It's a very nice collection with some pretty cool old school holo's :) also personally I wouldn't double stack cards in binders as I feel they have the tendency to warp in that situation but opinions on this are pretty 50/50 and there isn't really a right or wrong way to store and collect cards if cost is a factor the one card per pocket is going to require allot of binders and pages. The more openings on YT the better just don't take comment section too serious there will always be assholes and trolls who have nothing better to do then cut people down
pkmntcgcollections,3dmjxa,DeadDrifter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"it's more then what I had as a kid in the 90's. Some of the older card's art work are awesome, to bad most old cards aren't worth more then a few dollars. Today cards have little more worth to them, and it's always fun to collect more pokemon cards."

This has taken lots of patience and spending.   I'll eventually get it completed!   I am in no rush.   Fortunatly after the release of flashfire, it has given me time to catch up a bit cus I know they won't be printing Zards for awhile.  LOL"

It does look bad ass though,  but I would not buy that.   I got suckered into buying something similar for 40 bucks once,  and it turned out to be a fake.   It looked real with they way they posted it,  but that spiderwebs one just is not convincing me at all.     If I remember correctly, the auction was written carefully well."

For this reason I store my cards in a Pelican case with the moisture absorbing packets inside. You can buy ones that you put in the oven so they can be reused.  The Pelican case is expensive, but so would be the chore of replacing my cards."
pkmntcgcollections,3dmfvt,OzEnigma2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:57:35 2015 UTC,An oven? Really? Seen a few in my Airsoft days and thought they had pressurisation valves that purge the case of unwanted moister and other airborne contaminants   I personally use toploaders and team bags i put the cards into a sleeve in the same manor as op and put the opening facing down in to the toploader  Here in Ireland we have an average of 155 day a year of absolute downpour so dampness and mould are a big fear and a huge possibility but so far my cards are as dry as the Sahara and aren't exposed to any climate conditions that would ruin them so far I am happy and it's not too expencive if you get the supplies in bulk lots   However if you've got some mint 1st ed charizards or anything of that scale or higher then you can't go wrong with pelican

pkmntcgcollections,3dmfvt,JDismyfriend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:32:36 2015 UTC,"You can just put the cards in a box/blinder and put that box into one of the airtight bag and vacuum out the air. It's like storing food but with cards. The only thing is make sure you secure the cards well otherwise they might come loose during the vacuum process. Down side of this method is that you can't just take the cards out easily to look at it.  Also store it places that doesn't have an extreme change of temperature and sunlight.  2nd method is the costly one, you could just send the most valuable ones into psa and have them grade the cards and sealed it for you."
pkmntcgcollections,3dj37c,primase,9,Thu Jul 16 17:59:43 2015 UTC,"That distinction probably goes to these two for me.  I remember being in 3rd grade when the 2nd Generation of Pokemon came out. Lugia instantly became my absolute favorite Pokemon and I absolutely wanted to get myself a copy. Unfortunately, my parents back then really did not want to drop anymore money on cards so I was a bit stuck for quite a few years. 14 years and a full time job later, I got on pkmntcgtrades and decided to make my childhood dreams reality. I came across a guy named /u/Patriots_Fan who found me this copy and, since I loved the duality between the two, I acquired this Ho-Oh from a long abandoned pile of rares at my local card shop. Got them both graded at the same time and they both came back Mint. Definitely my two absolute favorite cards in my collection."

I couldn't believe they were including a Charizard in the deck, so I quickly grabbed one and convinced my mom to buy the deck for me.

The other one that comes to mind is my first base set charizard. Back when pokemon was just starting, the most sought after cards were  Zapdos and Charizard as they were the only pokemon to do 100 damage. Grandma gave a pack to me and my brother.

Sentimentally though, it's a bit harder for me to pick. My first EVER card was a shadowless Vulpix that I bought as a single as a little kid. I still have that one. My first holo card was a Japanese Jungle Vileplume, so that's very special to me too. And then there's my non-holo Jungle Scyther. I always wanted Scyther, and when I was little I wasn't sure how booster packs really worked. I asked if I would get a Scyther card if I got a booster pack with him on the cover, the guy said there was no guarantee-- but I got luck and it had one anyway! It has a huge crease in the middle of it now (it's been bent in half), but sentimental value means a lot more to me that actual value. That goes for my entire collection.    I have such great memories getting the cards growing up. They were my first exposure of Pokemon so every time I opened a new pack I would have NO idea what the Pokemon were. It was especially exciting opening the Japanese boosters for that reason."

NW Pikachu is something I've had my eyes on for a while and finally picked up yesterday. Definitely the single most expensive card I own, and the first I would consider grading. I've always loved the artwork, just wish it was cheaper so I could have had it sooner. I always joked about wanting a FA Juniper, and then pulled a severely miscut one from a single loose pack I bought impulsively. I'll post pictures sometime. There's almost no top border to the card at all.  The FA Rayquaza came from my last pack at a pre-release tournament. It even came out of a pack with M-Ray on it. I was super happy when I got it, so it is mine forever now."

I can't tell from the picture, but there are a few ways you can tell if you have a fake: 1. hold the card up to the light and see if any light shines through. If it's see through, it's probably a fake. 2. Compare the font of the card to cards you know are legitimate. If there are noticeable differences in font type, size, or spacing, its probably a fake. 3. Check to see if ""Pokemon"" is trademarked or if the word ""pokemon"" has the accent mark over the ""e"". Many fakers are too lazy to do this. 4. Look at the energy symbols. Fakers seem to have a really hard time making the circles the correct size and properly centering the energy symbols. Good luck.

The rest I would save to create a big lot to sell back or sell immediately. Usually for little profit or come out even. I sometimes take a ""loss"".  But all in all, I've spent about $500 in the last month. I've obtained cards from every set since I've stopped. Many sets are missing quite a few but it's been only a month.

Cause if so I have many of those I  gave to my cousins. As I always thought they were wrong (not the original) as my collection was from when I was a kid I didn't know the differences then. I am only now starting to replace my unlimited with 1st editions.
pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,The_Variable_Phi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Yeah the 4th print is the 99-2000 copyright. I dont have any of those but have started looking into them. It sounds like you completed the unlimited set or maybe have a mix of the shadowless and unlimited print runs. The wizards master sets are generally thought to be the completed first edition and unlimited print runs of the set (some people also include pre-release promos if applicable). For base set, I personally think the master set includes the first edition, shadowless, unlimited, and 4th print run. So you would need to complete each of those for the master."
pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,thecardpletionist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"I guess master set is a new term for me. I should say ""modern"" master set? As with new sets pertains to the complete list of cards + reverse holos.  Thank you again and goodluck!!! It's always bittersweet card hunting"
pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,ChicaSkas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:00:52 2015 UTC,"No worries at all. The term ""master set"" is itself somewhat arbitrary. Do error cards count? What about thin vs thick first edition stamps? Reasonable minds disagree. I think the term generally means having all of the variants of a card set. So you are absolutely correct that in most cases, a master set is the complete set + all reverse holos. For the pre-reverse holo sets, its usually the unlimited and first edition prints with Base and Jungle being the notable exceptions. Best of luck with your continued hunt!"
pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,The_Variable_Phi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"Im a little confused... how are there 4 different Base Set cards, could you explain? sorry just curious"
pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,thecardpletionist,5,Mon Jul 13 19:50:53 2015 UTC,If I am correct these are the prints:   1st Editions Shadowless Unlimited Unlimited (1999-2000 copyright)
pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,Syicko,2,Mon Jul 13 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"@The_Variable_Phi has the correct list below. Each one of the four printings is noticeably different from the others. Check out bulbapedia for a more complete list of the differences, but the short version is as follows: First edition was the initial print and is most easily identified by the first edition stamp on the left corner below the card art. Like Magic's Alpha print, the cards have a prototype feel to them. Shadowless was the next print run. It lacks the first edition stamp but is easily identified because it still looks jarring compared to modern cards. It retained the distinctive color, art, and formatting elements of the first edition print.  It's called the ""shadowless"" print because the picture frame outlining the art does not have the shadow that it has today. Unlimited base set looks, for the most part, like any other unlimited print run during the early wizard days. The familiar shadow has been added to the border, the color and format have been refined from the less sophisticated shadowless print. The fourth print run is nearly identical to the unlimited print but can be distinguished by the inclusion of the  years 1999-2000 in the copyright date on the bottom of the card. The fourth print corrected some of the lingering errors in Unlimited and from my understanding was printed for the UK. I'll post a link with images later tonight to illustrate the differences."

pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,thecardpletionist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:29:02 2015 UTC,I go by newest sets first. Much cheaper to complete. Then I went by first sets to newer.
pkmntcgcollections,3d5ioz,ChicaSkas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"I started collecting when the game came out and have continued ever since. In that time I've completed over 30 sets. I think the main thing is staying organized. It's a good thing that you have an excel spreadsheet. I typically buy a booster box of each new set and use ebay to fill in the missing cards. If you are missing lots of cards from certain sets, try to buy in bulk. Its usually fairly easy to complete the C/U/R parts of a set via eBay. For missing singles, I pretty much exclusively use eBay which can be frustrating. As far as prioritization, I don't really have a strategy. I just kind of work on the sets over time. When you're trying to complete a TCG, the important thing to remember is that its a marathon, not a sprint. It takes a long time to track everything down. Just be patient and collect the sets you like the most first."

pkmntcgcollections,3cyhod,Tambushi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:27:59 2015 UTC,It's one of two Delta Species Mew's. The other is a water type.  This one is a promo card from 2007 that was sold in blister packs in Walmart and Target stores.
pkmntcgcollections,3cyhod,CAT5e_,0,Sat Jul 11 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"The holo version is from the blister packs, but this non-holo version is one pulled from a POP 5 pack. POP 5 packs were two-card packs distributed to players at League back in 2007. As far as I know, this card is just as rare as non-holo Umbreon Star and Espeon Star from POP 5, but this card is unfortunately worth considerably less money."
pkmntcgcollections,3cyhod,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think this is as rare as those, as it's the equivalent of comparing the other Mew * to a random EX Dragon Frontiers holo or rare, not even an ex card."

pkmntcgcollections,3cyhod,Cragscorner,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:11:56 2015 UTC,Its not as rare as the gold stars from POP 5. The packs were designed so that the pull rate for the stars (like the main booster sets) would be exceptionally low. But you are correct that the holo was an alternate foil from the blisters and the non-holo came from POP 5.

pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,ChicaSkas,4,Fri Jul 10 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"Japanese and English cards are far more popular so will be more likely to hold value. Personally, I prefer the looks of Japanese letters/characters to Korean ones too, so I don't buy Korean cards.  Edit: you can get Japanese boxes cheaper than $30 each, places like amiami.com sell them for 2550 jpy (~$20) but they sell out quickly after restocking so you have to check daily to see if they've restocked"
pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,ortizr93,3,Fri Jul 10 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"Even though Korean cards are cheaper, chances are, it wasn't that good of a deal at $20 if you're looking to pull lots of holos/Exs. The pull rates for Korean boxes are generally not that good (about 2 holos per box and 1-3 Exs per box? Can't remember off the top of my head). Like someone else mentioned, Korean card quality is generally lower than English and Japanese, although there aren't many centering/whitening issues for Korean like there is with English cards. I assume that the price is lower due to the lower print quality, and the fact that not many people buy Korean cards. That doesn't mean there aren't any valuable Korean cards though :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,Patriots_Fan,2,Fri Jul 10 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Korean cards aren't made as well as the English or Japanese. In my experience, the Japanese cards are made the best, then English, then Korean. The pull rates typically aren't amazing from the boxes either. Still neat, though."
pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,BiteSizedUmbreon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:39:13 2015 UTC,"I heard that japanese pull rates are sligthly better, but never tried by myself"
pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,ReverESP,7,Fri Jul 10 19:18:53 2015 UTC,The Japanese pull rates are significantly better. 1 box of Korean will only get you 1 EX/FA/UR. 1 box of Japanese will get you 4 EX with one of those possibly being a FA or UR.
pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,OzEnigma2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"normally korean pull-rates are better than japanese - with one box (30x5 cards vs 20x5 cards (jp)) you get 90% of all rare/holo cards per set - chance of a SR is (imho) 1/10.  the cards don't have the standard US/EU/JP quality, but aren't that bad. so if you are a cross-language collector, go for it :-)  /edit: you may check out my former posts, i opened a few .kr boxes - the pictured cards are all holo or FA"
pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,fr3ttchen,4,Sat Jul 11 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"I really don't think you are right here. A Korean box will get you 2 EX if you are lucky. The Japanese boxes will get you 4. The Korean boxes are not half the price of Japanese, making Japanese the far better option."

pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,fr3ttchen,2,Sat Jul 11 01:25:24 2015 UTC,Commons and uncommons are very cheap and should never be a measure of how hard a set is to compete. =)
pkmntcgcollections,3ctdsr,OzEnigma2,3,Sat Jul 11 08:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'm with /u/OzEnigma2 on this one. You definitely won't complete 90% of the Rares/Holos, when Holos are minimal and Rares aren't guaranteed in each pack. SRs are insanely difficult to pull from Korean boxes. I've heard they're about 1 in 100 boxes, and wouldn't be surprised if that's true considering you might only get 1 or 2 Exs consistently out of Korean boxes.   I've been trying to complete my Korean Wild Blaze Charizard set since that set released over a year ago. I've only ever seen the SR M Charizard Y sell publicly once (which I bought), and the SR M Charizard X I've only seen sell 4 times. I've only seen the FA Charizard for sell once, which I lost out on in the final seconds of the auction. If they were easier to pull, there would've been at least a few more for sale (the Charizard Ex and M Charizard Ex from the set are considerably more common) in that span of a year+."

pkmntcgcollections,3cpigh,ortizr93,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they can overprice a bit on cards, though. However, they do know what the hell they're doing when they ship cards, as they're quite padded so they can't be folded nor shifted during shipment."
pkmntcgcollections,3cpigh,YahMoBeThere1,2,Sat Jul 11 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"I was actually a bit disappointed when they shipped my order - although they were in a padded envelope, only one card was in a toploader, the other 8 all just loose, not even in penny sleeves. A couple of them moved around during the travel across the Atlantic but luckily no damage was done"

pkmntcgcollections,3co3ek,OzEnigma2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:55:17 2015 UTC,Bought Cards By Mail. Will probably do a preorder for the late September releases maybe 3 of each not sure yet but I won't be buying anymore bandit ring box's as its just cheaper to get the singles I am using wakeruncollapse 20 box opening as reference I think he only pulled 4 shinnies out of 20 box's
pkmntcgcollections,3co3ek,OzEnigma2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:01:41 2015 UTC,The pull rates have dramatically increased this set to almost 1 SR or Shiny Primal Mega per box. I opened 8 of my 10 boxes and got 4 Shinies and 3 SR.  I think 3 of each box is not a bad decision at all. Really wish it wasn't a split set though =(
pkmntcgcollections,3co3ek,ChicaSkas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:06:34 2015 UTC,If it wasn't a split set I would just get 4 but because it is I expect there to be little in the way of SR's so I've gone for 3 of each in the hope that I get an even spread
pkmntcgcollections,3co3ek,OzEnigma2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:09:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I know.

pkmntcgcollections,3ck4mw,The_Variable_Phi,2,Wed Jul 8 15:16:37 2015 UTC,I once though that Japanese cards were worth less HOWEVER given the fact that English cards are printed rather hap hazardly these days as a collector I see very little value in them and without a massive Unlimited format community to provide a competitive market there is very little resale value in them as they go out of rotation   When it comes to Japanese cards they are of a far better quality. I personally believe that 1st edition is where it's at no use wasting your time/ money on unlimited and with the likes of amiami you can get boxes shipped cheaper then any eBay seller   As for exclusives they are mostly tournament  ones like battle festa and of course there's the vendor series and I do believe there are Pokemon centre exclusives as well like mega Tokyo pikachu's and I believe the full art Steven was one as well   The ultimate aim for my collection isn't the full sets just the UR's an to have them PSA graded.
pkmntcgcollections,3ck4mw,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:20:36 2015 UTC,Man I feel like I've wasted my past 3 months buying English cards. There's less cards in each set in the Japanese counter parts and seeing as they are cheaper too that's just a way to go.
pkmntcgcollections,3ck4mw,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:23:59 2015 UTC,Yup also don't get Korean cards their worth less then toilet paper and have really silly pull rates

There are entire sets that were only released in japan including the 3 vending series sets, the web set, and the vs set. There are substantially more promo cards in Japan than the US.

(I don't think I've seen that one being released in English yet?)  There're also Lottery Rayquaza EX and Giratina EX, but those aren't technically Japanese exclusive as Korea also got them, except if your concept of ""Japanese exclusive"" mean something that aren't printed in English...Both versions are extremely rare to get anyway though..."

pkmntcgcollections,3chrli,aeoth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:05:40 2015 UTC,The Flareon I got from a seller and the three I purchased from a selller at a card shop for $40. He looked desperate for money I thought I'd help out
pkmntcgcollections,3chrli,aeoth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:11:42 2015 UTC,Did the seller know or care that the Blastoise is shadowless? In my experience most card shops never designate shadowless or error prints from the normal versions of the same card.
pkmntcgcollections,3chrli,ChicaSkas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:20:13 2015 UTC,It was a seller within the store that needed a quick buck and didn't seem to care about the subtleties of the card although I did explain it was more rare for x reason
pkmntcgcollections,3chrli,acebren,2,Wed Jul 8 13:58:16 2015 UTC,Would you be willing to sell the flareon? I'll buy :)

pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,errantdog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:38:17 2015 UTC,How much would one need for just a complete set?
pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,robzirra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:14:00 2015 UTC,"In the semi-conservative case where we get 3 or 4 complete sets out of a box, we'd each pay in 91.67 or 68.75 (plus shipping) and then divide the extra sheets evenly. If it turns out the sheets aren't really random and we could get 5 sets out of a box, each of the 5 people would be putting in $55. Basically, it depends how many people chip in, but if fewer people do, there are more extras to trade or resell for each person.  For those who peel complete sets, there will be doubles of all of the commons (I think?) in addition to the extra sheets. They are regularly listed for $1-$2 on eBay, and so some of the price can be recouped there."
pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,robzirra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:41:26 2015 UTC,Hmm. Keep me updated
pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,robzirra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"Will do. If anyone PMs me, I will ask them to comment in this thread. Would like to keep the discussion totally out in the open until we need to send money and contact information.   I think I'll cross-post this to the main subreddit to see if anyone else is interested in unpeeled Series 3 sheets, and I'll contact the eBay seller to ask about the distribution of sheets. Hopefully they will get back to me!"

Apparently the contents are random but he's usually been able to get 4-5 sets from a box.  So, 4 people should be safe, and 5 would probably be okay if we're willing to trade commons amongst each other or if people are willing to pay $55 for an almost guaranteed complete set. I hope we'd get enough of the Ooyama sheet, because that one will be hard to divide up. =/"
pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,ChicaSkas,0,Wed Jul 8 17:57:07 2015 UTC,Has anyone else gotten back to you?
pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,tenaciousm17,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"Someone on the main subreddit seemed definitely interested. So if you're in, we already have 3 people. If we can get one or two more, things will be pretty cheap for us all!  The seller has offered to open a box for me to confirm that at least 4 complete sets are in it. I'm not sure how I feel about that. It would be nice to take out the uncertainty but I'd want to make sure they are safely resealed in such a way that they don't get damaged or slide around during shipping. What do you think?"
pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,tenaciousm17,0,Wed Jul 8 20:29:45 2015 UTC,"Personally. I'm looking for the whole set. I think it'd be easier for us all to just have the set shipped instead of waiting for sheets, contacting a few different people and shipping to several people and waiting for several packages. I'd like a set and maybe an un peeled sheet. But that's just me."
pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,tenaciousm17,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at. Do you mean you don't want to complicate things with the eBay seller? As I understand it, the main buyer in whatever group we arrange (whoever has the most completed trades?) would still have the box of sheets shipped to them, to then distribute to the rest of the group. Everyone involved should only receive one package.  As far as the sets go, they can be sent out as peeled cards or as sets of 18 sheets which would yield a full set and an extra set of commons. I would worry about the main buyer taking responsibility for peeling all of the cards (out of the 1800 cards, a few are likely to be slightly imperfect), but if you'd prefer to have someone else do it, I'm sure it could be worked out that way."

pkmntcgcollections,3chsm1,tenaciousm17,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:25:29 2015 UTC,See my reply above -- it could be as low as $55 plus shipping costs if the boxes contain 5 complete sets and 5 people choose to split the box.

pkmntcgcollections,3cgf81,Ipokeyoumuch,3,Tue Jul 7 18:37:07 2015 UTC,charizards.... seems like the only cards people like getting graded lol
pkmntcgcollections,3cgf81,xmoda,3,Tue Jul 7 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"I grade the cards I like. Right now, I've almost completed my collection of PSA 9 Mega/Primal Full Arts. I'm also working on a collection of Johto legendaries from the 1st Edition Neo Sets (Raikou 1st Edition Holo continues to evade me... -__-)   In my opinion, when it comes to graded cards, it's really not about the resale value you may get in the end (if it was, I'd say Gold Stars, Charizards, etc. would be the only cards worth grading). For me it's all about getting the coolest looking cards in the best condition I can find them and keeping them that way. I also like how graded cards remove any arbitrary definition of condition (a 5 is Excellent, a 9 is Mint, etc.). When you consider how much time and money is spent looking for a Gem Mint card, paying the fees required to get the card graded,  turnaround time, and finding a buyer, grading cards for the sole purpose of reselling for a higher price becomes quite difficult in the long run. My point being: grade the cards you like and do it for the same reason you collect ungraded cards...because it's fun! You won't regret it (at least, I haven't yet lol)"
pkmntcgcollections,3cgf81,mario005,2,Tue Jul 7 19:43:56 2015 UTC,Personally I'm currently using /u/Patriots_fan PSA services. I would consult with them. Very knowledgeable and can usually call your grades from what everyone who uses his services say.  I plan on grading cards for resale so that I can grade the cards I like.  Sometimes they overlap. Sometimes they don't like SR charizard from plasma storm; I don't have two so it's a tough call. But that also goes for two other secret rares I have. It all depends if you have the money for it. Seriously consult with /u/Patriots_fan.
pkmntcgcollections,3cef00,ChicaSkas,7,Tue Jul 7 07:06:11 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one. I'd say keep them sealed. In all likelihood the rares are just a bunch of Lasses and Pokemon Breeders.  There's always a chance, though..."

pkmntcgcollections,3c5qxx,redditking21,6,Sun Jul 5 01:57:16 2015 UTC,honestly for a collector the best thing you can do is ask what they would like rather then buy something maybe they dont really want
pkmntcgcollections,3c5qxx,xmoda,3,Sun Jul 5 02:09:54 2015 UTC,Lucky guy. That's a huge present budget.
pkmntcgcollections,3c5qxx,ChicaSkas,2,Sun Jul 5 07:54:38 2015 UTC,Difficult. You don't want to buy a box that they already have. Don't buy individual booster packs for they may be weighed. Sealed products are safer. No decks. Ask to see the collection then use http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_expansions to determine which they have/what set they may mention wanting to complete or start. As for the black charizard I don't know. I know that plasma storm has the shiny charizard in it but it's a secret rare meaning it's valuable and hard to pull. Hope this helps.
pkmntcgcollections,3c5qxx,primase,2,Sun Jul 5 06:05:00 2015 UTC,"Booster boxes are fun, but if he's an avid collector then he might already have a lot of the cards you're likely to pull from one box, and he may not get anything he really wants from it.   Ask them (but don't be obvious about it) what rare cards they want the most. Then order them a card on ebay or something. Many rare cards will cost less that $100.  Why'd I get downvoted? :("

Your advice is solid, buying a booster box for a collector without knowing that they want that set is risky. Unfortunately there's no easy way to find out what rare cards they need. Asking directly seems a bit obvious. Maybe ask to see their collection binder and they will likely point out gaps on their own. =)"

For $100 you could get a very nice set of ultra rares by doing some ebay hunting. (Make sure to always buy Near Mint/Mint cards! Paying an extra $10 for a card can make a huge difference in the quality!) He might hint at a certain card to complete a certain collection, which I'm sure would mean a huge deal to him!

pkmntcgcollections,3c59hc,unreal94,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:40:29 2015 UTC,I would say Roaring Skies is easy because there are only about 110 cards. Any sets with fewer than 100 cards are easy.... Jungle is also exceptionally easy as it is only 64 cards!

I did notice you didn't add the Vaporeon European Regional Dark Explorers Promo, or the JR Rally Black Star Nonholo Eevee (released in Japan, but an english card). I should also point out that it's extremely difficult to find the nonholo Pop 3 eeveelutions. I've been searching for about a year now and have found 1 for sale, but it's PSA graded so I don't want to pay that premium for it. Good luck with this collection."

For the POP 3 I thought there were non-holos but after ordering a set I realised they were holo (which I already had) so thought maybe there weren't any. I had never heard of the JR Rally Eevee but I see that it should be on my list now."
pkmntcgcollections,3bz75d,ortizr93,2,Fri Jul 3 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"Good luck with the gold stars, Espeon and Umbreon will be a pain in the wallet to get"
pkmntcgcollections,3bz75d,FourMakesTwoUNLESS,3,Fri Jul 3 10:55:26 2015 UTC,At least they are easy to find. Money isn't the issue it's things like the 1st edition neo cards and reverse holo aquapolis/skyridge that are proving difficult to even find for sale  (and to make it harder I live on a tiny island that eBayers often don't ship to)

pkmntcgcollections,3bx039,ortizr93,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:27:43 2015 UTC,I always buy at least a booster box of each new set that comes out as that usually gets you at least 85% of the set. I also buy large bundles on ebay or from others in my town/city which nets you a ton of older cards and an overall good mix. The bigger the set the cheaper it is per card usually but of course is a bigger up front investment

I got alot of heat for it last time when I went to play at a card shop, saying I shuffle too slow, and their just cards.  No they're are not just cards, when you have a deck full of FA and SR, the last thing to want is to see it damage. The other guy that was playing with me look much older, and all his cards were destroyed and bent to hell. After that, I only play with friends."
pkmntcgcollections,3bukgm,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:13:55 2015 UTC,I use ultra pro personally as ( to me at least) they have  more quality feel to their products   I double sleeve by putting the card into an ultra pro pro fit in such a way that the bottom of the card is where the opening is I then place it in a pro matte deck protector with the opening of the pro fit facing down into the bottom of the deck protector
pkmntcgcollections,3bukgm,errantdog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:49:38 2015 UTC,"To each their own! I find nothing matches the quality of KMC Perfect Fits. The Ultra Pro perfect size sleeves didn't slide onto the card easily for me, and seemed to have rough, irregular edges. Maybe mine were just a bad batch but reviews of inner sleeves have had similar complaints to mine.  The KMC sleeves are more expensive but it's still only several cents per sleeve."
pkmntcgcollections,3bukgm,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:33:03 2015 UTC,I am aware of those complaints and had one pack where a few of the sleeves didn't even fit properly they were way too tight as if they were intended to be used with ygo sized cards  I use ultra pro because it's the most commonly available brand for me not because I think they're better I haven't used kmc so I couldn't honestly say that they are
pkmntcgcollections,3bukgm,Isakksson,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:23:24 2015 UTC,"I use the KMC Ultra Fit or what ever they are called + their standard sleeves.

pkmntcgcollections,3bukgm,56k_mode,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:49:34 2015 UTC,"I use tight fitting sleeves (e.g. kmc fits, ultra pro fits) then a deck protector. If I want it to be extra protected I use a penny sleeve over that then a toploader. A bit overkill, but hey why not :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3bszf4,thecardpletionist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:10:34 2015 UTC,"Generally, you pay a premium for (1) complete sets and (2) higher PSA grades. Here you have a complete set of the most popular English set and all but 2 cards are the highest PSA grade. The fact that all of the cards are graded is also a huge value boost. The most expensive card in the set is the PSA 10 Charizard. One of those recently sold for about $3,500 on ebay. That leaves you with another $16,500 to find in the remaining 102 cards. It's tough to say if its there. Collections like these are really rare so its hard to accurately judge the price. I think the asking price is too high, but its not ludicrous."
pkmntcgcollections,3bszf4,thecardpletionist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I can't afford it at all right now, but I thought it was interesting. I'm getting into collecting, and I wanted to see what people liked their cards to look like, and it's hard for me to justify not grading every single card I get now."
pkmntcgcollections,3bszf4,ortizr93,2,Wed Jul 1 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Grading is a plus but personally I try to buy ungraded to avoid paying the premium (with some exceptions). Grading cards is itself pretty expensive, so I would only grade my really valuable cards. Then again, I have a huge collection so any other approach to grading is financially impractical for me. If you're in the hobby to make money, grading is the way to do it."
pkmntcgcollections,3bszf4,thecardpletionist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"http://www.dacardworld.com/gaming/pokemon-base-set-1-1st-edition-shadowless-complete-set-psa-graded  Most of the non-holos are 10s there for $8k, so if the 16 holos could be picked up for $12k it works out about the same"
pkmntcgcollections,3bszf4,CommVenus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:10:26 2015 UTC,"I see your point and have 2 comments.  1) A big part of the 8K value comes from the holos. So you would need to take out the value of the holos to get a better estimate of the value of the non-holo lot. For example, the PSA 6 charizard sold as a single is worth about $600. Suddenly you're down to $7,400 with 15 more cards to subtract. 2) the asking price doesn't necessarily reflect the value of the item. Dacardworld has been trying to sell this set for several months now (I completed my 1st edition base set in May but had been following the market for some time before that). They were originally asking almost 10K for it. The asking price for this lot could drop below 8K given more time. So when compared to DA's suggested price, 19K still seems high (in my opinion)."
pkmntcgcollections,3bszf4,Kennaay1891,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"They also all appear to be shadowless, which could definitely drive the price up."

I would just check the prices compared to pokeorder.com and trollandtoad.com because those are the main websites that sell cards. Seller rating are very important to look at as well. Sometimes you have to settle for a seller you're not sure if because you need a very rare card. I bought a masaki gengar and thank god that I did because I can't find the card now on eBay."
pkmntcgcollections,3bk6hm,xmoda,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:15:33 2015 UTC,"Btw, trollandtoad and pokeorder are solid places to buy cards from."
pkmntcgcollections,3bk6hm,ortizr93,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:17:48 2015 UTC,yes this but if you can find for cheaper on ebay (sometimes even Amazon) do that also you can look through sold listing on ebay search options
pkmntcgcollections,3bk6hm,ortizr93,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:55:35 2015 UTC,I would love to order from these guys but shipping to Ireland just kills it hence why I am looking to eBay
pkmntcgcollections,3bk6hm,ortizr93,2,Tue Jun 30 08:03:27 2015 UTC,"If you're ordering from T&T and you just order singles, shipping is just $5 to places like the UK and Ireland if you spend $50. I wouldn't buy anything like single packs or anything that requires a larger package because that's when you get into $20+ shipping territory."
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,buckanater160,3,Sun Jun 28 20:36:17 2015 UTC,"I packed one of the Japanese Fossil Mew cards when I was younger and it was my absolute favourite as Mew was only a promo in the English game. The Legendary Collection RH Venusaur is peng too, really wish I'd collected more of that set"
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,ortizr93,2,Sun Jun 28 22:12:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I really value these legendary collection reverse holos. Even the common and uncommon ones just because of how cool they look. I have the pikachu as well.
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,ortizr93,2,Sun Jun 28 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"I think I only had a few because it came out when I started bowing to peer pressure and giving up Pokemon, but I'm pretty sure I have a RH Dratini which is lucky as it's one of my favourite Pokemon."
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,Shezarrine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:19:51 2015 UTC,That's a great card to have though! I look at cards like that as rare/holo because of scarce each type of card like that is.
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,burner_7,2,Mon Jun 29 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"I love those Japanese CD promos so much.  Been meaning to get the set but they're a bit high on ebay atm ($70 last I checked, were $50 a few months back)"
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,C7H5BiO4,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:15:05 2015 UTC,I don't even remember how much they were the years ago that I got them actually... Probably my favorite artwork from Ken Sugimori as well.
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,wordskis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:53:51 2015 UTC,Those are so nice!
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,wordskis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"Dang. I've been collecting some of the old Pokemon rares (from Base Set/Base Set 2 (whichever I can get my hands on first), Fossil, and Jungle), since a card shop near me has some pretty cheap old rares. Seeing the trinity of Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise makes me wish they weren't so dang expensive."
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,S1LV3RH00D,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:00:19 2015 UTC,"You can get all 3 for like $30-40 total depending on condition. I have a fairly played condition Venusaur for sale for $4.50, if you're interested."
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,weaponxi90,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:11:36 2015 UTC,"I love those promo starters, I only have Venusaur so far. You need to exchange that Zard for a Base set!"
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,Yuphrum,2,Sun Jun 28 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"I really do! Actually, I would also really like to collect all three reverse holo legendary collection starters as well."
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,mistamuella,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:47:53 2015 UTC,Whats with rhe two venusaurs on the right?
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,JDismyfriend,2,Mon Jun 29 04:35:36 2015 UTC,One I believe is German and the other is legendary collection reverse holo.
pkmntcgcollections,3bfpfv,OzEnigma2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"Nice! I've got the promo blastoise, wish I had the Zard and Venasuar.  I do have a LC RH Charizard, but it's got some dings in it."
pkmntcgcollections,3bexq2,paul_123,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:39:48 2015 UTC,I really wanted to pull that FA Rayquaza to :)
pkmntcgcollections,3bexq2,primase,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:40:38 2015 UTC,Nice. You picked up a 3 pack or 3 individuals?
pkmntcgcollections,3bexq2,primase,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"3 individuals, I was going to get a tin but the shop owner was just opening up a booster box for the display so I tried my luck with that instead. Glad I did :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3bexq2,buckanater160,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:03:32 2015 UTC,Nice
pkmntcgcollections,3bexq2,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:13:14 2015 UTC,That rayquaza is a beast!
pkmntcgcollections,3bexq2,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"Ikr, really like the artwork on it"
pkmntcgcollections,3bexq2,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"Nice, the full art Rayquaza is one of only 6 cards I've yet to afire from Roaring Skies so I'm very jealous!"
pkmntcgcollections,3beoch,recket,3,Sun Jun 28 15:09:35 2015 UTC,"I finally finished opening my first box- I like opening a pack each day so it took a while.   Anyway, while touching up the image I happened to select inverted colors, and some of the cards looked pretty cool. You guys have seen a lot of Roaring Skies pulls, so I figured this would be a more interesting way to show mine."
pkmntcgcollections,3beoch,Jsmurff,3,Sun Jun 28 15:10:39 2015 UTC,Now that looks awesome would love some inverted cards that ancient trait articuno looks like a SR
pkmntcgcollections,3beoch,paul_123,2,Sun Jun 28 15:42:41 2015 UTC,"Golden Articuno and black hole Mega Turbo, nice :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3beoch,Moread,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, why did you collect all the holos together and not in the set order, with 110 card slots? I understand if you only buy a pack or two and are nowhere near a complete set, but for someone who opened a box, why not put them in order?"
pkmntcgcollections,3beoch,ChicaSkas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:55:02 2015 UTC,"Fair question- as it happens I was only adding the nicer cards to my portfolio for safekeeping and to photograph my pulls, so they are in no particular order apart from when they were pulled (sort of).   You see I don't generally aim for complete sets, rather I organize the cards I like by artist, and sometimes aesthetic interest. Indeed I plan to sell or trade many of the cards I pulled."

pkmntcgcollections,3be56r,Jsmurff,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:46:59 2015 UTC,well that white kyruem is from one of the current theme decks you can buy from walmart and while you have already gotten your money back all i can say is wow they are bent. that curve hurts my spirit of collection.
pkmntcgcollections,3be56r,wordskis,-1,Thu Jul 2 02:02:24 2015 UTC,Don't want to be an ass but I think you overpaid as 14 of those appear to be badly bowed/warped don't see how you can get the money back as a collector I wouldn't  give those cards a second glance let alone put money on them
pkmntcgcollections,3be56r,Jsmurff,2,Sun Jun 28 12:26:18 2015 UTC,"OP didn't even remotely overpay. Just the top row is easily $33 by itself. And most old-school ex's are a few bucks even in rough shape. Rocket's Snorlax ex is about $10, even in that condition."
pkmntcgcollections,3be56r,paul_123,2,Sun Jun 28 18:36:04 2015 UTC,Sold 5 of the cards for 34 dollars already :)
pkmntcgcollections,3be56r,birdoflightning,2,Sun Jun 28 20:30:10 2015 UTC,Oh right… well I guess I stand corrected then sorry about that
pkmntcgcollections,3be56r,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:15:10 2015 UTC,You can fix warping though and I even heard somewhere that warping doesn't effect the grading of a card
pkmntcgcollections,3be56r,paul_123,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:26:47 2015 UTC,I can confirm that warping does not affect grading having sent a slightly warped card myself.
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,robzirra,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:13:24 2015 UTC,Just bought the box on ebay - so excited!
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,recket,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:03:50 2015 UTC,Are these holo full arts?
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,Jsmurff,2,Sun Jun 28 15:40:16 2015 UTC,Yeah
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,Jsmurff,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:03:06 2015 UTC,Well in that case I must have them at once!
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,Jsmurff,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:16:23 2015 UTC,Looks like people were getting the whole box for just a bit more though.
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,xmoda,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:41:50 2015 UTC,Yeah there's nothing better then opening sealed product even when you know what's inside besides you run the risk of damage buying them as singles all it would take one sorting machine to chew em up
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,aqlno,2,Mon Jun 29 09:53:52 2015 UTC,Heard that!
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,MoneyDealer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:27:55 2015 UTC,eh itll be cheaper in a bit i think i just bought a make believe box cant wait for it!
pkmntcgcollections,3beisg,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:45:08 2015 UTC,Wow really?   I got the whole box for $48 w/ free shipping on eBay.

pkmntcgcollections,3be2it,Jsmurff,3,Sun Jun 28 10:26:04 2015 UTC,That's a lot of UR's for 7 packs!!! Unbelievable luck well done!
pkmntcgcollections,3be2it,ortizr93,3,Sun Jun 28 12:21:11 2015 UTC,"It was 13 packs, since it was 3 blisters, and a tin."
pkmntcgcollections,3be2it,Darth_Mail,3,Sun Jun 28 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"Great going though, especially the secret rare!"
pkmntcgcollections,3be2it,Jsmurff,2,Sun Jun 28 14:05:55 2015 UTC,Didn't know it was a secret rare utill I really looked at it. XY had a weird way of doing SR.

pkmntcgcollections,3be2it,ChicaSkas,2,Sun Jun 28 17:11:06 2015 UTC,Ah I read blisters as boosters still pretty good pulls for the amount of packs

pkmntcgcollections,3bc3qz,ortizr93,5,Sat Jun 27 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"I told my dad that I wanted to get back into Pokemon now that I've just finished my degree and will be graduating in a few weeks and as it was something we really bonded over when I was younger he was really pleased. As you can see, like myself, he likes to go overboard when collecting and so got me a Flashfire box, two theme decks, and two tins to help my restart to collecting.  I was over the moon with the Flashfire pulls; I just wanted any Charizard, but to get the FA EX as well as one of the secret rares was far more than I expected. I wish the Kangaskhan wasn't miscut though, that's my only gripe with the pulls.  As for the Gameboy Colour he ordered me, I was shocked. I really didn't expect it and I'm so pleased with it - we got my old Pokemon games out of the loft and a shedload of AA batteries so I can play them again while I apply for Masters degrees/ graduate jobs."
pkmntcgcollections,3bc3qz,Jsmurff,5,Sat Jun 27 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"Nice pulls man :) wish my parents would get me stuff like this without looking at me like I've three heads ""Your twenty-fucking-four an you want what for your birthday!?!?!?"" Fml"

pkmntcgcollections,3bc3qz,Jsmurff,2,Sun Jun 28 03:41:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's a deep psychological reaction haha. I just finished uni so me getting back into the game was through fear of what lies ahead and reverting to something that brought me joy as a child. Same for my dad - the thought of me growing up and leaving home makes this something that might keep me around for a bit longer.  Or ya know, Pokemon rocks and that psychology stuff is all bs lol"
pkmntcgcollections,3bc3qz,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:21:36 2015 UTC,Lol yeah probably why I got back into it as well although my parents can't wait to get me out of the house!!!   but yeah Pokemon definitely rocks!

pkmntcgcollections,3baonq,Jsmurff,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:37:08 2015 UTC,That will be expensive if your not too fussy I suggest getting Japanese booster box's or singles they can be got on eBay for pretty cheap with free shipping from Japan.  Obviously the further back you go the more you'll have to spend if you focus on newer sets (like I am doing) you can get more bang for your buck and use any duplicate rare's as trades for older rare's
pkmntcgcollections,3baonq,ChicaSkas,2,Sat Jun 27 14:41:37 2015 UTC,"OK, thank you for the info! :)"

pkmntcgcollections,3b9f4c,primase,2,Sat Jun 27 02:03:08 2015 UTC,You get this out of the plasma boosters at Walmart? That how I got mine. Unfortunately they no longer update their stock sadly.
pkmntcgcollections,3b9f4c,primase,3,Sat Jun 27 02:06:19 2015 UTC,I got it from a card shop
pkmntcgcollections,3b9f4c,DarkoHexar,3,Sat Jun 27 02:17:38 2015 UTC,Wish I had a card shop
pkmntcgcollections,3b9f4c,primase,2,Sat Jun 27 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"No longer update their stock? You mean your particular Walmart, or is that a trend through all of them? Because I know mine has some Freeze and Storm packs, but also some Roaring Skies, though I was surprised there were so many left. Has there been another run of those sets recently?"
pkmntcgcollections,3b9f4c,DarkoHexar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:40:07 2015 UTC,Both actually. I tried getting in contact with Mjholding the vendor but no success. I tried the Pokemon company but they said they may not be selling well so yeah.
pkmntcgcollections,3b9f4c,primase,2,Sat Jun 27 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"""Both"" referring to your particular location and the franchise in general? Pretty unfortunate, that. If they stop stocking them here, I won't really have any other locations to get them from either :c"
pkmntcgcollections,3b9f4c,alcaponesuite,2,Sat Jun 27 19:24:15 2015 UTC,Yes the region tends not to care and I think one of the stores someone is weighing packs.  I am trading my bulk for an ancient origins box so I got that going for me. Hopefully they don't forget to send me it when it releases.

pkmntcgcollections,3b9xzd,robzirra,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:33:32 2015 UTC,"Nope. all of these came from Booster packs. Scratching my head right now because I've been googling all over and can't find anything. About all i've narrowed it down to , is that there should technically be NO non holo card. A Landorus Non Holo 58/111 is on Ebay now for $6.00. The lister is calling it an ""Ultra Rare""... this is so confusing lol!"
pkmntcgcollections,3b9xzd,Jsmurff,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:46:38 2015 UTC,Quite a few sellers are unscrupulous putting phrases like that into their item heading to make it show up in as much searches as possible or to dupe someone into buying it by false means I see it all the time when looking on eBay.  From what I understand all HR have a NHR and a RHR but not all NHR have a HR. In a master set there is a RH of every card but the UR and SR so even cards that are only NHR will have a RH aswell as the C's/UC's
pkmntcgcollections,3b9xzd,RDM2120,2,Sat Jun 27 08:42:04 2015 UTC,Most Holo Rares only have a Holo Rare version and a Reverse-Holo Rare version. Some have Non-Holo Rare versions in theme decks (such as Aromatisse from XY) but those are usually exclusives of some kind.
pkmntcgcollections,3b9xzd,Jsmurff,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:00:39 2015 UTC,Oh right would make more sense if there was 3 versions in the set

pkmntcgcollections,3b73x8,Audacidy,2,Fri Jun 26 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"I just started collecting 2 months ago and I've completed Roaring Skies, Flashfire, and XY Base so far. Furious Fists needs 1 more card to be completed, Phantom Forces 3 cards, and Primal Clash 19 cards."
pkmntcgcollections,3b73x8,ortizr93,2,Fri Jun 26 14:38:50 2015 UTC,I wish I'd gotten back into collecting a few months earlier so I could've picked up the A4 portfolios at a better price but they're impossible to find for decent prices for the early XY sets now. They look great!
pkmntcgcollections,3b73x8,Eiriklago,3,Fri Jun 26 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, $25-$30 for a binder isn't cheap. Luckily I got the XY for free though. I'm worried for when I start the BW sets. Those binders are going to be hard to find."
pkmntcgcollections,3b73x8,thecardpletionist,2,Fri Jun 26 14:52:54 2015 UTC,Those look good.. Puts my black ones to shame :P
pkmntcgcollections,3b73x8,wordskis,2,Fri Jun 26 16:54:21 2015 UTC,Very nice. What a classy way to display your collection.
pkmntcgcollections,3b6vim,buckanater160,2,Fri Jun 26 13:24:27 2015 UTC,Awesome
pkmntcgcollections,3b6vim,Jsmurff,2,Fri Jun 26 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"Looks great, I really want to add some BW cards to my collection over this summer"
pkmntcgcollections,3b6vim,ortizr93,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:46:17 2015 UTC,The plasma full art cards from black and white are great!
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,Moread,8,Fri Jun 26 12:53:38 2015 UTC,"well, historically, just because of the Charizard factor alone, I would say Flashfire..."
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,Giasonas,2,Fri Jun 26 13:15:40 2015 UTC,As already mentioned because of the charizards I would do flashfire and yes I would do ancient origins when it's released as there will be a tone of ex/ur/sr in that set   I only base my choice on the fact that these sets have allot of cool ur/sr as that is what I collect I don't do full sets
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,Jsmurff,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:30:20 2015 UTC,Do you have the black and white sets already? I would stop doing roaring skies and do flashfire and phantom forces. The sets have been dropping in quality from what I've seen. Furious fists is pretty good too! I would not do primal clash either.
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,buckanater160,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:28:17 2015 UTC,Primal clash just felt really bleh to me.
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,robzirra,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:20:46 2015 UTC,My favorite XY sets so far are phantom forces and furious fists :]
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,Iowgan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:56:30 2015 UTC,I loved getting into furious fists because of how themed all the art is.

pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,ChicaSkas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"Look at the cards and collect whichever set you like the most. I love Charizard and Rayquaza so I'm collecting entire sets of Flashfire and Roaring Skies. Roaring Skies has some really pretty holos, too. :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:22:46 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Double Crisis/Magma Gang VS Aqua Gang. You can pretty much complete the set with one box (only 34 cards) and I think the artwork is excellent throughout.  [edit] My experience is only with Japanese cards, I can't speak for English ones"
pkmntcgcollections,3b6sa1,matubula,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:26:31 2015 UTC,I agree! The cards are actually really awesome!

If you're lucky you might make a few bucks off these cards, since some of them are worth a crazy amount of money online. Especially those shiny pokemon cards that goes for hundreds of dollars."
pkmntcgcollections,3b3it0,thecardpletionist,4,Thu Jun 25 17:52:30 2015 UTC,That is the most badass magikarp ever!
pkmntcgcollections,3b3it0,Creature_73L,2,Thu Jun 25 18:55:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. It knows dragon rage (which is hilarious). A reprint was produced for the japanese web set which makes for a much more affordable way to go after the card.
pkmntcgcollections,3b3it0,edgeorge92,2,Thu Jun 25 19:07:46 2015 UTC,Never seen a University Magikarp in this sub before. Really really nice ! These singles are worth more than my collection of 10+ years ;_;

I showed my girlfriend the unikarp and she was like ""its a fish."" No honey, its a rare fish.   I made this post when I got the unikarp http://imgur.com/0zvuwyx the card came with some of the original documentation from the tournament. Its worth taking a look at if you're interested."

I've come across a few sellers on ebay that have helped me acquire the cards. Japanese websites are probably the best bet. Next on the list I'd like to complete the 1st edition PSA 10 shining neo destiny cards. Otherwise, I'm just finishing up the remaining sets. Aquapolis is probably next. I'm also working on some Japanese promo sets. I'm currently working on the PLAY cards and the shining lottery promos. Maybe I'll make a post about those next.  I guess I'm also casually collecting base set in other languages. I have the first edition german version and unlimited spanish so far."

pkmntcgcollections,3b3it0,Creature_73L,2,Sat Jun 27 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"Woah, how valuable are they?"
pkmntcgcollections,3b3it0,Creature_73L,2,Thu Jun 25 17:59:13 2015 UTC,Very valuable. Thousand dollar + range.

pkmntcgcollections,3b3it0,DemoORAS,4,Thu Jun 25 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"The card was given out as part of the Parent/Child Mega Battle Tournament in Japan, May 1998. Parents and kids entered as a team (very appropriate for Kangaskhan) and teams that won a certain number of matches were awarded the card. The card was illustrated by Ken Sugimori and has not been reprinted, making it extra appealing to collectors. It is unknown exactly how many copies of the card exist, but most collectors estimate the number to be between 30 - 50 copies."

pkmntcgcollections,3b3kli,Moread,4,Thu Jun 25 18:05:03 2015 UTC,From this point buying singles will probably be the most cost-effective way for you to complete the collection
pkmntcgcollections,3b3kli,ortizr93,5,Thu Jun 25 19:10:00 2015 UTC,Just go for singles if you are missing only ultra rares. Most of them go for less than what you'd pay if you bought boosters until you got them.
pkmntcgcollections,3b3kli,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:34:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you have that much of the set, it's a waste of time to keep buying packs, you should devote your precious cash to singles here or on Ebay or something... in my humble opinion"
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,zoiks66,6,Thu Jun 25 04:28:34 2015 UTC,I would never buy loose packs off eBay.
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,Audacidy,0,Thu Jun 25 05:29:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think they were weighed.  I've tested and holo and regular EX cards weigh the same, so you can't differentiate when weighing packs between a pack with a holo and a pack with a regular EX card.  7 holo/regular EX/FA EX cards in 26 packs isn't too bad.  I just got unlucky that 5 of the 7 cards were holos.  FA EX cards weigh more than holo and regular EX cards, and I got 1 FA EX.  Those are the easiest packs to identify from weighing."
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,Audacidy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:33:18 2015 UTC,"One of those AT Gyarados is a reverse holo. But I mean if they were weighed or not, there's really no way to prove it."
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,Asclepius24,2,Thu Jun 25 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"You are correct.  1 Gyarados is a RH.  I normally wouldn't buy loose packs either, but these were a couple weeks early birthday present for my 9 year old nephew, who is a big fan of Pokemon.  He now thinks I'm some sort of magical wizard since the Target near me had Primal Clash, Double Crisis, and Roaring Skies boosters for sale a couple weeks early, and now these Ancient Origin boosters were almost 2 months early. :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,Asclepius24,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:55:12 2015 UTC,That's a pretty excellent reason to go for these :)  Happy to see the Lysandre reprint as well. As far as I can see you're the first to have that info confirmed. Have you been in touch with any sites like Beach to get things posted?
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,Asclepius24,3,Thu Jun 25 05:56:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't.  I'm not sure I'd have time to scan them in the next day anyways.  I do have the cards at my house though.  I always sort them and put them in a binder for my nephew.  It leaves us more time to play Mario Kart when I'm at my sister's house, rather than sort cards. Nothing beats taunting a 9 year old with quotes from The Wire while playing Mario Kart.  It goes like this:  He fires green turtle shell at me and misses.  Me: ""Come at the king, you best not miss!""  He complains when he loses due to a last second red turtle shell.  Me:  ""All in the game, yo.  All in the game.""  The look on his face when I say these things is pretty awesome."
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:01:34 2015 UTC,"Totally reasonable, scanning takes a bunch of time. The Lysandre would be solid news, though, if you wanted to send even that photo you have there along. I'm moderately biased since I'm on staff at Beach but it would be cool for the community to know about that reprint :)"

pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,xmoda,4,Thu Jun 25 08:21:37 2015 UTC,"I assume you're the one who bought those from Crazy_leesta? I saw the listing on eBay, and am almost 99% certain he weighed them. I messaged him to ask if he had any Full Arts from the set, and he said he pulled a few. Was only willing to sell for ""the right price"", last I heard from him. Also, the fact that he's only selling in lots of 26 is sketchy.   He probably threw in a Ex or two (or miss-weighed one). Otherwise, I don't know why he decided to only sell 26 at a time...  Edit: looks like he sold everything he had. Can't believe someone bid ,$60 on the FA Kyurem..."
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,Lugiabomb,2,Thu Jun 25 08:19:49 2015 UTC,"After seeing the pull posted here glad I didn't bid on the packs on the ebay you are referring to. It did came across my mind as well that pack had of been weighed. I was tempted to bid for the ebay auction but it ended up at over $140 on ebay, I think I can wait a month more for two boxes instead of risking buying weighed pack to get nothing in pulls."
pkmntcgcollections,3b1d2b,ReggieMcGigas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:37:59 2015 UTC,I didn't pay near that amount.  The seller accepted an offer I made.

pkmntcgcollections,3b15ay,lopik980,3,Thu Jun 25 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to contact the people at Pokemon.com, and show them pictures and proof of purchase. The only thing is they don't carry single cards, so they would just sent you a booster pack, or maybe a tin.  As for the card, it sucks it happen to a really rare one, but I wouldn't glue it with just any glue since it would look ugly. You need the glue that they use for their cards. I say try to sell it as it is as an error card on ebay."
pkmntcgcollections,3b15ay,DictatorMad,2,Thu Jun 25 08:21:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on the kind of cards, actually. I had them replace a Metagross EX and M Metagross EX individually. Looks like the regular Metagross EX is the only PSA10 one at the moment too"
pkmntcgcollections,3b15ay,_Mr_Brightside_,2,Thu Jun 25 14:47:30 2015 UTC,I would just put it in a sleeve. That's really the best I can think of

pkmntcgcollections,3awor0,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:12:06 2015 UTC,Welcome to the world of autocorrect. Heh.  Hoopa-Ray is on its way. And I only need like less than $90 in cards now.
pkmntcgcollections,3awor0,ReggieMcGigas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:29:08 2015 UTC,Could I borrow some of your luck?! PRETTY PLEASE?!?!?!  Very nice pulls man didn't know there was a h/RH bannette only saw NH in opening vids
pkmntcgcollections,3awor0,ReggieMcGigas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:42:58 2015 UTC,"Calling BS on that, 10 URs in 15 packs. Not legit. You can't get 10 UR's in a 36 pack box much less half of that."
pkmntcgcollections,3atee8,56k_mode,3,Tue Jun 23 10:41:08 2015 UTC,"It's tough to tell through toploaders and the glare. The tricky part about grading newer cards, particularly those from the past couple years, are the corners and edges on the back. Pack-fresh cards likely don't have scratches or scuffs but many have chips and dings from the cutting process, and that's what can be the difference between a 10 and a 9 or even lower."
pkmntcgcollections,3atee8,Asclepius24,3,Tue Jun 23 11:04:29 2015 UTC,Would really need to see the backs as well
pkmntcgcollections,3atee8,ortizr93,3,Tue Jun 23 10:52:27 2015 UTC,If I had to pick one it would be the Uxie lv x holo but I only base that choice one the fact that most of the newer sets are riddled with errors so there's a better chance of it getting a high grade compared to the rest of the cards
pkmntcgcollections,3atee8,Jsmurff,2,Tue Jun 23 12:18:57 2015 UTC,"Just looking at the FA MGallade EX you can see that the frame isn't centered on the card. That will hurt the grade. As others have said it is hard to tell through the toploaders but the Uxie may have potential. It is a cost benefit analysis of the risk of sending in a card to be graded but ending up with a poor grade, likely not boosting the card's value. It would make sense to know the criteria they look for and inspecting your own cards closely to see if they meet the high standards."
pkmntcgcollections,3atee8,nealappeal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"Damn, any idea how much that would affect the grade of the MGallade?"
pkmntcgcollections,3atee8,hiltzy85,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"MGallade in general I don't think is valuable enough to bother grading it, unless you're more or less 100% sure that it's perfect.  You can buy NM/M ones online for $8-10, which I assume would typically be graded as 7 to 9"
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,SakiatoMakiato,6,Tue Jun 23 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I offer PSA grading services for other members on here. I prefer PSA over BGS because the value of cards increases more when graded by PSA than it does for BGS graded cards (plus, it's more convenient for me since I live less than an hour away from PSA's Newport Beach location). For example, this  BGS 9.5 Base Charizard went for $46. A PSA 10 (equivalent of a BGS 9.5) would never auction for that low of a price, because it's the more popular grading service and everyone is always on the lookout for those.  Of course, the value is more important if you're trying to sell some of the cards you grade. Not saying it isn't important if you're only going to collect, but it helps whenever you need or decide to sell some graded cards.  I used to submit through SilverSnorlax204, but it didn't make sense for me to ship my cards to someone on the East coast, when I'm 55 mins away from PSA lol, so I ended up getting my own membership. SilverSnorlax is very friendly and helpful, and has been into PSA grading a lot longer than I have.   Of course, I'd recommend my service lol but you probably want unbiased opinions haha, so I'll leave that up to you to decide. If you do decide to submit through me, I'll be glad to have you on board :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,Patriots_Fan,2,Tue Jun 23 06:41:57 2015 UTC,What are your rates? How long does the process last? Do you offer discounts? What are your references? Is there any paper work I must fill out?
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,Patriots_Fan,2,Tue Jun 23 06:53:28 2015 UTC,"$9 per card, free return shipping. PSA states the grading process to last approximately 50 business days, but that varies depending on how busy they are. They usually have finished my submissions sooner than that, but it can take as long or longer than that. I've been thinking about discounts and adding in free stuff with people's subs based on sending me X number of cards for grading, but haven't made a final decision on that. I'll gladly hear any offer you have as far as a discount is concerned, though it probably won't be feasible for just a card or two, since I'm taking on the return shipping already.  You can check my refs here for the trading sub, and you can see my eBay refs here. No, I take care of all the paperwork for you :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,errantdog,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:07:07 2015 UTC,How much would you charge for return shipping to Canada?
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:43:11 2015 UTC,"Normally it would be $5-8 with tracking, depending on the # of cards sent since USPS charges mostly based on weight of the package. For larger orders, if shipping goes to $10+, I'd cover half the cost."
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,ortizr93,2,Tue Jun 23 19:10:29 2015 UTC,"There was one thing I always wondered - say myself and another redditor sent you the same card to send off to PSA, both in pristine condition, you couldn't tell them apart.  If one came back a 9 and the other a 10, how do you know whose is whose? This is the biggest put off for me haha"
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,OzEnigma2,3,Tue Jun 23 07:06:50 2015 UTC,"Not the person who should answer this, but every card has a line associated with an order. That means you should have that line number before it get graded and that way could tell if anyone switched it. That's how I interperet the grading paperwork anyway. Could very well be wrong.  Of course it is up to the submitter to have ethics and morals and not change them around before doing paperwork. I would never suspect /u/Patriots_Fan of doing that though."
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,Patriots_Fan,2,Tue Jun 23 07:13:27 2015 UTC,"I took a quick screenshot of some cards I submitted a while ago, to show what you meant by the Line #:   http://i.imgur.com/FAy8hI0.jpg    In this case, the 3 cards where mine but as mentioned in my previous reply, Member A's Base Zard would be ""Item #1"" and Member B's Zard would be ""Item #2"".   I'm sure people would find out real quick if I switched the cards, but either way, it's not something I would do. I like helping out others with their collections, and wouldn't want to ruin that by switching cards. Hope this helps clear that up :P  Edit: PSA is aware of the duplicate issue, which is probably why they label each duplicate as "" Item #1, #2, etc"" but I still take some precautions, just in case. Not sure if anyone remembers, but I posted my PSA 10 Japanese Charizard Gold Star in one of my trade posts on the trading sub, and PSA somehow mixed up the label with my Crystal Charizard in that submission... Had to resubmit it to get the label fixed."
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,Patriots_Fan,4,Tue Jun 23 07:36:44 2015 UTC,"I always make sure to make a note of who's card was received first, and that card will then go first in the stack of cards. I'll add in some of my own cards that are completely different, in between the duplicates so that the cards aren't mixed up (I.e. two people send me their Base Set Charizards, and I add in a Mewtwo FA and Seismitoad FA in between the two). I also advice that you take pics/scans of the cards before sending, so that you can verify that the card (and grade) match the cards you sent.  This is the most common question I am asked, so you're not the only one. Hopefully this post clears that up for other members as well :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,primase,4,Tue Jun 23 07:23:13 2015 UTC,I am getting some cards done through /u/patriots_fan. He seems trustworthy. Talk to him.

pkmntcgcollections,3asr2j,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:09:20 2015 UTC,Also recommend /u/Patriots_Fan. Helped me out with grading and kept me informed when PSA made a mistake and my card had to be resubmitted.

pkmntcgcollections,3apctc,joesaysso,3,Mon Jun 22 12:23:13 2015 UTC,Could be wrong and I don't have the details at hand but I think the dates at the bottom of the cards identify what run they're from.

pkmntcgcollections,3alp1w,matubula,4,Sun Jun 21 13:09:33 2015 UTC,"From one box (6 cards x 15 packs) I got both Kyogre and Groudon EX.   I've opened a couple of random packs before, so I can't say explicitly that you can complete the entire set (34 cards) with only one box. But from 17 packs, I completed the entire set once, and in duplicates, except the 2 EX's and a single trainer."
pkmntcgcollections,3alp1w,Baileycu,3,Sun Jun 21 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"Very nice! I got a japanese team magma vs team aqua box that comes in today. I hope I complete the set like you. It's really cool that Japan has smaller, cheaper booster boxes like this. I see no english booster box for this set just some blister packs which have totally random pulls whereas the booster boxes seem to be standardized (looks like 2-4 URs per japanese box). Also I read japanese cards are better quality so it's partly why I got it too."
pkmntcgcollections,3alp1w,OzEnigma2,2,Sun Jun 21 13:35:15 2015 UTC,You will complete the set from 1 box. Haven't heard of any that haven't.
pkmntcgcollections,3alp1w,Baileycu,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"I imagine you'll really like opening these, like I did. The artwork on most cards is excellent, they're like little grabs of a comic book with a little story in them.  This was my first modern Japanese box, and I've only opened 4 packs of modern English cards, but yes, the quality definitely does seem higher.  If you don't complete it, but you probably will, we could trade. I'm in the UK."
pkmntcgcollections,3alp1w,Jsmurff,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:07:28 2015 UTC,"I opened it up and I did end up getting the full set! I got some first pack magic and pulled Team Magma's Groudon on the first pack. I got Team Aqua's Kyogre on the 7th and then completed the whole set on the 8th! I was happy and the artwork is really great as you say. Very nice of you to offer to trade.  I also noticed that each pack comes with those pokescrap codes but on the back of that card is some art based on the omega ruby/alpha sapphire games, either with pokemon or trainers or just the Hoenn region. I actually think these are cool enough to keep around and put in my binder. I didn't know these cards would comes with the packs."

pkmntcgcollections,3alp1w,Jsmurff,2,Sun Jun 21 16:15:39 2015 UTC,I think I've heard of one that only had 1 in it but this seems to be an anomaly it should normally be two
pkmntcgcollections,3alp1w,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"That's similar to the English blister packs - I've seen lots of people get both EXs in a single blister, or if they've bought two they got both (or two of the same at least).  I bought two blister packs and didn't get Kyogre EX though, or two holos, so I'll have to buy them as singles 'cause I don't want doubles of the pins or coins."

pkmntcgcollections,3ajzng,Asclepius24,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:09:04 2015 UTC,"As many people on these forums know (and are possibly tired of hearing about), I’m working on a collection of Growlithe and Arcanine cards. I got back into the competitive side of the game almost two years ago and quickly realized that I missed collecting. I decided that a fun thing to do would be to put together a set of one of my favorite Pokemon, and I’ve been working on it since!  The first image is of three 1st Edition Japanese Arcanines that just arrived in the mail today from Japan. I already had the Unlimited print of the first one from Hail Blizzard (Next Destinies), but the Arcanines from the HeartGold Collection (HeartGold & SoulSilver) and Bonds to the End of Time (Rising Rivals) are brand new to me. I love the foil patterns on Japanese cards, and think it’s a neat set to get together since you get to see three different border templates as well.  The second picture is of a few I’ve had for a little while now that I felt like showing off. The first is a brilliant paint-over of Arcanine from Secret Wonders by AstralTigerArt on Etsy. My favorite additions are the lines from the wind that give the card depth and a sense of motion. The other two are from the Squirtle deck that came as part of a VHS starter pack and they have probably my favorite art of all the cards in my collection so far.  I’m still looking for a bunch or Growlithes and Arcanines, especially Japanese cards. I’ve made a spreadsheet here with a key on the third sheet. If you think you might have something you’re willing to part with, I’d love to talk about making a deal!  This has been a great way to get back into collecting for me, and I’d highly recommend working on a set like this if it’s ever crossed your mind :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3ajzng,ortizr93,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:11:36 2015 UTC,"The paint over cards you have look incredible, how do they feel - is the paint a thick layer or is it nice and smooth?"
pkmntcgcollections,3ajzng,Crimzonlogic,2,Sat Jun 20 23:43:18 2015 UTC,"That's a great question, and one I definitely had before I commissioned the first one. I was surprised and extremely pleased to find that the paint layer is thin and smooth with a matte finish over the entire card. The paint blends seamlessly with the artwork on the card and it looks like it was all done at once.  I tried to capture this as well as I could with a couple pictures: one and two. To give you an idea of their thickness, they both currently live together back-to-back in a KMC Perfect Fit sleeve and a toploader. It's snug but not a squeeze or anything.  I really can't rave enough about Kerri's work and would encourage anyone who's interested to send her a message on her Etsy page. She was super helpful in picking out cards and walking me through the commissioning process, and the price includes shipping and the card if she has it."

pkmntcgcollections,3ajzng,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"All I know is right here: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Intro_Pack_(TCG)  The whole set occasionally shows up on eBay, but the singles are around pretty frequently. There are a lot of cards with unique art in the set so take a look if you like those :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3ajzng,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"So what should I search if I just want the growlithe and arcanine? ""Squirtle deck arcanine"" gave no results. :( How did you find them? Are they expensive? I'm collecting every growlithe and arcanine and was not aware that these two existed."
pkmntcgcollections,3ajzng,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"Hm, it actually looks like the Arcanine isn't on eBay at the moment. That Growlithe is, and there's another Growlithe from the Squirtle deck that looks like the Base Set Growlithe with the Squirtle set stamp and the number in the corner.  The regular Base Set-looking Growlithe goes for maybe a couple bucks, but the other two can be pricier since they're gorgeous cards. The Growlithe up there now for $15 is a little high; I'd look for that around 5-6 and the Arcanine at maybe 8-10, although there's always a chance of doing better!  There are also similar cards from the Pokemon Web series, a Japan-exclusive set, that have the same artwork on an e-Reader template. Here are my copies of those so far :)"

pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,DictatorMad,3,Sun Jun 21 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"Lol, I know that now, I was just curious as to what was in it. :P"
pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,DictatorMad,2,Sun Jun 21 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"No problem, I wish you luck on your next pull. But if your looking for rare cards, stay away from Theme Decks. The only thing you need from a theme deck is energy cards, which you can buy pretty cheaply from a card shop or online for a dollar. The rest in the theme deck is consider junk cards. I hope I didn't come off as rude, but everyone try to get an rare EX, and the best way to get them is just buying the booster pack."
pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,primase,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'm aiming to collect one of every English print of every card. Boundaries Crossed, from my understanding, is getting rare outside of eBay/other online retailers, so that's why I got the theme deck."
pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,mitchell77,2,Mon Jun 22 23:30:15 2015 UTC,Nice pulls. Just remember next time to not buy the 20 card repackaged thing.  Tins are good sometimes. Hopefully next time you get some secret rares to makeup for the 20 card thing.
pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,Credits_PTCGO,2,Sun Jun 21 06:50:11 2015 UTC,"Hate to break it to ya but that Meloetta isn't considered a ""full art"" (in my book at least) it actually comes from the Radiant collection from legendary treasures. It's also super common for a rare."
pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,DictatorMad,0,Sun Jun 21 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Wrong! Fullart implies ""art"" that covers the ""full"" surface of the card. Unless i need my eyes checked again, it loks ""full""""art"" to me......."
pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,mitchell77,2,Sun Jun 21 11:20:42 2015 UTC,"It's just not a rare card is all. but the guy is new to this so is best he learn before hand. I was told the same way when I first started collecting, and my first pack was a legendary treasures"
pkmntcgcollections,3ajw2d,Credits_PTCGO,0,Mon Jun 22 04:43:44 2015 UTC,"Also someone needs to check their spelling and when you can't capitalize an I and can't spell the word looks. And when I said I don't consider it a ""Full Art"" is with the full arts in Legendary Treasures set, Full arts had a texture to them, which Meloetta doesn't have. But again I said ""IN MY BOOK"" I never said others didn't consider that. Plus that card was so darn common."

pkmntcgcollections,3aiskx,MMauzer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"At the moment, no. As I said, I started building this for my own personal use and I am only collecting XY at the moment. However, I like messing around with little computer projects like this. Give me some time for research ( I am very unfamiliar with the early sets) and I can probably put one together for you just like this one. Might not get it done until the weekend with the work week starting back up. But, if you'd like, I'll make one for you."
pkmntcgcollections,3aiskx,MMauzer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:23:10 2015 UTC,"That would be nice, although it shouldn't be to hard to remake your file into a file for base/jungle/fossil/rocket. I guess I could make it myself, we'll see what happens."

pkmntcgcollections,3aflz5,FourMakesTwoUNLESS,0,Fri Jun 19 21:14:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks :D Yeah, for a lot of them they're produced by outside companies like Meiji, Carddass, Bandai, and a lot of other companies that don't have information on them. If you're ever looking for rare pokemon items, I'd look into Yahoo Japan Auctions, you'll have to use a middleman service like Buyee but there's a lot of things that you won't be able to find much info on."

pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,wordskis,2,Sat Jun 20 15:18:06 2015 UTC,Why do I have a strong feeling that these packs were weighted. I had a few lucky packs before but to get an Ultra Rare in each one is too farfetched.
pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,DictatorMad,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Well, every other one, he bought 16, pulled 8 URs. I had the same thought though but this is the Internet and no one can prove either way"
pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,ortizr93,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:12:04 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, so I posted a few days back about the best way to get back into the game and got a ton of awesome replies and ended up buying the theme deck that everyone suggested for the trainers (Y vs X) but also wanted to buy a few other things so I could open some packs.  I bought a roaring skies elite trainer box, a Venasaur tin, and 4 loose flashfire packs.  I was amazed with all the pulls and understand this won't be the norm, but wow I was amazed when I opened the 4 flashfires and saw two mega charizard ex's.  Anyway can anyone with more experience tell me the difference between the two mega raqauaza ex cards? Are they from different series or something?"
pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,Asclepius24,2,Sat Jun 20 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"They're both from Roaring Skies, which you can tell by the set symbol in the lower right corner. Roaring Skies contains three different M-Rayquaza cards - a Dragon-type (which you have), a full-art Colorless M-Rayquaza (which you also have), and a regular Colorless M-Rayquaza."

pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,Asclepius24,2,Sat Jun 20 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"the two Rayquazas are from the same set.  You can tell because they have the same denominator number on the bottom right as welll as the same set symbol (bottom right also).  The Rayquaza on the right is called a ""Full Art"".

pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,primase,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:16:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply! I totally forgot about full arts, I guess I was still in shock after seeing another ex and didn't even realize.  Another question if you don't mind...It's been a while since I've played the game, since the base set pretty much, and was wondering are any of the ex's I pulled worth building a deck around? I read that nightmarch, toad, raichu, were strong in tourneys atm, but say for just a league around my house, do any of those expensive cards see competitive play or are they valuable because the collection factor?   (Disregard the shaymin ex, already know that's a staple, but the others am curious)  Ty again!"
pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,primase,2,Sat Jun 20 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"As far as the TCG, I honestly know nothing about it.  I purely collect and do not play the TCG.  Therefore, I couldn't give you an accurate description of what to build a deck around.  Sorry!"
pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,Asclepius24,2,Sat Jun 20 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"Both of those Rayquazas have pretty solid decks built around them, and both utilize Shaymin EX as well. They're both pretty pricey decks, though. Latios is used in a kind of gimmicky deck that would be cheaper but not nearly as competitive.  Mega Charizard is mostly a collector's card. Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Heracross both used to see some limited play but neither is popular at the moment since better Mega Pokemon have been released."
pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,primase,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:48:42 2015 UTC,Awesome exactly what I was looking for. Do you use both the Rayquazas in the same deck or? I'll definitely do some research and maybe buy singles to fill the gaps of what else I need.
pkmntcgcollections,3agvuj,Jsmurff,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"They'd be two separate decks:  http://forums.sixprizes.com/t/m-rayquaza-ex-colorless-variants-bcr-on/5360  http://forums.sixprizes.com/t/m-rayquaza-ex-dragon-bcr-on/5362/  Colorless is much more popular, Dragon is a lot of fun as well."

pkmntcgcollections,3aaeua,xmoda,4,Thu Jun 18 19:55:28 2015 UTC,Yea it's crazy. Got them from an Italien guy who normally only have Magic cards for sale but he got these but didn't know the value so he sold it to a very nice price. Two of the boxes were opened already so have opened 24 packs until now and got 2 gold star cards. Feeling pretty lucky.

pkmntcgcollections,3ac9x9,DemoORAS,5,Thu Jun 18 22:54:45 2015 UTC,Probably don't write your name on the card. Unless you want to keep it forever and never sell/trade it and you think it would look cooler with your name on it.
pkmntcgcollections,3ac9x9,errantdog,3,Thu Jun 18 22:58:01 2015 UTC,"I just collect, I rarely resell."
pkmntcgcollections,3ac9x9,errantdog,3,Thu Jun 18 23:02:05 2015 UTC,I guess it comes down to whether or not you think the card would be improved with your name on it.
pkmntcgcollections,3ac9x9,wordskis,5,Thu Jun 18 23:05:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do that. If you write on the card it will not only reduce the value, it will basically make it worthless. You should put it in a sleeve (maybe one of the snug-fit Ultra Pro sleeves) and write on the sleeve, so it looks good combined with the card, but doesn't mess up the card."
pkmntcgcollections,3ac9x9,Crimzonlogic,2,Fri Jun 19 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"OR, you could write your name on the outside of a sleeve where the name blank on the card is. Then you got your name on it but haven't altered the card. :)"
pkmntcgcollections,3ac9x9,Jsmurff,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:32:36 2015 UTC,Well it's like this to scribble scratch or in any way alter a card that is considered collectible is just plain sacrilege however… the less there is in mint condition the higher the value.   Just because you do not resell does not mean that they are not re-sellable  until you write on them then it's pretty worthless unless you created Pokemon day 1 then I imagine that card would be worth all the Swiss gold that physically exists
pkmntcgcollections,3ac9x9,ortizr93,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:24:56 2015 UTC,"Costs about $25 for one in decent condition (the second birthday edition).  As long as you mean that ^ type of HB Pikachu and not a beautiful Natta Wake one, go for it"

pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,Merkath,5,Sun Jun 14 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"I can only answer from the collecting side as I don't play the game anymore, but I used to keep my collection cards mint and I'd buy played cards for decks. Similarly, I wouldn't pay extra for full art cards if they're just going into a deck, just get regular cards (especially the case with trainers)"
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,ortizr93,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:14:32 2015 UTC,"Seeing how badly my old cards ended up, I'd definitely like to keep my cards in mint condition. Quick question, how many different versions there are of the same card? I've seen full art, holos, reverse holos, half arts(?) and so on. Some of them even have different attributes and it all seems so confusing."
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,ortizr93,3,Sun Jun 14 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"I'll use Roaring Skies as an example:  The set contains 110 cards, numbered 1-108 with two secret rares, 109/108 and 110/108.  Within the set there are regular EX cards as well as full art EX cards, however the full arts have a different set number despite being the same card just with different artwork, e.g. Thundurus EX is 26/108 but FA Thundurus EX is 98/108.  All holo, rare, uncommon and common cards also have a reverse holo version.  The half art cards are different to normal cards - e.g. the half art Unfezant 81/108 has different attacks and HP to the other Unfezant card 80/108 in the set. Both have a reverse holo version too."

I have the first three sets complete, and am just 2 cards shy of having a complete Team Rocket set also.  Mine are mint though, I still have them in the little Pokémon binder book things we bought.  The information in this thread has been helpful because things have changed a bit nowadays!  All this reverse holo, ex and full art ex stuff can be confusing :D"
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,ChicaSkas,2,Wed Jun 17 08:49:35 2015 UTC,"I regret not protecting my cards properly, but then what does an 8 year old know about keeping cards ""mint"". Lots of good info here, people in this subreddit are very helpful and friendly!"
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,ChicaSkas,2,Wed Jun 17 11:24:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, nothing :D  I was collecting supposedly for my son, though really for me!  And the cards were banned at his school anyway, apparently they caused much trauma :D  Not that I would have let him take a shiney, as we called them!   But I couldn't bear to part with what we have because of the memories, and now he's grown up and doesn't care, but I still do.  And it's not about the monetary value, it's that gotta catch 'em all thing!  I'm so tempted to start buying them again, I've been watching lots of unboxing videos on Youtube and there are some fantastic cards out there."

pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,Tambushi,3,Mon Jun 15 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, tl,dr answer:  You found the right place. We love to help on Pokemon Reddit!  Garage sales, classified ads and flea markets are great places to find cheap cards.  If you are only PLAYING the game, fakes can be used, if you cover the backs with card protectors so one card cannot be differentiated from the others. To teach schoolchildren , I sometimes use fake holos (same text on cards) so that my REAL holos wont get stolen or scratched.  I do wonder trades every week on Reddit, see my started threads, you can get rid of your duplicate or unwanted cards that way and get an equal rarity matched batch returned to you by me.  good luck! Im almost 30 and this game never gets old! -- Katharine"
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,Tambushi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:16:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! I might trade my doubles to you after I decide what to buy.

pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,Tambushi,2,Mon Jun 15 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"I build my deck around, not using Ultra Rare cards, it's not worth damaging a $20-$40 card."
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,ChicaSkas,2,Mon Jun 15 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"I've been getting back into it for about a month now, and I am fully hooked. I have bought tins, promo boxes, blister packs, and booster boxes already. Collecting is a lot of fun these days, with all of the beautiful EX's and Full Art cards.   Right now I have three solid decks and one decent one I use to play with friends, and a bunch of decks on the online game.   That's another thing, you can now play online! Each booster comes with a code card to get a booster online and you play from there. Games, tournaments, collecting, trading .. all online and lots of fun."
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,Jsmurff,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"I've been playing tcgo to quench my thirst while waiting for my next paycheck, it is indeed very addicting. Seems like a lot of fun that you get online codes from actual decks and boosters. What sets have you bought cards from, did you buy any theme decks or did you build your decks from scratch? Would you recommend buying tins, promo boxes and the like? They're all new to me."
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,Jsmurff,2,Wed Jun 17 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"This is going to be pretty long, but here goes.    It's all about what you really want to do. Do you want to collect sets? Build decks for playing? Build online decks? Do you want to sell them?     I've bought few theme decks, but mainly for energy, trainers, and evolutions. You can expand on them once you start getting the boosters. Mine are built up pretty nicely right now for how I play. Tins are cool because you get the tin (obviously), the Promo EX card, and 4 booster packs, all for the price of the boosters. I only grab those if I like the Promo for one of my decks, then I use the tin for deck box/coin/dice storage. Plus, the newer ones come with a code for a 60 card online deck! Promo boxes are awesome! Some come with a figure, some with EX/Mega EX cards, pins, coins and all sorts of goodies. Again, these are all about what you're after. I love figures and various goodies and I use the cards in my decks. So I grab those based on who I need/like.    Opening boosters is fun and super addicting, but it can build you up a lot of bulk in a very short time. I have a crazy amount of cards I will never use. The only set I'm interested in collecting would be the 1st Edition Gen 1's. However, I do have a great stack of rares that I am going to sell off shortly so I can recoup some money. I've opened a B&W Legendary Trasures booster box. As well as boosters from: XY Base, Furious Fists, Flashfire, Roaring Skies, Phantom Forces, Plasma Storm, Plasma Freeze, Primal Clash, and Double Crisis. As well as 6 tins, and 2 or 3 promo boxes.  If you have the time, and money for that, it's a very fun way to enjoy Pokemon again.  Piecing a deck together on a retailer website is another viable option. It may look expensive at first, but it's most likely going to be cheaper than trying to build exactly what you want from boosters. Definitely not as fun though, not even close!"
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,ortizr93,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:59:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed answer! At first I basically decided to ignore tins and promo boxes since I can get boosters cheaper from other packages. However the promo cards are only available from them or buying them single? I might look into them, I haven't built any decks (and honestly I'm a bit lost on how to build a good deck), so I don't yet know which cards I'd need. I'm definitely going to build my decks mostly from what cards I find, it seems way more fun."
pkmntcgcollections,39ugje,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:57:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah the promos are only in boxes or tins.  I look at them like this: You get 4 boosters (~$20), promo EX(~$5), tin ($5-$10), and online code for a booster or a full deck in the new tins. ($5-10) That's around $40 worth of stuff, for $19.99. So you either get 4 individual boosters, or all that stuff...for the same price.     Good luck on your search and welcome back to the game!"
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,joesaysso,3,Sun Jun 14 08:52:09 2015 UTC,Buy someone's bulk?
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,primase,3,Sun Jun 14 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of a few days late, but I feel like that is ineffecient in the way of attaining cards, perhaps if you're even hoping to attain good cards. I think what people do in the ""bulk lots"" is the following:   Buy the boosters, structure decks, and tins. Strip out any cards above a certain price point (the point that makes the most profit), put in pile A Take remaining cards under the certain price point, put in pile B Sell cards from pile A individually, making the maximum profit Sell cards from pile B in bulk lots, making the maximum profit   A friend of mine bought a bulk lot when he got back into YuGiOh for a bit. When I looked at the cards he got, nothing was above a dollar or two. Which means, if you're hoping to hit it big and try to get some cards, your odds are slim to none, because these people are selling the more valuable cards individually.  Sometimes they will claim a ""guaranteed rare!"" in with the bundle. That doesn't really mean anything, as there are always some rares in booster boxes that aren't worth more than a few bucks, too low of a price to turn an actual profit off of it, which is the exact reason why they sell the bundles. Individually, the chump change cards won't fetch much of a price, and the only profitable option is to do a bundle deal to unload as many of them as possible to make as much profit as possible."
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,C7H5BiO4,2,Wed Jun 17 21:55:28 2015 UTC,I was thinking op meant for regular cards they needed not the ultra or secret rare cards.
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,primase,2,Wed Jun 17 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"Regular cards it may be fine, but if hoping to hit it big with a pricey card, I wouldn't look forward to it."
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,C7H5BiO4,3,Thu Jun 18 13:19:55 2015 UTC,Definitely. I can't stand those eBay sellers that do that.
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,primase,2,Thu Jun 18 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"I'll buy a booster box or two and then sell the ptcgo cards and the bulk commons/uncommons to recuperate some of the cost. If the expansion has lots of high value cards, then i'll buy two booster boxes, whereas if it doesn't then i'll usually buy 1. Like for flashfire, I purchased 2 boxes. In my most recent one I pulled 2 mega charizards, a regular charizard, and a few more ultrarares. Coupling that to the fact that I can sell the bulk and PTCGO cards, I came out paying less than I would have if I had bought singles. This of course entirely depends on luck and if the set has $30+ cards or not. The rest I'll just purchase singles from ebay/amazon/troll and toad."
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,aznscourge,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:06:29 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if you keep at a certain rate in buying packs, eventually in a couple months you will be over your head in cards. I wouldn't buy lots on ebay because those are the kind of cards most collectors don't want, anyway. You could, if you're looking to get whole sets, try and get good deals by getting singles on ebay, but I'd say your ""cheapest"" option would probably be to buy a booster box and then buy the singles of whatever is left. Alternatively, if you don't have $100 bucks just lying around at any one point in time, you could just keep up buying blisters. Eventually, if you buy enough, you get to have a collection of too many cards, believe me."
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,ashizzzle,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"ebay is the best option if you're buying full sets. I've gotten a full set of XY for $100 and flashfire for $160. I think that's way cheaper than if someone were to try to pull them from packs. If you're just looking for a handful of singles, then a mixture of eBay and card sites are the way to go. I, personally, use CoolStuffInc for singles."
pkmntcgcollections,39sg1n,Audacidy,0,Sun Jun 14 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"get a booster box which should give you 80% of the set and buy the rest as singles. Alternatively you can buy bulk lots off ebay but they could contain any number of cards from any set leaving you with a load of incomplete sets.  theres no ""cheap"" way as such to do this hobby unfortunately. unless you have interest in the promos and tins for collection purposes i wouldnt go down that route either.  Edit: most c/uc RH's go for <$1 its reverse rares that go for $1+"

If not, it's an off centered card, which to my opinion lowers the card value. True miscut cards like your Pyroar, have that alignment dot, which is actually rare even for an error. It's common to get these two confused, but the one with the dots can fetch a pretty penny from collectors. I think you're lucky!"

pkmntcgcollections,39qcvg,wantonviolins,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:26:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! Yeah I'm missing like 16 ultra rares so the booster box is probably gonna be my best bet.
pkmntcgcollections,39qcvg,aqlno,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"A booster box is gonna cost you ~$100 from which you'll get, at random, ~4-7 Ultra rates.   With $100 you could get almost 10 UR singles from eBay depending on what you're looking for.   Singles will always be the cheapest way to complete a collection.   Start with a box to get all the commons, in commons, most rares, and some Ultra Rares.   Then finish it up with singles."
pkmntcgcollections,39qcvg,Eiriklago,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:14:09 2015 UTC,Yeah this sounds like the best way. Gonna start this method with Ancient Origins.

pkmntcgcollections,39qcvg,Eiriklago,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"Is that $180 USD in Norway?   If not then it might just be an exchange rate thing.   Other factors for the price disparity could be that English cards are produced in America; so no importing/customs fees to raise prices, generally the price of goods in the U.S. is cheaper than in European countries; due to taxes, laws, etc, or that there's just greater demand for Pokemon product in the U.S.; which drives the price down."
pkmntcgcollections,39qcvg,rawrenross,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yea you're right ofc demand = lower price when you have competing suppliers, was looking at buying from ebay but shipping and taxes made it more expensive than just buying it from here.

pkmntcgcollections,39p0d1,Panda_Kabob,4,Sat Jun 13 10:44:11 2015 UTC,"It's worth around $25 in near mint condition.  This guide shows all the version differences, but the prices in it are inaccurate."
pkmntcgcollections,39p0d1,FourMakesTwoUNLESS,3,Sat Jun 13 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"Like FourMakesTwoUNLESS said, NM its worth about $25, mint is about $30. So compared to the English movie version, yes it is worth quite a bit more. :)"
pkmntcgcollections,39p0d1,tenaciousm17,2,Sun Jun 14 02:33:14 2015 UTC,The corrected version is actually rarer.
pkmntcgcollections,39p0d1,Maox_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:28:15 2015 UTC,"Well that depends. There was (edit) 4 different versions released. The one everyone has, the error, and the Japanese corrected one, and the Ancient Mew v.2 japanese."
pkmntcgcollections,39p0d1,tenaciousm17,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:27:21 2015 UTC,So which one is the rarest of them all?
pkmntcgcollections,39p0d1,v0r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:51:38 2015 UTC,The Japanese corrected one. That is worth up to $120 if it is gem mint condition.

pkmntcgcollections,39kaog,The_Variable_Phi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:13:39 2015 UTC,"I've never used PokeOrder but I've gotten a lot of older stuff from Collector's Cache. Their really old stuff can get pretty expensive but they're very reasonably priced on most sets from Platinum on. I've purchased the majority of my booster boxes there and they're all sealed, unless the listing says ""36 LOOSE PACKS"" in big letters."
pkmntcgcollections,39kaog,Ekyou,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:36:32 2015 UTC,Yeah they are my local. It's just like you say pricey. Pity PokeOrder has bad reviews they have pretty nice sales here and there.
pkmntcgcollections,39kaog,buckanater160,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:06:30 2015 UTC,Wow that's a great website I did Not know existed even! Thanks for posting the link!
pkmntcgcollections,39kaog,aznscourge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:52:20 2015 UTC,I usually just use amazon since they aggregate a bunch of different sellers together under each listing and you can individually go look for stores that you trust or ones with high feedback.
pkmntcgcollections,39kaog,wordskis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:32:01 2015 UTC,I tend to use amazon and eBay but they don't have the boxes I want. :/

pkmntcgcollections,39j8s3,ChicaSkas,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:06:04 2015 UTC,There's gotta be at least one person selling them as singles somewhere
pkmntcgcollections,39j8s3,Jsmurff,2,Fri Jun 12 09:17:20 2015 UTC,There are holo and non-holo versions of the starters in each kalos starter deck. I'm not sure how else to get them.

pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,FlutterMadness,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:16:26 2015 UTC,Very nice but why the sideway pages? Did your friend pull these from packs or is buying singles?
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:06:57 2015 UTC,"He got them from packs is what he told me, he has been looking into buying singles though."
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:56:06 2015 UTC,I would suggest it's better to get packs if he's looking for modern rare's but for older stuff like base set for example he's better off buying singles as pack and box's hold more value as sealed product imho
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Audacidy,2,Thu Jun 11 09:24:09 2015 UTC,Buying singles is still better than packs for modern sets.
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:35:36 2015 UTC,Well I am not saying that their not but there's not a lot of choice for me where I am and for the price of a few rare singles I could get a bunch of sealed product
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,buckanater160,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:15:55 2015 UTC,I agree plenty of cheap full arts are out there between 5-8$ and so it kind of kills the luster of buying packs. The last two sets have been extremely underwhelming IMO
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Jsmurff,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:33:29 2015 UTC,"He does invest in packs, but also looks online for loose cards and price checks."
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:33:39 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what i do going to take a break from sealed for a while and going to see if I can't get a few cheap ur and FA
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Jsmurff,2,Thu Jun 11 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a plan, I wanted to collect cards and stuff myself but it's not for me. I have my other obsessions.  (However I do need my Espurr merch)"
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,Asclepius24,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:56:47 2015 UTC,Yeah once you get into collecting it's a tough (and expensive) itch to scratch. Other murch is a solid investment.
pkmntcgcollections,39exu9,buckanater160,2,Thu Jun 11 18:56:35 2015 UTC,I'll just get stuff related to my fav pokemon and I'm good hahaha.
pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,koepfer2,4,Thu Jun 11 16:59:17 2015 UTC,Pics? They're probably fake. It's funny that the restaurant is Chinese because that's the country the fakes often come from.
pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,FourMakesTwoUNLESS,2,Thu Jun 11 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"Nice find! I would be careful though as they might be fake. I am always careful when they are priced well under the RRP, here in the UK it's around £2.99"
pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,ThisisJaws,2,Thu Jun 11 17:11:09 2015 UTC,€5.99 here in Ireland… €3.50 ordered from the UK despite the shift exchange rates  Edit: if you look on alibaba.com there's allot of very convincing fakes available for dirt cheap
pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,Jsmurff,2,Thu Jun 11 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"Wow that is expensive, maybe try ordering some of eBay! Personally I would never recommend buying fakes for any reason"
pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,ThisisJaws,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:54:39 2015 UTC,I meant to say that you were right their dirt cheap and readily available (alibaba.com is a middle man for Chinese manufacturers) I would never suggest that anyone buy them unless you like burning them then by all means go right ahead!  Yeah my country slaps 23% vat on everything aswell as 2.3% stamp duty on anything not produced in Ireland and then there's the retailer markup on top of all that so it does get quite silly.  eBay can be cheap however postage is a killer I find chaos cards and magicmadhouse to be the best of both reasonable price and shipping
pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:14:51 2015 UTC,I figured for a dollar it's worth the risk
pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,ThisisJaws,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:12:15 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely! Good luck with the pulls!

pkmntcgcollections,39gtxs,kingdomheroes,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:14:54 2015 UTC,in my experience with fake packs you get a lot of awesome looking rare cards. almost all holo. and each pack has about the same cards inside.

pkmntcgcollections,39f8gn,wordskis,2,Thu Jun 11 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome choice with the PSA trio! How much did those 3 run you, if you don't mind me asking?   And you also got 2 of my favorite theme decks, Rock Garden and Blackout. Blackout is probably tied with Zap! as my favorite first-gen theme deck artwork. I have empty boxes of both (Zap and Blackout, not Rock Garden), but my only sealed one so far is Grass Chopper."
pkmntcgcollections,39f8gn,wordskis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:06:04 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer to keep the price quiet incase I need to sell them on, plus as soon as anyone of my friends from home on Reddit see how much I spend on cards I think they might hold an intervention. If you really want to know, PM me. :)  Yeah the art on the base series boxes is incredible. That said, the Neo series boxes I have are easily the best looking in my opinion. Sounds like you are on your way to start collecting theme boxes too!"

pkmntcgcollections,39c6js,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:17:40 2015 UTC,I know! It also has a tiny crease and a little bit of a messed up edge. So I tossed it in a sleeve and a hard case to try and get rid of the bowing.
pkmntcgcollections,39c6js,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:06:02 2015 UTC,Yup top loaders are the only thing I know of that will help with that also I like the fact that you used full size deck sleeves it helps fill out the top loader and centre the card I hate seeing cards in penny sleeves inside top loaders as they are never centred and have a massive gap around them.
pkmntcgcollections,39aicr,The_Variable_Phi,6,Wed Jun 10 12:47:41 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind not having pictures for every card, I've been maintaining an Excel Workbook that another user created but abandoned on the PokeBeach forums. I try to update it with every major release and sometimes in between that when someone points out an error to me or missing sets.  If you're interested, I have a dropbox download link for it here. Let me know what you think and if there are any errors/changes you find/would like.  Edit: Just added the newest XY promos a little while ago. Same download link!"

pkmntcgcollections,39aicr,SereneFrost72,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:21:53 2015 UTC,So cool!!!! Where did you get those checklists? And did they update them for more?
pkmntcgcollections,39aicr,Jsmurff,2,Thu Jun 11 11:41:53 2015 UTC,"There are a variety of checklists out there (I'm sure someone will post links, I'm not sure where they are located). It all depends on what you're looking for. Do you want a no-frills, do-it-yourself checklist where it simply lists all of the cards/sets/etc.? Or do you want something that will calculate all sorts of collection statistics for you?  Personally, I created an Access 2010 database that contains all cards with card names, types, card type, set, number, etc. It also has 99% of all card images within it, allowing you to look at the cards at anytime."
pkmntcgcollections,39aicr,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah just a DIY checklist. Reason I asked is cause I was collecting reverse holos of all nonholo rares, commons, uncommons, trainers, and energy. And any card that has a regular holo. However I noticed that I had tons if regular cards also and thought how close to master sets am I  But each set kind of is different in terms of having a reverse holo or not (radiant collection)"
pkmntcgcollections,39aicr,ShadowMoses05,2,Wed Jun 10 14:04:48 2015 UTC,I always found bulbapidia to be very handy although some of the listings are incomplete but it's a good start pokelector is also a good place to look it shows you an image gallery of every set however it is also incomplete as they are still trying to scan all the cards  I personally went old school and picked up an accounting ledger and divide each page into 9 columns Number/Type/Name/Rarity/Condition/NonHolo/ReverseHolo/Holo/FullArt  After entering the type name and condition I put a tick in each column for each version of the card so I can keep track of all the different versions for each card.  I will right the numbers in beforehand to save time down the line and left space for secret rare's. Eg I have 1-108 of XY FF but left a few blank lines for any secret rare's I come across.

pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,primase,3,Tue Jun 9 11:02:38 2015 UTC,Nice collection. I'm send a few in for grading via patriots_fan. Hopefully get a 10 and sell that to get the rest graded.
pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,zki0,-1,Tue Jun 9 07:02:08 2015 UTC,"patriots_fan? Is that Reddit user, Youtube? Plus I'm watching Silversnorlax204. Seems as though he runs a good PSA third party business, that runs for about $11 a card."
pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,zki0,3,Tue Jun 9 07:16:29 2015 UTC,Yes he is a redditor. He charges 8.50 I believe.  Free shipping back to you. I'll ask silver if his services offer anything else.
pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,zki0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure how patriots_fan operates his service,  but Silversnorlax204 is rather slow. He's very friendly and helpful but he's usually late with replying to PMs and with returning cards as well. There are definitely other graders out there that might be better alternatives. Just my two cents."
pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,zki0,2,Wed Jun 10 02:30:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If I wanted to pay, I'd want to get the best option for my dollar. Whom would you suggest?"
pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,DictatorMad,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:59:05 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I haven't personally gone through Patriots_Fan here on Reddit but I've seen a few of the other members here frequently mention him, so he might be good. pottsinator on eBay and /u/HisokaX might be worth a look too."
pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,buckanater160,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:21:50 2015 UTC,Do those two provide PSA Grading services?
pkmntcgcollections,394ox8,buckanater160,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:04:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the really late reply. Haven't been on much recently. Yes, I know Pottsinator grades for others, and Hisoka probably would too."
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,Goodbloke66,5,Tue Jun 9 05:44:17 2015 UTC,Oh my lord where on earth (or on Internet) did you find those!?! I would open a few... maybe!!!
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,ChicaSkas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:15:49 2015 UTC,Some guy in the local classifieds found them in his garage. I'm really tempted to open the ex deoxys ones in hope of that awesome rayquaza:)
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,Jsmurff,0,Tue Jun 9 06:30:36 2015 UTC,Well I would open one of each and then flip the others for profit
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,Jsmurff,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:08:41 2015 UTC,"Yeh that sounds like a plan, any idea what these sets go for?"
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,wordskis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:20:58 2015 UTC,have a look on ebay they sell anywhere between 10-35 depending on edition and set.
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,ShadowMoses05,4,Tue Jun 9 10:55:20 2015 UTC,"I'd personally keep one of each artwork sealed, just to have."
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,ShadowMoses05,3,Tue Jun 9 07:49:07 2015 UTC,"This is one of those times I would tell someone to use a scale without feeling bad. Just weigh them to see what's heaviest and open those, then leave the others sealed in your collection"
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,wordskis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:22:23 2015 UTC,Are you able to weigh the old packs? Sorry if its a dumb question just thought that the only reason the new packs can be weighed was because the ultra rares are printed differently.
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,ShadowMoses05,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"yes you can weigh them to see which have a foil rare as opposed to a junk non foil one. One thing most people don't know, I didn't either until someone on facebook mentioned it, is that ultra rares and holo rares have the same weights. They use the same foiling process for both kinds of cards."
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,SereneFrost72,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:37:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info man! I'll post pulls if I can find a decent scale:)
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,robzirra,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"I assume that's only for ex series cards and earlier, right?"
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,Jsmurff,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about the specifics, I just know that it's a bad idea to buy loose packs outside of retail stores because it's easy to weigh for good ones. My point to the OP was if they want to open some and keep others sealed for a collection it's probably a good idea to open guaranteed good packs."
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,robzirra,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, finally someone who realizes this! Did you also know that full arts do not weigh any more than ultra rares and holo rares? I have 300+ data points on individual cards and packs on this stuff due to a grad school statistics project. I weighed my own booster boxes just for this project."
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,xmoda,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:46:28 2015 UTC,Is that an Australian  thing to have that half circle cut from the top like that?
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,wordskis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:03:11 2015 UTC,I think it's actually a tab from the cardboard backing or at least that's how it appears to me. Odd blister haven't seen one like it before.
pkmntcgcollections,394m8l,DictatorMad,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:06:25 2015 UTC,"Yep like jsmurff said, its a bit of cardboard, I think you could redeem 10(?) of them for a free pack or something back then."

pkmntcgcollections,3950uz,Aestysu,3,Tue Jun 9 08:32:49 2015 UTC,"depends what your motives are. Grading the card would instantly increase its value, and i prefer the look of non graded cards personally.  hard to tell what it would grade from a picture."
pkmntcgcollections,3950uz,acebren,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:12:19 2015 UTC,I have been told that a little bend does not affect the grade. I can see what appears to be a small nick on the back mid left side.
pkmntcgcollections,3950uz,OzEnigma2,0,Tue Jun 9 14:22:03 2015 UTC,For some it does and others it doesn't
pkmntcgcollections,3950uz,Jsmurff,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:14:03 2015 UTC,Go for it
pkmntcgcollections,3950uz,primase,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:33:52 2015 UTC,That's shadowless for sure you need to
pkmntcgcollections,3950uz,buckanater160,0,Thu Jun 11 14:49:15 2015 UTC,From what I understand bowing does affect the grading. It's a personal choice at the end of the day and getting it graded will increase its value down the line.
pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,rawrenross,3,Mon Jun 8 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"Nice! Take it you'll definitely be excited for these, I certainly am:  http://www.pokebeach.com/2015/06/magikarp-gyarados-make-believe-pikachu-box"

I think I'll put the English and Japanese versions of the same card together, but I've considered something like this as well. It looks great!  I'll have to take a picture of something for you next weekend when I'm at League. It's not obtainable, but I think you'd enjoy it :)"
pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,ChicaSkas,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:21:43 2015 UTC,"ooooh sounds exciting whatever it is you wanna take a picture of for me :) Can't wait to see it!  And thanks, I put a lot of time and effort into doing this, but it is well worth it, because now when I get a card it has a place all ready for it and I do not have to reorganize anything really. Doing the same for my Shiny collection and Prime collection currently :)   You should totally do this for your collection, it will feel great trust me! And everyone would love to see it!"
pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,Jsmurff,2,Mon Jun 8 04:24:11 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone! Finally able to showcase my Pikachu stuff! Got it all nice and neat and somewhat organized by set and language. Only English and Japanese for now, but I do plan on doing other languages. There are one or two mistakes that I made; such as the Snap Pikachu on the second page, it shouldnt be there. Oh well, too lazy to go back and fix it right now, it took a lot of work to do this, especially the Japanese ones, and I still probably missed some! I have some new editions to the card and merch collection in the coming week, including a sculpture by This Wonderful Lady which I am so excited to see how it turns out!   If I am missing any cards, let me know! I tried to research Pikachu cards and this is all I came up with. Any others I don't know about or mistakes I made, let me know :)"

pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,Jsmurff,0,Tue Jun 9 02:50:02 2015 UTC,Nice collection I didn't know there was more then two 1st edition types that's nuts!
pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,paul_123,2,Mon Jun 8 06:58:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, there were a lot of variations made in regards to first edition in the first set. The ""thin"" and ""thick"" stamping of the 1st Edition symbol is not something a lot of people notice, but there are occurrences where the ink was thicker and you could tell if you knew what you were looking for. Here is a link to a discussion between collectors about it, showcasing a picture of a thin vs thick stamping.  Every 1st edition card had this as far as I am aware. But since a lot of people do not know about the variants in stamping, it is not a widely spread collector's goal to get ""thin"" and ""thick"". I just thought I would try for the hell of it :)"
pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,paul_123,-1,Mon Jun 8 08:13:07 2015 UTC,Yeah allot of them must have slipped by if people weren't keeping an eye out for em :/. Ah well what fun is there to be had if you don't set yourself a challenge!

pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,PolarBlue,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:34:38 2015 UTC,Great collection! I figure your the expert on Pikachu's so what would you say a reverse holo pikachu from legendary collection (in near mint condition) is worth?    I recently came across one when going through some of my older cards. Not sure if I would trade it but I'm just curious
pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,thecardpletionist,0,Mon Jun 8 13:43:56 2015 UTC,Thanks! And I would say around 10. I had one that I had bought from coolstuffinc and I only paid 9 but it somehow got lost so now I cannot find it anywhere :( it's the first time I have ever lost a card.  If you ever wanna sell it I will snatch it from ya in a heartbeat :P

pkmntcgcollections,38zm5m,buckanater160,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"Nice to see you back and nice progress on the collection! Just a note for your binder, you have spots for 7 first edition pikachus but there are really only 5.  Yellow cheek thick and thin, red cheek thick and thin, and the ghost pikachu. I think the first edition stamp is either thick or thin so there should only be two of each cheek color for each stamp if that makes sense."
pkmntcgcollections,38u3w7,Palitir,5,Sat Jun 6 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"Isn't it nice though? What a payoff. Imagine if it was just another Lass. Also I just noticed, did Japanese packs originally only come with ten cards?"

pkmntcgcollections,38sfop,rawrenross,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"I got most of mine through coolstuffinc.com or through trades/sales on my Facebook buy/sell/trade group. For the Japanese only ones, I got them from tcgrepublic.com because most of their pricing is really good and they offer free shipping even though they are in Japan.   I would say, best place to start is the Platinum/Arceus shiny set. That one is the least exspensive to complete. After that, there is Call of Legends, Black and White, Gold Star, and Shining. And then the miscellaneous ones like genesect promo (both shiny versions) and then Japanese exclusive ones like corocoro mew.  I just kinda pick them up for cheap or trade for them when the opportunity arises. I have an extra shiny Relicanth if you need one of those (and if you live in the US).   Once I get pictures of it I will link you to what I have so far :)"

I asked about it and they said I could have it for $5. Eleven-year-old me was a happy kid that evening.

Another was a Gengar Spirit Link 2-pack blister that I bought from Gamestop a few weeks ago due to it being on sale for $5, from the 2 booster packs, I pulled a fucking Mega Charizard X EX and a Mega Lucario EX Secret Rare."

It had tons of stuff in it, but I was mostly after the Shining Gyarados and Shining Mewtwo. Super good value, A++, but now I am always hoping to find another binder to buy."
pkmntcgcollections,38ryzg,buckanater160,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:51:36 2015 UTC,One of my best friends gave me and shining charizard and my other friend gave me a shining mewtwo.
pkmntcgcollections,38ryzg,Jsmurff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:38:23 2015 UTC,IMHO the best thing that can happen to a collector is getting pulls that cover your expenses like what happened to me with my power trio ex tins they each produced cards that covered the cost and then some :) each tin had a UR in it as well as numerous rares holos and rh's  But the highlights were 1 x  Korrina FA holo 1 x Pokémon Fan Club FA Holo 1 x M Kangakhan EX
pkmntcgcollections,38ryzg,ChiefsFan435,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:27:17 2015 UTC,Nothing beats being about 10 years old and buying some boosters at Albertson's when I went grocery shopping with my parents and pulling a Charizard. I can honestly say that was one of the most exciting moments I've ever had with collecting anything.

pkmntcgcollections,38q7dy,primase,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:43:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! I love Mega Gallade
pkmntcgcollections,38q7dy,primase,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:58:17 2015 UTC,How are you planning on storing them?
pkmntcgcollections,38q7dy,primase,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:44:13 2015 UTC,I'm just gonna put them in the box for now. Don't really have anything else as this is my first TCG purchase in forever.
pkmntcgcollections,38o885,Aestysu,2,Fri Jun 5 14:24:14 2015 UTC,You have a miscut. Doesn't happen a lot and pretty rare. The card itself is around $40 on Troll and Toad so with the rarity of the card it probably jumped the value to $50 dollars. Congrats!
pkmntcgcollections,38o885,mitchell77,2,Fri Jun 5 15:18:24 2015 UTC,Square cut cards are harder to keep in good condition due to square edges catching and tearing easily.   Throw that in a toploader ASAP

pkmntcgcollections,38o885,DictatorMad,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:55:08 2015 UTC,Wow that's an awesome opening for flashfire. In my flashfire box I got only the regular charizard and khangaskan ex and two full art trainer's.

pkmntcgcollections,38o07e,aznscourge,2,Fri Jun 5 13:39:08 2015 UTC,"Nice man I'm jealous, opened 12 packs today and got 1 normal holo and nothing else. My roaring skies elite trainer box had 5 Banettes in it as 5 of the 8 rares."
pkmntcgcollections,38prxz,aznscourge,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"Look for the 3-pack blisters.   They're not as much money as an elite trainer box or a full box, but they're still sealed product and shouldn't be tampered with.   The extra packaging, promo, and coin should be enough extra weight to foil any would-be weighers."

pkmntcgcollections,38prxz,aqlno,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"Seeing as Flashfire is out of print and contains Charizard it's going to be pretty pricy.   It might be best to just bite the bullet, save up, and buy a full booster box of it."
pkmntcgcollections,38prxz,primase,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:56:59 2015 UTC,I did know flashfire was out of print. Some stores near me still stock those. I don't see base set xy though.

pkmntcgcollections,38kcap,ortizr93,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:07:53 2015 UTC,I was just thinking - another few Mews you could look for are any that appear in World Championship decks. I know they're not tourney legal or anything and aren't holo but they're still pretty and can be hard to come by?
pkmntcgcollections,38kcap,ortizr93,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:21:23 2015 UTC,Oh good idea! Do you know how many there are?

pkmntcgcollections,38kcap,xmoda,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Ah fair enough, tcgrepublic has one for $100 and I thought that seemed a bit steep but I guess not. It's a nice card though and you couldn't complete your collection without it so it's still not a terrible price to have paid. Is hat the most expensive one in your collection?"
pkmntcgcollections,38kcap,buckanater160,2,Fri Jun 5 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"Oh no. Haha. Looking back, I probably overpaid it by $20 but since it was in such beautiful condition, I couldn't resist buying it."
pkmntcgcollections,38kcap,buckanater160,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:18:02 2015 UTC,I think you are missing a Non Holo. I have the 111/110 Non Holo Mew from Holon Phantoms that I pulled from a pack back in '09.
pkmntcgcollections,38lz8k,Ediamonds2001,2,Fri Jun 5 02:12:22 2015 UTC,35-40.00 is a good price for this card in this condition.

pkmntcgcollections,38d37p,DictatorMad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:09:55 2015 UTC,I would say most of it is lightly played to mint. The guy said he bought them all for the codes which made me feel bad.

pkmntcgcollections,38dr1j,erutaerc01,3,Wed Jun 3 15:35:43 2015 UTC,My interpretation: Complete set is one of each numbered card in the set. Master set is every type of print of each numbered card in the set.    I like to try to do master sets. One booster box gets you most of the non-EX cards and you should just purchase/trade for the remaining EX rares and SRs.  If you get at least two booster boxes you usually get a good amount of the reverse holos. I usually end up buying seven or so reverse holos just to finish it up and it is always less than $7.
pkmntcgcollections,38dr1j,nealappeal,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"I am actually collecting the promo cards too, those with same number and print but different holo patterns (w/ or w/o).  Some will be very hard/expensive to find though like league promos so we'll see"
pkmntcgcollections,38dr1j,cunzhep,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:43:54 2015 UTC,"I count it as just all regular cards, collecting all reverse holos is just a (very expensive) bonus"

pkmntcgcollections,38dr1j,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:26:34 2015 UTC,I like collecting all Reverse Holos unless there is a Holo version of it. One of each number. Master sets are expensive to collect especially considering there are currently 64 sets and ~50+ of those sets can have double the cards.   To each their own though. Some people like the classic route and collect all regular cards.
pkmntcgcollections,38dr1j,The_Variable_Phi,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:29:51 2015 UTC,I guess I am doing the master set for Roaring Skies because I have both the regular card and the reverse holos
pkmntcgcollections,38dr1j,ReshiramQueen79,0,Wed Jun 3 19:48:06 2015 UTC,I would consider a full set to include ALL prints in the series. Yes in terms of playing the game you have two of the same card but from a collecting point of view you have two different cards of the same set but that's IMO
pkmntcgcollections,389yf2,Stevennleee,10,Tue Jun 2 21:10:01 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't disappoint you at all, but all Base Set Machamps are 1st edition, meaning they are not as rare as many people think.  Over here in the States they are worth about $2.00, or about one and a half quid.  So I would say you got about a retail's price =)  What you really want to look for is a ""Shadowless"" 1st Edition Machamp, meaning it could potentially be a true first edition, raising it's price by a couple more bucks, but nothing spectacular."
pkmntcgcollections,389yf2,Kennaay1891,3,Tue Jun 2 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"Ahh man! Oh well, can't complain I only paid £2.

pkmntcgcollections,389yf2,Kennaay1891,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:31:57 2015 UTC,Totally understandable!  I collected Base Set to Neo Genesis as they came out and JUST got back into collecting last fall.  I know the feeling all too well on wanting to collect the original sets again =P
pkmntcgcollections,389yf2,Sage_Wolf,2,Tue Jun 2 21:40:59 2015 UTC,It's a addition! I keep buying cards from base set on eBay :p

pkmntcgcollections,389yf2,Creature_73L,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"eh, $2 to have someone ship it to you and it show up in your mail box seems worth it. Hard to get that and pay less."

pkmntcgcollections,389yf2,Ekyou,0,Wed Jun 3 22:05:43 2015 UTC,If your buying multiple singles the few cents here and there add up and could be put towards other singles. Yes it sounds a bit odd to be skimping over a few cents (or pence in OP's case) but it saves to shop smart

pkmntcgcollections,3885w5,Jsmurff,2,Tue Jun 2 16:58:49 2015 UTC,I also tend to lean towards 3-pack blisters as they're more difficult to weigh than single packs.   I've gotten a bunch of good stuff out of 3-packs but I've also got some rotten ones!   Either way I still feel better buying blisters over single packs.

The other worst thing was missing out on 2002-2012 in the game and the fact that there are quite a few Eeveelutions in the Skyridge and Aquapolis set, which have to be the hardest/most expensive ones to find.

Not as close as you but I think I'm mostly missing a couple of the ultra-rare's, but that's kinda expected.

I'm undecided between Legendary Treasures for the Radiant Collection too, and Flashfire for the same reason you said - the M Charizards. If Plasma Storm was still attainable for a reasonable price I'd get a box of that for the SR Charizard but they're very expensive now"

pkmntcgcollections,38669h,TakavaNirhii,2,Tue Jun 2 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"There were some Japanese sticker cards produced with that holo pattern, I have a few based on cards from the Team Rocket set.

pkmntcgcollections,382tc8,JukeLones,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:00:11 2015 UTC,Is the mewtwo the same size? I have about 150 cards that look like that that are all stickers. they are really cool.
pkmntcgcollections,382tc8,VMNC,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:22:58 2015 UTC,I see those fakes all the time. I can assure you they are fake and very very few people would even consider buying them.   That pattern is there because the people who produce the fake cards don't have the means to replicate the foil prints (expensive) so they take the image of the foil and superimpose it over a global tiled foil pattern to give an approximation of the real thing.

I bought 5 packs a week or two ago (2 BW Base, 2 Emerging Powers, 1 Noble Victories), I bought them because I didn't have the booster pack artworks yet. I ended up pulling a Reshiram full art in my first BW Base pack (which was unbelievable, because I already had Zekrom full art and had wanted Reshiram for awhile). Then on my last pack I opened (Noble Victories) I pulled a damn N Full Art. Which was also incredible, because I didn't look up a setlist beforehand, and I though Victini FA was the only possible UR in that set, so I wasn't expecting to pull anything."

pkmntcgcollections,380oo4,xmoda,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:04:20 2015 UTC,"TPCi has definitely done second print runs of things before. The example that comes to mind is the set of Mewtwo/Darkrai/Keldeo tins that were re-issued with a different mix of packs inside. Threw some people off who wanted the older ones :)  No idea on the copyright. My guess is that the copyright is the same since they're the same cards and they'd be under the same copyright as the first run, and I also haven't heard of recent sets with more than one copyright date. The last run of Base Set is different, for example, and I feel like we'd have heard about that if that were the case with others."
pkmntcgcollections,380oo4,Asclepius24,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:55:43 2015 UTC,I don't believe they are. I pulled a sr charizard a few days ago from one of those blister they started stocking. The cardboard says 2015 copyright but the pack says 2012 and so does the card.

I'm planning on displaying them in some way later on when I get my own place.  Getting 10s isn't too difficult if you're sending Japanese cards. All of the Japanese cards I've pulled myself have come back as 10s, and most of the singles I bought and sent in to PSA also scored 10s. English cards are another story though. They're typically 9s or 8s right out of the pack due to the bad printing quality seen these days (generally whitening and centering issues).   Like /u/mario005 mentioned, sometimes getting 10s comes down to which graders see your cards. I've had cards get 9s, when I thought they'd certainly be 10s. I've also had several cards score 10s when I was thinking they were definitely 9s. So far I've only resubmitted 2 cards that I thought were graded lower, and both times they came back as 10s...PSA's grades aren't always consistent."

pkmntcgcollections,381256,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking much the same myself about Japanese cards - the promos I got the other day were perfect quality, whereas anything English in tins/ blisters seems to be at least a little bowed straight from the packet - especially like in tins where they're clipped into the plastic and you have to poke them from behind to get them out.  WOTC put much more care into the quality of the cards. Pokemon inc making the cards themselves has just put everything into profit; there were like 50 black star WOTC promos over 5 or so years whereas there seems to be 100 per 3 or 4 years nowadays"
pkmntcgcollections,381256,buckanater160,3,Mon Jun 1 11:11:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's annoying how the English promos are jammed into the plastic holders. This always leaves them with some form of damage or another. Tin and box promos are harder to get 10s on because of this.   Agreed. I think the thing with WOTC, is that they were already producing card games so when they took up the Pokemon TCG, they already knew how to produce quality cards. With TPCi taking over the printing themselves, card games weren't exactly their specialty, and it seems they haven't bothered finding a means to produce better quality English cards. They should see what the Japanese printing plant is doing and try to copy that so the cards aren't damaged out of the pack..."
pkmntcgcollections,381256,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:49:36 2015 UTC,Tin promos I don't even see being able to be rated PSA 10 let alone PSA 9... It's really a travesty how they're placed in those tins 😓
pkmntcgcollections,381256,mario005,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:14:19 2015 UTC,"I managed to score 10s on a couple of Charizard EX XY29 Promos a while ago, but yeah, it's a lot more difficult compared to getting 10s in cards from packs... And that's alreàdy difficult as it is :("
pkmntcgcollections,381256,Patriots_Fan,2,Fri Jun 12 18:02:44 2015 UTC,"/u/Patriots_Fan could probably give you more info. Personally, I have two reasons for grading cards:   I plan on selling the graded card and turning some kind of profit either now or in the future. I would only do this for cards that have a current high value (Gold Stars, 1st Edition WOTC Holos, etc) or a projected high value later on (M Charizard 108 come to mind). I want my favorite cards in the best condition and protected for as long as possible.   For now, I'm storing all my graded cards in an Elite Trainer Box but I plan on putting together shadow boxes for my favorites. Unfortunately, there really is no easy binder option for graded cards.  As for getting a 10, my understanding is that it is really difficult. Almost to the point of being luck-based. Here are the standards for cards according to PSA. I have heard stories of people with apparently flawless cards getting 8s and people with extensive whitening on the backs of their cards getting 10s hence why I think it is marginally based on luck.  Hope this helps!"
pkmntcgcollections,381256,ortizr93,2,Mon Jun 1 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"I sort of figured it was weird there was no binder option for graded cards, so I looked into it further. I found these. Might be something you'd be interested in :)"
pkmntcgcollections,381256,Jsmurff,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"Plus there is some inconsistency apparently (as you'd expect, there's more than one person who works at PSA and each person will be somewhere on a scale from lenient to strict), someone here got a few 9s back, took them out of the case, regarded and got 10s iirc."
pkmntcgcollections,381256,Jsmurff,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I typically like to store all of my cards in one binder, and a few lone PSA cards are hard to organize/display, especially since I like to have all of my one card collection (Mew) in the same place.

It depends what you enjoy. Some people stick to sealed, some people buy sealed, but simply can't resist opening them, and some people prefer to just open everything. Japanese booster boxes contain less cards than the English packs though, just FYI."
pkmntcgcollections,37y9t2,JDismyfriend,1 point,Sun May 31 12:45:15 2015 UTC,well are you buying these for your enjoyment or you just want to try and make a profit in the long run? i would look here http://serebii.net/card/english.shtml and maybe look at a set or 2 in particular that you really enjoy and try collecting the whole set? thats what i've started doing and the newer sets you can buy a booster box a month with your income which isnt bad but if you enjoy searching through eBay you can get some cool singles from there. so yeah look at that list to find what cards you really like. and no japanese boxes arent really worth investing in but if you just enjoy opening lots of packs without spending so much buying a japanese booster box a month would be awesome along with your other stuff!

Absol will have to wait until later. I saw on Bulbapedia where it mentioned the price was still $20 like the Groudon EX and Kyogre EX tins but they were only $18.    Edit: After looking at my receipt, they were $20. They were just in the $18 tin spot."

pkmntcgcollections,37q0ri,xmoda,1 point,Fri May 29 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"Up until a couple releases ago they always had stuff out early. The past few they didn't put them out until a week after the release date. Target seems to do a little better job keeping things on time but they put stuff out early sometimes, as well."
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,aznscourge,3,Fri May 29 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I have to be honest, I use them for a new thread I've started up here on Reddit called Pokemon TCG Wonder Trades, where I trade 30, 40, 50, 100 random cards with another member who will trade me back the same amount! I'm expanding my collections like wildfire, and it only costs me about 3 or 4 bucks in postage -- the SAME as I'd pay for a 10 card booster pack! You can check out my thread here if you want to! You never know what cards you might get back! http://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcgtrades/comments/37m2sz/usww_pokemon_tcg_wonder_trades_by_mail/ :)"

pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,ChicaSkas,1 point,Sat May 30 16:13:01 2015 UTC,"At the moment I've just got them all sitting idly in empty ETBs, I don't know what to do with them either. On top of that, I've got two of the packs of energy cards from ETBs I'm not doing anything with.  I don't know whether people actually buy them and don't fancy making those ""100 commons & 1 random holo!"" rip-offs you see on eBay."
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,ortizr93,1 point,Fri May 29 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Card shops will only buy your bulk when you have atless 1000 cards. The one I go to pays $60 for each 1000 card stack. Right now, I have a stack of 7000 cards of commons, uncommons, and rares. I don't sell my holos, I keep them in a deck boxes."
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,DictatorMad,1 point,Fri May 29 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"So roughly 3 boxes' worth of bulk to get $60 back. To be fair I think that's fairly decent, almost buys another box.  Just seems crazy when you think that's 6¢ per card, so an average pack won't even get half of what they cost back, and only 3 or 4 cards in each set go for $20+ so it's always just a losing game"
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,ortizr93,1 point,Sat May 30 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"Well, you could sell the cards one at a time for a dollar online but that would take longer, and you would have to buy more sleeves. These are Commons and Uncommons cards we are talking about, they ain't worth much, and selling a whole bunch at once looks like a time saver, and you get some money in your pocket."
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,DictatorMad,1 point,Sat May 30 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"I usually sell them at $13.50 per each stack of 100 (will also add in a Holo or two). It's a lot easier liquidating bulk during the holiday season at that price though, so I usually just hold onto it and list it all starting in late October."
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Sat May 30 06:43:23 2015 UTC,Ever consider trading them for booster boxes?
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Sat May 30 03:53:01 2015 UTC,Haven't found a place that would do that for me.
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,DictatorMad,1 point,Sat May 30 04:47:08 2015 UTC,I can do that for you. I'm currently trading 1550 bulk non energy English cards for 1 RS sealed box. I have a lot of reference post regarding trading bulk for boxes.
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Sat May 30 04:51:59 2015 UTC,I would like to know how to do that. Now I feel like the card shop I go to has been ripping me off >.> I would love to get a sealed box.
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,DictatorMad,1 point,Sat May 30 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"Oh it's easy, just count how many bulk cards you have and we can start trading. 1550 bulk cards per box is the term. Th cards can be from any set just as long as they are in near mint, English and non energy card."
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Sat May 30 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"Good to know, I keep every card I own in good shape, or I don't even keep them. Is this some kind of site I go to, and ship them for a booster box? And whats a good box to use for shipping 1550 cards?"
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,DictatorMad,1 point,Sat May 30 21:28:12 2015 UTC,USPS medium flat rate box holds around 4500 cards (3 boxes worth of trade) and usps large flat rate box holds around 6500 cards. They are around 12.00 and 17.00 respectively. You just have to tape the box up really well because usps tends to be rough on these boxes.
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Sat May 30 21:36:15 2015 UTC,What a about a cardboard storage box for cards?

pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,wordskis,1 point,Sat May 30 03:06:19 2015 UTC,I buy them and trade them for sealed Roaring Skies boxes or if you wish I can apply it to Ancient Origins when the set is release this August. I usually buy 10-12 cases when a new set is release and I have a lot of feedback regarding trading bulk for sealed booster boxes.
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Sat May 30 03:52:42 2015 UTC,How many do you usually ask for for a sealed box?
pkmntcgcollections,37riy8,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Sat May 30 04:32:17 2015 UTC,1550 for 1 sealed box. Right now I have 10 RS box on hands ready to trade. I will place the pre order for Ancient Origin on the 7th of July and get the boxes 2-3 days before the official release date in August.

pkmntcgcollections,37ngvn,FourMakesTwoUNLESS,3,Thu May 28 23:00:46 2015 UTC,99% sure it's fake. Google the illustrator name and see if anything comes up.

pkmntcgcollections,37ngvn,wordskis,1 point,Thu May 28 23:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been searching contests in Japan to try and find out if it was a singular prize card or anything of the sort. The translation is ""___'s Mew"", I'm guessing the first two characters are somebody's name.    Either way, it seems like a lot of work for a single fake, or if it's somehow rare like you said.    It was in a lot with a bunch of other old Japan exclusive Mewtwo cards, but I don't have a photo since I bought the card individually."
pkmntcgcollections,37ngvn,wordskis,2,Thu May 28 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"""Rine's Mew"". Same name as the illustrator. Maybe it's a fanmade card?"

pkmntcgcollections,37ngvn,tenaciousm17,1 point,Thu May 28 23:00:58 2015 UTC,"Hah yup, the name is only the first two characters (no translations found), the broken circle character is an indicator for a possessive trait (i.e. _'s), and the last 3 is Mew."

pkmntcgcollections,37gt6c,KelsoRules,1 point,Wed May 27 16:49:23 2015 UTC,I started in March and have spent well over half a grand on packs alone and have no where near your full art collection. I have 2. do you buy individually or packs/booster boxes ?
pkmntcgcollections,37gt6c,ortizr93,1 point,Wed May 27 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"2?! You'd be much better off getting boxes - you'll get 1-3 per box, so with £500 that'd be anywhere from 7-21 FAs!

pkmntcgcollections,37gt6c,KelsoRules,1 point,Wed May 27 19:47:10 2015 UTC,Yes 2 and one was from a Japanese booster box. I'll take your advice from now on. Single packs are killing my wallet and not producing.

For me, I made it my goal to just collect Pikachu Card, secret rares and full art cards. If your collect the full set, then box is the way to go or if you building a deck from particular set. Kelsorules, If your like me just out to collect secret rares or full art best bet is buy the card. I always keep an eye on ebay, TnT, and other sites for the card and compare prices. Most of my card found on deal and keep an eye on buy now button on ebay. Some will post a mint card for half of the value. Like the Base set card and plasma card I got off of ebay.

pkmntcgcollections,37id4o,buckanater160,1 point,Thu May 28 22:18:54 2015 UTC,Honestly it doesn't seem like any XY set is worth it in that sense but the black and white cards seem to be a better investment. Only set that seems worth it is maybe phantom forces? It just doesn't seem like these recent sets are retaining any value to be honest.

There are people trying to do this hoping that the new sets will be valuable like the old ones. I dont think any sets other than Dark explorers will be valuable and thats just because of the known pack mapping where people could follow the pack art pattern to pull the ultras.  Some sets like Plasma Storm have gone up in value due to playability of it and future sets. There may be a chance to make 50 to 100 on sets in a year or two due to playability. If you are hoping to make a fortune down the road like the WOTC sets are woth dont bother.

pkmntcgcollections,37id4o,MrIronGolem27,-1,Fri May 29 11:51:23 2015 UTC,"Base Set!  But that might be too hard. Plasma Storm has already seen some crazy price jumps (x2.5-4) due to Virbank, Laser, ACE SPECS, and Colress.   My bet is on Flashfire."

pkmntcgcollections,37e9lv,The_Variable_Phi,3,Wed May 27 00:09:37 2015 UTC,"You'd have to weigh the packs yourself. And there is actually a way to do it that doesn't rip anyone off. I had been getting crap pulls from my local Target last year, so I decided to take a scale and weigh some of the packs. My plan was, if at least a few of the packs were the weight of an Ultra Rare pack (which is how it should be, there should be at least a few on the shelves at any given time, if no one has weighed at that store), I was going to randomly shuffle all the packs, and then buy a few as I normally would. However, after weighing about 30 packs, all of them weighed too little to contain an Ultra Rare, or even a holo. Needless to say, I no longer purchase loose packs from that Target"
pkmntcgcollections,37e9lv,wordskis,1 point,Wed May 27 01:13:50 2015 UTC,Wow so you're telling me people go in a physically weigh packs on a scale?
pkmntcgcollections,37e9lv,wordskis,1 point,Fri May 29 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yep. Using a pocket scale. Then they buy only the packs that weighed more. I assumed you already knew that, based on your question haha"
pkmntcgcollections,37e9lv,mario005,1 point,Fri May 29 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't even know what weighed meant I thought they opened them and took out all the rares as opposed to the literal sense.  I'm astounded. That's ridiculous.  I collected 15 years ago when it all started but I only got packs as gifts, even at a young age I was more keen in buying singles and trading."
pkmntcgcollections,37e9lv,xmoda,2,Fri May 29 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"There is no way to know for individual packs. Like Credits_PTCGO said, unless you see it being done, the packs could or could not be weighed. This is why we frown upon the practice so much (unless you weigh packs from a booster box you bought and sold the remaining packs as ""weighed""). It doesn't really make things fair for everyone else."

pkmntcgcollections,37e9lv,YahMoBeThere1,1 point,Wed May 27 03:03:58 2015 UTC,"If you have comic/card stores near you, these are the best places to purchase packs, especially if they are behind the counter. Card stores typically do NOT tolerate weighing because they are small enough to care about their reputation as a card-seller. Plus, if they're behind the counter, customers cannot weigh them. Whether the store employees weigh them, on the other hand...well, you'll have to find out firsthand.  That, or buy tins/blisters, as those are likely not weighed."

If they made a mess of the area and the stock person comes by and cleans them back up they can appear freshly stocked but still weighed. They won't swap out the weighed packs with new ones."

pkmntcgcollections,3798fj,Credits_PTCGO,2,Tue May 26 01:37:48 2015 UTC,I kinda like it :)    But the quality of cards from xy sets has been pretty bad in all honesty. I recently opened up a roaring skies booster box and some of the regular rares had scratches on the front right out of the pack

pkmntcgcollections,3798fj,EsperWatkins,1 point,Tue May 26 15:05:08 2015 UTC,"I think it is cool too; but I would probably email product replacement for a replacement pack anyways - it isn't like they take the miscut pack. They just ask for proof of purchase (you've probably already thrown that away at this point), picture of packaging, and picture of the card. The only problem is it takes forever for them to get around to it."
pkmntcgcollections,3798fj,EsperWatkins,1 point,Tue May 26 16:20:09 2015 UTC,Do you know what the email for product replacement is. I wanted to give them a piece of my mind regarding a roaring skies booster box I recently opened.    A good number of the regular rares/ancient trait cards (over half I would say) had scratches on the front right out of the pack. This was kind of a let down for me.

pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,joesaysso,1 point,Sun May 24 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of all the Expansions so far. You can click on each one for info about that particular expansion, including a list of all the cards in the set.  The types of cards you can get are Common, Uncommon, Rare, Rare Holo (holographic), EX, EX Full Art, Mega, Mega Full Art, Secret Rare. Common, Uncommon and Rare are the cards you'll encounter the most in booster packs. Each pack contains 5 common cards, 3 uncommon cards, 1 reverse holo, and 1 rare. The reverse holo can be any common, uncommon, rare, or rare holo (if the reverse holo you get is a card that is usually a rare holo, the image won't have it's usual holo design, it'll just have the reverse holo pattern). The rare card can be a regular rare, a rare holo, or an Ultra Rare.  As far as Ultra Rare cards (EX, EX Full Art, Mega, Mega Full Art, Secret Rare), those are much harder to obtain in booster packs. They show up randomly in the ""rare"" card spot of a booster pack, with odds of obtaining one being anywhere from 1 in 7 packs to about 1 in 12 packs. But since buying packs is random, you could get one in your first pack, or it could take you 30+ packs to get one.   Look through the card lists of each expansion from XY through Roaring Skies, to get a better idea of what's in the set. For example, every EX card in XY Base Set has a Full Art as well. However, in Furious Fists, Hawlucha has a regular EX, but not a Full Art EX. It just varies from set to set.  I could go into more detail, but this should get you started. Bulbapedia is a great resource, as you can look at the list of all sets, then select a specific set from that list, then select a specific card from that list.  Let me know if you have any more specific questions."
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,wordskis,1 point,Sun May 24 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I tried Bulbapedia before making this post. It just seemed incomplete to what I am after. I am looking for a no-kidding comprehensive list of all the variants of each card per set.  For example, XY series card number 3 is Weedle. Is there a checklist that details all of the different variants of what is considered to be XY series card number 3 Weedle. There is the common version. I take from your post that every card has a reverse holo version of itself. So that's two versions. Is there a holo version of that card as well?  Contrary to that, card #114 is Rare Holo Furfrou. I picked this card up in one of my packs this week. It is labeled with a black star, which I learned means that, simply, it is a rare holo. So does that mean that there is no regular, non-holo version of this card that I need to look for?  Maybe these seem like dumb questions to someone who has collected these for a while. But as a noob, how do I know when I have, literally, every card for a set. I downloaded an app and it said that there is a minimum of 3 different versions of every card. 4 for some if you include the world championship variant, whatever that is.  Sorry if I am being a bother."

For holos like Furfrou, you can look on Bulbapedia for the versions. You'll see on the XY set list that Furfrou has a star with an H beside it, that means that it's a Rare Holo. However, on the actual card, it does just have the star, and no H (that's just how it's printed on the actual cards). Furfrou is an interesting example though, because it was reprinted for the Primal Clash 3-pack blister packs, with a different type of holo pattern. You can find that out from the ""Additional Cards"" box on the XY Bulbapedia page. Also in the Additional Cards box, you'll see Aromatisse and Slurpuff listed. These are an example of when cards that are usually holo, can be non-holo. In the XY set, both of those cards are holographic rares. However, in the ""Resilient Life"" theme deck, they are both printed as non-holographic cards.   With the sheer number of different products released, it's extremely difficult to figure out every single version of a particular card. But the ""Additional Cards"" list at the top of the page for each Expansion is a good place to look."
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,ChicaSkas,1 point,Sun May 24 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I got that Resilient Life theme deck last week. That was one of the first things that I bought for my collection. Good to know that it's complicating matters now. I can handle two versions of every card. That makes setting up a binder easy and makes for a pretty nice display with a regular page and a holo page alternating. It's when third version come into play that is really going to throw my collection OCD for a loop.  Thanks again for your replies."
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,Credits_PTCGO,1 point,Sun May 24 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"To answer another question, example: how many versions of a common card like Weedle: sometimes, in promo boxes at Walmart and Target, they will release regular holo (not a reverse holo) versions of common cards and stick them in as bonuses. For example, there are 3 Tyrunt cards: non holo, reverse holo, and regular holo from an ""Ancient Powers"" box."
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,Credits_PTCGO,1 point,Thu May 28 17:34:45 2015 UTC,"Not trying to retalk about whats already been said here but this is what i have learnt for collecting purposes since starting around a year ago, also at xy base set.  Orriginally i was buying booster boxes, but this leaves a lot of duplicate cards + there is the ""special"" cards included in things like theme decks, blisters, tins etc....so i have started to prefer the promotional items to obtain these for the collection. It gives enough packs to open for common, uncommon and the chance of pulling rare+. Yes, this is more expensive per pack but with all the left over untradable cards you really waste a lot of 2-3 booster box packs in duplicates. These however do have the almost guaranteeed chance of pulling rare cards but whatever, ill take my chances.  So you get the unique cards, pins, jumbo cards, promos etc....any duplicates can be traded for needs or if your patient find the remaining cards cheap at a garage sale, flea market, local card shop. Part of the fun for me is findingvthe card/s at a deal with the satisfaction of gaining fround towards completion.  For a list of cards there is a nice excel sheet that is fairly comprehensive. Ive adapted my own but there is another guy that has done it too and shared here somewhere"
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,Audacidy,1 point,Sun May 24 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"I have debated this subject lately as far as what I will be buying to progress my collection. Booster boxes are nice and offer the luxary of providing a full selection of unweighed packs, which from reading here for a few days seems to be a big problem.  I don't know if I have 100 bucks at a time to drop on Pokemon cards. The other part is those promotional things. It IS more money per pack. They do give you all of those other things but I'm not really interested in those.  I figure I'd give those to my son, who has his own collection (of sorts) going. As far as the doubles, well that's a part of card collecting that I've come to accept. The nice difference between pokemon and sports cards is at least you have something to do with your doubles. Get enough of them and I can build a proper deck and sit down for a game night with my son and play an actual game of pokemon cards.  For what its worth, I haven't come to a conclusion. Those other promotional items tend to mix and match booster packs. Booster boxes or buying random packs at the store allow me to focus on one set at a time.  It will probably be a little bit of all as certain items have sales. Ebay and card stores will help to."
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,Audacidy,1 point,Sun May 24 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"I feel you with the pack weighing thing which is why i made the choice to do blisters. For example with the new roaring skies,declining a booster box and buying the blisters have 8 booster packs and the 4 new XY promos. We got a decent part of all the commons and uncommons and a hand full rares. When the new season tins come out you get some more roaring skies packs +the promos and some previous stores packs for attempt to complete them if not some trades.   The pack weighing thing but also the expense of 36 packs and needing to get some extras have recently led to this conclusion. Each tot heir own but hope this helps in your decision.  PS actually playing vs collecting. When both are involved there comes the decision that cards you need are in the collection and should you use them. ....because you know it helps out,  i think they're was a thread we talked about it, ....tough decisions!"
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,Credits_PTCGO,1 point,Sun May 24 22:19:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Playing vs. collecting is an easy decision for me. I'm a collector. Playing the game doesn't interest me as much. Outside of an occasional game night with my son (and only when I have enough doubles to do so), I'll never play with real cards. I won't be hitting the game stores or anything for tournaments."
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,ChicaSkas,1 point,Mon May 25 04:54:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think buying singles is the best way to go. I've bought over 30 and I think pull rate is about 1/5-6 for an UR. I know they're not weighed since I did this for the most recent set and I was there when they were just stocking them. At about $4 for a blister, that's $20-$24 for an UR. Of course you could get lucky or have even worse luck, this is just based off my experiences."
pkmntcgcollections,373kj9,ChicaSkas,1 point,Sun May 24 23:48:39 2015 UTC,How much are you paying for a pack? I hit a Toys R Us the other day and grabbed a couple random packs at $5 per pack. I didn't pull any URs fwiw. Did I overpay and where should I be buying my packs for a better price?

I've seen them stocked in WH Smith, but they're pretty overpriced there.  For online, I would recommend eBay, Magic Madhouse, Chaos Cards, and Troll and Toad. I'd say eBay and T&T are best for singles, whilst MM and CC are good for packs, because you know they aren't weighed."

pkmntcgcollections,371i3a,hpboy,3,Sun May 24 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say the original base is probably the best to have. It still feels like there are probably thousands out there, but people are slowly opening them, and they're only going to get rarer :)"
pkmntcgcollections,371i3a,JDismyfriend,2,Sun May 24 09:49:25 2015 UTC,"Who knows. Base set is always going to be the best investment of the original sets, other than that I'd recommend some of the latest WOTC sets, the ones that were run for a shorter time before they lost the contract to make he cards. And obviously 1st ed > unlimited.  Edit: also investing £240 at a moderate 3% for 20 years as you said will be worth £433.47. Do you think a Rocket booster box will be worth that much in 20 years?"
pkmntcgcollections,371i3a,ortizr93,2,Sun May 24 00:56:36 2015 UTC,I don't think it will be worth that much in 20 years. Specially since it's one of the common booster boxes out there and also one of the cheapest ones at out.  Thanks for the tips on the base set and WOTC sets. Will look into it some more.

pkmntcgcollections,36yiu8,Sage_Wolf,2,Sat May 23 04:58:04 2015 UTC,How did you assemble this? Did you buy it all complete or did you piece it together?
pkmntcgcollections,36yiu8,Sage_Wolf,1 point,Sat May 23 05:04:06 2015 UTC,Well it was a little of both. I had been buying them one card at a time but it was taking forever (like over a year to get 20 or so cards at a decent price). So I made a low offer on a complete and got the lot for a good deal.
pkmntcgcollections,36yiu8,holywowwhataguy,2,Sat May 23 05:21:12 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Congratulations!

Ho-oh is one of my all-time favorite pokemons, and I've actually been looking into this card ever since I started collecting (which...wasn't really all that long before, really).

I bought the Japanese cards from TCGRepublic and would do so again in a heartbeat; all the cards arrived in what I'd say is gem mint condition, far better than the mint/ near mint they have to list them as on the website to avoid complaints.

pkmntcgcollections,36peck,PikaKrabby,1 point,Thu May 21 22:36:20 2015 UTC,I am not bidding on anything right now.  I do not plan on bidding on anything for at least 1 or 2 months.    I usually just stick to buy it nows anyways.    I hope you find what your looking for at a price you want it for.   what are you looking for?
pkmntcgcollections,36oenk,thesilentchief,2,Wed May 20 21:29:06 2015 UTC,Congrats! Sick pulls.
pkmntcgcollections,36oenk,tooku24,1 point,Wed May 20 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"LOL, got another Shaymin EX today from the same booster box at my local card store."
pkmntcgcollections,36oenk,sangyuplee,0,Fri May 22 06:17:59 2015 UTC,Those will get you money for more boosters!! Sell the Shaymin! They're selling like hot cakes right now!!
pkmntcgcollections,36oenk,alcaponesuite,1 point,Wed May 20 23:33:27 2015 UTC,I always keep a least one.
pkmntcgcollections,36oenk,sangyuplee,1 point,Thu May 21 02:29:38 2015 UTC,"Well, you better hope you get a second one while everyone still wants one! That Shaymin's gonna drop as soon as everyone has a few in their decks (although that won't be for a while)"
pkmntcgcollections,36om62,-LezLemon-,3,Wed May 20 22:20:30 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool. You must be good buds.
pkmntcgcollections,36om62,Patriots_Fan,2,Thu May 21 00:16:52 2015 UTC,Amazing!   :D  Happy for you!
pkmntcgcollections,36om62,Wheatizard,3,Thu May 21 01:30:08 2015 UTC,I think this means wheatizard's on his way to steal your card OP...
pkmntcgcollections,36om62,thecardpletionist,2,Fri May 22 22:00:01 2015 UTC,L to the O to the second L
pkmntcgcollections,36om62,Wheatizard,1 point,Sat May 23 04:02:38 2015 UTC,Did your friend realize they gave away a card worth that much? Lol
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,primase,3,Thu May 21 00:08:51 2015 UTC,Still waiting on my submission from March. I'm sure I'll have a few things to post when the cards are returned to me.
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Thu May 21 00:14:09 2015 UTC,What's the turn around on those?
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,Patriots_Fan,2,Thu May 21 00:16:42 2015 UTC,~50 business days.
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Thu May 21 00:17:38 2015 UTC,Wow. I was thinking maybe two weeks.
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,ortizr93,1 point,Thu May 21 00:27:00 2015 UTC,"At this point, yes, they should be done in the next two weeks. Bulk submissions overall take approximately 45-50 business days to grade (sometimes PSA finishes sooner than that). There are options to have cards graded in 5 or 10 business days but those are more expensive, so it's only worth paying $17 or $35 per card if you're absolutely certain the cards will get 10s."
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Thu May 21 00:37:45 2015 UTC,Understood.
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,ShadowMoses05,1 point,Thu May 21 01:21:29 2015 UTC,How much is it per card with the regular waiting period?
pkmntcgcollections,36p0xg,ShadowMoses05,2,Sat May 23 03:46:18 2015 UTC,"Regular (the 10 business day option) is $17 per card. Return shipping would also be $18 minimum, but I'm not sure what the return shipping cost would be for people submitting from outside the US."
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,miscmouse,2,Wed May 20 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of people sell their old Cards. You can buy complete sets on eBay. If you only want specific Cards you can buy them from the pkmntrade subreddit, eBay and sites that sell singles like: Troll and Toad, Professor Oak, Collectors Cash."
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Togepi175,2,Wed May 20 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"Check out yard sales and flea markets if you're on a budget. A lot of people don't realize the value of the cards and just want to get rid of them. However, keep an eye out for fakes at flea markets. You'll have to use your own judgement to determine the authenticity and condition of the cards. I haven't personally used this method, but I know many people who have."
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,-LezLemon-,1 point,Wed May 20 21:02:17 2015 UTC,Would recommend Craigslist as well.
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Patriots_Fan,2,Thu May 21 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to pay for the shipping I have many extras of the base set stuff and since I already have a complete set, there doesn't seem much point of me holding on to dozens of extra commons. What are you missing? and I'll take a gander at what I've got."
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Creature_73L,2,Wed May 20 21:33:27 2015 UTC,I literally lost all of it. Except my promo ancient mew (my sister found that) I'd definitely pay shipping and if you've got some nice stuff I could even trade you a custom made bobble head!
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Creature_73L,1 point,Wed May 20 21:38:40 2015 UTC,Oh the old promo ancient mew. Gotta love it. Let me take a quick look here. I'm also working out while redditing lol. edit:  Unfortunately I've given away most of my extra base set holos to others on reddit. But I've counted 96 cards from the commons/non-holos that I have duplicates of.
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,wordskis,2,Wed May 20 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"PM me. I have lots of early holographic cards for sale. I have 23 references over in /r/pkmntcgtrades (meaning, I've completed 23 trades/sales with other reddit users)."
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,thesilentchief,1 point,Thu May 21 08:30:17 2015 UTC,"Ebay's great. You can find most cards for no shipping, and Base Set cards are quite cheap if we're talking Unlimited instead of First Edition. Hell, Charizard's the most expensive of the bunch and he's usually ~$16.99 at ""near mint."""
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Satanasaur,1 point,Thu May 21 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to start over completely, go to /r/pkmntcg or message me, as I have just about every common and uncommon from the first base set spare :) I'd be willing to sell them to you cheap! It's surprising how easy it is to get older cards still, or the common ones at least, maybe not the rates, they get pretty pricey."
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Satanasaur,1 point,Thu May 21 06:32:11 2015 UTC,Sounds great how cheap? : )
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Satanasaur,1 point,Thu May 21 12:33:02 2015 UTC,Depends on how many you want :) have you already got any of them? If not I will compile a list of all I do have along with prices for you
pkmntcgcollections,36ntna,Satanasaur,1 point,Thu May 21 12:54:30 2015 UTC,No I have none.

pkmntcgcollections,36kgv7,ShadowMoses05,10,Wed May 20 01:19:44 2015 UTC,JEALOUS
pkmntcgcollections,36kgv7,EposVox,2,Wed May 20 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"That's a GREAT promo piece. Many people don't know how easy it is to ask for this stuff, it's final destination is the dumpster, and these are very rare and priceless display pieces for your collections! Enjoy this! I wish I'd asked for mine at my Gamestop, lol! But, every game release, I ask for the posters, I have all the display posters for almost all the games from Heart Gold Soul Silver to Omega Ruby / Alpha Sapphire!"

pkmntcgcollections,36kgv7,AR96,1 point,Wed May 20 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, seeing as I only got back into collecting a week ago I'm quite looking forward to having the money to properly collect again once I get a grad job.

pkmntcgcollections,36ntfs,cunzhep,1 point,Wed May 20 19:06:37 2015 UTC,Promos usually don't have 1st ED. At least from what I've seen so far.
pkmntcgcollections,36ntfs,sangyuplee,1 point,Wed May 20 21:13:38 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Great to have that confirmation
pkmntcgcollections,36ntfs,sangyuplee,1 point,Wed May 20 21:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, no problem"
pkmntcgcollections,36ntfs,Ju-da-su,1 point,Wed May 20 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"They don't, since most of them are only printed once anyway. Would be weird if all the cards ever printed are all 1ED..."
pkmntcgcollections,36lwyb,Stevennleee,3,Wed May 20 10:27:38 2015 UTC,"Buy penny sleeves. That was my first mistake. I bought toploaders and used those without the sleeves. Sleeves make it much easier to remove and more importantly adds additional from scratching and scuffing, especially, if you plan to get them graded."
pkmntcgcollections,36lwyb,primase,2,Wed May 20 15:41:10 2015 UTC,The only tip I can give you is set yourself goals and realistic limits. Only collect what you want to collect. Enjoy!
pkmntcgcollections,36lwyb,OzEnigma2,1 point,Wed May 20 13:38:25 2015 UTC,When I was a kid I collected the first few sets that came out but they're probably hard to get hold of now so might stick to the newer ones?

pkmntcgcollections,36lwyb,thebrokenbox,1 point,Thu May 21 07:14:50 2015 UTC,That is such an insanely good idea.
pkmntcgcollections,36lwyb,ChicaSkas,1 point,Sun May 24 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"What are your favorite pokemon? YOu might make a list of a few of your faves, and start with those. For example, I collect all the Cat evolution lines (Meowth, Skitty, Purrloin, Shinx, LitLeo, ect) Or, you can start just collecting any card that's pokemon, use this chart http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_expansions  to help you figure out which set they came from. Since 1999, there have been about 64 card sets in North America, beginning with Base Set and ending a week or two ago with Roaring Skies (and more are being developed as Pokemon itself evolves.  Also, you can go to local hobby/card shops if you have any and see if you can buy some cards from the oldest sets , if you want, and see if anyone will gift you cards they don't want, if they collect, to get you started. Sometimes just asking point blank and honestly can get you results. Also, go out on weekends and check out Garage Sales in your area. Some people are happy to unload Junior's cards on whoever has the cash, or they have zero concept of how valuable the older cards are. Good luck!"
pkmntcgcollections,36lwyb,likeitsmaddie,1 point,Wed May 20 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"For me, I LOVE to collect anything that has art that I like haha.  Just do what you like and collect at your own pace; one thing I remember is that I'm not in 'competition' with other collectors and I don't need to have a ""better"" collection than anyone else. :) also make sure you have the right means to store your collection; you always want to have at least some penny sleeves and toploaders when you open packs in the event you pull an ultra/secret rare."
pkmntcgcollections,36lwyb,sangyuplee,0,Wed May 20 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Don't buy individual packs from Walmart, Target, Toys R Us. They probably are weighed and you won't get any good cards... This advice will save you tons of $$.  Weighing packs is when somebody brings a little digital scale and weighs all the packs in the store and buys the heaviest ones. Those usually have Full Arts and EXs.  Instead, get those 3 booster blister pack that comes with a coin/pin or get a power tins (The little tin cases with a promo card in front). You'll have a better chance of getting good cards there legitimately. For older cards, look around r/pkmntcgtrades or ebay! And trade with people online! Good luck!!!"

pkmntcgcollections,36hmr9,Archaonlotr,4,Tue May 19 13:29:26 2015 UTC,Yup! Primal Clash had them bad on many of their Full Arts. I pulled a few. Totally sucks...the production quality of that set. There have been many posts about this on this subreddit and I doubt Pokemon does anything about it. I hadn't noticed any in Roaring Skies but I have only pulled three FAs so far. I did recently buy some Dragons Exalted packs and pulled a FA Giratina EX with the same white specks. I wasn't collecting during that period so I don't know if it was prevalent back then.

Check out Flashfire,  there's a bunch of charizard half arts in that set, including a full art.    I pulled that same plasma storm secret rare and my reaction  was priceless.  I should post the video here,  xD   it was epic."

I only got the FA Charizard, and Chari X from trading, but never got to pull them from a pack.  Charizard is the only pokemon I never have good luck with pulling, since the base set as a kid, so I was pretty happy when I got that shiny Charizard from PS"

pkmntcgcollections,36e89q,xRacoon,3,Tue May 19 00:46:29 2015 UTC,I made my peace with it!   I just feel like they tried to copy blaines error to make the card seem more valuable.

pkmntcgcollections,36ahao,ortizr93,1 point,Sun May 17 20:40:53 2015 UTC,Ikr! I just love em! The artwork on the past few releases have been astounding.
pkmntcgcollections,36cayf,TakavaNirhii,5,Mon May 18 06:08:16 2015 UTC,"I always kept them organise by set, and as long as you've ordered them within each set by the numbers at the bottom of the cards, with spaces for those you don't have, there's no need to go back and shift everything every time you get a new card"
pkmntcgcollections,36cayf,ortizr93,2,Mon May 18 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"Do you currently store every card in a binder?  What's your goal?  Do you want one of each?    I organize them by generation. (Ex. 1st gen, 2nd gen, etc) / Then When they were released within that generation.  http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_expansions  You might want to then within those sets organize the cards by the set numbers.  If you are putting everything in a binder though... Hard to do anything other than leave some empty spaces"
pkmntcgcollections,36cayf,tooku24,2,Mon May 18 07:34:07 2015 UTC,"You could start with 64 blank pages of paper, each one 3-hole-punched, and each one numbered, with the names of the set, (print this guide out: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_expansions ) and then match which cards go where, and have a single 9 card page behind each paper that describes each set. then you can expand from there as you get more cards in each set."

pkmntcgcollections,36cayf,ChicaSkas,2,Wed May 20 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I wasn't clear enough, lol! :) Pokemon.com has a list of each card set going back to July 2003's set, with Ex Ruby/Sapphire: http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/trading-card-expansions/ (scroll down to get the oldest set) (I believe this was about the time when the cards switched from Wizards of the Coast to the Pokemon Company.) You can print out each checklist for every set since then, from the 16th set (ExRubySapphire in 2003) to the 64th set (Roaring Skies, May 2015) I put all the checklists I printed out in sheet protectors, they serve as tabs to separate each expansion set. They are also great as an offline reference guide to match up cards to. I'm looking online to try to find some cool checklists for the Wizards sets, sets #1 (Base Set) through #15 (Skyridge). These checklists I'm talking about look really cool in ones binder, check 'em out! http://assets18.pokemon.com/assets/cms/pdf/tcg/checklists/holonphantoms_checklist.pdf"

I pulled Kangaskan EX from FlashFire and a couple reverse holos :)"
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,OrangeRabbit,2,Sun May 17 21:55:20 2015 UTC,"The whole point of a booster is that chance you get something really rare. You should just buy bulk if you want bulk. Unless these searched packs are going for less than a dollar, bulk is probably the better bargain for random common cards."
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,DoctorBulgrave,2,Sun May 17 22:19:12 2015 UTC,The simple answer is NO. 1 rare card is sometime worth as much as half to a full booster box. Buying already weighted packs is like playing Russian roulette with ammo in all the chambers. It's a lose lose situation for you.
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,secretlypoisonpeople,4,Sun May 17 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"As someone who occasionally sells weighed booster packs, I'd like to add a bit to the discussion: If you're buying the weighed packs at ~$1.80 during the week of the set's release, you can sell the codes for $0.40 and you actually end up paying $1.40 per pack once you sell all the codes (if you play online, then there's always a chance you pull someth valuable that you can sell/trade for more than the $1.40 value the pack cost).  You can push $13.50 per 100 bulk common/uncommons (while adding a Holo PR two), if you'd decide to sell the bulk instead.  Also, you can just hold onto the packs 'til they become more valuable, and you can trade them/sell them one at a time to people who collect sealed packs, as well as to people who send packs to be graded by PSA (since these collectors are more likely to prefer weighed packs over unsearched packs).  Edit: this assuming you're looking to sell or get the most value out of the money you  spend on the packs. If you just want the bulk to keep it or for trading, you'll need to pull some valuable reverse holos and Trainers to at least make sure you don't lose out too much."
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Mon May 18 02:54:37 2015 UTC,Noob question incoming - How exactly do you discern if packs have been weighed/searched?
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,matubula,1 point,Sun May 17 23:46:52 2015 UTC,"Since you don't need to do anything to a pack to weigh it besides place it on the scale, there's really no way to tell if a pack has been weighed. A lot of ebayers weigh their packs and don't mention it in the listing, so be wary of buying loose packs on ebay. If a pack has been searched and resealed, the crimped/sealed parts will look funny, like they were pulled apart and stuck back together."
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Mon May 18 00:02:35 2015 UTC,"Only if you can get them for really cheap. Don't pay full price for those. But I agree with Bulgrave, buying bulk could be a better deal."
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Mon May 18 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"I have seen people weighed packs in stores, and I still buy them. I have gotten lucky, like finding a SR M Kanga, after someone have weighed all the packs."
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,DictatorMad,1 point,Mon May 18 00:31:14 2015 UTC,"It can be worth it if you just want to open some packs to complete the C/UC/R set and you can get a good deal, OR if there are valuable uncommon trainers/Pokemon in the set that you're hoping to get. Also it's a very good way to build a collection of sealed packs, especially because you'll be less tempted to crack them open."
pkmntcgcollections,36awzg,errantdog,1 point,Mon May 18 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"If you're buying from a store, Try to go with something like these.  Pack weighing is easy, and hard to detect, so you're VERY likely to suffer from someone pulling everything ahead of you.  The 3 pack blisters are usually a tiny-bit better of a deal, and they are much harder to ""weigh"" at the store, making them a safer buy for you."

pkmntcgcollections,3689jl,tooku24,2,Sun May 17 04:50:42 2015 UTC,I just got back into collecting and the Shining holo collections are the first ones I'm trying to finish.  I'll upload my collection in a few.

I was fortunate enough to get Kabutops organically in a trade from someone who thought it was fake, and even as a dumb kid I knew to keep that thing wrapped up and safe."
pkmntcgcollections,3689jl,tooku24,1 point,Sun May 17 04:49:30 2015 UTC,Did you recently complete your collection? Or has this been something you've had for some time now?  And what's  next for you?
pkmntcgcollections,3689jl,xmoda,1 point,Sun May 17 07:24:38 2015 UTC,"Nah, I've had my Shining cards for a few years now. I'm getting close to completing my collection though. I'll consider it complete when I get every holo/rare from Base set through Destiny, skipping Base 2 because of redundancy. Luckily, I've gotten the very rare stuff out of the way, and did so a few years ago before these things skyrocketed in value (my Shining Charizard was forty bucks on Ebay when I got it, and in very good condition). It's slightly unexciting now because I mostly have fluff left to get. After this I'll probably just get cards I like the looks of. I've been looking at these newer full art cards and that's exactly the sort of thing I like, also the Legends cards from the HG/SS run."
pkmntcgcollections,3689jl,pikachupewpew,1 point,Sun May 17 07:35:05 2015 UTC,Sounds like we might have the same taste in collections.  I'm thinking about the new Full Art cards and the two-card Legendaries.  I have a few holos from Base/Jungle/Fossil in the trade area.  Let me know if you need any of 'em.
pkmntcgcollections,3689jl,pikachupewpew,2,Sun May 17 08:19:14 2015 UTC,I'm confused why no shining magikarp?

Theres also the ones with super thin lettering too which are obvious as the sun is bright."
pkmntcgcollections,3617xf,primase,1 point,Sat May 16 02:14:30 2015 UTC,Is the PSA casing identical too?
pkmntcgcollections,3617xf,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Sat May 16 11:01:56 2015 UTC,Very similar.  sometimes they are just recycled cases from other psa gradings that only got like a 5 or a 6 and they just fabricate them like that.

pkmntcgcollections,35wo6y,acebren,1 point,Thu May 14 03:20:05 2015 UTC,your collection is worth a few hundred dollars or more
pkmntcgcollections,35wo6y,Sage_Wolf,1 point,Fri May 15 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"Depends if you wanted to sell all as one lot or as individual cards. Your best bet is searching sold eBay listings for cards identical to the ones you have. For example, search Charizard 4/102 for the Base Set Charizard, and that will show you how much that card has sold for in the past.  It's a nice older collection but I'd say the most valuable card you have is the Base Sset Charizard, which would come in at around $20 or so in value (assuming you're in the US).  Have a look at your Japanese holos too. Some of the early print runs of those have no rarity symbol in the bottom right corner of the card. It's a long shot, but if you have those, some of them are worth quite a lot."
pkmntcgcollections,35wo6y,General_Hide,1 point,Thu May 14 04:20:35 2015 UTC,From what you see in the pictures. How much would you pay for it? just wondering.

Think I was due another FA or two too, I believe the odds on those are 1 per 12 packs so getting just 2 seemed a bit low. Besides SRs, FAs and EXs I think there were only 2 or 3 holo cards I didn't get from the set which isn't bad.  Was pleased with my FA Radiant Collection Mew though, it was the only thing I was hoping for from the 3 Legendary Treasures boosters."

pkmntcgcollections,35wztp,PotentialVagrant,1 point,Thu May 14 05:22:09 2015 UTC,I guess that really depends. On high end cards that have both languages available that might be the case.  But looking at Roaring Skies/Emerald Break I don't think it is. FA Shaymin EX is going for more in Japanese than it is in English on eBay from what I have seen.
pkmntcgcollections,35wztp,OzEnigma2,1 point,Thu May 14 06:08:31 2015 UTC,"Well it JUST released in english so it's still pretty ambiguous as to how many Shaymins there are in the market. As it stands it might just be that there's been a lot of pulls with Shaymins and it drove the price down. Also, don't Japanese boosters not guarantee rares?"
pkmntcgcollections,35wztp,Stofenthe1st,1 point,Sat May 16 08:12:31 2015 UTC,"Japanese boosters don't guarantee rares so you are correct. You get a rare in every second pack. Japanese rares are holos though. That being said for the price of an English booster box I can buy 4 Japanese boxes. From that I'll get a minimum of 12 Ultra Rares and sometimes up to 16. FA cards are a bit rarer in the Japanese sets, so from those 4 boxes I might not get any. Chances are I'll get 1-2 though.  I dare say there are far more English cards printed though."
pkmntcgcollections,35wztp,OzEnigma2,1 point,Sat May 16 08:27:22 2015 UTC,English cards are worth more yes as japanese cards are cheaper to purchase
pkmntcgcollections,35wztp,xmoda,1 point,Fri May 15 05:54:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, the overall value is actually a lot more for Japanese cards. Japanese cards are priced based on rarity rather than competitive value, which is how it should be. Also, the overall quality of the cards is a lot better. You can actually buy the cards for less money.  So overall, Japanese cards are a much better deal if you're not into competitive play."
pkmntcgcollections,35wztp,comp0ckerr,1 point,Thu May 14 13:01:51 2015 UTC,"It's how I remember both languages being 15 years ago, and why I was so surprised that some EX cards from a set like Roaring Skies that has been out a week can already be worth less than £5 when you need to buy on average 6 packs to pull one"
pkmntcgcollections,35wztp,ortizr93,1 point,Thu May 14 16:27:26 2015 UTC,Well the english cards will also be priced based on rarity once they get rotated out of legal sets.

It's a set that released in 1998. They came on a sheet where you could peel the cards off the sheet. There were vending machines where you could but these, hence the name. The Pikachu, Mewtwo, and Mew shown are from Series #00, which were premiered at the WHF in 1997 and are the promotional cards for the set. Pretty rare to find but not impossible."

It has to be one of my top 5 perhaps, definitely top 10 favourite pokemon but as far as my collection goes all the Blastoise' are kind of forgettable in my opinion. They aren't bad - the base and expedition are quite nice but they don't do Blastoise justice in my view. It would have been great for example for it to have a shining version in the Neo sets or similar.   Anyone else have a similar view on a certain pokemon?"
pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,sangyuplee,1 point,Wed May 13 07:32:09 2015 UTC,Seriously! The only Blastoise cards I like are Clair's Blastoise and the Japanese CD Promo (Original Ken Sugimori design). Rest are kind of subpar. (I guess base is good but that might be nostalgia talking) lol

pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,xyzdorky,2,Sun May 17 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"Speaking strictly up to the neo series.  Politoed and Delibird.

pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,sangyuplee,3,Wed May 13 11:15:12 2015 UTC,"As an artist, I'd have to disagree. What that artist does is extremely well calculated and no average artist can imitate that style. I can see where you're coming from but it's actually really good art."
pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,xyzdorky,1 point,Wed May 13 21:21:21 2015 UTC,To explain what I meant. I wish there was a ken sugimori style art of those pokemon. Something more a kin to the rest of the series.  Basically I wish they made two different artworks of the pokemon.  Both of them look out of place next to the rest.
pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,thesilentchief,1 point,Wed May 13 21:37:04 2015 UTC,Can definitely see your point. The Politoed always caught my eye though because the card has such nice colouring.
pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,DoctorBulgrave,1 point,Wed May 13 13:03:17 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. Most of the rares from Neo Destiny look awful (Dark Slowking?). Luckily most of the holos look great, ignoring Dark Gengar. Disagree on Politoed; I always liked that one."
pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,wantonviolins,1 point,Sun May 17 03:26:51 2015 UTC,"Any Pokemon from the first two gens that didn't get classic-style Ken Sugimori artwork. They stopped using this art after the Neo sets, and a number of Pokemon never got to use it on a TCG card. Examples include Aerodactyl, Pupitar, and Ursaring (though at least Aerodactyl's old-school Sugimori art was used a lot for booster packs and promotional materials when the Fossil set released)."
pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,thesilentchief,1 point,Wed May 13 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"I much preferred his original works (in the Gym sets, for example) to the stock artwork he produced. Sugimori was great with dynamic poses and creating cool looking scenes, it's a shame there wasn't more of that in the TCG."
pkmntcgcollections,35t2rh,ChicaSkas,1 point,Fri May 15 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"Disagree: Mitsuhiro Arita was easily as good as Sugimori. Many of the classic cards, including none other than Charizard itself, were Arita cards.  I see where you're going though: classic Sugimori art is almost unbeatable. That almost watercolor quality is unmistakable."
pkmntcgcollections,35t1ss,zintix1,1 point,Wed May 13 07:13:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what you're meaning, but the original sets were printed by Wizards of the Coast and had 1st edition print runs and unlimited print runs. The 1st edition print runs are almost exclusively more expensive and rarer than the unlimited ones, and you can find them on sites such as eBay.  Or are you instead meaning the original Base Set and the Base Set 2? BS2 was a reprint run and contained reprints of a lot of cards from BS and a couple of other earlier sets. In any case, neither of these two sets are being printed, and they haven't been printed for many years. Again, you'll have to look online on sites such as eBay if you're trying to find specific cards. Alternatively, you can head over to /r/pkmntcgtrades if you've pinned down exactly what you're looking for.  Hope that helped. :)"
pkmntcgcollections,35t1ss,Sage_Wolf,1 point,Wed May 13 08:10:49 2015 UTC,I think I'm referring to the original base set (just google it and I can confirm)  Shame about the no reprints being made :( Guess this is going to hurt the wallet  Thanks again for the info :)

If you're not picky and if you're patient then you should easily be able to nab the commons and commons for Base Set well under $20. I know I've personally sold my near complete Base set C/UCs for around $8(5+3 shipping) and that was 60 cards.   Now as for the holos... Yeah, good luck with that."

pkmntcgcollections,35t1ss,DoctorBulgrave,1 point,Wed May 13 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"I would NOT bid on that item.  Based on the thumbnail pics many of those cards have the ""2"" symbol that shows they're from Base Set 2.  Base Set 2 is a true reprint of the original Base Set, and included the Fossil and Jungle sets as well.   Based on the fact that it's a reprint the cards are not as rare and not as valuable. You don't see many people trying to collect all of Base Set 2!   If all you want is the cards to look at, then you can save a lot of money by going for Base Set 2, it just might be harder to find them. If you want this to be a valuable collector's item, you should really make sure you're only getting cards from Base Set. You can tell if they're from the original Base Set if there's no symbol by the bottom right corner of the artwork."
pkmntcgcollections,35t1ss,ChicaSkas,1 point,Wed May 13 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"They actually did reprint some of the oldest cards one more time in the form of the Legendary Collection around 2002. That set is a mix of cards from Base, Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket, the first four sets. Unfortunately, that set is over 12 years old and is just as out of print as the others. But yeah, the cards are fairly easy to find in places like eBay because Pokemania was at its height, so a LOT of cards were printed (as opposed to the GSC and RSE era sets, which are harder to find despite being newer because fewer cards were printed). You'll find a lot of people (me included) who collected early, then left for years before coming back, which shows that demand for cards took a dive in the 2000s.  Also, for the record, Base Set 2 only has Base and Jungle reprints - despite some articles that talked about it before it released that I remember reading claiming otherwise, there are no Fossil cards in that set."

pkmntcgcollections,35pgp7,The_Strict_Nein,2,Tue May 12 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"You'd think if they made toploaders, UltraPro would also make sleeves for them too rather than expect them to go into boxes"
pkmntcgcollections,35pgp7,PolarBlue,1 point,Tue May 12 13:22:25 2015 UTC,"What I use are the 4 pocket pages from Ultra Pro or BCW. It's only 4 cards on a page and they can move/fall out if you turn the binder upside down, but I think it works all right. Haven't found a more economical way of displaying them."
pkmntcgcollections,35pgp7,PolarBlue,1 point,Tue May 12 19:25:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will give this a go. You could put a small piece of clear tape over the top of each pocket? I mean if they're in toploaders and folders they aren't the sort of cards you wanna take out often so tape shouldn't be much of an inconvenience I imagine"
pkmntcgcollections,35pgp7,errantdog,1 point,Tue May 12 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"That's certainly one way to prevent them falling out, though I don't think I would like the slightly obstructed view caused by the tape lol.

pkmntcgcollections,35nt6g,HaHaHawaii,3,Tue May 12 00:48:08 2015 UTC,"The price of everything ever is a matter of supply vs. demand. There's roughly the same supply of (Mega) Rayquaza and Shaymin. Those crazy Colorless Rayquaza decks want four of each, while other decks want some Shaymin but no Rayquaza. More demand for Shaymin means higher prices for Shaymin."
pkmntcgcollections,35nt6g,Asclepius24,2,Tue May 12 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say supply and demand too. I buy cards purely for collecting, artwork and rarity. Their usefulness in competitive play is something I've never even considered."
pkmntcgcollections,35nt6g,JDismyfriend,1 point,Tue May 12 21:11:15 2015 UTC,How good they are for competitive play.
pkmntcgcollections,35nt6g,FourMakesTwoUNLESS,1 point,Tue May 12 00:50:40 2015 UTC,"Is Shaymin really a leader of this set though? It has a decent ability and relatively low health, but I guess the ability to return the card to your hand for low energy cost is valuable."
pkmntcgcollections,35nt6g,errantdog,4,Tue May 12 00:52:54 2015 UTC,"It has an incredible ability that will help offset the loss of Jirachi EX and N in future formats (though maybe not the very next rotation). It can also be splashed into any deck as a consistency card, whereas Rayquaza is an attacker for a specific kind of deck.   That being said, I think the prices will come down a bit."
pkmntcgcollections,35nt6g,CptSpaceToaster,1 point,Tue May 12 00:58:08 2015 UTC,"Hi, came in from /r/Pkmntcg  To answer, Shaymin EX allows players to draw HUGE amounts of their 60 card deck in one turn.  When combined with cards like AZ, scoop-up-cyclone, and super-scoop-up, players can ultra-ball/sycamore their first turn, drop a Shaymin down, lay as many cards as they can, then pick-up the Shaymin, lay it down, draw MORE cards, and keep the cycle going!  it's crazy, but drawing and using ~30 cards turn 1 is now possible (especially with more than one Shaymin in your deck)  This astounding draw card is wanted by many, simply because the best decks use it to speed up and prepare, so everyone ELSE needs it to catch-up!  Watch this, ""about average"" first turn for this guy.  https://youtu.be/U-Gbt9DQlmk?t=885"

pkmntcgcollections,35nl42,wordskis,2,Tue May 12 05:06:14 2015 UTC,I've opened four of the nine packs so far. One rayquaza EX and a holo Togekiss
pkmntcgcollections,35nl42,ortizr93,1 point,Tue May 12 05:23:06 2015 UTC,Any particular reason? Would just buying one booster box not have got you more packs for less money? Or did you want storage and plenty of the Rayquaza sleeves?
pkmntcgcollections,35nl42,The_Strict_Nein,1 point,Tue May 12 19:18:34 2015 UTC,Well I collect many things and I love the actual boxes for the elite trainer boxes. I also really like the sleeves. You are correct though-- a booster box is a better deal. Also I only opened four because I don't have a lot of money right now so I'm trying to make those packs last. And then the extra 9th pack I'm saving for my sealed set of packs.

I recently swapped over to Japanese cards and by most standards they are cheaper (and far better quality). There are obviously exceptions to the rule though.

pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,OzEnigma2,1 point,Mon May 11 22:34:09 2015 UTC,A bit of both. Some cards are pretty expensive.
pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,ortizr93,1 point,Mon May 11 13:05:24 2015 UTC,"Do yourself a favour. Go list all the cards you would need. Then get prices from Troll and Toad on all of them, then search eBay for the cheapest sold listing on each. Have a look at the total and try not to faint. A lot of cards and a lot of cost."
pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,OzEnigma2,1 point,Mon May 11 13:08:42 2015 UTC,"Also depends if you want high quality cards that you'll just put in a binder, or if y wanna splash out and get psa 9 or 10s.  Japanese boxes are cheap as chips and fun to open (and lots more promos I don't think we get in FA) so I'd recommend them"
pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,ortizr93,3,Mon May 11 13:25:49 2015 UTC,If you want PSA 9's and 10's you are often best buying a MINT card and grading yourself I'm finding. Although there are several bargains to be found on eBay. =)  +1 for Japanese booster box openings. They are great!
pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Mon May 11 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the same. Many of my old cards must be at 9 or 10 level condition, I haven't got them out in years and they were always bought in mint condition from comic book shops or sleeved straight from packs. Most of the cards I see that people would say are a PSA 6 or 7, whatever 'Excellent' is, my dad would have never let me buy.  Only problem is it's a huge hassle being in the UK and wanting PSA grading."
pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,ortizr93,1 point,Mon May 11 15:26:42 2015 UTC,I could potentially help you out with PSA grading if you're interested. I've submitted before for other members that live outside of the US. PM me to discuss this further if you wish :)

pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,wordskis,1 point,Mon May 11 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"Like oz said, its quite expensive. The cheapest way to go about it would be to buy individual cards (instead of packs) and if possible buy in bulk to get discounts. If you are lucky, you can get a bunch on ebay for cheap this way.   Trying/r/pkmntcgtrades is also a great idea since ppl tend to sell cheaper than T&T."
pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Mon May 11 13:27:39 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it is definitely a pricey endeavor. But there is a very wide range of prices for different EX and Full Art cards, so you could start off with some cheaper ones and work your way up. For example, you can find full arts like Magnezone, Emolga, Skarmory, Malamar, Florges, Trevenant, etc, for all under $10 each. But then there are some like Genesect that are in the low $20 range, as well as some like Mewtwo that are in the $40 range."
pkmntcgcollections,35l9f0,Somedays92,1 point,Mon May 11 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why you stopped posting videos here... good to see you back! Trading any spare/unwanted cards you have can keep the costs down. Also, if it's within your budget, you might want to pick up a booster box, and then you can sell all the bulk, codes and singles you don't need (/so you can recover most if not all of the $ you spent)."

pkmntcgcollections,35fj9g,YahMoBeThere1,1 point,Sat May 9 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"I do have a long-term goal to get more of the higher tier Pikachus (Ghost Pikachu, Natta Wake Birthday Pikachu, 15th Anniversary FA Pikachu, Poketour, Pikachu * maybe). I'm not sure about the E3 pikachus. There are a few from other conventions and events (Pokemon Day, Comicon ... other things I am forgetting) that I might get sometime, but I'm only going to pick them up if I get a good deal. I'm a pretty patient collector who likes not spending money, haha."

pkmntcgcollections,35fkni,robzirra,3,Sat May 9 21:41:32 2015 UTC,Those are pretty incredible pulls. Much better than the box I opened last night...
pkmntcgcollections,35fkni,apretentioussnivy,1 point,Sat May 9 22:33:41 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that. Boxes are the better value but it can still be a huge gamble.
pkmntcgcollections,35fkni,apretentioussnivy,1 point,Sat May 9 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. I knew it was unlikely that I would return an equal ""value"" as to what I paid for it and I mostly got it for entertainment and novelty factor. Unfortunately, I ended up having a dreaded double Thundurus box with no megas. I also didnt pull pull any Latios or Shaymins which were the cards I wanted the most. At least I ended up with a secret rare (ES) and two full arts (Winona and Thundurus) so I cant be disappointed with the ratios (just the particular cards I pulled)."
pkmntcgcollections,35fkni,likeitsmaddie,1 point,Sat May 9 22:52:31 2015 UTC,I totally forgot that thunderus was I  the set so I was real pumped for the full art.

pkmntcgcollections,35fkni,likeitsmaddie,1 point,Sat May 9 22:19:42 2015 UTC,The secret rare was in the second to last pack I opened. It was the perfect ending to my raquaza party haha.
pkmntcgcollections,35fkni,likeitsmaddie,1 point,Sat May 9 22:23:21 2015 UTC,oh wow 0: that's awesome!! I really want a box of this set (maybe I'd get lucky to get a FA Winona T_T) but I have no money ha. I'm not incredibly lucky when it comes to pulling EX/FA/Secret Rares.
pkmntcgcollections,35fkni,MoneyDealer,2,Sat May 9 22:25:35 2015 UTC,I traded extras for three boxes. Check out the verbank Facebook page. Some people are still making the offer.

And I have four beautiful sky dragons out of it. :')  Though, I have to say that the cut quality on this set is worse than what I've seen from other recent sets. I looked though the commons/uncommons to find the best ones to put in my RS collection binder, and for a lot of them I was stuck between a perfectly-centered one with crimped corners and rough edges or a badly-centered one with clean edges. Yuck."
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,FlightXXII,1 point,Fri May 8 08:57:46 2015 UTC,"When you buy a box, are you  guaranteed getting the whole set? Like all 108 cards? I'm new to this so I'm just curious"
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,MyOldCollegeJavelin,2,Fri May 8 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"No, you will often be missing several of the rare cards and 1/2-3/4 or the exs available in the set. Most will net you 95% of the common/uncommons and trainer card though.  A box also allows for playsets of trainer cards and other useful pokemon in the set to be attained more easily."
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,FlightXXII,1 point,Fri May 8 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"Nice thanks for the reply, just bought a trainers box so I'm hoping I get some good pulls. I'm hoping to complete this series lol"
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,MyOldCollegeJavelin,2,Fri May 8 16:41:53 2015 UTC,did you buy an elite trainer box or a booster box? Because the elite trainer boxes contain even less of the set :p
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,FlightXXII,1 point,Fri May 8 16:49:28 2015 UTC,Fuuuuuuuuuuuu I got the elite trainer box on Amazon T_____T time to cancel my order!

pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,FlightXXII,1 point,Fri May 8 16:55:29 2015 UTC,What does the Elite trainer box usually come with? Just out of curiosity. Will I not get anything good with it? Because I thought it just came with 8 random booster packs
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,MyOldCollegeJavelin,2,Fri May 8 16:58:25 2015 UTC,"an elite trainer box comes with: 8 booster packs Card storage Box Separating inserts 6? Dice A Pack of 60 sleeves with the box design (ray, kyogre, groudon, etc) code for the box/sleeves online 5? or 6? of each energy type    I think that's just about the gist of what it comes with. The sleeves are usually a pretty cool item to have and the energy is nice if you dont have any. Boxes can also help with storage if you dont have any other suitable way"
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,FlightXXII,1 point,Fri May 8 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"Eh I'll keep it, I mean it's only 34 and I need some kind of storage. Hopefully I get some good cards if not I'll keep hunting for them."
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,Asclepius24,2,Fri May 8 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, I think I was lucky to get a whole seven ultra rares. That's only about half of the set's ultra rares, I think. I did get several sets of the commons and uncommons, though."
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,ortizr93,1 point,Fri May 8 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"I have my first box(es) coming in the mail and I can't wait. I played back when I was like... 10-14 and opened up a couple packs at a time. Ten-plus years later I finally decided to go for it. It feels like Christmas Eve waiting!  That's a great box with all the Rayquaza, and if nothing else the excitement is worth the extra premium you pay over the singles for sure :)"
pkmntcgcollections,359tz1,MyOldCollegeJavelin,1 point,Fri May 8 10:29:01 2015 UTC,"Since I'm going for a complete set, getting all of the commons and uncommons out of the way with some rares and ultra rares is definitely worth it. :)"

This also may sound weird but it also has a very 'Japanese' feel to it, not just the writing (obviously) but also the pokemon itself in particular and the artwork. Definitely a contributing factor for me."
pkmntcgcollections,355i5n,Xuzu,1 point,Thu May 7 09:42:20 2015 UTC,Is it possible to meet him?

That and I once saw a card up on ebay that was signed by him, just can't remember what pokemon it was. I do know that it wasn't holo, or even rare,  at least."
pkmntcgcollections,355i5n,MrIronGolem27,1 point,Thu May 7 19:45:39 2015 UTC,Sale/bid price?
pkmntcgcollections,355i5n,sangyuplee,1 point,Fri May 8 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"I dunno, it was a few weeks ago now. Think it was somewhere around $10-20 so not too bad. It was just that the card itself wasn't really impressive, which probably explains why I can't really remember it."
pkmntcgcollections,355i5n,sangyuplee,1 point,Fri May 8 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"I've seen a non-holo fossil kabutops signed by him on ebay. It went for quite the price.  I would personally go all out, purchase a PSA 10 first edition shadowless charizard, crack that thing open, and get it signed by him and never let that card go. haha good thing it'll never happen...  maybe even the venusaur and blastoise as well... my wallet just shuddered lol"
pkmntcgcollections,355i5n,acebren,2,Fri May 8 07:26:43 2015 UTC,It does beg the question of whether the card would retain it's value after being signed or not.
pkmntcgcollections,355i5n,sangyuplee,1 point,Fri May 8 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"PSA does have a separate autograph authentication thing that's not part of the grading system (if I'm not mistaken) As long as the signature could be authenticated and verified, I'm sure it's value would retain or have more value if kept at gem mint / mint condition! I doubt anyone would buy it though. Unless you're a Bill Gates that collects Pokemon cards. But as an artist/cartoonist, having that card for me would be so very important to me! :D"

I haven't bought an ETB since Furious Fists; but comparing this new one to my FuF box, they box quality seems lower, and for sure the card separators that come with it are a much lower quality (not to mention printed upside down).

I would suggest looking up each individual card on ebay and seeing what it's lowest available price sold and BIN would be. Then cross reference those with Troll and Toads prices that are available and, if you're trading in cash, probably 20-30% off the value that you come up with total would probably be a solid point for the both of you.

pkmntcgcollections,3522ji,UniversalOwnage,2,Wed May 6 13:33:43 2015 UTC,Not a lot of good stuff. Probably about 10-15 dollars
pkmntcgcollections,3522ji,aeoth,1 point,Wed May 6 16:17:35 2015 UTC,ILL BUY ALL OF YOUR UNKNOWNS
pkmntcgcollections,3522ji,xmoda,1 point,Wed May 6 17:45:14 2015 UTC,How much you reakon?
pkmntcgcollections,351atp,secretlypoisonpeople,3,Wed May 6 07:31:11 2015 UTC,"Ahh that's it, I'm out, you win! :P  Seriously though, if that's 3 complete rev-holo Legenary sets, 4 1st edition Neo Destiny and a stupid amount of shining cards and a PSA 1st edition shadowless Charizard to top it off... Sigh. Gief pls OP."
pkmntcgcollections,351atp,JDismyfriend,1 point,Wed May 6 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"Is that multiple complete Neo and Legendary Collection sets? My two favorite sets which I have been trying ages to find? This is where they were? In unlimited and first addition I think is excessive, but I understand, but multiples of each? I envy you sir."
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,NinjaDeathStrike,3,Tue May 5 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"That neo set is beautiful. I've always wanted to finish those sets, but my collection is seriously lacking for them. The shining Raichu is my favorite card hands down, still hoping to find one somewhere even if I never get any other Neo cards."
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,Tre2,1 point,Tue May 5 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel about the e-reader sets. I didn't include them because I still have too many gaps. I love the old sets mostly because of the hand drawn art. Some of the cg stuff looks decent, but I'm a sucker for the more classic style."
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,Tre2,1 point,Tue May 5 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"I never really played the ereader set, so I'm not a huge fan of it, but I certainly like the art and there is nothing wrong with the cards. They were the last cards that my brother and I did get and play with -- my dad got an entire booster box (after WOTC had already lost the license) on ebay for something like $25 dollars, it was an amazing deal. He got it since my brother and I had lost interest after we saw that new cards were way more powerful than our old cards, and didn't like that we couldn't get new cards that wouldn't make our old ones obsolete, but he still liked the game and wanted to play with us. We used that box of cards and still played, but didn't buy new ones after that."
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,Xuzu,1 point,Tue May 5 19:25:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't collecting during the e-reader sets either, but I think they have the best artwork in the entire game. Besides picking up the Crystals a few years ago though, I haven't been able to collect the whole set."
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,mattfeeder18,1 point,Tue May 5 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"That Raichu is my favourite too, it's a beauty!"
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,S1LV3RH00D,2,Wed May 6 01:12:38 2015 UTC,"Don't know if you know, but your Blastoise, Nidoking and Raichu from Base Set are all Shadowless editions - worth a lot more than usual!"
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,The_Strict_Nein,2,Tue May 5 21:23:33 2015 UTC,Glad to see your set make it here! Cheers!
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,The_Strict_Nein,2,Tue May 5 22:21:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip!
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,ortizr93,1 point,Tue May 5 22:22:44 2015 UTC,"Just thought I'd mention, the first set to have reverse holos was the Legendary Collection."
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,Sage_Wolf,1 point,Tue May 5 19:12:05 2015 UTC,Ah ok. I didn't collect any of it (since it was reprints). Were those the ones with the fancy firework pattern?
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,Xuzu,1 point,Tue May 5 19:15:25 2015 UTC,Yep
pkmntcgcollections,34ywwf,Xuzu,1 point,Tue May 5 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"Those crystal cards are beautiful. Sadly after I stopped collecting, and now that I'm thinking of starting again those are something I feel I definitely missed out on"
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,edgeorge92,2,Tue May 5 14:55:01 2015 UTC,Wait these are unopened!? I just started collecting and the things I see here are crazy. Where did you find these ????
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,FlightXXII,1 point,Tue May 5 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, all pictured are factory sealed... I find them all over the internet - forums, shops, auctions!"
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,FlightXXII,1 point,Tue May 5 15:56:48 2015 UTC,Damn... Can you share your favorite places to look?
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,xmoda,1 point,Tue May 5 16:00:25 2015 UTC,I tend to just Google like crazy. I have found that eBay can be super hit and miss so just search the name of a theme deck I am after and keep looking for them to appear!
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,xmoda,2,Tue May 5 21:37:23 2015 UTC,holy fucking shit what i would do for that azumarill theme deck
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,JDismyfriend,1 point,Tue May 5 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"If you are based in the US, they come up now and then. Trying to get them here in the UK was a nightmare...ended up importing and paying insane custom charges ;_;"
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,JDismyfriend,1 point,Tue May 5 16:49:49 2015 UTC,haha well atleast you got em! how many theme decks are there/ do you need?
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,Patriots_Fan,1 point,Tue May 5 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"How many theme decks are there   Generally there are usually between 2-4 per set, with earlier sets (Base Set - E-Series) having more theme decks per set than the 'newer' ones.    [How many] do you need?   All of them!   Truth be told, I am only really super interested in collecting all the themes of the WOTC theme decks. That would be pretty cool!"
pkmntcgcollections,34y3cg,acebren,1 point,Tue May 5 18:58:49 2015 UTC,Yeaaah WOTC <3
pkmntcgcollections,34xdav,DictatorMad,1 point,Tue May 5 10:20:46 2015 UTC,"Nice, I recently started to collect too. Going to just collect Secret Rares and Full Arts only."
pkmntcgcollections,34xdav,FullMetal187,1 point,Tue May 5 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"I have a binder for only FA,SR,and EX cards. Anda binder for everything else that's not an ultra rare but still a pretty cool pokemon card."

pkmntcgcollections,34xdav,errantdog,1 point,Wed May 6 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's from the pokemon center.com. And next time, I'll make a thread the right way. :P"
pkmntcgcollections,34xdav,cunzhep,1 point,Wed May 6 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"Here's the link to the album http://imgur.com/a/dpJ8x#0 I started collecting pokemon cards again, about almost a year ago, hopefully this year will bring me better luck on more full art cards."
pkmntcgcollections,34yz3r,cunzhep,2,Tue May 5 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, the most highly recommended tight fit sleeves are KMC Perfect Fit.  Several people report bending with Ultra Pro pro-fit sleeves."
pkmntcgcollections,34yz3r,The_Strict_Nein,1 point,Tue May 5 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"I've been using ultra pro premium sleeves, they fit perfectly into 9 card binder pages, and i can vouch that my cards have been in that combination for 4 years and dont show any bending"
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,SeemsPhishy,6,Mon May 4 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"Nice pull!  SO many people come on reddit to post the awesome shit they got in their ""first pack since childhood.""   It took me maybe 20 packs until I got ANYTHING of any value.  I had to turn pokemon cards into the hobby I only dreamed about as a child before I saw any returns on investment haha.   But anyways, now that you've gotten something of value are you hooked? Or was it just a nice distraction, and you have no desire to try again."
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,aqlno,1 point,Mon May 4 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"Part of me wants to end on a good note, but naturally I want to see if it could happen again :p"
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,ortizr93,6,Mon May 4 18:47:09 2015 UTC,They actually send spies out to follow former collectors to plant extra-good packs in a store when they think of relapsing to get them hooked back on Pokemon.
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,Aurabolt,5,Mon May 4 18:13:51 2015 UTC,Back in my day.. Charizard was red..
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,Kennaay1891,1 point,Tue May 5 01:52:23 2015 UTC,Hahahaha I feel you man.
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,detective_iii,3,Tue May 5 02:25:32 2015 UTC,How's it feel to be officially hooked again? =P
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,xmoda,2,Mon May 4 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"Weirdly the exact thing happened to me a few months ago, except I got a Mega Charizard Y in my first pack. Since then, I've opened countless packs and now harbour a collection of close to 30 EX's and Ultra-Rares :D"
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,primase,2,Mon May 4 18:42:13 2015 UTC,seems like you pulled better then your childhood?
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,alcaponesuite,2,Mon May 4 18:44:44 2015 UTC,I envy you so much right NOW! You know how long I've been looking for Flashfire boosters and both megas.
pkmntcgcollections,34ueii,DictatorMad,2,Tue May 5 00:43:15 2015 UTC,"When I started collecting again I bought a tin (comes with 4 packs), 2nd or 3rd pack was a Mewtwo EX. Bought like a 100 packs since."
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,recket,3,Mon May 4 17:55:12 2015 UTC,Flareon from the Jungle set. Hands down my favorite card. http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Flareon_%28Jungle_3%29
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Tue May 5 02:04:46 2015 UTC,"I love this card, it was in the first jungle pack I ever bought as a kid. What do you think about the Jungle Jolteon and Vaporeon?"
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,SLAMpert,1 point,Tue May 5 02:59:16 2015 UTC,I like them as well but that Flareon will have a special place in my heart.
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,secretlypoisonpeople,2,Tue May 5 03:11:08 2015 UTC,"Swampert from EX Ruby and Sapphire (reverse holo). Favourite Pokemon. Gift from girlfriend. Reverse holo pattern looks great.  Deoxys EX from Plasma Freeze (full art). Tried really hard to get this one. Love Deoxys and the artwork.  Vaporeon from Jungle. My first ever holo.  Venusaur EX from XY (full art). I love the colour of the background.  Those are a few that crossed my mind straight away. I also love Secret Rare Garchomp (Plasma Freeze), Latios Gold Star (EX Deoxys), and Full Art Toxicroak EX (Flash Fire), but I don't own those, unfortunately."
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,Stick636,1 point,Mon May 4 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that Swampert is awesome, and I hadn't seen it before.   I'm with you on the Latios Gold Start, and the rest of the gold stars for that matter."
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,Crimzonlogic,2,Mon May 4 19:18:05 2015 UTC,"Rising Rivals Arcanine is my favorite card-art of arcanine. It looks so fierce and the rich green holo background is a beautiful contrast. Light Arcanine is runner up. It's cute.  Dark Charmeleon because it just looks so badass.  Base Set Dragonair is still one of the most beautiful cards I've seen. Mine is in terrible shape, though. The top half of the back is peeled off. :(  Ho-Oh Legend was pulled from back-to-back boosters bought on a whim years after I stopped collecting cards. That felt incredible. I bought a few more packs of HGSS and got more good pulls but somehow I didn't start collecting anymore then. I waited until this year to start back up with Flashfire.  Charmander EX Dragon Secret Rare was the first Secret Rare card I ever pulled from a Booster Pack, and as a kid it made me so excited. This is a rare treasure, mom! How are you not as excited as I am?!?!  Secret Rare M Charizard Y EX was a very lucky pull from about 15-20 boosters bought sporadically at a local Gamestop. I wasn't going to collect the secret rares from Flashfire but this card forced my hand. Now I have to get the other two. XD  EX Dragon Holo Golem is an awesome one. It looks so confident and tough, and the holo background is very bright and golden.   Base Set Nidorino is a childhood favorite. It looks really cool.  Dark Jolteon Same as above.  Images pulled from google because I am lazy right now."
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,Crimzonlogic,1 point,Mon May 4 23:34:12 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty fantastic story about your Ho-Oh Legend, man that must have been cool. Out of curiosity, do you run a fire deck?"
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,errantdog,2,Tue May 5 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't built a deck since I was a kid. I would like to, but I'd have no one to play with. I would definitely make a fire deck. Fire types are my favorites."
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,ScarySwampert,2,Tue May 5 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"As a rabid Magikarp collector, I have to say that the Skyridge and First Ed. Base Set (seriously, the colours are more vivid!) prints are my favourites.   My favourites from my own collection are Shining Kabutops and Raichu, Lily Pad Mew, the Dark Gengar line, the Light Machamp line, this Raichu from the Bulbasaur starter deck, all of the Warm Pikachus, and the Polish Pikachu from the World Collection."
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,xmoda,2,Tue May 5 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"Dark Charizard from rocket. When I was a kid my friends down the street had one. I wanted it soooo bad, and I finally got one on /r/pkmntcgtrades. It's really just due to nostalgia, but I love that card like no other."
pkmntcgcollections,34uizr,xmoda,1 point,Wed May 6 02:06:42 2015 UTC,i just started pokemon again so here are a few (i dont know much after the 2nd gen)   Ninetails base set - http://serebii.net/card/base/12.jpg  Dark Ampharos - http://serebii.net/card/neodestiny/1.jpg   Shining Tyranitar - http://serebii.net/card/neodestiny/113.jpg  Houndoom  my absolute favorite growing up - http://serebii.net/card/neorevelation/8.jpg  Flaffy! http://serebii.net/card/expedition/077.shtml
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,fapattick,2,Sun May 3 19:41:44 2015 UTC,Legendary collection is my favorite set by far! But man do those rare reverse holos get expensive.
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,ad925,2,Sun May 3 20:12:47 2015 UTC,they sure do...
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,xmoda,2,Sun May 3 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"Are they? I think I only have one card like that, and its a dark dragonite"
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,DictatorMad,2,Sun May 3 21:32:45 2015 UTC,how much?
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,xmoda,2,Mon May 4 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure, I gotta dig out my old binder of cards, I running out of room to keep all these cards."
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,DictatorMad,1 point,Mon May 4 02:32:29 2015 UTC,Are the reverse holo's that rare? i have like 20/30+ ? or so of them from years ago... maybe i should dig em out and give em a look through to see what i've got.
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,Lightalife,1 point,Mon May 4 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"Some are, like the legendary birds and the starters. Let me know if you find them because I would be real interested in trading/buying!"
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,ad925,1 point,Mon May 4 05:16:39 2015 UTC,"I'll check and let you know. I know i have a venasaur, dark blastoise and maybe a pidgiot, but after that there's just too many to remember."
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,Lightalife,1 point,Mon May 4 12:03:19 2015 UTC,"Not really sure if I'm interested in selling but I have: charizard, dark blastoise, muk, venusaur, hypno, kabutops, mewtwo, moltres, nidoqueen, pidgeot, arcanine, dark dragonair, dewgong, golduck, omanyte, seadra, bulbasaur, geodude, machop, pikachu, rattata, slowbro, spear ow, and the mysterious fossil.   More than I remembered for sure."
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,Lightalife,1 point,Wed May 6 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"Oh i have some for trade too, pm me if you like to work out a deal or at least see what i have"
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,ad925,1 point,Wed May 6 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've spent the past week or so on and off sorting through everything and getting them in numerical order. I'm almost done sorting through them and then I'm probably going to make a monster post here asking if anyone wants to do trades etc. But before then I'll send you a pm ahead of time :)   Heck, i'm coming to realize i also have a decent handful of basic shadowless cards. Dratini, growlithe, diglette, dugtrio, dewgong, haunter to mention just a few. No holo's, but quite a few 2nd stages and tons of 1st stages."
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,Lightalife,1 point,Wed May 6 03:05:42 2015 UTC,Nice! I cant wait :)
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,ad925,1 point,Wed May 6 14:16:52 2015 UTC,You sorted the cards?
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,ad925,2,Mon May 11 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"Reverse holo set are around 8-900.00. A master set will run you around 1,200-1,300.00. That is if you can find any, they are extremely rare."
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Mon May 4 00:23:56 2015 UTC,I have this exact card! I agree though. That holo style is sweet but it kinda hurts to look at
pkmntcgcollections,34qvb5,Dro24,1 point,Sun May 3 22:58:28 2015 UTC,And I'm just sitting here with my reverse holo LC Slowpoke :)
pkmntcgcollections,34ppnn,JDismyfriend,3,Sun May 3 13:05:06 2015 UTC,No surfing pikachu? This is amazing though. Nice cards.

pkmntcgcollections,34ppnn,xmoda,2,Sun May 3 13:06:06 2015 UTC,nice set those little circles on the sleeves piss me off though lol and damn i was looking at southern islands binders and they are all like $150 :(
pkmntcgcollections,34ppnn,schulgi,2,Sun May 3 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's a sign of quality protection from Ultrapro! The sealed binder is nice, but includes 3 booster packs too, which is why it's so much. Buy a mint set of the loose cards for much cheaper :)"
pkmntcgcollections,34ppnn,secretlypoisonpeople,2,Sun May 3 17:02:14 2015 UTC,yeah ill probably do that

pkmntcgcollections,34n9j5,EpilepticWaffle,1 point,Sat May 2 21:28:30 2015 UTC,I only have around half haha. Looking for them in psa 9/10 condition so it's slow going

I have a bunch (I think 15 or so) of them and I buy them whenever I see ones I don't have if I can spare the money. I don't really care for condition as some of the cards are ones I had when I was a kid and they aren't in the best of shape and I just want them for nostalgia. That being said I always go for mint if I have the choice  EDIT: nvm, I have 27. Still a long way to go."

pkmntcgcollections,34n9j5,Stick636,1 point,Sat May 2 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"People still do, but not as often as I had hoped. I currently have 108/156 ex cards (including promos), and it's becoming increasingly harder to trade for ex rather than buying them."
pkmntcgcollections,34n9j5,EpilepticWaffle,3,Sat May 2 21:25:42 2015 UTC,Shit…there's 156 old-school ex cards?
pkmntcgcollections,34n9j5,wordskis,2,Sat May 2 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"I actually miscounted. There are 157 including promos. I believe there are 12 promos if you get both hold and non hold versions of the card, as well as the two promo box toppers from TRR."
pkmntcgcollections,34n9j5,EpilepticWaffle,1 point,Sat May 2 23:31:11 2015 UTC,"Dammit. I was planning to eventually collect all old-school ex's. I had no idea there was 157 haha. I knew it would take awhile, but to do it cost-effectively will take years"

I have a moderately successful YouTube channel, which helped me to get my gold star set completed, as well as start the ex series. Try making one yourself, and you could get some great tips trades.   Also try to attend events, like prereleases, near you, as there are always collectors around them."
pkmntcgcollections,34n9j5,EpilepticWaffle,1 point,Sun May 3 07:02:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the aspect of finding them isn't the difficult part, I've gotten about 10 or so from various reddit trades, and another 20 or so from auction-style ebay lots that I got great deals on. It's just a matter of money mainly, because although I have some cards for trade, I have other wants in addition to old-school ex's, so it's always a tough decision in regards to what I want to trade for."

pkmntcgcollections,34j9f8,matubula,1 point,Fri May 1 16:56:10 2015 UTC,I was in that boat once. It took YEARS for some Neo Destiny packs to show up on eBay and the like. I couldn't find a Japanese pack for my collection anywhere. But someone must've opened up some boxes because suddenly at one point they just started showing up for like $20.
pkmntcgcollections,34j9f8,b2damaxx,1 point,Fri May 1 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the reality check. A few sold on US ebay earlier this month for $35, I've yet to see any in the UK, but I've only been looking for a month or so now.  How do you feel about the potential for a shining to be in your sealed ones?"
pkmntcgcollections,34j9f8,xmoda,1 point,Fri May 1 18:58:39 2015 UTC,i wouldnt hold your breath on shinings man better off buying them straight id say
pkmntcgcollections,34j9f8,xmoda,1 point,Fri May 1 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not getting them specifically for the shinings, mainly for the enjoyment of opening them and adding to my collection. But obviously it would be awesome to pull one. I read on bulbapedia that they were like 1 in 300 packs, don't how accurate that is though."
pkmntcgcollections,34j9f8,b2damaxx,1 point,Fri May 1 19:08:45 2015 UTC,1/300 doesnt seem right but i dont know espeically for the japanese version

pkmntcgcollections,34g98v,secretlypoisonpeople,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:04:37 2015 UTC,whats wrong with these cards
pkmntcgcollections,34g98v,dj_dad_dick,6,Thu Apr 30 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"They all seem to have /u/secretlypoisonpeople printed across them, a common error in the early WOTC sets from 1998."

pkmntcgcollections,34g98v,xRacoon,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:39:45 2015 UTC,"Surprised no one else has answered your question already. The Nintetails is missing the damage for the move Fire Blast and the Blastoise doesn't have the word ""stage"" at the top right of the card. Can't say I've ever seen one of those Ninetails in such good condition, I've only seen some beat-up ones. Both cards are pretty expensive but Ninetails beats Blastoise by a mile."

pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,Xuzu,4,Wed Apr 29 20:58:51 2015 UTC,Wow. Just wow.
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,ReverESP,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:24:16 2015 UTC,I have the other half of the collection and looking for these cards:/  but yours are 1st edition psa 10. Mine are unlimited non graded.  Shining charizard is going to be a pretty penny if you want to keep him matched with these guys.
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,xyzdorky,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:49:41 2015 UTC,Is it hard to get 10s?
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,alcaponesuite,2,Thu Apr 30 04:25:54 2015 UTC,"The older the card the harder it is to find. 10's are considered flawless card's perfect cut, perfect alignment, no scratches, wrinkles, bends.  9's are common and are considered near perfect. And to the untrained eye, usually are.  The older the card and the rarer the card the harder it to find a 10 because these cards were made for children and were intended to be played.  Card sleeves weren't the first priority on a 7 year olds mind when he opened a shining charizard out of the pack. He went and threw it into the pile of cards that was his deck and challenged his friend to a match. Shuffled the cards absent mindedly. Ultimately putting wear on it.    The people who grade the cards have also graded cards straight out of the press and found imperfections. So imagine how hard it is to find a low run card 15 years old that was handled by 7 year olds.  The only ones that are 10's now, were when adults with half a mind to protect it and put it away or the ones that are opened from packs today, that were also saved from back in the day."
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,xyzdorky,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:36:49 2015 UTC,"Its hard to get a 10, people sometimes pull a shiny and send it directly to PSA and only get a 8 or 9 on it. So apparently back then the production of pokemon cards was not as precise as it is today"
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,Almedinz,1 point,Fri May 1 01:19:17 2015 UTC,"Tell me about it! I have one that's ungraded that I'm very tempted to get done, I think it could be a 10 - would save me a lot of money if so!"
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,xyzdorky,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:56:44 2015 UTC,"Over $1,000 for sure. The one I got was from a goodwill ebay seller.  Had it at $71 until the last 15min when some bid $90 and my automatic bid challenged it.  I was irritated about that, can't imagine having a full shining collection all 1st edition psa 10 except for charizard.  Get it graded. If its a 9 you could try auctioning it so you can get the psa 10 with a little more cash on top."
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,Acadiaa,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:04:04 2015 UTC,"I was apprehensive as if it wasn't a 10 I'd have to buy a new one for my ungraded set and still a 10, but as you say if it was a 9 it could go some way to funding a 10 so perhaps not a bad idea. I'm in no rush to get them, will see whatever comes my way. :)"
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,xmoda,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:15:48 2015 UTC,Looks expensive

pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,JDismyfriend,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:14:33 2015 UTC,Bought them already graded!
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,sumtingiswong,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:57:15 2015 UTC,How much were they? I'm curious on the price of 1st shining cards.
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,ortizr93,2,Thu Apr 30 06:00:12 2015 UTC,You can see what they're worth by searching them on eBay and ticking the 'sold listings' box.
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,sumtingiswong,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:02:34 2015 UTC,Answer: Too much :P
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,xmoda,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:57:48 2015 UTC,Certainly not cheap. :)
pkmntcgcollections,34bjkl,xmoda,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"I have a full shining set on the way back from PSA as we speak. Unfortunately just unlimited editions. All are 9 except charizard, kabutops and raichu, which are 10s. Any interest in unlimited versions?"

pkmntcgcollections,349am0,sufunew,2,Wed Apr 29 09:15:52 2015 UTC,A near mint condition one went for $77 the other day on eBay and that's pretty low. I've seen them go for above $150 in pristine condition

pkmntcgcollections,34444p,Sage_Wolf,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"When Im looking to buy a really rare card, I scour the forums and see what other people have paid for it. The condition is key. Mint can go for 1500 - 2000. The one on ebay right now is not in very good conditon. I made him an offer for 700 and he wouldn't take it. Most unikarps are in not in great condition. This is in part because they were given to young kids and in part because of the way the cards were stored. I think for most unikarps, 1000 is the right range to be in with some variance for condition. I have a feeling someone will buy that guy's card for pretty close to his asking price."
pkmntcgcollections,34444p,paul_123,6,Tue Apr 28 06:04:48 2015 UTC,"I guess I should add that the reason even poor condition unikarps can command a high price is that only 30-100 were ever printed, making it one of the rarest pokemon cards in the world."
pkmntcgcollections,34444p,rawrenross,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:09:17 2015 UTC,I find it ironic that one of the most common Pokemon in the game is the rarest Pokemon card ever made :)

pkmntcgcollections,33yfrc,RDM2120,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:05:46 2015 UTC,How does someone get pre-release cards? Just asking.
pkmntcgcollections,33yfrc,DictatorMad,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:13:49 2015 UTC,"Check comic book stores and game shops in your area for sanctioned pre-release events a little over a week before a new set is released. Sets are staggered about once every 3 months so you have a little time in advance to plan for the next one if you want.    They're pretty cool and worth the money. They always have a special promotional card, along with 8 packs for $30. You get to play 3 matches and play more and trade if you wanna stick around.    Some host locations also offer raffle prizes such as Play Pokemon exclusive sleeves, deck boxes, and sometimes gift cards to the shop of where the event is held."

I'd recommend to go try one out at least once, they're a lot of fun.    https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-events/15-05-000109/"
