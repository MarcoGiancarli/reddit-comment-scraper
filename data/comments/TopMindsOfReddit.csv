A lot dick Redditors say stuff like Voat is full of FPHers and people butthurt because Reddit didn't have a jailbait, but that's doesn't stand out to me over there, the con theorists do.   Hmmm, I guess I'll add that it looks to me like propagandists are kinda having their way on some parts of Voat right now.   There's a guy who was a long time anti Israel propagandist on Reddit that was recently banned from Reddit. So I made some comments about him in an old thread, and it looks like that comment is being brigaded.   There was a huge anti GMO post on the front page yesterday, and I'm seeing some strange voting patterns, ones I used to see on Reddit many many years ago.   For example, pro GMO comments seem to get a downvote for every single upvote. I used to see that on Reddit a lot. I'm not sure whether it's a script, or people with multiple accounts.   Maybe Voat doesn't have what Reddit developed to combat that sort of thing, IDK, I'm not an IT nerd."

TopMindsOfReddit,3e0h4k,ttumblrbots,3,Tue Jul 21 00:33:17 2015 UTC,"If the earth is flat, then a whole lot of developers are wasting their time accounting for curvature in mapping software. For instance, say you have a database of locations, and you want to get all hits within an x mile radius of a given position. If x is within a single city or region, then things are relatively easy. But if x covers continental distances, you'll need to project your geometry on a curved globe. As an example, PostGIS has this to say:    If your data is contained in a small area, you might find that choosing an appropriate projection and using GEOMETRY is the best solution, in terms of performance and functionality available. If your data is global or covers a continental region, you may find that GEOGRAPHY allows you to build a system without having to worry about projection details. You store your data in longitude/latitude, and use the functions that have been defined on GEOGRAPHY. If you don't understand projections, and you don't want to learn about them, and you're prepared to accept the limitations in functionality available in GEOGRAPHY, then it might be easier for you to use GEOGRAPHY than GEOMETRY. Simply load your data up as longitude/latitude and go from there.    Companies make billions of dollars off this sort of thing, and hire smart people to come up with solutions to this complicated problem. If the Earth is flat, they would be wasting money and effort to get the wrong answer."

The post he distinguished as mod listing 24 users to harass.  The comment with his justification message he got.  The ""proof"" this is real on is a forum showing that the user saying this is a 2 day old account.    For anyone who happens to be new this user is a high level top mind.

It's honestly refreshing to come to /r/conspiracy[2] and see support for conflicting views, and have it remain an open forum for ""alternative"" discussion, despite the recent decline in free speech on reddit.   As long as that discussion aligns itself with the hive mind. Otherwise, you are a JTIRG shill and will be banned.

I'm not suggesting it's perfect, but it's certainly my most trusted ally on reddit,    ""...Because you guys say things that line up with my particular flavor of batshit insanity.""   and despite the infiltrators...

TopMindsOfReddit,3do91d,ForgedIronMadeIt,56,Fri Jul 17 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"I'll be extremely surprised if anything comes of it. My assumption is Reddit Inc. will continue to claim it's just individual users and a modding issue, and will tell /r/blackladies to fuck off just like they did last time. Hey, maybe they'll shadowban the rest of their mods as well for good measure.  Short of the mods of /r/coontown changing the sidebar to read ""We literally want to murder black people. Seriously, we really do, here's a signed affidavit of our intent to commit multiple first-degree murders."", /u/spez will continue to be a spineless coward and explain away the filth he's hosting as harmless ""dislike"", and reddit's stance against harrassment enabled by their platform will remain the complete joke it always has been.  ""Keep everyone safe"", especially the precious racists who clearly need Reddit Inc.'s support and protection the most. Wouldn't want the poor bigots to ""conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation"", after all. Fuck black people, though."

I don't think the people at reddit HQ sit around thinking up ways to enable racists, but I do think that they have a hard time keeping up with everything.  They do not have enough staff to really monitor much of anything given the size of the site, and they do not have enough cash flow to be able to hire more.  The shit storm that happened when FPH went down was bad (though I don't see it happening again with CT since they are so clearly despicable).

TopMindsOfReddit,3do91d,DoBetterReddit,3,Sat Jul 18 01:36:50 2015 UTC,Subsidize?  What do you mean by that?
TopMindsOfReddit,3do91d,ForgedIronMadeIt,23,Sat Jul 18 01:45:07 2015 UTC,Ads aren't shown on the sub anymore. This means that reddit can claim that they aren't making money off of the sub. It also means that the company is now effectively subsidizing the sub's existence.
TopMindsOfReddit,3do91d,NewMerril,6,Sat Jul 18 01:55:24 2015 UTC,"That's... odd.  On the one hand, yeah, they're no longer making ad money off of it.  (What advertiser wants to be associated with that, though?  I remember SomethingAwful having hard times with ads back in the day -- not that SA is remotely like CT.)  But the users get the big win of not having to see ads.  Insane."
TopMindsOfReddit,3do91d,ForgedIronMadeIt,5,Sat Jul 18 02:50:15 2015 UTC,The fact they are getting subsidized is also not only funny because they hate black people on welfare but also because it gives Reddit users another reason to rally against them.

This isn't about some random obfuscated FPH sub with twelve subscribers that they might have overlooked.  /r/coontown is over 7 months old, had half a million uniques last month, and probably rivals Stormfront as one of the largest organized racist communities on the internet. Everyone on reddit has heard of it and their content and behavior has been reported to the admins countless times. Even if they somehow managed to remain ignorant about it until now, yesterday /r/coontown had the honor to receive the official Steve Huffman Seal of Approval.  The macabre thing about this whole ""reclassification"" scheme is that reddit is explicitly saying: Yes, we know it exists, we know its filth, we're making a big list of all of them, and we're happy to offer them our platform. Ad-free, even."

Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:   [/r/oppression] /r/TopMindsofReddit moderators use a sticky post to state that a racist user is an alt of a well-known reddit account of a real person. This false association has real-world consequences for the victim leading them to fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.   If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads. (Info / Contact)"

TopMindsOfReddit,3dnzjm,Spooky_Ghost_AMA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"real-world consequences for the victim leading them to fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.   A racist redditor who may be mentally ill has 2 reddit accounts or more.  THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.  If only he could go into the Witness Protection Program to escape the /r/TopMindsofReddit assassination attempts. Sadly, as /r/conspiracy and TMOR both know, the program is just a ploy to lure witnesses in to murder them."
