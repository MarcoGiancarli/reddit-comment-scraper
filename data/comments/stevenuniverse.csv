stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Lord_Cownostril,64,Mon Jul 20 14:02:36 2015 UTC,Well there's this.
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,off-and-on,20,Mon Jul 20 15:16:54 2015 UTC,Aaaaaaand I love you.
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,McRibbles,17,Mon Jul 20 15:43:36 2015 UTC,Steven and Connie flair relevance?  I ship it.
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,clovens,19,Mon Jul 20 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"Starry-eyed Garnet, ahaha"
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Scouterfly,5,Mon Jul 20 17:11:16 2015 UTC,THAT STARRY-EYED ONE OH MY GOD  THAT'S ADORABLE
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,thenacho1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:19 2015 UTC,And yet still nobody's had the idea to do one of Garnet's expression in Alone Together?
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,MurfDurfWurf,44,Mon Jul 20 20:26:01 2015 UTC,No but garnet looks much less intimidating without her shades
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,off-and-on,43,Mon Jul 20 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"She looks much more emotional, which is good in it's own way."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Narflarg,12,Mon Jul 20 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"For me the magic of garnet is that she always looks emotionally uninvolved. Like a meteor of space stuff smashes into the ground, and transforms into a cat that needs a third of her spine to save the world and she just says Yes."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Mythiiical,18,Mon Jul 20 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"I think we lose a lot of who Garnet is with the glasses, to be honest."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,MurfDurfWurf,41,Mon Jul 20 15:51:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like the shades help Garnet keep a calm, stoic look, which she needs to uphold to keep Pearl and Amethyst morale high.  Without the shades it's easier to see her panicking, confused, or uncertain"
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Mythiiical,12,Mon Jul 20 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"Very true. Garnet sans glasses would be better for us the viewers, but not for the Crystal Gems."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,bros_pm_me_ur_asspix,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"frickin ruby causing internal panic, i wanna see some sapphire / rose or sapphire / amethyst fusions"
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,CeciliaMiles,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"Less intimidating, more personality."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,dragon567,16,Mon Jul 20 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"I like her with and without glasses, to be honest. The glasses fit her outward personality better (plus I'm used to them now..) but without them it's a lot easier to see her emotions. Which she really needs more of in my opinion."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,empathybox,9,Mon Jul 20 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, I did these. There's a bunch on tumblr if you search Garnet edits though!"
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,EdgyMemeLord,6,Mon Jul 20 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Do you have more? You seem to be the best at mimicking the style and making sure the quality of the eyes match that if the rest of the image. Other edits have high res eyes and a low res Garnet, whereas your eyes match.   I love all of them of course, but yours are my favorite. You should really keep them going.   Bonus points if you edit every one of Garnet's animation frames in every episode. You'd be the GOAT for sure."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Sadi_Reddit,3,Mon Jul 20 17:53:26 2015 UTC,I sure hope that's alot of bonus points...
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,AbsoluteDiscord,5,Mon Jul 20 19:47:47 2015 UTC,One day in the future she wont be needing the glasses anymore... someday.
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,hinata2000100,5,Mon Jul 20 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"I really want to see an episode dedicated around Steven trying to find Garnets shades, so we can get a whole episode of her expressions."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Truck_Thunders,10,Mon Jul 20 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"Sadly, that can't happen, because Garnet can't lose her shades. If they go missing, she can just snap a new pair onto her eyes.  But then again, anything's possible if you believe hard enough."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,RealBillWatterson,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:27 2015 UTC,I wanted to know what she looked like as a cyclops
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,alecksmugino,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:03 2015 UTC,Wow these are really well-done.
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,DenryuRocket110,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:59 2015 UTC,...I actually like her much better this way.
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,saundersaur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:37 2015 UTC,I get the feeling Garnet's top eye is a fusion of Ruby's left eye and Sapphire's inner-eye.
