peeling,3dov4b,cozyghost,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:37 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to ask how you guys walk on this for 4-5 days at a time. I assume socks and sneakers are best so people don't see your weird peely feet and think you're an ogre or something?

peeling,3dom3k,minnesotalyfe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:56:04 2015 UTC,It's a chemical exfoliant for your feet designed to get rid of dead skin and calluses.
peeling,3dom3k,itwillamend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:23:02 2015 UTC,Alright. This finally sold me. Where did you buy it? Ordering it tonight

peeling,3dh2qm,BiddyCavit,4,Thu Jul 16 05:33:05 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been seeing a lot of posts about Babyfoot. I have no idea what it is. Is it as a result of being pregnant? Is it some sort of a fungus?  It looks so pleasurable though, whatever it is.  Happy peeling!"
peeling,3dh2qm,PandorasMusicalBox,2,Thu Jul 16 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"It's a product. I believe the brand is Tony Moly, or something to that effect.   Basically, you soak your feet in the product for the specified amount of time and then your feet peel within the next week or so."
peeling,3dh2qm,rhinocerosbladder,2,Thu Jul 16 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Is it painful at all? I've been seeing it a lot lately too and showed her, she wants to try it but thinks peeling will hurt. Thanks for the high-resolution picture!"
peeling,3dh2qm,p_ter,2,Thu Jul 16 22:03:48 2015 UTC,Absolutely 100% painless. Just make sure you have no cuts on your feet as the product has fruit acids in which could sting on application if you have broken skin.
peeling,3dh2qm,PandorasMusicalBox,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"Not actually OP, but I've done some digging and found no one reporting pain (I have yet to try it!). It's simply a chemical exfoliater. Not entirely sure how it works but is often regarded as healthier than a physical exfoliation (taking a tool such as an emery board and manually scratching off skin) as I've heard physical can create tiny tears in the skin. Good luck!"
peeling,3dh2qm,BiddyCavit,2,Thu Jul 16 22:59:25 2015 UTC,I'm going to have to get some.  PVA glue can only do so much...

peeling,3cz9f8,Aclangl,2,Sun Jul 12 03:50:32 2015 UTC,"It was less than ideal the first few days, I definitely opted for cooler showers and a nice slathering of lidocaine before I hopped in.  Takes the edge off."

peeling,3cyfhm,lil_suprises,3,Sat Jul 11 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting to try it. Is it worth the money? How long are your feet ""baby soft""? Does the peeling cause any pain?"
peeling,3cyfhm,lil_suprises,4,Sun Jul 12 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm glad I tried it, so for me I'd say it was worth the money. Plus I had this little calloused bit of skin next to my toenail, which had been bugging me and it's gone now, so that's a definite plus.  As far as how long they're baby soft for. I don't know. I'm only on day 5 so they haven't even finished peeling yet. I'll get back to you on that.  And nope, the peeling hasn't caused me any pain."

Is it really worth the money yeah? Cos your foot is amazing and I wanna go haha. Also, how callused do your feet have to be?"
peeling,3cu71p,luxtina,3,Fri Jul 10 20:27:56 2015 UTC,What is baby foot? I just discovered this sub.
peeling,3cu71p,tjak_01,5,Sat Jul 11 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"It's an exfoliant foot peel. Basically you get these little plastic booties with the inside coated with this gel stuff and you have to put them on your feet for an hour. Then a few days later all of the dead skin on your feet just peels right off, easy peasy and it's meant to leave your feet baby soft, hence the name. If you google Baby Foot there's probably a whole bunch of things that explain it better than I can.  This is my first time trying it and I have to say I'm not disappointed so far.  Also, heads up, I'm about to post a few pics from Day 5."
peeling,3cu71p,tjak_01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:26:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I'll look into that.

peeling,3c5c89,PlasticGirl,2,Sun Jul 5 06:05:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Keep takin' photos. The best way to soothe rough dry skin is to make this paste: a dab of vaseline, a few drops of vitamin E oil (or break open a capsule), and a squirt of coconut oil. Rub well into hands. If you have cotton gloves, you can put those on, but if not the cream should absorb well."
peeling,3c5c89,PlasticGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:45:18 2015 UTC,Awesome!  I'll definitely give that a try.  I've been using gold bond medicated lotion and it's good for about 30 minutes before I have to re apply.  I'll try this mixture out
peeling,3c5c89,thesaltyoubreathe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:58:20 2015 UTC,"Lemme know how it works. Also, you might want to consider not using regular, commercial hand-soap or dishsoap or body soap because they tend to act as detergents - they strip all the oils off your skin. Using a milder soap, such as vegan or castile soaps, will not be so harsh on your hands. If you have a Trader Joes nearby, their Lavender and Chamomile handsoap does the trick."
