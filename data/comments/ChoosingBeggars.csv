""You drinking all that by yourself?, I should take you home after, and chuckles..."" I just smirked and said, it takes a lot more than that to get me to go somewhere with someone. She immediately flips her shit and starts to curse me out and say how dare I think this and that, and all the usual shit they try to belittle you with. I remained calm and just ignored her, that really pissed her off more.  At that time she says the inevitable line, you think you're hot or something? You can't handle a girl like me!!!, I look over and see the stool is about to break from under her. I politely say, you should stand, because it seems to me your stool/bar chair cant handle you either. As she begins to fume and ready to all out rage, the stool/chair breaks.

I don't require an answer from you."
ChoosingBeggars,36nck1,banned_1_time,7,Thu May 21 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"Because ""head of the house"" means ""sole ruler"" and not ""part of a team"". Why not? In the days pre-birth control, a person willing to have sex with multiple partners was foolish because they risked a baby every time, but in these days of 99% effective BC, a person who has multiple partners means someone who's more casual about sex and responsible with birth control. Why not? Do you think a woman will sleep with anyone who can pay for half a two bedroom apartment? Would you? People of all genders can have standards, and aren't attracted to everyone. Edit: Also, once you get into an exclusive relationship, don't you stop trying to fuck all those people who are attractive to you but aren't your s.o.? Why do you assume the woman you trust enough to be in a relationship won't respect it? Whoa there, way to dismiss a valid point because of the person it comes from. Because they have pets and live in an apartment, and happened to be born with a genetic condition that can be managed with meds, they're automatically worthless and can have no good opinions?

ChoosingBeggars,36nck1,Hereibe,-11,Sat May 23 02:31:53 2015 UTC,"Head of house means CEO of the house.  A good CEO doesn't make decisions without respecting the needs of everyone involved and also makes joint decisions, but ultimately has the final say.  If you get married that's just part of it.  The husband is the authority figure in marriage.  That's marriage for thousands of years.  I don't understand why so many people want to get married if they can't even agree with that basic tradition. The more partners a woman has the more unhappy she will be in marriage.  Unhappy wife means no-fault divorce and losing half your shit.  Accidental pregnancy isn't the only risk.  STDs are much more likely when you have many partners even when using condoms as they don't protect against skin-to-skin contact.  Don't forget about emotional baggage that comes with tons of partners and the fact that you're making an investment into basically a rental car. It's not about the woman having sex with the male room mate.  It's because it's strange for a grown woman to choose to live with a man when there are plenty of women in the world to be room mates with.  It's just a red flag similar to women who only have male friends.  Just not something to get involved with. Yeah, any person with 10 pets while living in an apartment is probably a dumbass and their opinions are automatically invalid."

A relationship is not a business. Holy mother of assumptions Batman! Checking out your link (Huffpo, really? How credible.) and following their sources here's what I found:   a)  First link goes nowhere. It's to a google news page that says ""No articles related to national marriage project were found.""  b) The National Marriage Institute is bankrolled by both the John Templeton and the Bradley foundations, which are heavy lobbyists for neo-conservative and Christian Conservative legislature. It seems highly suspicious that this study just happens to prove exactly what slant they want to sell to Congress.  c) Even the article you linked cautions against taking it at its face value and assuming that study has definitive correlations. There are multiple interpretations, like people being able to recognize unhealthy relationships better and deciding to get out.  d) Oh lord here comes the ""divorce rape"" accusations. You don't lose half, you lose proportionally to who supported whom. A woman or man who stays at home providing childcare and keeping the house together gave up YEARS of their ability to work- who the hell is going to hire them at the exact same place they would have been if they had spent those years gaining work experience? And that's only in the case of a stay at home parent. If both parties were working equally, it's half of the marital possessions that are split, aka, the things you both bought.  e) You are correct about STDs. However, many are treatable, and the ones that are not are legally supposed to be disclosed. If you're marrying someone, you BOTH should get tested. If having an incurable STD is a deal breaker to you (as it is for many people, quite justifiably) then you can choose not to be in a relationship with that person.  3) Strange? There are a million and one reasons why someone might room with the opposite gender. And one of them is that they're actually cool with 50% of the population and can treat them like a normal human.  Women and men are not sexually crazed beasts driven into rut, being human means self-control.  4) Oh lord. You do realize in many metropolitan cities there's only apartment housing right? And that many apartments are the same size as houses? Example: In NYC there's many an ""apartment"" that's bigger than my house. If the pets are small, like rats, it's easy to manage, even in a small apartment."
ChoosingBeggars,36nck1,Hereibe,-7,Sat May 23 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"\1.  A marriage is literally a business partnership.  You're financially joining yourself to someone else legally.    A woman or man who stays at home providing childcare and keeping the house together gave up YEARS of their ability to work- who the hell is going to hire them at the exact same place they would have been if they had spent those years gaining work experience?   This is fine as long as in divorce that woman comes around and cleans my house and cooks me dinner every day.  I'm upholding my side of the divorce by supporting her financially, she needs to uphold her side by supporting me logistically.  \4.  She's poor, lives in a very inexpensive part of the country, and lives in a place with shared laundry.  Her husband quit his job and gets really pissed off at her for wanting so many pets (understandably so).  She gets pissed at him for not letting her have even more than 10 pets.  We're talking cats and dogs.  Read her history, I did.  It's hilarious."
ChoosingBeggars,36nck1,theStingraY,3,Sat May 23 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"No. The cash the higher earning partner gives to the stay at home parent (and note I'm giving neutral terms here because this happens to BOTH sexes depending on if the dad or mom stays home- you just hear about more men because it's a holdover of days when there were limited jobs for women and none of them high earning for the man to work) after a divorce is to help them stay at their same level that they had before. You know why? Because people who feel financially trapped will stay in abusive situations, and let their kids stay in abusive situations so the kids can keep going to their schools and keep having medical work done and keep having food in their bellies. In the court's opinion, that is detrimental to society as a whole. That's different, and you're right, an apartment or even a house cannot safely hold 10 medium to large size animals unless it is very large and has sprawling grounds."
