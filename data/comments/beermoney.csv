But my advice would be to just ignore the emails and try to qualify for a survey on the site directly. I don't think I've ever qualified for a survey invitation through email. Instant PayPal payout is nice

You get anywhere from 5-25 points per survey (1 point equals 10 cents, can cash out at $5 min for Amazon or $10 min for PayPal) and the estimated times are fairly accurate.

beermoney,3e4t24,Garwald,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:42:31 2015 UTC,Nielson mobile is definitely not the fastest earner but it is one of the most passive i use on my swagbucks phone. I cant remember the last time i did anything with it and i typically get ten dollars every 3 months. Panel app is on the same phone but is useless. Screenwise trends is similar to Nielson mobile and nets me 2 dollars a week with an occasional sign in check.
beermoney,3e2fmd,Jingy_,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:05 2015 UTC,I had a similiar case before but i got my points cancelled though. They told me that they detected IP address from US (im from UK) which i really have no idea where it could come from as i use a wireless router for my phones. In the end they asked for my ID which i duly send.

beermoney,3e2fmd,yankeesfan01x,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:41 2015 UTC,Yea   You could be redeeming $113 worth of Amazon.com which you can trade for 90% and get $102 in Paypal. So you're been losing 12 bucks each time.

But I feel you, I've started buying my buddies gift cards and selling them for an extra buck here or there since he feels paranoid as well.    Edit: My suggestion is to start off with $5 amazon cards just redeem a bunch of those and trade.  That way if you DO get scammed it'll be a minor loss."
beermoney,3e2fmd,SuminderJi,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:44 2015 UTC,I'm not sure - I actually use the gift cards on Amazon (we use Subscribe and Save for many household items) instead of trying to turn them into cash.

beermoney,3e2udz,HULKx,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"Short answer, yes. We're paying people to share it around with friends. The reason for that being that the app is more fun with friends.   What makes us different from fanduel is that you can play against just a friend, head to head. There's no salaries or insane stats which makes it easy. It's super simple to pick players which makes the learning curve rather small, even for people who don't know sports. My girlfriend plays against me, and has beaten me, while knowing nothing about baseball but still has fun. You can play against friends for free or for money or play against random people and get matched up.  I hope that answers your question, if it doesn't please prod me more. I'll be completely transparent about what we do/who we are."

This will probably not really impact small-mid level requesters, but it will definitely take a hit out of the requesters who post thousands of penny tasks (that aren't worth doing anyways).

beermoney,3duhsx,sylviandark,26,Sun Jul 19 17:39:13 2015 UTC,"You get 20 bucks the first time in a given Monday-Sunday period, and 35-45 the second time depending on your weight. If you're a guy then you'll probably be in the highest weight bracket (175lbs+ I think?). You have to wait 48 hours between donations and can't donate more than twice in any 7-day period. They have promotions ALL THE TIME though so you usually earn more money. Once I got 95 bucks from a single donation."
beermoney,3duhsx,EmployeeTK421,7,Sun Jul 19 18:18:10 2015 UTC,Do you have a list of disqualifiers? because my disability was undiagnosed I have always suspected I couldn't donate.
beermoney,3duhsx,charredgrass,21,Sun Jul 19 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"You'd have to call since there are too many to recall off the top of my head. They can tell you over the phone.

beermoney,3duhsx,Pumpkin_Bagel,2,Sun Jul 19 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"Look up donation centers in your area. There are different companies that do this, it's not through a hospital. There are a ton of restrictions, though.  Some things differ ar different organizations, but it shouldn't be to different.   And there is an age limit, and weight range. If you weigh next to nothing, donations could be extremely detrimental to your health."
beermoney,3duhsx,CurlingPornAddict,-8,Mon Jul 20 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"If you want to donate out of kindness, you should donate blood instead of plasma. Or better yet, whole blood Edit : forgot crucial information, you cannot donate plasma if you are underage"

beermoney,3duhsx,Viniferafake,2,Mon Jul 20 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"Whole blood in the US typically yields an RBC unit and a plasma unit, that might be further processed into cryoprecipitate. It's pretty rare to make platelets from WB in the US (apheresis platelets are preferred and good donors are highly sought after).  Plasma collected by centers that pay you for your time goes for fractionation. This allows individual proteins to be separated and concentrated. If you have a clotting disorder, you can receive just the factor you need. This plasma is also used to make controls and reagents for clinical assays, especially coagulation assays.  So no matter the type of donation, you're still helping! In fact, certain blood types are more advantageous for each component. Type O- is universal donor for RBCs (no antigens), while type AB+ is universal donor for plasma (no antibodies)."
beermoney,3duhsx,A_Weino,3,Mon Jul 20 03:48:45 2015 UTC,"Holy crap. In nz you have to go two weeks between donations and you don't get paid. Did get a sweet drink bottle last time though, so there is that."
beermoney,3duhsx,sylviandark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"That's because it isn't great for your body to donate plasma more than once every two weeks, but they have you doing it four in a two week period."

beermoney,3duhsx,sbroll,2,Mon Jul 20 02:35:34 2015 UTC,The reason for the weight-based payment is because they can target a higher plasma yield for a donor that weighs more.
beermoney,3duhsx,lookslikeyoureSOL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:51:37 2015 UTC,Correct. You donate 30-40% more plasma each time if you're in the high weight category vs the lowest one. (There are only three)

It's really not that bad. And if you get a tiny dot of scarring on your arm, you don't feel much pain at all when the needle goes in.

beermoney,3duhsx,lookslikeyoureSOL,22,Sun Jul 19 19:27:12 2015 UTC,Because they pay you for 'time' since it is illegal to sell human parts.
beermoney,3duhsx,zaceory,5,Sun Jul 19 21:32:03 2015 UTC,Because having blood sucked from your body and then pumped back in really sucks and the time you spend there is worth more than they pay.
beermoney,3duhsx,nyconx,4,Mon Jul 20 01:09:08 2015 UTC,"the time you spend there is worth more than they pay.   Um, not for the people who who actually donate? Obviously if you are well off enough it's not worth your time, but a ton of people, $20-$30/hour twice a week is well worth the time for a relatively relaxing experience."
beermoney,3duhsx,Chocobean,0,Mon Jul 20 04:18:17 2015 UTC,It's more like $20 for a three hour process. I'm just saying that's why it's a donation.   I started donating blood instead because it's much quicker process and I don't have an irritating hole in my arm.
beermoney,3duhsx,whiskeytango55,2,Mon Jul 20 06:26:31 2015 UTC,"Where I go they advertise the average donation to take 45 minutes, which matches my experience. That's $33/hour assuming you go twice a week. But, yeah, $20 for 3 hours is less than minimum wage, definitely not great."

beermoney,3dwazc,Fishering,9,Mon Jul 20 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"Hey there. This is just my personal opinion:   Hands down, start entering them now. There is a weekly limit on how much you can redeem. I didn't see anything about it last year (I got a bit lost in the Beta migration though, tbh...) but in the last several years, MCR has run their ""12 days of Holiday"" promotion. For December 1-12, each day has a different retailer. You can get a $25 gift card to that retailer for something small, usually ~600 points.  Some examples are Target, McDs (usually a $5 for ~100), Home Depot, and AMC movie tickets. I save up all of my codes throughout the year in preparation for that week. Side note, always look for promotions! The 6 Minute Maid (or any black caps...) promotion to get a free movie ticket was great. I got 5 tickets for free that way (technically 30 points each, that's cheap IMO). This week it's double points on all sprite codes, so make sure to enter only Sprite starting tomorrow, 7/20.   edit: Here is the SD thread on last year's Holiday rewards. The more time you have now to build up your codes, the more options you will have."
beermoney,3dwazc,roastboffywoffs,2,Mon Jul 20 02:53:39 2015 UTC,Just wanting to piggy back on this topic since you seem to be really good at MCR - what's the deal with status?  Worth accruing?  Any tips or suggestions on how to do it without spamming friends?
beermoney,3dwazc,Delanakatrella,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give my answer but I am definitely not the right person to ask.  I think it unlocks more rewards...? I've really never seen anything in Gold that I thought was unbelievably more awesome than Bronze. Someone else may be able to answer that part of your question better than I can. I wonder if Holiday rewards require some status? I'm not sure.   The actual status changes give you free rewards, iirc some nice sized Restaurant.com gift cards and stuff. I opted for a donation because I have wayyyy too many R.com GC's as it is, but... free is always good I guess. You can always give away the codes.   I have created a dummy twitter that noone knows about and I tweet all of the challenges and stuff. I rushed Gold status pretty early on and have kept it since Beta launched."
beermoney,3dwazc,roastboffywoffs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:38 2015 UTC,"Wow! Massive thank you to you! It's Sunday, does the week reset on Monday? Debating wether or not to enter them tonight or tomorrow/later in the week.  I will start saving! THANKS!"
beermoney,3dwazc,FrankPapageorgio,7,Mon Jul 20 02:58:34 2015 UTC,"As a 7 year MCR vet, I disagree with ""entering them now"" if you only have access to a limited amount of points.   MCR regularly does Double Point Days in certain products. For example, they have double points on Sprite products the 20th-26th.   There is a slick deals mega thread if you can track it down where they list the products that have historically had double point days. For example, Freasca would be very rare, but they regularly double Coke and Diet Coke products.   Hoard your points, wait to enter them on double point days, and only redeem them during the 12 days of Coke Rewards promotion in December-ish when they deeply discount the rewards to make it affordable.   Most people don't reach the cap limit unless they get a TON of points from a source, and if you have that ""problem"" well then just enter shit whenever because it doesn't matter.  I at one point had an account for each day of the week because I worked for a place that had 350+ people with free sodas, and me and another guy would raid the 12 pack cases thrown out daily. I remember getting a $5 subway gift card daily with the points I was redeeming, it made my lunch practically free."
beermoney,3dwazc,roastboffywoffs,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:57 2015 UTC,"OP said that he has ""hundreds"" of unredeemed caps. At a limit of 25 caps a week, if ""hundreds"" is even something like 200, that is 8 weeks of points if he doesn't miss any.    Given how often double points rolls around, if he waits to enter any points until those weeks, he will most likely not be able to take full advantage of the holiday promotion. Without going too in-depth into that, that's why I told him to start entering."
beermoney,3dwazc,roastboffywoffs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:28:35 2015 UTC,"lol, I just counted. I have a bucket full of caps, and I have a drawer with a few tabs from the 12 packs of cans. I have 6 tabs, and about 270 caps."
beermoney,3dwazc,blancmane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"Nice! You definitely have enough for at least one $25 GC, and a bit more in excess if you hit up the point double promotions. This week is a great time to start - go ahead and enter sprite caps this week for double points."
beermoney,3dwazc,blancmane,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:22 2015 UTC,what do you suggest are the best options for redeeming?  haven't used very long and the rewards don't seem very good.   i must be missing something
beermoney,3dwazc,FrankPapageorgio,2,Mon Jul 20 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"Based on other people's answers, I think the best things to redeem for would be the holiday promotion in December."
beermoney,3dwazc,migato86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:10 2015 UTC,thanks.  I'll look out fir that
beermoney,3dwazc,FrankPapageorgio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"Wait until the Christmas promotion  I believe they have $25 gift cards for 650ish points. Places like Beat Buy, Walmart, TJMaxx, maybe Home Depot... Plus AMC movie tickets for reduced points.   They used to have a Wednesday deal where it was easy to get stuff like Six Flags tickets for cheap chit they stopped that promotion.   The rewards get worse every single year. They keep limiting how much we can enter per week and upping the prices of the rewards."
beermoney,3dwazc,roads30,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"Wow I am surprised you were able to get away with that many accounts. I had one for myself and one for my mom that I managed. Coupons were being sent to the same address and coke rewards took notice and shut down both our accounts, causing us to lose all the points we accumulated. I was super pissed and called to argue about it but they gave zero fucks."
beermoney,3dwazc,roastboffywoffs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:25:26 2015 UTC,I was using fake addresses unless I ordered a physical reward

beermoney,3dwazc,roads30,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:01 2015 UTC,I think it's 12 a.m. on Sunday night/Monday morning (maaaaaybe Saturday night/Sunday morning?). I usually do mine every Saturday.

beermoney,3dwazc,roads30,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:00:47 2015 UTC,"for 250 275 points each you can score coupons (mail only) for free 12 pack's. or for 175 points they offer $3.00 off 12 pack coupons.  as of right now, i'm leaning more towards the 3.00 off considering my local stores here have coke sales every other week or so. so the only thing i'd be paying for is the sales tax. and i can currently get 21 of those discounted coupons. give or take my own laziness."
beermoney,3dwazc,rebecca0nline,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:15 2015 UTC,If all you want is free coke with your points - I'd wait. Sometimes they put the free 12-pack coupons on sale for ~30 points (limit one per account). It maybe happens every few months if you can wait that long!
beermoney,3dwazc,rebecca0nline,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"crap i totally forgot about those ""flash sales"". good point! thank you!  edit: you should see the complainers over on MCR's facebook page. it's like a running broken record."
beermoney,3dwazc,rebecca0nline,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:24 2015 UTC,I have about 6000 points worth of points I haven't entered. Would people be interested in them?

Media Insiders is cross platform. You could also starting doing Bing Rewards. Qmee and Traffic Micro are also options on desktop. If you are interested and willing to use my ref links I will pm them to you."

beermoney,3dy7qq,nguyentu0917,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't yet, what exactly is it? I just finished setting up Media Insiders. The VPN seems to slow down my computer's internet connection considerably though :("
beermoney,3dy7qq,shazo85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the main downside of Media Insiders. Bing Rewards basically offer you rewards (giftcards, sweepstakes, etc) for using Bing as your main search engine."
beermoney,3dy7qq,shazo85,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"The ones I use are PerkTV, Swagbucks, Media Insiders, Earnhoney, Mobile Performance Meter, Bing, ChargerPay, Checkpoints, Screenwise Trends, SlideJoy, Adme and Fronto.  All that are being run on Android that are run on a phone.  Earnhoney and Bing are both run on the PC.  ChargerPay isn't what it once was as it seems to crash a lot and have ads you have to exit out of. Like has been pointed out the VPN for Media Insiders does slow things down.    I see something that you're running that I haven't heard about.  What is DataCoup also how long did it take for you to get into App Optix?  I have installed it a few times and have never got an invite."
beermoney,3dy7qq,shazo85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:52:15 2015 UTC,"DataCoup is you pretty much link up your social media, linkedin, credit cards, etc, and you sell your data for a value. I have an Instagram account with a large amount of followers that isn't personal so I think they pull info from that.  App Optix was really quick, I want to say a day or two at the most.  How much do you earn per week if you don't mind me asking? Isn't Swagbucks/Perk TV less passive?"
beermoney,3dy7qq,shazo85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:36 2015 UTC,"They aren't set and forget, but you really don't have to do much. For Perk I just run PerkTv and if I'm home or awake I press yes when asked if I'm still watching.  Swagbucks has taken a large hit with changes to the apps. Today seems like it's going to be a bad day, but while playing around on the internet before work I was able to get 134 points. Each point is equal to a penny.   With everything I use that has given credit this month I'm cashing out about 42 dollars a week on average.    I wonder if app optix is accepting new members.  I have never seen an email from them."
beermoney,3dy7qq,Freelander97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:43 2015 UTC,"Agh okay i'll definitely read one of the guides regarding Perk, seems like a pretty decent way to add more.  Yea i'm not sure, i did it at the beginning of July though so not too long ago. Perhaps your device isn't qualified or your region? (if they have those restrictions).  I forgot to say for Datacoup i hooked up a business CC as well which is a ""high"" priority data category.  Wow $42 is great, well done! I have some work to do haha"

beermoney,3dx3ht,hungryfood88,2,Mon Jul 20 06:44:01 2015 UTC,I use virwox | non-ref although if it's your first withdrawal they will probably do it manually which can take up to 48 hours but after that you can get bitcoins to your wallet very fast. To get bitcoins you buy SLL with your currency and then sell those SLL for bitcoins.

beermoney,3dvfam,Raiole,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"The limit is technically 500 points from videos, but you will never be able to get that much. You just need to put your phone number in when you redeem points. You can have as many accounts as you want, as far as I know. I don't think you can refer yourself, but anyways it is only 50 points if I remember correctly, so it doesn't really matter anyways. I don't know about rooting phones, but I don't see why it would matter one way or the other to Checkpoints. Hope that helps."
