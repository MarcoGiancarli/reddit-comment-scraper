It's long, dense and tough to get into, but it is amazing.  It also contains some of the saddest moments across in any form of entertainment.  The first book is a bit of a slog, the author drops you into a world with hundreds of thousands of years of history and you just sort of have to figure things out.  The second book is much more manageable and contains a jaw-dropping climax.  I don't want to spoil anything, but if you fully get into Malazan it will destroy you on many occasions."

I've seen some people complain that the main character is a whiney ass, but I think the author does a great job capturing the emotional crap people go through in their late teens and 20s on the journey to becoming an adult. A lot of people have a shitty self-centered whiney phase. I think people who didn't like the book wanted it to be Harry Potter/Narnia where everyone is noble and brilliant all the time. Those books are great, but the Magicians is like taking realistic, flawed people and throwing them into those worlds.  Sorry for the tangent, I just really love those books."

booksuggestions,3dynyp,sentunderscore,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"First book is dark and gritty; not as cutesy as Meyer's first in Lunar Chronicles.  And unlike Meyer, Maas's second book is weaker.  However, the third book was really strong, and the novellas are strong as well.  She has a new series that's just started, so don't pick that up yet, okay?  It's a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, and it's a bit more of a romance than the Throne of Glass books."

Romance is in it without overwhelming the overall story."

booksuggestions,3dynyp,shark_kitty,4,Tue Jul 21 11:00:31 2015 UTC,"Just a few of my favorites (sorry about the formatting, I'm on mobile):  Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss - fantasy with adventure and romance, the third installment will hopefully be out within the next two years.  Red Rising by Pierce Brown- fantasy,  more of a mix between Cinder and Mistborn, but I haven't read the second one.   Arrows of the Queen series by Mercedes Lackey- fantasy with more weight on the romance side. It doesn't get as much love on this sub reddit as I think it should but I really enjoy it every time I read it."
booksuggestions,3dynyp,araquen,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"The only issue I have with Arrows is the man-hate is strong in that book. You can pretty much tell is a man is bad is he looks handsome. There might be an exception or two, but really it is very one-dimensional in that regard.     That said, I did read, and re-read it a lot. There are a lot of good themes in it. I just wish the author was a little more dimensional with portraying all of her characters. The books very much feel like they're pushing an agenda, not exploring an aspect of humanity."
booksuggestions,3dynyp,shark_kitty,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:34 2015 UTC,"Her books definitely push an agenda. I've noticed that more as the older I've gotten, as well as the more of her works that I've read. And while I do agree that there is a certain degree of man-hating going on, I always viewed that as one of her weaknesses that she had to struggle with and overcome. Overall though, it's one of those indulgent series that I can't help but going back to!"
booksuggestions,3dynyp,araquen,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a fun series.

booksuggestions,3dynyp,JoeyGenius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:05 2015 UTC,"My first thought is that the Companion model is very much akin to Anne McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern. The first trilogy and Dragonsong/Dragonsinger. Frankly, after that, I think she failed to adhere to her convictions to not farm the material to death. Sherri Tepper's A Plague of Angels was an interesting read and came out around that time ('93, I think but book themes kind of have float). Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince series was also an interesting read, as was her Exiles series (which never was finished, sadly). Emma Bull's War for the Oaks is an amazing read, though now pretty dated since it is firmly in the 80's, with no wiggle-room.  Not quite similar, but strong female lead, who stands out via a certain exceptionality trope. Joyce Ballou Gregorian's Tredana Trilogy, while thematically;y different, also has a strong female lead, and an interesting premise. Judith Tarr's Alamut and Dagger and the Cross are go-tos for me as historical fantasy. Glenn Cook The Black Company - sort of, well, completely antithetical, but very well written and a surprising romance element. Would kind of loop back to Mistborn in a way, too. Viewpoint character is male, but strong female characters in the books.  I think that the current lot I keep getting inspired to read when i finish one of that set. I spent decades trying to winnow in sic-fi and fantasy books with strong female leads. It wasn't easy. I have more, but they start deviating from Arrows and I'll have to dust off the old paperbacks.    One last, because she rarely gets notice: Kathryn Kurtz Deryni series. Great books, almost forgotten."

It's both your standard fantasy book AND a deconstruction of the fantasy genre as a whole, using Narnia and Harry Potter as a base.

Here's a snippet from the Wikipedia article about it:  ""Massive environmental changes and global disease, attributed to large-scale pollution, cause the collapse of civilization around the world. One large, well-to-do extended family sets up an isolated community in an attempt to survive the coming catastrophe. However, as the death toll mounts, due to a disease and other causes, they discover that they are universally infertile. After discovering that the infertility might be reversed after multiple generations of cloning, the family begins cloning themselves to survive.""  Check it out."

booksuggestions,3dwsg0,Shige_,11,Mon Jul 20 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're interested in more serious LGBT history type stuff, which is great.  I'm always pleased to see younger generations wanting to learn about what came before them.  The Normal Heart by Larry Kramer might interest you.  It was originally first published in the 80's and is a play.  There was an excellent film adaptation done last year by HBO as well.  It's about the AIDS crisis in New York during the 80s.  Angels in America - another play but a great story.  Also has a great TV mini series adaptation as well from HBO.  And the Band Played On by Randy Shilts - again, about the early days of the AIDS crisis and the politics of what was happening at the time.  Also about the race to crack the genetic code of the virus by scientists.  The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk by Randy Shilts - Harvey Milk played an important part in the LGBT rights movement in the late 70s in San Francisco.  He's important to learn about.  There was a film from 2008 called ""Milk"" starring Sean Penn that won 2 Oscars.  Also worth checking out.  There is a documentary from the 80s called ""The Life and Times of Harvey Milk"".  May be tricky to get a hold of now so ""Milk"" would work, it covers a lot of the same information.  In terms of fiction, one of my favorite gay-themed novels is Something Like Summer by Jay Bell.  It's part of an on-going series.  There are 6 now.  The first four are kind of the same story but told from different characters' points of view, kind of a unique way to approach.  The 5th and 6th are the same world but different characters with apparently some appearances from familiar faces (from what I've seen, I haven't read them yet).  This is technically a love story but it's far from cheesy.  It starts with the two boys in high school and then spans 12 years as their relationship and their lives go up and down and in all sorts of directions.  I say this to everyone I recommend this book to, that even though it was only 12 years, I felt like I lived a lifetime with these characters.  So many emotions, happiness, heartbreak, sadness, and ups and downs.  Really great book.   A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood - published originally in the 60s at a time when being homosexual was essentially a death sentence, before the Stonewall Riots and the modern gay rights movement.  It was controversial because of it's honest depiction of homosexuality.  The book didn't portray him as someone who is mentally ill or a deviant or a victim, which was virtually unheard of.  Isherwood is a bit of gay pioneer and it's worth looking into more of his books.  A Single Man was turned into an excellent film a few years ago, directed by fashion designer Tom Ford.  Colin Firth's performance earned him an Oscar nomination.  You may also want to look up the poetry of Allen Ginsberg.    I know this is book suggestions but I would also recommend you maybe check out the documentary We Were Here if that looks like something that would interest you.  I think it might be on Netflix but I'm not certain on that.  It's an incredibly powerful film, you'll cry your eyes out.  If you want more actual novels, let me know and I'll see if I can come up with something you won't find too cheesy.  A lot of the stuff I've read borders on being cliche and cheddery."

They are about a cast of characters all linked by an apartment building in San Francisco in the 1970's.  He wrote them as a serial, so there are lots of twists and turns and cliff hangers.  Excellent page turning reads, wonderful characters, funny and heartbreaking.  Romance comes in and out of the books, but they are not romance novels by any means.    I'd also suggest Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues.  It's a memoir about coming out as a butch lesbian as a working class person in the pre-Stonewall era.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend His Dark Materials (Northern Lights/Golden Compass).   Here's my list from another post, recommending books for his age group, specifically boys:   To add to the books already mentioned (+1 for Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus/Artemis Fowl/any Roald Dahl/Harry Potter/The Giver series/Redwall/Ender's Game/Ender's Shadow/The Maze Runner/Goosebumps/Alex Rider):    39 Clues series by Rick Riordan and friends The Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan Bloody Jack series by L A Meyer (protagonist is a girl but the adventures are awesome) The Underland Chronicles by Suzanne Collins The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart Savvy and Scumble (two different books) by Ingrid Law Skulduggery Pleasant series by Derek Landy The Graveyard Book and Coraline by Neil Gaiman A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness Other books by Eoin Colfer (e.g. Supernaturalist, The Wish List) Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians by Brandon Sanderson A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket   Savvy also features a girl protagonist but screw it, I think boys should read about awesome girls as well. All of the above (at least the first books in the long series) are suitable for probably 11+ years.   These books are also awesome, but probably 13-14+:   The Bartimaeus Trilogy by Jonathan Stroud  Shade's Children and the Abhorsen series by Garth Nix  The Chaos Walking series by Patrick Ness (contains some darker themes in the 2nd as 3rd books, though, librarians proceed with caution) The Halfmen of O series by Maurice Gee Rot and Ruin series by Jonathan Maberry (zombie warning) Fat Kid Rules the World by K L Going To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee The Hobbit/LotR   NB: I didn't personally like Alex Rider or the Lemony Snicket books that much, and the Maze Runner and Alcatraz were OK, but I think teen boys would like them a lot. I totally endorse the rest of the books above, though.    If he is a super Potterhead, he might be interested in reading the James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert. They are fan fiction but novel-length and pretty impressive in terms of scope. They're not entirely authentic in terms of Britishness, but are pretty great for what they are (and they are free).

As for classics, 1984 by George Orwell is interesting and a bit horrific. You could also pick up To Kill A Mockingbird if you haven't read it. It's definitely a classic and in the news currently for its recently released sequel/prequel/first draft Go Set a Watchman.

That is until he meets some good friends that help him grow, learn our culture and go from there.  It's an absolute classic book, and for good reason.

Martin. A brilliant book series with very heavy emphasis on the human condition, which also presents a wide variety of morally complex characters. Since the characters we follow throughout the story seldom fall into one moral “category” or another, there is much room for personal growth, introspection and reflection et cetera. However, you should note that the reader follows not one main character but several point-of-view characters (each with very distinct personalities). Of course, this allows for a more nuanced perspective all-together, but somewhat limits the perspectives of each individual character. In any case, whether or not this fits your request, the series is amazing and you should check it out!"

Anita Blake, whose stories begin with Guilty Pleasures, is initially a fairly conservative, religious, black-and-white, ""I'm a good guy; they're the bad guy"" sort of person. She is a legal vampire executioner, as vampires are now legal citizens but can't be held in prisons. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly convinced that she is one of the ""monsters"" too and that not all monsters are the ""bad guy"". She enters into quite a few relationships and becomes a champion for polyamory, spending pages and pages talking about how everything can be looked at in shades of grey, instead of black and white.   The series as a whole can be quite over-written. It is graphic; initially graphic violence that develops into graphic sex. Some of the later novels barely have a plot outside of some discussions of relationships, and Anita usually acquires some new power that will perfectly save the day- a plot that can become repetitive. Overall though, I generally enjoy them. And it is definitely a situation where I consider the Anita in the most recent books to be almost unrecognizable if compared to the Anita in the first few books.  Happy Reading!"

If Goodreads doesn't call it out as a sequel, you can read anything in any order. Have fun!  That said, I don't know if I'm imagining this... But I feel like her newest novels are much more character-focused than her old ones. I could be wrong, but I remember the Riddle-Master of Hed books and The Forgotten Beasts of Eld being classic fantasy adventures... While her new novels tend to all be personal stories about a small, intimate cast of characters in a surreal situation. But I haven't re-read her oldest stuff in a while, so maybe I'm wrong.

Scott Lynch's second and third books aren't as bad as they are made out to be, they just aren't as good as Lies was. Sanderson's weakest novel is Elantris, I would recommend moving on to Mistborn.

If you're trying to get it into a kindle-readable form, you may prefer to grab the Docx version (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwzWXZAVz-KPUkZXVzNUdDNwTGM) or the txt version (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwzWXZAVz-KPX012ZkhrVkhoMU0).

I just finished reading The Blade Itself, by Joe Abercrombie, it's a trilogy, and I liked it.    The Witcher, by Andrzej Sapkowski, I loved the first three books, but overall the series was good. The Gentlemen Bastards, also a trilogy by Scott Lynch, it felt different, the first one was pretty good, the other two, not so much but still good read. The name of the Wind, as recommended by somebody else, is a good read, but I also recommend waiting until the last one is released.    The Dark Tower, by Stephen King, it's divided into those who love it, and the haters, I liked it, and decided to read it again this year, and still I found it very enjoyable, it's a masterpiece divided into 7 books. Codex Alera, by Jim Butcher, 6 books in an interesting world  The Belgariad and The Malloreon, by David Eddings. are interesting, maybe a bit oriented to YA but still, a nice read  And lastly, my all-time fantasy series, by all means, is Discworld by Terry Pratchett, it's divided into different series (That change the main character, but are based on the same world)."
booksuggestions,3dhn8f,doterobcn,7,Thu Jul 16 14:13:35 2015 UTC,I'd suggest you start with the Mistborn trilogy by Brandon Sanderson. It's a must read in the Fantasy genre. Great new world building and magic system..

booksuggestions,3dhn8f,hearinghands,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"Fantasy graphic novels I recommend:   Saga - It's the darling of the comic book scene right now and for good reason. It's beautifully drawn, creative, and will tug at your emotions. There are a few trades out now, so there's plenty to read Rat Queens - A cheeky portrayal of an ""adventuring party"". There are only two trades of this right now, but because they're always on a new adventure you won't feel like you need to wait to read the whole thing at once. Locke & Key - It seems cliche, but this is about a spooky old mansion with many locked doors and a family of kids who find the keys.  This series is already finished so there's no need to wait for the next volume.   For novels (beside others suggested here):   The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch- follows a crew of con-men thieves in a fantasy city, switching between their current heist (their a fan of the long-game, complicated plan) and their childhood training. Flex by Ferrett Steinmetz - Fast-paced urban fantasy that mostly focuses on a really cool magic system and has a video-game feel at times."

Oh, and his spunky best-friend/cop-partner who is a BAMF chick.   I am totally not doing the series justice with that description. The books aren't too long. They are funny, and just the right amounts of fantasy and crime mystery (mob boss in Chicago)....  Come over to r/dresdenfiles if you don't mind spoilers...most threads are tagged as spoilers if they have them, but there are a few books in the series so you might get stuff revealed early (like details about the vampires or about his long-dead family or crazy adoptive father figure...)  Edit: why the downvotes?

booksuggestions,3dgwo3,Nihil_Sanctum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:11:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like nearly all the books I read are in the 400 page range. Unless you pick up a tome of a book, you'll probably be in the right range.  I would recommend going into a book store/library, picking things up, reading the back, cross referencing with goodreads for some reviews, and deciding on it.   Certain authors, like Terry Pratchett, only write shorter books in a long series. Other authors, like George RR Martin, could have used an editor to chop down those 1000 pages.   Other recommendations on here have to do with classics or fairly modern classics. When I want something that grabs my attention and is written in a modern voice, I don't read anything older than the 80s- that's my rule.   PS, Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood is excellent, and from the viewpoint of this guy who's name is ""snowman"". But, her stuff is fictional literature and so it's a bit more high brow writing than general fiction.   edit I also wanted to add two more, Provenance by Laney Salisbury, and I Was Vermeer, by Frank Wynne. Both art crime books, both written as novels, and both page turners! I don't often read books that would interest men (as I assume you are) so I don't have many more to suggests but these are excellent!"

booksuggestions,3dfyba,fritz_freiheit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:38:18 2015 UTC,"In addition to The Name of the Wind, and seeing that they haven't been suggested here yet (edit: with the exception of Rivers of London), I'll add:   Among Others by Jo Walton The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch Midnight Riot (British title: Rivers of London)   Frankly, I liked all of these more than The Name of the Wind, but I've become pretty picky about fantasy in my old age.  Among Others   Startling, unusual, and yet irresistably readable, Among Others is at once the compelling story of a young woman struggling to escape a troubled childhood, a brilliant diary of first encounters with the great novels of modern fantasy and SF, and a spellbinding tale of escape from ancient enchantment.   The Lies of Locke Lamora   In this stunning debut, author Scott Lynch delivers the wonderfully thrilling tale of an audacious criminal and his band of confidence tricksters. Set in a fantastic city pulsing with the lives of decadent nobles and daring thieves, here is a story of adventure, loyalty, and survival that is one part ""Robin Hood"", one part Ocean's Eleven, and entirely enthralling...    Midnight Riot / Rivers of London   Probationary Constable Peter Grant dreams of being a detective in London's Metropolitan Police. Too bad his superior plans to assign him to the Case Progression Unit, where the biggest threat he'll face is a paper cut. But Peter's prospects change in the aftermath of a puzzling murder, when he gains exclusive information from an eyewitness who happens to be a ghost. Peter's ability to speak with the lingering dead brings him to the attention of Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale, who investigates crimes involving magic and other manifestations of the uncanny. Now, as a wave of brutal and bizarre murders engulfs the city, Peter is plunged into a world where gods and goddesses mingle with mortals and long-dead evil is making a comeback on a rising tide of magic."

It's about a boy growing up in a village in the Amazon who witnesses his village get slaughtered and destroyed by large corporations in the search for riches in the jungle. He teams up with a few others of the same persuation and begins to execute terrorist attacks across the world in an attempt to raise awareness around the symbiotic relationship humans have with the rainforests. It's placed in the 80s and everything is normal except for the events and people being fiction.  They spend a lot of time taking in the beaty of the world, going beautiful places and enjoying life. Having sex with each other etc. Free spirited. Lifelike and beautifully written. The theme is going back to our roots to live our lives more in touch with nature and therefore having a much more satisfying existence. The message is that we should pay more attention to nature and that by destroying nature we are in effect destroying ourselfs. Definitely dystopian."

booksuggestions,3dcie3,shannon_dybvig,2,Thu Jul 16 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"The Orientalist by Tom Reiss is a fascinating biography about Lev Nussimbaum, a Jewish man who successfully passed himself off as a Muslim Prince and became a popular author in Nazi-era Germany. His exploits only  become more outrageous as his life goes on,  finally culminating in his house arrest in Positano.   This is a good book if you're at all interested in the era or con artistry. One of the elements that makes the book such a ripping read is Reiss details the painstaking process of uncovering what Nussimbaum was and wasn't lying about, so at times it feels like a mystery novel."

booksuggestions,3dcrar,all_thetime,3,Wed Jul 15 06:38:25 2015 UTC,"I'm literally copying and pasting my answer to a similar question.   Well, you could always go with more Murakami books. All his books tend to have the same feelings and male main characters -- somewhat down and out guys who like to read and listen to classical music. Many Murakami novels are I-novels which emphasize the narrator's relationships with other people. My favourite Murakami is The Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki.   Despite being an 'Americanized' Japanese person, Murakami's writing style is very Japanese, so you could take a look at other Japanese authors.  Natsume Soseki's - Kokoro (ALL about character relationships)  Takashi Hiraide - The Guest Cat (Also ALL about character relationships + cats)  Ruth Ozeki - A Tale for the Time Being (Japanese American writer, this is a story which reminds me of Murakami -- the narrator finds a diary in BC, Canada and sees that it's owned by a girl in Japan. She wants to know more about the owner of the diary). It's beautiful.  You could also look at the works of Murakami's inspirations.   JD Salinger's Franny and Zooey is a book comprised of 2 stories. Both these stories are just people talking to each other, hanging out.   Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love is, literally, about love. Most of the stories in this collection have to do with interactions between couples.   Hope this helps."

It is interesting, but there's not really that much discussion of ROMANCE in it, honestly it's all about dating.  As someone in a committed relationship, I wanted to read about how romance has changed in the modern era, not how to meet someone new/online dating/hooking up.  So far it's all about the build up to dating someone, not how you actually navigate the waters of a relationship nowadays. Maybe it will be included towards the end, but there doesn't seem to be enough book left for that.  Just feel a bit misled by the title, I guess, but what can you do.

There was literally zero character progression with Logan, they left Farro's story too open for a trilogy.

If the books had been ""real"" the whole way through (no miraculous escapes, or things falling perfectly into place) then i probably would have liked it more.

Both have a society split up into different fractions, depending on what they provide the world.

booksuggestions,3d9n7r,asteroid_blues01,3,Wed Jul 15 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out Kazuo Ishiguro's ouevre if you're looking for books where hapless main characters embark on meandering journeys of tortuously muted self-discovery. The Remains of the Day fits that description perfectly, and it's probably the best entry point to his work. If you like Remains, I'd recommend An Artist of the Floating World and Never Let Me Go as well. Ishiguro chooses details like setting, time period, etc. after he's written the bulk of the plot, so everything is secondary to the characters' internal development (or lack thereof)."

booksuggestions,3d7av0,wafflingwaffle,5,Tue Jul 14 02:05:09 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing. It's not fluffy or sappy, and the prose is fairly elegant. Its heroine is smart, too -- smart enough to realize what a dumbass she's being. Certainly a better option than most romance novels.  And I'll highly recommend I Capture the Castle. It's not focused only on romance. It's a family chronicle and a coming of age story, with philosophical digressions on agnosticism. This one's a masterpiece, one of my all time favorites.  A similar book to that is Five Miles from Outer Hope, also a coming of age story featuring an eccentric family. The female narrator is delightful and hilarious. Absolute fun."

This is the kind of scifi that used to be called space opera and might be called character-driven military scifi these days. For romance, I specifically recommend two books in the series: Shards of Honor and The Civil Campaign. The former is an unconventional love story set against a galactic war and political intrigue. The latter is basically a regency romance with scifi trappings, and is a wickedly funny exploration of what happens to romance tropes when combined with technological and biological advances of the future. They are parts of an ongoing series but each novel can be read and enjoyed on its own. But be warned, these are very good books so you'll likely end up reading them all, romance or not."

booksuggestions,3d7av0,amaxen,3,Tue Jul 14 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"If you would like a suggestion on a good fantasy romance, I highly recommend the Spice and Wolf light novel series by Isuna Hasekura. I am also a boring straight dude and had no interest in romance whatsoever in any media before giving this series a shot. I'm typically a pretty slow reader but it only took me a week to read 9 of the 250 page novels; I couldn't put them down!  The series is set in a fictionalized late medieval Germany and follows the story of a cunning merchant who reluctantly ends up traveling with a wise and playful wolf deity in the form of a young maiden with a wolf's tail and ears. On their journey to the north, the two must avoid discovery by the Church and solve some interesting economic dilemmas using the combined whit of a merchant with economic know-how and an immortal being with a silver tongue and centuries of experience. The use of rather complicated economic concepts in such an interesting and engaging manner really took me by surprise. I certainly learned a lot while reading them! Basically, it is a romance about a mortal and an immortal who gradually fall in love while on an exciting journey.  There are 17 volumes in total with an average of 250 pages each so there's tons of content to look forward to while at the same time not dragging on too long (or so I've heard). It was also adapted into an exceptional anime which is very true to the novels, though it was never finished. The soundtrack is also amazing; perfect for listening to while reading. If it sounds like something you'd be interested in I can give you the first novel in .pdf form via Google Drive."

booksuggestions,3d5lk3,Grilled_Chicken,9,Mon Jul 13 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"Have you read One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez? It has some elements of magical realism, but that's just some spice in an otherwise excellent multi-generational story about a rise and fall of the doomed Buendía clan and their accursed town, Macondo. It's a great, dramatic story, and if you're so inclined, it can also be read as an allegory or critique of Latin American history.  For a a longer family saga, I'd recommend The Wheel of Fortune by Susan Howatch. It's a modern re-telling of the 14-15th century Plantagenet family fortunes with several different viewpoints characters across the generations. There is a little bit of romance -  the book begins with the story of young Robert's infatuation with his cousin Ginevra - but it's not the main focus by any means."

But, even though you might want to save it until you've read some of his earlier work, William Gibson's newest The Peripheral is his best ever. He's reached a stage in his career where he really only has to write to please himself. So all of his influences and passions are just out there, on his sleeve for everyone to see. The first few chapters read like a Burroughs hallucination. This is what cyberpunk was meant to be!  And, don't forget to watch Sense 8 on NetFlix. Holé Moley!"

It'll give you perspective into the type of people that get 'steam rolled' in your conversations and maybe help with some strategies to make it more comfortable for quieter people  to speak up.   It's a bit of a self-help book geared towards introverts so it may be hard to get into certain parts but I think it would be worth the effort to gain a little insight.

When writers tackle apocalyptic themes, you tend to learn a lot about the author -maybe more so than other book types - their personal vision of armageddon is heavily colored by their own fears. In that respect ""the road"" by Cormac McCarthy is a far superior book, because it doesnt try to impress the authors fears on you. That said, it is a little bit bleak and long winded :-)"

Incidentally, the TV show is VERY bad history. . . ."
booksuggestions,3curwz,emkay99,2,Fri Jul 10 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's quite a list!! I figured the show was crap history but wh, what can you expect from the channel that puts out fake, god awful documentaries on mermaids.I like the story though."
booksuggestions,3curwz,emkay99,2,Sat Jul 11 05:33:42 2015 UTC,"I understand. But I've done history for a living, more or less, all my life and I get really upset when a historical novel or film plays so fast and loose with the facts, the setting might as well be on Mars.  I mean, if they don't expect you to take it seriously -- like Costner's Robin Hood movie or (my favorite) The Black Shield of Falworth -- that's one thing. It's a fantasy, or a fairy tale. But when everyone talks up how accurate the history supposedly is, like Philippa Gregory's Tudor novels, or (the very worst offender) Conn Iggulden's complete rewriting of Roman history, I take it almost personally.  This is why I like Bengtsson. He really does get the history correct, and makes an exciting story out of it as well. His slow, discursive style is very reminiscent of the sagas themselves.  Holland, who wrote her first novel as an undergrad (and graduated the same year I did), has always been very careful about historical accuracy. And her stories are deeply involving. She has a whole Viking series, too, running from the Varangian Guard to North America, but I didn't want to list all of those."
booksuggestions,3curwz,emkay99,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:09:41 2015 UTC,"I understand, if I had studied more history it would bother me too. I do find myself inspired to look up actual accurate history on Vikings though because of it. And I will definitely check out some of the books on your list. Have you read the Outlander books? A lot of people gush about all the research the author did into the historical themes, I wonder how factual any of it is."

That is, Robot Series, Galactic Empire and then Foundation.  These series aren't exactly connected (haven't read whole foundation series so don't know about that), even the books in series are mostly independent, but it gives you an interesting view of how the world changed, from everyone living in one planet to whole galaxy filled with people.  If you don't care about that you can skip directly to Foundation."

The Vichy Syndrome: History and Memory in France Since 1944 - An academic history book that looks at the history of national memory in France regarding the period after France's surrender to Germany and their complicity in running a pro-Nazi French government (Vichy). It looks at what actually happened and reconciles that with how the French haven chosen to remember it over the subsequent decades, as a means of coping with a dark period of their history.   Lastly, if you haven't already, watch Flame and Citron, a Danish film about a group of Nazi resistors (starring Mads Mikkelsen of Casino Royale and Hannibal fame)."
