90sdesign,3d8ykb,Usagii_YO,2,Tue Jul 14 16:01:21 2015 UTC,Is that a laser-shooting butterfly?
90sdesign,3d8ykb,Carcaju,3,Tue Jul 14 13:51:26 2015 UTC,I think it's just the butterfly's wing shown at a very weird angle.

Officially opened in June 1991, closed January 1998. Some footage, which shows the true 80's-90's era of the complex.  Enjoy."

90sdesign,3c0rg5,tcal13,3,Fri Jul 3 18:40:42 2015 UTC,Love the look of early-mid 90s bikes. Makes me want to sell my CBR and get something a decade or two older.
90sdesign,3c0rg5,UsingYourWifi,2,Sat Jul 4 00:14:46 2015 UTC,Thanks guys! Appreciate the kind words. She is looking pretty good these days I suppose I guess I shouldn't cast her away just yet. But being 6 foot and 200+ pounds its a bit hard to fit sometimes. She does treat me well though! Ride safe to allbof you as well!
