OLTP,3dwfqz,-suz-,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"I believe the reason they did this was because some people complained that it took too long to load the whole spreadsheet when all they wanted to see was the standings. Personally I think it would be a lot better to put it all into two spreadsheets like last season, and keep the sidebar standings updated so people who only want to see them are satisfied."

OLTP,3dwfqz,Ultimatum13,6,Mon Jul 20 03:48:14 2015 UTC,Yeh probably right. I was just meaning the standings and schedule for each comp though.
OLTP,3dwfqz,-suz-,2,Mon Jul 20 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"I meant to get to the stats, you had to open the information spreadsheet first. There should definitely be separate spreadsheets for majors and minors."

EDIT: To all the ungrateful little shits who downvoted me, would you like to take over my job? Because I wasn't meant to do it this season. I only did it because nobody else wanted to.

OLTP,3dwfqz,hoogstra,3,Mon Jul 20 06:16:44 2015 UTC,"Because I have to edit the sidebar so everyone else can look at it, and I can't do that without looking at the spreadsheet. The doc loads in two seconds because it's week 2. By the end of last season, It was taking me around 30 seconds, and it would take around 10 minutes to update every time I put new stats in. I was deleting some of the older stats just so I wouldn't go over the cell limit. With this season being longer, I would probably go over this time around if the results and standings weren't separate."

I don't know if people use it, but if they don't may as well get rid of it or move it to a separate spreadsheet.   Also, not sure if it'd make a difference, but SUMIF is probably faster than QUERY on the sheet you input stats"
OLTP,3dwfqz,hoogstra,3,Mon Jul 20 06:59:33 2015 UTC,"I also got rid of NISH due to time constraints and loading times. I hadn't really considered changing the formula because it already worked, and it's probably too late to do it now. If I did put the information and stats spreadsheets back together, it would probably still be faster than last season because I got rid of NISH, but at this point I really don't want to break anything, and it is really a non issue. It flows much better when looking at both majors and minors standings and schedules, and it is only one or two extra clicks to get to the stats."
OLTP,3dwfqz,herpaderp1995,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:04:54 2015 UTC,"Ah right.   Wouldn't really be too late to change the formulas, but not sure how much of a difference it would make anyway. Although QUERY is probably incredibly ineffective compared to SUMIF due to its versatility.   Linking the html view instead of the spreadsheet view would speed it up quite a lot for people too"

I believe Bobbay will be installed as the 5th commissioner in the coming days, as he was voted 6th in the original vote, thus rightfully the next in line.   The JTvHT verdict was nearing to a close, but due to new evidence brought up, as well as the conduct I previously mentioned, I would not be surprised if it's not solved for a little while yet. Moreover there are really only 2 unbiased commissioners involved in that decision.

That said the rules are quite clear cut on what should happen, though after talking to some of the commissioners I wouldn't mind if this exact punishment wasn't given out. It doesn't stipulate if it's the OLTP or oLTP game that's a forfeit though as it says ""games"" one would assume both."
OLTP,3dhohx,fooize,2,Thu Jul 16 11:02:41 2015 UTC,"The issue they're having with the deliberating is that there are 5 people and they can't get all of them online at once.  Also with the punishment thing, I didn't realise that existed. However, I still believe the rule is unfair, given a mistake I/Hoog made shouldn't result in punishing our entire minors team. I'd much rather see a universal punishment system, and I think a more fair punishment would be to suspend me for week six when we replay JT."
OLTP,3dhohx,fooize,4,Thu Jul 16 11:10:08 2015 UTC,That mistake you and Hoog made essentially punished the whole John Travolta minors team.
OLTP,3dhohx,fooize,4,Thu Jul 16 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"That mistake you and Hoog made essentially punished the whole John Travolta minors team.   yeah it's not really a punishment per se in correcting this.  if you accept that the game was unfair (and according to the rules, it was unfair), the team which had the advantage forfeiting the game is more like making the whole situation fair? unless there's a rematch which has it's own positives/negatives I don't think there's any fair solution but the team which was at fault copping the forfeit. Not JT's fault after all, but it is HT's fault if they go in to the game breaking the rules, and no measure should be applied to any party but the whole minors team, because they were the ones who benefited."

OLTP,3dgghz,AussieGuy96,3,Thu Jul 16 03:46:04 2015 UTC,"Yo dope, just wondering if you would consider upping the trades per week to 2?   Having it at only one allows you to trade down and nothing else, rather than a restructure of one position to gain more money by trading down to increase another position by trading up."
OLTP,3dgghz,Alleviation,2,Thu Jul 16 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had it set to 2 a while back, but then we thought it would make subs meaningless. I think I'll be going back to it though."
OLTP,3dgghz,Alleviation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:40:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess that might be a problem, but some people (yes I know I'm looking out for myself here) are trying to get some extra money by buying the under-valued players and then trading up later so even our subs will be some top tier players.   I guess if it becomes too much of a problem we can always go back to 1 (:"

OLTP,3dgghz,Alleviation,3,Thu Jul 16 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"That game is 'that game' in question. So if a redo gets played for the stats, you'll get One's score. Probably just won't be updated until the end of next round or something like that."
OLTP,3dgghz,drinkbleachtag,2,Thu Jul 16 04:08:03 2015 UTC,"Oh right I forgot to put on the thread that subs aren't being used for starters involved in the HT vs JT minors game (the ones in red) since we might get stats for them eventually. If the game is completely forfeited you'll get your subs score added to your total, but you'll get One's score if stats are given."

Then, seeing as he broke the rules as a commissioner AND a captain (both supposed to be held to way higher standards) he should be forced to resign as commissioner at the end of the season and not run for next season.   *Superwatch meaning any hint of anything dodgy and he should be stood down as commissioner...

Cannot speak for other captains. The fact that only elfi and I bid for him is telling though
OLTP,3cork8,HeikkiKovalainen,2,Sat Jul 11 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Not as a mod, Hoog told people bleach's IP said Melbourne. I checked it and it said China. I thought Hoog was lying to people so other captains would overspend. I called Hoog out on it, and he then pointed out to me that his last used IP said China, but the other 99 games he played that day said Melbourne - which I hadn't thought to check. At that point I confirmed what Hoog said was true, that bleach had IPs on his account, on the same day, that said both China and Melbourne.  Later on Bleach sent us a pic of a computer in China with tagpro on it that I shared around.  Later on after the draft when someone in main lobby asked me directly - ""Is bleach actually in China?"", I responded ""I'd be amazed if he missed a minute of season 4."""

Once games start, you basically forget about the $100 cap and just look at how much money you have left (eg, $1 after your team costed $99).  After the first game player prices will change. If you want to trade one player out for another, you need to have enough money to do so. So if you have $1 left and you want to trade out a player worth $10, the player you trade in needs to be $11 or under.  If the player you're trading in is cheaper than the one you're trading out, eg. you sell a player that's $10 and buy a player that's $9, you keep that extra $1 (so you'd have $2 left for next week)."

OLTP,3bh7po,flappytowel,19,Mon Jun 29 05:21:49 2015 UTC,"People complaining about the fact that we chose 6 teams because of a lack of competent captains, please point out the potential competent captains in terms of ability, free time, commitment and experience. Once you've racked your brain you'll find nothing.  Yes it's correct that there are players that are decent and missing out on being drafted altogether, but how is this a bad thing from a (unbiased) league point of view? It ensures that all players drafted are of top quality, which we haven't seen in any of the previous seasons. It should mean that all players are committed, and hey, if it turns out they aren't committed, there's plenty to choose from in the Free Agency pool. We haven't been in a position before where both Majors and Minors will be competitive, so we intend to take advantage of that.  We could have designed the league so that everyone who signed up would make a team, but how is this an improvement? Increasing the number of teams for this season would result in an unbalanced, unorganised, and therefore unenjoyable league. And any more numbers per team than what it is now would be way too much work for captains among other things.  It's the best decision for the league this season to have what we chose, and in my opinion we compromised somewhat by increasing the team sizes to 12. In season 5 increasing to 10/12/15 teams or 3 leagues may indeed be the best decision, but why bring it up now? We still have months until this season ends, let alone the next one beginning.   We intend to have competitions/semi-competitive games running outside of OLTP, yet still related, for the players in a team who don't play in either of the competitive leagues as well as all the Free Agents.  I understand some people are just salty/looking for drama to amuse themselves, but we basically had none of this negative discussion come up at any point before the draft. There is no rational and responsible way to place blame on anyone. Stay committed, stay active, try to keep improving, and you will get your opportunities. If you're going to stop playing TagPro/being a member of the community now because you didn't get drafted, you probably didn't deserve to be part of the league anyway. It's harsh, but you get out what you put in.   Wolas, I give you permission to downvote me."

My position is ""participation results in maximum interest"".   Obviously the amount of people actually IN OLTP/oLTP means interest will be higher, but it extends beyond that. The more people who are in the leagues means the more of their friends they will introduce to the league.    Increasing the number of teams for this season would result in an unbalanced, unorganised, and therefore unenjoyable league.     How so? On face value, I disagree. Where there is a will, there is a way.    Why bring it up now?   Because right now we have multiple quality veteran players effectively sitting on the outside of OLTP with nothing to do. Giving them something to start thinking about now may be the difference between them sticking around, or not sticking around.    If you're going to stop playing TagPro/being a member of the community now because you didn't get drafted, you probably didn't deserve to be part of the league anyway.

OLTP,3bh7po,elfitzo,6,Mon Jun 29 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"Cheers for the response.   Obviously the amount of people actually IN OLTP/oLTP means interest will be higher, but it extends beyond that. The more people who are in the leagues means the more of their friends they will introduce to the league.   I don't see how this is a counter argument to what you quoted. I never stated the aim of the league this season was to generate the most possible interest. Whilst we do have it in mind, we attempt to do it through other methods (already seen with the Snake Draft, write-ups etc.) rather than jeapordise the quality of the league through too many teams and/or players per team. And I don't think anyone can say with 100% conviction that the previous seasons have been competitive and at their potential. This season we have the greatest chance of achieving that for the first time, in both Minors and Majors. From there we build up.   Because right now we have multiple quality veteran players effectively sitting on the outside of OLTP with nothing to do. Giving them something to start thinking about now may be the difference between them sticking around, or not sticking around.   Which players can be considered as 'veterans' that missed out? Only 3 players have competed in more than 1 season of OLTP actually missed out. Reg - who intended to be an FA anyways; Hyphae - who signed up last minute and stated he wasn't sure on OLTP; and NDF - who has been in and out of mumble and didn't show up to any of the tryouts from what I saw.  Everyone else has only ever competed in 1 season of OLTP or less. No veterans there. And moreover there's things to do. TagPro and our community is a lot more than competing in OLTP.   I don't think anyone is suggesting that people will leave ""because I didn't get drafted"" in some form of temper tantrum. This is more about organic interest and participation.   Wasn't pointing fingers at you, but people have done it in the past and I imagine would have done it for this draft as well. Honestly, looking at the list again, there really aren't many committed and active players who have missed out. iTag and Flume are the most active, and they'll be sticking around and keeping involved. People knew the numbers and rosters long in advance, if they legitimately had an issue with it, it should have been raised."
OLTP,3bh7po,SublimeVibe,10,Mon Jun 29 09:04:16 2015 UTC,"I really do need to read stuff in full haha. I was on the fence (and like, sitting there really chilled, very impartial either way), now I totally see your decisions to do this, and why you have done so.

OLTP,3bh7po,TagWolas,-2,Mon Jun 29 07:27:57 2015 UTC,"My only concern is that without game time some people may get bored and leave. Disregarding any opposing comment assuming it's salt isn't going to help anyone. Obviously captains and top majors haven't seen any issues with it, they're the ones that get to have the fun.  ""If you're going to stop being a member of the community now because you didn't get drafted you probably didn't deserve to be part of the league anyway"".   You have to remember that there is now heaps of people that aren't going to partake in the fun that is oltp. OLTP isn't just about having a legit league, it's also about sustaining the community. I can understand how not getting drafted can take the fun out of tagpro, that doesn't mean they don't deserve to play. Have a heart.   Admit you took the lazy way out. Increasing the teams Keeping the same sized teams as last season would only result in an unbalanced, unorganised, and therefore unenjoyable league if you're a not good a good commissioner and you don't know what you're doing, which is what you must be admitting."
OLTP,3bh7po,FP4H,4,Mon Jun 29 08:20:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why Wolas is getting downvoted here, as he is spot on. Especially with this comment;   Obviously captains and top majors haven't seen any issues with it, they're the ones that get to have the fun.   Please be careful of not letting your positions in the community blind you to perspectives of those who aren't where you are."
OLTP,3bh7po,Ultimatum13,11,Mon Jun 29 23:30:15 2015 UTC,"I think you and I have pretty different views of the point of OLTP. In my eyes, the purpose of OLTP is to always to be an uncompromisingly competitive tagpro league. If OLTP isn't competitive, there's no point. It is also not the commissioners job to satisfy everybody in the community, just to run a league comprised of the best players Oceania has to offer. It's also my view that majors trumps all. A change in majors to facilitate some change in majors is not worth it if it negatively effects majors.  When you consider the first round of the snake draft, most of those players are currently not at the same competitive quality as the auction draft players (huehuehue i.e. me), adding another team therefore would dilute the skill of the majors teams and a decrease in skill comes with a decrease in competition which goes against what OLTP is trying to accomplish.  It's not the comissioners job to get everybody drafted, maintaining competition is their job. In my view, if a player doesn't get drafted the fault does not in any way lie with the comissioners."
OLTP,3bh7po,elfitzo,5,Tue Jun 30 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If we had ~25 more dedicated people in the community then that would probably be enough for another division, which would probably start off at the quality of  S2 minors and then improve in subsequent seasons. But at the moment theres only a few (<10) active people who missed out and at best you could get a weekly PUG going. With the OCon idea, that would only work if people from OLTP got involved, something which the comissioners were really against."
OLTP,3bh7po,A_K_o_V_A,4,Tue Jun 30 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"To clarify, we're ok with OCon running alongside OLTP, but it will become difficult under the current OCon system for it to be any fair/fun unless there are restrictions on OLTP players.   Needs to be a major revamp in OCon if it is to be what people think it can/will be. Players who were drafted but don't necessarily compete should have the option to play in OCon imo, with some sort of sister team integration.   But yeah, I think I saw someone say OCon here is basically taken as a joke whereas overseas it's pretty serious. In order for Oceanic to achieve that, OCon needs to change significantly and we'd need a much larger committed player base than what we have now. The reason it's successful overseas is because it's run better and the numbers are there, so they can afford to take it seriously. OCon is pretty much designed to be the OLTP hangover that some people despise it to be; if you hate it, change it."
OLTP,3bh7po,smackmesideways,8,Tue Jun 30 03:06:40 2015 UTC,"Each team has about 4 players that probably won't get game time each week, right? I reckon if each team (that wanted to) entered a team into Ocon and filled any subs positions with FAs or other minors players who could fill in should they need to that it'd work out. They could plan to verse the team they're versing in OLTP/oLTP (or any team, I suppose) and have a simultaneously run season of some sort.  Obviously it would be run completely separately from OLTP/oLTP and wouldn't need any commissioner involvement at all. If games didn't have enough players or needed to be rescheduled or whatever then no problem, it wouldn't be a big deal.   The fair/fun part of the competition would be entirely down to how the people running OCon decided to run it I guess.   To the people not getting game time each week it might be the kind of thing they need to keep them active/ prove their worth and get minors game time."
OLTP,3bh7po,swagpotato,6,Tue Jun 30 21:51:05 2015 UTC,Great idea. It's pretty unrealistic that all the minors players will get game time every week/fortnight because captains want their minors teams to be the best possible.   Getting drafted to a team means nothing if you aren't even going to get game time. That's when numbers diminish and captains struggle to field minors teams because the minors who don't play don't feel valued at all.   Every player should be able to play and experience competitive tagpro no matter how bad they are.
OLTP,3bh7po,smackmesideways,3,Wed Jul 1 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"That's bullshit, I gave you plenty of game time. How could you not feel valued!?"
OLTP,3bh7po,Ultimatum13,2,Thu Jul 2 19:45:04 2015 UTC,Have we met?
OLTP,3bh7po,Alleviation,2,Thu Jul 2 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"I quite like the idea of this, although as Roly said perhaps without the sister team integration as it could be complicated by availability issues and other stuff. It will give  players who don't get gametime a chance to play as well as giving gametime to players who didnt get drafted(like SMACK ;) )"
OLTP,3bh7po,Achler,5,Wed Jul 1 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"Just to add onto this, we're discussing the option of running Ocon through the season for those that didn't make it into teams and for the ~4 players that won't be playing minors.  While I think the sister team concept is pretty cool, if we go down this road we are going to need some rules and amendments from the commissioners, because as much as we want to help facilitate competitive playing on all levels, we don't want to hinder O/oLTP.   Realistically I think the best bet moving forward would be to get some oLTP teams together, restrict the players playing to the benched +1 minors player and allow for free agent teams to be created with a rotating door sort of system if they get picked up by other teams. Thoughts, different thread, msg? Whatever :P"
OLTP,3bh7po,AussieGuy96,12,Tue Jun 30 22:26:13 2015 UTC,"I think OContenders should be given a shot in the arm from the reduced number of OLTP/oLTP players this season. Can someone please moderate the sub, and can we as a community give it some more credit?  as you said, this season even drafted players might no see game time, and practising with the team will only get you so far. Competitive play is very different to practice.   So if you are not happy with how much game time you are getting (if you were drafted) or if you want to get some actual competitive play under your ball, get an OCon team together and give it a crack.  If you are still not convinced that OCon is a good idea to get noticed/drafted, please note The Flag Bearers picked up 3 people from the same OCon team, that was not a coincidence.   Competitive play will improve your skills individually, improve your team work and potentially if you find the right players that you have good chemistry with we end up in the scenario where 1+1=3"
OLTP,3bh7po,drinkbleachtag,6,Wed Jul 1 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"I always find it a bit annoying how little people think of Ocon. The reputation of other regions contenders competitions are often as high as the actual 'league' system in their respective continents.   As one of the mods of ocon not participating in oltp, I'm going to see about continuing ocon during the season, and see if we can improve the competition in any way."
OLTP,3bh7po,AussieGuy96,4,Mon Jun 29 05:34:18 2015 UTC,I like USContenders because you have teams that have been together for many seasons and you sometimes end up with better rivalries than league play. For some reason that just hasn't happened in O'Con; maybe because the teams disband every season and there isn't much continuity.
OLTP,3bh7po,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems like a fair point to bring up. I haven't been around for multiple seasons of oCon, so could you tell me if teams are forced to disband after each season or it's something that happens organically as each season starts?"
OLTP,3bh7po,AussieGuy96,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:50:13 2015 UTC,"The rules may have changed since I remember, but generally teams get dissolved if they don't play for a certain period.   It's really a combination of people losing interest during OLTP, then teams are forced to disband, then when OLTP finishes there's a little OCon push and everyone is forced to make new teams and start all over.  Not everyone wants to stay with the same people forever, but if the teams were allowed to stay together during OLTP and then pick up where they left off once OLTP finishes, it might encourage OCon to remain more competitive. You still keep challenges open so teams don't get to keep their spots, but at least it develops some continuity."
OLTP,3bh7po,bugket,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:55:38 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good suggestion. I'll talk to the other oCon mods about it.

OLTP,3bh7po,A_K_o_V_A,4,Mon Jun 29 05:58:53 2015 UTC,Fully agree with you there arc.
OLTP,3bh7po,VehementVexation,3,Mon Jun 29 15:39:48 2015 UTC,Yeah Ocon is better suited for a number of players who signed up to OLTP just to be involved rather than wanting to dedicate the same amount of time as other people in the competition are willing to put in. It'd be great if Ocon could continue on in some form during the OLTP season.  But yeah I agree oCon is a stepping stone that pretty much every player in Majors has been apart of first. It should be taken more seriously as a way to get noticed/ drafted.
OLTP,3bh7po,fooize,6,Mon Jun 29 12:23:05 2015 UTC,"From the commissioners perspective of this season, we have been aiming for this 'fair' objective. And i think from the results of the draft we got it. We knew the risks would involve a higher number of players who will miss out because of this change, and we are sincerelly sorry this. The price of not involving players is a result of the lack of captaincy interest we had this season. elfitzo is only captain this season because of this. Without him we would only have had 5 competent captains.  We weighed all the options and believed that for a successful season, the route we took with team/player numbers should have an optimum outcome. Future seasons will be up to the next captains, and hopefully by then we will have more people with the interest of being a captain. And of course this will push for more teams, more involvement etc etc... :)"
OLTP,3bh7po,A_K_o_V_A,10,Mon Jun 29 06:17:54 2015 UTC,"I think I might be one of the few that supports the 6 teams/12 players model. Less teams makes for a more even, higher skill level on the rosters. Each team playing each other twice is IMO the best way to get the best possible playoffs, and the most exciting season.  FWIW I think it'd be better for us to see how the season goes in its entirety before we judge it. Not that your criticisms aren't valid, but the league might pan out a lot better than S1/2/3, we just don't know yet."
OLTP,3bh7po,bugket,7,Mon Jun 29 06:44:00 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm really hyped for this season and I know a lot of other people are as well. It's gonna be a really interesting and exciting. Every team in both Majors and Minors seem really strong and quite balanced on paper.   There will be a few people that miss out each week but I'd suggest that each team enters a team into Ocontenders so that the players still get game time in a competitive environment. That system could work really well (And could include free agents) if people got behind it.

OLTP,3bh7po,patI00,0,Mon Jun 29 06:15:14 2015 UTC,"Just my thoughts but like elfi said, people who actually wanted to get drafted and made an effort to get drafted did get drafted. Rookies like myself, SpleenBean, DanteExum, Shandor, Pop Pop, Dylza and yagerbomb proved our worth to captains through a tiny bit of mumbling and PUG involvement. iTag was unlucky to miss out, but if i'm being honest it's because of his bad attitude and hesitance to accept advice from his peers if anything. On the other hand some players with past oltp experience missed out because they hadn't been seen for months. If you haven't been on mumble or shown up to tryouts or even PUBs, what incentive does a captain have to draft you, regardless of ability or experience. My point is that the goal is to make the league more competitive, and the commissioners did a brilliant job of it. At the moment there aren't enough people missing out to make a third tier league, although this could be a possibility next season. 30 people missed out on the league, and out of those, 15/30 I have never seen on mumble, leaving 15 or so players, which is not enough to have a new league at this point in time. One could argue that we should aim to include everyone since we're playing a game online for the fun of it, but some people want to have a competitive league so there has to be a balance.   As for the larger rosters, I think that's a brilliant idea. More people get a chance to be involved in the league(and practice) whilst ensuring that the roster is large enough to avoid having 3v4s and availability issues."

OLTP,3auxp6,Fog_Terminator,4,Wed Jun 24 00:06:52 2015 UTC,"Here's how the draft is going to work according to the OLTP S4 Rules document (I was a bit confused about how there would be snake and auction drafts and I assumed some others might be too):     (a) Before the draft, each of the 6 captains will rank all the other captains in terms of skill and competency as a captain from 1 to 6, with 1 being least skilful and competent. The average ranking will then be determined for each captain. (b) The draft will take place on the 28th of June at 6pm AEST. (c) The deadline for players to sign up for the draft is 11:59pm AEST, 14th June. After this point, players will not be permitted to enter the draft, but may still sign up as free agents, subject to Article IV, Section II. (d) The draft will begin as an auction draft, and will continue until each team has five players on their roster, including the captain. Each team will be assigned 100 coins to spend. At the start, each captain will nominate a player. Captains will do this in the order that they were ranked, from least to most competent. (e) The remainder of the draft will be a standard draft in snake order, which means that the order of the draft will reverse at the start of every round. The snake draft competency order will be determined by the most remaining coins to least remaining coins, and in the event of people equal in coins remaining, it will default to the order observed from Article III, Section I, subsection (a). This ranking will decide who has first choice for where they wish to be placed in the draft, followed by 2nd lowest, 3rd lowest etc. as seen in previous iterations of the Snake Draft. (f) For each pick, a captain will select a player, who will then join the team he was selected by. Captains have three minutes to make their decision throughout the draft.

Because my Download speed (on same test) maxes out at 7.9mb/s... which it clearly is not... and upload speed is roughly 0.50mbps. This is notwithstanding the atrocious shitty connections ive been getting over the past 4 months, where my download speeds drop as low as 0.20mb/ps. Fucking. Telstra."
OLTP,3a9l5e,SublimeVibe,5,Thu Jun 18 11:08:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, just on the cable network. NBN won't come to my area at all. We are expected to get a cable network upgrade though (network likely to move from 100mbps to 1Gbps downloads lol).    Going off your speed test guessing your on ADSL? Distance from your local phone exchange and the quality of your phone line play a huge role in determining your speed. You'd likely have the same issues with any ISP if the line sync sucks. Only fix for that is either new phone line or NBN haha. Telstra wont replace a copper line now that they know its redundant so your basically screwed in the meantime. RIP."

OLTP,3a9l5e,TagWolas,3,Thu Jun 18 12:18:36 2015 UTC,"Na, you'll just get overdue charges and shitty credit history with Telstra. ISP terms and conditions don't have a guarantee like the home phone service does. This means if only the internet goes down they only have to do their best to fix it. This wording means they can take their time and hence piss customers around. Home phones have a legal right within Aus law attached to them hence why that shit is fixed ASAP when it goes down, otherwise you get refunded and compensated. As they are the wholesale operator of the network, this attitude affects pretty much every ISP in Australia so if its a shitty line then I would suggest moving house to one within the cable network until NBN reaches everywhere hahaha"

OLTP,3a68hm,HeikkiKovalainen,8,Thu Jun 18 06:36:13 2015 UTC,"I realise this would be responsibility put solely on the captains' shoulders but what do you guys think about having a friendly match some time each week between the teams that are versing for the extra players?  No recording of scores, no stats, no rules on who can play and who can't - basically just a pug for the players that aren't making the minors teams. Again, no restrictions on it though, of course these players are going to be on average less committed so anyone on the team can play but the point is to get the players that can't make majors or minors some game time each week.  Otherwise we're just going to end up with the same four (± one) players playing majors each week, the same four (± one) players playing minors each week and the same four (± one) players sitting out each week, getting increasingly frustrated and disillusioned."
OLTP,3a68hm,fooize,3,Thu Jun 18 04:53:22 2015 UTC,If the commissioners aren't going to make an NOLTP I'm sure the captains can arrange something.   Conditional on player activity obviously
OLTP,3a68hm,waiheke,6,Thu Jun 18 05:32:00 2015 UTC,"Please Rain, we can barely organise two games a week."
OLTP,3a68hm,HeikkiKovalainen,2,Thu Jun 18 06:00:42 2015 UTC,It could even just be a set time each week. Thursday nights at 8pm for example. All the teams play at the same time. Again if all of your inexperienced players can't rock up just play whoever.
OLTP,3a68hm,fooize,2,Thu Jun 18 06:08:27 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if it's run concurrently to majors/minors either. No streaming.   TBH I disagree with the no recording of a scores, even if the league isn't a part of OLTP proper. It's not hard to keep a league table. Obviously if the players are uncommitted enough to not keep track of scores then that won't happen. If they're that uncommitted though, a table won't matter to them anyway, so it's a self-resolving problem.   Pretty keen to make this happen."
OLTP,3a68hm,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:43:17 2015 UTC,The point in not keeping score is so people don't get pissed off and raise a fuss about one team playing their majors players each week if it turns out they drafted four uncommitted players.
OLTP,3a68hm,fooize,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:30:40 2015 UTC,Is that really an issue though? I think the anger comes from people playing majors players over minors players when minors could have played.  No-one gets mad when 3 majors play a forfeited minors game just for the stats. This is a similar situation.

OLTP,3a68hm,fooize,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:19:39 2015 UTC,Too easy. Make a minors captain and an NOLTP league captain. I haven't organised a minors game in 2 seasons bar 1 or 2.
OLTP,3a68hm,swagpotato,2,Thu Jun 18 06:40:38 2015 UTC,Did you organise any majors games?
OLTP,3a68hm,elfitzo,2,Thu Jun 18 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Everything is in a discussion phase at the moment, so can't say yes or no either way. Personally though, with 12 players I wouldn't be pushing for another competitive league. The 12 players we have on a team won't all be committed, there has always been a couple of players on a team (sometimes more) that wouldn't rock up on mumble or had IRL stuff going on that they couldn't make it to games, so with a bare minimum number of players we'll have  league that has a lot of games 2v3 or something.  Increasing the team numbers can aid this, but if we go any higher than 13 per team we run into certain non-committed players territory. I think a non-competitive league is the best solution, one without a table (as that will lead to a number of issues) and without player restriction rules, that is run somewhat parallel to OLTP.  All that said, this is merely in discussion at the moment, and might not happen at all."
OLTP,3a68hm,fooize,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:57:42 2015 UTC,"I think a non-competitive league is the best solution, one without a table (as that will lead to a number of issues) and without player restriction rules, that is run somewhat parallel to OLTP.   I agree with your overall solution here, I don't really agree with the no tables part though. What issues? It's not really that big of a deal to have a table even if you have a lot of forfeits. Like, it doesn't effect the running of the games, it's just an auxiliary document which defines the league.   FWIW, I'm sure the players themselves would like to have a table; I don't think you can presuppose that people not playing majors/minors are uncommitted enough to the point that they will not be able to attend enough games to the degree that a league table is futile. Even if it just becomes OContenders, I just don't see why you wouldn't at least attempt a rudimentary table; even if it doesn't work, who cares."
OLTP,3a68hm,elfitzo,2,Thu Jun 18 07:36:00 2015 UTC,"No because it creates issues. With 12 players there will be teams in this 'NOLTP' league that don't have players turn up. This will lead to forced substitutions from higher in the team, i.e. Majors players, and obviously that game would be incredibly one-sided. Teams might only have 8-9 players active and thus we might have 3 Majors players sub in.  This is a problem not only because it takes away the fun for everyone involved, not just the eventual losing team, but it screws it up for the winning team too. It means the table isn't legitimate. For the players that want to take the league seriously this is a major issue.   It's far better off to have it separate, non-competitive and purely a learning league.  If you remember back to S2 minors, there were players involved who cared, and those who didn't. This creates problems when the intentions of the players competing differ. Finally in S3 we had a very high majority of people committed to taking the league seriously and competitively. For S4 we will/should have 100% of the people committed and serious, because the number of committed players > number of competing players. As shown before, once we go the other way it leads to drama and a shit season for some people. By keeping it non-competitive we eliminate most of the problems."
OLTP,3a68hm,fooize,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:46:43 2015 UTC,"Good call.   In the event that you do have a lot of committed NOLTP players, enough to run a league with, not having a table might be detrimental though."
OLTP,3a68hm,elfitzo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:54:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, I just don't think it applies to our S4 situation. I would prefer to have a table and increase the competitiveness, to prepare them for the future leagues, but as it stands it won't work like that imo."

I think Avoke and bleach might have stood a chance but Avoke's been dead for the last few weeks (intentional or otherwise) and bleach is in china for a while where the ping is horrible. That leaves leddy alone at the top imo. Unsure on the price though, depends on how the captains rate everyone else available."

OLTP,39g3ct,swagpotato,4,Thu Jun 11 21:37:12 2015 UTC,The commissioners already made their decision on not giving me captaincy. There's no point trying again.
OLTP,39g3ct,3z_,2,Sat Jun 13 07:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't even understand why. You totally proved us wrong last season when you nearly missed out on captain, but then took the role, and almost had a season-winning team."
OLTP,39g3ct,A_K_o_V_A,2,Sat Jun 13 13:49:16 2015 UTC,I think you should try again.  You were active through-out the whole competition. You took our complaints about your captaincy in the previous season on board which was good. You also had a lot of problems with the commissioners last season but you were mature about it and brought your issues to us in a respectable manner. I personally wouldn't see any issue with making you a captain again.   I'm not sure of who the other people wanting to be Captain are but I'd say you're one of the most risk-free captains to choose from.
OLTP,39g3ct,Pimp-My-Alpaca,5,Sun Jun 14 00:48:55 2015 UTC,It's almost like we really wanted Bobbay to be captain this season but he couldn't because of availability issues and now he's just stirring the pot!  Article VIII - Section 1 -    (f) Purposefully creating or proliferating tension and drama between players for personal gain or the thrill of confrontation is considered to be ‘stirring the pot’.   What a jerk
OLTP,39g3ct,A_K_o_V_A,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:53:02 2015 UTC,Haha nah he isn't stirring the pot! I didn't know about the reasons he wasn't a captain :3  Bobbay sort your shit out! What's more important than Tagpro? Geez (Coming from me haha)...
OLTP,39g3ct,Pimp-My-Alpaca,3,Sun Jun 14 02:00:48 2015 UTC,It's almost like we really wanted Bobbay to be captain this season but he couldn't because of availability issues    That's literally it. Bobbay seems to think that finding a wife/working is more important than some online game

OLTP,38x3ui,iTagPro,4,Sun Jun 7 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"If there is enough support for a particular map not in OLTP rotation we are more than willing to consider that, but as it stands only the maps in OLTP rotation.   We don't want to completely restrict it to only maps that are outside of this current rotation as we feel like the majority of the best competitive maps are already in rotation. If there is a strong community push to maps outside of these, then we will definitely consider them."

OLTP,38x3ui,iTagPro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:24:43 2015 UTC,"We don't want to completely restrict it to only maps that are outside of this current rotation   No, you shouldn't. You should make each and every map available (with some obvious exceptions), including the ones in the rotation."
OLTP,38x3ui,3z_,3,Tue Jun 9 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"There is a reason those maps weren't chosen in the first place. If we felt they were good enough for our rotation they would have been in our top 10.  Furthermore, in reference to your 'surely we would make the right decision'... no."
OLTP,38x3ui,3z_,2,Mon Jun 8 12:45:40 2015 UTC,I just thought it would be a good idea coz then we can mix things up......
OLTP,38x3ui,Ultimatum13,2,Tue Jun 9 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"There is a reason those maps weren't chosen in the first place.   But how long did it take for you to decide those maps weren't worthy? There are plenty of maps that could've been so close to making it. Maybe we'll even have new maps enter rotation like Hub that you didn't get a chance to consider -- like Battery, Colours, Holy See, 45, Platypus, Hub, Transilio, Hurricane -- and more.  But the wonderful thing is that you can include the maps that are already in our rotation. There's no need to restrict it to maps that haven't been played."
OLTP,38x3ui,iTagPro,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:12:46 2015 UTC,"The fact is (as a general statement) we don't want the maps that we haven't chosen. We don't want the maps you have listed. We are giving the community the choice in a way that we are all happy with. And of course, as i mentioned, if there is very strong support from a large portion of the community for particular maps then we will likely consider those too. But as it stands, the rotation maps are the maps we are happy with in finals. Others we are not happy with."
OLTP,38x3ui,fooize,2,Tue Jun 9 05:04:38 2015 UTC,Then you should make it non-OLTP maps that you've selected -- it's what we did last season.   ...  in a way that we are all happy with.   Evidently not
OLTP,38x3ui,HeikkiKovalainen,4,Tue Jun 9 05:05:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if anything I think we shouldn't be repeating maps. That just makes it boring. There's still plenty of quality maps that aren't in rotation to choose from."

I know I wouldn't nominate the person I would want most on my team.

OLTP,38d8me,3z_,6,Wed Jun 3 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"For a quick recap, incase you missed yesterdays post, here is the current rotation, up to this point.   Should this not feature the first four maps instead of two?  Also, I like the map selection (so far!), though I think it's odd that you've opted to use four consecutive maps with similar styles. The maps you use are important, but the order in which they're played are equally important, so as to keep each round different from the last.  What's the mindset behind the current order?"
OLTP,38d8me,Pimp-My-Alpaca,5,Wed Jun 3 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"Since teams are playing each other twice we decided that our main focus on the order should be ensuring that teams played each other on two maps that balance well with each other. For example we wouldn't want teams playing on Event Horizion and Gloryhole (hint hint) as they are both a very similar style and aren't testing a variety of skills. A pairing of Event Horizion and Figure 8 would be better in this case.  That being said, I don't necessarily see how these 4 have similar styles, especially star."
OLTP,38d8me,3z_,5,Wed Jun 3 14:11:42 2015 UTC,"Makes sense -- thanks for the response.  I'm saying Wormy/Pilot play similarly (fast-paced, chaotic, chase-heavy) and Star/Constriction (Defensive, slow-paced, chase-heavy)."

If we do release POTM and POTW awards that are completely separate from stats it takes away from the excitement of the 3-2-1 system. If we keep them in line with stats then we essentially change nothing.  I don't think community involvement on this one is the way to go."
OLTP,36dcn4,VehementVexation,6,Tue May 19 03:06:53 2015 UTC,Auction Hype! :D
OLTP,36dcn4,HeikkiKovalainen,3,Mon May 18 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"No Friday night games? Starting in July?  I think it'd be a good idea to add in a rule about captains must keep 1 tagcoin for every spot remaining on their roster to fill. So they have to auction draft three players, they need to spend 98 coins or less on the first so they still can bid for two other players.  Also I know this is a terrible time to bring this up, but I'm going to put this out there (don't worry won't argue for it) but what about auctioning off the first three or four minors players as well with tagcoins reset? It'd give the minors some fun, feel like they're important too, hype up their competition and I can't imagine people like ThisIsJake being hyped about the auction draft at all since it doesn't affect him. But if we do the first couple of minors too, which wouldn't be hard to add on at all, would just be cool for their comp as well."
OLTP,36dcn4,elfitzo,4,Mon May 18 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"No Friday night games is correct, the option wasn't used at all last season and we feel as though it might be difficult to get streamers on Friday nights sometimes. Better off to get rid, if we run into problems we as commissioners can make exceptions but don't see the need.  Yes we're starting in July, with the draft set at 28/06. We see this as ideal as most people's exams finish in/by June, be it School or Uni, but it's not so far away so as to lose people's interests completely by the time we begin. It gives us enough time to hopefully get everything down and setup well, as well as sign-ups open for about a month, plenty of time for everyone to consider their OLTP future. Not sure whether you're questioning it being too early/late, but I find it very unlikely it will be changed. If you've got an issue (fuck off) be more specific and I'll let you know.   I think it'd be a good idea to add in a rule about captains must keep 1 tagcoin for every spot remaining on their roster to fill. So they have to auction draft three players, they need to spend 98 coins or less on the first so they still can bid for two other players.   Nope, no need. Bidding for players begins at 0 (unless a captain wishes to choose a different starting value), so captains will not be required to keep a coin leftover to bid on a player, they can bid all 100 on ThisIsJake if they like, just puts them at a disadvantage for the rest of the draft, as all other captains can then outbid them on any future nominations.  As for your minors suggestion, we don't feel it's the right move, it's too convoluted. Where do we reset coins? Up to how many players in minors? Can captains really value all these minors players? Can they be bothered valuing every player? It's just way too much, more work on the captains and commissioners than is necessary.   I'd argue we don't really have a solid base yet with Minors, so even if we were to jump to Auction for the Minors competition, it wouldn't be the season to try it now. Majors is a slightly different story, in that it's well ironed, only issues created are by the players, not the system.  I also think that hype will be improved overall this season, with all the additions expected, that if you're suggesting to choose Auction merely for '!hype' then you are out of luck.  It's not about 'our' comp and 'their' comp. It is 1 team which competes in 2 competitions, so again, not only do I see it as not necessary, I think it would be an immature move to make considering the problems that already exist(ed) in minors over the last 2 seasons. We have a solid foundation overall, slowly getting rid of problems. Let's build and improve on it rather than build a new foundation next-door, and making that change is the first step towards that.  I could go on and on regarding this, but tbh I wouldn't be changing much from here unless we come across a glaring problem.  EDIT: If you happen to have School/Uni/Holidays in June/July through to October, which is the finish, all I can say is basically suck it up, put it down in your sign-up and make captains aware. The dates will not be changed for 1 person or a handful of people."

OLTP,368o42,Alleviation,9,Sun May 17 06:14:09 2015 UTC,"Six captains sounds ideal. Hyper competitive league, no byes, fixed free agency and the potential to test out auction draft with competent people is the kind of injection OLTP needs.  Some suggestions/problems though:   Only increase team space by 1. This is going to create a lot of game time problems, especially in minors. The more competitive minor teams will want to put their best team forward, but will have some obligation about playing the benched ones. This will also create a better free agency. Although numbers have slightly grown, this season we won't have to ask literally every single person ever to sign up. Several people, especially at the bottom end of the draft played for the sake of it. Consider making it a season and a half. I know this may lead to some unfair match ups but it will also shorten the season which was a little bit of a problem in the past. Not saying this is the way to go, but worth discussion from others."
OLTP,368o42,fooize,1 point,Sun May 17 06:36:56 2015 UTC,"also shorten the season which was a little bit of a problem in the past. Not saying this is the way to go, but worth discussion from others.   short seasons feel like more of an issue, rather than the season being too long. I think this problem is very much tied to the disparity of teams in s1/2/3."
OLTP,368o42,fooize,4,Mon May 18 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"Repost for ease and to centralise discussion here:  1: Less captains mean that the captains are more likely to be of an even skill level, unlike seasons past where getting a core of experienced captains has been pretty easy, then the captain pool has been stretched out by captains not at the same skill level. Less of an issue with 6 captains, and makes the season more fair from the get-go; so less dominant teams are likely.  2: Each team playing each other twice is a lot more hyped. If each game was played on a diff. style map (like Star the first fixture then Velocity the next as an example) I don't see the results being exactly the same each time, which makes the games compelling to watch. Also, rivalries (like 12R vs C22, for example) don't get to develop when you only play a team once per season.  3: At the end of the season the ladder is more fair and representative of the skill because you get a better sample of each team's strength against each other rather than just the ability to stomp weaker teams, combined with having better captains. I'm not confident putting this in text but feel free to find me on Mumble to discuss this.  4: This solves a lot of minor's issues. Because there'll be less players in majors, there'll be more players to fill minors spots, and less majors playing in minors etc. Also more players to facilitate trades if other teams have availability issues and need players. Minors players also get a lot more chance to develop seeing as the season will be more intensive, on a wider variety of maps (hopefully), meaning that there would be more fluidity between majors and minors (true fluidity, not majors players playing in minors).  5: The playoffs are worth a lot more. The playoffs would be the top 4 teams of the 6, which going in to the season are a more concentrated sample of the best players on Diameter. Across 10 games, making the top 4 requires consistency when you play each team twice, across different styles of maps. The teams in the playoffs would be better, having had 10 regular season games and 3 months of practice and scrimming. I think this would allow us to bridge the gap between having just 'good' teams and teams that are really great, just because of the increased season length; and cachet of being in the top 4 across a more intensive season.  I'd also like to see a double elimination style playoff structure but perhaps that's a comment for a different post...  FWIW, I think if you went with snake draft, because of the decreased amount of captains, a snake draft would be more fair than with 8, which might be a factor in deciding whether you want to run auction or snake. Of course auction is still the better choice hue.  also love the discussion. keep it up"
OLTP,368o42,Vinsanity9,6,Sun May 17 06:23:58 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything here.  Playing teams twice would be cool, as it gives the loser of the previous match up a chance at redemption and the winners to assert their dominance.  I think the biggest question would be whether we want the league to be inclusive of most people by increasing the roster spots or keep it as is/maybe +1 to have minors a more competitive league where you can consistently play your top 4."
OLTP,368o42,virnetics-tagpro,2,Sun May 17 08:12:21 2015 UTC,"I would prefer the latter (maybe +1). Also agree with the reduction of teams, agree will all of rain's points plus I think it provides a necessary change to revitalise OLTP."
OLTP,368o42,HeikkiKovalainen,2,Sun May 17 09:34:23 2015 UTC,"Only thing I'd add is that I think it'd be better to do away with finals if we have a two match per team season.  And I doubt anyone's going to agree with that so if we have to do finals, I really think it should just be top three. Only knocking two teams out after ten weeks of play seems a bit weird."
OLTP,368o42,elfitzo,2,Sun May 17 09:28:19 2015 UTC,"You know my stance on this idea as well, but to say we merely knock two teams out is inaccurate. The league would be the battle for positions throughout, not just battle for top 4.I agree it would need a revisit, as sooo many other things would with this change, but I think there's more excitement in it than you give it credit for."
OLTP,368o42,HeikkiKovalainen,2,Sun May 17 09:49:02 2015 UTC,"I don't deny excitement, that's the whole point of a finals series. But I feel at the end of the day there's a reason why we all can appreciate the idea of versing each team twice - because it would more reliably show which team is best. However giving a team that performed below the league's average over ten weeks the chance at the title seems silly to me.  I mean hell why not make the games a minute long? Or first to cap? Because it doesn't give us overall which team was best, despite the added excitement.  But look when push comes to shove, if one team plays every team twice this season, doesn't lose a match, then loses two of the three matches in finals, I think not only is it ludicrous to possibly declare 4th place (of 6) champions but to say this hypothetical awesome team wasn't the best in S4 is just silly.  I mean look, I'm just making the same arguments as to why I wouldn't like to see a finals series in EPL. Why would you disagree with this?  Isn't the ultimate goal to declare the best team the best, and looking at performance over the whole season (assuming two games) the best way of doing this?"
OLTP,368o42,fooize,1 point,Sun May 17 10:03:20 2015 UTC,"However giving a team that performed below the league's average over ten weeks the chance at the title seems silly to me.   Why not? They have to play 1st or 3rd, and if they win they deserve to be in the playoffs. If they don't, the seeding works as it should.   Isn't the ultimate goal to declare the best team the best, and looking at performance over the whole season (assuming two games) the best way of doing this?   No, because you only really narrow it down to rough estimates of team ability. Look at S1/S2/S3; each season the top 4 of the ladder has been the roughly best teams. I don't think you could argue in any of those seasons, knowing how they turned out (apart from maybe S1) that the top 4's at the end of the reg. season were the true indication of how good the teams were. However, at the end of the playoffs, which concentrated the matchups in to just those top 4's, each time the better team won out overall.  You could probably improve the likelihood of the better team winning overall with a double elimination playoff system."

No, because you only really narrow it down to rough estimates of team ability.    Unlike finals which bring in a large amount of variance and luck. More games against more teams is a better determiner of the true standings than finals matches. Hell I mean I don't think anyone is going to claim Bad Balls was a better team than Ballbusters, but every time they versed, Bad Balls had their number. If 50SBB wasn't in the league, I think it'd be silly to give BB3 the crown despite Ballbusters being the clear op team in the season.   Look at S1/S2/S3; each season the top 4 of the ladder has been the roughly best teams.    Exactly, and this wasn't always the outcome in the finals. Forgive me for saying but I think the OP teams in s2 were klosec's and bleach's, yet your team walked away with the title solely because we were using a finals series. So it leaves us in this conundrum where people argue over the best team in s2. Was it klosecs, bleach's or the team that actually won it? My vote would go to who was top the standings at the end of the season.  Hell you watch soccer don't you? Would you want the EPL champion to be determined by finals?"

Playoffs are insanely easy to do any way you want (e.g double elim or single elim) with powers of 2, 4 is just easiest.    More games against more teams is a better determiner of the true standings than finals matches.   I disagree. A lot more preparation and just general motivation goes in to finals matches because they're worth more, and they're a spectacle.   At the end of the day, I think having a longer game on a different style map against someone evenly matched is a much better way to end the season, both from a competitiveness perspective and a spectator's one.    So it leaves us in this conundrum where people argue over the best team in s2. Was it klosecs, bleach's or the team that actually won it? My vote would go to who was top the standings at the end of the season.   without trying to be arrogant we demolished both of those teams when we finally had our full strength line up haha    Would you want the EPL champion to be determined by finals?   Different sports, man. You wouldn't want the NBA champion to be decided by the 82 game regular season would you?   In football, it's a bit different, because the culture of the sport is such that changing the league will probably result in a schism, and it's just been that way for a long, long time of English football.   Overall, obviously, if I were remaking the EPL today, I would put in a playoff system. I think it's the most competitive, and most spectacular, way to run the league."

The difference between 6th and 4th place should realistically come down to the final round to decide finals. As opposed to an 8 team league where the final four was decided by the second last round and the bottom 3 teams were eliminated much earlier.   However I think it might be worthwhile shortening finals week to two weeks and just make 1v4 and 2v3. Winners to to the Grand Final."
OLTP,368o42,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Mon May 18 00:16:28 2015 UTC,"There's no way you can really say this. Just because there'll be an overall increase in skill across the teams doesn't mean the discrepancy between the teams will in turn decrease as well.  Furthermore if there is, like you suggest, more even teams across the board then in order to properly differentiate the best from the rest you'll need to minimise luck and variance. The way you do this is by either multiple matches between the top teams on different maps (can't see this being done by the comms) or do away with finals and go by league standings."
OLTP,368o42,dopesayo,4,Mon May 18 02:48:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think 7 teams will work purely because of the fixtures. I think 6 games for the season is too short and 12 games is too long.  Having 6 teams play each-other twice for 10 games for the season looks great to me, and benefits such as a more competitive league, better captains, less forfeits and things look great, but I'm worried about dropping from 8 teams last season to 6 teams this season.  With the drop from 8 to 6, you lose 20 roster spots already, and with the new players coming next season, you're going to have a lot of players missing out on a spot. Sure, the league would be more competitive, but it really affects the growth of the league because the newer and less-skilled players will be turned away because they either didn't get drafted and don't want to wait around hoping to get signed as a free agent, or because they're not getting any playing time on their teams.  I also feel like being the champion of the season is worth a little less with the drop from 6 to 8 teams. I know Haxball is a different game, but the way both of our communities run things is very similar, and I've been apart of an 8-team league and a 6-team league before, and it doesn't feel like it means as much to beat 5 other teams as opposed to 7.   I also think the regular season doesn't have as much meaning either, as we play a 10-week season and an easy 4 out of 6 teams make the playoffs. We could reduce it to 3 out of 6, but I'm not sure how the community would feel about the playoffs structure in that case. Ideally the team who finishes 1st would automatically head to the final, and the teams who finish 2nd and 3rd would verse each-other to make the final. There may be another way, that's just what I've experienced before."
OLTP,368o42,3z_,2,Sun May 17 10:14:10 2015 UTC,I don't think 7 teams will work purely because of the fixtures.   We had seven teams in S1 and it worked out fine. What's the issue with the fixtures you have?

If that is the case then maybe dropping to 7 teams instead of 6 is a better idea, as it allows us to have a smaller decrease in teams to see how it goes, and if it works then we could consider dropping to 6 the season after. If it doesn't work, it doesn't cause as many problems as dropping to 6.  My thoughts anyway."

OLTP,368o42,3z_,4,Mon May 18 05:08:40 2015 UTC,"I think having a bye in the first season was really nice. It gave teams to have a week-off, a bit of a breather, and the only team that really got an advantage was BB2 (who, because of the mid-season draft, ended up having three weeks to practise on a single map and beat the top team for that season).  But, since we're not doing a mid-season draft, that can't really be an issue.  The season would still be a reasonable 7 rounds (each team playing 6), so there wouldn't be any changes to the overall length of the league (assuming the playoff structure didn't change).  But some people might get a bit angsty having an uneven number of teams. God forbid, right?  edit:  In response to potentially battling each team twice throughout the season: this leaves us with 11 rounds. Assuming this much commitment was a fair thing to ask of everyone, we're left with a bit of a dilemma with the map rotation:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ec-ePnFQVahrO3CNpawvAHqsyLkbzBwm--JreO8DH2A/edit#gid=0  Here is what the rotation might look like with 11 rounds. We are left with seven defensive maps, three offensive, and two balanced. These are probably most likely agreed upon to be the best competitive maps we can choose from at this point (of course, there are some alternatives available, such as DZ, Battery, Hurricane, but then we end up with a bias towards controversial maps rather than offensive/defense balance).  So, when considering whether or not we want to have 11 rounds, we have to keep in mind:   Are people going to commit for that long (3 months + finals + midseason break) Will people be willing to devote more time each week, if we were to do two games per week? Is the map rotation going to be balanced enough to keep the games fair?   I don't think we can actually meet any of those three criteria. By extension, I don't think that 11 rounds would make for a ""good"" season."

OLTP,368o42,A_K_o_V_A,2,Sun May 17 10:29:06 2015 UTC,I think less teams will increase the quality of the competition a lot (especially with our numbers). Versing teams twice in a season would be really cool too.  I think having 6 teams that verse each other twice can be a realistic goal.  If it seems like the season is too long then you could do something like planing a weekend where each team has two games on that weekend. (Preferably not playing the same team twice).  And hopefully creating a more flexible FA system would help ease the later stages of the competition on the chance that there is a team that have given up hope. (But hopefully all the teams would be relatively evenly balanced and the competition would be a lot closer).  7 teams being run as normal with a by would probably be fine too.  I definitely think the idea of reducing teams is worth looking into.
OLTP,368o42,VehementVexation,1 point,Sun May 17 09:34:44 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of playing 2 games in a weekend. But then we run into issues like teams not being able to practice two maps (if a team feels they need to practice more on map because of the weeks competition lined up for that team), organisation and availabilities of all players to be able to make it two games and same time as opposition players. Mostly depends on player availability which we simply cant predict"
OLTP,368o42,Alleviation,1 point,Sun May 17 11:46:27 2015 UTC,"Would it be worth doing a double round after the mid season break? That gives teams two weeks to practise maps and a taste of what's to come in the finals should they make it that far. Also kind of breaks up the monotony of week in week out games.

Honestly though, if you're going to do this I think 7 is a better option, and it could still accommodate a smaller increase of players per team to compensate."

OLTP,368o42,drinkbleachtag,0,Sun May 17 06:37:09 2015 UTC,"The past 2 seasons I've been on sides that could've easily gone through the season with 8 players. Adding more minors players would only widen the gap between those getting game time and those that aren't. If you're going to increase team sizes to 14 then I think there needs to be rules in place to ensure all players have the opportunity to play because it will naturally be harder for captains to share game time around, even those with the best intentions."
OLTP,368o42,fooize,1 point,Sun May 17 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you insofar as if your goal is to get people the most possible playing time, then you'd obviously need some rule in place to ensure that everyone is fairly represented.  It does, however, sacrifice the competitiveness of the minors league; the rules stipulating that captains must deviate from playing the best 4 players possible could compromise the competitiveness of the competition.  I guess a good solution would be like a development league, but we definitely don't have the #'s to sustain that at the moment."

I'd say I'm not going to be the only one.   I think (if we had every team play each other twice) the season will drag. I think it's going to be annoying for the players who thought they'd have a chance to play majors to now be mid minors or lower. I think new players coming in won't get any game time in minors.

There would still be an increase in quality, you won't lose as many roster spots or players as you would with 6 teams, minors would benefit still, regular season games would be more important as there's only 6 games to make the playoffs and 4/7 making the playoffs (57%) as opposed to 4/6 making the playoffs (67%) might be better.  It's also smart because if lowering the teams doesn't work out, you haven't done as much damage as you would by making a big jump from 8 to 6 as opposed to 8 to 7. If it does work out, you might be completely content with the 7-team system, but if you still want to change it a bit more, you can make the switch to a 6-team system the season after.

OLTP,365b0x,FoolishDominator,11,Sun May 17 01:48:58 2015 UTC,it makes my day every time I see a new thread from those two
OLTP,365b0x,GetShrekt619,4,Sun May 17 02:16:13 2015 UTC,It's fun to bag him
OLTP,365b0x,Alleviation,10,Sun May 17 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"Elfi, just out of curiosity, have you guys considered having 7 teams if captaincy is going to be a problem? Just hear me out:   Fewer teams means more competent players within teams, thus a higher level of competition. Removal of the mid season break (each team gets 1 bye), therefore we get to finals quicker and the last few weeks of the season that most people hate is shortened by 2 weeks. A working free agency because every player in Australia/NZ hasn't already been poached just to meet the minimum player quota. Captains can actually afford to drop under performing players and pick up someone else, because there will legitimately be a free agency list."
OLTP,365b0x,VehementVexation,4,Sun May 17 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"We are ahead of you on this one :) Its very likely we may even be dropping to 6 teams. Meaning we would get the chance to extend our regular season, as every team will be able to play each other twice.  We're not really keen on having a bye each week, but all 3 options have been discussed, and with the lack of captains currently, this will be first topic talked about at our next commissioner mumble meeting."
OLTP,365b0x,Alleviation,4,Sun May 17 02:48:23 2015 UTC,"#RolyForCommish?  But seriously, good to know you guys are considering this, I think it'll be much better and kill a few birds with one stone!"
OLTP,365b0x,flappytowel,2,Sun May 17 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the idea of each team playing each other twice. It seems like it might drag out the season too long. And also, if there are dominant teams like last season, it means that every team will get destroyed twice which isn't very nice haha.  Just my opinion though :)"
OLTP,365b0x,fooize,2,Sun May 17 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Then again, playing 5 games isn't really fair. Most teams, even those who might be struggling, only start to gel a few weeks into the competition.  If we did move to 6, we would have to revisit a number of our decisions though, so will consider your opinion on this."
OLTP,365b0x,fooize,7,Sun May 17 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"Then again, playing 5 games isn't really fair. Most teams, even those who might be struggling, only start to gel a few weeks into the competition.   I think dropping to 6 teams and each team playing each other twice is a great idea, for a few reasons.  1: Less captains mean that the captains are more likely to be of an even skill level, unlike seasons past where getting a core of experienced captains has been pretty easy, then the captain pool has been stretched out by captains not at the same skill level. Less of an issue with 6 captains, and makes the season more fair from the get-go; so less dominant teams are likely.  2: Each team playing each other twice is a lot more hyped. If each game was played on a diff. style map (like Star the first fixture then Velocity the next as an example) I don't see the results being exactly the same each time, which makes the games compelling to watch. Also, rivalries (like 12R vs C22, for example) don't get to develop when you only play a team once per season.  3: At the end of the season the ladder is more fair and representative of the skill because you get a better sample of each team's strength against each other rather than just the ability to stomp weaker teams, combined with having better captains. I'm not confident putting this in text but feel free to find me on Mumble to discuss this.  4: This solves a lot of minor's issues. Because there'll be less players in majors, there'll be more players to fill minors spots, and less majors playing in minors etc. Also more players to facilitate trades if other teams have availability issues and need players."
OLTP,365b0x,3z_,5,Sun May 17 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"I personally agree with all 4 of your points. Even last season I was pushing for playing each other twice for the reasons you outline, but with the larger number of teams it wasn't overly viable. We'll see how we go after a meeting."
OLTP,365b0x,fooize,5,Sun May 17 05:25:27 2015 UTC,I'm glad you guys are considering changing the season structure because of the issues with captains.  Keep up the good work  <3

OLTP,365b0x,iTagPro,5,Sun May 17 08:19:07 2015 UTC,"If it drops to 6 teams, i would be interested in just getting rid of the playoffs altogether and making it into a league much like EPL."
OLTP,365b0x,GetShrekt619,3,Sun May 17 09:00:39 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I think 6 teams is too small to have a play-off.
OLTP,365b0x,iTagPro,2,Sun May 17 09:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a bit of a tough decision. Top 2 doesn't seem like the greatest fix, but top 4 is maybe a bit too inclusive, and some might argue that the season is a bit of a scratch after 10 weeks.

OLTP,35u050,klosec12,4,Thu May 14 02:15:41 2015 UTC,Well its a bit hard to give suggestions when we have no idea what an even potential lineup is looking like.  Is Geo locked in? What about Holy See/Boombox? Is Star making a comeback?  There are too many maps for us to wildly suggest without knowing what the Commissioners are thinking.

I think this is an important question because players who can play both offence and defence at a high level can be far more valuable on non-traditional style maps. The use of these maps can therefore change how captains choose to draft come draft time. I would love to hear some justification from the comissioners as to what maps they choose to put in this season with reguards to the mix of maps and the order.

OLTP,34ymco,-suz-,6,Tue May 5 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"Great idea, very excited.  Bit confused with the point scoring system. Does it mean a return gets you 3 points? 2 pts for return + 1 pt for tag Also, I don't think simply grabbing should get someone a point. If someone gets 20 flaccid grabs in a game, it's not a good thing, but they will be rewarded by your point scoring system."
OLTP,34ymco,-suz-,5,Wed May 6 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"It pretty much does mean you get 3 points, but the +1 for a tag is there for when players have tagpro and tag others.   If you grab (+1 for grab) and get popped (-1 for popped), a flaccid is essentially 0 points. We don't want to give -1's for a flaccid because in some situations it might be the right move. On top of that the system is very defender friendly and if we let grabs where you end up getting popped (most grabs are) become -1, it will really make offenders useless."
OLTP,34ymco,elfitzo,1 point,Wed May 6 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"Okay mb I get that flaccid grabbing is negated by the popped = -1, but that renders the points for grabs useless, as Roly has stated"
OLTP,34ymco,elfitzo,3,Wed May 6 02:26:42 2015 UTC,"Not really, cause we don't want players getting -1's for grabbing and getting popped, even if it is after a minute of hold or something."
OLTP,34ymco,elfitzo,0,Wed May 6 06:49:19 2015 UTC,"The way we see it, flaccid grabbing isn't being rewarded (and it shouldn't be), as it's a net 0, but it's also not a negative, as sometimes it may be a hand-off or of other benefit to the team.  As such, by keeping it neutral, if a player is flaccid grabbing with no benefit, they don't get any reward whatsoever, they are just wasting time, whereas if it's a beneficial/sacrificial grab, then maybe when they get back on re they get some extra hold and a future cap.  By keeping it neutral, we're covering for both outcomes from a flaccid grab."
OLTP,34ymco,elfitzo,2,Wed May 6 08:14:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, so don't pick support offenders in your Supercoach team... There are players like this in every sport who are integral to a team but won't get the credit in a scoring system. Likewise these support offenders don't get credited in GASP or NISH or any other stat measure, same with more contain defenders. Why does it become an issue here?"
OLTP,34ymco,FoolishDominator,2,Thu May 7 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"But how does we measure them???   We're considering adding some other features to the scoring system if you've got any suggestions, some we've thought of but I'm sure there's some we haven't."

OLTP,34ymco,elfitzo,3,Wed May 6 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"This is an awesome idea!   Just for simplicity though, would it be better to give 11 points for caps and removing the +1 for grabs? You end up with the same points with fewer calculations and it doesn't reward players for picking up the flag at the end of the game either.  Also can you join the league after teams have been drafted, as I think team composition will really effect individual performance?"
OLTP,34ymco,demothelol,4,Tue May 5 18:11:52 2015 UTC,There will be unlimited trades from the opening of our SC competition to the start of Round 1. So you'll be able to make a team straight away and keep making changes after you've seen who gets drafted to certain teams.

OLTP,34ymco,klosec12,3,Wed May 6 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"Just to add something further on your 2nd question, we expect to make this available after the draft date, otherwise you might end up paying 20+ coins for a StrangeCloud only to find out he's playing Majors and thus probably won't be worth that much (no offence buddy).

OLTP,34pogj,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Sun May 3 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"Going to play Devils advocate, but generally the last two seasons it had been run with everyone only having to give their top 5 preferences. Making us vote for every single person not only will delay the counting as preferences will take a lot longer to figure out, but also it makes us vote for people we might not necessarily even want to vote for."
OLTP,34pogj,klosec12,5,Sun May 3 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"It was a silly system for a number of reasons and partly why I wanted to be on the vote team after coming up with this system in the first place.  Right now, it'd benefit all fourteen players running for commissioner to put themselves in the top five and four other people they think have no chance of getting in, then vote for nobody else. One commissioner running this season has done exactly that. Under the old system this would work just fine (and be horrible for the community), whereas this way, these votes don't matter and we keep going down your list in order if the ones in your top five received the lowest amount of votes.  Furthermore, this system doesn't require everyone fully understand the voting system. We don't want to make a big long post explaining how preferences work when voting for five candidates. Even though preferences are really important, looking at last season's votes many people only voted for five. We don't know why they did but I anticipate it was because some don't understand exactly how we're adding them up. By simply forcing everyone to list them all eliminates the possibility that these peoples' votes are less important because they didn't understand our system.  We could have instead put a big post explaining how it's done, however when you guys can't even read that one sentence in bold, I doubt the paragraphs on counting will be read.  Lastly yes, this will take a lot longer. We are in no rush for season 4 and that's why I wanted this election to run for a week. I have no problem putting in the extra effort but that should be up to PT and me only. I anticipate we'll have the results out within 48 hours of closing the votes."

OLTP,34pogj,swagpotato,2,Mon May 4 01:26:29 2015 UTC,"No real need to play Devils Advocate. The system is designed for people to preference all candidates, it was frankly lazy to not have people vote for everyone in previous seasons, and the counting will take maybe 2-3 minutes extra provided they have a system set up.  The fact that some people vote for everyone, and then some people only vote for 5 or so, makes it a very unfair system, and unfairness should be a priority over the whole 2-3 minutes earlier decision..."
OLTP,34pogj,elfitzo,1 point,Sun May 3 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"Not really, the fact that there is a chance for people to vote for people they feel should be in the role is something that is not only in state level, but also national level as a system of voting.   I should also mention from experience counting last season that it took significantly longer to go through preferences than straight counting and that was with roughly 5-6 candidates per vote. Having 11 with all but double the counting time, unless it there are very similar votes for a large part of the votes."

You guys preference your candidates 1-14. The five people you put in your top five each receive one point. We then add up all the points from all the votes. Whoever has the least amount of points is crossed off everyone's ballot, and those below that person are moved up. We then repeat the process. Everyone's ballot at this point is essentially 1-13, we give the top five on each ballot a point, cross off the name with the least amount of points, and move everyone else up.  We repeat until we have five people remaining.  Here's a pastebin of me running through an example."

OLTP,34pogj,Pimp-My-Alpaca,5,Sun May 3 13:58:22 2015 UTC,Last season we had a very small number of votes submitted.

For a very brief summary, watch this.  In short, the more people you vote for the more control you have over the election, and the more fair the results are. If you vote for everyone on the ballot, you have the most control you possibly could, and it results in the most fair and accurate outcome for the candidates.  It doesn't ruin the point of an election, the system is how all elections should be if people weren't stupid and lazy.

OLTP,34m3se,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Sat May 2 12:59:57 2015 UTC,"I think there has been a lot of community input, though. Back in S3 voting I remember there were quite a number of people who thought five was too much - even during S3 people were saying that.  I'm not saying push it down to 1, but I think have it a part of the voting process to allow people to choose if they want 3, 4 or 5 commissioners."
OLTP,34m3se,elfitzo,5,Sat May 2 13:58:24 2015 UTC,"TBH I can't remember too many people pushing for a reduction in the number of commissioners. I remember a massive push for 5 to be installed instead of 4 prior to season 2, but I haven't heard/seen too much going the other way.  I also don't see the point in pushing for it now. Do you not believe there are five candidates who are strong enough to run this upcoming season? Or do you have another reason for your concern?  I don't think there should be an even number, i.e. 4, as it could result in stale-mate votes. Admittedly last season there weren't too many that were split 3-2, but it's important to be able to avoid it regardless.  3 is also too little, it puts too much stress on the active commissioners, too much is required of them. The best thing about the commissioners is their ability to discuss freely and openly with their other commissioners on ideas or concerns they have. To reduce this would mean less discussion. To increase it would dilute the discussion or involve too much administration."
OLTP,34m3se,fooize,1 point,Sat May 2 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"Well it wasn't so much of a hot topic admittedly, but I do distinctly remember conversations with people who thought less was ideal.  My concern is partly due to lack of candidates I like, but also because of how I remember running the league in S1 compared to S3. The latter, as you recall, ended with a lot of sitting around and waiting for the fourth or fifth person to put their votes in. In certain cases, it ended up with things like The Great Platypus Scandal of 2015, and other internal situations which I won't verbalise.  The fact is, we did avoid a lot of those 2-2 votes in season one. Not because of differing opinions, but because it's much easier to get 4 people available at once rather than 5. Do you recall how many times we almost had a meeting, but couldn't because of one person who couldn't make it? That really just wasn't much of an issue at all in S1 (albeit we had fewer meetings). The 2-2 split functioned the same as 3-2 split - if it was a stalemate, we had to have a discussion more on the topic and if the votes were the same then the notion wouldn't pass.  I think you raise a good point on strain amongst three commissioners (especially if someone drops out halfway through the season...), but I still maintain that five commissioners is just a few too many cooks.  A camel is just a horse designed by a committee. With too many ideas, and too many meetings we required, the were a lot more internal issues with S3 than there were with S1."

OLTP,33okqn,elfitzo,6,Fri Apr 24 06:10:56 2015 UTC,"Short but sweet:  Free agency  At least a 2 week period of not being able to being signed up to a team.  Draft style  Nothing wrong with the snake draft. Auction draft is bullshit and does not have my support. It does not help aid captains/simplify how the system currently works. If it ain't broke don't fucking touch it.  Map rotation  Wide selection of maps. Chasey maps, tight maps, big maps, even fucking battery/thinking with portals. However complex these maps might be, and you might think they suck, they actually require a great amount of communication and teamwork to win. This encourages teams to get good.  Season structure  Depends on sign ups as to how many teams and how many rounds. Playing each team once is good enough, the season is long enough imo. I like the way finals was set out this season (benefitting those that came first or second), however, I think it would have flourished better, had the competition been a lot tighter.

OLTP,33j176,A_K_o_V_A,10,Wed Apr 22 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem is that oLTP is like a stepping stone for the OLTP competition. I feel that if oLTP was dropped, a lot of the interest in OLTP would dimnish, as they have no real connection to the teams. The people in minors play in the hopes to reach majors, if they only play ocon there isn't a very good chance they will proceed higher up the competitive ladder as it is a less serious system."
OLTP,33j176,flappytowel,11,Wed Apr 22 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"I think this is probably my biggest concern. O-Con really isn't taken that seriously. Someday, probably not this season or the next, I want to get into majors, but I'll get there eventually. There's going to be maybe 1 - 3 teams that legitimately play properly in O-Con, as usual and being lead by someone who is a 6th fiddle doesn't sound particularly appealing. Shit, I might even be that fiddle and I would be terrified if I had to run a team. But playing defence against haz4shooter as he flaccids for the 20th time in a game isn't going to get me anywhere...  Minors is, for the most part, a rite of passage and it's abolishment will only mean that fewer people will ever get good enough to play majors. This will definitely work for a season or two, but people leave, get angry, whatever. After a while, majors is going to get so diluted with people who don't know what they're doing, it'll be almost the same as O-Con.  Edit: Otherwise, good plan and I like the thinking outside the box. Something definitely needs to change, and parts of this post will definitely be a part of it."
OLTP,33j176,Alleviation,7,Thu Apr 23 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"This, so much. I think our current system works really well for bringing up newer players up a ladder style system, I know this as I went exactly through it all last season. Started out in O'Con, which was perfect for a new player as it wasn't too serious and it taught me valuable game skill, and then playing minor's greatly improved me as a player.  If we were to abolish minors, the progression for less experienced would become harsh. O'Con will never be taken as seriously, and mixing it with minors will both dilute the skill of minors and the relaxed nature of O'Con. The amount of players at the top level would be such a low number in comparison to our community who are interested, and so would be extremely negative to hype and the general atmosphere of OLTP IMO. Instead of abolishing Minors we should be focusing on improving it and making as fair as we possibly can."
OLTP,33j176,Pimp-My-Alpaca,5,Thu Apr 23 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"I feel similar. I was pretty content with playing minors but I realised that oLTP was merely an afterthought because S3 in general was somewhat of a clusterfuck. O-Con's a fun way to 4v4 with pals for shits and giggles and while it may be taken seriously by a few, I don't think the majority see it that way. It's kind of like having the Big Bash or IPL in cricket between series.   I too want to play majors one day, but there's no way somebody is gonna pick me up if I'm still playing the way I do amongst the current crowd. I may have tasted majors action this season, but I was quite clearly a fish out of water. Another season of oLTP would help me become a better player and potentially be a majors player some day. I can say without a doubt that if there was no oLTP, my interest in competitive and probably even TagPro in general would several diminish since I don't pub that often and really just make maps and jump on Mumble from time to time.   The rest of this radical proposal isn't actually too bad though."
OLTP,33j176,KewlestCat,3,Thu Apr 23 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"oLTP runs into troubles when teams start to lose. It has happened every season that a couple of Major's teams lose hope and/ or lose players and are forced to bring up minor players... The minors team start losing players but we don't have the numbers to refill them... ALSO the minors dynamics of most teams are 1-3 people REALLY keen and dedicated to playing competitively but the other 3+ people are just ""If I'm there i'll be keen to play"" -- That isn't what competitive is about but we wouldn't have the numbers to fill 8 teams if we didn't let these people participate...   It has been obvious both times that running a minors competition is causing a lot of difficulties and drama for those who want it to be taken seriously and those who just want to participate and be involved.   If oLTP could be run as a separate competition all together with it's own Captains and Draft (With less teams so the skill/dedication level isn't so diluted) it would be an improvement.

OLTP,33j176,Achler,3,Thu Apr 23 05:03:36 2015 UTC,so how about   3 Commissioners 2 Team Leaders (aka OLTP S4 Helpers) OLTP with 6 Teams of 4 playing 2 rounds keep oLTP with  6 Teams of 6 playing 2 rounds O-Contenders continuing during OLTP for anyone and everyone (maybe)
OLTP,33j176,fooize,3,Thu Apr 23 04:39:59 2015 UTC,Having the competition run nearly the same way as the last two seasons but going back to having only 6 teams would probably improve the level of play in general. The competition needing only 60 people instead of 80+... And then a re-work of the FA system would help support that.   I'm not sure O-Contenders would quite have enough people to continue during the season though unfortunately.  I think it may still lead to issues but they would be far more manageable.

OLTP,33j176,Achler,2,Thu Apr 23 05:17:30 2015 UTC,"bear in mind there'd probably be more extensive breaks if you prolong the season.  even this season we had something like 3 weeks of breaks (maybe more).

OLTP,33j176,Fog_Terminator,2,Thu Apr 23 05:44:58 2015 UTC,"The O-Contenders franchise teams could effectively be run anyway that their OLTP team wanted them to be run - They could just be another O-Contenders team or they could be used to train the OLTP subs up/ give them game time. As far as OLTP would be concerned, they would have no actual say over the O-Contenders teams. So you could enter your entire OLTP team into the O-Con Franchise but it would be a complete waste because you want at least two ""core"" members of your Franchise teams that you could call in to OLTP in either an Emergency situation or as a full-time replacement.   The finer rules of this would have to be decided by the s4 Commissioners - I was mainly commenting that the Structure of OLTP/oLTP needs to change to properly suit our community and was giving examples of how I believe this system would work... The rules would need refining.   Effectively the idea of ""minors"" would become less important but would be competitive in it's own right as you would assume the 6 franchise teams would be battling for the top stop in O-con... Although a non-OLTP team like One, Bug, Radian etc. could come in and claim the top spot in O-con and it would be competitive but in a less serious/ dedicated way to OLTP. -- I suppose under these rules all the Captains of OLTP could potentially create an O-Con team just for an outlet of the competitive OLTP scene -- But would obviously be expected to make OLTP first priority."
OLTP,33j176,Achler,6,Wed Apr 22 23:12:06 2015 UTC,"I'm at work but this seems so convoluted that taking the effort to make it work smoothly, especially with minors, seems pretty pointless when you can innovate in other ways; and not cut out 60% of our player base."
OLTP,33j176,Achler,3,Thu Apr 23 01:03:10 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a good plan. Might be hard for the community to adjust but still if it were implemented probably a better system.  A few questions:   For the O-Contenders section, when an OLTP team is deciding who to place in their team would there be a draft? If there were to be a draft, whoever doesn't make it into an O-Contenders OLTP sub-team would have the option of forming their own team with others in the same position. These people, honestly, would probably be not very good players and would have little chance against the other O-Contenders OLTP sub-teams. How would you propose with your system to get around this? Would you consider changing the name from O-Contenders to something else? It may become a bit confusing as it is not the same as O-Contenders."
OLTP,33j176,fooize,2,Wed Apr 22 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"I think free trade in O-Contenders would heat up under the proposed system of scrapping oLTP.  The top 6 teams in O-Contenders should end up being the OLTP franchise teams. The rest of the teams would have the typical O-Contenders players.   Here is one scenario I see happening, if an OLTP franchise team slips out of the top 6, it will begin to ask why, analyse the team and look to strengthen it. A quality player in a non-franchise team is spotted and asked to move away from their O-Contenders team to the franchise team, if all agree a free trade occurs. Hopefully the free trade helps the franchise team move back into the top 6. Ultimately the newly drafted player is then eligible to play in majors after playing the required matches in the franchise O-contenders team.   So the moral of  the example is,   play well in O-contenders get traded to a franchise team become a sub for OLTP become a starter for OLTP,  win premier ball."
OLTP,33j176,Alleviation,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"That would be a pretty good competitive system, however my concern is that we have roughly 40 players who are skilled enough and dedicated enough to ACTUALLY play in a competitive format.. we have another 40 players who are either skilled enough or dedicated enough but not both << So something like O-Contenders works perfectly for them... and then we have another large chunk of people who either don't want to play OLTP or who want to be involved (So sign up for OLTP) but when push comes to shove they drop out leaving teams decimated >> Especially in terms of oLTP (And in some cases in terms of OLTP as well).  Effectively having 3 tiers of teams/ player types being:  Fully Competitive  Casual-Competitive  Involved  So OLTP fills the needs of the first group and O-Con fills the needs of the second two.   oLTP and things like it was trying to drag the second to groups up into the standard of the first group which caused the competition to be less fun for a lot of people. At least this way, if you're in a Franchise team, you're guaranteed to be with players who will take the game seriously -- But won't be under an immense amount of pressure to attend multiple trainings a week etc. -- And you'll also have plenty of opportunities to prove yourself against OLTP in scrims and that kind of thing."

OLTP,32jasm,FP4H,14,Tue Apr 14 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a commissioner candidate live stream is held.   The way I see this working is that a thread is made in which the community posts questions for the commissioner candidates to answer and after a week or so, the 5 to 10 most upvoted questions are posed to the commissioners during the live stream and they have a limited period of time in which they can answer (to keep people from waffling). They could also be given an amount of time to talk about whatever issue they'd like to or maybe a debate could be held. I think this would be good because it would prevent 400000 word comment battle bullshit in reddit and also people campaigning in main lobby. It keeps the stances of each of the commissioners clear and concise and gives a better gauge of where your vote is going.  I think that if a set of 5 or so set questions which covers all obvious points such as draft systems, map rotations and general improvements is used and then the community votes on 5 other questions to ask this would provide the most interesting format."

I don't think there has ever been any decision I had to make where it was all black and white. For example, with minors commissioners. I don't think they should be completely separate, but I think that their should probably be one or two commissioners designated as minors commissioners. They would still have a say on what affects the league as a whole, but would be mainly focused on representing the B team players interests.  Same goes for overlapping game times. According to the survey I can only choose between no overlapping times ever, or overlapping times should always been allowed, but nothing in between. Ideally, overlapping times would be a thing during the season, but we didn't have enough streamers to justify that."
OLTP,319kes,TagWolas,2,Fri Apr 3 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, some questions were poorly asked. It should give us an idea of what the community is thinking though. It wouldn't hurt to have a survey closer to S4 with more questions and better asked questions."

I guess that you wouldn't want to read the results in black and white then. Going to your overlapping game times example, if the results are close to 50/50 then you would know that it is not an important issue and people don't really feel strongly about it, rather than knowing exactly what people want."

OLTP,30wjw2,TagWolas,12,Tue Mar 31 07:48:33 2015 UTC,"Active commissioners - Commish need to be active, they need to play oltp.   I would like to thank elfitzo for being the only commissioner that had an acceptable amount of activity on mumble and tagpro. Other commissioners should not signup next season as commissioners and let other people who are more active take over.    Maps - No controversial maps.   Community votes and Captains votes on what maps they want, then the commissioners chooses the maps using the suggestions as a guide.    More Hype - More/Better Organised Media    I've got a lot of ideas. Too much for one post. E.G. summary thread, Mixing media (less overlap - more engagement), creating and running media teams (so we get a chronicle, even if i have to write it all myself), organise commentators before games, start thinking of ways to make streams more interesting.   Fix Minors - There are a lot of suggestions   more organised, allotted ""majors time"" in minors, fix free agents. more minors media. start caring about minors.    More Discussion - More Polls, More Threads.   Start talking to people more to get an idea of what the majority wants and implement what they want if it'll work.   More transparency   I've said this before the season, let us know what commissioners are making the bad decisions. So we don't vote them in for 3 seasons in a row. You do this by having a spreadsheet that lists any commissioner vote on it and the results. Also no secrets.   Also: Teach more people to streamer/recorder, Auction draft (Based on vote), Public access to an up to date free agent list, up-to-date spreadsheets, only one stats (gasp) not hoog and nish (based on vote), look at ways at improving the spreadsheet, better sidebar, possible majors/minors merge (depends on players, community vote and alternatives). Possible pre-selected game times shown before draft."
OLTP,30wjw2,flappytowel,4,Tue Mar 31 11:28:55 2015 UTC,"Community votes and Captains votes on what maps they want   Yeah, I thought that was going to happen this season. A lot of the people going for commissioner had it in their appeal"
OLTP,30wjw2,hoogstra,3,Tue Mar 31 11:40:04 2015 UTC,"Active commissioners - I've had to move house a couple of times since I became a commissioner, with one of those moves against my own will. I had no internet for a month at my new place and so for quite a while my mumble activity was minimal.  Maps - This season we really wanted to experiment with trying out a few new maps. There was a bit of talk going around about how the map rotation was becoming stale. We also wanted to try out maps with different flavours so as to create a complete competition, with a mixture of map types. Battery was included as it played fairly well in season 1, and it would require teams to practice (the idea was to encourage training and teamwork, as many players were originally unfamilar with the map.)  More Hype - I promised more chronicle, but klosec is a scrub and decided that the chronicle wasn't worth his time. It would be awesome to develop some kind of team, but I don't necessarily think that it needs to be organised by the commissioners. We have many creative and intelligent players who are able to contribute to the community.  Fix Minors - Free agency was straight out broken. We didn't fix it midseason because that would be unfair. A way to avoid this in the future would be to allow all players who signed up before the draft to be unrestricted free agents, who are able to majors if they are signed up. After the draft, there would be a 3-4 week closed period for free agency signups. After that, the signups will open again for restricted free agents. These players would only be eligible for minors, and it would only be open to new players.   You did an amazing amount of work when it came to minors, something in which we really struggled with. I wouldn't object to having a minors commissioner to keep the whole thing organised and to represent all the minors players in commissioner meetings. I'm not quite sure what you mean by allotted ""majors time"" in minors.   More Discussion - The discussion threads were really good this season and I think it would be a great weekly thing. It would keep everybody talking about the latest OLTP issues.  More transparency - I highly encourage speaking to the commissioners about their decision making. The commission is a 4/5 person union, and we all stand behind our decisions, whether we voted for them or not. If you want to hear our personal opinions, just talk to us on mumble. I should be on quite a bit more than I used to be. I wasn't on tonight because I was at uni late and I'm catching a flight tomorrow, so I needed to prepare.  Also - The main issue when it comes to streaming and recording is hardware, not knowledge. Players have approached us, wanting to learn how to stream, but usually their internet service isn't at a high enough standard, or their computer is just incapable of performing that kind of task.  I would love to see an auction draft for next season. This season, we decided that the grass isn't always greener, that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. We wanted to stabilise after a drama filled season 2. This season we realised that drama is inevitable no matter what we do.  The free agents list is only accessible by captains because they are the only players that should need access. However, we would definitely look at making the list public.  I was in charge or spreadsheets for this season, and because of my limited internet access, the spreadsheets were not updated as often as I would have liked. I ended up having to get other players to update it for me.  What is wrong with two stat systems? They both work in different ways. One measures skill, the other measures value. HOOG works very similarly to GASP, but it isn't as kind. GASP would spread the scores between all players fairly evenly. HOOG shows you the difference between 1st and 2nd, whether it be .1 or 20.  Players seemed pretty happy with the spreadsheet from last season, so we didn't change too much. The sidebar could look a little nicer though.  Merging both majors and minors would probably mean that less players get game time, and if a certain amount of players needed to be played, then it would lower the level of skill we currently have at the top level. We want to present the best games that Diameter can offer, but we also want to give as many people a chance as possible. That is where a majors-minors system works fairly well.  For next season I think it would be good if we could speak to the captains after the draft, to get an idea of which time suits them best, on average. That way we could try and create a system where there would be less disputes over game times. We would try and make it as fair as possible, but it wouldn't be completely fair, I don't think that would be possible."
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,4,Tue Mar 31 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"I promised more chronicle, but klosec is a scrub and decided that the chronicle wasn't worth his time.   You need to realize that from the very end of last season i mentioned that the first two weeks would have no chronicles due to the timing of the start of the season. After we got started, i had very little spare time due to finding work and University picking up a lot more than i expected. Also i have had some other things arise during the season that naturally needed my time to fix. So yeah, i would say the Chronicle was not worth my time during the season. Its very difficult setting aside 4-5 hours a week to write a 20 page chronicle alone, especially when there is no major benefit/interest for me to do it."

I get the sense that the community strongly disagrees with you on like every topic.    You're missing the point about heaps of things. Discussion is more than just these threads.  It was obvious minors was going to suck before the season started, and now you're apologising. To top it all off you're offering really bad solutions compared to everyone else. pls listen. Just because something doesn't have a huge glaring problem, doesn't mean you shouldn't aim to improve it.  The two stats was a problem because in season 2 I really enjoyed looking at stats, but this season it was just annoying. Takes up too much space on the spreadsheet. It's annoying not having a definitive list of ""this is the top offender"" even if it's a partial lie. (hard to explain)      we all stand behind our decisions, whether we voted for them or not. If you want to hear our personal opinions, just talk to us on mumble.   WHHAT ?!?!??!!?  THAT MAKES NO SENSE.  Before the next season starts I want a full list if what each commissioner voted on. It's really weird to be so against transparency. Are you seriously trying to hold on to being a commissioner by keeping everyone in the blind? (and holding the spreadsheet hostage, seriously need to teach people).   The aim of having more than one commissioner is so that you disagree with each other and the best decision comes through a healthy discussion. We want to know how good each of you thinks that decision was. So when we don't get an auction draft, we all know it's your fault and don't vote you in next season. And if you don't like that please, please, don't sign up next season. For the good of OLTP.    The fact that I had to put in more effort and time into oltp than everyone else who was a commissioner this season (except elfi). Seriously need to up your game and stop making excuses."
OLTP,30wjw2,hoogstra,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"I remained highly active as a commissioner behind the scenes. I had access to Facebook chat and I voted on every decision made while my access to the web was limited. Same applies go Radian and Balljobby.  In regards to stats, I was approached numerous times last season because people wanted WEPS. In MLTP, WEPS was replaced with NISH, as it was practically just an improved version of WEPS. I gave the players what they asked for in that regard.  You are right that discussion is more than these threads. Discussion is sending the commissioners reddit messages, talking to us on mumble. I wasn't on mumble for a while but I still heard about everything the commissioners discussed, not just with themselves, but with others too.  I stand behind my statement that the commissioners as a united group of leaders will always stand behind the decisions of the commissioners as a whole. As individuals, we hold our own opinions, and you are free to ask us about our own views on any decision. There is plenty of arguing behind the scenes. For example: I was outvoted 4-1 in trying to implement an auction draft. The other commissioners had very strong reasons to not do so. We all pretty much agreed that an auction draft would be better suited to season 4.  There is more to being a commissioner than what the majority of people see. The bulk of our work is done in private. We create and enforce rules. We heavily discuss every issue that affects OLTP. Our whole job is not to satisfy every players protest against the rules they agreed to at the start of the season."

OLTP is in need of a hiatus. Whether it was to attempt to maintain hype after s2 or to maintain competition and avoid players leaving due to inactive competition, the league really suffered for s3. The inactivity of ocon following season 2 should have been a sign of competitive fatigue. From the beginning there was little real demand, nor any excitement and this was then exacerbated by most of the league becomin lately uncompetitive due to the distance between top 4 and bottom 4 (not a fault of the league set up - sometimes this just happens).   The community needs a breath - a chance to do something other than going once again into a routine of competition for reasons no other tha routine. I don't doubt that smaller one-off competitons such as the recent impromptu onces would scratch the competitive itch, and eventually there will be demand for s4, but it would be much more responsible to wait until there is a real demand for more oltp"
OLTP,30wjw2,Alleviation,3,Tue Mar 31 23:40:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. We waited over a month and a bit between the two seasons (from memory) and I personally would've liked it to be held off a bit more. Lots of people seemed excited and were asking for the season to start as soon as it could which is why we ended up starting it when we did as opposed to waiting.
OLTP,30wjw2,WumCraka,2,Wed Apr 1 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"Was talking with elf and some others in mumble last night, and it was made clearer of the future of oltp. With a number of players deliberating on leaving and the hype of another oltp season deminishing, its hard for people to realise that its hard to find this next 'step' for oltp. It seems like people are waiting for something exciting to happen to change oltp (ambitiously for the better) so that gype can form and people start preparing early for this change.  I think people dont realise that oltp needs to first become stable before an serious changes could be made. ie. auction drafts, trades... With people leaving and at least half of the current oltp captains going to step down/leave it makes any serious changes improbable, since we have a lack of committed and experienced tagpro-ers. Its been predicted oltp wont start back up until around mid june. Not until june because of exams and yes this break is needed. July is too far away coz people will be itching for oltp. The demand by then will come about.  I agree with you that the hype needs to liven up before another season can commence. To acheive this as a community we need to work together to find the best possible outcome for the leagues current situation. I think adjusting for player lost will take a hit on our league the hardest. But i feel in the past, hype was lost purely because of the change. The change didnt feel positive and therefore people were naive and taking commisioners for granted etc. Hence why the community working together to make oltp the greatest it can be, is very neccassary."
OLTP,30wjw2,elfitzo,3,Wed Apr 1 00:21:40 2015 UTC,"You're right about the changes; a stable league and player base is needed first. However, I feel like hype was missing at a way more basic level: desire for competition in the first place.  O'con was meant to be the league-between-leagues, a competitive environment to fill the gap between seasons. The o'con preceding s3 was a collapse: inactive teams, poor communications by all parties and no real competition. People weren't interested in playing competitive tagpro.   There is some unbalance in this: the need for a continuous platform for competition and the need to maintain a competitive, active player base. I feel s3 was detrimental to the player base due to a lack of interest in competition in general. This was a problem exacerbated by some factors, but not caused by them a lot of the comments in this thread suggest."
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,2,Wed Apr 1 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"However, I feel like hype was missing at a way more basic level: desire for competition in the first place.   Agreed. I think the weird sensation of drama took over and i dunno, weve just never bounced back. I think hyping up s4 needs to be done smartly and done often. Also maybe if ocon is done better this season it will bring a larger need for more conpetitive play. (Balwas and strangecloud are on top of this btw) i think s4 will be better than this season, and hopefully we can bounce back to a similar level of hype as was for season 2"
OLTP,30wjw2,flappytowel,2,Wed Apr 1 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Strong o'con will be good. Purposive o'con as the gateway for rookies into oltp will be a better system than running unknowns in oltp minors, resulting in all the no-shows.  As an aside, because drama is such a bad word, I feel like there everyone needs to get over this phobia of drama. Drama in the competitive scene builds hype and excitement. Everyone needs to understand good drama and bad drama - competitive rivalries and trash talk = good drama. Personal attacks and witch hunting = bad drama.  To use a poor sports analogy - drama created by refereeing decisions or team rosters would be drama in the competitive side of things. I won't say it's all ""good drama"" in this sense (e.g. Region wars), but do keep in mind a relationship between drama an excitement. Drama gives a talking point beyond ""oh hey ball!busters are op"""

OLTP,30wjw2,fooize,8,Wed Apr 1 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"We really need an auction draft next season to keep teams fair.  The commissioner presence really seemed to be lacking this season, especially in minors. I felt that wolas picked up a lot of the slack in organizing games/recordings/commentators etc so props to him. (Maybe you should have replaced him with sizzled? Although that might have created more problems I dunno)  Why don't you have seperate majors/minors commissioners to manage the workload. The best commissioners help out with the main majors stuff, and less experienced people do the minors stuff, and get a chance to strut their abilities for future campaigns.  other than that it was okay"
OLTP,30wjw2,hoogstra,8,Tue Mar 31 09:08:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, wolas has done a great job"
OLTP,30wjw2,drinkbleachtag,5,Tue Mar 31 09:14:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with the fact that Minors was not run nearly as well as it should be, but I think splitting the commissioners between the two wouldn't be that effective, as we would end up with 2 different leagues, which is not what we want. Majors and Minors should be run in parallel to each other, they should be the same functionally, but with more focus/excitement/skill placed on the Majors competition. Once we start getting into different sets of commissioners we start having 2 different methods of decisions being made, and we end up with two competing leagues.   The way I see it is Minors is not just to give 'game time' to those not played in Majors, but at the same time it is not meant to be a challenger to OLTP. It provides valuable experience and allows improvement of players who are either newer to the game than their more experienced Majors counterparts, or haven't fulfilled their potential yet and are not yet 'making the cut' so to speak. Apologies if I offend anyone with that statement.  I can only speak for my team, but Minors was taken as, if not more seriously than Majors. My Majors team had players full of experience, so less was required of them outside of showing up to scrims and discussing what works/doesn't work. Minors however I expected more from as I tried to coach them through situations and ensure they had the right ideas on every map.   Moreover, my Majors players in bleach and Borgen, and to a much larger extent Noob, aided in improving them and ensuring they had some experience in practice. I would often ask my Majors guys through the season to pair up with a Minors player and instruct/criticise them during practice (or more often criticise them myself).  I agree there were flaws in the system when it came to oLTP, I put my hand up and say that there is room for improvement, but the way I see it, a major issue that people bring up is 'it's not taken as seriously as it should be'. Well fuck me, that's down to the captains and players too. Massive credit to Wolas for helping out towards the end of the season with pre-game organisation, but he really should not have had to shoulder as much as he did. Players need to step up too. If they want the leagues to work and function to their expectations, they need to be able to take responsibility and put in.  As for auction draft, pls. Fair teams? The only thing that determines whether there are fair teams are the captains abilities. Captains choices on draft night along with captaining throughout the season with practice etc. (There was one exception this season, klosec12, who only had some control over his choices, and yet still managed to pull 2 of his players into the top 10, but he had full control over the team that he received, and AFAIK got the top players he wanted.) I see an auction draft as a system that magnifies the choices/abilities of a captain to handle the draft. The better a captain can plan around an auction draft, the better/more OP his team will do, whilst the opposite is also true.  Taking this season as an example, there were constant complaints that the teams weren't fair. That the split between the top 4/bottom 4 was too much, or that TBB were OP as fuck. If captains can't handle a simple snake draft system, how in the world will they be able to cope with an auction draft system?  Before we make the jump to an auction system, which imo didn't work out explicitly better than snake system in MLTP, we need consistent, capable and experienced players as captains. At the moment, from a few discussions about S4 in mumble, we'll be struggling to keep the captains we had from this season, and not too many people are keen to put their hands up (which isn't great cause we want committed captains, not ones that say ""I'll do it if no one else will"").  Discussion on anything above is welcome, it's what we want to generate with this thread. Criticisms won't get you banned/shunned, you'll get more respect and attention if you just say what you think. (Also after writing this it may seem like criticism of doku, which it's not, just piggy-backing off his points)"
OLTP,30wjw2,Alleviation,6,Tue Mar 31 11:49:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with auction draft for entertainment value, but disagree that we should move to it to create fairer teams.   I'd argue the current system is pretty good at giving every captain an equal opportunity to draft a strong team, and beyond that it's very hard to consistently create evenly matched teams throughout the season.  The teams this season were pretty fair in that every captain had the opportunity to draft a solid team and almost all of them did. 12R, BTTW, VEX all had strong teams based on pre-season assumptions, or had the chance to draft stronger teams.  C22's are probably the only exception, But that was due to Rain's decision to draft the players he did, and that's just what C22's have done every season. This wouldn't change in an auction draft.  Either way, the current system has created equal opportunities for captains in any draft position to create a strong team. An auction draft will be excellent for captains strategy and for the viewers, but I can't see it improving the fairness of teams."
OLTP,30wjw2,drinkbleachtag,3,Tue Mar 31 09:55:42 2015 UTC,"I believe an auction draft in fact will create teams that are more balanced, this is because it provides a quantified value to a particular player which changes things drastically.   Let's say as an example each captain had a 100 coins to pick a majors team. Now as each player becomes available, each captain is going to  put a value on this player based on what they think the player is worth to their team and also what they are worth in another team.   So, if we take you as an example. You would be a highly sought individual that wouldn't be going for cheap, so captains will in a way be limited to the amount of drinkbleach's, smack's, radian's, (vapulate's), etc they can have. I think basically this will make captains spend most of their money on a must have player, and then work out what to do with whoever is left and how much money is left also. But then I'm sure there will be some nifty auction draft strats too.   But yes I agree with the C22s example that it wouldn't change much in an auction draft, this will just mean that there will be 7 balanced teams and 1 shitty team that strives for the 3 point season."
OLTP,30wjw2,Alleviation,5,Tue Mar 31 11:20:31 2015 UTC,"1 shitty team that strives for the 3 point season.   Most successful team in OLTP ever, you mean. No other team has ever reached as many OLTP finals as the C22s"

But in theory, it probably won't result in any fairer teams across the course of the season.  I like that in an auction draft any captain can bid on any player they want. The market will place a value on that player and every team will generally end up with a comparable total value for all their players. But it doesn't mean that those teams will actually be any more even than they would be from a snake draft."

OLTP,30wjw2,herpaderp1995,4,Fri Apr 3 03:51:16 2015 UTC,"This is implying that captains will be able to accurately judge the value of a player before the start of the season - take as an example from last season - mc ride. He was a fourth round pick for the rubles before putting up the top GASP of the season. Every captain had multiple opportunities to draft him, but they didn't realise that he would be such a good player.  Now you can say that ""he wouldn't have fit in their team plan"" or similar arguments, but they'd all also apply to an auction draft - Captains will still have a plan for what their team will look like."

OLTP,30wjw2,elfitzo,3,Wed Apr 1 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, Vap, but an auction draft is much more complex than a snake draft and we saw captains have a bit of trouble with that. I think unless we have 8 captains who are completely 'capable' and fully understand the auction draft, while also meeting the standards of captaincy set by the commissioners, then we shouldn't look at using the auction draft.   I agree with Bleach in saying that an auction draft could be brought in to garner more excitement from the community, instead of making fairer teams, but even then, there was a fair bit of excitement for the draft for this season and now there isn't????? Who's to say that the same thing won't happen again. Just sayin."

OLTP,30wjw2,hoogstra,2,Tue Mar 31 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"Couple of things I'd like to add:   Changing of the free agent system - It was a pretty bullshit that people who signed up after the draft could be traded immediately for inactive players, we had people who would've been majors players if they signed up normally being traded for Round 9 players before the games had even started. I liked Hoog's suggestion of making it so you can only pick up free agents who signed up before the draft for the first half of the season or so, then the people who signed up afterwards could be drafted I guess other people will also say this but I was kinda disappointed there was no auction draft. If the captains agree to it next season then I'd really want to see it implemented.  Commissioner Activity - especially towards the end of the season it felt like there were barely ever any commissioners on, which I can see how with Sizzzled leaving and Rad having ping issues, but especially in Minors this had a big impact with a people being unsure about the rules with who was allowed to play and having no commissioner to clear them up didn't really help, as well as having streams organised. Minor's was pretty much only organised at all in terms of streaming thanks to Wolas, and I know we had at least 2 people figure out how to use OBS as the game was going on (thanks Vin and Curve) since nothing was pre-organised. Also things like match time threads & roster updates need to be more organized, as they were very incosistent.   All in all I think you guys did a really good job this season, thanks for running it!"
OLTP,30wjw2,virnetics-tagpro,3,Tue Mar 31 08:00:26 2015 UTC,"On the free agents thing something that doesn't allow you to sign up as a free agent if you've played OLTP could also probably work. Maybe something like if you've played 60 minutes you can't apply (but you can be a free agent if you're not drafted).   But yeah, such BS with some of the free agents.   Also maybe something that forces captains to pick up a free agent if they're dropping a player, so you don't have teams which end up with 4 majors players and 3 minors players by the end of the season."
OLTP,30wjw2,hoogstra,0,Tue Mar 31 08:09:23 2015 UTC,"A solution I have was to get captains to rank free agents with what draft round they would have gone in, and you can only replace him with someone who's from an equivalent or higher draft round.  Hoog's idea may not work because we really need free agents as less and less people are signing up.   captains ranking would be fair as they were the ones who draft, the draft was based on their perceptions/opinions so this should as well. A captain lying would be easily detectable by the community."
OLTP,30wjw2,demothelol,3,Tue Mar 31 08:14:46 2015 UTC,"This requires an insane amount of effort from the captains, and not all/many of them would be willing/have the time to rank all of the free agents that sign up among the many other duties. They can't even organise game times (see BB3 vs KRU Semis) let alone judge all Free Agents. Whilst it may work in theory, I think a different method would need to be chosen in practice. Any suggestions on that?"
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,3,Tue Mar 31 08:33:47 2015 UTC,"As long as it's something not as subjective as draft position. For minors HOOG (for players with more than 60 minutes), the alphabetical order of names is more strongly correlated (0.114) than draft order (0.081). At least majors has a borderline moderate/strong correlation (0.68).  TL;DR minors players are generally a lot harder to rate at the start of the season, assuming stats mean anything (which over a season they somewhat do)"
OLTP,30wjw2,elfitzo,3,Tue Mar 31 10:33:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I think everyone agrees that the free agent system sucked. I've definitely been hearing a lot more practical ideas floating around lately compared to at the start of the season. So who ever commissions next season should be able to fix it pretty well.

OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,3,Wed Apr 1 00:55:51 2015 UTC,"From a streamers perspective:  1) We need some sort of list as mentioned in here of official streamers, wolas had to continuously create a mumble room for me for first few weeks of the season as someone kept deleting it as im guessing they thought it was a troll?  2) Commish need to sort out who is streaming earlier, start of season this was happening and it was working really great but then suddenly it just stopped. It made my life a bit of nightmare having to rush streams together last minute with Wolas scrambling to find comms.  3) Just a shout out to the regulars who started putting their hand up every game day to commentate, u made my life so much easier and I really love you for it <3  4) MLTP have had weekly posts regarding streams and then as someone puts hand up to stream a game, the post is edited with a link to the video straight onto the post. Often during the live streams people come looking for a link to the video as the only announcement is through a tree message, if it was all consolidated prior via this method it would save everyone hassle. This can even progress to side bar updates for better hype etc  5) If we cannot find enough streamers prior to game day, then I would prefer we only stream a ""match of the round"" and just record the others. The are a lot of people capable of recording and not so many able to stream, so this would make my life as a player easier (as that is my foremost interest).  6) On that note, recording/streaming is pretty fucking easy. If anyone wants to give it a go then hit me up. If you are unsure whether your upload is fast enough, I can also help you out with that.  7) The half-time shows (ignoring one in particular) seemed to get some pretty positive feedback as well as allowing the commentators to recompose themselves, and check up on some stats, if people are keen I would be more than happy to throw these into my streams more often. They also coincidentally are my highest viewed videos.  8) Those top play videos were sweet and I am sorry it took me so long to realise to whack them at the start of streams to fill up the usual 15 min wait. I know they take a fair bit of time to do but if someone could potentially put together a Top 5 Someball Moments or something similar for stuff ups, I would really love you.  9) I actually really enjoyed this season as a first timer despite a lot of the negative comments so thanks to all who put in the time to make this happen <3"

Not only that, but as soon as I got internet I couldn't stream anymore. Usually I would let people choose their streams and then I fill in the gaps so that there's no problems. I was trying to keep organising streaming but the other 2 people who usually stream on top of you and I were unreliable and didnt always show up.  4) Yeah I did that in my weekly preview posts but no one ever left a comment on them putting their hands up for streaming/comming. I know you PM'd be in the last half of the season so thanks for that.  5) good idea.  6) yeah likewise, I was trying to record myself setting up the stream and streaming, but I didnt have enough time to do that before moving away. people can check out /r/tagprostreaming for basically all the info on how to do it.  9) thanks man, and thanks for picking up the slack when we had a lack of streamers."

Personally, I'd be consider a more radical (heh) change in how the league is currently structured. Maybe a move away from MLTP/ELTP etc. styled leagues towards that of other egames?  I'm thinking of drafting teams at the start of the season (auction or snake, whatever) and then every second (or third) week, have a mini tournament between all the teams instead of having games. Do this for x amount of weeks until we get to the playoffs where the teams that have the most points based on finishing positions from the seaons tournaments play [quarters,] semis and finals over 3 weeks just like we've been doing every other season.  Obviously this is just one way to change up the league, and an extremely radical one at that, however I think it could make the league more fun over the course of the season because games/tournaments are more spread out week to week, which means players wont get burnt out, there's lots of time for practice (lol) and potentially more hype.   This is just one idea, but I think its worth thinking about. Let me know if you have any other league structure ideas or you want to add onto/critique my idea."
OLTP,30wjw2,elfitzo,2,Tue Mar 31 10:52:13 2015 UTC,"the draft and first 2 or 3 games of the season are the most fun and exciting parts   Yeah I agree man, although the only reason they have so much hype is because the previous season in some ways leads to it (building up stats etc).  Maybe it would be cool to try out a different format. Like a shorter season length for example. These seasons are just too lengthy for the amount of players we have"
OLTP,30wjw2,A_K_o_V_A,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:15:09 2015 UTC,"That would mean that we would need less teams to keep the season somewhat fair, which would solve the issue of teams being low on players but would create the issue of players being unhappy they aren't getting game time. I think for next season I would like to keep the same amount of teams, but increase the squad size to 11, instead of 10"
OLTP,30wjw2,TagWolas,5,Tue Mar 31 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"1) Merge Majors and Minors (a radical suggestion)  While Minors has been great in getting more people game time since its inception it hasn't been treated with the seriousness as it deserves. So what I propose is that each match consists of two full games and then overtime if needed (finals format) and that a minimum of 6 or 7 different players must compete (and maybe players have to play a set amount of minutes so you cant just sub out someone after a minute of play). The games should be allowed to be set on different days in order to get the minimum players required.  This format allows for all the games to be hyped and makes each players role more important. It also brings more strategy into the game as captains have to decide if they want to stack one team or maybe spread there best players over each game and if they do stack a team which game should they play the first or the second.   Organisation shouldn't be too big of an issue as teams currently organize two games a week.  A side note, We have stagnated in numbers so to be honest I feel the most likely way minors players are getting promoted is if majors players drop out and always being a minors play, plus how the minors competition is treated be some people may cause individuals to drop out.  2) Don't worry about overlapping games  I feel that having the highest quality game is more important than being able to stream all the games live. If a captain can't field the team they want due to an overlapping game that is a bad thing. Games can always be watched later and that can become an event itself such as post game commentary from two of the opposing players."
OLTP,30wjw2,swagpotato,0,Tue Mar 31 08:33:20 2015 UTC,"You are right about overlapping game times. Most people don't watch every single game live. The main issue however is finding twice as many streamers and twice as many commentators. We wanted to offer everybody the chance to watch any game live. Unfortunately there were a few issues which made that too difficult.  If we had enough streamers and commentators to facilitate having overlapping games, then that would be amazing. When it comes to playoffs though, there are many more people who watch all the games, so we would prefer to have those games not clash, but that potentially clashes with us wanting teams to field their best sides in the playoffs."
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,3,Tue Mar 31 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"80% of the community wanted auction draft  Comissioners vetoed it because it would create 'inbalanced teams' and they know best  New comissioners s4 who deal with problems as they are presented and not half a week later  Can we have a results thread for the love of fuck, like no hype for the semis and no post about it afterwards, seems like klosec was the only one generating any hype towards games before this, I mean basic write ups of each team winning the round would save so much time trawling through spreadsheets  /#voterichgangs4"

OLTP,30wjw2,3z_,6,Tue Mar 31 11:53:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who doesn't really spend much time on mumble, the chronicle was what i would look forward to on a weekly basis for hype and preparation for next week.   Definitely feel OLTP was worse off without it"
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,3,Tue Mar 31 18:34:12 2015 UTC,The thing is I shouldn't have to be the only person having to run hype for the league.  EDIT; Also see this for my reasoning as to why there was little chronicle
OLTP,30wjw2,Avoke6,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I completely understand. Life comes before TagPro of course, but the fact remains that you intended to write the chronicle, you made us aware of that, and we planned with that in mind. It's no one's fault, but the blame is being placed on commissioners anyway cause it's the cool thing to do."
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,5,Wed Apr 1 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"The Commissioner have very little fault in this situation, the only reason i can see blame being placed on them is because i did the Chronicle while I was a commissioner and there may have been an assumption that the same would be done in S3, even if i was no longer on board.  I certainly intended to write the chronicle for S3, but as you said Real Life comes first and it has been no secret that I would have little time to write it (It was mentioned several times throughout the first two seasons that i needed help working on it, due to time constraints.)  There however should not have been any planning on constant chronicles, at least not this season, due to the circumstances about the start of the season which made catching up very hard."
OLTP,30wjw2,Avoke6,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"No ones fault? seriously? It's not hard to go put up a thread an organise a little bit of writing. As soon as it looked like klosec couldn't write it, you should have put up a thread, started getting people to help. Commissioners needed to organise the writing. Commissioners need to start working on hype, not just rules.  It is the commissioners fault to trying to get klosec to do it (when he obviously couldn't) and then not even trying to get something going.     I would have done it myself I if I wasn't busy trying to save minors."
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:22:32 2015 UTC,"It's hard to change these things mid-season, especially when we have our own lives to plan around. Radian and Hoog losing their net and losing a commissioner altogether meant we were underpowered in many aspects, and to add to that we all have uni to deal with. I for sure couldn't commit to aiding in writing a 15 page document a week on top of uni work/real life.  Furthermore klosec never came to us and said he couldn't write it, life got in the way for him too. In future seasons there will be more input from the community in many areas, I like your idea you sent me yesterday with the form, and really think it should be implemented, but to do that we need it from the start of the season so that we're all aware of the workload and how everything works so we can adjust.  We commit a lot of time as it is to the league, and we're passionate about it, so I imagine we'd be happy to commit more, but the commissioners (this season and future seasons) need to know the schedule and achieve the right balance."
OLTP,30wjw2,Avoke6,2,Wed Apr 1 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"For reasons I will go into at some point (Can't right now)... I think there should be a re-work of the commissioner team.   I believe there should  be 3 Commissioners and then 2-3 Team Leader positions  The 3 commissioners would  ideally be be experienced, mature and proven to be unbiased members of the community who would be in charge of setting up OLTP, building on and fixing the rules (also enforcing them during the season) and ensuring the competition comes together as smoothly as possible.   The team leader positions would ideally be active and enthusiastic members of the community who would specialize and be in charge of a role within the framework of OLTP/ oLTP (With a team or by themselves, up to them) - These people would still be apart of the discussions and inputs of the commissioners as they would be ideally valued players of the community, however only the 3 commissioners would have the final vote on rules/ discussions (EG we went through every single rule and discussed them one by one then voted to keep it or change it) - Ideally votes would pass 3yes or fail on a 3no and on anything else the Team Leaders could be brought in to vote if needed (To get a 3-1-1 or a 4-1 to pass).   Anyway. The main role of a team leader would be their specialization... Examples: Stats, spreadsheets and sub-reddit update Team.... Streaming/ Community informing/ Hype team... That kind of thing. (I'm just spit-balling. The actual team roles could be discussed more specifically later).   You would effectively still have a team of 5 people. With the ground-work already being well laid out at this point I don't see the need for 5 Commissioners all having very vague and general roles where some of them could be used far more effectively and efficiently if they were specialize and focus on important and essential aspects of OLTP."
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,3,Wed Apr 1 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, next season I've already planned to have teams for roles. I've already made a signup form for those who wish to help out. I've also worked out how much people we're going to need for each team. I've also gone into detail about the exact things I want to see each person do each week and stuff (if you'd like to see, just pm me or ask on mumble).    Streamers - Streams the weekly games. Recorders - Records the weekly games that the streamers can't stream Write Up Team - creates a weekly write up about post game thoughts and pre game interviews. Design Team - Designs ads, sidebar images, backgrounds and ads for the streams. Video Team - Creates weekly videos, creates hype videos. Commentators - Commentates on streams and recordings.  Spreadsheet Team - Adds the weekly spreadsheet information.  CSS Team - Keeps css up to date, changes the weekly sidebar image. Subreddit Team - Updates the weekly combined post. Updates the sidebar. Audio Team - Interviews players of interest for the write up team (Before Game).     These teams would communicate with each other (using slack or modmail or something). Not sure if there's any other teams we should have. Should be a lot more easy for people to know where they can help out."

OLTP,30wjw2,herpaderp1995,10,Tue Mar 31 09:26:08 2015 UTC,"Dat edit.   but really, what was the point in getting us to play that round?   How about because it was part of the regular season that all players signed up for and were expected to participate. Every other team in previous seasons finished without incident even if they couldn't make the playoffs. Players/commentators/streamers and everyone else involved put their own time to come and participate and they weren't shown much respect were they?"
OLTP,30wjw2,klosec12,3,Tue Mar 31 10:42:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points, however i will counter with each side in the previous seasons had something to play for in the final round, whereas our game made no difference in any major way, besides who came 6th and who came 7th.  It was also no big secret what our side intended to do in the final game, we discussed this with the other side a week before the game as soon as we knew we were out and neither side could come last. We even set up the streamers and commentators letting them know what was going to happen.  I am not trying to defend our actions but merely give you some context."
OLTP,30wjw2,herpaderp1995,8,Tue Mar 31 10:51:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points, however i will counter with each side in the previous seasons had something to play for in the final round, whereas our game made no difference in any major way, besides who came 6th and who came 7th.   Pls. The final round match of season 2 between Balls of Prey and Wu-tag was a battle to avoid the wooden spoon. When playing to change ladder positions even from 7th to 6th, that is something to play for. Another reason could be that players from both your teams wanted to play for stats (some people like getting or looking at their stats) and some players were denied a competitive environment.    It was also no big secret what our side intended to do in the final game   I am not aware of most the context so thank you for providing some details on what happened prior to the match. I'm trying to look at it objectively though and based on what I saw from the video, several rules were broken during the match with little to no response from the commissioners (apart from Hoog using the ban hammer which alot of people attacked him for at the time). The sidebar says OLTP is the highest level of competitive play and if I was a potential player who had watched that game I wouldn't be all the keen to sign up to OLTP if it's not competitive in the slightest. I think it would be better if we all remove the incident from our thoughts and endeavor to make all future seasons much better in terms of quality."

OLTP,30wjw2,drinkbleachtag,2,Tue Mar 31 10:10:41 2015 UTC,"The reason i played less than half the games was because of when the games were organized - I couldent make the first two rounds because they were still in the break, but i concede with the last round antics.

Was that intentional Bug??   But in all honesty congratulations to the 50 Shades for winning the regular season. I'm really looking forward to our upcoming rematch where the Ballbusters will prove once again that we are the better team.
OLTP,30h11u,Avoke6,3,Fri Mar 27 23:31:20 2015 UTC,No doubt Ballbusters are the better team. Should've won regular season. Not sure what happened there. I'd be surprised if you guys didn't beat us again on Jagged.

A forfeit is treated  as a 6-­0 loss to the forfeiting team, and a 6-­0 win to the opposition. For each forfeit,  the forfeiting team will have one (1) point deducted from the total season points.   So in theory it is possible for teams to make the playoff if the teams in 3rd and 4th start forfeiting games."

OLTP,2vj9jn,matt287,4,Thu Feb 12 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"Pls bug, one and I set up everything for a majors top 5 plays but only 2 people submitted clips..."
OLTP,2vj9jn,smackmesideways,5,Wed Feb 11 22:16:37 2015 UTC,Yes but that was probably more to do with not wanting to go through email and all that (people don't want to give out their emails or go to the trouble of creating an email account just to submit a clip.) Make the process easier like Wolas has done and more people including me will submit clips.   Thankyou for your streaming though. I know you already do enough for the community.
OLTP,2vj9jn,matt287,3,Wed Feb 11 22:25:19 2015 UTC,I get that but I personally wasn't a fan of everyone being able to see every submission because it kinda defeats the purpose of a top 5 plays video when anyone can literally just look through the submissions (I know I would be far less inclined to watch the video if I've already seen the clips that are going to appear in it and more).  I agree about people not wanting to give away personal information/being too much hassle but it is the best solution for this type of thing. Every other Tagpro league (MLTP/mLTP/ELTP/NLTP) or basically every other video games top 5 submissions are through email.  It's clearly not working though so well change the way people can submit for next week.
OLTP,2vj9jn,smackmesideways,3,Wed Feb 11 22:47:57 2015 UTC,I see what you are saying but I would rather have it where we have already possibly seen some of the clips then not have any top 5 plays at all.

Please address the issues and concerns of the community."

(Am I'm the one that almost didn't get captaincy because of not organising game times... but I digress.)  If he agrees to this time change will you allow it?

OLTP,2uz3yp,flappytowel,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:44:39 2015 UTC,"We've already established your stand in this this decision. If we could get a majority vote from all commissioners please, or a comment from OLTP Official. I understand your comment is your opinion."
OLTP,2uz3yp,swagpotato,6,Sat Feb 7 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"Our current official stance on the matter is that OLTP games cannot overlap... That was pre-agreed upon and has been stated officially in the past... Here: http://www.reddit.com/r/OLTP/comments/2tyrqa/week_1_fixtures/  A lot of previous competitions and tournaments have ended in Drama because the rules have been randomly bent for someone and therefore we shouldn't and cannot do that on a whim. (Other captains could turn around and say: ""OH I WOULD HAVE CHANGED MY TIME IF I KNEW THE COMMISSIONERS WOULD JUST BEND TO MY COMPLAINING"" And they would be justified in saying so).   If you think the rule should be changed/re-looked at then that is fine. As it stands though the rules are clear and games must be organized at least 48 hours in advanced to ensure that players, with IRL commitments etc. are fully aware and prepared for their game. If someone had cancled real life plans in order to ensure their availability for the game... only to have it changed last minute then it is unfair on them. (Even if they're too nice to get pissed off about it). - And that is precisely why rules are there. Don't hate the player - hate the game...   The rules are clear and can be flexible up until a point. But this weeks games are set and cannot be changed. If you and others believe the rule needs to be changed and can provide good discussion on why it should be then go ahead and state your case and we can look at it.   In this situation though, both the rules and the official commissioner stance has been stated and must be adhered to in the spirit of running a fair competition."
OLTP,2uz3yp,TagWolas,2,Sat Feb 7 05:53:35 2015 UTC,"When I signed up to OLTP I had to accept to follow the rules. This was not one of the rules I accepted, it hasn't even been implemented in the rules and regulations. There was no discussion of this before it was implemented.  I would officially like this to be changed/re-looked at.  I will now accept this weeks game times, however I am still not happy with them."
OLTP,2uz3yp,swagpotato,2,Sat Feb 7 06:30:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fair enough Bobbay.   Let us see how this weekend goes (With no overlapping games) and compare it with last weekend (Where a game overlapped) and then get some feedback from the community/ other captains on whether we should allow it. Perhaps people won't mind missing out on watching other games too much.   (I would say that a confirmed/ pre-organised Streamer would be part of the stipulation of a game being scheduled at the same time as another Majors game, at least)."

If somebody wishes to watch a game, they can find the live stream if available.  Here is to clarify what Subs can do:  Article VI - Substitutes  Section I - Substitutes  (a) Teams are permitted to have their non­playing team members in the ‘Waiting’ slot during matches, who can substitute into the game when required. They can also sit in their team’s Mumble channel, provided they are muted."
OLTP,2uuk96,smackmesideways,9,Thu Feb 5 08:35:18 2015 UTC,"I generally think this season has been run very well (bar no auction draft), but one thing that I really think needs to be cleared up is the whole trading of players. There needs to be some sort of official announcement that a team has dropped/picked up another player somewhere, kinda like there is for o'contenders. It was pretty cool turning up to our minors game to find out that they had one playing for them, which the only thing we knew of that previously was Teejay saying that he thought someone told him One might be playing minors.  I also find it kinda weird that you can just transfer anyone who hasn't signed up for any other player. Considering that kit played the first match, it's effectively like Rain has got one of, if not the best offender in minors for the equivalent of a last round pick. Same deal with Verona/Parka/One etc. If there was a good player who was happy with only playing minors, a captain may as well tell them not to sign up,  sign up with a fake account, draft that fake person last then immediately drop him for their extremely good minors player and be at an immediate advantage compared to the rest of the competition. To me, it just seems stupid that these people didn't actually sign up in the first place and has kinda created an unbalanced minors system as a result. I know this is really difficult to stop, and kinda not relevant but I kinda wanted to rant so...  EDIT - Actually, I think a bit more commissioner activity around the games would be pretty good. From what I noticed last week there was quite a bit of confusion about some of the rules. An example of this was when Street and Strange were commentating the Bad Balls III and the Ballbuster's minors game and were talking about how they thought Ballbusters were cheating (with Truth and Esteem playing, after both playing majors), which as far as I know was never really cleared up. And I know during Rubles vs Cap 22's there was a fair bit of confusion about spectating. I just feel like a bit more of an official presence would help out in these cases."
OLTP,2uuk96,Achler,7,Thu Feb 5 12:34:23 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to what you are saying: Why should people who never signed up get preference over free agents who actually went to the effort of signing up?   There should also be a waiver system. If a player like One, Bug, or Kitsune decides to sign up as a free agent, then every captain should have a chance to claim them (starting with the lowest team on the ladder)."
OLTP,2uuk96,Pimp-My-Alpaca,3,Thu Feb 5 12:59:57 2015 UTC,"just to add, ""claiming"" a good player is only possible where a team has an open free agent slot.  An active player can't just be dropped from the team because a ""better"" player is available as a free agent.  see rules  Article IV  - Roster changes,  section III - free agents  section IV - dropping players"
OLTP,2uuk96,smackmesideways,3,Thu Feb 5 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear what you guys are saying and I think it should be something that is addressed in further seasons.    If there was a good player who was happy with only playing minors, a captain may as well tell them not to sign up, sign up with a fake account...   This would come under a violation of the rules/ etiquette and if found out would be punishable. However I understand that this alone doesn't ensure it won't happen. Having a FA who can't play majors but plays all the time in Minors will hinder your Major's ability to field decent Subs if they need to (Which under the new strict scheduling system is far more likely this season) but perhaps it isn't enough of a trade-off.  If I'm just spit-balling ideas then:   My thoughts would be that players who sign up after the draft are only allowed to be picked up after a certain amount of weeks.   OR  FA's picked up who have signed up after the draft date are only allowed to play a low number of games (4 or maybe 5) but FA's who missed getting drafted are able to play an unlimited amount of games (And perhaps able to move up into Majors for a limited amount of games? (2 or 3) )  This would ensure that people who sign up for the draft but miss out are considered more valuable than players who effectively smurf their way into the competition. -- Also while not excluding these players who only feel up to playing Minors from the competition entirely.   Thoughts? Any other ideas?   As StrongBalwas said, these kind of things can be hard to stop and it is perhaps only so prevalent now because we had an unfortunate amount of people pull out of the competition instantly. (I would have preferred that these players had of been replaced by players who missed out on the draft, rather than FA's but there was nothing in the rules to enforce this and we can't just be flip-flopping the rules all the time band-aiding problems) << ALSO side note, I have to say: Props to all the captains that did have to drop players and pick up new ones as they all came to the commissioners with this very problem before trying to recruit their new player. (Rather than flat-out taking advantage of what could be considered a loop-hole as far as minors are concerned)."
OLTP,2uuk96,fooize,3,Thu Feb 5 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"Having a FA who can't play majors but plays all the time in Minors will hinder your Major's ability to field decent Subs if they need to   Well, not really. Rain got Kit for the equivalent of a 9th round pick. In most teams the 9th round is never going to play Majors, and Rain still has all his higher round minor picks and subs (Iso was R4 and was playing majors...) If you started swapping your R4-R6 picks then it would.  I also don't think restricting amount of games is fair, as for any game that the FA is playing the other team is at an immediate disadvantage. Take our game against Vexillophiles for example, where they had One playing. One was transferred for Roly who was a round 6 pick. Compare that to our R6 pick of Teejay. I'm nto trying to be mean to Teejay, he's a great, underrated offender who is so absolutely fantastic to partner with on offense but he'll be the first person to tell you that One is a better player than him. Even if he did only get to play 5 games in a season, the other team is at an immediate disadvantage for those 5 games. This is even more with Kit being the equivalent of a R9 pick. How many 9th round picks will be playing 5 games a season? Even if you limit Kit to that, the Cap 22's get such a big advantage for those 5 games it's ridiculous.  I like what Avoke suggested. Wait maybe a month after the draft, then hold another smaller draft for unresponsive players. Draft order would be based off the draft order of the dropping players e.g. Someone who was replacing a R6 pick would get to choose before someone replacing a R9 pick. If you actually need to replace a player before then because otherwise you'd have to forfeit the captain should be punished for drafting that irresponsibly.   Something needs to change, because right now teams like the Krusty Grabs/Rubles/Anyone who hasn't transferred a player are at an immediate disadvantage to any minors team who have done so."
OLTP,2uuk96,Achler,3,Fri Feb 6 03:35:17 2015 UTC,I think it should be something that is addressed in further seasons.   Why not now? The whole premise of being a good commissioner is being able to adapt and change in the NOW.    nothing in the rules to enforce this   Yes but you can make new rules...   My thoughts would be that players who sign up after the draft are only allowed to be picked up after a certain amount of weeks.   Strongly agree
OLTP,2uuk96,fooize,2,Fri Feb 6 02:07:16 2015 UTC,"i think there should be restricted free agents who signed up after the draft, and unrestricted free agents who have no restrictions.   RFAs would be unable to play more than 5 games (100 minutes) in the entire season.  this promotes healthy squad rotation as well as allowing truly unrealised players the ability to shine"
OLTP,2uuk96,TagWolas,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree free agents (pre or post draft registered) should be unrestricted in their play. Squad rotation is at the discretion of the captains, and as indicated in the rules is encouraged but not enforced."
OLTP,2uuk96,Achler,2,Fri Feb 6 03:03:15 2015 UTC,I know it isn't. I think it should be.
OLTP,2uuk96,Veronah,2,Fri Feb 6 03:26:36 2015 UTC,I agree that there should be a way to ensure that people who signed up for the main draft are considered first for replacing players who pull out. Coming up with a balanced system will be something to look into. (RFA only being able to play one half... or a certain amount of games... or having a stand-down period of a vertain amount of weeks... that kind of thing) To ensure that undrafted players will always be considered more valuable than a FA who signed up after the main draft.
OLTP,2uuk96,Avoke6,2,Fri Feb 6 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"Another possible solution:  Free agents that signup post-draft can only be drafted in an equivalent or higher draft round that they probably would have been drafted in. Let FA play majors and have no restriction on what weeks they can play.  The ""estimated draft round"" could be judged by captains, as they'd have the best idea of peoples estimated draft round.  That way one (the player, as an example) would only have gotten drafted if a round one or two player drops out.    I feel this would be fair to both the teams that don't draft him, and the teams that do draft him. As no one is missing out on anything.   The only issue is players in high estimated draft rounds, have a low chance of getting  drafted (as people in high draft rounds don't drop out). Which just makes it better for the new players (and other teams) and encourages them to signup before the season starts."
OLTP,2uuk96,Pimp-My-Alpaca,1 point,Fri Feb 6 06:06:09 2015 UTC,I don't think putting any restrictions on how many games an acquired free agent can play (minors or majors) is a good idea -  elfitzo season 1 mid season acquisition is a good example of why this is a bad idea.
OLTP,2uuk96,hoogstra,6,Fri Feb 6 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that you feel that way, Strong, but I see where you come from and what you're saying.   If it's any consolation, I have made myself unavailable until week 4. This is because I am busy (It's why I didn't sign up in the first place) and because of the reasons you stated above.   If there is anything else you want the free agents and myself to do to make oltp more fair, just ask away. We're all friends here and i'm sure all of us would do nearly anything for a friend if it was hurting them.   Another good effect of you bringing this up is that the commissioners will see this problem and fix it for this season and all the seasons to come, which is a benefit to all of us.  Have an up vote, good Sir."
OLTP,2uuk96,Avoke6,6,Thu Feb 5 23:11:47 2015 UTC,"Just a few comments.   To me, it just seems stupid that these people didn't actually sign up in the first place and has kinda created an unbalanced minors system as a result. I know this is really difficult to stop, and kinda not relevant but I kinda wanted to rant so...   I completely agree Balwas. Within days after the draft I was hearing reports of some teams picking up free agents and my first thought was ""wow that was first. Who dropped out?"". Unless some serious event happened players should not be dropping out so suddenly and players who signed up so soon after the draft, I'm left to wonder why they didn't sign up for the original draft? I'm also concerned with how teams were able to pick players immediately before other teams had a chance to say anything. As an example the first I knew of Kit's return was being told she'd signed up as a free agent and already been picked up by the Cap 22's. I (and probably many others) didn't even know she had returned before she was already off the availability list. The rules regarding free agency were ambiguous and I feel like they're currently being taken advantage of.   It also brings into question the rules regarding dropping players. From the Ballbusters perspective we have had some issues with unresponsive players and technical issues. Iloominati was having trouble being able to play tagpro on his Uni net and was worried he'd have to drop out but he has since resolved the issue and is looking forward to playing this week. We are also having trouble with a few other minors players with them saying they'd show up and then on the training or game day and then they are a no-show. What I'm saying is we're abiding by the rules and giving them more then the week (as advised in the rules) for them to communicate with us before we go looking for replacements. Are all teams doing this or are they just cutting team members quickly to get at the free agents?  At the moment it just seems like the free agency rules are being abused. One was certainly active before the draft so why didn't he sign up then? What changed for him to want to sign up as a free agent not even a week after the draft? Why was verona pulled from the draft packet and then resigned as a free agent after? How come Kit was able to be picked up as a free agent days after the draft? Why were all these players picked over the legitimate players who did the right thing and signed up pre-draft and missed out on teams. How do you think they would feel about that? Is it welcoming to the newer players of the competition?  Those are my concerns at the moment. My suggestion is thus; If teams wish to have an inactive or withdrawn member replaced with a free agent they should contact the commissioners with sufficient proof prior to say Friday (as an example). Then they could have a few commissioners run a sort of mini draft where the teams who need replacements are sorted into a drafting order via where their team is on the ladder and then they can run through the order picking up a free agent. It would only require a commissioner or two and the captains/vice captains of the teams involved and it could be held at say 9pm or something on a friday or after the round perhaps. It wouldn't even take long but it would give some official feeling to it. As right now we have very little in the way of announcing which teams have picked up free agents. They could make a post about what happened and who drafted who.  ***In regards to the confusion about the ballbusters minors. We've talked to some commissioners about it. We had the same situation as Balljobby in that thetruth played OLTP for the week but was still considered a minor player as he was not the captain or in the first three draft picks. From my understanding this is the same as what happened Balljobby's game. Esteem was our only OLTP player as per the rules."
OLTP,2uuk96,Pimp-My-Alpaca,2,Fri Feb 6 02:59:01 2015 UTC,"Really well said.   The idea of a mini draft seems like a good solution to this. I guess the drafting order would be based on what draft position you are replacing, i.e. so someone who is dropping their round 6 pick would get a higher preference than someone dropping their round 9 pick. This can still be abused, but players would have to have proof of their inactivity and is much more difficult to abuse than the system that is currently in place.  It just seems ridiculous that while other captains have got 9th round players who will barely play at all (for the most part, there are still some really good players there), whereas Rain has got Kit, Drogo has Verona and Elfitzo has Parka? (When i asked him if he was playing oLTP he said no, but is on the sheets...) and same with Virn and One but for round 6. It puts teams like the Krusty Grabs at an immediate disadvantage as we're actually playing with players who were drafted in their proper draft positions (for the most part, LBJ at round 4 is hilarious though...)"
OLTP,2uuk96,hoogstra,3,Fri Feb 6 03:22:42 2015 UTC,We did a mid-season draft before to compensate for lost players and it created more problems than it solved.
OLTP,2uuk96,Pimp-My-Alpaca,2,Fri Feb 6 03:48:33 2015 UTC,You make it sound like the problem was having the mid-season draft itself. There could have been any number of reasons why it didn't work and many of them can be addressed or even fixed. I think it'll work better then the current situation with free agents. Right now there is no official statements on whose drafted free agents and we have to go hunting for that information. If you have a better solution though I'd very much like to hear it.
OLTP,2uuk96,hoogstra,0,Fri Feb 6 04:19:18 2015 UTC,Just because it failed once doesn't mean it will fail again if properly run. I know I wasn't around for S1/S2 but from what I've heard it seems the level of effort and officiality of the comissioners from this season has been much higher than it was previously. I know it is most likely not the best solution but it is better than what is currently going on.
OLTP,2uuk96,Avoke6,3,Fri Feb 6 04:27:16 2015 UTC,"It would be a bad idea to implement a pre-season draft because it would most likely be based on current positions, which don't tell the whole story. Unless every team plays every other team the same amount of times, you can never truly tell the position in which the team belongs.  In season 1, The Flag Bearers had a difficult start, playing the teams that finished 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In the following weeks, they played the teams which finished 4th, 6th, and 7th.  What is going on right now is that players that resign or are dropped because of lack of communication are replaced with other players who signed up as free agents after the draft. It isn't hard to see how easily this can be manipulated.  For next season, I propose a system which closes sign ups completely between the cut-off date for draft sign ups, and some time in the middle of the season, lets say after week 4. After week 4, those that did not sign up for the draft are able to sign up as free agents. This system will encourage teams to pick players who are reliable, and hopefully encourage those who signed up for the sole purpose of being free agents to sign up earlier, or else they will miss significant amounts of the season. We could completely close sign ups until the end of the season so only players that signed up before the draft are eligible as free agents, but there are players who honestly miss the sign up date, or aren't around earlier enough to sign up. I would love to implement this kind of system now but it is too late. The draft has already been, and free agents have already been signed."
OLTP,2uuk96,Jarradical,2,Fri Feb 6 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"To clarify I was thinking that a potential draft would be based off the draft position of the people being replaced, but your proposed system would minimise potential drama and still results in a more balanced minor's."
OLTP,2uuk96,Avoke6,2,Fri Feb 6 06:06:22 2015 UTC,Oh okay. What you said would be the system we would use if there was a dispute about which teams gets a certain free agent.
OLTP,2uuk96,Jarradical,3,Fri Feb 6 06:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, I know we on the Ballbusters were discussing drafting Verona on the draft day but we were told he'd pulled out or had availability issues. Then he ends up as a free agent and is put on a team almost immediately. All I'm thinking is what the hell happened? I get that he might've changed his mind and realized he could play a few weeks but it doesn't change the fact that we might have drafted him despite his availability issues (as we have done with several players) if we had the chance. But with the way things went down we never got a fair chance at drafting him and another team is getting him as probably a really cheap draft pick (not sure who he replaced). None can say that that is working as intended.  It's hard not to feel cheated under these circumstances."
OLTP,2uuk96,Avoke6,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"My team was at a disadvantage with 9 players. The commissioners wait TWO weeks, double what was stated in the rules, before confirming I could draft Verona in accordance with the rules. At the time I was notified of other FA selections such as kit and given the offer to contest drafting her with rain. Evidently I chose not to.   In the interests of fairness, Free Agency selections should be resolved as quickly as possible. I don't see how involving teams that already have a full roster is necessary?  My minors team had hardly any practice due to being short a player and some players being busy. Maybe the close result between BB3 and TBB in minors would have been different had we had an extra player available for scrims."
OLTP,2uuk96,Achler,3,Fri Feb 6 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"My team was at a disadvantage with 9 players   Please. Alot of teams are struggling to get players to show up and play matches. The reason we have 10 players per team is to allow for players to be busy or otherwise unavailable. You are not special in this regard.   In the interests of fairness, Free Agency selections should be resolved as quickly as possible. I don't see how involving teams that already have a full roster is necessary?   I never said they should???? Where did you get this from. My suggestion was all teams that are in need of free agents should get together with the commissioners sometime before the round and do mini-drafts between themselves to refill their dropped players. This would give a fairer chance for teams to get to the free agents instead of teams staking claims on free agents and teams having to ""contest"" the claim with the commissioners deciding the result.   My minors team had hardly any practice due to being short a player and some players being busy.    Again your not alone in this. Several teams are struggling with this. Did you know the ballbusters had 3 MIA minor players leading into week one and we have two-three going into week 2? Coupled with the fact we have two players away on holidays. Yea we are having a hard time organizing training let alone the actual matches.    Maybe the close result between BB3 and TBB in minors would have been different had we had an extra player available for scrims.    Pure speculation, it could've easily gone the other way and we could've won by more caps had we more players available to scrim with.  I think the entire free agency system needs a rework to make it fair for all teams and not just the ones getting in early...."
OLTP,2uuk96,Pimp-My-Alpaca,2,Fri Feb 6 09:41:51 2015 UTC,"You are not special in this regard.   We're not talking about players struggling to show up. Objectively if I have a 9 player team and you have 10 player team, I am disadvantaged.   I never said they should?   You're right, I misread your post.   Did you know the ballbusters had 3 MIA minor players leading into week one and we have two-three going into week 2?   If that's the case, why didn't you check the rules and ask for a FA slot? I'm not unsympathetic to your situation, but it seems like you disadvantaged yourself by waiting too long.   Pure speculation   Exactly. All of this is pure speculation, including where a player should be drafted and how they might affect a team.   You suggest the teams doing a mini draft before the round; this is more or less what happened (from my perspective) as the commissioners offered me the chance to contest for other captains first picks. I didn't want them, and apparently they didn't want my pick. Sure it wasn't held as a draft, but the result was the same. I think if you had a FA slot you would've been offered the same opportunity.    I think the entire free agency system needs a rework to make it fair for all teams and not just the ones getting in early....   Getting in early isn't by choice. It's a result of being disadvantaged. Maybe we could extend the waiting period before free agency starts, or hold a midseason draft like S1."

OLTP,2uuk96,Pimp-My-Alpaca,1 point,Fri Feb 6 12:12:42 2015 UTC,"hi avoke,  I think the ""confusion"" with the ballbusters minors game is not confusing at all. Everything you did was perfectly legal (as was 0.12Rubles game) Esteem was the only OLTP player in the oLTP game, the commentators need to up their game and read the rules and stop spreading false information.  I can't comment on other free-agency situations, but from the 50SBB postion, RF-DOOM was drafted to our team. It was then discovered that RF-DOOM was currently banned for an extended period of time and unable to play for our team at all. (Why a banned player was every allowed in the draft I can't tell you, but it seems someone dropped the ball here). So RF-DOOM was dropped and we acquired Parka. As far as I am aware, all this was done with the commissioners approval."
OLTP,2uuk96,elfitzo,3,Fri Feb 6 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"My original point with the minors game is that StrangeCloud and Streetlamp were saying that they thought it was illegal on stream, and it was never really cleared up. It definitely was legal, just I really think there should be commissioner clarification during the actual event.  Of course RF-Doom had to be dropped, but as a result, Elfitzo has received a massive advantage for what in reality is a really bad draft choice, as Parka would not be near a round 9 pick if he was actually there for the draft packed. Instead of being punished for a bad draft pick, Elfitzo gets rewarded and this case clearly shows why this system is terrible right now."
OLTP,2uuk96,Pimp-My-Alpaca,5,Fri Feb 6 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point Balwas, which is why as a captain I am choosing to not play Parka where possible. I understand that he is better than his 'draft position' displays, and so I'm going to give preference to my other players where possible. I think all captains would be doing this with their team.   Obviously I want to engage in rotation of the team and get everyone some game time, but at the same time I want to give heavy priority to my players that were drafted on draft day.   I, due to having a free agent spot, could have very easily drafted One or Kitsune or Verona, as RF DOOM was the first player to drop out of the competition. But I decided it would be unfair to my team to have this majors level player come in and get regular game time. I want to be devleoping my minors players into better competitors, and blocking that with a majors level player I thought was going to be pretty unfair. As a result I held off, talked to a bunch of FA's that had no OLTP experience, and picked a player who would be happy with the role I had available.  I can't speak for One or Kit, but I know Verona was quite worried about his availability going into the draft with school. He signed up as a FA to not have this 'expectation' put on him to have to play every game at a high level. Drogo also instructed me that he pretty much signed Verona as a training player, he might not get much game time but he'll be there for the teams sessions when he can.  I would agree that the current results do look unfair, but you need to understand that this is not something foreseen, and the way the public is taking it is very 'witch-hunty'. Now that it has happened, commissioners will need to look into prevention alternatives, but it's not something we thought we would 100% have to prepare for in full."
OLTP,2uuk96,Jarradical,3,Fri Feb 6 05:40:35 2015 UTC,"I think all captains would be doing this with their team.   mfw when Kit and One started ahead of omg_shoes and ThisIsJake, who were both there on the day and were R6 and R7 picks respectively...  But seriously, I respect that you're trying to give preference when possible to your other players and I hope other captains follow you with that. I really just want to have some prevention method established for next season (what Hoog suggested sounds good to me) and I hope that this discussion will ensure it is implemented."

OLTP,2uuk96,WumCraka,3,Fri Feb 6 06:36:04 2015 UTC,"I think the subtext is that I and other captains have shrewdly gained advantage via subterfuge. I can't speak as to the other captains, but had tuphat turned up (and communication attempts were made on several occasions by several people) I would've been happy to play him. But he didn't, and I'm short of a minors player. Of course I'm going to take somone who I'm friends with and I can rely on.   And yes, Verona was signed as someone who can come to scrims.

They seemed like they were having a fun time commenting but they need to be careful not to spread false information like this as people will readily believe it.  There are going to be some legit leavings and the mis-hap that occured with RF-Doom is probably one of them. I agree if it was know before the draft that he'd be unable to play he should've been scratched from the packet. Mistakes happen and this is an honest enough one. I just can't shake the feeling thought that some player dropouts where premeditated."

I also know Verona can't play Majors at all, and can't play minors for 4 weeks. So from my perspective, I'd be at a disadvantage if I only had 9 players, and I'm really only at parity with a good player for half a minors season.  The free agency rules were there from the start (well sort of, the Commission has edited several rules since the start of the draft) and everyone had the chance to add to the rules.   Noone is drafting ""fake account"" players. That's against the rules.   Also, I just feel like... there are already players from Majors occasionally dropping down to play minors matches. There are ex majors players outright drafted to play minors. What's the big deal? A cohesive team trumps a team with a star player 9/10 times. Minors has been ""unbalanced"" from the start, and that's fine because it forces people to step up and work together."
OLTP,2uuk96,elfitzo,3,Fri Feb 6 05:42:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not blaming you at all, of course you need to replace a player who may as well not exist. I would be a little pissy if Verona started playing every minors match ahead of people who showed their commitment from the start of the season, but from what I have heard that's not happening and will continue so.  What I'm more annoyed about is that people like One and Kit have (so far) been put ahead of people who were there from the start, have been to trainings and turned up to match days. It is completely unfair on ThisIsJake and omg_shoes, who were drafted in the first 4 rounds on minors and would be expecting to start most minors games based off the commitment they have showed, as well as the rest of the competition assuming that they play a similar role to what it looks like they are doing right now.   Noone is drafting ""fake account"" players. That's against the rule   I never said they were. What I was saying is that a captain could do that and it would end up being the same as a late round pick that will never show up. It's a stupid, exaggerated example but it just shows how easily this system can be manipulated.   There are ex majors players outright drafted to play minors   What do you mean? Are you talking about players drafted in R1-R3? If any captain drafted someone then to specifically play minors I'd be shocked, and IMO would be a ridiculous decision. If you're talking about someone who used to play majors but was drafted after R3, of course that will happen. What I'm annoyed by is that most R8-9 picks are players who are new to the game, who show promise and by the end of the season will have progressed to the point where they've improved a lot in standard. The fact that Rain/Virn have got majors standard offenders for their later picks (Well, Roly was R6, but still. One in R6 is stupid.) and they're playing ahead of the rest of their team is what is annoying me."

I agree that this is a bit unfair and there should be some waiting period between sign up and acquisition allowing all teams/captains to see who is available to fill any empty slots.

OLTP,2uuk96,klosec12,5,Thu Feb 5 09:41:16 2015 UTC,During your team's minors game I was a bit concerned that you were playing despite having playing majors before even though you had a willing player waiting (2NZ) on the bench. I understand that you are the minors captain of your team so you want to lead from the front but I think minors is more about giving people a go than getting a win.   Don't mean to single you out or anything but it would be good if we could have something in the rules preventing oLTP teams from playing an OLTP player when there is a oLTP player available.
OLTP,2uuk96,elfitzo,4,Thu Feb 5 10:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that completely. We did discuss the possibility of having a rule in place at length and eventually decided against it. It is encouraged that minors players are played over the optional major player. (However I must clarify that I was still considered a Minors player during that match.) A technicality I know... semantics aside...  Coming from a Minor's captain perspective and not a commissioner: 2NZ and Amatam (Who was also there) hadn't had enough practice with the rest of the forecast-ed Minor's team. The minors team had put a lot of hours of practice in for the game and it would have been unfair of me to force them to play with a player who wasn't in sync with their game-plan and play-style (Or possibly not ready for a competitive match just yet). That wasn't the only reason but just an example to let you know it wasn't just to win.   Trying to find a balance between people who are on every night or are looking at strats all week long and are eager to perform at a competitive level (Even if it is 'just' oLTP) and people who just turn up on game night and expect to play is going to be a challenge. (Not talking about my team here though. They're all pretty dedicated players which is great!)   I actually don't think that oLTP should be seen as any less competitive as OLTP because there are plenty of players in oLTP right now that could play OLTP but haven't been chosen to step up to the mark yet. oLTP should prepare them for that level of competitiveness... O Contenders is more of a 'let people have a go' type competition, it is just unfortunate we don't have the numbers to have both competitions running consistently at the same time.  I think it is hard for teams with rotational Majors teams (See Fireballs last season) because they'll always come under flack for playing ""Majors"" players... when in reality most of the team could easily be in Majors but teams are limited to 4 people so they get put down to minors.  (It isn't like we played Klosec12 in the minors game :P and their team had Kitsune playing. She is BOSS AS at Tagpro and easily a Majors player :P )  But yeah... ideally it would be best to have Minors players vs-ing Minors players and in general that should be how it plays out. However I don't there should be a rule against it."

Don't go against what the majority wants - With the Auction draft, it was clear the majority wanted it.  Minors - It was clear minors was going to need a bit of a fix, but nothing happened, and here we are. (Such as: More players, No majors, Fix FA & More media about it).  More accountability by the commissioners - let us know what each commissioner decided for each decision, so we know who who's making the bad decisions and who's making the good decisions.

Having the captains of the competition select maps has led to people being bored/annoyed at a lack of variety in MLTP, as captains only select maps they know they can play well. They are not going to test themselves, just the same old boring maps with the same old strategies, over and over again.  With the commissioners picking the maps, we look towards a better balance for the season (I.e. not all offensive maps so a team like BB3 is op, which is what captains may have ended up with), we give all types of teams a chance to play a map that suits them. Captains would not have the collaboration that we had when picking maps. The amount of facebook messaging, google docs work and mumble meetups to decide and deliberate the maps, and even after all that we still didn't get it 100% right. Commissioners will pick maps that work and challenge every team and maps that will benefit rhe competition. Captains will pick maps that they know all about."

Much of our discussion takes place in unofficial areas (not reddit modmail).  Much of our discussion had already taken place before we looked at implementing steps for transparency.  Much of our discussion is relatively boring  I.e. discussing allowances for game times or last night when we discussed the release of a couple of players and their respective FA spots.

OLTP,2uuk96,matt287,5,Thu Feb 5 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Streamers have to give up a lot of their time for it (And remember they're Voluntarily streaming for us). In regards to Minors games that overlap, a lot of them will likely only be recorded but a big part of OLTP is watching the games live and the community getting involved. The streamers and commentators put a lot of effort into what they do so it would suck if one streamer and a pair of commentators only have 3 people watching because the other game is more interesting.   As far as the actual games being played, it isn't going to effect the games, no. But there are only 4 games that aren't allowed to overlap each week and finding a time on a Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon that doesn't overlap with the other 4 matches shouldn't be a problem either.  It's like... Stats don't effect the games either. Literally at all. So why do we bother? But people would be disappointed if they weren't able to follow along with stats or have a fantasy draft/OLTP or a chronicle. Just like people will be disappointed if they're unable to watch all the games live. While it doesn't effect the actual games directly, it does effect the overall competition, hype and general community in ways that can't be directly measured or obviously seen.   I'm by no means saying that the Scheduling system is currently perfect but I do believe it is a big step in the right direction and with some tweaking I think it will be something that is here to stay. As far as overlapping times is concerned, we'll have to keep an eye on it and perhaps come up with solutions that can serve everyone equally."

I was also planning on streaming the entirety of the first week of majors myself (which is why a post was unnecessary), so that we wouldn't have to try to coordinate game times and streamers/commentators/recorders etc. this was done to try ensure that all the games were started on time and everything went smoothly (which for the most part, it did)."

If it were as simple as asking people and teaching people then we would have heaps of people streaming.

OLTP,2uuk96,hoogstra,1 point,Fri Feb 6 07:11:32 2015 UTC,"Can I please have clarification of oLTP player eligibility as it appeared that some ""majors tier"" players were common features of minors matches. And having looked at the rules I think this might be a theme for the whole season.  From the rules for oLTP, I understand the top 4 majors player with greatest OLTP match times are defined as OLTP players for that week, however I find it unclear how many of these players can play oLTP.  Despite being inadvisable, under the rules as I interpret them it is possible to have all oLTP players play majors and OLTP players minors (before week 7).  or even worse have 3 minors players and 1 OLTP defined player make up the majors team, then have that same majors player with the remaining OLTP defined players comprise the minors team.  Unlikely scenarios aside, what I consider a possibly likely scenario:    of the 4 majors defined players, 1 can't make the scheduled time, but the match still goes ahead with a minors player elevated.   For the minors match,    the majors player that missed the early majors match is eligible to play,  one of the majors player that did play is eligible to play the minors player that was elevated is also eligible to play minors team OP with 2 majors, one borderline majors and a skrub minors player as a 4th = rekt   Section II - Teams and Restrictions  Refer to Article II, Section I, subsection b for definition of OLTP and oLTP players  (a) oLTP players can play both in OLTP and ​oLTP matches each week.  (b) OLTP players can only play in one of OLTP oLTP each week.  (c) In each round of the season, one player will be an exception to subsection (b) and is allowed to play in both oLTP and OLTP. There are no restrictions on who this player could be, and it may change from week to week."
OLTP,2uuk96,TagWolas,2,Thu Feb 5 23:08:54 2015 UTC,"Ohk so for the first week Majors players were defined as the top 4 picks for each team.   For following weeks Majors players will be chosen from game time seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UGszUb9oNSI7kK0n4acqIy2b2a7EbWEqIreavpGi6a4/edit#gid=859345843  So since the rubles are at the top of that list, lets take that team as an example. What it currently means is that the Minors side for Monday's game can be chosen from any of the players highlighted Grey (With Zero minutes game time) and if necessary one player from the players highlighted yellow.   the majors player that missed the early majors match is eligible to play, one of the majors player that did play is eligible to play   That part is wrong. Only one of those two players would be eligible to play.  Here is another example:  Week 4 Friday Morning. Lets have this team:  A 60mins  B 60mins  C 55mins  D 60mins  E 45mins  F 20mins  G 20mins  H 0mins  I  0mins  J 0mins  A, B, C and D are majors players (Because they have to most minutes.. in the result of two players having the same amount of minutes I believe it goes back to Draft Order.. So if D = 50mins and E = 50 mins then D would be considered Major)  For the Majors game B cannot make it... So the players are:  Majors Team: A, C, D and E...   HOWEVER... The players considered Major for this week are still:   A, B, C and D  Therefore the minors team can choose from:  E, F, G, H, I and J and ONE player out of A, B, C and D.   Now if F, G, H, I and J have all been turning up to practices and are fully active it is encouraged to play them over E and B however captains are under no obligation to.   Various reasons like: Captain A might want to ensure player B(Who missed out this week) is kept up to Competitive standard OR that play E who usually players with Minors is there to continuing training F, G and H to ensure that they would be ready to step up into Majors at any moment should they need to.    Theoretically the most stacked team they could play for minors would be:  A, E, F and G  A more likely team would be:  B, E, F and G  The most likely teams would be:  B, F, G and H (Seeing as B missed out on the Majors game)  OR  E, F, G and H (Seeing as E is likely minors captain and consistently practices with their minors team)  The most encouraged team would look like this:  F, G, H, I(or J) (Giving your team as much game time as possible is an advantage should you only have 6/10 people turn up one week)... And players that aren't getting game time may try and be traded to a less competitive team where rotation is more likely (Or their skills would be valued more highly.)  However in all of these instances there will never be two Majors players playing for Minors at one time.   Under this hypothetical Week 5 Friday morning would look like this:  A 80mins  B 60mins  C 75mins  D 80mins  E 65mins  F 20mins  G 20mins  H 0mins  I  0mins  J 0mins  Under this hypothetical the ""Majors"" team would have changed to A, C, D and E  I foresee this kind of Rotational Minors, Majors player thing happening quite often this season due to Captains being encouraged to Draft teams of 10 not teams of 4 (As far as Majors is concerned) which gives opportunity for more players to play in Majors which is great! However a side effect of this might be that 'lower' Minors players end up with less chance at playing Minors and might need to be looked at over the season and attended to in Season 4...  It might be that a rule is put in place where a Majors player can only play one half of the minors game. However the reason this rule has been carried over from Season 2 as it is now is because in Season 1 and Season 2 it often happened that a Majors player HAD to play for the Minors team because the Minors players weren't turning up. You could say then: ""Why not force the captains to play their minors players unless they don't have enough?"".. All these hypotheticals were discussed at length, trust me, I was there haha :P.. What could potentially happen though is minors players from one team (Who want their minors to win) could simply not show up on purpose to allow their team to have a competitive edge (Which isn't as far-fetched as it might sound when the later weeks come around) So rather than having the system be game-able or the possibility of teams throwing around accusations at everyone we decided to leave the option up to the captains as a fair-play/ strategic balance rather than leaving room for doubt, accusations and ultimately drama.   It might be in the future that it will be stated that Players who are considered in a Majors player are only allowed to play one half and if they don't have 4 minors players for the second half then their team forfeits.. But that is a rule we can't exactly put in mid-season and will have to be brought up for next season (And with the excellent work Hoog has done writing up a rule book, it shouldn't be too hard for future Commissioners to go through each rule one-by-one as we have done this season).   Haha that was a little long. I hope it cleared some stuff up for you though. Let me know if you have any further questions."

That part is wrong. Only one of those two players would be eligible to play.   I disagree.

OLTP,2u2h97,rnbp,4,Thu Jan 29 12:02:35 2015 UTC,How does the HOOG rating work?
OLTP,2u2h97,hoogstra,8,Thu Jan 29 11:51:54 2015 UTC,"HOOG works very similarly to GASP.  It is basically GASP with a few tweaks to the formula * 10.  The GASP system from last season was taken straight from MLTP. I ran into problems many times when inputting stats because there wasn't enough data, and therefore i would get issues like 'cannot divide by 0'. MLTP never ran into this problem due to the massive amount of players they have.  For this season of MLTP, GASP was updated again, making it more different from the Oceanic GASP. Instead of taking the MLTP GASP for OLTP, I made changes to the old GASP to better reflect our league's numbers and reduce the number of errors (like negative scores).  Because S7 MLTP GASP was now fairly different from S3 OLTP GASP, I renamed it to HOOG because I could.  Last season, Drogo would have had 100 HOOG, and mc ride would have had ~95.5 HOOG."

OLTP,2u2h97,hoogstra,3,Thu Jan 29 12:53:00 2015 UTC,"Yes.  EDIT: Here. This uses the stats from the semi finals. The score on the right is your HOOG D score, which is scored out of 100."

OLTP,2u2h97,hoogstra,4,Thu Jan 29 12:09:14 2015 UTC,"NISH, which stands for Nqoba, Ibis, and Ash, is based on stats per minute, whereas HOOG is based on total stats per minute, but for every minute under the average amount of minutes played, your HOOG decreases. You can get a 100 NISH by only playing 40 minutes, but your HOOG score will be penalised for having less minutes than the average, and you might only get a score of 50"
OLTP,2u2h97,Alleviation,1 point,Thu Jan 29 12:31:22 2015 UTC,"If that's the case then Hoog, would it be possible to have an extra stat to extrapolate the data based on a defined amount of time (e.g. 40 mins), or would that just defeat the purpose and make it like NISH?"
OLTP,2u2h97,hoogstra,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this would make it a lot like NISH in that it would measure pure skill (as well as stats can, which isn't very well), rather than value to the team. If there was an extra stat to extrapolate HOOG then I would imagine it would look very similar to NISH."
OLTP,2u2h97,VehementVexation,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"Say i had an amazing game but dropped out for 2 mins. Does those 2 minutes negate my chance of a POTM, or is the penalty just smaller so that my stats will still be very good?"
OLTP,2u2h97,hoogstra,1 point,Fri Jan 30 23:38:42 2015 UTC,"If you play 2 minutes under the maximum, which, for the sake of the argument, was 2 minutes under average (average = maximum), you wouldn't be able to achieve a 100.0 HOOG, but if you were the actual best player that weekend, nobody would receive a 100.0, and you could still potentially win POTM with a 98.3 or something, depending on how much better you were than everyone else."
OLTP,2u2h97,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"If the point of a penalty is to ensure the stats are not skewed towards players that don't play much, then It seems like in this instance and potentially the span of the season it would make more sense to penalise if you drop below 50% of the maximum minutes played, rather than the average. Doesn't even have to be 50%, could  be 40% or 60%."
OLTP,2u2h97,hoogstra,1 point,Sat Jan 31 07:57:35 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't drop much if you are only 15 or so minutes under the average. Last season, the maximum minutes was 140, and the mean was 84. A player who played 70 minutes would only have their score altered slightly, maybe lose 10 HOOG or so, which is like losing 1 GASP. HOOG decreases logarithmically, so playing 20 less minutes might make you lose 10 or 15 HOOG, playing 40 less could make you lose up to 40 or 50 if you played a perfect game. Otherwise it would be a fraction of that.  What you said would work perfectly fine, but I think the current system does the same, unless you can point out some fatal flaws in the current system."
OLTP,2u2h97,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"I agree it would probably be fine across the length of the season, but deciding weekly POTM's and calculating stats through each round will not always yield accurate results.  Using a percentage will work every single week of the season. Using an average only works some of the time. Seems like an obvious choice to me.

OLTP,2u2h97,hoogstra,2,Thu Jan 29 14:29:04 2015 UTC,It doesn't. I didn't change anything from last season in regards to the value of minutes. GASP always worked like this.
OLTP,2u2h97,Jarradical,2,Thu Jan 29 14:34:33 2015 UTC,"The justification for GASP working like this was that it's a measure of contribution to a team, so playing more = better contribution. In addition to this, it stops players from playing one amazing half and topping season GASP"

Just copy and paste the csvs into an excell document and have certain cells correlate to a different table that looks really nice and has all the relevant stats.  The highlight reel would be tricky-ish as its quite user intensive to do during a stream but if you're up for it, that would be sweet.  Yah a few of us were taking about that and we were 50/50 on it.

OLTP,2si4au,A_K_o_V_A,3,Thu Jan 15 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Battery has its place in the Rotation. It balances well with the other choices. As we were talking about with some others on mumble, it is one a few selections of maps that could be considered ""chaotic"" forcing increased communication.  In my experience maps like Battery, Dz3, Colours etc. can be annoying to play, however teams that work really well together and have fantastic communicative skills will find these maps considerably less annoying and will likely come out with better results. Personally, I would like to see Colors in the rotation and perhaps Dz3 but battery serves this purpose perfectly. The Quality at which it does that will always be up for debate, of course. Out of the maps that would serve this purpose, every single choice would have received a ""I hate this map"" reaction because that is the nature of the maps! They test you! And if your team isn't prepared for it, you're going to hate it."
OLTP,2si4au,fooize,14,Fri Jan 16 05:51:27 2015 UTC,"the perfect response. thankyou very much for listening to the criticism and admitting you were wrong which is something that I know we weren't very good at last season. this whole situation, I think, has been a step forward for OLTP. thanks  all 5 of u <3"
OLTP,2si4au,whoop-there-it-is,10,Thu Jan 15 10:31:11 2015 UTC,"I would also like to further this by talking about the process in the maptest committee.  The decision to add Platypus to OLTP was based off the assumption that MTC were planning on adding it to group rotation. This was my misunderstanding. I had tested the map with the other members of the committee and they all gave it a thumbs up, but they asked me to resubmit it to next thread before they voted it in, otherwise it'd give an unfair advantage to the maptest committee members.  When they said this, I assumed that they were prepared to vote it in at the next thread because they liked it. This turned out to be wrong.  A lot of this fuckup was my bad, so I'll take this one opportunity to single myself out and apologise personally to the MTC for creating confusion, and to OLTP members for misleading you.    I hope you'll come to forgive and not let this mishap influence whether or not you vote for Platypus.  Again, I'm really sorry for the miscommunication between both MTC and OLTP."
OLTP,2si4au,klosec12,5,Thu Jan 15 10:38:20 2015 UTC,I was looking forward to platypus.... I think it would be a fresh look on the map rotation in OLTP.

OLTP,2si4au,klosec12,6,Thu Jan 15 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"So you guys have probably already voted but I just wanted to voice my opinion on what you guys should vote for. IMO, there are only 2 maps that should be considered from this list. This will be a very important map, the last week of the regular season, and the determining factor for many teams for playoff contention. More skill maps, maps that people know, maps that everyone has played a million times and don't require much team work, should be avoided for this week. You should focus on maps that require teamwork. The obvious choice for teamwork is Colors. An old favorite but it also tests the chemistry and communication skills of a team - something that should be very strong after playing 3 months with each other. The other map, I know, I know, is Platypus. It's something NEW. Something that no one has played before (besides Sizzzled). I saw the drama but think about it - A new map that tests team communication rather than individual skill. It's perfect! Plus you all are forgetting that you have THREE MONTHS to prepare (more like 2.5 but still). So it won't be all so new when you have to play it. The other maps, Star, Boombox, Danger Zone 3, are old boring maps that still require some teamwork but individual skill can override the need for teamwork on these maps imo. Wormy is a wildcard, defensive, but can be very close and intense matches for the last week. Still new for competitive but communication is fairly key.   I know, I am some American scrub, but I want to follow OLTP this season, it seems drama-filled and exciting. I would love to see Colors or Platypus for the last week.   Just my 2 cents."
OLTP,2si4au,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Thu Jan 15 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"More skill maps, maps that people know, maps that everyone has played a million times and don't require much team work, should be avoided for this week. You should focus on maps that require teamwork.   I don't think this is necessarily true. Maps which require more fine skill, like DZ, Blast Off, Velocity, etc. are usually more exciting to watch for viewers, and have more 'high-octane' moments; games that are more exciting and close are ideal for R7 which has pretty much single-handedly decided the playoff bracket in S1 and S2.   The obvious choice for teamwork is Colors. An old favorite but it also tests the chemistry and communication skills of a team - something that should be very strong after playing 3 months with each other.   100% agree with you here, but not just because Colors requires teamwork; but it also has a hefty amount of skill required to cap and defend, and has the potential for hugely exciting moments (idk if you've been following OLTP for long but if you can track down the season 1 match between 0.12 Rubles and Cap-22's on Colors, it shows it can be extremely exciting at times, despite what people think).   The other map, I know, I know, is Platypus. It's something NEW. Something that no one has played before (besides Sizzzled). I saw the drama but think about it - A new map that tests team communication rather than individual skill. It's perfect!   The thing is though it doesn't necessarily make it better; see my other point. I don't think it does the communication aspect as well as other maps, so I think there's better options. It's still a good map, just putting it up against Colors, DZ, and even staples like Star and BB, I don't think it's the best choice. Of course if you see Platypus as a great map, by all means vote for it, just I don't expect it to do as well as any other map would.   The other maps, Star, Boombox, Danger Zone 3, are old boring maps that still require some teamwork but individual skill can override the need for teamwork on these maps imo. Wormy is a wildcard, defensive, but can be very close and intense matches for the last week. Still new for competitive but communication is fairly key.   Star and BB are stale, I agree. I don't think DZ is to the same extent, at least not in OLTP. Perhaps it's different in OLTP, but every game I've seen on DZ has been exciting and high-paced. Maybe it's just my bias for the map, heh.  Wormy is quite boring and slow-paced, but doesn't really require much positioning or defensive control; the amount of bombs in the base and boost paths make it really random. I don't like it much for competitive play.   I know, I am some American scrub, but I want to follow OLTP this season, it seems drama-filled and exciting. I would love to see Colors or Platypus for the last week. Just my 2 cents.   Thanks for following. We've had some great matches and I'm sure we'll have some more. :))"

Anyway, I think it's pretty clear that this should be a vote between Platypus and Colours. Platypus has the benefits of being un-played and unique, Colours has the benefit of being very skill/co-ordinative oriented. They're both very good competitive maps and frankly I wish we could have both."

But because you are hiding behind your shitty smurf account, I find it a little difficult to trust that this is real. It isn't difficult to make fake reddit messages.  Anyway I should quote the rule here:   Article VIII - Etiquette    Section I - Etiquette  a) Hate speech will not be tolerated and any player who uses such speech will be immediately banned from the season.   I'm also going to quote another rule:   Article VIII - Etiquette    Section I - Etiquette  Instigating arguments or “stirring the pot” on Reddit or Mumble about issues pertaining to OLTP is punishable by putting someone on a seat with one of those target things where you can dump them in the water if you hit it (as well as game bans).   So while Flame may have broken the rules, it is pretty obvious that you have. I'll be lenient and give you a warning. If you want to talk about this to the commissioners, please send us a modmail. You've only posted this on the subreddit to generate drama, even if it is real. So next time you do this, I'm gonna be the first person to step up and throw the ball.   I'd probably miss the target lol"

OLTP,2rmel5,demothelol,4,Wed Jan 7 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of players use ballparts replays extension, so it will be really easy to give you plays. (Maybe you would want people to use a specific texture pack to render to maintain consistency, although not a biggie IMO)  It was a fucking hassle last season having to go through all the games to find the best plays, and I'm sure during the process I missed a few of them.  Also, maybe you could do top 5 fails as well, that was always fun last season."
OLTP,2rmel5,flappytowel,3,Wed Jan 7 12:19:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking that using ballparts extension they can just upload the clip to youtube and submit that. I'm banking on every game being streamed this season so hopefully players will only have to submit replay extension videos if the game isnt streamed.
OLTP,2rmel5,bugket,4,Wed Jan 7 12:24:50 2015 UTC,"Good thinking to crowd-source the clips, will make life much easier without having to watch every match yourself. I'm down for commentary if you need someone too."

OLTP,2q5y7u,klosec12,6,Tue Dec 23 10:50:01 2014 UTC,"EDIT: The ones that have been struck through have been answered by Commissioners.  Just going through the rules i noticed a few things that i think need clarification or explanation:  Article II, Section II, Subsection C, Point I - What constitutes sufficient notice? What if an emergency arises and the captain does not have the time to notify his team?  Article IV, Section I, Subsection A - Why was this decided as all four involved players needing to agree? Not a criticism, Its just i feel no trades would be completed with this system in place.  Article IV, Section I, Subsection B - Why was a limit placed on how many trades can be performed?  Article V, Section I, Subsection C - Who selects the times each week? What if one team cannot make any of the four allocated times? Who will get first selection? What if four teams all want the same time and none of them can move?  Article V, Section I, Subsection E-F - What if both teams are at fault for delaying the game? What if an emergency arises?  Article V, Section I, Subsection F/G - F is not referenced in G, meaning a team is protected from a forfeit being declared under Subsection F. More a clerical error.  Article VI - Section I, Subsection D - What if there is a need to substitute for a third time under emergency? Are teams forced to play with three players, or must the fourth suffer even though they cannot play?  Article VIII, Section I, Subsection F - This is breaking your own rules (Art VIII/SecI/SubsecD) as the punishment, although intended as a joke, is something that could be seen as undermining the legitimacy of OLTP as a whole.  Article XI, Section II, Subsection D - Which Rules? Clarification for the rules are needed here.  Random Notes:  Kinda annoyed at no Auction Draft, due to the overwhelming community support but i can agree with the reasoning behind the choice not to move forward  Playoffs moving into a more complicated but still simple method, however I feel it is not needed and might make players more jaded. But it does allow the top two teams a bit of safety which is nice.  lol at the match fixing rule  A nice idea for the instigating drama rule, but that kinda seems like we cannot complain about the choices the commissioners make, turning this into a Dictatorship  We have weekly awards?  Still not a fan of the dates of the draft and round 1, as it might mean no Chronicle for the first few weeks (Don't head back to Uni till 2nd week of Feb, meaning Pre Draft/Post Draft/Round 1/Round 2 are unlikely to have a Chronicle), but thats not a major issue for the league  All in all, a reasonably encouraging start - 7/10"
OLTP,2q5y7u,hoogstra,2,Tue Dec 23 12:58:09 2014 UTC,"The reason we went with all four players needing to accept the trade was so that players didn't quit their new team because they preferred their old one and felt wronged. Trades are not expected to be an often occurring thing.  Limits were placed on trades to avoid massive amounts of trades (administrative hell) as well as preventing gaming the trading system by swapping half a team with a friend to create one stacked team.  The times will be selected by the commissioners about two weeks prior to the game. Captains can organise different times if they want to. If they can't organise a time, then you lose.  Captains shouldn't just play with substitutes for fun. They are there for a reason, so don't waste them."
OLTP,2q5y7u,klosec12,3,Tue Dec 23 13:27:49 2014 UTC,"But then why place limits on the amount of trades if you need all four players to commit to it? The only reason i see is administrative hell, and that would not be counted as an excuse should it need all four players to commit."

OLTP,2q5y7u,Jarradical,5,Tue Dec 23 13:52:37 2014 UTC,"First off, congratulations on a very thorough rulebook. I think it will allow this season to run smoothly and professionally.   1: I take it the auction draft is rejected?  2: What's going on with the  playoff rounds? It seems overly complicated, and there is no advantage to coming (first or second), or (third or fourth) like with a standard 1v4 2v3.  3: I am messaging you something else"
OLTP,2q5y7u,Jarradical,8,Tue Dec 23 11:30:59 2014 UTC,"I'll talk about the auction draft since that was a controversial one.  When we came to the decision on that, we had to ask ourselves a lot of questions.  The first one was:   ""Why does MLTP use the auction draft?""   MLTP has tired from using the snake draft 6 consecutive seasons, and with the large playerbase that they have (of 24 teams), they need something to keep the pre-season as alive as the Superball. That means having more teams, more maps, and it means building up as much hype with a unique draft.  ELTP tried to run an auction draft, however in the tester ""season 3.5"", it got a lot of negative feedback. This is largely because ELTP is a smaller playerbase like ours, and something as convoluted as the auction draft ends up taking a lot of effort which detracts from the enjoyment of it.    The second question:   ""Will an auction draft generate fair(er) teams?""   This one is difficult to answer, but based on the way max's pizza tourney went (and the way MLTP draft went), the auction draft does not create more even teams. It's not to say it's necessarily going to be less even that what a snake draft could do, but the answer to this question suggests that an auction is not going to be better than a snake draft.     ""Why do people in Oce community want an auction draft?""   Two main reasons have been highlighted for why a majority of people wanted an auction draft: it generates more hype, and it rewards smarter captains  For the first reason, we believe that we have had a lot of interest surrounding each draft in S1, S2, with no real decline. We are not at any shortage of hype in OLTP, and the draft is not an exception to that.  For the second, there is currently a shortage of captains - which means we're likely to end up with captains who aren't necessarily as good as the ""vet captains"". This means captains who are fill-ins are going to have a hard time and could end up having an awful season as a result.  Furthermore, the snake draft offers a lot of variation for strategy (as last season proved), so smarter captains will be rewarded - however, the size of that reward is significantly smaller.     ""What is the likelihood of the auction draft going sour, and what are the consequences if it does?""   The reason it worked in MLTP was because they hosted a very, very large number of tournaments that tested various versions of an auction draft so that it could function the best it could for them. The reason it went sour in ELTP was because they didn't have the time to prepare, and they didn't have the captains to perform.  OLTP is a lot more comparable to ELTP in many regards, and this is no different.  We have half a month until the draft, and we have have the same playerbase. Based on those two leagues, it's fairly likely it will go poorly.  Now, when it does go sour, there are a lot of consequences for that - the first and worst one is that we have people leave the community. While you might say it's unlikely that people will leave based on the draft, you could also say it's unlikely people will leave the community because of powerup timers. Oh, wait.  Another major problem is that we end up with imbalanced teams - which will jeopardize the entire season of OLTP. Ask Avoke, kitsune, Dima, manballpig what it feels like to go into every single game of OLTP knowing that you're probably going to lose. It's not fun. Imagine this on a significantly bigger scale.    tl;dr, it's not worth risking an entire season of OLTP just so we can generate a tad more hype."

OLTP,2q5y7u,hoogstra,3,Thu Dec 25 08:12:59 2014 UTC,"I think I""ll chime in here. While we were always optimistic about our chances of winning, I think our team morale was pretty low. Keep in mind that towards the end of the season we had many players MIA or not responding to messages. At the time i was very thankful of our minor players; kinghit, djn and contrail  for stepping up and helping us with majors. I throughly enjoyed playing with them and Kitsune and would happily do so again even if we lost every game.  All I'm saying is it often felt like a team of veterans vs a PUG. While it was a very fun PUG team, I think we knew that we were unlikely to beat the veteran team who was more experienced in tagpro and had better team cohesion on account of their previous OLTP matches."

Those that finish 3rd and 4th will need to win three consecutive games to win the Premier Ball. Those that finish in the top 2 will only need to win two in succession. We did this to extend the finals series and to give the top 2 an advantage, as in previous seasons, there was no difference to finishing 1st or 4th."

(b) A team must either win both of these games, or win and tie, to advance to the next round. If this condition is not met, the teams will play an additional ‘overtime’ game.   If I've interpreted this correctly, you could win 1 half 15-0 and then lose 1 half 1-2 and then you'd have to play an overtime game? That doesn't seem particularly fair to me. I can't recall of any real life sports which have something implemented."
OLTP,2q5y7u,bugket,6,Tue Dec 23 11:42:09 2014 UTC,"They are two different games, and we treat them like that. If one is a narrow loss and one is a win, then that is a win and a loss. The way I see it is that a team loses 15-0, and then before the next game, realises that they cannot compete with the other team with their current game plan, so they change it, which results in a narrow 2-1 win.

The main argument i've heard against it is a risk of unfair teams or players quitting due to not being drafted, but do we not already face that with snake? There is always going to be captains who draft better than others, the format of that is irrelevant. In the last two season's we've also had maybe 2(?) players that I know of quit due to not getting drafted, it hardly seems like that will increase for not getting drafted for majors."

Pls consideroni especially considering the obvious feedback shown by this community.  Edit: also we saw it work in the MLTP auction draft, so it works well and is proven."
OLTP,2pumwl,demothelol,6,Sat Dec 20 04:14:44 2014 UTC,"Okay there are a few ways to actually do this. I thought about it a lot before learning we could use their website. If you guys don't want to run it on an external website we can easily do it through IRC  -  All captains and a host go into a private IRC channel. The host is also in mumble as the sole speaker in a room simply so everyone can hear what's going on. Captains are given $100 at the start of the night. A player is nominated and the host starts the bidding. Captains type their bids in the chat, if two bids are of the same value the host reads out the one that came first.  Host: ""Next up is Radian, we'll start the bidding at $60""  -- no bids --  Host: ""$50""  elfitzo types: $50  Host: ""Elfitzo for $50""  Rain types: $52  Host: ""Rain for $52""  -- no bids --  Host: ""Can anyone beat $52 for Radian?""  -- 20 seconds later --  Host: gavel thump Rain buys Radian for $52  Then we just have another player from the community update a spreadsheet we can all look at with this information - the players that have been assigned to teams, their price, and how much the captain has remaining.    The boring bits -   No captain can bid $100 on one player. Maximum bid is $99. This is to ensure all captains will only need one player at most after their money runs out. After a captain's money runs out they are added to the draft queue. After the auction we run through these captains in the order of when their money ran out. They can pick any remaining player to make up their third and final majors pick as per a normal draft. The host will type in the chat a message when the bidding for each player opens (something like ""$50"" or whatever the minimum asking bid is at that stage), so that there's a fair fight between two captains with equal money bidding the same amount and not one captain jumping the gun to get their bid in first. The player nomination process is up to commissioner discretion. We could just run through season 2 gasp order with new players being slotted in wherever the commissioners feel is fair (this wouldn't need to be too accurate) or we can just do the MLTP idea of each captain takes a turn to nominate the next player. So for example, we order the captains into some list (like we did for previous drafts) and they take turns nominating the next player to be bid on after the previous auction. The former has the benefit of everyone knowing the order of events, the latter has the benefit of there being more excitement for the community (by not knowing who's going to be next). If a captain has three players already they no longer nominate players for auction. Minimum bid increment is $1 If desired we could also have someone in the IRC room streaming their screen. But only captains and the host are allowed to talk. I expect at stages that the bidding will go quite fast in $1 increments. The host wouldn't need to read all of these out when they're going faster than he can speak but something like ""Klosec and Hoog bidding vehemently over mc ride here, $50, $51, $52... etc.""     I may have left something out of the above. I wasn't expecting to write this out just now so even though I've spent quite a lot of time making sure this was foolproof I may well have forgotten to mention something. If you would like to know anything more about this system please ask questions below.  I really like the idea of keeping it off a purpose built website and on something familiar like mumble + IRC and I think this method could work really well and be a lot of fun for everyone.  I'm also more than keen to host it if you guys would like me to, as I have some (very minor) experience doing this sort of thing and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Cheers    Edit: Just like to stress that I have nothing against using that bloke's website. It went well for them, I just trust mumble + IRC a bit more than this purpose built website. Plus ping would be important in something like this (to get the first bid in after the auctioneer opens the bidding) and I mean when I've commented on twitch and what not it always takes forever to get the message listed. With things like IRC that are designed to be low ping chat, and have millions and millions of users testing it out - I'd trust it to be a bit more fair.  Double Edit: Demo is running an auction draft tourney just after new years. I propose we try to use their website for it, and if everything goes smoothly we use it for OLTP instead of mumble+IRC. OP asked for detailed ways in which we could do it though, so all the other rules would still hold and are up for discussion, just using the website to actually host it instead of IRC."

Diverting away from that for the draft may take some of the quality of the season out (Potentially, although we do have a lil bit more time to organize things).   Another concern is that if the auction draft went wrong (Or a team feels they're at a completely unfair advantage) then there is a fairly high risk of drama. Going for a snake draft, which everyone knows, is a lot safer. An Auction draft is basically a gamble draft and gambling is often game-able. I can think of many ways potential Captains could attempt to screw over other captains and team up to ensure two teams are a lot strong than the rest of the competition etc. etc. Some might see this as captains using initiative and some might see this as unfair and against the spirit of the game (Just because a captain is bad at politics, does that mean that captain should lose a competition?  shouldn't OLTP be more about Tagpro and not politics??)  Again, if something went wrong in the Auction draft for MLTP and people left...Well they have plenty of people to fill those roles and their isn't a great deal of risk involved (Also their community is much larger and seems a lot more disjointed than ours).  If something went wrong in our draft and people left then it would effect OLTP, oLTP and our community a lot greater. The risk is higher and the reward is only slightly more hype (For players that'll likely play OLTP regardless, it wouldn't bring in many new players), a more interesting draft to watch and the potential for teams to start off with more chemistry etc. if everything goes well.   Any more ideas to the contrary or simply just for or against an auction draft would be greatly appreciated. That's what this thread is for :)"
OLTP,2oms6z,herpaderp1995,4,Tue Dec 9 09:22:11 2014 UTC,The worst point for an auction draft IMO  is that the captains actually have to turn up with a plan. Traditionally that aspect of the season has been pretty ad lib
OLTP,2oms6z,elfitzo,3,Tue Dec 9 10:40:55 2014 UTC,Apparently ELTP hates it though
OLTP,2oms6z,waiheke,2,Mon Dec 8 20:09:44 2014 UTC,"MLTP also has a keeper system already in place, which aids their drafting, and players values/abilities are much clearer in MLTP. In OLTP, we've only had 2 seasons, and we don't really know if many people are consistent enough to stay at the top, nor do we have the history that MLTP has."
OLTP,2oms6z,HeikkiKovalainen,3,Mon Dec 8 20:24:15 2014 UTC,I think its a good idea. It would allow captains to get the players they want.
OLTP,2oms6z,Pimp-My-Alpaca,3,Mon Dec 8 11:52:36 2014 UTC,"An auction draft for the first three rounds would be brilliant. We have excellent timing for it too, since ours would be after MLTP's has been fully finalised with any problems identified. Further they would have already ironed out the kinks by previous auction drafts too. Also since their league is substantially bigger than ours it'll be a lot easier, faster, and more fun for us too (especially since we all know each other and have an idea of what each player might go for).  Further it benefits intelligence.  Also since everyone basically agrees with the previous statement it would cause less serious captains to not apply since it's more work right off the bat. We would likely have captains who are more equipped and serious about oltp.  Lastly it's just a cool thing to do. I think everyone agrees it'd lead to less balanced teams (but not to a massive extent) though the vast majority of non-commissioners here think it'd be a cool idea. They don't really mind if the teams are slightly less even, but say radian and flame play really well together, then radian has more power to get him (yes I agree it's not guaranteed but that's the point - flame would simply be worth more to radian's team than to any others). It combines all the benefits of keeper type systems, e.g., increases team dynamics, benefits players who play better together than independently and importantly boosts camaraderie within teams."
OLTP,2oms6z,drinkbleachtag,2,Wed Dec 10 10:15:25 2014 UTC,"I was talking to Demo on mumble about it earlier and we both agreed it seem like a fantastic idea. Adds a new dynamic to the start of a season, and gives an advantage to captains who are more intelligent in their picking. Also the hype levels for it would be so amazing   Oh, and seeing all the different tactics will be interesting too. I wonder if it would be better to pick 1 or 2 players who can hold their own in Majors and then get a couple of really good players or to pick a strong team all round."
OLTP,2oms6z,Pimp-My-Alpaca,1 point,Mon Dec 8 11:08:14 2014 UTC,"Completely agree, but how do you think an auction draft will give an advantage for captains who pick intelligently instead than the normal snake draft? In my thinking, an auction will disadvantage captains that have specific ideas for who they want to draft.   Rather than captains getting free reign over any player they think is undervalued, once the captain announces they want somebody, that player then gets tossed around and bidded on which could artificially drive up the price. Normally that might've just been a sneaky value pick for that captain and instead they lose out because all the other captains know they want them and have the opportunity overvalue them."
OLTP,2oms6z,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Tue Dec 9 08:08:52 2014 UTC,"I get what you mean, and it definitely will disadvantage captains with very specific ideas. I just think that the ability to pick up a player on a bargain now becomes much more important as you can outbid the competition for the top end targets, ergo emphasis on smarter picking.  It will be much more dynamic for captains, you can't just go in with a list of players you want as some will go for way too much. I think it would be better to go in with a rough estimate on how much you want to bid on all the players, and as the draft goes on you will have to constantly be looking for players who are being undervalued, which will greatly change some captain's plans and then require further thinking for who will pair with them and so on. For me though, this adds so much to the spectacle of it though, and I would be really disappointed if there was no auction draft."
OLTP,2oms6z,Avoke6,1 point,Tue Dec 9 09:09:25 2014 UTC,"Yeh for sure, it will add a dynamic aspect and a whole new element that the better captains will probably rise to more so than others.  I'm mostly for it, other than the main drawback I've already mentioned. Most of the true player scouting will happen before the draft and I still think captains should be rewarded for finding value in players that others don't. Having an auction may jeopardise the benefit those captains would otherwise receive."
OLTP,2oms6z,fooize,3,Tue Dec 9 11:12:08 2014 UTC,"On the other hand it would equalize the top picks and make them fairer for all the captains. If we were to use OLTP 2 as an example. Flame was the first pick of Bobbay's meaning that none of the other captains got a chance to pick him; locking out a top teir defender so early and putting more value on the remaining top tier defenders. Using the auction system all captains would get a fair shot at being able to pick him if they are willing to part with a larger portion of their allowance then the other captains are willing to go to.  It also pressured the captains early picks as they had to decide who to use their picks on before they had to sit a whole round or two worth of drafts. Whereas in an auction as long as their money held up they would never miss out on players they wanted and it opens up a whole slew of potential strategies. Do you blow your budget on two veterans and pick up a super cheap rookie you've been scouting or do you draft a balanced team using your budget.   Also I feel like there is still a good chance for captains to find value picks later in the auction or if it transfers to a snake draft which rewards captains scouting before the draft. Those value drafts will still occur, whether they be picked up cheaper then they are worth during the auction, or are just overlooked until the last few drafts there are still rewards for the captains who research the field thoroughly.    IMO the auction system gives a fairer platform from which the captains can have access to all the players equally where as the snake draft is much more restricted in who you can draft at any given time.   That is just my two cents on the situation. I'm only posting this to try and improve the fairness of the oceanic competition because I feel at times the tournaments and matches are quite unbalanced *cough Region Wars cough"
OLTP,2oms6z,Avoke6,2,Tue Dec 9 12:03:17 2014 UTC,That is just my two cents on the situation. I'm only posting this to try and improve the fairness of the oceanic competition because I feel at times the tournaments and matches are quite unbalanced *cough Region Wars cough   lol  also I think something people are overlooking is the potential for trades to be much more valuable using the auction draft system. The addition of coins as a currency in addition to straight player trades makes it much more strategic from a captain's perspective (like I could pick up a player I don't want in order to trade them to a captain who does want them + some coins).
OLTP,2oms6z,fooize,1 point,Wed Dec 10 12:29:10 2014 UTC,"Exactly, although another use for the coins should be implemented as they would be pretty pointless after the auction draft which is when most of the trades would happen. Maybe a mid season draft/trade? Or other ideas."
OLTP,2oms6z,elfitzo,1 point,Wed Dec 10 13:36:33 2014 UTC,Normally that might've just been a sneaky value pick for that captain and instead they lose out because all the other captains know they want them and have the opportunity overvalue them.   but then you wait until the later rounds when they've blown their budget and don't see spending 20 coins on SMACK or whoever as worth it when other more well-known names are available. I think you've just got to be more careful about who you draft when there's a lot of money on the table still
OLTP,2oms6z,Jarradical,1 point,Wed Dec 10 12:33:28 2014 UTC,"I'd be interested to know how it would be structured. You said you looked at the MLTP thing, would you want to follow the same format as that?"

OLTP,2oms6z,cheesynirvana,4,Thu Dec 11 03:01:44 2014 UTC,"I'll probably think more about potential ideas over the next few days but off the top of my head:   Make the season longer than the previous seasons. Last season seemed like it was over pretty quickly, leaving almost no time for teams to improve/learn to work together. This could be done by maybe having teams play each other twice or smth Possibly change up the format of the games. I really liked playing in the playoff format and wondered how well a similar format could do for the regular season games More organisation for game times between captains, streamers and to a lesser extent commentators I also really like the idea of having some kind of keeper system to encourage continuity in oltp which in time would increase the league's quality imo. If we do choose to go ahead with an auction draft we could give the captains additional keeper points when bidding for a former player like mltp did Also I would really like to have one of the maps for this season to be chosen by the community through a vote"

OLTP,2oms6z,Spectrum_Yellow,5,Tue Dec 9 06:11:51 2014 UTC,Even more drama. Take into account the stupid things done last season and create rules to deter them. e.g. that minors game with major players and playing as a banned player. Boobs Maybe you have to play minors players if they're online for a minors game before you can think about using a major player.
OLTP,2oms6z,VehementVexation,2,Mon Dec 8 14:50:42 2014 UTC,"yeah that 4th is super good. heaps of captains were playing their majors players instead of their minors just because they wanted to win, even in like playoffs. The major player rule should be a just in case thing."
OLTP,2oms6z,WumCraka,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:44:11 2014 UTC,Boobs   👍
OLTP,2oms6z,flappytowel,3,Tue Dec 9 07:43:57 2014 UTC,"Dunno if you guys still want some feedback, but I'll give you some from my perspective anyway which will probably just go over what other people have said. Also just like to preface this by saying that I haven't really been part of OLTP before and these are what I see as an 'outsider' that should be addressed.  Firstly, the organisation side of scheduling games and streamers and commentators and overall hype (which will come with better organisation) needs to be improved. I am fully aware and confident that you guys know this and see it as a very important matter. Won't go into detail here as it seems you guys have this aspect under control.   Secondly, I think regardless of the number of teams next season, be it 8 or 10 or 742, I think that teams should play each other twice. A 7/9/741 game regular season doesn't seem long enough and having teams play against each other twice can help to smooth out 'irregular' results, while also rewarding teams that practice and strategise against certain opposition. Surely rewarding commitment and team play should be seen as ideal as opposed to winning on individual brilliance.   Thirdly, regarding the type of draft (auction or normal), this is a matter that I believe should be discussed with captains as they are the ones who are ultimately going to be most affected by any change in the selection process.   Think that's about it for now. If I think of anything else that strikes me as important, I'll let you guys know."
OLTP,2oms6z,someballone,3,Sun Dec 14 17:32:38 2014 UTC,"I think that teams should play each other twice   Say there are ten teams this season, that would mean there would have to be over 20 games (including playoffs) and over 20 weeks of play time. I don't know about you, but I don't really want to spend nearly half the year playing tagpro"
OLTP,2oms6z,flappytowel,3,Sun Dec 14 22:21:54 2014 UTC,How about 2 games a week?
OLTP,2oms6z,demothelol,2,Mon Dec 15 01:00:14 2014 UTC,it's hard enough getting one game finished each week lol
OLTP,2oms6z,WumCraka,2,Mon Dec 15 01:08:48 2014 UTC,"Except most of the time its just played on sunday, if we extended it out throughout the week we could easily fit 2 30 minute games in"
OLTP,2oms6z,elfitzo,1 point,Mon Dec 15 01:16:27 2014 UTC,"I understand that, but it's not like you aren't gonna play tagpro at all in between seasons.

OLTP,2mfsm8,demothelol,4,Sun Nov 16 10:03:24 2014 UTC,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know recent studies of the Qing Empire indicate a turn towards approaching and understanding the northern borderlands of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Xinjiang “on their own terms.” Rather than reinforcing the idea of a purely exploitative relationship between the center and periphery, these historians have sought to restore agency to local actors in order to show a mutual exchange (but oftentimes momentarily so) between empire and its frontiers. Within this imagined space of what Richard White calls “the middle ground” (The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), various individuals cooperate to create a new world of meaning out of their miscommunication. In Transforming the Frontier: Land, Commerce, and Chinese Colonization in Inner Mongolia, 1700-1911, the Hetao/Ordos region emerges as one such space—a nexus of social, economic, and religions transactions between herders and farmers, merchants and missionaries, nobles and officials. Yi Wang’s sweeping and yet detailed study challenges the popular narrative of dispossession and marginalization in Qing Inner Mongolia. Instead it points towards a series of “more complex and mediated changes in economic practices, property regimes, and political reconfigurations” (p. 439). In historiography, Qing Inner Mongolia has become the overlooked, dead zone crossed over by camel caravans, saddled with brick tea and silk, on the way to Kiakhta, Kashgar, Kokand, and beyond. Few works as comprehensive as Wang’s dissertation have come out in the English language on this region during this period over the last several years. Thus, Wang must respond to Owen Lattimore and his original conceptualization of “the frontier” from the 1940s; she critiques the Western-impact model of railroad modernity disrupting the cyclical conflict between nomadic and sedentary peoples. Reading local archival documents against the latest scholarship by Chinese, Japanese, and (most importantly) Mongol historians, Wang seeks out the domestic causes of this transformation on the steppe. She identifies three primary vectors of Han migration in Inner Mongolia, sometimes intertwining, other times undermining each other: commercial expansion, land reclamation, and Catholic proselytism, which make up the content of her chapters. The first two chapters of the dissertation give a geographical and social overview of Inner Mongolia in the late imperial period. In locating Inner Mongolia in both time and space, Wang begins with a provocative idea: early modernity, as it emerged through the nation-state system, allowed for a “sleight of hand” in which a territorially-defined “Mongolia” came to replace a tribally-based “Mongol” in a new epistemology, and in so doing, linked together the land to its people and subsumed them under state control (p. 21). Throughout the eighteenth century, Wang writes, Inner Mongolia witnessed dramatic internal changes quite separate from the external pressures of Han migration: a centralizing bureaucracy in Beijing consolidated clan lineages into fixed banners and migrant communities into official prefectures; the rise of Tibetan Buddhism fostered the growth of trade towns around temples and lamaseries, but led to deep inequalities between clergy and laity; and finally, a monetary economy based in silver rendered the barter system obsolete, resulting in inescapable patterns of usury and indebtedness. She then focuses on the Hetao/Ordos region, an area cradled by the arms of the Yellow River. For Wang, the duality of Hetao/Ordos represents a contested site between civilization and barbarianism, where two ideological systems of knowledge compete as prelude to the clash between China and Europe in Lydia Liu’s “Birth of a Super-Sign” (The Clash of Empires: the Invention of China in Modern World Making. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2004). The remaining four chapters examine the overlapping processes of marketization, agriculturalization, and Christianization in the Hetao/Ordos region. Wang begins with the history of two discrete, transitory groups, merchants and farmers who “cross the western pass” (Ch. zou xikou) after the Ming had negotiated with Altan Khan to reopen the horse fairs. In Chapter 3, the Great Wall as a military barrier between these two powers slowly opened up as an economic gateway for petty peddlers, itinerant brokers, and large banking firms. Wang specifically looks at the firm Dashengkui in order to explain the mechanisms of market penetration in the eighteenth century. Simultaneously, migrants sought out opportunities to work on Manchu estates or rent out Mongol rangelands. Jasaghs and other banner nobles often petitioned the state to open up these pastures in south Ordos for cultivation, despite repeated bans from Beijing. To retrieve the voices of these farmers, Wang analyzes examples from the folksong genre “mountain tunes” (Ch. shanqu), recorded by ethnographers in the 1950s, to characterize cultural transmission between Mongols and Han as “two way traffic” (p. 218). Nevertheless traders and farmers—at first two disparate communities—merged to form a powerful figure in Hetao/Ordos in the latter half of the nineteenth century: the land-merchant. As discussed in Chapter 4, land-merchants “combined capital with cultivation” by investing in irrigation projects and managing grain production along canals flowing into the Yellow River. According to Wang, the arrival of the land-merchant signaled “a new trend of … capital intensive, profit-oriented colonization” (p. 233). These drastic economic and ecological changes led to violent confrontations between herders and farmers, which imply that the fault lines on the steppe did not necessarily lie along ethnic divides. Rather, banner aristocracy just as often allied with peasants against nomads. Private land became increasingly concentrated among the upper classes, leaving behind a shrinking commons for the poor. While Han migration already intensified land pressure in the nineteenth century, the involvement of Catholic churches in territorial acquisitions throughout Inner Mongolia made the situation unbearable. Chapter 5 centers on the Scheut missions, which bought up large tracts in the banners in order to attract migrant converts to farm. These aggressive reclamation tactics rankled Mongols, leading to conflict and resistance—land occupations, church burnings, enslavement, and indiscriminate slaughter, with the final wave of violence coinciding with the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Certainly, the Christian presence in Inner Mongolia illustrates how Han migration and Western imperialism reinforced each other through land reclamation, but Wang notes the ultimate irony in this collaboration: over the long run, these missionaries—even as agents of Western imperialism—had inadvertently helped to incorporate the Mongol territories into the emerging Chinese nation-state. After the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing exacted payment from the Mongol banners through the official sale and taxation of their territory in order to settle foreign indemnities. To sell and tax plots, the state set up reclamation bureaus to measure, map, and categorize some 1.5 million acres in this area. Chapter 6 shows how reformist writings by Manchu and Han officials established these new institutions in order to bring the jasaghs under more direct rule. Yigu, the imperial commissioner in charge of land reclamation in central Inner Mongolia, for example, threatened the more obstinate jasaghs that they would lose their positions if they did not comply with the New Policies. While Wang describes this process of dispossession as “multiple levels of negotiations and mutual accommodations,” it eventually led to the integration of the Mongol territories into a nationalized administrative structure (p. 381). For Wang, “the middle ground” provides a framework in which she can reinterpret complex power relations—relations that others have previously dichotomized as Han versus Mongol, colonizer versus colonized, East versus West. As such, Wang describes an elaborate narrative over two centuries that transcends the usual categories of ethnicity, class, and nation. The dissertation compels us to reconsider the capital investments, land grabs, development projects, and ethnic tension so prevalent in Inner Mongolia today not as products of the present but systemic repercussions of a more distant past."

I agree about having commissioners, and presumably the work load won't increase drastically however  what I'm trying to get at is multiple times there were community issues that weren't handled very smoothly from the commissioners (opinionated observation). What I would like to see is a community vote appeal or something similar where a panel of Maybe 20-30 active members of the community can voice their concerns on a matter at hand.  Maybe I'm overestimating the amount of drama that occurs but I feel a system like this could have resolved some issues more soundly.   I think the commissioners are doing a good job however and OLTP would have never gotten this far without the dedication of those willing, so thanks guys."

OLTP,2kdxxd,flappytowel,0,Mon Oct 27 03:07:50 2014 UTC,the captains would make decisions based on what they want for their team. huge bias
OLTP,2kdxxd,Jonathanan,3,Mon Oct 27 03:32:08 2014 UTC,Why were the commissioners able to be captains then?
OLTP,2kdxxd,elfitzo,2,Tue Oct 28 06:26:29 2014 UTC,"By that logic we would have to refrain all commissioners from competing in OLTP, as they would have some sort of bias towards their team over others.  Firstly, we would ideally pick people who would not be subject to bias decisions, the commissioners should be people who are able make as objective a decision as possible and to make the right decision that benefits the community, not the one that benefits themselves.  Secondly where there was any sort of bias involved, the commissioner(s) in question sit out on the discussion and voting.  I think we should pick the best people for the job and hope they fulfil our trust in them. The alternatives include; forcing people who are captains to be a commissioner; or not picking the best people for the job based on the caveat that maybe we can avoid some bias if an issue arises.  Pick those most suited and willing for the position, and then worry about avoiding bias, not the other way around."
OLTP,2kdxxd,Jonathanan,-1,Mon Oct 27 03:40:40 2014 UTC,"Bias will always exist, what I mean is that captains have distinctly more power over a player in a team (voting, scheduling games, etc) therefore their bias becomes more of an influence.  Indeed and I am suggesting is that having people in bias positions is a bad idea if we want to avoid anything.  I understand that with a low player pool it is unavoidable for overlap roles but with our numbers growing I don't see any reason for a commissioner to be a captain unless all of the other captains get voting rights also, allowing a select few of a group have more power then the others is allowing bias to exist."
OLTP,2kdxxd,hoogstra,0,Mon Oct 27 07:06:37 2014 UTC,"More commissioners would probably just lead to slower decision making. Finding a majority between 4 or 5 people is easier than for 8 people.  Also, some people would be good commissioners but poor captains and vice versa.  I would consider your proposal though."
OLTP,2kdxxd,Jonathanan,3,Tue Oct 28 02:58:47 2014 UTC,"You make a good point about some players being better captains then commissioners, I understand captains might not want that position. It just feels like they don't have much of a say in the on goings of the structure of OLTP, I just want to see a larger, more accurate representation of the community when it comes to decision making, and voting. I can see how having a larger number of representatives  could make the process longer, perhaps the vice captains can play the role when their captains aren't available."

OLTP,2kdxxd,TagWolas,5,Mon Oct 27 03:02:36 2014 UTC,"that makes no sense though, shouldn't the s3 commissioners decide when the season starts"
OLTP,2kdxxd,elfitzo,0,Mon Oct 27 03:11:41 2014 UTC,"Not really, if its going to be February, that's a long time away. Who I'd want to be a commissioner now is very different to who i'd want to be a commissioner in February. Also, peoples interest changes, especially when it's going to be a few months, the commissioners may not even want to be a commissioner by the time the next season starts.   It seems not very smart to start the season during the holidays as everyone has different availability, but if your really worried, maybe the current commissioners should decide when the next season should be?"
OLTP,2kdxxd,TagWolas,1 point,Mon Oct 27 11:29:23 2014 UTC,"It's not gonna be Feb - it'll be mid January most likely.  Also, it gives the commissioners more time to gauge what the community wants - work out what maps people want the most, what kind of systems we want to use, and allows us to host various tournaments to see what kind of things work (for example, if we want to use a new draft system, we can make some special tournaments where we make the draft as interesting as possible, e.g. an auction draft, keeper system, etc.)."
OLTP,2kdxxd,Jarradical,2,Mon Oct 27 14:44:59 2014 UTC,"it's the consensus of the current commissioners that February is the most likely date.    I'm not picking on you, rather using your words as an example. I don't think that's a fair point to make. The current crop of commissioners were selected for Season 2 and Season 2 only. It is my belief that there should be no further organisation, whether it be timing of the competition, how many teams, whether captains should be commissioners, how the commissioners will be decided etc. by the S2 commissioners. It is not your job, and furthermore it is taking away responsibility from those that are elected for Season 3 provided we go with elections again.  To have the current commissioners decide anything (even the most minor of things) for Season 3 is wrong. You've done your job, but your contract is for S2 and S2 only.  I disagree with the idea that we should hold off on picking commissioners because the competition is a while away. Picking them later just provides them with less time for organisation, and thus we as the users will receive a reduced quality product. The more time they have to refine and perfect whatever rules and systems they can come up with, the better it is for all of us.  If any decisions need to be made in the interim period regarding Season 3, they should not be made by the Season 2 commissioners.  On that point, I would like to thank the Season 2 commissioners for all their hard work, I imagine it's not easy to handle all the dealings that goes on in our soap opera we call OLTP, so thankyou."
OLTP,2kdxxd,someballone,0,Sun Oct 26 23:36:52 2014 UTC,"The commissioner system is not the best. Try to use your common sense here. They don't need 4 months to organize.  The only thing that's going to result in a reduced quality product is people making dumb decisions based off a system people made up out of the blue and not making decisions with common sense.  ""If any decisions need to be made in the interim period regarding Season 3, they should not be made by the Season 2 commissioners."" yep, your wrong there. Common sense dictates that they are the only ones who CAN make the decision. A vote this early would not work from the points rain has said.  A popularity contest every season is not the way to select the Commissioners. It's just going to create a really crappy season."
OLTP,2kdxxd,A_K_o_V_A,2,Mon Oct 27 00:31:57 2014 UTC,"Disparaging the election as a popularity contest is a) disingenuous and b) unhelpful. Common sense is subjective. And honestly, for deciding who runs an online html5 game competition, the instant runoff ballot system we used for season 1 (which was arduously cross-checked against a google form and user accounts by several committed members of the community to ensure accuracy)  seems perfectly adequate in my opinion.   How do you suggest we select the commissioners?"

OLTP,2jzw8c,VehementVexation,6,Wed Oct 22 16:57:35 2014 UTC,"I forgot to include this quote by our glorious leader, Hoog:  The Premier Ball is what defines the season. It is the match that can create or destroy a legacy. It can make or break a season. Two teams will face off in the most intense match in OLTP history. Everything is on the line.  A message to the players: This game is different. The nerves will be higher than for any other game, and you will make mistakes early. The only advice I can give, as a Premier Ball MVP myself, is that those who take on the challenge, those who take risks, and those who want to win the most are the ones who will finish this season as our new champions.  Rain and Radian know too well how painful falling at the last hurdle can be, after losing to Balls to the Wall in Season 1. This weekend, they will be out for redemption, to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs, bringing along their new teammates to the ultimate glory.  Many say this game is for the Spikedelic Death Caps to lose. They finished 2nd on the table this season and are known for their strong holding game and smart use of decoys, with ayy_lmao and Ball Drogo using their skills superbly. We will see how this game plan holds up on GeoKoala in the coming days. Both Ball Drogo and Verona will be finally playing in a Premier Ball after losing in the semis last season.

OLTP,2iuaha,pelirrojo,1 point,Fri Oct 10 11:09:53 2014 UTC,"First of all, I've been getting shit spawns all season.  Second of all, it wasn't a lucky wall bounce.

If they're in your position (which they sometimes are), you'll bounce around them.  Also, your team sux."

OLTP,2i443e,TeeJayPow,16,Thu Oct 2 18:33:32 2014 UTC,"I know I haven't been around the community for as long but I'll throw my two cents in. I started playing tagpro after hearing about its community and inevitably that eventually brought me to mumble. What I found was just a bunch of guys (and a few gals) hanging out and just enjoying a fun little game online. PUGs were a more structured, spirited competition for a bit of fun, and then competitions and OLTP were just the next step in maintaining this competitive, but overall light-hearted spirit of the community. It shouldn't be a stage for every man and his soapbox each week.  As a personal note, I've got a pretty fractured relationship with most of my real life social groups and get pretty intense anxiety from time to time. The friendly mumble community has been my go to when I need a pick-me-up and a bit of good-hearted fun. Please don't lose the light, fun atmosphere I first found in mumble for the sake of what's meant to be a casual competition."

OLTP,2i443e,Streetlamp_,9,Fri Oct 3 03:46:09 2014 UTC,"It might seem like a negative, but I honestly just see it as more people giving a shit. No one was overly invested last season.  From season 2 onwards it's a balancing act between wanting to grow the user base while maintaining the close knit community. Have you ever been to US mumble or listened to an MLTP round match? Half their matches are complete non-events and some of them could never happen and the community wouldn't even know.  As long as our community grows at the same rate I think we're going to maintain some level of familiarity with everyone. More personal relationships are great but it also tends to breed more conflict and drama. If we grew at the rate of the US community the competition would become far more impersonal, but that would probably equal less drama."

OLTP,2gdjx8,csb_tp,2,Sun Sep 14 15:59:50 2014 UTC,"I'm happy to alter it since its not a perfect representation of how a team is actually travelling. For example, even though TFB lost, they actually move up this week because their top 4 players changed to those with better GASP.   I'll be on tonight if you want to chat about it and we can workshop some alternatives. Happy to come up with a better formula since it's uber basic right now.  EDIT: By the way, I don't think minute weighted Team GASP works since GASP doesn't change too much based on minutes. A player with 80 mins vs a player with 60 mins will be immediately disadvantaged simply because they've played more. Also I'm pretty sure a team like TFB or FRB will be way out in front purely because they have more players who've played a decent amount of time."
OLTP,2gdjx8,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Mon Sep 15 03:29:56 2014 UTC,How is it done at the moment? Does it just pull from Team-Sorted statistics? Could potentially just pull it from the Unsorted GASP Week 1-7 stats and average them.
OLTP,2gdjx8,herpaderp1995,1 point,Mon Sep 15 08:19:40 2014 UTC,It's averaged using top 4 players by minutes played. It's all in the sheet 'Team Sorted Statistics w/ Team GASP'. I started it as just a casual stat keeping thing that was a bit interesting so it's not very complex.
OLTP,2gdjx8,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Mon Sep 15 09:49:00 2014 UTC,I mean something like  (Rain gasp * rain minutes + radian gasp * radian minutes + ... + smack gasp * smack minutes) / total cap22 minutes  But since the individual gasp penalizes you for playing fewer minutes hence use the gasp that isn't adjusted for that
OLTP,2gdjx8,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Mon Sep 15 10:20:44 2014 UTC,That process gives the exact same result as just adding up GASP and dividing by amount of players.  i.e. a = 2 b = 3  (a + b) / 2 = 2.5  or   (a20 + b20) / 40 = 2.5
OLTP,2gdjx8,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Mon Sep 15 10:58:03 2014 UTC,Yes that is the case if team fields 4 players only but most teams have fielded more than 4.
OLTP,2gdjx8,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Mon Sep 15 20:40:41 2014 UTC,"It's still the same though. Whether it's 4 or 6 players, it's just adding up GASP and dividing by how many players you've added from. It doesn't factor in minutes at all and I'm pretty sure it just favours the teams who have played more players because as I said earlier, the GASP isn't affected too much by time played.   A team like FRB will naturally have a high team GASP simply because they have 6 players who've played a decent amount of time. So I'm not sure how your formula is getting a more accurate team GASP?  The current one is pretty basic and I'm definitely keen to see if it can be improved."
OLTP,2gdjx8,Jonathanan,1 point,Tue Sep 16 07:30:33 2014 UTC,"They are not the same, because they are weighted by minutes. See here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxLz4T5hr3pdFvlC1IAIrxdyTyYtAQyGK8s6qyb1GKk/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true  It's a more accurate Team GASP because every minute played by everyone on the team gets counted, and proportionally by minutes played. Also I didn't use the unpenalized GASP for people under the minutes limit here but it should be that one"
OLTP,2gdjx8,WeenAFK,1 point,Tue Sep 16 08:43:06 2014 UTC,"Sorry, you're right. In all the mock ones I did the minutes per player were the same so it always gave the same result as just a regular average.  Are you able to run the same formulas for all teams to see if it how it goes? I'm still unsure if it's actually going to be more accurate since there will be some players who have disproportionally higher GASP for the minutes played and their teams average might get inflated."
OLTP,2gdjx8,Jonathanan,2,Tue Sep 16 09:26:05 2014 UTC,This might work more effectively but what stops a single player only playing one half of an OLTP game for the entire season and getting an insane score? I am bad with statistics so I am not sure how you would go about averaging those numbers.

The recap video was perfect but maybe have a few seconds before the clips say which teams are playing against each other.  For the top plays one, we probably dont have enough games to warrant there being a top defense and top offense video for each week. Also the first clip could be a bonus fail clip and then go on to the top plays or something. Just an idea because again, we might not necessarily have enough fails to fill in an entire fails video.  These are just suggestions because I could see it being a lot of work having to do 5 videos a week, but if you want to keep doing it the way you are, I think everyone would be stoked with that haha.

I dont see how luck can ruin games, it's unbias and more importantly can happen to either team. If Sizzzled had capped there everyone would be saying how lucky he was to get that cap but he would deserve it since he took the chance to stay on the cap and put himself in a position for that lucky to happen.   No what ruins Tagpro at a high level is when the players leave the game early or threaten to forfeit. Those situations are not fun for either team...."

To use it, disable any other script that modifies textures (modmanager, geckotools, and maybe some other script), and then you have to do the following:  First, chose the index of red and blue team in lines 12-13. Chose the index from 0 to 7 in the order of the image (0 for KMH, 1 for WTC, etc. Here 5 corresponds to the flag bear(er)s . 8 is for the unassigned balls at the bottom):   blueTeamJerseyIndex = 5                   redTeamJerseyIndex = 5   Then, chose the jersey option in lines 15-16. Leave 0 for the first set (the red and blue ball on the left hand side), and use 1, 2 or 3 for the other sets:  blueTeamJerseyOption = 0 redTeamJerseyOption = 0   Finally, chose transparency on line 48 where you can chose a value between 1 (fully opaque) to 0 (completely transparent). Only the jersey is affected, not the border:  context.globalAlpha = 1; // Here is transparency   The flag bear(er)s example from above was done with this setting (completely opaque) but you (and future streamers) can play with the setting to get what they want exactly.

OLTP,2desg5,maxroar619,2,Wed Aug 13 10:39:10 2014 UTC,"this is just noobs because i couldnt be bothered formatting them all for reddit at the current time  So I have been given the task to talk to the two teams who unfortunately fell short of the grand final by only a single match. Both of these teams played well and I'd like to congradulate them on getting as far as they did. Firstly I'd like to interview noob,captain of I Swear We're Not Bots.  Max: Hey noob mind an interview for the OLTP Chronicle?  Noob: Sure man  Max: so noob your team unfortunately went down on hyper reactor to Balls to the Walls, what do you think went wrong and how did it feel when you were eliminated from the finals?  Noob: I went into the game thinking we didn't have much of a chance so I thought I wouldn't really be bothered by a loss. However by the end of the first half I was ecstatic thinking we had actually been the better side and stood a very realistic chance of winning. Unfortunately however this only set us up for a greater fall by the end of the match and it truly sucked to concede cap after cap.Ultimately what went wrong though was just poor formation in the second half. We fielded a player who hadn't trained to much with us over the past week given the guy we were going to play - Meh had lag. This really screwed us up as so many of our planned offensive plays relied on teamwork. Our defence also obviously suffered which I think may have stemmed from everyone just being out of position - though I'm not sure why this only became a problem in the second half.  Max: Noob you had 2 players in your team close to the some ball award and testicles ""achieving"" it why do you think this is did you make bad drafting choices not practice enough or something else entirely?  Noob:I don't see it as bad draft choices. Our first and third picks left the team - no other teams suffered such losses - so of course we had to field players lower down in our line up repetitively to a greater extent than other teams.  Max: Noob do you plan on captaining next year and if so what do you think you will do differently?  Noob:Nah I don't plan to captain again, I'd prioritise people that I talk to more over raw talent. Being able to practice a lot and having played a lot with your team mates - even in pubs - leads to a greater team dynamic which I greatly underestimated in my draft choices.  Max: Well that's about it anything else you want to say?  Noob:  Nope that's about it - thanks max!"

OLTP,2cvns7,pelirrojo,2,Fri Aug 8 01:32:56 2014 UTC,From the Genius mtbkr:   The Ruble is part of Russian currency.  1/100th of a Ruble is a Kopeck.  Kopeck is one of only three words in the English language that rhyme with Klosec.  Klosec12 = 12 Kopecks  12 Kopecks = 0.12 Rubles.  No one will ever figure it out.
OLTP,2cvns7,VehementVexation,2,Fri Aug 8 01:48:24 2014 UTC,So collectively you have named your OLTP S2 Team after yourself? What does that say about this captains perspective of himself? cough cough

Can you tell me why exactly, maxroar619, you were not selected to play in a team in OLTP Season I? I'm very interested to know, but please don't feel obliged to answer if time is running fine. Of course, in today's society, time is money, and I wouldn't want to take any much needed finance from your hands. Anyway, I best be off.

But honest constructive criticism: unless it's an accurate representation of the Draft Packet then it's not that useful.

There are some great players out there who may have the wrong attitude about how they play or represent the league or even how they interact with other people. As a captain, i dont want these people on my team, as not only do they make themselves look bad with a poor attitude, but they make the team look bad, the captain and look bad and most importantly, the league look bad if we have players who are good technically, but are dicks in the chatbox or on mumble.

Even if you're only on once a week, and even if you don't have a mic, being on Mumble is a vital part of improving how you play and improving how the team plays.  If, for whatever reason, Mumble doesn't work for you, hit me up with a PM on Reddit and I can try and help you to fix it or find an alternate solution."

OLTP,2akf0l,YouthfulCharlatan,13,Sun Jul 13 05:51:20 2014 UTC,"OLTP stands for Oceanic League TagPro, which is the highest level of competitive play in the southern hemisphere. Basically, for season 2, eight teams will be formed by eight captains and their picks in the draft, which will take place some time in early August. Everybody is welcome to sign up for the draft. We may be looking at creating a reserves competition for those who don't make the first team, who can use that competition to prove themselves worthy of game time in OLTP.  The highest level of competitive TagPro differs from public games in that it is much more organised on many levels. Game times are organised, positioning is more organised, strategy is more organised. Players use their microphones to communicate with each other about tactical decisions while the game is going, things like FC positioning, power-up spawn times, and just general commands like 'grab the gate' or 'hold the lines'.  If you are interested in this type of play you should definitely sign up. However being drafted is not a certainty. It would help your chances by hopping on our mumble server and speaking to the community, as well as playing private games against the best of the best, to show off or improve your skill set."

Three of the most difficult boosts in Tagpro are on this map alone, with a crazy number of boosts in the centre of the map allowing for a massive range of potential boost directions. Combined with the large number of spikes it is a map where teams will have to actively decide to play conservatively or go ham, as crazy potential plays also allows for hilarious potential failures."

OLTP,29qnm6,drinkbleachtag,5,Thu Jul 3 14:00:54 2014 UTC,"Hey all, i am Klosec and i am here to explain why i should be re-elected as one of your OLTP Commissioners.  I was an OLTP Commissioner this past season which was a daunting task, as the original 4 had to get this massive thing off the ground and running, which is no easy feat. In our roles, we had to create basic league precedent for issues that may arise in the future, much like the rules regarding dropping of players on rosters, the rule in which i had the largest contribution in developing a set of guidelines to follow when dropping a player from a roster. I know how much effort is needed to keep this league running, and i have been able to manage this while also putting a large amount of work into the OLTP Chronicle, which i created from the ground up, as well as lead my 0.12 Rubles side this season, so not only do i feel i have the experience and dedication to keep being heavily involved in this league, but also i feel i am one of the more trusted members of the Oceanic Community (Although this is purely IMO).  I feel that the Commissioners as a whole, myself included, have not been overly receptive to the Community in having their ideas heard, and if re-elected, i will endeavour to ensure the community that i am a commissioner that is open to having ideas heard and responded to, and will always be open for a chat regarding the future of the league, or just the league in general.  At the end of the day, when you go to vote, you should be picking who you think would run the league the best and most efficiently. If you feel that the work i did this past season has been good enough to warrant a renewal of my services, than that is fantastic and i thank you for deciding to vote for me. However, if you feel that change is needed and decide not to vote for me to get in, then i applaud you for putting the community first and wanting to see change implemented if you feel that is the best option.  I will not be voting for myself come election day, as i feel that paints an inaccurate picture of how i am received in the community, even if it is only one vote, but i will be voting for my fellow three commissioners as they have all been exemplary in their application to the running of OLTP, from Radian with his streaming, to Hoog with the keeping of Stats and GASP, and Sizzzled for keeping the overall ship afloat where many others would have failed during a turbulent first season that has been a great success.  I apologize for the insanely long post, but i feel it all needed to be said in order to have an informed opinion before you vote.  TL;DR - Vote Klosec, or don't, i'm not your mother. Just vote who you feel is right for the job."
OLTP,29qnm6,klosec12,2,Fri Jul 4 01:20:47 2014 UTC,"Hey guys/girls  Most of you already know me as well as my faults/merits as a commissioner so I'll keep this short.  I'm extremely dedicated to my role as a commissioner and would like nothing more than to be able to continue to evolve OLTP into the most highly regarded league on TagPro.  Some of my advantages as a commissioner are:   I've been around since before diameter and oceanic mumble were created and I keep in regular communication with many of the other players/mods/developers from the US and Europe.  I've spent hours improving my streams to the highest quality possible and want to continue this trend. This is evidence of how much time and effort I'm willing to spend to make OLTP just as great. I consider myself a very neutral party and like to discuss issues/ideas until I'm 100% sure our solutions are ready to be implemented. I have an extremely high standard for everything I'm a part of, so you can be sure that everything is carried out to perfection (or very close to it).   I don't really feel like saying much more than this is justified as most of you already know me well and it feels vain to try and ramble off a bunch of things I think I'm good at.   I hope everyone votes fairly and those that are elected as commissioners are able to represent the community as well as they can.  Thanks  RadiaN"

OLTP,29qnm6,hoogstra,3,Fri Jul 4 14:42:56 2014 UTC,"Fellow balls,  To start off, I would like to say thank you to all the participants of the first season of OLTP. The general consensus is that it was very successful and for the most part, problem free. The season went better than expected, which I put down to the dedication of every single player.  It requires another level of dedication and responsibility to be a commissioner. The current commissioners have done extremely well in their new roles. Sizzzled organised the draft and the OLTP spreadsheet, as well as providing commentary for Radian's stream. Radian has put a lot of effort into his stream, and the results have been magnificent. Klosec's OLTP Chronicle is the best thing in /r/oltp, and it is something I look forward to every week. They all deserve to be re-elected.  I was the pioneer for OLTP. It was my proposal that got the balls rolling. You could say that it was my idea (you probably won't). I was the caretaker of all the individual player stats, created the OLTP logo, and I wrote the original rules (which I admit were flawed). The time and effort I have put into the project is borderline sad, but I'd be holding back tears if my project is taken away from me. If that is the case, I will step down gracefully, as I know that it is everyone's project now, and we must work together to make OLTP the best it can be.  I represent the people's opinion when it comes to commissioner discussion. Vote for me, and I will represent your opinion to the decision makers. I am for a better, fairer Oceanic League TagPro.

OLTP,29qnm6,hoogstra,4,Fri Jul 4 06:55:54 2014 UTC,Hey guys!  I think you should vote based on two things and whether or not that’s a vote for me it should result in what’s best for the community – the first is that you should be voting for someone who has enough time. I’ve heard and expect any discussions on rule changes to be heavily debated amongst the commissioners and so we need people that have the time to do this so that every decision doesn’t drag on for weeks at a time. The second is having someone that can think issues through from every angle – so they are good at ensuring every issue is dealt with when developing the rules and are also good at explaining the reasoning behind the rules to everyone to ensure the community’s thoughts are heard.  So those are the things that I think are the most important. I think I have these attributes too but I may just be being conceited so please do vote for the people you think will be best as opposed to who are the most popular. I’d also urge you strongly to vote for the people that are currently commissioners as they have done well and keeping them on board will only keep things moving fast.  Cheers guys!  HK

I'm happy with the current commissioners but I think we should look at giving captains some form of power so that certain captains who end up being commissioners aren't more powerful than others.  In terms of being a commissioner, I think I can bring an experienced and balanced perspective to the table. Throughout the current season I remained unbiased in matters that could've benefited my team and I will always have the interests of the competition in mind. I've had the added advantage of looking at the first season of OLTP from the outside and seeing what did and didn't work.

OLTP,29at4w,drinkbleachtag,2,Sun Jun 29 12:13:23 2014 UTC,"Personally, I'm just against the commission being made up entirely of captains - it can very easily create bias for people voting and making rules. It's the primary reason I wasn't a captain this season.  The only reason I'm looking into being a captain next season is because we mightn't have enough."
OLTP,29at4w,Streetlamp_,2,Sun Jun 29 14:33:16 2014 UTC,Yea I'm not saying all commissioners should be captains. Just that the captains should have a fair amount of power relative to each other.

OLTP,28ta7w,Streetlamp_,10,Sun Jun 22 19:31:59 2014 UTC,"When do I start?   I really like the idea. Obviously the move from 4 to 5 is necessary, seems silly to have an even number. And the more the community is involved the better, we have a pretty tight knit community so this won't cause problems. Atleast with elections people shouldn't be able to complain about the commissioners (ignoring the fact that we elected Abbott)  Not sure about the no captains rule, we want people who are dedicated and experienced with TagPro to be commissioners. Also wouldn't want multiple commissioners on the same team, maybe captians is a way to avoid that?"
OLTP,28ta7w,elfitzo,6,Mon Jun 23 03:12:06 2014 UTC,"As a current Commissioner, i agree with this. By ensuring we rotate the power around players, it means we dont have four players holding the league hostage by being above everyone else and being the final say on what is implemented.  We need to add a 5th to the Commissioners as well, as it stands with 4, we struggle to get a majority a lot of the time and having a 5th will make it a lot easier as well as allow for the introduction of different ideas into the fore."

It then puts you in a powerful position in that your next game with the bots is likely to decide who makes the playoffs out of ISWNB and TFB. If they beat you they make it and if they lose TFB gets thru on cap differential.

OLTP,25l74p,JangoTheMuss,2,Thu May 15 01:14:23 2014 UTC,"There's 140 minutes of total playtime for OLTP, yeah? This means that if the 10 GASP player plays 140 minutes, a player that misses one week (120 minutes total) only needs to get an ~8.5 GASP to beat him for MVP. The MVP race would literally be decided by how many minutes you played instead of your GASP  Side note: What formula is OLTP using for their GASP stats? It looks like they're doing something different for GASP T."
OLTP,25l74p,Extractum11,1 point,Thu May 15 02:06:55 2014 UTC,"Not all weeks are equal, GASP varies depending on everyone else's performance and the maps played each week"
OLTP,25l74p,Extractum11,1 point,Thu May 15 03:45:08 2014 UTC,"It is the same as ELTP. I haven't really touched the formula. Each team has one bye in the season, so that might mess with the GASP stats a bit."
OLTP,25l74p,hoogstra,1 point,Thu May 15 04:08:55 2014 UTC,"The GASP total is worked out by taking all of your stats in the season and applying the formula to them, so GASP doesn't accumulate, it is sort of an average of how you performed throughout the year. I believe playing less than the maximum playtime does affect your GASP score but not by too much, as you can tell from virnetics still being ranked 2nd despite playing 1 game."
OLTP,25l74p,hoogstra,1 point,Thu May 15 02:36:16 2014 UTC,There isn't much I can do about that. I'm not really a fan of the bye and would have preferred even teams but it was not to be. The bye kinda ruins it all.
OLTP,25l74p,hoogstra,1 point,Thu May 15 02:42:04 2014 UTC,So wouldn't it be more accurate if it did accumulate and then divided by total minutes played?
OLTP,25l74p,hoogstra,1 point,Thu May 15 03:34:31 2014 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not. I don't know really. I'm just doing it the same way everywhere else does it. virnetics played one great game and he is ranked 2nd among players For all I know they could give the same result. I really have little idea how GASP works."
OLTP,25l74p,drinkbleachtag,1 point,Thu May 15 05:28:02 2014 UTC,I've never seen the formula but I'm just curious how does it work that my total GASP for both games is less than what I got in each game? i.e. ~9 GASP each game but total GASP is ~7.
OLTP,25jmeb,drinkbleachtag,2,Wed May 14 15:41:24 2014 UTC,I like it. Are we trading a player to a team for their draft pick?
OLTP,25jmeb,hoogstra,2,Wed May 14 22:49:12 2014 UTC,"Yea it's a pretty common rule in sports with drafting.  You could decide to trade a top player for a 1st round pick, or maybe a mid/lower player for a 2nd, 3rd round pick. It all depends how the captains value that player in relation to their team.   It works better IMO for teams who need a certain type of player but the other team doesn't like anyone in the team they're trading to. They get a draft pick instead and can scout for player who best meets their needs. And as I said before, it requires less people to agree to it all and just makes the league more dynamic.  Question: Can we draft right whenever we want? Like, right now?"
OLTP,25jmeb,hoogstra,1 point,Wed May 14 23:46:38 2014 UTC,Not until draft day.
OLTP,25jmeb,hoogstra,1 point,Thu May 15 00:02:15 2014 UTC,Any reasoning behind this? Why not have a trading period with the draft day being in the middle to end of that period.
OLTP,25jmeb,hoogstra,1 point,Thu May 15 00:28:54 2014 UTC,Because drafts always take place on the same day. I am pretty sure you can trade starting from Monday next week though.
OLTP,25jmeb,hoogstra,1 point,Thu May 15 00:32:29 2014 UTC,"Bit confused. So can we trade from Monday, or can we trade from draft day?"

OLTP,25cnx5,HeikkiKovalainen,7,Mon May 12 11:32:15 2014 UTC,"Obviously bias but I think it's a bad decision that the team with fewest players gets first pick. It just makes no sense. If there was a team consisting of ayy, brioche, rain, radian and hoog it'd be ridiculous that they get first choice over a team of 7/8 mediocre players. The team that is lowest on the scoreboard needs first pick over a higher up team with less players. If you are concerned that these teams will have less players after all is said and done well just make it a rule that teams stop picking once they have 10 players."
OLTP,25cnx5,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Thu May 15 06:26:08 2014 UTC,"A team won't have those players, so you've created an unrealistic hypothetical. Most teams generally have 3-4 supreme players and a lot of rookies. It's more likely to stay fair, especially since the skill quality is bound to drop with the mid-season draft, purely because there are more unknowns joining at that stage.  Further, there isn't going to be one team missing one player. I'll use your surreal example, and say that there is one team of top-tier players with players missing, and two other not-as-good teams with an equal amount of players missing. The top-tier team are probably going to be on the top of the ladder, and due to the way we're running this draft, this means they have the last pick for that round. The two teams who are lower on the ladder will have priority over pick, which will help to alleviate their disadvantage.  The reason teams with fewer people get earlier picks is because of one simple thing, and here's an example of it: BB2 have lost BlueRanga and ETaroonie, two mid/top-tier players. Why should we have to be two decent players down, just to replace them with people who we don't know about?  This mid-season draft was put in place to make sure that teams with missing players would be able to get back up fairly. If players with missing teams only get to choose bottom-tier players, what's the point of this draft?"
OLTP,25cnx5,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Thu May 15 06:43:34 2014 UTC,"A team won't have those players, so you've created an unrealistic hypothetical.   It's a hypothetical taken to the extreme so you can understand why it's a bad idea. If you agree that a great team with five players as the one I've outlined shouldn't get 2nd priority to a crap team with the full allotment then it's clear that the strength of the team should outweigh team size in draft order.  I accept there are going to be issues with this way of doing it if say, BB2 (currently topping the ladder) lose three of their best players after the next round - but I don't see this problem actually presenting itself.  If you are concerned about this problem then what you should do is just do how we decided the initial draft order. Have each captain rate all the teams, average the positions, and boom you have a universally agreed upon fair draft order.  Let's say two of my players were thinking about leaving. what you are unintentionally persuading me to do is to tell them 'Yeah man well don't stress if you leave we don't mind.' instead of 'Hey man don't worry about not missing trainings, it's cool, I realise we all have hectic schedules and that's why we have 7 players. We'll play together at one point and after that I'll chuck you in for some game time.'"

If you are concerned about this problem then what you should do is just do how we decided the initial draft order. Have each captain rate all the teams, average the positions, and boom you have a universally agreed upon fair draft order.   It's more effort than it needs to be - when we did this in pre-season draft, it ended up resulting in the draft happening 15 minutes after schedule. Besides, it will probably result in ladder order anyway."
OLTP,25cnx5,HeikkiKovalainen,1 point,Thu May 15 07:19:38 2014 UTC,We have a week to get it together. It only delayed the start because I became a captain at the last minute and we had to redo it.  If you think it'd result in ladder order then you have to admit that ladder order is the way that is then the most fair. If you think people would choose that order to be the most fair then that's the order we should do it in.
OLTP,25cnx5,JangoTheMuss,1 point,Thu May 15 13:34:15 2014 UTC,"Of course ladder order is fair, I was never doubting that. I'm just saying that teams who have had top-tier players leave should not have to replace those people with unknowns. That's all I'm saying."

OLTP,25cnx5,Zagorath,1 point,Thu May 15 23:58:33 2014 UTC,"In what way am I neglecting it? I said from the start that ladder order is more important than player count. I also said in mumble yesterday that teams should just stop picking once they hit X many players, so of course all the teams would end up with the same amount. But the shittest teams get the first picks to make everyone even. If you think taking in all factors captains would rate teams in ladder order then that's undeniably the fairest order - it is the best predictor we have of what teams most need first pick - it is the order that'll make the teams most even."

OLTP,25cnx5,Chadwiko,2,Fri May 16 01:42:11 2014 UTC,"It was a tough decision, but the reason we made it so that the players have to agree, is so that players who are traded who don't want to be are likely to end up leaving the competition or generally just working against their team."

At the moment, most teams have four people (average) who are committed and can show up any weekend for a game. If we had an extra team, that number would go down to maybe two or three committed people on a team, which means the likelihood of a team running three players increases, even though there are more numbers. You just kinda have to find the line. 8-9 is about right. Even then, nine is probably pushing it.  Next season we'll gain more committed players, hopefully enough to double the season's size."

But honestly, it was a very fun game to play and it was a very tight game (excluding of course the very quick 5 caps in the first few minutes) which i attribute to several factors 1. Our practice/warm up scrims prior to the game. 2. No mic on One 3. No practice for TFB leading up the game. 4. Hoog's leadership.    It was quite obvious that after those initial minutes that TFB found their synergy and it and suddenly turned into a a very tense match. I also have to give credit to Sayonara as his power up control was noticed and several times we wrestled over that middle power up and he won it (much to my frustration).    It was also relieving knowing that we got that buffer of several caps so early as I know it allowed me to play much more freely and not be as nervous and tense as I otherwise would've been. I'm also sure that TFB will go far in this OLTP season and I have no doubt that we will have to play them again ( probably in the playoffs or finals) and I can't say I'm excited about that prospect as they will come prepared next time. But that is in the future, however I can't help but feel for Bad Balls II who have to face TFB next week.    Thanks for such a great game TFB but lets not do it again, anytime soon. Mmkay?"

OLTP,23kal9,hoogstra,1 point,Tue Apr 22 10:06:13 2014 UTC,Your getting close to the answer.

I am reading the sidebar and rules and nowhere do i see that i have to be a player who was drafted to be on this sub. Now if you would kindly take your head out of your ass and stop rubbing in the fact that i didnt get drafted then maybe i will consider listening what you have to say.

OLTP,23c6qy,TagproBallz4Pay,1 point,Fri Apr 18 06:26:20 2014 UTC,Unfortunately you will have to wait until the fourth week of the season. There will be another draft and if you can prove yourself in that time it is likely that you will be picked.
