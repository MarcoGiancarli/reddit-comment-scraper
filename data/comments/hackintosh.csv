So get used to the idea of being in the install mode.  I'll say this.  I just got a z97 board and the unibeast method worked pretty flawlessly.  But it takes a couple of installs to get the hang of things.  So have a back up and don't be afraid to wipe and reload again because its the nature of the hobby.  Everyone does it.

hackintosh,3e0epc,Aytrx,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:54 2015 UTC,This CPU would outperform most real Macs that can do 4K editing. The real bottleneck is OP's storage. OP needs a RAID or only use SSD's.
hackintosh,3e0epc,Takeabyte,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:37:05 2015 UTC,You could consider spending less on Motherboard and GPU and spend the money on better cooling and raid0 HDDs.   Raid0 is great for that software and better cooling would allow you to get more performance out of the 4790K.
hackintosh,3e0epc,GendoSC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:35:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say only a hyper 212 evo, and the mobo could be a matx"
hackintosh,3e0epc,TheImmortalLS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:59:34 2015 UTC,I recommend getting a 500GB SSD so you have a decent amount of space for AE cache which will drastically increase performance. I run a 250GB SSD on my machine and I'm always pressed for space on the drive and forced to limit my cache to around 20GB which is just too small in my opinion.

I was trying to make this an easier build as it's my first  C. I was following TonyMacx86's latest CustoMac Pro build with  some improvements.   D. 4k Video Editing is the highest end work I'd be doing in this, I guess I would rephrase the question ""Would it be possible to edit/create 4k video/after effects on this rig""  E.

hackintosh,3e0epc,soopafly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:04 2015 UTC,What are you using for video editing? I'm building my first hackintosh (waiting for parts to be delivered) and just found out that my video card might not be compatible with FCP. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202239
hackintosh,3e0epc,Takeabyte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"Adobe, my video cared would be used for nvidia's CUDA system"
hackintosh,3e0epc,nin9tyfour,0,Tue Jul 21 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"Where do you expect to store your 4k footage while you work on a project? Because if it's not on the SSD or on a fast hardware RAID it is going to be slow to work on your project (especially with only 16GB of RAM). Also, again because of 4K... you're going to need a lot more storage, like at least 6TB.  Not to mention a backup... if this is for work, you don't want to get sued for fucking up a client's project when a drive dies because you didn't spring for enough storage to match what you're using.  GPU and CPU are fine, and I mean you could get away with only 16GB of RAM... but 4K is just on a whole nother level when it comes to video work.  Edit: Your display is good enough, but you're a few pixels short of cinema 4K. This matters depending on your camera."
hackintosh,3e0epc,RawRoots,2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:45 2015 UTC,"4k would be the highest end work I'd be doing. Most of it would probably be 1080, but I'd like the option to edit/create in 4k. I ended up switching to 2 3tb storage drives, as you made a good point with storage."
hackintosh,3e0epc,nin9tyfour,0,Tue Jul 21 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure about 4K. But I'll advise you on your choice in keyboard. Avoid Razer, Synapse is an absolute joke on OS X. I had to force quit it, open, log out and log in every few days to get my key bindings to work. The USB pass through is kind of dodgy too, it caused my iPhone to reconnect about 5 times a second. Not sure what was going on, even bought another motherboard but it was the keyboard in the end. I contacted Razer and their support is just useless. Currently using a Das Keyboard DK4. If you want something with lights go for CoolerMaster or Ducky, they're great.  GPU doesn't really matter for video editing, it's heavily reliant on the CPU. Consider perhaps opting for the GTX 970 and the 5930K, although I don't know if the latter is compatible with Hackintosh."
hackintosh,3e0epc,Takeabyte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:45:15 2015 UTC,"""GPU doesn't really matter for video editing, it's heavily reliant on the CPU"" Not 100% true. Adobe After Effects and Premiere make use of the CUDA cores provided with het GTX 980. Works like a charm and definitely improves rendering speed. But indeed, the CPU is still more impotant."
hackintosh,3e0epc,Takeabyte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:36 2015 UTC,"I always forget about this. Probably because the last time I did any serious video editing was in 2008-2009, when CUDA was not as readily used as it is today. I didn't have a great graphics card back then either, so that might be half of the problem but I'm fairly sure only in the last two to three years Adobe  (and maybe Autodesk?) have focused on implementing CUDA."
hackintosh,3e0epc,GermanyChris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:55:32 2015 UTC,Adobe primarily use OpenCL (not CUDA). There is a very small function that uses CUDA but Adobe has said that they are going to move away from it and stick with OpenCL since it works on all GPUs and not just Nvidia's.

hackintosh,3e025s,Murph4991,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:52 2015 UTC,"Couple of bucks for that mobo, but if it makes you happy, why not? Basic specs--Z97; Intel i218v ethernet; ALC1150 audio--are all standard Hackintosh-compatible stuff. The BIOS(es) might be the same between the different board models; you'd have to check that on the ASUS site, but I'd bet the fundamentals are the same.  It sounds like a pretty safe bet, but you'll have to decide for yourself. Clearly you're not after a ""budget build"", so you'll have some money tied up in that board. If you go ahead with it and get it all working well, be a nice guy and post all about it. It's nice to read about something other than Gigabyte now and then."

hackintosh,3e025s,badchromosome,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"The motherboard specs sound fine for doing a Hackintosh. For peace-of-mind, you might try downloading the mobo manuals from ASUS to cross compare the available BIOS settings that are crucial setting up a Hackintosh. My hunch is that they will be the same. You might also check on the BIOS version numbers for the different revisions of the Sabertooth boards and Gryphon, and if they are the same then you definitely should be good-to-go. ASUS regularly uses the same BIOS revisions with multiple board models with a common chipset. With the advent of the 9 series Intel chipsets and common UEFI BIOSes, motherboard compatibility has been greatly improved across brands for doing a Hackintosh."

In addition to suggested components for various price points, there are a couple of subforums, ""Golden Builds"" and ""User Builds"" that might help. While most current motherboards work just fine, sticking with Gigabyte will make it easier for you to find comments/tutorials specific to your own hardware. Makes your learning curve less steep.  If you have a Microcenter near you, they usually have great prices on mobo/CPU combos if bought in-store (where I shop normally). Sign up at newegg and you can get special discount promo codes sent via email daily for all sorts of stuff. Maybe amazon, too, although their site is a grind to search due to poor search filters. Search first at newegg, then compare prices on the part at amazon.  One thing I do like about amazon is a good return policy. Microcenter is also excellent in that regard. Newegg, maybe not so good these days."

With a functioning OS X VM I was able to fool around with making a Clover/OS X bootable installer flash drive after downloading my own copy of OS X from the App Store on my own account. There is a long thread on insanelymac about getting OS X running as a VM in the ""Multi-booting and Virtualization"" subforum.

The original Mac Pro's with multiple Xeon chips are workhorses, and get great results. They are old enough to be a reliability hazard (my MacPro4,1 with dual quad-core Xeons started failing after I had it for about 4 months). Also, no PCIe 2.0 on Windows with graphics cards (fine under OS X), firmware needs to be tricked into flashing etc. etc. A MacPro4,1 can be flashed to be a MacPro5,1 and go from there. This should be more reliable, but get the best one you can find (dual-quadcore is best). Brilliant hardware design, I paid US$700 for mine, and it was low on RAM, I upgraded with 12GB kit (pretty cheap considering).

I don't know if it could quite keep up with the dual X5365's in multi threaded performance, and the Xeons will also have much more cache (2x8M) than the i3 (4M).

hackintosh,3dux4z,WB5QWN,2,Mon Jul 20 02:38:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I happen to be running almost the exact same kind of Mac Pro setup you're suggesting, so I have some insight I can shed on the decision.  TLDR: If you're starting more or less from scratch, you'll probably be happier long-term with the custom-built hackintosh with modern hardware.  Anyways, so about 6 months ago I decided to switch my previously built hackintosh server (i3-3225/GA-Z68XP-UD3/GT 610) over to something with a bit more power. I happened to have my work decommissioning a Mac Pro 1,1 model so I got that for free. I spent about $100 upgrading the processors to X5355's, spend $50 to up the RAM to 24GB and tossed the same GT 610, a SSD and 2X4TB drives in it as well. There's a secondary external array attached, but that's beside the point.  Overall, I've been very happy with it. So some pros:   Runs Mavericks/Yosemite (With a pretty simple and straight-forward hack, far less complicated than a full hackintosh setup) High-Powered. Like you said, it gets about 11,000 Geekbench with it's 8 cores, which is still very respectable for tearing through video encoding or other processor-intensive tasks. Workstation-quality hardware. The Mac Pros of yesteryear were always built with Xeon processors over Core2/i3/i5/i7 models. Those processors last FOREVER, the cooling system is excellent, and it uses ECC RAM by default.   There are definitely some cons though as well:   Aging hardware. After doing the upgrades I did, the 1,2 model is at the end of it's life. There's just no room for upgrades anymore. It's the best I can possibly make it. HOT HOT HOT. With two processors working hard, the heat output can be substantial. My servers live in a storage area off my apartment so it make no difference to me, but don't let it be located anywhere you want to keep at a comfortable temperature. High Power Usage. Again, this makes no difference to me as utilities are included in my rent. But idle on a 1,1 is like 75W and up to 300W or so at load. It'll cost you in juice.   So what will work better for you is (as usual) totally dependent on your needs. If just getting something up and working that's likely to keep working for a long time without regard for upgradability or power consumption, the Mac Pro 1,1 even without the CPU upgrades could do very well for you.  But if upgradability, lower power consumption and max computing power are your goals, a hackintosh will definitely be better and cheaper. You will have to keep up with the software side of hackintoshing unless you stick with the last major update versions like 10.9.5. Good luck!"

Most of the features that make using an IDE nice only become relevant as the scope of your projects increases."
hackintosh,3dtywi,LuxuryScience,3,Sun Jul 19 13:10:54 2015 UTC,"NullCPUPowerManagement.kext is supposed to prevent Intel Speedstep, so usually that leads to the CPU being either at full speed or at the lowest speed in some cases. Try installing Intel Power Gadget to see what your CPU frequency is at. Intel Power Gadget reads the speed directly from the CPU register so it should be accurate.  I'm not too familiar with ASUS motherboards for hackintoshing, but I don't think you need NULLCPUPowerManagement.kext. If your system is kernel panicking without it, you may need to patch your bios. See here for more info."

I loaded the NULLCPUPowerManagement.kext because that's what the guide I blindly followed suggested - but upon running the Intel Power Gadget - I'm seeing my Frequency jump all over the place (As I suppose it's designed to do) - which leads me to believe that either I loaded that kext wrong to begin with (though it shows in my boot log) - that it either disables itself - or that it just isn't working.  Regardless, it appears that my CPU frequency is scaling as intended. Thanks for that.   I gotta say, this is a pretty rad community. What I enjoy the most about using my computer is recklessly jumping into ridiculous projects with the full expectation of destroying everything - for example after getting this os x installed and generally working, I booted to my linux partition, realized my drive assignments have changed - went into my little rescue shell to rewrite my fstab and my lilo.conf (yes, I still use lilo, don't judge me!) and ran lilo. I forgot to change which drive lilo actually wrote to and managed to write it to my EFI partition. Whoops. Five minutes of googling and I was totally fixed. Great community."
hackintosh,3dtywi,phantomsniper77,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure how NullCPUPM.kext is supposed to work but thinking about it, if it is only meant to disable AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.kext, then it makes sense that it doesn't seem to do anything, as I think (not 100% sure) for Ivy Bridge and newer CPUs, the functionality of AICPUPM.kext is baked right into the kernel.  Personally, if you don't need it in order for your machine to work, I would remove it in order to keep it as close to Apple's configuration as possible. Just my 2¢.  And I agree, this community is great. Probably one of the only reasons I still keep my Reddit account these days :)"

I haven't used a mac since the LC575 I used in middle school, so everything is totally foreign to me. (Meaning, I don't own a mac)  I downloaded a niresh mavericks image (zomg piracy) and installed it in virtualbox. (Which, frankly, was more trouble than getting the actual 'hackintosh' working) From there I downloaded a yosemite image and used clover to install onto a USB drive to start the process. (and used the vm again when I had to try a different kext for my NIC) Everything works perfectly now.  Niresh sucks, seriously - but it worked for what I was doing. If there's an easier way to install osx in virtualbox, then I recommend doing that instead.  I think it's so ridiculous when subreddits delete anything that even MENTIONS use of pirated software.

hackintosh,3dstp6,TheRacerMaster,2,Sun Jul 19 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"It's a distro. Distros usually install a crap ton of stuff you most likely don't need and contain patches/fixes that usually break after each OS X update. This is mainly because they are generic - they aren't specifically made for any particular setup. You also don't learn anything about the installation/post-installation process by simply running the distro's installer, which is important (especially with distro installations, since they can break easily - you'll need to know how to fix these issues).  Most modern rigs can run with vanilla OS X + Clover + a few kexts (FakeSMC+HWSensors, NIC driver(s), AppleHDA codec injector). I would recommend going this route instead (you can use the Niresh ISO to install a virtual machine of OS X where you can download the retail version of OS X from the App Store).

hackintosh,3dne5x,Kw3li,4,Fri Jul 17 19:46:56 2015 UTC,FYI - the IOGEAR did not work well for me. Lots of mouse stuttering and lagging.  This is the one that I use.

hackintosh,3dne5x,ciopobbi,3,Fri Jul 17 19:59:38 2015 UTC,No stuttering at all? Yosemite won't recognize the one in my motherboard (that worked fine on all previous OS X versions) or IOGEAR at all. Period. Kexts or anything else for this one? I'm going to have to jump on this if it's that easy and smooth.
hackintosh,3dne5x,Art0fLife,2,Sat Jul 18 02:49:55 2015 UTC,No kexts. Plug and play. Instantly recognized. YMMV.  Never any stuttering. Apple BT keyboard and mouse work almost flawlessly. I find that these things do not have anywhere near the range they state. I have mine attached to a short USB cord connected to a port on the back of my monitor. It hangs down behind the monitor pillar to about the level of the base. That puts it about a foot away from the mouse and keyboard. Every so often the mouse lags ever so slightly. Repositioning the dongle an inch cures the problem immediately.
hackintosh,3dne5x,ciopobbi,2,Sat Jul 18 14:18:48 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear! Of course, mileage may vary and I wasn't trying to get a guarantee :) Yeah, even when my other was working the range was extremely short. Which is fine by me, I really just need it for my trackpad!

If you don't want to mess with your Windows install just in case it doesn't work just stick it on an old hard drive and disconnect the windows drive while you try it out. I would recommend using Clover instead of Unibeast/Multibeast. I have had MUCH better experience with it in general and it has better AMD support.

You should be able to download Yosemite from the Mac App Store inside a Snow Leopard VM. With some Google searching, I found out that this laptop has an Intel WiFi card. Intel WiFi cards aren't supported in OS X (Apple never used them). I'd recommend getting a BCM94352HMB. Make sure you check your manual, Lenovo has a habit of having whitelists for specific WiFi cards in the BIOS. You may need to buy a Lenovo-branded version of the card for it to work properly (again, check your manual). You need to use a bootloader such as Clover. If you use Clover and take the time to set it up properly, updating will be painless.   It'd be helpful if you post your entire specs, and do a dump of your ACPI tables.

Actually, after looking at that list, it seems that there is a modded BIOS that can remove the whitelist (be careful, you could accidentally brick your laptop if you flash it wrong). The Dell Wireless DW1510 is a good cheap alternative (although only Wireless N and not on the whitelist). Make sure you check which size you should get (the guide you linked to explains this).

Any of the 700 series should work with mountain lion and Mavericks, I don't know about Yosemite though, and while the Broadcom does work out of the box, the edimax of Mac has wireless AC support and will work with the installation of the included software cd, so it may be worth it to go with edimax for the long run.

The Core-2-Quad will show as a Xeon, but that is a non-issue.  Did you try moving your mouse and clicking on the window (avoiding the cancel button) the entire time the OS is installing? This has gotten me through on occasions before.  You really need to go back to Mavericks, and try a myHack built USB (using a different rear USB 2.0 port if possible, with no other USB devices installed, except KB/Mouse). You obviously need to enable Legacy USB in BIOS, as well as AHCI etc. S3 you name it.  I believe when you get to within the last minute of install (or seconds), it has done EVERYTHING except install the bootloader, and therefore should be bootable from the UniBeast/myHack Chimera menu. Just type in boot flag UseKernelKext=No  https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/P5G41TM_LX_PLUS/specifications/  Had a quick look, you should be golden! Cannot see the LAN chipset, but should be Realtek GBe, so drivers available!  If you can test it with myHack Mavericks 10.9.x (with troublesome kexts removed), then ComboUpdate to 10.9.4, then update to 10.9.5 (that's the way that works for me most often), you should be sweet. Once you get everything running perfectly, you can get new Yosemite drivers, put them on another USB device, and think about intalling Yosemite (from scratch). You do not have UEFI BIOS, so you can stick with Chimera 4.x, as just about everything is working now.  Do you need to boot with nv_disable=1 with the 770?  Anyway, I am avoiding Yosemite, might update to El Capitan in the future when drivers become available. Sorry I could not be more help..."

For example, if you were using Intel HD Graphics HD 4600, the driver wouldn't load (since real Mac Pros have Xeons which don't have integrated graphics). OS X El Capitan (currently in dev preview) has redesigned USB kexts that depend on the SMBIOS you are using (USB 3 won't work if you're using MacPro5,1 or older, since they didn't have USB 3).

PS. I am pretty sure that Win7 cannot be installed to GUID disk, but only HYBRID GUID/MBR. This is taken care of by Disk Utility when formatting different partitions in the prior setup.  PS. You can create a UEFI installer for Win7 (done it myself), but it is a convoluted method. This installs the Windows bootloader into EFI GUID partition (installer creates 3 partitions), and is prone to accidentally changing.

I installed Yosemite using clover with the guide found on TonyMac. Perhaps the issue could be with your install and not with the hardware?   I am running with:  gigabyte z97m-d3h i5-4790  P.S. The gtx 650 (at least the EVGA version that I have) doesn't have a HDMI port but instead has a mini-HDMI port. My SO has the gtx 660 (also built by EVGA) and that one does have an HDMI port.

I would recommend looking at this guide as it made my first installation work flawlessly with this motherboard.  CPU should be good and so should the RAM. Only thing I can't confirm personally is the graphics card, mainly because I'm team red (yes even for hackintosh) so I can't properly confirm the graphics card for you.  Storage these days don't matter much anymore yet I question why you're using two ssd's both of the same capacity yet of different brands for curiosity's sake.  And lastly a case and power supply don't fall under ""compatibility"" because the os doesn't interface to them at all, but rather they are a glue to hold the system together when you think about it. But I do approve of your choices (especially dat case mmm)  For what it's worth. I'll give you my thumbs up :)"

hackintosh,3dcdt7,tythemacman,2,Wed Jul 15 04:15:50 2015 UTC,"I do have an SM951 AHCI version too on an GA-Z97X Gaming-3. AFAIK, the problem lies in the UEFI. It does not contain a module to boot the SSD. Since Clover gets the drives from the UEFI (I believe), it doesn't show there. I'm not sure if you could add a manual boot entry in your Clovers config…  You could also mod in the missing module into the BIOS or ask Gigabyte for a beta BIOS with support for it, but since it's an OEM drive it's unlikely they have SM951 support on top of their list.  It doesn't matter for me either, because I do have a corestorage/FusionDrive with a bootable HDD and I boot into its recovery partition anyway. With an ordinary SSD, Clover shows me 4 boot options, one for each drive to boot OS X from the Recovery Partition and one each to boot Recovery from Recovery Partition. When I boot OS X from the HDD with the SM951 instead of an ordinary SSD installed, the SM951 gets recognized and I can boot normally as I would with a supported SSD.  I managed to get it shown as bootable using the RAID mode and a certain combination of CSM options, but change one little thing and it disappears… I unfortunately couldn't reproduce it…  For me it also doesn't matter if I put the SSD in to the integrated m.2 slot (2 lanes) or use and PCIe adapter with full 4 lanes.

The M.2 drives have two 'keys', an M Key, and a B Key. (Google) As far as i can tell, the B Key uses 2X Lanes, and the M Key uses 4X Lanes (full MB/s potential of the SSD), but only one of them is bootable. Which one, i don't know, and it's mainboard/bios dependent at that.   Lots of people have problems booting from it in the Windows world, the boards that work the best are currently the z/x 97-99 mainboards, with the 87 boards giving the most problems.   What you can do is install windows on it to see if it's bootable. Plow in a Windows DVD and see if the installer detects a drive. Windows 7 preferred, since Win 8 has some other UEFI boot gimmicks that Windows 7 or OSX don't have. If Win 7 works, then OSX should too.   First check if your M.2 is bootable (google), then set bios defaults, then look at the bios settings to see if something is related to the M.2 storage, then Windows 7 install. If that don't work, no go."

I can explain how to move over various directories via ln -s if you are interested, to let the system boot from a regular ssd and use the M.2 for Applications/Home/etc stuff.

It's ok to be a n00b and have doubts, what most of the time is not OK is to avoid using Google or Reddit/forums search function.  If you look at the Tonymacx86 Buyer's Guide -made for noobs- you'll see that the hardware you posted is compatible.  As for questions regarding stuff like if it will be better to get more ram or a better GPU for specific software or activities... agail: ALL OVER GOOGLE there are guides explaining how things work in a really 'pedagogical' way.  If tl;dr, that build will work just fine. Any of those MB will do the job, so if you don't need any specific feature and you are on a budget go for the cheapest. RAM is ok, go for 2x8 gb so you can add another kit in the future if you need to.  Samsung's SSD seem to be more 'reliable' at least by popular opinion. If you can, spend some more money on the PRO line or even better the Extreme Pro line by Sandisk. For the HDD get as many and as bigger as you want, you are not going to boot the OS from them. For speed and durability get the Black line from WD, Blue is fine aswell and Green's are slower but not a bad option for storage. I'm not familiar with Chieftec PSUs, so can't say if they are a good option or not, but if you can get a Seasonic between 550-650w you'll be good as it most likely won't die ever :p and new nVidia GPUs are very little power demanding (unless you want to go for SLI or top-tier GPUs)."

If you want ease use nVidia, if you're going to use the CS use nVidia, If you're going to use Apples SW use AMD.

Your hard drive (which I also back up regularly) won't be affected even if you have issues with the hackintosh bootloader (which are the only ""issues"" there really are with the hackintosh). Nothing's going to randomly delete your data any more than any other computer. Also, once you have all of your kexts working, just save a copy of your config.plist and your kexts on a usb drive and you can always easily restore. Pretty simple stuff- it's just the initial setup that can be a little hair-pulling, usually just due to inexperience. I originally set up with Chameleon, and am now on Clover, and learned it all by reading and trial and error. Now I'm perfectly confident in my setup and have zero concern with using in a professional capacity. And if I bought an actual Mac Pro with the specs of my computer it would be thousands of dollars more.

Then they sell it to consumers marketing them as ""MSI GTX 970 powered by Nvidia's latest Maxwell architecture""."

Storage is storage, though you'll need to partition your boot disk into an OSX-boot section and a Windows-boot section.  Now, CPU and GPU. IIRC you can use the G3258 with OSX, but you'll need to do some tinkering—and I think I've heard people say there's no way of using that CPU's iGPU on the OSX side of things. I would recommend a low-end i3 if you don't want to buy a discrete graphics card.  I know some people hate on them, and I suppose they have decent reasons to politically, but I've always used tonymac for my hackintoshing guides and help. Here's their Yosemite install guide."

Unless you get a video card, you need a CPU with HD 4600 or higher (including HD 5000 and Iris), like an i3-4330. Everything else in your build would be compatible, but be aware that you need to buy separate Blu-Ray playback software for OS X.  To address why you want OS X though, I'll add that there's little to no difference between the OS X and Windows versions of iTunes, Spotify, and most DJ software (like Traktor, Virtual DJ, and Mixxx). I'd try out the Windows versions of your favorite programs on your MacBook. The easiest way would be to Download the Windows 10 preview and install it in VirtualBox.

hackintosh,3d2xsm,tartantangents,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:58:53 2015 UTC,That'd work too. Just make sure you unplug the OS X SSD when you install Windows on the other.
hackintosh,3d3hrq,DealLayLolMo,2,Mon Jul 13 05:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course. Since OS X is free since Mountain Lion (I think) you can just download a clean dmg (untouched) from a torrent site, and burn it onto a USB stick with TransMac. It works for 15 days (free trial), but if you wish you can purchase it or /extend it/ via naughty ways haha.  Anyways, burn the dmg file that you downloaded to a USB stick (8GB or more). Than you will need a bootloader. For this to work, I found out that you also need one more USB stick. The thing with OS X is that you can just install Clover into the same disk that OS X is, but there is no way to this on Windows. So you'll need one more USB, but this one doesn't need to be large in size. Even 1GB will do.  For Clover BootDiskUtility will help you burn it onto a USB and make it bootable. Then you can download and put the essential kexts such as FakeSMC and some others for your PC (if any).  Try this method and tell me if you run into some problem.  P.S.: Another alternative is just downloading a distro but I do not recommend it at all. You can download a distro to burn OS X and Clover into one (vanilla method) and make a clean re-install tho, that;s what I did because I didn't have two usb sticks.  Good luck."

When you have your VM (there are tutorials all over Google) just login to the AppStore and download Yosemite... after that you can just creat your boot-install USB following the TonyMacx86 guides and delete the VM.

hackintosh,3cz43m,Alisamix,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:26:58 2015 UTC,Here's what I did to get my actual ALC1150 3 port.  Clover configurator to set the audio id to 2 cause it's a three port 5.1 card. Toledo has a clover.command thing in his github (I'm on mobile so I'm being lazy. Read the instructions he has for 8xx and then run the command and then enable HDA injection in clover configurator. You need a clean HDA (one is in the link you posted) and requires no HDA EFI kext injection. PM me if you need further instruction  Edit: not 8xx whatever the command prompts you to say yes to

hackintosh,3cya6d,SwimminAss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:40:52 2015 UTC,"You just update it through Mac App Store. Updates includes security fixes, so probably yes depending on how comfortable you feel redoing things if things breaks.  In my case whenever I update I usually have to load the audio and network drives."
hackintosh,3cya6d,cookie_e,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:47:36 2015 UTC,Oh ok I was afraid of the store and well I've spent probably 6 hrs that last two days trouble shooting on my build so I'll probably enjoy it working for a while
hackintosh,3cya6d,cookie_e,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:05:34 2015 UTC,Absolutely! Once you have a working setup just enjoy and solve a problem and tweak things one thing a day. It's much less hassle that way and don't have to juggle 10 things all at once.
hackintosh,3cya6d,SnOwT1g3R,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:09:21 2015 UTC,If using Clover then app store update or use the combo update from Apple's website. After you will probably have to reinstall audio and video kext. Those's are the normal things to fix with each update.
hackintosh,3cya6d,SnOwT1g3R,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:31:49 2015 UTC,I didn't use clover. And I'm assuming by the audio and network u mean run multibeast again?
hackintosh,3cya6d,amazinjoey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"For audio then yes run and install the kext using multi beast again. For video it will depend on if you are using Intel, AMD, or Nvidia GFX. For Nvidia use the web drivers, for AMD just use patched apple ones. Check the forums on http://www.tonymacx86.com if you need more video card help."
hackintosh,3czaef,foodandnaps,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:32:01 2015 UTC,What's your budget? What's your favorite brand? How much power do you actually want? Will you be dual booting/using this also as a gaming machine? How easy do you want the install to be? Do you want UEFI EFI or Chameleon?
hackintosh,3czaef,austin76016,0,Sun Jul 12 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"my budget is a begrudging max of $1500.  Favorite brand is a macbook pro, and I don’t have much experience with windows notebooks. I like what acer and asus are doing right now though in terms of performance and aesthetics packed into thin laptops (aspire and zenbook lines).  As much power so that the machine has no problem dealing with the increased load of more complicated software and games for hopefully 5 years. A quad core would be nice, 8GB of RAM and an SSD (at least 250 gb) are essential, even if I can just upgrade those later.  I’ll have bootcamp installed when I need windows for excel, modeling, or the occasional games, but I plan on using Mac OS 90% of the time  Fairly easy install, this will be my first project like this.  I don’t even understand that last question unfortunately. I realize those deal with the firmware but I have no idea what the differences between them are"
hackintosh,3czaef,austin76016,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:08 2015 UTC,Alright my friend here's a couple of bombshells lol.  Acer is crap. What kind of games do you plan on? (the gfx card really matters) Asus is great in laptops for hackintosh support. Boot camp is not what you'd use. You would use Clover UEFI. The method will be fairly specific to whichever laptop you install and if you are not somewhat proficient in terminal I wouldn't recommend doing this in the first place.
hackintosh,3czaef,GalacticSpaceTiger,0,Sun Jul 12 04:14:30 2015 UTC,it sounds like maybe I’ve bitten off more than I can chew unfortunately
hackintosh,3czaef,marianco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:16:36 2015 UTC,"As Austin said, Asus is great supporting hackintosh, as well as the HP ProBook line. I like the way the ProBooks look, personally, but their hardware might need to be upgraded... You can get some off amazon for pretty cheap, and obviously research some decent WiFi cards with hackintosh support. Any questions, hit me up."
hackintosh,3czaef,GalacticSpaceTiger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:57:14 2015 UTC,So what models of Asus and HP laptops can be transformed into a Hackintosh?

When you know the exact method for enabling graphics, replace kexts, do patching etc. Use guides available for your integrated graphics. If you are using nvidia card.

hackintosh,3cyjdz,TheRacerMaster,2,Sun Jul 12 09:15:42 2015 UTC,Using Clover is a good idea. What configuration (config.plist) are you using? Make sure you are using the UEFI version.

hackintosh,3cw2vk,TheLeftoverTrailMix,2,Sat Jul 11 06:52:03 2015 UTC,"Here's what you need to do:  You are running on a Haswell platform, meaning Mac Pro 3,1 is not the best system definition. I recommend downloading Clover Configurator to do all the following changes.  Step 1) Open your config.plist file in Clover Configurator.  Step 2) Under SMBIOS click the magic wand to change system definitions.  Step 3) Click magic wand. Click iMac logo. Select iMac (14,2) system definition and ""shake"" the two values under serial generator. Click okay. Copy serial number to this website and make sure it isn't in use. It should identify as an iMac and give two options for support but that's it. Generate another serial if it's in use. Save and restart.  Step 4) Download this tool here to find out your ROM (en0) and MLB (Board Serial Number) values.  Step 5) Copy and paste your generated board serial number into the ""Board Serial Number"" in the SMBIOS and under the MLB box in the Rt Variables section. Copy and paste ROM value into ROM box under Rt Variables Section.  Step 6) Open the terminal and generate a new UUID using the uuidgen command. Copy and paste this in the SmUUID box in the SMBIOS section. Replace the last 12 digits with your ROM value. Also make sure ""Inject System ID"" is checked in the System parameters section. Save and reboot.  Step 7) You should be good to go! Try logging into iMessage and it should work flawlessly. If it doesn't, go back and double check to make sure your numbers were copied correctly.  I hope this helps!  Also, as others have pointed out. Ethernet MUST be en0 and wifi must be en1. Under About This Mac>System Report...>Ethernet Cards>BSD name: en0. Wifi interface must be en1. If they aren't then remove all networking interfaces in network preferences, apply settings, and delete Library>Preferences>System Configuration>NetworkInterfaces.plist. Empty trash and reboot. Sorry if I repeated anything you've already tried, I just followed these steps to a t and have never had any problems."

When I first set up iMessage a year ago, I think I had similar problems but the moment I added a credit card to my account, it worked.  Also, if you followed all the steps for using a custom MLB, it took about a week for Apple's servers to accept it for me. I'm not exactly sure why, but at one point I read somewhere that there is a token on Apple's servers linked to your Mac/hackintosh's MLB that expires about every week. During that time, I could log in but all my iMessage contacts were in red.  So in short, try adding a credit card and waiting about a week. Good luck!"

Even if you partition the disk into different formats for different OS, I believe you can change the partition sizes after the fact if you realize you have to move around some space."

Try googling the card to see compatibility with current versions.  I world recommend the latest CPU from Intel on lga 1150. I don't think there is x99 support without custom kernels so know that.
hackintosh,3crfpw,shadwblade2652,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:12:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I've seen a few things regarding the 7970 (and other 7000 series GPUs) but they seem to be a relatively simple fix.   And thanks for the recommendation

None of the stock framebuffer personalities support this out of the box, so you'll have to patch it. I own this card, and you can find more info here.

This usually just fails with an error, but it is annoying when it happens every time you boot Win7 64 in VBox. There are instructions in their (hefty) PDF documentation on how to do this. I used this method for quite a while, before I decided to dual-boot. It is a great way to save more than a minute doing a reboot reboot sequence, especially if you only want to run a simple program.  I never had an issue with this, but did have to recreate the virtual drive (which is only a tiny pointer file) once due to a permissions issue."
hackintosh,3cqlo9,Bcyhrooyn,7,Thu Jul 9 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"Dual-booting with an existing install of Windows complicates things quite a bit, because Windows creates a EFI System Partition (ESP) that's (usually) only 100MiB. Disk Utility is designed for real Macs (duh), and it expects a 200MiB or larger ESP (disks partitioned with Disk Utility will have a 200MiB ESP). This is assuming you installed Windows using UEFI in the first place (if not, it'll complicate things even more). You could use a partitioning tool to resize the ESP, but IIRC, that might not work either, because the Windows installer places the Microsoft Recovery (MSR) partition before the EFI partition (Disk Utility expects it to be the first partition on the disk).  However, you could try using GParted or a different Linux live CD and create a HFS+ partition using that instead of Disk Utility (note that HFS+ partitions created by Linux are not journaled, you'll want to enable this manually in Disk Utility later, which should work fine). Note that I haven't tried this at all, so try it at your own risk (nothing bad should happen, but as always, BACK YOUR SHIT UP! Especially when dealing with partitioning).  Now, if you do decide to redo everything and reinstall Windows, you can partition the disk yourself instead of letting Windows do it, allowing both Windows and OS X to run on the same disk. Here's a short guide I wrote for dual booting Windows and OS X on a single drive.  Requirements:   UEFI-capable system Clover EFI bootloader   Steps:   Boot the Windows installer disc/USB drive & open Command Prompt (press Shift+F10 at the installer window) Partition your drive using diskpart   Find your drive: list disk Select your drive: select disk 0 (note that 0 might not be your disk!) Wipe the drive: clean Partition the drive using the GUID partition table: convert gpt Create the EFI System Partition (ESP): create partition efi size=200 Format the ESP as FAT32: format fs=fat32 Create the Microsoft Recovery Partition (MSR): create partition msr size=128 Create the Windows partition: create partition primary size=131072 (note that this is in mebibytes [1 GiB = 1024 MiB], so this is ~128GiB) Format the Windows partition as NTFS: format fs=ntfs  Install Windows to the created Windows partition (select Custom (advanced) install) Boot the OS X installer USB (with the Clover bootloader) & open Disk Utility (Utilities>Disk Utility) Create the OS X partition using Disk Utility (press + to add a partition) Install OS X to the created OS X partition Boot the OS X partition from the installer USB and install Clover to the ESP for UEFI booting   If you followed these steps correctly, your drive's partition layout should look something like this (using BSD device names, like OS X) [note that this focuses on the EFI bootloader files (.efi)]:  /dev/disk0 ├── /dev/disk0s1 (ESP) │   └── EFI │       ├── BOOT │       │   └── BOOTX64.efi (Clover bootloader) │       ├── CLOVER │       │   ├── CLOVERX64.efi (Clover bootloader) │       │   └── [other contents of the Clover folder] │       └── Microsoft │           ├── bootmgfw.efi (Windows bootloader) │           └── [other contents of the Microsoft folder] ├── /dev/disk0s2 (MSR) │   └── [contents of the Microsoft Recovery partition] ├── /dev/disk0s3 (Windows) │   └── [contents of the Windows partition] ├── /dev/disk0s4 (OS X) │   ├── System │   │   └── Library │   │       └── CoreServices │   │           └── boot.efi (OS X bootloader) │   └── [other contents of the OS X partition] └── /dev/disk0s5 (Recovery HD)     └── [contents of the OS X Recovery partition]   The last step is to set up custom entries in config.plist so you can also boot your Windows install from Clover. Here's an example (goes under the GUI section in config.plist)  <key>Entries</key> <array>     <dict>         <key>FullTitle</key>         <string>OS X 10.11</string>         <key>Volume</key>         <string>BD9EB185-AD75-4958-AD76-258BEAC75738</string>         <key>Path</key>         <string>\System\Library\CoreServices\boot.efi</string>         <key>Type</key>         <string>OSX</string>     </dict>     <dict>         <key>FullTitle</key>         <string>Windows 8.1</string>         <key>Volume</key>         <string>46A62A48-7C2A-4410-986A-DA3437ADD99B</string>         <key>Path</key>         <string>\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi</string>         <key>Type</key>         <string>Windows</string>     </dict> </array>   The Volume keys use the partition UUIDs to identify themselves. You can find these in OS X using the command line version of Disk Utility (diskutil).  Assuming the same example partition setup shown previously, you'd use diskutil info /dev/disk0s4 | grep 'Partition UUID' to find the UUID of the OS X partition (boot.efi is on the OS X partition itself).  For a UEFI Windows install using the same example partition setup, you'd use diskutil info /dev/disk0s1 | grep 'Partition UUID' because bootmgfw.efi (the Windows UEFI bootloader) is on the EFI partition.  If you are curious, more info about custom entries can be found here on the Clover wiki.  Once you do this (and confirm you did it correctly), you should be able to reboot and see your custom entries added to the menu. Make sure you confirm they work before you move on to the next step!  Since we have custom entries, we can now disable Clover's automatic scanning to clean up our boot menu. This, of course, is optional. Disable all scanning entries under the Scan section. Here's an example of what this looks like in config.plist (under the GUI section):  <key>Scan</key> <dict>     <key>Entries</key>     <false/>     <key>Legacy</key>     <false/>     <key>Tool</key>     <false/> </dict>   Note that disabling Tool scanning will disable the EFI shell and some other things. If you use this, don't disable it!  More info about the scanning options can be found here on the Clover wiki.  This should cover it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

System Partition     The PC should contain one system partition. On Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) and UEFI systems, this is also known as the EFI System Partition, or the ESP. This partition is usually stored on the primary hard drive. The PC boots to this partition.  The minimum size of this partition is 100 MB, and must be formatted using the FAT32 file format.  This partition is managed by the operating system, and should not contain any other files, including Windows RE tools.   Note     For Advanced Format 4K Native drives (4-KB-per-sector) drives, the minimum size is 260 MB, due to a limitation of the FAT32 file format. The minimum partition size of FAT32 drives is calculated as sector size (4KB) x 65527 = 256 MB.  Advanced Format 512e drives are not affected by this limitation, because their emulated sector size is 512 bytes. 512 bytes x 65527 = 32 MB, which is less than the 100 MB minimum size for this partition."

If you really want the best performance, OSX runs a hell of a lot better on a SSD. Again, it's still better to have 2 separate drives, but now since your giving out details. I would recommend installing OSX on the 500GB SSD, partition the tail end of your SSD with maybe 200GB or whatever you decide you need as NTFS.

If you have your Windows on SSD already just leave it be and make a partition on HDD for OS X. Apart from usual HDD slowness there is no downside of installing it there.  I actually had my OS X installation on a 7-8 year old HDD, used it from 10.7 to 10.9. Only a week ago I moved OS X to SSD. Moving settings for apps and apps them selves are very easy on OS X and when you decide to move OS X to SSD as well you could do so with little to no loss."

The program's you listed are a few versions back, that don't require much power to run. While I'm sure the idea of a Hackintosh is nice, if it's not your computer, and the person that has to use it isn't set to deal with small (and large) bugs, it's going to be an absolute headache.   Edit: I do want to be helpful if you still plan on Hackintoshing. Don't just assume a Mac is $2000, as you can find them way cheaper (Mac Mini listed at $400 at Microcenter) or used. The cost difference isn't THAT huge anymore. But, it's your money (or at least your moms) so if you want to Hack for her, my only recommendation is to get everything you can that is natively supported. This might mean getting a $50 Broadcom wifi card over the cheaper TPlink. An older, but native, GPU. Going straight to using USB audio. The idea is to have as little as possible to have to configure using Clover. The less that can go wrong, the better.   In the end tho, I still feel like a Mini, or referb IMac is a better investment of money over a Hack if it's for your mom. Unless your mom is very smart with computers and wants to deal with the bugs."

They like the OS, but they can't afford the hardware.    You can totally hackintosh your way into getting the software to work, but it will take a long time to get all of the tweaks working.  You'll want sound, and video working perfectly which might take some testing.  I was doing full backups, and then changing a kext, then restoring if it didn't go so well.  It took me 2 weeks to get my machine up and running and another 2 or 3 weekends to get my install working perfectly (networking, sound, gpu fans).    IMHO, if its for school, get a loan and get the laptop.  You don't want to risk suddenly getting issues months down the line and risking your schoolwork.  That said, if you're willing to spend lots of time to get your machine working, its a fun project."

hackintosh,3cpy1w,rapidsalad,2,Fri Jul 10 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, it depends on how you set it up, how well you understand your system and your hardware.  TAKE GOOD NOTES on each thing you do (evernote or google keep).  Just have good backups of your OS and your work.  I had a spare external hard drive, so I used clonezilla to make fully replaceable backup before i started tinkering around.  It's free, and it works with every OS, so its a good tool to have in your repertoire.    It sounds like you're already interested in doing it.  Yesterday, you said today, so JUST DO IT.

And in my experience with Apple's warranty/support/etc, there's really no advantage compared to what other companies offer. (I understand that Apple has higher build quality and better rated components, but that's a premium luxury that only really benefits professionals and users who don't plan/know to upgrade their devices periodically. I also believe that this only justifies a fraction of the device's price - a lot of the cost still goes towards the brand name.)  Don't worry, I'm not looking at some Celeron-powered 720p netbook.

If you want the overclock in OSX you'll need to check out piker's ssdtprgen, create custom ssdt to take advantage of the OC in OSX. Have only the drive that you want OSX installed in or enabled in your computer, disable all others in BIOS or unplug them. Install OSX. Steps here will vary depending on you bootloader preference(I prefer clover, everyone should) Once successfully bootable into OSX without your USB installer do the same you did for installing OSX but with your Windows drive. Unplug/Disable all others leaving only your windows drive. Your windows installation media if on USB should be UEFI bootable. Windows install completes, now enable/plug back in your mac drive, boot into bios make sure priority is set to mac so your system boots that first. Now when you computer boots you select OSX or Win.

hackintosh,3co3yf,audio_pile,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:58:56 2015 UTC,About This Mac recognises it properly as a 770 with 2048MB of VRAM if that's what you mean.
hackintosh,3co3yf,audio_pile,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:31:06 2015 UTC,Don't have any good guesses for you off the top of my head. On a real mac or perfectly configured hack you should be able to use every display you can plug in (to the limits of the graphics chipset). 4 should be no problem; I've done the same in the past.  I can say that my own GTX 770 was working fine with 10.10.x. (using a different card currently.) w/ multi display. I was using Clover as boot loader; had nvidia inject=no (which is supposed to be normal for this card) to let the OS grab the hardware properly.  I was not personally using any VGA though or any internal IGP. Just 3 DVI/DP displays via the DP/DVI/HDMI. I have had VGA converter issues with past AMD stuff; but not sure if the 770 has any known problems like that.
hackintosh,3cn47b,PatPatTheMarauder,2,Thu Jul 9 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"What are you using for a sound card? Im assuming onboard audio since there is no linked sound device.  I built my hack for audio production as well and if you are taking it at all serious you are going to want a simple 2x2 USB DAC(try and find a list of 100% for sure working DAC, there is a list somewhere on tonymac or insanelymac)  Onboard tends to be junk for audio production because the line level signal has a super high noise floor, it works if you are 100% in the box but not having balanced outputs is suboptimal.  I could never get my integrated audio to function properly and gave up shortly after.  If you are already using a dedicated sound device, try screwing around with your format at 44000hz or 48000hz, some devices can only do one properly. Check to make sure you are using the USB cable that came with the device, usually they have 2 ferrite cores on them to help reduce EMI interference. My DAC did the same thing when i use a standard B usb cable.  I had a similar problem using the native drivers for my DAC in windows, it was fixed by installing ASIO4ALL and adjusting the buffer size  OSX doesn't have any native buffer settings like ASIO4ALL if i remember correctly so this is purely anecdotal."

I waited until my the next round and tried to boot with -x and it just got stuck on the white Apple screen after the load bar got all the way through. I waited for 20 minutes (just in case) and never got past the boot screen.   So I went back and booted with -x -v and it got stuck after saying something about an I/o error. It's odd because I can write to and from the disk. When mounted as an external hard drive on OS X.   I'm lost. I think I'll try to start at the beginning with Yosemite."
hackintosh,3cj4kd,mrstejdm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:54:10 2015 UTC,"Was the OS X drive connected when you updated? Sometimes Windows likes to use another drive for it's System Reserve. To get around this I always unplug/unpower the other drives so the System Reserve/Windows are on the same drive. So in this case, it may have wiped your OS X Drive.  Another point is that you may have broken the bootloader as you said. Can you use your OS X USB Key, select from bios to boot via that USB, if you then see multibeast with Windows, OS X and the USB then try and boot into OS X and see if its working. If it is. Then you just need to reconfigure Multibeast as it was removed when you updated Windows.  Personally I would wait til 10 is out before jumping to it. As for OS X, I would suggest using something newer than ML as its about to EOL. Yosemite is fine and I believe it wont be too much effort to go from Yosemite to El Capitan"

Picking the right SMBIOS is the first thing you need to do; choose a real Mac that has similar specs as your hardware (processor generation at least)  and use that as your SMBIOS.

The only major pain I've encountered throughout the years was installing a new OS. Sometimes they went perfectly but other times I had to spend a day trying to get it to install. Once the OS was installed, it was usually smooth sailing from there. The only thing that has recently been a huge pain in the ass is iMessage. I spent 2 days trying to get it to work and in the end I couldn't get it to work.   To me it has been totally worth it. I get to have a PC that I can upgrade when and how I want with the added bonus of having the latest version of Mac OS X. I don't use Mac OS X for heavy photo/video editing or anything like that. I just mainly use it for web browsing and using excel/word, so I can't really comment on my experiences with Final Cut Pro and other programs like that."

hackintosh,3cg7be,ratdotexe,2,Tue Jul 7 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest, a bit of a pain.    I get random graphical glitches on web videos (although they self resolve if I refresh the page).  I can't use the green speaker out on my motherboard, instead I have to use one of the surround channels. Would be fine, but since I dual boot with Windows it means I have to clamber around under the desk to change outputs.  Opening videos with QuickLook sometimes crashed the PC, so I disabled it.  QuickTime is iffy so I use VLC. Safari videos sometimes crash the PC. But I use Chrome anyway. I usually get a crash if I've booted into my Windows drive immediately before. No idea why, I think its something with the graphics card, but rebooting again everything is fine. iMessage is a pain, but it's mostly been fine since Yosemite came out.   So overall, problems are mostly related to video playback. I video edit in Premiere Pro (and sometimes Screenflow) and have never had a crash related to them, so it's perfectly workable. I keep a drive clone before doing any OS updates just in case."

Once every couple months my hackintosh unexpectedly restarts after waking up from sleep, but I don't experience any other crashes or video issues like some other users. Getting a well supported Gigabyte motherboard and a Nvidia card that's natively supported in OS X and using Clover UEFI bootloader made all the difference.  If you look at Mac 64bit performance benchmarks, my build outperforms every Mac in single core performance and outperforms every iMac in multi-core performance. For what I paid to build it, it serves me very well for editing video with Premiere.

I also just use USB sound to avoid setting up onboard sound, which looks to be a big pain point.  The third-party driver I do have to use is to get onboard ethernet working, but the Intel Gigabit driver build for i217v works well enough apparently.  I updated to the latest FakeSMC.kext and wake from sleep works better now -- the fans don't spin up and I can wake from the bluetooth mouse now.  I've seen no USB issues yet, and Clover has handled updates (10.10.0 -> .3 -> .4 and 10.11 DP1 -> DP2) from Apple cleanly thus far. Things are working beyond my expectations, maybe thanks to the Gigabyte MB, maybe not.  Well, except for mame64/SDL.

hackintosh,3cg7be,lpave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"Hackintoshing is a hobby for me for about 8 years, and I have managed to build two perfect Hackintoshes accidentally in that time..., one of which is my current laptop (Acer Aspire 4752). I had 10.9.5 installed on my regular desktop computer as a dual-boot, but ever since trying Yosemite, I cannot seem to get mavericks to run properly again. I may try again when I reinstall 500GB HDD.  If you follow purchase guides, and install guides to the letter, you should get a 99.9% working Macintosh. The 0.01% is Sleep related, and other small hardware issues, that should not impact day-to-day use. Even my crappy random Hackintoshes were about 98.5% compatible, and only issues seemed to be Firewire (don't use) and power management related (fans/temps/speeds).  If you are interested in eventually getting (affording) a Mac, then this is a perfect introduction and learning platform, plus all the software you buy online can be transferred when you finally get your Mac (I got a Late-2013 21.5"" iMac, and could not be happier)."

At one point the BT settings menu showed the trackpad as a device but it could not pair, it said there was an error trying to pair. Is there another tool that can be used to specify my adapter as the BT controller in Yosemite? I know how to do it in linux with bluetoothctl, is there something similar for os x?   I haven't been able to see any other devices in Yosemite, and like I said before, pairing hasn't worked.

Memory is affordable and easy to upgrade, but go with at least 8GB. I would also second brokemembers advice on upgrading the SSD capacity. Minimum here is really 240GB, especially if you game. Loading speeds on newer games can take a while, and most of them are utilised for SSD. Would rather have a 1TB ExFAT partition, so both OS X and Win can read and write to the same files.

Yes, you should be able to keep your existing OS X installation and data when you upgrade to a new CPU/motherboard combination. But it won't be effortless, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Any/all of the changes that actually make your hackintosh work are going to be different when you go to a new platform... Things such as boot settings/patched kexts/DSDT stuff. Reinstalling from scratch won't take much more effort than sorting these issues out without reinstalling.   On that note it is always good to consider system software/installations as disposable. Even if you're not doing something unorthodox like a hackintosh this is true-- a Windows installation can be wreaked by viruses or crippled by driver problems when you change hardware configurations. It is smart to get into habits that let you easily re-do your system software without causing yourself too much inconvenience... Keeping valuable data off-site and large data like game or music libraries on a separate hard drive/partition is wise. This lets you nuke your whole operating system partition and start over without much hesitation; which can be a very valuable troubleshooting tool"
hackintosh,3cgqj7,snnh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:35:31 2015 UTC,Understood . Would anything one needs to to do to get OS X working possibly make it non-bootable in Windows?  I'm thinking of BIOS and such.

But there would not be any changes to the BIOS that cause problems with Windows requiring a re-installation or causing permanent issues. You'd simply change any troublesome settings back. It is a good idea to keep Windows and OS X on 2 different hard drives or SSDs to minimize the first kind of problem. It is possible to have each OS run from a different partition of the same physical drive, but that makes it easier to damage one system while making changes to the other."

Don't worry, I'll be very safe with backups and such.  Which reminds me, I seem to remember some Windows software that can save an image of your system drive so you can just restore that instead of re-installing everything, should the worst occur.  For the life of me I have no idea what it was called or what that sort of software is called (not a backup per se, more a of a ""system snapshot"")."
hackintosh,3cgqj7,Hunter_behindthelens,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:06:23 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Windows has a feature called ""restore points"" that let you return the system to a previously-good configuration. These rely on the fact that Windows uses a ""registry"" to keep track of installed software and other system changes, which means that a lot of changes can be undone by simply reverting to the old copy of this system configuration file.   This is not the same thing as storing all of the software/files required by Windows in a backup location. If you lose a lot of information on the drive or make changes that are too serious, this won't work.  It is possible that other third-party tools do what you want them to-- but it sounds like you were remembering system Restore."

I have recently tried to be active on here but some of the questions are literally answered everywhere on this sub and the solution is literally top 5 in a quick Google search.  There should be guidelines to asking questions here and some sort of sticky of how to go about hackin a tosh.   Google search with some smarts. Use the key words hackintosh, your bootloader of preference and OSX version, than your part or issue (e.g. hackintosh clover gtx970 yosemite) Also, a search on this sub, Tony's and Insanely forums of questionable parts usually will quickly lead you to issues, how to solve those issues, failed attempts and or success stories.  There should be steps taken before asking to be spoon fed. It's called a hack for a reason, research and effort is required. TBH half the fun is to have to do some sort of hack job alteration to get your system running properly. Yosemitezone or whatever the fuck premade installer you downloaded and think is magically going make your system work without learning anything is not the way to go about it. This has been annoying as fuck to see. Leads to my next wtf is wrong with people. When you ask for help list your parts and take down notes of what you have done including BIOS changes, boot arguments, kexts, bootloader and options used in your bootloader. Saying I tried everything and it didn't work is basically saying there's nothing left to try. How can people help diagnose or give suggestions when you literally have nothing to give people trying to help you? The side bar has Unibeast method for installation, can we get a Clover method as well? Clover's real power is post install and the versatility is supreme in my opinion of what it can do.

hackintosh,3ce6f1,Colin03129,2,Wed Jul 8 07:26:25 2015 UTC,"No offense to OP but don't take a non hackintosher's advice on video cards. That is one area that they are very finicky. Consult Tonymac on this before deciding which to buy. They will have caveats listed and driver info. AMDs are now better supported than nVidia, often you have to wait for new web drivers on the higher end NV cards vs my AMD which largely was plug and play aside from a couple of performance settings. Same thing on motherboard. You want to use something that has as little issues as possible if you're going to hackintosh - this is the absolute key to having a stable system.  The i5 would be enough for processor, mine is an i5 oc'd quite a bit on water, but video editing is one area the extra threads of the i7 will give an apparent boost. A good video card will mitigate some of that, but there is definitely a difference.  Viewsonic has a better IPS display, especially for color balance. I have a VX2370 series that compares favorably to my Dell ultras at work, both of which I use side by side with my rMBP. Definitely took some manual color balancing but its much better than my old asus.  Two vs one stick of memory should get you some speed bonuses, but ties your hands upgrading later.   I would recommend getting a second cheap small capacity HDD for your hack side of things. I had an old 160gb drive sitting around, which I mirror my system to before any major updates, so I always have a working copy I can revert to if something goes wrong. I've only had to do that a couple of times, but it saved me a TON of time when I did. Simply boot to the other drive, write over the system drive, boot back to the SSD and try again..."

hackintosh,3c96uw,splago,9,Mon Jul 6 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's essentially what I wrote earlier. Before doing anything, make sure you enable the ErP setting in your BIOS. This fixes issues related to USB 3 in OS X. Anyways, let's move on the Clover. I'd recommend doing a clean install. The tonymacx86 guide should work (although I'm not the biggest fan of his work, it is a good guide to create an installer). Make sure you boot the installer twice (after the installer reboots, you need to boot it a second time to create the Recovery HD and finalize the installation, then you can boot your actual OS X install). Since you have a GTX 750 Ti, which is a Maxwell GPU, you will have to disable it to boot OS X. This can be set as a boot flag (nv_disable=1) or you can just boot Safe Mode. Once you boot OS X and are able to complete the setup assistant, you can move on to post installation.  You'll need to install Clover to your system. Since you are using a new board with UEFI, you should only select these options in the installer (after selecting Customize in the installer):   Install Clover for UEFI booting Install Clover in the ESP Drivers64UEFI>OsxAptioFix2Drv-64   This is all you need to select in the installer. Once the installer completes, we can start configuring Clover. First, let's make sure we have the right UEFI drivers installed. Go to the EFI partition (should be mounted by the installer), EFI/CLOVER/drivers64uefi. Remove OsxFatBinaryDrv-64.efi and VboxHfs*.efi (it's buggy compared to the Apple HFS+ EFI driver). Download the Apple HFS+ EFI driver here and place it in the drivers64uefi folder. You should only have three EFI drivers now: FSInject-64.efi, HFSPlus.efi, & OsxAptioFix2Drv-64.efi. Now we need to make sure we have the correct kexts. They can be placed in EFI/CLOVER/kexts/10.10 (or whatever your version of OS X is) or EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other (this will load them for all versions of OS X). Since you have a modern 9-series board, you should only need the following:   FakeSMC-kozlek+HWSensors: The obviously needed SMC device emulator; HWSensors includes extra hardware monitoring drivers IntelMausiEthernet: Driver for Intel i217 NIC on your board AtherosE2200Ethernet: Driver for Atheros AR8161B NIC on your board   You shouldn't need any other kexts. Now you need to configure Clover's options. Open config.plist in EFI/CLOVER. Here's what an example config for your hardware might look like (note that it's missing the plist header):  <key>ACPI</key> <dict>     <key>DSDT</key>     <dict>         <key>Debug</key>         <false/>         <key>DropOEM_DSM</key>         <true/>         <key>Fixes</key>         <dict>             <key>FixRegions_10000000</key>             <true/>             <key>NewWay_80000000</key>             <true/>         </dict>         <key>ReuseFFFF</key>         <false/>     </dict>     <key>SSDT</key>     <dict>         <key>DropOem</key>         <true/>         <key>Generate</key>         <dict>             <key>CStates</key>             <false/>             <key>PStates</key>             <false/>         </dict>     </dict> </dict> <key>Boot</key> <dict>     <key>Arguments</key>     <string>kext-dev-mode=1</string>     <key>Debug</key>     <false/>     <key>DefaultVolume</key>     <string>LastBootedVolume</string>     <key>Legacy</key>     <string>LegacyBiosDefault</string>     <key>Secure</key>     <false/>     <key>Timeout</key>     <integer>5</integer>     <key>XMPDetection</key>     <true/> </dict> <key>Devices</key> <dict>     <key>Audio</key>     <dict>         <key>AFGLowPowerState</key>         <false/>         <key>Inject</key>         <false/>         <key>ResetHDA</key>         <true/>     </dict>     <key>USB</key>     <dict>         <key>FixOwnership</key>         <false/>         <key>Inject</key>         <false/>     </dict> </dict> <key>GUI</key> <dict>     <key>Language</key>     <string>en:0</string>     <key>Mouse</key>     <dict>         <key>DoubleClick</key>         <integer>500</integer>         <key>Enabled</key>         <true/>         <key>Mirror</key>         <false/>         <key>Speed</key>         <integer>8</integer>     </dict>     <key>ScreenResolution</key>     <string>1920x1080</string>     <key>Theme</key>     <string>embedded</string> </dict> <key>Graphics</key> <dict>     <key>Inject</key>     <dict>         <key>ATI</key>         <false/>         <key>Intel</key>         <false/>         <key>NVidia</key>         <false/>     </dict> </dict> <key>KernelAndKextPatches</key> <dict>     <key>AppleRTC</key>     <false/>     <key>KextsToPatch</key>     <array>         <dict>             <key>Comment</key>             <string>Realtek ALC892 AppleHDA Patch</string>             <key>Find</key>             <data>ixnUEQ==</data>             <key>Name</key>             <string>AppleHDA</string>             <key>Replace</key>             <data>kgjsEA==</data>         </dict>     </array> </dict> <key>RtVariables</key> <dict>     <key>MLB</key>     <string>C0XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</string>     <key>ROM</key>     <string>UseMacAddr0</string> </dict> <key>SMBIOS</key> <dict>     <key>ProductName</key>     <string>iMac15,1</string>     <key>SmUUID</key>     <string>B4592B4D-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-068AD9E01AA1</string>     <key>SerialNumber</key>     <string>C02XXXXXFY11</string> </dict> <key>SystemParameters</key> <dict>     <key>InjectKexts</key>     <string>Yes</string>     <key>InjectSystemID</key>     <true/> </dict>   I would highly recommend generating your own serial number, MLB, and SmUUID values according to my iMessage guide as (some) people are idiots and would blindly copy these values (even though they aren't even valid values). These values need to be generated uniquely for your system, otherwise you will run into issues with iMessage blacklisting.  Included in this config.plist is an AppleHDA binary patch for the ALC892. You'll have to use Piker-Alpha's excellent AppleHDA8Series.sh script to generate an injector kext (which can only be placed in /System/Library/Extensions, not the EFI partition) as seen in my guide here. Note that this does not include layout ID injection; you'll want to do this in your DSDT.  I would recommend patching your DSDT. Upload an original copy of your DSDT to a file host and post the link here. This is needed to enable HDMI audio on Maxwell GPUs, and to fix various issues as well.  You'll also want to generate an SSDT for your CPU power management using ssdtPRGen.sh, also by Piker-Alpha. The generated SSDT should be located in ~/Library/ssdtPRGen/SSDT.aml; move it to EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched.  iMac15,1 uses a 9-series chipset and is somewhat close to your hardware, so I'd use that as the SMBIOS. Again, make sure you generate the proper values."

hackintosh,3c9pl4,1800k001,2,Mon Jul 6 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"Specs seem good. I actually just fixed Broadwell CPU detection in Broadwell very recently. That hardware should work in OS X fine. The CPU should be properly identified by Clover. HD5300 should work with the proper ig-platform-id, which for HD 5300 should be 0x161e0001 according to dumps from a MacBook8,1. One thing that will make things complicated is the QHD display. You'll need to set the DVMT pre-allocated memory setting to at least 96MB (128MB is recommended). This will need to be set in an EFI shell (instructions are here - this is for HD5500 laptops but should work similarly with other Broadwell systems). You'll also need to patch IOKit in OS X for the high pixel clock used by the QHD display to work properly. I'm assuming the Broadcom Wireless AC+BT4.0 card is the BCM4352HMB which should work with Wireless Half Mini by toleda. If you have any questions, just ask.  NOTE: You'll need to use OS X 10.10.3 or higher; previous versions of OS X don't have Broadwell support. Note that CPUSensors in FakeSMC is incompatible with Broadwell CPUs so don't install it. Also, you may encounter freezes or other graphics issues with OS X Yosemite. El Capitan fixes these issues, but it is a developer beta.  Edit: The Clover package on the SourceForge page is kinda out of date and doesn't have the Broadwell CPU detection fix. Here's a package built from the latest revision (r3248) which has the fix."

The OS doesn't automatically detect the AMD series cards if you're doing a vanilla Mackintosh Install (which is what I assume the OP is doing).   This is false.  Source: own 270X, have vanilla setup.  I would actually argue that NVIDIA cards, at least Maxwell cards, are the more difficult ones. They rely solely on the NVIDIA Web Drivers; every time a new OS version comes out, you have to wait for NVIDIA to ship new drivers, otherwise you risk breaking your system. If, for any reason, you cannot access their drivers, you're basically screwed QE/CI-wise.  AMD cards, even up until now, have always had native OS support. The most I had to do was create a custom framebuffer for my 270X, and that's because I wanted to use the DVI-D port. Otherwise, it works OOB with DVI-I. The 5000, 6000, and 7000 series all, at one point or another, had native OS support, most commonly with the simple tweak of a plist."

The issue I encountered was that the guide I followed was slightly vague. So, when you are in Multibeast, in QuickStart (left-most option in the toolbar above the table display), select whatever option is appropriate for your system - mine is DSDT-free and it is likely that yours will be as well. After that, Multibeast will load optimized defaults (this is NOT stated on tonymacx86, but it's the truth) without you having to manually select everything. With that being said, you do have some changes you need to make: You WILL have to go and manually check the driver kexts you need - no one can tell you which ones you need without knowing what your hardware is, so that will just take knowing what your hardware needs. In ""Customize"", you need to UNCHECK ""Generate CPU States"". (You can also check ""Instant Menu"" to get that nice little UI displaying the boot options). There are other options in Customize, but I am not intimately familiar with them all. I'll leave you with a link on how to use multibeast that goes further in to detail:   http://www.macbreaker.com/2014/11/how-to-use-multibeast-7-yosemite-guide.html  After all of that is squared away, you will also need to install the web drivers for the version of Yosemite. Those can be found here: http://www.macvidcards.com/which-driver-should-i-install-for-my-new-gpu.html  After you install the driver, your system will need to reboot. Let it do its thing. It might hang a bit after the screen goes black and you may see some text/ get some random errors. Don't stress about that. Just let it run because it should turn off within 5 minutes (maybe longer if your hardware is slow). Then when it's starting back up, you'll be brought back to the boot menu screen: select the Yosemite OS, but this time, you shouldn't have to use any flags at all - assuming the drivers installed correctly.  Aaaaaaand, you're still not done (if you had the issues that I did). OS X will continue to use the default OS X graphics driver, so you have to go in to System Preferences, and then select Nvidia driver manager at the bottom of the window. You'll have to unlock the window to make changes by clicking the lock symbol at the bottom of the window and enter your password. After that, just click the nVidia driver you installed (it will show up in the list, but it will be unchecked by default) and your system will restart once again, but this time... looking nice and pretty! (Hopefully, haha).  Hope this helped a little"

hackintosh,3c513l,Rossistboss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between downscaling and scaling. With scaling, the size of the user interface is changed, allowing pixels beyond the 1:1 ratio that the UI would normally have. Running a 1440p display with the UI sized for 1440p would be 1:1. A UI sized for 1440p running on a 2160p (4K) display would be a different ratio. This is also called High DPI and subpixel rendering.   With downscaling, everything is rendered at a higher resolution than the monitor is capable of, then that render is made smaller for the display while retaining the UI size the higher resolution would have.   What you are doing is scaling.   I am not sure about specific displayport specifications."

hackintosh,3bzrtl,Beowolve,18,Fri Jul 3 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"It would affect it on separate drives as well. Secureboot is a bios feature, so it will stop a boot regardless of where you try to boot from.  Fortunately, it is only a mandatory feature on OEM PCs that come with the ""Designed for Windows"" certification/sticker. So if you built your own PC, it is unlikely you'll have a motherboard that doesn't allow you to disable secure boot.  Still, this will potentially fuck over a lot of people who didn't build their own PC, including pretty much all laptop, tablet, HTPC, etc owners."

From the original article...  http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/windows-10-to-make-the-secure-boot-alt-os-lock-out-a-reality/   Microsoft says that the switch to allow Secure Boot to be turned off is now optional.   OEMs will decide whether to include a setting to disable/enable SecureBoot in the UEFI.   I reckon a lot of OEMs will allow SecureBoot to be disabled on their business PCs (Lenovo ThinkPads etc.) so that companies can still downgrade to Windows 7, but perhaps not on their consumer PCs.  Some Linux distros already support SecureBoot so they won't have any problems dual-booting with Windows 10."

It's time to clarify some things because it seems no one else does:  Let's start with some important points...   You are not supposed to turn off secureboot You should never have a reason to turn off secureboot Secureboot itself is not made to be turned off.    and most importantly...    Secureboot is not a windows only thing**   Secureboot, as the name implies, fortifies the boot procedure by making sure everything is damn well signed up and unmodified. There is this cloud of misinformation about how it is a system intended to lock you on an inferior OS, but it isn't.  Secureboot is an integral part of the bootup of a modern and secure operating system, period.   Oversimplification here, it all comes down to having your bootable file in a bios whitelist. That whitelist, sadly, comes from Microsoft.  Ubuntu, Fedora, and others made Microsoft sign their grub2 bootloaders so their distros could be booted out of the box on UEFI laptops, and that's great. Except for the part that it costs money.  Could the Clover guys do that? Sure. Totally possible. Money part sucks, though.  Does it matter?   Absolutely not.  That aforementioned bios whitelist is freely user modifiable. You can add whichever keys you please to its archive and it will boot those files, all from within the bios itself. There are even UEFI tools that simplify the process of adding bootable files to the whitelist to a simple ""Press Enter to sign bootloader and boot Arch Linux""  Boom. Done. You can now enjoy a proper boot process AND your favorite operating system.   There is a problem with philosophy, who controls the out of the box keys, and all that, but that doesn't justify the uproar that happens every time this thing is mentioned.   I hope I clarified this clusterfuck"
hackintosh,3bzrtl,p4block,3,Fri Jul 3 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"Could the Clover guys do that? Sure. Totally possible. Money part sucks, though.   It's $99"
hackintosh,3bzrtl,svn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:19:36 2015 UTC,"That whitelist, sadly, comes from Microsoft   I thought it was the signatures for the Windows EFI executable(s) that came from Microsoft, not the whitelist since that's controlled by each OEM?  https://www.happyassassin.net/2014/01/25/uefi-boot-how-does-that-actually-work-then/   Secure Boot is defined in chapter 28 of the UEFI spec (2.4a, anyway). It’s actually a pretty clever mechanism. But what it does can be described very, very simply. It says that the firmware can contain a set of signatures, and refuse to run any EFI executable which is not signed with one of those signatures.  Using public key cryptography to verify the integrity of something is hardly a radical or evil concept. Pretty much all Linux distributions depend on it – we sign our packages and have our package managers go AWOOGA AWOOGA if you try to install a package which isn't signed with one of our keys. This isn't us being evil, and I don’t think anyone’s ever accused an OS of being evil for using public key cryptographic signing to establish trust in this way. Secure Boot is literally this exact same perfectly widely accepted mechanism, applied to the boot chain. Yet because a bunch of journalists wildly grasped the wrong end of the stick, it’s widely considered to be slightly more evil than Hitler.  Secure Boot, as defined in the UEFI spec, says nothing at all about what the keys the firmware trusts should be, or where they should come from.    Secure Boot in the Real World  Most of the unhappiness about Secure Boot is not really about Secure Boot the mechanism – whether the people expressing that unhappiness think it is or not – but about specific implementations of Secure Boot in the real world.  The only one we really care about is Secure Boot as it’s implemented on PCs shipped with Microsoft Windows 8 or higher pre-installed.  Microsoft has these things called the Windows Hardware Certification Requirements. If you want to get cheap volume licenses of Windows from Microsoft to pre-install on your computers and have a nice “reassuring” ‘Microsoft Approved!’ sticker or whatever on the case, you have to comply with these requirements. That’s all the force they have.  Another important note here is that while the certification requirements state that the out-of-the-box list of trusted keys must include Microsoft’s key, they don’t say, for e.g., that it must not include any other keys. The requirements explicitly and intentionally allow for the system to ship with any number of other trusted keys, too.  These requirements aren’t present entirely out of the goodness of Microsoft’s heart, or anything – they’re present in large part because other people explained to Microsoft that if they weren’t present, it’d have a hell of a lawsuit on its hands – but they are present. Anyone who actually understands UEFI and Secure Boot cannot possibly read the requirements any other way, they are extremely clear and unambiguous."

They include other signatures too, but that doesn't change that your custom compiled kernel / chameleon bootloader / old SystemRescueCD will not boot in there.  All of this is meaningless anyway as long as you can add the keys yourself."

Then reformat all your drives (easiest to start from scratch).  Unplug all your hard drives except for the one you will be installing Windows on, and install windows. After that fully finishes, unplug all your hard drives except for the one you will be installing Yosemite on and boot from your clover disk, and install all the way through. Then use your clover disk to instead boot the drive you installed Yosemite on instead of the usb, relaunch the clover installer, and install on your Yosemite drive, Now you can boot without the usb. Now boot into Yosemite get all your kexts installed like ethernet, and nvidia drivers, and sound working. Then you can reboot again but now will all of your hard drives plugged in, and you can choose where to boot from, choose Yosemite, and go into disk utility and you can reformat your drives for documents and games, and maybe give some space to Yosemite.

hackintosh,3bnt4x,issak42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:43:11 2015 UTC,"The CPU and chipset are not natively supported by Mac as far as I know.  May I ask why you would want that CPU? It looks like a gaming PC, yet features a rendering CPU and a regular monitor. Most gamers tend to go for the i7 and i5, paired with a gaming monitor.  If some budget is of concern, I'd advise spreading it for comfort and usability: going for the 4770K, a GA-Z97X board, using a 128GB SSD for Mac and an additional 256GB SSD for Windows (Or a single 512GB SSD). Then pick a nice 144Hz monitor and check at the gaming pc subreddits to see if they have any concerns with it."
hackintosh,3bnt4x,Random2700,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:16:36 2015 UTC,"I wanted to use the x99 architecture because this is going to be my computer in the long term so i figured that picking the newest architecture would be a good idea so I based it off this build, In the future I do need to use it for some rendering but I will admit that I didn't know that the cpu I picked would be particularly unsuited for gaming. I just tried to make an x99 pc to fit in my budget. I also really want a super 21:9 monitor so I prioritized that over the framerate. Are the benefits of x99 not worth the expense?"
hackintosh,3bnt4x,Random2700,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:14:06 2015 UTC,"You want it to be recent to make sure it's future proof, you have some plans on rendering and you really like the 21:9 monitors. All right.  Professionally I concern myself with efficiency and productivity, which means most everything runs Windows, some Linux and some Macbook Pros run OS X. Which, as you might imagine, is a bit away from what you're looking for. Therefore, I strongly advise you to check in at /r/BuildAPC to make sure about anything and everything before purchase. As well as double check here and on the dedicated Hackintosh fora in the sidebar for compatibility.  Future proof: the CPU you're looking at is Haswell-E, which is an older architecture than the current Broadwell and upcoming Skylake. Currently, it's expected that high end Skylake CPUs will be available in quarter 4 of 2015, in case you really want the newest of the newest. Most gamers seem to go for the i5-4690K and i7-4790K at the moment, though there are quite a few people who recommend on those wishing for future proof components to wait for Skylake, because it's 2 generations for a few months of waiting. X99 is suggested for extremists (4K gaming with SLI 980ti).  Rendering: i7 processors are typically used for rendering of video by consumers, with the regular ones used by more general consumers, and the extreme i7s for some semi-professional users (such as daily YouTube uploaders).  Now, as for the monitor. Do whatever you like, but mention to the /r/BuildAPC people that you're not going to be gaming on 4K and at 60fps max.  Additionally, I still recommend dual-booting Windows alongside Mac for gaming. Especially with DX12 coming to everyone in less than a month, you're going to want to. While gaming on a Mac is possible, the performance is sadly not up to scratch yet, and while there's some hope in the future there's a low marketshare so less focus on it. And you might also be interested in a micro-ATX or mini-ITX pc, seeing as you'll plug but one card in."

I would recommend using a patched AppleHDA injector with Clover instead of Chimera/MultiBeast. Also, a ton of stuff you selected is unnecessary/out of date:   VoodooHDA: Bad quality audio, ALC1150 works with patched AppleHDA 3rd Party SATA: Unless this board has a Marvell/ASMedia chipset for some of the SATA ports, this is unnecessary; use Intel SATA 3 ports if possible, they are the fastest and have native support NullCPUPowerManagement: Disables CPU power management which is dumb, should work native with this board + generated SSDT with ssdtPRGen USB 3.0 Universal (assuming this is GenericUSBXHCI): Kext for generic USB 3.0 support, doesn't work properly on Yosemite and buggy; USB 3.0 on that board should have native support, just set ErP to Enabled in the UEFI and use the native Apple kexts which work better VoodooTSCSync: No idea why this is recommended anymore, only needed for CPUs that don't have native support in the OS X kernel (only applies to some AMD CPUs and new LGA2011-3 Intel CPUs using the X99 chipset); i7-4790K has native support in Yosemite (in fact, the Retina iMac has this as a CPU option), so no need for it ALXEthernet: Older ethernet kext that doesn't work that well with newer Atheros/Killer NICs, I would recommend AtherosE2200Ethernet instead MacPro3,1 SMBIOS: You should use the SMBIOS of a Mac model that's similar to your hardware, since you have an i7-4790K and a 9-series motherboard, I would use iMac15,1 since it has very similar specs"

I even tried only installing the ALC1150 and it started saying on boot that it was waiting on the root device.  By luck I reverted it again, but I think I'm going to just deal with the bad video sound to be honest since it's stable.  I've already tried all the stock kexts for ethernet and the Killer is the only one that works (Killer NIC).

This also leads up to me asking why you haven't selected a CPU cooler. Save yourself the trouble and forgo the stock heat sink and straight to a aftermarket even if it's a CM HYPER212. Don't skimp on the power supply. I would go 650W minimum. Especially if your going to overclock your CPU and MSI GTX970. I actually have the same card and it is a sweet ass overclocker even without a modded bios. Think 750W if you ever decide to SLI. Dual booting from 2 SSDs is the smart thing to do so that is a great choice. Another thing to think about down the road is separating your storage drives per OS. So another 1TB maybe in your future. If you live in the states near a Microcenter they have the best processor and combo deals hands down every month, but it's instore only. For instance right now the 4690k bundled with your selected motherboard would be $260 before tax and after a $20MIR which is only $13 more dollars than you have picked out and would be well worth the $13."

You learn more and understand how the whole process works, which is better in the long run. You also run a more vanilla system which will work with updates (in most cases) without issues. Since he doesn't have an existing OS X install, he can download a prebuilt OS X VM and use that to download OS X Yosemite from the App Store and create a bootable USB. I also wouldn't recommend Unibeast for X99 systems because you will have to manually patch the kernel every time you update, where as Clover has a built-in auto patcher for X99 systems."

hackintosh,3biezh,blue_pixel,2,Mon Jun 29 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"It's honestly great in OS X, and not too bad in Windows 8.1.  In OS X, you can choose between a few different resolutions - I use either native (2160p) or one step larger (in this pic, it would be the right-most or 2nd right most).  I sit about 24"" away and menus are incredibly clear, just like on a Mac retina display.  Strangely enough, non-native resolutions look as crisp as the native one.  The best part is that I can easily view 6 to 8 documents at once.  I think the 27"" size is perfect for this resolution too.  One of my coworkers has Dell's 24"" 4K screen and has to always run it in a scaled resolution."
hackintosh,3biezh,daveb25,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:37:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I didn't realize OS X provided all those scaling options for 4k like it does for retina displays so that's good to know. The thought of a 1440p workspace at 160 ppi is sounding really tempting.

hackintosh,3bjxhl,Lukeblig,3,Mon Jun 29 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"iMessage will work best with Clover + native NVRAM. If you have new hardware that can boot UEFI and are using OsxAptioFix2Drv then you'll most likely have native NVRAM. For iMessage to work properly, you'll need several things. If you follow all of these steps correctly, you should have working iMessage:   Valid SMBIOS Data   Valid model identifier (preferably something that matches your hardware the most; for example, i7-4790K with Z97 chipset=iMac15,1): Clover should automatically pick a good match for your hardware if you didn't mess with the config Generated serial number with valid format, but isn't a real serial number: I actually wrote a script for this - just run it with the desired model number as an argument (for example: ./simpleMacSerial iMac15,1) [NOTE: Currently only supports Mac minis and iMacs, will add more support later]; you could also use Clover Configurator and generate your SMBIOS data (including a serial number) with that; make sure you check here to see if the serial number doesn't belong to a real Mac and here to see if the serial number has a valid format (if so, it should tell you info about it) Generated MLB value based off your serial number data: Make sure you have a valid serial that shows up in About This Mac, and generate a MLB value based off the data from your serial number using simpleMLB, another script I wrote; you don't have to enter any arguments if you are generating a MLB value for the machine you are running the script on (you can run it like this: ./simpleMLB); if you want more information about your serial number you can use the debug option (like this: ./simpleMLB -debug); place the generated MLB value in config.plist under RtVariables as a string named MLB Generated SmUUID value: Use uuidgen in Terminal to generate a UUID and place the generated SmUUID value in config.plist under SMBIOS as a string named SmUUID; you should also set InjectSystemID to true under SystemParameters in config.plist Correct ROM value: Your ROM value should be set to the MAC address of one of your NICs (this is similar to what real Macs do - they use the hardware address of the Thunderbolt chipset or the FireWire chipset as the ROM value); the ROM value should be set in config.plist under RtVariables as a string named ROM with the value UseMacAddr0  Working NVRAM   NVRAM Testing: You can test if your NVRAM is working by running the following Terminal command and rebooting: sudo nvram TestVar=HelloWorld; once you reboot, run sudo nvram -p | grep 'TestVar'; if you see a result, your NVRAM is working; if not, your NVRAM is broken and needs to be fixed, or otherwise iMessage won't work; after testing, you can delete the TestVar variable by running sudo nvram -d TestVar  Native UEFI NVRAM: If you are using a system that boots using UEFI (not legacy BIOS) and is relatively new (Intel Z68 and newer with UEFI) and are using OsxAptioFixDrv2 (recommended over regular OsxAptioFixDrv), you will most likely have working hardware NVRAM (use the commands above to test; make sure you aren't using any drivers or scripts that emulate the NVRAM for it to be accurate); if this is the case, you won't have to use any NVRAM emulation drivers or scripts (NOTE: Don't use the ""Install RC Scripts to target partition"" with Clover, it is useless if you're using hardware NVRAM and/or if you're not using EmuVariableUefi) Emulated NVRAM: If your system is older and boots using legacy BIOS instead of UEFI or doesn't have working hardware NVRAM in OS X, you can emulate the NVRAM functionality using the EmuVariableUefi driver and Clover's RC Scripts (select ""Install RC Scripts to target partition"" in the Clover installer); this will save the NVRAM data to a file at every shutdown, and the EmuVariableUefi driver will load this file and pass it to OS X as the NVRAM data    If you have both of these things working, iMessage should work. Worst case, you will get a customer code when you log in. This is normal - you'll have to contact Apple and answer some questions related to your security for them to whitelist your Hack. If they ask for a serial number, say that you are unable to get it or not at the computer at the moment.  Troubleshooting:  If iMessage logs in but instantly logs you out, or it seems like it logged in but when you check Message Preferences it failed to log in with an unknown error, your generated SMBIOS data is invalid, and you should check that your SMBIOS data in config.plist follows all of the requirements above.  If iMessage requires you to log in at every boot, your NVRAM probably isn't persistent (it isn't being saved in the UEFI [if native] or not being saved to a file (if emulated). Run the NVRAM test above to check if it is working between boots.  Example config.plist:  If you follow all of these steps correctly, your config.plist should look something like this (these are all generated example values; don't use these and generate your own values or you WILL run into issues with iMessage account blacklisting):  <key>RtVariables</key> <dict>     <key>MLB</key>     <string>C02452301GUF49R1F</string>     <key>ROM</key>     <string>UseMacAddr0</string> </dict> <key>SMBIOS</key> <dict>     <key>ProductName</key>     <string>iMac15,1</string>     <key>SerialNumber</key>     <string>C02NVKVZFY11</string>     <key>SmUUID</key>     <string>CD8EE581-48EC-4143-8013-CE7DDBCB12A7</string> </dict> <key>SystemParameters</key> <dict>     <key>InjectKexts</key>     <string>Yes</string>     <key>InjectSystemID</key>     <true/> </dict>   Credits:   Info about the MLB and ROM was taken mainly from holyfield's post on InsanelyMac Info about Apple's serial number format (used in my simpleMacSerial script) was taken mainly from MacRumors Info about NVRAM was taken mainly from info from pokenguy's post on InsanelyMac"

hackintosh,3bj162,bolshevix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"Get a H97 or even H81 motherboard (a much cheaper one). Now you've chosen an overclocking (Z97) motherboard with a locked CPU and paying premium for that. Get one for <90$ unless the one for 140 really has features you really can't live without. Get the i5-4460 (unless the price difference is <5$) If you're serious about gaming, invest the difference into a better GPU, like GTX 970, and get a cheaper case instead. If you're not serious about gaming, just stick with integrated HD4600, it will be plenty enough for work, and it will run some small games. 550W PSU will be enough unless you will be doing SLI, which you won't. I'd go with a single stick of 8GB for now, and add another 8GB if you find necessary for better upgradability.   Ability to upgrade parts except for GPU, RAM and hard drives is none, since the new intel CPUs and chipsets are already becoming available, there will be no new CPUs released for 1155 socket, if you're not in a rush, you might as well wait for intel 100 series chipsets and Skylake CPUs, which will be released somewhere from August onwards, they will feature intel iris pro graphics, which is much better than HD4600, so one more reason to get rid of 750.

Motherboard is good, but might need a patched UEFI to remove a locked 0x2 MSR register (needed for native power management so you can avoid patching the kernel every update).

So, I have barely just scratched the surface, but from what I gather so far, seeing as it is been years since I've looked into hackintosh builds, it seems like hardware configurations are very flexible now days.

hackintosh,3bem0i,TheRacerMaster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"RAM doesn't matter at all, there's nothing wrong with Kingston, Crucial, Corsair, Samsung, etc. Lots of people use Gigabyte boards because they have the 0x2 MSR register unlocked by default, which makes things a bit easier (although it's not really hard to patch the UEFI to manually unlock the 0x2 register). Most boards these days have similar chipsets and most of them work well. The ASUS board you picked is high quality and should work fine. Z97 chipset should work fine (with USB and SATA being natively supported). There's an ASMedia chipset which controls two of the SATA ports - I'd use the Intel chipset SATA ports instead. Intel i218-V Ethernet should work fine with IntelMausiEthernet. ALC1150 should work with an AppleHDA injector kext. Power management should work natively with a generated SSDT. I'd highly recommend using Clover to install OS X."

hackintosh,3bem0i,torokunai,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:14:55 2015 UTC,"If you take the time to do things properly (e.g. researching your hardware, finding out what works out for you setup, etc.), you'll experience very little problems, especially if you use Clover. If you use Clover, you can put Hackintosh kexts (such as FakeSMC, HWSensors, and ethernet kexts) in the EFI partition and configure Clover to automatically patch kexts that would normally have to be replaced after every update (for example, AppleHDA; with Clover kext patches to handle the binary patches+the injector kext in /System/Library/Extensions, you can use a 100% vanilla AppleHDA.kext and retain audio after updates). If the kexts are on the EFI partition, you can boot a otherwise native OS X install that you could boot on a real Mac (note: there are some exceptions - for example, AppleHDA can stay native but needs an injector kext in /System/Library/Extensions [in this case, AppleHDA1150.kext] because it directly links to AppleHDA in order to inject the platform and layout files for your audio codec; Clover can do the patches to the AppleHDA binary).

I'll be sure to pm you with the link when it's up maybe within about a week. I'll also update this comment with the link.  I was unable to even boot from usb or ssd with the GT 620m was enabled so I've disabled it and just using the integrated HD4000 which works really well.

And after installing the kext and modifying the DSDT reboot and go to settings --> network and remove all the items in the left hand column. Now go to /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration and delete NetworkInterfaces.plist and reboot. Go to settings --> network and click the plus button in the bottom left corner and add an ethernet interface. Now add your wireless adapter and mac app store should work. It's very important that the ethernet interface is the first thing you add before anything else.

hackintosh,3bcl2h,sPhyre,2,Sat Jun 27 23:00:12 2015 UTC,You wouldn't need that cpu cooler unless you were thinking of overclocking. You'd probably not need to with that i7 and should be fine.

It would probably make your machine in particular run much more smoothly and it actually wouldn't be difficult to do at all. You can follow this guide here and it tells you exactly what you need for your motherboard. I followed it exactly and got my Z97 build running perfectly in about an hour.  Let me know if doing that interests you and I'd be more than happy to walk you through it. Otherwise we can talk more about what in Chameleon seems to be giving you problems.
hackintosh,3bbjnn,ryanyesterday,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:22:22 2015 UTC,I'll do Clover.  How would I migrate from Clover to Chameleon flawlessly and how should I set it up?
hackintosh,3bbjnn,ryanyesterday,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:41:40 2015 UTC,"Well there are two options. First would be to use a bootable USB with Clover for the time being and not having to reinstall OSX. This would work for a bit and stop you from having to reinstall Yosemite.  Second option would be follow the instructions in that Haswell.dmg download which includes the necessary Clover instructions to get up and running 100%. So download that file and you can follow the steps there to get up and running. After that you can use Clover Configurator to add things like TRIM Support, and the necessary values to get iMessage working flawlessly. I'm also fairly certain your GPU is natively supported by OSX so thank goodness you won't have to deal with the NVIDIA web drivers.  Let me know which option you want to go with and I can help walk you through that Haswell.dmg guide. For the most part it's straight forward but I can double check your steps if you'd like."

Run the following commands in the command line window that the Windows installer gives you:  diskpart select disk 0 clean convert gpt create partition efi size=200 format fs=fat32 create partition msr size=128 create partition primary size=102400   Replace 102400 with the size you want for your Windows partition in megabytes (1 gigabyte=1024 megabytes in this case).
